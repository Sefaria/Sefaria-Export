            "The Torah law obligating a man whose brother died without children [<i>yavam</i>] to marry his deceased brother’s widow [<i>yevama</i>] or to free her from her levirate bonds through the act of <i>ḥalitza</i> applies only when it is permitted for the widow to marry her surviving brother-in-law. However, in cases where the <i>yevama</i> is forbidden to her <i>yavam</i> due to her status as a close family relative, the mitzva of levirate marriage is not applicable, and she is exempt from both levirate marriage and <i>ḥalitza</i>.<br>The Sages further taught that the exemption of a <i>yevama</i> from levirate marriage also exempts her rival wife. In other words, if the deceased brother had two wives, each a so-called rival of the other, and only one wife is a relative of the surviving brother, then the rival wife is also exempt from both levirate marriage and <i>ḥalitza</i>. Moreover, if that same rival wife entered into levirate marriage with a different brother of the deceased, one to whom she is not forbidden, then were this third brother also to die childless, so that the obligation of levirate marriage would again be incurred by the second brother, not only is the forbidden rival wife exempt from levirate marriage and <i>ḥalitza</i>, her new rival wives from her second marriage are also exempt.<br>That is to say, any other wife of the third brother is exempt from the mitzva of levirate marriage, as she is the rival wife of that first rival wife, who was exempted from levirate marriage following her first husband’s death due the exemption of her original rival wife. The same principle applies if that second rival wife subsequently enters into levirate marriage with another permitted brother, and so on. In summary, every widow who is exempt from marrying her brother-in-law due to her status as rival wife of a forbidden relative is treated as a forbidden relative herself and is therefore exempt from both <i>ḥalitza</i> and levirate marriage and causes exemption for future rival wives as well.<br><br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna describes various cases that invoke the principles above. <b>Fifteen</b> categories of <b>women</b> constitute familial relations that are forbidden as incestuous, and consequently, these women <b>exempt their rival wives and the rival wives of their rival wives from <i>ḥalitza</i> and from levirate marriage forever,</b> i.e., they also exempt rival wives of rival wives of rival wives, and so on.",
            "<b>And these</b> women <b>are: The daughter</b> of the <i>yavam</i>, i.e., the deceased brother had married a daughter of his brother, which means that when he died childless, his brother’s own daughter came before her father for levirate marriage, and therefore she is exempt. <b>And</b> the same applies if the deceased brother’s widow is <b>the daughter of</b> the <b>daughter of</b> the <i>yavam</i>, <b>or</b> if she is <b>the daughter of his son,</b> or <b>the daughter of</b> his <b>wife.</b>",
            "<b>And</b> similarly, if the <i>yevama</i> is <b>the daughter of</b> the <b>son</b> of the wife of her <i>yavam</i> <b>or the daughter of</b> his wife’s <b>daughter, or</b> if she is the <b>mother-in-law</b> of her <i>yavam</i>, <b>or his mother-in-law’s mother, or his father-in-law’s mother,</b> then she is exempt from <i>ḥalitza</i> and levirate marriage.",
            "The mishna continues its list of close relatives. If the <i>yevama</i> is the <b>maternal</b> half <b>sister</b> of the <i>yavam</i>, <b>or</b> if she is the <b>sister of his mother, or his wife’s sister,</b> then she is exempt from both <i>ḥalitza</i> and levirate marriage <b>Or</b> if she was <b>the wife of his maternal</b> half <b>brother,</b> and after this brother died or divorced his wife, she married another of his father’s brothers, who was not her relative, and this brother died, she is exempt. In this case, the obligation to enter into levirate marriage should be incurred by the surviving brother, but since she was previously the wife of his maternal brother, she is exempt."
        ],
        [
            "<b>And</b> the same applies to the <b>wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist,</b> i.e., the wife of a man who died before his brother was born. As will be explained, the obligation of levirate marriage does not apply to the <i>yavam</i> in this case. Since levirate marriage does not apply to him, the <i>yevama</i> remains forbidden to him as his brother’s wife. <b>And</b> the last case is if one’s <i>yevama</i> had previously been <b>his daughter-in-law,</b> and after his son had died one’s brother married her, before he too passed away. <b>These</b> fifteen women <b>exempt their rival wives and the rival wives of their rival wives from <i>ḥalitza</i> and levirate marriage forever.</b>",
            "§ <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all of these</b> women listed as prohibited relations, these <i>halakhot</i> apply only if they were married to the deceased brother until the time of his death. However, this is not the case <b>if they died</b> during the deceased brother’s lifetime, <b>or</b> if <b>they refused</b> their husbands when they were minors. This refusal is referring to the decree of the Sages that a girl under the age of twelve whose father is no longer alive may be married off by her mother or brothers. However, this marriage is not final, as she can terminate it by performing an act of refusal, i.e., by declaring, while still a minor, that she does not desire this marriage. In this case, the marriage is annulled retroactively and she is considered as though she were never married at all.",
            "<b>Or</b> if those women <b>were divorced</b> by their husband, the deceased brother, <b>or were found to be a sexually underdeveloped woman [<i>aylonit</i>],</b> i.e., a woman who is so underdeveloped that she is not considered a woman in the full sense, these <i>halakhot</i> do not apply. Her marriage is considered a mistaken marriage and is null and void. In all these cases <b>their rival wives are permitted,</b> as the exemption for rival wives of forbidden relatives applies only when the forbidden relative was the brother’s wife at the time of his death, when the <i>halakhot</i> of levirate marriage came into effect.",
            "§ <b>And</b> the mishna comments that the language of this principle is imprecise, as <b>you cannot say with regard to his mother-in-law and with regard to his mother-in-law’s mother and with regard to his father-in-law’s mother that they were found to be an <i>aylonit</i>,</b> as an <i>aylonit</i> is sterile and therefore cannot become a mother or a mother-in-law. <b>Nor</b> is the mishna precise when it states: <b>Or refused,</b> as refusal applies only to minors, who cannot give birth.",
            "§ The mishna explains: <b>How do</b> these women <b>exempt their rival wives?</b> If, for example, <b>his daughter or any one of those</b> women <b>with whom relations are forbidden was married to his brother and</b> this brother <b>had another wife, and</b> the brother <b>died,</b> then <b>just as his daughter is exempt</b> from levirate marriage, <b>so too her rival wife is exempt.</b> If <b>his daughter’s rival wife</b> subsequently <b>went and married his second brother,</b> to whom she is permitted, <b>and he had another wife, and he died</b> childless as well, which means that his wife comes before the first <i>yavam</i>, the daughter’s father, for levirate marriage, then <b>just as his daughter’s rival wife is exempt, so too the rival wife of her rival wife is exempt.</b>",
            "The mishna adds: <b>Even if they are one hundred</b> brothers, the same logic applies. If a woman is exempt from levirate marriage because she is the rival wife of a forbidden relative or the rival wife of a rival wife of this kind, and she herself has an additional rival wife, this rival wife is also exempt and in turn exempts her own rival wives from levirate marriage.",
            "<b>How so?</b> What are the cases in which <b>if they died their rival wives are permitted?</b> If, for example, <b>one’s daughter or any one of those</b> women <b>with whom relations are forbidden was married to his brother, and</b> this brother <b>had another wife,</b> and then <b>his daughter died or was divorced and afterward his brother died, her rival wife is permitted</b> to him.",
            "§ The mishna states another principle: <b>And</b> if <b>any</b> of these forbidden relatives was a minor <b>who could refuse</b> her husband, then even if <b>she did not refuse, her rival wife performs <i>ḥalitza</i> and does not enter into levirate marriage.</b> The rival wife may not enter into levirate marriage, as she is the rival wife of a forbidden relative. However, she is not entirely exempt from levirate marriage and must be released by <i>ḥalitza</i> because the marriage of the forbidden relative was not a fully valid marriage, and therefore, by Torah law, the other woman is not considered a rival wife of a forbidden relative.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks a question with regard to the order of the mishna’s list: <b>Now,</b> since the <i>halakha</i> that <b>all these</b> women with whom relations are forbidden are exempt from levirate marriage and exempt their rival wives <b>is derived from</b> the case of <b>a wife’s sister,</b> as demonstrated later, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> the case of <b>a wife’s sister first</b> and only afterward mention the other instances, which are derived from that <i>halakha</i>.",
            "<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>the <i>tanna</i> cited</b> the cases in order of <b>severity,</b> then you must say that <b>it is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who says</b> that execution by <b>burning is more severe</b> than stoning. For this reason, the <i>tanna</i> began with the cases of one’s daughter and his daughter’s daughter and his son’s daughter and so forth, since one who has relations with these women is punished by burning, after which the <i>tanna</i> listed those cases that entail a lesser penalty.",
            "However, the Gemara argues that even so, the order of the mishna remains problematic. <b>If so, let him teach</b> the case of <b>one’s mother-in-law first, as the main</b> transgression that entails <b>burning is written with regard to his mother-in-law,</b> as it is stated: “And if a man take with his wife also her mother, it is wickedness; they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they” (Leviticus 20:14). <b>And furthermore, after his mother-in-law let him teach his daughter-in-law, as after</b> execution by <b>burning, stoning is the most severe</b> of the other capital punishments imposed by the courts.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara retracts the previous explanation in favor of the following: With regard to <b>his daughter, since</b> this prohibition is actually <b>derived from a homiletical interpretation</b> and is not explicitly stated in the Torah, <b>it is</b> therefore <b>dear</b> to the <i>tanna</i>. Consequently, he listed this novel case of a daughter first."
        ],
        [
            "The Gemara challenges this conclusion: <b>All</b> of the exemptions from levirate marriage for forbidden relatives listed in the mishna <b>are also derived from a homiletical interpretation.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Although the matter of levirate marriage is derived from a homiletical interpretation, the main</b> aspect <b>of their prohibition is explicitly written.</b> By contrast, with regard to <b>his daughter</b> from a woman he raped but did not marry, <b>the main</b> aspect <b>of</b> this <b>prohibition is</b> derived <b>by homiletical interpretation,</b> as the prohibition itself is not written explicitly in the Torah.",
            "<b>As Rava said: Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi said to me:</b> This prohibition is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the word <b><i>hena</i>,</b> in the verse: “The nakedness of your son’s daughter, or of your daughter’s daughter, even their nakedness you shall not uncover; for theirs [<i>hena</i>] is your own nakedness” (Leviticus 18:10) and the word <b><i>hena</i></b> in a different verse: “You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; you shall not take her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s daughter, to uncover her nakedness: they [<i>hena</i>] are near kinswomen; it is wickedness” (Leviticus 18:17), indicating that every daughter is prohibited, even one from rape, just like one’s daughter through his wife.",
            "Furthermore, it is <b>derived</b> from a verbal analogy between the word <b>“wickedness”</b> (Leviticus 18:17) and the word <b>“wickedness”</b> in the verse: “And if a man take with his wife also her mother, it is wickedness; they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they, that there be no wickedness among you” (Leviticus 20:14), that one who has sexual intercourse with a daughter from a rape is liable to burning.",
            "§ The Gemara asks: <b>Now that you said</b> that <b>all matters that are derived from a homiletical interpretation are dear to</b> the <i>tanna</i>, and therefore he gives them precedence, <b>let him teach</b> the case of <b>a wife’s sister last,</b> as this is the source of the <i>halakha</i> and is therefore the most straightforward case. The Gemara responds: <b>Since</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>was dealing with the prohibition</b> with regard <b>to</b> different types of <b>sisters, he</b> also <b>taught</b> together with them the prohibition with regard to <b>his wife’s sister.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>let him teach this</b> entire <b>section</b> involving sisters <b>at the end,</b> when he mentions a wife’s sister. <b>Rather,</b> the Gemara rejects the above answer in favor of an alternative explanation: <b>The <i>tanna</i> cited</b> the cases in order of <b>closeness,</b> i.e., the mishna is ordered in accordance with the relative closeness of the various incestuous relations. How so? The <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> the cases of <b>one’s daughter, and the daughter of his daughter, and the daughter of his son, who are his own</b> blood <b>relatives.</b>",
            "<b>And since he taught three generations of one’s</b> offspring <b>below,</b> i.e., his daughter, his daughter’s daughter, and his son’s daughter, he <b>also taught three generations of</b> his wife’s offspring <b>below,</b> i.e., his wife herself, her daughter, and her daughter’s daughter. <b>And since he taught three generations of</b> his wife’s offspring <b>below, he</b> also <b>taught three generations of her</b> family <b>above,</b> i.e., from previous generations, namely herself, her mother, i.e., his mother-in-law, and his mother-in-law’s mother.",
            "<b>And</b> afterward <b>he taught</b> the case of <b>his sister and his mother’s sister, who are his own</b> blood <b>relatives</b> but less closely related to him than his daughter. <b>And since he was dealing with the prohibition</b> with regard <b>to sisters, he</b> also <b>taught</b> the case of <b>his wife’s sister. And by right</b> the <i>tanna</i> should have <b>preceded</b> the case of <b>his daughter-in-law before</b> that of <b>a wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist, as it is not due to their relationship that she is prohibited</b> but rather because she is excluded from the mitzva of levirate marriage. <b>However, since he was dealing with the prohibition</b> with regard <b>to siblings, he taught</b> the case of <b>a wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist,</b> as this also involves a sibling. <b>And then</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> the case of <b>his daughter-in-law.</b>",
            "§ The Gemara continues to analyze the language of the mishna: <b>And why does</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>specifically teach: They exempt</b> their rival wives? <b>Let him teach: They prohibit</b> them, as ultimately the rival wives are not only exempt from levirate marriage but each is actually forbidden to her <i>yavam</i>. The Gemara explains that <b>if</b> he had <b>taught: They prohibit</b> them, <b>I would say</b> that this means <b>it is prohibited to enter into levirate marriage, but she must perform <i>ḥalitza</i>.</b> Therefore, <b>it teaches us</b> using the language of exemption to indicate that she is entirely exempt and does not even perform <i>ḥalitza</i>.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: If so, <b>let him teach: She is prohibited from performing <i>ḥalitza</i>.</b> The Gemara rejects this suggestion: It is impossible to formulate the <i>halakha</i> in this manner, as even if they perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>what has he</b> really <b>done?</b> What is wrong with a man allowing a woman to take off his shoe, which is the act of <i>ḥalitza</i>? Consequently, it is not possible to state: Prohibited from performing <i>ḥalitza</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>Why not?</b> There is in fact a prohibited element here: <b>If you say she performs <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> it might be said that <b>she may</b> also <b>enter into levirate marriage</b> and that in this specific instance he performed <i>ḥalitza</i> merely because he did not wish to marry her. In that case, it might erroneously be claimed that if another wished to marry the rival wife of his <i>yevama</i> he is permitted to enter into levirate marriage.",
            "In light of the previous argument, the Gemara suggests another reason that the mishna does not use the expression: Prohibited. <b>Since</b> it is only <b>in cases where the mitzva</b> of levirate marriage <b>applies that the rival wife is forbidden</b> to him, <b>and where no mitzva applies she is permitted,</b> as it is permitted for the man to marry the widowed rival wife of a non-relative, <b>due to that</b> reason <b>he taught: They exempt</b> their rival wives, and not: <b>They prohibit</b> them. In other words, the <i>tanna</i> is teaching that they are not prohibited to him in their own right.",
            "§ The Gemara continues its analysis of the wording of the mishna. <b>And why does</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>specifically teach:</b> Exempt <b>from <i>ḥalitza</i> and from levirate marriage? Let him teach:</b> Exempt <b>from levirate marriage, alone.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> he were to <b>teach: From levirate marriage, I would say</b> that <b>she must perform <i>ḥalitza</i></b> and <b>she must not enter into levirate marriage.</b> The <i>tanna</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that <b>every</b> woman <b>who is eligible for levirate marriage is eligible for <i>ḥalitza</i>, and anyone who is ineligible for levirate marriage is</b> likewise <b>ineligible for <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> as no obligation of <i>ḥalitza</i> applies unless there is an obligation of a levirate marriage.",
            "§ The Gemara further inquires: <b>And let him teach: From levirate marriage and from <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> as the Torah states the option of levirate marriage first. <b>Alternatively,</b> let him teach: <b>From <i>ḥalitza</i>, alone,</b> as this would indicate that she may not enter into levirate marriage either. The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Abba Shaul, who said: The mitzva of <i>ḥalitza</i> takes precedence over the mitzva of levirate marriage,</b> as he maintains that one who does not enter into levirate marriage for the sake of Heaven transgresses the prohibition against marrying one’s brother’s wife, and therefore it would be better in every case to perform <i>ḥalitza</i>. Consequently, the <i>tanna</i> mentions <i>ḥalitza</i> before levirate marriage.",
            "§ The Gemara asks another question with regard to the language of the mishna: <b>The enumeration of the first clause</b> of the mishna: Fifteen women, which indicates that those women alone are included in this list, serves <b>to exclude what?</b> Which other cases might have been included? <b>And the enumeration of the latter clause,</b> which states: These exempt their rival wives, again meaning these and no others, serves <b>to exclude what?</b> Since the mishna specifies only these women and no others, the Gemara asks which other women might have been included in these lists."
        ],
        [
            "The Gemara answers that these enumerations come <b>to exclude</b> those additions <b>of Rav and of Rav Asi.</b> Rav added the rival wife of a woman suspected by her husband of adultery [<i>sota</i>], while Rav Asi added the rival wife of an <i>aylonit</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav and according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Asi,</b> the enumeration of the mishna comes <b>to exclude what?</b>",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>If each maintains</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of the other,</b> then <b>one</b> enumeration of the mishna comes <b>to exclude the rival wife of a wife who performed refusal.</b> If the deceased brother had two wives, one of whom was a minor, and she refused the <i>yavam</i>, her rival wife is prohibited from levirate marriage with him. However, the latter is not entirely exempt and must perform <i>ḥalitza</i>. <b>And</b> the other <b>one comes to exclude the rival wife</b> of the wife <b>of one who remarries his divorcée,</b> i.e., a woman who was illicitly remarried by her former husband after she had been married to another man.",
            "<b>And if</b> Rav and Rav Asi <b>do not</b> each <b>maintain</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of the other,</b> then <b>one</b> enumeration comes <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of the other,</b> as they do not agree that the <i>halakha</i> stated by the other should be included in the mishna, <b>and</b> the other <b>one</b> comes <b>to exclude</b> one of the above suggestions, <b>either the rival wife of</b> a wife <b>who performed refusal or the rival wife</b> of the wife <b>of one who remarries his divorcée.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: If so, <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav and according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Asi, let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach these</b> cases. Since in their opinions there are more than fifteen women to whom the principle of the mishna applies, why weren’t they all stated by the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna? The Gemara answers: They were not taught because they do not completely fit all of the halakhic rulings here.",
            "The Gemara elaborates: This is <b>because they do not</b> involve the case <b>of a rival wife of a rival wife.</b> With regard to the fifteen women listed, the discussion of the mishna concerning rival wives and rival wives of rival wives is appropriate. However, the two cases cited by Rav and Rav Asi do not leave room for such deliberations, as both a <i>sota</i> and an <i>aylonit</i> are exempt and forbidden equally to all of the brothers, because their prohibition does not result from a familial relation to one of the living brothers but from a personal issue relating to the women themselves. Since none of the brothers may marry her rival wife, there is no possibility of a rival wife of a rival wife, and consequently these cases were omitted from the mishna’s list of fifteen women.",
            "§ After analyzing the order and language of the mishna, the Gemara discusses the <i>halakhot</i> themselves. <b>From where are these matters,</b> that if one’s forbidden relative comes before him for levirate marriage he is prohibited from marrying her or her rival wife, derived? It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“And you shall not take a woman to her sister, to be a rival to her, to uncover her nakedness, with her in her lifetime”</b> (Leviticus 18:18). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> the apparently superfluous phrase: <b>“With her”?</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>Since it is stated</b> with regard to the wife of a deceased brother: <b>“Her brother-in-law will have intercourse with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5), <b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> that when <b>the verse speaks of</b> the mitzva of levirate marriage, it includes <b>even any one of those with whom relations are forbidden,</b> as <b>mentioned in the Torah.</b> Therefore, one derives a verbal analogy: <b>It is stated here,</b> with regard to a wife’s sister: <b>“With her,” and it is stated there,</b> with regard to a levirate marriage: <b>“With her.”</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> explains the verbal analogy. <b>Just as there,</b> a levirate marriage involves <b>the performance of a mitzva, so too, here,</b> the statement “uncover her nakedness with her” includes <b>the performance of a mitzva, and the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“You shall not take.”</b> The phrase “with her” teaches that even in a case where there is an obligation of levirate marriage, the Torah prohibition proscribing forbidden relatives remains in force.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>she,</b> his wife’s sister, is exempt from levirate marriage; <b>from where</b> do I derive that <b>her rival wife</b> is also exempt? <b>The verse states: “To be a rival</b> to her” (Leviticus 18:18), which indicates that not only is she prohibited, but so too is her rival wife. <b>And I have</b> derived <b>only her rival wife; from where</b> is it derived that <b>the rival wife of her rival wife</b> is also exempt? <b>The verse states: “To be a rival [<i>litzror</i>],”</b> using the full spelling with a double <i>reish</i>, <b>and not <i>latzor</i>;</b> this indicates that there are several rival wives, one after another.",
            "<b>And I have</b> derived from this verbal analogy <b>only</b> that the mitzva of levirate marriage does not apply to <b>a wife’s sister.

            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> the cases of <b>those</b> women themselves with whom relations are forbidden; <b>from where</b> is it derived that <b>their rival wives</b> are also exempt from levirate marriage? <b>You</b> can <b>say</b> as follows: <b>Just as a wife’s sister is specific</b> in <b>that she is a forbidden relative and</b> this is a prohibition <b>for whose intentional</b> violation <b>one is liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i>, and for whose unwitting</b> violation one is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering,</b> and she is <b>prohibited to the <i>yavam</i></b> in levirate marriage, <b>and her rival wife is</b> likewise <b>prohibited; so too, any</b> woman <b>with whom relations are forbidden and</b> this is a prohibition <b>for whose intentional</b> violation <b>one is liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i>, and for whose unwitting</b> violation one is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering, and</b> this woman is one <b>who is forbidden to the <i>yavam</i>, her rival wife is</b> likewise <b>forbidden.</b> The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>From here the Sages stated</b> that <b>fifteen women exempt their rival wives and the rival wives of their rival wives from <i>ḥalitza</i> and from levirate marriage forever.</b>",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to that which <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught,</b> that the mention of wool and linen is superfluous and teaches that they are not prohibited in the case of ritual fringes, <b>the reason</b> is <b>that the Merciful One</b> specifically <b>writes wool and linen.</b> From here it may be inferred <b>that if that were not so, I would say that the Merciful One prohibits</b> a mixture of <b>diverse kinds in ritual fringes.</b> Can it be considered that this is the case? <b>But isn’t it written: “That they make themselves fringes on the corners of their garments”</b> (Numbers 15:38)?",

Conversely, this <i>tanna</i> holds that even when one removes all of the hair on the head, as a leper does when he performs his ritual shaving, as this act includes the corners, he thereby transgresses the prohibition against rounding the corners. This demonstrates that a positive mitzva overrides a prohibition.",
            "The Gemara raises an objection against that claim. This proof <b>can be refuted: What</b> about the fact <b>that the prohibition against rounding</b> is specific <b>in that this prohibition is not equally applicable for all,</b> as it does not apply to women, and therefore other cases cannot be derived from it?

            "§ The Gemara returns to the issue of a mitzva overriding a prohibition: <b>We have found that a positive mitzva overrides a regular prohibition.</b> However, <b>where do we find that</b> a positive mitzva <b>overrides a prohibition that includes <i>karet</i>, as</b> the phrase <b>“with her” is necessary to prohibit her?</b> It was mentioned previously that the superfluous phrase “with her” teaches that the mitzva of levirate marriage does not override the prohibition against taking a wife’s sister.

            "<b>And if you</b> suggest an answer and <b>say: Let us derive</b> this claim <b>from</b> the mitzva of <b>circumcision,</b> as there is a positive mitzva to perform circumcision on the eighth day of the boy’s life even on Shabbat, and this mitzva overrides the prohibition against performing labor on Shabbat, which is punishable by <i>karet</i>, one could respond: <b>What</b> about the fact <b>that circumcision</b> is an extremely important and severe positive mitzva, <b>as thirteen covenants were established over it?</b> The term “covenant” is mentioned thirteen times in the chapter of circumcision (Genesis, chapter 17).",
            "The Gemara adds: And if you say it is derived <b>from the</b> slaughter of <b>the Paschal lamb,</b> which overrides Shabbat and is therefore a positive mitzva that overrides a prohibition punishable by <i>karet</i>, this too can be rejected: <b>What</b> about the fact <b>that the Paschal lamb</b> is different, as it is a positive mitzva that is so severe that its neglect entails <b><i>karet</i></b> for those who do not bring it, unlike all other positive mitzvot?",
            "The Gemara offers yet another suggestion: Perhaps it is derived <b>from the daily offering,</b> which was slaughtered every day, even on Shabbat.

            "The Gemara says: Clearly, the principle <b>cannot be derived from</b> any single <b>one</b> of these cases. However, <b>let it be derived from two</b> of these cases combined together, by analyzing their common features. The Gemara asks: <b>From which</b> two cases can <b>it be derived?</b> If one would say that it can be derived <b>from circumcision and the Paschal lamb,</b> the factor common to both is their particular severity, <b>as</b> their neglect entails <b><i>karet</i>.</b> If one would seek to derive this <b>from the Paschal lamb and the daily offering,</b> these have a different common factor, <b>as</b> both are <b>a requirement of</b> the altar in <b>the Temple,</b> not for personal benefit.",

After all, the court punishes one who violates a prohibition with lashes, which is not the case for a failure to uphold a positive mitzva. <b>And</b> yet by Torah law <b>the positive mitzva comes and overrides it.</b>",
            "If so, <b>what difference</b> is it <b>to me</b> if it is a case of <b>a minor stringency and what difference</b> is it <b>to me</b> if it is <b>a major stringency?</b> Once the Torah has stated that a positive mitzva supersedes a prohibition, there should be no difference between a relatively stringent prohibition and a lenient one. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “You shall not kindle.”</b> In sum, the Gemara has not found a clear proof for the opinion that a positive mitzva supersedes a prohibition that incurs <i>karet</i>.",
            "Consequently, the Gemara suggests a different interpretation. The superfluous phrase “with her” indeed teaches that the obligation of levirate marriage does not override the prohibition with regard to women with whom relations are forbidden. However, this derivation is required not because one might have thought that a positive mitzva supersedes a prohibition that incurs <i>karet</i>. <b>Rather,</b> this phrase <b>is necessary</b> because it could <b>enter your mind to say: Let this</b> case of <b>a brother’s wife,</b> to whom the mitzva of levirate marriage applies, <b>be</b> treated in accordance with a well-established hermeneutical principle: <b>A matter that was included in a generalization, but emerged to teach, emerged to teach not just about itself but to teach about the entire generalization.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains the application of this principle to the current case. Since the prohibition proscribing a brother’s wife is included in the general prohibition with regard to women with whom relations are forbidden, it can be claimed that the <i>halakha</i> of levirate marriage renders not only a brother’s childless wife permitted, but in this case it renders permitted all women with whom relations are usually forbidden. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that clarifies this hermeneutical principle: <b>A matter that was included in a generalization, but emerged</b> to teach, emerged to teach not just about itself but to teach about the entire generalization. <b>How so?</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> provides an example of this principle by citing a verse: <b>“But the soul that eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings</b> that belong to the Lord, <b>with his ritual impurity upon him,</b> that soul shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 7:20). <b>But aren’t peace-</b>offerings <b>included in</b> the general category <b>of</b> all <b>consecrated offerings? And why were they</b> explicitly <b>singled out</b> from of the rest in the above verse? <b>To draw an analogy between them and to say to you: Just as peace-</b>offerings <b>are unique</b> in that they are <b>consecrated for the altar, so too,</b> this <i>halakha</i> that one who eats of them is liable to receive <i>karet</i> applies to <b>all</b> food that is <b>consecrated for the altar,</b> which <b>excludes</b> objects that are <b>consecrated for the Temple maintenance.</b>",
            "The above <i>baraita</i> provided an example of the principle that an item singled out from a general category teaches a <i>halakha</i> with regard to the entire category. <b>Here too,</b> one can argue: <b>This</b> case of <b>a brother’s wife was included in</b> the general category of <b>all</b> women <b>with whom relations are forbidden, and why was she singled out? To compare to her and say to you: Just as</b> a childless <b>brother’s wife is permitted, so too, all</b> women <b>with whom relations are forbidden are likewise permitted.</b>",
            "The Gemara raises an objection: <b>Is</b> it <b>comparable? There,</b> in the case cited as an example of this hermeneutical principle, <b>the generalization,</b> i.e., all offerings, are included <b>in the prohibition</b> against eating offerings while ritually impure, <b>and the detailed</b> case of peace-offerings is also included <b>in the prohibition.</b> Consequently, it can be said that the specific case was singled out to teach about the entire category. By contrast, <b>here,</b> in the case of levirate marriage with forbidden relatives, <b>the generalization</b> is included <b>in the prohibition</b> against engaging in forbidden relations, <b>and</b> yet <b>the detailed case is permitted.</b> Therefore, it cannot be said that the detail has been singled out so as to clarify some aspect of the general category; rather, its <i>halakha</i> differs from the rest.",
            "Instead, this case <b>is comparable only to</b> those that fit a different hermeneutical principle, concerning <b>a matter that was included in a generalization but emerged to discuss a new matter.</b> If a novel aspect or special ruling is taught with regard to a specific case within a broader general category, <b>then you cannot return it to its generalization</b> even for other matters, to the extent that this case has been entirely removed from the general category <b>until the Torah explicitly returns it</b> to its generalization. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a matter that was included in a generalization but emerged to discuss a new matter, you may not return it to its generalization until the Torah explicitly returns it</b> to its generalization.",
            "<b>How so?</b> The <i>baraita</i> provides an example of this principle. With regard to the guilt-offering of a leper, the verse states: <b>“And he shall slaughter the sheep in the place where they slaughter the sin-offering and the burnt-offering, in the place of the Sanctuary; for as the sin-offering is the priest’s, so is the guilt-offering”</b> (Leviticus 14:13). <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state: “As the sin-offering</b>…<b>so is the guilt-offering,”</b> since apparently this comparison does not teach anything new because the <i>halakhot</i> of guilt-offerings are already stated elsewhere (Leviticus 7:1–10), then <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “As the sin-offering</b>…<b>so is the guilt-offering”?</b>",
            "<b>Since the guilt-offering of a leper was specified</b> from the general category of all guilt-offerings <b>to discuss a new matter,</b> i.e., that the blood is placed on <b>the thumb</b> of the right hand <b>and the big toe of the right foot</b> of the leper, one <b>might</b> have thought that this guilt-offering <b>does not require placement of the blood and sacrificial parts on the altar,</b> as for this guilt-offering the placement of blood on the leper is sufficient."

            "The Gemara comments: <b>And had the verse not</b> explicitly <b>restored this</b> case of guilt-offering to its generalization, <b>I would say: With regard to that which was excluded</b> from the generalization as a novel ruling in this case, it was <b>excluded, and with regard to that</b> case <b>which was not excluded,</b> it was <b>not excluded, and</b> therefore the <i>halakha</i> would have been different in the various cases. <b>Here, too, I would say: A brother’s wife who was permitted</b> is <b>permitted,</b> whereas the <b>other</b> women <b>with whom relations are forbidden</b> were <b>not</b> permitted at all.

            "§ <b>Rather,</b> the suggestion that other women with whom relations are usually forbidden might be permitted for levirate marriage was based on a different argument: It might <b>enter your mind to say: Let</b> this claim <b>be derived by</b> the hermeneutical principle of: <b>What do we find</b> with regard to, which is a principle of inductive reasoning involving a comparison between cases that include similar details.

            "The Gemara wonders about this: <b>Is it comparable?</b> How can one case be derived from the other? <b>There,</b> in the case of a brother’s wife, only <b>one prohibition</b> has been permitted, the prohibition with regard to a brother’s wife, whereas <b>here,</b> we are dealing with <b>two prohibitions,</b> both a brother’s wife and a wife’s sister. The Gemara answers: It is nevertheless necessary to refute this suggestion, <b>lest you say: Since it is permitted, it is permitted.</b> In other words, as the Torah permitted a brother’s wife in levirate marriage despite the fact that she is ordinarily forbidden, she remains permitted even if the additional prohibition with regard to a wife’s sister applies to her.",
            "<b>And from where do you say that we state</b> this reasoning of: <b>Since it is permitted, it is permitted?

            "The <i>baraita</i> explains the reason for this exception.

Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The verse does not say <b>have intercourse,</b> but <b>“have intercourse with her.”</b> And it does not say <b>and consummate the levirate marriage,</b> but <b>“and consummate the levirate marriage with her.”</b> These phrases serve <b>to prohibit rival wives and</b> women <b>with whom relations are forbidden.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Are rival wives written here?</b> In other words, what is the connection between the verse and the topic of rival wives, an issue that is not even mentioned in the verse? <b>And furthermore:</b> The prohibition with regard to <b>rival wives is derived</b> from the phrase <b>“To be a rival wife [<i>litzror</i>],”</b> not from this source.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>derives</b> a different <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the phrase <b>“to be a rival wife,” in accordance with that</b> statement <b>of Rabbi Shimon.</b> In Rabbi Shimon’s opinion, the exemption of two sisters from levirate marriage applies not only when the <i>yavam</i> is married to one of the sisters, but also if two sisters who come before him for levirate marriage were previously married to two of his brothers. In that case, the levirate bond itself is sufficient for them to be considered rival wives of one another.",
            "And with regard to the previous question: <b>Are rival wives written here?</b> The answer is that <b>this is what he is saying: If so,</b> that the verse does not come to exempt rival wives, <b>let the verse state</b> only: <b>Have intercourse. What is</b> the meaning of <b>“have intercourse with her”?</b> It serves to limit the case to one woman and not two, in the following manner: <b>Anywhere that there are two</b> possibilities of <b>having intercourse,</b> i.e., there is a choice between marrying one of two women in levirate marriage, in such a way <b>that if he wants he may marry this one, and if he wants he may marry that one,</b> then each one is <b>permitted. And if</b> he does <b>not</b> have a choice and is obligated to marry one of them, e.g., if the other is a forbidden relation to him, <b>they are both prohibited,</b> including the rival wife.",
            "When the verse states: <b>“And consummate the levirate marriage with her,”</b> it comes to teach the following. <b>It is in a place</b> where <b>levirate marriage</b> is applicable <b>that a rival wife is prohibited,</b> whereas <b>in a place</b> where <b>levirate marriage</b> is <b>not</b> applicable, <b>a rival wife is permitted.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the Rabbis,</b> who do not interpret the verse in this manner, <b>what do they do with this</b> emphasis on <b>“have intercourse with her”?</b> How do they interpret it?",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>They need this for that which Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina</b> said, <b>as Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: “And have intercourse with her”</b> means marriage, i.e., she is fully his wife from that moment onward. This <b>teaches that he divorces her with a bill of divorce</b> after levirate marriage, and she can no longer be released by <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>and he</b> may subsequently <b>remarry her</b> if he so wishes. And the verse <b>“and consummate the levirate marriage with her,”</b> this means <b>against her will.</b> Although betrothal in general does not take effect without the woman’s consent, levirate marriage can be effected against her will.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> from where does <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi derive these widely accepted <i>halakhot</i>? The Gemara responds: <b>That</b> <i>halakha</i> cited by <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina,</b> that a woman taken in levirate marriage has the status of a regular wife who may be divorced and remarried, <b>is derived from</b> the verse “and take her to him <b>to be his wife”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5), which means that she will be his wife for all purposes, like any other wife. And the <i>halakha</i> that levirate marriage can be effected <b>against her will is derived from “her brother-in-law will have intercourse with her,”</b> which indicates that it can be achieved without her consent.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And what does Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>do with this</b> superfluous phrase, <b>“with her”?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>He needs it for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a different matter. The Sages said: <b>The court is obligated</b> to bring a bull as a sin-offering for an unwittingly committed communal sin on account of an erroneous <i>halakha</i> they taught <b>only for a matter whose intentional</b> transgression incurs <b><i>karet</i> and whose unwitting</b> violation necessitates the sacrifice of <b>a sin-offering. And similarly, the anointed</b> High Priest, who also brings a bull for an unwittingly committed sin, is obligated to do so only if his mistake involved a matter whose intentional transgression incurs <i>karet</i> and whose unwitting transgression necessitates the sacrifice of a sin-offering."

            "The Gemara answers: <b>As the Sages taught</b> with regard to an unwitting communal sin offering: <b>“And the sin by which they have sinned is known”</b> (Leviticus 4:14). <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: It is stated here,</b> with regard to a sin-offering: <b>“By which [<i>aleha</i>],” and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the prohibition with regard to a wife’s sister: <b>“Unto [<i>aleha</i>].”</b> This teaches by verbal analogy: <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of a wife’s sister, it is <b>a matter that for its intentional</b> violation <b>one is liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i> and for its unwitting</b> violation one is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering, so too here,</b> the offering is brought for <b>a matter that for its intentional</b> violation <b>one is liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i> and for its unwitting</b> violation one is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering.</b>",
            "The Gemara continues: <b>We found</b> a source for the <i>halakha</i> that the offering brought by the community is a sin-offering; <b>from where do we</b> derive that <b>an anointed</b> High Priest also brings a sin-offering for this transgression? <b>As it is written</b> with regard <b>to an anointed</b> High Priest: “If the anointed priest shall sin <b>so as to bring guilt on the people”</b> (Leviticus 4:3), which indicates that <b>an anointed</b> High Priest brings an offering <b>like the community.</b>",
            "From where is it derived that a private <b>individual and a <i>Nasi</i></b> bring sin-offerings only for a severe transgression of this kind? <b>This is derived</b> by verbal analogy between the words <b>“mitzvot”</b> and <b>“mitzvot”</b> that are stated three times, with regard to the community’s sin-offering, a private individual’s sin-offering, and the sin-offering of a <i>Nasi</i>: “Any of the mitzvot of the Lord that He has commanded not to be done” (Leviticus 4:2, 13, 22).",

This verbal analogy teaches that a congregation brings a sin-offering for idolatrous worship only if it involved a transgression that incurs <i>karet</i> when performed intentionally.",
            "The cases of a private <b>individual, a <i>Nasi</i>, and an anointed</b> High Priest are derived <b>from</b> a verse that deals with an unwitting sin of idolatry: <b>“And if one person</b> sin” (Numbers 15:27). <b>All</b> of these, a private <b>individual, a <i>Nasi</i>, and an anointed</b> High Priest, <b>are included</b> in this verse. In this case the principle: The letter <b><i>vav</i> adds to the previous matter,</b> applies. When a phrase begins with the conjunction <i>vav</i>, meaning: And, it is a continuation of the previous matter rather than a new topic. Based on this principle, these two <i>halakhot</i> are connected with one another.",
            "<b>And</b> therefore <b>let the lower,</b> i.e., the second, subject, a private individual, <b>be derived from the upper</b> issue, the community. Just as a community brings this offering only for a transgression whose intentional violation incurs <i>karet</i>, the same is true of a private individual. The verbal analogy stated in this <i>baraita</i> is Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s inference from the phrase “with her.”",
            "§ The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the Rabbis,</b> who interpret “with her” with regard to rival wives, <b>from where do they derive this conclusion</b> that one is liable to bring the offering for idolatrous worship only for a transgression whose intentional violation incurs <i>karet</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>They derive it from that which Rabbi Yehoshua</b> ben Levi <b>read out to his son</b> to teach him the verses that summarize the case of unwitting idol worship: <b>“You shall have one law [<i>Torah</i>] for him that does unwittingly. But the soul that does with a high hand,</b> whether he be home born or a stranger, he blasphemes the Lord; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people” (Numbers 15:29–30).",
            "In this manner, <b>the entire Torah is juxtaposed with idolatrous worship.

            "The Gemara comments: <b>We found</b> a source for a private <b>individual, a <i>Nasi</i>, and an anointed</b> High Priest, <b>whether</b> with regard <b>to idolatrous worship or</b> with regard <b>to</b> the <b>other mitzvot.

Once again, the letter <i>vav</i> teaches that these two cases are connected, <b>and let the upper,</b> the first, issue of a community, <b>be derived from the lower</b> case, that of a private individual.",
            "<b>However, from where do we</b> derive that <b>a community</b> brings an offering <b>for other mitzvot</b> only if the intentional violation of the prohibition incurs <i>karet</i>? The Gemara responds: <b>He derives</b> it from the aforementioned verbal analogy between <b>“from the eyes”</b> and <b>“from the eyes.”</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And what does Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>do with this</b> verse: <b>“One law”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He requires it for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Since we find that the Torah differentiates between</b> private <b>individuals</b> who sinned <b>and the many</b> who sinned in idol worship.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> elaborates: Private <b>individuals</b> who worshipped idols are sentenced <b>to stoning,</b> and <b>therefore their money is spared</b> from destruction. Although the sinner is put to death, his possessions are not destroyed. By contrast, the <b>many</b> are condemned to the lighter death penalty of decapitation <b>by sword,</b> the punishment for those who worshipped idols in an idolatrous city, and <b>therefore their money is forfeited,</b> as by Torah law all possessions belonging to the residents of an idolatrous city must be burned.",
            "Due to this difference, one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>we</b> should likewise <b>differentiate between their offerings,</b> i.e., if an individual and a community unwittingly practiced idolatrous worship, different offerings are brought in the two cases. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “One law for you.”</b> The word: “you” is in the plural, which indicates that an individual and a community that worshipped idols are subject to the same <i>halakha</i>.",
            "<b>Rav Ḥilkiya from</b> the city of <b>Hagronya strongly objects to this: The reason</b> for this ruling is <b>that the Merciful One</b> specifically <b>writes: “One law for you,”</b> from which it may be inferred that <b>if that were not so, I would say</b> that <b>we</b> should <b>differentiate</b> between the offerings of an individual and a community. If so, it is appropriate to ask: <b>What</b> offering <b>would they bring</b> if we were to differentiate? You cannot say <b>they would bring a bull,</b> as <b>it is a community</b> that sinned unwittingly <b>in</b> transgressing <b>other mitzvot who bring</b> a bull, and as this case is written separately, clearly its <i>halakha</i> is different.",
            "Likewise, you cannot say that they should bring <b>a ewe,</b> as <b>it is an individual</b> who sinned <b>in</b> transgressing <b>the other mitzvot who brings</b> a ewe.

If one were to suggest <b>a she-goat,</b> that would not be appropriate, because <b>this is the offering</b> of a private <b>individual as well,</b> since an individual brings a ewe or a she-goat as a sin-offering. Apparently there is no need for a special inference in this case, as there are no other possibilities.",
            "The Gemara answers: It <b>is necessary</b> for a verse to teach that there is no difference between the offerings of an individual and a community, as it might <b>enter your mind to say: Since a community</b> that sinned <b>by</b> the erroneous <b>instruction</b> of the court that it is permitted to practice idolatry <b>brings a bull as a burnt-offering and a goat as a sin-offering,</b> then, when a community sins of its own accord <b>they too</b> should <b>bring</b> these animals, but <b>the opposite,</b> i.e., a bull as a sin-offering and a goat as a burnt-offering.",
            "<b>Alternatively,</b> it could be argued: Theoretically a community <b>must</b> bring a different form of atonement from that of an individual, yet <b>they have no remedy,</b> as the Torah did not specify which offering is brought for a sin of the many. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> by means of the phrase “one law for you” that there is indeed an offering for the many who practiced idol worship.",
            "§ After discussing different interpretations of the relevant verses, the Gemara addresses the details of the <i>halakhot</i> of the mishna. It first considers the numbers that comprise the structure of the mishna as a whole. The Sage <b>Levi said to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: <b>Why does</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>specifically teach</b> the cases of <b>fifteen women? Let him teach</b> the cases of <b>sixteen</b> women, including the case of a rival wife of a forbidden relation. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him:</b> Judging by his question, <b>it seems to me that</b> this Sage <b>has no brain in his head.</b>",
            "Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi proceeded to explain the question and the answer himself: <b>What is your thinking?</b> Is it that the <i>tanna</i> should have included the case of <b>his mother</b> who had been <b>raped by his father?</b> In the opinion of the Rabbis, a woman raped by one’s father is permitted in marriage to another of his sons. Consequently, it is possible that she might give birth to a son and later marry one of the other sons of the rapist. If her husband subsequently died childless, this woman would come before the brother of the deceased for levirate marriage, who is in this case her son. If so, there are in fact sixteen women with whom relations are forbidden.",
            "However, continued Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, this is incorrect, as the case of <b>his mother raped by his father is</b> a matter of <b>dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis.</b> According to Rabbi Yehuda, a woman raped by one’s father could never come before him for levirate marriage, as it is prohibited for her to marry his brothers. <b>And</b> the <i>tanna</i> of this mishna <b>does not deal with disputed</b> cases. The mishna enumerates only those cases that are accepted by all opinions, not those that are a matter of dispute.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does the <i>tanna</i> really <b>not</b> mention disputed cases? <b>But</b> there are the cases of <b>a prohibition</b> resulting from <b>a mitzva</b> of the Sages, <b>and a prohibition</b> stemming from <b>sanctity.</b> In other words, the <i>tanna</i> does refer to the cases of a woman who one is prohibited to marry by decree of the Sages, e.g., a distant secondary forbidden relation, and one who is prohibited due to a regular prohibition that preserves the sanctity of the Jewish people or the priesthood.",
            "These are cases concerning <b>which Rabbi Akiva and the Rabbis disagree</b> whether these women are entirely exempt from both levirate marriage and <i>ḥalitza</i> like a forbidden relation, or whether the mitzva of levirate marriage does in fact apply but since the <i>yavam</i> may not marry her in practice, she must be released by <i>ḥalitza</i>. <b>And</b> yet these disputed cases <b>are taught</b> in the mishna.",
            "The Gemara responds: When <b>we say</b> that only accepted <i>halakhot</i> are included in the mishna, we are referring only to <b>our</b> present <b>chapter,</b> whereas the dispute between Rabbi Akiva and the Rabbis is stated in the second chapter. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> in this chapter it is stated that <b>Beit Shammai permit rival wives to the brothers,</b> as they hold that there is no prohibition against rival wives of those with whom relations are forbidden, <b>and Beit Hillel prohibit</b> this. Evidently, the first chapter does deal with disputed cases.",
            "The Gemara answers: When <b>Beit Shammai</b> express an opinion <b>where Beit Hillel</b> disagree, their opinion is considered as if it were <b>not</b> in the <b>mishna,</b> i.e., it is completely disregarded, as it is commonly accepted that the opinion of Beit Shammai is rejected and not ruled as <i>halakha</i>. Therefore, this cannot be considered a true dispute. The Gemara raises a further difficulty: <b>But</b> there is the case of <b>a wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist,</b> i.e., the <i>yavam</i> was not alive at the time of his brother’s death."

        [
            "This is a case concerning <b>which Rabbi Shimon and the Rabbis disagree, and</b> yet it <b>is taught.</b> If this <i>halakha</i> is taught, evidently this mishna does deal with matters subject to dispute. The Gemara answers <b>that</b> Rabbi Shimon does not disagree with the Rabbis concerning all cases of a wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist. If this <i>yavam</i> was <b>born</b> after his brother’s death, he concedes that the obligation of levirate marriage does not apply to the newborn <i>yavam</i>. Rather, the <i>yevama</i> is prohibited to him as his brother’s wife.",

            "In fact, Rabbi Shimon disagreed only with regard to a different case, when there were two brothers, one of whom died, and the second took the <i>yevama</i> in levirate marriage. If a third brother was subsequently born and afterward the second brother died, Rabbi Shimon maintains that the youngest brother may enter into levirate marriage with this woman because she was never forbidden to him, as what occurred prior to his birth is of no relevance. Since even in Rabbi Shimon’s opinion it is possible to find a case in which the wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist is forbidden to him, it can be claimed that the mishna is taught in accordance with all opinions.<br>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Oshaya say</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon disagreed even with regard to the first</b> case? In other words, Rabbi Shimon disagreed not only in the case of a woman who entered into levirate marriage before the young brother was born, but even if the young brother was born before the initial levirate marriage took place.",
            "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: This statement of <b>Rabbi Oshaya was conclusively refuted.</b> Consequently, it remains possible to say that the mishna does not deal with disputes.<br>The Gemara raises a difficulty from another angle. The third chapter discusses a case involving four brothers, two of whom passed away after they were married to two sisters. As a result, the two sisters simultaneously came before the surviving brothers for levirate marriage or <i>ḥalitza</i>. The Sages ruled that in this case the brothers may not enter into levirate marriage with the sisters, as it is as though the two sisters came before each brother individually, and due to the levirate bond each sister was, in a sense, considered married to each brother to a certain extent. <br>Consequently, for each brother the other sister is viewed as his wife’s sister, as it were, and is forbidden to him. Since this occurs to both sisters simultaneously, it is prohibited for both of them to enter into levirate marriage. However, the Sages further said that if one of these sisters was a forbidden relation to one of the surviving brothers, e.g., if he had married her daughter or some other relative, the second sister, to whom he is not a close relative, is permitted to him. If the same applies to the other brother and the second sister, the two brothers could perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with the two sisters or even enter into levirate marriage with them.",
            "With this in mind, the Gemara states its objection: <b>And didn’t Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Rav said, and likewise Rabbi Ḥiyya taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard <b>to all of those</b> fifteen women enumerated in the mishna, it is possible to find a scenario in which <b>I</b> would <b>call them: The</b> woman <b>who is forbidden to this</b> brother <b>is permitted to that</b> brother, <b>and the one who is forbidden to this</b> brother <b>is permitted to that</b> brother. <b>And</b> consequently, <b>her sister who is her sister-in-law performs <i>ḥalitza</i> or enters into levirate marriage.</b> This complex situation can be demonstrated with regard to each of the women enumerated in the mishna, e.g., if one sister is the mother-in-law of one brother, and the second sister is the mother-in-law of the second brother, and so on.",
            "<b>And Rav Yehuda explains</b> that this is not true of all of the women listed in the mishna. Only <b>from</b> the case of <b>his mother-in-law and onward,</b> until the end of the list, is it possible for one sister to be a forbidden relation to one brother and the other sister not to be forbidden at all. <b>However, in the first six cases, no,</b> this option does not apply. <b>What is the reason</b> for this?",
            "<b>Since,</b> for example, in the case of <b>one’s daughter,</b> although it is possible that one of the sisters is the daughter of one of the brothers, her mother is prohibited to all of the brothers as their brother’s wife, and therefore she could not possibly have a daughter from another brother. This case is possible only if one brother raped a woman who subsequently gave birth to his daughter. Since the prohibition with regard to a brother’s wife applies only in the case of marriage, this same woman is not forbidden to a different brother. If another brother came and raped her as well and she gave birth to his daughter too, and these two daughters later married two other brothers, each of these sisters who are sisters-in-law is forbidden to one of the brothers but permitted to the other.",
            "Accordingly, <b>in</b> the case of <b>rape you</b> can <b>find</b> this scenario, but <b>in</b> the case of <b>marriage you cannot find</b> it.

            "<b>And Abaye explains</b> differently, as he would include in this scenario <b>even his daughter from the woman he raped.</b> Why would he include this case? <b>Since you can find</b> this possibility, <b>if you wish it can be by rape, and if you wish it can be by marriage,</b> i.e., regardless of the details, this situation can occur. <b>However,</b> the last case, that of <b>a wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist,</b> he would <b>not</b> include. <b>What is the reason</b> for this?",
            "<b>Since it is</b> only <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon that you find this</b> potential scenario, as he permits a <i>yevama</i> to her <i>yavam</i> in a case where he was born after she first entered levirate marriage, it is therefore possible that one sister might be forbidden to one brother if he was born before his brother took her in levirate marriage. Likewise, another sister might be forbidden to another brother for the same reason, although the first woman would be permitted to him, as in his lifetime she was never the wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist. <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> however, <b>you cannot find this</b> scenario, and the mishna <b>does not deal with disputes</b> but only with those cases that are accepted by all opinions.",
            "<b>But Rav Safra explains</b> that the possibility of one brother permitted only to one woman and another brother likewise permitted only to one woman exists <b>even</b> in the case of <b>a wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist, and you</b> can <b>find this</b> scenario <b>in</b> a case involving <b>six brothers, and</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon.</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>And your mnemonic</b> to remember how this might occur is as follows: <b>Died, was born, entered into levirate marriage, died, was born, entered into levirate marriage.</b> In other words, there were several brothers, and one, Reuven, <b>died,</b> before another, Yissakhar, <b>was born, and</b> another brother, Shimon, <b>entered into levirate marriage</b> with the deceased’s wife, and there was another brother, Levi, who <b>died</b> as well, and yet another brother, Zevulun, <b>was born, and</b> a sixth brother, Yehuda, <b>entered into levirate marriage</b> with the deceased’s wife. In this case, if Shimon and Yehuda were to die childless, their wives would come before the surviving brothers, Yissakhar and Zevulun, for levirate marriage. To one of them, Yissakhar, the wife of the first brother, Reuven, is prohibited, and for the other brother, Zevulun, the wife of the second brother, Levi, is likewise prohibited. <br>This is an example of the type of case analyzed in the third chapter, in which the ruling is that the woman who is forbidden to this brother is permitted to that one, and she who is forbidden to this one is permitted to that one. In any case, Rabbi Ḥiyya incorporates the opinion of Rabbi Shimon into this principle, as he maintains that this scenario can apply to each case stated in the mishna. If so, the mishna evidently does deal with disputed legal rulings. How, then, can Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi claim that the cases of the mishna are unanimous?",
            "§ <b>Rather, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>does not hold</b> in accordance with <b>these general statements</b> applied by Rabbi Ḥiyya, and therefore he maintains that no issue subject to dispute was taught in the mishna. <b>Rav Adda Karḥina,</b> who was sitting <b>before Rav Kahana, said in the name of Rava: Actually,</b> one can explain that <b>Rabbi does hold</b> in accordance with <b>these general statements</b> laid out by Rabbi Ḥiyya. <b>And this is what</b> he <b>said</b> to Levi: In the case of <b>his mother</b> who had been <b>raped by his father, you find this</b> case <b>with</b> only <b>one</b> of the women; however, <b>you cannot find it with two.</b> In other words, the terms mentioned by Rabbi Ḥiyya above: She who is forbidden to this one is permitted to that one, and: A sister who is a sister-in-law performs either <i>ḥalitza</i> or levirate marriage, apply only partly to this complex case.",
            "The Gemara elaborates: <b>If Ya’akov,</b> the father, <b>raped two sisters</b> who gave birth to two sons, and he had two other sons who married these raped sisters and died, in this scenario <b>you find</b> a case of <b>her sister who is her sister-in-law,</b> as there is a <i>yevama</i> who comes before one of the brothers who is a forbidden relative and also a sister and a sister-in-law of another <i>yevama</i>. However, <b>you cannot find</b> the principle of: <b>She who is forbidden to this one is permitted to that one.</b> Although it is possible that one’s brother’s wife who is one’s mother might come before one for levirate marriage, just as he is forbidden to his mother, he is likewise forbidden to his mother’s sister.",
            "<b>And if</b> the father <b>raped two unrelated women,</b> who gave birth to two sons and then married two other sons of the same father who subsequently died, <b>you find</b> the case of: <b>She who is forbidden to this one is permitted to that one,</b> as each of the two raped women comes before one of the brothers for levirate marriage while she is forbidden to the other as his mother. However, <b>you do not find</b> a situation of: <b>Her sister who is her sister-in-law.</b> Therefore, the case of one’s mother who was raped by one’s father cannot be included in the list of the mishna, as the characteristics stated by Rabbi Ḥiyya do not apply to this case.",
            "§ <b>Rav Ashi stated</b> a different explanation: <b>Actually, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>does not hold</b> in accordance with <b>these general statements</b> of Rabbi Ḥiyya, <b>and</b> the mishna <b>does deal with</b> <i>halakhot</i> that are in <b>dispute.</b> According to his opinion, <b>what is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>It seems to me that he has no brain in his head, that</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to</b> Levi?",
            "According to Rav Ashi, <b>this is what</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said</b> to Levi: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>you were not precise</b> in your interpretation of <b>the mishna? As the mishna is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who prohibited</b> the case <b>of a woman</b> who was <b>raped by one’s father.</b> Accordingly, the rulings of the mishna cannot be attributed to any opinion that is not in line with that of Rabbi Yehuda. What is the proof that this mishna is indeed in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda?",
            "<b>As it teaches</b> in the next mishna: <b>Six</b> women <b>with whom relations are forbidden are more severe than these</b> enumerated in the previous mishna, <b>because they</b> may <b>marry</b> only <b>others</b> and can never be married to any of the brothers, and therefore <b>their rival wives are permitted.</b> These women include: <b>His mother, his father’s wife, and his father’s sister.</b> Rav Ashi infers: <b>What is</b> the meaning of: <b>His mother? If we say</b> that this mother is <b>married to his father,</b> then <b>this is the same</b> case as: <b>His father’s wife,</b> which would mean that the mishna lists only five cases, not six.",
            "<b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to <b>a woman raped by his father? And it is taught</b> in the mishna that the <i>halakhot</i> of levirate marriage do not apply to them <b>because they may marry</b> only <b>others,</b> which indicates: <b>Others, yes; the brothers, no.</b> Since each of the brothers are sons of the same father, each one is prohibited from marrying the mother of one of the other brothers, as although she is not his mother, she is nevertheless a woman raped by his father, whom one may not marry. <b>Who did you hear who holds</b> in accordance with <b>this conclusion</b> that a woman raped by one’s father is prohibited to all his sons? It is <b>Rabbi Yehuda who prohibits a woman raped by his father. Due to that</b> reason the case of a woman raped by one’s father <b>was not taught</b> in the first mishna.",
            "<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda you</b> can <b>find this</b> possibility that a woman raped by a father comes before the son for levirate marriage. <b>What if one</b> of the brothers <b>transgressed and married</b> a woman raped by his father? Even Rabbi Yehuda concedes that this is a violation of a regular prohibition that does not incur <i>karet</i>, and therefore the marriage is valid. Consequently, if this brother died childless, this woman would come before her son for levirate marriage. The Gemara rejects this proof: The <i>tanna</i> <b>does not teach</b> cases of <b>what if,</b> i.e., the mishna does not cite an example that could result only from a transgression.",
            "<b>Rav Ashi said to Rav Kahana: Even without</b> a hypothetical: <b>What if, you</b> can <b>find</b> an example of a woman raped by a father who is not forbidden to the son in marriage. How so? <b>Ya’akov,</b> the father, <b>raped his daughter-in-law, from whom he fathered a son. And</b> the son, <b>Reuven,</b> the husband of the daughter-in-law, <b>died childless. And</b> as Ya’akov had two sons, the deceased Reuven and a son by Reuven’s wife whom Ya’akov had raped, Reuven’s wife <b>would</b> then <b>come before her son</b> for levirate marriage. <b>And since she is forbidden, her rival wife is also forbidden.</b> Consequently, a case of this kind is possible without the levirate marriage resulting from an illicit marriage.",
            "Rav Kahana <b>said to</b> Rav Ashi: The mishna <b>deals with</b> cases of <b>legitimate brothers,</b> whereas <b>it does not deal with cases of illegitimate brothers.</b> The offspring of a man who rapes his daughter-in-law is a <i>mamzer</i>, and cases of this kind are not discussed in the mishna. The Gemara comments: <b>Nevertheless,</b> despite Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s criticism, <b>Levi established this</b> additional possibility of a woman raped by one’s father <b>in his <i>mishnayot</i>.</b>",
            "<b>As Levi taught</b> in his <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the case of <b>his mother, at times she exempts her rival wife, and at</b> other <b>times she does not exempt her rival wife</b>. <b>How so?</b> If <b>his mother was married to his father and</b> after his father’s death she illicitly <b>married</b> her son’s <b>paternal brother, who</b> then <b>died, this is</b> a case of: <b>His mother who does not exempt her rival wife.</b> The reason is that her marriage to his brother does not take effect at all, as it was forbidden on pain of <i>karet</i>. Since this marriage never occurred, only the other wife, the so-called rival wife, is considered a wife of the brother, and she may enter into levirate marriage."
        ],
        [
            "If, however, <b>his mother was a woman</b> who was <b>raped by his father and</b> subsequently <b>married his paternal brother, and</b> the brother <b>died, this is</b> a case of <b>his mother who exempts her rival wife.</b> According to the opinion of the Rabbis this marriage is permitted, and even according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda the marriage is valid despite the transgression. Consequently, both the mother and her rival wife come before the son for levirate marriage. Since the mother is a forbidden relation to him, her rival wife is exempt as well.",
            "<b>And although the Sages taught in the mishna: Fifteen</b> women, <b>we must add a sixteenth</b> case, <b>for example,</b> the situation described above. <b>Reish Lakish said to Rabbi Yoḥanan: According to</b> the opinion of <b>Levi, who said</b> that the mishna <b>teaches even</b> cases of: <b>What if,</b> which involve a transgression, <b>let</b> the mishna also <b>teach</b> the case of <b>one who performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with his <i>yevama</i> and went back and betrothed her, and</b> then <b>died childless.</b> His betrothal is a transgression, as after <i>ḥalitza</i> the <i>yevama</i> is permanently forbidden to him. <b>As,</b> in this case, <b>since she is forbidden</b> to all the brothers, due to the <i>ḥalitza</i> performed by the deceased <i>yavam</i>, <b>her rival wife is also forbidden.</b> This is an additional case of a woman who exempts her rival wife.",
            "Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to</b> Reish Lakish: This example is not cited <b>because</b> the case <b>does not</b> include the possibility <b>of a rival wife of a rival wife.</b> All of the other cases listed in the mishna involve both rival wives and rival wives of rival wives. Here, however, this is impossible, as the same prohibition applies equally to all of the brothers, and therefore none of them may marry her.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And let</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>say</b> a different answer <b>to</b> Reish Lakish, as he could simply have pointed out that marriage to a woman who had performed <i>ḥalitza</i> is not a violation that incurs <i>karet</i>, neither for the one who performed the <i>ḥalitza</i> nor for his brothers if they marry her after he dies. Rather, <b>it is</b> an act for which they are <b>liable for</b> violating a regular <b>prohibition, and those liable for</b> violating <b>a prohibition are</b> obligated <b>in <i>ḥalitza</i> and levirate marriage.</b> In these cases the mitzva of levirate marriage still applies, and although the woman should be released by <i>ḥalitza</i>, she is not entirely exempt from levirate marriage, and therefore her rival wife is not exempt either.",
            "The Gemara responds that Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>is speaking in accordance with the statement of</b> Reish Lakish, as follows: According <b>to my</b> opinion your question is groundless, as <b>they are liable for</b> violating <b>a prohibition, and those liable for</b> violating <b>a prohibition are</b> obligated <b>in <i>ḥalitza</i> and levirate marriage. However,</b> according <b>to your</b> opinion, <b>those</b> brothers who marry a <i>yevama</i> who had performed <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>are liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i>,</b> and therefore you must resolve the difficulty by saying that the mishna did not teach this case <b>because</b> it <b>does not</b> include the possibility <b>of a rival wife of a rival wife.</b>",
            "The Gemara discusses the dispute alluded to in the previous paragraph. <b>It was stated:</b> With regard to <b>one who performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with his <i>yevama</i> and went back and betrothed her, Reish Lakish said:</b> The brother who earlier performed <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>is not liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> returning to <b>the <i>yevama</i> who performed <i>ḥalitza</i> [<i>ḥalutza</i>].</b> She is no longer forbidden as a brother’s wife, although she is forbidden by a regular prohibition.",
            "<b>And the brothers</b> who did not actually perform the <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>are liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> having relations with <b>a <i>ḥalutza</i>.</b> In their case, the woman retains her status as a forbidden brother’s wife even after the <i>ḥalitza</i>. <b>With regard to the rival wife</b> of the <i>ḥalutza</i>, although she too is released from the levirate bond, since the act of <i>ḥalitza</i> itself was not performed with her, <b>both</b> the brother who performed the <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>and the</b> other <b>brothers are liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> having relations with <b>the rival wife,</b> as she retains her forbidden status as a brother’s wife.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Neither he nor the</b> other <b>brothers are liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i>, neither for the <i>ḥalutza</i> nor for</b> having relations with <b>the rival wife.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>What is the rationale of Reish Lakish? The verse states</b> with regard to one who performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with his <i>yevama</i>: <b>“Who does not build up</b> his brother’s house” (Deuteronomy 25:9), which teaches that <b>since he did not build</b> his brother’s house by entering into levirate marriage, opting instead for <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>he shall never build</b> it <b>again.</b> This statement is understood not only as a negative description of events, but also as a prohibition against marrying this woman at any point in the future.",
            "However, <b>it is</b> the man who performed the act of <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>who stands</b> liable <b>to</b> receive punishment for violating this prohibition of: <b>Does not build up,</b> i.e., the prohibition against marrying his <i>ḥalutza</i>. For him the prohibition involving <i>karet</i> has been replaced by the regular prohibition of: Who does not build up his brother’s house. <b>However,</b> with regard to his <b>brothers, where they stood</b> before, <b>they stand</b> now. In other words, just as before the mitzva of levirate marriage applied to them this woman was forbidden to them as a brother’s wife, once the obligation of levirate marriage has been removed they remain bound by the same prohibition. Consequently, she is forbidden to the brothers on pain of <i>karet</i>.",
            "<b>And</b> furthermore, only <b>with regard to her,</b> the <i>ḥalutza</i>, <b>does he stand</b> liable <b>for: Does not build up,</b> but as for <b>the rival wife,</b> who did not perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>where</b> all the brothers <b>stood</b> before, <b>they stand</b> now. Just as before her rival wife performed <i>ḥalitza</i> she was forbidden on pain of <i>karet</i>, the same applies after the <i>ḥalitza</i>, both for the man who performed <i>ḥalitza</i> and his brothers.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> claims: <b>Is there anything</b> of this kind in <i>halakha</i>? After all, <b>at the outset,</b> before the <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>if this</b> brother <b>wanted</b> he could <b>perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, and if that</b> brother <b>wanted</b> he could <b>perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, and if he wanted</b> he could <b>perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with this</b> woman <b>and if he wanted</b> he could <b>perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with that</b> woman. All the deceased brother’s wives were included in the levirate obligation of marriage or <i>ḥalitza</i>, and therefore the prohibition proscribing a brother’s wife was negated for all of them at that time. <b>And now,</b> after the <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>they stand to</b> incur <b><i>karet</i> for</b> having relations with <b>her?</b> How can the prohibition proscribing a brother’s wife return after it was nullified by the death of the childless brother?",
            "<b>Rather, he</b> who performs <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>performs the agency of the</b> other <b>brothers,</b> and therefore he also releases her from the levirate bond of his brothers. Similarly, <b>she</b> who performs <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>performs the agency of the rival wife,</b> as the <i>ḥalitza</i> of one wife serves to release the other one as well. Consequently, it is as though all of the brothers released all of the wives, and there is no longer any prohibition that incurs <i>karet</i>.",
            "§ The Gemara cites the ensuing discussion between the two disputing Sages. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with his <i>yevama</i> and went back and betrothed her, and</b> then <b>died, she requires <i>ḥalitza</i> from</b> one of <b>the brothers. Granted,</b> this makes sense according <b>to my</b> opinion, <b>as I say</b> that brothers who marry a <i>ḥalutza</i> <b>are liable</b> only <b>for</b> violating <b>a prohibition,</b> and <b>that is</b> why <b>she requires <i>ḥalitza</i> from the</b> other <b>brothers.</b> The principle is that a woman with whom relations are forbidden by a regular prohibition that does not incur <i>karet</i> may not enter into levirate marriage, but she must undergo <i>ḥalitza</i>.",
            "<b>However,</b> according <b>to your</b> opinion that the penalty of <i>karet</i> does apply here, <b>why does she require <i>ḥalitza</i></b> at all? The penalty of <i>karet</i> indicates that the betrothal did not take effect at all, and therefore she is not bound to the brothers with regard to the requirement of <i>ḥalitza</i>.",
            "Reish Lakish answered: <b>And according to your reasoning,</b> how would you <b>state</b> and explain <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one of the brothers arose and betrothed her, she has no claims on him,</b> i.e., the marriage does not take effect at all and she does not require a bill of divorce from him? <b>But if</b> the brothers <b>are liable</b> only <b>for</b> violating <b>a prohibition, why does she have no claim on him?</b> After all, in cases of regular prohibitions a betrothal is valid. According to my opinion that these brothers are liable to receive <i>karet</i> the matter is clear, as the betrothal is invalid. This indicates that there is a contradiction between the first and latter clauses of the <i>baraita</i>. How, then, can Rabbi Yoḥanan cite a proof from an apparently flawed <i>baraita</i>?",
            "<b>Rav Sheshet said</b> in resolution of this contradiction: In the <b>latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>we have come to</b> a different opinion, that of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who said: Betrothal with those</b> who are forbidden as they are <b>liable for</b> violating <b>a prohibition is not valid.</b> In Rabbi Akiva’s opinion there is no difference between regular prohibitions and prohibitions that incur <i>karet</i> in this regard, as in both cases the betrothals are invalid. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> if the first clause of the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, while the latter clause is in accordance with a different opinion, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> explicitly: <b>According to the statement of Rabbi Akiva she has no claims on him,</b> as this represents a different opinion."

            "§ The Gemara comments: Rav Sheshet’s explanation of the contradiction between the first clause and latter clause of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is difficult.</b> Consequently, the Gemara cites different resolutions of this contradiction. <b>Rav Ashi holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish and resolves</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.

            "The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rav Ashi holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish and resolves</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b> This is his interpretation: In the case of <b>one who performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with his <i>yevama</i> and went back and betrothed her,</b> and then died, <b>she requires <i>ḥalitza</i> from</b> one of <b>the brothers.

            "Meanwhile, the latter clause speaks of a case where <b>one of the</b> brothers who was <b>born</b> in the lifetime of the first brother <b>arose and betrothed her,</b> after another brother had performed <i>ḥalitza</i>.

Any mitzva formulated as a positive injunction has the status of a positive mitzva, even if it is violated by the performance of an action, in the manner of a prohibition.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>The one who said that he</b> is liable <b>to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i></b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish,</b> who maintains that after the mitzva is performed with one <i>yevama</i> who required levirate marriage, the prohibition of a brother’s wife is once again fully applicable to her rival wife. <b>And the one who said</b> that he is in violation <b>of</b> only <b>a positive mitzva</b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b>",
            "The Gemara further analyzes the list of women exempt from levirate marriage. <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: The rival wife of a <i>sota</i> is forbidden.</b> In this context, <i>sota</i> refers to an unfaithful wife. If the husband died, the unfaithful wife and her rival wife are exempt from both <i>ḥalitza</i> and levirate marriage.",
            "What is the reason for this? The term <b>defilement is written in that</b> passage dealing with an unfaithful wife: “She being defiled secretly” (Numbers 5:13), just <b>as</b> defilement is written with regard to <b>those with whom relations are forbidden</b> in the verse: “Defile not yourselves in any of these things, for in all these the nations are defiled, which I cast out from before you” (Leviticus 18:24). This teaches that the <i>halakha</i> of an unfaithful wife is like that of a woman with whom relations are forbidden; both she and her rival wife are exempt from levirate marriage and <i>ḥalitza</i>.",
            "<b>Rav Ḥisda raised an objection</b> to this from the case of a woman who heard that her husband had died and remarried, only afterward to discover that he had still been alive at that time before dying later. What is the <i>halakha</i> in this case? <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Her relations</b> with <b>or <i>ḥalitza</i> from the brother of the first</b> husband <b>exempts her rival wife.</b> This shows that the obligation of levirate marriage applies to this woman. Although she lived as a married woman with someone else during her husband’s lifetime, Rabbi Shimon nevertheless maintains that her sexual intercourse or <i>ḥalitza</i> fulfills the mitzva of levirate marriage and exempts her rival wife. This suggests that the rival wife of an unfaithful wife requires levirate marriage.",
            "The Gemara answers that <b>Rav</b> could have <b>said to you</b> in response: <b>I spoke to you</b> about the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a <i>sota</i> by Torah</b> law, i.e., a wife who was intentionally unfaithful, <b>and you speak to me</b> of <b>a <i>sota</i> by rabbinic</b> law? The case you mentioned is an unavoidable accident, as the wife married another man only because she received testimony that her husband was deceased. When the Sages instituted that she was forbidden to both her first and second husbands, this was a penalty designed to ensure that women would examine testimony of this kind very thoroughly. However, this is not a case of a <i>sota</i> by Torah law, as she was not intentionally unfaithful, and therefore the mitzva of levirate marriage certainly applies to her.",
            "Since this response is overwhelmingly obvious, the Gemara asks: <b>And he who asked it, why did he ask it?</b> There are apparently no grounds for this comparison at all. The Gemara explains: <b>He held that all</b> ordinances <b>that the Sages instituted, they instituted parallel to Torah</b> law. Consequently, if a <i>sota</i> by Torah law is exempt from levirate marriage and exempts her rival wife as though she were a forbidden relative, the same should apply to a <i>sota</i> by rabbinic law.",
            "<b>Rav Ashi raised an objection</b> to Rav’s opinion from a different source: The <i>halakha</i> is that a wife who was warned by her husband not to be secluded with a specific man and yet <b>entered</b> alone <b>with him in private, and remained with him</b> long enough <b>to be defiled,</b> i.e., sufficient time to have sexual relations, she <b>is forbidden to her house,</b> i.e., her husband, from that moment until she undergoes the <i>sota</i> ritual. <b>And</b> likewise, if she was the wife of a priest <b>she is prohibited from partaking of <i>teruma</i>,</b> as she was possibly disqualified by unfaithfulness. <b>And if he dies, she performs <i>ḥalitza</i></b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>and may not enter into levirate marriage.</b> This indicates that the levirate bond does apply to a <i>sota</i>, which contradicts Rav’s statement. The Gemara retorts that <b>Rav</b> could have <b>said to you: I spoke to you</b> about <b>a <i>sota</i></b> whose infidelity was <b>definite, and you speak to me</b> of <b>an uncertain <i>sota</i>.</b> There is no proof that this wife who secluded herself with another man was actually unfaithful, and due to the uncertainty she must still undergo <i>ḥalitza</i>. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>And what is different</b> about <b>a definite <i>sota</i>?</b> Is it different <b>because</b> the term <b>defilement is written</b> with regard <b>to her?</b>",

However, if he remarried her <b>following</b> mere <b>betrothal</b> to another man, <b>she is permitted, because it is stated:</b> “Her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, <b>after she was defiled”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:4), and a woman who was merely betrothed was never defiled, as no sexual relations had taken place.",
            "<b>And the Rabbis say:</b> Both <b>this one and that one,</b> i.e., whether she had been fully married or merely betrothed to another, <b>she is forbidden</b> to her first husband. <b>Rather, how do I establish</b> the phrase: <b>“After she was defiled”?</b> This verse does not refer at all to the case of a woman who married another man lawfully, as she is not called “defiled.” Rather, it comes <b>to include a <i>sota</i> who secluded herself</b> with another man, as she is forbidden to her husband due to the concern that she might have committed adultery. This <i>baraita</i> shows that a <i>sota</i> is termed “defiled,” despite the fact that hers is an uncertain case.",
            "The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>And what does: Secluded herself,</b> mean in this context? It means that she had actually <b>engaged in relations. And why</b> does the <i>baraita</i> <b>call this: Secluded herself,</b> instead of the more straightforward: Engaged in sexual relations? The <i>baraita</i> <b>employed a euphemistic expression,</b> but it actually means that she engaged in intercourse. The Gemara asks: If this is referring to a woman who had <b>engaged in relations,</b> the term <b>defilement</b> is already <b>explicitly written</b> with regard <b>to her,</b> in the chapter that deals with a <i>sota</i>. Why is it necessary to derive that she is defiled from a different source, as in the context of a <i>sota</i> herself the verse states: <b>“She being defiled secretly”</b> (Numbers 5:13)?",
            "The Gemara explains that “may not take her again to be his wife after she was defiled” does not teach that she is called “defiled,” but rather that the <i>halakha</i> <b>establishes upon her a prohibition.</b> In other words, if the husband engages in relations with his wife after she had had intercourse with another, he transgresses a prohibition. <b>And</b> the Gemara comments that <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Keifar does not hold</b> the opinion that there is <b>a prohibition</b> in the case <b>of a <i>sota</i>,</b> as he maintains that a husband who has relations with his <i>sota</i> wife does not transgress any prohibition at all, <b>and the same</b> is true <b>even if she</b> definitely <b>fornicated</b> with another man.",
            "<b>What is the rationale</b> of Rabbi Yosei ben Keifar? In his opinion, “after she was defiled” does not refer to a <i>sota</i> but to a woman who had been legally divorced from her first husband and subsequently married another man. This is indicated by the fact that both <b>becoming,</b> i.e., betrothal, <b>and matrimony are written in this</b> context: “Becomes another man’s wife” (Deuteronomy 24:2) and: “Or if the latter husband die, who took her to be his wife” (Deuteronomy 24:3). Here it is clear that the reference is to halakhically valid marriage, whereas a <i>sota</i> had never been another man’s wife, as she cannot marry another man while she is still married.",
            "§ The Gemara discusses a similar case. <b>Rav Yehuda raised a dilemma before Rav Sheshet:</b> In the case of <b>one who remarries his divorcée after she had married</b> another, <b>and</b> then he <b>dies</b> childless, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the levirate marriage of <b>her rival wife? According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Keifar, do not raise the dilemma, since Rabbi Yosei ben Keifar said</b> that <b>it is</b> with regard <b>to one who remarries his divorcée</b> that <b>defilement is written,</b> and therefore the status of <b>her rival wife is the same as hers.</b>",
            "<b>And if</b> one would claim that the dilemma does in fact arise <b>because it is written: “That is an abomination”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:4), and the emphasis on “that” serves to limit the range of the prohibition and teaches that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to her and not her rival wife, still, the accepted interpretation of this verse is as follows: <b>She is an abomination, but her children are not abominations.</b> In other words, if he transgressed the prohibition and remarried this woman, their children are not disqualified from marrying priests. If so, the term “that” does not come to exclude her rival wife from this <i>halakha</i>, and therefore <b>her rival wife is an abomination</b> for the purposes of levirate marriage, just like the wife herself, and she too is exempt.",
            "Rather, <b>let the dilemma be raised according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. Although the Rabbis said</b> that <b>it is</b> with regard <b>to a <i>sota</i> that defilement is written,</b> perhaps here they apply the principle that <b>a verse does not depart from its literal meaning.</b> In other words, notwithstanding the fact that the Rabbis derive from here a halakhic ruling concerning a <i>sota</i>, the straightforward meaning of the verse should not be entirely disregarded. Accordingly, as the context here is remarriage to one’s divorced wife, this verse would teach that hers is a case of defilement.",
            "<b>Or perhaps once</b> a verse <b>is uprooted</b> from its context, <b>it is</b> entirely <b>uprooted</b> and no longer teaches anything about the subject matter of the chapter in which it is written. This would mean that the sole significance of this particular verse is in reference to a <i>sota</i>. <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> the opposite: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, do not raise the dilemma,</b> as <b>once</b> a verse <b>is uprooted</b> from its context, <b>it is</b> entirely <b>uprooted.</b> Consequently, there is no defilement when a man remarries his divorcée, neither with regard to her nor concerning her rival wife.",
            "Rather, <b>let the dilemma be raised according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Keifar. What is</b> the dilemma? <b>Although Rabbi Yosei ben Keifar said</b> that <b>it is</b> with regard <b>to one who remarries his divorcée</b> that <b>defilement is written,</b> one can ask: Does <b>the Merciful One limit</b> this <i>halakha</i> by the phrase <b>“that is an abomination,”</b> which indicates: <b>And her rival wife is not an abomination? Or perhaps</b> this verse teaches that <b>she is an abomination but her children are not abominations,</b> which indicates that <b>her rival wife is an abomination.</b>",
            "Rav Sheshet <b>said to him: You learned it</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that deals with a case of two <i>yevamot</i> who came before a <i>yavam</i> for levirate marriage.

            "Rav Sheshet analyzes this <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>fit, and what is</b> the meaning of <b>disqualified?

            "<b>Rather, is it not</b> the case that <b>fit</b> means <b>fit for him,</b> and <b>disqualified</b> means <b>disqualified for him?

            "<b>As Rav Yosef said: Here Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>taught</b> a valuable moral lesson, that <b>a person should not pour the water from his well when others are in need of it.</b> That is, one should not cause loss in any situation, even when this relates to his own personal life, if he might thereby cause a future loss to others. The same reasoning applies here: If he intends to perform <i>ḥalitza</i> it does not matter to him which of the women he chooses, but if he does so with the one who is fit to others, he thereby disqualifies her from marrying a priest, as the legal status of a woman who underwent <i>ḥalitza</i> is like that of a divorcée. It is therefore preferable to perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with the one who in any case was disqualified from marrying a priest.",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a different <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who remarries his divorcée after she had married another, she and her rival wife perform <i>ḥalitza</i>.</b> The Gemara first analyzes the wording of the <i>baraita</i>: Can it <b>enter your mind</b> that both <b>she and her rival wife</b> must perform <i>ḥalitza</i>? After all, only one wife of a deceased brother undergoes <i>ḥalitza</i>, not two. <b>Rather, say: Either she or her rival wife.</b> This indicates that both women are unfit for levirate marriage.",
            "The Gemara rejects this claim: <b>And did you not</b> already <b>resolve</b> a difficulty <b>in</b> the <i>baraita</i> by adjusting its language and not interpreting it as it is?

            "§ The Gemara cites another discussion concerning women who are forbidden in levirate marriage. <b>Rav Lili bar Memel said</b> that <b>Mar Ukva said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The <b>rival wife of</b> a girl <b>who performed refusal is forbidden.</b> If the deceased brother had two wives, one of whom was a minor who refused the brother who sought to be her <i>yavam</i>, not only is she forbidden in levirate marriage, but so too is her rival wife. The Gemara asks: <b>To whom</b> is she forbidden? <b>If we say</b> that she is forbidden <b>to</b> the other <b>brothers,</b> this cannot be the case, as <b>now</b> that <b>she herself,</b> the girl who actually performed refusal, <b>is permitted</b> to them, <b>as Shmuel said:</b> A minor <i>yevama</i> who <b>refused this</b> brother <b>is permitted to that</b> other brother of the deceased husband, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to state that <b>her rival wife</b> is likewise permitted?",
            "<b>Rather,</b> it means that she is forbidden <b>to him,</b> i.e., as she refused a specific brother, both she and her rival wife are forbidden to him. The Gemara clarifies: <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this <i>halakha</i> of the rival wife <b>different from</b> that of <b>one who performed refusal, who is permitted to the</b> other <b>brothers?</b> If the reason is <b>that she did not perform any act</b> of refusal <b>with them</b> that might nullify the obligation of levirate marriage, <b>her rival wife did not perform any act with them either,</b> and therefore she should be permitted to all of the brothers.",
            "The Gemara answers: This is a rabbinic <b>decree</b> imposed <b>due to</b> the case of <b>a rival wife of one’s daughter who performed refusal.</b> If the girl who refused was his daughter or any other forbidden relative, her rival wife would be forbidden as the rival wife of one’s daughter. Therefore, the Sages rendered forbidden the rival wives of other women who performed refusal, not only his daughter. The Gemara asks: <b>And is the rival wife of a daughter who performed refusal</b> actually <b>forbidden? But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all of these</b> women, <b>if they died or performed refusal</b> with their husbands, <b>their rival wives are permitted.</b>",
            "The Gemara analyzes this statement: <b>Whom did</b> this girl <b>refuse? If we say that she refused the husband,</b> i.e., the deceased brother before he passed away, <b>this is</b> exactly the same as the case of <b>a divorcée,</b> and the mishna explicitly states that if one’s relative who had been married to his deceased brother died, or refused her husband, or was divorced, no prohibition applies to her rival wife. What is the difference between refusal and divorce? <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to a case where she refused <b>the <i>yavam</i>?</b> If she refuses the <i>yavam</i>, her levirate bond is broken and her rival wife is no longer considered the rival wife of a forbidden relative. Consequently, the rival wife is fit for levirate marriage. This shows that no prohibition applies to the rival wife of a daughter who performed refusal.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>No; actually,</b> it means <b>that</b> she refused <b>the husband, and two types of divorce</b> are listed in the mishna: Divorce by Torah law and refusal, which is a form of divorce that applies by rabbinic law. The Gemara asks: <b>And what is different</b> between the two cases? Since refusal is not actually divorce but is a form of annulment that nullifies the matrimonial bond retroactively, <b>when she refuses her husband</b> it must be said <b>that she uproots the marriage,</b> and therefore the rival wife is rendered permitted.",
            "If so, <b>when she refuses the <i>yavam</i>,</b> one should <b>also</b> say that <b>she uproots the first marriage.</b> The reasoning is that she cannot actually refuse the <i>yavam</i>, as she was never married to him. Rather, it must be that she annuls her first marriage, and the bond with the <i>yavam</i> is canceled automatically. Consequently, it is as though she were not married at all, and there was never a rival wife.",
            "The Gemara explains that Shmuel’s reasoning is <b>due to</b> the statement <b>that Rami bar Yeḥezkel taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>as Rami bar Yeḥezkel taught:</b> If a minor <b>refused her husband, she is permitted</b> in marriage even <b>to his father,</b> as refusal completely nullifies the marriage, and it is as though there had never been any earlier marriage with the son. However, if she refused <b>the <i>yavam</i>,</b> not her husband, <b>she is forbidden to his father.</b>",
            "<b>Apparently, from</b> the moment <b>when she came before</b> the <i>yavam</i> for levirate marriage <b>she appears to be</b> his father’s <b>daughter-in-law.</b> Since at the time of the husband’s death she had not yet performed refusal, to all appearances she was the father’s daughter-in-law. Consequently, although the marriage of this minor was not valid by Torah law, any observer would have assumed it was a proper marriage. Therefore, the Sages rendered a girl who refused her <i>yavam</i> forbidden to his father, so that people not take lightly the prohibition of those with whom relations are forbidden.",
            "<b>Here, too,</b> the same reasoning applies: <b>From</b> the moment <b>when</b> the other wife <b>came before</b> the <i>yavam</i> for levirate marriage <b>she appears to be the rival wife of</b> his father’s <b>daughter.</b> For this reason she is forbidden, despite the fact that she is permitted by Torah law. Shmuel’s ruling that the rival wife of a girl who performed refusal is forbidden is therefore a decree due to the case of the rival wife of a daughter who performed refusal.",
            "§ The Gemara continues to discuss various cases of forbidden women. <b>Rav Asi said: The rival wife of a sexually underdeveloped woman [<i>aylonit</i>] is forbidden.</b> In other words, if one of the wives of the deceased brother was an <i>aylonit</i>, who is incapable of giving birth, the mitzva of levirate marriage does not apply. <b>As it is stated</b> with regard to a woman who requires levirate marriage: <b>“The firstborn that she bears”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:6), which comes <b>to exclude an <i>aylonit</i>, who cannot give birth.</b> Since the <i>halakhot</i> of levirate marriage do not apply to an <i>aylonit</i>, she retains her status as a brother’s wife who is forbidden, and therefore her rival wife is also exempt from levirate marriage.",
            "<b>Rav Sheshet raised an objection</b> to this from a mishna: <b>Three brothers are married to three unrelated women, and one of</b> the brothers <b>died, and a second</b> brother <b>performed levirate betrothal with</b> the <i>yevama</i>. A levirate betrothal does not have the legal status of a regular betrothal, as the levirate bond between <i>yavam</i> and <i>yevama</i> is not dependent upon betrothal; rather, it represents a kind of continuation of the previous marriage with her deceased husband. Full marriage with a <i>yevama</i> is effected by sexual intercourse alone. However, for reasons of modesty, the Sages instituted that the act of betrothal should apply to a <i>yevama</i> as well.",
            "<b>And</b> this brother who performed the levirate betrothal <b>died</b> before consummation of the marriage. In this case, both of <b>these,</b> the wife of the first brother, who had already come before the second brother for levirate marriage, and the wife of the second brother, <b>perform <i>ḥalitza</i> and may not enter into levirate marriage. As it is stated: “And one of them dies</b> and he has no child, the wife of the dead man shall not be married outside of the family to one not of his kin; <b>her brother-in-law will have intercourse with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5). This implies that the option of levirate marriage applies only to <b>one who is subject to</b> the levirate <b>bond of one <i>yavam</i>,</b> for only one deceased brother, <b>and not</b> the <b>bond of two <i>yevamin</i>.</b> Since it is considered as though the first widow has two levirate duties to fulfill, neither she nor her rival wife may enter into levirate marriage.",
            "<b>And it is taught with regard to this</b> issue that <b>Rav Yosef said: This is</b> an example of <b>a rival wife of a paternal</b> half <b>brother’s wife,</b> i.e., a fully fit <i>yevama</i>, <b>for whom coming before</b> the <i>yavam</i> for levirate marriage <b>caused her to be forbidden.</b> In other words, she was fully fit for levirate marriage by Torah law, as all conditions of the mitzva are present in her case. The reason for her prohibition has nothing to do with her particular status but is the result of her having come before a <i>yavam</i> for levirate marriage once already. <b>We have not found in the entire Torah an example</b> like <b>this,</b> where the fact that she was obligated in a mitzva she was unable to fulfill means that not only she, but her rival wife as well, are both rendered forbidden.",
            "The Gemara analyzes Rav Yosef’s statement: The emphasis of: <b>This is,</b> which indicates that it applies to this case and no other, comes <b>to exclude what? Doesn’t</b> it come <b>to exclude the rival wife of an <i>aylonit</i>,</b> which would mean <b>that</b> she <b>is permitted?</b> Although an <i>aylonit</i> herself may marry any man, she is not suitable for levirate marriage. If so, Rav Yosef’s comment indicates that only a woman subject to a double levirate bond, not any other case, renders her rival wife forbidden merely by coming before the <i>yavam</i> for levirate marriage.",
            "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No,</b> Rav Yosef’s statement was meant <b>to exclude the rival wife of an <i>aylonit</i>, that</b> she <b>is forbidden. And what is</b> the meaning of: <b>This is?</b> It means that <b>this is the one for whom coming before</b> the <i>yavam</i> for levirate marriage <b>caused her to be forbidden,</b> and therefore <b>her rival wife requires <i>ḥalitza</i></b> and is not entirely exempt. In contrast, in the case of the rival wife of an <b><i>aylonit</i>,</b> she does <b>not even require <i>ḥalitza</i>. What is the reason</b> for this difference between the two cases? <b>This</b> one, an <i>aylonit</i>, is exempt from levirate marriage <b>by Torah</b> law, while <b>this one,</b> who was betrothed by levirate betrothal to the other brother, is forbidden <b>by rabbinic</b> law, and she therefore must perform <i>ḥalitza</i>.",
            "§ The Gemara cites another relevant source. <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all of these</b> women with whom relations are forbidden, <b>if they died, or they refused</b> their husbands, <b>or were divorced, or were found to be <i>aylonit</i>, their rival wives are permitted</b> in levirate marriage. This ruling apparently contradicts the statement of Rav Asi that the rival wife of an <i>aylonit</i> is forbidden. The Gemara responds: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> Rav Asi is referring to a situation in <b>which</b> her husband <b>knew</b> that <b>she</b> was an <i>aylonit</i> prior to marriage, and as he married her regardless of her condition their marriage is fully valid. Since the mitzva of levirate marriage does not apply to her because she cannot give birth, her rival wife is also exempt.",
            "<b>There,</b> in the mishna, it is referring to a case <b>where he did not know</b> that <b>she</b> was an <i>aylonit</i> at the time of marriage, but only at a later stage. Since in this case it can be said that he would not choose to marry an <i>aylonit</i>, hers was a mistaken betrothal, and it is therefore nullified. Consequently, her rival wife is permitted.",
            "The Gemara comments: The language of the mishna <b>is also precise, as it teaches: Were found to be</b> an <i>aylonit</i>, <b>and it does not teach: Were</b> an <i>aylonit</i>. This indicates that her condition was not known to the husband at the time of marriage but was discovered by him only later. The Gemara summarizes: <b>Conclude from this</b> that this is the correct interpretation of the mishna. Consequently, the mishna does not contradict the opinion of Rav Asi. <b>Rava said:</b>"

        [
            "<b>And</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> is</b> that the <b>rival wife of an <i>aylonit</i> is permitted, and</b> this is the case <b>even if</b> her first husband <b>knew</b> of <b>her</b> status and her marriage was fully valid.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>that which</b> the mishna <b>teaches: Were found to be,</b> from which it was inferred that there is a difference between an <i>aylonit</i> whose condition was known by the husband beforehand and one who was recognized by him only later, how is this to be explained? The Gemara answers that one should emend this and <b>teach</b> simply: <b>That were,</b> and not: Were found to be. <b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael <b>he said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> There is <b>one</b> <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>rival wife of a girl who refused</b> her husband, and <b>the rival wife of an <i>aylonit</i>, and also</b> the <b>rival wife of one who remarries his divorcée: They are all permitted.</b>",
            "§ Incidental to the case of refusal, the Gemara cites a related <i>halakha</i>. <b>Rav Beivai taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Naḥman: Three women</b> may <b>engage in relations with</b> a contraceptive <b>resorbent,</b> a soft fabric placed at the entrance to their wombs to prevent conception, despite the fact that this practice is generally prohibited. They are as follows: <b>A minor,</b> a woman who is already <b>pregnant, and a nursing woman.</b> The <i>baraita</i> specifies the reason for each exception: <b>A minor</b> may do so <b>lest she become pregnant and perhaps die; a pregnant woman, lest</b> she be impregnated a second time and <b>her</b> previous <b>fetus becomes</b> deformed into the shape of <b>a sandal</b> fish by being squashed by the pressure of the second fetus. As for <b>a nursing woman,</b> she does so <b>lest</b> she become pregnant and her milk dry up, in which case <b>she will wean her son</b> too early, thereby endangering him, <b>and he will die.</b>",
            "<b>And</b> the <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Who is</b> considered <b>a minor?</b> It is a girl <b>from the age of eleven years and one day until</b> the age of <b>twelve years and one day.</b> If she was <b>younger than this or older than this, she may go ahead and engage in relations in her usual manner.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> Since it is assumed that a minor who is less than eleven years old cannot become pregnant, she is considered to be in no danger. <b>And the Rabbis say: Both this</b> one <b>and that</b> one, i.e., in all these cases, she <b>may go ahead and engage in relations in her usual manner, and Heaven will have mercy</b> upon her and prevent any mishap, <b>since it is stated: “The Lord preserves the simple”</b> (Psalms 116:2).",
            "The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>From</b> the fact that the <i>baraita</i> <b>states: Lest she become pregnant and perhaps die,</b> this indicates <b>by inference that there is a minor who can become pregnant and will not die,</b> although the conditions for this scenario of a minor giving birth and surviving are unclear. <b>If so,</b> that a minor might be impregnated and give birth, <b>we find</b> the case of <b>one’s mother-in-law who refused</b> her husband. Since it is possible for a woman to give birth to a daughter while still a minor, if a man betroths this daughter while still an infant, the mother might be a mother-in-law who performed refusal.",
            "<b>And</b> yet <b>we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>You cannot say,</b> i.e., the possibility does not exist, in the case <b>of his mother-in-law, his mother-in-law’s mother, and his father-in-law’s mother, that they were found to be an <i>aylonit</i> or performed refusal,</b> as refusal may be performed only by a minor, who cannot give birth. If so, there is apparently a contradiction between the mishna and the <i>baraita</i>. The Gemara answers: Do not say: Lest she become pregnant and perhaps die, which indicates that it is possible for her not to die from the impregnation. Rather, <b>say: Lest she become pregnant and die.</b> In other words, although it is uncertain whether she will be impregnated, if she does become pregnant she will certainly die, which means that there is no case in which a minor could give birth and live.",
            "<b>As Rabba bar Livai said: There is a limit with regard to her</b> pregnancy, i.e., that of a young girl. <b>Before this time,</b> the age of eleven, <b>she cannot be impregnated at all. During this time,</b> from age eleven to twelve, <b>she dies and her fetus dies. After this time,</b> from twelve onward, <b>she lives and her fetus lives.</b>",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rabba bar Shmuel teach: You cannot say</b> in the case <b>of his mother-in-law, and his mother-in-law’s mother, and his father-in-law’s mother that they were found to be an <i>aylonit</i> or performed refusal, as they already gave birth.</b> This indicates that a minor can give birth, as otherwise he should have stated: As they are already mature. <b>Rather, actually,</b> the original version of the <i>baraita</i> is correct: <b>Lest she become pregnant and perhaps die. But this</b> is <b>difficult</b> with regard to the mishna, which indicates that this scenario is impossible.",
            "<b>Rav Safra said: Children are equivalent to signs</b> of puberty. In other words, a girl who gives birth does not retain the legal status of a minor, as the very fact that she bore children is equivalent to a physical sign of maturity, usually in the form of pubic hairs. <b>And some say: Children are preferable to signs</b> of puberty. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the practical difference</b> that arises from the question of whether bearing children is equivalent or preferable to signs of maturity? The Gemara answers: The difference is <b>that even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who said</b> that a minor may perform refusal even after she develops two pubic hairs, <b>until the black</b> hairs of her genitals <b>are more plentiful</b> than the hairless skin, in the case <b>of children he concedes</b> that she is considered mature and may not perform refusal."

            "§ <b>And Rav Zevid said: There are no children without signs</b> of puberty. In other words, if a girl gives birth, she definitely possesses the signs of puberty. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>let us examine</b> to see whether these physical signs are present, so that there is no need to depend on a presumption. The Gemara answers: <b>We are concerned lest</b> the hairs that constitute the sign <b>have fallen off.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>This</b> works out <b>well according to the one who said</b> that in general <b>we are concerned</b> lest signs fall off, i.e., that there are cases in which she is in fact mature but the hairs have come off.",
            "<b>However, according to the one who said</b> that if there are in fact hairs they will certainly be found, and <b>we are not concerned</b> that they may have fallen out, <b>what is there to say?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Even according to the one who said</b> that in ordinary circumstances <b>we are not concerned</b> that the hairs may have fallen out, in this case, <b>due to the pain of childbirth we are concerned</b> that they might have fallen out, and therefore it is impossible to examine the matter conclusively.",
            "§ The Gemara returns to the mishna: <b>How do they exempt their rival wives</b> and the rival wives of their rival wives? The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> that not only is a rival wife exempt but the rival wife of a rival wife is exempt as well, <b>derived? Rav Yehuda said</b> that this is <b>as the verse states:</b> “And you shall not take a woman to her sister, <b>to be a rival [<i>litzror</i>]</b> to her” (Leviticus 18:18). The term <i>litzror</i> is written, with the letter <i>reish</i> appearing twice, rather than <i>latzor</i>, with a single <i>reish</i>, which means that <b>the Torah amplified</b> and included <b>many rival wives.</b> In other words, this verse includes not only the rival wife of a forbidden relative, but also the rival wife of a rival wife.",
            "<b>Rav Ashi said: It is a logical inference,</b> which does not require a source from the Torah. <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>a rival wife</b> of a forbidden relative <b>is prohibited?</b> The reason is <b>that she stands in place of a forbidden relative.</b> Since the forbidden relative caused her exemption from levirate marriage, she too is considered a forbidden relative who remains categorized as a brother’s wife. Therefore, <b>the rival wife of a rival wife also stands in place of a forbidden relative,</b> as she is like the rival wife of a forbidden relative and is therefore forbidden herself.",
            "§ The mishna taught: <b>How so? If</b> the forbidden relative <b>died,</b> performed refusal, or was divorced, from that moment onward their rival wives are no longer considered the rival wives of a forbidden relative and are permitted. The Gemara remarks: This legal ruling with regard to a divorce is presented as a general principle <b>and</b> is therefore correct <b>even</b> if at the time that the deceased brother <b>married</b> the rival wife he was married to the forbidden relative, <b>and ultimately divorced</b> the relative, which means that for a period of time the women were rival wives. Even under these circumstances the prohibition of a rival wife of a forbidden relative does not apply, and she is permitted to enter into levirate marriage.",
            "<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a different mishna (30a), which discusses <b>three brothers, two of whom are married to two sisters and one is married to an unrelated woman. One of the husbands of the sisters</b> subsequently <b>divorced his wife, and the one who was married to the unrelated woman died, and the one who divorced</b> his wife <b>married</b> the <i>yevama</i> by levirate marriage <b>and</b> afterward <b>died</b> as well, which means that this <i>yevama</i> once again came for levirate marriage before the remaining brother, who was married to one of the sisters. <b>It is with</b> regard to <b>this</b> case <b>that they said that if they died or were divorced their rival wives are permitted.</b> This concludes the mishna.",
            "The Gemara infers from this mishna: <b>The reason</b> she is permitted is <b>that</b> the <i>yavam</i> first <b>divorced</b> the sister <b>and</b> only <b>afterward married</b> the unrelated woman. In this case, the unrelated woman was never actually the rival wife of a sister, despite the fact that they were, at different times, married to the same man. <b>However,</b> if the <i>yavam</i> first <b>married</b> the unrelated woman <b>and afterward divorced</b> the sister, she would <b>not</b> be permitted to enter into levirate marriage because for a period of time she had been the rival wife of a forbidden relative.",
            "These two <i>mishnayot</i> apparently contradict each other. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said:</b> This mishna is <b>disjointed,</b> i.e., the <i>mishnayot</i> are truly incompatible, and the <i>tanna</i> <b>who taught this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>did not teach that</b> <i>halakha</i>. The reason for the difference in opinions is that <b>this <i>tanna</i>,</b> of the mishna here, <b>maintains</b> that <b>death causes</b> her to <b>come before</b> him for levirate marriage. In other words, the decisive moment that determines the obligation in or exemption from levirate marriage is the moment of the childless brother’s death. Since in the case of the mishna here she was not the rival wife of a forbidden relative at the time of his death, the prohibition does not apply to her.",
            "<b>And that <i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna dealing with three brothers <b>maintains</b> that <b>the first marriage causes</b> her to <b>come before</b> him for levirate marriage. In other words, the levirate bond is established at the time of the marriage, and since the second wife was the rival wife of a forbidden relative for at least a brief period, her exemption from levirate marriage was determined then.",
            "<b>Rava said: Actually,</b> both <i>mishnayot</i> represent the opinion of <b>a single <i>tanna</i>, but he teaches</b> the mishna employing the style: <b>This and it is unnecessary to say that.</b> In other words, the mishna here is referring to a case where he first married and later divorced, while the mishna that deals with three brothers is speaking of a simpler, more obvious case, in which he first divorced and later married the second wife. In that case she is certainly permitted. Accordingly, there is no real contradiction here between the <i>mishnayot</i>, as they utilize different styles of teaching.",
            "§ The mishna taught: <b>And</b> if <b>any</b> of these forbidden relatives was a minor <b>who could refuse</b> her husband, then even if she did not refuse him, her rival wife performs <i>ḥalitza</i> and does not enter into levirate marriage. The Gemara asks: <b>And let</b> the minor <b>perform refusal now,</b> thereby annulling the marriage retroactively after the death of her husband, <b>and let her</b> rival wife <b>enter into levirate marriage.</b> Since this option is not accepted, <b>let us say that it supports</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Oshaya.</b>",
            "<b>As Rabbi Oshaya said:</b> A <i>yevama</i> who is a minor can <b>refuse the levirate betrothal of</b> the <i>yavam</i>. In other words, if he betrothed her she is free to say that she does not desire to marry him, a declaration that severs any connection between them. <b>But she cannot refuse his bond.</b> Provided that he has not performed a levirate betrothal, this minor <i>yevama</i> cannot annul the ties between them by a refusal, as theirs is not a bond of marriage, and the institution of refusal was established only with regard to marriage. According to this opinion, it is evident that a minor <i>yevama</i> who is a forbidden relative cannot perform refusal so as to enable her rival wife to enter levirate marriage.",
            "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No;</b> it is possible that a minor <i>yevama</i> can indeed refuse a levirate bond, but <b>the rival wife of a forbidden relative is different,</b> as she is not permitted in levirate marriage even if the forbidden relative herself can perform refusal. Why? <b>As Rami bar Yeḥezkel taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>she refused the husband,</b> thereby annulling the marriage, <b>she is permitted to his father,</b> as the marriage bond was entirely nullified retroactively and she is not considered his daughter-in-law at all. If, however, <b>she refused</b> only <b>the <i>yavam</i>, she is forbidden to his father.</b>",
            "<b>Apparently,</b> the reason is that <b>at the moment</b> of her <b>coming before</b> him for levirate marriage <b>she had the appearance of his daughter-in-law.</b> Since people will think she is his daughter-in-law, she is forbidden to the father. <b>Here, too, at the moment</b> of her <b>coming before</b> him for levirate marriage <b>she had the appearance of his daughter’s rival wife.</b> Consequently, the Sages did not permit her to enter into levirate marriage even if the other wife refuses the husband.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Six</b> women <b>with whom relations are forbidden</b> who were not enumerated in the first mishna <b>are</b> forbidden by prohibitions that are <b>more severe than those</b> listed in that mishna <b>because they may be married</b> only <b>to others</b> and may never be married to any of the brothers, due to the closeness of their relationship. However, this stringency entails a corresponding leniency: Since the <i>halakha</i> of levirate marriage is entirely inapplicable in these cases, <b>their rival wives are permitted.</b> The rival wife of a forbidden relative is forbidden herself only if the mitzva of levirate marriage is applicable, but where it is not in effect she is permitted.",

However, this issue is subject to a long-standing dispute. <b>Beit Shammai permit the rival wives to the brothers,</b> as they did not accept the interpretation of the verses that indicates that rival wives are prohibited. <b>And Beit Hillel forbid</b> them.

            "§ <b>Rava said: The rationale of Beit Shammai</b> for their opinion that rival wives are permitted in levirate marriage is not due to a specific verse. Rather, Beit Shammai apply the well-known halakhic principle <b>that a prohibition does not take effect</b> where <b>another prohibition</b> already exists. Since the first wife was already a prohibited relation to her brother-in-law during his brother’s lifetime, the second prohibition of a wife’s sister does not apply to her.

This means that the other wife <b>is a rival wife of a forbidden relative where no mitzva applies, and she is</b> therefore <b>permitted.</b>",

Before analyzing this issue, the Gemara asks: <b>This</b> verse: <b>“You shall not cut yourselves,” is required for the matter itself, as the Merciful One is saying: Do not cut yourselves over the dead.</b> How is the <i>halakha</i> concerning factions derived from this apparently straightforward verse?",

            "The Gemara inquires: <b>When</b> does this question apply? <b>If we say</b> that it is referring to the period <b>prior to</b> the <b>Divine Voice</b> that declared that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel, then <b>what is the rationale of the one who said that</b> Beit Shammai <b>did not act</b> in accordance with their opinion? <b>But rather,</b> if one would say it is referring to <b>after</b> the <b>Divine Voice, what is the reason for the one who said</b> that <b>they did act</b> in accordance with their opinion? After all, the Divine Voice established that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel.",
            "The Gemara answers: Neither of these options poses a difficulty. <b>If you wish, say</b> that it is referring to the period <b>prior to</b> the <b>Divine Voice, and if you wish, say</b> instead that it is <b>after</b> the <b>Divine Voice.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>If you wish, say</b> it is <b>prior to</b> the <b>Divine Voice, and</b> it is referring to the period <b>when Beit Hillel</b> formed <b>the majority</b> of the Sages. Therefore, <b>according to the one who said</b> that Beit Shammai <b>did not act</b> in accordance with their opinion, the reason is <b>that Beit Hillel</b> was <b>the majority,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the majority.",
            "<b>And the one who said</b> that <b>they did act</b> in accordance with their opinion maintains that <b>when do we follow the majority?</b> It is in a case <b>where</b> the disputing parties <b>are equal</b> in wisdom <b>to one another. Here,</b> however, <b>Beit Shammai are sharper</b> than Beit Hillel, and therefore they acted in accordance with their own opinion despite the fact that they were in the minority.",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that it was <b>after</b> the <b>Divine Voice. The one who said</b> that Beit Shammai <b>did not act</b> in accordance with their opinion would say <b>that</b> this was due to the <b>pronouncement</b> of the <b>Divine Voice. And the one who said</b> that <b>they did do so, this is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua, who said,</b> with regard to the Divine Voice that emerged and proclaimed that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer in the case of the oven of <i>akhnai</i> (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 59b), that <b>one disregards a Heavenly Voice.</b> Just as he disregarded the Divine Voice in his dispute with Rabbi Eliezer, so too, one disregards the Divine Voice that proclaimed that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel.",
            "<b>And</b> yet the question remains: According to <b>the one who said</b> that Beit Shammai <b>acted</b> in accordance with their opinion, <b>we</b> should <b>read here: “You shall not cut yourselves”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:1), which is interpreted to mean: <b>Do not become numerous factions. Abaye said: When we say</b> that the prohibition: <b>“You shall not cut yourselves”</b> applies, we are referring to a case <b>where two courts</b> are located <b>in one city,</b> and <b>these rule in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai and those rule in accordance with the statement of Beit Hillel.

            "<b>Rava said to him: But</b> the dispute between <b>Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel is considered like</b> a case of <b>two courts in one city,</b> as these two schools of thought were found everywhere, not in any specific place. <b>Rather, Rava said: When we say</b> that the prohibition: <b>“You shall not cut yourselves”</b> applies, we are referring to a case <b>where</b> there is <b>a court in one city, a section</b> of which <b>rules in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai and</b> another <b>section rules in accordance with the statement of Beit Hillel. However,</b> with regard to <b>two courts</b> located <b>in one city, we have no</b> problem <b>with it.</b>",
            "§ The Gemara cites other relevant sources. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear: In the locale of Rabbi Eliezer,</b> where his ruling was followed, <b>they would cut down trees</b> on Shabbat <b>to prepare charcoal</b> from them <b>to fashion iron</b> tools with which to circumcise a child <b>on Shabbat.</b> In Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion, not only does the mitzva of circumcision override Shabbat, but also any action required for the preparation of the tools necessary for the circumcision likewise overrides Shabbat. The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>In the locale of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili they would eat poultry meat in milk,</b> as Rabbi Yosei HaGelili held that the prohibition of meat in milk does not include poultry.",
            "The Gemara infers: <b>In the locale of Rabbi Eliezer, yes,</b> they would act in this manner, whereas <b>in the locale of Rabbi Akiva,</b> for instance, <b>no,</b> they would not do so, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>a principle was stated by Rabbi Akiva: Any prohibited labor that can be performed on Shabbat eve does not override Shabbat</b> even if it involves a mitzva. A mitzva whose proper time is on Shabbat overrides Shabbat only if its performance was impossible earlier, e.g., the act of circumcision itself, which cannot be performed earlier.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And what is this refutation?</b> As stated above, <b>it is different</b> when dealing <b>with numerous places,</b> and the <i>baraita</i> explicitly states that this practice was followed in Rabbi Eliezer’s locale. Consequently, there is no violation of the prohibition against splitting into factions. The Gemara asks: <b>He who asked it, why did he ask it,</b> i.e., what is the basis for the question in the first place? It is obvious that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a specific place.",
            "The Gemara answers: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>due to the severity of Shabbat, it,</b> i.e., the world, <b>is considered like a single locale.</b> In other words, one might have thought that the permission to tolerate diverse customs in different places applies only to other prohibitions, whereas the prohibition of Shabbat is so severe that it is unacceptable to allow different customs, as this might lead people to disrespect Shabbat. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that even in the case of Shabbat there can be different customs in various locales.",
            "§ The Gemara cites another relevant case involving Shabbat: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear that Rabbi Abbahu, when he happened</b> to come <b>to the place of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, would move</b> an oil <b>lamp [<i>sheraga</i>]</b> after the flame that had been lit for that Shabbat had burned out, as Rabbi Yehoshua accepted the ruling that it is permitted to carry items of this sort that had been set aside. <b>But when he happened</b> to come <b>to the place of Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who prohibited carrying items of this kind that had been set aside on Shabbat, <b>he would not move</b> an oil <b>lamp.</b> This indicates that divergent customs are followed in different places.",
            "Again, the Gemara asks: <b>And what is this difficulty? Didn’t we say</b> that <b>it is different</b> when dealing <b>with numerous places?</b> The Gemara explains that <b>this is what we are saying:</b> With regard to <b>Rabbi Abbahu</b> himself, <b>how could he act in this manner here and how could he act in that manner there?</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Abbahu holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> that it is permitted to carry this item. <b>And when he happened</b> to come <b>to the place of Rabbi Yoḥanan he would not carry it, in deference to Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> so as not to act contrary to his ruling in the place where he was the authority. The Gemara asks: <b>But there was a servant</b> accompanying Rabbi Abbahu who would see him carrying these types of articles that had been set aside. Wasn’t Rabbi Abbahu concerned that the servant might carry them in Rabbi Yoḥanan’s locale? The Gemara explains <b>that he would inform the servant</b> and explain to him the reason for his change in behavior.",
            "§ The Gemara continues to discuss the question of whether Beit Shammai followed their own rulings. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which is taught in the mishna: <b>Although</b> Beit Hillel <b>prohibit and</b> Beit Shammai <b>permit,</b> and these disqualify the women and those deem them fit, <b>Beit Shammai did not refrain from marrying women from Beit Hillel, nor did Beit Hillel</b> refrain from marrying women <b>from Beit Shammai.

            "The Gemara elaborates: <b>Granted, Beit Shammai did not refrain</b> from marrying into <b>Beit Hillel,</b> as even if Beit Shammai maintain in a certain case that a rival wife required levirate marriage or <i>ḥalitza</i>, if she went ahead and married another man their <b>children are</b> born to a union whose partners are <b>liable by</b> a regular <b>prohibition:</b> “The wife of the dead man shall not be married outside” (Deuteronomy 25:5). Since this transgression does not entail <i>karet</i>, the children of this relationship are not <i>mamzerim</i>.",
            "<b>However, why did Beit Hillel not refrain</b> from marrying into <b>Beit Shammai?</b> In the opinion of Beit Hillel the <b>children</b> of these rival wives who entered into levirate marriage are born of a union whose partners are <b>liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i>,</b> as the prohibition of a brother’s wife was never nullified in this case, which means that the children <b>are <i>mamzerim</i>.</b> If so, how could Beit Hillel allow these marriages?",
            "<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>Beit Hillel maintain that</b> the child of a union whose partners are <b>liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i> is not a <i>mamzer</i>,</b> as a <i>mamzer</i> is only one whose parents violated a prohibition that entails the death penalty, <b>didn’t Rabbi Elazar say: Although Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagreed</b> with regard <b>to rival wives, they concede that a <i>mamzer</i> is only from</b> a union <b>whose prohibition</b> is <b>a prohibition of forbidden relations punishable by <i>karet</i>?</b> Consequently, the children of rival wives are <i>mamzerim</i> according to Beit Hillel. <b>Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from</b> here that Beit Shammai <b>did not act</b> in accordance with their own opinion?",
            "The Gemara rejects this conclusion: <b>No; actually,</b> Beit Shammai <b>did act</b> in accordance with their opinion. As for the problem with these marriages, the answer is <b>that they would inform</b> Beit Hillel <b>and</b> Beit Hillel would <b>withdraw</b> from the match. When those who acted in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel would come to marry women from those who followed the rulings of Beit Shammai, they would be notified that certain children were born of rival wives and that those people were considered <i>mamzerim</i> in the opinion of Beit Hillel, who therefore declared them forbidden in marriage.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>And so too, it is reasonable</b> that this is the case, <b>as</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> in <b>the latter clause:</b> With regard to <b>all of the</b> disputes concerning the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>ritual purity and impurity, where those,</b> Beit Hillel, rule an article <b>ritually pure and these,</b> Beit Shammai, rule it <b>ritually impure, they did not refrain from handling ritually pure</b> objects <b>each with the other.</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>Granted, if you say that they notified them,</b> it is <b>due to that</b> reason that <b>they did not</b> need to <b>refrain</b> from using their objects. <b>However, if you say</b> that <b>they did not notify them, granted,</b> it is logical that <b>Beit Shammai did not refrain from</b> handling items belonging to <b>Beit Hillel, as ritually impure</b> objects <b>for Beit Hillel are ritually pure for Beit Shammai,</b> and therefore no special care is necessary.",
            "<b>However, why didn’t Beit Hillel refrain from</b> touching articles that belonged to <b>Beit Shammai?</b> After all, <b>ritually pure</b> objects <b>for Beit Shammai are ritually impure for Beit Hillel. Rather, is it not</b> the case that Beit Shammai <b>notified</b> Beit Hillel that these items were ritually pure only in their own opinion, and Beit Hillel separated themselves from them? The Gemara summarizes the discussion: <b>Conclude from</b> here that this is the correct interpretation.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>In what</b> way <b>is this</b> case <b>stronger than that</b> case? In other words, why is the statement with regard to ritual purity and impurity more conclusive than the one that deals with marriage? Since the practice of notification was not explicitly stated in the case of ritual purity but was merely inferred logically, the same reasoning applies equally to the case of marriage. The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that since it is so unusual, a marriage to <b>a rival wife</b> generates <b>publicity</b> and is so widely known that no special notification is required, therefore, the Gemara <b>teaches us</b> that even in this case notification is required.",
            "§ Since the statement of Rabbi Elazar was mentioned, the Gemara turns to discuss <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rabbi Elazar said: Although Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagreed</b> with regard <b>to rival wives, they concede that a <i>mamzer</i> is only from</b> a union <b>whose prohibition</b> is <b>a prohibition of forbidden relations punishable by <i>karet</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Who concedes</b> to whom? <b>If we say</b> that <b>Beit Shammai</b> concede <b>to Beit Hillel,</b> this is <b>obvious,</b> since if they acted in accordance with their own opinion that rival wives who married others without <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>are liable</b> only <b>for</b> violating a regular <b>prohibition,</b> their <b>children are</b> therefore <b>fit</b> and are not <i>mamzerim</i> at all.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> one could say that <b>Beit Hillel</b> concede <b>to Beit Shammai.</b> But in that case <b>she herself,</b> the rival wife of a forbidden relative who married one of the <i>yevamin</i>, <b>is liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i></b> in the opinion of Beit Hillel, and the child is a <i>mamzer</i>, whereas Rabbi Elazar’s statement indicates that they concede with regard to a different case.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>Actually, Beit Shammai</b> concede <b>to Beit Hillel,</b> and this is not a novelty with regard to their basic dispute. Instead, the statement comes <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Akiva, who said:</b> The offspring <b>from</b> forbidden relations for which one is <b>liable for</b> violating <b>a prohibition is a <i>mamzer</i>.</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>teaches us</b> that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel agree that the offspring <b>from</b> forbidden relations for which one is <b>liable for</b> violating <b>a prohibition is not a <i>mamzer</i>;</b> rather, one is a <i>mamzer</i> only if he is born of a union punishable by <i>karet</i>.",
            "§ The Gemara returns to the initial question of whether or not Beit Shammai acted in accordance with their own opinion. The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear: Although Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagreed</b> with regard <b>to</b> several cases, nevertheless, they did not refrain from marrying women from each other’s communities. The cases with regard to which they disagreed include <b>rival wives, and sisters,</b> i.e., if two sisters had been married to two brothers and simultaneously became obligated in levirate marriage, Beit Hillel prohibit both in levirate marriage, and if they violated the prohibition and married regardless, they require a divorce. By contrast, Beit Shammai permit them to remain married.",
            "Furthermore, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagreed with regard <b>to an outdated bill of divorce</b> that had been written but not delivered. Beit Shammai maintain that if the husband and wife continued to live together after the writing of the bill of divorce, the same bill of divorce can still be used later, whereas Beit Hillel dispute this. <b>And</b> they likewise <b>disagreed</b> with regard <b>to an uncertain married woman,</b> i.e., whether a minor who was actually married, and not merely betrothed, may perform refusal. <b>And</b> they also <b>disagreed</b> with regard <b>to one who divorces his wife and</b> later <b>she lodged</b> together <b>with him at an inn,</b> as to whether or not this is sufficient grounds for assuming that they remarried.",
            "Additionally, they disagreed with regard to the issue of betrothal <b>by money and with</b> the equivalent <b>value of money,</b> and <b>by a <i>peruta</i> or with</b> the equivalent <b>value of a <i>peruta</i>.</b> According to Beit Shammai, the minimal amount of money effective for betrothal is a dinar or the equivalent of a dinar, whereas Beit Hillel maintain that even the less valuable <i>peruta</i> or its equivalent is sufficient.",
            "Despite the fact that these <i>halakhot</i> entail important ramifications depending on whether or not these women were married or fit for marriage, or whether their offspring are fit for marriage, <b>Beit Shammai did not refrain from marrying women from Beit Hillel, nor did Beit Hillel</b> refrain from marrying women <b>from Beit Shammai.</b> This serves <b>to teach you that</b> they <b>practiced affection and camaraderie between them, to fulfill that which is stated: “Love truth and peace”</b> (Zechariah 8:19). <b>Rabbi Shimon says: They did refrain in the certain</b> cases, <b>but they did not refrain in the uncertain</b> cases. In other words, Beit Hillel were not worried that any ordinary woman from Beit Shammai might be one of those of uncertain status.",
            "The Gemara infers from the opinion of Rabbi Shimon: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that Beit Shammai <b>did act</b> in accordance with their opinion, it is <b>due to that</b> reason that <b>they refrained</b> in the certain cases. <b>However, if you say</b> that <b>they did not act</b> in accordance with their opinion, <b>why did they refrain</b> from marriage? The Gemara replies: <b>And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> it that way, that Beit Shammai acted in accordance with their opinion? <b>Even if they acted</b> in accordance with their opinion, <b>granted</b> that <b>Beit Hillel refrained from</b> marrying into <b>Beit Shammai,</b> as <b>those</b> rival wives who entered into levirate marriage <b>are liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i> and</b> their children <b>are <i>mamzerim</i> according to</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel.</b>",
            "<b>However, why did Beit Shammai refrain from</b> marrying the offspring of rival wives of <b>Beit Hillel?</b> The parents are <b>liable for</b> violating a regular <b>prohibition, and</b> therefore their children <b>are fit.</b> The Gemara answers <b>as Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> with regard to a different matter: <b>This</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>was necessary</b> not for the children of the rival wife, but <b>only for the rival wife herself. Here too, it was necessary only for the rival wife herself.</b> The <i>halakha</i> was not taught with regard to the children of the rival wives; rather, it is referring only to the rival wives.",
            "The Gemara asks further: <b>And in what</b> way are uncertain cases <b>different from the certain</b> cases, such as forbidden rival wives? If you say <b>that</b> certain cases are undoubtedly <b>prohibited</b> in the opinion of Beit Hillel, the cases involving <b>uncertain</b> circumstances, e.g., one who divorced his wife and then stayed with her in the same inn, <b>are also prohibited.</b> Even if Beit Hillel render these cases prohibited only due to some uncertainty, the ruling is the same.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Do not say: In the uncertain</b> cases, i.e., that the <i>halakha</i> involved doubtful circumstances. <b>Rather, say: From the unspecified</b> case. In other words, barring clear knowledge of an uncertain betrothal within a specific family, they would take women from that family in marriage. The reason is <b>that</b> Beit Shammai <b>would notify</b> Beit Hillel of the prohibition according to their opinion, <b>and</b> they would <b>refrain</b> from the marriage. If there was no notification, this was a clear sign that no doubt was involved in this case at all.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>what</b> does <b>this</b> come to <b>teach us?</b> Is it <b>that</b> they had <b>relations of affection and camaraderie between them,</b> i.e., that each trusted that the other side would never cause them to err with regard to something they held to be prohibited? <b>This is</b> the same as the <b>first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>. What is Rabbi Shimon adding by his statement? The Gemara answers: This comes to <b>teach us that the entire</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b> This is not a dispute between two Sages. Rather, Rabbi Shimon’s opinion elucidates the earlier statement.",
            "§ The Gemara offers an alternative resolution: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri said: How should</b> one act with regard to <b>this <i>halakha</i></b> of rival wives? In what form should it <b>become widespread among the Jewish people?</b> If <b>we act in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai</b> and permit a rival wife in levirate marriage, <b>the offspring</b> will be <b>a <i>mamzer</i> according to the statement of Beit Hillel.</b> If <b>we act in accordance with the statement of Beit Hillel</b> and grant full exemption to the rival wives, <b>the offspring will</b> be of <b>flawed</b> lineage <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai,</b> as he is the child of a woman prohibited in marriage by a regular prohibition.

        [
            "that they <b>should perform <i>ḥalitza</i> and not enter into levirate marriage.</b> If they act in this manner, they will be permitted to marry others and the problem will be solved according to all opinions. <b>They were unable to finalize the matter</b> according to the proposition raised by Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri <b>before times of trouble</b> arrived. Due to the outbreak of war they were unable to gather together to vote and establish an accepted halakhic ruling.",
            "Sometime later, when they returned to discuss the issue, <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said to</b> the other Sages: <b>What shall we do with those earlier rival wives from now</b> onward? Since in the meantime some rival wives had entered into levirate marriage, if we issue a collective ruling that rival wives may not do so, their children will be declared <i>mamzerim</i>. Therefore, it is better not to establish this <i>halakha</i> at all.",
            "The Gemara analyzes this episode in relation to the matter at hand. <b>Granted, if you say</b> that Beit Shammai <b>did act</b> in accordance with their own opinion, <b>this is</b> the meaning of <b>what</b> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel <b>said: What shall we do?</b> Since these rival wives had already entered into levirate marriage, it was impossible to change the status of their children retroactively. <b>However, if you say</b> that <b>they did not act</b> in accordance with their opinion, <b>what is</b> the meaning of: <b>What shall we do?</b> If Beit Shammai did not act upon their ruling, they never actually permitted a <i>yavam</i> to take a rival wife in levirate marriage.",
            "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> This amendment was <b>necessary,</b> not for the benefit of the children of rival wives, as Beit Shammai never in fact acted on their ruling; <b>rather,</b> it was necessary <b>only for the rival wife herself.</b> If these rival wives married others, in the opinion of Beit Shammai their marriages were flawed, as they did not perform <i>ḥalitza</i>. And as for the question: <b>What shall we do, this is what</b> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel <b>is saying:</b> With regard to <b>those rival wives</b> who were entirely exempt according <b>to Beit Hillel, what</b> should <b>we do with them</b> according <b>to Beit Shammai,</b> as these rival wives had already married others without performing <i>ḥalitza</i>?",
            "The Gemara elaborates: If you say <b>let them perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, they will be repulsive to their husbands,</b> as it will seem to the husband that the woman he has been living with for some time suddenly requires a permit for marriage. <b>And if you would say, let them be repulsive</b> to their husbands, as that is not our concern, this is not the case, as the Torah says: <b>“Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace”</b> (Proverbs 3:17).",
            "§ The Gemara suggests further: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another source, <b>as Rabbi Tarfon said: I yearn</b> for the following scenario: <b>When shall my daughter’s rival wife come before me and I will marry her?</b> In other words, in this hypothetical case I would act in accordance with the opinion of Beit Shammai and take her in levirate marriage. This statement indicates that those who held by the traditions of Beit Shammai did indeed act upon their opinion. The Gemara amends this statement. <b>Say: And I will marry her off,</b> i.e., I shall act in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel and marry her off to others.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But he said: I yearn,</b> and if he meant that he would follow the ruling of Beit Hillel, which is the common practice, what is the novelty of Rabbi Tarfon’s statement? The Gemara responds: Rabbi Tarfon comes <b>to exclude</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri,</b> who maintains that all rival wives perform <i>ḥalitza</i>. Rabbi Tarfon yearned for an opportunity to demonstrate that the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri.",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear an incident involving Rabban Gamliel’s daughter, who was married to Abba, his brother, and</b> Abba <b>died childless, and Rabban Gamliel entered into levirate marriage with her rival wife.</b> This is apparently conclusive proof that the rival wife of a daughter may enter into levirate marriage. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how can <b>you understand it</b> that way? Was <b>Rabban Gamliel among the disciples of Beit Shammai?</b> In fact, Rabban Gamliel, who was a descendant of Hillel himself, certainly followed the opinion of Beit Hillel.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the case of <b>Rabban Gamliel’s daughter is different, as she was a sexually underdeveloped woman [<i>aylonit</i>],</b> and therefore the prohibition against marrying her rival wife does not apply, as explicitly stated in the mishna. The Gemara asks: But <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it is taught</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of the same <i>baraita</i>: <b>Others say</b> that <b>Rabban Gamliel’s daughter was an <i>aylonit</i>,</b> it can be derived <b>by inference that the first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>she was not an <i>aylonit</i>.</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: The dispute between the <i>tanna’im</i> was not about whether or not she was an <i>aylonit</i>, as she certainly was. Rather, the practical difference <b>between them</b> is whether <b>he knew</b> that <b>she</b> was an <i>aylonit</i> at the time of marriage and decided to marry her regardless. Some maintain in general that if the husband was aware of her condition prior to marriage, her rival wife is forbidden, <b>but</b> if <b>he did not know about her</b> status, the rival wife is permitted.",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> that the practical difference <b>between them</b> concerns a different case, that of one who <b>married and ultimately divorced.</b> This is referring to an issue discussed above of whether a woman is considered the rival wife of a forbidden relation simply by virtue of her marriage to the specific man or whether she must be married to him at the time when the mitzva of levirate obligation takes effect, i.e., at the time of the brother’s death.",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> that the practical difference <b>between them</b> concerns a case where <b>there is a condition in sexual relations.</b> In other words, the first <i>tanna</i> holds that Rabban Gamliel’s daughter was married only conditionally, and since the condition was never fulfilled the marriage was nullified. Consequently, Rabban Gamliel could marry the other wife regardless of his daughter’s status as an <i>aylonit</i>, as she was never married to his brother at all. However, according to the other <i>tanna</i>, even if the marriage was dependent upon a condition that was not fulfilled, because the man engaged in sexual relations with her the act of intercourse itself serves to nullify the condition. Accordingly, he maintains that the only reason Rabban Gamliel could enter into levirate marriage with his daughter’s rival wife was not because of the condition, but due to the fact that his daughter was an <i>aylonit</i>. Whichever explanation is accepted, this case provides no proof with regard to the issue of whether or not Beit Shammai acted in accordance with their ruling.",
            "§ <b>Rav Mesharshiyya raised an objection</b> against those who claim that Beit Shammai did not act in accordance with their opinion. It is taught in a mishna: There was <b>an incident involving Rabbi Akiva, who collected an <i>etrog</i> on the first of</b> the month of <b>Shevat and performed with it two tenths.</b> In other words, he separated two tithes from the fruit, as though it belonged to two different tithing years. He removed both the second tithe and the poor man’s tithe at the same time, two tithes that should not be separated in the same year.",

Concerned that they had already become ritually impure, <b>he said to me: I do not eat olives.</b> He spoke politely and stated that he did not eat olives because he did not wish to embarrass his benefactor by disclosing that he feared they had become ritually impure.",
            "Rabbi Elazar bar Tzadok continued his account. <b>I went and informed</b> my <b>father.

However, due to the presence of the hole, the olives were not rendered susceptible to ritual impurity. <b>And we learned</b> this in a mishna: With regard to <b>a barrel of preserved olives, Beit Shammai say it does not need to be perforated,</b> as the juice issuing from the olives does not render them susceptible to ritual impurity.",
            "<b>And Beit Hillel say</b> that <b>it does need to be perforated,</b> as they maintain that the juice of olives is considered oil and it therefore renders the olives susceptible to ritual impurity. <b>And</b> Beit Hillel <b>concede that if</b> the barrel <b>was perforated and</b> subsequently <b>clogged by sediments it is ritually pure,</b> despite the moisture on the olives. Since liquids render food susceptible to ritual impurity only if they were placed on them intentionally, the hole in the barrel clearly shows that one did not intend for the juice to be there. By boring a hole in the barrel he has rendered it obvious that he did not desire the presence of the olive juices, and therefore it does not matter that the hole became blocked.",

            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Each of the women enumerated in the first chapter causes exemption from levirate marriage and <i>ḥalitza</i> for her rival wives. This is due to the close family relationship she has with her brother-in-law, making her forbidden to him. The single exception is the case explained in this mishna. <b>What</b> is the case of <b>the wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist?</b> For example: If there were <b>two brothers, and one of them died</b> childless, <b>and</b> subsequently <b>a brother of theirs was born, after which the second brother,</b> the elder, <b>took his</b> deceased <b>brother’s wife in levirate marriage, and</b> then <b>died</b> as well. Consequently, two women require levirate marriage: The widow of the first brother who had been taken in levirate marriage by the second brother, and the widow of the second brother, the first widow’s rival wife. <b>The first</b> widow, who had been the wife of the first brother to die, <b>goes out</b> without any obligation to be taken in levirate marriage by the youngest brother who was born later, <b>since</b> she is <b>the wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist.</b> The first deceased brother never lived at the same time as the newly born brother. <b>The second</b> widow, who had been married to the second brother, is exempt <b>due to her rival wife.</b>",
            "The mishna discusses an additional situation: If the second brother had <b>performed</b> only <b>levirate betrothal with her,</b> meaning that he had not yet consummated the marriage, <b>and</b> then <b>died,</b> both the wife betrothed by a levirate betrothal to the second brother and the wife of the second brother fall before the youngest brother born after the death of the first brother. In that case, the first wife certainly goes out and is exempt from both <i>ḥalitza</i> and levirate marriage, since she is to him the wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist. <b>The second,</b> however, was never effectively the rival wife of the first brother’s wife, as the first brother’s wife had only been betrothed by levirate betrothal and was not fully married to the second brother. Therefore, <b>she performs <i>ḥalitza</i> and may not enter into levirate marriage.</b>",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Naḥman said: He who taught</b> the version of the mishna which reads: <b>The first</b> widow goes out, <b>is not mistaken</b> in his version, and <b>he who taught</b> a variant version of the mishna which reads: <b>The second</b> widow goes out, <b>is not mistaken</b> either, since it is possible to understand the mishna both ways. Both versions of the text can refer to the same woman, i.e., the wife of the first brother, by different titles. The Gemara explains that <b>he who taught:</b>"

            "<b>The first, is not mistaken,</b> as <b>what is</b> the meaning of <b>first?</b> It means <b>the first to fall</b> before her <i>yavam</i> for levirate marriage. <b>And he who taught</b> referring to her as <b>the second is not mistaken</b> either, as <b>what is</b> the meaning of <b>second?</b> It means <b>the second to enter marriage.</b> Since the second deceased brother was already married to one woman, this <i>yevama</i> whom he took in levirate marriage was his second wife. The Gemara wonders: Is this the necessary order of events? <b>Are we not</b> also <b>dealing with</b> a scenario <b>in which</b> the second brother <b>took</b> the wife of the first brother <b>in levirate marriage and then later took</b> another wife? Would such a situation not merit the same ruling? <b>Rather, what is</b> the meaning of calling the wife of the first brother <b>the second?</b> It means <b>she who had been married for a second time.</b> She had already been married twice, whereas the wife of the second brother had been married only once.",
            "§ The Gemara turns from a review of the language used in the mishna to a discussion of the <i>halakhot</i> of a wife of a brother with whom one did not coexist. <b>Where is it written</b> that the mitzva of levirate marriage does not apply in the case of <b>the wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist? Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: The verse states “If brothers dwell together</b> and one of them dies” (Deuteronomy 25:5), meaning <b>that they had a common dwelling</b> together <b>in the world.</b> This <b>excludes the wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist.</b> Furthermore, it is derived: <b>“Together”</b> means that they were <b>united</b> together <b>in an inheritance;</b> i.e., they are united in that they inherit together. In other words, since property is inherited by sons from their father, it can be inferred that the verse is speaking specifically of brothers from the same father. This <b>excludes his maternal</b> half <b>brother,</b> with whom he is not united by inheritance, since only brothers who share the same father inherit from each other.",
            "<b>Rabba said: One learns</b> the ruling that levirate marriage applies only to <b>brothers from the</b> same <b>father</b> by the verbal analogy between the term <b>brotherhood</b> used in the context of levirate marriage and the term <b>brotherhood from the children of Jacob. Just as there,</b> with regard to the children of Jacob, they are all brothers <b>from the father and not from the mother,</b> since they were from four different mothers, <b>so too, here,</b> in the case of levirate marriage, it is referring specifically to brothers <b>from the father and not from the mother.</b>",
            "The Gemara raises an objection: Why should we learn from the children of Jacob? <b>Let it derive</b> the meaning of the term <b>brotherhood</b> by verbal analogy to the term <b>brotherhood from</b> the verses discussing <b>those with whom relations are forbidden.</b> In the <i>halakhot</i> of forbidden relations, both paternal and maternal half brothers are considered brothers, and are thereby subject to such prohibitions as those against relations with a brother’s wife. The Gemara answers: The first analogy is preferable, as <b>we infer “brothers” from “brothers.”</b> The word “brothers” is stated both with regard to the children of Jacob and with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of levirate marriage, <b>whereas</b> with regard to forbidden relations it says “your brother,” and <b>one cannot make an inference to “brothers” from “your brother.”</b>",
            "The Gemara objects: <b>What difference does it make</b> if there is a minor difference between the words being compared? <b>As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> a verbal analogy with regard to leprosy of houses between the verse <b>“and the priest shall return [<i>veshav</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:39) and the verse <b>“and the priest shall come [<i>uva</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:44), from which it is derived that <b>this is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>returning,</b> i.e., it is after seven days, and <b>this is</b> the same <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>coming,</b> that it is after seven days. Consequently, a less pronounced difference of one letter between the Hebrew words for “brothers” and “your brother” should certainly not prevent the teaching of a verbal analogy. The Gemara responds: <b>This applies when nothing</b> else <b>was</b> more <b>similar, but where there is something similar we infer from that which is more similar.</b> In such situations, it is preferable to learn from the word that bears greater similarity.",
            "The Gemara objects on another count: <b>Let</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>derive</b> the meaning of the term <b>brotherhood</b> from the term <b>brotherhood from Lot, as it is written</b> that Abraham said to Lot: <b>“For we are brothers”</b> (Genesis 13:8). From here one could conclude that the word brothers means relatives and not necessarily brothers. The Gemara rejects this: <b>It is</b> more <b>reasonable to derive from the children of Jacob, due to</b> the fact that the word “brothers” <b>is free</b> in its context and is therefore available to be used in a verbal analogy: <b>Since it could have written: We your servants are twelve children of our father,</b> but instead it <b>writes:</b> “Twelve <b>brothers,</b> the children of one man” (Genesis 42:13), <b>learn from here</b> that this comes <b>to render</b> the word “brothers” <b>free</b> so that it may be allocated to another matter, i.e., the definition of brothers.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> although Rav Yehuda and Rabba learned the same ruling from two different passages, according to both <b>it was necessary to write “brothers” and it was necessary to write “together”</b> in the verses discussing levirate marriage, <b>as, if the Merciful One had written</b> only <b>“brothers,” I would say that one should infer</b> the meaning of the term <b>“brothers”</b> from the term <b>“brothers” from Lot. And if you would say it is not free</b> there in the same way that the word “brothers” is free in the passage concerning the children of Jacob, this is <b>not so;</b> in fact, <b>it is free.</b> With regard to Lot <b>it could have written: Friends,</b> as they were not actual brothers but relatives, <b>and</b> yet <b>“brothers” is written.</b> One might <b>learn from</b> here <b>that this is free</b> to be allocated elsewhere and teach that such relatives are called brothers even for levirate marriage. Therefore, <b>the Torah wrote “together”</b> to teach that this applies specifically to <b>those</b> brothers who are <b>united in an inheritance.</b>",
            "<b>And if the Merciful One had written “together”</b> alone and not added “brothers,” <b>I would say that</b> they must <b>have</b> both <b>the same father and mother together,</b> and that otherwise the mitzva of levirate marriage would not apply. Therefore, “brothers” is written to compare this to the children of Jacob, who were brothers from the same father but not the same mother. It is for this reason, then, that <b>it</b> is <b>necessary</b> to write both.",
            "The Gemara asks about the last supposition: <b>But from where would it be derived</b> that perhaps levirate marriage would apply only if they are full brothers, sharing both a father and mother? Why should one assume that maternal brotherhood is also of import here? Doesn’t <b>the Merciful One make levirate marriage dependent upon inheritance?</b> The Torah states that the <i>yavam</i> who performs the levirate marriage will establish the name of his deceased brother, meaning that he inherits from him, <b>and inheritance</b> comes <b>from the father and not from the mother.</b> Nevertheless, this <b>was necessary,</b> as <b>it could enter your mind to say that since this</b> <i>halakha</i> of levirate marriage <b>is a novelty</b> in <b>that</b> a woman who was a <b>forbidden relation to him</b> as a brother’s wife <b>is</b> now <b>rendered permitted, say</b> that this permissibility will be limited <b>only to</b> cases of brothers <b>with the same father and same mother together.</b> It is due to this possibility that the verbal analogy to the brothers who were the children of Jacob is <b>necessary.</b>",
            "§ <b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> In the case of <b>a widow</b> whose husband had died childless and who is <b>waiting for her <i>yavam</i></b> to perform levirate marriage or set her free with <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>who</b> then <b>died</b> before her <i>yavam</i> could take her in levirate marriage, the <i>yavam</i> <b>is permitted to</b> marry <b>her mother.</b> The levirate obligation does not create a familial relation between them. <b>Apparently,</b> Rav Huna says that Rav <b>holds</b> that <b>the</b> levirate <b>bond [<i>zikka</i>] is not substantial.</b> In other words, the bond formed between the <i>yevama</i> and her <i>yavam</i> requiring levirate marriage does not create a halakhic connection between the two. The Gemara asks: <b>Then let him say</b> explicitly: The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the statement of he who says</b> that <b>the</b> levirate <b>bond is not substantial,</b> as this issue is in fact a matter of dispute between <i>tanna’im</i>.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>If he had said that, I would say: This</b> statement that the levirate bond is not substantial <b>applies</b> only in reference <b>to two</b> brothers, each of whom has the possibility to take her in levirate marriage.

            "The Gemara rejects this: No evidence can be derived from here, as it is possible to say that <b>the same is true even for her mother,</b> that she too is permitted. <b>But since it taught in the first clause</b> of this mishna: If <b>his wife dies he is permitted to take her sister,</b> and there the language is precise and implies: <b>Her sister, yes, but her mother, no, as she is forbidden by Torah</b> law because it is prohibited for a man to marry both a woman and her daughter even after one of them dies, therefore he used the same language when <b>he taught the latter clause</b> of the same mishna that <b>he is permitted to</b> take <b>her sister.</b> However, in the latter clause it is not an exact reading, and in actuality one is allowed to marry any of her relatives. This completes the Gemara’s explanation of Rav Huna’s opinion.",
            "<b>And Rav Yehuda said:</b> In the case of <b>a widow who dies</b> while <b>waiting for her brother-in-law</b> to perform <i>ḥalitza</i> or levirate marriage, <b>he is prohibited from</b> marrying <b>her mother.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>Apparently</b> Rav Yehuda <b>holds</b> that <b>the levirate bond is substantial;</b> this would mean that the attachment between the <i>yevama</i> and the <i>yavam</i> is like that of marriage and that the <i>yavam</i> is therefore prohibited from marrying her relatives. <b>But</b> it must be asked: Why does Rav Yehuda say it in such a way? <b>Let</b> him <b>say:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the statement of the one who says that the</b> levirate <b>bond is substantial.</b>",

            "<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (109a): That mishna discusses a case of two brothers who were married to two sisters. One sister is an adult and therefore her marriage was fully effectual, and one sister is still a minor, and she was orphaned from her father, and her marriage was valid only by rabbinic ordinance. If the brother who was married to the elder sister died, then that sister falls for levirate marriage before the brother married to the minor. Under these circumstances, the Sages suggested directing the minor to refuse her marriage to her husband so that he would be able to take his brother’s wife in levirate marriage. If the minor does not do so, he would be unable to take her sister in marriage, as she would be the sister of his minor wife and thereby fully exempt from the levirate obligation. <b>Rabban Gamliel said: If</b> the minor <b>refused</b> in the meantime of her own accord, <b>then she refused, but if she did not refuse, let her wait until she reaches</b> the age of <b>maturity, and</b> then <b>that other</b> adult sister <b>will be exempt</b> from performing <i>ḥalitza</i> or levirate marriage <b>due to</b> the fact that she is his <b>wife’s sister.</b> Here it is apparent that Rabban Gamliel is not concerned about nullifying the mitzva of levirate marriage from one of them.",
            "Rabba <b>said to</b> Abaye: Do you wish to <b>raise a contradiction between</b> the words of <b>Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Meir?</b> This would imply that the contradiction needs to be resolved, but statements from two different <i>tanna’im</i> do not need to agree or to be resolved. Abaye responded: <b>No,</b> in fact <b>this is what we meant to say:</b> How could one possibly say that <b>Rabbi Meir is concerned</b> lest there be nullification of the mitzva of levirate marriage <b>even when it is uncertain</b> because perhaps the first brother will not die, whereas <b>Rabban Gamliel is not concerned</b> that the mitzva be nullified <b>even when it is certain?</b> It is surprising that there should be such a great difference between the tannaitic opinions.

Rav Oshaya came to this conclusion <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it teaches a superfluous mishna.</b>",
            "How so? <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is it teaching the section of the first clause,</b> i.e., the previous mishna? <b>If we say</b> it is the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who prohibit marriage to the wife of a brother with whom one did not coexist in all cases, then let us look at the second mishna. <b>Now</b> that even in the case where the second brother <b>entered into levirate marriage and afterward</b> the third brother <b>was born,</b> such that <b>when he found her,</b> i.e., when he was born, she had a <b>permitted</b> status, as she was already married to the second brother, she was never in his lifetime the wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist but was in fact for him the wife of a living brother.

She still has the levirate bond due to the deceased brother, who was a brother with whom the newly born brother did not coexist.",
            "The Gemara proceeds to clarify Rabbi Shimon’s position: <b>Granted,</b> in the case when the second brother first <b>performed levirate marriage</b> and <b>subsequently</b> the third brother <b>was born,</b> it is possible to explain <b>that when</b> the third brother <b>found her,</b> i.e., when he was born, <b>he found her in a permitted</b> state because when he was born she was already the wife of a living brother with whom he coexisted. <b>But</b> if <b>he was born and subsequently</b> the second brother <b>performed levirate marriage, what is the reason</b> that Rabbi Shimon renders her permitted? The Gemara answers: One must say that Rabbi Shimon <b>holds that the</b> levirate <b>bond is substantial,</b> and that the bond itself created a tie of kinship. Moreover, a woman with a levirate <b>bond is considered like a married woman.</b> Since there is a bond between the <i>yevama</i> and the living brother it is as though she were already married to him. Accordingly, she is, for the new brother, like the wife of his brother with whom he coexisted.",
            "<b>Rav Yosef strongly objects to this: Now</b> that in the case of a levirate <b>bond and a levirate betrothal</b> together <b>Rabbi Shimon is uncertain as to whether she is similar to a married woman or an unmarried woman, is it necessary</b> to say that by levirate <b>bond alone</b> she is not like a married woman? If so, how can the Gemara assume that for Rabbi Shimon, the levirate bond alone gives her the status of a married woman?",
            "<b>What</b> is the proof that this is Rabbi Shimon’s opinion? <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (31b): In the case of <b>three brothers</b> who were <b>married to three unrelated women, and one of</b> the brothers <b>died, and the second</b> brother <b>performed levirate betrothal</b> with the widow <b>and</b> subsequently <b>died, then these</b> women, both the first wife of the second brother and the betrothed widow of the first brother, <b>must perform <i>ḥalitza</i> and may not enter into levirate marriage</b> with the third brother.",
            "What is the reason that the wife of the first brother is not eligible for levirate marriage? <b>As it is stated: “And one of them dies…her brother-in-law will have intercourse with her</b> and will take her to him to be his wife and consummate the levirate marriage” (Deuteronomy 25:5). From here it is derived: <b>She who is subject to</b> a levirate <b>bond with a single <i>yavam</i></b> enters levirate marriage <b>and not she who is subject to</b> a levirate <b>bond with two <i>yevamin</i>.</b> This woman requires levirate marriage due to the death of the first brother, and also, due to the subsequent levirate betrothal, requires levirate marriage following the death of the second brother.",
            "However, <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Let him enter into levirate marriage</b> with <b>whichever he wishes and perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with the second.</b> Rabbi Shimon does not accept the homiletical interpretation forbidding a woman who is subject to two levirate bonds. The Gemara explains his opinion: Rabbi Shimon does <b>not</b> allow him to <b>take both in levirate marriage.</b> Why not? <b>Perhaps the</b> levirate <b>bond is substantial,</b> and combined with the levirate bond to the second brother the woman might be considered to be already married to the second brother, <b>and</b> then <b>these</b> two women <b>would be two <i>yevamot</i> who come</b>"

            "<b>from a single household,</b> i.e., husband, and everyone agrees that only one wife from each household may be taken in levirate marriage, as the verse states: “To build his brother’s house,” which is interpreted to mean that the remaining brother may perform levirate marriage with only one wife of his late brother and not with two. To <b>take one in levirate marriage and exempt the other</b> without any procedure, he may <b>not</b> do, <b>as perhaps</b> the levirate <b>bond is not substantial</b> enough to make the first brother’s widow <b>like a married woman</b> to the second brother. In that case this woman whose husband died first remains the wife of the first brother, and the second woman is the wife of the second brother. Then there would be two separate levirate obligations, and one could not exempt the other; <b>they would be two <i>yevamot</i> who come from two households.</b> Therefore, <b>apparently</b> even when levirate betrothal was performed Rabbi Shimon <b>is uncertain</b> whether or not the levirate bond is substantial.",

            "<b>But</b> this cannot be, <b>as Rabbi Shimon’s reason</b> is mentioned explicitly in the <i>baraita</i>, and there he does not state that this is a decree of the Sages.

If she is then taken by the third brother in levirate marriage, <b>he would be engaging in relations with the wife of the first</b> brother. From here one can conclude that the basis for Rabbi Shimon’s uncertainty is related to the questions concerning the strength of the levirate betrothal.",
            "<b>Abaye said to him:</b> From here you cannot prove what Rabbi Shimon’s opinion was. <b>Is there no difference to you between</b> a levirate <b>bond to a single <i>yavam</i> and a bond to two <i>yevamim</i>?

Accordingly, Rabbi Shimon’s uncertainty is with regard to the case of a levirate bond with two <i>yevamin</i>.",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>Does Rabbi Shimon differentiate</b> between the case of one <i>yavam</i> and the case of two <i>yevamin</i> in the matter of a wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist? <b>But it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist: <b>Rabbi Shimon stated a principle: Whenever the birth</b> of the third brother <b>precedes the</b> levirate <b>marriage</b> of the second brother, if this second brother dies and the <i>yevama</i> falls before the third brother, <b>she does not perform <i>ḥalitza</i> and she does not enter into levirate marriage.</b> In such circumstances she is the wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist. But if <b>the</b> levirate <b>marriage preceded his birth, she either performs <i>ḥalitza</i> or enters into levirate marriage.</b>",
            "<b>What, is it not</b> referring to the case of <b>a single <i>yavam</i>, and it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>She does not perform <i>ḥalitza</i> and she does not enter into levirate marriage.</b> Even if there is only a single <i>yavam</i> this is not considered full marriage, and she remains forbidden as the wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist. Consequently, she who is subject to a levirate bond is not like a married woman. The Gemara answers: <b>No.</b> it refers to a case of <b>two <i>yevamin</i>.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But what,</b> then, is the ruling for <b>a single <i>yavam</i>? So too,</b> one should say <b>she either performs <i>ḥalitza</i> or enters into levirate marriage,</b> as the woman who requires levirate marriage is like the wife of the second brother for all purposes. <b>If so, rather than teaching</b> the case when <b>the marriage</b> of the second brother <b>precedes the birth</b> of the third brother, that if this second brother dies and she falls before the third brother, <b>she either performs <i>ḥalitza</i> or enters into levirate marriage, let</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>distinguish and teach</b> the distinction <b>within</b> the situation <b>itself</b> and say: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? When</b> there are <b>two <i>yevamin</i>. But</b> if there is <b>one <i>yavam</i>, she either performs <i>ḥalitza</i> or enters into levirate marriage.</b>",
            "The Gemara rejects this: No, <b>the entire</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is in reference to two <i>yevamin</i></b> and differentiates between various cases involving two <i>yevamin</i>, namely, the case where the birth of the third brother preceded the marriage of the second brother and the case where the marriage of the second brother preceded the birth of the third brother. The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, what is the principle</b> in this matter? If Rabbi Shimon is speaking of two <i>yevamin</i> and not a single <i>yavam</i>, then it makes no sense to speak of a principle, as the <i>halakha</i> is different in the case of a single <i>yavam</i>.",
            "<b>Moreover, Rav Oshaya raised an objection</b> from that which was taught in a mishna (28b): If there were <b>three brothers, two of whom were married to two sisters, or to a woman and her daughter, or a woman and her daughter’s daughter, or a woman and her son’s daughter,</b> who are, in each case, two women who may not be married to the same person simultaneously, and subsequently these brothers who were married to relatives died, <b>then those</b> two women <b>must perform <i>ḥalitza</i> and may not enter into levirate marriage.</b> Since they both have a levirate bond to the third brother at the same time and he is prohibited from marrying both, they cause one another to be unable to perform levirate marriage. <b>And Rabbi Shimon exempts</b> them even from <i>ḥalitza</i>.",
            "<b>And if it enters your mind that Rabbi Shimon held that</b> a levirate <b>bond is substantial</b> enough to make her <b>like a married woman,</b> then <b>let</b> the third brother <b>consummate the levirate marriage to the</b> widow of the <b>first</b> husband to die, since as soon as her husband dies she has a levirate bond with the other brothers and should be considered to be like his wife, <b>and let the other be exempt</b> as a result, as her levirate bond began only with the death of the second husband.",
            "<b>Rav Amram said: What</b> is <b>really</b> the meaning of the word <b>exempt</b> used by Rabbi Shimon? Only <b>the second is exempt.</b> The Gemara objects: <b>But it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon exempts both.</b> From here it is clear that in his opinion a woman subject to a levirate bond does not have the same status as a married woman.",
            "<b>Rava said:</b> In the case mentioned in that <i>baraita</i>, there were three brothers, two of whom died. Each of the deceased brothers had four wives who were related to the wives of the other brother as described in the mishna. One wife of the first brother was the sister of a wife of the second brother. Another wife was the mother of a wife of the second brother. Another was the daughter of the daughter of a wife of the second brother. And another was the daughter of the son of a wife of the second brother. When these brothers died, all eight women happened before the remaining brother for levirate marriage. When Rabbi Shimon deemed both of them exempt, he was referring to <b>the second from this pair and the second from that pair.</b> That is, since one of them was bound to the third brother her relative became exempt as a forbidden relative, and the other of the pair was her rival wife in each of the cases.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>Rava was mistaken about</b> there being <b>four pairs.</b> He mistakenly understood that the mishna spoke of two brothers who married four pairs of relatives. Why does the Gemara assume that he was mistaken? <b>One</b> piece of evidence <b>is that</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> the case using the expression: <b>Or, or.</b> The mishna teaches: Or to a woman and her daughter, or to a woman and her daughter’s daughter, or a woman and her son’s daughter, meaning that not all of the pairs happened before a single <i>yavam</i> for levirate marriage. <b>And further,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>should have said: Rabbi Shimon exempts all four of them,</b> i.e., the four women married to the second brother.",
            "<b>And further, it is taught</b> explicitly in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon exempts both of them from</b> both <b><i>ḥalitza</i> and levirate marriage, as it is stated: “And you shall not take a woman to her sister, to be a rival to her”</b> (Leviticus 18:18). From here it is derived that <b>when</b> two sisters are about to <b>become rival wives one to the other,</b> that is, at the moment they fall before one brother for levirate marriage, <b>you do not have</b> the option of <b>taking even one of them.</b> In other words, levirate marriage to either of them is not permitted, and therefore both are exempt and not only the second. Thus Rava’s explanation is rejected.",
            "<b>Rather, Rav Ashi said</b> an alternative answer to the Gemara’s challenge: <b>If</b> these <i>yevamot</i> <b>happened</b> before him for levirate marriage <b>one after the other, indeed it is so</b> that the first woman bound is like a married woman, and she exempts the second, who is her close relative. However, <b>here we are dealing with</b> a case when both brothers died at once and so both women <b>happened</b> before him <b>at once. And Rabbi Shimon holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who said: It is possible to be precise.</b> He held, contrary to the opinion of the Rabbis, that it was possible to be exact about measurements of time. Therefore, it is possible for two things to truly occur at once, and it is possible that both brothers died simultaneously.",
            "Until this point the Gemara dealt with Rav Oshaya’s opinion stating that according to Rabbi Shimon’s statement, even in the case of one who was born before his brother’s levirate marriage the ruling of a wife of a brother with whom one did not coexist would not apply. However, <b>Rav Pappa said: Rabbi Shimon disagreed</b> in the case where the second brother <b>performed levirate marriage and after that</b> the third brother <b>was born;</b> however, <b>where</b> the third brother <b>was born</b> after the death of the first brother <b>and after that</b> the second brother <b>performed levirate marriage</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>did not disagree.</b> He agreed that in this case she would be forbidden to the newly born brother as the wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist.",
            "As for the question that Rav Oshaya raised with regard to the apparent redundancy of the similar rulings in both the first mishna of the chapter and the mishna on 18b, it can be explained that <b>both were necessary for</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> who prohibited marriage to the wife of a brother with whom one did not coexist in every case. The difficulty raised concerning the apparent redundancy of the first mishna, given the greater scope of the opinion revealed in the second mishna, can be explained by saying that the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> the mishna employing the style: <b>Not</b> only <b>this</b> but <b>also that.</b> That is, the mishna follows the stylistic principle of first teaching the obvious case and continues by saying that this principle applies not only in the obvious case but even in the less obvious case. If so, there is no need to assume that there is an additional dispute with Rabbi Shimon.",
            "The Gemara continues: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Pappa, and this is a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Oshaya:</b> If there were <b>two coexisting brothers, and one died childless, and the second was about to perform levirate betrothal with his <i>yevama</i> but did not manage to perform levirate betrothal before his brother was born, and</b> then the second brother <b>died,</b> then <b>the first</b> woman <b>goes out</b> and is free to remarry without <i>ḥalitza</i> or levirate marriage <b>due to</b> the fact that <b>she was the wife of a brother with whom</b> the third brother <b>did not coexist, and the second either performs <i>ḥalitza</i> or enters into levirate marriage.</b> She was never the rival wife of the widow of the first brother.",

            "<b>Rather, is it not</b> that the latter segment was meant to clarify the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> since the different parts of the <i>baraita</i> enumerate different possibilities? <b>And</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>disagrees in</b> the case when the brother first <b>performed levirate marriage and afterward</b> his brother <b>was born,</b> but he <b>does not disagree in</b> the case where the younger brother <b>was born and afterward</b> the second brother performed <b>levirate marriage.</b> The Gemara summarizes: <b>Conclude from this</b> that Rabbi Shimon disagrees only here, as Rav Pappa explained.",
            "§ The Gemara proceeds to discuss the <i>baraita</i> itself. <b>The Master said: The second was about to perform levirate betrothal with his <i>yevama</i>, but did not manage to perform levirate betrothal with his <i>yevama</i> before his brother was born, and</b> then the second brother <b>died. The first</b> woman <b>goes out</b> and is free to remarry without <i>ḥalitza</i> or levirate marriage <b>due to</b> the fact that <b>she was the wife of a brother with whom</b> the third brother <b>did not coexist, and the second</b> woman <b>performs <i>ḥalitza</i> or enters into levirate marriage.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>Was about to, and what is</b> the meaning of: <b>Did not manage</b> to perform levirate betrothal? The important issue is not his intention but his actions. <b>If he did it, he did it; and if he did not do it, he did not do it.</b>",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the correct interpretation is: <b>Was about to</b> means that he was about to perform levirate betrothal <b>with her consent. Did not manage</b> means that he did not manage to perform it <b>with her consent, but instead</b> did it <b>against her will.</b> Consequently, it is understood that this <i>baraita</i> <b>is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who performs levirate betrothal with his <i>yevama</i> without her consent, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: He acquired</b> her and the betrothal is fully valid, like a consensual levirate betrothal with his <i>yevama</i>; <b>and the Rabbis say: He did not acquire</b> her.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion? <b>He learned</b> this <b>from</b> the case of a <i>yavam</i> engaging in <b>intercourse with a <i>yevama</i>. Just as</b> even <b>non-consensual intercourse with the <i>yevama</i></b> renders her his wife, as the matter does not require her consent, <b>so too, betrothal of a <i>yevama</i></b> can be <b>non-consensual.</b> But <b>the Rabbis learned from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>betrothal in general; just as betrothal in general requires consent</b> by the woman, <b>so too, betrothal of a <i>yevama</i></b> for purposes of levirate marriage <b>requires consent.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>With regard to what</b> principle do Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and the Rabbis <b>disagree? One Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>holds</b> that halakhic <b>matters concerning <i>yevamot</i> must be inferred from matters concerning <i>yevamot</i></b> and not from other areas of <i>halakha</i>. <b>And one Sage,</b> the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that halakhic <b>matters concerning</b> levirate <b>betrothal must be inferred from matters concerning betrothal.</b>",
            "The Gemara clarifies another segment of the <i>baraita</i>. It is taught: If the second brother <b>performed levirate betrothal with her, and afterward his brother was born, or if his brother was born and then he performed levirate betrothal and died, the first</b> woman <b>goes out</b> and is free to remarry <b>because</b> she is <b>the wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist, and the second,</b> the wife of the second brother, <b>performs <i>ḥalitza</i> but does not enter into levirate marriage. Rabbi Shimon says: Intercourse or <i>ḥalitza</i> with one of them exempts her rival wife.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>To which</b> case is <b>Rabbi Shimon referring? If we say</b> that he is referring to the case when <b>his brother was born and then he performed levirate betrothal with her, didn’t you</b> already <b>say</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon did not dispute</b> the case where the brother <b>was born and then ultimately he performed a levirate marriage,</b> and she would be forbidden as the wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist. <b>Rather,</b> one must say that Rabbi Shimon disputed the case where <b>he performed levirate betrothal with her and afterward his brother was born.</b>",
            "Later in the <i>baraita</i> it is taught: If the third brother <b>performed <i>ḥalitza</i> with</b> the wife of the first brother, <b>to whom</b> the second brother <b>performed levirate betrothal, her rival wife is not exempt.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>because the rival wife</b>, the widow of the second brother, has a <b>definite</b> legal status that requires an act to free her to remarry, as she is the wife of a brother with whom he did coexist, <b>whereas</b> the widow of the first brother <b>with whom</b> the second brother <b>performed levirate betrothal</b> had only <b>an uncertain</b> legal status, as it is not clear if she is to be considered truly the wife of the second brother by means of the levirate betrothal or not. <b>And</b> the principle is that <b>an uncertainty does not override a certainty.</b> Therefore, even if the third brother performs <i>ḥalitza</i>, since the status of the first woman’s obligation is uncertain, the status of the <i>ḥalitza</i> itself is uncertain, as it is possible that she did not require <i>ḥalitza</i> at all. Consequently, this <i>ḥalitza</i> is not sufficient to exempt her rival wife. This teaches that he must perform <i>ḥalitza</i> or levirate marriage with the woman who is definitely obligated, and then the other will be exempt.",
            "<b>Rav Menashe bar Zevid sat before Rav Huna. He sat and said: What is the reason that Rabbi Shimon</b> allows the third brother to marry the wife of his brother with whom he did not coexist where she was taken in levirate marriage prior to his birth? The Gemara also wonders: <b>What is Rabbi Shimon’s reason? The reason</b> is <b>as he stated</b> in that same <i>baraita</i>: <b>Since</b> the third brother <b>came and found her in a permitted state, and she was never for a moment prohibited to him</b> he may perform levirate marriage with her.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the question was as follows: Rabbi Shimon gave such a persuasive explanation of his opinion that it raises the question: <b>What is the reason for the Rabbis’</b> opinion? The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states:</b> “Her brother-in-law will…<b>take her to him to be his wife and consummate the levirate marriage [<i>veyibbema</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5). This means that <b>the first levirate bond is still upon her.</b> Even after she is taken as a wife by the second brother, her earlier status as wife of her late first husband is still in effect. The Gemara challenges this: <b>But</b> what about <b>that which we learn</b> in a mishna (38a): If <b>he took</b> his <i>yevama</i> <b>in marriage</b> as his wife, <b>then her</b> legal status is <b>that of his wife in every sense; and Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said:</b> This <b>teaches</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>that he must divorce</b> his <i>yevama</i> <b>with a bill of divorce</b> and she does not also require <i>ḥalitza</i>. <b>And he may remarry her,</b> if he wishes, after the divorce; as the <i>halakha</i> is not ruled in accordance with the opinion that after he performs the mitzva she is once more forbidden to him as his brother’s wife. Why? <b>There, too, let</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>say</b> that the verse states: <b>“And consummate the levirate marriage [<i>veyibbema</i>],”</b> as explained above, meaning that <b>the first levirate bond is still upon her and she should</b> also <b>require <i>ḥalitza</i>.</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>It is different there, as the verse states: “And take her to him to be his wife”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5) to teach that <b>once he has taken her,</b> her legal status is <b>that of his wife in every sense.</b> The Gemara objects: <b>If so, here too,</b> in the case of a brother born after the levirate marriage, according to the opinion of the Rabbis this same principle should apply. The Gemara answers that <b>The Merciful One states: “And consummate the levirate marriage [<i>veyibbema</i>],”</b> that is, even after the marriage she is still considered to be the wife of the deceased brother [<i>yevama</i>] with respect to any brothers who are born later.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What did you see</b> to distinguish in this way and say that once she is married the levirate obligation is totally abrogated with regard to <i>ḥalitza</i>, but that she remains prohibited as the wife of a brother with whom one did not coexist with respect to any brothers born in the future? The Gemara answers: <b>It stands to reason</b> to say: <b>Toss that which is permitted on that which is permitted, and toss that which is prohibited on that which is prohibited.</b> In other words, in cases where the woman becomes permitted to her <i>yavam</i> through levirate marriage, it stands to reason that this permitted state is absolute, but with regard to the prohibition against taking the wife of a brother with whom one did not coexist, it stands to reason that the verse comes to teach that she retains her prohibited status with respect to any brothers born in the future.",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>But according to Rabbi Shimon, who said</b> that <b>since he came and found her in a permitted state</b> a brother born subsequently may perform levirate marriage <b>since she was never for a single moment prohibited to him; however, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> consider the case of <b>one’s maternal</b> half <b>sister,</b> who <b>married his paternal</b> half <b>brother;</b> their marriage was fully permissible since the husband and wife were in no way related to each other. <b>And then his brother was born and</b> the married brother <b>died;</b> in that case, <b>let</b> the sister <b>enter into levirate marriage</b> with her newly born half brother for the same reason, i.e., <b>since he came and found her in a permitted state,</b> as when he was born she was already his brother’s wife.",
            "The Gemara challenges this suggestion: How can you say that? What happened to <b>the prohibition against</b> marrying <b>his sister, to where did it go?</b> This widow is the maternal sister of the newly born brother and is therefore forbidden to him. The Gemara objects: If so, <b>here too,</b> one could have said: What happened to <b>the prohibition</b> against marrying the wife of <b>a brother with whom one did not coexist, to where did it go?</b> In this case as well, the prohibition against marrying the wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist already applied from the first brother, so why does Rabbi Shimon see this as abrogated by marriage? The Gemara answers that the comparison is unsound. <b>This prohibition</b> against marrying one’s sister <b>has no</b> case where it is <b>permitted</b> and so in this case is also not canceled, whereas <b>that prohibition</b> against marrying a brother’s wife <b>has</b> a case where it is <b>permitted,</b> when the mitzva of levirate marriage applies to a second brother and is therefore removed completely before the third brother is born.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The Sages <b>stated a principle about a <i>yevama</i>: Whoever is</b> forbidden <b>by a prohibition of forbidden relations</b> to her <i>yavam</i> <b>neither performs <i>ḥalitza</i> nor enters into levirate marriage</b> and is completely exempt. If she is forbidden by <b>a prohibition</b> resulting from <b>a mitzva</b> or by <b>a prohibition</b> stemming from <b>sanctity,</b> as will be explained later, then since in these cases the obligation of levirate marriage is not fundamentally nullified <b>she performs <i>ḥalitza</i></b> in order to become free of the levirate bond, <b>and</b> due to her prohibition <b>she does not enter into levirate marriage.</b>",
            "The Sages stated another principle: If two sisters who had been married to two brothers who subsequently died happened before the third brother for levirate marriage, and one of those sisters is a close relation to this third brother and is therefore forbidden to him, she is exempt from levirate marriage. But the other, <b>her sister who is her <i>yevama</i>,</b> i.e., her sister-in-law, <b>performs <i>ḥalitza</i> or enters into levirate marriage.</b> In this case, they are not ruled to be two sisters who happened before him simultaneously for levirate marriage, since one of them is prohibited to him as a forbidden relation, and therefore she never actually happened before him at all.",
            "The mishna explains: <b>A prohibition</b> resulting from <b>a mitzva</b> is referring to <b>secondary</b> forbidden <b>relationships,</b> which are prohibited <b>by rabbinic law.</b> The Sages prohibited marriage to certain women who were not forbidden by the Torah but were nevertheless deemed forbidden incestuous relations. <b>A prohibition</b> stemming from <b>sanctity</b> is referring to marriage of <b>a widow to a High Priest, a divorcée or a woman who has performed <i>ḥalitza</i> [<i>ḥalutza</i>] to a common priest, a daughter born from an incestuous or adulterous relationship [<i>mamzeret</i>]</b> or a <b>Gibeonite woman to an Israelite, and</b> also <b>an Israelite woman to a Gibeonite or</b> to <b>a son born from an incestuous or adulterous relationship [<i>mamzer</i>].</b>",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: This <b>principle</b> stated in the mishna about <i>yevamot</i>, <b>what</b> other cases does it <b>add?</b> Since the entire list of cases involving a forbidden relation was already detailed in the first chapter, what is this mishna adding? <b>Rafram bar Pappa said: It comes to include the</b> case of a <b>rival wife of a sexually underdeveloped woman [<i>aylonit</i>],</b> who is incapable of bearing children. Not only does an <i>aylonit</i> herself not enter into levirate marriage, since she is unable to give birth, but her rival wife is exempt as well. <b>And</b> this is <b>like</b> the principle <b>of Rav Asi,</b> who said that the rival wife of an <i>aylonit</i> is forbidden because the <i>aylonit</i> herself remains prohibited to the <i>yavam</i> as the wife of his brother, as she was never rendered permitted by the obligation of levirate marriage. Therefore, her rival wife is the rival wife of someone prohibited as a forbidden relation.",
            "<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that Rafram bar Pappa’s statement was made in a different context. It was taught in the mishna: <b>Whoever is forbidden</b> to her <i>yavam</i> <b>by a prohibition of forbidden relations</b> is completely exempt, which implies that <b>it is</b> specifically in such a case <b>that her rival wife is forbidden. But</b> any case when one wife <b>is not forbidden by a prohibition of forbidden relations</b> but is instead forbidden for some other reason, then <b>her rival wife is not forbidden.</b> This case comes <b>to exclude what? Rafram said: It excludes the rival wife of an <i>aylonit</i>,</b> who requires levirate marriage or <i>ḥalitza</i> because the <i>aylonit</i> is not prohibited as a forbidden relation. <b>And</b> this statement is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Asi.</b>",
            "The mishna states: <b>Her sister who is her <i>yevama</i></b> performs <i>ḥalitza</i> or enters into levirate marriage. The Gemara clarifies this: <b>Whose sister?

When the <i>baraita</i> says: <b>Performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with her,</b> it <b>is referring to a prohibition</b> stemming from <b>sanctity,</b> and by Torah law there is no option of levirate marriage because of the prohibited relation; therefore, only <i>ḥalitza</i> exempts her rival wife.",

How so? <b>As it is written: “They shall be sacred to their God”</b> (Leviticus 21:6), which teaches that there is a positive mitzva of sanctity associated with all prohibitions applying to priests.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> and the levirate marriage is prohibited lest it become confused with another case, then <b>the wife of a paternal brother should not enter into levirate marriage;</b> i.e., by the same logic, although the Torah allowed it, the Sages should have established a <b>rabbinic decree</b> requiring that she perform <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>due to</b> the case of <b>the wife of a maternal brother,</b> who always remains prohibited as a brother’s wife.

            "The Gemara objects further: Then <b>a childless woman should not enter into levirate marriage</b> even though the mitzva applies to her; there should be a rabbinic <b>decree due to</b> the case of <b>a woman who has children.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The Merciful One made levirate marriage dependent upon children;</b> it <b>is well known</b> by everyone that the entire purpose of levirate marriage is to establish one’s brother’s name and that levirate marriage applies only when there are no children. Here, too, there is no likelihood of error.",
            "The Gemara challenges further: <b>The wife of a brother with whom one did coexist should not enter into levirate marriage;</b> there should be a rabbinic <b>decree due to</b> the case of <b>the wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>The Merciful One made levirate marriage dependent upon</b> a common <b>dwelling</b> together and coexistence of brothers, and this <b>is well known</b> by everyone since the matter is explicit in the Torah.",
            "The Gemara continues to object: <b>No woman should enter into levirate marriage;</b> there should be a rabbinic <b>decree due to</b> the case of <b>an <i>aylonit</i>.</b> Since an <i>aylonit</i> may not enter into levirate marriage, all other women should be prohibited by rabbinic decree from doing so to avoid confusion. The Gemara answers: The case of an <i>aylonit</i> is <b>not commonplace,</b> and the Sages did not institute rabbinic decrees on matters that are not common. The Gemara asks: If so, <b>neither a <i>mamzeret</i> nor a Gibeonite woman is commonplace either.</b> Therefore, since the likelihood of taking a <i>mamzeret</i> in levirate marriage is so small, there is no danger that one might think it is permitted to marry a <i>mamzeret</i> even where the mitzva does not apply.",
            "<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that it is necessary to reject the previous suggestion and to offer a different reason: <b>The first</b> act of <b>intercourse</b> is prohibited by rabbinic <b>decree due to</b> the likelihood of <b>a second</b> act of <b>intercourse.</b> Although intercourse the first time with the <i>yevama</i> is the fulfillment of a positive mitzva, which does override the prohibition, once the mitzva is fulfilled with that act there is no longer any positive mitzva involved. Afterward, this <i>yevama</i> becomes prohibited because there is no longer a positive mitzva to override the prohibition. Therefore, due to the possibility that one might engage in intercourse a second time with this woman, the Sages decreed that even the first act is prohibited.",

This shows that although it is possible to perform the mitzva by way of <i>ḥalitza</i>, if he nevertheless performs levirate marriage then the positive mitzva overrides the prohibition and the <i>yevama</i> is thereby acquired as his wife. The Gemara concludes: This is <b>a conclusive refutation,</b> and Rava’s last explanation is rejected. The previous explanation is the correct one: The prohibition is due to rabbinic decree.",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say that</b> this is <b>also a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish</b> and therefore reject his principle?

This implies that the word <i>eleh</i> indicates harshness and not the word <i>el</i>. The Gemara answers: This does not contradict his opinion.

Without the rabbinic decree it would have been permitted for a convert to marry even a close female relative, even his twin sister, who also converted. This is because a convert has the legal status of a newborn, with no family ties. <b>Is it necessary</b> to state that the Sages did not extend that decree to include <b>secondary</b> forbidden <b>relationships?</b> The purpose of the rabbinic prohibitions is to protect the Torah prohibitions, but in the case of converts this particular Torah prohibition does not apply.",

            "§ The mishna states that <b>one who was suspected of</b> relations with <b>a married woman</b> may not marry her even after she divorces her husband.

This contradicts Rav’s statement above that they must divorce only if there were witnesses to the infidelity.",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>Rav</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that <b>the same is true even if another did not come and put an end to the rumor</b> by marrying her. The same principle applies: <b>If there were witnesses</b> to the adultery the court <b>removes her</b> and requires them to divorce, but <b>if there were no witnesses,</b> the court <b>does not remove her.

            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a different <i>baraita</i> that qualifies the previous one: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that the court removes her from the suspected adulterer, <b>said?</b> It is <b>when she has no children</b> from her first husband. <b>But if she has children</b> from him, <b>she is not</b> required to be <b>divorced</b> from the suspected adulterer.

            "The Gemara answers and explains that <b>Rav establishes the mishna</b> as referring only to a case <b>where she has children</b> by her first husband <b>and there are witnesses</b> to her adultery. In such a situation, she and the adulterer must divorce, but without witnesses they are not required to divorce. The Gemara asks: <b>What forced Rav to establish the mishna</b> as referring to a case <b>where she has children and there are witnesses</b> and explain that <b>the reason that</b> the court <b>removes her</b> from the suspected adulterer <b>is because there were witnesses, but that if there were no witnesses they do not remove her?</b> Why does he not <b>establish</b> the mishna as referring to a case <b>where there were no children</b> and that they must divorce <b>even if there were no witnesses?</b>",

            "Rabba bar Rav Huna asks: <b>Still, is this comparable?

Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If he testified: <b>I killed him, his wife may not be married</b> at all based on that evidence, as his testimony is unreliable, but if he said: <b>We killed him, his wife may be married</b> to anyone other than those witnesses.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara clarifies: <b>The reason that</b> the agent may not marry the divorcée applies specifically in a case where he brings the bill of divorce <b>from a country overseas, as</b> in this case <b>we,</b> the court, <b>rely upon his</b> testimony to validate the bill of divorce. <b>But</b> an agent who brings a bill of divorce <b>from Eretz Yisrael</b> need not make any verbal declaration, and <b>since we,</b> the court, <b>do not rely upon his</b> testimony but upon the written bill of divorce alone, <b>he may marry his wife,</b> i.e., the divorcée, since it does not arouse suspicion.",

            "In the case of three brothers, two of whom were married to several women, including two sisters, and the two married brothers later died, and their wives happened before the <i>yavam</i> for levirate marriage, if the <i>yavam</i> <b>performed <i>ḥalitza</i> with the sisters</b> who were among the wives, <b>the rival wives are not</b> thereby <b>exempt.</b> One can deduce from here that since the <i>yavam</i> cannot consummate the levirate marriage with the sisters, as each is the sister of a woman with whom he has a levirate bond, then the act of <i>ḥalitza</i> is invalid, and invalid <i>ḥalitza</i> is ineffective in exempting their rival wives. It is concluded from here that even Shmuel requires valid <i>ḥalitza</i>, i.e., <i>ḥalitza</i> that occurs when there is a possibility of consummating the levirate marriage. According to this rationale, however, Shmuel’s ruling in the above case is difficult: With regard to the second sister, <b>when there exists</b> the possibility for <b>Shimon’s <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> i.e., the <i>ḥalitza</i> of the second brother who did not yet perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, to be <b>a valid <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> would it be allowed for <b>Reuven,</b> the brother who already did <i>ḥalitza</i> with one sister, <b>to perform invalid <i>ḥalitza</i> with</b> her?",
            "The Gemara resolves this difficulty by reinterpreting Shmuel’s statement. <b>What</b> does it mean <b>that it says: One performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with each of them, that</b> Shmuel <b>stated?</b> Shmuel <b>says that with regard to the middle one,</b> i.e., the third sister, one of the two brothers performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with her.

            "§ Apropos of Shmuel’s statement, the Gemara examines <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Shmuel said:</b> In the case of three brothers, two of whom were married to several women, including two sisters, and the two married brothers later died, and their wives happened before the <i>yavam</i> for levirate marriage, if the <i>yavam</i> <b>performed <i>ḥalitza</i> with the sisters, the rival wives are not</b> thereby <b>exempt.</b> But if he performed <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>with the rival wives, the sisters are exempt.</b> Similarly, if he gave a bill of divorce to one of these women, whereby he would no longer be permitted to consummate the levirate marriage with them due to a rabbinic decree, and he then <b>performed <i>ḥalitza</i> with the woman who received a bill of divorce, the rival wife is not</b> thereby <b>exempt.</b> Since he was unable to consummate the levirate marriage with her, the <i>ḥalitza</i> performed with her was invalid, and invalid <i>ḥalitza</i> does not exempt the rival wife. If he performed the act of <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>with the rival wife,</b> then <b>the woman who received a bill of divorce is exempt.</b>",
            "The ruling is similar with regard to the case where the <i>yavam</i> performed <i>ma’amar</i>, i.e., levirate betrothal, to one of the wives. If <b>he</b> then <b>performed <i>ḥalitza</i> with</b> the woman <b>who received</b> his <b>levirate betrothal</b> then <b>the rival wife is not exempt.</b> Indeed, this <i>ḥalitza</i> is invalid as well, for once the <i>yavam</i> performed levirate betrothal, this act can be rescinded only by means of a bill of divorce. Because the woman needs to receive a bill of divorce in addition to the <i>ḥalitza</i> in order to exempt her from her bond, the <i>ḥalitza</i> is considered invalid and is not sufficient to exempt the rival wife. But if the <i>yavam</i> performed <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>with the rival wife,</b> then <b>she who received</b> his <b>levirate betrothal is exempt</b> from <i>ḥalitza</i> and requires only a bill of divorce.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> in the two cases? Why, if he performed <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>with the sisters, are the rival wives not exempt?</b> This is because the sister <b>is</b> related <b>to him</b> as <b>the sister of a woman with whom he has a levirate bond.</b> Since, under these circumstances he would not be permitted to consummate the levirate marriage with her, her <i>ḥalitza</i> is then considered invalid <i>ḥalitza</i>.

The Gemara answers: <b>Shmuel holds</b> that <b>the levirate bond is not substantial,</b> and therefore the levirate bond does not create a relationship between the <i>yavam</i> and the sisters such that the prohibition would be extended to the rival wives as well.",

The Gemara challenges: <b>But he said rival wives</b> in the plural, seeming to refer to both rival wives? The Gemara answers: He spoke of <b>rival wives in general.</b> In other words, this is a general <i>halakha</i>, and for that reason it was stated in the plural. However, it does not mean that both the rival wife of the first sister and the rival wife of the second sister are not exempt.",

Being as she is forbidden to him, her <i>ḥalitza</i> is invalid and should not exempt Rachel.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Shmuel also</b> meant to distinguish between a case where <b>he began and</b> the case where <b>he did not begin.</b> This is how his statement should be understood: If <b>he began</b> by performing <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>with</b> one of <b>the sisters, he may not finish by</b> performing a second act of <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>with</b> any one of <b>the rival wives, as we learned</b> in a mishna (40b): <b>A man is forbidden</b> to marry <b>the rival wife of a close relative of his <i>ḥalutza</i>.</b> Due to this prohibition, <i>ḥalitza</i> performed with the second rival wife is invalid <i>ḥalitza</i> and would not exempt the second sister.

The Gemara objects: <b>But didn’t the Master say</b> that <b>they did not succeed in finalizing the matter</b> and establishing Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri’s amendment <b>before the times of trouble came</b> in the form of the anti-Jewish decrees, and so this ruling was never actually established? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: After his</b> time, other Sages <b>returned</b> to this issue and <b>established</b> this amendment in accordance with his opinion.",
            "§ Apropos of the statement of Shmuel with regard to a woman who received a bill of divorce and a woman who received levirate betrothal, <b>a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages:"
        ],
        [
            "If two women happened before a single <i>yavam</i> for levirate marriage, and one is <b>a woman who received a bill of divorce and</b> the other is <b>a woman who received levirate betrothal, which has precedence</b> for <i>ḥalitza</i>? <b>Is the woman who received a bill of divorce preferred because he began the</b> process of <b><i>ḥalitza</i> with her,</b> as presenting a bill of divorce represents the first step separating the woman from him? <b>Or perhaps the woman who received levirate betrothal is preferred, because she is closest to</b> being able to enter into permitted <b>sexual intercourse.</b> The act of levirate betrothal is generally done just prior to levirate marriage and is equivalent to the act of betrothal in non-levirate contexts. As a result, levirate betrothal strengthens the connection between the woman and the <i>yavam</i>. For this reason, it may be preferable to perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with the woman who received levirate betrothal.",
            "<b>Rav Ashi said: Come</b> and <b>hear:</b> The Sages disputed the ruling with regard to a <i>yavam</i> who performed levirate betrothal with one sister-in-law and then performed it with her rival wife as well, or conversely, gave both women a bill of divorce. In such cases, would the second levirate betrothal or bill of divorce be effective? It was taught: <b>And Rabban Gamliel concedes that a bill of divorce is effective after levirate betrothal.</b> Therefore, the bill of divorce that the <i>yavam</i> gave to one <i>yevama</i> after having performed levirate betrothal with the other <i>yevama</i> is effective to some degree. Similarly, Rabban Gamliel concedes that <b>levirate betrothal</b> performed <b>after a bill of divorce is effective.</b>",
            "<b>If the bill of divorce is preferred</b> to levirate betrothal, then <b>levirate betrothal</b> performed <b>afterward should not be effective.</b> The opposite would hold true as well: <b>And if levirate betrothal is preferred,</b> then <b>a bill of divorce</b> given <b>afterward should not be effective. Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> this statement <b>that the two are equivalent to each other?</b> The Gemara summarizes: Indeed, <b>conclude from</b> this statement that they are equivalent. Therefore, neither the woman who received a bill of divorce nor the woman who received levirate betrothal has precedence for <i>ḥalitza</i>.",
            "§ <b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> In a case of <b>two sisters</b> who became <b><i>yevamot</i>,</b> i.e., the two sisters were married to two brothers who died, <b>who happened before one <i>yavam</i></b> for levirate marriage, if <b>he performed <i>ḥalitza</i> with the first</b> sister, then <b>she is permitted</b> to marry any man. If <b>he performed <i>ḥalitza</i> with the second</b> sister, then <b>she is permitted</b> to do so as well.",
            "If <b>the first</b> sister <b>died</b> before the <i>yavam</i> was able to perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with her, then he <b>is permitted to</b> take <b>the second</b> sister in levirate marriage, for even if he had actually been married to the first sister, one is permitted to marry the sister of his wife after his wife dies. <b>And needless to say,</b> if <b>the second</b> sister <b>died, then he is permitted to</b> take <b>the first</b> sister in levirate marriage <b>because she would be</b> considered <b>a <i>yevama</i> who was permitted</b> at the time that she happened before the <i>yavam</i> for levirate marriage; <b>and</b> then later <b>forbidden</b> as the sister of a woman with whom he has a levirate bond when the second sister happened before him for levirate marriage; <b>and subsequently became permitted</b> by the death of the second sister. Therefore, <b>she can return</b> completely <b>to her original permitted status.</b>",
            "<b>However, Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> If <b>the second</b> sister <b>dies, he is permitted to</b> take <b>the first.

The reason is <b>that any <i>yevama</i> to whom the verse “her brother-in-law will have intercourse with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5) <b>cannot be applied at the time that she happens</b> before him for levirate marriage because she was forbidden to him at that moment, <b>is then</b> forever considered to be <b>like the wife of a brother who has children, and she is forbidden</b> to him. Because the second sister was forbidden to the <i>yavam</i> at the time that she happened before him for levirate marriage, being the sister of a woman with whom he had a levirate bond, she can never again be permitted to him.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rav not accept that reason?

The Gemara answers: <b>This applies only when</b> the prohibition <b>that stands before her</b> and prevents the levirate marriage <b>is the prohibition against marrying the sister of one’s wife, which is prohibited by Torah</b> law. Therefore, if the woman who happens before the <i>yavam</i> for levirate marriage is his wife’s sister, he is prohibited from performing levirate marriage even if his wife dies afterward. <b>But here</b> the prohibition to marry the sister stems from a relationship created by <b>a levirate bond.</b> This prohibition is <b>by rabbinic</b> law, and therefore the bond does not render her forbidden to him forever.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> from the mishna: In the case of <b>four brothers, two of whom were married to two sisters, and those married to the sisters died, then those</b> sisters <b>must perform <i>ḥalitza</i> and may not enter into levirate marriage.

            "The Gemara suggests: <b>And let</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>say to him: What is</b> the meaning of the ruling to <b>perform <i>ḥalitza</i>?

The Gemara responds: The mishna <b>teaches: Then those</b> women perform <i>ḥalitza</i>.

The Gemara asks further: <b>And let him say</b> that the mishna is referring only to the specific case <b>where</b> <i>the yavam</i> <b>performed <i>ḥalitza</i> with the first</b> sister <b>first.</b> As a result, there was no longer any possibility of rendering the second sister permitted, as Rabbi Yoḥanan permitted levirate marriage only in the case where <i>ḥalitza</i> was performed with the second sister first.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And let him say to him</b> a different reason for the ruling of the mishna: It is due to a rabbinic <b>decree lest</b> the second brother <b>die, and it is prohibited to negate the mitzva of levirate marriage.</b> Perhaps for this reason it would be forbidden to consummate the levirate marriage in the case where two sisters happened before him for levirate marriage, and not due to the prohibition proscribing the sister of a woman with whom he has a levirate bond.

The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> is cited explicitly <b>in the latter clause</b> of the mishna, it can be deduced that <b>the first clause is not</b> according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar.</b> Therefore, this ruling cannot be attributed to Rabbi Elazar.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And let him say to him</b> that here the reference is to a situation <b>where</b> the two brothers died at once, and consequently both of the women <b>happened before</b> the <i>yevamin</i> for levirate marriage <b>at the same time. And</b> this mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who says: It is possible to be precise.</b> It is possible to determine that two events occurred at exactly the same moment, both sisters were forbidden at the time that they happened before the brothers-in-law.

In these situations, <b>I could apply</b> the ruling that <b>she who is forbidden to this</b> brother <b>is permitted to that</b> brother, <b>as well as</b> the ruling that <b>when her sister is also her <i>yevama</i> she may either perform <i>ḥalitza</i> or enter into levirate marriage.</b>",
            "<b>But Rav Yehuda interprets</b> these principles as applying only to those cases found in the list <b>from</b> the <b>mother-in-law of</b> the <i>yavam</i> <b>and onward, but not to the six cases at the beginning,</b> which include his daughter, and his wife’s daughter, and their descendants.",
            "<b>What is the reason</b> for Rav Yehuda’s distinction? <b>This is because you find</b> the scenario where two women who are candidates for levirate marriage are both sisters as well as the daughters of the two <i>yevamin</i> only in a case where the women are the daughters of the <i>yevamin</i> <b>through rape, but you cannot find it</b> in a case where they are his daughters <b>through marriage.</b> If one brother married a woman and had a daughter with her, then this woman, the wife of a brother who has children, is forbidden to all of his brothers. Therefore, it would be impossible for another brother to have a daughter with that same woman, and therefore the two daughters could never be sisters. The scenario of daughters who are also sisters is possible only when the first brother raped a woman and gave birth to a daughter, such that the woman is not forbidden to his brothers. If one of the brothers then had a daughter with this woman and both daughters married other brothers who then died, it is possible that these daughters would happen before their fathers for levirate marriage.",
            "Rav Yehuda maintains that the current mishna <b>deals with</b> cases of <b>marriage but does not deal with</b> cases of <b>rape,</b> and therefore he does not apply the principles governing sisters to those cases.",

Since you</b> can <b>find this</b> scenario, <b>if</b> the statement <b>wants</b> to deal with cases of <b>rape, let it; if it wants</b> to deal with cases of <b>marriage, let it.</b> It is preferable to explain this matter with regard to cases of marriage, but if that is not possible, it can still be explained as dealing with cases of rape. <b>However, it cannot</b> be explained as referring to <b>the wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist.</b> Even according to the opinion of Abaye, this case cannot be included, <b>since you can find</b> a situation where two sisters happen before two brothers for levirate marriage while each woman is the wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist only <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, while</b> such a case <b>cannot be found according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> And Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>does not deal with</b> cases that are subject to <b>dispute.</b>",
            "<b>And Rav Safra interprets</b> these principles as applying to the <b>wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist, and you</b> can <b>find this</b> scenario <b>in the case</b> of the <b>six brothers and according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon. And your mnemonic</b> to remember how this might come about <b>is</b> as follows: <b>Died, born, consummated the levirate marriage; died, born, consummated the levirate marriage.</b>",
            "How could this come about? There were two brothers, <b>Reuven and Shimon,</b> who were <b>married</b> to <b>two sisters.</b> And there were two other brothers, <b>Levi and Yehuda,</b> who were <b>married</b> to <b>two unrelated women. Reuven died, Yissakhar was born, and Levi consummated the levirate marriage</b> with Reuven’s wife. Afterward, <b>Shimon died, Zevulun was born, and Yehuda consummated the levirate marriage</b> with Shimon’s wife. Later, <b>Levi and Yehuda died childless and</b> these two sisters <b>happened before Yissakhar and Zevulun for levirate marriage.</b>",
            "In this scenario, the woman who had been Reuven’s wife <b>is forbidden to this</b> brother, Yissakhar, as the wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist, because he was not alive at the same time as Reuven, and yet <b>she is</b> nevertheless <b>permitted to this</b> brother, Zevulun, because when Zevulun was born this woman was already the wife of Levi, a brother with whom he did coexist. According to Rabbi Shimon, the fact that she had previously been the wife of Reuven, a brother with whom he did not coexist, is not taken into account. Similarly, with regard to Shimon’s wife, we find that <b>she who is forbidden to this</b> one <b>is permitted to that</b> one. Shimon’s wife is forbidden to Zevulun as the wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist, but she is nevertheless permitted to Yissakhar. Accordingly, the situation of <b>her sister who is her <i>yevama</i>,</b> i.e., two sisters who are <i>yevamot</i> and yet are allowed to perform levirate marriage, can be applied to this case as well.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need to assume that this is referring to a scenario where <b>Yehuda consummated the levirate marriage? You can find this</b> possibility <b>in</b> a case where <b>Yehuda did not consummate the levirate marriage as well.</b> This scenario can also take place with only five brothers and without Yehuda: Reuven and Shimon were married to two sisters, Reuven died, Yissakhar was born, and Levi consummated the levirate marriage with Reuven’s wife. Then Shimon died and Zevulun was born. If Levi then dies, Levi’s wife is forbidden to Yissakhar as the wife of his brother Reuven, with whom he did not coexist, but she would be permitted to Zevulun because she was already the wife of Levi when Zevulun was born. Shimon’s wife would be forbidden to Zevulun but permitted to Yissakhar.",
            "The Gemara responds: This is <b>due to the rival wife.</b> It was taught in this way in order to make the principle applicable not only to the wives, but also to their rival wives. In this scenario, Levi and Yehuda were previously married to two sisters who then became the rival wives of a wife of a brother with whom one did not coexist. This allows the ruling to apply to the case of rival wives as well. The Gemara notes: <b>This works out well</b> if the mishna comes to include only <b>a rival wife</b> herself, but <b>what can be said</b> about <b>the rival wife of a rival wife?</b> How can this case explained? If one aims to include all of the details of the mishna in Rabbi Ḥiyya’s principle, then the mishna must be referring not only to a case involving the brothers’ rival wives, but also to the rival wives of those rival wives mentioned in the mishna.",
            "The Gemara answers: Therefore, one must include a case <b>where Gad and Asher subsequently consummated the levirate marriage</b> with these women <b>as well.</b> That is, initially there were two other brothers, Gad and Asher, who consummated the levirate marriage with the previous wives of Levi and Yehuda, each of whom had taken one of the wives of Reuven and Shimon. Later, when Gad and Asher died, their previous wives, who are the rival wives of the rival wives of Reuven and Shimon’s wives, happen before Yissakhar and Zevulun for levirate marriage.",

The legal force of levirate betrothal is limited to preventing the rival wife of the sister from performing levirate marriage; she is exempt from both levirate marriage and <i>ḥalitza</i>.",
            "<b>Rabbi Avin said: We, too, learn</b> in the mishna a proof that levirate betrothal is not a full-fledged act of acquisition, even according to Beit Shammai.

From here it can be deduced: If they already married them, <b>yes, they may maintain them.</b> However, marrying them <b><i>ab initio</i>, no,</b> this is prohibited due to the prohibition against marrying the sister of a woman with whom one has a levirate bond."
        ],
        [
            "<b>And if it enters your mind</b> that <b>according to Beit Shammai levirate betrothal acquires</b> the woman <b>as a full-fledged acquisition,</b> then this matter could potentially have been resolved <i>ab initio</i>: <b>This</b> brother <b>should perform levirate betrothal and acquire</b> one sister, <b>and that</b> brother <b>should perform levirate betrothal and acquire</b> the other sister. As there is no prohibition whatsoever involved in performing levirate betrothal, the concern for violating a prohibition by consummating the levirate marriage with a sister of a woman with whom he has a levirate bond is avoided; he only betroths her, but does not engage in sexual intercourse with her. After the betrothal, the levirate bond of her sister is dissolved and he can freely consummate the levirate marriage with her.",
            "The Gemara objects: <b>Rather, what</b> then? If levirate betrothal does not serve to fully acquire the woman, what is the alternative? It must be that according to Beit Shammai levirate betrothal <b>precludes</b> the rival wife from entering levirate marriage with <b>a complete preclusion.</b> If so, there is an additional potential scenario: <b>This one should perform levirate betrothal</b> with one sister <b>and preclude</b> the second sister from entering levirate marriage, <b>and that one should perform levirate</b> betrothal with the second sister <b>and preclude</b> the first sister from entering levirate marriage. In this way, the <i>yevamin</i> can consummate the levirate marriage with the sisters <i>ab initio</i> as well. Yet the mishna does not allow for this possibility.",
            "<b>Rather, what have you to say?</b> One must assert that <b>levirate betrothal</b> performed <b>in</b> circumstances where it is <b>permitted</b> to perform levirate marriage, i.e. where there is no prohibition with regard to the close relative of a woman with whom the <i>yavam</i> has a levirate bond, completely <b>precludes</b> the rival wife from entering levirate marriage. However, levirate betrothal performed <b>in</b> circumstances where it is <b>forbidden</b> to perform levirate marriage, <b>does not preclude</b> entering levirate marriage. Therefore, in the case of two sisters who happen simultaneously before two brothers for levirate marriage, the sisters cannot be precluded from entering levirate marriage via levirate betrothal. <b>So too</b> here, with regard to <b>levirate betrothal</b> performed by the third brother, the same distinction can be made. <b>Even according to the one who said that levirate betrothal acquires</b> a woman <b>as a full-fledged acquisition,</b> just like marriage, there is the following difference: <b>Levirate betrothal under permitted</b> circumstances <b>acquires</b> the woman, but levirate betrothal <b>under forbidden circumstances does not acquire</b> the woman. Therefore, there is no proof as to the nature of levirate betrothal according to the opinion of Beit Shammai from the first mishna in the chapter.",

Rather, it precludes</b> entering levirate marriage <b>and</b> yet <b>leaves a remnant</b> of the levirate bond in place. Accordingly, levirate betrothal precludes the rival wife’s entering levirate marriage to the degree that the <i>yavam</i> is not required to divorce the woman he betrothed, but the levirate bond with the rival wife remains to the extent that he must still perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with her.",
            "<b>Rabbi Avin said: We,</b> too, <b>learn</b> this statement from the mishna, where it states: <b>Beit Shammai say: They may maintain them</b> as their wives. From here it can be deduced: <b>Yes, they may maintain them</b> as their wives after the fact; <b>no,</b> they are not allowed to marry them <b><i>ab initio</i>. And if it enters your mind</b> to say that, <b>according to Beit Shammai, levirate betrothal precludes entering</b> levirate marriage as <b>a complete preclusion,</b> then <b>this</b> brother <b>should perform levirate betrothal and preclude</b> one sister from levirate marriage, <b>and that</b> brother <b>should perform levirate betrothal and preclude</b> the other sister from levirate marriage. The Gemara challenges this conclusion: <b>But didn’t</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> that <b>Beit Shammai say: His wife remains with him, and this other is sent away due to</b> her status <b>as a sister of his wife?</b> This indicates that she is exempt from levirate marriage and does not even require <i>ḥalitza</i>.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> one must resolve this by asserting that <b>a <i>yevama</i> who is suitable for all of</b> the aspects of levirate marriage <b>is</b> also <b>suitable for part of it.</b> If a <i>yevama</i> is eligible for both levirate marriage and <i>ḥalitza</i> when she happens before the brothers, as in the case cited in the present mishna where the woman who happened before the third brother was permitted to enter into levirate marriage, she is eligible for part of it. This indicates that if the <i>yavam</i> does not take her in levirate marriage but performs only levirate betrothal, the levirate betrothal has sufficient legal force to preclude the rival wife completely. However, <b>a <i>yevama</i> who is not suitable for all of the</b> aspects of levirate marriage <b>is</b> also <b>not suitable for a part of it.</b> If the <i>yevama</i> is not eligible for levirate marriage, such as in the case referred to in the first mishna of this chapter, where both women happened simultaneously so that the <i>yavam</i> is not permitted to consummate the levirate marriage with either woman, she is not suitable for part of it. In that case, if the <i>yavam</i> performs levirate betrothal, it does not have the legal force to affect a total preclusion.",
            "§ With regard to Beit Shammai’s opinion about levirate betrothal, <b>Rabba asks: Does levirate betrothal, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai, create</b> a full-fledged <b>marriage</b> bond? <b>Or, does it</b> merely <b>create betrothal,</b> similar to all other acts of betrothal? <b>Abaye said to him: With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> do you ask this?",
            "<b>If we say</b> it pertains <b>to inheriting</b> from <b>her</b> when she dies, <b>and to becoming ritually impure for her</b> if he is a priest, <b>and to nullifying her vows,</b> all of which are rights and obligations acquired by marriage, this is difficult. <b>Now,</b> with regard to <b>a betrothed woman in general,</b> i.e., a woman who was betrothed by Torah law, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One does not enter acute mourning</b> on the day of the death of <b>his betrothed wife, nor can he become ritually impure for her</b> if she dies if he is a priest. <b>Similarly, she does not enter acute mourning for him and</b> is <b>not</b> obligated <b>to become ritually impure for him.</b> If <b>she dies, he does not inherit from her;</b> if <b>he dies, she collects</b> the payment of <b>her marriage contract,</b> In a case where <b>he performed</b> only <b>levirate betrothal with her, is it necessary to say</b> that he does not inherit from her, nor does he become ritually impure for her? Therefore, this <i>halakha</i> is obvious and Rabba’s question seems superfluous.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the question must relate <b>to the matter of delivery</b> of the woman <b>to</b> the husband under <b>a wedding canopy. What is</b> the ruling with regard to this? Is the <i>yavam</i> obligated to enter the wedding canopy in the manner that he would with any other betrothed woman, or not? This is the dilemma: Does levirate betrothal <b>create</b> a full-fledged <b>marriage</b> bond, whereby the <i>yevama</i> <b>would not require</b> further <b>delivery to a wedding canopy? Or, does</b> levirate betrothal <b>perhaps create</b> only <b>betrothal,</b> whereby <b>she would require delivery to a wedding canopy?</b>",
            "Abaye <b>said to him</b> that this question is not necessary, as well: <b>Now,</b> if <b>he did not perform levirate betrothal with her</b> at all, <b>it is written: “Her brother-in-law will have intercourse with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5). It is deduced from this verse that he can take her even <b>against her will. Is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to say <b>that</b> if <b>he performed levirate betrothal with her,</b> even without a wedding canopy, that he is allowed to engage in sexual intercourse with her?",
            "Rabba <b>said to him:</b> This question is relevant, as <b>I say</b> that <b>anyone who performs levirate betrothal with his <i>yevama</i> causes the levirate bond to be removed from him,</b> and he is no longer considered subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of levirate marriage. Instead, a standard <b>bond of betrothal applies to him.</b> Therefore, it is appropriate to ask if this act of levirate betrothal is similar to a standard betrothal insofar as the wedding canopy is concerned, and consequently the woman would be required to enter the wedding canopy. Alternatively, perhaps the <i>halakhot</i> of levirate marriage still apply somewhat, in which case the woman would not be required to enter a wedding canopy in order to become married, similar to a standard <i>yevama</i> to whom levirate betrothal was not performed. Does the performance of levirate betrothal weaken the capacity of intercourse to establish levirate marriage on its own? <b>What</b> is the halakhic ruling here?",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an answer from what is taught in a mishna (<i>Nedarim</i> 74a): What is the ruling with regard to the nullification of vows for <b>a widow</b> who is <b>waiting for her <i>yavam</i>, whether</b> she is waiting for <b>a single <i>yavam</i> or two <i>yevamin</i>? Rabbi Eliezer says: Let him nullify</b> her vows. The <i>yavam</i> may nullify her vows as though he were her husband. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> This holds true only if she is bonded to <b>a single <i>yavam</i>, but not</b> to <b>two. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> It does <b>not</b> hold true, neither <b>to one</b> <i>yavam</i> <b>nor to two</b> <i>yevamin</i>. They may not nullify her vows.",
            "<b>And we discussed this</b> issue, interpreting the various opinions: <b>Granted, Rabbi Akiva holds that the levirate bond is not substantial, even in</b> the case of <b>one</b> <i>yavam</i>. In his opinion, the levirate obligation does not create a marriage bond at all, even if there is only a single <i>yavam</i>. And according <b>to Rabbi Yehoshua, the levirate bond with one</b> <i>yavam</i> <b>is substantial.</b> The <i>yevama</i> undoubtedly requires this <i>yavam</i> for levirate marriage, and therefore she is considered to be like his wife. <b>But with two</b> <i>yevamin</i>, <b>the levirate bond is not substantial,</b> since it is not clear which brother will consummate the levirate marriage with her. <b>However, Rabbi Eliezer, if</b> he <b>indeed holds that the levirate bond is substantial,</b> his opinion is difficult. <b>Granted,</b> if there is <b>one</b> <i>yavam</i>, <b>he can nullify</b> her vows, <b>but</b> if there are <b>two,</b> why should only one of them suffice to nullify her vows, as it is not yet clear which of them will eventually marry her?",

            "This interpretation can resolve Rabba’s question. <b>Granted, if you say</b> levirate betrothal <b>creates</b> a full-fledged <b>marriage, it is due to that</b> reason that the <i>yavam</i> <b>can nullify</b> her vows just as a full-fledged husband does. <b>However, if you say</b> that levirate betrothal merely <b>creates betrothal, how can he nullify</b> the vows?

            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> an alternate explanation: <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> could have <b>said to you: And as for Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak, does this</b> resolution that the mishna is only referring to a case where the father and the <i>yavam</i> can nullify her vows together <b>work out well? Did the</b> mishna <b>teach</b> that <b>they</b> can <b>nullify</b> her vows? <b>It teaches</b> that <b>he</b> can <b>nullify</b> her vows in the singular, implying that he nullifies the vows alone and not in conjunction with anyone else. <b>Rather,</b> the mishna must be explained differently: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> It is a case where the <i>yavam</i>, regardless of whether or not he performed levirate betrothal, did not want to consummate the levirate marriage or perform <i>ḥalitza</i>. Therefore, the <i>yevama</i> <b>stood in court</b> so as to compel him to consummate the levirate marriage or perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>and it ruled that he</b> must supply <b>her sustenance.</b> Because she is bound to him and cannot marry another, the court ruled that he was responsible for her livelihood.",
            "<b>And</b> this is in accordance with the statement that <b>Rav Pineḥas</b> said <b>in the name of Rava, as Rav Pineḥas said in the name of Rava: Any woman who makes a vow, makes her vow with the consent of her husband.</b> Because she is dependent upon her husband for her livelihood, she does not act without his consent. In this case, because the <i>yavam</i> is responsible to supply the <i>yevama</i> with sustenance, it is assumed that her vows are also made with his consent. It is for this reason that he can nullify her vows without her father. Consequently, no conclusive proof can be derived from here with regard to the strength of acquisition through levirate betrothal."

            "The Gemara raises a question from the opposite perspective: <b>And according to Rav Naḥman,</b> who deduced from the earlier mishna that the levirate bond is not substantial, the deduction <b>of Rav Ashi</b> that the levirate bond is substantial is <b>difficult.

            "The Gemara states: <b>This works out well if he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yirmeya, who said</b> with regard to a seeming contradiction between this mishna and an earlier mishna (13a): The <i>mishnayot</i> are <b>disjointed; he who taught this</b> mishna <b>did not teach that</b> mishna. The earlier mishna established the principle that if a man was married to two women, one of whom was a forbidden relative, and he divorced the forbidden relative before he died, then the rival wife is no longer prohibited to the brothers.",
            "This dispute is based upon the following: <b>This <i>tanna</i></b> from the earlier mishna <b>holds that death determines</b> her status when <b>she happens</b> before the brothers, i.e., the crucial moment for determining whether the prohibition relating to rival wives applies is the moment at which the brother dies. In other words, whether the <i>yevama</i> is permitted to the <i>yavam</i> is determined by the status of the <i>yevama</i> at that given moment. Therefore, in the case where he had married a forbidden relative and later divorced her, the rival wife would be permitted. <b>And this <i>tanna</i></b> of our present mishna <b>holds that the original marriage determines</b> her status when <b>she happens</b> before the brothers. If, at the time the woman was married to the deceased brother she was forbidden as a close relative, and her rival wife was likewise forbidden as the rival wife of a forbidden relative, then even though the status of the relative had changed at the time of the death of the brother, both she and her rival wife remain forbidden.",
            "According to this opinion, it is indeed possible to state that the phrase <b>this is</b> comes <b>to exclude</b> the case where <b>he married</b> one woman <b>and ultimately divorced</b> the other. According to this mishna, in that case, the rival wives would be prohibited. <b>However, if he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rava, who said: Actually,</b> understand <b>this</b> to be the opinion of <b>a single <i>tanna</i>, and he teaches</b> the mishna employing the style: <b>This, and it is unnecessary to say that,</b> a difficulty remains. According to Rava, both <i>mishnayot</i> maintain the position that in the case where the <i>yavam</i> married one woman and ultimately divorced the other, the rival wife would be permitted. If that is the case, <b>what</b> does the phrase <b>this is</b> come <b>to exclude?</b> In what case would the rival wife be prohibited to the <i>yavam</i>? The Gemara responds: <b>Perforce</b> Rav Naḥman <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yirmeya</b> with regard to his interpretation of the <i>mishnayot</i>.",
            "The Gemara raises a question from a different perspective: <b>And according to Rava,</b> who maintains that in both cases the rival wife is permitted, <b>this works out well if he holds in accordance</b> with the opinion <b>of Rav Ashi</b> that the levirate bond is substantial. In that case the phrase <b>this is</b> comes <b>to exclude</b> the case where <b>he died without divorcing his wife.</b> In this case the rival wife is forbidden because the entire time she was the rival wife of a forbidden relative by levirate bond. <b>If, however, he holds in accordance</b> with the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman</b> in this matter, <b>what</b> does the phrase <b>this is</b> come <b>to exclude?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Perforce</b> Rava <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ashi.</b> Accordingly, with regard to this <i>halakha</i> there is a connection between the various opinions as to how to interpret the <i>mishnayot</i> and the dispute.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And</b> if <b>any of these</b> fifteen women who are prohibited as forbidden relatives <b>had undergone a betrothal or divorce</b> whose status <b>is uncertain</b> with the deceased brother, <b>then those</b> women who were their <b>rival wives</b> must <b>perform <i>ḥalitza</i> and may not enter into levirate marriage</b> since they are possibly the rival wives of forbidden relatives.

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara remarks: <b>But yet when</b> discussing <b>divorce, it does not teach</b> the case where it is <b>uncertain</b> if the bill of divorce <b>is closer to him, and uncertain if it is closer to her.</b> It would have been appropriate to describe this case, as it parallels the case involving the object of betrothal. He could have tossed it in such a way that it was not clear to whom the bill was closer.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> the mishna did not present this situation as well? <b>Rabba said:</b> When this type of uncertainty exists, the performance of <i>ḥalitza</i> is not mandatory, as <b>this woman,</b> the rival wife, <b>has the presumptive status of being permitted</b> to marry a man <b>from the</b> general <b>public.</b> At the time of her marriage she was rendered a rival wife of a forbidden relative. <b>And due to an uncertainty</b> alone <b>would you render her forbidden</b> to the general public until she performs <i>ḥalitza</i>, simply because it is unclear to us whether or not the forbidden relative had indeed been divorced? <b>Do not render her forbidden due to an uncertainty.</b> This is not, however, the case with the various bills of divorce mentioned in the mishna, for they are all certainly considered effective bills of divorce, even if the circumstances involved raise some questions or doubts.",
            "<b>Abaye said to him: If that is so, let us say</b> in the case of <b>betrothal as well</b> that <b>this woman,</b> the rival wife, <b>has the presumptive status of being permitted to the <i>yavam</i></b> before he betrothed the forbidden relative, <b>and due to the uncertainty</b> whether she is the rival wife of a forbidden relative <b>would you come and render her forbidden? Do not render her forbidden due to an uncertainty.</b> Consequently, you should permit her to enter into levirate marriage.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>There,</b> with regard to betrothal, the <i>halakha</i> follows <b>the stringent ruling,</b> because the rival wife is certainly his wife and requires levirate marriage. As there is uncertainty with regard to the betrothal with the forbidden relative, the ruling is stringent; she may not enter into levirate marriage and must only perform <i>ḥalitza</i>.",
            "The Gemara objects: Yet <b>this is a stringency that might bring about a leniency</b> in another scenario. How so? <b>Sometimes</b> that same man who betrothed the forbidden relative might <b>go and betroth her sister</b> with <b>a betrothal</b> whose status is <b>certain.</b> If one says that due to a stringency the rival wife may not enter into levirate marriage due to her possible status as the rival wife of a forbidden relative, people might come to assume that the betrothal with the forbidden relative was a valid betrothal, and that the subsequent betrothal with her sister was not valid, since she is his wife’s sister. This would be assumed because they would not know that the status of the first betrothal was itself uncertain and that only due to a stringent ruling is the rival wife not allowed to enter into levirate marriage. In fact, the status of the betrothal with the sister of the forbidden relative is also uncertain. As a result of this ruling, however, people might be led to think that a man’s wife, i.e., the sister of the forbidden relative, is in fact permitted.",
            "<b>Alternatively, sometimes another man might come and betroth</b> the forbidden relative <b>herself</b> with <b>a betrothal</b> whose status is <b>certain, and since the Master</b> rendered it <b>prohibited</b> for <b>the rival wife to enter into levirate marriage,</b> people would <b>say</b> that the betrothal <b>of the first</b> man, i.e., the deceased brother, was a fully effective <b>betrothal, and</b> that the betrothal <b>of the latter</b> man <b>was not</b> a valid <b>betrothal.</b> If she was married to the first man, then she is forbidden to the second as the man’s wife, and betrothal cannot take effect with her. However, since the status of her betrothal to the first man was uncertain, then she is also considered possibly betrothed to the second man and would require a divorce from him as well. As a result, one can find a situation that would lead people to think that a man’s wife is in fact permitted."

        [
            "Rabba answered: <b>Since you require <i>ḥalitza</i></b> and you do not exempt her completely, all will <b>know that this is merely a stringency</b> and that the Sages did not decide with certitude that the first betrothal was fully valid. Consequently, they would not come to disregard the other betrothal. Abaye raised a challenge: <b>If so, let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> the case where it is uncertain whether the item is closer to him or closer to her with regard to <b>divorce, and</b> stipulate <b>that she requires <i>ḥalitza</i>.

            "He answered him: A mistake could in fact be made here, as, <b>if you say that she</b> must <b>perform <i>ḥalitza</i></b> then <b>she</b> may also <b>enter into levirate marriage.</b> People might mistakenly think that if she is suitable for <i>ḥalitza</i> then she is also suitable for levirate marriage, and as a result the woman might enter into levirate marriage, despite the fact that it is forbidden for her to do so. Abaye objected: <b>Here too,</b> in the case of uncertain betrothal, the concern exists that <b>if you say that she performs <i>ḥalitza</i></b> then <b>she</b> might also <b>enter into levirate marriage.</b> Rabba answered: <b>So let her enter into levirate marriage, and</b> there is <b>no</b> problem <b>with that.</b> In this instance <b>she remains with</b> her <b>presumptive status</b> as permitted because she was originally assumed to be permitted and was rendered forbidden only due to our concern. However, there would be no actual transgression involved even if she were to enter into levirate marriage.",
            "<b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> Rabba by citing a case where even in places of doubt, the woman requires <i>ḥalitza</i>. As we learned in a mishna (67b): <b>A house fell on him,</b> on a certain man, <b>and on his brother’s daughter</b> to whom this man was married, and he was childless, <b>and it is unknown which of them died first.</b> If the deceased wife had a rival wife, then <b>her rival wife</b> must <b>perform <i>ḥalitza</i> but may not enter into levirate marriage.</b> If the man had died first, then at the time of his death the rival wife was forbidden to the <i>yavam</i> as the rival wife of his daughter and exempt from levirate marriage. If, however, the daughter had died first, then at the time of the husband’s death the second wife was not the rival wife of a forbidden relative, and requires levirate marriage. It is due to this doubt that she must perform <i>ḥalitza</i> and may not enter into levirate marriage.",
            "And according to Rabba’s opinion, <b>why</b> is that so? <b>Here too, let us say: This woman,</b> the rival wife, <b>has the presumptive status of</b> being <b>permitted</b> to marry a man <b>from the</b> general <b>public.</b> This is because she was exempt from levirate marriage for the entire period of her marriage as the rival wife of a forbidden relative. <b>And due to the uncertainty</b> whether her rival wife was the first to die <b>you come to render her forbidden</b> and require that she perform <i>ḥalitza</i>. <b>Do not render her forbidden due to an uncertainty.</b>",
            "<b>And if you would say: Here too,</b> we rule <b>more stringently</b> due to the uncertainty. Nevertheless, <b>this would be a stringency that brings about a leniency, for if you say that she</b> must <b>perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, she may</b> also <b>enter into levirate marriage.</b> However, it is forbidden for her to enter into levirate marriage, because she is possibly forbidden to the <i>yavam</i> as the rival wife of his daughter and therefore forbidden just like the daughter herself. Rabba replied: In cases of <b>divorce, which are common, the Sages issued a rabbinic decree</b> preventing her from performing <i>ḥalitza</i> due to a concern that if she were required to perform <i>ḥalitza</i> then she may enter into levirate marriage as well. In cases of <b>collapse, which are not common, the Sages did not issue a rabbinic decree,</b> because they did not introduce decrees with regard to uncommon matters.",
            "<b>Alternatively,</b> there is another reason to differentiate between the cases. In the case of <b>divorce where there is a forbidden relative who indicates</b> that the rival wife is forbidden due to her status as the rival wife of a forbidden relative, <b>and you require that her rival wife perform <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> people <b>will say: The Sages determined that this bill of divorce is a full-fledged bill of divorce.</b> Consequently, they required her rival wife to perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>and</b> people <b>may come to consummate the levirate marriage with the rival wife</b> based on this mistaken assumption. In cases of <b>collapse,</b> however, <b>could the Sages have determined</b> who died first <b>in the collapse?</b> As it is known to all that there was a doubt that could not be clarified, it is clear that the Sages required the rival wife to perform <i>ḥalitza</i> only due to this uncertainty. Therefore, there is no concern that she would come to enter into levirate marriage because of this <i>ḥalitza</i>.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But did we not learn</b> in a mishna about the case where it is uncertain whether the bill of divorce is closer to him or closer to her <b>with regard to</b> situations of <b>divorce</b> whose status is uncertain? <b>And didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: In a case where his wife <b>was standing in the public domain and he threw her</b> the bill of divorce, if the bill landed <b>closer to her, she is divorced.</b> If it was <b>closer to him, she is not divorced.</b> If it was <b>half and half,</b> i.e., if the bill of divorce landed midway between the man and the woman, there is uncertainty whether <b>she is divorced or</b> whether <b>she is not divorced.</b>",
            "<b>And we say: With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> was the ruling said that she is both divorced and not divorced? The Gemara explains that this affects two areas of <i>halakha</i>. The first is <b>that if</b> the man divorcing his wife <b>is a priest,</b> then his wife <b>is forbidden to him</b> due to the uncertainty that she may in fact be divorced through that bill of divorce. Consequently, he would then be unable to remarry her. The second ramification is that <b>if</b> the woman being divorced <b>was a forbidden relative</b> to her husband’s brother, and her husband died childless, then <b>her rival wife would require <i>ḥalitza</i>.</b> The mishna indicates that in this type of divorce whose status is uncertain as well, the Sages require the rival wife to perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, and <b>we do not say that if you say</b> that <b>she</b> must <b>perform <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> she may <b>enter into levirate marriage.</b> Here there is no such concern.",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>But wasn’t it stated with regard to</b> that mishna that this is referring to a very specific set of circumstances? It is <b>Rabba and Rav Yosef who both say:</b> The doubt here does not result from the facts of the case themselves, but from conflicting testimonies and an inability to decide between them. <b>Here, we are dealing with two sets of witnesses, one</b> of which <b>says</b> that the bill fell <b>closer to her, and one</b> of which <b>says</b> that it fell <b>closer to him. This,</b> then, <b>is an uncertainty</b> in matters <b>of Torah</b> law, for in this case there are two testimonies, each one complete by itself, yet they contradict one another. Such instances are deemed to have the status of an uncertainty with regard to Torah law, and therefore the ruling is stringent. <b>But the mishna here is referring to one set</b> of witnesses who were divided in their testimony or who could not clarify exactly what had occurred. <b>This is</b> considered to be an <b>uncertainty</b> in matters <b>of rabbinic</b> law alone, as there is only a single uncorroborated testimony, and in cases of uncertainty in matters of rabbinic law the ruling is lenient.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And from where</b> is it known <b>that the mishna here</b> is referring to a case of uncertainty <b>with one set</b> of witnesses? The Gemara responds: <b>It is similar to that of betrothal. Just as</b> with regard to <b>betrothal</b> it is referring to a case of uncertainty <b>with one set of witnesses, so too,</b> with regard to <b>divorce</b> it is referring to a case <b>of one set</b> of witnesses. The Gemara wonders: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>betrothal itself, from where</b> is it known that the mishna is referring to a case of uncertainty <b>that</b> involves <b>one set</b> of witnesses? <b>Perhaps</b> it is referring to a case <b>of two sets</b> of witnesses? The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>of two sets of witnesses</b> who contradict one another, then <b>let her enter into levirate marriage, and</b> there is <b>no</b> problem <b>with that,</b> as there are two witnesses testifying that there was never a betrothal. Therefore, both the cases of betrothal and divorce must be referring to a situation where there is one set of witnesses.",
            "The Gemara challenges: How can one say that? After all, <b>there are witnesses who are standing</b> before us <b>and saying</b> that the object of betrothal fell <b>closer to her.</b> Accordingly, she was betrothed and her rival wife is the rival wife of a forbidden relative. <b>And</b> yet <b>you say to let her enter into levirate marriage and</b> there is <b>no</b> problem <b>with that? And furthermore,</b> with regard to the fundamental difference between two pairs of witnesses and a single pair, the case <b>of two pairs of witnesses is also</b> considered an <b>uncertainty</b> in matters of <b>rabbinic</b> law. This is not considered to be uncertainty with regard to the reality of what actually happened, which would be a case of uncertainty in matters of Torah law, but rather a contradiction between two opposing testimonies. In these cases <b>we say: Place two</b> witnesses <b>against two</b> witnesses, and let the two testimonies cancel each other out. Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> would be to <b>let the woman remain in her original presumptive status.</b> Accordingly, this type of uncertainty stems only from rabbinic law and not from Torah law.",
            "The Gemara cites a proof for this: This is <b>just as it is in</b> the case <b>concerning the property of</b> a man named <b>Bar Shatya,</b> who was referred to by this name because he would occasionally go insane. The case is as follows: <b>Bar Shatya sold property. Two</b> witnesses <b>came</b> forward <b>and said that he sold</b> it <b>when</b> he was <b>healthy</b> and therefore the sale was valid. <b>And two</b> others <b>came</b> forward <b>and said that he sold</b> it <b>when</b> he was <b>insane,</b> and so the sale was void. <b>Rav Ashi said</b> with regard to this matter: <b>Place two</b> witnesses <b>against two</b> witnesses and let the testimonies cancel each other out.

        [
            "<b>let the land remain in the possession of Bar Shatya.</b> Since no substantiated proof was brought forth, the land remains in the hands of its current possessor. As such, the same should be true with regard to cases of betrothal and divorce whose status is uncertain; the woman should remain in her former presumptive status.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> Rabba’s understanding of the mishna must be rejected, and <b>Abaye said:</b> The mishna should be understood according to that which is written: <b>“His fellow speaks of him”</b> (Job 36:33). This principle teaches that a related case can be inferred from the single case cited. The mishna <b>teaches</b> the case where it is uncertain whether the item is closer to him or closer to her <b>with regard to betrothal, and the same is true with regard to divorce</b> if it is uncertain whether the bill of divorce fell closer to him or closer to her. Similarly, the mishna <b>teaches</b> the case of bills that were written in a questionable manner <b>with regard to divorce, and the same is true with regard to betrothal.</b>",
            "<b>Rava said to him: If</b> you understand that the legal ruling in all of these cases is the same, and the mishna was written in the style of: <b>His fellow speaks of him,</b> then <b>what is</b> the meaning of the term: <b>This is, that</b> the mishna <b>teaches?</b> The mishna in fact emphasizes that this is a betrothal whose status is uncertain and this is a divorce whose status is uncertain, which indicates this case alone and no other.",
            "<b>Rather, Rava said: All</b> of the cases <b>that exist with regard to betrothal</b> whose status is uncertain <b>exist in</b> cases <b>of divorce</b> as well. However, <b>there are</b> some cases of uncertainty <b>with regard to divorce that do not exist with regard to betrothal,</b> as betrothal performed with a questionable bill is not disqualified. Accordingly, the term: <b>This is,</b> utilized in the mishna <b>with regard to divorce, is not specific</b> and does not imply exclusion of the case where it is possibly closer to him and possibly closer to her. <b>Rather, because</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> the ruling of: <b>This is, with regard to betrothal,</b> where it is specific <b>it teaches</b> the phrase: <b>This is, with regard to divorce as well.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And what does</b> the phrase: <b>This is,</b> mentioned <b>with regard to betrothal,</b> come <b>to exclude?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It</b> comes <b>to exclude the</b> matter of the <b>date, which is not</b> essential <b>with regard to betrothal,</b> as when one betroths a woman by means of a document the date need not be written.",
            "The Gemara asks about this matter itself: <b>And for what</b> reason <b>did they not institute</b> that <b>the date</b> must be included <b>in the betrothal</b> document? <b>This</b> policy <b>works out well according to the one who says</b> that the reason the Sages instituted that the date must be written on a bill of divorce <b>is due to the profits.</b> As the husband receives the profits from the wife’s properties during the period of their marriage, it was necessary to write a date on the bill of divorce in order to know at what point his right to receive or sell these items was terminated. However, it was not necessary to include a date on a deed of betrothal, as this document serves only to create a bond of betrothal, <b>and there are no profits from a betrothed woman.</b> A husband does not have the right to receive profits from his betrothed’s property until she is his full-fledged wife.",
            "<b>However, according to the one who says</b> that the Sages instituted the requirement of including the date in the bill of divorce <b>due to</b> a case where a man is married to <b>the daughter of his sister,</b> then <b>they should institute</b> that he must include <b>the date</b> in a deed of betrothal as well. Occasionally a man might marry the daughter of his sister, whom he loves all the more because she is his close relative in addition to being his wife. If he knows that she acted licentiously while she was married to him, he might grant her a bill of divorce without a date so as to save her from the death penalty. Were witnesses to come forth and testify to her behavior, she could claim that at the time of her licentious act she was already a divorced woman. If this was indeed the reason for the Sages’ instituting the requirement of including the date in a bill of divorce, then the date should be included in a deed of betrothal as well, for an undated document of betrothal could be utilized equally well to prove the innocence of the daughter of his sister. If she acted licentiously in the period prior to her betrothal, she would not be penalized. Therefore, the date should be written on this document as well.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Because there are those who betroth by means of money and those who betroth by means of a deed, the Sages did not institute</b> that <b>the date</b> must be written in the document. As the date of the betrothal has no place in the act of betrothal by means of money, the Sages did not distinguish between the various modes of betrothal.",
            "<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Yosef, said to Rav Ashi: But</b> with regard to <b>a slave, where there are</b> those <b>who acquire</b> them <b>with money and there are</b> those who acquire them <b>with a deed, the Sages</b> nevertheless <b>instituted</b> that <b>the date</b> must be written in a slave’s deed of purchase. He responded: <b>There,</b> with regard to slaves, <b>the majority</b> of people purchase them <b>by means of a deed. Here,</b> with regard to betrothal, <b>the majority</b> of people perform betrothal <b>by means of money.</b>",
            "<b>If you wish, say</b> a different reason why the Sages did not institute that the date must be included in a deed of betrothal. This is <b>due to</b> the fact that <b>it is not possible</b> to institute this in a manner that will ensure that no problems will result. <b>How would we do</b> this? If <b>we leave</b> the deed of betrothal <b>with her, she will erase</b> the date, and so it would remain impossible to prove the juncture at which her licentious behavior took place. If <b>we leave</b> the deed <b>with him,</b> then <b>there are times when she is his sister’s daughter and he might cover for her</b> by erasing the date himself.",
            "If <b>we leave it with the witnesses</b> who signed the document, <b>if they remember</b> themselves the date when the deed was given to the woman, the date need not be written in the document itself, for <b>let them come forth and testify</b> from their memory. <b>And if</b> they do <b>not</b> remember by themselves, then <b>there are times when they see</b> the date <b>that is written and come forth to testify</b> on that basis. <b>And the Merciful One states:</b> “By the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established” (Deuteronomy 19:15). From this verse it is derived: <b>From their mouths, and not from their writings,</b> indicating that testimony is proper only if the individual stated it of himself, and not on the basis of what is written.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so, let us say that with regard to divorce as well.</b> In cases of divorce there should also be a concern lest the woman erase the date on the bill of divorce in her possession. The Gemara responds: <b>There,</b> in the case of a bill of divorce, the date <b>comes to save her,</b> since the bill of divorce removes her status as a man’s wife. She therefore would fear erasing anything lest she disqualify the bill altogether, thereby possibly rendering herself a married woman again (Ramban). <b>Here,</b> however, when dealing with a deed of betrothal, the date <b>comes to her disadvantage,</b> since until now she was presumed to be a single woman, and if there is no date on the document then she clearly cannot be punished.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>three brothers</b> who <b>were married to three unrelated women, and one of</b> the brothers <b>died,</b> the following occurred: <b>The second</b> brother <b>performed levirate betrothal with</b> the wife of the deceased brother <b>and</b> before he was able to consummate the levirate marriage <b>he died</b> as well, leaving behind two women who happen before the third brother for levirate marriage. <b>Then those</b> two women must <b>perform <i>ḥalitza</i> and may not enter into levirate marriage.</b>",

This teaches that a woman eligible for levirate marriage is one <b>who has one levirate relationship and not one who has a double levirate relationship.</b> In this case, the wife of the first deceased brother requires levirate marriage due to both the marriage with her first husband as well as the levirate betrothal with the second brother. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: He</b> may <b>consummate the levirate marriage with whichever</b> woman <b>he wishes and</b> then <b>perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with the second.</b>",

            "Since the matter could not be decided by tradition, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya began to deliberate</b> and analyze the question logically. Prohibited labor on <b>Shabbat was prohibited to all.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do they disagree?</b> The Gemara suggests that they disagree with regard to the issue of <b>a more inclusive prohibition, and</b> this dispute pertains to the status of a more inclusive prohibition specifically <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.

            "Following this clarification of the dispute, the matter is now considered from a different angle: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> the dispute between his version of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s ruling and that of bar Kappara can be explained as follows: <b>When Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>taught</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya, he taught him <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> and Rabbi Yosei holds that there are cases where two prohibitions can both take effect. And <b>when</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>taught bar Kappara,</b> he did so <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> who holds that a new prohibition can never take effect where another prohibition already exists. Therefore, Rabbi Ḥiyya could understand why bar Kappara insisted on his opinion. Rabbi Ḥiyya thought that bar Kappara was in fact relating an accurate statement of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, as Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi was relating to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Ḥiyya assumed that bar Kappara did not understand that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s statement was not in accordance with Rabbi Yosei’s opinion. <b>According to bar Kappara, however, was Rabbi Ḥiyya then telling a falsehood?</b> How would bar Kappara relate to Rabbi Ḥiyya’s oath?

Therefore, it was incumbent upon Rabbi Ḥiyya to take an oath in order to emphasize that despite Rabbi Shimon’s general opinion, in cases where the prohibitions take effect simultaneously, he would concede that both prohibitions can take effect. <b>However, according to bar Kappara, why was it necessary to swear?</b> It would have sufficed for him simply to make his statement, as it concurs with the default understanding of Rabbi Shimon’s opinion.

            "<b>Rav Ashi strongly objects to this:</b> The previous rejection that was based on the idea that the act of burning was not a full-fledged prohibited labor is in fact groundless. <b>Is</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaching</b> how many <b>sin-offerings</b> would be incurred, <b>or is he teaching</b> how many <b>negative mitzvot</b> are being violated? <b>Rather, he merely</b> enumerates <b>the prohibitions</b> violated by a certain action, without detailing their severities, and therefore the desecration of Shabbat involved in the Temple service can be any Shabbat violation. The Gemara asks: <b>What practical difference does it make</b> how many prohibitions are involved?

The act of betrothal is sufficient to prohibit a woman to all other men as a married woman. Therefore, when the women were switched, both men transgressed this violation. <b>And if they were brothers,</b> then they are also liable <b>for</b> forbidden sexual relations with <b>a brother’s wife. And if</b> these women <b>were sisters,</b> then they are liable <b>for</b> taking <b>a wife and her sister</b> as well. <b>And if they were menstruating women,</b> they would be liable <b>for</b> intercourse with <b>a menstruating woman</b> as well.",

The Gemara comments: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult</b> and does not disprove the notion that the act was intentional.

When the second brother betrothed her sister, this added the prohibition pertaining to his wife’s sister. This is a more inclusive prohibition because, as a result of this betrothal, the second brother is prohibited from engaging in sexual intercourse not only with his wife’s sister, who is his brother’s wife, but also with all of her other sisters. When this woman becomes a menstruating woman, she is forbidden to her husband as well, which is an expanded prohibition. Consequently, the mishna includes examples of all three types of prohibitions and asserts that they all take effect in this case. Therefore, the Gemara wonders which <i>tanna</i> holds that in each of these cases the prohibition takes effect even where another prohibition exists.",
            "<b>Rav Yehuda said that Rav said: This is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There is</b> one who performs a single act of <b>eating</b> an olive-bulk of food, <b>and he is liable to bring four sin-offerings and one guilt-offering.</b>",
            "How so? This <i>halakha</i> applies to one who is <b>ritually impure who ate</b> forbidden <b>fat</b> that was <b><i>notar</i> from a consecrated offering,</b> i.e., it remained after the time when it was permitted to eat it, and this occurred <b>on Yom Kippur.</b> One who did this is liable to bring one sin offering for eating consecrated food while impure, one for eating forbidden fat, one for eating <i>notar</i>, and one for eating on Yom Kippur. He is also liable to bring a guilt-offering for misuse of consecrated items. In this case, it was prohibited to eat the fat from the moment the animal was born. When the animal was consecrated, the prohibition against deriving benefit from it took effect on the entire animal, rendering this an expanded prohibition. When the priest became ritually impure and thereby prohibited from partaking of all sanctified foods, a more inclusive prohibition took effect. The moment the fat was rendered <i>notar</i>, it became prohibited to offer it on the altar as well, so that that is another instance of an expanded prohibition. Lastly, on Yom Kippur, an additional, more inclusive prohibition took effect because on Yom Kippur it is prohibited to eat all food, even that which is not consecrated.",

He is liable for carrying out the food, not for eating it. In this example, the prohibitions of Shabbat and Yom Kippur take effect at the same moment, and therefore this last case would be an instance of simultaneous prohibitions, and Rabbi Meir holds that they take effect as well. Therefore, this <i>baraita</i> demonstrates that Rabbi Meir holds that prohibitions take effect where other prohibitions already exist in all of these instances: More inclusive prohibitions, expanded prohibitions, and simultaneous prohibitions.",

In the case in the mishna as well, the men intended to perform the mitzva of marriage but unwittingly violated a transgression because the wives were switched. Therefore, according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua, they should be exempt from a sin-offering. <b>Rather,</b> this must be <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who holds that even if one mistakenly transgressed while attempting to perform a mitzva, he is still obligated to bring a sin-offering.",

Since the <i>mohel</i> did not fulfill the mitzva of circumcision, he should be liable for performing prohibited labor on Shabbat. However, Rabbi Yehoshua exempts him from a sin-offering <b>since</b> he is <b>pressed for time.</b> Because circumcision must be performed only on the day specified, he was rushed and anxious to perform the circumcision, and due to this sense of urgency he erred and thought that the proper time was on Shabbat. <b>In this</b> case in the mishna, <b>however,</b> where the mistake involved marriage, <b>since</b> the brothers were <b>not pressed for time</b> Rabbi Yehoshua does <b>not</b> deem the brothers exempt.",

            "Reish Lakish explains the need for the final clause of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> even <b>if you say:</b> Let the wives marry without the need for any levirate marriage or <i>ḥalitza</i> because one should <b>follow</b> the <b>majority of women, and</b> the <b>majority of women give birth to a full-fledged,</b> i.e., viable, <b>offspring,</b> and therefore one should presume no levirate bond exists, to counter this claim the <i>baraita</i> concludes: Even if the offspring will be viable, an <b>offspring does not release</b> a <i>yevama</i> and her rival wives from the levirate bond <b>until it comes into the air of the world.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> Is it <b>possible</b> that <b>there is</b> halakhic acceptance <b>of this</b> opinion <b>of Reish Lakish and it was not</b> hinted to by something <b>taught in the Mishna?

If she discovers her rival wife is pregnant, she would have to wait to see if the pregnancy is viable. If it is found to be viable, only at that point would she be permitted to marry someone else.",
            "Rabbi Elazar explains how this mishna supports Reish Lakish’s opinion: <b>Granted, she may not enter levirate marriage</b> as <b>perhaps</b> her rival wife is pregnant and the <b>offspring will be viable, and</b> therefore by consummating the levirate marriage the <i>yavam</i> would <b>encounter the Torah prohibition against</b> engaging in relations with one’s <b>brother’s wife. But why may she not perform <i>ḥalitza</i>? Granted, she may not perform <i>ḥalitza</i> during the</b> first <b>nine</b> months following her husband’s death <b>and</b> then proceed to also <b>marry during</b> those <b>nine</b> months; <b>this is</b> prohibited due to the fact that there is the <b>uncertainty</b> whether her rival wife is pregnant with viable offspring, in which case she would be released from the levirate bond.",
            "<b>But let her perform <i>ḥalitza</i> during the</b> first <b>nine</b> months following her husband’s death <b>and</b> then wait to <b>marry</b> until <b>after</b> those <b>nine</b> months. By that point in time, even if the rival wife was pregnant she would have already given birth. If the offspring was viable, then it emerges that there was never a levirate bond, and if it is not viable, then she was released from her levirate bond through the <i>ḥalitza</i> she performed. Either way, she would now be permitted to remarry. Why, then, does the mishna not consider this possibility? Rabbi Elazar claims that the only explanation for this is if the mishna assumes that <i>ḥalitza</i> performed while one of the wives of the deceased is pregnant is not effective. As such, the mishna is a proof for Reish Lakish’s opinion.",
            "The Gemara rejects Rabbi Elazar’s proof: <b>But</b> even <b>according to your reasoning</b> that <i>ḥalitza</i> with a pregnant woman is not effective, the mishna should have considered an additional possibility: <b>Let her perform <i>ḥalitza</i> and marry,</b> doing both <b>after nine</b> months have passed since the death of her husband. Doing so should be effective according to both Reish Lakish and Rabbi Yoḥanan.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the discussion of this topic should be held <b>apart from that</b> mishna, as the true reason for that mishna’s ruling is <b>as</b> it is <b>Abaye bar Abba and Rav Ḥinnana bar Abaye who both say</b> that she is prohibited from performing <i>ḥalitza</i> while one of the wives of the deceased is pregnant because <b>perhaps</b> the <b>offspring will be viable,</b> in which case any <i>ḥalitza</i> performed would be entirely unnecessary and therefore meaningless, and she would remain permitted to marry into the priesthood, as the opening mishna of the chapter rules. However, in this situation people might not realize that the <i>ḥalitza</i> she performed was meaningless, and they would think she is a <i>ḥalutza</i>, who is prohibited from marrying a priest. <b>And it would</b> therefore <b>emerge</b> that if she were allowed to perform <i>ḥalitza</i> while pregnant, it is possible that <b>you will</b> ultimately <b>require a public announcement</b> to be made <b>for her</b> to attest to the fact that she is in fact still permitted <b>to</b> marry into the <b>priesthood.</b>",
            "The Gemara wonders why this poses a problem: <b>But</b> why not let her perform <i>ḥalitza</i> while still pregnant, and then if it becomes necessary, <b>require</b> a public announcement to be made <b>for her?</b> The Gemara explains why one should avoid having to rely on a public announcement: <b>Perhaps there were</b> some <b>people who were</b> present <b>at the <i>ḥalitza</i> and were not</b> present <b>at</b> the <b>public announcement, and</b> when the courts permit her to marry a priest <b>they might come to say</b> that <b>they are permitting a <i>ḥalutza</i></b> to marry <b>a priest.</b>",
            "Abaye suggests another rejection of Rabbi Elazar’s proof from that mishna: <b>Abaye said to</b> Rabbi Elazar: The very formulation of the mishna refutes Reish Lakish’s opinion, as <b>does</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> that <b>she may neither perform <i>ḥalitza</i> nor enter into levirate marriage?</b> No, the mishna <b>teaches</b> only that <b>she may neither be married nor enter into levirate marriage,</b> which implies only that she may not marry <b>without</b> first performing <b><i>ḥalitza</i>, but if</b> the <i>yavam</i> <b>performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with her, she would indeed be permitted</b> to marry after nine months have passed since her husband’s death. This understanding of the mishna undermines the basis of Rabbi Elazar’s proof from the mishna.",
            "Even if that mishna does not support Reish Lakish’s opinion, nevertheless <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Reish Lakish:</b> In the case of <b>one who performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with a pregnant woman and she miscarries, she requires</b> another <b><i>ḥalitza</i> with the brothers</b> in order to release her from the levirate bond. The <i>baraita</i> assumes that the original <i>ḥalitza</i> is ineffective because it was done while she was still pregnant, which is in accordance with the opinion of Reish Lakish.",
            "<b>Rava said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Reish Lakish in these three</b> disputes: <b>One, this</b> dispute <b>that we</b> already <b>stated</b> with regard to the <i>ḥalitza</i> of a pregnant woman. <b>The other</b> dispute concerns that <b>which we learned</b> in a mishna: In the case of <b>one who verbally divides up his possessions</b> among his descendants, stating how he wishes his estate to be divided after his death, if <b>he increases</b> the proportion of his estate that should go <b>to one</b> of his children <b>or decreases</b> the proportion of his estate that should go <b>to</b> another <b>one</b> of his children, <b>or</b> if <b>he equally</b> distributes <b>between them</b> the double portion of <b>the firstborn,</b> then <b>his words are binding.</b>",
            "<b>But if he said</b> explicitly that the receipt of those portions should be considered <b>as an inheritance,</b> then it as though the verbal division of his property that <b>he said is nothing,</b> i.e., it is non-binding, since his words directly contradict the <i>halakhot</i> of inheritance as they are written in the Torah. However, if he wrote a will and somewhere therein <b>he wrote, whether at the beginning, whether at the end, or whether in the middle,</b> that the receipt of the portions should be considered <b>as a gift,</b> as opposed to an inheritance, then <b>his words are binding.</b>"
        ],
        [
            "Reish Lakish and Rabbi Yoḥanan dispute whether one must state that the receipt of the portions should be considered as a gift with regard to each recipient, or whether stating it with regard to one of them is enough to indicate that it is true for all. <b>And Reish Lakish said:</b> The inheritors <b>will only ever acquire</b> the portions as defined by the owner of the possessions <b>once he says: So-and-so and so-and-so shall inherit such and such a field and such and such</b> a field <b>that I have given to them as a gift, and they shall inherit them,</b> i.e., he must state explicitly for each recipient that their receipt of the portions should be considered a gift. Rava ruled that in this dispute as well, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with Reish Lakish.",
            "<b>And the other</b> dispute concerns that <b>which we learned</b> in a mishna: In the case of <b>one who writes</b> a bill transferring ownership of <b>all of his possessions to his son</b> stating that the transfer should take effect immediately so that the son should gain the rights to use the possessions <b>after his death,</b> then although <b>the father</b> retained for himself the right to use the possessions until his death, he <b>is unable to sell</b> the possessions <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that he gave them to the son, and the son is unable to sell</b> the possessions <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that they are</b> still <b>in the father’s possession.</b> If <b>the father sold</b> the possessions, then <b>they are sold</b> to the extent that the purchaser may use them <b>until</b> the father <b>dies.</b> If <b>the son sold</b> the possessions during his father’s lifetime, <b>the purchaser does not</b> receive <b>any</b> rights to use the possessions <b>until the father dies.</b>",
            "<b>And</b> an amoraic dispute <b>was stated</b> in the case in which <b>the son sold</b> the possessions <b>during the father’s lifetime, and</b> then <b>the son died during the father’s lifetime,</b> following which the father died as well. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The purchaser does not acquire</b> anything, <b>and Reish Lakish said: The purchaser does acquire</b> the possessions.",
            "The Gemara explains their reasoning: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that <b>the purchaser does not acquire</b> anything, because he holds that the <b>ownership of</b> the rights to an item and its <b>produce is tantamount to</b> the <b>ownership of the item itself,</b> i.e., the actual title to it. Since the father retained the rights to use the possessions until his death, as long as he lives he is considered to hold the title to them. Therefore, the son’s sale can be effective only after the father’s death, at which point the son becomes the title owner. However, if the son dies first, then since he never gained the title to the items, his sale can never come to fruition.",
            "<b>And Reish Lakish said: The purchaser does acquire</b> the possessions, as Reish Lakish holds that the <b>ownership of</b> the rights to an item and its <b>produce is not tantamount to</b> the <b>ownership of the item itself,</b> i.e., the actual title to it. Therefore, although the father is still alive, the son immediately gains the full title to the possessions, which he may sell to someone else. Nevertheless, since the father retains the rights to use the possessions, the purchaser may use the possessions he acquired only when the father dies.",
            "§ The mishna states that if a <i>yavam</i> consummates a levirate marriage with his <i>yevama</i> while she is pregnant, if it emerges that <b>the offspring is not viable</b> then he may maintain her as his wife because his intercourse with her was a valid consummation of levirate marriage. An opposing opinion <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In the name of Rabbi Eliezer they said: He must send her out with a bill of divorce.</b> Although it emerged that the levirate marriage took effect, since at the time he consummated the levirate marriage it was prohibited to do so because the <i>yevama</i> was pregnant, he is therefore penalized and required to separate from her.",

In Rav Mesharshiyya’s opinion, the prohibition against the widow remarrying without <i>ḥalitza</i> was as obvious as the prohibition of forbidden fats.",
            "After citing this dispute, Rav Ashi said to Rav Hoshaya, son of Rav Idi: According to Rava’s citation of Rav, when a woman is married to a priest, the Sages were more lenient in order to allow the couple to remain married. <b>Here, with regard to a woman who is pregnant</b> with the child <b>of another</b> man <b>or a woman who is nursing</b> the child <b>of another</b> man, <b>who is married to a priest, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Did the Sages enact an ordinance for</b> the benefit of <b>a priest</b> and say that it is sufficient for him to separate from his wife and he does not need to divorce her, <b>or not?</b>",
            "<b>He said to him: How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? Granted, there,</b> in the case where the offspring died during its first thirty days of life, <b>since there are the Rabbis who disagree with Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel concerning it, as they say</b> that <b>although</b> the offspring <b>did not survive</b> for thirty days <b>it is</b> nevertheless considered <b>a full-fledged,</b> i.e., viable, <b>offspring,</b> therefore, <b>with regard to</b> the <b>wife of a priest, since it is not possible</b> for her to perform <i>ḥalitza</i> and remain permitted to her husband, <b>we</b> will be lenient and <b>act in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis.</b>",
            "<b>However, here,</b> in the case of a woman who is pregnant with or nursing the child of another man, <b>in accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>should we act? If</b> we act <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> it will be of no benefit to the priest because Rabbi Meir <b>said</b> even with regard to the wife of an Israelite that <b>he must divorce</b> her <b>and may never take</b> her <b>back. And if</b> we act <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> it will also be of no benefit to the priest because <b>they say</b> he must send her out <b>with a bill of divorce</b> and only remarry her at a later point. Since there is no opinion that does not require a bill of divorce to be given, there is no possibility to be lenient in this case by not requiring a bill of divorce to be given.",
            "A pregnancy is generally noticeable only after three months have passed. Therefore, during the first three months after a woman is divorced or widowed, she may not remarry due to the possibility that she is pregnant. The Sages decreed that even betrothing her during that time is prohibited, lest one also marry her (see 41a). Concerning this, an amoraic dispute <b>was stated:</b> In a case in which a man <b>betrothed</b> a woman <b>during</b> the <b>three months</b> following her divorce or her husband’s death, <b>and</b> then <b>he fled, Rav Aḥa and Rafram disagree over</b> what should be done. <b>One said: We excommunicate him</b> for violating the prohibition. <b>And</b> the other <b>one said: His flight is sufficient for him,</b> since it proves that he does not intend to marry her until it is determined that she is not pregnant. Therefore, there is no need to penalize him further. The Gemara relates: <b>There was an incident</b> like that, <b>and Rafram said to those</b> who asked what to do: <b>His flight is sufficient for him.</b>",
            "§ The mishna states that if a <i>yevama</i> consummated the levirate marriage and gave birth seven months later, there is <b>an uncertainty whether</b> the child <b>is nine</b> months <b>old,</b> counting from conception, and is the offspring of the first husband, i.e., the deceased brother, or whether the child is only seven months old and is the offspring of the second husband. If it is the child of the first husband, then there was never any obligation of levirate marriage, and the supposed consummation was in fact forbidden by penalty of <i>karet</i>. Due to that possibility, both the man and the woman are obligated to bring a guilt-offering for uncertainty. <b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman:</b> How can they bring a guilt-offering for uncertainty? <b>Let us say: Follow</b> the <b>majority of women, and</b> since the <b>majority of women give birth after nine</b> months, it should be presumed that the child is the offspring of the deceased brother. Accordingly, the couple would be obligated to bring a certain sin-offering, not a guilt-offering for uncertainty.",
            "Rav Naḥman <b>said to him:</b> The <b>women of our</b> family regularly <b>give birth after seven</b> months. Therefore, how can you presume that this woman gave birth after nine months? Rava <b>said to him: Do</b> the <b>women of your</b> family <b>constitute the majority of</b> the women of <b>the world?</b> Ultimately, the majority of women give birth after nine months, and one should therefore presume accordingly in a case of uncertainty.",
            "Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: This is what I am saying:</b> Although it is true that the <b>majority of women give birth after nine</b> months <b>and</b> only <b>a minority</b> give birth <b>after seven,</b> still, in the case of <b>every</b> woman <b>who gives birth after nine</b> months, <b>her fetus is</b> already <b>recognizable after a third of her days,</b> i.e., in the third month of her pregnancy. Accordingly, in the case of <b>this</b> woman, <b>since her fetus was not recognizable after a third of her days,</b> as were it already recognizable at that point then it would be obvious that the child was the offspring of the first husband, therefore, the ability to presume she is like the <b>majority</b> of women <b>is compromised,</b> and the uncertainty as to who the father of the child is remains. Consequently, the <i>yavam</i> and <i>yevama</i> should each bring a guilt-offering for uncertainty.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> it is true that in the case of <b>every</b> woman <b>who gives birth after nine</b> months, <b>her fetus is</b> already <b>recognizable after a third of her days,</b> then with regard to <b>this</b> woman, <b>from</b> the fact that her fetus <b>was not recognized after a third</b> of her days, it follows that <b>her fetus was certainly</b> only <b>seven</b> months <b>old</b> and is the offspring <b>of the latter</b> husband, i.e., the <i>yavam</i>. If so, it is clear the <i>yavam</i> is the father of the child and there should be no need to bring an offering at all. <b>Rather,</b> one must emend Rav Naḥman’s words and <b>say:</b> In the <b>majority</b> of cases, with regard to a woman <b>who gives birth after nine</b> months, <b>her fetus is</b> already <b>recognizable after a third of her days, and</b> with regard to <b>this</b> woman, <b>from</b> the fact that her fetus <b>was not recognized after a third</b> of her days, the ability to presume she is like the <b>majority</b> of women <b>is compromised.</b>",
            "§ The mishna states that the child of the <i>yevama</i> has unflawed lineage since regardless of whether it is the offspring of the deceased husband or the <i>yavam</i>, there was no transgression involved in its conception. With regard to this case, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>first</b> child <b>is</b> even <b>fit to become a High Priest.</b> However, since it is possible that the child is the offspring of the deceased husband, in which case the widow remains forbidden to the <i>yavam</i> as his brother’s wife, if she has a <b>second</b> child with her <i>yavam</i> then that child is a <b><i>mamzer</i> due to an uncertainty</b> with regard to his status. <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: One is not</b> rendered <b>a <i>mamzer</i> due to uncertainty.</b>",
            "The meaning of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov’s statement and how he differs from the first <i>tanna</i> is unclear. The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>saying? Abaye said: This is what it is saying:</b> The <b>first</b> child <b>is</b> even <b>fit to become a High Priest. And</b> if she has <b>a second</b> child, his status as <b>a <i>mamzer</i></b> is <b>uncertain and</b> therefore he is both prohibited from marrying an Israelite woman of unflawed lineage, since he might actually be a <i>mamzer</i>, <b>and he is</b> also <b>prohibited from</b> marrying <b>a <i>mamzeret</i>,</b> since he might not be a <i>mamzer</i>. <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> ben Ya’akov <b>says: He is not</b> treated like one whose status as <b>a <i>mamzer</i></b> is <b>uncertain; rather,</b> due to the uncertainty concerning his status <b>he is</b> treated like one who is <b>definitely a <i>mamzer</i>, and he is permitted to</b> marry <b>a <i>mamzeret</i>.</b> In other words, Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov holds that even one whose status as a <i>mamzer</i> is uncertain is permitted to marry one who is definitely a <i>mamzeret</i>.",

            "The Gemara explains: <b>And</b> Abaye and Rava <b>disagree with regard to</b> whether the <i>halakha</i> is decided in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kiddushin</i> 74a): With regard to the prohibition against marrying people with certain types of flawed lineage, <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> The marriage of <b>those</b> people whose flawed lineage status is <b>certain to those</b> whose status is <b>certain is permitted,</b> but the marriage of <b>those</b> whose status is <b>certain to those</b> whose status is <b>uncertain, and</b> the marriage of <b>those</b> whose status is <b>uncertain to those</b> whose status is <b>certain, and</b> even the marriage of <b>those</b> whose status is <b>uncertain to those</b> whose status is <b>uncertain, is prohibited.</b>",
            "The mishna concludes: <b>And these are those</b> who are considered to have an <b>uncertain</b> status: <b>A child of unknown paternity</b> [<b><i>shetuki</i></b>], although his mother’s identity is known; <b>and a foundling</b> who was found abandoned in the streets; <b>and a Samaritan [<i>Kuti</i>],</b> who is possibly a <i>mamzer</i> since the Samaritans do not accept and abide by the <i>halakhot</i> of marriage.",
            "<b>And</b> with regard to this mishna <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar.</b> But <b>when I said this</b> <i>halakha</i> of Rav’s <b>in</b> the <b>presence of Shmuel, he said to me: Hillel taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>ten</b> categories of <b>lineage came up from Babylon</b> to Eretz Yisrael: <b>Priests; Levites; and Israelites; priests disqualified due to flawed lineage [<i>ḥalallim</i>]; converts; freed slaves; <i>mamzerim</i>; Gibeonites; <i>shetukei</i>; and foundlings. And it is permitted</b> for <b>all</b> men and women in these categories <b>to marry one another,</b> i.e., the list is arranged such that the marriage between people in any two categories that are adjacent to one another is permitted. This is possible only if one assumes that it is permitted for one whose flawed lineage status is uncertain to marry one whose flawed lineage status is certain.",
            "After citing the baraita taught by Hillel, which assumes that it is permitted for one whose flawed lineage status is uncertain to marry one whose flawed lineage status is certain, Shmuel concluded: The <i>halakha</i> is certainly decided in accordance with the opinion of Hillel, <b>and</b> yet <b>you,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>said</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> which states that a marriage between two people whose flawed lineage status is uncertain is prohibited; your ruling is incorrect.",
            "The Gemara proceeds to explain the dispute between Abaye and Rava: <b>Abaye holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel, who said</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i> is</b> decided <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Hillel</b> that it is permitted for one whose flawed lineage status is uncertain to marry one whose flawed lineage status is certain.

            "<b>Abaye said: From where do I say that</b> concerning <b>anyone</b> whose status as a <i>mamzer</i> is <b>uncertain, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov</b> they <b>are treated equivalently to</b> one who is <b>definitely</b> a <i>mamzer</i>?",
            "<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> With regard to one <b>who engaged in intercourse with</b> and impregnated <b>many women, but he does not know with which</b> women <b>he had intercourse, and similarly,</b> with regard to a woman, if <b>many men had intercourse with her</b> and she became pregnant, <b>but she does not know from which</b> man <b>she received</b> the seed that caused her to become pregnant, since the identities of the parents of those children are not known, <b>it could emerge</b> that <b>a father marries his daughter, and a brother marries his sister.

Abaye demonstrates his claim from the fact that even though it is not certain that the children in this situation are <i>mamzerim</i>, nevertheless, Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov labels them as <i>mamzerim</i> and not as those whose status as a <i>mamzer</i> is uncertain.",
            "<b>And Rava</b> could have <b>said to you: This is what</b> the verse <b>is saying:</b> The word “lewdness [<i>zima</i>]” can be understood as an acronym of the words: <i>Zo ma hi</i>, meaning: <b>What is this.</b> It is plausible to say that Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov’s citation of this verse indicates that he regards their status to be uncertain.",
            "The Gemara cites the continuation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Furthermore, Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov said</b> that even in marriage, one should be careful not to create a situation that could lead to the birth of <i>mamzerim</i>. Therefore, <b>a man should not marry a woman in this country and</b> then <b>go and marry</b> another <b>woman in a different country, lest</b> a son from one marriage and a daughter from the other, unaware that they are both children of the same father, <b>unite with one another, and it could emerge</b> that <b>a brother marries his sister,</b> the children of whom would be <i>mamzerim</i>.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so;</b> is there really such a prohibition? <b>But didn’t Rav, when he happened</b> to come <b>to Dardeshir, make a public announcement saying: Which</b> woman <b>will be</b> my wife <b>for the day,</b> i.e., for the duration of his visit?

            "The Gemara rejects the proof: <b>Sages are different, as their names are renowned,</b> and therefore their children are always identified by their connection to their father. Therefore, Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov’s concern does not apply to them.",
            "The Gemara examines Rav and Rav Naḥman’s actions: <b>But didn’t Rava say:</b> With regard to a woman <b>who had an offer of marriage and accepted,</b> the emotional excitement may have caused her to have a flow of menstrual blood, which would make her ritually impure and prohibit her from engaging in intercourse. Even if she was unaware of any flow, she must consider the possibility that it occurred. To purify herself, <b>she needs to wait seven</b> consecutive days that are <b>clean</b> from any flow of menstrual blood and then immerse in a ritual bath. Only then may she marry. If so, how could Rav and Rav Naḥman marry women on the day they arrived?",
            "The Gemara explains: These <b>Sages would send messengers</b> seven days ahead of their arrival and <b>they</b> would <b>inform</b> the women of the Sage’s arrival. In this way, the woman who agreed to marry the Sage would have time to count the seven clean days. <b>And if you wish, say</b> that <b>the Sages’</b> intentions <b>were merely to be in seclusion [<i>meyaḥadi</i>] with</b> the woman but not to engage in intercourse with her. Therefore, it was permitted to marry her even if she became ritually impure. Being in seclusion with a woman was sufficient to help the Sages avoid any forbidden thoughts, <b>as the Master said: One who has bread in his basket is incomparable to one who does not have bread in his basket,</b> i.e., just as the knowledge that food is readily available is sufficient to psychologically alleviate one’s feelings of hunger, so too, the knowledge that one’s sexual desires could be met lessens the strength of the desire itself.",
            "The Gemara cites an additional statement of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov: It is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: A man should not marry his wife</b> when at the same time <b>his intention is to divorce her, because it is stated: “Do not devise evil against your neighbor, as he dwells securely with you”</b> (Proverbs 3:29). It is wrong for one to intend to undermine the feelings of security that another has with him.",
            "§ The mishna raises a case in which a <i>yavam</i> consummated the levirate marriage with his <i>yevama</i> and seven months later she gave birth. With respect to that child, there is an uncertainty whether he is the child of the deceased brother or whether he is the child of the <i>yavam</i>. The Gemara discusses the ramifications of this uncertainty in a dispute concerning inheritance. The case concerns one whose identity as the son of the deceased is <b>uncertain, and a <i>yavam</i></b> who consummated the levirate marriage with the <i>yevama</i>, <b>who</b> both <b>came to divide up</b> the <b>possessions of the deceased</b> brother and each one claims to be the sole heir.",
            "The one of <b>uncertain</b> descent <b>said: I am the son of the deceased, and</b> therefore, as the only heir, his <b>possessions are mine. And the <i>yavam</i> said</b> to him: <b>You are my son, and you have absolutely no</b> rights <b>to</b> the <b>possessions;</b> rather, by virtue of the fact that I consummated the levirate marriage with the widow of the deceased, I should inherit him. The Gemara rules on this case: This <b>is</b> a case of <b>property of uncertain ownership,</b> as there is no way to determine who is the rightful heir, and the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>property of uncertain ownership</b> the claimants <b>divide up</b> between them.",
            "The Gemara brings another case, that of one concerning whom there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether he is the son of the deceased or of the <i>yavam</i> <b>and the sons of</b> the <b><i>yavam</i>,</b> who consummated the levirate marriage with the <i>yevama</i> and has since died, <b>who came to divide up</b> the <b>possessions of the deceased,</b> and each one makes claim to the inheritance. The one of <b>uncertain</b> descent <b>said: That man,</b> referring to himself, <b>is the son of the deceased, and</b> therefore, as his sole heir, his <b>possessions are mine.</b> And the <b>sons of the <i>yavam</i> said</b> to him: <b>You are our brother, and</b> our uncle, the deceased, was not survived by any offspring and so by virtue of our father’s levirate marriage he inherited our uncle’s possessions, and now that our father has died and we are dividing up his possessions <b>you have</b> a right to inherit only <b>a portion</b> of the inheritance <b>together with us.</b>",
            "<b>The Rabbis</b> who studied <b>before Rav Mesharshiyya thought to say:</b> This case <b>is</b> analogous to a case in <b>a mishna, as we learned</b> a similar case in a mishna (100a) in which a woman gave birth shortly after remarrying and there is uncertainty whether the child’s father is the first or second husband. The mishna considers a case in which the husbands died and were each survived by a set of sons: If a son from either set died, the other sons of that set will inherit from him because as brothers they have an uncontested claim to the inheritance. However, <b>he,</b> the son of uncertain descent, <b>does not inherit</b> from <b>them</b> because his claim as a brother is uncertain and is therefore not powerful enough to allow him to take part of the inheritance from the other sons. <b>However,</b> if the son of uncertain descent died, <b>they,</b> the sons of both husbands, <b>will</b> jointly <b>inherit</b> from <b>him.</b> The claims of each set of sons to be his brothers are equally uncertain; therefore, since there is no one who has a definite claim to his inheritance, his possessions are split between them.",
            "The Rabbis qualify their comparison of the cases: <b>But here,</b> the positions are <b>in reverse,</b> as follows: <b>There,</b> in the case of the mishna, when one of the sons dies, <b>they,</b> the other sons of that set, can <b>say to him,</b> the son of uncertain descent: <b>Bring proof</b> that you are actually a son of our father <b>and</b> only then can you <b>take</b> a portion. Since he cannot prove this, he will not receive any of the inheritance.",
            "However, <b>here,</b> in the case where the son of uncertain descent is in dispute with the sons of the <i>yavam</i>, <b>he,</b> the son of uncertain descent, can <b>say to them: Bring proof</b> that I am not the son of the deceased, <b>and</b> only then can you <b>take</b> a portion together with me. The Rabbis claim that the principle in both cases is identical: When one party has an uncontested claim to the inheritance, and another party advances a claim to receive part of the inheritance that is based on an uncertainty, the uncertain claim is not accepted. In the mishna’s case, it is the son of uncertain descent who has an uncertain claim. The Rabbis suggest that the reverse is true in the Gemara’s case: The son of uncertain descent has an uncontested claim to the inheritance because whether he is the son of the first or second husband, he certainly has a right to some inheritance. It is the sons of the <i>yavam</i> who have an uncertain claim because they have a right to the inheritance only if the son of uncertain descent is actually their brother.",
            "<b>Rav Mesharshiyya said to them: Is</b> the case in the mishna really <b>comparable? There,</b> in the mishna’s case, when one of the sons dies, <b>they,</b> the other sons in that set, have a <b>definite</b> claim to the inheritance, since their claim is based on the fact that they are the dead son’s brothers, which is certainly true, <b>and he,</b> the son of uncertain descent, only has an <b>uncertain</b> claim. However, <b>here, each</b> party has only an <b>uncertain</b> claim. Although the son of uncertain descent claims that ultimately, whatever the nature of his relationship with the deceased is, he should have the right to inherit, nevertheless, since it is not actually known what that relationship is, his claim in reality is merely a composite of uncertain claims.",
            "Having rejected the analogy offered by the Rabbis, Rav Mesharshiyya offers his own analogy to the case in the mishna that the Rabbis cited: <b>Rather, if</b> there is a case that <b>is analogous to</b> the case in <b>the mishna,</b> then it is <b>to this</b> following case that it is <b>analogous:</b> It is comparable <b>to</b> a case in which following the levirate marriage a son was born, and there is uncertainty whether he is the son of the deceased or of the <i>yavam</i>, and that son of <b>uncertain</b> descent <b>and</b> the <b>sons of the <i>yavam</i> come to divide up</b> the <b>possessions of the <i>yavam</i> himself. As there,</b> those who are unquestionably the sons of the <i>yavam</i> have a definite claim; therefore, <b>they</b> can <b>say to him,</b> the son of uncertain descent: <b>Bring proof that you are</b> actually <b>our brother and</b> only then can you <b>take</b> a portion. Since he cannot prove this, he will not receive any of the inheritance.",
            "The Gemara brings yet another case, that of one concerning whom there is an <b>uncertainty</b> whether he is the son of the deceased or of the <i>yavam</i> <b>and</b> the <b>sons of the <i>yavam</i>,</b> i.e., the sons of the man who consummated the levirate marriage with the <i>yevama</i> and has since died, <b>who came to divide up</b> the <b>possessions of the <i>yavam</i> after the <i>yavam</i> had</b> already <b>divided up</b> the <b>possessions of the deceased</b> brother between himself and the son of uncertain descent, as per the Gemara’s ruling in the first case above.",
            "The <i>yavam</i> then died and his sons and the son of uncertain descent each made a claim to the inheritance: <b>The sons of the <i>yavam</i> say</b> to the son of uncertain descent: <b>Bring proof that you are our brother, and</b> only then can you <b>take</b> a portion. The son of <b>uncertain</b> descent <b>said to them: Whichever way you</b> look at it, I should receive a portion of the inheritance. <b>If</b> you assume that <b>I am your brother,</b> then <b>give me a portion</b> of the inheritance <b>together with</b> all of <b>you, and if</b> you assume that <b>I am the son of the deceased,</b> then <b>give me the half</b> of the possessions <b>that your father</b> took when he <b>divided up</b> the possessions <b>with me</b> upon the deceased’s death, because if you assume I am his son, then I am his sole heir and your father never had any rights to his possessions.",
            "The son of uncertain descent’s claim assumes that the original verdict to divide up the possessions of the deceased between the two sides may be reexamined in light of later developments. This assumption, however, is subject to a dispute: <b>Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Rav</b> said: <b>The</b> original <b>verdict stands,</b> i.e., the original division of the deceased’s possessions is considered a closed matter, and the new dispute concerning the possessions of the <i>yavam</i> is considered independently of it. Accordingly, the son of uncertain descent’s claim cannot succeed, and so he receives no portion of the inheritance of the <i>yavam</i>. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said: The</b> original <b>verdict is reconsidered</b> in light of the new circumstances, and therefore in this case the son of uncertain descent can put forward his undeniable claim to some of the possessions of the <i>yavam</i> based on the original uncertainties that existed with regard to the division of the deceased’s possessions.",
            "<b>Let us say that</b> Rabbi Abba and Rabbi Yirmeya <b>disagree over the dispute between Admon and the Rabbis. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 109b): With regard to <b>one</b> who owns a field and has the rights to a path that passes through land belonging to another, and <b>he traveled to a country overseas, and</b> when he returned the <b>path to his field was lost,</b> i.e., he forgot where the path was located, <b>Admon says: He may go</b> only <b>on the shortest</b> path to his field, as although it is not known where the path is, he definitely did have a path, and therefore at the very least he has a right to the shortest path. <b>The Rabbis say: He must</b> either <b>purchase for himself</b> a new <b>path for</b> whatever price is asked, even if it is <b>one hundred dinars, or he will</b> have to <b>fly through the air</b> to reach his field, i.e., as long as he cannot prove where the original path was, he has no rights to any other path.",
            "<b>And we discussed</b> the mishna and thereby established the parameters of the dispute as follows: It is difficult <b>for the Rabbis</b> because <b>Admon is saying well,</b> i.e., the logic of his opinion would seem to be compelling. <b>And</b> in defense of the Rabbis’ opinion, <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: With what are we dealing here?</b> It is with a case <b>where</b> his field was <b>surrounded by four individuals</b> who owned the land <b>on</b> each of its <b>four sides.</b> Therefore, he cannot demand a path from any one of the surrounding owners, since each one can deflect his claim by suggesting that the path might have passed through one of the other owners’ land.",
            "However, this creates a further difficulty: <b>If so,</b> that the surrounding land is owned by different people, <b>what is Admon’s rationale</b> for ruling that the owner of the field has a claim to the shortest path? <b>And</b> in order to justify Admon’s opinion, <b>Rava said: With regard to</b> a case in which there are <b>four</b> current owners <b>who came</b> to own their land <b>on the basis of</b> purchase from <b>four</b> previous owners, i.e., each of the current owners acquired their land from a different previous owner, <b>and</b> also in a case in which there are <b>four</b> current owners <b>who came</b> to own their land <b>on the basis of</b> purchase from <b>one</b> previous owner who originally owned all four pieces of land, <b>everyone agrees that</b> the current owners <b>are able to deflect him</b> and his claim to a path.",
            "<b>When they disagree,</b> it is <b>in</b> a case in <b>which</b> there is only <b>one</b> current owner of all four pieces of land, <b>who came</b> to own his land <b>on the basis of</b> purchase from <b>four</b> previous owners. <b>Admon holds</b> that the owner of the field <b>can say to</b> the current owner of the surrounding land: <b>Whichever way</b> you construe the case, <b>my path</b> to my field is somewhere <b>with you</b> in the surrounding land. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that the owner of the surrounding land can deflect this claim because <b>he can say to him: If you</b> do not press your claim and <b>are silent,</b> then <b>be silent,</b> and I will sell you a path at a reasonable price. <b>But if not,</b> and you insist on pressing your claim, then <b>I will return the bills</b> of purchase of the land <b>to their</b> previous <b>owners, and</b> then <b>you will not be able to</b> successfully <b>engage in a legal dispute with them,</b> as each one could claim that the path went through one of the other pieces of land not owned by them.",
            "Having established the parameters of the dispute, the Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the statement of <b>Rabbi Abba, who said</b> that the original verdict stands, <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> When the owner of the field forgot where his path was located, the surrounding land was owned by four different owners, and therefore at that time the verdict was that he had no ability to successfully claim his path. The Rabbis apparently assume that that verdict stands, and therefore the field owner is considered to have lost any rights to the path. Consequently, even if the surrounding pieces of land are later purchased by a single person, the owner of the field cannot make a claim for his path.",
            "The Gemara continues: <b>And</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yirmeya, who said</b> that the original verdict is repealed, <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Admon.</b> Admon apparently assumes that although the original verdict was that the field owner has no ability to successfully claim his path, nevertheless, that does not mean he loses his rights to the path. Rather, once the situation changes and the surrounding pieces of land are purchased by a single person, the original uncertainty is revived to allow him to make a claim for at least the shortest path to his field.",
            "The Gemara rejects the comparison: <b>Rabbi Abba</b> could have <b>said to you: When I stated</b> my ruling, it was <b>even in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Admon. Admon states</b> his ruling <b>only there,</b> in the case of the lost path, <b>because</b> the field owner <b>said to</b> the owner of the surrounding land: <b>Whichever way you</b> look at it,"

        [
            "<b>my one path is with you</b> in one of your pieces of land. Since his claim is based on facts that are clear and certain, his claim is successful. <b>However, here,</b> in the dispute over the inheritance, <b>is</b> the son of uncertain descent <b>able to state</b> a claim like <b>this?</b> Although the son of uncertain descent claims that ultimately, whatever the nature of his relationship with the deceased is, he should have the right to inherit, nevertheless, since it is not actually known what that relationship is, his claim in reality is merely a composite of uncertain claims.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yirmeya</b> could have <b>said to you: I stated</b> my ruling <b>even in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> since perhaps <b>the Rabbis state</b> their ruling <b>only there,</b> in the case of the lost path, <b>because</b> the owner of the surrounding land <b>said to</b> the field owner: <b>If you</b> do not press your claim and <b>are silent,</b> then <b>be silent</b> and I will sell you the path at a reasonable price; <b>but if not,</b> then <b>I will return the bills</b> of purchase of the pieces of land <b>to their</b> previous <b>owners and</b> then <b>you will not be able to</b> successfully <b>engage in a legal dispute with them.</b> He is successful with this claim because it is within his power to return the fields and thereby recreate the original circumstances in which the owner of the field would forfeit the path. <b>However, here, are</b> the sons of the <i>yavam</i> <b>able to state</b> a claim like <b>this?</b> The original circumstance, in which the inheritance of the deceased had still not been divided, cannot be recreated. Therefore, a claim based on that circumstance will be unsuccessful.",
            "The Gemara brings another case, that of one of <b>uncertain</b> descent, who is either the son of the deceased or the son of the <i>yavam</i>, <b>and</b> the <b><i>yavam</i> who came to divide up</b> the <b>possessions of the grandfather,</b> i.e., the father of the <i>yavam</i> and the deceased, and each one made a claim to the inheritance.

One half is mine because I am the grandfather’s son, and the other half, which would have gone to my deceased brother, I should receive by virtue of the fact that I consummated the levirate marriage with his widow.",
            "The Gemara rules on this case: This is a case in which <b>the <i>yavam</i> has a definite</b> claim because he is the grandfather’s son, <b>and</b> the son of <b>uncertain</b> descent has only <b>an uncertain</b> claim, and the <i>halakha</i> is that one with <b>an uncertain claim cannot extract</b> property <b>from</b> one who has <b>a definite</b> claim to it. Therefore, the <i>yavam</i> receives all the inheritance.",
            "The Gemara raises yet another case, that of one of <b>uncertain</b> descent, who is either the son of the deceased or the son of the <i>yavam</i>, <b>and the sons of the <i>yavam</i> who came to divide up</b> the <b>possessions of the grandfather,</b> and each one made a claim to the inheritance.

            "The Gemara rules on this case: <b>The half</b> of the grandfather’s possessions <b>that</b> the son of uncertain descent <b>concedes</b> belongs <b>to them,</b> the sons of the <i>yavam</i>, <b>they take</b> for themselves. By claiming to be the son of the brother who died first, he forfeits any rights to the other brother’s portion. <b>The third</b> of the grandfather’s possessions <b>that</b> the sons of the <i>yavam</i> <b>concede</b> belong <b>to him,</b> the son of uncertain descent, <b>he takes</b> for himself. By claiming he is their brother, they admit that he should at least receive an equal portion to them, which would mean one-third if they are three. This <b>leaves them</b> with <b>one-sixth [<i>danka</i>]</b> of the possessions that <b>is property of uncertain ownership, and</b> so <b>they</b> should <b>divide</b> it <b>up</b> between them.",
            "The Gemara presents two additional cases. One is a case where a son of uncertain descent, who is either the son of the deceased or the son of the <i>yavam</i>, died, and <b>the grandfather and the <i>yavam</i></b> come to divide up the <b>possessions of the</b> son of <b>uncertain</b> descent. In the absence of any children, a father inherits from his son.

The <i>yavam</i> claims that the son of uncertain descent was his own son, and therefore he should inherit from him. <b>Or,</b> the second case is one in which the <i>yavam</i> died and <b>the grandfather and the</b> son of <b>uncertain</b> descent come to divide up the <b>possessions of the <i>yavam</i>.</b> The son of uncertain descent claims to be the lone son of the <i>yavam</i> and therefore he should inherit, whereas the grandfather claims that the son of uncertain descent was the son of the deceased and that the <i>yavam</i> died childless, and therefore the grandfather, who is the father of the <i>yavam</i>, should inherit from him.",
            "The Gemara rules in these cases: This <b>is</b> a case of <b>property of uncertain ownership, and</b> so <b>they</b> should <b>divide up</b> the possessions between them.",

This is in contrast to a betrothed woman, concerning whom Beit Hillel rule that she may not sell such property because her betrothed also has rights to it (<i>Ketubot</i> 78a).",

            "If the <i>yavam</i> <b>consummated the levirate marriage with her, then</b> her legal status is <b>that of his wife in every sense,</b> and therefore the <i>yavam</i> has the same rights to her property as in a regular marriage. <b>And</b> the <b>only</b> exception to this is <b>that</b> her <b>marriage contract will</b> still <b>be</b> payable <b>from the property of her first husband</b> and not from the property of the <i>yavam</i>.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>the first clause,</b> concerning a <i>yevama</i> who is still alive, <b>that</b> Beit Shammai <b>do not disagree</b> with Beit Hillel that the woman has full possession of the property since there is only a levirate bond but no marriage, <b>and what is different</b> about <b>the latter clause that</b> Beit Shammai <b>disagree</b> with Beit Hillel and rule that the <i>yavam</i> does take a share of the property, which would imply that the levirate bond alone is sufficient to afford the <i>yavam</i> rights over her property?",
            "<b>Ulla said:</b> The two clauses concern different cases: <b>The first clause</b> concerns a case <b>where she happened</b> before her <i>yavam</i> for levirate marriage at a time <b>when she was a betrothed woman</b> and only then did she come into the possession of property. Since when she was betrothed her husband did not have any rights to the property, neither does the <i>yavam</i>. <b>And the latter clause</b> concerns a case <b>where she happened</b> before her <i>yavam</i> at a time <b>when she was a married woman.</b> In such a case, were her husband still alive, he would have full rights to the property; therefore, so does the <i>yavam</i>.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>And Ulla holds</b> that a levirate <b>bond</b> formed <b>with a betrothed woman affords</b> her a status equivalent to <b>a woman</b> about whom there is an <b>uncertainty</b> whether she is <b>betrothed,</b>"
        ],

However, since the new relationship exists only by virtue of a levirate bond, it exists to a lower degree, and so the rights afforded to the <i>yavam</i> are more limited than those the first husband would have enjoyed; the rights granted to the <i>yavam</i> are equivalent to the rights of husband in a case where there is uncertainty whether that level of relationship exists at all.",
            "The Gemara proceeds to demonstrate this: It must be that a levirate <b>bond</b> formed <b>with a betrothed woman affords</b> her a status equivalent to that of <b>a woman</b> for whom there is an <b>uncertainty</b> whether she is <b>betrothed, because if it enters your mind</b> to suggest that her status is equivalent to that of <b>a definitely betrothed woman, would Beit Hillel concede that she may sell or give</b> away her property <i>ab initio</i>, <b>and that</b> if she does the transfer <b>is valid?</b>",
            "<b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 78a): If <b>property was bequeathed to</b> a woman <b>after she was betrothed, Beit Shammai say: She may sell</b> that property, <b>and Beit Hillel say: She may not sell</b> that property.

            "Rabba challenges Ulla’s understanding of the mishna: <b>Rabba said to him:</b> If your explanation is correct, then in the latter clause, <b>instead of disagreeing</b> with regard to who has the rights to the property <b>itself,</b> which necessitates considering the case <b>after</b> her <b>death, let</b> Beit Hillel and Beit Shammai <b>disagree with regard to</b> the more immediate case <b>when she is</b> still <b>alive and</b> dispute who has the rights <b>to</b> the use and <b>produce</b> of the property.",
            "<b>Rather, Rabba said</b> a different resolution to the apparent inconsistency in Beit Shammai’s rulings: Both <b>this</b> first clause <b>and that</b> latter clause of the mishna concern a case in <b>which she happened</b> before her <i>yavam</i> for levirate marriage <b>once she was</b> already <b>a married woman, and</b> a levirate <b>bond</b> formed <b>with a married woman affords</b> her a status equivalent to that of <b>a woman</b> about whom there is an <b>uncertainty</b> whether she is <b>married.</b> The distinction between the two clauses is as follows: In the <b>first clause, where she is alive, she has a certain</b> claim to the property, <b>while they,</b> i.e., the <i>yavam</i>, are considered to have only <b>an uncertain claim</b> to the property, as she has the status of a woman for whom there is an uncertainty whether she is married. <b>And</b> since one who has <b>an uncertain claim cannot extract</b> property <b>from</b> one who has <b>a definite</b> claim to it, she therefore retains full possession of the property.",
            "In <b>the latter clause,</b> however, <b>where she died,</b> neither party has a definite claim; rather, <b>these</b> heirs of the father <b>come to inherit, and those</b> heirs of the husband <b>come to inherit, and</b> therefore <b>they should divide up</b> the property.",
            "<b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> Rabba’s opinion: <b>But</b> is it true that <b>according to Beit Shammai,</b> one with <b>an uncertain claim cannot extract</b> property <b>from</b> one who has <b>a definite</b> claim to it? <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Batra</i> 157a): In a case where <b>a house collapsed upon</b> a person <b>and upon his father,</b> or <b>upon him and upon those</b> from <b>whom he stood to inherit, and there were</b> outstanding debts <b>against</b> that person from his <b>wife’s marriage contract and</b> to <b>a creditor,</b> but he had no money with which to pay those debts, and it is not known who died first, the following situation arises: If the father died first, then before the son died he had already inherited the father’s property and therefore the son’s creditors gained a lien over that property and have the rights to collect their debts from that property even after the son’s death.",
            "Accordingly, the father’s heirs and the creditor offer opposing claims: <b>The father’s heirs say: The son died first and</b> only <b>afterward the father died.</b> Therefore, the creditor never gained any rights to collect from the property. <b>And the creditor says: The father died first and</b> only <b>afterward the son died.</b> Therefore, the father’s property was liened to the son’s debts, and the creditor has a right to collect.",
            "The mishna continues: <b>Beit Shammai say: They should divide up</b> the property between them. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> The <b>property</b> retains <b>its</b> previous ownership <b>status,</b> which in this case means that since the last known possessor was the father, so the father’s heirs gain full rights to it.",
            "Abaye explains his proof: <b>Isn’t</b> it the case <b>here</b> that <b>the father’s heirs</b> have a <b>definite</b> claim <b>and the creditor</b> has only <b>an uncertain</b> claim? Therefore, since Beit Shammai rule that the property should be divided up, it is apparent that they hold that one with <b>an uncertain claim can extract</b> property <b>from</b> one who has <b>a definite</b> claim to it.",
            "Rabba rejects the proof: Beit Shammai’s ruling in this case cannot be adduced as a proof because <b>Beit Shammai hold:</b> A debt recorded in <b>a bill</b> of debt <b>that is awaiting collection is as though it was already collected</b> to the extent that the creditor is considered to be in possession of the debt. Therefore, the creditor is considered to be in possession of the property to the same extent as the father’s heirs; consequently, the property is divided between them.",
            "<b>And from where do you say</b> that Beit Shammai hold this opinion? <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Sota</i> 24a): A married woman who secluded herself with another man after her husband had warned her not to do so is suspected of having committed adultery. To establish her guilt or innocence she is brought to the Temple, where she drinks the bitter waters. With regard to such women, if <b>their husbands died before they drank</b> the bitter waters, <b>Beit Shammai say: They collect</b> the money assured to them in <b>their marriage contracts and do not drink</b> the waters. <b>And Beit Hillel say: Either they drink,</b> and if they survive they collect their marriage contracts, <b>or</b> they do not drink and <b>they cannot collect their marriage contracts,</b> and all the husband’s property passes to his heirs.",
            "The Gemara clarifies the statement of Beit Hillel: Did Beit Hillel really mean: <b>Either they drink,</b> which implies they may actually choose to drink? But doesn’t <b>the Merciful One state: “And the man shall bring his wife”</b> (Numbers 5:15), which indicates that the ritual of drinking the bitter waters applies only when the husband is still alive, <b>and</b> in this case <b>there is no</b> husband to do so; consequently, she should not be able to drink. <b>Rather,</b> Beit Hillel’s intent is as follows: The only means by which a suspected adulteress is able to collect her marriage contract is by drinking the bitter waters and proving her innocence. Therefore, where this is not possible due to the death of the husband, <b>since</b> the wives <b>do not drink, they cannot collect their marriage contracts.</b>",
            "Rabba explains his proof from this mishna: <b>Isn’t</b> it the case <b>here that</b> the wife’s claim to her marriage contract <b>is uncertain</b> because there is <b>uncertainty whether she was unfaithful or whether she was not unfaithful, and</b> so it would appear that one with <b>an uncertain</b> claim <b>is coming and undermining</b> the <b>definite</b> claim of the husband’s heirs? This is untenable, as even were one to hold that someone with an uncertain claim can extract property from someone who has a definite claim to it, that would only allow for the money to be divided between the two sides, whereas in this case Beit Shammai rule that the creditor collects the entire debt. <b>Rather, conclude from</b> that mishna that Beit Shammai hold that a debt recorded in <b>a bill</b> of debt <b>that is awaiting collection is</b> considered <b>as though it were already collected</b> to the extent that the one who is owed the money is considered to be in possession of the debt. It is due to this reason that she is empowered to be able to collect her marriage contract.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why did <b>Abaye</b> object to Rabba’s opinion based on the mishna in tractate <i>Bava Batra</i>? <b>Let him object to</b> Rabba’s opinion <b>based on this</b> mishna in tractate <i>Sota</i> since based on Abaye’s assumption that a bill of debt is not considered as though it were already collected, this mishna perforce demonstrates that Beit Shammai hold that one with an uncertain claim can extract property from one who has a definite claim to it. The Gemara answers: Abaye did not object based on this mishna because he reasoned that <b>perhaps a woman’s marriage contract is different</b> from a regular bill of debt in that the Sages uniquely reinforced a woman’s hold over the debt in her marriage contract <b>due to</b> the increased <b>desirability</b> that this would bring her when trying to remarry. This would ensure that she would bring some money with her into a new marriage.",
            "The Gemara asks again concerning Abaye’s decision to object to Rabba’s opinion based on the mishna in <i>Bava Batra</i>: <b>Let him object to</b> Rabba’s opinion <b>based on</b> the case of the <b>marriage contract in the mishna</b> here (38a). In its latter clause, the mishna states that if a widow waiting for her <i>yavam</i> dies, Beit Shammai rule that her marriage contract and other property are divided between her father’s heirs and the <i>yavam</i>. In that case, the <i>yavam</i> has certain possession of that property, and the father’s heirs come with an uncertain claim to collect the value of the marriage contract. The fact that Beit Shammai rule that they should divide up the value of the marriage contract between them demonstrates that they hold that one with an uncertain claim can extract property from one who has a definite claim to it.",
            "The Gemara responds: In truth, Beit Shammai <b>do not disagree</b> on that point. The Gemara challenges this claim: Do they <b>not</b> disagree? <b>But it is</b> explicitly <b>taught</b> in the mishna that they disagree in that case: If the widow waiting for her <i>yavam</i> <b>died, what should be done with</b> the money assured to her in <b>her marriage contract, and with</b> her <b>property that enters and leaves</b> the marriage <b>with her? Beit Shammai say: The husband’s heirs should divide up</b> the property <b>together with the father’s heirs.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>This is what</b> that mishna <b>is saying:</b> If she <b>died, what should be done with</b> the money assured to her in <b>her marriage contract? And</b> the <i>tanna</i> then <b>left</b> this question unanswered, and addressed an additional case: What should be done with her <b>property that enters and leaves</b> the marriage <b>with her?

This is true with regard to her property that enters and leaves the marriage with her. <b>And</b> the mishna <b>does not teach</b> using the reverse formulation: Beit Shammai say that <b>the father’s heirs should divide up</b> the property <b>together with the husband’s heirs,</b> which would imply that the husband’s heirs had <i>de facto</i> possession of the property; this is true with regard to the payment of the marriage contract. <b>Conclude from here</b> that Beit Shammai did not rule what should be done with the payment of the marriage contract, as the Gemara claimed.",
            "The Gemara presents a third resolution to the apparent inconsistency in Beit Shammai’s rulings in the mishna: <b>Abaye said: The first clause</b> concerns a case in <b>which</b> property <b>was bequeathed to her when she was</b> still <b>a widow waiting for her <i>yavam</i></b> to perform levirate marriage or <i>ḥalitza</i>, and <b>the latter clause</b> concerns a case in <b>which</b> property <b>was bequeathed to her when she was</b> still <b>under,</b> i.e., married to, <b>her</b> first <b>husband,</b> before he died."

            "<b>And Abaye holds</b> that according to Beit Hillel, with regard to the husband’s rights to his wife’s property, <b>his hand is like her hand,</b> but not any stronger. Accordingly, the <i>yavam</i> has a weaker hand in her property than she does, because the rights of a <i>yavam</i> are always weaker than those of the husband himself. Therefore, she is considered to be in possession of the property, and when she dies, her heirs, i.e., her father and his heirs, inherit it. However, Beit Shammai assume that the husband’s hand is stronger than his wife’s hand. Therefore, the hand of the <i>yavam</i>, which is weaker than the husband’s hand, is nevertheless equally as strong as the hand of the <i>yevama</i>, and therefore they rule that if she dies, the <i>yavam</i> and her heirs divide up the property.",
            "<b>Rava said to him:</b> I hold that <b>if</b> the property <b>was bequeathed to her when she was</b> still <b>under the</b> first <b>husband, everyone,</b> i.e., both Beit Hillel and Beit Shammai, <b>agrees that his hand is stronger than her hand,</b> and therefore the hand of the <i>yavam</i> will be equally as strong as that of the <i>yevama</i>, and if she dies the property will be divided between the two sides.",
            "Therefore, Rava presents his own resolution to the apparent inconsistency in Beit Shammai’s rulings in the mishna: <b>Rather, both this</b> first clause <b>and that</b> latter clause concern cases in <b>which</b> property <b>was bequeathed to her when she was a widow waiting for her <i>yavam</i>. The first clause</b> concerns a case in <b>which</b> the <i>yavam</i> <b>had not performed a levirate betrothal with her,</b> and <b>the latter clause</b> concerns a case in <b>which he had performed a levirate betrothal with her.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains the rationale behind Rava’s explanation: <b>And Rava holds</b> that <b>according to Beit Shammai a levirate betrothal</b> with a <i>yevama</i> <b>affords</b> her a status equivalent in some aspects to a woman who is <b>definitely betrothed and</b> in other aspects to a woman about whom there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether she is <b>married.</b> The Gemara elucidates: She is similar to a woman who is <b>definitely betrothed</b> with regard <b>to nullifying</b> the levirate bond of <b>her rival wife,</b> so that the rival wife need not perform levirate marriage or <i>ḥalitza</i>. <b>And</b> she is similar to a woman about whom there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether she is <b>married</b> with regard to empowering the <i>yavam</i> <b>to divide up the property</b> that she attained while she was waiting for her <i>yavam</i>.",
            "The Gemara notes: An interpretation of the mishna <b>was stated in the name of Rabbi Elazar</b> that is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava. And</b> an interpretation of the mishna <b>was stated in the name of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina</b> that is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Abaye.</b>",
            "The Gemara objects: <b>And did Rabbi Elazar</b> actually <b>state this</b> interpretation that is in accordance with the opinion of Rava? <b>But didn’t Rabbi Elazar say: According to Beit Shammai a levirate betrothal acquires</b> the <i>yevama</i> <b>only</b> with regard <b>to nullifying</b> the levirate bond of <b>a rival wife</b> so that she need not perform levirate marriage or <i>ḥalitza</i>? This implies that it does not acquire her with regard to enabling the <i>yavam</i> to inherit from her. This, then, stands in contrast to Rava’s interpretation.",
            "The Gemara offers two possible solutions: <b>Reverse</b> the opinions, so that Rabbi Elazar is in accordance with Abaye, and Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, is in accordance with Rava. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Actually, do not reverse</b> the opinions, since Rabbi Elazar can be understood to be in accordance with the opinion of Rava, as <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> could have <b>said to you: When I said</b> the statement that implies that a levirate betrothal acquires in a very limited sense, the intention was only that its acquisition is limited in <b>that</b> giving her <b>a bill of divorce</b> is still <b>insufficient for her</b> in order to release her from the levirate bond; <b>rather, she also needs</b> to perform <b><i>ḥalitza</i>.</b> But to suggest <b>that he does not acquire</b> her with regard <b>to dividing up</b> the <b>property</b> she attained, <b>did I say that?</b> Certainly not, as in fact a levirate betrothal acquires her to that extent as well, as Rava assumes.",
            "<b>Rav Pappa said: The precise formulation of the mishna is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Abaye, even though</b> according to his opinion <b>it is difficult</b> that the mishna discusses the case in which <b>she died.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains Rav Pappa’s statement: The precise formulation of the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Abaye, <b>as it teaches:</b> Her <b>property that enters and leaves</b> the marriage <b>with her. What</b> is the meaning of: <b>That enters, and what</b> is the meaning of: <b>That leaves? Is it not: That enters into the domain of the husband and leaves the domain of the husband</b> when she dies, and then enters <b>into the domain of the father?</b> Interpreted in this way, the mishna explicitly considers the period in which she was still married to her first husband, and likewise, the case in which she came into the possession of property should be understood as referring to a case in which she did so while still married. This is consonant with Abaye’s interpretation, but not with Rava’s.",
            "And when Rav Pappa said: <b>Even though</b> according to his opinion <b>it is difficult</b> that the mishna discusses the case in which <b>she died,</b> he meant as follows: <b>Instead of disputing</b> who has the rights to the property <b>itself,</b> which necessitates considering the case <b>after</b> her <b>death, let</b> Beit Hillel and Beit Shammai <b>dispute</b> the more immediate case <b>when she is</b> still <b>alive and</b> dispute who has the rights to the use and <b>produce</b> of the property.",
            "The Gemara concludes: <b>And there is nothing more</b> to say concerning this matter, i.e., as Rav Pappa noted, while it is undeniable that the mishna’s formulation supports Abaye’s interpretation, it is equally true that the case discussed by the mishna would appear to challenge his interpretation.",
            "§ The mishna states: If the <i>yavam</i> <b>consummated the levirate marriage with her, then</b> her legal status is that of his wife in every sense. The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> is this said? <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said:</b> It is <b>to say that</b> once they have consummated the levirate marriage, the only way to legally dissolve the marriage is if <b>he divorces her with a bill of divorce,</b> but <i>ḥalitza</i> is of no avail, <b>and</b> after divorcing her, he is permitted to <b>take her back</b> to be his wife, as the prohibition against engaging in relations with one’s brother’s wife does not apply to her.",
            "The Gemara examines the first clause of Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina’s statement: <b>Isn’t</b> it <b>obvious</b> that to sever his relationship with her, <b>he divorces her with a bill of divorce?</b> The Gemara explains: It is necessary to teach this because <b>it could enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it is written: “And take her to him to be his wife and consummate the levirate marriage with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5), continuing to refer to the marriage as a levirate marriage even after the verse has stated that he took her as a wife, one might claim <b>the Merciful One is saying</b> that the <b>original levirate</b> bond <b>continues to be upon her,</b> and therefore, <b>with <i>ḥalitza</i>, yes,</b> they can sever the relationship, but <b>with a bill of divorce, no,</b> the relationship would not be severed. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that she is considered to be his wife to the extent that the relationship can be severed with a bill of divorce alone.",
            "The Gemara examines the second clause: <b>Isn’t</b> it <b>obvious</b> that after divorcing her, he is permitted to <b>take her back</b> to be his wife? The Gemara explains: It is necessary to teach this because <b>it could enter your mind to say</b> that the <b>mitzva that the Merciful One imposes upon him, he has performed,</b> and therefore <b>now</b> that there is no longer any mitzva to marry her, <b>she should</b> once again <b>be established</b> as forbidden <b>to him by the prohibition</b> against engaging in relations with one’s <b>brother’s wife.</b> To dispel this notion, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that she is considered to be his wife to the extent that there is no longer any prohibition against remarrying her.",
            "The Gemara challenges this ruling: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that this <b>is indeed so,</b> that she should be forbidden to him? The Gemara explains: <b>The verse states: “And take her to him to be his wife”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5), indicating that <b>once he has taken her,</b> her legal status is <b>that of his wife in every sense.</b>",
            "§ The mishna states: The <b>only</b> exception to this is <b>that</b> her <b>marriage contract will</b> still <b>be</b> payable from the property of her first husband and not from the property of the <i>yavam</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The Gemara explains: <b>A wife was acquired to him by Heaven,</b> and since he did not choose her as a wife, he did not obligate himself to pay her marriage contract.",
            "The Gemara qualifies the mishna’s ruling: <b>And if she has no</b> ability to collect her marriage contract <b>from the first</b> husband, since he died without leaving any property with which to pay it, the Sages <b>instituted an ordinance for her</b> benefit that she must receive a new marriage contract <b>from</b> her <b>second</b> husband, i.e., the <i>yavam</i>. This was instituted <b>so that she will not be demeaned in his eyes such that</b> he will easily <b>divorce her,</b> since doing so would incur a financial burden on his part.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The <b>mitzva</b> of levirate marriage <b>is for the eldest</b> of the brothers <b>to consummate the levirate marriage.</b> If the eldest <b>does not want</b> to do so, the court <b>goes to each of the</b> other <b>brothers</b> and requires them to do so. <b>If they do not want</b> to do so, the court <b>returns to</b> the <b>eldest</b> brother <b>and says to him:</b> The <b>mitzva is</b> incumbent <b>upon you; either perform <i>ḥalitza</i> or consummate the levirate marriage.</b>",

            "The <i>baraita</i> under discussion also presents another case that follows a similar model of initially being permitted, then prohibited, and then once again permitted. The Gemara analyzes the explanations of Rav Yitzḥak and Rava based on that clause of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Say the first clause</b> and try to explain it in a way consistent with the various explanations of the latter clause: The Torah states concerning the meal-offerings eaten by the priests: <b>“It shall be eaten unleavened in a sacred place”</b> (Leviticus 6:9); this indicates that doing so is <b>a mitzva,</b>"

            "The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to Rava, who said:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis;</b> according to him, <b>here,</b> in the first clause, <b>this is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: “It shall be eaten unleavened in a sacred place”</b> indicates that it is <b>a mitzva</b> for the priest who prepares the offering to eat it himself. <b>As, initially,</b> before the flour was consecrated, <b>it was among</b> all other foods that are <b>permitted to him:</b> If <b>he wishes, he may eat it, and if he wishes, he may</b> choose <b>not</b> to <b>eat it.</b> When the flour was consecrated, <b>it became forbidden</b> to him, <b>and</b> then once a handful was brought on the altar, <b>it reverted</b> from its forbidden status <b>and became permitted to him.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>it would revert to its original permitted status,</b> so that if <b>he wishes, he may eat it, and</b> if <b>he wishes, he may</b> choose <b>not</b> to <b>eat it.</b>",
            "The Gemara interjects that the logic of this last statement seems implausible: Could it be that if <b>he wishes, he may</b> choose <b>not</b> to <b>eat it?

            "<b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> should be understood as saying: One might have thought that if <b>he wishes, he may eat it, and if he wishes, another priest may eat it;</b> therefore, <b>the verse states: “It shall be eaten unleavened in a sacred place”</b> (Leviticus 6:9), to teach that it is <b>a mitzva</b> for the priest who prepares the offering to eat it himself. This explanation of the first clause of the <i>baraita</i> is entirely consistent with Rava’s explanation of the latter clause concerning the mitzvot of levirate marriage. In his opinion, both clauses demonstrate that there is a mitzva to perform an action in a case where one might have thought there was none.",
            "<b>However, according to Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi, who said</b> that the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Abba Shaul</b> and explained the <i>baraita</i> accordingly as teaching the correct manner in which the mitzva is to be performed, <b>here,</b> in the first clause concerning the meal-offering, <b>what two manners</b> of eating <b>are there</b> of which one would be prohibited?",
            "<b>And if you would say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> might refer to two types of eating and is saying: One might have thought that if <b>he wishes he may eat it with an appetite, and if he wishes he may eat it</b> though an act of <b>excessive eating,</b> forcing himself to eat despite already being fully satiated; perforce this is not correct, as does <b>excessive eating have the</b> legal <b>status of</b> an act of <b>eating?

From this it is apparent that excessive eating does not have the legal status of an act of eating.",
            "The Gemara therefore suggests a different interpretation of the <i>baraita</i> that is consistent with Rav Yitzḥak’s opinion: <b>Rather,</b> say the <i>baraita</i> is referring to two different manners in which the meal-offering was prepared: If <b>he wishes he may eat it unleavened,</b> and if <b>he wishes he may eat it leavened.</b>",
            "The Gemara interjects that the logic of this last statement seems implausible: Could it be that if he wishes, the offering could be leavened? <b>But isn’t it written: “Their portion shall not be baked leavened”</b> (Leviticus 6:10), <b>and Reish Lakish said</b> that both the handful brought on the altar <b>and even the</b> priest’s <b>portion shall not be baked leavened?

Understood in this way, this clause of the <i>baraita</i> is also consistent with Rav Yitzḥak’s opinion.",
            "The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>this</b> possibility of eating the meal-offering <b>boiled, what are the circumstances,</b> i.e., how is it classified? <b>If it is</b> considered to be <b>unleavened</b> because it is presumed that the flour never managed to rise before it was cooked, <b>then it is unleavened</b> and there is no reason to prohibit its use; <b>and if it is not</b> considered to be <b>unleavened</b> because it is presumed that the flour managed to rise before it was cooked, then it is certainly disqualified from use because <b>the Merciful One states</b> that the offering must be <b>“unleavened”</b> (Leviticus 10:12). How, then, could one ever have questioned whether it is permitted to eat the meal-offering if it was boiled?",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>No; actually, I</b> could <b>say to you</b> that the boiled meal-offering <b>is</b> considered to be <b>unleavened, and</b> nevertheless it is disqualified because it is <b>for this</b> very reason that <b>the verse repeated</b> the requirement that it be unleavened, in order <b>to invalidate</b> a meal-offering that was boiled.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if boiled flour is invalid as a meal offering, then with regard to this statement <b>that we said</b> that <b>boiled</b> flour <b>is unleavened, for what <i>halakha</i></b> is it relevant? The Gemara answers: It is <b>to say that a person fulfills his obligation with it on Passover.</b> This is because <b>even though he initially boiled it, since he subsequently baked it in an oven, it is called “bread of affliction”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:3), <b>and</b> therefore <b>a person fulfills his obligation with it on Passover.</b>",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with his <i>yevama</i> is like</b> any <b>one of the</b> other <b>brothers with respect to</b> the <b>inheritance</b> of the deceased brother’s estate, i.e., each of the brothers takes an equal share of the inheritance. <b>And if there is a father</b> of the deceased, who is still alive, <b>the property</b> of the deceased <b>belongs to the father.

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks with regard to the opening clause of the mishna: The fact that one who performs <i>ḥalitza</i> does not gain any special rights to the inheritance of the deceased brother <b>is obvious;</b> why did the mishna teach it? The Gemara answers: <b>It could enter your mind to say</b> that the <b><i>ḥalitza</i> takes the place of the levirate marriage and</b> therefore the brother who performs <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>should take all the property</b> in the same way as one who consummates the levirate marriage. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> that the mishna’s point is to teach that by performing <i>ḥalitza</i> one is not afforded any additional rights to the inheritance, why is the mishna formulated as: <b>He is like</b> any <b>one of the</b> other <b>brothers,</b> placing the emphasis on what he gains? <b>It should have</b> instead taught: <b>He is</b> still <b>only like one of the</b> other <b>brothers,</b> which would emphasize the mishna’s point that by performing <i>ḥalitza</i> he does not gain any additional rights.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the mishna needs to teach the opening clause in this manner because <b>it could enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since</b> by performing <i>ḥalitza</i> with his <i>yevama</i> <b>he caused her to forfeit</b> the possibility of consummating the <b>levirate marriage, he should be penalized</b> and should forfeit any entitlement to his brother’s property. Therefore the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so.",
            "§ The mishna states: <b>If there is a father</b> of the deceased, who is still alive, the property of the deceased belongs to the father. The Gemara explains: <b>As the Master said</b> with regard to the laws of inheritance (<i>Bava Batra</i> 115a): <b>A father</b> of the deceased <b>takes precedence over all</b> the father’s <b>descendants.</b> Therefore, since the father is still alive, the brothers do not inherit at all.",

            "§ The mishna continues by citing an opposing opinion. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> In either case, whether he consummated levirate marriage or performed <i>ḥalitza</i>, if there is a father who is still alive, the property belongs to the father. The Gemara cites a ruling on this dispute: <b>Ulla said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda. And similarly, Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>",
            "<b>And Ulla said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa</b> who said: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda? As it is written: “And it shall be that the firstborn that she bears</b> shall succeed in the name of his dead brother” (Deuteronomy 25:6). The term “firstborn” is understood to be a reference to the <i>yavam</i>. By referring to him in this way the Torah indicates that his rights to his brother’s estate are <b>like</b> those of <b>a firstborn</b> child’s rights to his father’s estate: <b>Just as a firstborn has no</b> rights to any of his father’s estate <b>during the lifetime of the father,</b> and he may take his double portion only upon the father’s death, <b>so too, this</b> <i>yavam</i> <b>as well has no</b> rights to any of his brother’s estate <b>during the lifetime of the father.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> there is truly a comparison between the <i>yavam</i> who consummated the levirate marriage and a firstborn, then one should also say that <b>just as the firstborn takes a double portion</b> of his father’s estate <b>after the death of the father, so too, this</b> <i>yavam</i> <b>should</b> become entitled to <b>take a double portion</b> of the father’s estate <b>after the father’s death,</b> i.e., the portion due to him as a son, and that portion that would have been awarded to his brother. However, this is not the case; if the <i>yavam</i> is not actually the father’s firstborn then he receives only an equal portion of the inheritance together with the other brothers.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>Is it written</b> in the Torah: <b>He shall succeed in the name of his father?</b> No, <b>it is written: “He shall succeed in the name of his dead brother,”</b> which indicates that he succeeds his brother <b>but not in the name of his father,</b> i.e., the Torah never granted him any special entitlement to his father’s estate, and so he should not receive a double portion of it.",
            "The Gemara asks: Since Rabbi Yehuda holds that the <i>halakha</i> that the <i>yavam</i> inherits from his brother, which is stated in the verses describing levirate marriage, applies only when the father is no longer alive, perhaps the other <i>halakhot</i> in those verses also apply only when the father is no longer alive, and accordingly one should <b>say: When there is no father</b> who is still alive, which means <b>that</b> the <i>yavam</i> <b>takes the inheritance,</b> only then <b>should the mitzva of levirate marriage apply,</b> but <b>when there is a father</b> who is still alive, which means <b>that</b> the <i>yavam</i> <b>does not take the inheritance,</b> in that case <b>the mitzva of levirate marriage should not apply.</b>",
            "The Gemara rejects the possibility of saying this: <b>Does the Merciful One make</b> the mitzva of <b>levirate marriage dependent upon inheritance?</b> Certainly not; rather, in all cases the <i>yavam</i> <b>should consummate the levirate marriage, and</b> then <b>if there is an inheritance</b> to which he is entitled, <b>he takes</b> it, <b>and if not, he does not take</b> it.",
            "<b>Rabbi Ḥanina Kara,</b> the Bible expert, <b>was sitting before Rabbi Yannai, and he was sitting and saying:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b> Rabbi Yannai <b>said to him: Leave</b> the study hall <b>and recite your verses outside,</b> as you are incorrect in your ruling; in fact, the <b><i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>",

Since the Sages decreed that a <i>ḥalutza</i> is to be regarded as though she had actually been married to the one who performed <i>ḥalitza</i>, such that her close relatives are forbidden to him, did <b>they</b> also <b>decree</b> that the prohibition of <b>secondary</b> forbidden <b>relationships</b> should also apply <b>in</b> the case of <b>a <i>ḥalutza</i>, or not?</b>",

However, when there is a mitzva to consummate levirate marriage, that prohibition does not apply, due to the levirate bond between the <i>yavam</i> and <i>yevama</i>. Although following <i>ḥalitza</i> the levirate bond is dissolved, the woman’s status as a <i>ḥalutza</i> means that only the lesser prohibition against marrying a <i>ḥalutza</i> applies to her, and she does not return to her original forbidden status. Shmuel claims that the rival wives of the <i>ḥalutza</i> are not considered to be represented in her act of <i>ḥalitza</i>; consequently, they are not afforded a status similar to that of the <i>ḥalutza</i> herself. Therefore, he assumes that following <i>ḥalitza</i> the rival wives once again become subject to the original prohibition against marrying a brother’s wife.

There,</b> in the case of uncertainty, <b>if Elijah were to come and say that</b> the man <b>betrothed this one</b> of the sisters, then <b>she would be eligible for <i>ḥalitza</i> and levirate marriage.</b> It is clear, then, that fundamentally the sister who was betrothed is actually eligible for levirate marriage, and it is merely a lack of knowledge that prevents her from entering into it.",
            "However, <b>here,</b> with regard to a woman during the first three months following her previous marriage, <b>if Elijah were to come and say that this</b> woman <b>is not pregnant, would one pay heed to him and would we allow</b> the <i>yavam</i> <b>to consummate levirate marriage?</b> Certainly not, <b>as</b> is evident from the fact that <b>a minor girl, who cannot become pregnant, must</b> also <b>wait three months.</b> Evidently, the requirement to wait three months applies in all situations, even those in which the reason for the requirement is irrelevant. Therefore, by virtue of that decree the <i>yevama</i> is considered to be fundamentally ineligible for levirate marriage and similarly is ineligible for <i>ḥalitza</i>.",
            "§ The Gemara mentioned that a <i>yevama</i> is supported from her deceased husband’s estate. It now proceeds to cite a <i>baraita</i> that teaches this <i>halakha</i>: <b>The Sages taught: A <i>yevama</i></b> during <b>the first three months</b> following her husband’s death <b>receives sustenance</b> payments <b>from the husband’s</b> estate. This is because her previous marriage to him is the cause of her current unmarried state, since is it due to that marriage that she must first wait three months before remarrying. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward, she does not receive sustenance</b> payments, <b>neither from the husband’s</b> estate <b>nor from the <i>yavam</i>,</b> as he has not yet consummated a levirate marriage with her.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: If the <i>yavam</i> <b>was brought to judgment</b> and it was decided that he was obligated to either consummate the levirate marriage with her or perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>and he ran away</b> to avoid doing so, <b>she receives sustenance</b> payments <b>from</b> the estate <b>of the <i>yavam</i>,</b> which is his penalty for neglecting his duty.",
            "The Gemara asks: If <b>she happened before</b> her <b><i>yavam</i></b> who is <b>a minor</b> for levirate marriage, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>From the <i>yavam</i> she does not have</b> any right to sustenance payments because, as a minor, he is unable to consummate a levirate marriage, but as to payments <b>from</b> her <b>husband’s</b> estate, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Since his death placed her in a situation that forces her to remain in an unmarried state, does his estate have to take the responsibility of supporting her?",
            "<b>Rav Aḥa and Ravina disagree with regard to</b> this matter: <b>One said she does have</b> rights to sustenance payments, <b>and</b> the other <b>one said she does not have</b> any rights. <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>she does not have</b> any rights to sustenance payments. This is because the husband is not considered to be responsible for her situation; rather, it is thought that <b>she was penalized by Heaven.</b>",
            "§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> In the case of <b>a <i>yevama</i> with whom the brothers</b> of her deceased husband <b>performed <i>ḥalitza</i> within three</b> months of her husband’s death, she still <b>needs to wait three months</b> before remarrying."

            "If they performed the <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>after three</b> months, <b>she does not need to wait three months</b> and may marry immediately.",
            "The Gemara infers from the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i>: It <b>must be</b> that <b>the three months that are stated</b> throughout the <i>baraita</i> are counted <b>from the time of the husband’s death and not from the time of the <i>ḥalitza</i> of the <i>yavam</i>.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from</b> the case of <b>a bill of divorce, where Rav said</b> that the three months are counted <b>from the time of the giving</b> of the bill of divorce, <b>and Shmuel said</b> that the count is <b>from the time of the writing</b> of the bill. If a couple is secluded together after the bill of divorce is written, the bill of divorce is invalid. Therefore, there is no concern that they were secluded from that time. This is why Shmuel holds that the three months are counted from the writing. Rav apparently assumes that even so, the count always begins from the formal end of the marriage and not from the point from which there was no possibility of her becoming pregnant. Why, then, does the <i>baraita</i> not rule also in the case when a woman happens for levirate marriage, that the count should begin from the point of <i>ḥalitza</i>, since the marriage is only fully severed at that point?",
            "<b>Rava said:</b> With regard to a <i>yevama</i>, all agree that the count begins from the time of her husband’s death. This can be derived through an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, as follows: If <b>a prohibition</b> that entails <b><i>karet</i>,</b> i.e., the prohibition against engaging in relations with one’s brother’s wife in the event she is pregnant and not subject to levirate marriage, <b>you have permitted</b> after three months from the husband’s death, then in the case of a standard <b>negative prohibition,</b> such as the prohibition against engaging in relations with a woman within three months of the death of her previous husband, is it <b>not all the more so</b> clear that she should be permitted to remarry after three months from her husband’s death? Therefore, even Rav agrees that in this case, the count begins from the husband’s death.",
            "§ The mishna states: <b>And similarly, all other women may</b> not be betrothed or marry until they have waited three months. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, a <i>yevama</i></b> has to wait, <b>in accordance with</b> the reason <b>that we said,</b> that if she is pregnant with viable offspring, consummating the levirate marriage would violate the prohibition against engaging in relations with one’s brother’s wife. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>all other women, why</b> shouldn’t they remarry immediately even if they are pregnant?",
            "<b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that the verse states</b> with regard to Abraham: <b>“To be a God to you and your seed after you”</b> (Genesis 17:7), which indicates that the Divine Presence rests with someone only when his seed can be identified as being descended from him, i.e., there are no uncertainties with regard to their lineage. Therefore, to prevent any uncertainties concerning the lineage of her child, the woman must wait so that it will be possible <b>to distinguish between the seed of the first</b> husband <b>and the seed of the second</b> husband. After three months, if she has conceived from her previous husband, the pregnancy will already be noticeable.",
            "<b>Rava raised an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Therefore,</b> on account of the requirement to wait three months, <b>a male convert and a female convert</b> who were originally married to each other and converted <b>need to wait three months</b> before they may remarry following their conversion. Rava asks: <b>Here,</b> in this case, <b>what</b> reason <b>is there to distinguish?</b> Even if they do not wait and she is found to be pregnant, it is clear who the child’s parents are.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>Here, too, there is</b> a need <b>to distinguish between seed that was sown in sanctity,</b> i.e., a child conceived by a Jewish parents, <b>and seed that was not sown in sanctity,</b> i.e., a child conceived by gentile parents.",
            "<b>Rava stated</b> a different reason for the need to wait: It is a rabbinic <b>decree lest</b> a child be born and be incorrectly identified as the son of his mother’s second husband when he is fact the son of her first husband. This could result in him <b>marrying his paternal sister,</b> unaware of the true relationship between them, <b>or consummating a levirate marriage with the wife of his maternal brother</b> under the misconception that his maternal brother was also his paternal brother. This would be prohibited because the prohibition to engage in relations with one’s brother’s wife is waived only in the case where there is a mitzva of levirate marriage, which applies only to paternal brothers.",
            "<b>Or</b> in the event that his mother’s second husband died and he was assumed to be his only offspring, <b>he would cause his mother to go out</b> and be permitted <b>to the</b> general <b>public</b> because, under the misconception that he was the offspring of the deceased, he assumed that there was no mitzva of levirate marriage. <b>Or,</b> in the event that his maternal brother died childless and the brother’s widow became subject to levirate marriage, under the misconception that he was the paternal brother of the deceased he might perform <i>ḥalitza</i> and <b>permit</b> his supposed <b><i>yevama</i> to</b> marry a man from <b>the</b> general <b>public.</b> To avoid these problems, the Sages decreed that a woman must wait before remarrying.",
            "<b>Rav Ḥananya raised an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In all of those</b> cases where the Sages prohibit a woman from marrying or consummating a levirate marriage, <b>I identify</b> that the prohibition is <b>due to an ordinance</b> instituted to prevent a violation of <b>forbidden relations, and here,</b> with regard to the prohibition against marrying within three months, it is <b>due to an ordinance for</b> the benefit of <b>the offspring.</b> Rav Ḥananya explains the challenge: <b>And if it is so</b> that Rava’s understanding of the prohibition against marrying within three months is correct, then <b>all of the</b> cases of forbidden marriages are <b>due to an ordinance</b> to prevent violation of <b>forbidden relations.</b> However, the <i>baraita</i> indicates otherwise.",
            "The Gemara defends Rava’s opinion and explains that the <i>baraita</i> can be interpreted in a way that is consistent with his understanding: When the <i>baraita</i> says that <b>this</b> prohibition is <b>due to an ordinance for</b> the benefit of <b>the offspring,</b> it means <b>that</b> due to the prohibition the offspring <b>will not encounter</b> a prohibition of <b>forbidden relations.</b>",
            "§ The Gemara analyzes the prohibition against marrying before three months have passed: <b>Granted, she should not wait</b> for only <b>two months and</b> then <b>marry, as this is</b> still a case that could give rise to <b>an uncertainty whether</b> the child born to her seven months after remarrying <b>is nine</b> months <b>old,</b> i.e., counting from conception, and it is the offspring <b>of the first</b> husband, or <b>whether</b> the child is only <b>seven</b> months <b>old</b> and is the offspring <b>of the latter</b> husband.",

Why, then, is there a need to wait three months?",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>Even if she gave birth after eight</b> months since remarrying <b>one could say that</b> the child is the offspring <b>of the latter</b> husband, as <b>perhaps she waited one month</b> after remarrying <b>and conceived</b> only then. As such, the baby would be only seven months old, and that would explain its viability.",
            "The Gemara asks further: <b>But let her wait for two and a half months and</b> then <b>marry, as, if after seven</b> months since remarrying <b>she gives birth,</b> then <b>this</b> child <b>is</b> clearly <b>seven</b> months <b>old and is</b> the offspring <b>of the latter</b> husband. <b>And if after six and a half</b> months since remarrying <b>she gives birth,</b> then <b>this</b> child <b>is</b> clearly <b>nine</b> months <b>old</b> and <b>is</b> the offspring <b>of the first</b> husband, because <b>if</b> one would suggest <b>it is</b> the offspring <b>of the latter</b> husband, in that case it would be <b>six and a half</b> months <b>old,</b> at <b>which</b> age it <b>cannot survive.</b>",
            "The Gemara objects: <b>Even if after six and a half</b> months since remarrying <b>she gave birth, one could say that</b> the child is the offspring <b>of the latter</b> husband, <b>as Mar Zutra said: Even according to the one who says</b> that <b>a woman who gives birth after nine</b> months <b>does not give birth after an incomplete</b> number of months, i.e., she carries for a full nine months, nevertheless, <b>a woman who gives birth after seven months can give birth after an incomplete</b> number of months, and therefore it is possible that the baby was actually born after six and a half months.",
            "This fact is derived from the verse concerning the birth of Samuel the prophet, <b>as it is stated: “And it came to pass, when the seasons of the days had come,</b> that Hannah conceived, and bore a son” (I Samuel 1:20). How much time is indicated by the phrase “the seasons of the days”? <b>The minimal sense of</b> the word <b>“seasons” is two,</b> and since each season of the year is three months, that indicates six months. <b>The minimal sense of</b> the word <b>“days” is two.</b> Accordingly, one may conclude that Samuel the prophet was born after six months and two days.",
            "The Gemara suggests further: <b>But let her wait any</b> minimal <b>amount</b> of time, less than a month, <b>and</b> then <b>marry, and</b> then <b>when three months</b> after the end of her first marriage <b>are complete, examine her</b> body to see if she is noticeably pregnant.

            "<b>Rather,</b> the difficulty with the mishna is <b>from here, as it teaches: And any</b> of the teeth <b>that were individually removed on their own,</b> since they can serve a useful purpose they are considered utensils and can become <b>ritually impure.

            "<b>Abaye said: But what</b> is the <b>difficulty?

            "<b>Rav Pappa stated</b> an alternative resolution: <b>But what</b> is the <b>difficulty?

From the <i>baraita</i> it is apparent that if consummating the levirate marriage will ultimately lead to contention between the couple, it is preferable to perform <i>ḥalitza</i>. Similarly, in the case of the mishna, marrying four women will likely lead to contention since it is difficult to support so many people, and poverty will lead to strife. Therefore, the <i>yavam</i> should not be allowed to consummate levirate marriages with all of them.",
            "The Gemara qualifies the mishna’s case: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach that he has permission to consummate the levirate marriage with all of his <i>yevamot</i> in the case <b>where it is possible for him</b> to provide for all four women. The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> then the same should be true <b>even</b> if there are <b>many</b> more women <b>as well;</b> why does the mishna specifically discuss a case of four women?

But if there are any <b>more</b> than that, <b>no,</b> he should not, <b>in order that he will</b> be able to <b>meet the conjugal rights</b> of each woman at least once <b>in</b> each <b>month.</b> A Torah scholar is expected to provide conjugal relations once a week.

            "The Gemara suggests: <b>But let him perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with both of them;</b> why does the mishna state that he does so with only one woman? <b>Mar Zutra bar Toviya said: The verse states</b> that following the <i>ḥalitza</i> the man is called: <b>“The house of him who had his shoe removed”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:10). The fact that the word “house” appears in the singular indicates that <b>he performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with</b> only <b>one house,</b> i.e., only one of his brother’s wives, <b>and he does not perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with two houses.</b>",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>But let him consummate the levirate marriage with one and perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with the other.</b> The Gemara explains that <b>the verse states: “If</b> the man <b>does not wish</b> to take his <i>yevama</i>” (Deuteronomy 25:7), which implies that with regard to anyone who performs <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>were he to wish</b> to, <b>he could consummate the levirate marriage.</b> This teaches the principle that only <b>one who is eligible for levirate marriage is eligible for <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> but <b>one who is ineligible for levirate marriage is ineligible for <i>ḥalitza</i>.</b> And since, in the case of the mishna, if the <i>yavam</i> consummated the levirate marriage with one of his brother’s wives he may not do so with the second, consequently he may not perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with her either.",
            "<b>And furthermore,</b> an additional reason that one may not do so is so <b>that</b> people <b>should not say</b> that the brother’s <b>house was partially built</b> through levirate marriage <b>and partially released through <i>ḥalitza</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> even if <b>they will say</b> that, what of it?

            "The Gemara suggests a proof: <b>If</b> that were <b>so, why do I</b> need the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a rival wife of a forbidden relation, which is forbidden by the Merciful One</b> in the Torah? <b>Now</b> that even in the case of <b>two</b> women in <b>general,</b> where neither woman is a forbidden relation, <b>you say</b> that <b>they are not eligible for <i>ḥalitza</i> and levirate marriage, is it necessary</b> to say <b>a rival wife of a forbidden relation</b> is also forbidden? The fact that the Torah does prohibit a rival wife of a forbidden relation indicates that the mitzva of levirate marriage does exist in a general case of two wives in which neither is a forbidden relation.",
            "The Gemara objects: <b>Why not?</b> Even if one assumes that there is no mitzva of levirate marriage when the deceased brother had two wives, <b>it is</b> still <b>necessary</b> to teach the <i>halakha</i> concerning a rival wife of a forbidden relation because it could <b>enter your mind to say</b> that since there is no possibility of consummating the levirate marriage with her, <b>the forbidden relation stands outside</b> the calculation such that her presence is disregarded, <b>and her rival wife should enter into levirate marriage</b> as though she were the only wife.

By being immersed for the sake of slavery, he takes on the status of a full slave, which, among other things, obligates him to keep certain mitzvot. However, if the slave, or any gentile, is immersed for the sake of conversion, he then becomes a full Jew and fully obligated in mitzvot like any other Jew. <br>The Gemara considers the result of different intentions accompanying an immersion: <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ami’s slave immersed a certain gentile woman for the sake of</b> having <b>intimate relations,</b> i.e., to purify her from her menstrual impurity. <b>Rav Yosef said: I am able to render</b> both <b>her and her daughter fit</b> to marry into the congregation of Israel.",
            "<b>With regard to her,</b> I can render her fit <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Asi, as Rav Asi said</b> concerning a woman whose status as a convert was unclear but who lived as a part of the Jewish people and acted like all other Jewish women: <b>Didn’t she immerse for the sake of</b> purifying herself from <b>her menstruation?</b> Therefore, even if the original immersion was invalid, her intention in subsequent immersions was sufficient to be considered for the sake of conversion, since ultimately she immersed as an expression of her commitment to Judaism. She is therefore fully Jewish.",
            "And <b>with regard to her daughter,</b> she is the daughter of <b>a gentile or slave who engaged in intercourse with a Jewish woman,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> is that the lineage of <b>the offspring is unflawed.</b>",
            "The Gemara details the circumstances of Rav Asi’s ruling: There was <b>a certain</b> man <b>whom</b> people <b>would call: Son of the Aramean woman,</b> as they cast aspersions on the validity of his mother’s conversion. With regard to that case, <b>Rav Asi said: Didn’t she immerse for the sake of</b> purifying herself from <b>her menstruation?</b> A similar incident is recounted: There was <b>a certain</b> man <b>whom</b> people <b>would call: Son of an Aramean man,</b> as they cast aspersions on the validity of his father’s conversion. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Didn’t he immerse for the sake of</b> purifying himself from <b>his seminal emission?</b> That intention is sufficient to consider the immersion an immersion for the sake of conversion.",

The reason for this is presumably that upon her conversion she attains the rights to her slaves’ bodies, and therefore their immersion for the sake of becoming freemen would be ineffective. However, this contradicts the Gemara’s explanation above that when a Jew gains ownership of a slave from a gentile, he has a right to only the slave’s labor.",
            "To resolve the challenge <b>Rava said:</b> When the <i>baraita</i> says that because they immersed <b>before her</b> they acquired themselves, that is <b>whether</b> they immersed <b>without a specified</b> intention <b>or whether</b> they immersed <b>with explicit</b> intention to convert and become freemen. However, had they immersed <b>after her,</b> if they did so <b>with explicit</b> intention to convert, then <b>yes,</b> the immersion would achieve that end, but if they did so <b>without a specified</b> intention, then <b>no,</b> their immersion would, by default, be considered for the sake of slavery and they would not become free.",
            "<b>Rav Avya said: They taught</b> that one acquires only the rights to the slave’s labor <b>only with regard to</b> a Jew <b>who purchased</b> a slave <b>from a gentile</b> slave owner, <b>but</b> if <b>a gentile</b> sold <b>his</b> own <b>body</b> as a slave directly to a Jew, then the Jew <b>acquires</b> his body.",
            "<b>As it is written: “Moreover, of the children of the strangers that sojourn among you, of them you may acquire”</b> (Leviticus 25:45). The verse states only that <b>you,</b> i.e., Jews, <b>can acquire</b> a slave <b>from them,</b> i.e., a gentile slave, <b>but they cannot acquire</b> a slave <b>from you,</b> i.e., a Jewish slave, <b>and they cannot acquire</b> a slave <b>from one another.</b>",

However, until he has been immersed the acquisition is not fully complete, and therefore if the slave immerses himself with the intention to become free, then his immersion would achieve that end. The Gemara concedes: This is <b>difficult.</b>",
            "<b>Shmuel said: And</b> if one wishes to ensure that one’s slave does not declare the immersion to be for the sake of conversion, then <b>one needs to hold him tightly in the water</b> in a way that demonstrates the owner’s dominance over the slave at that time, thereby defining the immersion as one for the sake of slavery.",
            "That is <b>as</b> demonstrated <b>in this</b> incident <b>involving Minyamin, Rav Ashi’s slave:</b> When <b>he wished to immerse</b> him, <b>he passed him to Ravina and Rav Aḥa, son of Rava,</b> to perform the immersion on his behalf, and <b>he said to them: Be aware that I will claim</b> compensation <b>for him from you</b> if you do not prevent my slave from immersing for the sake of conversion. <b>They placed a bridle [<i>arvisa</i>] upon his neck,</b> and at the moment of immersion <b>they loosened it and</b> then immediately <b>tightened it</b> again while he was still immersed.",
            "The Gemara explains their actions: <b>They</b> initially <b>loosened it in order that there should not be any interposition</b> between the slave and the water during the immersion, which would invalidate it. <b>They</b> immediately <b>tightened it</b> again <b>in order that</b> the slave <b>should not preempt</b> them <b>and say to them: I am immersing for the sake of</b> becoming <b>a freeman.

            "<b>Rav Pappa said to Rava:</b> Has <b>the Master seen those of the house of Pappa bar Abba who give money</b> to the tax-collectors <b>on behalf of</b> poor <b>people to</b> pay <b>for their poll tax [<i>karga</i>], and</b> as a result <b>they would enslave them.</b> Anyone who did not pay the tax would be taken as a slave for the king. By paying for such people’s taxes, the members of the house of Pappa bar Abba essentially purchased those people, who had become the king’s slaves, for themselves. Rav Pappa asked: <b>When</b> those slaves <b>go free, do they require a bill of emancipation,</b> because the members of the house of Pappa bar Abba actually attained ownership of the slaves’ bodies, <b>or not,</b> as they were owned only for the sake of their labor?",

            "§ The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> once <b>happened</b> to come <b>to Gavla.

            "Later, <b>he came before Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> and told him what he had witnessed. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to him: Go and make</b> a public <b>declaration concerning their children that they are <i>mamzerim</i>, and concerning their wine</b> that it is forbidden <b>because</b> it is like <b>wine poured as an</b> idolatrous <b>libation, and concerning their lupines</b> that they are forbidden <b>because</b> they are <b>food cooked by gentiles.</b> One should be stringent and make such a declaration <b>because they are not</b> well-versed <b>in Torah,</b> and if they are left to be lax in this regard they will eventually transgress Torah prohibitions.",
            "The Gemara explains: With regard to the declaration <b>concerning their children that they are <i>mamzerim</i>, Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning</b> in two <i>halakhot</i>: The first is <b>as Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> One <b>is never</b> considered to be <b>a convert until he has been circumcised and has immersed. And since</b> the convert in the case in Gavla <b>had not immersed, he is</b> still considered <b>a gentile. And</b> the second <i>halakha</i> is as <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> With regard to <b>a gentile or a slave who engaged in intercourse with a Jewish woman, the offspring</b> of that union <b>is a <i>mamzer</i>.</b>",
            "<b>And</b> the reason to declare <b>concerning their wine</b> that it is forbidden <b>because</b> it is like <b>wine poured as an</b> idolatrous <b>libation</b> is that although their wine was not actually poured as an idolatrous libation, it was prohibited by rabbinic decree <b>due to</b> the maxim that: <b>Go, go, we say to a nazirite, go around and go around,</b> but <b>do not come near to the vineyard.</b> Although a nazirite is prohibited only from eating produce of the vine, he is warned not even to come into close proximity of a vineyard as a protective measure to ensure that he will not transgress this prohibition. So too, in many cases, the Sages decreed certain items and actions to be prohibited because they understood that if people would partake of them, they would eventually transgress Torah prohibitions.",
            "<b>And</b> the final declaration <b>concerning their lupines</b> that they are forbidden <b>because</b> they are <b>food cooked by gentiles</b> is issued <b>because they are not</b> well versed <b>in Torah.</b> The Gemara expresses astonishment: Does this imply that <b>were they students of the Torah</b> their lupines would <b>be permitted? Didn’t Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak say in the name of Rav: Any</b> food item <b>that is eaten as it is, raw, is not</b> subject <b>to</b> the prohibition of <b>food cooked by gentiles,</b> even when cooked by them? <b>But a lupine is not eaten as it is, raw, and</b> therefore <b>it is subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>food cooked by gentiles.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan holds</b> in this matter <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the other version</b> of what <b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak said in the name of Rav: Any</b> food item that lacks sufficient importance such that it <b>does not appear on the table of kings</b> in order <b>to eat bread with it is not</b> subject <b>to</b> the prohibition of <b>food cooked by gentiles.</b> Lupines lack importance and are therefore permitted even if cooked by gentiles. <b>And</b> consequently, <b>the</b> only <b>reason</b> to make a declaration prohibiting the residents of Gavla from eating them is <b>because they are not</b> well versed <b>in Torah,</b> and if they are left to be lax in this regard they will eventually become lax in actual Torah prohibitions; by inference, to those well versed <b>in Torah, it is permitted.</b>",
            "§ During their sojourn in Egypt, the children of Israel had the halakhic status of gentiles. At the revelation at Sinai they entered into a national covenant with God in which they attained their status of the Jewish people. This transformation was essentially the mass conversion of the people, and so their preparation for the revelation provides a paradigm of the process required for conversion for all generations. The <i>tanna’im</i> disagree as to which aspects of that original conversion are to be derived for all generations.<br> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a convert who was circumcised but did not immerse, Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that <b>this is a convert, as so we found with our forefathers</b> following the exodus from Egypt <b>that they were circumcised but were not immersed.</b> With regard to one who <b>immersed but was not circumcised, Rabbi Yehoshua says</b> that <b>this is a convert, as so we found with our foremothers that they immersed but were not circumcised.

            "The Gemara questions the opinions in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>But let Rabbi Yehoshua also derive</b> what is required for conversion <b>from</b> our <b>forefathers;</b> why didn’t he do so? <b>And let Rabbi Eliezer also derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> our <b>foremothers;</b> why didn’t he do so? <b>And if you would say</b> that Rabbi Eliezer did not derive the <i>halakha</i> from our foremothers because he holds <b>one cannot derive</b> the <b>possible from</b> the <b>impossible,</b> i.e., one cannot derive that men do not require circumcision from the <i>halakha</i> that women do not require it, because for women it is a physical impossibility, that claim may be refuted.",
            "It would appear that Rabbi Eliezer does not accept that principle, as <b>isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to</b> the <b>Paschal lamb</b> brought throughout the <b>generations that it may be brought only from non-sacred</b> animals? <b>A Paschal lamb is stated</b> in the Torah <b>in</b> reference to the lamb that the Jewish people brought prior to the exodus from <b>Egypt, and a Paschal lamb is stated in</b> reference to the yearly obligation throughout the <b>generations.</b> The association between them teaches that <b>just as the Paschal lamb stated in</b> reference to <b>Egypt was only brought from non-sacred</b> animals, since prior to the giving of the Torah there was no possibility to consecrate property, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>the Paschal lamb stated</b> in reference <b>to</b> the obligation throughout the <b>generations, it may be brought only from non-sacred</b> animals.",
            "<b>Rabbi Akiva said to him: But can one derive</b> the <b>possible,</b> i.e., the <i>halakha</i> for the Paschal lamb throughout the generations, where a possibility exists to bring it from consecrated animals, <b>from</b> the <b>impossible,</b> i.e., from the Paschal lamb in Egypt, where it was not a possibility? Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to him: Although it was impossible</b> to bring the Paschal lamb in Egypt from consecrated animals, nevertheless, <b>it is</b> still <b>a great proof, and we may learn from it.</b> It is apparent, then, that Rabbi Eliezer holds that one can derive the possible from the impossible.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>From where did he</b> derive this? <b>If we say</b> that he derived it <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it is written</b> that in preparation for the revelation at Sinai, God commanded Moses: <b>“Go unto the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments”</b> (Exodus 19:10), as Rabbi Yehoshua understands that the washing mentioned in this verse is the ritual immersion of clothes, this leads to the following <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>Just as in a case where</b> one became impure through contact with some source of impurity, <b>washing,</b> i.e., immersion, of clothes <b>is not required</b> but <b>immersion</b> of one’s body <b>is required,</b> then <b>in a case where washing</b> of clothes <b>is required,</b> as in the preparation for the revelation at Sinai, <b>isn’t it logical that immersion</b> of one’s body <b>should</b> also <b>be required?</b>",
            "The Gemara rejects the proof: <b>But perhaps</b> when the verse states that they had to wash their clothes, it was <b>merely for cleanliness</b> and not for the sake of ritual purity. If so, no <i>a fortiori</i> inference can be drawn from it to the case of immersion for ritual purity.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yehoshua derived it <b>from here,</b> where the verse states with regard to the formation of the covenant at Sinai: <b>“And Moses took the blood and sprinkled it upon the people”</b> (Exodus 24:8), <b>and it is learned</b> as a tradition <b>that there is no</b> ritual <b>sprinkling without immersion.</b> Therefore, our forefathers also must have immersed at Sinai, and consequently that is also an essential requirement for all conversions.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua, from where do we</b> derive that also <b>in</b> the case of our <b>foremothers</b> there was <b>immersion?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is</b> based on <b>logical reasoning, as, if so,</b> that they did not immerse, then <b>with what were they brought under the wings of the Divine Presence?</b> Therefore, they also must have immersed.",

            "The Gemara explains: <b>Who are the Rabbis</b> referred to in the <i>baraita</i>? It is <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b> Since Rabbi Yosei is merely an individual Sage, it was necessarily for Rabbi Yoḥanan to state explicitly that the <i>halakha</i> is ruled in accordance with his opinion.",

He holds that both circumcision and immersion must be performed specifically for the sake of conversion and are indispensable parts of the conversion process.

The phrase “he shall acknowledge” is apparently superfluous. It is therefore expounded to teach that the father is deemed credible so that <b>he can identify him [<i>yakirenu</i>] to others.

For this reason Rabban Gamliel maintains that a bill of divorce is not effective after a bill of divorce was given, and similarly levirate betrothal is not effective after levirate betrothal was performed.",
            "<b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> his opinion from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And Rabban Gamliel concedes that a bill of divorce is</b> effective <b>after levirate betrothal and levirate betrothal is</b> effective <b>after a bill of divorce.</b> If a <i>yavam</i> gave a bill of divorce to one <i>yevama</i> and then performed levirate betrothal with the other, or the reverse, both actions would be effective. <b>And</b> he also concedes that <b>a bill of divorce is</b> effective <b>after intercourse and levirate betrothal</b> such that if the <i>yavam</i> engaged in levirate betrothal with one <i>yevama</i>, engaged in intercourse with a second, and gave a bill of divorce to a third, the bill of divorce is effective and he is prohibited from marrying the relatives of the third <i>yevama</i>. <b>And</b> he concedes <b>that levirate betrothal is</b> effective <b>after intercourse and a bill of divorce,</b> such that if he gave a bill of divorce to one woman, engaged in intercourse with a second, and performed levirate betrothal with a third, the levirate betrothal is effective and the third woman requires a bill of divorce.",
            "<b>And if Rabban Gamliel is uncertain</b> with regard to the efficacy of levirate betrothal or a bill of divorce, then the third action should never be effective.

            "<b>Rather, Abaye said: Actually, it is obvious to Rabban Gamliel that a bill of divorce precludes</b> levirate marriage, <b>and that levirate betrothal acquires</b> the <i>yevama</i>. <b>Nevertheless, the Sages said</b> that with regard to <b>this <i>yevama</i>, in one respect a bill of divorce is effective for her, and in another respect levirate betrothal is effective for her,</b> but they are not effective in the same manner.

The mishna first is referring to a bill of divorce after a bill of divorce, but when it comes to the specifics, it mentions a bill of divorce after levirate betrothal. <b>Rav Yehuda said: This is what</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying:</b> With regard to <b>a bill of divorce after a bill of divorce, and levirate betrothal after levirate betrothal,</b> it is <b>as we said</b> and these cases were explained in the <i>baraita</i>, but with regard to <b>one <i>yavam</i> and one <i>yevama</i>, how is their</b> complex bond <b>released?</b> He then proceeds to delineate: If <b>he performed levirate betrothal with his <i>yevama</i> and gave her a bill of divorce, she requires <i>ḥalitza</i> from him.</b>",
            "§ The mishna teaches: If the <i>yavam</i> <b>performed levirate betrothal and engaged in intercourse, this is</b> done <b>in accordance with its mitzva.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that</b> this mishna <b>supports</b> the statement of <b>Rav Huna. As Rav Huna said: The mitzva of a <i>yevama</i> is</b> properly performed when the <i>yavam</i> <b>betroths</b> the <i>yevama</i> <b>and</b> only <b>afterward engages in intercourse.</b> This statement indicates that the levirate betrothal is a necessary component of the mitzva, and the mishna seems to imply the same. The Gemara refutes this claim: This is not necessarily the case, as you can read the mishna as stating that <b>this also is in accordance with its mitzva.</b> If he performed levirate betrothal and then engaged in intercourse, this too is a proper manner to proceed, but we do not have to interpret the mishna as indicating that this is the only way to fulfill the mitzva.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t</b> this <b>obvious?</b> If one can fulfill the mitzva without performing levirate betrothal, why would one think that levirate betrothal is detrimental? The Gemara answers: It was indeed necessary for the mishna to teach us this, for it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since the Master said</b> above (29b): <b>One who performs levirate betrothal with his <i>yevama</i> causes the levirate bond to dissipate from himself, and a</b> standard <b>bond of betrothal and marriage takes effect on him,</b> you might <b>say</b> that he <b>no</b> longer <b>performs a mitzva</b> when he carries out levirate marriage, as the levirate bond is no longer in place. The <i>tanna</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that we consider the levirate betrothal and the subsequent intercourse as part of the same process, which constitutes a mitzva.",
            "The Gemara continues: With regard to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself, Rav Huna said: The mitzva of levirate marriage</b> is properly performed when the <i>yavam</i> <b>betroths</b> the <i>yevama</i> <b>and afterward engages in intercourse, and if he engaged in intercourse and</b> later <b>performed levirate betrothal, he has acquired</b> the <i>yevama</i>. The Gemara is puzzled: <b>If he engaged in intercourse and</b> then <b>performed levirate betrothal it is obvious</b> that he has acquired her, <b>as he has</b> already <b>acquired her by intercourse.</b> The levirate betrothal does not affect the issue one way or another. <b>Rather, say</b> as follows: <b>If he engaged in intercourse without</b> prior <b>levirate betrothal,</b> even in that case <b>he has acquired</b> her.",
            "The Gemara challenges this: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that a <i>yavam</i> who has intercourse without levirate betrothal <b>is flogged?</b> The Gemara answers: The lashes are not because he transgressed by not performing levirate betrothal, but rather they are <b>lashes for rebelliousness</b> given for transgressing a <b>rabbinic</b> law, namely for acting in an immodest manner.",
            "The Gemara cites other instances where the Sages administered lashes for immodest behavior. <b>As Rav</b> would <b>flog one who betroths</b> a woman <b>by intercourse,</b> despite the fact that betrothal is effective by this method, because he acted in a promiscuous manner. <b>And</b> he would likewise <b>flog one who betroths</b> a woman <b>in the marketplace,</b> rather than at home, as this too is loose behavior, <b>and</b> he would also administer lashes <b>to one who betroths</b> a woman <b>without</b> a prior <b>marriage agreement</b> [<b><i>shiddukhei</i></b>], as this too is an act of permissiveness.",
            "<b>And</b> he would further lash <b>one who nullifies a bill of divorce</b> he had earlier sent by declaring in the presence of witnesses that the bill of divorce is nullified. This action is effective, but by doing so he transgresses the rabbinic ordinance of the Sages that bans such an action as it might lead his wife to unlawfully wed another. <b>And</b> he would also flog <b>one who delivers a declaration</b> preemptively invalidating <b>a bill of divorce,</b> by informing three people before giving a bill of divorce that he is not doing so of his own free will and he wants to cancel it ahead of time. Here too he will mislead his wife, who will assume it is a valid bill of divorce.",
            "<b>And</b> he would lash <b>one who behaves irreverently</b> toward <b>a messenger of the Sages,</b> even if the messenger is not a scholar, as he thereby shows disrespect to the Sages themselves. <b>And</b> he would administer lashes to <b>one who remained under an excommunication of the Sages</b> for <b>thirty days and did not go to the court and petition for</b> the removal of <b>his excommunication after</b> correcting the sin that led to the excommunication in the first place. This behavior demonstrates that he does not care about the excommunication, and is therefore deserving of lashes.",
            "<b>And</b> he would also lash <b>a son-in-law who lives in his father-in-law’s house,</b> as this is likely to lead to temptation between the younger couple and older couple who share the same house. The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>one who lives</b> in his father-in-law’s house, <b>yes,</b> he would lash him, but with regard to <b>one who</b> only <b>passed</b> through his father-in-law’s house at regular intervals, <b>no,</b> he would not lash him? <b>But</b> an incident occurred involving <b>a certain</b> man <b>who passed by the entrance to his father-in-law’s house and Rav Sheshet lashed him.</b> The Gemara explains: There was a special set of circumstances in that case, as <b>that</b> man <b>was suspected with regard to his mother-in-law,</b> and therefore he was lashed merely for passing near her house, as he thereby gave credence to the rumors.",
            "The Sages <b>of Neharde’a</b> would <b>say: In all</b> these cases <b>Rav would not flog, apart from</b> the case of one who <b>betrothed by intercourse and without</b> a prior <b>marriage agreement. And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> he would flog a man who betrothed by intercourse <b>even</b> if he did so <b>with</b> a prior <b>marriage agreement, due to the immorality</b> involved, as he must invite witnesses to observe the act.",
            "§ <b>The Sages taught: How</b> is <b>levirate betrothal</b> performed? <b>He gives her money or the equivalent</b> value of <b>money</b> and declares: You are hereby betrothed to me. The Gemara asks: <b>And with a document, how</b> does he betroth her? The Gemara is puzzled by this question: <b>With a document, how</b> does he betroth her? It is <b>as we have said</b> by the <i>halakhot</i> of a regular document of betrothal: If <b>he wrote to her on paper or on earthenware, even though it is not worth a <i>peruta</i>,</b> the words: <b>You are hereby betrothed to me,</b> it is effective. As a document is not effective as a means of betrothal due to its monetary value but rather due to the words it contains, there is no requirement that it be of a minimum value. However, because the <i>halakhot</i> of betrothal by a document were already taught, the Gemara is puzzled as to the nature of this question. <b>Abaye said</b> that <b>this is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> With regard to <b>the document of a marriage contract for levirate marriage, how</b> is it written? Abaye understands that the question did not refer to the document of betrothal but rather to the marriage contract of a levirate marriage.",
            "The Gemara explains that <b>he writes to her: I, so-and-so, son of so-and-so, have accepted so-and-so, my <i>yevama</i> upon me, to feed and maintain her in a fitting manner, provided that her marriage contract will</b> still <b>be</b> payable <b>from the property of her first husband</b> and not from the property of the <i>yavam</i>. The Gemara adds: <b>But if the first</b> husband <b>does not have</b> property, <b>the Sages instituted for her</b> that she should receive her marriage contract <b>from the second</b> husband, i.e., the <i>yavam</i>, for the same reason that they instituted the marriage contract in the first place: <b>So that she will not be demeaned in his eyes such that</b> he will easily <b>divorce her.</b> If he will suffer no financial penalty, he is likely to divorce over the smallest argument.",
            "§ <b>Abaye inquired of Rabba:</b> If a <i>yavam</i> <b>gave</b> his <i>yevama</i> <b>a bill of divorce, and said</b> the following formula: <b>You are hereby divorced from me but you are not permitted to any</b> other <b>man, what is</b> the status of such a bill of divorce? <b>Is the bill of divorce of a <i>yevama</i></b> a bill of divorce <b>based on rabbinic</b> law and therefore subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of a regular bill of divorce; and consequently, <b>a bill of divorce that is effective for a married woman is</b> also <b>effective for a <i>yevama</i>,</b> and <b>a bill of divorce that is not effective for a married woman is not effective for a <i>yevama</i>?</b> Since this type of a divorce is invalid in the case of a married woman, it is similarly ineffective in the case of a <i>yevama</i>. <b>Or perhaps</b> the Sages were concerned that <b>perhaps</b> people <b>will come to confuse</b> this bill of divorce <b>with</b> an unqualified <b>bill of divorce</b> given by a <i>yavam</i> and they therefore decreed that it should affect the levirate bond, preventing the <i>yavam</i> from marrying the <i>yevama</i>.",
            "Rabba <b>said to him: We are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> they will come to <b>confuse</b> this bill of divorce <b>with a</b> regular <b>bill of divorce,</b> and it therefore disqualifies a <i>yevama</i>. <b>Rabba bar Ḥanan strongly objects to this: However, if that is so,</b> that we are stringent with the bill of divorce of a <i>yevama</i> out of concern that people might confuse the two types of bills of divorce, if <b>he gives her a mere</b> piece of <b>paper,</b> which does not mention divorce, <b>so too will it disqualify her? He said to him: There</b> it is different, as a mere piece of paper has no effect on any other woman, for <b>it does not disqualify</b> her <b>for</b> marrying into <b>the priesthood.</b> If a husband gives his wife a piece of paper that contains nothing about divorce, even if he says: This is a bill of divorce, his action is of no consequence, not even to forbid her to a priest. <b>Here,</b> however, a bill of divorce of this kind at least <b>disqualifies</b> a woman from marrying <b>into the priesthood.</b>",
            "<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “They shall not take a woman that is a harlot, or profaned; <b>and a woman divorced from her husband they shall not take,</b> as he is holy to his God” (Leviticus 21:7). This verse lists the women whom a priest is prohibited from marrying. From this verse it can be inferred: <b>Even</b> if <b>she was only divorced from her husband</b> who said when giving her a bill of divorce: You are divorced from me, but did not permit her to other men, even such a woman <b>they may not take</b> in marriage. Although a bill of divorce of this kind does not permit the woman to others, it does suffice to prohibit her from marrying a priest. <b>And this is</b> what is referred to as <b>the trace of a bill of divorce, which disqualifies</b> a woman from marrying <b>into the priesthood.</b> Since this bill of divorce is valid to a certain extent, it also disqualifies a <i>yevama</i>.",
            "<b>Rami bar Ḥama said: They said</b> that <b>if one said to a scribe</b> [<b><i>lavlar</i></b>]: <b>Write a bill of divorce for my betrothed</b> now, <b>such that when I marry her I will divorce her</b> with the bill of divorce, if he indeed gave her this bill of divorce after their marriage <b>it is</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce.</b> Why? <b>Because it is</b> already <b>in his power to divorce her</b> while she is betrothed to him, and therefore the bill of divorce written during their betrothal is valid."
        ],
        [
            "<b>But</b> if he wrote a bill of divorce <b>for</b> a <b>regular woman</b> who has no connection to him, even if he later married her, it is <b>not a</b> valid <b>bill of divorce.</b> This is <b>because</b> at the time of the writing of the bill of divorce, <b>it is not in his power to divorce her,</b> and therefore the bill of divorce is of no consequence. All this is evident, but in light of the above <i>halakhot</i> <b>Rami bar Ḥama inquires:</b> If he wrote a bill of divorce <b>for his <i>yevama</i></b> and did not give it to her immediately, but only after they were married, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it a valid bill of divorce or not? The Gemara clarifies the options: On the one hand, <b>since she is tied to him</b> she is <b>considered like his betrothed; or perhaps, since he has not</b> yet <b>performed levirate betrothal with her,</b> she is <b>not</b> even considered the equivalent of his betrothed, and the bill of divorce is not effective? The Gemara does not have a resolution for this and states that the question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.",
            "<b>Rav Ḥananya inquires:</b> If <b>he wrote a bill of divorce for his levirate bond,</b> by specifying in the bill of divorce that he is thereby severing the levirate bond between them, <b>but not for his levirate betrothal,</b> or if he wrote a bill of divorce <b>for his levirate betrothal and</b> stated that it is <b>not for his levirate bond, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is the <b>levirate betrothal superimposed upon the levirate bond,</b> so that they are considered a single, continuous link, <b>and he is like one who divorces half a woman, and one who divorces half a woman has done nothing; or perhaps this stands on its own and that stands on its own,</b> and he can therefore cancel either the levirate bond or the levirate betrothal separately.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why do you not <b>resolve</b> the dilemma <b>from</b> a teaching of <b>Rava? For Rava said:</b> If a <i>yavam</i> <b>gave a bill of divorce for his levirate betrothal, her rival wife is permitted.</b> The levirate betrothal he had previously performed is thereby canceled, which leaves the bond intact, and the rival wife of this <i>yevama</i> remains available for levirate marriage. This indicates that levirate betrothal and the levirate bond are not connected. The Gemara answers: <b>To Rava it is obvious,</b> but <b>to Rav Ḥananya it is a dilemma. What,</b> then, is the <i>halakha</i>? Since no other proof is forthcoming, and Rav <b>Ḥananya</b> does not accept the teaching of Rava, the question remains undecided. The Gemara states that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.",
            "§ It was taught in the mishna: If the <i>yavam</i> <b>performed <i>ḥalitza</i> and</b> then <b>performed levirate betrothal,</b> nothing is effective after <i>ḥalitza</i> and this levirate betrothal is not valid. <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: This is the statement of Rabbi Akiva, who says</b> that <b>betrothal does not take effect on</b> those who are forbidden as they are <b>liable for</b> violating <b>a prohibition.</b> Once he has performed <i>ḥalitza</i>, the woman is forbidden to him due to the prohibition derived from the verse “So shall it be done to the man who does not build his brother’s house” (Deuteronomy 25:9), and betrothal is ineffective. <b>But the Rabbis say something is</b> effective <b>after <i>ḥalitza</i>.</b> Although the woman who performed <i>ḥalitza</i> is forbidden to him, if he does betroth her, his betrothal is effective, as with any regular prohibition.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And can you establish</b> that the mishna is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva? But doesn’t the first clause</b> of the mishna <b>teach:</b> If he <b>gave a bill of divorce and performed levirate betrothal, she requires a bill of divorce and <i>ḥalitza</i>. Now if</b> this is in accordance with <b>Rabbi Akiva’s</b> opinion, <b>once he gave her a bill of divorce, is levirate betrothal effective for her?</b>",
            "<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Akiva says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that if one gives a bill of divorce to his <i>yevama</i>, she is forbidden to him forever</b> and he no longer has the option of marrying her? As it <b>is stated</b> with regard to a woman who was divorced and married another man who subsequently died or divorced her: <b>“Her former husband, who sent her away, may not</b> take her again to be his wife” (Deuteronomy 24:4). Rabbi Akiva emphasizes the words “who sent her away,” implying that he may not remarry her <b>after sending</b> her <b>away.</b> This indicates that there is an instance where a husband may not remarry his wife even if she has not married another, merely because he has given her a bill of divorce. This applies to the case of a <i>yevama</i> where the bill of divorce she receives renders her permanently prohibited to him. According to Rabbi Akiva, once she is rendered prohibited to him, no further action performed by the <i>yavam</i> is effective, so why does the levirate betrothal performed require a bill of divorce?",
            "<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> This is not difficult because <b>the bill of divorce for levirate marriage</b> was established by the Sages and only has the force of <b>rabbinic</b> law, <b>and the</b> aforementioned <b>verse</b> is not a Torah prohibition, but rather <b>a mere support.</b> Therefore there is no Torah prohibition against marrying a <i>yevama</i> who received a bill of divorce, and the levirate betrothal performed afterward is effective according to Rabbi Akiva as well.",
            "With regard to the <i>halakha</i> of betrothal after <i>ḥalitza</i>, the Gemara notes: <b>This</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> as <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: These matters were only stated in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Akiva, who considers a <i>yevama</i> who underwent <i>ḥalitza</i> to be</b> prohibited <b>like a forbidden relation.</b> Therefore, any further betrothal is not effective with her, as is the case with forbidden relations. <b>But the Rabbis say something is</b> effective <b>after <i>ḥalitza</i>. And I say: When</b> is betrothal effective after <i>ḥalitza</i>? It is effective <b>when he betrothed for the purpose of marriage,</b> like the regular betrothal of any ordinary woman. <b>But</b> if <b>he betrothed her</b> after <i>ḥalitza</i> and specified that he is doing so <b>for the purpose of levirate marriage,</b> in that case <b>nothing is</b> effective <b>after <i>ḥalitza</i>.</b>",
            "<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with his <i>yevama</i> and then betroths her, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: If he betrothed her for the purpose of</b> regular <b>marriage she requires a bill of divorce from him;</b> if he betrothed her <b>for the purpose of levirate marriage she does not require a bill of divorce from him. And the Rabbis say: Whether he betrothed her for the purpose of</b> regular <b>marriage, or whether he betrothed her for the purpose of levirate marriage, she requires a bill of divorce from him,</b> as this betrothal is effective.",
            "<b>Rav Yosef said: What is the reason for Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s distinction between one who betroths his <i>ḥalutza</i> for the purpose of levirate marriage and one who does so for the purpose of regular marriage? It is because the Sages <b>considered him like</b> one who <b>hoes the property of a convert</b> who died without leaving heirs. The property of such a convert is ownerless, and whoever takes possession of it acquires its title. As one of the methods of taking possession of land is hoeing, if one hoed the property of this convert with the intention of acquiring it, it belongs to him. However, if he hoed the convert’s property <b>while</b> mistakenly <b>thinking</b> that the land <b>was his own,</b> even though he performed an act of acquisition, since he lacked the requisite intention <b>he has not acquired</b> the land. Here too, since the <i>yavam</i> intended to betroth her for the purpose of levirate marriage, and the levirate bond no longer exists, his action is not effective.",
            "<b>Abaye said to him: Are</b> the two situations <b>comparable? There,</b> in the case of hoeing, <b>he does not intend to acquire</b> the land as he works, as he thinks that it is already his, whereas <b>here he does intend to acquire</b> the woman. <b>This</b> case <b>is similar only to the one who hoes the property of this</b> deceased <b>convert while thinking it is that of a different convert.</b> The <i>halakha</i> in that case is <b>that he acquires</b> the land, despite his imprecise knowledge of what he is acquiring. Here too the betrothal should take effect regardless of his error.",
            "<b>Rather, Abaye said</b> that the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and the Rabbis cannot be explained in the above manner. Instead, he suggests: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> It is a case <b>where he said to</b> his <i>ḥalutza</i>: <b>Be betrothed to me with levirate betrothal. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b> that <b>levirate betrothal is superimposed upon</b> the <b>levirate bond,</b> and is therefore only possible when the bond exists, <b>and</b> since <b><i>ḥalitza</i> comes</b> and <b>releases the levirate bond,</b> levirate betrothal is not effective for her. <b>And the Rabbis hold: This,</b> the levirate bond, <b>stands on its own, and that,</b> levirate betrothal, <b>stands on its own.</b> Although the bond has been canceled, the formula of: Be betrothed to me with levirate betrothal, is effective. <b>At the outset,</b> before <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>if he had said to her: Be betrothed to me with levirate betrothal, would</b> this <b>not be</b> an <b>effective</b> betrothal despite the lack of connection between the levirate betrothal and the levirate bond? <b>Now too</b> it should be <b>effective,</b> even though she performed <i>ḥalitza</i>.",
            "<b>Rava said: If he said to her:</b> Be betrothed to me <b>with levirate betrothal, everyone agrees that it is effective,</b> and she is acquired. <b>And with what are we dealing here?</b> It is a case <b>where he said to her: Be betrothed to me with the levirate bond,</b> and the dispute is as follows: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b>"
        ],
        [
            "that <b>the levirate bond is substantial,</b> and this betrothal is based on the levirate bond. <b>And</b> in this case, the <b><i>ḥalitza</i> comes</b> and <b>releases the levirate bond.</b> Therefore this type of betrothal does not acquire the <i>ḥalutza</i>. <b>But the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>the levirate bond is not substantial,</b> that is, the bond itself does not create a connection between the <i>yavam</i> and <i>yevama</i>, and that in general, levirate betrothal acquires a <i>yevama</i> as a form of betrothal unrelated to the levirate bond. <b>And</b> consequently, <b>at the outset, if he had said to her: Be betrothed to me by the levirate bond, would</b> this <b>not be effective? Now too,</b> after <i>ḥalitza</i>, even without the bond, it should likewise be <b>effective.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Sherevya</b> suggested a different point of dispute and <b>said:</b> In a case when the woman performed <b>valid <i>ḥalitza</i>, if he</b> later <b>said to her: Be betrothed to me by the levirate bond, everyone agrees that it is not effective,</b> as there is no longer any bond. <b>And here,</b> they <b>disagree</b> with regard to one who performed <b>invalid <i>ḥalitza</i>.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>holds</b> that <b>invalid <i>ḥalitza</i> exempts</b> her from the levirate bond and disqualifies her from betrothal as a <i>yevama</i>. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that <b>invalid <i>ḥalitza</i> does not</b> fully <b>exempt</b> her, and some element of the levirate bond remains intact and she can therefore be betrothed with the levirate bond.",
            "<b>Rav Ashi said: Everyone</b> agrees that <b>invalid <i>ḥalitza</i> does not exempt</b> her and does not entirely nullify the bond. <b>And here</b> they <b>disagree</b> as to whether <b>a condition is</b> effective <b>with regard to <i>ḥalitza</i>.</b> When the <i>yavam</i> states he is performing <i>ḥalitza</i> on the condition that the <i>yevama</i> give him one hundred dinars, for example, is this condition effective and therefore the <i>ḥalitza</i> is nullified if the condition is not fulfilled? One <b>Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that <b>a condition is</b> effective <b>with regard to <i>ḥalitza</i>.</b> If the <i>yevama</i> fails to comply with the condition, the <i>ḥalitza</i> is ineffective and she can still be betrothed with the levirate bond. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>holds</b> that <b>a condition is not</b> effective <b>with regard to <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> and therefore the <i>ḥalitza</i> is always effective, and the subsequent levirate betrothal is ineffective.",
            "<b>Ravina said: Everyone agrees</b> that <b>a condition is</b> effective <b>with regard to <i>ḥalitza</i>, and here</b> they <b>disagree with regard to a compound condition.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>holds</b> that <b>we require a compound condition.</b> The man must explicitly stipulate that the <i>ḥalitza</i> should be effective if the condition is upheld, and that it should not be effective if she does not fulfill the condition. If he did not state both the positive and negative sides of the condition it does not take effect, and the <i>ḥalitza</i> is effective and the levirate bond is canceled.

            "§ The mishna teaches: If the <i>yavam</i> <b>performed <i>ḥalitza</i> and</b> then either <b>performed levirate betrothal, or gave a bill of divorce, or engaged in intercourse,</b> nothing is effective after <i>ḥalitza</i>.

The Gemara asks: <b>And the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna; why did he not state this? The Gemara explains: <b>The permission for a <i>yevama</i> to</b> marry a member of the <b>public is preferable to him.</b> He preferred to teach cases in which the <i>yevama</i> is permitted to marry any man from the general public as opposed to a situation where she is married to the <i>yavam</i>.",

            "The mishna further teaches: <b>How so?</b> If he performed <b>levirate betrothal with this</b> one and performed <i>ḥalitza</i> with that one, the first woman requires a bill of divorce to cancel the levirate betrothal. The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that this teaching <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel.

The fact that the Gemara does not state that the <i>ḥalitza</i> be performed with the woman who received levirate betrothal indicates that this <i>ḥalitza</i> is not a valid <i>ḥalitza</i> and would not be sufficient to exempt the rival wife.",
            "<b>And</b> this would constitute <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of <b>Rav Yosef’s</b> opinion, for he holds that it is preferable to perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with the woman who received levirate betrothal and thereby exempt the second woman. As the first woman requires a bill of divorce and therefore is necessarily disqualified from marrying into the priesthood, it is preferable to perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with her as well and consequently leave the second woman eligible to marry a priest. The Gemara refutes this claim: <b>Does</b> the mishna <b>teach: He should perform <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> which would imply that the <i>yavam</i> should do so <i>ab initio</i>? It <b>teaches</b> that <b>he performed <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> implying that the ruling in the mishna is <b>after the fact.</b> Therefore, there is no indication in the mishna that the <i>yavam</i> should perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with the second woman, and it is possible that if he were to perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with the first woman he would thereby exempt the second one. It is simply that the particular case discussed by the mishna here concerns a man who performed levirate betrothal with this woman and <i>ḥalitza</i> with that one.",
            "It is further taught in the mishna: If he gave <b>a bill of divorce to this one and a bill of divorce to that one,</b> they require <i>ḥalitza</i> from him. The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>it supports</b> the statement of <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna. As Rabba bar Rav Huna said:</b> In cases of <b>invalid <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> the <i>yevama</i> <b>is required to repeat</b> the <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>with all of the brothers,</b> as that single invalid <i>ḥalitza</i> is insufficient. Similarly, in this case of invalid <i>ḥalitza</i>, it would be necessary to perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with all of the <i>yevamot</i>. The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>require</b> in this context? It means that such women <b>require in general.</b> The plural form does not refer to all the <i>yevamot</i> mentioned in the mishna, but rather it means that all <i>yevamot</i> in similar situations require <i>ḥalitza</i>.",
            "It was taught in the mishna: If he gave <b>a bill of divorce to this one and performed <i>ḥalitza</i> with that one,</b> nothing is effective after <i>ḥalitza</i>.

The Gemara again rejects this proof: <b>Does it teach: He should perform <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> a ruling <i>ab initio</i>? <b>It teaches: He performed <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> which is only <b>after the fact,</b> meaning he acted in that manner in this particular case.",

In light of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s ruling, <b>it was necessary to teach us that betrothal does not take effect on</b> the rival wife of the woman who performed <i>ḥalitza</i>, despite the fact that she is only <b>liable for</b> violating <b>a prohibition,</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva.",
            "<b>However, according to Reish Lakish, who said</b> that the <b>entire household,</b> apart from the woman who received <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i>, was it necessary to teach us that betrothal does not take effect on</b> forbidden relations for which one <b>is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i>?</b> According to Reish Lakish, after the <i>yavam</i> performs <i>ḥalitza</i>, the mitzva of levirate marriage is canceled and the <i>karet</i> prohibition against marrying a brother’s wife is once again in force. As all agree that betrothal does not take effect on those liable to receive <i>karet</i>, it is unnecessary for the mishna to teach this ruling.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Reish Lakish</b> could have <b>said to you: And according to your reasoning,</b> that the mishna would not be teaching us an apparently obvious <i>halakha</i>, consider the <b>latter clause</b> of the mishna, <b>which teaches</b> that if a <i>yavam</i> <b>engaged in intercourse and</b> another <i>yavam</i> <b>performed levirate betrothal</b> with the same woman, the levirate betrothal is not effective.

            "<b>Rather,</b> it must be that not every clause in the mishna teaches a novel <i>halakha</i>, and the reasoning of the <i>tanna</i> is as follows: <b>Since he teaches the release of</b> the bond between <b>one <i>yavam</i> and one <i>yevama</i>, he also teaches</b> the case of <b>two <i>yevamot</i> and one <i>yavam</i>, and since he teaches</b> the case of <b>two <i>yevamot</i> and one <i>yavam</i>, he also teaches</b> the case of <b>two <i>yevamin</i> and one <i>yevama</i>.</b> The <i>tanna</i> therefore listed all possible cases even though we do not learn a novel <i>halakha</i> from each and every one."

            "The Gemara states: The principle that the initial stage of intercourse is considered sexual intercourse <b>does not come from</b> any <b>one</b> of the sources cited above. <b>Let it come</b> by deriving the <i>halakha</i> in any <b>one</b> other case <b>from</b> the common denominator of <b>two</b> of the sources mentioned above.

            "<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, strongly objects to this: What</b> comparison may be drawn based upon the precedent of <b>a menstruating woman and a brother’s wife, which are</b> stringent in that <b>they cannot be permitted</b> to others for the duration of <b>the existence of the</b> factor <b>that renders them prohibited?</b> A menstruating woman is forbidden as long as she experiences a flow of menstrual blood, while a brother’s wife is forbidden for the duration of the brother’s lifetime.

            "<b>Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina: Is that to say</b> that <b>it is</b> only during <b>the existence of the</b> factor <b>that renders them prohibited that a menstruating woman and a brother’s wife cannot be permitted</b> to others, <b>but afterward,</b> when the prohibiting factor has been resolved, <b>they can be permitted?</b> In the case of <b>a menstruating woman,</b>"

        [
            "<b>the matter depends upon days,</b> not blood. Although the flow of blood causes her to become impure, she remains impure for a full seven days regardless of whether she continues to experience menstrual bleeding for the duration of that time period. Similarly, in the case of <b>a brother’s wife, the Merciful One makes</b> her forbidden status <b>dependent upon children,</b> as, if she has children she remains forbidden to her husband’s brother even after her husband dies.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara <b>refutes</b> the derivation in the following manner: <b>What</b> comparison can be drawn from <b>a menstruating woman and a brother’s wife, which</b> are unique in <b>that</b> what <b>renders them prohibited does not render them permitted?</b> Each becomes permitted due to an external factor, i.e., the passing of seven days or the death of her childless husband. <b>Can you say</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of these cases apply <b>to a married woman,</b> whose prohibited status is different <b>in that the one who renders her prohibited</b> to the rest of the world, i.e., her husband, has the capacity to <b>render her permitted</b> through divorce?",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara offers another source for the <i>halakha</i> that the initial stage of intercourse is considered sexual intercourse. <b>Rabbi Yona said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua: The verse states</b> at the end of the chapter on forbidden relations: <b>“For whoever shall do any of these abominations, the souls that do them shall be cut off”</b> (Leviticus 18:29). <b>All those with whom relations are forbidden are compared</b> to each other in this verse, and therefore also <b>to a menstruating woman,</b> who is mentioned in that chapter. Consequently, <b>just as</b> one is liable to receive punishment for having sexual intercourse with <b>a menstruating woman</b> from the time of <b>the initial stage of intercourse, so too,</b> one violates <b>all</b> prohibitions against engaging in forbidden relations from the time of <b>the initial stage of intercourse.</b>",
            "The Gemara further asks: <b>But</b> if that is the source of this <i>halakha</i>, <b>why do I need</b> the term <b><i>nidda</i> that is written with regard to a brother’s wife?</b> The Gemara answers that it is needed <b>for that which Rav Huna</b> taught, <b>as Rav Huna said: From where in the Torah</b> is there <b>a hint to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a <i>yevama</i>?</b> The Gemara expresses surprise: <b>From where? Isn’t it written</b> explicitly in the verse <b>“Her brother-in-law will have intercourse with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5)? <b>Rather,</b> Rav Huna meant to say: <b>From where</b> is there <b>a hint that a <i>yevama</i> is forbidden</b> to her brother-in-law <b>in her husband’s lifetime,</b> even after she is divorced from her husband?",
            "The Gemara remains puzzled: No proof is needed for this <i>halakha</i> either, as <b>this is</b> based upon <b>logical reasoning: From</b> the fact <b>that the Merciful One says</b> the woman <b>is permitted</b> to her brother-in-law <b>after her husband’s death it may be inferred that in her husband’s lifetime she is forbidden</b> to him.",
            "The Gemara refutes this argument: <b>Perhaps after her husband’s death</b> it is <b>a mitzva</b> for her brother-in-law to marry her, whereas <b>during her husband’s lifetime</b> their marriage is <b>optional. Alternatively,</b> perhaps <b>after her husband’s death, yes,</b> she is permitted to him, while <b>during her husband’s lifetime, no,</b> they are not permitted to marry, but there is no punishment of <i>karet</i> if they do. This is because the source of the prohibition is the mitzva for them to marry after the husband’s death, <b>and a prohibition that stems from a positive mitzva</b> has the status of <b>a positive mitzva,</b> but nothing more.",
            "Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And if a man shall take his brother’s wife, it is impurity [<i>nidda</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 20:21). <b>Is his brother’s wife</b> necessarily <b>a menstruating woman [<i>nidda</i>]?

Is it considered to be a forbidden act of homosexual intercourse? The Gemara is puzzled by this dilemma: <b>With regard to a male, it is written</b> explicitly: “You shall not lie with a man <b>as with a woman”</b> (Leviticus 18:22), which indicates that anything considered an act of sexual intercourse with a woman is also considered an act of sexual intercourse with a man.",

The Gemara responds: This is in accordance <b>with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel, who said</b> that he <b>has acquired her only with regard to the matters stated in the chapter</b> of levirate marriage, but not with regard to other matters, and therefore she is not considered his wife with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>sota</i>.",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>The only reason</b> this proof was presented is to support the opinion of <b>Rav,</b> who is the one who holds that there is legal significance to a priest entering the wedding canopy with a woman who is unfit to marry him. <b>Didn’t Rav say he has acquired her for all</b> matters? The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here? For example,</b> a case where the <i>yavam</i> <b>performed levirate betrothal with her</b> and afterward had intercourse with her for the sake of promiscuity. <b>And this is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai, who say: Levirate betrothal acquires</b> a <i>yevama</i> in <b>a full-fledged</b> manner and removes the levirate bond. Therefore, when they have intercourse, they do not become fully married.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so,</b> the case of the <i>yevama</i> who was betrothed <b>is</b> the same as the case of <b>a betrothed</b> woman. What is the difference between the two cases? The Gemara responds: <b>And according to your reasoning,</b> are the examples in the mishna of <b>a married</b> woman <b>and a fully married</b> woman <b>not a single matter? Rather,</b> the mishna must be referring to two very similar cases, with the following difference: <b>A married</b> woman means <b>his own</b> wife <b>and</b> a fully <b>married</b> woman is referring <b>to that of his fellow,</b> i.e., his brother’s wife who became his wife through levirate marriage. <b>Here too,</b> the case of <b>a betrothed</b> woman is referring to <b>his own</b> wife <b>and</b> the case of <b>a widow waiting for her <i>yavam</i></b> is <b>that of his fellow,</b> i.e., his <i>yevama</i>, who is now betrothed to him.",
            "<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> Rava’s question can be resolved in a manner unrelated to the question about a priest entering the wedding canopy with a woman unfit for him. The <i>baraita</i> he cited <b>is</b> in accordance with <b>this <i>tanna</i>,</b> who does not require the man to be clear of iniquity, <b>as it is taught in a</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One cannot be jealous over a betrothed</b> woman and warn her not to seclude herself with a particular man in order <b>to cause her to drink</b> the <i>sota</i> waters <b>when she is betrothed, but one can be jealous over her to cause her to drink</b> the <i>sota</i> waters <b>when she is married,</b> even if she secluded herself with the man when she was still betrothed.",
            "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The question never arises at all, as the oath is formulated <b>by means of extension.</b> The woman cannot be forced to drink the <i>sota</i> waters for events that took place while she was betrothed.

Due to the fact that she is considered to be waiting for levirate marriage even vis-à-vis the brother who is rabbinically prohibited from marrying her, she is classified as a woman who is waiting for an invalid act of intercourse. Consequently, she may not partake of <i>teruma</i> until the consummation of the levirate marriage.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>According to whom</b> did Rabbi Yoḥanan make this statement? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, say that Rabbi Meir said</b> that a woman who is <b>reserved for an invalid</b> act of <b>intercourse may not eat</b> <i>teruma</i> when the act of intercourse is prohibited <b>by Torah</b> law. However, if the act of intercourse is prohibited <b>by rabbinic</b> law, <b>did</b> Rabbi Meir actually <b>say</b> that the woman is disqualified from eating <i>teruma</i>? <b>Rather,</b> if we say it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinions of <b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon, now</b> that they hold that even a woman who is <b>reserved for intercourse prohibited by Torah</b> law <b>may partake of</b> <i>teruma</i>, <b>is it necessary</b> to state that she may partake of <i>teruma</i> if she is reserved for intercourse prohibited <b>by rabbinic</b> law<b>?</b>",
            "<b>Rather, when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael <b>he said</b> an accurate version of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement: If a <i>yavam</i> who <b>performed levirate betrothal with his <i>yevama</i></b> has a brother, <b>all agree</b> that the <i>yevama</i> <b>may partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>.

In this case, since they have not yet performed <i>ḥalitza</i>, the levirate bond still applies by Torah law, but they are prohibited by rabbinic law from consummating the levirate marriage.",
            "<b>And Reish Lakish said: She may not partake</b> of <i>teruma</i> <b>because even according to Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon, who say</b> in the mishna that <b>she may partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>, <b>this applies only</b> to a case of betrothal, <b>as</b> a priest <b>can entitle</b> a woman <b>to partake</b> of <i>teruma</i> <b>in another case</b> via betrothal. <b>But here,</b> where he gave her a bill of divorce, <b>since he cannot entitle</b> a woman <b>to partake</b> of <i>teruma</i> <b>in</b> any <b>other case</b> by giving her a bill of divorce, <b>no.</b>",
            "<b>And lest you say here too,</b> in the case of a bill of divorce, <b>he can entitle her to partake of</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>when she returns</b> to her father’s house, this case is different for the following reason: A woman <b>who returns</b> to her father’s house <b>has been severed from</b> her husband <b>and she is close to her</b> father’s <b>house [<i>bei nasha</i>],</b> and therefore she may once again partake of <i>teruma</i> on her father’s account. <b>However, this</b> <i>yevama</i> who has received a bill of divorce <b>is</b> still <b>bound to</b> her <i>yavam</i> until they perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, and she is therefore disqualified from eating <i>teruma</i>.",

This indicates that her permissibility to him is determined according to the time of the betrothal rather than the time of marriage. The Gemara refutes this proof: <b>There it is different, as it is written: “He shall take for a wife”</b> (Leviticus 21:14). The superfluous expression “for a wife” indicates that he is permitted to marry the widow in this case.",
            "The Gemara objects: <b>Here, too,</b> with regard to a woman who matured after betrothal, <b>it is written:</b> “And he shall take <b>a wife</b> in her virginity,” and this should indicate that he may marry the grown woman in this case. The Gemara answers that the term “wife” allows for the inclusion of <b>one</b> case <b>but not two.</b> Consequently, since a High Priest may marry a widow he had betrothed before he was appointed High Priest, it cannot also be derived that he may marry a grown woman that he had betrothed before she matured.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And what did you see</b> that led you to include the case of a widow and exclude that of a grown woman?

The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> Rabbi Abba bar Zavda <b>was</b> merely <b>putting the Rabbis off</b> with an excuse, <b>as</b> the real reason why he would not marry was because <b>Rabbi Abba bar Zavda became impotent from Rav Huna’s discourse.</b> Rav Huna’s students would hold back from relieving themselves until his lengthy sermons were finished, which caused them to become sterile.",

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that if a priest married a woman forbidden to him, his wife’s <b>slaves of usufruct</b> property <b>do not partake of <i>teruma</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> is this so? <b>Let</b> this case <b>be like</b> that of <b>his acquisition who acquired an acquisition, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to a priest who married a woman and acquired slaves that they partake of <i>teruma</i>?

Here too, since the <b>slaves of usufruct</b> property belong to his wife, it should be permitted for them to partake of <i>teruma</i>.",
            "The Gemara answers: The principle is that <b>anyone who</b> is fit to <b>partake</b> of <i>teruma</i> can <b>enable</b> others <b>to partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>, and <b>anyone who does not partake</b> of <i>teruma</i> <b>cannot enable</b> others <b>to partake.</b> Since the priest’s wife in this case does not partake of <i>teruma</i>, as her marriage is forbidden, her slaves do not partake of <i>teruma</i> either.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it so that one who does not partake of <i>teruma</i> <b>cannot enable</b> others <b>to partake?

The Gemara answers: The difference is that <b>there,</b> in those cases, there is no inherent disqualification rendering them unfit to partake of <i>teruma</i>. The hindrance to their partaking of <i>teruma</i> is tantamount to a situation where <b>their mouths hurt,</b> and that is why they refrain from eating <i>teruma</i>. They retain, however, the fundamental right to partake of <i>teruma</i>, and therefore they can enable others to partake as well.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t</b> there the case of <b>a son born from an incestuous or adulterous relationship [<i>mamzer</i>]</b>, <b>who does not partake</b> of <i>teruma</i> yet <b>enables</b> others to partake? If an Israelite woman was married to a priest and was subsequently widowed or divorced, and a child from that union married a <i>mamzer</i> and then had a child, in that case, even if the woman’s child is dead, she partakes of <i>teruma</i> due to her grandchild, as she has a living descendant from a priest, although that descendant is a <i>mamzer</i>.

            "<b>And Rava said</b> a different solution. <b>By Torah</b> law, the forbidden wife’s slaves indeed <b>partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>, as they are included in the category of: His acquisition who acquired an acquisition. <b>And it was the Sages who issued a decree</b> prohibiting <b>them</b> from partaking of <i>teruma</i>, <b>so that</b> the woman unlawfully married to a priest <b>would say: I do not partake</b> of his <i>teruma</i> and <b>my slaves do not partake</b> of it either, so that she will realize that she is not a valid wife, but rather <b>she is</b> like <b>a prostitute to him.</b> Her husband will <b>therefore come to divorce her,</b> which is the desired outcome.",
            "<b>Rav Ashi said</b> a different reason for the prohibition: It is a rabbinic <b>decree lest she have</b> those slaves <b>partake</b> of <i>teruma</i> even <b>after</b> the <b>death</b> of her husband the priest.

            "<b>Rather, Rav Ashi said</b> that the decree is dealing <b>with a widowed priestess,</b> the daughter of a priest, who then married the High Priest, <b>as she is likely to rationalize</b> enabling her slaves to partake of <i>teruma</i> after the death of the High Priest as follows: <b>Initially,</b> my slaves <b>partook of the <i>teruma</i> of my father’s house.

            "The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> that the case of the rented cow is parallel to the case of guaranteed property? <b>Though</b> the renter <b>is indeed liable for theft and loss, is he liable for unavoidable accidents, for emaciation,</b> i.e., the cow became thinner or weaker for any reason, <b>or for</b> any other <b>decrease in its value?</b> Certainly he is not.

            "<b>Rava said</b> a different answer: <b>What is</b> meant here by the word <i>nashav</i>, which was translated earlier as his wives, but which can also be understood as <b>his women?</b> It refers here to the priest’s <b>mother,</b> who, after her husband the priest has passed away, may continue to eat <i>teruma</i> by virtue of her son.

            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from that which was taught in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Para</i> 5:5): If <b>a <i>tumtum</i> sanctified</b> the purification waters by placing a small amount of ashes from the red heifer into springwater that had been placed into a container for that purpose, <b>his sanctification is invalid because</b> there is <b>uncertainty</b> as to whether he is <b>uncircumcised, and an uncircumcised</b> man <b>is disqualified from sanctifying</b> the purification waters. <b>But</b> if <b>a hermaphrodite sanctified</b> the purification waters, <b>his sanctification is valid.

            "<b>Rav Yosef said: This <i>tanna</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i>, who disqualifies one who is uncircumcised from sanctifying the purification waters, <b>is a <i>tanna</i> from the school of Rabbi Akiva, who includes the uncircumcised</b> in the same <i>halakha</i> <b>as</b> that which governs <b>the ritually impure.

And so too, with regard to other matters as well, e.g., sanctifying the purification waters, one who is uncircumcised has the same status as one who is ritually impure.",

The Gemara refutes this argument: This is no proof, as <b>there</b> it can be argued that one who is uncircumcised is exempt from appearing in the Temple <b>because he is repulsive,</b> and it is unbefitting that one who is uncircumcised appear in the Temple courtyard, but this does not mean that with regard to other matters as well he is treated like one who is ritually impure.",

            "The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reasoning of the Rabbis? As it is written: “And they shall take for the impure of the ashes of the burning of the sin-offering,</b> and he shall place on it running water in a vessel” (Numbers 19:17). The juxtaposition of the placement of the water to the gathering of the ashes indicates that they are governed by the same <i>halakha</i>. Therefore, <b>those who are unfit for gathering</b> the ashes <b>are</b> likewise <b>unfit for sanctification,</b> whereas <b>those who are fit for gathering</b> the ashes <b>are</b> likewise <b>fit for sanctification.</b> Since a woman is fit to gather the ashes of the red heifer, she may also sanctify its waters.",

            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so,</b> according to Rabbi Yehuda <b>a woman</b> should <b>also</b> be fit to sanctify the purification waters. The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yehuda reads the verse precisely. It says: <b>“And he shall place</b> on it,” <b>and not: And she shall place</b> on it. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis</b> respond to this claim? <b>If</b> the verse <b>was written: And he shall take…and he shall place, I would say</b> that <b>one</b> individual must <b>take</b> the ashes <b>and</b> the same <b>one</b> must also <b>place</b> the water on them. <b>The Merciful One</b> therefore <b>writes: “And they shall take,”</b> indicating that the ritual is valid even when performed by two different individuals.",
            "<b>And if the Merciful One had written: And they shall take…and they shall place, I would say that two</b> people must <b>take</b> the ashes <b>and two</b> must <b>place</b> the water on them, but if these rites are performed by fewer than two people they are invalid. <b>The Torah</b> therefore <b>states: “And they shall take…and he shall place,”</b> to teach <b>that even</b> if <b>two</b> people <b>take</b> the ashes <b>and one</b> person <b>places</b> the water on them, the ritual is valid. Since the verse had to be formulated precisely in this manner in order to teach that <i>halakha</i>, the words “and he shall place” cannot be understood as coming to exclude a woman."

            "The Gemara returns to the previous discussion. <b>They raised a dilemma before Rav Sheshet:</b> In the case of <b>an uncircumcised</b> man, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> his eating second <b>tithe?</b> Can one claim that <b>just as</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing the <b>Paschal lamb is derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing second <b>tithe with regard to acute mourning,</b> in that an acute mourner, who may not eat second tithe, is likewise prohibited from partaking of the Paschal lamb, so <b>too,</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning second <b>tithe is derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning the <b>Paschal lamb with regard to lack of circumcision,</b> in that an uncircumcised man, who may not partake of the Paschal lamb, is likewise prohibited from eating second tithe?",
            "<b>Or perhaps</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing the <b>stringent</b> case of the Paschal lamb <b>is derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing the <b>lenient</b> case of second tithe, but the <i>halakha</i> concerning the <b>lenient</b> case of second tithe <b>is not derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning the <b>stringent</b> case of the Paschal lamb, and therefore it is prohibited for an uncircumcised man to partake of the Paschal lamb, but he may eat second tithe.",
            "Rav Sheshet <b>said to them: You</b> already <b>learned</b> the answer to this question in a mishna (<i>Ḥalla</i> 1:9): The following <i>halakhot</i> apply to both <b><i>teruma</i> and</b> the <b>first fruits</b> of the new harvest, which must be given to the priests: If a priest ate of them while in a state of ritual impurity, <b>he is liable</b> to the punishment of <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven; <b>and</b> if a non-priest ate of them unintentionally, he must restore the value of the produce he ate, adding <b>one-fifth</b> of its value as a fine; <b>and they are</b> both <b>forbidden to non-priests.</b>",
            "The mishna continues: <b>And they are</b> considered in all regards <b>the</b> private <b>property of the priest</b> to whom they were given; <b>and they are nullified,</b> i.e., rendered permitted for consumption by non-priests, <b>in</b> a mixture of <b>one hundred and one,</b> when there are at least one hundred parts of permitted food for each part of <i>teruma</i> or first fruits; <b>and they</b> both <b>require washing of the hands</b> before they may be eaten; <b>and</b> if a priest is ritually impure, he may not eat of <i>teruma</i> or first fruits, even after immersion, until after <b>sunset</b> on the day of his immersion.

            "The Gemara rejects this argument: This is no proof, as the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>taught</b> only some of the differences between <i>teruma</i> and first fruits on the one hand and second tithe on the other, <b>and he omitted</b> others.

            "§ Having cited the mishna, the Gemara proceeds to discuss it. It was taught in the <i>baraita</i> that second tithe and first fruits <b>are forbidden to an acute mourner; and Rabbi Shimon permits</b> an acute mourner to partake of first fruits.

            "The <i>tanna</i> adds: <b>And where one is</b> actually <b>warned against eating</b> second tithe in a state of impurity, this <b>I do not know.</b> Although it is obvious from the verse that this is prohibited, the source for the prohibition is unclear. The Gemara is puzzled by this last statement: The prohibition against eating second tithe when one is in a state of <b>ritual impurity of the body</b> is <b>explicitly written,</b> as it is stated with regard to the ritual impurity imparted by a creeping animal: <b>“The soul that touches it shall be impure until the evening, and he shall not eat from the holy things unless he has washed his flesh in water”</b> (Leviticus 22:6). This is referring to second tithe, as will be explained later (74b).",
            "The Gemara explains: Rather, <b>this is</b> the <b>dilemma he is raising: From where</b> is it derived that one may not eat it when the tithe <b>itself</b> is in a state of <b>ritual impurity?

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But say</b> perhaps as follows: <b>Of it you may not burn, but you may burn</b> and derive benefit from <b>consecrated oil that became ritually impure.</b> The Gemara refutes this suggestion: That possibility is unacceptable. Is it <b>not an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference? <b>If</b> with regard to <b>the tithe, which is lenient, the Torah said: “I did not burn of it while impure,”</b> then with regard to <b>consecrated</b> oil, <b>which is</b> more <b>stringent,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> prohibited to burn them while ritually impure?",
            "The Gemara retorts: <b>If so,</b> then with regard to <b><i>teruma</i> as well,</b> say that <b>it is an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, as <i>teruma</i> is certainly more sacred than tithes. If it is prohibited to benefit from second tithe while it is burning, all the more so would it be prohibited to benefit from <i>teruma</i> while it is burning. The Gemara answers: <b>Isn’t it written “of it”?</b> From there it is derived that there is an item excluded from the prohibition against burning in a state of ritual impurity.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And what did you see</b> that led you to conclude that “of it” comes to exclude <i>teruma</i>? Perhaps it comes to exclude consecrated items. The Gemara replies: <b>It is reasonable</b> that <b>I do not exclude consecrated items</b> from the prohibition against benefiting from their burning, as with regard to consecrated items there are many stringent elements. Their Hebrew acronym is <b><i>peh</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>kuf</i>, <i>ayin</i>, <i>kaf</i>, <i>samekh</i>,</b> which is a mnemonic for the following stringencies that apply to consecrated items and not to <i>teruma</i>:",
            "<b><i>Piggul</i>:</b> If, during one of the rites involved in the sacrifice of an offering, i.e., slaughter, receiving the blood, bringing it to the altar, or sprinkling it on the altar, the priest or the one bringing the offering entertains the thought of eating the offering at a time that is unfit for eating, the offering is thereby invalidated. <b><i>Notar</i>:</b> Meat of an offering that remained beyond its allotted time may not be eaten and must be burned. <b>Offering [<i>korban</i>]:</b> It is an offering to God. <b>Misuse</b> of consecrated objects <b>[<i>me’ila</i>]:</b> One who unwittingly derives benefit from consecrated items is required to bring a guilt-offering for misuse of consecrated objects. <b><i>Karet</i>:</b> The punishment of one who eats consecrated items while ritually impure is <i>karet</i>. <b>Forbidden to an acute mourner [<i>asur le’onen</i>]:</b> An acute mourner is prohibited from eating consecrated items. None of these <i>halakhot</i> apply to <i>teruma</i>. Therefore, consecrated items are more stringent than <i>teruma</i>, and accordingly they are not excluded from the prohibition against deriving benefit while ritually impure.",
            "The Gemara rejects this argument. <b>On the contrary, it is <i>teruma</i> that I would not exclude</b> from the prohibition, <b>as</b> with regard to <i>teruma</i> there are many stringent elements, represented by the acronym <b><i>mem</i>, <i>ḥet</i>, <i>peh</i>, <i>zayin</i>,</b> which is a mnemonic for the following: <b>Death [<i>mita</i>]:</b> One who is prohibited from eating <i>teruma</i> but ate it intentionally is liable to the punishment of death at the hand of Heaven. <b>One-fifth [<i>ḥomesh</i>]:</b> A non-priest, to whom <i>teruma</i> is forbidden, who unwittingly ate <i>teruma</i> is obligated to pay its value to the priest plus one-fifth of the sum. <b>And</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>does not have</b> the possibility of <b>redemption [<i>pidyon</i>]:</b> Once it is sanctified, <i>teruma</i> may not be redeemed and rendered non-sacred. <b>And it is forbidden to non-priests [<i>zarim</i>].</b> These stringencies do not apply to consecrated items.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Those</b> stringencies that apply to consecrated items <b>are</b> more <b>numerous</b> than those that apply to <i>teruma</i>. Therefore, it is appropriate to be more stringent with consecrated items and exclude impure <i>teruma</i> from the prohibition against deriving benefit from it while it is burned. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead a different reason, without counting the number of stringencies: Consecrated items are more stringent because one who eats them while ritually impure is liable to receive <b><i>karet</i>,</b> which <b>is more severe</b> than death at the hand of Heaven, the punishment in the case of <i>teruma</i>.",
            "It was further stated above that <b>one who eats</b> second tithe and first fruits <b>when they themselves,</b> the second tithe and first fruits, <b>are ritually impure is flogged, which is not</b> the case <b>with</b> regard to <b><i>teruma</i>.</b> The Gemara infers from this that <b>it is lashes that he does not receive</b> when he eats <i>teruma</i> that is ritually impure; <b>however,</b> the transgression of <b>a prohibition is</b> involved. <b>From where do we</b> derive that this is prohibited? <b>The verse</b> referring to offerings that have been disqualified <b>states: “You shall eat it within your gates”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:22). The word “it” indicates that it is only <b>this,</b> disqualified offerings, that may be eaten in a state of impurity, <b>but not another</b> type of consecrated food.

            "The Gemara demonstrated earlier that no proof can be adduced from the mishna cited by Rav Sheshet, as the <i>tanna</i> of that mishna taught only some of the differences between second tithe and <i>teruma</i>. <b>Rav Ashi said: From the first part</b> of the mishna <b>as well, you</b> can <b>conclude that he taught</b> certain differences <b>and omitted</b> others, <b>from</b> the fact that <b>he does not teach</b> the following additional difference:"

            "The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Granted,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to mention both <b>the Paschal lamb and sacrificial food.

It is no different than any other sacrificial food. In that case, the tithe mentioned in the <i>baraita</i> is referring to second tithe.",
            "The Gemara suggests a different refutation of this proof: <b>Rather,</b> the tithe mentioned in the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>first tithe,</b> the one-tenth of the produce that is given to the Levites, <b>and</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who said</b> that <b>first tithe is forbidden to common</b> Israelites.

            "With regard to the issue itself, the Gemara inquires: <b>And who</b> is the <b><i>tanna</i> who disagrees with Rabbi Akiva?

As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The burning</b> of the red heifer <b>by an acute mourner or by</b> one who <b>lacks atonement is valid. Rabbi Yosef the Babylonian says:</b> If the burning is performed by <b>an acute mourner,</b> it is <b>valid;</b> but if it is performed by one who <b>lacks atonement,</b> it is <b>invalid.</b> The anonymous first <i>tanna</i> clearly disagrees with Rabbi Akiva, as the previous <i>baraita</i>, which was attributed to Rabbi Akiva, states that one who lacks atonement is prohibited from participating in the preparation of the red heifer. It may be presumed that this <i>tanna</i> disagrees with Rabbi Akiva with respect to one who is uncircumcised as well.",
            "The Gemara further comments on this issue. <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak, too, maintains</b> that <b>an uncircumcised</b> man is <b>prohibited from</b> eating second <b>tithe, as Rabbi Yitzḥak said: From where</b> is it derived that <b>an uncircumcised</b> man <b>is prohibited from</b> eating second <b>tithe? It is stated:</b> “And I did not consume <b>of it</b> while impure” (Deuteronomy 26:14) <b>with regard to</b> second <b>tithe, and it is stated:</b> “Do not eat <b>of it</b> raw” (Exodus 12:9) <b>with regard to the Paschal lamb. Just as</b> in the case of <b>the Paschal lamb,</b> with regard to which <b>“of it” is stated, an uncircumcised</b> man <b>is prohibited from</b> eating <b>it, so too,</b> in the case of second <b>tithe,</b> with regard to which <b>“of it” is stated, an uncircumcised</b> man <b>is prohibited from</b> eating <b>it.</b>",
            "With regard to this verbal analogy, the Gemara comments: It must be that this phrase “of it” <b>is available,</b> i.e., it is superfluous in its own context and therefore available for the purpose of establishing a verbal analogy. <b>As, if it is not available,</b> the verbal analogy <b>can be refuted</b> logically, as it is possible to say: <b>What</b> is unique <b>to the Paschal lamb?</b> It is <b>that one is liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> <b>for</b> eating <b>it due to</b> it being <b><i>piggul</i> or <i>notar</i>, or</b> due to him being <b>ritually impure.</b> It could therefore be argued that it is owing to the Paschal lamb’s special sanctity and severity that an uncircumcised man may not partake of it. But from where is it derived that an uncircumcised man may not eat second tithe? The Gemara concludes: This is <b>not so,</b> as the phrase “of it” <b>is</b> indeed <b>available</b> for establishing the verbal analogy.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Which</b> of the phrases “of it” is not needed in its own context and <b>is</b> therefore <b>available</b> for establishing a verbal analogy? <b>Rava said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: “Of it” is written three</b> times <b>with</b> regard to <b>the Paschal lamb:</b> “Do not eat of it raw… And you shall not leave any of it until morning, and that which remains of it until the morning you shall burn with fire” (Exodus 12:9–10). The three instances of “of it” are expounded as follows: <b>One for itself,</b> to teach that the prohibition relates to the Paschal lamb; <b>and one for the verbal analogy; and one for</b> another purpose.",
            "<b>According to the one who says</b> that <b>the verse comes to provide you with a positive</b> mitzva to burn that which is left over <b>after</b> it has taught <b>the prohibition</b> against leaving it over until the morning, to teach that one is not flogged for violating the prohibition, because any prohibition that can be rectified by the performance of a positive mitzva does not carry a punishment of lashes; <b>since “that which remains [<i>notar</i>]” is written, “of it” is also written. And according to the one who says</b> that the verse comes <b>to provide him with the second morning for burning,</b> i.e., to teach that the leftover meat of the Paschal lamb is not burned on the following morning, which is a Festival, but rather on the following morning, the first of the intermediate days of the Festival; <b>since “until morning” is written, “of it” is also written.</b>",
            "Similarly, <b>“of it” is written three</b> times <b>with</b> regard to second <b>tithe:</b> “I did not eat of it in my mourning, and I did not consume of it while impure, and I did not give of it for the dead” (Deuteronomy 26:14). The three instances of “of it” are expounded as follows: <b>One for itself; and one for</b> that which <b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> said, that the verse comes to permit a priest to burn impure <i>teruma</i> oil and derive benefit from its light; <b>and one for</b> the following teaching of <b>Reish Lakish.</b>",
            "<b>As Reish Lakish said</b> that <b>Rabbi Samya said: From where</b> is it derived that if the <b>second tithe became ritually impure, it is permitted for one to anoint</b> one’s body <b>with it?

            "<b>Mar Zutra strongly objects to this: But say</b> that the verse is referring not to anointing but to <b>purchasing a coffin and shrouds for</b> one who is deceased with money received in exchange for the second tithe; this is prohibited, but buying clothing and the like for one who is living is permitted. <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: “Of it”</b> indicates benefit derived <b>from</b> the tithe <b>itself</b> and not from the money acquired in exchange for the tithe. <b>Rav Ashi said</b> a different answer: <b>“I did not give”</b> must be <b>similar to “I did not eat”; just as there,</b> eating is <b>from</b> the tithe <b>itself, so too here,</b> giving is <b>from</b> the tithe <b>itself.</b> In any event, the three instances of “of it” written with regard to second tithe are required for different expositions.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> yet there is <b>still</b> a difficulty, as the verbal analogy <b>is available</b> only <b>from one side,</b> since only the verse with regard to the Paschal lamb is superfluous in its own context.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>of Rabbi Abbahu</b> with regard to the burning of impure <i>teruma</i> oil <b>is derived from what Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh</b> said. <b>As Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And I, behold, I have given you the charge of My <i>terumot</i>”</b> (Numbers 18:8)?

            "§ It is taught in the mishna that the wife of a priest with <b>crushed testicles</b> or a severed penis may eat <i>teruma</i> on his account, provided that they have not engaged in sexual relations since his injury. The Gemara asks: <b>Who is</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>who taught</b> with regard to a woman <b>awaiting intercourse that would disqualify</b> her from marrying into the priesthood <b>by Torah</b> law, as in this case, where the woman would become disqualified from marrying into the priesthood if she had relations with her injured husband, that such a woman <b>may eat</b> <i>teruma</i>? <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> This <i>halakha</i> <b>is subject to dispute, and it is</b> taught in the mishna in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon,</b> who similarly stated that a widow betrothed to a High Priest may eat <i>teruma</i> on his account, provided that he has not engaged in sexual relations with her.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The mishna can be understood <b>even</b> if <b>you say</b> that <b>it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who maintains that a widow betrothed to a High Priest may not eat <i>teruma</i> on his account, as <b>it is different here, as she</b> had <b>already eaten</b> <i>teruma</i> on her husband’s account before his injury. Since she has done nothing to disqualify herself, she retains her presumptive status as one for whom it is permitted to eat <i>teruma</i>.",
            "<b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> counter this argument? He maintains that <b>we do not say that</b> since <b>she</b> had already <b>eaten</b> <i>teruma</i> on her husband’s account she continues to do so, <b>as, if you do not say</b> that <b>this</b> argument must be rejected, then it <b>should</b> be permitted for <b>an Israelite woman who married a priest and her husband died</b> without children to continue <b>eating</b> <i>teruma</i> on his account, <b>as she</b> had <b>already eaten</b> <i>teruma</i> because of him during his lifetime. However, such a conclusion is clearly incorrect. This <i>halakha</i> indicates that the fact that she had already eaten <i>teruma</i> is irrelevant.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> holds that the two cases are not comparable, as <b>there,</b> where the husband died, <b>his acquisition</b> of his wife <b>has lapsed,</b> i.e., they are no longer married, and therefore she cannot continue to eat <i>teruma</i> on his account, whereas <b>here,</b> where his genitals were injured, <b>his acquisition has not lapsed.</b> While sexual relations between them are forbidden, their marriage remains intact.",
            "§ It is taught in the mishna: <b>Who is</b> deemed <b>a man with crushed</b> testicles? <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Who is</b> deemed <b>a man with crushed testicles?</b> It is <b>anyone whose testicles have been wounded, even</b> if only <b>one of them.</b> Furthermore, a man is considered to have crushed testicles not only if they have been wounded, but <b>even</b> if they have been <b>punctured, or</b> have <b>decayed</b> as the result of an injury, <b>or are</b> partly <b>deficient</b> for some other reason. <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, said: I heard from the Sages in the vineyard in Yavne</b> that <b>anyone who has only one testicle is nothing other</b> than <b>a eunuch by natural causes, and he is fit.</b>",
            "The Gemara is puzzled by the wording of this last teaching: <b>Can it enter your mind</b> that he is <b>a eunuch by natural causes,</b> i.e., from birth? That designation refers to one who was born without testicles, whereas the reference here is to one who lost a testicle as the result of an injury. <b>Rather,</b> say that <b>he resembles a eunuch by natural causes, and he is fit.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: As for one whose testicles <b>were punctured, is he incapable of having children,</b> so that he should have the status of one whose testicles were crushed? <b>Wasn’t</b> there an incident where <b>a certain man was climbing up a palm tree,</b>"

            "<b>and a thorn [<i>silva</i>]</b> from the tree <b>punctured him in the testicles, and</b> semen <b>resembling a thread of pus issued from him,</b> as the thorn had perforated his testicle, <b>and</b> yet <b>he</b> later <b>had children.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Didn’t Shmuel send</b> this case <b>before Rav, who said to him: Go</b> out and <b>inquire about his children where they come from,</b> as he doubted that this man could father children, and therefore his wife must have committed adultery.",
            "<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: A man wounded with crushed</b> testicles <b>at the hand of Heaven,</b> e.g., from birth or as the result of an illness, <b>is fit</b> to marry a woman who was born Jewish. <b>Rava said: This is</b> the reason <b>that we read</b> in the Torah: <b>“A man wounded</b> with crushed testicles,” <b>and we do not read: The man wounded</b> with crushed testicles. In the Hebrew text, the latter phrase: The man wounded, can be understood to include one whose testicles have always been crushed, whereas “a man wounded” indicates that he was wounded, i.e., his disability is the result of injury.",
            "A similar idea <b>was taught in a <i>baraita</i>. It is stated: “A man wounded [<i>petzua</i>]</b> with crushed testicles [<i>dakka</i>] or a severed [<i>kerut</i>] penis <b>shall not enter</b> into the congregation of the Lord” (Deuteronomy 23:2), <b>and it is stated</b> in the very next verse: <b>“A <i>mamzer</i> shall not enter</b> into the congregation of the Lord” (Deuteronomy 23:3). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to a <i>mamzer</i>, his blemish was created <b>at the hands of man,</b> i.e., by his parents who sinned, <b>so too, here,</b> with regard to one with crushed testicles, the verse must be speaking about one whose mutilation was <b>at the hands of man.</b>",
            "<b>Rava said:</b> The verse dealing with injured genitals speaks of three types of injury: Wounded [<i>petzua</i>], crushed [<i>dakka</i>], and severed [<i>kerut</i>]. <b>Wounded</b> applies <b>to all of them; crushed</b> applies <b>to all of them;</b> and <b>severed</b> applies <b>to all of them,</b> as will immediately be explained. <b>Wounded</b> applies <b>to all of them, whether the member was wounded, or the testicles were wounded, or the spermatic cords were wounded.</b> Similarly, <b>crushed</b> applies <b>to all of them, whether the member was crushed, or the testicles were crushed, or the spermatic cords were crushed.</b> And <b>severed</b> also applies <b>to all of them, whether the member was severed, or the testicles were severed, or the spermatic cords were severed.</b>",
            "§ <b>One of the Sages said to Rava: From where</b> is it derived <b>that this</b> phrase <b>“<i>petzua dakka</i>,”</b> literally meaning wounded by crushing, is referring to a man who suffered an injury <b>in that place,</b> i.e., his genitals? <b>Say</b> that perhaps it is referring to one who was injured <b>on his head.</b> Rava <b>said to him: From</b> the fact that the verse <b>does not mention</b> the number of <b>generations</b> of his descendants that may not enter into the congregation, as do the verses with regard to a <i>mamzer</i> or an Ammonite or Moabite, <b>learn from this</b> that it is referring to a man who suffered an injury <b>in that place.</b> The blemish is evidently one that prevents him from having children, and therefore he has no generations of descendants.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps</b> the fact <b>that</b> the Torah <b>does not mention</b> the number of <b>generations</b> of his descendants that may not enter into the congregation is due to a halakhic reason rather than a biological one, i.e. <b>that</b> only <b>he is prohibited</b> from entering into the congregation, whereas <b>his son and his son’s son are fit</b> to do so?",
            "The Gemara explains that the identity of a <i>petzua dakka</i> is derived in a different way: The case of a <i>petzua dakka</i> is <b>similar to</b> that of <b>one whose penis has been severed,</b> mentioned immediately afterward: <b>Just as one whose penis has been severed</b> suffered an injury <b>in that place, so too, this</b> man was injured <b>in that place.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: As for the <b>one whose penis has been severed [<i>kerut shofkha</i>] himself, from where</b> is it derived that the phrase <i>kerut shofkha</i>, literally meaning severed emission, is referring to a man who suffered an injury <b>in that place,</b> i.e., his genitals? <b>Say</b> that perhaps it is referring to one who was injured <b>to his lips,</b> from where spittle is discharged. The Gemara answers: <b>It is written “<i>shofkha</i>,”</b> which indicates that the injury was <b>in a place that pours out [<i>shofekh</i>],</b> whereas spittle is spat out.",
            "The Gemara asks further: <b>But say</b> that perhaps it is referring to one who suffered an injury <b>to his nose.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Is it written <i>bishpokh</i>,</b> which would indicate a place from which there is a discharge even if nothing was severed? Rather, <b>it is written “<i>kerut shofkha</i>,”</b> implying <b>something that pours out as a result of</b> an organ <b>having been severed.

            "§ The Gemara considers the following case: If a man’s member <b>was punctured</b> from one side <b>below the corona,</b> i.e., at the corona itself, and the puncture ended <b>on the opposite</b> side <b>above the corona</b> which is nearer the body, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba thought to render him fit</b> for marriage on the grounds that on one side the puncture was below the corona. <b>Rabbi Asi said to him: This is what Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> A puncture in <b>the corona of any size impedes</b> the man’s fitness, even if one end of the puncture is below the corona, as any puncture in the corona affects his fertility.",
            "It is taught in the mishna that <b>if there remains</b> a portion <b>of the corona,</b> even as much as a hairsbreadth, he is still fit. <b>Ravina sat and raised the</b> following <b>dilemma:</b> This <b>hairsbreadth of which they spoke,</b> must it surround <b>the entire</b> member <b>or</b> only <b>a majority of it?

            "<b>Rav Huna said:</b> If a man’s member was cut <b>like a quill [<i>kulmus</i>],</b> which is sharp on all sides, he is <b>fit;</b> but if it was cut <b>like a gutter,</b> which is partly open, he is <b>unfit.</b> He explains: In <b>this</b> case, where it was cut like a gutter, he is unfit because <b>the air penetrates</b> and this interferes with the proper flow of his semen; <b>whereas</b> in <b>that</b> case, where it was cut like a quill, he remains fit because <b>the air does not penetrate</b> and the semen is unaffected. <b>And Rav Ḥisda said</b> the reverse: If a man’s member was cut <b>like a gutter,</b> he is <b>fit;</b> but if it was cut <b>like a quill,</b> he is <b>unfit.</b> This is because in <b>this</b> case, where it was cut like a gutter, the member <b>rubs</b> against the woman’s sexual organ and becomes aroused, <b>whereas</b> in <b>that</b> case, where it was cut like a quill, it <b>does not rub</b> against it, as it is too thin and insubstantial.",
            "<b>Rava said: It stands to reason in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna,</b> that in <b>this</b> case <b>the air penetrates, whereas</b> in <b>that</b> case <b>the air does not penetrate.

Here, too, sufficient contact and friction can be created by the upper end of the man’s member.",
            "<b>Ravina said to Mareimar</b> that <b>Mar Zutra said in the name of Rav Pappa as follows: The <i>halakha</i> is</b> that <b>whether</b> the man’s member was cut <b>like a quill or like a gutter,</b> he is <b>fit.

The Gemara answers: It <b>is obvious</b> that this is referring <b>to</b> a cut <b>above the corona, as, if it enters your mind</b> that it is referring <b>to below the corona,</b> i.e., on the corona itself, this would be difficult because <b>even</b> if the end of <b>the member was</b> completely <b>severed,</b> he would <b>also</b> be fit, provided that a hairsbreadth of the corona remained.

            "<b>Rava said:</b> This is no proof, as <b>is that to say</b> that the prohibition <b>there</b> against marrying Canaanites <b>is due to sanctity or lack of sanctity?</b> Rather, the reason for the prohibition is that <b>perhaps one will father a child</b> from his Canaanite wife <b>and</b> that child <b>will</b> later <b>go</b> off and engage in <b>idolatrous worship.

            "The Gemara is still puzzled by this verse: <b>And did</b> Saul <b>not recognize</b> David’s <b>father?

            "Doeg retorted: If so, say that it is prohibited for only <b>an Egyptian</b> man to enter into the congregation, <b>but not an Egyptian woman.</b> Abner answered: <b>Here it is different, as the reason for</b> the prohibition recorded in this <b>verse</b> with regard to Ammonites <b>is explicit: “Because they did not meet you with bread and with water</b> on the way, when you came forth out of Egypt” (Deuteronomy 23:5).

Rather, it is put into isolation and caused to die, as it has been sanctified as a sin-offering through its mother but cannot be sacrificed on the altar and used to gain atonement.

In the <b>first year</b> David <b>said to</b> the Jewish people: <b>Perhaps there are idol worshippers among you,</b> this being a sin that can lead to drought, <b>as it is written:</b> “Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and you turn aside, <b>and serve other gods, and worship them;</b> and the anger of the Lord be kindled against you, <b>and He shut up the heaven, so that there shall be no rain,</b> and the ground shall not yield her fruit” (Deuteronomy 11:16–17). <b>They examined</b> the matter <b>but did not find</b> sinners of this kind.",

Again <b>they examined</b> the matter, <b>but did not find</b> sinners of this kind either.",
            "In the <b>third</b> year <b>he said to them: Perhaps there are among you those who pledge</b> money <b>to charity in public, but do not</b> actually <b>give</b> any charity. <b>As it is written: “As vapors and wind without rain, so is he that boasts himself of a false gift”</b> (Proverbs 25:14), teaching that one who falsely boasts of making a gift prevents the rain from falling. Once again <b>they examined</b> the matter, <b>but could not find</b> such sinners.",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> may it <b>be inferred</b> that David’s seeking was by way of the <i>Urim VeTummim</i>? <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> This is <b>derived</b> by way of a verbal analogy between the word <b>“presence” used</b> here and the word <b>“presence”</b> used elsewhere. <b>It is written here: “And David sought the presence of the Lord,” and it is written there:</b> “And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, <b>who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the <i>Urim</i> in the presence of the Lord”</b> (Numbers 27:21).

            "The Gemara raises a question with regard to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion: <b>And</b> does <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan maintain that <i>teruma</i> in the present</b> applies <b>by Torah</b> law? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There were <b>two</b> large <b>baskets, one</b> filled with <b>non-sacred</b> produce <b>and</b> the other <b>one</b> filled with <b><i>teruma</i>, and before them</b> were <b>two</b> one-<b><i>se’a</i></b> vessels, <b>one</b> filled with <b>non-sacred</b> produce <b>and</b> the other <b>one</b> filled with <b><i>teruma</i>.

Nevertheless, the produce found in the basket containing the non-sacred produce <b>is permitted, as I say</b> that <b>the <i>teruma</i> fell into the <i>teruma</i> and the non-sacred</b> produce <b>fell into the non-sacred</b> produce.",

These two expressions of inheritance teach that <b>they had a first inheritance</b> of Eretz Yisrael in the days of Joshua <b>and a second</b> inheritance at the time of the return from the Babylonian exile.

But if twenty <i>se’a</i> are removed, so that fit water no longer constitutes the majority, the ritual bath is no longer fit for use. Since certain liquids are unfit for a ritual bath only by rabbinic law, this shows that even with respect to rabbinic prohibitions the permitted portion of a mixture must be greater in quantity, so that it can nullify the prohibited part. The Gemara refutes this proof: <b>No,</b> it means <b>that its greater part must not be removed,</b> but if the water and other liquids are present in equal proportion, the ritual bath remains fit.",

            "<b>Ravin bar Naḥman raised an objection</b> against Rav’s ruling from the following <i>baraita</i>: The verse states about priests: <b>“They may not take</b> a woman who is a harlot [<i>zona</i>], or profaned [<i>ḥalala</i>]” (Leviticus 21:7). The same verse says: <b>“They</b> also <b>may not take</b> a woman divorced from her husband.” This repetition of “they may not take” <b>teaches</b> us <b>that the woman is</b> also <b>prohibited by means of</b> the prohibition addressed to <b>the man.</b> Therefore, we can conclude that there is a prohibition for a daughter of a priest to marry a <i>ḥalal</i>.",
            "<b>Rava said:</b> Ravin bar Naḥman’s objection is not valid.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> it was derived only <b>from that</b> verse, <b>I would say</b> that this principle is true of <b>a prohibition that is equally</b> applicable <b>to all, but</b> with regard to <b>a prohibition that is not equally</b> applicable <b>to all,</b> such as the prohibitions pertaining to priests, this is <b>not</b> the case.

            "However, this proof can be refuted: <b>No, what I</b> should say is that the Torah <b>made a fetus like</b> a child who was <b>born with regard to levirate marriage, because</b> with regard to levirate marriage the Torah <b>made the dead like the living:</b> If the woman had a child at the time of her husband’s death she is entirely exempt from levirate marriage, even if her son subsequently died.

If so, they would certainly not obligate him to bring an offering due to the testimony of a lone witness. <b>Rather, is it not because he</b> remained <b>silent, and silence is considered like an admission?</b> If this is the reason why he brings an offering, there is no proof from here that the testimony of one witness is accepted.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> this <b>is</b> evidently based on <b>logical reasoning: Just as it is in</b> the case of <b>a piece</b> of meat about which it is <b>uncertain</b> if it is <b>forbidden fat</b> and <b>uncertain</b> if it is <b>of</b> permitted <b>fat,</b> and there is no way of clarifying which it is, <b>and one witness comes and says: It is clear to me that it is</b> permitted <b>fat,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that he is deemed credible.</b> Here too, the testimony of a single witness can resolve the uncertainty.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Is it comparable? There, the presumption of a prohibition has not</b> been established, as there is no proof that the piece was ever forbidden, and one can therefore rely on the witness who permits it, whereas <b>here, the presumption of</b> the <b>prohibition</b> with regard <b>to a married woman is</b> established, <b>and</b> there is a principle that <b>nothing involving</b> those <b>with whom relations are forbidden</b> can be determined by <b>fewer than two</b> witnesses.",
            "In fact, <b>this is comparable only to</b> a case involving <b>a piece</b> of meat <b>that</b> is <b>definitely</b> forbidden <b>fat, and one witness comes and says: It is clear to me that it is</b> permitted <b>fat,</b> as the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that he is not deemed credible.</b> The Gemara refutes this claim: <b>Is it comparable?

Such vows are called by the generic term: <i>Konamot</i>.",
            "The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>this</b> case of <b>untithed produce, what are the circumstances? If</b> it <b>is his,</b> and he testifies that <i>terumot</i> and tithes have been separated from it, he should be deemed credible <b>because it is within his power to prepare</b> the produce for consumption by separating tithes whenever he wishes. <b>Rather,</b> you must say that he testifies with regard to untithed produce <b>of another,</b> but if so, <b>what does</b> the anonymous Sage who cited this example <b>hold</b> in this case?",
            "The Gemara elaborates: <b>If</b> he <b>holds</b> that <b>one who separates</b> tithes <b>from his</b> produce <b>for</b> that <b>of another does not require the owner’s knowledge,</b> and he can prepare his friend’s produce for consumption whenever he chooses, in this case too his testimony is deemed credible <b>because it is within his power to prepare it. And if he holds</b> that <b>the owner’s knowledge is required</b> before someone else can separate the gifts, and this is referring to a situation where the witness comes <b>and says: I know with regard to it that it is prepared,</b> in that case, <b>it itself,</b> this very <i>halakha</i>, <b>from where do we</b> derive it? Why is the case of untithed produce more obvious than the testimony with regard to a missing husband?",
            "Similarly, with regard to <b>consecrated</b> property <b>too,</b> if it is merely <b>sanctity</b> that inheres in its <b>value,</b> i.e., it is not an actual offering but an item that has been dedicated to the Temple upkeep, then the reason why the testimony of one witness who says it is not consecrated is accepted is <b>due to</b> the fact that <b>it is within his power to redeem it.</b> And <b>if</b> this is referring to <b>inherent sanctity,</b> the matter still remains to be clarified: <b>If</b> it is <b>his</b> offering, then the reason is <b>due to</b> the fact that <b>it is within his power to request</b> from a Sage <b>that</b> the vow be dissolved, like any other vow. <b>Rather,</b> you must say that it is referring to the offering <b>of another, and he said: I know with regard to it that its owner requested</b> from a Sage <b>that</b> his vow be dissolved.

            "<b>Rather,</b> you will say that the <i>konam</i> must belong <b>to another, and he said: I know with regard to it that its owner requested</b> from a Sage <b>that</b> his vow be dissolved. However, with regard to this <i>halakha</i> <b>itself,</b> that one witness is deemed credible in this case, <b>from where do we</b> derive it? Consequently, after the Gemara has refuted these attempts to explain why one witness should be deemed credible, the question remains: Why is the testimony of a single witness accepted in the case of a missing husband?",
            "<b>Rabbi Zeira said: Due to the stringency that you were stringent with her,</b> the woman who married on the basis of a single witness, <b>at the end,</b> i.e., if it turns out that the testimony was incorrect and the husband is still alive, the <i>halakha</i> is very severe with her and she loses out in all regards, <b>you are lenient with her at the beginning,</b> by accepting the testimony of a single witness to enable the woman to marry. The Gemara suggests: If so, let us <b>not be stringent</b> at the end <b>and not be lenient</b> at the beginning.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Due to</b> the case of <b>a deserted wife, the Sages were lenient with her.</b> Since it is not always easy to find two witnesses to attest to a husband’s death, the Sages realized that if the testimony of one witness were not accepted, the woman would be likely to remain a deserted wife, unable to remarry. However, to prevent this leniency from causing mistakes and licentiousness, they were very stringent with her in a case where the testimony is found to be erroneous, to ensure that she is very careful not to accept untrustworthy accounts.",
            "§ The mishna teaches that if she was informed that her husband was dead and she married another man, and her husband later returned, <b>she must leave this one and this one. Rav said: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only if she married by</b> virtue of the testimony of <b>one witness, but</b> if <b>she married on the basis of</b> the testimony of <b>two witnesses, she does not</b> have to <b>leave</b> him. <b>They laughed at him in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael: <b>The man,</b> the first husband, <b>has come and stands</b> before us, <b>and</b> yet <b>you say she does not</b> have to <b>leave</b> her second husband. The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> in a situation <b>when we do not know</b> the man who comes before us claiming to be the first husband.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If we do not know him,</b> even if she married <b>by one witness, why</b> should she <b>leave?</b> The testimony of the witness who says the husband is dead should be accepted. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for a case <b>when two</b> others <b>came and said: We were with him from when he left until now, and it is you who do not recognize him,</b> as his appearance has changed over the course of time. This is <b>as it is written: “And Joseph recognized his brothers but they did not recognize him”</b> (Genesis 42:8), <b>and Rav Ḥisda said</b> that this verse <b>teaches that</b> Joseph <b>left</b> his brothers <b>without a full beard, and he came with a full beard,</b> which is why they failed to recognize him. This shows that one’s appearance can change so much over time that even his own family members are unable to identify him.",
            "The Gemara asks: Even in this case, <b>ultimately they are two</b> against <b>two.</b> Initially, two witnesses testified that the man was dead, and now another pair arrives saying he is alive.

            "<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> between this ruling involving <b>an unwitting</b> sinner and another <i>halakha</i> <b>of an unwitting</b> sinner: <b>Here, it is taught</b> that if the one who separated ritually impure produce instead of ritually pure produce was <b>unwitting, his <i>teruma</i> is <i>teruma</i>,</b> which indicates that he does not have to separate <i>teruma</i> again. However, <b>there,</b> with regard to rotten fruit, <b>it is taught</b> that it is <b><i>teruma</i> and</b> yet he must <b>separate</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>again.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>There,</b> his was <b>an unwitting</b> act that is <b>close to an intentional</b> one, <b>as he should have tasted it</b> first to ensure that he was separating quality fruit. His failure to do so renders him virtually a willful sinner, and therefore the Sages penalized him by obligating him to set aside <i>teruma</i> again. In the case of impure <i>teruma</i>, in contrast, he may not have been able to investigate the matter when he separated the portion.",
            "<b>And</b> the Gemara also <b>raises a contradiction</b> between one case involving <b>an intentional</b> sinner and another case <b>of an intentional</b> sinner. <b>Here, it</b> is <b>taught</b> that in the case of <b>an intentional</b> sinner who separates <i>teruma</i>, <b>he has done nothing. There, we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 5:10), that with regard to <b>one who separates</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>from</b> produce growing in a vessel <b>that is not perforated, for</b> produce that grew in <b>a perforated</b> vessel, which is considered connected to the ground, it is <b><i>teruma</i>, but he must go back and separate</b> <i>teruma</i> a second time. This ruling is based on the principle that anything that grew in a pot without a hole does not require separation of <i>teruma</i> by Torah law. In this case, the fact that he must again set aside <i>teruma</i> does not mean that the portion he separated is not consecrated at all.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>In</b> a case involving <b>two vessels he will listen.</b> Since the difference between the two vessels is clear to the eye, if the owner is told he must separate <i>teruma</i> again, it can be assumed that he will comply. In contrast, <b>in</b> the case of <b>one vessel he will not listen,</b> as ritually impure and pure produce look the same to him. Consequently, if he is informed that he must set aside <i>teruma</i> a second time despite the fact that the produce he already set aside has the status of <i>teruma</i>, he will take no notice.",
            "The Gemara asks another question: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Natan, son of Rabbi Oshaya, who said</b> that <b>he has done nothing</b> with regard to <b>preparing the remaining</b> produce <b>but it is</b> nevertheless <b><i>teruma</i>,</b>"
        ],
        [
            "in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 5:10): If one separates <i>teruma</i> <b>from</b> that which grew in <b>a perforated</b> pot <b>for that which is</b> from <b>a non-perforated</b> pot, <b>his <i>teruma</i> is <i>teruma</i>, but it may not be eaten until he removes</b> on behalf <b>of</b> that portion itself <b><i>teruma</i> and tithe from another place?</b> In other words, the portion he separated as <i>teruma</i> is not entirely consecrated, as it too is considered untithed produce in the sense that <i>teruma</i> must be separated for it. In contrast, one who sets aside impure <i>teruma</i> does not have to separate <i>teruma</i> from that portion itself.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Here,</b> with regard to ritually impure <i>teruma</i>, <b>it is different, as by Torah</b> law <b>it is</b> in fact <b>full-fledged <i>teruma</i>,</b> but the Sages penalized him by making him separate <i>teruma</i> again. This is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elai, as Rabbi Elai said: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to one who separates <i>teruma</i> from poor-</b>quality produce <b>for superior</b>-quality produce <b>that his <i>teruma</i> is <i>teruma</i>? As it is written</b> with regard to <i>teruma</i>: <b>“And you shall bear no sin by reason of it, seeing that you have set apart from it its best”</b> (Numbers 18:32). This verse states that if one separated <i>teruma</i> from inferior-quality produce he has committed a sin, which shows that his action is effective, as Rabbi Elai proceeds to explain.",
            "Rabbi Elai elaborates: <b>And if</b> this inferior portion is <b>not sanctified</b> as <i>teruma</i> at all, <b>why</b> is there <b>a bearing of sin?</b> If the produce does not have the status of <i>teruma</i> he has not done anything, which means that his action cannot be considered a transgression. <b>From here</b> we learn <b>with regard to one who separated from the bad for the good that his <i>teruma</i> is <i>teruma</i></b> after the fact. Similarly, the <i>teruma</i> of one who separates ritually impure food for pure food is valid <i>teruma</i> by Torah law.",
            "After clarifying the opinions themselves, the Gemara analyzes the case in greater detail. <b>Rabba said to Rav Ḥisda: According to your</b> opinion, <b>that you said he has done nothing at all,</b> meaning <b>that even that <i>se’a</i></b> he set aside <b>returns to</b> its former <b>untithed</b> state, <b>what is the reason</b> for this? It is a rabbinic <b>decree,</b> as <b>perhaps he will be negligent and will not separate</b> <i>teruma</i> a second time. However, <b>is there anything that by Torah</b> law <b>is <i>teruma</i>,</b> as stated by Rabbi Elai, <b>and</b> yet <b>due to</b> the concern: <b>Perhaps he will be negligent, the Sages removed</b> its status as sacred and gave <b>to</b> it the status of <b>non-sacred</b> food? <b>And can the court stipulate</b> and enact a decree <b>to uproot something</b> that applies <b>by Torah</b> law?",
            "Rav Ḥisda <b>said to</b> Rabba: <b>And you, do you not hold</b> that the Sages have the power to do so? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that <b>the child is a <i>mamzer</i> from this one and from that one? Granted,</b> the child <b>from the second</b> man is <b>a <i>mamzer</i>,</b> as he was born to a married woman from a man who was not her husband. <b>However,</b> with regard to the child <b>from the first</b> husband, <b>why</b> is he a <i>mamzer</i>? After all, <b>she is his wife, and</b> by Torah law their son <b>is a full-fledged Jew. And</b> the Sages’ declaration that he is a <i>mamzer</i> cannot be seen as a mere stringency, as <b>they</b> thereby <b>permit him to a <i>mamzeret</i>.</b> This shows that a rabbinical decree can uproot a Torah prohibition.",
            "Rabba <b>said to</b> Rav Ḥisda that <b>Shmuel said as follows:</b> It is <b>forbidden</b> for the child of the first husband <b>to</b> marry <b>a <i>mamzeret</i>.

            "<b>Rav Ḥisda sent</b> a proof <b>to Rabba, in the hand</b> of <b>Rav Aḥa bar Rav Huna: And can the court not stipulate to uproot something prohibited by Torah</b> law? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From when does a man inherit</b> from <b>his minor wife,</b> who was married off by her mother or brother, as enacted by the Sages, a marriage that is not valid by Torah law? <b>Beit Shammai say: From when she stands at her</b> fully developed <b>height,</b> i.e., when she grows up and reaches the age of maturity. <b>And Beit Hillel say: From when she enters the wedding canopy.

            "The Gemara first clarifies various details of this <i>baraita</i>. <b>Beit Shammai say: From when she stands at her height.</b> The Gemara expresses surprise at this statement: Is this the case <b>even though she has not</b> yet <b>entered the wedding canopy?</b> Betrothal alone, without the marriage canopy, is not enough to enable a man to inherit from an adult woman, let alone a minor. The Gemara answers: You must <b>say</b> that Beit Shammai meant <b>from when she stands at her</b> fully developed <b>height and enters the wedding canopy. And Beit Shammai said to Beit Hillel as follows: That which you said,</b> that he inherits her <b>from when she enters the wedding canopy,</b> is not enough. Rather, <b>if she stands at her</b> fully developed <b>height,</b> the <b>wedding canopy is effective for</b> bringing about <b>her</b> marriage, <b>and if not,</b> the <b>wedding canopy is not effective for</b> bringing about <b>her</b> marriage.",
            "The Gemara continues its analysis of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: From when she has sexual relations.</b> The Gemara again expresses surprise: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Eliezer say</b> that <b>the actions of a minor girl are nothing,</b> which indicates that marriage and intercourse with her are not considered an act of acquisition. Rather, we must <b>say</b> that he meant <b>from when she matures and has sexual relations.</b>",
            "The Gemara returns to the issue at hand, whether the court can stipulate to uproot something prohibited by Torah law. <b>In any event</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is teaching</b> that <b>he inherits</b> from <b>her. But here</b> is a case <b>where by Torah</b> law <b>her father,</b> i.e., his relatives, as he is dead, <b>inherits</b> from <b>her,</b> as a minor orphan cannot marry by Torah law, <b>and</b> yet <b>by rabbinic</b> law the <b>husband inherits</b> from <b>her.</b> This shows that the Sages can uproot a Torah mitzva. The Gemara answers: This is no proof, as in monetary matters <b>property declared ownerless by the court is ownerless,</b> and therefore the court can allocate her inheritance as they see fit.",
            "<b>As Rabbi Yitzḥak said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that property declared ownerless by the court is ownerless? As it is stated: “And whoever does not come within three days, according to the council of the princes and the Elders, all his property should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of the captivity”</b> (Ezra 10:8). This verse indicates that the court can confiscate anyone’s possessions.",
            "<b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that the proof that the court can declare property ownerless is <b>from here: “These are the inheritances that Elazar the priest, and Joshua, son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers’ houses of the tribes of the children of Israel distributed for inheritance”</b> (Joshua 19:51). <b>What do heads have to do with fathers?</b> The expression “the heads of the fathers’ houses of the tribes” is unusual and vague. <b>Rather,</b> this comes <b>to tell you: Just as fathers bequeath to their sons anything they want</b> to, <b>so too,</b> the <b>heads,</b> i.e., the leaders and judges of the people, <b>bequeath to the people anything they want</b> to. This shows that the leaders can take property from one individual and give it to another.",
            "It was stated that the husband of a minor <b>becomes impure for her,</b> even if he is a priest. The Gemara asks: <b>But here</b> is a case <b>where by Torah</b> law <b>her father,</b> not the man she married, is obligated to <b>become impure for her,</b> as the latter is not his wife by Torah law, <b>and</b> yet <b>by rabbinic</b> law her <b>husband defiles himself for her.</b> The Gemara answers: This is <b>because she is</b> considered like <b>a corpse with no one to bury it [<i>met mitzva</i>],</b> for which even a priest must become impure. Once she is married, her relatives from her father’s family no longer care for her welfare, which means her husband is the only one who is entrusted with her burial.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And is she</b> in fact <b>a <i>met mitzva</i>? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Which</b> corpse <b>is a <i>met mitzva</i>?

        [
            "It was further taught: <b>And she eats <i>teruma</i> on his account.</b> The Gemara explains: This is referring to <b><i>teruma</i></b> that applies <b>by rabbinic</b> law, not by Torah law. The Gemara attempts to offer a proof for this claim. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: If a non-priest <b>ate ritually impure <i>teruma</i></b> of a priest, he must <b>pay</b> him with <b>ritually pure, non-sacred</b> produce.

            "The Gemara returns to the issue at hand, whether the court can stipulate to uproot something prohibited by Torah law. <b>And here</b> it is a case <b>where by Torah</b> law the produce he gave him <b>is proper payment,</b> and is fully owned by the priest, to the extent <b>that if a priest betroths a woman with them,</b> the <b>betrothal with her is valid.

Evidently, a rabbinical prohibition overrides a betrothal that is effective by Torah law.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>His payment is not payment, that Rabbi Meir said?</b> It means <b>that he is required to go back and pay</b> with <b>ritually pure, non-sacred</b> produce.

According to Sumakhos, if he unwittingly paid with impure, non-sacred produce his payment is valid and the Sages did not penalize him with a second payment, whereas the Rabbis maintain that even if his sin was accidental he must repay the priest, as the Sages issue the decree in a case of a mistaken transgression due to the case of one who sinned intentionally.",
            "The Gemara further suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof.

            "<b>And here</b> it is a case <b>where by Torah</b> law the blood <b>effects acceptance, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>For what does the</b> High Priest’s <b>frontplate effect acceptance?

The Gemara infers: Since he is not obligated to bring this extra offering by Torah law, in essence he <b>subsequently brings in a non-sacred</b> animal <b>to</b> the Temple <b>courtyard.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said</b> that there is no proof from here, as <b>what is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>Does not effect acceptance, that</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>said?</b> It means that it does not effect acceptance <b>in</b> the sense that it <b>permits</b> the meat of the offering <b>to be eaten. However, the owners</b> themselves <b>attain atonement through it,</b> and they do not have to bring another offering.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Ultimately,</b> the Torah mitzva of <b>eating</b> the <b>meat</b> of this offering <b>is uprooted, and it is written: “And they shall eat those things with which atonement was made”</b> (Exodus 29:33). This verse <b>teaches that the priests eat</b> the offering <b>and</b> the <b>owner</b> thereby <b>gains atonement. He said to him:</b> The case of <b>sit and refrain from action [<i>shev ve’al ta’aseh</i>] is different.</b> In other words, the Sages can uproot a Torah mitzva by instructing one to sit and <b>refrain from action,</b> i.e., to remain passive and do nothing. They cannot, however, uproot a mitzva by telling him to perform an action."

        [
            "Rav Ḥisda <b>said to</b> Rabba: <b>I wanted to raise a difficulty against you</b> from the <i>halakha</i> of <b>an uncircumcised man.</b> The Sages decreed that one who converts on the eve of Passover may not partake of the Paschal lamb, due to his ritual impurity. According to Beit Hillel, one who separates from the foreskin by being circumcised is ritually impure like one who separates from the grave (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 92a). This is the <i>halakha</i> despite the fact that by Torah law he is obligated to bring the offering. Rav Ḥisda continued: And I also thought of asking from the case of <b>sprinkling</b> the waters of a purification offering for one who became ritually impure through contact with a corpse, as the Sages rendered it prohibited for one who is impure to receive the sprinkling on the eve of Passover that occurred on Shabbat, although this prevents him from partaking of the Paschal lamb.",
            "<b>And</b> I was likewise going to raise a question from the case of a circumcision <b>knife,</b> which the Sages decreed may not be carried on Shabbat, despite the fact that this entails the neglect of a Torah mitzva. <b>And</b> I also wanted to raise a question from the case of a linen <b>cloak, on</b> which the Sages did not allow one to place <b>ritual fringes</b> made of wool. This is a decree that was issued lest he do the same with a garment worn only at night, which is exempt from fringes, and therefore this would be a mixture of wool and linen that is forbidden, although this means that he is unable to fulfill the mitzva of ritual fringes.",
            "<b>And</b> likewise I wanted to mention a difficulty from the case of <b>the lambs sacrificed on <i>Shavuot</i>.</b> When the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> occurs on Shabbat, the Sages rendered it prohibited to sprinkle the blood of its sacrificial lambs if the offerings had not been slaughtered with the proper intention, despite the fact that the sprinkling itself is not prohibited by Torah law. <b>And</b> similarly, there is a difficulty with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of the <b><i>shofar</i>,</b> which is sounded on Rosh HaShana, and yet the Sages rendered it prohibited for it to be blown on Shabbat, lest one carry it four cubits in the public domain.",
            "<b>And</b> finally I wished to raise a difficulty from the case of <b>a <i>lulav</i>,</b> which may not be carried on the first day of <i>Sukkot</i> that occurred on Shabbat, for the same reason the Sages rendered it prohibited to sound the <i>shofar</i> on Rosh HaShana that occurs on Shabbat. However, <b>now that you have resolved for us</b> that an action defined as a case of: <b>Sit and refrain from action, is not</b> considered <b>uprooting, all these are also</b> cases of <b>sit and refrain from action.</b>",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof. The verse states with regard to a true prophet: <b>“To him you shall listen”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:15). From here it is derived that <b>even</b> if the prophet <b>says to you: Transgress one of the mitzvot of the Torah, for example,</b> as in the case of <b>Elijah at Mount Carmel,</b> who brought an offering to God on that mountain during a period when it was forbidden on pain of <i>karet</i> to sacrifice offerings outside the Temple, with regard to <b>everything</b> that he permits <b>for</b> the requirement of the <b>hour,</b> you must <b>listen to him.</b> This indicates that a Torah mitzva can indeed be uprooted in an active manner.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>There it is different, as it is written: “To him you shall listen,”</b> which means that it is a positive mitzva to obey a prophet, and a positive mitzva overrides a prohibition. The Gemara asks: <b>And let him derive from</b> this case a principle that the Sages have the same power as a prophet. The Gemara answers: <b>Safeguarding a matter is different.</b> Since Elijah acted with the aim of preventing the Jewish people from worshipping idols, it was temporarily permitted for him to override a mitzva, in order to strengthen Torah observance with regard to a particular matter in which the people are lax.",
            "The Gemara suggests another proof. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear:</b> The Sages rendered it prohibited for a man who has sent a bill of divorce to his wife to cancel it in the presence of a court without her knowledge after he has given the bill of divorce to his messenger but before she gets the document. The prohibition was instituted to prevent a situation where the messenger, who is unaware of the cancellation, gives her the bill of divorce and she marries another man under the mistaken impression that she is divorced. If he proceeded to <b>nullify it</b> regardless, it is <b>nullified;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: He cannot nullify or add to its condition</b> in a case where the bill of divorce included a stipulation. For <b>if so,</b> i.e., if he has the ability to cancel the bill of divorce, <b>what good is the power of the court</b> in their decree that one may not do so?",
            "The Gemara explains the proof from this source: <b>And here</b> it is a case <b>where by Torah</b> law, the <b>bill of divorce is nullified, and</b> yet <b>due to</b> the reason of: <b>What</b> good <b>is the power of the court,</b> his nullification is ineffective, which means that <b>we permit a married woman to all</b> men. The Gemara answers: The <i>halakhot</i> of marriage afford no proof, as with regard to <b>one who betroths</b> a woman, he <b>betroths on the authorization of the Sages, and</b> in this case <b>the Sages nullified the betrothal,</b> which they can do because their consent was required for the betrothal to be effective in the first place.",
            "<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi:</b> This <b>works out well</b> in a case <b>when he betrothed with money,</b> as it can be explained that the Sages declared the money ownerless, thereby negating the betrothal. However, if <b>he betrothed by</b> means of <b>sexual relations, what can be said?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The Sages equated his relations</b> with this woman with <b>licentious sexual intercourse.</b> Since in this situation as well the acquisition of betrothal is effective only by authorization of the Sages, they have the power to declare it invalid.",
            "The Gemara cites yet another relevant source. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear,</b> as <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Ya’akov said: I have heard that</b> the reason why <b>the court may administer lashes and punish not by Torah</b> law, i.e., in response to actions for which one is not liable to receive punishment by Torah law, is <b>not</b> so as <b>to transgress matters of Torah, but to establish a safeguard for the Torah. And</b> an example of this is <b>an incident involving a certain person who rode on a horse on Shabbat in the days of the Greeks,</b> an act that is prohibited by rabbinic law, <b>and they brought him to the court and they stoned him</b> as a desecrator of Shabbat. They did so <b>not because he was deserving of this,</b> as riding a horse is not punishable by stoning by Torah law, <b>but because the hour required it,</b> as at that time Jews were negligent with regard to Shabbat observance.",

This shows that the court can uproot a Torah mitzva even by means of a positive action such as stoning. The Gemara answers: <b>Safeguarding a matter is different.</b> As stated above, the court may uproot a Torah mitzva so as to strengthen Torah observance in general, as was the case with the prophet Elijah.",

However, she might earn more, in which case the vow would apply with regard to the additional amount. To avoid this scenario, it is preferable for the husband to nullify the vow.

            "<b>Rav Mordekhai said to Rav Ashi, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Aḥa</b> who <b>said to Rav Ashi: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a different source (<i>Yevamot</i> 118b): <b>A woman is not deemed credible</b> if she <b>says: My <i>yavam</i> is dead, so that I may marry,</b> i.e., to permit herself to marry another man. <b>And</b> she is <b>not</b> deemed credible if she says: <b>My sister is dead, so that I may enter her house,</b> i.e., to marry her husband. The Gemara infers: It is <b>she herself who is not deemed credible.</b> It may be inferred from this that if <b>one witness</b> issues this report, he is <b>deemed credible.</b>",
            "The Gemara refutes this argument. <b>And according to your reasoning, say the latter clause</b> of that same mishna: <b>A man is not deemed credible</b> if he <b>says: My brother is dead, so that I may enter into levirate marriage with his wife. And</b> he is <b>not</b> deemed credible when he says: <b>My wife is dead, so that I may marry her sister.</b> Following the above reasoning, it is <b>he himself</b> who <b>is not deemed credible,</b> which indicates that <b>one witness is deemed credible.</b> Yet this cannot be correct: <b>Granted, with regard to a woman, due to</b> the concern that she be left <b>a deserted wife, the Sages were lenient in her</b> case, by allowing her to rely on a single witness. <b>However, with regard to a man, what can be said?</b> There is no concern that he will be left deserted, as a man can marry more than one woman, so he certainly cannot marry a woman on the basis of such flimsy testimony.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the case of one witness cannot be decided from the mishna, as <b>when is</b> this <i>halakha</i> that a woman is not deemed credible when she says that her <i>yavam</i> is dead <b>necessary</b> to be stated? It <b>is necessary for</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b> The Gemara explains: It might <b>enter your mind to say: Since Rabbi Akiva said</b> that the offspring born of intercourse <b>for which</b> one <b>is liable</b> for violating <b>a prohibition is a <i>mamzer</i>,</b> which indicates that even the offspring of a <i>yevama</i> who unlawfully wed another man is a <i>mamzer</i>, one might <b>say</b> that <b>she is concerned for the ruin of her offspring and is</b> consequently <b>exacting</b> in her investigation and would marry only if she received clear, unambiguous testimony. The <i>tanna</i> therefore <b>teaches us that</b> she <b>is concerned for her own ruin,</b> e.g., if there is uncertainty as to whether her husband died, which would force her to leave both him and her second husband, but <b>she is not</b> as <b>concerned for the ruin of her offspring,</b> and in this case she is likelier to marry unlawfully.",

The Gemara clarifies: With regard to this <b><i>yevama</i>, with whom</b> did she engage in intercourse? <b>If we say</b> that she had relations <b>with another</b> man, not her <i>yavam</i>, this would mean that the ruling is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Hamnuna.

            "However, this argument can also be challenged: <b>What</b> about the fact <b>that</b> in the case of <b>a <i>yevama</i></b> who engages in this forbidden relationship, <b>the body is defiled and her prohibition</b> applies equally <b>to the majority</b> of the people.

This <b>works out well</b> with regard to the clause that starts with: <b>Whoever disqualifies,</b> as he disqualifies others, i.e., his brother-in-law’s wife to his brother-in-law, and therefore he also disqualifies his wife to himself. However, the continuation of the statement: <b>Whoever does not disqualify, what is its purpose?</b> This clause has no apparent relevance to Rabbi Yosei’s statement.",
            "<b>Rabbi Ami said:</b> Rabbi Yosei’s statement does not refer to this <i>halakha</i>, but <b>to the first</b> mishna of the chapter, which taught that if a woman whose husband went overseas was informed that he was dead and she <b>married by</b> permission of <b>the court she must leave</b> her new husband <b>and is exempt from</b> bringing <b>an offering.</b> If she married <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>witnesses,</b> without the authorization of the court, <b>she must leave and is liable to</b> bring <b>an offering.</b> In this regard, the <b>power of the court is enhanced, as she is exempt from an offering.</b>",
            "Rabbi Ami explains: <b>And</b> accordingly, if his wife and brother-in-law went overseas and witnesses came and testified that they were both dead, <b>the first <i>tanna</i> says</b> that it <b>is no different</b> whether the wife of his brother-in-law married him <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>witnesses</b> alone, in <b>which</b> case the <b>wife of his brother-in-law is permitted</b> to her husband, as she is considered as having acted under duress, having heard testimony that her husband was dead, <b>and</b> it <b>is no different</b> if she married him <b>by</b> permission of <b>the court, as</b> although the <b>wife of his brother-in-law is prohibited,</b> his own wife remains permitted to him.",
            "Rabbi Ami continues his explanation. <b>And Rabbi Yosei says to</b> the first <i>tanna</i>: One who married <b>by</b> permission of <b>the court, who disqualifies others,</b> he also <b>disqualified himself</b> to his own wife; however, in the case of one who married <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>witnesses</b> who <b>does not disqualify others,</b> I agree <b>that he does not disqualify himself,</b> and his wife is permitted to him.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa said: Actually,</b> Rabbi Yosei is referring <b>to the latter clause</b> of the mishna, and the explanation is as follows: <b>This</b> is referring to one <b>who married his brother-in-law’s wife, and that</b> case is referring to one <b>who married his brother-in-law’s betrothed.</b> Alternatively, <b>this</b> involves a situation <b>where his betrothed and his brother-in-law went</b> overseas, whereas <b>that</b> concerns a situation <b>when his wife and his brother-in-law went</b> abroad. <b>And the first <i>tanna</i> said:</b> It <b>is no different</b> whether the ones who left were <b>his wife and his brother-in-law, and</b> it <b>is no different</b> whether they were <b>his betrothed and his brother-in-law.</b> Either way <b>his brother-in-law’s wife is forbidden</b> to her husband <b>and his</b> own <b>wife</b> or betrothed <b>is permitted</b> to him.",
            "Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa continues his interpretation. <b>And Rabbi Yosei said to</b> the first <i>tanna</i>: If <b>his wife and his brother-in-law</b> left, in <b>which</b> case <b>it cannot be said</b> that <b>he had a condition with regard to his marriage</b> to his wife, i.e., that the finalization of the marriage was pending on the fulfillment of some condition, everyone would realize that his marriage to her sister was a mistake and she is therefore permitted to his brother-in-law. Consequently, <b>as he does not disqualify another, he does not disqualify himself</b> either. If, however, it was <b>his betrothed and his brother-in-law</b> who left, <b>when it can be</b> mistakenly <b>said</b> that <b>he had a condition with regard to his betrothal</b> and the condition was unfulfilled, his brother-in-law’s wife is therefore prohibited from returning to his brother-in-law. <b>And</b> therefore, as <b>he disqualifies others he also disqualifies himself,</b> and his betrothed is forbidden to him.",
            "§ <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei. Rav Yosef strongly objects to this: And did Shmuel</b> actually <b>say this? But wasn’t it stated</b> that they disputed the status of <b>a <i>yevama</i>: Rav said</b> that <b>she is like a married woman, and Shmuel said</b> that <b>she is not like a married woman.

            "<b>As Rav said</b> that <b>she is like a married woman</b> who married another man based on testimony that her husband was dead <b>and is</b> therefore <b>forbidden to the <i>yavam</i>,</b> i.e., to her first husband, who is called the <i>yavam</i> after his brother married her. <b>And Shmuel said</b> that <b>she is not like a married woman, and is permitted to him.</b> This apparently contradicts Rav Yehuda’s ruling in the name of Shmuel that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, as here too people might mistakenly think that the original betrothal included an unfulfilled condition and she should therefore be forbidden to him as the wife of his brother.",
            "<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>And from where</b> do you know <b>that when Shmuel said</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, he was speaking of</b> the explanation of <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa</b> with regard to Rabbi Yosei’s opinion? <b>Perhaps he was speaking of</b> the explanation of <b>Rabbi Ami,</b> that Rabbi Yosei is referring to the difference between one who married by permission of the court and one who did so based on the testimony of witnesses. <b>And even</b> if one accepts the claim that Shmuel’s ruling endorses the interpretation <b>of Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa, from where</b> do you know that he was referring to the clause: <b>One who disqualifies?</b>"

            "According to this interpretation, the dispute is as follows: <b>As Rav said, she is like a married woman and she is</b> therefore <b>disqualified by licentious sexual relations.

            "The Gemara asks with regard to this last answer: How can the dispute be explained in this manner? <b>But</b> Rav and Shmuel already <b>disagreed over this once.</b> The Sages would certainly not record the same dispute twice. The Gemara answers: It is possible that they did not in fact disagree twice with regard to the same case.

However, since there are not many people there, the concern about their being alone together remains. <b>Alternatively,</b> there is a practical difference in the case of a granary <b>that is distant but is frequented by people.</b> There, there is concern that the owner of the granary might not know if she was divorced, but the concern that they might be alone together does not exist.",

            "The Gemara answers: <b>You find</b> a solution <b>in</b> the case of <b>a mistaken betrothal.</b> For example, if the first husband betrothed her conditionally and the condition was unfulfilled, the marriage is nullified.

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Now that</b> the mishna says that <b>even three laymen</b> are qualified for <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>why do I</b> need it to mention <b>judges?</b> It would be sufficient to say that the mitzva requires three people. The Gemara answers: <b>This teaches us that we require three</b> people <b>who can</b> at least <b>dictate</b> the verses read during the <i>ḥalitza</i> ritual to the participants <b>like judges,</b> as they are not complete laymen in that they are literate. The Gemara comments: <b>We</b> already <b>learned this</b> <i>halakha</i> in a <i>baraita</i>, <b>as the Sages taught: The mitzva of <i>ḥalitza</i> is</b> performed <b>before three</b> individuals <b>who know</b> how <b>to dictate</b> the verses <b>like judges. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> <i>Ḥalitza</i> must be performed <b>before five</b> individuals acting as judges.",
            "The Gemara discusses the dispute as to how many individuals must conduct the <i>ḥalitza</i>: <b>What is the reason of the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> who requires three? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning <i>ḥalitza</i>: “His <i>yevama</i> shall ascend to the gate to the <b>Elders”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:7). Since the minimum number of the plural term “Elders” is <b>two, and</b> since, in order to prevent a paralyzing disagreement between an even number of judges, <b>a court may not</b> be composed of an <b>even</b> number of judges, <b>one more is added to them. Therefore, there are three</b> judges. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda</b> interprets the verse otherwise, for one verse states: “And the <b>Elders of</b> his city shall call him” (Deuteronomy 25:8), indicating a minimum of <b>two</b> judges, and it says in the following verse <b>“Elders”</b> another time, indicating an additional <b>two</b> people, <b>and</b> since <b>a court may not</b> be composed of an <b>even</b> number of judges, <b>one more is added to them. Therefore, there are five</b> judges.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And what does the first <i>tanna</i> do with this</b> second appearance of the word <b>“Elders”?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>He requires it for</b> allowing the <b>inclusion</b> of <b>even three laymen</b> as presiding judges for <i>ḥalitza</i>. The word “Elders” would seem to limit <i>ḥalitza</i> to recognized judges, but since it is mentioned twice, it becomes an instance of the hermeneutic principle that one restrictive expression appearing after another restrictive expression comes to include some additional <i>halakha</i>. Therefore, repeating the restrictive term “Elders” twice actually comes to include laymen rather than exclude them.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>From where does Rabbi Yehuda derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <i>ḥalitza</i> can be done in the presence of <b>laymen?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> what is written: <b>“Before the eyes of</b> the Elders” (Deuteronomy 25:9), <b>for the Master said: “Before the eyes of” excludes blind individuals</b> from being the judges conducting the <i>ḥalitza</i>.",
            "<b>And since it was necessary</b> to say <b>“before the eyes of” to exclude blind individuals</b> from being judges for <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>learn from here</b> that <b>even laymen</b> are qualified to be judges for <i>ḥalitza</i>. <b>For if it enters your mind</b> to say that <b>we require</b> expert judges who are fit to sit on the high court of the <b>Sanhedrin,</b> then <b>why do I</b> need <b>to exclude blind individuals?

            "This is <b>as it is stated: “You are entirely beautiful, my love, and there is no blemish in you”</b> (Song of Songs 4:7). If the Elders conducting <i>ḥalitza</i> needed to be expert judges, there would be no reason to explicitly exclude the blind, as they are unfit to be judges in a regular court. Evidently it is permitted for laymen to be judges for <i>ḥalitza</i>, and only blind individuals are excluded. The Gemara asks: <b>And the other</b> Sage, the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>what does he do with</b> the verse <b>“before the eyes of”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>comes for</b> that which <b>Rava</b> taught, <b>as Rava said: The judges must see the spittle that exits from the mouth of the <i>yevama</i></b> as part of the ceremony of <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>as it is written:</b> “His <i>yevama</i> shall approach him, <b>before the eyes of the Elders,</b> and remove his shoe from on his foot <b>and spit</b> before him and respond and say: So shall it be done to the man who does not build his brother’s house” (Deuteronomy 25:9).",
            "The Gemara asks: If so, <b>the other</b> Sage, Rabbi Yehuda, should <b>also require</b> “before the eyes” <b>to</b> teach <b>Rava’s</b> statement.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the other</b> Sage, the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>what does he do with this</b> phrase: <b>“In Israel”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He requires it for that which was taught by Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda: “In Israel”</b> means <b>in a court of Israelites</b> from birth, <b>and not in a court of converts.</b> The mitzva of <i>ḥalitza</i> must be conducted by judges who can trace their lineage to other Jews from birth, and not converts.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the other</b> Sage, Rabbi Yehuda, from where does he derive this <i>halakha</i>?

            "The Gemara returns to the dispute concerning the number of judges: <b>However, if that is so,</b> that the plural term “Elders” indicates the need for additional judges, there are other plural terms written in the verse that should also indicate the need for additional judges. As the verse states: <b>“And they shall call”;</b> this is referring to <b>two</b> people. <b>“And they shall speak”</b> indicates <b>two</b> more.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>is necessary for him</b> to derive <b>the</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>that is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“They shall call him”</b> means the judges themselves <b>and not their agents. “They shall speak to him” teaches that they give him counsel appropriate for him</b> concerning whether he should perform levirate marriage or <i>ḥalitza</i>.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> with respect to declarations of refusal, there is only <b>one unattributed</b> mishna (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 2a) that states that refusals are performed before three judges, and <b>here,</b> there are <b>two unattributed</b> <i>mishnayot</i> that state that <i>ḥalitza</i> is performed before three judges, both here and also in that same mishna in tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i>. The Gemara challenges the previous claim: <b>There too,</b> with regard to refusals, <b>there are two unattributed</b> <i>mishnayot</i>, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (25b): <b>If she made a declaration of refusal or performed <i>ḥalitza</i> before</b> a judge, this judge <b>may marry her</b> if he wishes to, as there is no suspicion of ulterior motives, <b>because he is a member of a court.</b> This mishna implies that declarations of refusal may take place only before a court.",
            "The Gemara concedes: <b>Rather, there,</b> with regard to refusals, there are only <b>two unattributed</b> statements found in the mishna, <b>and here,</b> with regard to <i>ḥalitza</i>, there are <b>three unattributed</b> statements found in the mishna.

Rather, <b>it is necessary</b> in a case <b>where she tore the outer shoe and took off the inner shoe, and the outer one still remains</b> on his foot although it is torn. The question centers around the previous one with regard to the nature of <i>ḥalitza</i>: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> for valid <i>ḥalitza</i>? Is it <b>removal</b> of the shoe that <b>we require, which we have</b> brought about in this example? <b>Or perhaps</b> it is <b>exposing the foot</b> that <b>we require, which is lacking</b> here, as the foot is still covered by the torn outer shoe."

            "The Gemara analyzes the phrase used in the mishna that discusses the types of shoes that can be used for <i>ḥalitza</i>. It was taught in the mishna that if he was wearing <b>a soft shoe [<i>anpileya</i>]</b> made of cloth for <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>her <i>ḥalitza</i> is invalid.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>That is to say that an <i>anpileya</i> is not</b> considered <b>a shoe.</b>",

In any case, the wording of the mishna indicates that an <i>anpileya</i> is not considered a type of shoe, since it is permitted to enter the Temple wearing an <i>anpileya</i> when there is no reason for suspicion, unlike a shoe or sandal, which can never be worn in the Temple.",
            "<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i> concerning what footwear is permitted on Yom Kippur, which seems to indicate otherwise: The halakha is <b>the same for a</b> soft leather <b>shoe, and a</b> hard leather <b>sandal, and an <i>anpileya</i>, as one may not walk in them from one house to another, nor from one bed to another</b> on Yom Kippur, due to the prohibition against wearing shoes, indicating that at least as far as Yom Kippur is concerned, an <i>anpileya</i> is considered a shoe.",
            "<b>Abaye said:</b> There, with regard to Yom Kippur, it is referring to an <i>anpileya</i> <b>that has cushioning, and</b> this is forbidden <b>due to the pleasure</b> that one derives from cushioned footwear on a day when people are commanded to afflict themselves. <b>Rava said to him: But</b> is footwear <b>that is not considered</b> to be <b>shoes forbidden on Yom Kippur due to</b> the <b>pleasure</b> one derives from wearing them? <b>But Rabba bar Rav Huna would wrap a scarf on his feet and go out</b> on Yom Kippur so his feet would not be injured, implying that there is no prohibition against wearing something comfortable on one’s foot, as long as it is not defined as a shoe. <b>Rather, Rava said: This</b> is <b>not difficult.

And <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> on the other hand, <b>prohibits</b> the amputee from going out on Shabbat with his wooden leg, as he does not consider it a shoe that is being worn, but rather a wooden object that is being carried.",
            "The Gemara asks how Rabbi Meir can be the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i>, as the continuation of the <i>baraita</i> states <i>ḥalitza</i> is disqualified if performed <b>with an <i>anpileya</i></b> made <b>of cloth,</b> as this cloth shoe is not to be considered a shoe.

            "In an attempt to resolve the contradiction <b>Abaye said: Since the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with <b>the Rabbis,</b> who rule like Rabbi Yosei, <b>the first clause is also</b> in accordance with <b>the Rabbis.

            "<b>Rather,</b> the fact that the <i>baraita</i> was not taught in that manner indicates that Abaye’s explanation is incorrect.

The Torah states: “Three <b>Festivals [<i>regalim</i>]</b> you shall celebrate for Me in the year” (Exodus 23:14). The <i>baraita</i> comments on the verse: Festivals are referred to in the verse as <i>regalim</i>, which literally means feet, indicating that one must actually make the pilgrimage to Jerusalem by foot [<i>regel</i>] during the Festival, which comes to <b>exclude people who have prostheses.</b> This indicates that a prosthetic foot is not called a <i>regel</i>, which seems to contradict the mishna that allows <i>ḥalitza</i> on a prosthetic from the knee down.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>It is different here,</b> with respect to <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>as it is written:</b> “She removes the shoe <b>from on his foot [<i>me’al raglo</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:9), which indicates that not only can his actual foot be used for performing <i>ḥalitza</i>, but also the part above it, i.e., the calf. The Gemara objects: <b>If that is so,</b> that one may use a part of his leg above his foot to perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, then if one’s leg was amputated <b>from above the knee,</b> he should <b>also</b> be eligible for <i>ḥalitza</i>; and yet, the same mishna taught that only one with a leg amputated from below the knee is eligible for <i>ḥalitza</i>. The Gemara answers that the verse states: <b>“From on</b> his foot,” meaning above his foot, <b>but not: From on that which is on</b> his foot; the wording indicates that it can be above his foot until the knee, but not any further above that.",
            "<b>Rav Pappa said: Learn from here that the heel bone [<i>istavira</i>] reaches to the ground</b> where it connects to the foot, <b>for if it enters your mind</b> to say <b>that it is separate and divided,</b> and there is another bone in between, <b>then that</b> ankle bone <b>is “from on</b> the foot” <b>and the calf</b> would be prohibited for <i>ḥalitza</i>, as it would be considered: <b>From on that which is on</b> his foot. <b>Rav Ashi said: Even</b> if <b>you say that it is separate and divided</b> from the calf, because <b>anything that is connected with the</b> sole of the <b>foot is considered like the foot,</b> then the ankle is certainly part of the foot, making the calf the area that is “from on the foot.”",
            "It was taught in the mishna that if one’s legs were amputated <b>from the knee and above,</b> the <i>ḥalitza</i> is invalid.

            "The Gemara continues its challenge. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another verse: <b>“He had neither dressed his feet [<i>raglav</i>], nor trimmed his beard”</b> (II Samuel 19:25). The phrase “dressed his feet [<i>raglav</i>]” is referring to treating his pubic hair, implying that even the area around the thigh is referred to as <i>regel</i>.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>He implants filth in her</b> and contaminates her, as her body accepts his semen. <b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> also <b>said,</b> based on his understanding that the serpent seduced Eve into having sexual relations with him: <b>When the serpent came upon Eve, he infected her with</b> moral <b>contamination,</b> and this contamination remained in all human beings. When the <b>Jewish people stood at Mount Sinai their contamination ceased,</b> whereas with regard to <b>gentiles, who did not stand at Mount Sinai, their contamination never ceased.</b> Therefore, Yael was repulsed by the contamination that she allowed into her body, and she did not benefit from relations with Sisera.",

            "The Gemara elaborates: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say <b>that</b> an item with confirmed leprosy <b>is considered as if it were crushed</b> and not intact due to the requirement to burn it, <b>then</b> in order to contract ritual impurity through entering a house with leprosy, <b>we require</b> that there be a house, as the verse states: <b>“Moreover, one who enters the</b> house…shall be ritually impure” (Leviticus 14:46)? <b>And this</b> requirement <b>is not</b> satisfied here, as the house confirmed with leprosy must be burned and consequently should be considered as if it is crushed and not intact.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>There it is different, as the verse states: “And he shall break down the house”</b> (Leviticus 14:45), which teaches that <b>even while it is being broken down it is</b> still <b>called a house,</b> until it is totally destroyed. Therefore, although for other purposes, objects that are required to be burned are considered crushed, the verse explicitly teaches that a house confirmed with leprosy is considered intact with regard to its ability to transmit ritual impurity to those who enter it.",
            "<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Nega’im</i> 7:3): If <b>a rag that is three</b> fingerbreadths <b>by three</b> fingerbreadths has a spot of leprosy, then <b>even if it does not contain</b> the minimum volume of <b>an olive-bulk, once most</b> of the rag <b>enters a pure house it renders</b> the house <b>ritually impure.

The Gemara rejects this assumption: <b>No,</b> this is referring to a <b>quarantined</b> rag, which does not have to be burned and is consequently considered intact. It can be measured to determine if it has the minimum measurements required for imparting ritual impurity.",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>If</b> you interpret it <b>so, say the latter clause: If</b> the rag <b>was the volume of several olives,</b> i.e., it was very thick and even a small section of the cloth was equal to an olive-bulk, <b>when one olive-bulk of</b> the rag <b>enters a ritually pure house,</b> even if it is a small portion of the rag, <b>it renders</b> the house <b>ritually impure.</b>",
            "<b>Granted, if you say</b> that the entire <i>baraita</i> is referring to a rag with <b>confirmed</b> leprosy, <b>this is</b> so <b>because</b> a confirmed leper is <b>juxtaposed with</b> and thereby compared to <b>a dead person</b> (Numbers 12:12), and therefore an olive-bulk of the rag causes ritual impurity just as an olive-bulk of a corpse does. <b>But if you say</b> it is speaking about a <b>quarantined</b> rag, <b>why should it be juxtaposed to a dead person?</b> There is no biblical source comparing a quarantined leper to a corpse, and therefore, there is no reason to think that an olive-bulk of a rag transmits ritual impurity. Only if the rag is of the minimum dimensions and the entire rag enters the airspace does it transmit ritual impurity.",
            "The Gemara answers: That is correct; the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a rag with confirmed leprosy, but nevertheless it is not difficult for Rav Pappi. Although generally objects that are required to be burnt are considered crushed even before they are burnt, this is not true with regard to a garment with leprosy. <b>There</b> the <i>halakha</i> for a garment that has confirmed leprosy <b>is different, as the verse states: “And he shall burn the garment”</b> (Leviticus 13:52), which indicates that <b>even when it is being burned, it is still called a garment.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: If your interpretation above is correct, that a garment with confirmed leprosy can still transmit ritual impurity even though the object is to be burned and should be considered crushed, <b>let us learn from this</b> concerning a sandal that even after it has been definitively determined to have leprosy, it is still considered a shoe and should be eligible for <i>ḥalitza</i>, at least after the fact, in accordance with Rav Pappa’s opinion. The Gemara answers: <b>We cannot derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> of <b>a prohibition from</b> a <i>halakha</i> of <b>ritual impurity,</b> as these different areas of <i>halakha</i> cannot be compared. Therefore, although a garment with leprosy is considered intact with regard to the transmission of ritual impurity, that status cannot act as a source to teach that it is intact for the purpose of ruling that <i>ḥalitza</i> performed with a shoe with confirmed leprosy is valid.",
            "The Gemara cites Rava’s final ruling: <b>Rava said</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is the same for a quarantined sandal, a confirmed sandal, and a sandal of idolatrous worship,</b> i.e., a sandal that was placed on a statue of idolatrous worship; <b>one should not perform <i>ḥalitza</i></b> with it, <b>and if she did perform <i>ḥalitza</i></b> with it, <b>her <i>ḥalitza</i> is valid.</b> If, however, he was wearing a sandal <b>that</b> functioned as <b>an offering of idolatrous worship,</b> in that it was brought as a gift to an idol;"

            "<b>Rava said: Actually, do not reverse</b> the opinions.

The Gemara explains: It <b>can be refuted, as the leper</b> is unique in that there is a very specific process necessary for his purification: He requires that the blood of the offering be sprinkled upon him, and <b>he requires cedarwood, hyssop, and scarlet thread.</b> Therefore, it is possible to say that the Torah also specified the use of the right foot in the case of the leper.

            "The Gemara asks: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is</b> this <i>halakha</i> taught? <b>If we say it is</b> in accordance with <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> who stated in the mishna that spitting is not required after the fact, it is difficult, as the following <i>a fortiori</i> reasoning indicates: <b>Now if</b> even in a case <b>where there is a mitzva</b> of <i>ḥalitza</i>, and the <i>yevama</i> is still around and capable of fulfilling the Torah command of spitting, <b>and one might say</b> that spitting should be treated just <b>as it is with</b> regard to <b>the</b> fatty <b>portions</b> of offerings that are to be consumed on the altar, where the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that when they are not</b> present for offering, i.e., they were lost or became ritually impure, they are <b>not</b> considered <b>indispensable</b> to permit the consumption of the offering.",
            "When the fats of the offering are no longer present for offering, it is permitted for the sacrificial meat to be eaten by the priests through the sprinkling of blood alone, even without offering the fatty portions on the altar. <b>But when</b> the fatty portions <b>are present</b> and extant, then they are considered <b>indispensable,</b> and the priests are not permitted to eat their portions of the offering until the fatty portions are burned on the altar.",
            "Based on an analogy to the fatty portions of offerings, one would have said regarding the spitting of a <i>yevama</i> that even if it is not indispensable after the fact, so long as the <i>yevama</i> is around, one would expect that her spitting is indispensable. Yet even so, <b>Rabbi Akiva said</b> in the mishna that spitting is <b>not indispensable</b> to <i>ḥalitza</i> even in such a case, and the <i>ḥalitza</i> is validated by the removal of the shoe alone. Since Rabbi Akiva seems to accord little significance to the spitting, he cannot be the basis for this <i>halakha</i>, as if spitting is never indispensable, could spitting alone <b>disqualify her from</b> entering into levirate marriage with one of <b>the brothers?</b>",
            "<b>But rather,</b> one might say that this teaching is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> who disagrees with Rabbi Akiva and states in the mishna that spitting is indispensable for validating <i>ḥalitza</i> and is necessary alongside the removal of the shoe. Since he accords significance to the spitting, one might have thought that the teaching prohibiting the <i>yevama</i> from levirate marriage is in accordance with his view.",
            "<b>But</b> that is difficult as well, as according to Rabbi Elazar, removal of the shoe and spitting are both necessary, and therefore, they <b>are</b> considered <b>two permitting factors</b> that must be completed in order to fulfill an obligation. <b>And</b> there is a principle accepted by Rabbi Elazar with regard to offerings that should be applicable here: Whenever <b>there are two permitting factors</b> that are indispensable for an offering to be valid, <b>one</b> of those factors <b>cannot elevate one</b> of the subordinate components of the offering to consecrated status <b>without the other.</b> Similarly, since Rabbi Elazar holds that <i>ḥalitza</i> and spitting are both indispensable, if she performs only one of these actions, such as spitting, it is only one of two permitting factors and therefore should not disqualify her for levirate marriage with one of the other <i>yevamin</i>.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> one must say that this teaching is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who is of the opinion that even one of two permitting factors can effect a change in status without performance of the other factor, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The lambs</b> sacrificed on the festival <b>of Assembly,</b> i.e., <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>consecrate the loaves</b> that accompany them <b>only by</b> means of their <b>slaughter,</b> as the slaughtering of the lambs consecrates the bread.",
            "<b>How so?</b> If <b>one slaughtered</b> the lambs <b>for their own sake,</b> i.e., as lambs for <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>and</b> the priest <b>sprinkled their blood for their own sake, the loaves are consecrated.</b> However, if <b>one slaughtered</b> them <b>not for their own sake, and</b> the priest <b>sprinkled their blood for their own sake, the loaves are not consecrated,</b> as the factors indispensable in rendering the offering valid were not properly performed. If <b>one slaughtered them for their own sake, and he sprinkled their blood not for their own sake,</b> the fact that the lambs were properly slaughtered renders the loaves partially consecrated. Therefore, the loaves <b>are consecrated</b> to the extent that they cannot be redeemed, <b>but they are not consecrated</b> to the extent that they may be eaten. <b>This is the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.",
            "<b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: Actually,</b> the loaves <b>are consecrated only when one slaughters</b> the offerings <b>for their own sake and sprinkles their blood for their own sake,</b> i.e., only if both factors indispensable in rendering the offering valid were properly performed. If so, the teaching sent from Eretz Yisrael seems to be in accordance with Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion that even if only one of the two permitting factors of slaughter and sprinkling was performed, the loaves will still be consecrated. Likewise, with respect to <i>ḥalitza</i>, where there is a need for two permitting factors, spitting and removal of the shoe, performing one factor such as spitting is sufficient to disqualify the <i>yevama</i> from subsequently entering into levirate marriage.",
            "The Gemara questions the previous assumption with regard to Rabbi Akiva’s opinion on the matter: <b>But did Rabbi Akiva say that spitting does not disqualify</b> the <i>yevama</i> from a later levirate marriage to one of the other brothers? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If she removed</b> the shoe <b>but did not</b>"

            "The Gemara clarifies: <b>Who is</b> the author of the <i>baraita</i>? <b>If we say</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> could it be that he would hold that <b>if she removed</b> the shoe <b>but did not spit or did not recite</b> the verses, <b>her <i>ḥalitza</i> is valid,</b> as stated in the <i>baraita</i>? <b>But didn’t Rabbi Eliezer say:</b> The phrase <b>“so shall it be done”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:9) indicates that any <b>element</b> of the <i>ḥalitza</i> process <b>that</b> constitutes <b>an action is indispensable;</b> therefore spitting is necessary. <b>Rather,</b> it <b>is obvious</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, and he teaches</b> at the end of the <i>baraita</i> that <b>if she spat but did not remove</b> the shoe <b>or did not recite</b> the text, <b>her <i>ḥalitza</i> is disqualified.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>To whom</b> is the <i>yevama</i> disqualified from marrying after such a <i>ḥalitza</i>?",
            "<b>If we say</b> that Rabbi Akiva means to teach us that she is disqualified from marriage <b>to everyone</b> in the world, this is unnecessary, as it is clear that spitting alone will not permit her to marry any stranger. It <b>is obvious</b> that her <i>ḥalitza</i> is invalid, as <b>did any <i>ḥalitza</i> take place</b> in order <b>for her to be permitted to a stranger? Rather, is it not</b> clear that Rabbi Akiva is ruling that she is disqualified from marriage <b>to the brothers? Learn from here</b> that Rabbi Akiva also thinks that spitting alone disqualifies her from marriage to the brothers, which is not in accordance with the previous assumption with regard to his opinion.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But according to Rabbi Akiva’s</b> understanding that only an action performed on the body of the <i>yavam</i> is indispensable for <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>what is different</b> about <b>spitting and what is different</b> about <b>recitation?</b> Both are not indispensable, so why is it that if she spat but did not remove the shoe she is disqualified from marriage to the brothers, yet if she recited the text but did not remove the shoe her action has no halakhic significance?",
            "The Gemara answers: Rabbi Akiva finds a reason to rabbinically prohibit the woman after spitting, yet holds that the reason is not valid after the recitation alone. <b>The recitation</b> of the verses, <b>which takes place both at the beginning</b> of the process, before the removal of the shoe, <b>and at the end, will not cause him to be confused</b> about a proper <i>ḥalitza</i>, as one who witnesses her recitation knows that she may have only recited the text but has not yet removed the shoe, and therefore it will cause no harm to invalidate her <i>ḥalitza</i> and permit her in levirate marriage to the <i>yevamin</i>. But with regard to <b>spitting, which</b> does <b>not take place at the beginning but takes place at the end,</b> after the removal of the shoe, one who witnesses her spitting might assume that she had already removed the shoe, and <b>he</b> might <b>confuse</b> this woman with a woman who removed the shoe, and if we would allow her to perform levirate marriage after the spitting, <b>they will come to permit a <i>yevama</i> who performed <i>ḥalitza</i> to</b> marry <b>the brothers</b> of the <i>yavam</i> after the <i>ḥalitza</i>. Therefore, Rabbi Akiva finds reason to rabbinically prohibit a woman after spitting, although he doesn’t do so if they merely recited the verses of <i>ḥalitza</i>.",
            "<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>this is what they sent to</b> Shmuel’s father: <b>A <i>yevama</i> who spat</b> before removing the shoe <b>shall remove</b> the shoe, <b>and she is not required to spit another time. This is like</b> the incident <b>where a certain woman came before Rabbi Ami</b> for <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>and Rabbi Abba bar Memel sat before him</b> at the time. <b>She spat before she removed</b> the shoe. <b>Rabbi Ami said to him:</b> Rabbi Abba, tell <b>her to remove</b> the shoe of the <i>yavam</i>, <b>so</b> one may <b>dismiss her case</b> from the court, as she does not require another act of spitting.",
            "<b>Rabbi Abba said to him: But</b> for <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>we need her to spit.</b> He answered: <b>She</b> already <b>spat.</b> Rabbi Abba said to him: That spitting was done before the removal, <b>so let her spit again, and what</b> would be the problem <b>with that?</b> He answered him: <b>A disaster</b> could be <b>brought out from it, as, if you say she should spit again</b> there will be others who <b>say: The first spitting has no</b> halakhic <b>significance</b> and she is still permitted to the brothers if no spitting was performed subsequently, <b>and they will come to permit</b> a bona fide <b><i>ḥalutza</i>,</b> i.e., a <i>yevama</i> who has performed <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>to the brothers,</b> because when they see her spitting the first time they will say that she certainly already removed the shoe beforehand.",

            "Apropos adherence to instructions given in the Torah, the Gemara relates a story. <b>Levi went out to the villages</b> to teach people Torah. <b>They asked him</b> several questions: Firstly, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> for <b>an armless woman, may she perform <i>ḥalitza</i></b> with her teeth? Secondly, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if <b>a <i>yevama</i> spat blood</b> instead of saliva, is the <i>ḥalitza</i> valid? Furthermore, they asked with regard to the verse: <b>“But I will declare to you that which is inscribed in the writing of truth”</b> (Daniel 10:21), if <b>by inference, there is writing</b> in Heaven <b>that is not truth.</b>",
            "<b>He did not have</b> an answer <b>at hand</b> to these questions, so <b>he came and asked</b> at <b>the house of study.

With regard to the second question, they said: <b>And does it say</b> in the verse: <b>And she shall spit saliva?</b> It merely states: “And she shall spit,” indicating that even if she spits blood the <i>ḥalitza</i> is valid.",
            "With regard to the verse cited in the third question: <b>“But I will declare to you that which is inscribed in the writing of truth,”</b> about which you ask: <b>But is there writing</b> in Heaven <b>that is not truth?</b>",
            "This is <b>not difficult.

            "This is <b>in accordance with the words of Rav Shmuel bar Ami, as Rav Shmuel bar Ami said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a sentence of judgment accompanied by an oath cannot be torn up?</b> It is <b>as it is stated: “Therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be atoned for with sacrifice nor offering forever”</b> (I Samuel 3:14), which indicates that due to the accompanying oath, the sentence of judgment cannot ever be rescinded, even if offerings of atonement are brought.",
            "Apropos this verse, the Gemara mentions what <b>Rabba said</b> with regard to it: <b>With sacrifice and offering,</b> one from the house of Eli <b>will not be atoned for, but he may gain atonement through words of Torah</b> study. <b>Abaye said: Through sacrifice and offering he may not achieve atonement, but he may gain atonement through acts of kindness.</b> The Gemara relates that <b>Rabba and Abaye</b> themselves <b>descended from the house of Eli.

            "The Gemara relates a similar story from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Sages taught: There was a certain family in Jerusalem whose children were dying at around age eighteen.</b> The members of the family <b>came and told Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai</b> about these tragic deaths. <b>He said to them: Perhaps you are from the house of Eli, as it is stated: “All the increase of your house shall die young men”</b> (I Samuel 2:33), which teaches that as soon as they reach full maturity, old enough to be called “men,” they die. Therefore, you must <b>go out and immerse yourselves in Torah, and</b> you will <b>live.

            "The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult.

The Sages disagreed with regard to the details of this <i>halakha</i>: <b>Beit Shammai say: Only betrothed girls may refuse.</b> A girl may refuse, upon reaching adulthood, to remain married to the man to whom her mother or brothers married her as a minor after the death of her father. <b>But Beit Hillel say</b> that both <b>betrothed and fully married</b> girls may refuse.",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is there to say if she entered the marriage canopy but did not engage in sexual intercourse,</b> as this reason would not apply to such a case?

            "§ The Gemara asks: According to Rabbi Elazar, who holds that the mishna is disjointed, <b>who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> that <b>taught</b> that a minor may always remarry a husband she refused but not one who divorced her? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> This can be determined based on the following incident. <b>What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “We have drunk our water for money; our wood comes to us for a price”</b> (Lamentations 5:4), implying that Torah, which is analogous to water, can be purchased with money. The Gemara explains: <b>During the time of danger,</b> i.e., religious persecution by the Romans, <b>this halakhic ruling was requested: If she,</b> a minor, <b>left her first husband by means of a bill of divorce and her second by refusal, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to her returning to the first?</b>",
            "Those involved <b>hired one person for four hundred dinars</b> for the dangerous mission <b>and asked Rabbi Akiva,</b> who was incarcerated <b>in prison</b> by the Romans for teaching Torah, <b>and</b> he ruled that it is <b>forbidden.

            "<b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, said: This</b> question was not what they asked, as it <b>was unnecessary: If you</b> rendered <b>permitted a prohibition</b> for whose violation one is liable to receive <b>excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>],</b> i.e., if the prohibition against sexual intercourse with a married woman is dissolved by the refusal, as the marriage is nullified retroactively, then is it <b>not</b> clear <b>all the more so</b> that after a refusal, <b>the</b> regular <b>prohibition</b> against remarrying one’s ex-wife after she was married to another should be permitted? The opinion in the mishna that refusal does not cancel the effect of divorce is in accordance with that of Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira, while the opinion that she is permitted to return to her first husband after refusing the second one is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei.",
            "Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, continued: <b>Rather, this</b> is what <b>they asked: If</b> the minor <b>was the wife of someone’s mother’s brother, a secondary</b> forbidden relative, i.e., a relative forbidden <b>to him</b> by rabbinic law, <b>and</b> afterward <b>his paternal brother married her and died,</b> so that she became eligible to him for levirate marriage, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the following: <b>May she refuse now and uproot the first marriage</b> to the mother’s brother, so that she will no longer be a forbidden relative, and likewise her rival wife will not be the rival wife of a forbidden relative, <b>so that her rival wife may enter into levirate marriage?</b> In other words, <b>in a case</b> where there is <b>a mitzva</b> of levirate marriage, <b>is refusal after</b> the husband’s <b>death valid or not?</b>",

            "<b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Ashyan said: Rav concedes that she is permitted to the brother of the man to whom she is forbidden.</b> Rav Yitzḥak is referring to a case of a minor who refused her husband, remarried the same man, and was subsequently divorced, and then married another man and refused him. Although she may not remarry the first husband, she may marry his brother, despite the fact that one may not ordinarily marry one’s brother’s divorcée.",
            "The Gemara asks: It is <b>obvious.</b> It <b>is he,</b> her former husband, <b>whose hints and gestures she recognizes, but not</b> those of <b>his brother,</b> so that there is no concern that the brother will persuade her to refuse her husband. The Gemara explains: Rav Yitzḥak bar Ashyan saw fit to point this out, <b>lest you say: Issue a decree</b> rendering it prohibited for her to marry <b>this</b> brother <b>due to</b> the risk that such a marriage would lead people to think she is permitted to marry <b>that</b> brother, her original husband. Therefore, <b>he teaches us</b> that no such decree was instituted.",
            "<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> a different version of the discussion: <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Ashyan said: Just as she is forbidden to him,</b> to the man who divorced her, <b>so is she forbidden to his brothers.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But she is not familiar with their intimations and gestures.</b> Why is it prohibited for her to marry them? The Gemara answers: <b>It is a</b> rabbinic <b>decree concerning the</b> ex-husband’s <b>brothers due to him,</b> the ex-husband.

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Sage <b>Eifa said: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Elazar,</b> who prohibits a man from entering into levirate marriage with a woman whom his brother had divorced and remarried? It is <b>because she was forbidden to him at one time;</b> when the first brother divorced her, she became forbidden to the second brother due to her status as the first brother’s ex-wife. A husband’s relatives are forbidden to the wife even after death or divorce. However, the mitzva of levirate marriage grants a special exemption from the prohibition against marrying one’s brother’s wife. In this case, if the first brother had died while they were still divorced, the mitzva of levirate marriage would not have applied, and she would have been forbidden to him. <b>The Sages said to Eifa: If that is so, she should also not require <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> since she is a forbidden relative.",
            "<b>And if you would say: Indeed,</b> Rabbi Elazar also exempts her from <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>It was said in the name of Rabbi Elazar</b> that <b>she performs <i>ḥalitza</i>? Rather, Eifa said: I do not know the reason for</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar.</b>",
            "<b>Abaye said: This is the reasoning of Rabbi Elazar: He is uncertain whether the death</b> of the husband <b>determines</b> that she is a candidate for levirate marriage, <b>or</b> whether <b>the original marriage determines</b> it. In other words, he is uncertain as to whether the obligation to perform levirate marriage is established only at the death of one’s brother or already from the beginning of the brother’s marriage. <b>If death determines</b> that she is a candidate for levirate marriage, <b>then she has happened before him for levirate marriage,</b> as she is the wife of his childless brother who died. <b>If the original marriage determines</b> that she is a candidate for levirate marriage, <b>then she was forbidden to him for a time</b> as his brother’s ex-wife and is consequently exempt from levirate marriage. According to Rabbi Elazar, it is due to this uncertainty that the brother may not enter into levirate marriage yet must perform <i>ḥalitza</i>.",
            "<b>Rava said: Actually, it is obvious to Rabbi Elazar that death determines</b> that she is a candidate for levirate marriage. <b>However, everyone is well informed with regard to divorces.</b> Everyone knows that the woman was divorced, <b>while not everyone is well informed with regard to remarriage,</b> and they do not necessarily know that she remarried him. Therefore, there is concern that people will mistakenly think that one entered into levirate marriage with his brother’s ex-wife.",
            "The Gemara argues against this point: <b>On the contrary, her return</b> to her former husband, <b>since she is living with him, generates publicity,</b> so that it is known that they are remarried. The Gemara answers: <b>Are we not dealing</b> even with <b>a case in which he remarried her in the evening and died in the morning?</b> In this instance and others like it, not everyone would know that he remarried her, and they will think that the brother took his deceased brother’s ex-wife in levirate marriage. In order to avoid such situations, Rabbi Elazar decreed that she is always forbidden.",
            "<b>Rav Ashi said: This is the reasoning of Rabbi Elazar: He decreed</b> to prohibit levirate marriage with <b>these,</b> i.e., women who were divorced and remarried, <b>due to</b> the case of a girl who is considered <b>an orphan in the lifetime of</b> her <b>father,</b> who was divorced by her husband <b>and he</b> subsequently <b>remarried her.</b> If a minor girl was married off by her father and was subsequently divorced, she is no longer subject to her father with regard to marriage and divorce, but because she is a minor, any marriage she enters into is by rabbinic rather than by Torah law. The Gemara comments: <b>So too, this is reasonable based on what was taught in the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>A minor girl whose father married her off and who was</b> subsequently <b>divorced</b> while she was still a minor, <b>is like an orphan during her father’s lifetime. And if</b> the husband <b>remarries her</b> while she is still a minor and then dies, <b>everyone agrees that she is forbidden to the <i>yavam</i></b> and may not enter into levirate marriage.",

As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said in the name of Rabbi Elazar: The <i>teruma</i> of a deaf-mute is not released into a non-sacred</b> status, <b>because it is uncertain.</b> Rabbi Elazar does not maintain that the actions of a deaf-mute have no consequence whatsoever. The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> Shmuel <b>maintains, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> that a deaf-mute is competent, <b>let him also obligate</b> a man who has relations with the wife of a deaf-mute <b>to</b> bring <b>a guilt-offering for uncertainty.</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>We require one piece from two pieces.</b> Shmuel maintains that one is not liable to bring a guilt-offering for uncertainty in every case where there is doubt whether or not there was a transgression, and where one would be liable to bring a sin-offering if it were certain that there was a transgression. Rather, a guilt-offering for uncertainty is brought if, for example, one had two pieces of meat before him, one of which was definitely forbidden while the other was permitted, but he does not know with certainty which one he ate. However, when the doubt involves a single item or action, which may or may not have been prohibited, in that situation one does not bring a guilt-offering for uncertainty. In the case discussed here, the doubt concerning the wife of a deaf-mute does not involve a choice between an action that is prohibited and one that is permitted. Rather, it depends on the status of the woman’s marriage.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Elazar need</b> a case involving <b>one piece from two pieces</b> to render one liable to bring a guilt-offering for uncertainty? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> With regard to <b>a <i>koy</i>,</b> a kosher animal with characteristics of both a domesticated animal and a non-domesticated animal, <b>one is obligated to</b> bring <b>a guilt-offering for uncertainty for</b> eating <b>its forbidden fat.</b> Certain fats, which are permitted in the case of a wild animal, are prohibited if they are from a domesticated animal, and one who partakes of them is liable to bring a sin-offering. Since a <i>koy</i> is of uncertain status, one must bring a guilt-offering for uncertainty for eating its fat. This shows that Rabbi Elazar maintains that one brings a guilt-offering for uncertainty even for a doubt involving one item or action.",

            "<b>Rav Ashi raised a dilemma: What is the reason for</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar?</b> One possibility is that it <b>is obvious to him that the mind of a deaf-mute is weak.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the practical difference</b> how one defines the intellectual capacity of a deaf-mute? The Gemara answers: It makes a difference with respect <b>to divorcing his wife with a bill of divorce.

            "<b>And the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> this slightly differently.

The Gemara explains the sides of the dilemma: <b>The reason that the daughter of her mother-in-law</b> is suspected of lying is <b>because she has a mother who hates</b> her daughter-in-law, and therefore the daughter <b>also hates her.

Here too, there is no need for a separate reason in order that the hatred be reciprocated. The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Yehuda,</b> why doesn’t he rely on this verse?

            "The Gemara then validates this concern. <b>If she</b> actually <b>married an Israelite,</b> which is permitted for a divorced woman, then <b>indeed</b> one must consider the possibility that she is actually divorced and not widowed, and the rival wife is not permitted to marry.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> the miraculous element is <b>that he did not sleep</b> during those three days, <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> If one says: I hereby take on <b>an oath that I will not sleep for three days,</b> the court <b>flogs him</b> for taking an oath in vain, <b>and he may sleep immediately</b> because it is impossible to remain awake for three consecutive days.",
