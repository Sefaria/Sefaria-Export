Elazar said:  One may assign charity to the poor on Shabbat; And R. Jacob said [that] R. Yohanan said: One may go to synagogues and to schoolhouses to watch over public affairs on Shabbat; And R.

Because, if you will say that the intercourse should take place on the fifth day, in the morning he will rise and go to his work; therefore the Sages watched over the welfare of the daughters of Israel that he should celebrate with her three days, on the fifth day of the week, on the eve of Shabbat and [on] Shabbat.",
