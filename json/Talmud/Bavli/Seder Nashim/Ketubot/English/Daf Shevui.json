            "A virgin is married on the fourth day [of the week] and a widow on the fifth day, for twice in the week the courts sit in the towns, on the second day [of the week] and on the fifth day, so that if he [the husband] had a claim as to the virginity [of the bride] he could go early [on the morning of the fifth day of the week] to the court.", 
            "GEMARA. R. Joseph said: Rav Judah said [that] Shmuel said:  Why did they [the rabbis] say: A virgin is married on the fourth day? Because we have learned: If the time [determined for the marriage] arrived and they were not married, they eat of his [food] and they eat of terumah.”", 
            "You might have thought that if the time arrived on the first day of the week he would have to supply her with food, therefore have we learned,  “A virgin is married on the fourth day.”", 
            "R. Joseph said: Master of Abraham! He [Shmuel] attaches a Mishnah which was taught, to a Mishnah which was not taught! Which was taught and which was not taught? This was taught and this was taught! Rather  he attaches a Mishnah, the reason of which was explained, to a Mishnah, the reason of which was not explained.", 
            "Rather if it was said, this is what was said: Rav Judah said [that] Shmuel said: Why did they say, “A virgin is married on the fourth day of the week”? Because if he had a virginity claim he could go early the [next morning] to the court.  Let her be married on the first day of the week, and if he has a virginity claim he could go early [on the morning of the second day of the week] to the court! The Sages watched over the interests of the daughters of Israel so that [the bridegroom] should prepare for the feast three days,  on the first day in the week, the second day in the week, and the third day in the week, and on the fourth day he marries her.", 
            "And now that we have learned that the sages “watched over the interests” that which we have learned: If the time arrived and they were not married, they eat of his [food] and they eat of terumah, if the time arrived on the first day of the week, since he cannot marry her, he does not give her food.", 
            "Therefore, if he became ill or she became ill, or she began to menstruate, he does not give her food.", 
            "There are those who put this as a question: If he became ill, what is [the law]?  There the reason [he need not support her,] is because he is forced, and here too, he is also forced? Or perhaps there he was forced by an enactment which the Rabbis enacted, but here, he is not? ", 
            "And if you say:  If he became ill he provides her with food, [then the question would still be] if she became ill, what is [the law]?  Can he say to her, I am here? Or, perhaps, she can say to him, “His field has been flooded”?", 
            "And if you will say [that] she can say to him, “His field has been flooded” [then the question is,] if she began to menstruate, what is the law? ",

            "During her regular time there is no question that she cannot say to him, “His field has been flooded.  When is the question asked? Not during her regular time, what is [the law]? Since it is not during her regular time, she can say to him, “His field has been flooded”? Or, perhaps, since there are women who change their periods, it is as if it was her regular time?", 
            "R. Ahai answered: [The mishnah states]:  “When the time came and they were not married, they eat of his food and they eat of terumah.” It does not state: They [the men] did not marry them [the women], rather [it says] “They [the women] were not married.” What is the case? If they delayed [the marriage] why should they eat of his food and eat of the terumah? ", 
            "Therefore, you must say that they were forced as in this case, and it states “they eat of his food and they eat of terumah”?", 
            "R. Ashi said: Indeed I can say [that]  in the case of any forced [delay] she does not eat [of his]. And [the mishnah refers to a case where] they [the men] delayed. And it should have stated, “They [the men] did not marry [the women].” But since the first clause refers to them [the women], the latter clause also speaks of them [the women].", 
            "Rava said:  And with regard to divorce it is not so.  thus Rava holds [that]  “force” is not a claim in regard to divorce.", 
            "From where does Rava get this [rule]?  If we say, from what we have learned:  “Behold this is your get if I do not come back from now until twelve months,” and he died within twelve months, there is no divorce.  [And we would conclude from this that only if] he died there is no divorce, but if he became ill there is a divorce. ", 
            "But perhaps I could say to you [that]  if he became ill there would also be no divorce. And it teaches us that  there is no divorce after death.", 
            "[That] there is no divorce after death, it taught us earlier:  “Behold, this is your get if I die,” [or] “Behold, this is your get [if I die] from this illness,” [or] “Behold, this is your get after [my] death,” he has not said anything.", 
            "[But] perhaps [that mishnah] excludes from the opinion of our rabbis,  for it has been taught: Our rabbis allowed her to marry again. And we said: Who are ‘our rabbis?  Rav Judah said [that] Shmuel said: The court that allowed the oil [of gentiles].  They hold like R. Yose who said, “The date of the document attests to [when it is effective].", 
            "Rather [he derives it from the] later clause:  This is your get]  from now if I do not come [back] from now [and] until twelve months,” and he died within the twelve months, it is a divorce. [And we may deduce] “if he died,” and the same rule applies if he became ill. ", 
            "[But] perhaps [the divorce is effective] only when he died, because he did not want her to be liable to [marry] the levir (yavam).",

He said to them, “Look, I have come [back]; look, I have come [back]!”   Shmuel said: This is not regarded as having come back.",

Joshua.",
