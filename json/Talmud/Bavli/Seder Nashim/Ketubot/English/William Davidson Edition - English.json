            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A virgin is married on Wednesday and a widow on Thursday.</b> The reason for the former is <b>that twice a week courts convene in the towns, on Monday and Thursday,</b> so <b>that if</b> the husband <b>had a claim concerning</b> the bride’s <b>virginity</b> when consummating the marriage on Wednesday night, <b>he would go early</b> the next day <b>to court</b> and make his claim.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yosef said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Due to what</b> reason <b>did they say that a virgin is married on Wednesday?</b> It is <b>because we learned</b> in a mishna elsewhere (57a): <b>If the time</b> that the groom designated for the wedding <b>arrived,</b> and the wedding was postponed, <b>and they were not married,</b> the brides are entitled to <b>eat from his</b> food <b>and,</b> if he is a priest, <b>eat <i>teruma</i>.</b>",
            "<b>One might think</b> that if the designated <b>time arrived on Sunday,</b> and the wedding was postponed, <b>he would provide her sustenance</b> beginning on Sunday. <b>Therefore, we learned: A virgin is married on Wednesday.</b> Until Wednesday, the designated time is not considered to have arrived, even if the original date was earlier in the week.",
            "After citing the statements above, <b>Rav Yosef said</b> in astonishment: <b>Lord of Abraham,</b> Shmuel <b>makes</b> that which <b>is taught dependent on</b> that which <b>is not taught,</b> using the latter to explain the former. The Gemara asks: <b>Which is taught and which is not taught?</b> Both <b>this</b> mishna <b>is taught</b> and <b>that</b> mishna <b>is taught.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> Shmuel <b>makes</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>is taught</b> in the mishna here, <b>whose reason is explicit, dependent on</b> a <i>halakha</i> that <b>is taught</b> in the later mishna, <b>whose reason is not explicit.</b> Citation of the later mishna contributed nothing to the understanding of the mishna here.",
            "<b>Rather, if it was stated, this</b> is how <b>it was stated: Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Due to what</b> reason <b>did</b> the Sages in the mishna <b>say</b> that <b>a virgin is married on Wednesday?</b> It is so <b>that if</b> the husband <b>had a claim concerning</b> the bride’s <b>virginity, he would go early</b> the next day <b>to court</b> and make his claim. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if that is the reason, <b>let her marry on Sunday, as</b> then too, <b>if</b> the husband <b>had a claim concerning</b> the bride’s <b>virginity, he would go early</b> the next day <b>to court</b> and make his claim. The Gemara answers: The <b>Sages were assiduous in seeing to the well-being of Jewish women</b> and instituted that the wedding take place on Wednesday, <b>so that</b> the groom <b>would exert</b> himself <b>in</b> arranging <b>the</b> wedding <b>feast for three days: Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, and on Wednesday, he marries her.</b>",
            "The Gemara continues: <b>And now that we learned</b> that the reason for the ruling in the mishna that a woman is married on Wednesday is that the Sages <b>were assiduous</b> in this matter, then with regard to <b>that</b> <i>halakha</i>, <b>which we learned</b> in the later mishna: <b>If the time arrived and they were not married,</b> the brides are entitled to <b>eat from his</b> food <b>and eat <i>teruma</i>,</b> one may conclude: <b>If</b> the <b>time arrived on Sunday, since</b> he is <b>unable to marry</b> her because he is busy preparing the wedding feast, <b>he is not obligated to provide her sustenance</b> until Wednesday.",
            "<b>Therefore,</b> according to the same line of reasoning, if the husband <b>fell ill, or if</b> the bride <b>fell ill, or</b> in a case <b>where she began to menstruate [<i>peirsa nidda</i>]</b> and the wedding had to be postponed, he similarly need <b>not provide her sustenance</b> from the designated time, as he did not initiate the delay.",
            "<b>And there are</b> those <b>who raised it as a dilemma: If</b> the groom <b>fell ill, what is</b> the ruling with regard to his obligation to provide her sustenance? <b>There,</b> in the case where the designated time arrived on Sunday, <b>what is the reason</b> that he is exempt? It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that he was forced</b> to postpone the wedding by circumstances beyond his control. <b>And here too, isn’t he forced</b> by circumstances beyond his control, and he should therefore be exempt? <b>Or, perhaps</b> there is a distinction between the cases. <b>There, he was forced by an ordinance that was instituted by the Sages</b> that a virgin marries on Wednesday, and they exempted him from providing for her until then. <b>However, here,</b> that is <b>not</b> the case. Therefore, despite the existence of circumstances beyond his control, he is not exempt from providing her sustenance due to his illness.",
            "<b>And if you say that if he fell ill, he provides her sustenance</b> at the time designated for the wedding, then <b>if she fell ill, what is</b> the ruling? <b>Can he say to her: I am standing here</b> prepared to wed you, and if you are not prepared, it is not my fault? <b>Or perhaps she can say to him that his field was inundated,</b> i.e., her illness is tantamount to a natural disaster that befell him, and he must nevertheless provide for her.",
            "<b>And if you say that</b> if she fell ill <b>she</b> can <b>say to him that his field was inundated,</b> if <b>she became a menstruating woman</b> and the wedding was postponed, <b>what is</b> the ruling? Is this too considered an unavoidable circumstance, like illness, and he must provide for her, or was this predictable?",
            "If she began menstruating <b>at the time of her set period [<i>vista</i>], do not raise the dilemma,</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>as</b> it is clear that <b>she cannot say to him</b> that <b>his field was inundated.</b> Here, the circumstances were avoidable, and postponement of the wedding is attributable to her. <b>When you</b> should <b>raise a dilemma</b> is in a case where menstruation began <b>not at the time of her set period. What</b> is the ruling there? <b>Since it is not the time of her set period,</b> it is comparable to the case of her illness, and <b>she can say to him that his field was inundated. Or, perhaps since there are some women whose set period changes,</b> it is avoidable, and its legal status <b>is like</b> menstruation at <b>the time of her set period,</b> and postponement of the wedding is attributable to her.",
            "<b>Rav Aḥai resolved</b> these dilemmas through a careful reading of the mishna: <b>If the time arrived and they were not married,</b> the brides are entitled to <b>eat from his</b> food <b>and eat <i>teruma</i>. It doesn’t teach: And</b> the grooms <b>didn’t marry,</b> in the active form. <b>Rather,</b> it teaches: <b>And</b> the brides <b>were not married,</b> in the passive form.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> described in the phrase: They were not married? <b>If the</b> brides <b>postpone</b> the marriage, <b>why do they eat from his</b> food <b>and eat <i>teruma</i>? Rather, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where they were compelled</b> by circumstances beyond their control <b>in that manner,</b> e.g., the bride falling ill or beginning to menstruate, <b>and it teaches:</b> The brides <b>eat from his</b> food <b>and eat <i>teruma</i>,</b> and his bad fortune is responsible for his situation.",
            "<b>Rav Ashi said: Actually, I will say to you: In any</b> case <b>of unavoidable circumstances,</b> whether they affect him or they affect her, <b>she doesn’t eat</b> from his food, <b>and</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> grooms <b>postpone the wedding. And by right,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>should have taught: They didn’t marry,</b> which would have established that grooms caused the postponement. <b>And since</b> the <i>tanna</i> taught <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna cited above <b>in</b> terms of a bride: The Sages give a virgin twelve months, <b>it taught the latter clause in</b> terms of a bride. Therefore, no inference may be drawn from the formulation of the latter clause. Only if the groom postpones the wedding is he obligated to provide sustenance for the women when the time designated for the wedding arrives.",
            "<b>Rava said: And</b> although delays caused by circumstances beyond his control exempt the groom from providing support to his betrothed at the time originally designated for the wedding, with regard <b>to bills of divorce that is not so. Apparently, Rava maintains that unavoidable circumstances</b> have <b>no</b> legal standing with regard <b>to bills of divorce.</b> If one stipulated that the bill of divorce will take effect only with the fulfillment of a condition, even if that condition was fulfilled due to circumstances beyond his control, the bill of divorce takes effect.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>From where does Rava</b> learn <b>this</b> principle? <b>If we say it is from that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 76b) with regard to one who said to his wife: <b>This is your bill of divorce, if I do not return from now until</b> the conclusion of <b>twelve months, and he died within</b> those <b>twelve months,</b> the document <b>is not a bill of divorce.</b> Therefore, if she has no children from her deceased husband, the <i>halakhot</i> of levirate marriage would apply to her. The Gemara infers: If <b>he died,</b> that <b>is when it is not a bill of divorce,</b> since a divorce cannot take effect posthumously. By inference, in cases involving other circumstances beyond his control, e.g., if <b>he fell ill,</b> and therefore did not return, <b>it is a bill of divorce</b> and it takes effect. Apparently, if the reason for his failure to arrive is a circumstance beyond his control, the divorce takes effect.",
            "The Gemara refutes that proof. <b>And perhaps, actually I will say to you</b> that in the case where <b>he falls ill it is also not a bill of divorce,</b> and the mishna cited the case of death merely as an example of circumstances beyond his control. <b>And</b> the reason <b>that</b> example <b>itself</b> was chosen is <b>to teach us that there is no bill of divorce posthumously.</b> Even if the divorce is not conditional, and the husband simply states that it will take effect after he dies, it is not a valid bill of divorce.",
            "The Gemara asks: Does it come to teach that <b>there is no bill of divorce posthumously? Wasn’t it</b> already <b>taught in the first clause</b> of the mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 72a) that if one on his deathbed said to his wife: <b>This is your bill of divorce if I die,</b> or: <b>This is your bill of divorce</b> if I die <b>from this illness,</b> or: <b>This is your bill of divorce after I die, he said nothing.</b> The bill of divorce does not take effect after his death.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Perhaps</b> it was necessary for the first clause to mention specifically the case of death, <b>to exclude that which our Rabbis</b> said and not to exclude the case of one who fell ill, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And our Rabbis permitted her to remarry,</b> in a case where he died within the twelve months that he stipulated. <b>And we said: Who are our Rabbis</b> mentioned here? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> It is <b>the court that permitted</b> the <b>oil</b> of gentiles for consumption. In this regard, <b>they hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, who said: The time</b> written <b>in a document proves</b> when <b>it</b> takes effect. The fact that a certain date is written in the bill of divorce indicates that one’s intention was that the divorce take effect from the day that it was written and delivered, not after his death. In any event, there is proof neither for nor against Rava’s opinion from this <i>baraita</i>.",
            "<b>And rather,</b> proof may be cited from the <b>latter clause</b> of the mishna. If a man says to his wife: This is your bill of divorce <b>from now if I do not return from now until</b> the conclusion of <b>twelve months, and he died within</b> those <b>twelve months, this</b> document <b>is a bill of divorce.</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> in a case where <b>he dies,</b> and <b>the same is true</b> if <b>he fell ill.</b> If the divorce takes effect when his failure to return is attributable to death, the ultimate circumstance beyond his control, all the more so should it take effect if it is attributable to a less extreme circumstance.",
            "The Gemara rejects that proof: <b>Perhaps</b> the divorce takes effect <b>specifically</b> in the case where <b>he died,</b> because <b>he is not amenable</b> to have his wife <b>happen before</b> her <b><i>yavam</i>,</b> his brother, if he had no children. However, if other circumstances beyond his control caused the condition to be fulfilled, where levirate marriage is not a consideration, his intention is that the bill of divorce will not take effect.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> proof may be cited <b>from this</b> case, <b>where a certain</b> man <b>who said to</b> the agents with whom he entrusted the bill of divorce: <b>If I do not return from now until after thirty days</b> have passed, <b>let this be a bill of divorce. He came at the end of thirty days,</b> before the deadline passed, <b>but was prevented</b> from crossing the river <b>by the ferry</b> that was located on the other side of the river, so he did not come within the designated time. <b>He said to the</b> people across the river: <b>See that I have come, see that I have come. Shmuel said:</b> This <b>is not considered</b> to be <b>a return.</b> Apparently, even if the condition was fulfilled due to circumstances beyond his control, the condition is considered fulfilled.",
            "The Gemara rejects that proof: <b>And perhaps unavoidable circumstances that are common</b> and could be anticipated, e.g., the ferry is located at the other side of the river, <b>are different, since he should have stipulated</b> that exception when establishing the condition, <b>and he did not stipulate</b> it, <b>he brought the failure</b> to arrive <b>upon himself.</b> Although he regrets it now, at the time his intent was that even if the condition were fulfilled due to that circumstance, the divorce would take effect. In contrast, however, if the condition is fulfilled due to an uncommon circumstance that could not have been anticipated, the divorce would not take effect.",
            "<b>Rather, Rava is stating</b> a <i>halakha</i> based on <b>his own reasoning.</b> Circumstances beyond one’s control are not a factor in determining whether or not a condition is fulfilled, and this is <b>due to virtuous women and due to licentious women.</b> The Gemara articulates: There is concern <b>due to virtuous women</b>, <b>as, if you said: Let it not be a bill of divorce,</b> if the reason that the condition was not fulfilled was due to circumstances beyond his control,"
        ],
        [
            "then <b>sometimes, where he was not</b> detained <b>unavoidably</b> but he fulfilled the condition willingly to effect the divorce, <b>and</b> the wife <b>thinks</b> that he was detained <b>unavoidably, she will sit deserted,</b> forever unable to remarry. <b>And</b> the concern <b>due to licentious women</b> is, <b>as, if you said: Let it not be a bill of divorce,</b> then <b>sometimes, when he was</b> detained <b>unavoidably and she thinks</b> that he was <b>not</b> detained <b>unavoidably,</b> she goes <b>and remarries. And</b> the result will be <b>that the bill of divorce is void, and her children</b> from the second marriage will be <b><i>mamzerim</i>,</b> products of an adulterous relationship.",
            "The Gemara questions the following premise: By Torah law, a condition that is unfulfilled due to circumstances beyond one’s control is considered fulfilled, and it is merely by rabbinic ordinance that it is deemed unfulfilled: <b>And is there a matter where by Torah</b> law <b>it is not a bill of divorce, but due to virtuous women and due to licentious women we permit a married woman to others?</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> it is within the authority of the Sages to institute an ordinance freeing the woman from the marriage, as <b>anyone who betroths</b> a woman, <b>betroths</b> her contingent <b>upon the agreement of the Sages,</b> and in certain cases, such as those mentioned above, <b>the Sages invalidated his betrothal</b> retroactively.",
            "<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi:</b> That <b>works out well</b> if <b>he betrothed</b> her <b>with money,</b> as in that case, the courts could declare the money ownerless, and one cannot betroth a woman with money that is not his. However, if <b>he betrothed</b> her <b>with intercourse, what can be said?</b> Rav Ashi answered: <b>The Sages rendered his intercourse licentious intercourse.</b>",
            "<b>Some say,</b> to the contrary, that <b>Rava said:</b> Just as with regard to postponement of a wedding due to circumstances beyond his control, the groom is not obligated to provide sustenance for his betrothed, <b>the same is true with regard to the matter of bills of divorce.</b> The Gemara concludes that <b>apparently Rava maintains: Unavoidable circumstances</b> have legal standing <b>with regard to bills of divorce.</b>",
            "<b>The Gemara raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 76b): With regard to one who said to his wife: <b>This is your bill of divorce if I do not return from now until</b> the conclusion of <b>twelve months, and he died within</b> those <b>twelve months,</b> the document <b>is not a bill of divorce.</b> The Gemara infers: If <b>he died,</b> that <b>is when it is not a bill of divorce,</b> since a divorce cannot take effect posthumously. However, in cases involving other circumstances beyond his control, e.g., if <b>he fell ill</b> and therefore did not return, <b>it is a bill of divorce</b> and it does take effect.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Actually, I will say to you</b> that in the case where <b>one falls ill it is also not a bill of divorce,</b> and death is merely an example of circumstances beyond one’s control. <b>And</b> the fact that the mishna cited <b>that</b> example <b>itself teaches us that there is no bill of divorce posthumously.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: Does it come to teach that <b>there is no bill of divorce posthumously? Wasn’t it already taught in the first clause</b> of that mishna? The Gemara answers: <b>Perhaps</b> it was necessary for the first clause to mention specifically the case of death, <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of our Rabbis.</b>",
            "<b>Come and hear</b> an additional proof from the latter clause of that mishna: If one said: This is your bill of divorce <b>from now if I have not returned from now until</b> the conclusion of <b>twelve months, and he died within</b> those <b>twelve months,</b> then <b>this</b> document <b>is a bill of divorce. What, is it not that the same is true</b> if his failure to return is due to the fact that <b>he fell ill?</b> The Gemara rejects that proof. The divorce takes effect <b>specifically</b> in the case where <b>he died,</b> and he wrote the bill of divorce because <b>he was not amenable</b> to have his wife <b>happen before</b> her <b><i>yavam</i>,</b> his brother, for levirate marriage if he had no children. However, in cases where that is not a consideration, if other circumstances beyond his control caused the condition to be fulfilled, his intention is that the bill of divorce will not take effect.",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>Prior to</b> the institution of <b>the ordinance of Ezra? What was</b> in the past <b>was</b> in the past. There are no halakhic ramifications to that statement.

            "The Gemara elaborates: <b>What is</b> the <b>danger</b> mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>? <b>If we say</b> it is referring to a situation where the government <b>said that a virgin who is married on Wednesday will be executed,</b> would the response be merely <b>that they adopted the custom</b> to marry on Tuesday? <b>Let them</b> totally <b>abolish</b> the ordinance to marry on Wednesday in the face of life-threatening danger.",

It is coercion.</b> The Gemara answers: There is also danger involved, <b>as there are virtuous women who give their lives</b> rather than allow themselves to be violated, <b>and they will come to</b> mortal <b>danger.</b>",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And let</b> the Sages completely <b>abolish</b> the ordinance to marry on Wednesday and establish marriage on a different day.

The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> what is accomplished by moving the marriage to Tuesday? The prefect <b>will come on Tuesday too,</b> to violate them.

            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And on Monday one may not marry</b> even in time of danger. <b>However, if it is due to the coercion, it is permitted.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <b>coercion</b> mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>? <b>If we say it is referring to that which we mentioned</b> with regard to the decree of <i>prima nocta</i> it is difficult, as <b>there</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>calls it danger, and here he calls it coercion.

            "<b>Alternatively,</b> that day was established as the day for a widow to engage in sexual relations <b>due to</b> the fact that the Sages <b>were assiduous</b> in seeing to the well-being of Jewish women, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Why did</b> the Sages <b>say that a widow is married on Thursday and engages in intercourse on Friday?</b> It is <b>because if you say that she should engage in intercourse on Thursday, on the next day</b> the groom will <b>go to</b> ply <b>his craft early</b> and leave his wife alone.

Splendor is antithetical to mourning. If a mourner, who is clearly pained and preoccupied, is obligated to recite <i>Shema</i>, then certainly all others who are preoccupied due to events that transpired in the past should be obligated.

            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And furthermore, Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says in the name of Rabbi Meir, and likewise, Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya would say in accordance with his statement: Who is the widow</b> whose late husband was a member <b>of a</b> priestly <b>family of questionable lineage?</b> It is a widow who marries into <b>any</b> family in <b>which</b> a person with regard to whom there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether or not he is a <b><i>ḥalal</i> was assimilated.</b> Because <b>Jews identify the <i>mamzerim</i> that are among them</b> there is no concern that they will assimilate into families of unflawed lineage, <b>but</b> Jews <b>do not identify the <i>ḥalalin</i> among them.</b> Due to the concern that a <i>ḥalal</i> assimilated into the family, the widow is unfit to marry a priest. The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t you say</b> in <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> that if there is uncertainty whether or not a <b><i>ḥalal</i></b> was assimilated among its members, her marriage to a priest is deemed <b>fit?</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The case of one who when called <b><i>mamzer</i> screams</b> and protests that he is being slandered, <b>and</b> when called <b><i>ḥalal</i> is silent, is</b> the subject of the dispute <b>between</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> in the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The first <i>tanna</i> holds: Anyone who</b> when others <b>call him unfit and he is silent, is unfit,</b> as his silence confirms the allegation. <b>And this is what the first <i>tanna</i> is saying: Who is the widow</b> whose late husband was a member <b>of a</b> priestly <b>family of questionable lineage,</b> who is fit to marry a priest?

            "<b>And Rabbi Meir is saying to him:</b> Specifically, each of <b>those</b> silent in response to allegations of <i>mamzer</i> or Gibeonite status or allegations that they are slaves of kings are rendered unfit <b>because these</b> allegations <b>render him unfit</b> to marry <b>into the congregation</b> of Israel. <b>However,</b> despite <b>silence</b> in response to allegations of <b><i>ḥalal</i></b> status, her marriage to a priest is deemed <b>fit.

The Gemara answers: The Sages require two majorities only in cases such as establishing the identity of the child’s father, because they <b>established a higher standard with regard to</b> matters of <b>lineage.</b> However, in other cases, e.g., concerning kosher meat, a single majority is sufficient.",

Rabbi Zeira learns that <i>halakha</i> from this case of leniency.",
            "After citing a tannaitic source for Rabbi Zeira’s opinion, the Gemara asks: <b>And from where in the Torah do we</b> derive that the legal status of any item fixed in its place is like that of an uncertainty that is equally balanced, both when it leads to leniency and when it leads to stringency? It is derived from <b>the verse</b> that <b>states</b> with regard to a murderer: <b>“And lie in wait for him, and rise up against him”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:11), indicating that one is liable <b>only</b> in a case <b>where he intends to</b> kill <b>him.</b> One who intended to kill one person and inadvertently killed another is exempt from punishment. <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold that one is liable in that case, interpret that verse? The Sages <b>of the school of Rabbi Yannai say:</b> It <b>excludes</b> the case <b>of</b> one who <b>throws a stone into a crowd</b> and did not intend to kill a specific person.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of the case where he threw the stone and is exempt? <b>If we say that there are nine gentiles</b> in the crowd <b>and one Jew among them,</b> even without the verse, <b>let him derive</b> the exemption from the fact <b>that they are a majority of gentiles.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the verse is <b>necessary</b> only in a case where <b>there are nine Jews and one gentile among them.</b> Were the ruling to follow the majority the one who threw the stone would be liable. But in that case, <b>because the gentile is fixed</b> among them, <b>and</b> the legal status of <b>any</b> item <b>fixed</b> in its place is <b>like</b> that of an uncertainty that is <b>equally balanced,</b> he is exempt, based on the principle: In a case of uncertainty concerning a life-threatening situation, the <i>halakha</i> is lenient.

            "The Gemara rejects that proof: <b>Do you think that</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua is</b> in reference <b>to</b> a mishna in <b>this chapter?</b> Actually, <b>it is</b> in reference <b>to</b> the principle of <b><i>miggo</i>, and it is</b> in reference <b>to the first chapter.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua is saying that although he does not accept the claim supported by a <i>miggo</i> in the first chapter, here he accepts the claim supported by the principle: The mouth that prohibited is the mouth that permitted, which is based on the same reasoning as <i>miggo</i>, i.e., the fact that he could have made a more advantageous claim lends credibility to the less advantageous claim. In this case, he could have remained silent and the field would have remained in his possession. If challenged, he could have claimed that the field was his. Therefore, his less advantageous claim, that the field was not originally his but he purchased it from the father of the claimant, is accepted.",
            "The Gemara elaborates: In reference <b>to which</b> case in the first chapter did Rabbi Yehoshua make his statement? <b>If you say</b> that it is in reference <b>to this</b> case (13a): <b>If</b> a single woman <b>was pregnant, and</b> people <b>said to her: What is the nature of that fetus, and she says to them: It is from a man</b> called <b>so-and-so and he is a priest, Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Eliezer say: She is deemed credible, and Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> It is <b>not</b> based on the statement emerging <b>from her mouth</b> that <b>we conduct our lives. There, what <i>miggo</i> is there</b> lending credibility to her claim? In that case, <b>her belly is between her teeth,</b> i.e., her pregnancy is conspicuous, and consequently she does not have the option of making the more advantageous claim that she did not engage in intercourse.",

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Granted, with regard to</b> the case where the field belonged to <b>his father,</b> a circumstance can <b>be found</b> where there is uncertainty with regard to the presumptive ownership of the field, <b>where</b> the one in possession of the field <b>consumed</b> its produce for <b>two</b> of the three years necessary to establish presumptive ownership <b>during the lifetime of the father</b> and <b>one</b> year <b>during the lifetime of the son</b> after the death of his father. <b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna, as Rav Huna said: One cannot establish presumptive ownership of the property of a minor, even</b> after <b>he reached majority.</b> This is because the minor is unaware of the property owned by his father; the fact that he did not challenge the claim of the one in possession of the field proves nothing. Therefore, only two of the three years necessary to establish presumptive ownership have passed.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> since the mishna can be explained only in the case delineated by Rav Huna, <b>did Rav Huna come to teach us a mishna?</b> There is no need for an <i>amora</i> to teach matters that appear in a mishna, as the content of <i>mishnayot</i> is known by all. The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that <b>Rav Huna is stating the inference from the mishna,</b> as the circumstances are not written explicitly in the mishna. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead <b>that he is teaching us</b> that even if during the year after the father died his son was no longer a minor, one may not establish presumptive ownership of the property of a minor, <b>even</b> after <b>he reached majority.</b> From the mishna, one could learn only a case where during the third year the son was still a minor.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>in</b> a case where the one in possession of the field says that he purchased the field from the claimant <b>himself. And let him establish</b> the mishna in a case <b>where</b> the one in possession of the field <b>consumed</b> its produce <b>in the presence</b> of the claimant, who was the original owner of the field, for <b>two</b> of the three years necessary to establish presumptive ownership, <b>and</b> consumed its produce not <b>in his presence</b> for <b>one</b> year. <b>And</b> that scenario is in a case <b>where</b> the claimant <b>fled</b> and therefore, the fact that he did not challenge the claim of the one in possession of the field proves nothing.",
            "The Gemara asks: That scenario is referring to one who <b>fled due to what</b> reason? <b>If</b> it is <b>that he fled due to</b> the fact that his <b>life</b> was in jeopardy, it is <b>obvious that</b> the one claiming presumptive ownership <b>is not deemed credible, since</b> the owner of the field <b>is unable to protest,</b> as he fears for his life. <b>And if he fled due to money</b> that he owes, and that is why he does not return to protest the possessor’s occupation of the field, <b>he ought to protest</b> from afar, <b>as we maintain that a protest</b> lodged <b>not in the presence of</b> the one using the field <b>is a</b> legitimate <b>protest.</b> He could have lodged in a court in his place of exile his protest against the illegal occupation of his field.",
            "This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Batra</i> 38a): There are <b>three</b> independent <b>lands</b> in Eretz Yisrael with regard to establishing <b>presumptive ownership: Judea, Transjordan, and the Galilee.</b> If the original owner of the field <b>was in Judea</b> and another <b>occupied</b> his field <b>in the Galilee,</b> or if he was <b>in the Galilee</b> and another <b>occupied</b> his field <b>in Judea,</b> that does <b>not</b> establish <b>presumptive ownership, until</b> the one occupying the field <b>will be with</b> the original owner <b>in the same country.</b>",

Therefore, although no protest was received from the original owner, the occupier does not establish presumptive ownership of the field, because the lack of protest can be attributed to the perilous situation.",

The Gemara answers: <b>The same is true</b> that she is forbidden to her husband even <b>if she was imprisoned, and</b> the reason that the <i>tanna’im</i> testified about a case where she was taken as security is because <b>the incident that transpired, transpired</b> in <b>that</b> manner.",

However, if they <b>both</b> came to ask <b>at the same time, they are</b> both <b>ritually impure.</b> Since one of the two certainly passed on the impure path, although it is uncertain which, both are deemed impure due to that uncertainty. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: One way or another they are</b> both <b>ritually impure.</b>",
            "<b>And Rava said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> who elaborates: If they came <b>at the same time, everyone agrees</b> that <b>they are ritually impure,</b> as even Rabbi Yehuda concedes that this is the <i>halakha</i>.

The Gemara concludes the analogy: <b>And here too,</b> where there was room in the hideout for only one woman, although they came and asked individually, <b>since they</b> seek to render <b>all</b> the women married to priests <b>permitted</b> to their husbands based on that hideout, <b>it is tantamount to</b> asking about them all <b>at the same time,</b> and they should be deemed forbidden to their husbands.",

Therefore, with regard to the woman taken captive as well, the testimony of the maidservant is not accepted to establish that she was not defiled. <b>Rav Pappi</b> resolved the contradiction and <b>said: With regard to a captive woman,</b> the Sages <b>ruled leniently.</b> Because the prohibition against intercourse with a captive woman is based on the concern that she was violated, the Sages relied on the testimony of her personal maidservant.",

If Rabbi Akiva rules that betrothal does not take effect when a positive mitzva is violated, <b>what is different</b> about this case? The Gemara answers: It is different <b>because it is a positive</b> mitzva <b>whose</b> application <b>is not equal for all.</b> There are two lenient aspects to this mitzva: It is a positive mitzva and not a prohibition, and it applies only to the High Priest and not to all Jews. Even Rabbi Yeshevav would agree that according to Rabbi Akiva, a child born from relations between a High Priest and a non-virgin is not a <i>mamzer</i>.

Rava asked him: <b>And according to your reasoning, that which was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If he forcibly <b>had intercourse</b> with a young woman <b>and she</b> later <b>married,</b> the fine is paid <b>to her,</b> not to her father. There too, ask: <b>Is it written: And he shall give to the father of the young woman who is not married?</b> Even though the verse does not address the moment of payment, if she married the fine is paid to her.",

            "<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava</b> strongly <b>objects to this: The reason is that the Merciful One writes “<i>na’ara</i>”</b> with a <i>heh</i>.

            "The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the proofs cited with regard to this dispute: <b>Damaged; what; and killed; principle.

The mishna characterizes him as sharing in the payments. <b>However, according to he who said</b> that <b>half the damage</b> is payment of <b>a fine,</b> by right, the injured party himself is entitled to nothing. <b>Now,</b> the owner <b>takes</b> half the damage <b>that</b> by right <b>is not his;</b> can <b>he</b> be characterized as sharing <b>in the payments?</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: This <i>halakha</i> is <b>necessary only for the degradation of the carcass.</b> Initially, half the damage is assessed by calculating the difference between the value of a living ox and the value of its carcass when the owner of the ox that gored the other ox stands trial. The degradation in the value of the carcass from when it was gored until the owner is able to sell it is borne by the owner of the carcass. The owner thereby shares in the payment, as he loses that sum. The Gemara asks: <b>We</b> already <b>learned</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the degradation of the carcass</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in <i>Bava Kamma</i> (10b) in which it is taught that the passage in the mishna: I have become liable to pay <b>payments of damage, teaches that the owners tend to the carcass</b> and bear the costs of its degradation.",

The Gemara adds: <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach both <i>halakhot</i>, <b>as if</b> the mishna <b>had taught us</b> only with regard to <b>an innocuous</b> ox, one would understand that its owner is treated with leniency and the owner of the carcass bears the cost of degradation <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the ox <b>has not yet been forewarned; however,</b> with regard to <b>a forewarned</b> ox, <b>that was forewarned, say no,</b> the owner of the carcass does not bear the cost of degradation. <b>And if</b> the mishna <b>had taught us</b> only with regard to <b>a forewarned</b> ox, one would understand that its owner is treated with leniency and the owner of the carcass bears the cost of degradation <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that he pays</b> for the <b>entire damage,</b> and therefore, the relatively insignificant cost of degradation is overlooked. <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>an innocuous</b> ox, <b>say no,</b> since the owner pays only half the damage, he must bear the cost of degradation. Therefore, it was <b>necessary</b> to state the <i>halakha</i> in both cases. Therefore, there is no proof from this mishna whether half the damage is payment of money or payment of a fine.",

If there is only one omission, apparently it was omitted advisedly. The Gemara replies: <b>He omitted</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the <b>half ransom</b> as well. If a forewarned ox killed a person, its owner pays a ransom, and if an innocuous ox killed a person, the owner does not pay even half the ransom. The Gemara rejects this claim: <b>If</b> it is <b>due to</b> the <b>half ransom</b> that the failure to list the difference with regard to payment based on one’s own admission is insignificant, it <b>is not an omission.</b>"

            "Rabba continued: <b>Rather,</b> I will say that the <b>entire</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> one <b>who has stood trial, and</b> as for the difference in <i>halakha</i>, the <b>first clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who deem one liable to bring the offering of an oath in a case where the plaintiff says that the defendant stood trial, was found liable, and swore falsely. <b>And</b> the <b>latter clause</b> represents the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who exempts one who confesses from bringing the offering of an oath.",
            "<b>And I concede to you,</b> Abaye, <b>with regard to</b> the liability to bring <b>an offering</b> for falsely taking <b>an oath</b> on a deposit, <b>that the Merciful One exempts him</b> from this offering here, <b>based upon</b> the verse <b>“And deal falsely</b> with his neighbor in a matter of a deposit,” (Leviticus 5:21), which indicates that one is liable to bring an offering only if he lied about a claim that was originally a monetary obligation.",
            "<b>And when I say</b> that Rabbi Shimon maintains that after one is declared liable in court his obligation to pay <b>is</b> considered a regular <b>monetary</b> payment rather than a fine, that is not to say that he is liable to bring an offering for falsely denying a monetary claim, but rather <b>to</b> say that the recipient of the payment <b>bequeaths it to his sons.</b> Unlike a fine, which does not pass by inheritance to one’s heirs, this is classified as a regular monetary payment. Consequently, if the perpetrator was deemed liable in court and ordered to pay the father of the girl he raped or seduced, and the father died before receiving payment, his sons inherit the right to that payment.",
            "Abaye <b>raised an objection to</b> this last point from the mishna. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: If</b> the daughter <b>did not manage to collect</b> the payments <b>before the father died, they</b> belong <b>to her. And if you say</b> that this fine <b>is a monetary</b> payment <b>to</b> the extent that one can <b>bequeath it to his sons</b> after the trial, <b>why</b> does the money belong <b>to her?</b> Since the trial has taken place, it <b>should be</b> the property of <b>the brothers</b> by inheritance from their father, as it is already considered a regular monetary obligation that is owed to the father.",
            "<b>Rava said: This matter was difficult for Rabba and Rav Yosef</b> for <b>twenty-two years without resolution, until Rav Yosef sat at the head</b> of the academy <b>and resolved it</b> in the following manner: <b>There,</b> in the case of a rape, <b>it is different, as the verse states: “And the man who laid with her shall give the young woman’s father fifty shekels of silver”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:29), from which it is inferred: <b>The Torah entitled the father</b> to this money <b>only from the time of giving.</b> Consequently, if the father dies before receiving the money, he does not bequeath his right to the money to his sons. Instead, the daughter is considered to take her father’s place as the plaintiff, because she was the victim, and the money is paid to her.",
            "<b>And when Rabba said</b> that the fine imposed by a court <b>is</b> considered a regular <b>monetary obligation</b> with regard to one’s ability <b>to bequeath it to his sons,</b> he was not referring to this particular case of a rapist or seducer, but only <b>to other fines,</b> which do have the status of regular monetary obligations after the court delivers its verdict.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> that the verb “give” is explained in this manner, <b>with regard to</b> an ox that killed <b>a slave, where it is written: “He shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver”</b> (Exodus 21:32), <b>so too</b> will you say that <b>the Torah entitled the master only from the time of giving?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>“Shall give [<i>yiten</i>],” is distinct,</b> and <b>“shall give [<i>venatan</i>],” is distinct.</b> The first expression, which is stated with regard to an ox that killed a slave, does not indicate that the recipient acquires the right to the money only from the moment it is given, whereas the formulation employed in the case of rape does indicate that this is the case.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so,</b> that the main source for this <i>halakha</i> is the phrase “shall give [<i>venatan</i>],” when it was taught in the <i>baraita</i> that a man who rapes or seduces a woman is not liable to bring the offering for a false oath in denial of a monetary claim, rather than saying that this is derived from the fact that <b>the verse states “and deal falsely,”</b> he <b>should have</b> said that it is derived from the fact that <b>the verse states “shall give,”</b> as this is the phrase that teaches that the payment is considered a fine even after he has stood trial.",
            "In answer to this question, <b>Rava said: When it was necessary</b> to cite a proof from <b>“and deal falsely,”</b> it was with regard to a situation <b>where</b> the young woman’s case was <b>brought to trial,</b> and the court ruled in her favor, <b>and she reached majority and</b> subsequently <b>died</b> before the money was paid. The reason that “and deal falsely” is necessary in that case is because <b>there, when the father inherits,</b> it is <b>from her</b> that <b>he inherits.</b>",
            "The Gemara raises another difficulty: <b>If so,</b> the language of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Excluding these, as they are a fine,</b> is inaccurate, as <b>it is</b> a regular <b>monetary</b> payment, not a fine. In answer to this question, <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that this phrase means: <b>Excluding these, as they are originally a fine,</b> and it is only once the court orders the man to pay that they are viewed as regular monetary payments.",
            "Abaye <b>raised an objection to</b> this explanation of the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, based upon the mishna in <i>Shevuot</i> cited above (42a), which states: <b>Rabbi Shimon exempts</b> him, <b>as he does not pay a fine on his own</b> admission. The Gemara infers: <b>The reason that</b> he is not liable to bring a guilt-offering is because <b>he has not stood trial.</b> However, if <b>he has stood trial</b> and been found guilty, <b>in which case he pays on his own</b> admission when he later admits that he was already convicted in court, <b>he should also be liable to</b> bring <b>an offering</b> if he denies that he was convicted in court and takes <b>an oath</b> to that effect. This contradicts the claim that, according to Rabbi Shimon, even after one is convicted in court, the payment is still considered a fine.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Shimon stated</b> his opinion <b>to them in accordance with the statement of the Rabbis</b> themselves, as follows: <b>According to my</b> opinion, <b>although he has stood trial, the Merciful One exempts him</b> from the offering, as derived <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“And deal falsely</b> with his neighbor in a matter of a deposit” (Leviticus 5:21), which indicates that he is liable only for a claim that originally concerned a regular monetary payment. <b>However, according to your</b> opinion, you should <b>at least concede to me</b> in a case <b>where he has not stood trial, that when one claims</b> the money, he <b>claims a fine</b> and not a regular monetary payment."

            "<b>And</b> the principle is that <b>one who admits</b> that he is liable to pay <b>a fine is exempt.</b> Since the man would not have been liable to pay even if he had admitted his guilt, his denial of guilt is not considered a denial of monetary liability, and even if he swears falsely that he is not liable, he still does not become liable to bring an offering. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>when</b> the father <b>claims</b> payment in court, it is the compensation for the <b>humiliation and degradation</b> that <b>he claims.</b> His main focus is not on the fine, and therefore the denial refers to a regular monetary claim.",

            "Rabbi Avina explains the sides of the dilemma.

Because <b>there, she is sustained from his</b> own property, and therefore he is entitled to receive her earnings, whereas <b>here, she is not sustained from their</b> possessions but from the estate of their father, and consequently they should not receive her earnings.",
            "Rav Sheshet <b>said to him: You</b> already <b>learned</b> the answer to this dilemma from a mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 81a): <b>A widow is sustained from the property of the orphans, and her earnings are theirs.</b> This indicates that although a widow receives her sustenance from the estate of her deceased husband, in accordance with the stipulations of the marriage contract, the orphans are nevertheless entitled to her earnings. The same reasoning should apply to an orphan sustained by her brothers.",
            "The Gemara refutes this argument: <b>Are</b> the two situations <b>comparable?</b> In the case of <b>his widow,</b> the deceased <b>is not</b> necessarily <b>amenable</b> to <b>her</b> living <b>in comfort.</b> Consequently, she is entitled only to the minimum guaranteed to her in the marriage contract, while her earnings go to his heirs. Conversely, with regard to <b>his daughter, he is amenable</b> and is interested <b>in her</b> living in <b>comfort,</b> and therefore he allows her to retain her earnings so that she can have the extra money.",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the mishna is speaking <b>of</b> one <b>who is not sustained</b> from his estate, <b>what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> this?

It is this surplus that belongs to her, and not to her brothers. <b>Rava said</b> in response to Rabba bar Ulla’s explanation: Is it possible that <b>a man</b> as <b>great as Rav Yosef does not know that there is</b> an explanation according to which the implied case of the mishna is referring to the <b>surplus, and</b> in his ignorance <b>he raises a refutation</b> against Rav Sheshet?

            "The Gemara refutes this suggestion: <b>Was it not stated with regard to</b> this <i>halakha</i> of Rav Naḥman that <b>Rav Pappa said: And Rav Naḥman concedes that if he added</b> so much as <b>a palm tree in</b> the second document, this shows that <b>he wrote it as an addition,</b> and therefore the second document does not cancel the first, but adds to its sum? <b>Here too, he added something for her,</b> as the sum of money specified in the second marriage contract is larger than that specified in the first.",
            "§ Since the Gemara has mentioned the statement of Rav Naḥman, it discusses this matter <b>itself: Rav Naḥman said:</b> With regard to <b>two documents that are produced one after the other,</b> the <b>second nullifies the first. Rav Pappa said: And Rav Naḥman concedes that if he added a palm tree to it, he wrote it as an addition.</b> The Gemara analyzes this <i>halakha</i> in detail. It <b>is obvious</b> that if the <b>first</b> document was a document <b>of a sale, and the second</b> stated that the same field was given <b>as a gift,</b> the second document does not negate the first, as <b>he wrote</b> the additional document of a gift <b>to improve the rights</b> of the recipient <b>due to the <i>halakha</i></b> of <b>one</b> whose field <b>borders</b> the field of his neighbor.",
            "<b>And all the more so,</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> if he wrote the <b>first</b> document <b>as a gift and the second</b> in the form <b>of a sale, as we say</b> it was <b>due to the <i>halakha</i></b> of <b>a creditor that he wrote</b> it in <b>this way.</b> Out of concern that his creditor might come and snatch the field from the recipient and leave him without redress, he writes a document of sale for the recipient, so that he can return and collect this sum from him.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> Rav Naḥman meant that <b>if both of them</b> were documents <b>of sale</b> or <b>both of them</b> were documents <b>of gifts,</b> the <b>second nullifies the first.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? <i>Amora’im</i> argued over this matter. <b>Rafram said: Say</b> that the recipient of the field <b>admitted to him</b> that the first document was invalid, e.g., it was forged, and he therefore wrote a second, valid document. <b>Rav Aḥa said: Say</b> that the recipient <b>forgave him his lien</b> from the date of the first document. Consequently, if the seller’s creditors collect this field as payment for the debt owed to them, which necessitates the seller reimbursing the buyer for the purchase price of the field, the buyer has a lien only on property owned by the seller from the time of the second document.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> these two explanations? The Gemara explains: <b>The</b> practical difference <b>between them</b> involves several cases. First, there is the issue of whether this serves to <b>impair</b> the reliability of the <b>witnesses:</b> According to Rafram, who assumes that the first document was of questionable validity, the witnesses who signed on that document are likewise under suspicion, and therefore their testimony and signature in other cases are of questionable value.",
            "<b>And</b> there is also a difference with regard <b>to paying</b> for the <b>produce</b> of the property between the dates specified in the two documents. According to Rafram, the transfer of ownership did not take place at the date specified in the first document. Consequently, the recipient of the field must compensate the original owner for the field’s produce that he consumed between the two dates. According to Rav Aḥa, the transfer of ownership took place at the time specified in the first document. <b>And</b> finally, there is a difference <b>with regard to</b> the payment of <b>the land tax [<i>taska</i>].</b> If the first document was invalid, the previous owner must pay all taxes due during the period between the two documents.",
            "§ The above discussion came in the wake of the dispute between Rav Huna and Rav Asi with regard to whether the lien on a husband’s property to ensure payment of his wife’s marriage contract applies from the time of betrothal or the time of marriage. The Gemara returns to that issue. <b>What</b> halakhic conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> this matter of <b>a marriage contract?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the following ruling, <b>as Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said in the name of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon:</b> The lien on his property with regard to the <b>one hundred dinars</b> or <b>two hundred</b> dinars that comprise the basic sum of a marriage contract applies <b>from</b> the time of <b>the betrothal, and the</b> lien with regard to the <b>additional</b> sum applies <b>from</b> the time of <b>the marriage.</b>",
            "<b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The lien with regard to <b>both this and that</b> takes effect only <b>from</b> the time of <b>the marriage.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that with regard to <b>both this and that,</b> the lien takes effect <b>from</b> the time of <b>the marriage,</b> in accordance with the majority opinion of the Rabbis.",

            "<b>Rabbi Yosei bar Avin, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Zevida, raised an objection to this</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to a seduced young woman: <b>“If her father utterly refuse [<i>ma’en yima’en</i>]</b> to give her to him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins” (Exodus 22:16).

            "The Gemara digresses to analyze the last clause of this <i>baraita</i>: Can it <b>enter your mind</b> to say that both <b>she and her conspiring witnesses,</b> i.e., witnesses who falsely testified that she committed adultery, are executed? If the witnesses who testified against her were telling the truth and she sinned, only she is liable to be stoned, and if the court discovers that they were false, conspiring witnesses, then they are stoned and she is exempt. <b>Rather,</b> the text of the <i>baraita</i> should be emended so that it reads: <b>Either she or her conspiring witnesses are brought early</b> in the morning <b>to the place of stoning.</b>",

            "<b>Rather, Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> This question of whether the method of her execution <b>changes or does not change</b> if her body has changed <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Horayot</i> 10a), with regard to the special offering of a High Priest or a king who sinned unwittingly (see Leviticus 4:3–12, 22–26): If <b>they sinned before they were appointed, and they were</b> subsequently <b>appointed,</b> and they became aware of their transgression only after their appointment, <b>they are like commoners.</b> They must bring a female sheep or goat, like any ordinary individual who sinned, rather than the bull brought by a High Priest who has sinned or the male goat brought by a king who has sinned.",

The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does one <b>call monetary</b> payment <b>flogging?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, and we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who says: Half my valuation is upon me, he gives half his valuation,</b> in accordance with the sum fixed by the Torah according to sex and age (see Leviticus 27:2–3). <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: He is flogged and gives</b> his <b>full valuation.</b> The Sages inquired: <b>Why is he flogged?</b> What transgression did he commit? <b>Rav Pappa said: He is flogged by</b> having to pay <b>a full valuation.</b> This proves that monetary payment can be referred to as flogging.",
            "The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is the reason</b> of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda? It is a rabbinic <b>decree</b> in the case of one who vows to donate <b>half of his valuation, due to</b> a case where one vowed the <b>valuation of half of himself. And</b> one who vows to donate the <b>valuation of half of himself has</b> effectively vowed to donate the valuation of <b>a limb upon which</b> his <b>life depends,</b> e.g., his head or heart, in which case it is as though he vowed to donate his entire valuation. Consequently, even one who vows to donate half of his valuation must donate his entire valuation.",
            "§ The Gemara continues to discuss the <i>halakhot</i> of the defamer. <b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>, based upon the following verses: “And the Elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him. And they shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver, and give them to the father of the young woman” (Deuteronomy 22:18–19). <b>“And they shall fine [<i>ve’anshu</i>] him”; this</b> is referring to <b>money. “And chastise</b> him”; <b>this</b> is referring to <b>flogging.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> with regard to the phrase <b>“and they fine [<i>ve’anshu</i>] him,”</b> although the word <i>ve’anshu</i> can refer to any punishment, in <b>this</b> case it is referring to <b>money, as it is written: And they shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver, and give them to the father of the young woman. However,</b> with regard to the statement of the <i>baraita</i> that: <b>“And chastise</b> him”; <b>this</b> is referring to <b>flogging, from where do we</b> derive this?",
            "<b>Rabbi Abbahu said: We learned</b> the meaning of the word <b>chastise</b> in the case of a defamer by verbal analogy <b>from</b> the word <b>chastise</b> stated in the verse “if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son [<i>ben</i>], that will not listen to the voice of his father or the voice of his mother, and though they chastise him, will not listen to them” (Deuteronomy 21:18). <b>And</b> the implication of the word <b>chastise</b> in that verse is derived <b>from</b> the word <b>son</b> that appears in the same verse. <b>And</b> the implication of the word <b>son [<i>ben</i>]</b> with regard to a rebellious son is derived <b>from</b> the word <b><i>bin</i></b> in the verse <b>“Then it shall be if the wicked man deserve [<i>bin</i>] to be flogged”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:2).",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive the <b>warning,</b> i.e., the prohibition that serves as the source for the flogging <b>for a defamer? Rabbi Elazar says</b> that the prohibition is derived <b>from</b> the verse <b>“You shall not go up and down as talebearer”</b> (Leviticus 19:16). <b>Rabbi Natan says</b> that it is derived <b>from: “Then you shall keep yourself from every evil thing [<i>davar ra</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:10), which is expounded to mean <i>dibbur ra</i>, evil speech.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar did not state</b> that it is derived from <b>this</b> verse quoted by Rabbi Natan? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires that</b> verse <b>for</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Pineḥas ben Yair,</b> as it was taught: <b>“Then you shall keep yourself from every evil thing”; from here Rabbi Pineḥas ben Yair said: A person should not think</b> impure thoughts <b>by day and</b> thereby <b>come by night to</b> the <b>impurity</b> of an emission.",
            "The Gemara asks the reverse question: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>Rabbi Natan did not state</b> that it is derived <b>from that</b> verse cited by Rabbi Elazar? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Natan explains <b>that</b> verse, which includes the term talebearer [<i>rakhil</i>], as <b>a warning to the court that it should not be soft to [<i>rakh la</i>] this</b> litigant <b>and harsh to that</b> one, but it must treat both sides as equals.",
            "§ The Gemara cites another statement that deals with a defamer: If the husband <b>did not say to witnesses: Come and testify for me</b> that my wife committed adultery, <b>but they testify</b> for <b>him of their own accord</b> and are subsequently discovered to be liars, the husband <b>is not flogged and does not give</b> the <b>one hundred <i>sela</i>,</b> as he did not harm her. <b>She and her conspiring witnesses are brought early to the place of stoning.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Does it enter your mind</b> to say that <b>she and her conspiring witnesses</b> are stoned? If she is liable to be stoned, they are not conspiring witnesses, and conversely, if they are conspiring witnesses, they are stoned and she is exempt. <b>Rather,</b> this must mean: <b>Either she or her conspiring witnesses are brought early to the place of stoning.</b> If they were telling the truth, she is stoned. If they conspired and offered false testimony, they are liable to be stoned.",
            "The Gemara infers from the <i>baraita</i> that the <b>reason</b> the husband is not flogged or fined is <b>that</b> the husband <b>did not tell them</b> to testify, <b>but</b> if <b>he told them</b> to testify, <b>although he did not hire them</b> but merely persuaded them to testify that his wife had committed adultery as a betrothed woman, he is flogged and must pay the fine. This serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The husband <b>is liable</b> to the punishments of a defamer <b>only if he hired witnesses.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> of <b>Rabbi Yehuda?</b> Nowhere does the Torah explicitly state that the husband hired false witnesses. The Gemara answers that <b>Rabbi Abbahu said:</b> It is <b>derived</b> by a verbal analogy between the term <b>placing,</b> written with regard to a defamer, and the term <b>placing,</b> written with regard to the prohibition against charging interest. <b>It is written here,</b> with regard to a defamer: <b>“And he place wanton charges against her”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:14), <b>and it is written there: “Neither shall you place upon him interest”</b> (Exodus 22:24). <b>Just as below,</b> with regard to interest, the verse is referring to <b>money, so too here,</b> in the case of a defamer, it is referring to <b>money,</b> thereby indicating that the husband paid money in order to substantiate his false accusation.",
            "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Rav Yosef Tzidoni likewise taught in the school of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai:</b> It is <b>derived</b> from the verbal analogy between the term <b>placing,</b> written with regard to a defamer, and the term <b>placing,</b> written with regard to the prohibition against charging interest.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raised a dilemma:</b> According to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, if the husband <b>hired</b> the false witnesses <b>with land</b> instead of money, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If he hired them <b>with less than the value of a <i>peruta</i>, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If he hired <b>both</b> witnesses <b>with a <i>peruta</i>, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Since this <i>halakha</i> is derived from the case of interest, perhaps, like the prohibition against charging interest, it applies only with regard to money, rather than land, and only with money that is greater than the value of a <i>peruta</i>.",
            "Similarly, <b>Rav Ashi raised a dilemma</b> concerning a defamer: If <b>he defamed</b> his wife <b>with regard to</b> their <b>first marriage, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? In other words, if a man married a woman, divorced her, remarried her, and subsequently defamed her by claiming that she had committed adultery during the period of betrothal before their first marriage, what is the <i>halakha</i>? Similarly, if he performed levirate marriage and then defamed her <b>with regard to his brother’s marriage</b> to her, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>Resolve at least one</b> of these dilemmas, <b>as Rabbi Yona taught</b> that the verse “And the father of the young woman shall say to the Elders: <b>I gave my daughter to this man”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:16) serves to emphasize: I gave her <b>to this</b> man <b>and not to the <i>yavam</i>,</b> i.e., the brother of the original husband. Consequently, if one defames his <i>yevama</i> with regard to her original marriage to his brother, the unique <i>halakhot</i> of defamation do not apply.",
            "§ In the course of the previous discussion, the Gemara mentioned a dispute between the Rabbis and Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the opinion of <b>the Rabbis and what</b> is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov,</b> referred to above (45b)? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How</b> does the case of <b>defamation</b> proceed? It involves a situation where the husband <b>came to the court and said</b> to the father: <b>So-and-so, I have not found</b> indications of <b>your daughter’s virginity. If there are witnesses</b> who testify <b>that she committed adultery under his</b> authority, i.e., while betrothed to him, <b>she has a marriage contract of one hundred dinars.</b>",
            "The Gemara interrupts its citation of the <i>baraita</i>, as this last statement is very surprising: <b>If there are witnesses</b> who testify <b>that she committed adultery under his</b> authority, does <b>she have a marriage contract of one hundred dinars? She is</b> punished <b>by stoning.</b> The Gemara explains that <b>this is what</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>said: If there are witnesses</b> who testify <b>that she committed adultery under his</b> authority, she is liable <b>to</b> receive the punishment of <b>stoning.</b> However, if <b>she engaged in licentious sexual relations at the outset,</b> before her betrothal, when she was still a single woman, she is merely guilty of deceiving her husband with regard to her virginity, and therefore <b>she has a marriage contract of one hundred dinars,</b> which is the standard marriage contract of a non-virgin.",
            "The Gemara resumes its quotation of the <i>baraita</i>: If it was <b>discovered that the bad name is not a bad name,</b> i.e., the husband’s accusation was false, <b>he is flogged and gives</b> her father <b>one hundred <i>sela</i>, whether he had intercourse with her</b> or <b>whether he had not had intercourse with her. Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: These matters were stated only</b> in a case <b>where he had intercourse</b> with his wife before defaming her. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, this is as it is written:</b> “If a man take a wife <b>and go in unto her”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:13), and: <b>“And when I came near to her,</b> I did not find in her the tokens of virginity” (Deuteronomy 22:14), as both expressions refer to sexual intercourse.",
            "<b>However, according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, what is</b> the meaning of the phrases <b>“and go in unto her,”</b> and <b>“and when I came near to her,”</b> if the couple never engaged in intercourse? The Gemara explains that, according to the Rabbis, <b>“and go in unto her”</b> is referring <b>to</b> the <b>wanton charges</b> the husband leveled against his wife; <b>“and when I came near to her”</b> means that he came near <b>with words,</b> not intercourse.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, this is as it is written: “I did not find in your daughter the tokens of virginity”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:17), as Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov claims that the husband had relations with her and discovered that she was not a virgin. <b>However, according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, what is</b> the meaning of <b>“I did not find in your daughter the tokens of virginity,”</b> if they did not have intercourse? The Gemara answers: The Rabbis explain that he means: <b>I did not find for your daughter the fitness of virginity,</b> i.e., I have discovered that she was unfaithful.",
            "The Gemara asks further: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, this is as it is written</b> that the father replies: <b>“And these are the tokens of my daughter’s virginity”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:17). He presents a cloth that proves she was a virgin, in opposition to the husband’s claim. <b>However, according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, what is</b> the meaning of <b>“And these are the tokens of my daughter’s virginity”?</b> The Rabbis answer that the father means: <b>And these are the</b> proofs of the <b>fitness of my daughter’s virginity,</b> i.e., he either brings witnesses to counter the testimony of the husband’s witnesses or provides some other proof that his daughter was a virgin at the time of her marriage.",
            "The Gemara poses yet another question on the same lines: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, this is at it is written: “And they shall spread the garment”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:17). The father brings the sheet on which the couple had intercourse and shows that it is stained with blood. <b>However, according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who claim that a husband can defame his wife even if they have not engaged in intercourse, <b>what is</b> the meaning of the phrase <b>“And they shall spread the garment [<i>hasimla</i>]”?</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that the Rabbis interpret this expression as follows: <b>They shall spread,</b> i.e., examine, <b>that which he placed against her [<i>sam la</i>].</b> In other words, they cross-examine the witnesses who testified against her, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And they shall spread the garment”;</b> this <b>teaches that the witnesses of this</b> husband <b>come</b> forward, <b>and</b> likewise <b>the witnesses of that</b> father come forward, <b>and</b> the court <b>clarifies the matter like a new garment. Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: The matters</b> are <b>as they are written,</b> i.e., the verse refers to <b>an actual cloth.</b>",
            "§ <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Rav Ya’akov bar Giyyorei sent</b> a message from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Although we have not found in the entire Torah that</b> any <b>verse distinguishes between sexual intercourse in a typical manner and sexual intercourse in an atypical manner,</b> i.e., anal intercourse, <b>with regard to flogging or</b> any other <b>punishment. However,</b> in the case of the <b>defamer,</b> the Torah <b>does distinguish</b> in this manner, as the husband <b>is obligated</b> to pay the fine <b>only</b> if <b>he had intercourse</b> with his wife, even it was <b>in an atypical manner, and</b> he <b>defames</b> her by claiming that she had previously had intercourse <b>in a typical manner</b> with someone else.",
            "The Gemara asks: In <b>accordance with whose</b> opinion is this ruling of Rabbi Yoḥanan? <b>If</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> the husband should be liable <b>even if he did not have intercourse</b> with his wife. <b>If</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov,</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>we require both this,</b> i.e., the act of intercourse between the husband and wife, <b>and that,</b> i.e., the woman’s alleged act of intercourse with another man, to be performed in <b>a typical</b> manner in order for the laws of a defamer to apply, as Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov interprets the verses literally, meaning that the husband had intercourse with her and discovered she was not a virgin. <b>Rather, Rav Kahana sent</b> word <b>in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> that the statement was as follows: <b>He is obligated</b> to pay the fine <b>only if he had intercourse</b> in <b>a typical</b> manner <b>and defamed</b> her with regard to intercourse performed in <b>a typical</b> manner, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A father has authority</b> over <b>his daughter</b> with regard to <b>her betrothal through money, through</b> a marriage <b>document, or through intercourse.</b> Likewise, a father <b>is entitled to items she</b> has <b>found, and to her earnings, and to</b> effect <b>the nullification of her vows,</b> i.e., a father may nullify his daughter’s vows. <b>And he accepts her bill of divorce</b> on her behalf if she is divorced from betrothal before she becomes a grown woman. <b>And</b> although he inherits her property when she dies, e.g., property she inherited from her mother’s family, <b>he does not consume the produce</b> of her property <b>during her lifetime.</b>",
            "If the daughter <b>married, the husband has more</b> rights and obligations <b>than</b> her father had before the marriage, <b>as he consumes the produce</b> of her property <b>during her lifetime, and he is obligated</b> to provide <b>her sustenance, her redemption</b> if she is captured, <b>and her burial</b> upon her death. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even the poorest</b> man <b>of the Jewish people may not</b> provide <b>fewer than two flutes and a lamenting woman,</b> which it was customary to hire for a funeral, as these too are included in the duties of burial.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna indicates that a father receives the money of his daughter’s betrothal. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that the father is entitled to the <b>money</b> of her betrothal? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>the verse states,</b> with regard to an emancipated Hebrew maidservant: <b>“Then she shall go out for nothing, without money”</b> (Exodus 21:11), from which it is inferred: <b>There is no money for this master,</b> i.e., her master does not receive money when she leaves him, <b>but there is money for a different master, and who is</b> this? <b>Her father,</b> who also had authority over her, like her master. When she leaves her father’s jurisdiction via betrothal, he is entitled to the betrothal money.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that the betrothal money should go <b>to her,</b> as one can derive from the verse that there is no money for this master but there is money for the woman herself when she leaves her father’s domain. The Gemara refutes this suggestion: <b>Now</b> consider, <b>her father accepts her betrothal,</b> i.e., he can accept the money or document of betrothal from the man of his choice, <b>as it is written: “I gave my daughter to this man”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:16). Can one then say that <b>she takes the money</b> when her father accepts the betrothal on her behalf?",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that <b>this applies</b> only to <b>a minor, who does not have a hand,</b> i.e., she is not legally competent to carry out transactions on her own behalf. <b>However,</b> in the case of <b>a young woman, who does have a hand, she should betroth herself and she should</b> also <b>take</b> her own betrothal <b>money.</b> The Gemara answers that there is a different exposition in this regard, as <b>the verse states: “Being in her youth, in her father’s house”</b> (Numbers 30:17), which teaches that <b>all gains</b> that a daughter accrues in her <b>youth,</b> i.e., when she is a young woman, belong <b>to her father.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> consider <b>that which Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the earnings of a daughter</b> belong <b>to her father?</b> It is <b>as it is stated: “And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant”</b> (Exodus 21:7); <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>a maidservant, her earnings</b> belong <b>to her master, so too</b> with regard to <b>a daughter, her earnings</b> belong <b>to her father.

            "<b>And if you would say: Let us derive from here</b> that just as she is under her father’s authority with regard to vows, the same applies to monetary matters, this is not possible, because there is a principle that <b>we do not derive monetary matters from ritual matters,</b> as these are two separate areas of <i>halakha</i>. <b>And if you would say: Let us derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the <b>fine</b> paid by the rapist of a young woman, which the Torah explicitly states goes to her father (Deuteronomy 22:29), there is another principle, that <b>we do not derive monetary matters from fines.</b> Each fine imposed by the Torah is a novel law, from which nothing can be learned with regard to other monetary liabilities.",
            "<b>And if you would say: Let us derive</b> it <b>from</b> the compensation paid by a rapist for his victim’s <b>humiliation and degradation,</b> which is also paid to her father, the compensation for <b>humiliation and degradation is different, as her father also has a share in it,</b> because he too is humiliated and harmed by this unfortunate episode, and therefore one cannot learn the <i>halakhot</i> of other monetary matters from here.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara returns to the previous exposition of the verse: “Then she shall go out for nothing, without money” (Exodus 21:11). As for the question of why she does not receive the money herself, the Gemara explains that <b>it is reasonable</b> to assume <b>that when the Merciful One excludes</b> a case by means of this verse, <b>He excludes</b> a case where a girl <b>leaves</b> someone’s authority <b>in the corresponding</b> situation to the case of the Hebrew maidservant.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But this leaving</b> of her father’s authority <b>is not comparable to that leaving</b> of her master’s authority: <b>There, with regard to a master,</b> when he frees her <b>she leaves his authority entirely,</b> whereas in the case of a girl who <b>goes out</b> from the jurisdiction <b>of</b> her <b>father,</b> she <b>still lacks</b> the process of being <b>brought to the wedding canopy.</b> As long as she is not fully married she remains partially under her father’s authority, as he is her heir and has rights to her earnings.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>From</b> the perspective of her father’s right to effect the <b>nullification of</b> her <b>vows, at least, she has left his domain</b> via betrothal, as he no longer maintains exclusive rights to nullify her vows. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nedarim</i> 66b): With regard to <b>a betrothed young woman, her father and her husband nullify her vows</b> together. Since her father cannot nullify her vows on his own, the two types of leaving are indeed comparable.",
            "§ The mishna taught that a father is entitled to accept betrothal of his daughter through a marriage <b>document or</b> through <b>intercourse.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this?

            "§ The mishna further taught that if the daughter <b>married, the husband has more</b> rights <b>than</b> her father, <b>as he consumes</b> the produce of her property. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If the father <b>wrote for her</b> in her marriage contract that he was providing <b>produce, clothing, and vessels that would come with her</b> as a dowry <b>from her father’s house to her husband’s house,</b> and <b>she died</b> during the betrothal period, <b>the husband does not have the right to these objects.

            "The Gemara refutes this suggestion: <b>No, everyone agrees</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya,</b> and the explanation is as follows: <b>The one who said</b> that he does <b>not have the right</b> to the dowry clearly holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya,</b> as stated above; <b>and the one who says</b> the husband does <b>have the right</b> to her dowry would distinguish between the two cases: <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya states</b> that the marriage contract is not fully in effect until marriage <b>only with regard to</b> a bestowal <b>from him to her,</b> i.e., the extra sum that the husband adds to her marriage contract, <b>as he wrote</b> it <b>for her only on the condition</b> that he would <b>marry her,</b> and he did not intend to give her anything before she became his wife.",

            "The Gemara further relates: <b>When</b> an incident of this kind <b>would come before Rava, he</b> would <b>say to</b> the father: Is it <b>satisfactory to you that your sons are sustained through charity?</b> All these incidents prove that the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with the enactment of Usha; although these Sages stated forcefully that it is proper for a father to support his children, they did not force him to do so by the authority of the court.",

The same reasoning certainly applies to a man’s own children.",
            "§ <b>Rabbi Ile’a said</b> that <b>Reish Lakish said: In Usha</b> the Sages <b>instituted</b> that in a case of <b>one who writes</b> a document stating that he is giving <b>all his property</b> as a gift <b>to his sons</b> in his lifetime, <b>he and his wife are sustained from</b> the property until their deaths.",
            "<b>Rabbi Zeira objects to this, and some say</b> this objection was raised by <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani:</b> What is the significance of this ruling? After all, the Sages <b>said a greater</b> novelty <b>than that:</b> A man’s <b>widow is sustained from his property</b> even if his estate was inherited by his daughter and therefore belongs to her husband. Although the property is comparable to property from the estate that was sold to a third party, from which a widow is not entitled to claim her sustenance, in this case the Sages decreed that she can claim her livelihood from her late husband’s estate to prevent her from losing out entirely. With this in mind, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to state that <b>he and his wife,</b> during his lifetime, receive their sustenance from property he gave as a gift to his sons?",
            "The Gemara provides the background for this ruling: <b>As Ravin sent in his letter</b> to Babylonia: With regard to <b>one who died and left a widow and a daughter, his widow is sustained from his property,</b> as this is a stipulation of the marriage contract. If <b>the daughter,</b> who is her father’s heir, <b>married,</b> the estate is considered usufruct property whose produce belongs to her husband, but even so <b>his widow is sustained from his property.</b>",

            "The Gemara responds: The ordinance is necessary <b>lest you say</b> that <b>it is</b> in that case <b>there,</b> with regard to a widow, that they instituted this <i>halakha</i>, <b>as there is no one to toil</b> on her behalf, since she is by herself, <b>but here,</b> where the husband is alive, <b>he can toil for himself and for her,</b> i.e., his wife. The ordinance of Usha therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the court does not force him to do so, and they may claim their sustenance from his former property.",
            "<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the scholars: Is <b>the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with</b> the opinion of Rabbi Ile’a, <b>or is the <i>halakha</i> not in accordance with his</b> opinion?

            "§ Apropos the ordinances instituted by the Sages in Usha, the Gemara cites another one. <b>Rabbi Ile’a said: In Usha</b> the Sages <b>instituted</b> that <b>one who dispenses</b> his money to charity <b>should not dispense more than one-fifth.

The double use of the verb that means to donate one-tenth indicates that Jacob, who issued this statement, was actually referring to two-tenths, i.e., one-fifth.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But the latter tenth is not similar to the first tenth,</b> as it would be one-tenth of what remained after the first tenth had been removed. Consequently, the two-tenths would not equal one-fifth of the original total. The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> Since the verse could have said: I will surely give one-tenth [<i>aser a’aser</i>], and instead stated: <b>“I will</b> surely give <b>a tenth of it [</b><i>aser <b>a’asrenu</b></i><b>],”</b> it thereby alludes to the fact <b>that the latter</b> tenth is <b>like the first one.</b>",
            "With regard to the above statements concerning the Sages’ ordinances in Usha, <b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi said: And these <i>halakhot</i> continually decrease.</b> The first statement was stated by Rabbi Ile’a, quoting a statement by Reish Lakish in the name of Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina.

Rabbi Shimon ben Elyakim said before him: My teacher, I know about you that you are not acting</b> according to <b>the letter of the law,</b> but <b>rather</b> out of <b>pity</b> for these daughters, who have no other source of support. <b>However,</b> you should still not do this, <b>lest the students observe and</b> mistakenly <b>establish</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> accordingly <b>for</b> future <b>generations.</b>",
            "<b>A certain</b> person <b>came before Rav Yosef</b> to inquire about this matter. Rav Yosef <b>said to</b> the sons of the deceased man: <b>Give</b> the daughter her sustenance <b>from the dates</b> that are laid out to dry <b>on the mats [<i>budya</i>].</b> These fruits are certainly movable property. <b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>If it was a creditor</b> who came to collect a debt, <b>would the Master give him</b> the right to collect it <b>in this</b> manner? Even a creditor, who may collect his claim by repossessing property that the debtor has sold, cannot take movable property from the possession of orphans. A daughter, who cannot collect her sustenance from property that her father sold, should certainly not have the right to collect her sustenance from movable property that belongs to the male orphans.",
            "Rav Yosef <b>said to</b> Abaye: I did not mean actual dates lying on mats; rather, <b>I spoke</b> of ripe dates ready for plucking, <b>which are fit for mats.</b> Since they are still attached to the ground, they are not considered movable property."
        ],
        [
            "Abaye asked him: <b>Ultimately, anything that is about to be sheared is considered sheared,</b> and therefore these dates should already be classified as movable property, from which her sustenance cannot be collected. Rav Yosef replied: <b>I spoke</b> of a case when the fruit is nearly fully ripe, but <b>is still in need of the palm tree.</b> Since they are attached to the ground, they may be used for the daughter’s sustenance.",
            "The Gemara relates: There were <b>a certain</b> minor <b>orphan boy and orphan girl who came before Rava. Rava said to</b> the trustees of the father’s estate: <b>Increase</b> the amount you give <b>to the orphan boy,</b> so that there should be enough <b>for the orphan girl</b> as well. <b>The Sages said to Rava: But it was the Master who said</b> that one may collect <b>from land but not from movable property, whether for sustenance, whether for the marriage contract, or whether for</b> the daughters’ <b>livelihood.</b> In this case only movable property was available.",
            "Rava <b>said to them: If</b> this orphan <b>wanted a maidservant to serve him, would we not give him</b> one? The court would use his father’s property to fund this acquisition. <b>All the more so here, where there are two</b> factors, as she is his sister and she will serve him as well. It is therefore appropriate to act in this manner, which is to the benefit of both the boy and the girl.",
            "§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to <b>both property that has a guarantee,</b> i.e., real estate, <b>and property that does not have a guarantee,</b> i.e., movable objects, the court <b>removes</b> them from the orphan heirs <b>for the sustenance of the wife and for the daughters.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> With regard to <b>property that has a guarantee,</b> the court <b>removes</b> it <b>from</b> the possession of <b>the sons,</b> who are the heirs, <b>for</b> the sake of the sustenance of <b>the daughters.</b> If the deceased had only daughters, and the adult daughters have taken possession of the estate, the court takes some of the property <b>from the</b> adult <b>daughters</b> in order to give an equal share <b>to the</b> young <b>daughters. And</b> likewise, one takes some of the property <b>from the</b> adult <b>sons</b> in order to give an equal share <b>to the</b> younger <b>sons.</b>",
            "<b>And in</b> a case where the estate has <b>a large</b> amount <b>of property,</b> so that there is more than enough to provide sustenance for the daughters, the court takes <b>from the daughters</b> the property that is not needed to provide for their sustenance and gives it <b>to the sons,</b> who are the true heirs. <b>However,</b> in a case where the estate has <b>a small</b> amount of <b>property,</b> one does not take it <b>from the daughters</b> in order to give it <b>to the sons.</b>",
            "By contrast, with regard to <b>property that does not have a guarantee,</b> i.e., movable property, the court <b>removes</b> some of it from the possession of <b>the</b> adult <b>sons,</b> if they have taken it, in order to give a fair share <b>to the</b> young <b>sons, and</b> similarly, some property is taken <b>from the</b> adult <b>daughters</b> in order to give a fair share <b>to the</b> young <b>daughters. And</b> if there are both sons and daughters and the daughters have seized the movable property, it is taken <b>from the daughters,</b> who are not entitled to sustenance from movable property, and given <b>to the sons,</b> who are the heirs. <b>However,</b> they do <b>not</b> take any <b>property from the sons</b> in order to give it <b>to the daughters.</b>",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>Even though we maintain</b> in general that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi in disputes with <b>his colleague,</b> and therefore the <i>halakha</i> should follow his ruling rather than that of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, <b>here the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar.

However, it is possible that they were more stringent in the case of a woman who was definitely raped.",
            "The Gemara further asks: <b>According to Shmuel’s father, how can you find</b> a case of <b>rape where the Merciful One permits</b> the victim to remain married to her husband?

            "<b>When they disagree</b> it is in the case <b>of</b> an Israelite <b>who vows</b> that his wife, i.e., <b>the wife of an Israelite,</b> may not derive benefit from him. <b>Rabbi Eliezer follows</b> the status of the woman <b>at the outset,</b> i.e., when the marriage contract was written. Since at that time he could restore her to be his wife, the obligation he took upon himself to redeem her from captivity remains in effect, despite the fact that he can no longer do so due to the vow. <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua follows</b> the status of the woman <b>at the end,</b> and holds that since, in practice, the husband cannot take her back as a wife because of the vow, he is no longer obligated to ransom her.",
            "Similarly, <b>Rava explains</b> the <i>baraita</i> according <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning:</b> In the case of <b>a widow</b> married <b>to a High Priest,</b> and <b>a <i>mamzeret</i> or a Gibeonite woman</b> married <b>to an Israelite, everyone agrees</b> that he is <b>not obligated to redeem her,</b> as the prohibition against her remaining married to him results from a cause other than her captivity. <b>When they disagree</b> it is with regard to <b>one who vows</b> that his wife may not derive benefit from him, <b>whether</b> she is <b>the wife of a priest or the wife of an Israelite.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Eliezer follows</b> her status <b>at the outset</b> and holds that since he obligated himself to ransom her when he wrote the marriage contract he must act accordingly. <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua follows</b> her status <b>at the end,</b> and holds that since he cannot fulfill his obligation to restore her as his wife due to a factor other than her captivity, he is entirely exempt from redeeming her.",
            "§ The mishna taught that if <b>she was taken captive,</b> her husband <b>is obligated to redeem her. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of a wife who was <b>taken captive in her husband’s lifetime and afterward her husband died</b> before he could redeem her, if <b>her husband was aware of her</b> captivity, the <b>heirs are obligated to redeem her,</b> but <b>if her husband was not aware of her</b> captivity, his <b>heirs are not obligated to redeem her.</b>",
            "The Gemara relates: <b>Levi thought to act in accordance with this <i>baraita</i>.

            "§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> If she was <b>taken captive and they were seeking</b> ransom <b>from</b> her husband of <b>up to ten times her value,</b> i.e., far more than the usual ransom for a captive of this kind, on the <b>first occasion</b> she is taken captive he must <b>redeem</b> her. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward,</b> i.e., if she was taken captive a second time, if he <b>wants</b> to, <b>he redeems</b> her, but if he does not <b>want</b> to redeem her, <b>he does not</b> have to <b>redeem</b> her, as the Sages obligated him to redeem her only once. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b>"

            "<b>One does not redeem captives at more than their value.</b> This policy is <b>for the betterment of the world,</b> because if captives are ransomed at exorbitant prices, this will encourage their captors to kidnap more people.

            "<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a different <i>baraita</i>, which states: If <b>she was taken captive and</b> the captors <b>were seeking from</b> her husband a ransom of <b>up to ten times the value of her marriage contract,</b> on the <b>first occasion</b> he must <b>redeem</b> her. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward,</b> if he <b>wants</b> to <b>he redeems</b> her, but if he does not <b>want</b> to redeem her, <b>he does not</b> have to <b>redeem</b> her. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: If</b> the price of <b>her ransom was equal to her marriage contract he redeems</b> her. <b>If not,</b> i.e., the price of her ransom was greater than the sum of money guaranteed to her in her marriage contract upon divorce or the death of her husband, <b>he does not</b> have to <b>redeem</b> her. He can suffice with paying her marriage contract.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel is of</b> the opinion that there are <b>two leniencies</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of redemption. First, he maintains that one does not pay more than the general ransom given for such a captive, and second, a husband does not have to pay more than the sum of his wife’s marriage contract.",
            "§ The mishna taught (51a) that if a woman <b>was struck</b> with illness, her husband is <b>obligated to heal her,</b> i.e., to pay for her medical expenses. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a widow</b> who <b>is sustained from the property of</b> the <b>orphans and who requires medical treatment,</b> her medical needs <b>are like</b> her <b>sustenance,</b> and the orphans must bear the costs. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> disagrees and <b>says:</b> With regard to <b>treatment that has a fixed</b> cost, she <b>is healed from her marriage contract,</b> i.e., the amount is subtracted from her marriage contract. If it is a treatment <b>that does not have a fixed</b> cost, <b>it is</b> considered <b>like sustenance.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The Sages <b>established</b> that <b>in Eretz Yisrael, bloodletting</b> is considered <b>like a treatment that does not have a fixed</b> cost, and therefore the heirs must pay for that treatment. The Gemara relates: <b>The relatives of Rabbi Yoḥanan had</b> to take care of the <b>wife of their father, who required treatment every day,</b> and therefore her medical expenses were high. <b>They came before Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> to ask him what to do. <b>He said to them: Go</b> and <b>fix</b> a lump <b>sum with the doctor</b> for his services. The treatment would then be considered as having a fixed cost, which is deducted from the marriage contract.",
            "Later <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> in regret: <b>We have made ourselves like legal advisors,</b> who help people with their legal claims. The Gemara asks: <b>At the outset, what did he hold and ultimately, what did he hold?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>At the outset he held</b> that one should act in accordance with the verse <b>“and that you do not hide yourself from your own flesh”</b> (Isaiah 58:7), which indicates that one must help his relatives. <b>And ultimately he held</b> that <b>an important person is different.</b> If a man of stature offers assistance to his family in a manner that causes a loss to another individual, it appears as though he were unfairly favoring his relatives.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If the husband <b>did not write for her</b> in her marriage contract: Any <b>male children you will have from me will inherit the money of your marriage contract in addition to their portion</b> of the inheritance <b>that</b> they receive together <b>with their brothers,</b> he <b>is</b> nevertheless <b>obligated</b> as though he had written it, <b>as it is a stipulation of the court</b> and therefore takes effect even if it is not explicitly stated. Likewise, if he omitted from the marriage contract the sentence: Any <b>female children you will have from me will sit in my house and be sustained from my property until they are taken by men,</b> i.e., until they are married, he <b>is</b> nevertheless <b>obligated</b> as though he had written it, <b>as it</b> too <b>is a stipulation of the court.</b>",
            "Similarly, if he omitted from the marriage contract the clause: <b>You will sit in my house and be sustained from my property all the days you live</b> as <b>a widow in my house,</b> he <b>is</b> nevertheless <b>obligated</b> as though he had written it, <b>as it is a stipulation of the court.</b> The mishna comments: <b>The residents of Jerusalem would write in this manner,</b> that a widow may remain in her husband’s house throughout her widowhood, and <b>the residents of the Galilee would write</b> in this manner as well, <b>like the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</b> In contrast, <b>the residents of Judea would write: Until the heirs want to give you your marriage contract. Consequently, if the heirs wish, they may give her marriage contract to her and release her,</b> and she must find her own living arrangements and provide for herself.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: For what reason did</b> the Sages <b>enact the marriage document concerning male children?</b> It was enacted <b>so that a man will</b> be willing to <b>take the initiative and write</b> an agreement to give <b>his daughter</b> a dowry <b>as</b> large as the portion of his possessions that <b>his son</b> will receive as an inheritance. The marriage document concerning male children ensures that even if one’s daughter dies and her husband inherits her possessions, the dowry will eventually be inherited by her sons when her husband dies. Since the father of the bride knows that his grandchildren will inherit the dowry, he will give a larger dowry.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And is there anything</b> that justifies a situation <b>where the Merciful One says</b> that <b>the son inherits</b> and <b>the daughter does not inherit, and</b> yet <b>the Sages came and enacted that the daughter should inherit?</b> The practical effect of their decree is that daughters receive a significant portion of their father’s estate, just like sons.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>This also</b> applies <b>by Torah</b> law, <b>as it is written: “Take wives for yourselves and bear sons and daughters, and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands”</b> (Jeremiah 29:6). This verse requires clarification. <b>Granted, sons are in his hands,</b> i.e., a father can select wives for them, <b>but daughters, are they in his power</b> that he can select husbands for them? It is not the manner of a woman or her family to court a man.",
            "Rather, the verse <b>teaches us this, that</b> the father <b>should dress her and cover her and give her something,</b> i.e., property, <b>so that</b> men <b>will take the initiative with her and come</b> to <b>marry her.</b> When the verse instructs fathers to marry off their daughters, it means that they must make efforts to ensure this outcome, including bestowing a dowry. The Gemara asks: <b>And up to how much</b> must a father give his daughters? <b>Abaye and Rava both say: Up to one-tenth</b> of one’s <b>property</b> should be handed over to his daughter for her dowry.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if this is the reason for the institution of the marriage document concerning male children, <b>say that</b> it is only the portion <b>the</b> bride’s <b>father</b> gave as a dowry that her sons <b>should inherit,</b> but the money <b>the husband</b> guarantees to pay his wife, they <b>should not inherit.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> the bride’s <b>father will also refrain</b> from <b>writing</b> a large dowry. If his daughter’s sons will not inherit the husband’s portion of the marriage contract, her father will be reluctant to give generously himself.",
            "The Gemara continues to ask: <b>But</b> if the concern is that the father will not give, <b>say</b> that in a case <b>where</b> the <b>father wrote</b> a large dowry for his daughter, <b>let</b> the <b>husband</b> also <b>write</b> the stipulation in the marriage document concerning male children, and <b>when</b> the <b>father did not write</b> a large dowry, <b>let</b> the <b>husband not write</b> this stipulation. The Gemara replies: <b>The Sages did not distinguish</b> between these cases. Although the main purpose of their enactment was to encourage fathers to provide their daughters with generous dowries, the Sages applied their decree equally to all women, even when the father failed to do so.",
            "The Gemara poses another question: If the aim is to ensure that the money of the marriage contract will remain with the woman’s descendants, in a case when one has <b>a daughter</b> from one woman <b>among</b> his <b>sons</b> from another woman, the daughter should <b>likewise inherit</b> her mother’s dowry. Why do only male children inherit their mother’s dowry? The Gemara responds: <b>The Sages established</b> this enactment as <b>similar to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>inheritance:</b> Just as a regular inheritance belongs to sons and not daughters, the same applies to the marriage document concerning male children.",
            "The Gemara continues to inquire: Why shouldn’t one at least say that <b>a daughter among daughters should inherit?</b> If he had a daughter from this wife, and his other children are also daughters, in which case all the daughters divide the inheritance, the daughters of each wife should receive the portion her maternal grandfather gave to her mother. The Gemara again answers: <b>The Sages did not distinguish</b> between these cases when establishing their decree. The Gemara further asks: <b>And let</b> the marriage document concerning male children <b>be collected</b> even <b>from movable property,</b> if that is all the father possesses. The Gemara replies: <b>The Sages established</b> this enactment as <b>similar to</b> a regular <b>marriage contract,</b> which can be collected only from land.",
            "The Gemara poses yet another question: <b>Let it be collected</b> even <b>from liened</b> property, i.e., property the father sold after he wrote the marriage contract. The Gemara answers that <b>we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>Will inherit,</b> and one’s heirs do not inherit property that he has sold. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if this is the reason for this enactment, <b>say</b> that it should apply <b>even though there is no more</b> than <b>a dinar</b> beyond the value of the marriage contract that the father <b>left over</b> in his estate. The Sages stated that if no property is left for the inheritance, all the sons share the inheritance equally, in accordance with Torah law. The Gemara answers: <b>In a case where</b> their decree <b>would</b> entirely <b>uproot</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>inheritance by Torah</b> law, <b>the Sages did not enact</b> the marriage document concerning male children.",
            "The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Pappa,</b> having <b>arranged for his son</b> to marry into <b>the family</b> of <b>Abba of Sura, went</b> to supervise <b>the writing of</b> the bride’s <b>marriage contract. Yehuda bar Mareimar heard</b> that Rav Pappa was coming, and <b>came out</b> to <b>present himself before him,</b> in honor of his arrival. <b>When they came to the entrance</b> of Abba of Sura’s house, Yehuda bar Mareimar <b>took his leave of him,</b> as he did not wish to enter.

        ],
        [
            "Rav Pappa <b>saw that</b> Yehuda bar Mareimar <b>was not amenable</b> to the idea of entering the house. <b>He said to him: What is</b> on <b>your mind?</b> Do you not wish to enter <b>due to that</b> which <b>Shmuel said to Rav Yehuda: <i>Shinnana</i>, do not be</b> a partner <b>in the transfer of an inheritance even from a bad son to a good son, as it is not known what seed will come from him?</b> Perhaps the bad son will father worthy children. <b>And all the more so,</b> one should not be a partner in the transfer of an inheritance <b>from a son to a daughter.</b>",
            "Rav Pappa continued: Are you worried that your arrival will pressure Abba of Sura to give his daughter a more substantial dowry? But <b>this too is an ordinance of the Sages,</b> that a father must provide a dowry for his daughter. This is <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai,</b> as quoted above, that the Sages enacted this matter so that a man should take the initiative and write an agreement to give his daughter a dowry as large as the portion of his possessions that his son will receive as an inheritance. Yehuda bar Mareimar <b>said to him: This applies only</b> if the man gives <b>of his own</b> free <b>will,</b> but should one <b>force him as well?</b> Rav Pappa <b>said to him: Did I say to you that you should enter and force him? I</b> merely <b>said</b> that you should <b>enter, but do not force him. He said to him: My</b> very <b>entrance is</b> an act that will effectively <b>force him,</b> as he will increase her dowry in my honor.",
            "Eventually, Rav Pappa <b>forced</b> Yehuda bar Mareimar <b>and he entered. He was silent, and sat</b> without uttering a word. Abba of Sura <b>thought</b> that Yehuda bar Mareimar <b>was angry</b> with him for his failure to grant his daughter a suitable dowry. <b>He</b> therefore <b>wrote</b> down in the marriage contract <b>all that he had</b> as her dowry, to appease him. <b>Ultimately,</b> when he observed that Yehuda was still silent, Abba of Sura <b>said to him: Even now the Master will not talk? By the Master’s life, I have left nothing for myself.</b>",
            "Yehuda bar Mareimar <b>said to him: If</b> you are acting <b>for my</b> sake, <b>that which you wrote is also not amenable to me.</b> Finally understanding his wishes, Abba of Sura <b>said to</b> Yehuda bar Mareimar: <b>Now too, I will retract,</b> as I acted in error. Yehuda bar Mareimar <b>said to him: I did not speak</b> so that you <b>should turn yourself into</b> the kind of person <b>who retracts</b> once he gives his word. You should uphold your agreement, but the agreement was not to my liking.",
            "§ <b>Rav Yeimar the Elder raised a dilemma before Rav Naḥman:</b> If a wife <b>sold her marriage contract to her husband,</b> i.e., she sold him the right not to have to pay her the marriage contract if they divorce or if she is widowed, does <b>she have the marriage document concerning male children, or</b> does <b>she not have the marriage document concerning male children? Rava said to him: And you can raise</b> the same <b>dilemma</b> with regard to a wife <b>who forgoes</b> her right to her marriage contract. Does she retain the marriage document concerning male children in this case?",
            "Rav Yeimar <b>said to him: Now,</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>one who sells</b> her marriage contract <b>is a dilemma for me. As, although there is</b> room <b>to say</b> that <b>the money forced her,</b> and <b>that I say</b> that she <b>is like one who is struck</b> with <b>a hundred strikes [<i>ukelei</i>] of a hammer [<i>ukela</i>],</b> i.e., she needed liquid assets at the time and therefore she sold her marriage contract unwillingly, even so, I am still willing to entertain the possibility that she has sold the marriage document concerning male children. Then, with regard to <b>one who forgoes</b> her marriage contract, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to raise the dilemma?",
            "<b>Rava said:</b> It <b>is obvious to me</b> that if a wife <b>sells her marriage contract to others,</b> not to her husband but to someone else who is willing to pay at the present time for the chance to collect the money stated in her marriage contract if she is later divorced or widowed, <b>she</b> still <b>has the marriage document concerning male children. What is the reason? The money forced her</b> to sell, and she did not mean to renounce all her rights. It is likewise clear to me that <b>one who forgoes</b> the right to collect <b>her marriage contract</b> from <b>her husband does not have the marriage document concerning male children. What is the reason? She has forgiven it</b> all and has no intention of claiming anything from her husband.",
            "However, <b>Rava raised a dilemma</b> about the following case: With regard to <b>one who sells her marriage contract to her husband,</b> is she <b>considered like one who sells to others,</b> i.e., she has not relinquished the marriage document concerning male children, <b>or is she considered like one who forgoes</b> her right to collect her marriage contract from <b>her husband,</b> i.e., she has forfeited everything? <b>After he raised the dilemma he subsequently resolved it: One who sells her marriage contract to her husband is considered like one who sells to others,</b> as she is assumed to have done so due to financial constraints.",
            "<b>Rav Idi bar Avin raised an objection:</b> We learned in a mishna (<i>Yevamot</i> 87b) that if a woman’s husband went overseas, and after hearing the testimony of one witness that he was dead the woman married again, and then her first husband returned, both husbands must divorce her, and she does not receive payment of her marriage contract from either man. That mishna proceeds to state that if <b>she died, neither</b> the <b>heirs of this</b> one, the first husband, <b>nor</b> the <b>heirs of that</b> one, the second husband, <b>inherit</b> the sum stipulated in <b>her marriage contract. And we discussed</b> the following question: With regard to <b>a marriage contract, what is its purpose?</b> In other words, the mishna just said that she is not entitled to a marriage contract, so how can it even be suggested that the heirs might inherit it?",
            "<b>And Rav Pappa said:</b> This is referring to <b>the marriage document concerning male children.</b> Not only does she forfeit her marriage contract, but she also loses the right to the marriage document concerning male children, as her sons do not inherit from her at all. Rav Idi bar Avin explains his objection. <b>But</b> if, according to the above statement, a wife who sells her marriage contract has not relinquished the marriage document concerning male children, <b>why</b> does the mishna in <i>Yevamot</i> state that none of the woman’s heirs inherit the proceeds of her marriage contract? <b>Here too,</b> in that mishna, <b>let us say</b> that her <b>desire</b> to marry another man <b>forced her</b> to marry her second husband. Why should she forfeit the marriage document concerning male children?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>There it is a penalty</b> with <b>which the Sages penalized her.</b> In other words, the reason is not that she automatically forfeits the marriage document concerning male children, along with the marriage contract itself. Rather, her loss of the marriage document concerning male children is one of several penalties the Sages imposed upon her for remarrying on the basis of the testimony of a single witness without conducting her own thorough investigation into her husband’s fate. Therefore, one cannot learn from that <i>halakha</i> with regard to the issue at hand.",
            "<b>Ravin bar Ḥanina sat before Rav Ḥisda, and he sat and said</b> the following <i>halakha</i> <b>in the name of Rabbi Elazar: One who forgoes her</b> right to collect her <b>marriage contract</b> from <b>her husband does not</b> receive her <b>sustenance</b> from him.

After she relinquishes to her husband her right to her marriage contract, which was a favor to her husband, she loses her sustenance as well.",
            "The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Naḥman was sitting, and Ulla and Avimei bar Rav Pappi</b> were sitting as well, <b>and Rav Ḥiyya bar Ami was sitting with them,</b> when <b>a certain man came</b> before them <b>whose betrothed</b> wife <b>had died.

            "Rav Ḥiyya infers the following from this statement: The <b>reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i> is that <b>he died,</b> from which it may be inferred that if <b>she died she does not have a marriage contract,</b> nor any of the stipulations of a marriage contract. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that her marriage contract is canceled upon her death? <b>Rav Hoshaya said:</b> The reason is <b>that I do not read with regard to her</b> the condition stated in the marriage contract: <b>When you marry another he may take what is written for you,</b> as she cannot marry another.",

The Gemara notes that <b>Rav</b> would <b>teach</b> that the daughters are entitled to sustenance <b>until they are taken</b> as wives <b>by men, and Levi</b> would <b>teach</b> that they are entitled to sustenance <b>until they become grown women.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav,</b> are daughters entitled to sustenance <b>even though they have become grown women,</b> if they are still unmarried?

Rav Yosef <b>said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: As for <b>hearing, I have not heard</b> anything, but <b>by logical</b> reasoning I would say that <b>she does have</b> sustenance from the brothers: <b>Since he is not sure</b> that he will marry <b>her, he will not throw away money for nothing.</b> In response, Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: If you have not heard</b> this <i>halakha</i>, <b>by logical</b> reasoning <b>she</b> should <b>not have</b> sustenance from the inheritance: <b>Since he has betrothed her it is not satisfactory for him that she be demeaned</b> by having to ask the brothers for food, and he would rather provide for her himself.",
            "§ The Gemara states <b>a mnemonic</b> device <b>for</b> the <b>men,</b> i.e., the Sages, who appear in the following discussion: <b><i>Shin</i>, <i>kuf</i>, <i>zayin</i>, <i>reish</i>, <i>peh</i>.</b> This refers to Rav Sheshet, Reish Lakish, Rabbi Elazar, Rava, and Rav Pappa. The dilemmas themselves are listed in the following mnemonic: <b>She refused, and a <i>yevama</i>, a secondary</b> forbidden <b>relationship, a betrothed woman, and a woman who was raped.</b>",
            "The Gemara analyzes these cases one by one: The Sages <b>raised a dilemma before Rav Sheshet:</b> With regard to <b>one who refused,</b> i.e., a minor orphan girl who was married off by her brothers or mother and then refused her husband, thereby nullifying the marriage, does <b>she have sustenance</b> from her father’s inheritance <b>or</b> does <b>she not have sustenance?</b> Is she considered to have been married, and therefore her right to sustenance has lapsed, or does her refusal nullify the marriage to the extent that it is as though she were never married at all, and therefore she is still entitled to sustenance?",
            "<b>Rav Sheshet said to them: You learned it</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a widow in her father’s house, or a divorcée in her father’s house, or a widow awaiting her <i>yavam</i> in her father’s house, she has sustenance. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If <b>she is still in her father’s house she has sustenance;</b> if <b>she is not in her father’s house she does not have sustenance.</b>",
            "Rav Sheshet analyzes this <i>baraita</i>: The opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda is</b> to all appearances the same as that of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>.</b> What is their dispute? <b>Rather, is it not</b> the case that <b>there is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> concerning a girl <b>who refused</b> her husband, <b>as the first <i>tanna</i> maintains</b> that <b>she has</b> sustenance, as her marriage has been annulled and it is as though it never occurred, <b>and Rabbi Yehuda maintains</b> that <b>she does not have</b> sustenance, as she permanently forfeited this right when she left her father’s house in marriage.",
            "<b>Reish Lakish raised a dilemma:</b> With regard to the <b>daughter</b> of <b>a <i>yevama</i>,</b> i.e., a woman who married her <i>yavam</i> in levirate marriage and gave birth to a daughter before he passed away, does <b>she have sustenance</b> from the property of the <i>yavam</i>, i.e., the girl’s father, <b>or</b> does <b>she not have sustenance?</b>",
            "The Gemara clarifies the sides of the dilemma: <b>Since the Master said</b> that the payment of the <b>marriage contract</b> of a <i>yevama</i> is taken <b>from the property of her first husband,</b> not that of the <i>yavam</i>, her daughter should therefore <b>not have</b> rights to sustenance from the property of the <i>yavam</i>. Her sustenance is a stipulation of the marriage contract, which does not apply to the <i>yavam</i>. <b>Or perhaps, since if she does not have</b> enough to cover the amount of her marriage contract <b>from the</b> property of the <b>first</b> husband, <b>the Sages enacted for her</b> a marriage contract <b>from the second</b> one, i.e., the <i>yavam</i>.

        [
            "Once again the Gemara explains the sides of the dilemma: <b>Since</b> the Sages penalized the mother and declared that <b>she does not have a marriage contract,</b> the daughter <b>does not have sustenance</b> either, as her sustenance is guaranteed by her mother’s marriage contract. <b>Or perhaps,</b> with regard to <b>her mother, who violated a prohibition, the Sages penalized her</b> by depriving her of her marriage contract, whereas in the case of the daughter, <b>who did not violate a prohibition, the Sages did not penalize her.</b> Once again the Gemara states that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.",

            "<b>Rav Pappa raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>the daughter</b> of <b>a raped</b> woman, i.e., a man raped a young woman, married her, had a child, and died, does <b>she have</b> the right to receive <b>sustenance</b> from her father’s estate <b>or</b> does <b>she not have</b> the right to receive <b>sustenance</b> from his estate? The Gemara comments: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, do not raise this dilemma, as he said</b> that a raped woman <b>has a marriage contract of one hundred dinars,</b> and therefore she is entitled to the stipulations of a marriage contract, one of which is that if she has a daughter with her husband, the daughter receives sustenance from the husband’s estate.",
            "Rather, <b>let the dilemma be raised according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say</b> that the <b>money of her fine fulfilled</b> his obligation to provide <b>her</b> with a <b>marriage contract,</b> i.e., since she has already received the fine in compensation for the rape, she is not entitled to further payment in the form of a marriage contract.

            "The Gemara elaborates: It may be argued that <b>since</b> the mother <b>does not have a marriage contract,</b> the daughter <b>does not have</b> the right to receive <b>sustenance</b> from her father’s estate. <b>Or perhaps</b> one should consider the following: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>the marriage contract</b> was enacted? <b>So that</b> his wife <b>will not be demeaned in his eyes such that</b> he will easily <b>divorce her. And this one,</b> his rape victim, <b>he cannot divorce her</b> by Torah law, as it is stated: “He may not send her away all his days” (Deuteronomy 22:29). It was therefore unnecessary for the Sages to require that he provide the woman with a marriage contract. However, the reasons for the stipulations included in a marriage contract, e.g., that his daughter receives sustenance from his estate, still apply in this case. Consequently, the Sages stipulated that these provisions still be granted. Yet again the Gemara states that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.",
            "§ The mishna taught that one of the stipulations of a marriage contract is: <b>You will sit in my house</b> and be sustained from my property all your days as a widow. <b>Rav Yosef taught: In my house, and not in my hovel [<i>bikati</i>].</b> If there is no room for her in his house, the heirs are not obligated to allow her to stay there. <b>However,</b> even in this case, <b>she has</b> the right to receive her <b>sustenance</b> from the heirs. <b>Mar bar Rav Ashi said: She does not even have</b> the right to receive her <b>sustenance,</b> as she is entitled to sustenance only when she lives in her husband’s house. If she resides elsewhere, for whatever reason, she does not receive this payment.

            "The Gemara answers that this argument is incorrect, and one should make the following inference instead: In <b>these</b> cases listed in the <i>baraita</i>, she forfeits her marriage contract <b>whether</b> she took the action <b>in court</b> or <b>whether</b> she did <b>not</b> do so <b>in court.</b> However, with regard to <b>one who claims</b> her marriage contract, if she issues this claim <b>in court, yes,</b> she loses the right to continue to receive her sustenance, but if her claim was <b>not</b> issued <b>in court, no,</b> she has not forfeited this right.",

            "Consequently, according to Ravin, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi and Rabbi Yoḥanan agree that at the time of the wedding ceremony the wife can verbally waive her rights, and the dispute of the <i>tanna’im</i> is referring to the time after the ceremony, which is also the beginning of the time for consummation of the marriage. <b>Rav Pappa said: Had Rabbi Abbahu not said:</b> This <b>was explained to me</b> personally <b>by Rabbi Yoḥanan himself, that I,</b> i.e. Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi do not disagree with one another, I,</b> i.e., Rav Pappa, <b>would have said</b> that the way to understand the various texts is that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> do <b>disagree</b> with one another, whereas <b>Rav Dimi</b> and <b>Ravin do not disagree</b> with one another, but rather they both cited the same tradition from Eretz Yisrael.",

Consequently, had Rabbi Abbahu not declared that he was told otherwise by Rabbi Yoḥanan, it would have been preferable to explain that there is a logical dispute between Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi and Rabbi Yoḥanan, rather than saying that the dispute is about the details of the tradition received by Rav Dimi and Ravin.",

            "The Gemara first analyzes the language of the verse: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>“days”? If we say two days,</b> the minimum number justifying the use of the plural, does <b>a person</b> really <b>speak like this?</b> Rebecca’s relatives <b>said to</b> Abraham’s servant that they wanted her to stay for <b>two days,</b> after which <b>he said to them no,</b> as he did not want to wait even that long. If so, is it possible that after that <b>they said to him</b> that they wanted her to stay for <b>ten days?</b> Consequently, it is impossible to explain the word “days” as two days and “ten” as ten days. <b>Rather, what</b> is the meaning of <b>“days”?</b> It means: <b>A year, as it is written: “For days he shall have redemption”</b> (Leviticus 25:29), and there it is explained that “days” is referring to a year. Consequently, in the verse <b>“And her brother and mother said: Let the damsel abide with us for days, or ten”</b> (Genesis 24:55), “days” refers to a year, and “ten” refers to a shorter period of similar magnitude, i.e. ten months, in order to prepare for her wedding.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> let us <b>say</b> that “days” means <b>a month, as it is written: “But</b> a whole <b>month of days”</b> (Numbers 11:20), and the verse about Rebecca might then have meant that her family wanted to wait for a month, or at least for ten days. <b>They say: One derives</b> the meaning of an <b>unspecified</b> use of the term <b>“days” from</b> another <b>unspecified</b> instance of the term <b>“days,”</b> which means a year. <b>And one does not derive</b> the meaning of <b>an unspecified</b> use of the term <b>“days” from</b> an instance of the term <b>“days,” about which</b> the term <b>“month” is stated.</b> Consequently, it can be derived from the verse that the ordinary amount of time required for a virgin to prepare for marriage is twelve months.",

            "The Gemara raises an objection: <b>Let us say that</b> the mishna <b>supports</b> Rav Huna’s opinion, as it is taught: <b>If one consecrates his wife’s earnings, she may work and sustain</b> herself from her earnings. <b>What, is it not</b> discussing a woman <b>who is sustained</b> by her husband, meaning that he is willing to sustain her, although she relinquishes her right to sustenance in accordance with Rav Huna’s principle? Therefore, her earnings do not belong to him to consecrate. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is discussing a woman <b>who is not sustained</b> by her husband, as he does not have sufficient funds to sustain her. Consequently, there is no proof with regard to Rav Huna’s statement.",

Since <i>konam</i> is a form of consecration, it can take effect on an item even when it is subjugated to another when the owner prohibited it, similar to the case of mortgaged property.",
            "The Gemara asks: If it is so, that a <i>konam</i> can remove the lien on property, <b>let her earnings become consecrated from now,</b> even before her husband divorces her.

The somewhat superfluous word “it” teaches that <b>it</b> alone <b>is impure, but</b> the <b>milk</b> of <b>bipeds is not impure; rather,</b> it is <b>kosher.</b> Furthermore, one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>I should exclude the milk</b> of humans from the prohibition against consumption, as this issue <b>does not apply equally to everyone,</b> since only women produce milk, but <b>I should not exclude</b> from the prohibition human <b>blood, which</b> does <b>apply equally to everyone.</b> Consequently, <b>the verse states “it”</b> with regard to a camel, to say that <b>it</b> alone <b>is impure,</b> whereas the <b>blood</b> of <b>bipeds is not impure,</b> but <b>rather</b> is <b>kosher.</b>",
            "<b>And Rav Sheshet said</b> about this ruling: <b>There is not even a</b> rabbinic <b>command to refrain</b> from consuming human milk. Therefore, this presents a contradiction to the statement that a child who nurses beyond a certain age is like one who nurses from a non-kosher animal.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> statement that the milk is permitted is referring to <b>when it</b> has been <b>removed</b> from the woman’s body, and <b>that</b> statement, that the milk is forbidden, is referring to <b>when it</b> has <b>not</b> been <b>removed.</b> Fundamentally, human milk is a permitted substance. However, it is prohibited by rabbinic law for anyone other than a very young child to nurse directly from a woman’s breasts, and one who does so is considered like one who consumes milk from a non-kosher animal.",
            "<b>And the opposite</b> applies <b>to blood:</b> Human blood that has been removed from the body is forbidden, but if it has not yet been removed, it is permitted. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If some human <b>blood was on a loaf</b> of bread, one <b>scrapes off</b> the blood <b>and</b> then he may <b>eat</b> the bread. Since the blood was detached from the body, it is forbidden by rabbinic law, but if blood <b>was between</b> the <b>teeth, he may suck it</b> and swallow it <b>without concern,</b> as the blood is permitted if it has not been removed from the body.",
            "<b>The Master said</b> in the aforementioned <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> A child may continue to nurse <b>even</b> for <b>four or five years. But isn’t it taught</b> in a different <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: Even if</b> he can carry <b>his package on his shoulder</b> he can continue to nurse? The Gemara answers: This is not a contradiction, since <b>both this and that are one,</b> the same, <b>measure,</b> and the difference between them is only semantic. <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua.</b>",
            "On the same topic <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Marinos says: One who is coughing</b> due to an illness that requires milk but did not have milk available <b>may suck milk</b> directly from an animal’s udders <b>on Shabbat,</b> although milking is a prohibited labor on Shabbat. <b>What is the reason? Sucking</b> the milk in this way constitutes an act of <b>extracting in an unusual manner.</b> Although milking is an example of the labor of extracting, a subcategory of the primary category of threshing, it is prohibited by Torah law only when the labor is performed in its typical manner. One who nurses from an animal is extracting the milk in an unusual manner. Such labor is prohibited by rabbinic law, <b>but in a situation</b> involving <b>pain,</b> like one who is coughing, <b>the Sages did not issue a decree.

The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for this leniency? <b>This is</b> an example of <b>repairing</b> a vessel <b>in an unusual manner,</b> since it is uncommon to fix an item without using a tool or one’s hands. Performing labor in an unusual manner is ordinarily prohibited by rabbinic decree, <b>but in a situation</b> involving financial <b>loss, the Sages did not issue a decree.

Consequently, if a woman from that household arranges a wet nurse for her child, it is certain that the wet nurse will keep her commitment, whereas with other people there is a danger that if the mother remarries the child might be left without anyone to feed him.",
            "<b>Rav Pappi said to</b> Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua: <b>And do you not maintain</b> that such a marriage is prohibited <b>from that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If</b> a woman <b>frequently went to her father’s house</b> and had been there for a long time; <b>or she had been angry with her husband</b> and separated from him while still <b>in</b> his <b>house; or her husband had been incarcerated in prison; or</b> her husband <b>had gone overseas; or her husband had been old or ill; or if she was a barren woman, or elderly,</b> or <b>a sexually underdeveloped woman, or a minor girl; or if she had miscarried after the death of her husband; or if she was unfit to give birth</b> for any other reason, although in any of these cases there is no concern that she might be pregnant, <b>they must all wait</b> at least <b>three months.</b> The Sages said that a woman must wait for three months between marriages, so there would be no doubt as to who is the father of any child she may give birth to, and they did not distinguish between different women with regard to this decree.

From this they derive that a period of up to two weeks of abstinence is not deemed undue suffering. <b>And</b> from where do <b>Beit Hillel</b> derive their opinion? <b>They derive</b> it from <b>a woman who gave birth</b> to <b>a male,</b> as she is ritually impure for one week (see Leviticus 12:1–4).",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> if this is so, <b>Beit Hillel should also derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>from a woman who gave birth</b> to <b>a female,</b> since it is clear that the Torah does at times mandate a period of abstinence longer than one week. The Gemara answers: <b>If they derived it from a woman who gave birth,</b> this is <b>indeed</b> how they would have derived it. <b>Rather, Beit Hillel derived it from</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a menstruating woman,</b> who is prohibited from marital relations for seven days according to Torah law.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>With regard to what do they disagree?</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Beit Hillel, <b>holds</b> that one should derive <b>a common matter from a common matter.</b> Consequently, they derive the <i>halakha</i> of a permitted abstinence by a husband who vowed not to engage in marital relations with his wife from the <i>halakha</i> of a menstruating woman, since both are common cases. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Beit Shammai, <b>holds</b> that one should derive <b>a matter that one caused,</b> such as a vow, <b>from a</b> different <b>matter that he caused,</b> i.e., childbirth, and not from menstruation, which was not caused by him at all.",

            "<b>Rather,</b> it must be that the reason is because <b>he says: Since she is attached to me they will not give me another</b> wife. As long as he has not performed <i>ḥalitza</i>, he may have a problem finding another wife, as a potential wife will be concerned that he has a woman attached to him and may eventually enter levirate marriage with him. This is a valid claim, and therefore the court writes a letter of rebellion against her if she refuses <i>ḥalitza</i>.",
            "The Gemara asks: If so, <b>here too,</b> when she refuses a request to consummate the levirate marriage, he may say: <b>Since she is attached to me they will not give me another.</b> Why then doesn’t the court write a letter of rebellion in this case? <b>Rather,</b> one must say that <b>this and that</b> are both discussing a case <b>where he asked to consummate the levirate marriage.

            "Having discussed the various opinions with regard to the size of a loaf of bread sufficient for a meal, the mishna states that <b>half</b> of this loaf is the amount called a half [<i>peras</i>], a measure relevant <b>for</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a leprous house.</b> If one enters a house afflicted with leprosy and remains there long enough to eat this amount of food, the clothes he is wearing become ritually impure. <b>And half of its half,</b> one quarter of a loaf this size, is the amount of ritually impure food that <b>renders the body unfit.</b> In other words, impure food of this amount imparts ritual impurity to the body of the eater and disqualifies him by rabbinic law from eating <i>teruma</i>. <b>And half of one half of its half,</b> one-eighth of this loaf, is the minimum measure of food that is <b>susceptible to ritual impurity as food.</b>",
            "After the citing the mishna, the Gemara returns to its question: <b>Who is</b> the author of <b>the mishna</b> here, which says a husband must provide two <i>kav</i> of wheat per week for his wife’s sustenance? <b>If</b> it is <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka,</b> who maintains that one quarter of a <i>kav</i> is sufficient for a single meal, there <b>are</b> only <b>eight</b> meals in two <i>kav</i>, and the wife requires at least fourteen meals for a week, as it was customary to eat two meals each day. <b>And if</b> it is <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that one-ninth of a <i>kav</i> is sufficient for a meal, two <i>kav</i> <b>are</b> enough for <b>eighteen</b> meals, and therefore the mishna requires more than she actually needs.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, and</b> this is <b>as Rav Ḥisda said</b> in explanation of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka’s opinion: <b>Deduct one-third for the grocer’s</b> markup, as he takes one-third as profit. This adds one half to the total cost. <b>Here, too, bring one-third</b> and <b>add</b> it <b>to</b> the total amount of meals that can be provided by two <i>kav</i> of wheat. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Still,</b> after adjusting the calculation by adding an additional half, a measurement known by the term: Outside third, to the amount of meals that can be eaten from two <i>kav</i> of wheat, <b>they are</b> equal to <b>twelve meals.</b> This is still not sufficient, as the wife requires fourteen. The Gemara answers: <b>She eats with him on Shabbat evening.</b> Consequently, this meal is not included in the amount that must be provided through the third party.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that when the mishna is referring to eating, it means <b>literal eating. However, according to the one who says</b> that this <b>eating</b> on Shabbat evening is a euphemism, and it is actually referring to <b>conjugal relations, what can be said? And furthermore,</b> even if the meal on Shabbat evening is omitted, <b>they are</b> still <b>thirteen</b> meals that she requires but she has enough for only twelve. <b>Rather,</b> this is <b>as Rav Ḥisda said,</b> with regard to Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka’s opinion: <b>Deduct one-half for the grocer’s</b> markup. <b>So too</b> here, <b>bring a half and add</b> it <b>to</b> the total amount, which means she has enough for sixteen meals, not eight.",
            "The Gemara asks: This is <b>difficult</b> with regard to one statement <b>of Rav Ḥisda,</b> which seemingly contradicts the other statement <b>of Rav Ḥisda.</b> The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult.

            "After reconciling the apparent contradiction between the two statements of Rav Ḥisda, the Gemara returns to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka. <b>If so,</b> according to the above calculation, there <b>are sixteen</b> meals, which is more than a woman requires in a week. The Gemara suggests: In that case, <b>who is</b> the author of <b>the mishna?</b> Is it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥidka, who said</b> that <b>a person is obligated to eat four meals on Shabbat?</b> Since two meals are eaten on an ordinary weekday, this results in a total of sixteen meals a week.",
            "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>You</b> can <b>even say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who maintain that one is obligated to eat only three meals on Shabbat, as you should <b>remove one meal for guests and wayfarers.</b> In other words, the husband cannot give his wife the absolute minimum amount she requires for herself and no more. He must give her enough to provide for the occasional visitor. Consequently, the total sum is somewhat more than was originally assumed.",
            "The Gemara adds: <b>Now that you have arrived at this</b> answer, <b>you</b> can <b>even say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who maintains that two <i>kav</i> is sufficient for eighteen meals. This can be explained either by saying that Rabbi Shimon agrees with the opinion <b>of the Rabbis,</b> that one eats three meals on Shabbat, if you <b>remove three</b> meals <b>for guests and wayfarers,</b> or that Rabbi Shimon agrees with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ḥidka,</b> that four meals are eaten on Shabbat, in which case you must <b>remove two</b> meals <b>for guests and wayfarers.</b> In this manner, the mishna can be reconciled with all opinions.",

The Gemara explains: <b>This is what</b> Rabbi Yosei <b>is saying: Only Rabbi Yishmael, who was near Edom, allotted her a double</b> amount <b>of barley</b> to that <b>of wheat, since Edomite barley is bad,</b> whereas elsewhere the barley is of a higher quality, and therefore the difference between barley and wheat is less marked.",

            "<b>But rather,</b> there may be another explanation of Rav Huna’s statement: <b>Whereas</b> with regard to <b>support,</b> she may <b>also collect</b> it <b>from movable property</b> of the estate, with regard to <b>a stipulation in the marriage contract,</b> she may collect for it only <b>from real estate,</b> but <b>from movable property</b> she may <b>not collect</b> for it.",
            "The Gemara objects that this explanation is untenable: <b>According to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, from both <b>this and that</b> type of property, she may certainly <b>collect</b> for it, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Whether</b> with respect to <b>property that has a guarantee</b> behind it, assuring that the seller will compensate the buyer if the property is repossessed, i.e., real estate, <b>or whether</b> with respect to <b>property that does not have a guarantee,</b> i.e., movable objects, the court <b>appropriates</b> the funds necessary <b>for the sustenance of the wife and the daughters.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.

            "§ <b>Rav attached</b> the following question <b>for Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>between</b> the <b>lines</b> of a letter he sent him: With respect to <b>brothers who mortgaged</b> a certain property, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?

Did <b>they sell</b> the property <b>or</b> did <b>they pledge</b> it as a guarantee, so that it has not yet been transferred? Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>said to him: What difference does it make? Whether they sold</b> it <b>or pledged</b> it, the court <b>may appropriate</b> the property <b>for support</b> for the daughters’ dowries, <b>but</b> the court <b>may not appropriate</b> it for their <b>sustenance.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rav</b> himself, <b>if he is raising a dilemma</b> about a case in which <b>they sold</b> the property, <b>let him write</b> explicitly that he is asking about an instance in which <b>they sold</b> the property. And <b>if he is raising a dilemma</b> about a case in which <b>they pledged</b> the property, <b>let him write</b> explicitly that he is asking about an instance in which <b>they pledged</b> the property. Why does Rav instead employ an ambiguous term?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rav was raising a dilemma about both</b> cases <b>and thought: If I write to him</b> that <b>they sold</b> the property, then <b>it</b> works <b>out well if</b> he <b>sends</b> back <b>to me</b> the ruling <b>that</b> the court may <b>appropriate</b> the sold property for the daughters’ dowries.

            "<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Whether</b> it is <b>this or whether</b> it is <b>that,</b> the court <b>does not appropriate</b> assigned or sold properties for either the support or sustenance of the daughters. <b>A dilemma was raised before them:</b> Is it <b>that Rabbi Yoḥanan did not hear this</b> ruling <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>but had he heard it, he would have accepted it? Or, perhaps,</b> is it that even if <b>he had heard it, he would not have accepted it?</b>",
            "The Gemara proposes an answer, indicated by a dispute of <i>amora’im</i>: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof, <b>as it was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> disputed a certain case. The Sages debated the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>one who died and left</b> behind <b>two daughters and a son, and the first</b> daughter <b>advanced and took one-tenth of</b> the <b>estate</b> for her dowry, <b>but the second</b> daughter <b>did not have enough time to collect</b> her one-tenth <b>before the son died.</b> When the daughters divide the remaining assets, are they divided equally, or does the second daughter receive a slightly larger sum, commensurate with an additional portion earmarked for the dowry that she has not yet collected?",
            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The second</b> daughter <b>forfeited</b> her right to an equal one-tenth of the estate for a dowry. No specific funds are separated from the estate as a dowry before the inheritance is divided equally among the daughters. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said:</b> The Sages <b>said</b> something even <b>greater than this</b> with respect to her support: The court <b>appropriates</b> liened property <b>for support, but</b> it <b>does not appropriate</b> it <b>for sustenance. And</b> yet would you, Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>say</b> that <b>the second</b> daughter <b>forfeited</b> her right to collect even when the property is not liened? It cannot be that her support is diminished merely because of her brother’s death.",
            "The Gemara understands that there is evidence within the exchange that Rabbi Yoḥanan knew Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion and nevertheless ruled against it. <b>And if it is so,</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan never heard the ruling of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, then <b>let</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>say to</b> Rabbi Ḥanina: <b>Who stated that,</b> that property is appropriated for the dowry? Rather, Rabbi Yoḥanan must have known and rejected Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s ruling. The Gemara rejects the proof: <b>And perhaps he actually did not hear it; but</b> had <b>he heard it, he</b> would have <b>accepted it. And</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan ruled as he did because <b>it is different there,</b> in the case in which the son died, <b>since there is abundance</b> in <b>the house.</b> Since the second daughter receives half of all the inheritance, she is not concerned about the one-tenth of the estate.",
            "<b>Rav Yeimar said to Rav Ashi: If</b> that is <b>so,</b> according to that logic, then if <b>she</b> had <b>found a generic lost object, as there is abundance</b> in <b>the house</b> due to the value of the newly found article, <b>so too would we not give her one-tenth of the estate?</b> Since finding a lost object, or similarly, being independently wealthy, does not actually change her right to collect her full dowry, it stands to reason that she should collect the full dowry even when she inherits half of the remaining estate. <b>He said to him: I would say</b> this is true of <b>abundance</b> in <b>the house</b> that comes <b>from these properties</b> of the estate. Because the matter depends upon her share of the inheritance, when she commands a sizeable portion of the inheritance, she does not quibble over the one-tenth of the inheritance earmarked for her dowry. However, if she has other resources unrelated to the inheritance, her independent wealth cannot diminish her share of the inheritance with respect to the dowry.",
            "§ With regard to the fundamental right of daughters to receive the support of the dowry from the estate, <b>Ameimar said: A daughter is</b> considered <b>an inheritor. Rav Ashi said to Ameimar:</b> According to your opinion, <b>if</b> another inheritor <b>wants to remove her</b> from among the inheritors <b>by</b> giving her <b>money</b> instead of inherited property, is he <b>indeed unable to remove her?</b> May she insist on receiving actual property from the estate for the purpose of her dowry? <b>He said to him: Yes,</b> she may insist on inherited property. Rav Ashi continued to ask Ameimar: <b>If</b> he <b>wants to remove her by</b> giving her <b>one</b> specific piece of <b>land,</b> is he <b>also unable to remove her,</b> since, as an inheritor, she has the right to collect portions of all the property? <b>He said to him: Yes,</b> he is limited in this way. She may insist on her right to inherit from the entire property.",
            "In contrast to Ameimar, <b>Rav Ashi said: A daughter is</b> legally considered <b>a creditor</b> with regard to the inheritance, and the inheritors may insist that they will provide her support by any means, without giving her a share of the actual inheritance. The Gemara notes: <b>And even Ameimar retracted</b> his opinion that she is an inheritor, <b>as Rav Minyumi, son of Rav Niḥumi, said: I was standing in front of Ameimar, and this woman came before him, as she was asking</b> for <b>one-tenth</b> of her father’s <b>estate. And I saw that his opinion</b> was <b>that if</b> the inheritor <b>wants to remove her by</b> giving her <b>money,</b> he <b>may remove her, as I heard from</b> the woman’s <b>brothers that they were saying to her: If we had</b> sufficient <b>money, we would</b> pay your claims and <b>remove you with</b> our own <b>money. And Ameimar was silent and did not say anything to them.</b> Since Ameimar did not object to their suggestion in principle, evidently he agreed that her status was that of a creditor, who may be repaid in cash.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>And now that you</b> have reached a conclusion and <b>said</b> that the daughter <b>is</b> functionally <b>a creditor,</b> is she a creditor <b>of</b> the <b>father or of</b> the <b>brothers?</b> The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> <i>halakha</i> is there <b>a practical difference?</b> Either way, as the father has died, she receives her support from the estate. The Gemara answers: There is a difference with respect <b>to collecting intermediate-quality land without an oath and inferior-quality land with an oath.</b> If she is the father’s creditor, she may collect from the estate only the inferior-quality land with an oath. If, however, she is the brothers’ direct creditor, she may collect her claim in the same manner as standard creditors, collecting intermediate-quality land without an oath.",
            "<b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Whose creditor is she? The Gemara responds: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof, <b>as Ravina provided</b> one-tenth of the estate <b>for the daughter of Rav Ashi</b> from two sources. <b>From Mar, son of Rav Ashi,</b> Ravina gave her <b>intermediate-quality land without an oath.</b> He collected another portion of the property <b>from the</b> orphan <b>son of Rav Sama, son of Rav Ashi,</b> who was an inheritor of the same estate from his grandfather. This portion was provided of <b>inferior-quality land, with an oath.</b> Since, with regard to the property that Rav Ashi’s daughter was collecting from an orphan, Ravina required an oath and allowed her to collect only low-grade land, it appears that Ravina treated the daughter as the creditor of the sons and not of the father.",

The Gemara challenges the proof: The word <b><i>yenaḥem</i> implies</b> one comforting <b>others</b> and not the mourner being comforted. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> Since it is written without vowels, the word can be read <b>as</b> if <b>it were written “would be comforted [<i>yinnaḥem</i>],”</b> which describes the mourner who is being comforted.",

The word <i>mirzaḥ</i> may alternatively be read as two distinct words: Bitter [<i>mar</i>] and flustered [<i>zaḥ</i>], and the word <i>sar</i> has a homonym that means ruler. Read this way, the verse indicates: One who is <b>bitter and flustered,</b> i.e., the mourner, <b>is made</b> the <b>ruler of those who sit,</b> i.e., the visitors who come to comfort him and sit with him.

This is considered a matter between him and her, since the hair could interfere with sexual intercourse.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>This</b> works out <b>well according to the one who said the husband can nullify</b> his wife’s vow if it relates to <b>matters that are between him and her,</b> i.e., that disrupt normal, intimate relations between them. <b>But according to the one who said the husband cannot nullify</b> such vows, <b>what can be said?</b> The <i>amora’im</i> had a dispute concerning this question, <b>as it is stated:</b> With regard to vows related to <b>matters that are between him and her,</b> such as the example above, <b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>the husband</b> can <b>nullify</b> his wife’s vow, while <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said the husband cannot nullify</b> his wife’s vow, since it does not interfere with sexual intercourse between them.

But if she says: <b>The pleasure of intercourse with you</b> is forbidden <b>to me,</b> this vow is valid but <b>he may nullify</b> it. Although she is obligated by the terms of the marriage to cohabit with him, she does not directly contravene her obligation but rather prohibits herself from deriving pleasure from sexual intercourse.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> even if she creates this contingency by vowing that the pleasure of sexual intercourse will be forbidden to her if she adorns herself, <b>let her not adorn herself and she will not be forbidden.</b> Since the prohibition against intercourse created through her vow may never go into effect, the husband should not be able to nullify the vow, because a vow against adornment alone is not subject to the husband’s nullification. The Gemara answers: <b>If so, they</b> will <b>call her repulsive</b> when she does not adorn herself, and she cannot endure the embarrassment of such a situation. Therefore, it is assumed that she will eventually adorn herself at some point.",

Therefore, when he marries her, he does so with the intention that the consummation of the marriage serves as unconditional betrothal.

            "<b>He said to him: Student of the academy,</b> have <b>you spoken well?</b> The reason why the <i>ḥalitza</i> is valid is not because he waived his condition, but rather because the condition was invalid to begin with. <b>After all, from where</b> do <b>we learn</b> through tradition <b>all</b> the laws of <b>conditions? From the conditions</b> made with <b>the descendants of Gad and the descendants of Reuben.</b> Moses made a condition with the tribes of Gad and Reuben: If they would go with the rest of the nation to fight in the battles for the land of Canaan on the western side of the Jordan, they would receive their inheritance on the eastern side, as they requested (see Numbers, chapter 32).",

            "The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of betrothal, there is a special reason for this law, <b>because</b> the different ways of <b>becoming</b> betrothed <b>are juxtaposed to each other.</b> The Torah describes betrothal with the term becoming, as in the expression: “And she becomes another man’s wife” (Deuteronomy 24:2). Betrothal can be performed through the transference of money or an item of value, through a document, or through sexual intercourse. All three forms are juxtaposed with one another. Conditions can be stipulated for betrothal performed via transference of money or through a document, since these methods of betrothal can be fulfilled through an agent.

Such a statement would retroactively cast doubt on the validity of the bill of divorce and could potentially cause her children from a second marriage to have the status of <i>mamzerim</i>.

            "<b>“And the children of Israel did not smite them, for the princes of the assembly had sworn to them”</b> (Joshua 9:18), and since this oath was uttered in the presence of many people, it could not be rescinded, although it was undertaken in error because the Gibeonites had deceived the people of Israel. The Gemara poses a question: <b>And how many</b> people are considered <b>many</b> for the purposes of this law? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Three,</b> as can be learned from the laws of a woman who experiences a discharge of uterine blood after her menstrual period [<i>zava</i>]: <b>“Days”</b> indicates <b>two,</b> which is the minimal number justifying use of the plural noun. The term <b>“many</b> days” (Leviticus 15:25) therefore indicates a total of <b>three. Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Ten, as</b> the term <b>“assembly” is written in relation to the</b> Gibeonites, and it is taught elsewhere that an assembly is comprised of at least ten members.",
            "The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> In the case of <b>any vow that requires investigation by a halakhic authority, he may not remarry</b> her. <b>Rabbi Elazar says: They prohibited</b> remarrying a woman who was bound by a vow that <b>requires</b> investigation by a halakhic authority <b>only due to</b> a vow <b>that does not require</b> such investigation. The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle do <b>they disagree? Rabbi Meir holds</b> that <b>a man is willing for his wife to be degraded in court,</b> by going to have her vow dissolved. There is concern that the husband might say that had he known the vow could be dissolved he would not have divorced his wife. Such a claim would cast doubt on the validity of the bill of divorce. <b>Rabbi Elazar maintains</b> that <b>a man is not willing for his wife to be degraded in court</b> at all. Therefore, he cannot undermine the bill of divorce. The Sages prohibited him from remarrying her only due to a case that does not need investigation, as the husband can claim he did not know the vow could be dissolved.",
            "Returning to the earlier discussion, <b>Rava said</b> a different explanation of the <i>baraita</i> that rules that if she went to a halakhic authority who dissolved her vow she is nevertheless not betrothed: <b>Here we are dealing with an important woman,</b> i.e., a woman from an important family. The husband does not want her due to her habit of vowing, but since she is from an important family he is reluctant to give her a bill of divorce, <b>as he says: It is not amenable to me to be forbidden to</b> all <b>her relatives.</b> He wants to retain ties of marriage with this family, and once he has married this woman, even if he divorces her, he will be forbidden to her mother or sisters. He therefore prefers that the betrothal be entirely dissolved.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so,</b> consider <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>which teaches: But</b> if he betroths her on condition that there are no vows incumbent upon him or that he has no blemishes, and he does have vows or blemishes, but then <b>he goes to a halakhic authority and he dissolves his</b> vows, or <b>to a doctor and he heals him, she is betrothed.</b> Yet according to Rava, in that case too <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach</b> that <b>she is not betrothed, and let</b> us likewise <b>say</b> that <b>here we are dealing with an important person,</b> from an important family, <b>as she says: It is not amenable to me to be forbidden to his relatives.</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: There is a difference between a man and a woman in this regard, for <b>it is amenable to her</b> to be <b>with any</b> man, flawed though he may be, <b>as</b> taught by <b>Reish Lakish: As Reish Lakish said</b> that women say: <b>It is better to dwell</b> together <b>as two</b> [<b><i>tan du</i></b>] <b>than to dwell</b> alone as if <b>a widow.</b> Women will prefer any marriage to remaining single.

            "<b>Rav Pappa said</b> a different maxim expressing a similar idea: One <b>whose husband is a wool comber</b> [<b><i>nafsa</i></b>], a lowly occupation, <b>calls him to sit</b> with her <b>at the entrance to the house,</b> as she is proud of him and happy to be married. Similarly, <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> Even one <b>whose husband</b> is <b>lowly</b> [<b><i>kalsa</i></b>] <b>does not require lentils for her pot.</b> She is so happy with the simple fact that she is married that she does not mind even if he does not provide her with food.

Is this a stringency for the husband that if the value of enhancement is less he may not reclaim all his expenses, or is it a leniency that if the value is greater he need not take an oath? <b>Abaye said:</b> It means <b>that if</b> the value of <b>enhancement was greater than</b> the <b>expense, he takes the expense without an oath.</b>",
            "<b>Rava said to him: If so, he will come to deceive,</b> as he can always say that he spent slightly less than the value of the enhancement and thereby receive this amount without having to take an oath. <b>Rather, Rava said:</b> It means <b>that if the expense was greater than the enhancement, he has</b> rights to reclaim the <b>expense only</b> up to the <b>amount of</b> the <b>enhancement,</b> but no more, <b>and</b> even this amount he can claim only <b>by an oath.</b>",

This assumption that a marriage contract may not be claimed during the husband’s lifetime is derived from a close reading of the wording of the marriage contract, which states: When you may marry another you may claim this marriage contract, which indicates that if the woman is unable to marry another man because her husband is still alive she is not entitled to her marriage contract.",

            "It must therefore be concluded that <b>Beit Shammai maintain: A document that is ready to be collected is considered collected.</b> Consequently, the sum of the marriage contract is already considered in the woman’s possession, which means that when the heirs do not wish to pay the sum of the marriage contract they are actually trying to claim money due to an uncertainty.",
            "The Gemara questions the earlier statement that the marriage contract may not be collected during the husband’s lifetime due to the exposition of the language of the document: <b>But</b> even if the language of a marriage contract is not expounded, the simple meaning of its words indicates that she may not claim it during the lifetime of the <i>yavam</i>, as <b>we require</b> the fulfillment of the clause: <b>When you</b> may <b>marry another you</b> may <b>take that which is written to you, and this is not</b> the case here, as the <i>yevama</i> may not marry anyone else before she takes part in <i>ḥalitza</i>.

The words “whom he has been guilty” are expounded to mean that the borrower pays the one who is owed by his creditor, since the borrower is a party to this case despite the fact that he never incurred direct liability to him. It is possible to explain the <i>baraita</i> cited by Rav Yosef based on this reasoning as well.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> a different justification exists for rejecting the <i>baraita</i>: <b>We have not found a <i>tanna</i> who is stringent</b> with these <b>two stringencies with regard to a marriage contract.

It must therefore be rejected as non-authoritative.",

            "The Gemara relates a similar incident: There was <b>a certain man who had a <i>yevama</i> happen before him</b> for levirate marriage <b>in</b> the town of <b>Mata Meḥasya,</b> and <b>his brother wanted to disqualify her from him by</b> means of <b>a bill of divorce.</b> The man <b>said to</b> his brother: <b>What is your opinion?</b> Why are you doing this? <b>If</b> you are doing this <b>due to the property</b> of the dead brother, <b>I will divide the property with you.</b> The brother <b>said to him: I am scared that you will do to me like the swindler from Pumbedita did,</b> in the above story, when the man from Pumbedita promised he would share the inheritance and later retracted. The man <b>said to him: If you wish, divide it for yourself from now.</b> I am prepared for you to take the property already, although the acquisition will take effect only after I marry the <i>yevama</i>.",

This indicates that the present act of pulling is effective for later. Despite this <i>halakha</i>, Mar bar Rav Ashi claims that a difference exists between that case and the one currently under discussion.",
            "Mar bar Rav Ashi elaborates: <b>There,</b> with regard to the cow, it is <b>in</b> the seller’s <b>power</b> to transfer ownership at the present time, when the instruction to pull the cow is given, and therefore he can delay the acquisition. <b>Here,</b> however, it is <b>not in his power</b> to divide up the property, as he has yet to perform levirate marriage and the brother’s property does not belong to him. Consequently, he cannot transfer its ownership at the present time.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael <b>he said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> said: If one is instructed to pull a cow, but the acquisition will take effect only after thirty days, he has <b>not acquired</b> it. This contradicts Rabbi Yoḥanan’s own ruling. The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> case, when one acquires it, is referring to a situation <b>when he says to him: Acquire</b> it <b>from now,</b> so that once thirty days have passed it should belong to him retroactively, but <b>that</b> case, when one does not acquire it, is <b>when he did not say to him: Acquire</b> it <b>from now.</b> If the acquisition does not take effect now, it cannot take effect later.",

It is obvious that such an action is of no consequence. The Gemara answers: Ulla was not asked these two questions on the same occasion.

It is that <b>from Heaven they acquired a wife for him.</b> Since he did not choose her but married her by force of a Torah commandment, he is not obligated to set aside for her a marriage contract of his own. Rather, he relies upon his brother’s marriage contract.",

Since this was instituted for the benefit of the wife, she is able to opt out of this arrangement. Similarly, the husband may opt out of the arrangement granting him the right to the produce of his wife’s land.",

            "<b>Rav said:</b> That is no proof, as <b>we are dealing with a place where one does not write a marriage contract.</b> In those places, there is a general stipulation of the Sages that a husband must pay his wife the sum of the marriage contract even if no document was written. Therefore, there is no concern lest she produce the marriage contract at a later stage. <b>And Shmuel said</b> that the mishna is referring <b>even</b> to <b>a place where one writes a marriage contract,</b> which she claims to have lost.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Shmuel, does one</b> in fact <b>write a receipt?

There is no longer any possibility of deceit, as she will gain nothing by producing the marriage contract in a second court after having collected her marriage contract by producing her bill of divorce in a first court.",
            "The Gemara objects: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: If she produced <b>a marriage contract, and it</b> was <b>unaccompanied by a bill of divorce,</b> and <b>she says: My bill of divorce was lost, and he says:</b> Just as your bill of divorce was lost, so too <b>my receipt</b> for the payment of your marriage contract <b>was lost; and likewise,</b> in a case of <b>a creditor who produced a promissory note</b> after the Sabbatical Year, <b>unaccompanied by a <i>prosbol</i>,</b> and demanded payment of the debt, <b>these</b> debts <b>may not be collected.</b>",
            "The Gemara presents the question: <b>Granted, according to Shmuel,</b> this is reasonable.

Now, when she produces her marriage contract and the husband claims that he paid her by means of the bill of divorce and has lost the receipt, the mishna rules that this debt cannot be collected.",

            "The Gemara comments: The language of the mishna <b>is also precise,</b> that it is referring to a case where he wrote the marriage contract for her, <b>as it teaches: She collects the entire</b> amount. <b>Granted, if you say</b> that <b>he wrote</b> a marriage contract <b>for her,</b> it is <b>due to that</b> reason that <b>she collects</b> the <b>entire</b> amount, both the main sum and additional sum written in the marriage contract. <b>But if you say</b> that <b>he did not write</b> a marriage contract <b>for her,</b> and she collects a payment only because of the rabbinic ordinance, <b>what is</b> the meaning of: <b>She collects</b> the <b>entire</b> sum? <b>She has</b> only <b>one hundred dinars or two hundred</b> dinars, as enacted by the Sages, and no more. The phrase: Entire sum, is inappropriate according to this opinion.",
            "<b>But rather,</b> the proof that a widow from betrothal receives a marriage contract is <b>from</b> that <b>which was taught</b> by <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin:</b> Upon the death of <b>one’s betrothed wife,</b> he does <b>not</b> receive the status of <b>an acute mourner,</b> one whose close relative has died but has not yet been buried, <b>nor become impure</b> if he is a priest. <b>And likewise, she neither</b> receives the status of <b>an acute mourner nor becomes impure for him.</b> If <b>she dies, he does not inherit</b> from <b>her.</b> If <b>he dies, she collects</b> payment of <b>her marriage contract.</b> This shows that a widow from betrothal receives a marriage contract.",

Since the marriage settlement collected by the heirs of the second wife is considered a debt owed by the estate, this sum is considered to have been paid equally by all the heirs.

Consequently, her inability to repossess property from the first purchaser indicates that it is not possible to repossess liened property in the event that unsold property is blighted.",
            "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> It is possible to explain that <b>what</b> Rabbi Meir meant when he said: <b>She has lost</b> her marriage contract, is that <b>she has lost</b> her rights <b>from the second</b> purchaser alone, but not from the first.",
            "<b>Rava said:</b> There are <b>two responses</b> with which your <b>statement</b> can be rejected. <b>One</b> is that the expression: <b>She has lost, indicates</b> that she has lost her rights <b>entirely,</b> even with regard to the first purchaser. <b>And furthermore, it is</b> explicitly <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If an individual <b>borrowed from one</b> creditor <b>and sold his property to two</b> purchasers <b>and the creditor wrote</b> a note <b>to the second</b> purchaser saying: <b>I do not have</b> any <b>legal</b> dealings <b>or involvement with you, he has no</b> claims <b>toward the first purchaser</b> either.

            "The Gemara rejects the attempt to solve the dilemma with regard to collecting from liened property when the unsold property was blighted: <b>There,</b> in the case of a woman or man who wrote to the second purchaser: I do not have any legal dealings or involvement with you, it is <b>he who causes a loss to himself by</b> his own direct <b>action</b> of signing away his rights. It cannot be proven what the <i>halakha</i> would be in the case of a blighted field, where the reason he cannot make use of the field is not due to his own action.",

After <b>five years</b> the orchard <b>grew old</b> and no longer produced as it once did. The creditor <b>came before the Sages</b> to argue his claim, <b>and they wrote him</b> a document of <b>authorization to repossess</b> liened property from those who purchased land from the debtor after the giving of the loan.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>There too, it was they,</b> the purchasers, <b>who brought this loss upon themselves since they know that an orchard tends to age.</b> Therefore, <b>they should not have purchased</b> the land from the debtor because they should have realized that there was a chance that he would be unable to pay off his debt with the fruits of the orchard, and the creditor would repossess the land they were purchasing.",

When there are many people living together in one home, the expenses per capita are decreased. The heirs can say to her that if she stays with them in the house, the expense of her upkeep will be less than if she lives on her own.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And they should give her</b> the support in her father’s house <b>according to the blessing of the house,</b> i.e., according to the amount they would be required to pay if she lived with them. The Gemara answers: <b>Indeed,</b> the intent of the mishna is that they may pay her this amount, not that they may entirely avoid supporting her.",
            "<b>Rav Huna said:</b> The <b>language of the Sages</b> teaches <b>blessing,</b> the <b>language of the Sages</b> teaches <b>wealth,</b> and the <b>language of the Sages</b> teaches <b>healing.</b> One can learn important lessons about these matters from the manner in which the Sages formulated their halakhic rulings.

            "The language of the Sages teaches about <b>wealth, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Batra</i> 84b): <b>One who sells produce to another,</b> if the buyer <b>pulled</b> the produce as an act of acquisition <b>but did not measure</b> it, <b>he has acquired</b> the produce. If <b>he measured</b> the produce <b>but did not pull</b> it, <b>he has not acquired</b> it. <b>And if</b> the buyer <b>was perspicacious</b> and wanted to ensure that the seller would not back out of the deal, he would <b>rent the place</b> where the produce was located, and he would thereby acquire the produce immediately from the time he measures it.

            "Concerning Temple <b>service vessels, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the possibility <b>that they may be prepared by</b> using money <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance?</b> The Gemara explains the two sides of the dilemma: <b>Are they requirements of the altar, and</b> therefore they <b>came from</b> money <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance, or are they requirements of offerings, and</b> therefore <b>they were prepared from the collection of the</b> Temple treasury <b>chamber?</b> Rav <b>said to him: They are prepared only from the collection of the chamber.</b>",
            "Rav Huna <b>raised an objection to</b> this from a verse that deals with those in charge of maintaining the Temple structure: <b>“And when they had made an end, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, of which were made vessels for the house of the Lord, vessels with which to minister,</b> and buckets, and pans, and vessels of gold and silver” (II Chronicles 24:14). This indicates that vessels may be prepared with money consecrated for Temple maintenance.",
            "Rav <b>said to him: Whoever taught you the Writings did not teach you the Prophets,</b> as you forgot about the parallel verse in the Prophets: <b>“But there were not made for the house of the Lord cups</b> of silver, snuffers, basins, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of the Lord; <b>for they gave that to those who did the work”</b> (II Kings 12:14–15). This verse proves that vessels were not prepared with the money donated for Temple maintenance.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so, the verses contradict each other,</b> as in one place it states that the Temple vessels may be funded with the money donated for Temple maintenance, while in the other verse it states that this money was used exclusively for those involved in the actual work of Temple maintenance. The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult; here</b> it is speaking of a case <b>where they collected</b> funds <b>and there was</b> money <b>left over.</b> These funds could be used for Temple vessels. Conversely, <b>here,</b> the verse is referring to a situation <b>where they collected</b> funds <b>and there was nothing left over,</b> and therefore all of the money was allocated to actual Temple maintenance.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And if they collected</b> money <b>and there was</b> some <b>left over, what of it?</b> After all, that money was consecrated for another purpose. If the Temple vessels could not be prepared with money consecrated for Temple maintenance, how were they able to use any of these funds for this purpose? <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: The court</b> initially <b>sets a mental stipulation about the</b> money collected: <b>If it is required</b> for Temple maintenance, <b>it is required</b> and is allocated accordingly, <b>and if not, it will be</b> used <b>for the service vessels.</b>",

The Gemara answers: This is <b>as Rava said</b> elsewhere, that the phrase <b>“the burnt-offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:5), with the definite article, is referring to <b>the first burnt-offering; so too,</b> the term <b>“the money”</b> (II Chronicles 24:14) is referring to <b>the first money,</b> i.e., the money removed from the collection of the chamber.",
            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the following source: The funds for <b>the incense and all communal offerings come from the collection of the</b> Temple treasury <b>chamber.</b> The funds for <b>the golden altar,</b> located inside the Sanctuary and upon which the incense was offered, <b>the frankincense, and the service vessels</b> all <b>come from the leftover</b> money of the funds set aside for <b>the libations.</b>",

            "The Gemara answers: <b>It is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 6a): <b>What would they do with the leftover</b> funds <b>of the collection</b> of shekels that had not been spent on communal offerings?

            "The Gemara explains the reason for Rabbi Akiva’s ruling: <b>What is the reason</b> that one may <b>not</b> use <b>consecrated</b> property to generate a profit? It is because <b>there is no poverty in a place of wealth,</b> i.e., the Temple must always be run in a lavish manner. Therefore, one may not use Temple funds to generate small profits in the manner of paupers. <b>What is the reason</b> that one may <b>not</b> use funds set aside <b>for the poor</b> to make a profit?

            "§ The Gemara returns to the mishna, which deals with the case of <b>one who went overseas</b> and his wife is demanding sustenance. <b>It was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> debated the following issue. <b>Rav said:</b>"

        [
            "The court <b>apportions sustenance for a married woman,</b> i.e., if a husband went overseas and left behind nothing with which his wife could provide for her sustenance, the court withdraws money from his estate for this purpose. <b>And Shmuel said:</b> The court <b>does not apportion sustenance for a married woman. Shmuel</b> further <b>said: Abba,</b> i.e., Rav, <b>concedes to me</b> that the court does not touch the husband’s estate <b>for the first three months.</b> This is <b>because a person does not leave his house empty,</b> and therefore it is certain that he left something with which his wife can sustain herself at least in the short term.",
            "The Gemara comments: In a case <b>where they heard that</b> the husband <b>died, everyone agrees</b> that the court sustains his wife from his estate. <b>When they disagree</b> it is in a case <b>where they did not hear that he had died</b> abroad. <b>Rav said</b> that the court <b>apportions</b> sustenance for the wife, <b>as</b> his estate is legally <b>mortgaged to her</b> and must provide her with sustenance, <b>and Shmuel said</b> that in this case the court <b>does not apportion</b> sustenance for her.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for Shmuel’s ruling? <b>Rav Zevid said:</b> One can <b>say that he gave her a bundle</b> of money before he departed. <b>Rav Pappa said: We are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps he said to her</b> before his departure: <b>Spend your earnings to sustain yourself,</b> i.e., he renounced his rights to her earnings and in exchange he is no longer required to provide her with support.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> these two explanations? The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> in a case where the woman is <b>an adult,</b> and therefore it is possible that he left her money, <b>and</b> the amount she earns is <b>not enough</b> for her needs. According to the opinion of Rav Zevid, one can assume that he gave her money and therefore it is not necessary for the court to allocate her sustenance from his estate, whereas according to the opinion of Rav Pappa, as her earnings are not enough for her sustenance the court apportions more for her from his estate, despite the husband’s possible stipulation.",
            "<b>Alternatively,</b> there is a difference between them in the case of <b>a minor</b> wife, with whom the husband would not have left money, <b>but</b> her earnings are <b>enough</b> for her sustenance.

The Gemara answers: It is referring to a case <b>where he appointed</b> a third party <b>for this</b> purpose, his wife’s sustenance, <b>but he did not appoint</b> a third party <b>for this</b> purpose, the sustenance of his children.

            "The Gemara analyses this dispute: <b>Everyone</b> agrees that if the field of one of the parties, which served as guarantee for the promissory note, was <b>superior-quality land and</b> the other person also had <b>superior-quality land,</b> or one had <b>intermediate-quality land and</b> the other had <b>intermediate-quality land,</b> or one had <b>inferior-quality land and</b> the other had <b>inferior-quality land,</b> this <b>is certainly</b> considered like <b>shifting</b> donkey <b>packs,</b> i.e., it is an exercise in futility, as there is no reason to exchange their money.",

Rav Naḥman holds</b> that <b>this one collects</b> his debt <b>and that one collects</b> his debt, as <b>he holds</b> that <b>one assesses</b> the quality of land <b>on</b> the basis of <b>his own</b> fields, i.e., if the borrower has different types of land, then his best land is classified as superior-quality land, the next best is considered intermediate-quality land, and his worst fields are called inferior-quality land.",
            "Consequently, <b>the owner of inferior-quality land,</b> Reuven, <b>will come and collect</b> his debt from the <b>intermediate-quality land</b> of his debtor, Shimon, in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> that a creditor collects payment from intermediate-quality land.

If so, then <b>ultimately, when that</b> second debtor, Shimon, comes to collect from Reuven he will take back his own <b>intermediate-quality land,</b> i.e., the field that Reuven took from him only a short while earlier. Consequently, no purpose is served by going through this process.",

            "The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> only in a case <b>where</b> the owner of the low-quality land happened to <b>precede</b> the other <b>and claim</b> from him first.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where he came on</b> exactly <b>that day when the five years</b> of the first loan <b>were completed.</b> The dispute is as follows: <b>One Sage,</b> the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that <b>a person will take out a loan</b> even <b>for one day, and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Admon, <b>holds</b> that <b>a person will not take out a loan for one day,</b> and therefore he would have waited one day to receive payment of the debt owed to him.",

Consequently, the statement of the Rabbis that each collects based on the document in his possession has practical ramifications. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> that <b>this one collects</b> his promissory note <b>and that one collects</b> his promissory note, whereas according to this interpretation only the orphans collect the debts they are owed.

            "§ <b>The Sages taught</b> the following with regard to the verse <b>“Let abundant [<i>pissat</i>] grain be in the land upon the top of the mountains”</b> (Psalms 72:16). <b>They said: In the future, wheat will rise up, and grow</b> tall <b>like a palm tree, and ascend to the top of the mountains.

            "It is stated: <b>“With the kidney-fat of wheat”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:14).

As it is stated: “And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan”</b> (Genesis 10:6), which indicates that Egypt, Mizraim, was older than Canaan, in whose territory Hebron was located.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the meaning of the verse is that Hebron <b>was more developed</b> and more fertile <b>than Zoan</b> by <b>sevenfold,</b> which means that Hebron produced 490 <i>kor</i>, seven times more than the seventy <i>kor</i> of regular fertile land, as stated above. <b>And this applies only to the rocky</b> terrain of Eretz Yisrael, e.g., Hebron, <b>whereas</b> those parts of Eretz Yisrael that were <b>not rocky</b> produced even more, up to <b>five hundred</b> <i>kor</i>.",
