            "[mishna] A man who warns his wife -R' Eliezer says, he warns her before two witnesses, but he can make her drink [the bitter water of the Sotah ceremony] according to one [testimony] or his own  R' Joshua says,  he must warn her before two witnesses and can make her drink [only] according to two witnesses.",
            "How does he warn her?  He says to her before two [witnesses] \"Do not speak with a certain man.\" And if she speaks with him, she is still permitted in her house (to have sexual relations with her own husband) and permitted to eat Terumah. ",
            "If she meets with him in a house secretly and stays with him [long enough] to become impure, she is forbidden to her husband (to be in her house) and forbidden to eat the Terumah.  And if [her husband] dies, [she performs] the Chalitza [ceremony and does not contract a] Levirate Marriage [to one of his male relatives].",

            " The Tanna, should teach Sotah and then teach Nazir!  Since the Tanna taught Kesubos and taught [in it Perek] HaMdir, he taught Nedarim; and since he taught Nedarim, he taught Nazir, which is similar to Nedarim; and then he taught Sotah in accordance with Rebbi.",
            "\"One who warns\"  — after the fact, yes; initially, no. The author of our <i>mishnah</i> holds that it is forbidden to warn [one's wife not to speak to a certain man].",
            "Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak says: When Reish Lakish would begin teaching the topic of the Sotah, he would say as follows: A man's wife is not matched to him [based on any factor] except in accordance with [the merit of] his deeds, as it says (Psalms 125:3) \"For the rod of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous.\" Rabbah bar Bar Chanah says: Rabbi Yochanan said, And the difficulty of matching couples is as [that of] the splitting of the Sea of Reeds, as it says (Psalms 68:7) \"God maketh the solitary to dwell in a house; He bringeth out the prisoners into prosperity.\"",
            "Is this really so? But Rav Yehudah said: Rav said Forty days before the formation of a fetus a Heavenly voice emanates and says, \"The daughter of so-and-so [will be matched] to so-and-so, the house of so-and-so to so-and-so, the field of so-and-so to so-and-so.\" It isn't a difficulty: One refers to the first match, the other refers to the second match."

            "But the reason is because it was written; \"one witness cannot stand against a man\". Without this I would have said that witness of Sotah is one. And if there is not even one then according to what does she become prohibited?"

            "Concerning him, it is stated in Scripture, \"Save me, O God, for the waters have come into my soul, I sink in deep mire where there is no standing, etc. (Psalm 60:2) Let not the water overwhelm me, neither let the deep swallow me up, etc. (Psalm 60:16)\"",
            "At the same time, Moses was lengthening his prayer and the Holy One Blessed be He said to him, \"My beloved ones are drowning in the sea and you are lengthening your prayer before me.\" He said to Him, \"Master of the world, 'What is in my hands to do?'\" He said to him, \"Speak to the Children of Israel that they go forward and you will lift up your rod and stretch out your hand, etc. (Exodus 14:15-16).\"",
            "For this reason, Judah was to be the ruling power in Israel, as it is said, \"Judah became His sanctuary, and Israel His dominion. (Psalm 114:2)\" Why was Judah His sanctuary and Israel His dominion? Because the sea saw him and fled."

            "R. Joshua b. Levi also said: [The necessity for] the heifer whose neck is to be broken  only arises on account of the miserly of spirit, as it is said: \"Our hands have not shed this blood.\" But can It enter our minds that the elders of a Court of Justice are murderers?! The meaning is, [The man found dead] did not come to us for help and we dismissed him, we did not see him and let him go — i.e., he did not come to us for help and we dismissed him without supplying him with food, we did not see him and let him go without escort."

(So too) a cancellation of tithes cancels the fatness of the corn. Section II: Rav Chuna found a juicy date (d’ Chinunta). He took and wrapped it in his mantle, Rabba his son came and said to (Rav Chuna) “I smelled the smell of a juicy date. (Rav Chuna) said to him, My son purity lies within you. (Rav Chuna) gave it (the date) to (Rabba). Meanwhile Abba, (Rabba’s) son, came. So (Rabba) took (the date) and gave it to (Abba). Rav Chunna said to Rabba, “My son you gladdened my heart and now you blunted my teeth. This is why people say a father’s love is for his children, and the love of his child is for his own children. Section III: Rav Acha ben Yaakov raises Rav Yaakov the son of his daughter. When he grew up (the grandfather) said, “Give me water.” The grandson said, “No, I am not your son.” That is why people say, “You raise and raise (your grandchild), (in the end he will say to you), “I am the son of your son.”"
