            "How does he warn her?  He says to her before two [witnesses] \"Do not speak with a certain man.\" And if she speaks with him, she is still permitted in her house (to have sexual relations with her own husband) and permitted to eat Terumah. ", 
            "If she meets with him in a house secretly and stays with him [long enough] to become impure, she is forbidden to her husband (to be in her house) and forbidden to eat the Terumah.  And if [her husband] dies, [she performs] the Chalitza [ceremony and does not contract a] Levirate Marriage [to one of his male relatives].",

            " The Tanna, should teach Sotah and then teach Nazir!  Since the Tanna taught Kesubos and taught [in it Perek] HaMdir, he taught Nedarim; and since he taught Nedarim, he taught Nazir, which is similar to Nedarim; and then he taught Sotah in accordance with Rebbi.", 
            "\"One who warns\"  — after the fact, yes; initially, no. The author of our <i>mishnah</i> holds that it is forbidden to warn [one's wife not to speak to a certain man].", 
            "Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak says: When Reish Lakish would begin teaching the topic of the Sotah, he would say as follows: A man's wife is not matched to him [based on any factor] except in accordance with [the merit of] his deeds, as it says (Psalms 125:3) \"For the rod of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous.\" Rabbah bar Bar Chanah says: Rabbi Yochanan said, And the difficulty of matching couples is as [that of] the splitting of the Sea of Reeds, as it says (Psalms 68:7) \"God maketh the solitary to dwell in a house; He bringeth out the prisoners into prosperity.\"", 
            "Is this really so? But Rav Yehudah said: Rav said Forty days before the formation of a fetus a Heavenly voice emanates and says, \"The daughter of so-and-so [will be matched] to so-and-so, the house of so-and-so to so-and-so, the field of so-and-so to so-and-so.\" It isn't a difficulty: One refers to the first match, the other refers to the second match."

Rav Chunna said to Rabba, “My son you gladdened my heart and now you blunted my teeth. This is why people say a father’s love is for his children, and the love of his child is for his own children. Section III: Rav Acha ben Yaakov raises Rav Yaakov the son of his daughter. When he grew up (the grandfather) said, “Give me water.” The grandson said, “No, I am not your son.” That is why people say, “You raise and raise (your grandchild), (in the end he will say to you), “I am the son of your son.”"
