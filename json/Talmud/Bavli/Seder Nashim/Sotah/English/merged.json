            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who issues a warning to his wife</b> not to seclude herself with a particular man, so that if she does not heed his warning she will assume the status of a woman suspected by her husband of having been unfaithful [<i>sota</i>], <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> He <b>issues a warning to her based on,</b> i.e., in the presence of, <b>two</b> witnesses for the warning to be effective. If two witnesses were not present for the warning, she is not a <i>sota</i> even if two witnesses saw her seclusion with another man. <b>And</b> the husband <b>gives</b> the bitter water to her <b>to drink based on</b> the testimony of <b>one witness</b> who saw the seclusion, <b>or</b> even <b>based on his own</b> testimony that he himself saw them secluded together, as Rabbi Eliezer holds that only the warning requires witnesses, not the seclusion. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> He both <b>issues a warning to her based on two</b> witnesses <b>and gives</b> the bitter water to her <b>to drink based on</b> the testimony of <b>two</b> witnesses.",
            "The mishna asks: <b>How</b> does he <b>issue a warning to her</b> in an effective manner? If he <b>says to her in the presence of two</b> witnesses: <b>Do not speak with</b> the <b>man</b> called <b>so-and-so, and she</b> nevertheless <b>spoke with him, she is still permitted to her home,</b> i.e., she is permitted to engage in sexual intercourse with her husband, <b>and</b> if she is the wife of a priest <b>she is</b> still <b>permitted to partake of <i>teruma</i>.</b>",
            "However, if after he told her not to speak with so-and-so, <b>she entered into a secluded place and remained with</b> that man long <b>enough to</b> become <b>defiled,</b> i.e., sufficient time to engage in sexual intercourse, <b>she is forbidden to her home</b> from that moment until she undergoes the <i>sota</i> rite. <b>And</b> likewise, if she was the wife of a priest <b>she is prohibited from partaking of <i>teruma</i>,</b> as she was possibly disqualified by her infidelity, so long as her innocence is not proven by means of the bitter water. <b>And if</b> her husband <b>dies</b> childless before she drinks the bitter water, <b>she performs <i>ḥalitza</i></b> with her late husband’s brother <b>and may not enter into levirate marriage,</b> as, if she had been unfaithful, levirate marriage is forbidden.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara questions the placement of this tractate within the mishnaic order of <i>Nashim</i>. <b>Now,</b> the <b><i>tanna</i> arose from</b> tractate <b><i>Nazir</i>,</b> which is the tractate preceding <i>Sota</i> in the order of the Mishna. <b>What</b> did he <b>teach</b> in <i>Nazir</i> <b>that</b> required that he <b>teach</b> tractate <b><i>Sota</i></b> immediately afterward, as at first glance there seems to be no connection between this tractate and <i>Nazir</i>?",
            "The Gemara answers: This was done <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi with regard to the sequence of passages in the Torah, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: Why is the portion of a nazirite</b> (Numbers, chapter 6) <b>placed adjacent to the portion of a <i>sota</i></b> (Numbers, chapter 5)? This was done <b>to tell you that anyone who sees a <i>sota</i> in her disgrace</b> as she undergoes the rite of the bitter water <b>should renounce wine,</b> as wine is one of the causes of sexual transgression, as it loosens inhibitions. For the same reason that the Torah teaches these passages one after the other, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi arranged these tractates one after the other.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>let</b> him <b>teach</b> tractate <b><i>Sota</i> first and then let</b> him <b>teach</b> tractate <b><i>Nazir</i>,</b> which is the way these topics are ordered in the Torah, and also accords better with the statement of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi. The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> tractate <b><i>Ketubot</i>, and</b> in that tractate he <b>taught</b> a chapter that begins: <b>One who vows,</b> in which there are several <i>mishnayot</i> concerning vows between husbands and wives, he then <b>taught</b> tractate <b><i>Nedarim</i>,</b> whose subject is the <i>halakhot</i> of vows. <b>And since</b> he <b>taught</b> tractate <b><i>Nedarim</i>,</b> he then <b>taught</b> tractate <b><i>Nazir</i>, which is similar to</b> tractate <b><i>Nedarim</i></b> in that one becomes a nazirite by taking a vow. <b>And</b> he then <b>teaches</b> tractate <b><i>Sota</i>, in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.",
            "§ The Gemara begins clarifying the mishna. The mishna states: <b>One who issues a warning</b> to his wife. By employing the descriptive phrase: One who issues a warning, and not the prescriptive phrase: One issues a warning, the <i>tanna</i> indicates that <b>after the fact, yes,</b> it is effective if he issues a warning in this manner, but ideally, <b>no,</b> one should not issue a warning to his wife at all <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b> Apparently, <b>the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna <b>holds</b> that it <b>is prohibited to issue a warning</b> to one’s wife <i>ab initio</i> in a manner that can cause her to become a <i>sota</i>, and all the <i>halakhot</i> concerning a <i>sota</i> are for one who issued a warning when not obligated to do so.",
            "<b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak says: When Reish Lakish would introduce</b> his discussion of the Torah passage <b>of <i>sota</i></b> he would <b>say this:</b> Heaven <b>matches a woman to a man only according to his actions, as it is stated: “For the rod of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous”</b> (Psalms 125:3), indicating that if one has a wicked wife it is due to his own evil conduct. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: And it is as difficult to match</b> a couple together <b>as</b> was <b>the splitting of the Red Sea, as it is stated</b> in a verse that speaks of the exodus from Egypt: <b>“God makes the solitary individuals dwell in a house; He brings out prisoners into prosperity [<i>bakosharot</i>]”</b> (Psalms 68:7). God takes single individuals and causes them to dwell in a house by properly matching a man to a woman. This is similar to the exodus from Egypt, which culminated in the splitting of the Red Sea, where He released prisoners into prosperity.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so</b> that a man is matched to a woman according to his actions? <b>But Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Forty days before an embryo is formed a Divine Voice issues forth and says: The daughter of so-and-so is</b> destined <b>to</b> marry <b>so-and-so; such and such a house is</b> destined <b>to</b> be inhabited by <b>so-and-so; such and such a field is</b> destined <b>to</b> be farmed by <b>so-and-so.</b> This clearly states that these matters, including marriage, are decreed for a person even before he is formed. The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> statement that Rav Yehuda says in the name of Rav is <b>with regard to a first match [<i>zivug</i>],</b> while <b>this</b> statement of Rabba bar bar Ḥana in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan is <b>with regard to a second match.</b> A first match is decreed in heaven; a second match is according to one’s actions.",
            "§ The Gemara now clarifies the dispute in the mishna. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The husband must <b>issue a warning to her based on,</b> i.e., in the presence of, <b>two</b> witnesses, and he gives the bitter water to her to drink based on the testimony of one witness. Rabbi Yehoshua says: He both issues a warning to her based on two witnesses and gives the bitter water to her to drink based on the testimony of two witnesses who saw them secluded together. The Gemara notes: Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua <b>disagree only with regard to</b> the requisite number of witnesses for the <b>warning and</b> the <b>seclusion,</b> whether one or two witnesses are required, <b>but with regard to</b> the testimony concerning <b>defilement</b> after the warning was issued and seclusion had occurred, they agree that even the testimony of <b>one witness is deemed credible</b> to establish that the woman actually engaged in sexual intercourse with the man while secluded.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>And we learned also</b> in another mishna (31a) that if <b>a single witness says: I saw that she was defiled,</b> then <b>she would not drink</b> the bitter water, as the testimony is accepted, and her husband must divorce her and she forfeits payment of her marriage contract. Therefore, there is no need to perform the <i>sota</i> rite.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>By Torah law, from where do we</b> derive <b>that one witness is deemed credible</b> with regard to testifying that a <i>sota</i> engaged in sexual intercourse? The Gemara answers: <b>As the Sages taught</b> in reference to the verse describing the circumstances in which a woman defiled through an act of adultery becomes forbidden to her husband, which states: “And a man lie with her carnally and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, she being defiled secretly, <b>and there is no witness [<i>ed</i>] against her”</b> (Numbers 5:13), <b>the verse is speaking of</b> a lack of <b>two</b> witnesses. When the verse refers to the lack of an <i>ed</i>, written in the singular, it actually indicates that there are not two witnesses against her, but only one, as the <i>baraita</i> will now explain.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues and asks: <b>Or</b> perhaps the verse is referring <b>only</b> to a case where there was not <b>even one</b> witness to the act of sexual intercourse, as the singular usage of the word <i>ed</i> would seem to indicate? The <i>baraita</i> now proves that elsewhere the word <i>ed</i> is used to indicate two witnesses, as <b>the verse states: “One witness [<i>ed</i>] shall not rise up against a man</b> for any iniquity or any sin that he sins; by the mouth of two witnesses or by the mouth of three witnesses shall a matter be established” (Deuteronomy 19:15)."
        ],
        [
            "The <i>baraita</i> infers a general principle from this verse by asking: <b>By inference from that</b> which <b>is stated</b> in the verse, even with the omission of the word “one”: <b>“A witness shall not rise up against a man”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:15), <b>do I not know that it is</b> referring to <b>one</b> witness, as the term “rise up [<i>yakum</i>]” is written in the singular form? <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> explicitly: <b>“One</b> witness,” since it is obviously referring to only one witness? The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>This established a paradigm</b> that <b>every place</b> where the word <b>“witness [<i>ed</i>]” is stated</b> in the Torah without specifying a number, <b>there are two</b> witnesses <b>here, unless the verse specifies</b> that it is referring to only one witness by writing the word <b>“one.”</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> returns to discuss the verse concerning a <i>sota</i>. <b>And the Merciful One states:</b> “There is no witness [<i>ed</i>] against her” (Numbers 5:13), which therefore means that <b>there are not two</b> witnesses to the sexual intercourse that could testify <b>with regard to her; rather,</b> there is only <b>one</b> witness. The <i>baraita</i> completes its interpretation: Further in the verse it states: <b>“And she was not taken,”</b> indicating that the verse is referring to a case in which it is known that the woman had not been raped. This knowledge is based on the testimony of only one witness, as the verse had already stated that there were not two witnesses, and since one witness saw her willingly engage in sexual intercourse with another man, <b>she is forbidden.</b>",
            "The Gemara questions this reasoning: <b>But</b> this would seem to indicate that <b>the</b> only <b>reason</b> to interpret the verse concerning a <i>sota</i> as referring to a case where there is only one witness is <b>that it is written</b> in the other verse: <b>“One witness shall not rise up against a man”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:15), indicating that any unspecified usage of the word <i>ed</i> in the Torah refers to two witnesses, <b>but</b> were it <b>not</b> for <b>this</b> inference, <b>I would say</b> that when the term <b>witness</b> is employed in the verse <b>concerning a <i>sota</i></b> it <b>is</b> referring to <b>one</b> witness. However, this would mean that the woman is forbidden to her husband even if there is not even one witness who saw the alleged sexual intercourse, <b>and if there is not even one</b> witness to testify, <b>then with what</b> testimony <b>does she become forbidden</b> to her husband? Obviously, even without another verse, it must be understood that the verse is indicating that there are not two witnesses but there is one, or else there would be no testimony to her actions.",
            "The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary</b> to infer the interpretation of the verse concerning the <i>sota</i> from the other verse mentioning one witness. Otherwise it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that the verse here that states: <b>“There is no witness against her,”</b> means that a single witness testifying about the sexual intercourse <b>is not deemed credible with regard to her</b> under any circumstances, and the testimony of one witness is not accepted in the case of a <i>sota</i>.",
            "The Gemara questions this analysis: What would be the logic in interpreting the verse as indicating that a single witness <b>is not deemed credible with regard to her? But</b> if that is the interpretation, <b>what</b> does the verse <b>require</b> in order for a <i>sota</i> to be rendered forbidden?",
            "The Gemara explains its question: If the verse is understood as indicating that a woman isn’t forbidden <b>until there are two witnesses</b> to testify to her infidelity, then <b>let the verse be silent from</b> any mention of witnesses, <b>as</b> the requirement for two witnesses in matters of sexual impropriety <b>is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the word <b>“matter”</b> written with regard to forbidden relations, and the word <b>“matter”</b> written with regard to <b>monetary matters.</b> The verbal analogy by which it is learned that two witnesses are required is as follows: A verse concerning forbidden relations states: “Because he has found some unseemly matter about her” (Deuteronomy 24:1), and a verse concerning monetary matters states: “By the mouth of two witnesses or by the mouth of three witnesses shall a matter be established” (Deuteronomy 19:15). <b>And I</b> would <b>know</b> that the requirement that two witnesses testify applies in the case of a <i>sota</i>, <b>just as it does in all</b> other matters of <b>testimony in the Torah.</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary</b> that the verse be stated in the case of a <i>sota</i> as well, for it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that testimony concerning <b>a <i>sota</i> is different</b> from other testimony, and even testimony of one witness would be sufficient <b>because</b> there is <b>a basis for</b> anticipating <b>the matter. Since</b> the husband <b>issued a warning to her</b> about this particular man <b>and she</b> then <b>secluded</b> herself with him, perhaps even <b>one witness should be deemed credible with regard to her.</b> Therefore, the verse informs us that one witness is not deemed credible to render her forbidden to her husband.",
            "The Gemara asks another question concerning its earlier analysis: <b>But how can you</b> think to <b>say</b> that the verse would be stating that one witness <b>is not deemed credible with regard to her</b> having engaged in sexual intercourse <b>and she</b> would remain <b>permitted</b> to her husband? <b>But from</b> the continuation of the same verse, from the fact <b>that it is written: “And she was not taken,”</b> which indicates that the verse is referring to a case where she was not raped, one concludes <b>by inference</b> that the verse is referring to a woman <b>who</b> becomes <b>forbidden</b> to her husband for engaging in consensual adulterous sexual intercourse.",
            "The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, it still <b>was necessary</b> to teach the principle derived from the other verse that the term “<i>ed</i>” is referring to two witnesses even in the context of a <i>sota</i>, as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that the verse should be understood to mean that one witness <b>is not deemed credible with regard to her,</b> and she remains permitted <b>until there are two</b> witnesses who testify to the sexual intercourse, <b>and with</b> the testimony of <b>two witnesses as well, it is</b> only <b>when she was not seized</b> and forced to cohabit with the man. Therefore, to refute this possible interpretation, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that “<i>ed</i>” always refers to two witnesses unless stated otherwise. Therefore, the phrase in the verse concerning a <i>sota</i> that says: “There is no witness [<i>ed</i>] against her,” means that there were not two witnesses, but if there was only one witness he is deemed credible.",
            "The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> He both <b>issues a warning to her based on two</b> witnesses, and he gives the bitter water to her to drink based on the testimony of two witnesses who saw her secluded. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehoshua?</b> The Gemara answers: The <b>verse states:</b> “And there is no witness [<i>ed</i>] <b>against her [<i>bah</i>]”</b> (Numbers 5:13), which was explained to mean there were not two witnesses, but only one, who testified concerning her defilement. Rabbi Yehoshua derives from the term <i>bah</i>, which could also be understood as: <b>With regard to it,</b> that in this matter of defilement one witness suffices, <b>but not with regard to</b> the <b>warning.</b> Additionally, he derives: <b>With regard to it, but not with regard to</b> the <b>seclusion.</b> Therefore, there must be two witnesses to testify about both the warning and the seclusion.",
            "The Gemara now explains Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion. <b>And Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that the only derivation to be learned is: <b>With regard to it, but not with regard to</b> the <b>warning.</b> Therefore, the warning, unlike the defilement, requires two witnesses. The seclusion is not contrasted with the defilement, and, like the defilement, requires only one.",
            "The Gemara questions Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that one should also derive: <b>With regard to it, but not with regard to</b> the <b>seclusion,</b> as does Rabbi Yehoshua? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Eliezer does not accept that derivation, as <b>seclusion is juxtaposed to defilement</b> by the verse, <b>as it is written: “And she was defiled secretly”</b> (Numbers 5:13), and the term “secretly” is referring to seclusion. Therefore, the same <i>halakha</i> should apply to both.",
            "The Gemara asks: But the <b>warning is also juxtaposed to defilement, as it is written: “And he warned his wife, and she had become defiled”</b> (Numbers 5:14) and the same <i>halakha</i> should apply to both. The Gemara answers: <b>The Merciful One excluded</b> at least one of the two by use of the expression <b><i>bah</i>,</b> which teaches that in one matter other than defilement, two witnesses are required.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And what did you see</b> to determine that the exclusion from the <i>halakha</i> of one witness sufficing is with regard to the warning? Perhaps the exclusion from the <i>halakha</i> of one witness sufficing is with regard to the seclusion. The Gemara answers: It <b>stands to reason</b> that it is <b>preferable</b> to compare <b>seclusion</b> to defilement, <b>as</b> testimony with regard to seclusion <b>forbids her</b> to her husband <b>just as</b> testimony with regard to <b>defilement</b> does.",
            "The Gemara rejects this reasoning: <b>On the contrary,</b> it is <b>preferable</b> to compare the <b>warning</b> to the defilement, <b>as</b> it is the <b>main cause</b> of <b>her</b> becoming forbidden. Seclusion alone, absent a warning, would not cause her to be forbidden to her husband.",
            "The Gemara counters: <b>If</b> there is <b>no seclusion, is there</b> any significance to the <b>warning?</b> The warning results in a prohibition only after the warned woman secludes herself with the man. The Gemara counters: <b>And if</b> there is <b>no warning, what effectiveness does seclusion have?</b> Both the warning and the seclusion are required for her to be forbidden.",
            "The Gemara concludes: <b>Even so,</b> it is <b>preferable</b> to compare the <b>seclusion</b> to the defilement, <b>as</b> the seclusion <b>is the beginning of defilement.</b> Therefore, just as the testimony of one witness suffices with regard to the defilement, the testimony of one witness suffices with regard to the seclusion.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>,</b> who presents a different version of Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:1) that <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer: One who issues a warning to his wife issues a warning based on one witness or based on his own</b> testimony, <b>and</b> he <b>gives</b> the bitter water to her <b>to drink based on</b> the testimony of <b>two</b> witnesses who saw her secluded. The <i>baraita</i> further states that <b>the Rabbis responded: According to the statement of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> as to Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion that one need not issue a warning in the presence of two witnesses, <b>there is no end to the matter,</b> as the Gemara will explain.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda? The verse states: “<i>Bah</i>,”</b> from which he infers that one witness suffices to testify <b>with regard to it,</b> i.e., the defilement, <b>but not with regard to seclusion,</b> as above.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that one should also derive: <b>With regard to it, but not with regard to</b> the <b>warning?</b> The Gemara answers: The <b>warning is juxtaposed to defilement, as it is written: “And he warned his wife, and she had become defiled”</b> (Numbers 5:14), and the same <i>halakha</i> should apply to both.",
            "The Gemara counters this argument: <b>Seclusion is also juxtaposed</b> in the verse <b>to defilement, as it is written: “And she was defiled secretly”</b> (Numbers 5:13). Therefore, the same <i>halakha</i> should apply to both. The Gemara responds: <b>That</b> verse <b>is coming to</b> teach <b>how much</b> is the <b>measure of seclusion,</b> i.e., the amount of time that the man and woman must be secluded together for it to be defined as seclusion, which, as the comparison indicates, is the amount of time <b>sufficient for defilement.</b>",
            "The Gemara continues to clarify the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Rabbis responded: According to the statement of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> as to Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion, <b>there is no end to the matter.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of: There is no end to the matter? The Gemara answers: It is <b>that</b> there may be <b>times when</b> the husband <b>did not warn</b> his wife <b>but</b> after hearing of her seclusion with another man <b>says: I warned her,</b> which will be sufficient to render her forbidden to him until she drinks.",
            "The Gemara is puzzled by this logic: <b>But according to our mishna, does the matter</b> in fact <b>have an end?</b> Rabbi Eliezer states in the mishna that a woman must drink the bitter water based upon her husband’s own statement that she secluded herself with the man about whom he had warned her. There too, one could ask whether there may be <b>times when she did not seclude herself</b> with the other man <b>and</b> where <b>her husband says: She secluded herself,</b> thereby rendering her forbidden to him until she drinks the bitter water. If so, why do the Rabbis take issue only with the version of Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion as presented by Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, and not with the version recorded in the mishna?",
            "<b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The Rabbis in the <i>baraita</i> meant to state that <b>even according to the statement of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, there is no end to the matter.</b> The Rabbis wished to say that even according to his version of Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion, the husband can cause her to drink if he were to lie. The same is obviously true for the mishna.",
            "The Gemara notes: The phrase <b>even according to the statement of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> indicates it is a lesser novelty to say that there is no end to the matter according to him, <b>and it is not necessary</b> to say that the same would be true <b>according to</b> the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer cited in <b>our mishna.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>On the contrary, according to</b> the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer cited in <b>our mishna,</b> there <b>is</b> a legitimate <b>basis</b> of suspicion with regard to the woman, as there are witnesses who saw the husband issue a warning to her, and therefore, it is understandable that the testimony of the husband may be relied upon when he testifies that she secluded herself with another man. By contrast, <b>there,</b> according to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, <b>there is no</b> legitimate <b>basis</b> to prohibit her to him, since there are no witnesses that she had been warned by her husband at all. Therefore, it may be that the Rabbis took issue only with the version of Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion presented by Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda.",
            "The Gemara clarifies the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>Rather, if it was stated, it was stated like this: Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that the Rabbis said: <b>According to the statement of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who is not concerned that accepting the testimony of one person with regard to the warning will enable false claims by the husband, <b>even according to</b> the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer cited in <b>our mishna there is no end to the matter,</b> since the concern there is less severe, as there is no legitimate basis to render her forbidden to her husband.",
            "<b>Rav Ḥanina of Sura says: In the present a man should not say to his wife: Do not seclude yourself with so-and-so.</b> The reason is that <b>perhaps we maintain</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that <b>a warning</b> is effective even <b>based on his own</b> testimony, <b>and</b> if she were then to <b>seclude herself</b> with that man she would be required to drink the bitter water to render herself permitted to her husband, <b>and</b> since <b>today</b> the bitter <b>water of a <i>sota</i></b> is <b>not</b> used <b>to evaluate her</b> fidelity and permit her to her husband, <b>he will</b> end up <b>forbidding her to himself</b> with <b>an irrevocable prohibition.</b>",
            "§ <b>Reish Lakish says: What</b> is the meaning of the <b>term: Warning [<i>kinnui</i>]?</b> It means <b>a matter that causes anger [<i>kina</i>] between her and others,</b> as other men will not understand why she does not wish to be friendly with them any longer. The Gemara comments: <b>Apparently, he holds</b> that <b>a warning</b> is effective <b>based on</b> the husband’s <b>own</b> testimony, <b>and</b> therefore <b>everyone else will not know that her husband issued a warning to her, and they will say: What is this</b> matter happening <b>before us that she separates herself</b> from us, <b>and they will come to act in anger with her.</b>",

What is the basis for anticipating the matter? <b>As he warned her</b> not to seclude herself with a specific man, <b>and she</b> nevertheless <b>secluded herself</b> with him, <b>and one witness testifies that she is defiled,</b> then the combination of her behavior and the testimony renders it reasonable to assume that she has in fact committed adultery.",
            "<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: But when the warning is written</b> in the Torah, <b>it is written</b> in the verse <b>after seclusion and defilement</b> are mentioned, indicating that the circumstance in which one witness is deemed credible with regard to defilement is even when there was no previous warning. The order in which the Torah describes the <i>sota</i> process seems to indicate that the husband’s warning is issued only after the wife already secluded herself with the other man and was defiled, as the verses state: “And a man lie with her carnally, and it was hidden from the eyes of her husband, and she was defiled secretly, and there is no witness against her, and she was not taken. And the spirit of jealousy came [<i>ve’avar</i>] upon him, and he warned his wife, and she had become defiled” (Numbers 5:13–14).",
            "Abaye <b>said to him</b> in response: That which the verse states: <b>“And</b> the spirit of jealousy <b>came [<i>ve’avar</i>]</b> upon him,” means: <b>And</b> it had <b>already come</b> upon him, that the husband warned his wife not to seclude herself with a specific man prior to her seclusion and defilement.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> that “<i>ve’avar</i>” is referring to a matter that already occurred, then in the case of the agreement between Moses and the tribes of Gad and Reuben before they entered Eretz Yisrael, where he stated: <b>“And every armed man of you will pass over [<i>ve’avar</i>]</b> the Jordan” (Numbers 32:21), <b>so too</b> did he mean that they had already crossed?

            "The Gemara answers: <b>There, from</b> the fact <b>that it is written: “And the land be subdued before the Lord, and you return afterward”</b> (Numbers 32:22), it is clear that it <b>teaches concerning the future.

            "<b>The Rabbis say: A spirit of impurity,</b> as one should not issue a warning to one’s wife. <b>Rav Ashi says: A spirit of purity,</b> as issuing a warning indicates that he will not tolerate promiscuous behavior.",

            "<b>Rava says</b> a different reason why a <i>sota</i> cannot enter into levirate marriage: This prohibition can be deduced through <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If,</b> due to the suspicion of adultery, <b>she becomes forbidden to the one who was</b> previously <b>permitted to her,</b> i.e., her first husband, then <b>with regard to one who was forbidden to her,</b> i.e., the husband’s brother, is it <b>not all the more so</b> that she remains forbidden to him?",

            "The Gemara refutes this inference. In the case of the High Priest, can one say: <b>She becomes forbidden? But</b> she <b>was forbidden</b> to him <b>and remains</b> forbidden to him. She did not become forbidden to her husband, the High Priest, due to the marriage. Furthermore, in the case of the High Priest, can one say: <b>Permitted to her? But</b> the High Priest <b>is forbidden to her</b> always. Therefore, the case of the High Priest does not serve as a refutation of the <i>a fortiori</i> inference.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the refutation is as follows: In the case of <b>a priest’s wife who was raped,</b> who becomes forbidden to her husband, <b>and</b> then her husband <b>dies; and he has a brother who is a priest disqualified due to flawed lineage [<i>ḥalal</i>],</b> who is not bound by the restrictions on marriage given to a priest, then <b>she should not</b> be permitted to <b>enter into levirate marriage</b> with him. <b>If she becomes forbidden to the one who was permitted to her,</b> i.e., her husband the priest, then <b>with regard to one who was forbidden to her,</b> i.e., her brother-in-law, is it <b>not all the more so</b> that she remains forbidden to him?",
            "The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, this <i>a fortiori</i> inference is not applicable here because <b>a raped</b> woman <b>is</b> completely <b>permitted to an Israelite.</b> Therefore, a married woman raped by another man may remain with her Israelite husband. <b>And with regard to this</b> person, i.e., the brother of the deceased, who is a <i>ḥalal</i>, <b>in any event there is no prohibition.</b> The fact that the woman was forbidden to her <i>ḥalal</i> brother-in-law while she was married to her husband is immaterial. This is because, had she been raped while she was married to the <i>ḥalal</i>, it would not render her forbidden to him, as he has the status of an Israelite with regard to marriage.

This final clause teaches that if the witnesses to the wife’s infidelity are found to be conspiring witnesses, then the meal-offering is transferred to non-sacred status even after it was already sanctified in a service vessel. This is difficult for Rav Pappa, for he said that in a similar case, where witnesses testified about her infidelity after the offering was sanctified, the Sages decreed that the offering should be burned, in order to prevent people from saying that a meal-offering that has been sanctified in a service vessel may be transferred afterward to non-sacred status.",
            "The Gemara refutes this objection: Do <b>you say</b> that one can question Rav Pappa’s statement from a ruling concerning <b>conspiring witnesses?</b> The cases are not comparable, as <b>conspiring witnesses generate publicity.</b> Since the circumstances of these cases are well publicized, everyone knows that the offering was sanctified in error.",

Noting that the phrase “but be clean,” is apparently redundant, the <i>baraita</i> explains: The usage of the word <b>“clean [<i>tehora</i>]”</b> in the verse indicates that only one who survived the drinking of the bitter water due to her fidelity will conceive a child, <b>but</b> this will <b>not</b> happen in a case <b>where</b> she did not die because <b>there are witnesses for her</b> in <b>a country overseas</b> who can testify that she engaged in sexual intercourse.",

If they discuss her having committed adultery, then it is considered public knowledge, and the bitter water would not evaluate her in that case, as evaluation is not needed.",
            "After citing this <i>baraita</i> as proof for the ruling of Rav Sheshet, albeit from a different source, the Gemara questions how Rabbi Shimon could deny the ability of the woman’s merit to delay the <i>sota</i> punishment due to fear that it will discredit the whole <i>sota</i> rite, being that there is another case that prevents the bitter water from evaluating a woman, i.e., where witnesses in a country overseas are able to testify. <b>And Rabbi Shimon, granted that he does not interpret</b> the letter <b><i>vav</i>,</b> as he holds that its addition is not significant, and therefore he holds that her merit does not delay her punishment, <b>but there is</b>"

Jochebed <b>was</b> then <b>130 years old and</b> the verse still <b>calls her a daughter?</b> Jochebed’s age is established based on a tradition concerning the number of the descendants of Jacob who came to Egypt, as follows: While the verse states that Leah had thirty-three descendants (Genesis 46:15), only thirty-two were enumerated. This was explained <b>as Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> The “daughter of Levi” <b>is Jochebed, whose conception was on the road,</b> as the family of Jacob descended to Egypt, <b>and she was born between the walls,</b> i.e., in Egypt, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And the name of Amram’s wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, <b>who was born to Levi in Egypt”</b> (Numbers 26:59).",
            "This interpolation concerning her birth is interpreted: <b>Her birth</b> was <b>in Egypt, but her conception was not in Egypt.</b> Since the Jewish people were in Egypt for two hundred ten years and Moses was eighty years old at the time of the exodus, Jochebed was one hundred thirty years old when Moses was born. In light of this, the Gemara is asking how the verse can refer to her as a daughter. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: The signs of a young woman were born in her</b> when her husband remarried her, and she became like a young girl again.",

            "The Gemara comments: The Pharaoh’s daughter said: <b>“This [<i>zeh</i>]</b> is one of the Hebrews’ children” (Exodus 2:6). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> This <b>teaches that she prophesied unknowingly,</b> as the intention of the word “<i>zeh</i>” was: <b>This</b> one <b>falls,</b> i.e., is cast, into the water, <b>but no other</b> will <b>fall</b> by means of water, for on that day Pharaoh’s decree was canceled.",

            "§ It states further in the mishna: <b>Who, to us,</b> had <b>a greater</b> burial <b>than Joseph,</b> as it was none other than Moses who involved himself in transporting his coffin. <b>The Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (4:6–7): <b>Come and see how beloved mitzvot are to Moses our teacher.

            "The Gemara assumes that according to Rabbi Ya’akov it is prohibited to erase the passage from a Torah scroll, since he holds that the scroll must be written for the sake of the <i>sota</i>, whereas Rabbi Yehuda, who permits this, holds that the scroll need not be written for the sake of the <i>sota</i>. <b>And</b> therefore, the opinions of <b>these <i>tanna’im</i> are parallel</b> to the opinions of <b>those <i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The scroll</b> of one <i>sota</i> <b>is not fit</b> to be used in the preparation of the water <b>to give</b> to <b>another <i>sota</i> to drink,</b> as it was not written for the sake of the other <i>sota</i>. <b>Rabbi Aḥai bar Yoshiya says: Her scroll is fit</b> to be used in the preparation of the water <b>to give</b> to <b>another <i>sota</i> to drink,</b> since it does not need to be written for the sake of the <i>sota</i>.",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>Does</b> the <b>merit of a mitzva protect</b> one <b>so much</b> as to delay her punishment? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Menaḥem bar Yosei interpreted this</b> verse <b>homiletically: “For the mitzva is a lamp and the Torah is light”</b> (Proverbs 6:23). <b>The verse associates the mitzva with a lamp and the Torah with</b> the <b>light</b> of the sun. <b>The mitzva</b> is associated <b>with a lamp</b> in order <b>to say to you: Just as a lamp does not protect</b> one by its light extensively but <b>only temporarily,</b> while the lamp is in one’s hand, <b>so too, a mitzva protects</b> one <b>only temporarily,</b> i.e., while one is performing the mitzva.",
            "<b>And the Torah</b> is associated <b>with light</b> in order <b>to say to you: Just as</b> the <b>light</b> of the sun <b>protects</b> one <b>forever, so too,</b> the <b>Torah</b> one studies <b>protects</b> one <b>forever; and it states</b> in the previous verse with regard to the Torah: <b>“When you walk, it shall lead you;</b> when you lie down, it shall watch over you; and when you awake, it shall talk with you” (Proverbs 6:22).

            "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> verse <b>did</b> Doeg and Ahithophel <b>interpret</b> incorrectly, causing them to err? They interpreted this verse: “For the Lord your God walks in the midst of your camp…to give up your enemies before you…<b>that He see no licentious matter in you,</b> and turn away from you” (Deuteronomy 23:15), to indicate that God turns away from one who engaged in forbidden relations, and since David had sinned with Bathsheba God must have turned away from him. <b>But they did not know that a transgression extinguishes</b> the merit of <b>a mitzva, but a transgression does not extinguish</b> the merit of the <b>Torah.</b>",

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that a betrothed woman and a widow awaiting her <i>yavam</i> do not drink the bitter water. The Gemara infers: <b>She does not drink, but</b> the husband or <i>yavam</i> <b>can warn her</b> against secluding herself with another man, and if she violates his warning, she is forbidden to him. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara answers: This is derived <b>as the Sages taught</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“Speak to the children of Israel and say</b> unto them: If the wife of any man goes astray, and acts unfaithfully against him” (Numbers 5:12). The superfluous phrase “and say unto them” is an amplification, and serves <b>to include a betrothed woman and a widow awaiting her <i>yavam</i> in</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>warning.</b>",
            "<b>And whose</b> opinion is expressed in the <b>mishna? It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yonatan, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And the priest shall cause her to swear, and shall say to the woman: If no man has lain with you, and if you have not gone aside to defilement <b>while under your husband”</b> (Numbers 5:19). This <b>excludes a betrothed woman,</b> who does not yet live with her betrothed, from the ritual of the bitter water. One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I exclude even a widow awaiting her <i>yavam</i>;</b> therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “If the wife of <b>any man</b> goes astray” (Numbers 5:12). The term “any man” serves to include a widow awaiting her <i>yavam</i> in the ritual of the bitter water. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yoshiya.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Yonatan says:</b> The phrase <b>“while under your husband” excludes a widow awaiting her <i>yavam</i></b> from drinking the bitter water. Lest one would say that <b>I will exclude a widow awaiting her <i>yavam</i> but I will not exclude a betrothed woman, the verse</b> therefore <b>states:</b> “This is the law of jealousy, <b>when a wife, while under her husband, goes astray,</b> and is defiled” (Numbers 5:29). The term “while under her husband” <b>excludes a betrothed woman</b> from drinking the bitter water.",
            "The Gemara explains the dispute: One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yonatan, holds that the bond with the <b>betrothed woman is stronger, as</b> it is <b>his</b> own <b>betrothal,</b> whereas in the case of a widow awaiting her <i>yavam</i>, the bond stems from his brother’s betrothal. <b>And</b> furthermore, if the betrothed woman commits adultery, she <b>is stoned due to</b> her bond with <b>him,</b> whereas a widow awaiting her <i>yavam</i> who engages in sexual intercourse with another man is liable only to receive lashes. Since the bond with the betrothed woman is stronger, Rabbi Yonatan derives from the phrase “while under your husband” that a widow awaiting her <i>yavam</i> is excluded with respect to the bitter water, whereas a betrothed woman is excluded only because of the phrase “and say unto them.”",
            "<b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoshiya, holds that the bond with the <b>widow awaiting her <i>yavam</i> is stronger, as she is not lacking entry into the wedding canopy,</b> as her marriage to the <i>yavam</i> is completed through sexual intercourse alone.

            "Furthermore, <b>on that same day Rabbi Akiva interpreted</b> the verses with regard to the Levite cities as follows: One verse states: <b>“And you shall measure outside the city for the east side two thousand cubits…</b>this shall be for them the open land outside the cities” (Numbers 35:5), <b>and another verse states:</b> “And the open land around the cities, which you shall give to the Levites, shall be <b>from the wall of the city and outward one thousand cubits round about”</b> (Numbers 35:4).",
            "<b>It is impossible to say</b> that the area around the cities given to the Levites was only <b>one thousand cubits, as it is already stated: “Two thousand cubits.” And it is impossible to say</b> that <b>two thousand cubits</b> were left for them, <b>as it is already stated: “One thousand cubits.” How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? <b>One thousand cubits</b> are to be set aside as <b>a tract</b> of open land surrounding the city, <b>and</b> the <b>two thousand cubits</b> are mentioned not in order to be given to the Levites, but to indicate the boundary of <b>the Shabbat limit,</b> beyond which it is forbidden to travel on Shabbat. This verse thereby serves as the source for the two-thousand-cubit Shabbat limit.",
            "<b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, says</b> otherwise: <b>One thousand cubits</b> were given to the Levites as an open <b>tract</b> of land, that could not be planted or built upon, <b>and two thousand cubits</b> of additional land were given to the Levites for planting <b>fields and vineyards.</b>",
            "Additionally, <b>on that same day Rabbi Akiva interpreted</b> the verse: <b>“Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to the Lord, and said, saying”</b> (Exodus 15:1), as follows: <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> the word <b>“saying,”</b> because it states the word “said” immediately prior to it, <b>why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> the word <b>“saying”? It teaches that the Jewish people would repeat in song after Moses every single statement</b> he said, <b>as</b> is done when <b>reciting <i>hallel</i>.</b> After Moses would recite a verse, they would say as a refrain: <b>“I will sing to the Lord, for He is highly exalted”</b> (Exodus 15:1). It is <b>for this</b> reason that the word <b>“saying” is stated,</b> in addition to the word “said.”",
            "<b>Rabbi Neḥemya says:</b> The people sang the song together with Moses <b>as</b> is done when <b>reciting <i>Shema</i>,</b> which is recited in unison after the prayer leader begins, <b>and not as</b> is done when <b>reciting <i>hallel</i>.</b>",
            "<b>On that same day Rabbi Yehoshua ben Hyrcanus taught: Job served the Holy One, Blessed be He, only out of love, as it is stated: “Though He will slay me, still I will trust in Him”</b> (Job 13:15). <b>And still, the matter is even,</b> i.e., the verse is ambiguous, as there are two possible interpretations of the verse. Was Job saying: <b>I will await Him,</b> expressing his yearning for God; <b>or</b> should the verse be interpreted as saying <b>I will not await</b> Him. As the word “lo” can mean either “to him” or “not,” it is unclear which meaning is intended here. This dilemma is resolved elsewhere, where <b>the verse states</b> a clearer indication of Job’s intent: <b>“Till I die I will not put away my integrity from me”</b> (Job 27:5).

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And from where does Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi derive the principle in the mishna that <b>just as the water evaluates</b> whether <b>she</b> was unfaithful, <b>so</b> too, <b>it evaluates</b> whether <b>he</b> committed the sin?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, that the verse: <b>“And cause the belly to swell and the thigh to fall away”</b> (Numbers 5:22), is referring to <b>the belly and thigh of the paramour.</b> Do <b>you say</b> that the intention is <b>the belly and the thigh of the paramour, or is it only the belly and the thigh of the adulteress?

The reason people might claim this is that the priest says to the woman: “The Lord will make you a curse and an oath among your people, when the Lord makes your thigh fall away, and your belly swell” (Numbers 5:21). This seems to imply that her thigh is supposed to be afflicted before her belly. Therefore, when her belly swells first, people might conclude that it is not due to the water.

            "<b>Or alternatively,</b> perhaps <b>he accepts</b> the opinion that the <i>halakha</i> derived from “and is defiled” should be similar to the prohibitions involving the husband and paramour, but nevertheless, in certain instances with regard to <b>a matter that can be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, the <b>verse</b> nevertheless <b>takes the trouble and writes</b> explicitly.

            "However, <b>say the latter clause</b> of the verse: <b>“And as for the flesh, every one that is pure may eat the flesh”</b> (Leviticus 7:19), which would seem to indicate that specifically one who is <b>pure</b> for <b>certain is</b> one <b>who shall eat meat, but</b> one for whom it is <b>uncertain</b> whether he is <b>impure and uncertain</b> whether he is <b>pure shall not eat.</b> The two clauses in the verse seem to contradict one another with regard to the status of uncertain purity.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from it</b> that the Torah differentiates between two different types of uncertainty? <b>Here,</b> the latter clause, which discusses “every one that is pure,” is referring to an entity <b>that has awareness</b> in order for it <b>to be asked,</b> e.g., a person, who is considered impure if he is uncertain whether he contracted ritual impurity. <b>There,</b> the former clause which discusses impure meat presents the principle of an entity <b>that lacks awareness</b> in order for it <b>to be asked,</b> where an uncertain case of ritual impurity is deemed pure.",
            "The Gemara explains the need for two separate derivations concerning uncertain contractions of ritual impurity: <b>And</b> the derivation <b>that Rav Giddel</b> said that <b>Rav said was necessary, and</b> it <b>was</b> also <b>necessary to derive</b> the principle of uncertain ritual impurity <b>from <i>sota</i>; since if</b> it were derived only <b>through</b> the derivation <b>of Rav, I would say</b> that it makes no difference <b>whether</b> the uncertain contraction of impurity occurred <b>in the private domain or whether</b> it occurred <b>in the public domain.</b> Therefore, it <b>was necessary to derive from <i>sota</i></b> that uncertain impurity is considered impure only in the private domain.",
            "<b>And if</b> it is derived only <b>from <i>sota</i>, I would say</b> that similar to <i>sota</i>, where both the woman and the paramour possess awareness in order to be asked if they committed the act, so too, items with uncertain impurity should not be deemed impure <b>unless there is awareness</b> on the part of both <b>the one who touches</b> the impure item <b>and the one who causes him to touch,</b> i.e., the agent of impurity and the recipient of impurity are both competent people. Therefore, the derivation of Rav was <b>necessary,</b> as it teaches that in an uncertain case of impurity in the private domain, one is deemed impure even if only the contractor of impurity possesses the awareness to be asked.",

            "<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai maintained that although <b>it has no</b> explicit basis <b>from</b> a verse in <b>the Torah, it has</b> proof for its impurity <b>through an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: If</b> even <b>one who immersed</b> in a ritual bath <b>that day</b> and will become completely purified after nightfall, <b>who is</b> therefore <b>permitted to</b> touch <b>non-sacred</b> articles, i.e., he does not transmit impurity to them, <b>disqualifies <i>teruma</i></b> that he touches, then with regard to <b>a loaf</b> that has <b>second-</b>degree impurity as result of contact with an impure item of the first degree, <b>which is disqualified,</b> i.e., it is rendered impure, even if it is <b>non-sacred, isn’t it logical that it should impart third-</b>degree impurity <b>upon <i>teruma</i>?</b>",

            "The Gemara continues to challenge the inference: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about</b> the impurity of <b>one who immersed that day</b> who was rendered impure <b>through</b> contact with <b>a creeping animal is that</b> this impurity can apply to either a person or a utensil, as people and utensils are capable of achieving purity through immersion, and <b>within its type</b> there can be <b>a primary source of impurity.</b> A loaf, however, is food, which can never be a primary source of impurity. It can only be rendered impure as a secondary source of impurity.",
            "The Gemara answers: The <i>halakhot</i> of <b>an earthenware vessel can prove</b> that the fact that there are primary sources of impurity within its type is not a relevant factor.

            "The Gemara challenges: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about an earthenware vessel is that</b> unlike a loaf, it <b>can render</b> items <b>impure</b> or it can itself become impure <b>from its airspace.</b> An earthenware vessel is the only vessel that does not require direct contact with another item in order to contract or transfer impurity, but can effect or contract impurity through its airspace.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>One who immersed that day can prove</b> that being able to render items impure through airspace is not a relevant factor. Such an item disqualifies <i>teruma</i>, but imparts impurity only through direct contact and not through its airspace.",

            "As, the mishna <b>should have</b> said in its place: The <b>verse states:</b> “She was defiled secretly and there was no witness [<i>ed</i>] <b>against her [<i>bah</i>]”</b> (Numbers 5:13), which is explained to mean there were not two witnesses, but only one, who testified concerning her defilement. One can infer from the term “<i>bah</i>,” which could also be understood as: <b>With regard to it,</b> that in this matter of defilement one witness suffices, <b>but not with regard to</b> the <b>warning.</b> Additionally, one can infer: <b>With regard to it, but not with regard to</b> the <b>seclusion.</b> Therefore, there must be two witnesses to testify about both the warning and seclusion.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>That is also what</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>is saying.</b> The source for the <i>halakha</i> that there is a requirement for two witnesses to testify about the seclusion is that <b>the verse states: With regard to it,</b> that in this matter of defilement one witness suffices, <b>but not with regard to</b> the <b>warning. With regard to it, but not with regard to</b> the <b>seclusion.</b>",
            "The Gemara continues to explain the mishna: <b>And</b> concerning <b>an ordinary</b> accusation of <b>defilement without a</b> previous <b>warning and without</b> an act of <b>seclusion</b> with another man, <b>from where do we</b> derive that <b>a single witness is not deemed credible?</b> It is for this <i>halakha</i> that the mishna cites the verbal analogy: <b>It is stated here:</b> “Because he has found some unseemly <b>matter [<i>davar</i>]</b> in her” (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>and it is stated there</b> concerning monetary matters: “At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall <b>a matter [<i>davar</i>]</b> be established” (Deuteronomy 19:15). <b>Just as</b> the “matter” stated <b>there</b> with regard to monetary matters is clarified specifically <b>by</b> the testimony of <b>two witnesses, so too, here</b> with regard to adultery the “matter” of her defilement must be established <b>by</b> the testimony of at least <b>two witnesses.</b>",
            "§ The mishna taught: If one <b>witness says: She was defiled,</b> and another witness says: She was not defiled, she drinks the bitter water of a <i>sota</i>. The Gemara infers from this statement in the mishna that <b>the reason</b> the woman would drink the bitter water in this case is specifically <b>because</b> the second witness <b>refutes his</b> testimony, <b>but if</b> a second witness <b>did not refute his testimony,</b> then <b>a single witness</b> would be <b>relied upon</b> in this case and the woman would be forbidden to her husband forever.",
            "<b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in reference to the verse describing the circumstances in which a woman defiled through an act of adultery becomes prohibited to her husband, which states: “And a man lie with her carnally…<b>and there be no witness [<i>ed</i>] against her”</b> (Numbers 5:13); <b>the verse is speaking of</b> a lack of <b>two</b> witnesses. When the verse refers to the lack of an <i>ed</i>, written in the singular, it actually indicates that there are not two witnesses against her, but only one, as the <i>baraita</i> will now explain.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues and asks: Do <b>you say</b> that the verse refers <b>only</b> to a case where there was not <b>even one</b> witness to the act of sexual intercourse, as the singular usage of the word <i>ed</i> would seem to indicate? The <i>baraita</i> now proves that the singular usage notwithstanding, elsewhere the word <i>ed</i> is used to indicate two witnesses, as <b>the verse states: “One witness [<i>ed</i>] shall not rise up against a man</b> for any iniquity or any sin that he sins; at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established” (Deuteronomy 19:15).",
            "The <i>baraita</i> infers a general principle from this verse by asking: <b>By inference from that</b> which <b>is stated</b> in the verse, even with the omission of the word “one”: <b>“A witness shall not rise up</b> against a man” (Deuteronomy 19:15), <b>do I not know that it is</b> referring to <b>one</b> witness, as the verse is written in the singular form? <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> explicitly: <b>“One</b> witness,” being that it is obviously referring to only one witness? The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>This established a paradigm</b> for the principle that <b>every place</b> where the word <b>“witness [<i>ed</i>]” is stated</b> in the Torah without specifying a number, <b>there are two</b> witnesses <b>here, until the verse specifies</b> that it is referring to only one witness, by writing the word <b>“one.”</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> returns to discuss the verse concerning a <i>sota</i>. <b>And the Merciful One states:</b> “There was no witness [<i>ed</i>] against her,” which therefore means that: <b>There are not two</b> witnesses to the sexual intercourse that could testify <b>with regard to her, rather</b> there is only <b>one</b> witness. The <i>baraita</i> completes its interpretation: Further in the verse it states: <b>“And she was not taken in the act”</b> (Numbers 5:13), indicating that the verse is referring to a case in which it is known that the woman had not been raped. This knowledge is based on the testimony of only one witness, as the verse had already stated that there were not two witnesses, and since one witness saw her willingly engage in sexual intercourse with another man, <b>she is forbidden</b> to her husband.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But since</b> the <i>baraita</i> taught <b>that by Torah law one witness is deemed credible</b> to state that the woman is defiled, <b>how can the other</b> witness who denies the wife’s infidelity <b>refute him</b> with his conflicting testimony and enable the woman to drink the bitter water instead of becoming forbidden outright to her husband? <b>But doesn’t Ulla say: Wherever the Torah relies on one witness, there is</b> the equivalent of the testimony of <b>two</b> witnesses <b>here.</b> Consequently, the testimony of the contradicting witness should be insignificant, as <b>the statement of one</b> witness <b>has no</b> standing <b>in a place where</b> it is contradicted by <b>two</b> witnesses, for the witness testifying about her infidelity is deemed credible as if two witnesses had testified.",
            "<b>Rather, Ulla said: Teach</b> the mishna in the following way: If one witness says: She was defiled, and another witness says: She was not defiled, <b>she would not drink</b> the bitter water. <b>And likewise, Rabbi Yitzḥak said: She would not drink. But Rabbi Ḥiyya says</b> in line with the standard text of the mishna: <b>She would drink</b> the bitter water even in the case of a contradiction between two single witnesses with regard to her infidelity.",
            "The Gemara asks: But <b>for Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> how will he respond to the same <b>difficulty</b> due to the teaching <b>of Ulla,</b> who explained that when a single witness is deemed credible he is considered as two and cannot be contradicted by a single witness to the contrary? The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult: Here,</b> the mishna is discussing a case where both witnesses arrived in court and testified <b>simultaneously,</b> thereby canceling each other out. But <b>there,</b> Ulla’s principle, that whenever a single witness’s testimony is accepted it is considered as two and cannot be contradicted by a single witness testifying to the contrary, is referring to a case <b>in which</b> the two conflicting witnesses came to court and testified <b>one after the other.</b>",
            "But <b>we learned</b> in the mishna above that if <b>one witness says: She was defiled, and two say: She was not defiled, she would drink</b> the bitter water. The Gemara deduces from here: The implications of this statement are that the woman drinks only because the testimony of the incriminating witness was contradicted by two witnesses, <b>but</b> if there was <b>one</b> witness saying she was defiled <b>and</b> only <b>one</b> witness saying the opposite, <b>she would not drink;</b> this is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ḥiyya.</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> could have <b>said to you: And according to your reasoning</b> that she would not drink, <b>say the latter clause</b> of the mishna, which states: If <b>two</b> witnesses <b>say: She was defiled, and one says: She was not defiled,</b> the testimony of the two witnesses is accepted and <b>she would not drink</b> the bitter water. <b>But</b> you should deduce from here that if there was <b>one</b> witness testifying to her defilement <b>and one</b> witness stating the opposite, <b>she would drink</b> the bitter water. This inference is in line with Rabbi Ḥiyya’s explanation, and contradicts the inference from the previous clause.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>Rather,</b> the correct understanding is that <b>the entire</b> mishna is not dealing with valid witnesses, and stating an obvious <i>halakha</i> in order to enable an inference, but <b>with</b> people who are <b>disqualified</b> from giving <b>testimony,</b> and is teaching us a novel ruling. <b>And</b> the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Neḥemya. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta Yevamot</i> 14:1) that <b>Rabbi Neḥemya says: Wherever the Torah relies on one witness, follow the majority of opinions.</b> In other words, if the testimonies of two disqualified witnesses conflict, the court rules in accordance with the version supported by more witnesses, whether or not they are qualified to testify. <b>And</b> the Sages <b>established</b> that the testimony of <b>two women,</b> who are usually disqualified from testifying, when they testify in opposition to <b>one man,</b> should be <b>like</b> that of <b>two men against one man,</b> and the court will rule in accordance with the testimony of the two women.",
            "<b>And some say</b> that Rabbi Neḥemya actually stated something different: <b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> a different version of Rabbi Neḥemya’s approach: <b>Anywhere that one valid witness came initially, even one hundred women</b> who later contradict him <b>are considered like one</b> witness, and do not override his testimony."

            "<b>And with what are we dealing here</b> in the mishna? A case <b>where a woman,</b> who is generally disqualified from bearing witness, <b>came initially,</b> and testified that the woman committed adultery, and two witnesses say that she did not.",
            "<b>And</b> according to this interpretation you must <b>amend the</b> statement <b>of Rabbi Neḥemya</b> so that it reads <b>like this: Rabbi Neḥemya says: Wherever the Torah relies on one witness, follow the majority of opinions.

            "The Gemara poses a question on these two interpretations of the mishna: <b>And why do I</b> need <b>two</b> cases in the mishna to teach the <i>halakha</i> that the majority opinion of <b>those disqualified from</b> bearing <b>witness</b> is followed? The Gemara explains: It is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>when we follow the majority opinion</b> in the case of invalid witnesses, this is <b>to be stringent</b> to force the woman to drink the bitter water, e.g., if one witness said that she committed adultery and two said that she did not, <b>but to be lenient</b> and absolve her from having to drink the water we do <b>not</b> follow the majority opinion, and she would still drink the water even if there is one witness saying that she did not commit adultery, therefore the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that there is no difference in this regard, and the majority opinion is followed in any case.",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, what</b> is meant by the phrase: <b>“And the half of them</b> facing Mount Ebal” (Joshua 8:33)? It is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The use of the definitive article in the verse indicates that the smaller half of the Jewish people was on Mount Ebal. <b>The half that was facing Mount Gerizim was larger than the half on Mount Ebal, because</b> the tribe of <b>Levi</b> was included in the group that was facing Mount Gerizim, and they remained <b>on the bottom</b> between the two mountains.",
            "The Gemara is puzzled by this statement: <b>On the contrary, because</b> the tribe of <b>Levi</b> remained <b>on the bottom they were fewer</b> in number.

            "The Gemara explains that Joshua <b>said to them: Go and hide yourselves in the forests, so that the evil eye will not have dominion over you,</b> as you are such a large number of people. The tribe of Joseph <b>said to him: The evil eye does not have dominion over the offspring of Joseph, as it is written: “Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine by a fountain”</b> (Genesis 49:22), <b>and Rabbi Abbahu says: Do not read</b> the verse as saying: <b>“By a fountain [<i>alei ayin</i>]”; rather,</b> read it as: <b>Those who rise above</b> the evil <b>eye [<i>olei ayin</i>],</b> teaching that Joseph and his descendants are not susceptible to the evil eye.",
            "The Gemara cites an alternative source for the assertion that the evil eye holds no sway over Joseph and his descendants: <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said</b> that it is derived <b>from here:</b> Jacob blessed Joseph’s children and said: <b>“And let them grow [<i>veyidgu</i>] into a multitude in the midst of the earth”</b> (Genesis 48:16). <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>fish [<i>dagim</i>] in the sea, waters cover them and the</b> evil <b>eye</b> therefore <b>has no dominion over them, so too,</b> with regard to <b>Joseph’s descendants, the</b> evil <b>eye has no dominion over them.</b>",

            "The verse continues: <b>“And there was none of the men of the house</b> there within” (Genesis 39:11).

            "<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Is it so that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov disagrees</b> only <b>with regard to a king and a High Priest,</b> contending that they too must be present at the measurement, <b>but</b> that <b>with regard to the Sanhedrin he holds either in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> that five Elders are needed <b>or in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> that three suffice? <b>Or, perhaps he also disagrees with regard to the Sanhedrin</b> and claims that the ritual is not performed <b>unless there is the entire Sanhedrin</b> participating.",
            "<b>Rav Yosef said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a rebellious Elder found</b> the Sanhedrin not in the Hewn Chamber, which was their usual place, but <b>in Beit Pagei,</b> near Jerusalem, <b>and he rebelled against them</b> there, by teaching in opposition to their ruling, one <b>might</b> have thought <b>his rebellion should be</b> considered <b>a rebellion,</b> rendering him liable to punishment. <b>The verse</b> therefore <b>states: “And you shall arise and go up to the place”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:8), which <b>teaches that</b> it is <b>the place</b> where the Sanhedrin resides that <b>causes</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a rebellious Elder to take effect.",
            "The Gemara analyzes this statement: In this case, <b>how many</b> members of the Sanhedrin were there <b>who went out</b> to Beit Pagei? <b>If we say that</b> only <b>a minority of them went out,</b> why should he be considered a rebellious Elder? <b>Perhaps those</b> judges <b>who are inside</b> the Hewn Chamber <b>hold in accordance with his</b> opinion, which would mean that the Elder in question ruled with the majority. <b>Rather,</b> it <b>is obvious that they all went out.</b>",
            "The assumption that they all went out leads to the following question: <b>And for what</b> purpose did they all leave the Hewn Chamber? <b>If</b> it was <b>for an optional matter, may they leave? But isn’t it written: “Your navel [<i>shorerekh</i>] is like a round goblet, let no mingled wine be wanting”</b> (Song of Songs 7:3). This verse is interpreted as referring to the Sanhedrin, the ministers [<i>sarei</i>] of Israel who sit in a semicircle, like half of a round goblet. The words “let no mingled wine be wanting” teach <b>that if one of</b> the great Sanhedrin <b>needed to leave,</b> then <b>if there are</b> still present in the Hewn Chamber <b>twenty-three</b> members, <b>corresponding</b> to the number of <b>a lesser Sanhedrin, he may leave; and if not, he may not leave.</b> This indicates that it is prohibited for the entire Sanhedrin to leave for an optional matter.",
            "<b>Rather</b> it <b>is obvious</b> that they left <b>for a matter of a mitzva. For what</b> particular mitzva did they venture out? <b>Is it not for the measurement</b> associated <b>with</b> the ritual of <b>the heifer, and it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov?</b> This would prove that Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov holds that the entire Sanhedrin goes out to measure the distance from the corpse to the nearby cities. <b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>No,</b> this is not a proof, as <b>perhaps</b> they went out for a different mitzva, <b>to expand the city</b> of Jerusalem <b>or the courtyards</b> of the Temple, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 2a): <b>They may expand</b> the sanctified area of <b>the city</b> of Jerusalem <b>or</b> of <b>the</b> Temple <b>courtyards only with the court of seventy-one.</b>",
            "It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Yosef,</b> that Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov disagrees even with regard to the number of judges: If the rebellious Elder <b>found</b> the Sanhedrin <b>in Beit Pagei and rebelled against them, for example, if they went out for the measurement</b> of the ritual <b>of the heifer or to expand</b> the area of <b>the city or</b> that of <b>the courtyards,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>his rebellion should be a rebellion.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the requirement to follow the rulings of the Sanhedrin: <b>“And you shall arise and go up to the place”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:8). This <b>teaches that the place causes</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a rebellious Elder to take effect, indicating that the entire Sanhedrin participates in the measurement of the distance from the corpse to the cities.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: If the corpse <b>was found concealed in a pile</b> of stones <b>or hanging on a tree,</b> they would not perform the ritual of the heifer. The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that the mishna is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda and not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> that sheaves of grain forgotten in the fields must be left for the poor: <b>“And you forget a sheaf in the field”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:19). This <b>excludes a concealed</b> sheaf; it is not considered forgotten and it may be collected by the owner, even if he did forget it. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. And the Rabbis say:</b> The phrase <b>“in the field”</b> serves <b>to include the concealed</b> sheaves, and these must be left for the poor. Rabbi Yehuda holds, like the ruling in the mishna here, that when the verse states “in the field” it excludes a concealed corpse.",
            "<b>Rav said: You</b> can <b>even say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> as <b>here</b> they expound the <i>halakha</i> <b>based on the context of the verse,</b> and <b>there</b> too they expound the <i>halakha</i> <b>based on the context of the verse.</b>",
            "In this case, <b>as it is written: “If one be found slain”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:1), the default assumption is that the <i>halakha</i> applies no matter <b>where it is found.</b> When the verse then states: <b>“In the ground,”</b> it must be serving to <b>exclude</b> a matter, i.e., <b>a concealed</b> corpse. <b>And</b> similarly, <b>there,</b> in the case of forgotten sheaves, they also expound <b>based on the context of the verse, as it is written: “When you reap your harvest in your field, and you forget a sheaf”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:19). This indicates that <b>forgotten</b> sheaves <b>are similar to</b> those <b>of</b> the <b>harvest: Just as</b> the <b>harvest</b> is performed <b>with revealed</b> objects, i.e., the growing grain, <b>so too,</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>forgetting</b> pertain <b>to revealed</b> sheaves. Consequently, when <b>the Merciful One writes</b> in the Torah <b>“in the field,”</b> it must be in order <b>to include the concealed</b> sheaves.",
            "In light of this explanation, the Gemara asks: <b>According to Rabbi Yehuda as well, let him derive</b> that covered sheaves are not included <b>from</b> the fact that <b>forgotten</b> sheaves <b>are similar to</b> those <b>of</b> the <b>harvest.</b> Why does he have to derive it from the words “in the field”? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is indeed so,</b> he does not derive that <i>halakha</i> from the phrase “in the field.”",
            "The Gemara therefore inquires: <b>But</b> then <b>why do I</b> need the phrase <b>“in the field,”</b> which indicates either an exclusion or an inclusion? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires</b> it in order <b>to include the forgotten</b> stalks <b>of standing</b> grain. Produce that one forgot to reap is considered forgotten, even if it is still attached to the ground. The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis, from where</b> do they learn the <i>halakha</i> of <b>forgotten</b> stalks <b>of standing</b> grain? The Gemara answers: <b>They derive</b> it <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“When you reap your harvest in your field,</b> and you forget,” which indicates that the <i>halakha</i> includes one who forgot to harvest part of his field.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what does <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> derive from this verse? The Gemara answers: It is <b>necessary for him</b> in order <b>to</b> learn <b>that which Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> says, <b>as Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> This verse <b>excludes sheaves that floated</b> through the air from his field <b>into another’s field.</b> Such sheaves are not classified as forgotten and may be retrieved later by the owner. <b>And the Rabbis,</b> from where do they derive this <i>halakha</i>? They derive it <b>from</b> the fact that the verse could have stated: <b>In the field,</b> but instead states <b>“in your field,”</b> to include sheaves situated only in one’s own field. The Gemara continues to ask: <b>And</b> what does <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> learn from this phrase? The Gemara answers: <b>He does not learn</b> anything from the difference between: <b>In the field,</b> and <b>“in your field,”</b> as he holds it is not a significant difference.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma:</b> If <b>sheaves floated into his field,</b> i.e., if one sheaf landed on another sheaf or on another item, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is the <b>airspace of a field considered to be like</b> it is the <b>field</b> itself, in which case one sheaf on top of another meets the legal requirements to be deemed forgotten? <b>Or,</b> is it <b>not considered like</b> the <b>field,</b> in which case one sheaf on top of another does not meet the legal requirements to be deemed forgotten?",
            "<b>Rav Kahana said to Rav Pappi, and some say Rav Kahana</b> said it <b>to Rav Zevid: Let him resolve</b> the dilemma <b>from</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Abbahu,</b> who <b>says that Rabbi Elazar says:</b> This <b>excludes sheaves that floated into another’s field.</b> If they floated into <b>another’s field, yes,</b> Rabbi Elazar said that they are not deemed forgotten, <b>but</b> if they floated <b>into his</b> own <b>field,</b> they are <b>not</b> discussed by Rabbi Elazar, and therefore they are deemed forgotten.",
            "The Gemara refutes this proof: <b>And according to your reasoning</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of the <i>baraita</i> is limited to the case stated, one could infer: In a case where the sheaves drifted <b>into another’s field,</b> then if <b>they were floating, yes,</b> they are not deemed to be forgotten, but if <b>they were resting</b> directly on the ground in another’s field, <b>no,</b> they are deemed to be forgotten. <b>But</b> this cannot be the <i>halakha</i>, as <b>we require</b> the sheaves to be <b>“in your field,” and</b> these sheaves are <b>not</b> in his field.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> you must admit that the words: <b>Into another’s field,</b> include not only those sheaves which are lying on other items, <b>but even</b> those <b>resting</b> directly on the ground. <b>And</b> the reason <b>that</b> Rabbi Abbahu <b>states: Floated,</b> is that <b>you find</b> a situation where sheaves end up in the field of another <b>only in</b> a case where <b>they floated</b> through the air and fell there. Since the term floated was not used to teach a <i>halakha</i>, no inference can be made from this <i>baraita</i> with regard to sheaves that floated in one’s own field.",
            "The Gemara again attempts to resolve the dilemma: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Pe’a</i> 3:7): In the case of <b>a sheaf that had been held</b> by its owner in order <b>to take it to the city, and he placed it on top of another</b> sheaf, <b>and he forgot</b> both sheaves, <b>the lower</b> sheaf is deemed to be <b>a forgotten sheaf, and the upper one is not</b> deemed to be <b>a forgotten sheaf. Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon: Both of them are not</b> deemed to be <b>forgotten sheaves; the lower one because it is concealed, and the upper one because it is floating</b> and not directly touching the field. The Gemara points out: <b>They disagree only with regard to</b> the <b>lower</b> sheaf, <b>but with regard to</b> the <b>upper</b> one <b>all agree</b> that <b>it is not</b> deemed <b>a forgotten sheaf.</b> This demonstrates that a sheaf located in the airspace of the field is not deemed to be forgotten.",
            "The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>There it is different, as, since</b> the owner <b>had held it</b> to take it to the city, <b>he acquired it.</b> The reason it is not deemed to be a forgotten sheaf is not because it is not touching the field but because the owner had already acquired that particular sheaf before forgetting it. The Gemara raises an objection to this explanation: <b>If so, why specifically</b> state the case of a sheaf that was placed <b>on top of another? The same would hold true</b> in a case where one put the sheaf down directly <b>in the field as well,</b> as he has already acquired it. The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is indeed so, and</b> the reason <b>that</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: On top of another,</b> is <b>due to the lower</b> sheaf rather than the upper one, in order to teach the dispute concerning the lower sheaf.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>said: Because it is floating.</b> How can one then say that the reason for his ruling is because the owner of the field has acquired it? The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> instead: <b>Because it is like</b> it is <b>floating.</b> In other words, it is as though the upper sheaf had not been put down at all, but remains in the owner’s hands.",
            "The Gemara tells of a related incident. On one occasion <b>Abaye said: I am hereby</b> as sharp and expert <b>as ben Azzai,</b> who taught Torah <b>in the markets of Tiberias,</b> and am ready to answer any question that might be posed to me. <b>One of the Sages said to Abaye,</b> with regard to the ritual of the heifer whose neck is broken: If there were <b>two slain people</b> found <b>one on top of the other</b> not precisely aligned, <b>from where does one measure</b> the distance to the surrounding cities?",
            "The various aspects of the dilemma are as follows: <b>Is a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance</b> considered to be <b>concealed, and is a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance not</b> considered to be <b>floating,</b> which would mean that the lower, concealed corpse is ignored because one does not measure the distance from a concealed corpse, as taught in the mishna, <b>and one measures</b> the distance <b>from the upper one? Or perhaps a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance is</b> considered to be <b>floating, and a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance is not</b> considered to be <b>concealed, and he measures</b> the distance <b>from the lower one,</b> because it is not considered to be concealed, but not from the upper one, which is considered to be floating.",
            "<b>Or perhaps a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance is</b> considered to be <b>concealed, and a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance is</b> considered to be <b>floating, and he</b> therefore <b>does not measure</b> the distance <b>from the lower one nor does he measure</b> the distance <b>from the upper one.</b> According to this last option, in such a situation no measuring is done, and the ritual is not performed.",
            "Abaye <b>said to him:</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>You learned it</b> in the <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Pe’a</i> 3:7): In the case of <b>a sheaf that had been held</b> by its owner in order <b>to take it to the city, and he placed it on top of another</b> sheaf, <b>and he forgot</b> both sheaves, <b>the lower</b> sheaf is deemed to be <b>a forgotten sheaf, and the upper one is not</b> deemed to be <b>a forgotten sheaf.

            "The Gemara continues Abaye’s statement: <b>What, is it not</b> the case <b>that they disagree about this, as</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon, <b>holds</b> that <b>a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance is</b> considered to be <b>concealed,</b> and therefore the lower sheaf is not deemed to be a forgotten sheaf, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that <b>it is not</b> considered to be <b>concealed,</b> which means it is deemed to be a forgotten sheaf. The same dispute would apply to the two corpses.",
            "The Gemara refutes this claim: <b>No, if they hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> then it could be <b>that everyone agrees</b> that <b>a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance is</b> considered to be <b>concealed,</b> and they would maintain this with regard to the two corpses as well. <b>And here they disagree with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute of Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis,</b> in <b>that</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> of this <i>baraita</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> there, which claims that the <i>halakha</i> of a forgotten sheaf applies even to a concealed sheaf, <b>and Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda</b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who maintains that a concealed sheaf is exempt from the <i>halakha</i> of forgotten sheaves.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> that is <b>so,</b> that their dispute is with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of concealed sheaves, <b>why</b> did they <b>specifically</b> disagree in the case of a sheaf that was <b>on top of another</b> sheaf; <b>the same would hold true even</b> in a case where the sheaf was concealed <b>in dirt and pebbles?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is indeed so.</b> They disagree with regard to all concealed sheaves, <b>and</b> their dispute is stated with regard to a case of one sheaf on top of another in order <b>to convey to you the far-reaching</b> nature of the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that <b>even a substance</b> that is in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance is</b> considered <b>concealed.</b> Therefore, a substance concealed in a different type of matter is all the more so considered concealed.",
            "§ The Gemara returns to discuss when the ritual of breaking the neck of the heifer is performed. <b>The Sages taught,</b> expounding the verse “If one be found slain in the land which the Lord your God has given you to possess it, lying in the field” (Deuteronomy 21:1): <b>“Slain”</b> indicates one killed by a sword, <b>but not</b> one who was <b>strangled; “slain,” but not</b> one who was found <b>twitching</b> in his death throes; <b>“in the land,” but not concealed in a pile</b> of stones; <b>“lying,” but not hanging on a tree; “in the field,” but not floating on the surface of the water. Rabbi Elazar says: In all these</b> cases, <b>if</b> a person <b>was slain</b> by the sword, the judges <b>break the neck</b> of the heifer, and it does not matter where the corpse was found.",
            "<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda says</b> that the Sages <b>said to Rabbi Elazar: Do you not concede that if he was strangled and left in a garbage</b> heap, <b>that they do not break the</b> heifer’s <b>neck? Apparently, “slain”</b> is a precise term that means slain <b>but not strangled.</b> If you accept that, <b>here too</b> the words <b>“in the land”</b> should indicate: In the land, <b>but not concealed in a pile</b> of stones; <b>“fallen”</b> should indicate: Fallen <b>but not hanging on a tree;</b> and <b>“in the field”</b> should indicate in the field <b>but not floating on the surface of the water. And Rabbi Elazar</b> holds that those other situations are not excluded, and that because in that first case the Torah <b>writes “slain” an extra</b> time in the next verse: “About him that is slain” (Deuteronomy 21:2), this repetition teaches that a victim of strangulation is not included in this <i>halakha</i>.",
            "§ The mishna taught: If a corpse <b>was found close to the border</b> of the country <b>or</b> close <b>to a city in which the majority</b> of its inhabitants <b>are gentiles,</b> the judges would not break the heifer’s neck, <b>as it is written: “If one be found</b> slain” (Deuteronomy 21:1). This <b>excludes</b> places where murdered bodies <b>are</b> commonly <b>found,</b> such as the aforementioned locations.",
            "The mishna taught: <b>Or</b> if the victim was discovered close <b>to a city that is without</b> a rabbinical <b>court</b> of twenty-three judges, they would not measure the distance to that city. The Gemara explains: This is <b>because</b> the verse <b>requires “the Elders of that city”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:3), <b>and</b> this is <b>not</b> the case here; therefore the rite was not performed. The mishna also taught that the Elders <b>measure</b> the distance from the corpse <b>only to a city</b> that contains a rabbinical court of twenty-three judges. The Gemara asks: This <b>is obvious. Since</b> the mishna <b>taught</b> that they do not measure the distance <b>to a city that does not have</b> a rabbinical <b>court</b> of twenty-three judges, <b>I know</b> that <b>they measure</b> the distance <b>only to a city that has</b> a rabbinical <b>court</b> of twenty-three judges.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> the corpse <b>was found close to a city that does not have</b> a rabbinical <b>court</b> of twenty-three judges, <b>that they leave</b> the city aside <b>and measure</b> the distance from the corpse <b>to a city that has</b> a rabbinical <b>court</b> of twenty-three judges? <b>The verse states: “And the Elders of that city shall take”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:3), which indicates that the Elders of a city are involved <b>in any case,</b> and the measurement is taken even if it is not to the city closest to the body.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If the slain person <b>is found precisely between two cities,</b> the inhabitants of <b>the two of them bring two heifers</b> total; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. And</b> the inhabitants of <b>Jerusalem do not bring a heifer whose neck is broken,</b> even if Jerusalem is the city closest to the slain victim.

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Eliezer,</b> that when a body is found precisely between two cities, the inhabitants of each city bring a heifer? His ruling is based on two factors. First, <b>he holds</b> that <b>it is possible to measure precisely</b> and that it is a real possibility to determine that both cities are exactly the same distance from the corpse. <b>And</b> second, he interprets the term <b>“That is nearest”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:3), to be referring not only to one city. It can <b>even</b> be understood as: <b>That are nearest,</b> so that the <i>halakhot</i> apply to more than one city.",
            "The mishna taught: <b>And</b> the inhabitants of <b>Jerusalem do not bring a heifer whose neck is broken.</b> The Gemara explains: This is <b>because the verse states:</b> “If one be found slain in the land which the Lord your God has given <b>you to possess it”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:1), <b>and</b> this <i>tanna</i> <b>holds</b> that <b>Jerusalem was not divided among the tribes</b> in the division of Eretz Yisrael. It was not given as a possession to any particular person but belongs to all; therefore the <i>halakha</i> of the heifer whose neck is broken does not apply to it.",
            "§ With regard to the <i>halakha</i> of a corpse whose <b>head was found in</b> one <b>place</b> and its body elsewhere, the Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>do they disagree? If we say they disagree with regard to</b> whether the <b>measurement</b> is taken from the head or the body, <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause teaches: From where would they measure</b> the distance, <b>it may be inferred that</b> in <b>the first clause we are not dealing with measurement.

Rabbi Akiva says:</b> They bring <b>the body next to the head.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>With regard to what do they disagree?</b> They both agree that he should be buried in the place where he was killed, but one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Eliezer, <b>holds</b> that <b>his body fell in its place,</b> and it was <b>the head that rolled away and fell. And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Akiva, <b>holds</b> that <b>his head fell where it fell,</b> and <b>it was the body that went and continued</b> onward. Therefore, the body is brought to the head.",
            "§ The mishna taught that there is a dispute concerning the question: <b>From where</b> on the body <b>would they measure</b> the distance? The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what do they disagree?</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Akiva, <b>holds:</b> A person’s <b>life is</b> sustained <b>mainly in his nose,</b> in his respiratory system. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Eliezer, <b>holds: His life is mainly in</b> the area of <b>his navel,</b> in his digestive system.",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say that these <i>tanna’im</i> are like those <i>tanna’im</i>,</b> who had a dispute as it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where is an embryo formed? From its head, and so</b> the verse <b>states: “Out of my mother’s womb You pulled me [<i>gozi</i>]”</b> (Psalms 71:6). <b>And</b> the proof that “<i>gozi</i>” is referring to the head is from the verse that <b>states: “Cut off [<i>gozi</i>] your hair, and cast it away”</b> (Jeremiah 7:29). In this verse, the term <i>gozi</i> relates to the hair of the head. <b>Abba Shaul says:</b> An embryo is formed <b>from its navel, and it sends its roots forth.</b> This dispute concerning the initial formation of an embryo also appears to depend on where the main source of life in a person is.",
            "The Gemara refutes this comparison: <b>You</b> can <b>even say</b> that both <i>tanna’im</i> of the mishna agree with <b>Abba Shaul,</b> as <b>Abba Shaul says</b> his opinion <b>only with regard to the forming</b> of an embryo, <b>that when an embryo is formed,</b> it is <b>formed from its middle. But with regard to life, everyone,</b> i.e., both <i>tanna’im</i> in the <i>baraita</i>, agree that <b>it is in his nose, as it is written: “All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life”</b> (Genesis 7:22).",
            "The mishna taught another opinion. <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> The distance should be measured <b>from the place where</b> the victim <b>became a slain</b> person, <b>from his neck.</b> The Gemara poses a question: <b>What is the reason of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “To lay you upon the necks of the wicked who are to be slain”</b> (Ezekiel 21:34), which shows that being slain occurs at the neck.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna continues to describe the ritual.

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the mishna’s statement that the heifer is not disqualified by a blemish, the Gemara suggests: <b>And a blemish should disqualify in</b> the case of the <b>heifer, by</b> means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>And if</b> in the case of the red heifer, <b>which is not disqualified</b> by <b>years,</b> as it may be of any age, and yet <b>a blemish disqualifies it,</b> then <b>a heifer</b> for this ritual, <b>which is disqualified by years,</b> as it is valid only until two years of age, <b>is it not logical that a blemish should disqualify it?</b> The Gemara answers: It <b>is different there,</b> in the case of the red heifer, <b>as the verse states: “Wherein [<i>bah</i>] has no blemish”</b> (Numbers 19:2). This serves as an exclusion and teaches that it is only <b>with regard to it [<i>bah</i>]</b> that <b>a blemish is disqualifying, but a blemish is not disqualifying with regard to</b> the <b>heifer</b> of the ritual of the breaking of the neck.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>However, if that is so,</b> if the word “<i>bah</i>” precludes a derivation by an <i>a fortiori</i> inference, then any <b>other labor</b> performed with the red heifer, apart from pulling a yoke, <b>should not disqualify it.</b> While the verse disqualifies a red heifer only if it pulled a yoke, as it states: “And upon which never came a yoke” (Numbers 19:2), a similar <i>a fortiori</i> inference could be learned from the heifer whose neck is to be broken to disqualify a red heifer that has performed any labor. However, since the verse states with regard to the heifer whose neck is to be broken: “That has not been worked with [<i>bah</i>]” (Deuteronomy 21:3), this indicates that labor is disqualifying only for “<i>bah</i>,” a heifer whose neck is to be broken, but not for a red heifer.",
            "<b>Why,</b> then, does <b>Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> If <b>he placed a bundle [<i>uda</i>] of sacks on</b> a red heifer<b>, </b>the heifer is immediately <b>disqualified</b> from being used as the red heifer; <b>and</b> as <b>for the heifer</b> whose neck is broken, it is not disqualified by such labor <b>until it pulls</b> and moves the burden, as the verse states: “That has not pulled a yoke” (Deuteronomy 21:3). Why does bearing the weight of the bundle disqualify the red heifer? The Gemara explains: The <i>halakha</i> with regard to the red <b>heifer is different, as we learn</b> by a verbal analogy between the word <b>“yoke”</b> used with regard to the red heifer and the word <b>“yoke”</b> used with regard <b>to</b> the <b>heifer</b> whose neck is broken that any labor disqualifies the former.",
            "The Gemara raises an objection: If there is a verbal analogy between the red heifer and the heifer that will have its neck broken, then the <i>halakha</i> that a blemish should disqualify the heifer whose neck is broken <b>should also be derived</b> from the usage of <b>“yoke”</b> with regard to the heifer whose neck is broken and <b>from</b> the usage of <b>“yoke”</b> with regard <b>to</b> the red <b>heifer.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The Merciful One has excluded</b> this possibility by placing in the verse the word <b>“<i>bah</i>,”</b> which indicates that disqualification due to blemish applies only to the red heifer and not to the heifer whose neck is broken.",
            "The Gemara counters this claim: <b>In</b> the verse concerning <b>a heifer</b> whose neck is broken, the Torah <b>also writes “<i>bah</i>”;</b> it should be the case that forms of labor other than pulling a yoke are disqualifying only with regard to it and not with regard to the red heifer. The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> word “<i>bah</i>” <b>is required by</b> Rav Yehuda in order <b>to exclude sacred</b> offerings, i.e., <b>which are not disqualified by labor,</b> and one may bring an animal that has been used for labor as an offering. <b>It might enter your mind to say</b> that this <b>should be derived by an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from a heifer</b> whose neck is broken, as follows: <b>And if</b> with regard to <b>a heifer</b> whose neck is broken, <b>which is not disqualified by a blemish, labor</b> nevertheless <b>disqualifies it,</b> then with regard to <b>sacred</b> offerings, <b>which are disqualified by a blemish, is it not right that labor should disqualify them?</b> In order to counter this argument, the word “<i>bah</i>” teaches us that a sacred offering is not disqualified by labor.",
            "With regard to this suggested <i>a fortiori</i> inference, the Gemara observes that <b>it can be refuted</b> in the following manner: <b>What</b> about the fact that <b>a heifer</b> whose neck is broken <b>is disqualified by years,</b> as once it reaches two years of age it is no longer classified as a heifer? As it is clear that the heifer whose neck is to be broken carries some restrictions that do not apply to sacred offerings, perhaps being disqualified by labor is another such restriction. The Gemara refutes this argument: <b>Is that to say that there are no sacred</b> offerings <b>that are disqualified by years?</b> There are several offerings that may be brought only in their first or second year, and <b>where the verse is necessary</b> to teach that sacred offerings are not disqualified by labor, it is with regard to <b>those sacred</b> offerings <b>that are disqualified by years.</b>",
            "The Gemara raises an objection: <b>But is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>that sacred</b> offerings <b>are not disqualified by labor derived from this</b> verse? <b>It is derived from elsewhere.</b> The verse states with regard to sacred offerings: <b>“Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wart, or scabbed, or scurvy, you shall not offer these to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 22:22). This verse serves to create an exclusion, teaching that it is <b>these</b> that <b>you may not sacrifice, but you may sacrifice sacred</b> animals <b>that have been used for labor.</b> The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary</b> to state the <i>halakha</i> twice. <b>It might enter your mind to say</b> that <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i>, that one may sacrifice animals that have been used for labor, <b>applies only</b> in a case where <b>they were used for permitted labor, but</b> if they were used for <b>prohibited labor,</b> e.g., on Shabbat, you might <b>say that it is prohibited</b> to bring <b>them</b> as offerings. In order to refute this argument, it is <b>necessary</b> to state the <i>halakha</i> again.",
            "The Gemara poses another question: <b>But this</b> <i>halakha</i> that prohibited labor does not disqualify offerings <b>is also derived from here,</b> a verse with regard to the sacrifice of blemished animals: <b>“And from the hand of a stranger you shall not offer the bread of your God from any of these, because…</b>there is a blemish in them” (Leviticus 22:25). This verse emphasizes that it is only <b>“these,”</b> i.e., blemished animals, that <b>you may not sacrifice, but you may sacrifice sacred</b> animals <b>that have been used for labor.</b> Since this verse is discussing the possibility of accepting offerings from a gentile, who presumably also performed prohibited labor with the animal, this demonstrates that prohibited labor does not disqualify animals from being sacrificed as offerings.",
            "The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> a third time. <b>It might enter your mind to say: This</b> <i>halakha</i>, that labor does not disqualify offerings, <b>applies</b> only where <b>one performed labor with them when they were non-sacred</b> and afterward dedicated them as offerings, <b>but</b> if <b>one performed labor with them when they were</b> already <b>sacred</b> animals, you might <b>say that it is prohibited</b> to bring <b>them</b> as offerings. In order to refute this argument, it is <b>necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> in three separate places.",
            "§ The Gemara returns to discuss <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> If <b>one placed a bundle of sacks on</b> a red heifer, <b>it is disqualified. And</b> as <b>for a heifer</b> whose neck is broken, it is not disqualified <b>until it pulls</b> a burden. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: It states with regard to the red heifer: “That upon which never came <b>a yoke”</b> (Numbers 19:2). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only a yoke; from where</b> do I derive that other types of labor also disqualify the animal? <b>You</b> can <b>say</b> the following <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>And if</b> with regard to <b>a heifer</b> whose neck is broken, <b>which is not disqualified by a blemish, other</b> types of <b>labor disqualify it,</b> then with regard to a red <b>heifer, which is disqualified by a blemish, is it not right that other</b> types of <b>labor should disqualify it?</b>",
            "<b>And if it is your wish to say</b> that this <i>a fortiori</i> inference is unsound, you can learn this <i>halakha</i> by a verbal analogy: <b>It is stated here,</b> with regard to the red heifer, <b>“yoke”</b> (Numbers 19:2), <b>and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the heifer whose neck is broken, <b>“yoke”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:3). <b>Just as there, other</b> types of <b>labor disqualify it, so too here,</b> in the case of the red heifer, <b>other</b> types of <b>labor disqualify</b> it.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>If it is your wish to say?</b> What potential problem with the <i>a fortiori</i> inference necessitates the verbal analogy?

            "As the <i>a fortiori</i> inference can be refuted in either of these ways, there is a need for the verbal analogy: <b>It is stated here “yoke,” and it is stated there “yoke.” Just as there,</b> in the case of <b>a heifer</b> whose neck is broken, <b>other</b> types of <b>labor</b> disqualify it, <b>so too, other</b> types of <b>labor</b> disqualify a red heifer. The Gemara raises an objection to this verbal analogy: <b>And from the place that you came</b> you can offer an alternative exposition: <b>Just as below,</b> in the case of a heifer whose neck is broken, it is not disqualified by carrying a burden <b>until it pulls</b> the yoke, <b>so too here,</b> a red heifer should not be disqualified <b>until it pulls</b> the yoke, contrary to the statement of Rav.",
            "The Gemara answers the objection to the statement of Rav from the <i>baraita</i>: It <b>is</b> a dispute among <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as there are those who cite</b> the source of <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i>, that labor disqualifies a red heifer, by verbal analogy <b>from a heifer</b> whose neck is broken, and therefore the red heifer is disqualified only if it pulls the burden. <b>There are</b> also <b>those who cite</b> the source of <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> a red <b>heifer itself,</b> and consequently they disqualify the red heifer even if it did not pull the yoke.",

            "The Gemara relates a story about accompaniment: <b>Rav Kahana accompanied Rav Shimi bar Ashi from</b> the town of <b>Pum Nahara to</b> the <b>palm grove in Babylonia. When they arrived there,</b> Rav Kahana <b>said to</b> Rav Shimi bar Ashi: Is it <b>true that you say</b> that <b>these palm trees</b> of <b>Babylonia have been</b> in this place <b>since the years of Adam the first</b> man?",
            "Rav Shimi bar Ashi <b>said to him:</b> By mentioning Adam the first man <b>you reminded me of something that Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Through a land that no man passed through, and where no person [<i>adam</i>] dwelt”?</b> (Jeremiah 2:6). This verse is difficult: <b>Since it</b> is a land <b>through which no</b> man <b>has passed, where would he dwell? And if he did not dwell, where did he pass?</b> Why does the verse add that no person has dwelled there? <b>Rather,</b> this is the meaning: Any <b>land</b> concerning <b>which Adam the first</b> man <b>decreed that it would be a settled area, was settled;</b> but <b>a land</b> concerning <b>which Adam the first</b> man <b>did not decree that</b> it should be settled, <b>was not settled.</b>",
            "The Gemara also relates that <b>Rav Mordekhai accompanied Rav Ashi from</b> the town of <b>Hagronya until Bei Keifei, and some say</b> that he accompanied him <b>until Bei Dura.</b>",
            "The Gemara continues to discuss the importance of accompaniment. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Meir: Whoever does not accompany</b> another <b>or will not</b> allow himself to be <b>accompanied is like a spiller of blood</b> and is held responsible for any deaths that occur as a result of his inaction. The proof for this is <b>that had the inhabitants of Jericho accompanied Elisha, he would not have incited the bears to</b> attack <b>the children, as it is stated: “And he went up from there to Bethel, and as he was going up by the way, there came forth young lads out of the city and mocked him, and said to him: Go up, baldhead; go up, baldhead”</b> (II Kings 2:23). Had the residents of Jericho accompanied him, they would have sent away those youths and prevented what occurred next.",
            "The Gemara proceeds to discuss this episode in detail, beginning with the meaning of the youths’ taunt. <b>They said to him: Go up,</b> away from here, <b>for you have made the place bald,</b> i.e., bare, <b>for us.</b> They had previously earned their living by providing the city of Jericho with water. Elisha sweetened the city’s own water, rendering their services unnecessary. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>“Young lads [<i>ne’arim ketannim</i>]”?</b> One would have expected the verse to state either “young” or “lads,” but not both. <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The word “lads [<i>ne’arim</i>]” means that <b>they were shaken</b> empty <b>[<i>meno’arim</i>] of the mitzvot;</b> the word <b>“young [<i>ketannim</i>]”</b> means <b>that they were of little faith [<i>ketannei amana</i>],</b> as they had no trust that they would be able to earn their livelihood by any other means.

            "<b>Rav Yosef objects to this</b> interpretation: <b>And perhaps</b> they were called <i>ne’arim</i> <b>after their place</b> of origin? <b>Isn’t it written: “And</b> the Arameans had gone out in bands, <b>and had brought away captive from Eretz Yisrael a minor young woman [<i>na’ara ketana</i>]”</b> (II Kings 5:2), <b>and</b> this verse raised <b>a difficulty to us: A minor and a young woman;</b> how could she be both of these? <b>And Rabbi Pedat says</b> it means <b>a minor</b> girl <b>from</b> the town of <b>Ne’oran.</b> This verse concerning the lads can be explained in a similar manner: They were young children from Ne’oran. The Gemara answers: These two cases are not comparable. <b>There</b> the verse <b>does not specify her place</b> of origin, so “<i>na’ara</i>” could mean from the town of Ne’oran; but <b>here</b> the verse <b>specifies their place</b> of origin, namely Jericho.",
            "The verse further states with regard to the same incident: <b>“And he turned behind him and saw them, and he cursed them in the name of the Lord”</b> (II Kings 2:24).
