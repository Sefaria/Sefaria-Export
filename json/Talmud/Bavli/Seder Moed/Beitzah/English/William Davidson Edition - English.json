            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>an egg that was laid on a Festival</b> (<i>Eduyyot</i> 4:1), <b>Beit Shammai say: It may be eaten</b> even on that day, <b>and Beit Hillel say: It may not be eaten,</b> as the Gemara will explain at length. Apropos this exceptional case, in which Beit Shammai are lenient and Beit Hillel are strict, the mishna cites additional <i>halakhot</i> of the Festivals in which this unusual phenomenon occurs (<i>Yoma</i> 79b). <b>Beit Shammai say: Leaven,</b> i.e., dough that has leavened to such an extent that it is no longer used as food but as a leavening agent for other dough, is prohibited on Passover in the measure <b>of an olive-bulk.</b> However, the measure for edible <b>leavened bread</b> is greater, that <b>of a large date-bulk. And Beit Hillel say:</b> For both <b>this and that,</b> the measure is that <b>of an olive-bulk.</b>",
            "Furthermore, with regard to <b>one who slaughters an undomesticated animal or a bird on a Festival</b> (<i>Eduyyot</i> 4:2), in which case there is a mitzva from the Torah to cover the blood after slaughtering (Leviticus 17:13), <b>Beit Shammai say: He digs</b> earth <b>with a shovel and covers</b> the blood with that earth <i>ab initio</i>. <b>And Beit Hillel say: He may not slaughter</b> <i>ab initio</i>, <b>unless he had earth prepared</b> for that purpose <b>while it was still day. But</b> even Beit Hillel <b>concede that if one</b> already <b>slaughtered</b> the animal or the bird, <b>then he should dig with a shovel and cover</b> the blood. Additionally, they agree <b>that the ashes of a stove are</b> considered <b>prepared</b> for the use of covering blood, as will be explained by the Gemara.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara inquires: <b>With what</b> case <b>are we dealing</b> in this mishna? <b>If we say</b> that the mishna is referring <b>to a chicken that is designated for eating,</b> i.e., one planned to slaughter and eat a chicken that laid an egg, <b>what is the reason that Beit Hillel</b> prohibit eating the egg? <b>It is food that has been separated [<i>de’ifrat</i>].</b> The entire chicken is considered food, as it is designated for eating, and this egg is simply a part that became detached. Just as one may partake of the chicken itself on a Festival, its egg should likewise be fit for consumption.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the mishna must be referring to the case <b>of a chicken designated for laying eggs.</b> Since the owner of this chicken decided not to eat it on the Festival, it is classified as set-aside [<i>muktze</i>], and <i>muktze</i> items may not even be moved, let alone eaten. Since the chicken itself is <i>muktze</i>, its egg is <i>muktze</i> as well.",
            "The Gemara asks: If so, <b>what is the reason of Beit Shammai</b> for permitting one to eat the egg? After all, <b>it is <i>muktze</i>.</b> The Gemara expresses surprise at this question: <b>And what is the difficulty? Perhaps Beit Shammai do not hold</b> that there is a prohibition of <b><i>muktze</i>?</b> There are different opinions with regard to the scope of the prohibition of <i>muktze</i>. It is possible that Beit Shammai, like other <i>tanna’im</i>, maintain that there is no prohibition of this type of <i>muktze</i>. Perhaps this is the subject of their dispute with Beit Hillel.",
            "Before stating its proposed solutions for this difficulty, the Gemara notes: <b>It enters our mind</b> to say that <b>even one who permits</b> moving an item that was <b>set aside</b> by its owners on a Festival or Shabbat <b>prohibits</b> the owners from doing so <b>with</b> an object that <b>came into being [<i>nolad</i>]</b> on a Festival. One may not move an object that came into being on a Festival or Shabbat, since the owner never entertained the notion that he would be able to use it. This egg is certainly an object that came into being on the Festival. <b>What,</b> then, <b>is the reason of Beit Shammai?</b>",
            "<b>Rav Naḥman said: Actually,</b> the mishna is referring <b>to a chicken designated for laying eggs.</b> However, our previous assumption was mistaken, as the Sage <b>who holds</b> that there is a prohibition of <b><i>muktze</i></b> in general also <b>holds</b> that there is a prohibition of objects that <b>came into being,</b> while one <b>who does not hold</b> that there is a prohibition of <b><i>muktze</i></b> likewise <b>does not hold</b> that there is a prohibition of objects that <b>came into being</b> (<i>Shabbat</i> 45b). Consequently, the dispute can be summed up as follows: <b>Beit Shammai</b> hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who maintains that there is no prohibition of <i>muktze</i>; <b>and Beit Hillel</b> hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who rules that there is a prohibition of <i>muktze</i>.",
            "The Gemara is puzzled by this explanation: <b>And did Rav Naḥman</b> actually <b>say that</b> Beit Hillel hold in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 143a) that <b>Beit Shammai say: One</b> may <b>remove bones and shells</b> left from the meal <b>from the table,</b> despite the fact that they are inedible and are <i>muktze</i>. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> It is prohibited to do so; rather, <b>one</b> may <b>remove the entire board [<i>tavla</i>]</b> that is the table surface, which is a vessel that may be carried, <b>and shake it</b> all at once. By moving the table, which is not <i>muktze</i>, one is able to shake off the bones and shells, but he may not move the items themselves.",
            "<b>And Rav Naḥman said:</b> That version of the mishna is not in accordance with the <i>halakha</i>; rather, the opinions should be reversed, as <b>we</b> have <b>nothing other</b> than the following version of this dispute: <b>Beit Shammai</b> hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who maintains that the prohibition of <i>muktze</i> applies, while <b>Beit Hillel</b> hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who maintains that the <i>halakha</i> of <i>muktze</i> does not apply. Why, then, does Rav Naḥman explain that the ruling of Beit Hillel in the case of the egg in the mishna is based on the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, who holds that there actually is a prohibition of <i>muktze</i>?",
            "The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Naḥman</b> could have <b>said to you</b> in reply: <b>With regard to Shabbat,</b> this is a case <b>where</b> the <b><i>tanna</i> taught us an unattributed</b> mishna, which is generally accepted as the <i>halakha</i>, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 156b): <b>One</b> may <b>cut pumpkins before an animal</b> to facilitate their consumption, <b>and</b> likewise one may cut up <b>an animal carcass before dogs,</b> even if the animal died on Shabbat, to enable them to consume it. Although that carcass is classified as <i>muktze</i>, it may be moved on Shabbat.",
            "The Gemara concludes: That unattributed mishna in tractate <i>Shabbat</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon. For this reason, Rav Naḥman <b>establishes</b> that the dispute between Beit Hillel and Beit Shammai should be understood to mean <b>that Beit Hillel</b> hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> whom the <i>halakha</i> apparently follows, as there is a principle that the <i>halakha</i> is always in accordance with Beit Hillel’s opinion. <b>However,</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>with regard to a Festival,</b> the <b><i>tanna</i> taught us an unattributed</b> mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> (<i>Shabbat</i> 156b), <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna in this tractate: <b>One</b> may <b>not chop wood</b> on a Festival <b>from beams</b> prepared for use in construction work, <b>nor</b> may one chop kindling wood <b>from a beam that broke on a Festival.</b> As the beams were not prepared for this use when the Festival began, they are classified as <i>muktze</i>; this demonstrates that an unattributed mishna prohibits <i>muktze</i> on a Festival. Consequently, Rav Naḥman <b>establishes</b> the opinion <b>of Beit Hillel in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who prohibits <i>muktze</i>. He does so by asserting that the mishna is referring to the case of a chicken designated for laying eggs, which is <i>muktze</i>. This concludes the Gemara’s explanation of Rav Naḥman’s rendering of the tannaitic dispute.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Now since,</b> i.e., consider the following: <b>Who is the one who</b> wrote and edited the Mishna, and arranged <b>the unattributed <i>mishnayot</i>?</b> It was <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. Since the same Sage formulated the statements in both tractates, the question arises: <b>What is different</b> with regard <b>to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>Shabbat, that</b> he <b>stated the unattributed opinion</b> and ruled <b>for us in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, and what is different</b> with regard <b>to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a Festival, that</b> he <b>stated the unattributed opinion</b> and ruled <b>for us in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda?</b>",
            "<b>They</b> answer and <b>say:</b> In the case of <b>Shabbat, which is stringent</b> with regard to its punishments (see 35b), <b>and</b> therefore people <b>will not come to treat it with contempt,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>taught us the unattributed</b> mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who rules leniently.</b> Conversely, with regard to <b>a Festival, which is lenient,</b> as certain labors may be performed on a Festival, <b>and</b> therefore people <b>will</b> be more likely to <b>come to treat it with contempt,</b> he <b>stated the unattributed opinion for us in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who rules stringently.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>In what</b> manner <b>did you</b> ultimately <b>establish</b> the mishna? It was established as referring <b>to a chicken designated for laying eggs, and</b> the prohibition is <b>due to <i>muktze</i>. If so, rather than disputing with regard to an egg</b> laid on a Festival, <b>let them dispute with regard to</b> the <b>chicken</b> itself. Instead of considering the secondary detail of an egg, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel could discuss whether or not the chicken itself may be slaughtered on a Festival.",
            "The Gemara answers: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel also disagree with regard to the chicken, but the dispute was phrased in this manner <b>to convey the far-reaching nature of</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai.</b> The formulation of the mishna emphasizes the extent of Beit Shammai’s lenient opinion, <b>that</b> even <b>in the case of</b> an egg, which is not a regular <i>muktze</i> item but an item that <b>came into being,</b> an especially stringent type of <i>muktze</i>, Beit Shammai nevertheless <b>permit</b> it. By stating the dispute with regard to an egg, the mishna stresses Beit Shammai’s lenient opinion.",
            "The Gemara raises an objection: <b>And let them disagree with regard to a chicken,</b> rather than an egg, <b>to convey the far-reaching nature of</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel, who prohibit</b> its use <b>even</b> in the more lenient case <b>of <i>muktze</i>. And if you say</b> it is better to present the dispute as in the mishna, so as to clarify the more lenient opinion, as <b>the strength of leniency is preferable</b> (<i>Berakhot</i> 60a), there is another option: <b>And let them disagree with regard to both of</b> these cases.",
            "The mishna could have said: With regard to <b>a chicken designated for laying eggs, it and its eggs, Beit Shammai say: It may be eaten, and Beit Hillel say: It may not be eaten.</b> In this manner, the mishna could have referred to all aspects of the dispute, without the need for any lengthy addition. Consequently, Rav Naḥman’s explanation of the mishna is inadequate.",
            "<b>Rather, Rabba said: Actually,</b> the above explanation should be rejected. <b>We are dealing with a chicken designated for food and we are dealing with</b> an egg that was laid <b>on a Festival that occurs after Shabbat,</b> i.e., on a Sunday. <b>And</b> the relevant issue is not the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>muktze</i>; rather, one may not eat the egg <b>due to</b> the prohibition against <b>preparation</b> from Shabbat to a Festival.",
            "<b>And</b> in this regard, <b>Rabba holds</b> that <b>any egg laid now was</b> already <b>fully developed yesterday,</b> and merely emerged from the chicken today. Consequently, an egg laid on a Festival that occurred on a Sunday may not be eaten, as it was prepared on Shabbat, despite the fact that it was prepared naturally, by Heaven, rather than by man.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>And Rabba,</b> who prohibits one to derive benefit even from something that was not prepared by man, conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning. As Rabba said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written</b> with regard to the manna: <b>“And it shall come to pass on the sixth day, that they shall prepare that which they bring in”</b> (Exodus 16:5)? According to Rabba, it can be inferred from this verse that on an ordinary <b>weekday,</b> “the sixth day,” <b>one</b> may <b>prepare</b> what is needed <b>for Shabbat, and</b> similarly, on an ordinary <b>weekday one</b> may <b>prepare</b> what is needed <b>for a Festival.</b> However, on <b>a Festival one may not prepare for Shabbat, and</b> likewise <b>on Shabbat one may not prepare for a Festival.</b>",
            "<b>Abaye said to</b> Rabba: <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> and the concern is only due to preparation, <b>let</b> an egg laid on <b>a regular Festival,</b> one that does not occur on a Sunday, <b>be permitted.</b> Rabba responded: That egg is not prohibited by Torah law, but by rabbinic <b>decree, due to</b> the case of <b>a Festival</b> that occurs <b>after Shabbat.</b> Abaye asked: On <b>a regular Shabbat,</b> one that does not occur after a Festival, <b>let</b> it <b>be permitted</b> to eat an egg that was laid on that day, provided that one does not cook it. Rabba similarly answered: It is <b>a decree due to a Shabbat</b> that occurs <b>after a Festival.</b>",
            "Abaye further asked: <b>And do we issue a decree</b> of this kind? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (see 6b): In the case of <b>one who slaughters a chicken</b> on a Festival <b>and finds inside it fully developed eggs</b> with their shells, <b>it is permitted to eat them on the Festival. And if it is so,</b> that the aforementioned decree is in effect, <b>let him issue a decree</b> and prohibit these eggs found inside the chicken, <b>due to those that are laid on that day.</b>",
            "Rabba <b>said to him:</b> This is not difficult, as the case of <b>fully developed eggs</b> found <b>inside their mother is an uncommon matter, and</b> in a case of <b>an uncommon matter the Sages did not issue a decree</b> as a preventive measure (<i>Eiruvin</i> 63b). The Sages issued their decrees only for usual situations, in which people might err, but they did not apply them to rare cases. This concludes the Gemara’s discussion of Rabba’s explanation.",
            "The Gemara proceeds to explain other interpretations of the mishna. <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> An egg laid by a chicken designated for food is prohibited for a different reason: It is <b>a decree due to fruits that fall</b> from a tree (<i>Eiruvin</i> 39b). Fruits that fall from a tree on Shabbat or a Festival may not be eaten, and the same applies to eggs that emerge from a chicken.",
            "<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: With regard to <b>fruits that fall, what</b> in fact <b>is the reason</b> that the Sages prohibited them?"
        ],
        [
            "It is <b>a decree lest</b> one <b>climb</b> the tree <b>and pick</b> the fruit, as this would constitute the prohibited labor of harvesting. If so, the prohibition against eating fruit <b>is itself</b> due to <b>a decree. And will we arise and issue a decree to</b> prevent violation of another <b>decree?</b> Rav Yosef responded: That is not so; rather, when the Sages issued the initial decree, they enacted the prohibitions against both fruit that fall and a laid egg, as <b>all</b> the prohibitions <b>are</b> components of <b>one decree.</b> In other words, the similar cases of the fruit and the egg were both included in the original decree.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said</b> a different reason: An egg that was laid on a Festival is prohibited as <b>a decree due to liquids that seeped</b> from the fruit (<i>Eiruvin</i> 39b), which is prohibited on that day. The legal status of an egg that was laid on a Festival is like that of liquids that seeped from a fruit on a Festival.",
            "<b>Abaye said to him:</b> With regard to <b>liquid that seeped</b> from fruit, <b>what is the reason</b> that the Sages prohibited it? It is <b>a decree lest one</b> purposely <b>squeeze</b> the fruit, and thereby perform the prohibited labor of threshing. However, the prohibition against consuming this juice <b>is itself</b> a rabbinic <b>decree. And will we arise and issue a decree to</b> prevent violation of another <b>decree?</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak replied: <b>All</b> the prohibitions <b>are</b> components of <b>one decree.</b> When the Sages prohibited this juice, they banned the eating of an egg laid on a Festival for the same reason, as the actions are similar.",
            "As various explanations have been offered for this mishna, the Gemara seeks to clarify why each Sage was dissatisfied with the other explanations and suggested an alternative. The Gemara says: <b>All of them,</b> Rabba, Rav Yosef, and Rabbi Yitzḥak, <b>did not state</b> their explanations <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman, as</b> stated in <b>our</b> previously stated <b>objection</b> to Rav Naḥman’s explanation. The other Sages <b>also did not state</b> their explanations <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba,</b> as they <b>do not</b> accept that there is a Torah prohibition of using items whose <b>preparation</b> was from Shabbat to a Festival or from a Festival to Shabbat.",
            "<b>However,</b> the following question arises: Since <b>Rav Yosef</b> provides an explanation that is similar to that of Rabbi Yitzḥak, <b>what is the reason</b> that he <b>did not state</b> his explanation <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak?</b> The Gemara answers that Rav Yosef could have <b>said to you: An egg is food, and fruit is food,</b> i.e., an egg is comparable to fruits that fall. This observation would serve <b>to exclude juice, which is not food</b> but drink. Consequently, an egg is not comparable to juice and would not be included in the same decree.",
            "The Gemara asks the reverse question: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, what is the reason</b> that he <b>did not state</b> his explanation <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yosef?</b> The Gemara answers: He could have <b>said to you</b> that the case of an egg is more similar to juices that seep from fruit. How so? <b>An egg is enclosed</b> inside a chicken before it is laid, and likewise <b>juice is enclosed</b> inside the fruit. This observation serves <b>to exclude fruits</b> that fall from a tree, <b>which are standing exposed</b> on the tree. Therefore, the comparison between fruits that fall and an egg is weaker than the comparison between liquid that seeped from fruit and an egg.",
            "§ The Gemara notes: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan also holds</b> that the prohibition against eating an egg laid on a Festival is <b>a decree due to liquid that seeped</b> from fruit. What proof can be cited for this? It is proven <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan raised a contradiction</b> between one statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> and a different statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda, and he resolved</b> the apparent contradiction in a manner that indicates his own opinion.",
            "The Gemara elaborates on the previous statement. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 143b): <b>One may not squeeze fruits to extract liquids from them</b> on Shabbat, <b>and if</b> the liquids <b>seeped out on their own, it is prohibited</b> to use them on Shabbat, lest he come to squeeze fruits intentionally. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: If</b> the fruit is designated <b>for eating,</b> e.g., apples, the liquid <b>that seeps from them is permitted.</b> Since there is no concern that one might squeeze the fruit, there is no reason to prohibit its liquid. <b>And if</b> the fruit was originally designated <b>for liquids,</b> such as grapes for wine, there are grounds for concern that one might squeeze them, and therefore the liquid <b>that seeps from them is prohibited.</b>",
            "From the fact that Rabbi Yehuda said that liquid from fruit intended for eating is permitted, one can infer that, <b>apparently, all food</b> that comes out of another food <b>is</b> classified as <b>food that was separated, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b> Food that was separated is not considered a new food, but part of the food that previously existed.",
            "<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> against this from a different source: <b>And Rabbi Yehuda said further,</b> concerning untithed fruit, which may not be rendered fit to be eaten on a Festival by separating <i>teruma</i> and tithes from it (<i>Eiruvin</i> 39a): <b>A person may stipulate a condition with regard to a basket of</b> untithed <b>fruit on the first day of a Festival,</b> and say: If today is the true Festival day, the second Festival day is actually a weekday. Therefore, this fruit is permitted, once I separate tithes from it, as on any other weekday. And vice versa: If today is, in fact, a weekday, and tomorrow is the Festival, I hereby separate its tithes today.",
            "Likewise, on the following day, he should again stipulate: If today is a weekday and yesterday was holy, I hereby separate tithes from the fruit now; if today is holy and yesterday was a weekday, separating the tithes yesterday was sufficient. <b>And he</b> may then <b>eat</b> the produce <b>on</b> the <b>second</b> Festival day, as in either case no prohibition is involved. <b>And similarly, an egg laid on</b> the <b>first</b> Festival day may <b>be eaten on</b> the <b>second</b> day, regardless of which day is the actual Festival.",
            "Rabbi Yehuda’s statement indicates that <b>on the second</b> day, <b>yes,</b> it is permitted to partake of the egg; but if the egg was laid <b>on the first</b> day, <b>no,</b> one may not eat it. If so, Rabbi Yehuda apparently contradicts himself, as he said previously that liquid from food prepared for eating has the same status as the food itself, and that its emergence is considered to be nothing more than the separation of two foods from each other. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan resolves</b> the difficulty: <b>The</b> attribution of the <b>opinions</b> with regard to the second day of the Festival <b>is reversed</b> (<i>Berakhot</i> 17b), so that Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion corresponds with his ruling above.",
            "The significance of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement for the issue at hand is as follows: <b>Since</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>raised a contradiction between</b> the cases of an egg and liquid that oozed, one may <b>conclude from this that it is the same reason</b> in both cases, i.e., an egg is prohibited on a Festival due to the rabbinic decree against liquid that oozed from fruit."
        ],
        [
            "With regard to the contradiction presented by Rabbi Yoḥanan, which led him to suggest that the opinions should be reversed, <b>Ravina said</b> that this is not the only possible resolution: <b>Actually, do not reverse</b> the opinions. Rather, in the case of the two Festival days, one could claim that <b>Rabbi Yehuda spoke to them in accordance with the statement of the Rabbis,</b> rather than presenting his own opinion.",
            "If so, Rabbi Yehuda’s statement should be understood as follows: <b>In my</b> opinion, <b>even on the first</b> Festival day, the egg is <b>also permitted, as it is food that was separated. However, according to your</b> opinion, which is that you prohibit liquid that comes from food, <b>at least agree with me that it is permitted on the second</b> day, <b>as they are two sanctities.</b> The first and second days of Rosh HaShana are not one unit, but two separate entities. Therefore, it is possible that the first day is sacred, while the second is a weekday. Consequently, an item prohibited on the first day might be permitted on the second. <b>And the Rabbis said to him: No,</b> the two days <b>are one sanctity,</b> i.e., they are viewed as a single continuous unit. The uncertainty applies equally to both of them.",
            "<b>Ravina, son of Rav Ulla, said:</b> There is an alternative resolution to the contradiction raised by Rabbi Yoḥanan. <b>Here,</b> in the case of the egg laid on a Festival, Rabbi Yehuda prohibited eating the egg since it is not from a chicken designated for food, whose legal status is that of food. Rather, the case refers <b>to a chicken designated for laying eggs, and Rabbi Yehuda</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he holds</b> that there is a prohibition of <b><i>muktze</i>.</b> Since the egg is produced by something <i>muktze</i>, it is certainly <i>muktze</i> itself, which means that the <i>halakha</i> of food that was separated is inapplicable to this case.",
            "§ The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>, which clarifies the issue differently: <b>Both an egg that was laid on Shabbat and an egg that was laid on a Festival</b> are considered to be <i>muktze</i>, and therefore in both cases, <b>one may not move</b> the egg, neither for the sake of food nor for any other purpose: <b>Not to cover a vessel with it, nor to support the legs of a bed with it.</b>",
            "<b>However,</b> if one wishes, he may <b>cover</b> the egg <b>with a vessel,</b> without handling the egg itself, <b>so that it does not break</b> from being accidentally trodden upon. Although it is prohibited to move the egg itself, it is nevertheless permitted to move a vessel for its sake. <b>And</b> even if there is <b>uncertainty</b> with regard to whether this egg was laid on a Festival, it <b>is prohibited</b> to move it. <b>And,</b> furthermore, <b>if it became intermingled with a thousand</b> permitted eggs, they are <b>all prohibited.</b>",
            "The Gemara notes: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba, who said</b> that an egg is prohibited <b>due to</b> the lack of <b>preparation,</b> this case involves <b>an uncertainty</b> with regard to the legal status of an item prohibited <b>by Torah law; and</b> in <b>any</b> case of <b>an uncertainty</b> with regard to the legal status of an item prohibited <b>by Torah law,</b> the ruling <b>is stringent.</b> Therefore, the egg is prohibited even if there is uncertainty whether it was laid on a Festival.",
            "<b>However, according to</b> the opinions of <b>Rav Yosef and Rabbi Yitzḥak, who say</b> that an egg is prohibited <b>due to a decree,</b> this case involves <b>an uncertainty</b> with regard to the legal status of an item prohibited <b>by rabbinic law, and</b> in <b>any</b> case of <b>an uncertainty</b> with regard to the legal status of an item prohibited <b>by rabbinic law,</b> the ruling <b>is lenient.</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: In <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>we have arrived at</b> a different case. The case does not involve the prohibition of an egg laid on a Festival; the case involves an egg laid by a chicken with regard to which there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether it is <b>an animal with a condition that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>],</b> which is prohibited by Torah law. The uncertainty with regard to the legal status of the chicken is relevant to the egg.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty with this response: <b>If so, say the latter clause</b> of that same <i>baraita</i>: If it <b>became intermingled with a thousand</b> other eggs, they are <b>all prohibited. Granted, if you say</b> that there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether the egg was laid on <b>a Festival</b> and <b>uncertainty</b> whether it was laid on <b>a weekday,</b> then <b>it is an object whose prohibition is temporary,</b> as the egg will be permitted on the following day, and the principle is: <b>Any object whose prohibition is temporary is not nullified, even by a thousand</b> permitted items. Since its prohibition will lapse on its own, there is no need to make use of the option of nullification.",
            "<b>However, if you say</b> that the egg referred to in the <i>baraita</i> is <b>an uncertain <i>tereifa</i>, it is an object whose prohibition is not temporary,</b> as there is no way to permit the prohibition of <i>tereifa</i>, <b>and it should</b> therefore <b>be nullified by</b> a simple <b>majority.</b>",
            "The Gemara adds: <b>And if you say</b> that <b>an egg is significant and is not nullified,</b> as nullification applies only to items that have no intrinsic significance, while a significant object cannot be nullified, <b>that</b> works out <b>well according to the one who said</b> that <b>we learned: Any</b> item <b>whose manner is</b> also <b>to be counted,</b> i.e., that is sometimes sold by unit, rather than by weight or volume, is considered significant. An egg falls into that category, as it is sometimes sold by unit.",
            "<b>However, according to the one who said</b> that <b>we learned: That</b> item <b>whose manner is</b> exclusively <b>to be counted,</b> i.e., that is always sold by unit, is considered significant, <b>what can be said?</b> Although eggs are often sold by unit, they are also often sold by weight or volume.",
            "The Gemara cites the mishna where the dispute cited above appears. <b>As we learned</b> (<i>Orla</i> 3:6–7): With regard to <b>one who had bundles of clover,</b> a type of legume, that were <b>diverse kinds</b> of food crops that grew <b>in a vineyard,</b> from which it is prohibited to derive benefit, those bundles <b>must be burned.</b> If the bundles <b>were intermingled with others, and</b> those <b>others</b> were intermingled <b>with others, they must all be burned.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: They may be nullified by one</b> part in <b>two hundred</b> similar parts. When the prohibited portion is less than one-half of one percent of the permitted portion, the prohibition is nullified.",
            "The mishna continues: Rabbi Meir says that they must all be burned, <b>as Rabbi Meir would say: That whose manner is</b> exclusively <b>to be counted,</b> is considered significant and cannot be nullified. Therefore, it <b>renders</b> the entire mixture <b>forbidden,</b> and it must be burned. <b>And the Rabbis say: Only six items</b> are sufficiently significant to <b>render</b> the entire mixture <b>forbidden. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> There are <b>seven. And they are:</b> High-quality <b>nuts</b> from <b>Perekh, and pomegranates</b> from <b>Badan, and sealed barrels</b> of wine, <b>and branches of spinach, and cabbage stalks, and Greek pumpkin. Rabbi Akiva adds: Even loaves of a homeowner.</b>",
            "Different prohibitions apply to these seven items. <b>That which is fit</b> to be forbidden due <b>to <i>orla</i>,</b> fruit that grows during the first three years after a tree is planted, is forbidden due to <b><i>orla</i>. That which is fit</b> to be forbidden due <b>to diverse kinds</b> of food crops that grew <b>in a vineyard</b> is forbidden due to <b>diverse kinds in a vineyard</b> (<i>Avoda Zara</i> 74a). <b>And it was stated about</b> the wording of this mishna that there is an amoraic dispute. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that <b>we learned:</b> Only <b>that whose manner is</b> exclusively <b>to be counted</b> is significant and cannot be nullified, and it is therefore prohibited by Rabbi Meir. <b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said</b> that <b>we learned: Any</b> item <b>whose manner is</b> also <b>to be counted,</b> is significant and cannot be nullified.",
            "Returning to the matter of the egg, the Gemara reprises its question: This works out <b>well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, but according to Rabbi Yoḥanan, what can be said?</b> Since an egg is not sold exclusively by unit, it is not significant. Therefore, the egg of a <i>tereifa</i> should be nullified by a simple majority.",
            "<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> According to Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>this <i>tanna</i>,</b> who said that an egg cannot be nullified, <b>is</b> the <b><i>tanna</i> of</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a <i>litra</i> of dried figs, who,</b> based on his statement, <b>said: Any item that is counted, even</b> if it is prohibited <b>by rabbinic law, cannot be nullified, and all the more so</b> items prohibited <b>by Torah law,</b> e.g., the egg of a <i>tereifa</i>.",
            "<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: With regard to <b>a <i>litra</i></b> of <b>dried figs,</b> whose stems were removed, and were dried and pressed in different vessels and shaped into circles, the obligation to tithe fruits is by rabbinic law. If one forgot to tithe the figs, and later remembered that he placed the figs into a barrel, and during the process of producing a circle <b>he pressed</b> the figs <b>onto the mouth</b> of one of the <b>circular</b> vessels in which the circles are formed, <b>and does not know into which circular</b> vessel <b>he pressed it;</b> or, if he recalls that he pressed it <b>on the mouth of a barrel, but does not know in which barrel he pressed it,</b> or if he recalls that he pressed it <b>on the mouth of a</b> straw <b>receptacle, but does not know in which receptacle he pressed it, Rabbi Meir says</b> that in all these cases there is a dispute between the <i>tanna’im</i> of the previous generation: <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b>"

            "In contrast, <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: If there are one hundred mouths</b> of different barrels or circular vessels <b>there,</b> the prohibited <i>litra</i> of untithed figs on the mouth of one of the vessels <b>is nullified</b> by a ratio of one part of prohibited figs to one hundred parts of similar, permitted figs. <b>And if not,</b> all of <b>the</b> circles of figs at the <b>mouths</b> of the barrels or circular vessels <b>are prohibited,</b> as one of them clearly contains a prohibited <i>litra</i> that has not been nullified. <b>And the</b> figs on the <b>insides</b> of the vessels <b>are permitted,</b> as the prohibited figs certainly did not reach there. This is Rabbi Meir’s version of the dispute.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> a different version of the dispute. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: If there are one hundred mouths</b> of vessels with permitted figs present <b>there,</b> in addition to the prohibited one, <b>it is nullified</b> by the one hundred permitted mouths. <b>And if not, the</b> figs at the <b>mouths are prohibited and</b> those at <b>the bottom are permitted. Rabbi Yehoshua says: Even</b> if <b>there are three hundred mouths</b> present <b>there, they are not nullified,</b> as this <i>litra</i> cannot be nullified in any manner. Rav Pappa was referring to this opinion when he said that there is a <i>tanna</i>, meaning Rabbi Yehoshua in Rabbi Yehuda’s version, who maintains that even an item occasionally sold by unit, e.g., a circle of dried figs, can never be nullified.",
            "The same mishna further states: If <b>one pressed</b> the <i>litra</i> of figs <b>into a circular</b> vessel <b>but he does not know into which circular</b> vessel <b>he pressed it, everyone agrees</b> that the prohibited fig cakes <b>are nullified.</b> The Gemara expresses surprise at this statement: <b>Everyone agrees?

            "<b>Rav Pappa said: This is what</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>said,</b> i.e., he meant the following: <b>One pressed it onto a circular</b> vessel but <b>does not know onto which place,</b> which side of the <b>circular</b> vessel <b>he pressed it, whether on its north or on its south</b> side. In this case, as the prohibited <i>litra</i> is not located in a specific place and it cannot be distinguished from the others, it certainly cannot be considered an object of significance, and <b>everyone agrees</b> that <b>it is nullified.</b>",
            "The Gemara explained why the egg mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>, an egg laid by a chicken that is a <i>tereifa</i>, cannot be nullified even if it is mingled with a thousand permitted eggs. However, <b>Rav Ashi said: Actually,</b> the <i>baraita</i> can be explained as referring to a case where there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether it is <b>a Festival or a weekday.</b> While it is true that according to most opinions this is a rabbinic prohibition, and the <i>halakha</i> is generally lenient with regard to uncertainties involving rabbinic law, <b>it is an object whose prohibition is temporary.

            "§ It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b><i>Aḥerim</i> say in the name of Rabbi Eliezer:</b> With regard to <b>an egg</b> laid on a Festival, <b>it and its mother may be eaten.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>With what</b> case <b>are we dealing?

            "The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances?</b> In which case is it necessary to apply this ruling? <b>Abaye said:</b> It is referring to a case <b>where</b> one <b>bought</b> this chicken <b>without specifying</b> whether he intended to eat it or use it for its eggs. In that case, if the chicken <b>was slaughtered</b> on a Festival, <b>it has been</b> retroactively <b>clarified that</b> it was <b>intended for food,</b> and the eggs it lays are, therefore, permitted.

            "<b>Rav Mari said</b> that the phrase: It and its mother may be eaten, should not be taken literally.

            "The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is</b> the meaning of this addition: <b>Its shell? If we say</b> it is referring to <b>an actual shell,</b> is <b>a shell edible?

            "§ <b>It was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> disputed the following issue (<i>Eiruvin</i> 38b): If <b>Shabbat and a Festival</b> occur on consecutive days, <b>Rav said:</b> An egg <b>laid on this one is prohibited on that one, and Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> An egg <b>laid on this one is permitted on that one.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>Rav holds</b> that when Shabbat and a Festival occur on consecutive days, <b>it is</b> considered <b>one</b> continuous <b>sanctity,</b> i.e., a single, indivisible day.",
            "<b>But didn’t Rav say: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>four elders,</b> who ruled <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who said:</b> When a Shabbat and a Festival occur consecutively, <b>they are two sanctities</b> rather than one long day; therefore, a joining of Shabbat boundaries need not be placed on a weekday, but may be placed on the first of the holy days to allow going beyond the Shabbat boundary on the second.

            "The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava’s host [<i>ushpizikhnei</i>] had these eggs</b> that were laid on a Festival that occurred on a Friday, and the host was unsure whether eggs laid on the Festival were permitted <b>from</b> the <b>Festival for</b> use on <b>Shabbat.

            "Rav Adda <b>said to him: What is your opinion</b> that led you to pose this question? You evidently assume that in the dispute between <b>Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> and therefore an egg laid on one day will be permitted on the following day.

            "<b>And it is taught</b> likewise in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>both an egg that was laid on Shabbat and an egg that was laid on a Festival, one may not move it, neither to cover a vessel with it nor to support the legs of a bed with it.</b>",
            "The Gemara relates a similar incident: <b>Rav Pappa’s host, and some say</b> it was <b>a certain man who came before Rav Pappa, had these eggs</b> that were laid on <b>a Shabbat that</b> occurred before <b>a Festival.

In earlier generations, they observed the second day of the Diaspora because they were unaware when the court sanctified the New Moon to mark the beginning of the month. Today, that determination is accomplished by means of calculations known to all, and the second day is observed as the custom of our fathers, not due to any uncertainty.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Asi was uncertain</b> whether the Sages’ ordinance that the second day is to be observed as a Festival was a fixed ordinance that applies even when the calculations determining the New Moon are known to all; or whether the ordinance was based strictly on the uncertainty stemming from their lack of awareness. Today, when everyone is aware of the beginning of the month, the second day is a weekday. <b>And</b> therefore <b>he acted stringently here,</b> and prohibited eating an egg on the second day that had been laid on the first day. <b>And</b> he also acted <b>stringently here,</b> and recited <i>havdala</i> between the two days.",

            "<b>Abaye said:</b> On the contrary, It is <b>reasonable</b> to say <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav</b> that the second day is observed as a Festival due to uncertainty, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Rosh HaShana</i> 22b): <b>Initially,</b> after the court sanctified the new month, <b>they would light torches</b> on the mountain tops, from one peak to another, to signal that the New Moon had been sanctified. <b>After the Samaritans</b> [<b><i>Kutim</i></b>] <b>disrupted</b> this method by lighting torches at the wrong times, the Sages <b>instituted that messengers should depart</b> to inform the people of the start of the month. Since the messengers could not reach all Diaspora communities before the beginning of the Festival, the Sages instituted that an additional Festival day should be observed there, due to the resultant uncertainty with regard to which day was the actual Festival day.",
            "Abaye continues his argument: <b>And</b> this indicates that <b>if</b> the <b>Samaritans had desisted</b> from their interference, the Sages would have restored the earlier custom and <b>we would observe</b> only <b>one day.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And now that we know the determination of the</b> first day of the new <b>month, what is the reason</b> that <b>we observe two</b> Festival <b>days</b> in the Diaspora? <b>Because they sent</b> a warning <b>from there,</b> from Eretz Yisrael: Although now there is a fixed calendar and there is no uncertainty, <b>be careful to</b> observe <b>the custom of your fathers</b> that <b>you received,</b> because <b>at times the monarchy</b> will <b>issue decrees</b> of persecution restricting Torah study and the fixed calendar may be forgotten. <b>And</b> the people will <b>come to</b> have their proper observance of the Festivals <b>be disrupted</b> again. However, the fundamental <i>halakha</i> is that the observance of two Festival days is based on uncertainty.",
            "§ <b>It was</b> further <b>stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> discussed a similar problem, with regard to the <b>two Festival days of Rosh HaShana. Rav and Shmuel both said:</b> An egg <b>laid on this</b> day <b>is prohibited on that one,</b> as the two days of Rosh HaShana have a special status. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Rosh HaShana</i> 30b): <b>Initially,</b> the court <b>would accept testimony of</b> witnesses who saw the new moon to establish the first day of <b>the</b> new <b>month.</b> This system would also be used for the first of Tishrei, which is Rosh HaShana, and the court would accept this testimony on <b>the entire</b> thirtieth <b>day</b> of the month of Elul. <b>Once, the witnesses tarried</b> and managed <b>to arrive</b> only when the hour was late,"

        [
            "<b>and the Levites erred in the song.</b> They were unsure whether to sing the weekday song or that of Rosh HaShana during the sacrifice of the afternoon daily offering, as it was unclear whether or not witnesses would arrive that day. From that point on, the court <b>instituted that they would accept witnesses</b> who came to testify that that day was Rosh HaShana <b>only up to <i>minḥa</i></b> time, i.e., when the daily afternoon offering was sacrificed. If witnesses had not arrived by then, they would declare Elul a thirty-day month and calculate the dates of the Festivals accordingly.",
            "<b>And if witnesses came from <i>minḥa</i></b> time <b>onward,</b> although the calculations for the dates of the Festivals began only from the following day, the people would nevertheless <b>observe that day</b> on which the witnesses arrived as <b>sacred, and</b> they would also observe <b>the following day</b> as <b>sacred.</b> On the second day, they observed Rosh HaShana in full, both by sacrificing its offerings as well as calculating the upcoming Festivals from that date. It is evident that the observance of two days of Rosh HaShana did not stem from uncertainty in the Diaspora as to when the Festival began. Rather, the Sages instituted that the two days of Rosh HaShana are one unit due to the inherent difficulty in determining the date of a Festival that is celebrated on the first of the month.",
            "<b>Rabba said: From</b> the time of <b>the ordinance of Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai onward, an egg</b> laid on one day of Rosh HaShana <b>is permitted</b> on the other. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Rosh HaShana</i> 30b): <b>After the Temple was destroyed, Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai instituted that</b> the court <b>should</b> once again <b>accept testimony</b> to determine the start of <b>the month all day.</b> Since the concern about errors was no longer relevant, they reverted to the original custom. As the court was aware of the exact date based on the testimony of the witnesses, those in proximity to the court kept only one day of Rosh HaShana. Those who lived far from the court observed two days merely due to uncertainty, and as one of those days was certainly a weekday, an egg laid on the first day was permitted on the second.",
            "<b>Abaye said to him: But didn’t Rav and Shmuel both say</b> that <b>an egg is prohibited?</b> Rabba <b>said to him:</b> Your question is out of place; <b>I say to you</b> a statement in the name of the distinguished <i>tanna</i> <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai, and you say to me</b> a ruling of the <i>amora’im</i> <b>Rav and Shmuel?</b>",

Conversely, <b>that</b> ruling of the mishna <b>is for them,</b> the inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael. Since Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai instituted that the court should once again accept testimony all day concerning the new moon, then even if circumstances dictate that Rosh HaShana would be observed for two days, each day is considered an independent sanctity.",
            "<b>And Rav Yosef said: Even from the</b> time of the <b>ordinance of Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai onward, an egg</b> remains <b>prohibited.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion of Rav Yosef? It is that the decree prohibiting an egg laid on the first day of Rosh HaShana on the second day of Rosh HaShana <b>is a matter that</b> was established <b>by a vote</b> of the Sanhedrin, after that occasion on which the witnesses failed to arrive on time, <b>and any matter that</b> was established <b>by a vote requires another vote to permit it.</b> A new vote must be taken to render the prohibited item permitted, as the prohibition does not lapse even if the reason for the decree no longer applies.",
            "<b>Rav Yosef said: From where do I say</b> my opinion? <b>As it is written,</b> after the Jews received the Torah: <b>“Go, say to them: Return to your tents”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:26), where “your tents” is referring to your wives. <b>And it says,</b> before the revelation at Sinai: <b>“When the ram’s horn sounds long, they may come up to the mount”</b> (Exodus 19:13). And it is stated: “Be ready for the third day, do not come near a woman” (Exodus 19:15). In other words, although the original prohibition served a particular purpose, in this case the giving of the Torah, it was nevertheless necessary to explicitly render the prohibition permitted.",
            "<b>And</b> this idea <b>was</b> likewise <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The fruit of a <b>fourth-year grapevine</b> have the status of second-tithe fruits, and therefore their owner <b>would ascend to Jerusalem</b> and eat them there. If he was unable to do so, due to the distance involved or the weight of the load, he could redeem the fruits with money where he was, and later redeem that money for other fruits in Jerusalem. However, the Sages decreed that fruit from the environs of Jerusalem should not be redeemed, but that the owners should bring the fruit itself to Jerusalem. The environs of Jerusalem for this purpose were defined as <b>a day’s walk in each direction.

The reason is that after the destruction of the Temple there is no need to adorn the markets of Jerusalem. The Gemara explains: <b>Who are: Your colleagues?</b> This is referring to <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai.</b>",
            "The Gemara infers from the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The reason is that they</b> explicitly <b>voted</b> to annul the decree, which indicates that if <b>they had not voted,</b> the ordinance would <b>not</b> have lapsed on its own, despite the fact that its justification was no longer applicable. Similarly, the prohibition of a laid egg is not nullified, as it was never explicitly permitted.",

            "<b>Now since it is written: “Neither shall the flocks nor the herds feed before that mount”</b> (Exodus 34:3), this indicates that the prohibition applies only when the Divine Presence is revealed on the mountain, and it is permitted immediately afterward.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who <b>taught this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>that the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who eats</b> one of the following parts <b>of the unslaughtered carcass of a kosher bird: From a cluster of eggs</b> that are still attached to it by sinews, or <b>from</b> its <b>bones, or from the sinews, or from meat that has been detached from a live</b> animal, is <b>ritually pure</b> because none of these are considered part of the meat of the bird, and therefore they do not impart the ritual impurity of an animal carcass.",
            "However, if one ate <b>from the ovary of</b> its <b>eggs,</b> which contains very small eggs that do not possess any of the regular characteristics of eggs, or if he took a piece <b>of the craw or the intestines, or if he melted the fat</b> of a dead bird <b>and swallowed it,</b> he is <b>ritually impure</b> from the impurity imparted by the unslaughtered carcass of a bird.",
            "<b>Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who <b>taught</b> that if one ate <b>from a cluster of eggs he is pure,</b> which indicates that eggs still attached by sinews to the chicken are not considered part of the meat of the bird? <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> This ruling is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ya’akov. For if</b> you say it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ya’akov, didn’t he say: If</b> the eggs <b>were attached by sinews</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to eat them with milk, indicating that he considers these eggs meat of the chicken.",
            "<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>From where</b> do you draw this conclusion? <b>Perhaps Rabbi Ya’akov stated</b> that these eggs are part of the chicken <b>only there, with regard to</b> the <b>prohibition</b> against eating the eggs with milk; <b>however,</b> perhaps <b>with regard to ritual impurity</b> he did <b>not</b> say that these eggs are considered part of the chicken.",
            "<b>And if you say</b> that <b>with regard to</b> ritual <b>impurity let us also issue a decree</b> and be stringent in a case of uncertainty and therefore rule that these attached eggs should be considered part of the chicken, <b>this</b> would serve to <b>proliferate impurity, and we do not proliferate impurity</b> that is <b>by rabbinic law.</b> One does not declare an item ritually impure by rabbinic law merely because uncertainty has arisen with regard to its status.",
            "<b>And some say</b> a different version of this discussion, according to which the question is: <b>Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who <b>taught</b> that if one eats <b>from the ovary of</b> its <b>eggs he is ritually impure? Rav Yosef said: It is Rabbi Ya’akov, who said: If</b> the eggs <b>were attached by sinews, they are prohibited. Abaye said to him: From where</b> do you know <b>that</b> the term <b>ovary</b> means: <b>From these</b> eggs <b>that are hanging from the ovary; perhaps</b> it is referring to the <b>ovary itself,</b> the part of the flesh of the bird where the eggs develop?",
            "<b>And if you say:</b> If it is referring to <b>the ovary itself, what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> this? It is obvious that the ovary itself is meat. One can answer as follows: <b>Just as it is in</b> the case of <b>the craw and the intestines, that even though they are meat</b> according to all opinions, <b>since there are people who do not eat</b> them, <b>it was necessary to teach us</b> that they have the status of meat; <b>here, too,</b> with regard to an ovary, <b>since there are people who do not eat</b> it, <b>it was necessary to teach us</b> that it may not be eaten with milk. Therefore, this argument does not prove that this version of the discussion is incorrect.",
            "§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Any</b> species <b>whose intercourse</b> occurs only <b>in the</b> hours of the <b>day</b> is <b>born</b> only <b>by day; any</b> species <b>whose intercourse occurs</b> only <b>at night is born</b> only <b>by night; any</b> species <b>whose intercourse occurs either by day or by night is born either by day or by night.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>Any</b> species <b>whose intercourse occurs by day is born by day, this</b> is referring to <b>a chicken. Any</b> species <b>whose intercourse occurs by night is born by night, this is a bat. Any</b> species <b>whose intercourse occurs either by day or by night,</b> this means <b>a human</b> being <b>and all that are similar to him.</b>",
            "<b>The Master said: Any</b> species <b>whose intercourse occurs by day is born by day, this is a chicken.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the <b>practical</b> halakhic <b>difference</b> of this statement? The Gemara answers: The halakhic difference is with regard <b>to that which Rav Mari, son of Rav Kahana</b> said, <b>as Rav Mari, son of Rav Kahana said:</b> If one <b>examined a chicken’s nest on a Festival eve and did not find an egg in it, and the following day,</b> on the Festival, <b>he rose early and found an egg in it,</b> the egg is <b>permitted,</b> as it can be assumed it was not laid that night.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t he examine</b> the nest before the Festival and fail to find an egg there? If so, the egg must have been laid on the Festival. The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that <b>he did not examine very carefully.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul say</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> If <b>one examined a chicken’s nest on a Festival eve and did not find an egg in it, and the following day he rose early and found an egg in it, it is prohibited?</b> This indicates that a chicken might indeed lay an egg at night. The Gemara answers: <b>There</b> it is referring <b>to</b> an egg <b>that</b> the chicken <b>absorbed from the earth,</b> i.e., one that was not formed by male fertilization. An egg that is not produced by intercourse can be laid at night as well.",
            "The Gemara challenges this: <b>If so,</b> in <b>Rav Mari’s</b> case <b>too,</b> you can <b>say that</b> the chicken <b>absorbed from the earth</b> and laid the egg during the night of the Festival. How, then, could Rav Mari permit the egg? The Gemara answers: There it is referring <b>to</b> a case <b>where there is a male with it.</b> The Gemara asks: Even <b>where there is a male with it,</b> one can <b>also say that it absorbed from the earth</b> rather than from the male. The Gemara answers that <b>Ravina said:</b> It is <b>learned</b> as a tradition that <b>anywhere that a male is present,</b> a chicken <b>does not absorb from the earth.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Until where</b> exactly is it considered to have a male with it; How near must a rooster be for this principle to come into effect? <b>Rav Gamda said in the name of Rav:</b> The male must be <b>any place</b>"

            "The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Mari took action</b> in accordance with this opinion, when he found an egg on a Festival morning after he had looked in the nest the day before and failed to find an egg there. He examined <b>up to</b> a distance of <b>sixty houses</b> from the chicken, and although he did not find a rooster within this area, he assumed there was one further away and permitted the egg.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>And if</b> there is <b>a river</b> between the rooster and the chicken, the chicken <b>does not cross</b> the river; <b>but if there is a bridge,</b> it <b>crosses</b> the river. <b>And if there is</b> only <b>a rope bridge</b> suspended across the river, the chicken will <b>not cross</b> on the rope. The Gemara comments: Nevertheless, <b>an incident</b> occurred in which a chicken <b>crossed over on a rope bridge.</b> However, one may not rely on this possibility.",
            "The Gemara further asks: <b>In what</b> manner <b>did you establish</b> this <i>halakha</i> of Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul, who prohibits eating an egg discovered in a nest on a Festival morning after the previous day’s examination revealed nothing? You said that it is referring to a case <b>in</b> which the chicken <b>absorbed from the earth.</b> If so, <b>why</b> discuss <b>specifically</b> a situation in which <b>one examined</b> the nest the evening before? The same <i>halakha</i> should apply <b>even when one did not examine</b> the nest beforehand.",
            "The Gemara answers: In a case <b>where he did not examine</b> the nest, one could <b>say</b> that the egg <b>was</b> laid <b>yesterday,</b> and there is no reason to prohibit its use. Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul therefore specified that he checked the day before and is certain that the egg was not laid prior to the Festival. The Gemara challenges this: <b>If so, when he examined</b> the nest <b>as well, say:</b> Perhaps this <b>is</b> a case in which <b>most of</b> the egg <b>emerged and returned, and</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan?</b> The Gemara answers: The case discussed <b>by Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> where most of the egg emerged from the chicken and returned, <b>is uncommon,</b> and therefore it is assumed not to have occurred.",
            "Apropos one statement of Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul in the name of Rav, the Gemara cites another ruling that <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul said</b> that <b>Rav said: This crushed garlic</b> poses the <b>danger of exposure.</b> If mashed garlic is not properly covered, there is concern that a snake might have tasted from it and thereby injected its venom into the food. This garlic is consequently prohibited as a health risk.",
            "§ The mishna states that <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> The measure that determines liability for <b>leaven</b> is <b>an olive-bulk.</b> However, the measure for leavened bread is greater, a large date-bulk. According to Beit Hillel, the measure in both cases is an olive-bulk.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Beit Shammai?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that the measures are equal, <b>let the Merciful One write</b> only the prohibition of <b>leavened bread, and it would not be necessary</b> to write <b>leaven, and I would say</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>If</b> the measure that determines liability for <b>leavened bread, whose leavening is not</b> as <b>extensive,</b> is <b>an olive-bulk,</b> then <b>leaven, whose leavening is extensive, all the more so</b> should the measure that determines liability be an olive-bulk. If so, <b>why do I</b> need the explicit reference to <b>leaven that the Merciful One wrote</b> in the verse: “Seven days there shall be no leaven found in your houses” (Exodus 12:19)? It must be <b>to tell you</b> that <b>the measure of this,</b> leavened bread, <b>is not equal to the measure of that,</b> leaven. Rather, the measure that determines liability for leaven is smaller.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And Beit Hillel</b> maintain that both the mention of both leaven and leavened bread <b>are necessary.

            "<b>And</b> conversely, <b>if the Merciful One had written</b> only <b>leavened bread,</b> I would have said that the measure that determines liability for leavened bread is an olive-bulk, <b>because it is fit for consumption</b> on its own; <b>however, leaven, which is not fit for consumption</b> on its own but only when used as a leavening agent for dough, <b>say no,</b> its measure is not like that of leavened bread. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to mention both cases.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And Beit Shammai, don’t they hold</b> in accordance with <b>Rabbi Zeira’s</b> opinion? <b>As Rabbi Zeira said,</b> the verse states: “Seven days there shall be no leaven found in your houses, for whoever eats that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the assembly of Israel” (Exodus 12:19). <b>The verse begins with leaven and ends with leavened bread to say to you</b> that <b>leaven is equivalent to leavened bread.</b> How, then, can Beit Shammai maintain that the two are prohibited by different measures?",
            "The Gemara answers: Indeed, <b>with regard to</b> the measure that determines liability for <b>eating, everyone agrees</b> that the same measure applies to leavened bread and leaven. <b>When they disagree</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> the <b>removal</b> of leavened bread from one’s house. <b>Beit Shammai hold</b> that <b>we do not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>removal from</b> that of <b>eating.</b> Rather, with regard to the obligation of removal, different measures apply to leavened bread and leaven. <b>And Beit Hillel hold</b> that <b>we derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>removal from</b> the measure that determines liability for <b>eating.</b>",
            "The Gemara comments: This idea <b>was also stated</b> explicitly by <i>amora’im</i>. <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel was stated <b>with regard to</b> the <b>removal</b> of leavened bread; however, <b>with regard to</b> the measure that determines liability for <b>eating, everyone agrees</b> that the measure for both <b>this and that</b> is <b>an olive-bulk.</b>",

            "The Gemara analyzes the wording of the mishna: <b>One who slaughters</b> an animal; this indicates that <b>after the fact, yes,</b> one may dig out dirt, but <b><i>ab initio</i>, no,</b> even Beit Shammai agree that one may not slaughter an undomesticated animal or a bird if there is no prepared dirt. Otherwise, the mishna would have said: One may slaughter an undomesticated animal or a bird on a Festival. <b>Say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>And Beit Hillel say</b> that one <b>may not slaughter</b> it. This proves <b>by inference that the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> Beit Shammai, <b>holds</b> that one <b>may slaughter</b> it even <i>ab initio</i>.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as Beit Hillel <b>said</b> and meant the following: <b>One may not slaughter</b> an animal <b>and cover</b> the blood. They are emphasizing that one may not cover the blood even if he slaughtered an animal, whereas Beit Shammai maintain that if one slaughtered he may cover the blood <i>ab initio</i>.",
            "The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>Say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>And</b> Beit Hillel <b>concede that if he</b> already <b>slaughtered, then he may dig with a shovel and cover</b> the blood, which indicates that Beit Hillel were not emphasizing the covering of the blood. This proves <b>by inference that</b> the <b>first clause</b> of the mishna <b>is not</b> referring to one’s action <b>after the fact,</b> but to the <i>halakha ab initio</i>.",
            "<b>Rabba said</b> that <b>this is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying.</b> The phrase: One who slaughters an animal, is not a broad directive on how to act, but rather it means: If there is <b>one who slaughters</b> animals <b>who comes to consult</b> a Sage on how to proceed, <b>what</b> should the Sage <b>say to him?

It <b>is not stated:</b> Cover it with <b>earth, but “in earth,”</b> indicating that the blood must be concealed inside the earth.

            "Abaye is suggesting <b>that the Master is of</b> the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Zeira,</b> and therefore he requires one to dig first and only afterward slaughter the animal and have the blood flow onto that earth and then cover it with additional earth, <b>and</b> that <b>Rabba is of</b> the opinion that the ruling is <b>not</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Zeira.</b>",

The Gemara answers: This ruling is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Abba, as Rabbi Abba said: One who digs a hole on Shabbat,</b> but he <b>needs only its earth</b> and has no interest in forming a pit, <b>is exempt for</b> that act. Since he has no interest in the hole, he is considered to have performed a destructive act, and the <i>halakha</i> is that one who commits a destructive act is not liable for the performance of prohibited labor on Shabbat and Festivals.",
            "§ The mishna states: <b>That the ashes of a stove are prepared.</b> The Gemara express puzzlement at this statement: <b>The ashes of a stove, who mentioned anything about it?</b> Why does the mishna suddenly speak about the ashes of a stove when it had not previously discussed or even mentioned them? <b>Rabba said: This is what</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>said: And the ashes of a stove are prepared.</b> In other words, everyone agrees that in addition to prepared earth, the ashes of a stove are also considered prepared, and one may cover the blood with them. It is not necessary to prepare these ashes especially for this purpose the day before.",
            "<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: They only taught</b> that the ashes of a stove are considered prepared if the stove <b>was ignited on the Festival eve,</b> so that the ashes had already formed at the start of the Festival. <b>However,</b> if <b>it was ignited on the Festival</b> itself, the ashes are <b>prohibited.

            "The Gemara comments: <b>That</b> opinion <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>When they said</b> that <b>the ashes of a stove are prepared, they said</b> so <b>only when it was ignited on the Festival eve; however,</b> if <b>it was ignited on the Festival,</b> they are <b>prohibited. And if</b> the ashes are still hot and <b>fit to roast an egg in them,</b> they are <b>permitted.</b>",
            "The Gemara further states: If before the Festival <b>one brought earth into his garden or his ruin</b> to use for various needs, <b>it is permitted to cover</b> blood <b>with it.

            "With regard to this case, <b>Mar Zutra</b> added and <b>taught</b> in public <b>in the name of Mar Zutra the Great</b> that the application of this <i>halakha</i> is limited: <b>And that is</b> the case only <b>if one designated a corner for this</b> earth, thereby demonstrating that he intends to use it for all his requirements, rather than merely bringing earth in to scatter over the floor of the house. In that case, the dirt is nullified. It is considered part of the floor, which means that it is once again classified as <i>muktze</i>.",
            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> against this from a mishna (<i>Bikkurim</i> 4:9): In the case of <b>a <i>koy</i>,</b> a kosher animal with characteristics of both domesticated and non-domesticated animals, <b>one may not slaughter it on a Festival,</b> as it is uncertain whether or not its blood requires covering. <b>And if one did slaughter it, he may not cover its blood.

Rather,</b> this mishna must be referring to a situation <b>where one does not have</b> prepared earth to use for covering the blood; <b>here too,</b> one can say <b>that he does not have</b> a basket of earth ready for all his needs.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> if the mishna is referring to a situation where one does not have prepared earth, <b>why</b> discuss <b>specifically</b> the case of a <i>koy</i>, where there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether there is a mitzva to cover its blood? <b>Even</b> in the case of an undomesticated animal, whose blood must <b>certainly</b> be covered, slaughter should <b>also not</b> be permitted, as the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel that one may not slaughter if he does not have prepared earth.",
            "The Gemara explains that this <i>baraita</i> <b>is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>It is not necessary,</b> as follows: <b>It is not necessary</b> to state the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>definite</b> undomesticated animals and birds, <b>that</b> it is <b>not</b> permitted <b>to slaughter</b> them; <b>however,</b> with regard to <b>an uncertainty,</b> one might <b>say: Due to the joy of the Festival let one slaughter</b> it <b>and not cover</b> its blood, as there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether there is a mitzva to cover its blood, and therefore it is overridden by the mitzva to rejoice on a Festival. The <i>baraita</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that one should not slaughter it <i>ab initio</i> if he does not have something prepared with which to cover the blood."
        ],
        [
            "The Gemara challenges this: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause teaches: And if he slaughtered it one may not cover its blood, it may be inferred that in the first clause we are dealing with</b> a situation <b>where he does have</b> something with which to cover the blood. If he does not have anything he can use, why is it necessary to state that one may not cover it? And consequently, if he does in fact have material with which to cover the blood, why may he not do so, either with his basket of earth, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, or with the ashes of a stove?",
            "<b>Rather, Rabba said</b> that <b>the ashes of a stove,</b> which the mishna stated are prepared, are <b>prepared</b> only <b>for</b> covering the blood in a case of <b>a definite</b> obligation, but they <b>are not</b> considered <b>prepared for</b> a case of <b>uncertainty.</b> Although his intention was to use these ashes to cover the blood of any animal he slaughters, whether in a definite or an uncertain case, they are nevertheless not considered prepared for an uncertain case.",
            "The Gemara inquires: In a case <b>of uncertainty, what is the reason</b> that the ashes are not considered prepared? If the reason is <b>that one makes a hole</b> in the mound of ashes when he removes part of it for covering, in <b>a definite</b> case <b>he also makes a hole.</b> If it is prohibited to make a hole, that prohibition applies in all cases. <b>Rather,</b> one must say, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Abba,</b> that the making of this hole is not considered prohibited labor, as he is merely performing a destructive act. If so, <b>here too,</b> in a case of uncertainty, there should be no cause for concern, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Abba.</b>",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara retracts from the previous suggestion and offers an alternative: With regard to a case of <b>uncertainty, what is the reason</b> that it is prohibited? The reason is that <b>perhaps one</b> will forget and <b>perform crushing</b> with this earth, to ready it for covering. However, the same problem arises as before: If so, <b>we should also decree</b> against covering the blood in <b>a definite</b> case, <b>because</b> he might <b>crush</b> the earth. The Gemara answers: This presents no difficulty, as when one fulfills the mitzva of covering the blood in <b>a definite</b> case, even <b>if he performs crushing,</b> the <b>positive</b> mitzva of covering the blood <b>comes and overrides</b> the <b>prohibition</b> concerning the desecration of a Festival.",
            "The Gemara challenges this: <b>Say that we said</b> the following principle: <b>A positive</b> mitzva <b>comes and overrides a prohibition</b> in a case <b>such as</b> the <b>circumcision of</b> a child who has <b>leprosy.</b> Cutting off a leprous blemish is a violation of a prohibition. However, if a baby’s foreskin is leprous, it is permitted to cut it off by circumcision. <b>Alternatively,</b> the principle applies to a case of a linen <b>cloak on</b> which woolen <b>ritual fringes</b> are placed, despite the prohibition against wearing diverse kinds, i.e., a mixture of wool and linen.",
            "The Gemara explains the difference between those <i>halakhot</i> and the issue at hand. In those cases, <b>at</b> the <b>time that one uproots</b> the <b>prohibition,</b> he <b>fulfills</b> the <b>positive</b> mitzva with the same act. However, <b>here,</b> in the case of covering blood, two separate actions are involved, as <b>at the time that one uproots</b> the <b>prohibition,</b> when he crushes the earth, he <b>does not fulfill</b> the <b>positive</b> mitzva of covering the blood. The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as it is possible to say <b>that when one crushes</b> the earth, <b>he covers</b> the blood with it; he fulfills the positive mitzva by means of the same action through which he uproots the prohibition.",
            "The Gemara challenges this explanation from a different perspective: <b>Ultimately, a Festival is</b> a mitzva that includes both the <b>positive</b> mitzva of rest <b>and</b> also the <b>prohibition</b> against performing prohibited labor, <b>and</b> there is a principle that <b>a positive</b> mitzva by itself <b>does not override a prohibition and a positive</b> mitzva together.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara rejects the previous explanation, in favor of the following. <b>Rava said:</b> One’s initial <b>intention</b> is to use <b>the ashes of a stove for</b> a mitzva that is <b>definite, and he does not have</b> this <b>intention for</b> cases of <b>uncertainty.</b> One may not use an article on a Festival for a purpose which he did not have in mind beforehand.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>And Rava follows his</b> regular line of <b>reasoning</b> in this regard, <b>as Rava said:</b> If one <b>brought in earth</b> in order <b>to cover</b> a baby’s <b>excrement with it</b> on a Festival, <b>it is</b> likewise <b>permitted to cover with it the blood of</b> a slaughtered <b>bird.</b> Since he prepared this earth for a case of uncertainty, as it is possible that the baby will not soil the house, he certainly intended to use it for covering the blood of a bird prepared before the Festival for slaughter. If, however, one prepared the earth at the outset to cover <b>the blood of a bird, it is prohibited to cover excrement with it,</b> as he did not know in advance that he would require the earth for this purpose. He had only definite uses in mind, not possible ones such as covering excrement.",
            "The Sages <b>of Neharbela said: Even</b> if <b>one brought in earth to cover the blood of a bird with it, it is permitted to cover excrement with it,</b> as it cannot be said that he did not intend this usage.",
            "<b>They say in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, that <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥama and Rabbi Zeira disagree with regard to</b> this issue, <b>and some say</b> it was disputed by <b>Rava, son of Rav Yosef bar Ḥama,</b> commonly mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud as Rava, without the patronymic, <b>and Rabbi Zeira.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>One</b> of them <b>said</b> that <b>a <i>koy</i> is similar to excrement</b> in this regard. Just as one may cover the blood of a bird with earth brought in for the purpose of covering excrement, he may likewise use it for covering the blood of a <i>koy</i>, as both the case of excrement and the case of the <i>koy</i> are cases of uncertainty. <b>And</b> the other <b>one said: A <i>koy</i> is not similar to excrement.</b> Since the covering of excrement is common, it is regarded as a definite purpose in comparison to a <i>koy</i>, which is by definition an uncertain case. It is therefore prohibited to cover the blood of a <i>koy</i> with earth prepared for the sake of covering excrement.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>Conclude that Rava is the one who said</b> that <b>a <i>koy</i> is similar to excrement, as Rava said:</b> If one <b>brought in earth to cover excrement with it, it is permitted to cover the blood of a bird with it;</b> if he did bring in earth to cover <b>the blood of a bird, it is prohibited to cover excrement with it.</b> One intends to use the earth for the definite rather than the uncertain purpose, and likewise in the case of a <i>koy</i>. The Gemara summarizes: Indeed, <b>conclude</b> that this is the correct version of the opinions in the dispute.",
            "§ <b>Rami, son of Rav Yeiva, said</b> a different reason: In the case of <b>a <i>koy</i>, this is the reasoning</b> for the <i>halakha</i> <b>that one may not cover</b> its blood: It is not because this action would constitute prohibited labor; rather, <b>it is</b> a rabbinic <b>decree due to the permission of its</b> prohibited <b>fat.</b> If one were to cover its blood, people might think that a <i>koy</i> is definitely an undomesticated animal, and it is well known that the fats of an undomesticated animal may be eaten, whereas those of a domesticated animal are prohibited.",
            "The Gemara challenges this: <b>If so, even on a weekday as well,</b> the blood of a <i>koy</i> should not be covered, due to this concern. The Gemara answers: <b>On a weekday,</b> people will <b>say</b> that <b>he needs to clean his courtyard,</b> and that he is covering the blood merely to keep his courtyard presentable, rather than to fulfill the mitzva of covering blood.",

Alternatively, if <b>he comes to consult</b> a Sage concerning whether or not he should cover the blood of a <i>koy</i> on a weekday, <b>what is there to say?</b> If the owner of the <i>koy</i> is instructed to cover the blood, would he not come to the erroneous conclusion that its fats are permitted?",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara answers: <b>On a weekday, even if</b> the matter <b>is uncertain, the Sages</b> nevertheless <b>say to him: Go</b> and <b>take the trouble and cover</b> it, as it involves the possible fulfillment of a mitzva. <b>On a Festival,</b> however, <b>if</b> there is <b>uncertainty, would the Sages say to him: Go</b> and <b>take the trouble and cover</b> it? If one was told to cover the blood on a Festival, this would indicate that a <i>koy</i> is definitely an undomesticated animal.",
            "<b>Rabbi Zeira teaches</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Not only did</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that the blood of <b>a <i>koy</i></b> should not be covered on a Festival, <b>but even if one slaughtered a domesticated animal,</b> whose blood need not be covered, and also slaughtered <b>an undomesticated animal or a fowl,</b> whose blood must be covered, <b>and their bloods became mingled together,</b> it is <b>prohibited to cover</b> the mixture of blood <b>on a Festival.</b>",

            "The Gemara comments: It is <b>obvious</b> that this is the case; since he covers all the blood in a single action, clearly he performs a mitzva.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel, why does one need to say: I</b> will <b>take this</b> one <b>and that</b> one? <b>Let him say: From here,</b> this dovecote, <b>I will take tomorrow.</b> Why does one have to specify exactly which fledglings he plans to remove from the dovecote?",
            "<b>And if you say</b> that <b>Beit Hillel do not accept</b> the principle of retroactive <b>designation,</b> i.e., they reject the idea that a person’s original intention can be clarified retroactively, and therefore it cannot be said that the fledglings one takes on the Festival were the ones he had in mind beforehand, <b>but didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Ohalot</i> 7:3): If <b>a corpse</b> is located <b>in a house, and</b> the house <b>has many entrances,</b> whether they are open or closed, not only is the inside of the house ritually impure as a tent of the dead, but <b>all</b> the entrances <b>are</b> likewise <b>ritually impure</b> and impart impurity to the vessels they contain? The reason is that the corpse might be removed via any of the entrances, and therefore they all contract impurity.",
            "If only <b>one of</b> the entrances <b>was open</b> after the person died, that entrance alone <b>is ritually impure,</b> as the corpse will certainly be removed through it, <b>and all</b> the other entrances remain <b>ritually pure.</b> The same applies if <b>one decided</b> from the outset <b>to remove</b> the corpse <b>through one of</b> the entrances, <b>or</b> to carry it out <b>through a window that is four by four</b> handbreadths in size, which is large enough for a corpse. This intention <b>spares all the</b> other <b>entrances</b> from ritual impurity, as it is clear that the corpse will not be removed through them.",
            "With regard to this case, <b>Beit Shammai say: This</b> <i>halakha</i> applies only <b>if one had decided to remove</b> the corpse by a particular entrance <b>before the person died,</b> so that the entrance through which the body would be removed was already determined at the time of death. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> This <i>halakha</i> applies <b>even after the person died,</b> as the principle of retroactive designation is invoked, which means that the entrance through which the deceased will be removed is retroactively designated. This indicates that Beit Hillel do accept the principle of retroactive designation.",
            "The Gemara refutes this proof: <b>Wasn’t it stated</b> by <i>amora’im</i> <b>with regard to this</b> mishna that <b>Rabba said:</b> In this case, Beit Hillel referred only <b>to purifying the entrances from that point forward.</b> In other words, after one has decided on an entrance that he will use to remove the dead, any vessels in the space of the other entrances do not become ritually impure. However, vessels that were located inside the space of the other entrances before the decision was made remain impure. According to these <i>amora’im</i>, Beit Hillel do not accept the principle of retroactive designation. <b>And, so too, Rav Oshaya said:</b> This <i>halakha</i> is referring <b>to purifying the entrances from that point forward,</b> which indicates: <b>From here onward, yes,</b> the entrances are ritually pure; <b>retroactively, no,</b> they are not considered pure.",
            "<b>Rava said</b> that there is a different way to resolve the conflicting rulings of Beit Hillel: <b>Actually,</b> in the case of ritual impurity, Beit Hillel maintain that all the entrances are ritually pure <b>retroactively. And here,</b> with regard to fledglings, <b>this is the reason</b> why Beit Hillel insist that one designate which particular fledglings one plans to take on the Festival: <b>Perhaps one will move</b> fledglings, <b>and put</b> them <b>down,</b> and again <b>move</b> them, <b>and put</b> them <b>down</b> until he finds the pair he wants, thereby <b>moving an object that is not suitable for him,</b> i.e., which is <i>muktze</i>.",

In this case, too, he does not touch them. It is therefore possible that he may reconsider his choice of fledglings on the Festival after he handles them. The Gemara answers: <b>This applies only</b> when one made his choice <b>on the eve of the Festival.</b> Since he knows that he may not alter his decision on the Festival itself even if he does not like the ones he chose, he definitively decides to take those fledglings and will not handle others."

This concerns a <i>ḥaver</i>, a member of a group that is meticulous with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity, <b>who opens his barrel</b> of wine or prepares <b>and begins</b> to sell <b>his dough</b> to pilgrims <b>for the sake of the Festival.</b>",
            "<b>And</b> this is <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who said: He may finish</b> selling all the bread made from that dough and all the wine in the barrel. Wine or dough sold to the general public is usually classified as ritually impure, as it might have been touched by an <i>am ha’aretz</i>, one who is not careful with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity. During a Festival, however, the Sages decreed that all wine and dough sold in Jerusalem is ritually pure, so as not to embarrass ignorant people, and they may therefore be bought even by a <i>ḥaver</i>. Rabbi Yehuda adds that even if a large quantity of wine or dough remains after the Festival, it retains its status as ritually pure and one may continue to sell it to a <i>ḥaver</i>. This is a case of permitting an action whose result is undesirable for the sake of an initial action, in that the Sages maintained the wine and dough’s status as ritually pure after the Festival in order to encourage people to sell wine and dough on the Festival.",

The Gemara explains: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>the reason of Beit Hillel</b> is <b>because</b> the hide <b>is fit for reclining on it, and</b> therefore <b>even</b> if the animal was slaughtered <b>on the eve of the Festival,</b> it would <b>also</b> be permitted to spread out its hide on the Festival. Ulla therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the reason for the leniency is that the Sages <b>permitted</b> an action <b>whose result</b> was undesirable <b>in order</b> to encourage a desirable <b>initial</b> action.

To counter this logic, Ulla therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the reason the Sages allowed the replacement of shutters of shops on a Festival is because they <b>permitted</b> an action <b>whose result</b> is undesirable <b>in order</b> to encourage a desirable <b>initial</b> action. Consequently, in the case of the shutters <b>of shops, yes,</b> they permitted their replacement; in the case of those <b>of houses, no,</b> they did not allow it.",

It is <b>because rabbinic decrees prohibiting labor</b> do <b>not</b> apply <b>in the Temple.</b> Since the prohibition against applying a bandage is by rabbinic law, this leniency should apply to all who are in the Temple, <b>even</b> to <b>a priest who is not a candidate</b> to perform the Temple <b>service.</b> Ulla <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case; rather, it is an instance where the Sages <b>permitted a result for the sake of an initial action: If one is a candidate for service, yes,</b> he may replace his bandage; <b>if one is not a candidate for service, no,</b> he may not replace his bandage.",

            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that</b> the following mishna <b>supports him</b> (<i>Terumot</i> 10:6): With regard to <b>one who had bundles of fenugreek,</b> a type of legume, <b>of untithed produce, he may pound</b> these bundles to remove the seeds from them. <b>And he calculates how many seeds</b> the bundles <b>contain and separates <i>teruma</i></b> based <b>on the</b> quantity of <b>seeds, but</b> he <b>does not</b> calculate and <b>separate</b> <i>teruma</i> based <b>on the</b> quantity of <b>stalks.</b> Although the stalks and leaves are also used for cooking, it is not necessary to separate <i>teruma</i> from them. <b>What, is it not</b> the case that this <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, who said: There,</b> with regard to stalks of grain, it is <b>not</b> yet ready to be tithed, and therefore not prohibited as <b>untithed produce,</b> whereas <b>here,</b> i.e., with regard to the bundles of fenugreek, it is ready to be tithed and therefore prohibited as <b>untithed produce?</b>",
            "The Gemara rejects this contention: <b>No,</b> this is no proof, as it can be claimed that the mishna dealing with fenugreek <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who obligates one to separate <i>teruma</i> in the case of stalks of grain.

            "The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> it is referring to a different case, that of first tithe that is still regarded as <b>untithed produce,</b> because <b>of <i>teruma</i> of the tithe</b> that must still be separated from it. First tithe is given to the Levites, who must separate ten percent as <i>teruma</i> of the tithe, to give to the priests.

            "If this order was not followed, and the first tithe was separated first while the grain was still attached to the stalks, Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish maintains that the following <i>halakha</i> applies: <b>Its name,</b> i.e., the fact that it has been designated first tithe, <b>renders it</b> ready to be tithed and therefore prohibited as <b>untithed produce,</b> as pertains <b>to <i>teruma</i> of the tithe</b> that must still be separated from it. This shows that there can be a separation of a type of <i>teruma</i>, specifically the <i>teruma</i> of the tithe, even before work on the produce has been completed, and this is the case to which the previously quoted mishna is referring.",
            "The Gemara challenges this interpretation: If first tithe is considered untithed produce when it is named, <b>why do I</b> need the act of <b>pounding?

            "The Gemara comments: <b>That</b> opinion <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>.

However, according to the suggestion that it is referring to a first tithe, from which <i>teruma</i> of the tithe must be separated, why does the mishna state: <b>Calculates?</b> The <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>should have said: Measures.</b> The amount of <i>teruma gedola</i> to be separated is calculated by estimation, as there is no fixed amount for this <i>teruma</i> according to Torah law. With regard to the <i>teruma</i> separated from first tithe, however, the Torah established the fixed amount of one-tenth, and one is required to measure precisely.",
            "The Gemara explains: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna?

            "§ Since it was mentioned incidentally, the Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said:</b> With regard to <b>first tithe, in a case in which</b> the Levite <b>preceded</b> the priest while the grain was still <b>on the stalks, its name renders it untithed produce,</b> until he separates from it the <b><i>teruma</i> of the tithe.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rava said: Since the name of</b> the first <b>tithe was called upon it,</b> the obligation of the <i>teruma</i> of the tithe takes effect as well.",
            "The Gemara cites a similar <i>halakha</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said:</b> With regard to <b>first tithe, in a case in which</b> the Levite <b>preceded</b> the priest while the grain was still <b>on the stalks,</b> before it was threshed and turned into a pile, the owner separated first tithe before <i>teruma</i>. In that case, the separated tithe is <b>exempt from <i>teruma gedola</i>.</b> Although <i>teruma gedola</i> should have been separated from the produce first, and it should have included some of the produce taken as the first tithe, the Levite is nevertheless exempt from separating this <i>teruma</i>.",
            "This is because <b>it is stated: “And you shall set apart from it a <i>teruma</i> for the Lord, even a tenth part of the tithe”</b> (Numbers 18:26), which indicates: <b>A tenth part of the tithe,</b> i.e., the <i>teruma</i> of the tithe, <b>I,</b> God, <b>said to you</b> that you must separate it, <b>and</b> you are <b>not</b> obligated in both <b><i>teruma gedola</i> and <i>teruma</i> of the tithe from the</b> first <b>tithe.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: If so,</b> if there is a source for this <i>halakha</i> in the Torah, <b>even if</b> the Levite <b>preceded</b> the priest, i.e., first tithe was separated after the grain had been threshed and the kernels of grain placed <b>in a pile,</b> then it should <b>also be exempt</b> from <i>teruma gedola</i>. Abaye <b>said to</b> Rav Pappa: <b>With regard to your</b> claim, <b>the verse states: “From all that is given you, you shall set apart that which is the Lord’s <i>teruma</i>”</b> (Numbers 18:29). This verse indicates that God’s <i>teruma</i>, i.e., <i>teruma gedola</i>, must be taken from all the produce, including the tithe.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And what did you see</b> that led you to require the separation of <i>teruma gedola</i> from first tithe that was taken from processed grain piled in the granary but not from first tithe that was taken from grain on stalks? Abaye answers: <b>This,</b> grain that has been threshed and placed into piles, is completely processed and <b>has become grain, and that,</b> grain that remains on the stalk, <b>has not</b> yet <b>become grain.</b> Until the grain is threshed and assembled in a pile, the obligation to separate <i>teruma</i> does not take effect, as it is not considered grain. When such unprocessed grain is designated first tithe, it ceases to be untithed produce and the opportunity to separate <i>teruma</i> from it has been missed. However, once the grain has been processed, and the obligation to separate <i>teruma</i> has taken effect, it is as if the <i>teruma</i> is already mixed in, and the obligation to separate it cannot be overridden by the fact that this produce has been designated first tithe.",

Go and inform them</b> of this intention of Mine. <b>And from here Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: One who gives</b> a gift of <b>a piece of bread to a child must inform his mother</b> of his actions, so that the child’s parents will be aware of the giver’s fond feelings for them, thereby enhancing friendly relations and companionship among Jews. This appears to be in direct contradiction to Rabbi Ḥama’s statement.",
            "The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult; this</b> case, where one need not inform the recipient, <b>is referring to a gift that is likely to be revealed,</b> such as Moses’ shining face, which everyone would point out to him; <b>that</b> case, where one must inform the recipient, <b>is referring to a gift that is not likely to be revealed</b> in the natural course of events. The Gemara challenges: Isn’t <b>Shabbat also a gift that is likely to be revealed,</b> as the Jews would eventually be instructed with regard to the time and nature of Shabbat? The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, <b>its reward is not likely to be revealed.</b> Therefore, God told Moses to inform the Jews of the gift of Shabbat and its reward.",
            "<b>The Master said</b> earlier that <b>from here Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: One who gives a piece of bread to a child must inform his mother.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What does he do to him;</b> how does he inform the child’s mother? <b>He rubs oil on him and paints his eyes blue,</b> so that when the child arrives home his mother will ask him who did this to him and he will reply that it was a person who also gave him a piece of bread. The Gemara comments: <b>And nowadays, when we are concerned about witchcraft,</b> i.e., that painting the child’s eyes might have been performed as an act of sorcery, <b>what</b> should one do? <b>Rav Pappa said: He rubs on</b> the child a little <b>of that same type</b> of food that he put on the bread, such as butter or cheese, and this will cause the child’s mother to notice that he received a present.",
            "The Gemara cites a further statement with regard to the gift of Shabbat to the Jewish people. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: All</b> the <b>mitzvot that the Holy One, Blessed be He, gave to the Jewish people, He gave to them in public [<i>parhesya</i>] except for Shabbat, which he gave to them in private.

The Gemara answers: The Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>did inform them</b> of the concept of <b>Shabbat,</b> but He <b>did not inform them</b> of <b>the reward</b> for the fulfillment of the mitzva. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>He also informed</b> the gentiles of <b>its reward,</b> but about the idea of the <b>additional soul</b> given to each person on Shabbat <b>He did not inform them.</b>",

However, one who employs artifice to circumvent a prohibition thinks that he is acting in a permitted manner. He is therefore likely to continue his practice. Furthermore, people might emulate him, and the <i>halakha</i> of preparing an <i>eiruv</i> might be forgotten.",
            "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that there is another reason to reject the proof from this <i>baraita</i>: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Ḥananya and in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Ḥananya says</b> that <b>Beit Shammai say: One may not bake</b> bread on a Festival for Shabbat <b>unless he prepared an <i>eiruv</i></b> for the joining of cooked foods on the eve of the Festival specifically <b>with bread; and one may not cook</b> any type of dish <b>unless he prepared an <i>eiruv</i> with a cooked dish; and one may not insulate</b> food <b>unless there was hot</b> food <b>insulated from the eve of the Festival.</b>",
            "<b>And Beit Hillel say: One may prepare an <i>eiruv</i></b> for the joining of cooked foods <b>with one cooked dish and use it for all his needs,</b> i.e., baking, cooking, and insulating. Since Ḥananya’s opinion in accordance with the opinion of Beit Shammai is strict in this case, it may be assumed that he is stringent after the fact as well, and therefore the <i>baraita</i> provides no proof.",
            "The Gemara offers yet another suggestion. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna: In the case of <b>one who</b> transgressed a rabbinic prohibition and <b>tithed his produce on Shabbat,</b> if he did so <b>unwittingly, he may eat</b> of it; if he acted <b>intentionally, he may not eat</b> of it. This indicates that one may not derive benefit from a transgression that he committed intentionally. The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> with regard to a case <b>where he has other produce</b> and therefore does not greatly suffer as a result. However, the Sages may have been more lenient with one who did not make an <i>eiruv</i> for the joining of cooked food and consequently has nothing to eat.",
            "The Gemara poses another resolution: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a different source: In the case of <b>one who immerses his vessels on Shabbat,</b> an activity that the Sages prohibited because it is akin to repairing a vessel, if he did so <b>unwittingly, he may use them;</b> however, if he did so <b>intentionally, he may not use them.</b> This shows that the product of an action performed in a prohibited manner is prohibited.",
            "The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> with regard to a case <b>where he has other vessels</b> and is not forced to use these ones. <b>Alternatively, it is possible</b> for him to manage <b>by borrowing</b> vessels from others. But if one failed to set aside an <i>eiruv</i> for the joining of cooked foods, perhaps the Sages allowed him to eat the food he cooked on the Festival for Shabbat since it is difficult to obtain food from others on Shabbat.",
            "The Gemara suggests another proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which was taught in the following <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who cooks on Shabbat,</b> if he did so <b>unwittingly, he may eat</b> the food that he cooked; but if he cooked it <b>intentionally, he may not eat</b> it. This demonstrates that one who purposely violated a prohibition may not benefit from his prohibited action. The Gemara rejects this argument: There is no proof from here; the <b>prohibition of Shabbat</b> desecration <b>is different,</b> since it entails <i>karet</i> and execution by a court. The same stringency might not necessarily apply to cooking on a Festival for the sake of the next day, and therefore the question raised above remains unresolved.",
            "§ It is stated in the mishna: <b>Beit Shammai say</b> that for the purpose of the joining of cooked foods one must prepare <b>two cooked dishes,</b> whereas Beit Hillel say that one dish suffices.

An ordinary person, who eats non-consecrated produce, does not go to the trouble of purifying such a vessel, since regular produce contracts ritual impurity only from a vessel that came into contact with a primary source of impurity, but not from a vessel that came into contact with a derivative source of impurity. And as for priests, the general principle is that <b>priests are vigilant;</b> they are careful not to allow their vessels to become impure.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>It is different there; since it is permitted for her</b> to immerse the clothes <b>only by</b> wearing them as <b>garments, she remembers</b> that it is prohibited to immerse them by themselves and will not come to violate this prohibition.",
            "Apropos Rabba’s view that one may not immerse a vessel on Shabbat lest he come to carry it four cubits in the public domain, <b>Rav Yosef said</b> that it is prohibited to immerse a vessel on Shabbat for a different reason: It is <b>a decree</b> issued by the Sages as a preventive measure <b>due to</b> the prohibition against <b>wringing.</b> After immersing certain items, such as clothes, one might come to wring them, and this is prohibited on Shabbat and Festivals as a subcategory of the biblically prohibited labor of threshing.",

            "<b>Rav Beivai said</b> a different reason: The prohibition against immersing a vessel on a Festival is <b>a decree</b> issued by the Sages <b>lest one</b> come to <b>delay</b> the immersion of his impure vessels. Were the Sages to permit him to immerse vessels on a Festival, he might delay immersing all of his impure vessels until the Festival, when he has more free time; and were he to leave ritually impure vessels in his possession for a lengthy period, he might come to defile items that must be kept ritually pure, such as <i>teruma</i>. The Gemara comments: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Beivai:</b> With regard to <b>a vessel that became ritually impure on the eve of a Festival, one may not immerse it on a Festival,</b> due to <b>a decree lest he</b> come to <b>delay</b> and keep impure vessels in his home in order to immerse them on the Festival.",
            "<b>Rava said</b> yet a different reason: It is prohibited to immerse a vessel on Shabbat <b>because it looks as if he is repairing the vessel.</b> Since the vessel was previously unfit for use, and the act of immersion renders it usable, this is similar to the repair of a vessel, which Torah law proscribes on Shabbat and Festivals. The Gemara challenges this understanding: <b>If so, a person</b> should <b>likewise</b> be prohibited to immerse himself, because it looks as if he is repairing himself through purification. The Gemara answers: <b>A person</b> undergoing immersion <b>looks as if he is cooling</b> himself.

Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Sometimes a person comes</b> home <b>from the field soiled with mud and excrement and washes</b> himself <b>even in the rainy season.</b>",
            "The Gemara continues with another objection: This works out <b>well</b> and explains why it is permitted for one to immerse himself <b>on Shabbat,</b> when it is permitted to wash, and therefore it can be argued that it is not clearly evident that he is immersing in order to purify himself; but <b>on Yom Kippur,</b> when all bathing apart from ritual immersion is prohibited, <b>what is there to say?</b> His actions prove that his intention is to purify himself, and this should be prohibited because it looks as though he is repairing himself through purification.",
            "<b>Rava said:</b> It is impossible to prohibit immersion on Yom Kippur alone, as <b>is there anything that is permitted on Shabbat and</b> the very same act is <b>prohibited</b> as labor <b>on Yom Kippur?</b> In fact, the prohibition against labor is more stringent on Shabbat than on Yom Kippur. <b>Rather, since it is permitted on Shabbat, it is also permitted on Yom Kippur.</b> The Sages did not issue decrees with regard to Yom Kippur that would make it more stringent than Shabbat. Therefore, since they allowed a person to immerse on Shabbat because it looks as if he is doing so for pleasure, to escape the heat or to remove dirt, and not necessarily in order to purify himself, they permitted it on Yom Kippur as well, even though it is evident in that situation that his immersion is for the purpose of achieving purity.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Does Rava accept</b> the principle of: <b>Since?

            "The Gemara completes its question: <b>And if it is so</b> that Rava accepts the principle of: Since, <b>let him say: Since it is permitted</b> to sip vinegar <b>before dipping, it is also permitted</b> to do so <b>after dipping.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rava retracted that</b> statement with regard to vinegar and accepted Abaye’s resolution of the difficulty, along with the principle of: Since.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And from where</b> can it be determined <b>that he retracted that</b> teaching? <b>Perhaps he retracted this</b> statement with regard to immersion in a ritual bath on Yom Kippur.

If one immerses an impure vessel during the twilight period, then owing to the uncertainty as to whether it is day or night, he must wait another full day, until the next sunset, before using the vessel. It is therefore preferable not to put oneself in a situation where one might come to use a vessel before its purification process has been completed.",

Consequently, it is prohibited to immerse the vessel during twilight on the eve of a Festival, as, since it may already be night and he will be unable to use the vessel until the next evening, immersing the vessel would be considered to be preparing something on a Festival for a weekday, which is prohibited. However, it is permitted to immerse a vessel during twilight on an ordinary weekday evening.",

In other words, if at first he merely intended to immerse his impure pitcher, but subsequently changed his mind and decided to use it for his winepress, and he wishes to immerse the pitcher a second time for the sake of the winepress, it is permitted to do so.",
            "Similarly, one who wishes to make <b>his pitcher in addition to</b> the purification of his vessels for the sake of <b>his winepress may do</b> so. That is to say, if he originally intended to use the pitcher for his winepress, and after immersing it he decided not to use it for that purpose, and now he wishes to immerse his pitcher a second time, it is permitted to do so. Since the second immersion does not purify the vessel or fulfill any obligation, it is not considered a proper immersion and is not prohibited on a Festival.",
            "Similarly, <b>how</b> does one immerse <b>from one group to another?</b> If one <b>was</b> planning to <b>eat</b> the Paschal offering <b>with this group,</b> and he immersed himself or his ritually impure vessels for that purpose; and now he has reconsidered <b>and wishes to eat</b> the offering <b>with a different group,</b> and he wants to immerse himself or his vessels a second time for the second group, in such a case <b>he has permission</b> to do so even on a Festival, for the same reason: Since this immersion is not obligatory, it is not viewed as an immersion at all.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Beit Shammai say: One may bring peace-offerings</b> on a Festival, <b>but one may not place</b> his <b>hands on them,</b> as this is considered using animals, which is prohibited on a Festival by rabbinic decree. <b>However, one may not</b> bring <b>burnt-offerings,</b> apart from the obligatory daily and additional offerings of the day, because burnt-offerings are consumed entirely on the altar and not by people, and slaughter is permitted on a Festival only for the purpose of human consumption. <b>And Beit Hillel say: One may bring</b> both <b>peace-offerings and burnt-offerings, and one may</b> even <b>place</b> his <b>hands on them.</b>",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Ulla said:</b> The <b>dispute</b> applies only <b>to Festival peace-offerings,</b> an obligation of the Festival, <b>with respect to placing hands</b> on them, <b>and to burnt-offerings of appearance,</b> which must be brought over the course of the Festival, <b>with respect to sacrificing</b> them. As <b>Beit Shammai hold</b> that the verse <b>“You shall observe [<i>vaḥaggotem</i>] it as a Festival to the Lord</b> seven days in the year” (Leviticus 23:41) indicates: <b>Festival peace-offerings [<i>ḥagiga</i>], yes,</b> they may be sacrificed even on a Festival day, but <b>burnt-offerings of appearance, no,</b> they may not. <b>And Beit Hillel hold: “To the Lord”</b> means that <b>anything</b> brought <b>as</b> an offering <b>to the Lord</b> may be sacrificed throughout the seven days of the holiday, even on the actual Festival day.",
            "<b>But</b> with regard to <b>vow</b>-offerings <b>and gift-offerings,</b> which are not part of the obligations of the day, <b>all agree,</b> even Beit Hillel, that they <b>may not be sacrificed on a Festival.

            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> against Ulla’s statement from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree with regard to a burnt-offering that is not</b> part of the requirements <b>of the Festival,</b> such as a vow-offering or a gift-offering, <b>that it may not be sacrificed on a Festival, or with regard to peace-offerings that are</b> part <b>of the Festival</b> obligations, such as Festival peace-offerings or peace-offerings of rejoicing, <b>that they may be sacrificed on a Festival,</b> as the Festival is their designated time, and if one fails to bring them then he will be unable to sacrifice them later.",

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Resolve</b> the contradiction by emending the text, <b>and say as follows: Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree with regard to burnt-offerings and peace-offerings that are not</b> part of the requirements <b>of the Festival,</b> such as vow-offerings and gift-offerings, <b>that they are</b> certainly <b>not sacrificed on a Festival, or with regard to peace-offerings that are</b> part <b>of the Festival</b> obligations, such as Festival peace-offerings or peace-offerings of rejoicing, <b>that they may be sacrificed on a Festival.

            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Shimon says: But it says: “On the festival of <i>Matzot</i>, on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, and on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:16), to teach: <b>Any</b> offering <b>that comes on the festival of <i>Matzot</i> may come on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> and on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>, and any</b> offering <b>that does not come on the festival of <i>Matzot</i> may not come on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> or on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>.

            "The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i> cited above. <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that <b>one may not bring a thanks-offering on the festival of <i>Matzot</i> due to the leavened bread</b> included <b>with it.</b> The Gemara expresses surprise: It is <b>obvious</b> that one may not bring this offering on Passover, as it contains leavened bread. <b>Rav Adda, son of Rav Yitzḥak, said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Shmuel bar Abba</b> who said: <b>Here,</b> this <i>baraita</i> is not discussing Passover itself; rather, <b>we are dealing with</b> a thanks-offering sacrificed on <b>the fourteenth</b> of Nisan, i.e., on Passover eve, <b>and</b> this <i>tanna</i> <b>holds</b> that <b>one may not bring consecrated</b> offerings <b>to a situation</b> where the time that they may be eaten is restricted, thereby increasing <b>the</b> likelihood of <b>disqualification.</b> Although it is permitted to eat leavened bread until the sixth hour of the fourteenth of Nisan, one may not bring a thanks-offering on Passover eve. The reason is that a thanks-offering may usually be eaten for one full day and the following night, and if it is brought on the eve of Passover, the time available before disqualification is reduced.",
            "It was further taught in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Nor</b> may one bring a thanks-offering <b>on <i>Shavuot</i> because it is a Festival.</b> The Gemara explains: This <i>tanna</i> <b>holds</b> that <b>vow</b>-offerings <b>and gift-offerings may not be sacrificed on a Festival.</b>",

The same should apply to <i>Sukkot</i>. <b>Rather,</b> it means that one may bring it <b>on the intermediate days of the Festival.</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> further taught that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: But it says: “On the festival of <i>Matzot</i>, on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, and on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>,”</b> to teach: <b>Any</b> offering <b>that comes on the festival of <i>Matzot</i> may come on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> and on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>, and any</b> offering <b>that does not come on the festival of <i>Matzot</i> may not come on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> or on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>.</b> This seems to indicate that thanks-offerings may not be brought on any Festival. <b>Rabbi Zeira strongly objects to this: Now,</b> if <b>we may chop</b> kindling wood on the intermediate days of the Festival for the sake of the Festival, <b>is it necessary</b> to state that it is permitted to sacrifice <b>vow</b>-offerings <b>and gift-offerings</b> on the intermediate Festival days? How can it be suggested that Rabbi Shimon prohibits bringing thanks-offerings on the intermediate days of the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>?",
            "<b>Abaye said: With regard to sacrificing</b> these offerings on the intermediate days of a Festival, <b>everyone agrees that it is permitted.

            "<b>The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>the Merciful One states three Festivals</b> in the Torah, <b>even not in their</b> proper <b>order,</b> meaning not in accordance with the yearly cycle found in the Torah: Passover, <i>Shavuot</i>, <i>Sukkot</i>. As soon as three Festivals have passed from the day a person took his vow, if he has yet to bring his offering, he has transgressed the prohibition against delaying. Therefore, the first <i>tanna</i> advises a person who vowed to bring a thanks-offering to do so on <i>Sukkot</i>, even if it is the first Festival after his vow, and even though it is not the first Festival listed by the Torah. If he fails to do so, he will have to make a special trip to Jerusalem in order to sacrifice the offering, as he will not be able to sacrifice it on Passover due to the leavened bread it contains, or on <i>Shavuot</i> because it does not have intermediate Festival days.",
            "<b>But Rabbi Shimon holds</b> that if three Festivals have passed <b>in their</b> proper <b>order, yes,</b> he has violated the prohibition against delaying; but if they have passed <b>not in their</b> proper <b>order,</b> he has <b>not</b> violated the prohibition.

            "The <i>baraita</i> further taught that <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: A person may bring his thanks-offering on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>When?

            "The Gemara asks: If so, <b>what is different</b> about <b>the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> that he cited it</b> specifically as an example of a Festival? The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning,</b> and this ruling too is related to the prohibition against delaying. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The verse did <b>not</b> have to <b>say “the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>,” of which the</b> immediately preceding <b>verse was speaking;</b> it was only necessary to add the other Festivals. <b>Why,</b> then, <b>is</b> “the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>” <b>stated?</b> It is <b>to say that this</b> Festival, i.e., <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>must be the last one</b> with regard to the prohibition against delaying; one transgresses the prohibition only if the three Festivals have passed in their proper order, so that <i>Sukkot</i> is the last of the three.",
            "However, <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says:</b> It comes <b>to say that this</b> Festival is what <b>causes</b> a person to be late in fulfilling his vow. In his view, the prohibition against delaying does not depend on the number of Festivals. Rather, it means that by the time of <i>Sukkot</i>, the last Festival according to the yearly cycle found in the Torah, one must have brought all of his vow-offerings of that year. Even one who vowed to bring an offering just before <i>Sukkot</i> must bring his offering before the Festival ends.",
            "It is taught in the <i>baraita</i>: A person may bring his thanks-offering on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>and fulfill with it his obligation</b> to bring peace-offerings of <b>rejoicing, but he does not fulfill</b> with it the obligation to bring <b>a Festival</b> peace-<b>offering.</b> The Gemara expresses surprise: It is <b>obvious</b> that one does not fulfill his obligation to bring a Festival peace-offering with his thanks-offering. The Festival peace-offering <b>is an obligatory matter,</b> as everyone is obligated to bring this offering, and the principle is that <b>anything that is an obligatory matter must come only from that which is non-sacred,</b> meaning that one cannot bring an obligatory offering from an animal that has already been consecrated for another purpose. It follows that one cannot discharge his obligation to bring a Festival peace-offering with a thanks-offering, as he is already obligated to bring the latter and has consecrated the animal for this purpose.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> in order to teach <b>that even if one specified</b> at the time of his vow that he is consecrating the animal as a thanks-offering on condition that it may be used as a Festival peace-offering as well, he nevertheless does not fulfill his obligation with it.",
            "This teaching is <b>similar to</b> the question <b>that Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish asked of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> With regard to <b>one who</b> vows and <b>says:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a thanks-offering, and I will</b> also <b>fulfill</b> my obligation to bring <b>a Festival</b> peace-<b>offering with it;</b> or if he says: <b>I am a nazirite,</b>"

            "In relation to the previous case, in which one makes a conditional statement and only part of his statement is accepted, the Gemara relates a somewhat similar incident: <b>A certain man said to</b> those tending to him, in the form of a will: <b>Give four hundred <i>zuz</i> to so-and-so, and let him marry my daughter. Rav Pappa said:</b> The <b>four hundred</b> <i>zuz</i> <b>he takes, but</b> as for the benefactor’s <b>daughter, if he wishes, he may marry</b> her, and <b>if he wishes, he</b> need <b>not marry</b> her.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>The reason</b> is solely <b>that he said</b> it in this manner: <b>Give him</b> the money <b>and let him marry</b> my daughter, mentioning the gift before the condition. <b>However, if</b> he specified the condition first, by <b>saying: Let him marry</b> my daughter <b>and give him</b> the money, in that case, <b>if he marries</b> her, <b>he takes</b> the money, but <b>if he does not marry</b> her, <b>he may not take</b> it.",
            "The Gemara relates: <b>Mareimar sat and stated this <i>halakha</i></b> with regard to one who attaches a condition to his vow to bring a thanks-offering <b>in his own name,</b> without attributing it to the Sage who stated it. <b>Ravina said to Mareimar: You teach this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>in this manner,</b> without attribution, whereas <b>we teach it</b> in the form of a question that <b>Reish Lakish asked of Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b>",

            "Rabbi Yitzḥak <b>said to</b> the <i>tanna</i>: He <b>who told you</b> that this <i>halakha</i> requires an explicit biblical source, in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion did he say this? <b>It is</b> that of <b>Beit Shammai, who do not learn</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>obligatory peace-offerings from</b> that of <b>gift peace-offerings</b> by way of an analogy [<i>binyan av</i>], as they distinguish between the two with regard to the requirement of placing hands on the peace-offerings brought on a Festival. <b>As, if</b> it were the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel, since they learn</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>obligatory peace-offerings from</b> that of <b>gift peace-offerings,</b> there being no distinction between the two categories, then <b>an obligatory burnt-offering should also not require a</b> special <b>verse</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i>, <b>as</b> they can <b>learn</b> it <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>a gift burnt-offering</b> by means of an analogy.",

Perhaps</b> they do not learn the <i>halakhot</i> of obligatory peace-offerings from those of gift peace-offerings. Rather, <b>they learn</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing obligatory peace-offerings <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>an obligatory burnt-offering:</b> Just as an obligatory burnt-offering requires the one bringing the offering to place his hands on the animal to be sacrificed, so too do obligatory peace-offerings. <b>And an obligatory burnt-offering itself requires</b> an explicit <b>verse</b> from which to derive this <i>halakha</i>, and perhaps the verse cited above is the source: “And he brought the burnt-offering and sacrificed it according to regulation.”",
            "The Gemara challenges this argument: <b>What is different</b> about obligatory peace-offerings such <b>that</b> Beit Hillel <b>do not learn</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing them <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> applying to <b>gift peace-offerings?</b> It is <b>that</b> gift peace-offerings are more <b>common,</b> and perhaps a different <i>halakha</i> applies to them. If so, <b>they should also not learn</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing obligatory peace-offerings <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> applying to <b>an obligatory burnt-offering, as</b> the latter is <b>entirely burnt,</b> unlike peace-offerings.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing obligatory peace-offerings <b>is derived from between</b> the two of <b>them.</b> The Torah explicitly states that one must place hands on the heads of both obligatory burnt-offerings and gift peace-offerings. It is possible to extend the same obligation to obligatory peace-offerings by combining the two sources, as follows: If one says that an obligatory burnt-offering is different from an obligatory peace-offering because it is entirely burnt, gift peace-offerings prove that this is not the critical factor; and if one counters that gift peace-offerings are different from obligatory peace-offerings because they are common, an obligatory burnt-offering proves that this is not crucial. Therefore, there is no proof from here with regard to Beit Hillel’s position, as they too might learn the <i>halakha</i> governing an obligatory burnt-offering from the verse: “And he brought the burnt-offering and sacrificed it according to regulation.”",
            "The Gemara raises a question with regard to the <i>halakha</i> itself: <b>And do Beit Shammai hold</b> that <b>obligatory peace-offerings do not require placing of hands</b> on the head of the animal? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei said: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree with regard to the placing of hands itself that it is required</b> in the case of obligatory peace-offerings. <b>With regard to what,</b> then, <b>did they disagree?</b> They disagreed with regard to the <i>halakha</i> that states that <b>immediately</b> following <b>placing hands</b> on the head of an offering is its <b>slaughter. As Beit Shammai say:</b> It is <b>not necessary</b> to be particular in this regard, and the ceremony of placing hands on the animal’s head may be performed even on the eve of the Festival, long before the animal is slaughtered. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> It is <b>necessary,</b> and therefore one who brings an offering on a Festival must place his hands on the animal’s head on the Festival itself.",

            "<b>Beit Hillel said to them: If vow</b>-offerings <b>and gift-offerings</b> may not be slaughtered on a Festival, that is <b>because they do not have a fixed time</b> and there is no obligation to sacrifice them on a Festival in particular, but can <b>you say</b> the same <b>with regard to a burnt-offering of appearance, which has a fixed time,</b> the Festival itself? <b>Beit Shammai said to them: It too has no fixed time, as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>One who did not bring</b> his <b>Festival offering on the first Festival</b> day <b>of <i>Sukkot</i> may bring</b> it <b>throughout the entire Festival, including the last Festival</b> day <b>of <i>Sukkot</i>,</b> on the Eighth Day of Assembly, as that day is regarded as part of <i>Sukkot</i> for this purpose. This shows that a burnt-offering of appearance need not be brought at a fixed time on the Festival either.",
            "<b>Beit Hillel said to them:</b> Although a burnt-offering of appearance need not be sacrificed on a particular day of the Festival, nevertheless <b>it too has a fixed time,</b> albeit a lengthier one. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>If the</b> entire <b>Festival passed and he did not bring his Festival-offering, he is not accountable for it.</b> That is to say, he is not required to bring another offering, as the mitzva has already passed. This indicates that the offering is limited specifically to the Festival days, unlike vow-offerings and gift-offerings, which may be brought at any time.",
            "<b>Beit Shammai said to</b> Beit Hillel in support of their own position: <b>But wasn’t it already stated</b> in the verse: “Only that which every soul must eat, that alone may be done <b>for you”</b> (Exodus 12:16), which indicates that for you may food be prepared, <b>but not for the Most High? Beit Hillel said to them: But wasn’t it already stated</b> in the verse: “You shall observe it as a Festival <b>to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 23:41), which teaches: <b>Anything</b> sacrificed <b>to the Lord</b> may be sacrificed? <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “for you”?</b> It means <b>for you, but not for gentiles; for you, but not for dogs.</b>",

            "<b>Rava said: Actually,</b> one can say that the mishna is referring to a case <b>where one prepared</b> an <i>eiruv tavshilin</i>, and nevertheless, if he did not insulate hot food on the eve of the Festival for Shabbat he may not do so on the Festival itself, because <b>insulating</b> hot food <b>is different, as it is evident that he is acting with Shabbat in mind</b> and not for the Festival. Beit Shammai view this as a desecration of the sanctity of the Festival.",
            "<b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> Rava’s opinion from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Ḥananya says</b> that <b>Beit Shammai say: One may not bake</b> on a Festival for Shabbat that occurs on the following day <b>unless he established a joining</b> of cooked foods <b>with bread, and he may not cook</b> for Shabbat <b>unless he established a joining</b> of cooked foods <b>with a cooked dish, and he may not insulate</b> hot food for Shabbat <b>unless he</b> already <b>had hot food insulated from the eve of the Festival.

            "<b>Rather, Abaye said</b> that the mishna is referring to a case <b>where he established a joining</b> of cooked foods <b>for this,</b> meaning he baked and cooked before the Festival for the sake of an <i>eiruv</i>, <b>but he did not establish a joining</b> of cooked foods <b>for this,</b> i.e., he did not insulate hot food for Shabbat on the Festival eve. <b>And</b> the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Ḥananya, according to Beit Shammai,</b> with Rabban Gamliel’s household being stringent upon themselves in this regard.",
            "§ The mishna states that one of the three stringencies that Rabban Gamliel practiced in accordance with Beit Shammai was that on a Festival <b>one may not set up a candelabrum</b> that fell. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> prohibited act <b>does one perform</b> when he sets a candelabrum upright? <b>Rav Ḥinnana bar Bisna said: Here, we are dealing with a candelabrum</b> composed <b>of segments</b> that come apart; it is prohibited to reassemble such a candelabrum <b>because it looks like building.

            "The Gemara relates that <b>Ulla</b> once <b>happened to</b> come to <b>the house of Rav Yehuda</b> on a Festival. Ulla’s <b>servant stood and tilted the</b> oil <b>lamp [<i>sheragga</i>],</b> diverting most of the oil to one side, with the intention of preventing the oil from reaching the wick so that the light would be extinguished more quickly. <b>Rav Yehuda raised an objection to Ulla</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>, in which it is taught: <b>One who adds oil to a lamp</b> on Shabbat <b>is liable for</b> performing the prohibited labor of <b>kindling</b> on Shabbat, <b>and one who supplies himself</b> with oil <b>from</b> a lit lamp on Shabbat <b>is liable for</b> performing the prohibited labor of <b>extinguishing,</b> as he causes the light to be extinguished more quickly. This indicates that any action, even an indirect one, that causes a lamp to be extinguished earlier than it would have otherwise is considered extinguishing. Here too, by tilting the lamp, the servant extinguished a light on the Festival, which is prohibited. Ulla <b>said to him:</b> You are indeed correct; the act was performed by my servant <b>without my knowledge.</b>",
            "With regard to the <i>halakha</i> governing extinguishing on a Festival, <b>Rav said: It is permitted to trim the end of a wick</b> that has become charcoal, so that it will burn better; this is not considered extinguishing.",

            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> against Rav Asi’s understanding of the mishna from the following <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>One may not sweep the room of the couches on a Festival</b> lest he fill in holes and level the ground, <b>but</b> in <b>the house of Rabban Gamliel they did sweep,</b> as they did not share this concern. <b>Rabbi Eliezer bar Tzadok said: On many occasions I followed Father,</b> Rabbi Tzadok, <b>into Rabban Gamliel’s house, and</b> I observed that <b>they would not</b> actually <b>sweep the room of the couches on a Festival, but</b> rather they would do the following: <b>They</b> would <b>sweep</b> the room <b>on the eve of the Festival and spread sheets over it</b> so that it would not become dirty, and <b>on the following day, when</b> the <b>guests entered, they removed the sheets, and it turned out that the house was cleaned on its own.</b> The other Sages <b>said to him: If so, it is permitted to do so on Shabbat as well,</b> and there is no dispute in that case.",
            "The <i>Tosefta</i> continues: Similarly, <b>one may not place incense</b> on burning coals <b>on a Festival, but</b> in <b>the house of Rabban Gamliel they did place</b> incense. <b>Rabbi Eliezer bar Tzadok said: On many occasions I followed Father into Rabban Gamliel’s house, and</b> I noticed that <b>they would not</b> actually <b>place incense</b> on burning coals <b>on a Festival, but</b> rather they would <b>bring perforated coal pans [<i>ardaska’ot</i>] made of iron, filled them with</b> fragrant <b>smoke on the eve of the Festival, and plugged their holes on the Festival eve</b> so that their fragrant smell would not escape. <b>On the following day, when</b> the <b>guests entered, they opened the holes,</b> releasing the smell throughout the house, <b>and it turned out that the house was perfumed on its own.</b>",
            "The other Sages <b>said to him: If so, it is permitted to do so on Shabbat as well.</b> This shows that the issue was not the perfuming of clothes but rather the burning of incense for the smell in the house.

            "<b>And if you say</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where he could not ascend to the roof to examine them, and therefore <b>he did not know whether they were fit or unfit,</b> so that his designation was conditional, there is a difficulty. <b>As didn’t Rav Kahana say:</b> If fruit had been <b>set aside</b> for drying, and it <b>dried</b> and became fit for eating before Shabbat, <b>but the owner did not know about it</b> before Shabbat but only on Shabbat, the fruit <b>is permitted,</b> since he removed it from his mind only for as long as it would be unfit for eating.",
            "<b>Rather, is</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>not</b> referring to a case <b>where</b> the fruits <b>were fit, and</b> then <b>became disqualified, and then</b> once again <b>became fit,</b> and therefore they have the status of <i>muktze</i>? <b>And if you say</b> that <b>there is no</b> prohibition of <b><i>muktze</i></b> for half of Shabbat, <b>why do they require</b> prior <b>designation?</b> The Gemara refutes this argument: <b>Rather, what</b> then do you say, that <b>there is</b> in fact a prohibition of <b><i>muktze</i></b> for half of Shabbat? In that case, <b>if he designates them</b> the day before, <b>what of it?</b> How does his designation permit that which is prohibited as <i>muktze</i>?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is <b>necessary</b> for a case <b>where</b> the fruits <b>were fit but not</b> completely <b>fit,</b> meaning <b>that there are people who eat</b> them in that state <b>and there are</b> other <b>people who do not eat</b> them.

            "§ The Gemara returns to the issue of permitting firstborn animals. <b>Rabbi Yehuda Nesia had a firstborn</b> animal that acquired a blemish on a Festival, and he wished to serve it to priests staying at his house. <b>He sent it to</b> be presented <b>before Rabbi Ami</b> for examination, and Rabbi Ami <b>thought</b> that he should <b>not examine it,</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon. <b>Rabbi Zerika said to him, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yirmeya:</b> The principle is that in cases of dispute between <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon,</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who in this case permits examination of the firstborn. Rabbi Yehuda Nesia <b>then sent</b> the firstborn <b>to</b> be presented <b>before Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa,</b> who likewise <b>thought</b> that he should <b>not examine it. Rabbi Yirmeya said to him, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Zerika:</b> The principle is that in cases where <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon</b> disagree, the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Abba said to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>you did not allow the Sages to act in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon? He said to him: And you, what do you have?</b> Do you have a tradition that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon? Rabbi Abba <b>said to him</b> that <b>Rabbi Zeira said as follows:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> in this case <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b>",
            "The Gemara relates that <b>a certain</b> unidentified <b>person</b> in Babylonia <b>said:</b> May it be His will that <b>I merit to go up there</b> to Eretz Yisrael, <b>and</b> that <b>I learn</b> this <b>teaching from the mouth of its Master;</b> I will ask Rabbi Zeira himself for his opinion on this matter. <b>When he went up there</b> to Eretz Yisrael, <b>he found Rabbi Zeira</b> and <b>said to him:</b> Did <b>the Master say</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon?</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: No,</b> that is not what I said; rather, <b>I said: It stands to reason</b> that this is so.

            "Rabbi Zeira explains: Why do I think so? <b>From</b> the fact <b>that it teaches in the mishna</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Any</b> firstborn animal <b>whose blemish is not perceptible while it is still day is not</b> considered to be <b>among</b> the animals <b>prepared</b> prior to the Festival for use on the Festival. <b>And</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>taught</b> the same ruling <b>in the name of the Sages,</b> indicating that this is the majority opinion. One should therefore <b>learn from this that it stands to reason</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is ruled <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of Rabbi Shimon.",
            "The Gemara asks: In the final analysis, <b>what</b> conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> this matter? Whose opinion does the <i>halakha</i> follow? <b>Rav Yosef said: Come</b> and <b>hear, as</b> this matter <b>hangs on great trees,</b> meaning it is the subject of a dispute among the early Sages. <b>As Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul said</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said in the name of the holy community in Jerusalem: Rabbi Shimon</b> ben Menasya <b>and his colleagues said</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b>",
            "The Gemara wonders at the wording of this report: How could the holy community in Jerusalem have reported that Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya and his colleagues <b>said</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir? <b>Aren’t they much older than he?</b> Why, then, would they have reported a <i>halakha</i> in his name? The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> the holy community in Jerusalem said the following: Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya and his colleagues, who said that one may not examine blemishes on a Festival, <b>spoke in</b> accordance with <b>the opinion of Rabbi Meir.</b>",
            "To which teaching of Rabbi Meir is the Gemara referring? It is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bekhorot</i> 28a): If <b>one slaughtered a firstborn</b> before it was shown to a Sage and deemed permitted, <b>and afterward he showed its blemish</b> to a Sage, who confirmed that it was indeed a permanent blemish that permitted the animal to be slaughtered, <b>Rabbi Yehuda permits</b> it, as it had been established that the animal was blemished. <b>And Rabbi Meir says: Since it was slaughtered without</b> the permission <b>of an expert, it is prohibited. Apparently Rabbi Meir holds</b> that <b>the examination of a firstborn is not</b> as simple a process <b>as the examination of a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> since it involves more than a mere examination of the body of the animal. <b>The examination of a firstborn</b> must be conducted <b>when</b> the animal is <b>alive,</b> whereas <b>the examination of a <i>tereifa</i></b> may be performed even <b>after slaughtering.</b>",
            "<b>And from this</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya and his colleagues inferred that <b>the examination of a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> which consists merely of clarifying the facts of the animal’s physical state, may be done <b>even on a Festival.</b> On the other hand, <b>the</b> more stringent <b>examination of a firstborn,</b> which can be likened to the rendering of a judgment, a process with principles of its own, must be performed <b>on the eve of the Festival.</b>",
            "<b>Abaye said</b> to Rav Yosef: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>there,</b> in that mishna, Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Meir <b>disagree</b> about whether or not one may <b>examine blemishes</b> on a Festival? That was not their dispute; rather, <b>they disagree with regard to</b> the question of whether or not there is a <b>penalty</b> for one who acted improperly. <b>As Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> If the blemish was <b>in the eyelids,</b> e.g., if a fissure developed there that disqualifies the animal, <b>everyone,</b> including Rabbi Meir, <b>agrees</b> that the animal <b>is prohibited, because</b> such a blemish <b>changes</b> its appearance after the slaughter. It is possible that after slaughter what was a temporary blemish will then look like a permanent one, and the animal will incorrectly be permitted retroactively.",
            "<b>When they disagree</b> is in a case of <b>blemishes in the body,</b> e.g., if an ear had been cut off or a foreleg broken, which are prominent blemishes whose appearance does not change after death. <b>Rabbi Meir holds that we issue a decree</b> that <b>blemishes in the body</b> are prohibited <b>due to blemishes in the eye, and Rabbi Yehuda holds that we do not issue</b> such a <b>decree.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The wording of <b>the mishna</b> in tractate <i>Bekhorot</i> <b>is also precise</b> according to this explanation, <b>as it teaches</b> that <b>Rabbi Meir says: Since it was slaughtered without</b> the permission of <b>an expert</b> who confirmed that this is a permanent blemish, <b>it is prohibited.

            "§ The Gemara relates that <b>Ami of Vardina</b> was <b>the examiner of firstborns in the household of the <i>Nasi</i>.

The Gemara answers: <b>When Rabbi Ami would examine</b> the blemishes of firstborns, it was <b>on the day before</b> the Festival that <b>he would examine</b> them, to see whether the blemishes were permanent or temporary."
        ],
        [
            "<b>And on the Festival</b> itself <b>he would ask</b> only <b>how the incident occurred,</b> meaning that he would investigate the cause of the blemish, <b>as in that</b> case <b>where a certain man</b> who was a priest <b>brought a firstborn before Rava,</b> close to <b>nightfall on a Festival eve. Rava was sitting and washing</b> the hair on <b>his head. He raised his eyes and saw</b> the firstborn’s <b>blemish.

            "<b>When he came</b> back <b>on the following day,</b> Rava <b>said to him: How did the incident</b> that caused the blemish <b>occur?</b> The owner <b>said to</b> Rava: <b>Barley</b> grains <b>were scattered on one side of a fence of thorns, while</b> the firstborn <b>was</b> standing <b>on the other side. When it wanted to eat, it stuck its head through the fence and a thorn cut its lip.</b> Rava <b>said to</b> the owner: <b>Perhaps you caused</b> the blemish by deliberately placing the barley on the other side of the fence? <b>He said to him: No.</b>",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>And from where do you say that causing</b> a blemish to an offering <b>is prohibited? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written with regard to offerings: <b>“There must not be</b> any <b>blemish in it”</b> (Leviticus 22:21). <b>I have only</b> an explicit prohibition <b>that it may not have a blemish; from where</b> is it derived <b>that one may not cause</b> a blemish <b>to it by means of something else,</b> e.g., <b>that he does not bring dough or a dried fig and place it on its ear so that a dog will come and take it,</b> thereby biting off part of the animal’s ear and leaving it blemished? Therefore <b>the verse states “any blemish.” It says “blemish” and it says “any blemish”;</b> the word “any” comes to teach that one may not cause a blemish.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>an animal that died, one</b> may <b>not move it from its place</b> on a Festival. <b>And</b> such <b>an incident</b> once occurred <b>and they asked Rabbi Tarfon about it.

Such <i>ḥalla</i> is not fit to be eaten by anyone, nor may it be used in any other manner, e.g., as animal feed or as fuel for a fire, on that day. Rabbi Tarfon <b>entered the study hall and inquired</b> about these matters, <b>and</b> the Sages <b>said to him: One</b> may <b>not move them from their place.</b>",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>we learned the unattributed</b> mishna <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.

Rabbi Yehuda says: If it was not an animal carcass</b> already <b>on the eve of Shabbat,</b> but rather it died on Shabbat itself, <b>it is prohibited.</b> Since Rabbi Yehuda distinguishes between an animal that died on Shabbat and one that died before Shabbat, it would appear that Rabbi Shimon holds that one may move an animal carcass and feed it to dogs even if it died on Shabbat. Accordingly, the mishna that prohibits moving an animal that died on a Festival seems to conflict with Rabbi Shimon’s opinion.",
            "The Gemara rejects this argument: The mishna can be understood <b>even</b> if <b>you say</b> that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> as <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> nevertheless <b>concedes in</b> the case of <b>animals that</b> were entirely healthy at twilight but <b>died</b> on the Festival <b>that they are prohibited.</b> Since they were healthy at twilight, the owner had no intention at that point in time of feeding them to dogs, and they are therefore prohibited as <i>muktze</i>.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Ze’iri explained it</b> as follows: The mishna is referring <b>to a sacred animal</b> that died; since it is sacred property, one may not derive benefit from it, and therefore one may not give it to dogs.

The same applies to this skewer; since it might harm someone where it is, it may be moved to a corner.",
            "Apropos Rav Malkiyu, to whom only a few <i>halakhot</i> are attributed, the Gemara mentions that <b>Rav Ḥinnana, son of Rav Ika, said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a skewer</b> that had been used for roasting meat but no longer has an olive-bulk of meat on it, that it may be moved to a corner; and likewise, the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>maidservants,</b> that even if a woman brought one hundred maidservants into the marriage as her dowry, her husband may nevertheless compel her to perform some sort of work so that her boredom not bring her to sin (<i>Ketubot</i> 61b); <b>and</b> finally, the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>follicles,</b> that if a girl has two hair follicles in her pubic region, even if there are no hairs growing from them, she is considered to have reached majority and may perform <i>ḥalitza</i>; these three <i>halakhot</i> were all stated by <b>Rav Malkiyu.</b>",
            "However, the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a forelock,</b> that a Jew who cuts the hair of a gentile must stop before he reaches his forelock at a distance of three fingerbreadths on every side, as the gentiles would grow their forelocks for idolatry, and the Jew must not appear as if he were dressing the forelock for idolatrous purposes; and likewise, the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>burnt ashes,</b> that one may not place them on a wound, as it looks like a tattoo; <b>and</b> finally, the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>cheese</b> made by a gentile, that it is forbidden because gentiles smooth the surface of their cheese with lard; these three <i>halakhot</i> were all stated by a different Sage named <b>Rav Malkiya.</b>",

            "The Gemara replies: The <i>baraita</i> <b>is incomplete and is teaching the following:</b> With regard to wood of a spice tree, <b>one may crush it and smell it</b> and <b>cut it and smell it.

            "The Gemara poses another question with regard to the same issue. <b>We learned elsewhere,</b> at the end of the mishna cited above concerning clearing out sacks for guests and study: <b>But</b> one <b>may not</b> clear out <b>a storeroom. And Shmuel said: What is</b> the meaning of: <b>But not a storeroom?</b> It means: <b>But one may not finish</b> clearing out <b>the entire storeroom</b> while clearing out the sacks, exposing the floor of the storeroom. The reason this is prohibited is <b>lest he come to level out depressions</b> in the dirt floor of the storeroom, which would constitute a biblically prohibited labor. <b>What would be</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>here,</b> with regard to lowering the produce from the roof on a Festival to prevent its ruin in the rain? Is it prohibited also in this case to remove all of it and thereby expose the floor of the roof?",
            "The Gemara specifies the possible arguments: Perhaps <b>it is there, on Shabbat, that it is prohibited, because</b> punishment for Shabbat desecration is <b>severe, but</b> on <b>a Festival, which</b> has a <b>lighter</b> punishment for desecration, <b>it is acceptable. Or perhaps</b> it can be argued to the contrary: <b>There,</b> in the case of the sacks on Shabbat, even though <b>there is suspension of</b> study in <b>the study hall,</b> i.e., the clearing out facilitates a mitzva, <b>you say</b> that they did <b>not</b> permit exposing the floor. <b>Here,</b> in the case of lowering produce on a Festival to prevent its ruin, <b>where there is no suspension of</b> study in <b>the study hall,</b> i.e., clearing out the produce does not facilitate any mitzva, is it <b>not all the more so</b> prohibited?",
            "The Gemara poses a further question. <b>And here we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>One may lower produce through a skylight on a Festival, and Rav Naḥman said: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only with regard to the same roof,</b> i.e., only if the skylight is in the same roof where the produce is located, <b>but</b> to carry the produce <b>from</b> one <b>roof to</b> another <b>roof</b> in order to lower it through a skylight in the second roof is <b>not</b> permitted. This would involve too much exertion to be permitted on the Festival. <b>And</b> this ruling <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not carry from</b> one <b>roof to</b> another <b>roof, even when</b> the two <b>roofs are on the same level</b> and there is no extra effort of lifting or lowering the produce while transporting it between the roofs.",
            "The question arises: <b>There,</b> in the case of moving sacks on Shabbat for guests or for study, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? May the sacks be moved from one roof or house to another for this purpose? Perhaps <b>all the more so</b> they may not be moved on <b>Shabbat,</b> because Shabbat is more <b>severe</b> than a Festival? <b>Or perhaps</b> it can be argued to the contrary: <b>It is here,</b> with regard to a Festival, <b>that</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to transfer from one roof to another, <b>because a Festival</b> is regarded <b>lightly</b> by people <b>and they might</b> consequently <b>come to belittle it; but</b> on <b>Shabbat, which is severe</b> in people’s eyes <b>and</b> so <b>they will not come to belittle it, it is acceptable</b> to transfer even from one house to another.",
            "<b>Or perhaps</b> it may be argued: <b>If here,</b> in the case of clearing produce from the roof, <b>when there is</b> the issue of the <b>loss of</b> the <b>produce, you say</b> he may <b>not</b> transfer from one roof to another, then <b>there,</b> in the case of moving sacks on Shabbat for guests or study, <b>when there is no</b> issue of <b>loss of produce,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> prohibited?",

This choice of examples seems to indicate that one may cover only things that are fit for use on the Festival, as opposed to objects such as bricks, which are <i>muktze</i>. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>With what are we dealing here? With</b> jugs that contain wine and oil <b>that are untithed,</b> which are not fit for Festival use and are therefore <i>muktze</i>. And the same would be true for bricks.",
            "The Gemara goes further: <b>So, too, it is</b> in fact more <b>reasonable</b> that this is the case, <b>as if it enters your mind</b> that the mishna is referring to <b>jugs of wine and jugs of oil</b> containing <b>permitted</b> liquids, <b>didn’t</b> the <i>tanna</i> already <b>teach in the first clause</b> of this part of the mishna that it is permitted to cover <b>produce?</b> What new information would be added by specifying jugs as well?",
            "The Gemara rejects this assertion. It is possible that the mishna is referring specifically to jugs containing permitted liquids. Nevertheless, <b>it was necessary for</b> the <i>tanna</i> to add the example of <b>jugs of wine and jugs of oil,</b> as <b>it could enter your mind to say</b> that the Sages <b>were concerned over a substantial loss,</b> such as of produce, which can be ruined by drops of rain that leak on it.

A beehive and its bees are not fit for Shabbat use, yet it is permitted to handle a mat in order to cover the hive. The Gemara rejects this: <b>There, too,</b> the reference is to an item that is fit for Shabbat use, as it is discussing a hive <b>when there is honey</b> in it, which can be eaten on Shabbat.

The Gemara answers: This <i>halakha</i> <b>is necessary only for those two honeycombs</b> left in the beehive in the winter to sustain the bees. The Gemara questions this: <b>Are those two honeycombs</b> not <b><i>muktze</i>,</b> as they have clearly been left for the sake of the bees, and not to be used by humans? The Gemara replies: <b>With what</b> case <b>are we dealing here?</b> This is a case <b>when</b> the beekeeper <b>had in mind</b> before the Festival that he was going to take them from the bees and eat <b>them</b> himself.",
            "The Gemara raises an objection to this interpretation. <b>But if he did not have in mind</b> to take <b>them</b> for himself, <b>what</b> would be the <i>halakha</i>?

If so, when the <i>baraita</i> goes on to specify that sometimes it is prohibited to cover the hive, <b>rather than teaching: As long as he does not have the intent to trap</b> the bees, introducing a totally new factor into the discussion, <b>let it make a distinction within the case itself</b> by saying: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said,</b> that the beehive may be covered? <b>When he had in mind</b> beforehand to take the honeycombs; <b>but</b> if <b>he did not have in mind</b> to take <b>them, it is prohibited.</b>",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>This is what</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying: Even if he had in mind</b> to take the honeycombs, so that there is no problem of the hive’s being <i>muktze</i>, it is still permitted to cover it <b>provided he does not have intent to trap</b> the bees.",

There is no difference between a Festival and Shabbat except for work involving food. The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> against this from an earlier mishna: <b>One may lower</b> produce from the roof into the house <b>through a skylight</b> to prevent it from being spoiled by the rain <b>on a Festival, but not on Shabbat.</b> This shows that there is another difference between a Festival and Shabbat besides food preparation: Doing a strenuous activity to prevent a loss is permitted on a Festival but prohibited on Shabbat.",
            "<b>Rav Yosef said:</b> This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> mishna here, which does not include the <i>halakha</i> of lowering produce as an example of a difference between Shabbat and a Festival, is in accordance with <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> whereas <b>that</b> previous mishna that does cite it as a difference is in accordance with <b>Rabbi Yehoshua.</b>",
            "Rav Yosef elaborates on his statement: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a cow and her calf, which may not be slaughtered on the same day because of the biblical prohibition: “You shall not kill <b>it and its offspring</b> both in one day” (Leviticus 22:28), <b>fell into a pit</b> on a Festival, and their owner wishes to take them out, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: One may raise the first in order to slaughter it and</b> then <b>slaughter it, and</b> as for <b>the second, he provides it sustenance in its place so that it will not die</b> in the pit. It is prohibited to undertake the strenuous task of raising an animal out of a pit except for the purpose of eating it on the Festival. Therefore, since one cannot slaughter both animals on the Festival, only one can be raised, while the other should be sustained in its place until after the Festival.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> however, <b>says: One may raise the first with the intent of slaughtering it and</b> then change his mind and <b>not slaughter it. Then he may go back and employ artifice</b> by deciding that he prefers to slaughter the second one, <b>and he raises the second.</b> Having raised both animals, <b>if he</b> so <b>desires he may slaughter this</b> one; <b>if he</b> so <b>desires he may slaughter that</b> one. Rav Yosef understands the argument between the two Sages as follows: Rabbi Yehoshua maintains that it is permitted to perform a strenuous activity on a Festival in order to prevent a loss, and therefore he may raise both animals, lest the one left behind die in the pit. Rabbi Eliezer, on the other hand, holds that one may not perform a strenuous activity to prevent a loss, so the second animal must be left in the pit even though it may die there. It may therefore be posited that the mishna that permits lowering produce on a Festival to prevent loss is in accordance with Rabbi Yehoshua’s opinion. Rabbi Eliezer would disagree with this leniency, and the principle that there is no difference between Shabbat and a Festival other than food preparation would remain intact.",
            "<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>From where</b> do you know that this analysis of these Sages’ opinions is correct? <b>Perhaps Rabbi Eliezer stated</b> his opinion that a strenuous activity to prevent monetary loss is prohibited on a Festival <b>only thus far, there</b> in the case of the animals in the pit, <b>where it is possible to sustain</b> the second animal in the pit and keep it from dying. <b>But here,</b> in the case of the produce on the roof, where there is <b>no possibility</b> of preventing the loss <b>through providing sustenance,</b> he would <b>not</b> prohibit lowering the produce to save it from loss.",
            "<b>Alternatively,</b> one can propose an opposite argument: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua stated</b> his opinion that a strenuous activity to prevent loss is permitted <b>only thus far, there</b> in the case of the two animals, <b>because it is possible to employ artifice</b> to raise the second animal, so that an observer might assume that that he was not acting to preserve his property, but wished to eat the first animal and subsequently changed his mind. <b>But here,</b> in the case of the produce on the roof, <b>where it is not possible to employ artifice,</b> as it is clear that he is acting to salvage his produce, Rabbi Yehoshua would <b>not</b> be lenient. Therefore, Rav Yosef’s approach to resolving the contradiction has no support from this <i>baraita</i>.",
            "<b>Rather, Rav Pappa said:</b> This resolution of the contradiction is to be rejected in favor of the following: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> case is in accordance with <b>Beit Shammai,</b> whereas <b>that</b> case follows the approach of <b>Beit Hillel.</b>",
            "<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> On a Festival <b>one may not take out a child</b> who cannot walk, <b>nor a <i>lulav</i>, nor a Torah scroll</b> into the public domain, as none of these are required for the preparation of food, <b>and Beit Hillel permit</b> it. It is certainly prohibited to carry out any item into the public domain on Shabbat, yet Beit Hillel permit it on a Festival. Therefore, it may be posited that just as Beit Hillel allow carrying out items on a Festival but not on Shabbat, so would they permit moving the produce off the roof on a Festival but not on Shabbat. According to Beit Shammai, who forbid carrying items out on a Festival and on Shabbat equally, moving the produce from the roof would also be equally prohibited, and the principle that there is no difference between Shabbat and a Festival other than food preparation would remain intact.",
            "The Gemara at first refutes this explanation: <b>Perhaps that is not so,</b> as it is possible that <b>Beit Shammai stated</b> their opinion <b>only thus far, there</b> with regard to the prohibition against <b>transferring</b> objects from one domain to another, <b>but not</b> with regard to <b>moving</b> objects, such as produce, from place to place in the house. The Gemara rejects this claim: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>moving is not</b> performed <b>for the sake of taking out</b> to the public domain? The decree against moving items unnecessarily, i.e., not for use on Shabbat or a Festival, was enacted due to a concern that one might take objects into the public domain.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the explanation for Rav is that <b>he holds there is</b> retroactive <b>designation,</b> and the reason Rav was stringent in the case of the animal is that <b>an animal is different, as</b> the <b>limits absorb from each other.</b> A live animal cannot be divided into two parts for ownership; each part of its body depends on and is nourished by the other.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> this issue? <b>Rabbi Hoshaya said:</b> In general, <b>there is</b> retroactive <b>designation,</b> and they can therefore each transport their portions of both the barrel and the animal to their respective places. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: There is no</b> retroactive <b>designation,</b> and therefore they may not move their portions of either the barrel or the animal except within the limits shared by both of them.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Hoshaya</b> really <b>hold there is</b> retroactive <b>designation?

Since any of the entrances might be used to remove the corpse, and none are designated for that purpose, all are rendered impure. However, <b>if one of them was</b> subsequently <b>opened,</b> then the space of <b>that</b> particular entrance <b>is impure, while all the others are pure,</b> as it is assumed that that the corpse will be removed by way of the open door. Even if none of the entrances was actually open, if <b>one</b> merely <b>intended to remove</b> the corpse <b>through</b> a particular <b>one of</b> the entrances <b>or through a window that is</b> at least <b>four by four</b> handbreadths in size, this intention of his <b>saves all the</b> other <b>entrances</b> from impurity.",
            "The details of this last <i>halakha</i> are disputed by <i>tanna’im</i>. <b>Beit Shammai say: And this</b> applies only <b>if he had this intention before the dead person died,</b> so that at the time of death it was known which entrance would be used. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> It applies <b>even</b> if he had this intention only <b>after the dead person died.</b>",
            "<b>And it is stated with regard to this</b> mishna: <b>Rabbi Hoshaya said:</b> When Beit Hillel said that the other entrances are pure even if one thought of removing the corpse via a particular entrance only after the person died, they meant only <b>to purify the entrances from that point and onward;</b> from the moment of his intention there is no more impurity in the other entrances. From this the Gemara infers: <b>From here and onward: Yes,</b> the other entrances are saved from impurity, but <b>retroactively: No.</b> Whatever was in the doorways before this intent was formulated has already contracted ritual impurity and this cannot be reversed retroactively by one’s subsequent thoughts. This indicates that the principle of retroactive designation is not accepted by Rabbi Hoshaya.",

It is because he held that <b>there is no</b> retroactive <b>designation.</b> But if so, in the first case <b>as well,</b> where only one rabbi comes, but the location of his lecture was not known before Shabbat, and one placed <i>eiruvin</i> in the <b>east and</b> the <b>west,</b> we should say that neither is effective because the rabbi’s location will not be known until Shabbat, and <b>there is no</b> retroactive <b>designation.</b>",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> in explanation: This first case is referring to a situation in which the <b>rabbi had already arrived</b> before the <i>eiruv</i> was placed, but the one placing the <i>eiruv</i> does not know the rabbi’s location. Therefore, it had already been determined which of the two <i>eiruvin</i> would be effective, although it was not yet known to him when Shabbat began. <b>Apparently,</b> then, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan does not accept</b> the principle of retroactive <b>designation</b> even in matters of rabbinic law, as he states that if the rabbi were to arrive after the <i>eiruv</i> was placed, it would not be effective retroactively.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara rejects this approach and states: <b>Actually, do not reverse</b> the views of Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Hoshaya; it is indeed Rabbi Hoshaya, also known as Rabbi Oshaya, who accepts retroactive designation, and Rabbi Yoḥanan who rejects it. As for Rabbi Oshaya’s statement with regard to the entrances to a house that contains a corpse, the following answer may be offered: <b>And when does Rabbi Oshaya not hold</b> of the principle of retroactive <b>designation?</b> With regard to matters of <b>Torah</b> law, such as the ritual impurity of the dead. <b>But with regard to</b> matters of <b>rabbinic</b> law, such as Shabbat limits and the placement of <i>eiruvin</i>, <b>he does accept</b> this principle.",

But <b>an ox of a shepherd,</b> who raises oxen for himself but occasionally sells them to his neighbors or acquaintances, <b>is as the feet of</b> the people of <b>that city,</b> as his intention when the Festival begins is that he might sell the animal to someone in town, but not to someone from out of town.",
            "§ The mishna states: In the case of <b>one who borrows a vessel from another on the eve of a Festival,</b> it is as the feet of the borrower. The Gemara asks: It is <b>obvious</b> that this is the case, as the place of rest of the vessel has already been established in the possession of the borrower. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where one did not deliver</b> the vessel <b>to him until the Festival</b> itself. <b>Lest you say:</b> Since the lender <b>did not establish it in</b> the borrower’s <b>possession</b> before the Festival began, it should remain as the feet of the lender, the mishna therefore <b>teaches us</b> that it is not so, but it is as the feet of the borrower.",
            "The Gemara comments: Interpreted in this manner, the mishna <b>supports</b> a statement of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One who borrows a vessel from another on the eve of a Festival, even if he did not give it to him until the Festival</b> itself, <b>it is as the feet of the borrower.</b>",
            "§ It is taught in the mishna: If one borrowed <b>on the Festival</b> itself, <b>it is as the feet of the lender.</b> The Gemara again wonders: This is <b>obvious.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> in a case where this borrower <b>is accustomed to borrowing</b> such items <b>from</b> this lender. <b>Lest you say</b> that since it is a regular occurrence for this loan to take place, the lender <b>establishes it in his possession</b> ahead of time, and it should therefore be considered as though the object’s place of rest is established as the feet of the borrower, the mishna therefore <b>teaches us</b> that it is not so, as the lender <b>certainly says</b> to himself: <b>Perhaps he will find someone else</b> this time, <b>and he will go and borrow from him.</b> Consequently, the lender does not transfer possession of the object to the borrower until the latter takes it, and it may be carried only where the lender may go.",
            "§ It is taught in the mishna: <b>And similarly, a woman who borrowed</b> spices <b>from another</b> to put in a dish, or water and salt to put in her dough, these are as the feet of both of them. The Gemara relates: <b>When Rabbi Abba ascended</b> from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael, <b>he said: May it be</b> God’s <b>will that I say a statement</b> of <i>halakha</i> <b>that will be accepted</b> by my listeners in Eretz Yisrael, so that I will not be put to shame. <b>When he ascended,</b> he found <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappi, and Rabbi Zeira, and some say</b> he found <b>Rabbi Abbahu, Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi, and Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa, and</b> they <b>were sitting and saying</b> in a discussion of the mishna: <b>Why</b> is this the <i>halakha</i> with regard to dough? <b>But let</b> the <b>water and salt be</b> considered <b>nullified in the dough,</b> and the status of the dough should follow its flour rather than its minor ingredients, such as water and salt. <b>Rabbi Abba said to them:</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>If</b> one’s single <b><i>kav</i> of wheat became mingled with ten <i>kav</i> of another’s wheat,</b> shall <b>the latter eat</b> all eleven <i>kav</i> <b>and rejoice?</b> One does not allow his property to become nullified into someone else’s property. The same applies to water and salt in dough. The Sages <b>laughed at him. He said to them:</b> Did <b>I take your cloaks</b> from you that you are putting me to shame? <b>They again laughed at him.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Oshaya said: They did well to laugh at him.</b> They were correct that the two cases are dissimilar, as they reasoned as follows: <b>What is different</b> about a case of <b>wheat</b> belonging to one person that became mingled <b>with barley</b> of another, that Rabbi Abba <b>did not say</b> this case <b>to them</b> as an example? He specifically chose an example of wheat mingling with other wheat and not that case of barley <b>because that is</b> one <b>type</b> mingled <b>with</b> something <b>that is not its</b> same <b>type.</b> The principle is: <b>A type</b> of food mixed <b>with</b> a large amount of food <b>not</b> of its own <b>type becomes nullified,</b> and this principle applies even when the two foods belong to two different people. If so, the same may be said when <b>wheat</b> of one individual is mixed <b>with wheat</b> of another <b>as well. Although, according to Rabbi Yehuda,</b> an item mingled with another item of the same type <b>is not nullified, according to the Rabbis</b> it <b>is certainly nullified.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Safra said</b> to Rabbi Oshaya: <b>Moses!</b> This is a term of reverence for the leader of the generation. Have you in fact <b>spoken well</b> in defending those who scoffed at Rabbi Abba? <b>But, did</b> those Sages who scoffed <b>not hear</b> of <b>this</b> teaching <b>that Rabbi Ḥiyya of Ketosfa’a said in the name of Rav: One who removes pebbles from another’s</b> wheat <b>granary is obligated</b> to reimburse him for the loss he has caused and <b>pay him the value of wheat</b> according to the weight of those stones. The latter could have sold those pebbles along with his wheat, as there is always some refuse mixed in with the wheat that is weighed and sold along with it. Therefore, the removal of the pebbles has caused the owner of the granary a monetary loss.",
            "<b>Apparently,</b> he must compensate him because <b>he has reduced his measure</b> of wheat. Despite the fact that the pebbles themselves are worthless, we do not say that the pebbles were nullified in the wheat and that consequently there is no loss involved in their removal. <b>Here, too,</b> in the case of one who borrows water and salt, which are not worthless, all the more so may we say that <b>one has reduced his measure,</b> and he must compensate the lender; it cannot be said that they are nullified in the dough and that they are no longer taken into account regarding the Shabbat limit.",
            "<b>Abaye</b> objected to the comparison to the case with the pebbles in the wheat, and <b>said to</b> Rav Safra: <b>And</b> does <b>the master not differentiate between money that has claimants,</b> such as in the case of the pebbles removed from the granary in which the owner seeks compensation and therefore there is no nullification, <b>and money that does not have claimants,</b> as in the case of water and salt, where the owner lent them to the borrower and does not demand them back for now? In the latter case it is possible for these ingredients to be considered nullified.",
            "Rav Safra <b>said to him: And according to your reasoning,</b> that one must distinguish between money that has claimants and money that does not, how would you account for <b>this</b> teaching: <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> According to Rabbi Yehuda, who maintains that an item can be nullified only when mixed with an item of a different type but not of the same type, flesh of an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass can be nullified in</b> a larger quantity of meat of <b>a slaughtered</b> animal. Although carcass meat generally imparts impurity, if someone touches the mixture of the two meats he does not become ritually impure, as the carcass meat is considered a different type from the slaughtered animal, and is therefore nullified. This is <b>because</b> meat from <b>a slaughtered</b> animal <b>cannot attain the status of carcass,</b> and it is therefore viewed as a different type.",
            "The Gemara continues to cite Rav Ḥisda’s statement: However, if meat of a slaughtered animal became mingled with a larger quantity of pieces of animal carcass, the meat of the <b>slaughtered</b> animal <b>is not nullified by the carcass, as it is possible for a carcass to attain the status of a slaughtered</b> animal. This means that it can lose its ability to transmit ritual impurity, as if a carcass becomes spoiled to the extent that it is no longer edible, it loses its impure status. The fact that the carcass meat has the potential ability to attain the status of slaughtered meat renders the two meats as the same type, and according to Rabbi Yehuda the smaller amount of slaughtered meat would not be nullified in the larger amount of carcass meat. The entirety of the mixture would not be considered carcass meat, but would retain its status of intermingled carcass and slaughtered meat.",
            "<b>Here, too,</b> will you say <b>that if</b> the carcass <b>has owners</b> other than the owner of the slaughtered meat, <b>it is not nullified</b> in the slaughtered meat? <b>And if you say:</b> Yes, <b>it is indeed so, but isn’t it taught: Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri said: Ownerless objects acquire residence</b> for Shabbat in their location, and anyone who finds them on Shabbat may move them two thousand cubits in all directions but not beyond that, as <b>although they have no owner, it is as though they have an owner?</b> This shows that even property that has no claimants, like the salt and water in this mishna, has its own independent Shabbat limits, which do not become nullified when mixed with items that have a different Shabbat limit.",
            "Abaye <b>said to</b> Rav Safra: <b>Are you comparing</b> a <i>halakha</i> involving <b>prohibitions,</b> i.e., ritual law, <b>to monetary</b> law? An object subject to <b>a prohibition,</b> such as a prohibited food, <b>can be nullified,</b> whereas one’s <b>money cannot be nullified.</b>",
            "Therefore, the initial question remains: Why isn’t the small amount of salt and water in the dough, which is subject to the ritual restriction of Shabbat limits, nullified in the rest of the dough, in the manner of nullification of all other ritual prohibitions? <b>And what is the reason</b> that the water and salt are not nullified in the dough?",
            "<b>Abaye said:</b> It is <b>a decree</b> that the Sages made, <b>lest</b> a woman <b>make dough in partnership</b> with her neighbors. Indeed, in the case of the mishna, the small amount she received from her neighbor should be nullified in the dough. However, on another occasion, several friends or neighbors might decide to pool ingredients and prepare bread in partnership, in which case the bread is certainly bound by the Shabbat limits of all the parties combined. In order to prevent confusion between making dough in partnership and making it with borrowed ingredients, the Sages made a decree that the dough in both cases be subject to the same limitations.",
            "<b>Rava said</b> a different reason: <b>Spices are made</b> in order <b>to</b> add <b>taste</b> to food, and <b>taste is not nullified,</b> even if the amount of actual substance is minute. Nullification indicates that a small amount of food may be considered insignificant and therefore null and void, but if an ingredient is added with the specific intent that its taste be noticed, there can be no nullification."
        ],
        [
            "<b>And Rav Ashi said</b> a different explanation as to why the spices, water, and salt are not subject to nullification: It is <b>because</b> any one of these ingredients <b>is an object whose prohibition is temporary,</b> as the prohibition against their being taken out of the Shabbat limits lapses once the Festival has passed, <b>and</b> the general principle is that <b>anything whose prohibition is temporary cannot become nullified, even</b> by one part <b>in one thousand.</b>",
            "§ It is taught in a mishna: <b>Rabbi Yehuda exempts</b> one from travel limitations <b>in</b> the case of <b>water.</b> The Gemara asks: Does this mean to imply that <b>water, yes,</b> it is exempted by Rabbi Yehuda, but <b>salt, no,</b> it is not? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Water and salt are</b> both <b>nullified, whether in a dough or in a pot</b> of cooked food. The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult.</b> In <b>this</b> case of the mishna, the reference is to <b>salt of Sodom,</b> which is quite coarse and does not blend in easily with the dough, and, being noticeable in the final product, is not nullified. In <b>that</b> case of the <i>baraita</i>, the reference is <b>to</b> a type of fine salt known as <b><i>isterokanit</i> salt.</b> Consequently, it is not noticeable in the final product and can be nullified.",
            "The mishna states that according to Rabbi Yehuda water mixed into dough, and presumably into a cooked dish as well, is considered nullified. The Gemara challenges this: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Water and salt are nullified in dough but not in a pot, due to its sauce.</b> The pot, unlike bread, ends up with liquid in it, so the borrowed water is still recognizable. The Gemara replies: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> case of the mishna, where Rabbi Yehuda says that the water is nullified in the cooked food, is referring <b>to a thick</b> dish that has no liquid sauce. <b>That</b> case of the <i>baraita</i>, in which Rabbi Yehuda said the water is not nullified, is referring <b>to a thin</b> dish with liquid sauce.",

This is permitted because it is considered that <b>this one fills from his</b> portion, <b>and that one fills from his</b> portion. The water that each of them draws is considered retroactively designated exclusively for him, so that the partner has no share in it at all.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rav Naḥman hold</b> that <b>there is</b> retroactive <b>designation?

The <i>kalbon</i> covered both the cost to the Temple of exchanging half-shekels into larger coins and the depreciation of the donated coin. Although a whole shekel given by two partners does not need to be changed into a larger coin, the Sages imposed the same <i>kalbon</i> fee on the partners as on everyone else. However, these partners <b>are exempt from</b> the <b>animal tithe,</b> in accordance with the standard <i>halakha</i> that people who own animals in partnership are exempt from the animal tithe.",

            "<b>And Rav Anan said:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that the inherited property is no longer considered a single unit after the brothers divided it and then rejoined in a partnership <b>only when they divided kids against lambs or lambs against kids,</b> i.e., if one brother took kids and the other took a corresponding value of lambs. This kind of division is considered a commercial transaction, with one brother purchasing goats and paying for them with lambs and vice versa. Therefore, when they join their animals again as partners, it is considered an entirely new partnership.",

            "<b>But Rav Naḥman said: Even if they divided kids against kids and lambs against lambs,</b> one does <b>not say</b> that <b>this is his portion</b> destined to <b>reach him from the first moment.</b> This is because Rav Naḥman does not accept the principle of retroactive designation. Consequently, the resolution proposed previously for the issue of filling water from the cistern of those who come up from Babylonia is invalid.",
            "The Gemara retracts its previous explanation of the disagreement between Rava and Rav Naḥman: <b>Rather, everyone agrees</b> that a cistern of those who come up from Babylonia, i.e., a public cistern, <b>is an ownerless cistern, but here they disagree over</b> a different issue: <b>One who picks up a found article</b> intending to acquire it <b>on behalf of his friend.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rav Naḥman, <b>holds</b> that if one picks up a found object on behalf of his friend, his friend <b>acquires</b> it through this act as though he had picked it up himself. The water of the ownerless cistern is like a found object. Therefore, if one draws water on behalf of another, the latter acquires it, and consequently the water is as his feet. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav Sheshet, <b>holds</b> that when one picks up a found object for another, the latter <b>does not acquire it.</b> Rather, it belongs to the one who actually picked it up, and consequently the water is as the feet of the one who draws it.",

These portions are as the feet of the host, since they belonged to him on the eve of the Festival. This is true <b>unless he transferred ownership of their portions to them on the eve of the Festival,</b> in which case the gifts may be carried wherever the recipients may walk.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It is stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> disagreed with regard to <b>one who deposits produce with another</b> for safekeeping: In whose possession is the produce with regard to determining its place of rest over the Festival? <b>Rav said:</b> They are <b>as the feet of the one with whom they were deposited. And Shmuel said:</b> They are <b>as the feet of the</b> object’s <b>owner.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>Rav and Shmuel follow their</b> usual line of <b>reasoning, as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>If</b> one <b>brought in</b> his produce or his ox to another’s courtyard <b>with</b> his <b>permission, the owner of the courtyard is liable</b> for any damage caused to them. <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said:</b> The homeowner <b>is never liable</b> for damages, <b>unless the homeowner</b> explicitly <b>accepts upon himself</b> the responsibility <b>to watch</b> them.",
            "<b>And Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the statement of the Rabbis,</b> who disagreed with Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, and <b>that Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. If so, <b>let us say</b> that <b>Rav spoke</b> here <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> with the following reasoning: Just as when one gives permission to store something in his yard, that object is under his jurisdiction concerning monetary responsibility, so too, it is in his jurisdiction concerning the establishment of the Shabbat limit. <b>And Shmuel spoke</b> here <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: When a homeowner gives permission to store something in his yard, the object is not in his jurisdiction, whether with regard to monetary responsibility or with regard to the Shabbat limit.",
            "The Gemara rejects the comparison: <b>Rav</b> could have <b>said to you: I said</b> my statement in this case <b>even in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. For <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>stated</b> his <i>halakha</i> <b>only there,</b> that an object brought into a courtyard is not considered in the possession of the homeowner with regard to monetary responsibility, <b>because in</b> the <b>ordinary</b> situation one who allows someone to bring items into his courtyard <b>does not accept upon himself</b> the responsibility of <b>watching</b> them. <b>But here,</b> the homeowner <b>has accepted upon himself</b> the responsibility <b>of watching</b> the produce, and consequently it is as his feet.",
            "<b>And</b> similarly, <b>Shmuel</b> could have <b>said: I said</b> my statement here <b>even in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> as <b>the Rabbis stated</b> their opinion <b>only there,</b> maintaining that the objects are considered in the jurisdiction of the homeowner, <b>because it is a person’s,</b> i.e., the owner’s, <b>preference that his ox</b> or other object <b>be established in the jurisdiction of the owner of the courtyard,</b> so <b>that if</b> his ox <b>does damage</b> to the homeowner’s property the owner <b>will not be liable. But here, is it a person’s preference for his produce to be in another’s jurisdiction</b> with regard to the establishment of its Shabbat limit? It is certainly inconvenient for him to have his produce out of his Shabbat limit. Consequently, the two disputes between Rav and Shmuel are not necessarily connected.",
            "The Gemara asks concerning Rav’s opinion: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>However, if</b> the owner <b>placed an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> the legal status of <b>his produce is like his</b> status. <b>And if you say</b> that deposited produce is <b>as the feet of the one with whom they were deposited,</b> even <b>if</b> the owner of the produce <b>placed an <i>eiruv</i>, what of it?</b> The produce is under the jurisdiction of the people in the other town with whom it was deposited. It should be as their feet, not as the feet of the owner. <b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>the</b> Sages of the <b>school of Rav said</b> in reply to this question: The mishna is dealing with a case <b>where</b> the keeper <b>designated a corner</b> of his house <b>for</b> the owner, thereby revealing his intention that the produce not be considered in his own jurisdiction but rather in that of the owner. Consequently, it remains as the feet of the owner.",
            "The Gemara raises another challenge to Rav’s opinion: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a different proof from the mishna: With regard to <b>one who invited guests to</b> visit <b>him, they may not carry in their hands</b> any <b>portions</b> they may have received back to their town, <b>unless he transferred ownership of their portions to them on the eve of the Festival. And if you say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is that deposited items are <b>as the feet of the one with whom they were deposited,</b> even <b>if he transferred ownership to them by means of another</b> person taking possession on their behalf, <b>what of it?</b> The portions are in any event deposited in the house of the host, and they should be as his feet. The Gemara answers: <b>Here too, since he transferred ownership to them by means of another</b> person, <b>it is considered as</b> a case of <b>one who designated a corner for him,</b> so that the gifts are considered in the jurisdiction of the guests and may be carried wherever they may walk.",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the entire case of <b>transferring ownership is different</b> because the host’s specific intention is to transfer possession of the portions entirely to his guests. This means that the guests have certainly established the place of rest of these portions in their own jurisdiction and that the portions are as their feet.",
            "The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Ḥana bar Ḥanilai</b> once <b>hung meat on the bar of the door</b> of his host’s house, located outside his own town. He subsequently wondered if he was permitted to take the meat home with him, since he had made an <i>eiruv</i> enabling him to walk from his home to his host’s home. <b>He came before Rav Huna</b> to ask his opinion. Rav Huna <b>said to him: If you</b> yourself <b>hung</b> the meat, <b>go take it, but if</b> your hosts <b>hung</b> it <b>for you, you may not take it.</b>",
            "The Gemara questions this: <b>And if he</b> himself <b>hung</b> the meat, <b>may he</b> indeed <b>take</b> it? <b>But wasn’t Rav Huna</b> a student of <b>Rav, and Rav said</b> that when an object is deposited in one’s house it is <b>as the feet of the one with whom it was deposited,</b> which in this case is the host. The Gemara responds: Here <b>it is different,</b> as Rav Ḥana bar Ḥanilai hung the meat on <b>the bar of the</b> host’s <b>door,</b> and this case <b>is considered similar to</b> a case of <b>one who designated a corner for him.</b> Since he was given a particular spot for the meat, it is considered his in all respects.",
            "The Gemara raises a further objection with regard to this incident: <b>Rav Hillel said to Rav Ashi: And if they hung</b> the meat <b>for him, may he</b> indeed <b>not take</b> it? <b>But didn’t Shmuel say: An ox of a fattener,</b> who fattens oxen in order to sell them for meat, <b>is as the feet of all people,</b> i.e., it is as the feet of whoever buys it on the Festival. This shows that meat that is likely to be sold is not as the feet of its owner, but rather it follows the buyer, as the intention before the Festival is that it be for whoever happens to purchase it. Here too, the intention from the outset was that Rav Ḥana would take it over the course of the Festival.",
            "Furthermore, <b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: And if</b> the hosts <b>hung</b> the meat <b>for him, may he</b> indeed <b>not take</b> it? <b>But didn’t Rabba bar bar Ḥana say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Dosa,</b> that in a town that has only one shepherd, an animal that will be given to that shepherd over the course of the Festival is as the feet of the shepherd, since it is certain that the animal will be transferred to him. Here too, since the meat was put aside for Rav Ḥana, he should be permitted to take it with him. There is a further difficulty: <b>Rav Ashi said to Rav Kahana: And if they hung</b> the meat <b>for him, may he</b> indeed <b>not take</b> it? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: The status of <b>animals and vessels is as the feet of</b> their <b>owner?</b> The same should apply to meat that was hung for him; it should be as his feet.",
            "Because of all these questions, the Gemara reinterprets the case of Rav Ḥana. <b>Rather,</b> the problem with the meat concerns a completely different matter, as the issue under consideration is not the establishment of its place of rest but the prohibition against eating meat that has been left unobserved, due to the concern that it might have been exchanged for prohibited meat. <b>Rav Ḥana bar Ḥanilai is different</b> from the average person, <b>as he is a great man and occupied with his studies, and this is what</b> Rav Huna <b>said to him: If you</b> yourself <b>hung</b> it, in which case <b>you</b> noticed some recognizable <b>mark on</b> the meat <b>and your attention was not diverted from it,</b> the meat is not forbidden for having been left unobserved, and therefore you <b>may go</b> and <b>take</b> it. <b>However, if</b> the hosts <b>hung</b> it <b>for you, you</b> thereby <b>diverted your attention</b> from it, and they too did not pay careful attention to it after hanging it on your behalf. In that case, it is considered meat that has been left unobserved, <b>and you may</b> therefore <b>not take</b> it.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> On a Festival <b>one may not water and slaughter desert</b> animals, which graze mainly outside the town, as they are considered <i>muktze</i>. <b>However, one may water and slaughter domestic</b> animals.

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: The mishna is coming to teach which animals are <i>muktze</i> and consequently may not be slaughtered and eaten on the Festival. <b>Why,</b> then, <b>do I</b> need the mishna <b>to say: One may water and slaughter?</b> What does watering have to do with the topic at hand? The Gemara explains: The <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>teaches us</b> a practical <b>matter incidentally: That a person should</b> first <b>water his animal and</b> only <b>afterward slaughter</b> it, <b>due to the adhesion of the skin</b> to the meat when this is not done. If one first waters the animal, it is easier to skin it after slaughtering it.",
            "<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Which are desert</b> animals, <b>and which are domestic ones?

Unripe dates, however, are unfit to be eaten fresh and become fit for eating only when they are ripe. Therefore, if one places unripe dates in a basket to ripen, they are never completely removed from his mind, not having been changed from an edible state to an inedible state, and are permitted. If so, desert animals, which are similarly never completely removed from one’s mind, should also not be considered <i>muktze</i>. Why, then, does Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi indicate that they have the status of <i>muktze</i>?",
            "The Gemara suggests several resolutions: <b>If you wish, say</b> that <b>these</b> desert animals <b>are also considered similar to dried figs and raisins,</b> as by sending them outside the town the owner has actively removed them from use. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the fact that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi told his son that Rabbi Shimon does not accept the <i>halakha</i> of <i>muktze</i> except for the case of dried figs and raisins does not prove anything about his own opinion; <b>he stated</b> this only <b>in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Shimon,</b> but <b>he himself does not hold accordingly.</b>",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> a different answer: He himself, like Rabbi Shimon, did not accept the concept of <i>muktze</i>, and when he spoke in the <i>baraita</i> <b>he was speaking,</b> for the sake of argument, <b>in accordance with the words</b> of <b>the Rabbis</b> who had spoken before him, saying to them, in effect: <b>According to my</b> opinion, <b>there is no</b> <i>halakha</i> of <b><i>muktze</i></b> at all, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, and all animals may be slaughtered on the Festival. <b>But</b> even <b>according to your approach,</b> that there is a <i>halakha</i> of <i>muktze</i>, <b>agree with me, in any event,</b> that with regard to a case <b>where they go out and graze on Passover and enter again at the first rainfall, they are</b> considered <b>domestic animals</b> and should be permitted. <b>But the Rabbis said to him: No,</b> even those <b>are desert animals.</b>"
