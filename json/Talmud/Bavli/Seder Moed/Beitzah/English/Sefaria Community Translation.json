He [Rabbi Yitzhak] would say to you: \"An egg is swallowed [by the chicken], and juice is swallowed [by the fruit, i.e. they are both coming out of something that is separate] – to exclude fruit which is exposed and exists [separately from the tree].\"",
            "And even Rabbi Yohanan thinks it's a [rabbinic] decree because of [fruit] juice that flows, since Rabbi Yohanan contrasted [one opinion of] Rabbi Yehudah against [another opinion of] Rabbi Yehudah, and taught [about this].",
            "It is taught [in a Mishnah]: \"[We] do not squeeze fruit to bring forth juices from them – and if the [juices] leave by themselves, they are forbidden. Rabbi Yehudah says: 'If [the fruit] was for food, what comes out of them is permitted. But if [the fruit] was for juices, what comes out of them is forbidden.'\"",

            "And Rav Yoseif said: \"Even from [the time of] the decree of Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai and forward, the egg is forbidden; what's the reason? It [the original decree] was a matter [decided] in a vote, and any matter that was [decided] in a vote needs another vote to permit it.\"",
            "[As] Rav Yoseif said: \"From where do I say it [this principle of voting]? As it is written, 'Go, say to them: return to your tents' (Deuteronomy 5:30); and it says, 'With the sound of the horn, then you may ascend the mountain' (Exodus 19:13).",
            "And as it is taught [in a Mishnah]: 'Fourth [year produce] of a vineyard: he used to go up to Jerusalem walking from one day [away] from all sides [of the city], and this was its border: Eilat from the south, Akravat from the north, Lod from the west, and the Jordan from the East.'",
            "And Ula (and some say Rabbah bar bar Hanah said that Rabbi Yohanan Said): 'What's the reason? In order to adorn the markets of Jerusalem with fruit.'",
            "And it is taught [in a baraita]: 'Rabbi Eliezer had fourth [year produce] of a vineyard in the east – Lod on the side of Kfar Tevi –"

            "and he asked to leave it for the poor. His students said to him, \"My master, this has already been voted on by your friends and they permitted it!\"' Who are 'your friends'? Raban Yohanan ben Zakkai.",
            "The reason [given] is that they voted – [thus] if they didn't vote, no [it would be forbidden to leave the fourth year produce for the poor]!\"",
            "What [did he mean by] \"and it says\"? [I.e. why provide two verses, why wasn't one sufficient?] This is what he [meant to] say: \"Since it is written 'Be prepared – for three days, do not go near a woman' (Exodus 19:15), why did it [need to say] 'Go, say to them: \"Return to your tents\"' (Deuteronomy 5:30)? Learn from this: Anything which is [prohibited] by a vote [of the Sages] needs another vote to permit it.",
            "And if you want to say that [the verse] comes because of the commandment of marital duty, come learn: 'With the sounding of the horn they can go up the mountain' (Exodus 19:13). Since it is written 'Also the flock and the cattle should not feed before that mountain' (Exodus 34:3), why did it [need to say] 'With the sounding of the horn'?",
            "Learn from this: Anything which is [prohibited] by a vote [of the Sages] needs another vote to permit it.",
            "And if you want to say that these words are regarding Toraitic [commandments] but would not apply to Rabbinic [commandments], come learn: 'Fourth [year produce] of a vineyard' and isn't the fourth [year produce] of a vineyard a Rabbinic [prohibition, where] they said to him: 'Your friends have already voted and permitted it'?",
            "And if you want to say [regarding the] egg [laid on the first day of Rosh Hashanah] Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai also voted upon it and permitted it, when they voted regarding the testimony [of the new moon on 30th Elul] on the egg they did not vote.\"",
            "Abaye said to him: \"But was the egg not [prohibited] in a vote? The egg is a matter that depends on the testimony – he who forbids testimony, forbids the egg; and he who permits testimony, permits the egg!\"",
            "Rav Ada and Rav Shalman both from Bei-Keluhot said: \"Even from [the time of the] decree of Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai and onwards, the egg is forbidden. What's the reason? So that the Temple will be swiftly built. [For] they will say: 'Last year we couldn't eat the egg [laid] on the second [day of] Tom Tov, and now it may be eaten?' And they won't know that last year the [days] were two holinesses and now they are one holiness.\"",
            "If so, then they should also not accept testimony! What's the reason? So that the Temple will be swiftly built. [For] they will say: \"Last year we couldn't receive testimony of the month the entire day and now we can receive?\"",
            "Now is this so?! [No!] There, testimony is a tradition for the Beit Din – the egg is a tradition for everyone.",
            "Rava said: \"Even from [the time of the] decree of Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai and onwards, the egg is forbidden. [For] Surely Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai would agree that if witnesses came from Minhah or later that they would make that day holy and the following day holy?\"",
            "And Rava said: \"The halakhah is according to Rav in these three [cases – Yom Tov and Shabbat, Yom Tov of Babylon and Rosh Hashanah], whether lenient or stringent."
