If you say, because of suspicion - suspicion of whom?

A light for his home and [wine for] sanctification of the day, a light for his home is preferred, because of domestic tranquility;  Rava asked:  The Chanukkah candle and sanctification of the day, what is [the ruling]?

Let us say this [following statement] supports him: \"And similarly on the Eve of Pesach in Jerusalem which falls out on the Sabbath, he leaves his cloak by [the animal seller], takes his Pesach offering, and calculates pricing after the holiday. [This is not a support for Rabbi Yochanan], here what are we dealing with? When others are counted with him [as a group] for his Pesach offering, for before [even setting it aside], it is considered consecrated and set. But [that can't be the case, for] don't we teach: \"One cannot be counted [for a group] for an animal optimally on a holiday\"! It is different in our case [of Pesach], for he is accustomed to doing this, it is as if he was counted already [before the holiday]. But [that shouldn't make a difference,] doesn't Rabbi Hoshiah teach: \"One who goes to a shepherd he always goes to, and he gives him a lamb for his Pesach offering, and he consecrates it, [showing that he still must consecrate it]! There too, since he is used to going to him, it is as if he had consecrated it from the start [before the holiday]. But it states that he [must] consecrate it! [No,] that's consecration of the highest Rabbinical level. Did Rabbi Yochanan really say that [one can consecrate these animals]? But rabbi Yochanan said: \"The halacha is according to the anonymous Mishna\", and it is taught [in a Mishna] \"One cannot consecrate, promise the evaluation of oneself, make vows for donation, and setting aside Teruma and Maaser.\" These were said about holidays, all the more so for the Sabbath! This is not a question, here it is referring to debts where there is a set time for them [such as the Pesach offering], here it is talking about debts that do not have a set time [such as Maaser]. Mishna: One can count his guests and his extra portions [of food] verbally, but not from something written. One can raffle off [portions] with his sons and family members, as long as the intention is not to pit a larger portion against a smaller portion.

            "Gemara: What is the reason [that one cannot count from a written document]? Rav Bibi said: It is a rabbinical decree lest one comes to erase. Abaye said: It is a rabbinical decree lest one comes to read ordinary [business] documents. What is the [halachic] difference between them? There is a [halachic] difference between them, where it is written on the wall high up. According to the one who says \"lest one comes to erase\", we would not be concerned [in this case]. According to the one who says \"lest one comes to read...\", we would be concerned. And according to the one who says \"lest one comes to erase\", let him be concerned for \"lest one come to read...\"! And furthermore,would we not be concerned [in that case] of \"lest one comes to erase\"? But it is taught [in a Mishna], \"One may not read from the light of a lamp, and Rabbah said that even if it is higher than two [human] lengths, even higher than two ox-goads, even higher than ten houses, even in this case, one cannot read,\" [and so we see that the decree applies no matter how high]! Rather, this is the [halachic] difference between them, where it is written on the wall low down. According to the one who says, \"lest one comes to erase\", we are concerned. According to the one who says \"lest one comes to read...\", we are not concerned, a wall and a document will not be confused. And the one who says \"lest one comes to read...\", let him be concerned of \"lest one comes to erase\"! Rather, this is the [halachic] difference between them, where it is engraved on a tablet or a board. According to the one who says \"lest one comes to erase\", we are not concerned. According to the on who says \"lest one comes to read...\", we would be concerned. And the one who says \"lest he comes to erase\", let him be concerned of \"lest he comes to read...\"! If you'll say that [he believes] a tablet or a board would not be confused for a document, but it is taught [in a baraita], \"One can count [guests], how many will be inside and how many will be outside, and how many portions will he place before them, [only] from something written upon a wall, but not something written upon a tablet or board\"! What is the case? If you say it is something written [in ink on the wall/tablet], what is the difference here [with a wall] or here [with a tablet]? Rather, is it not engraved [on the wall/tablet]? But it states, \"something written UPON the wall, but not something written UPON a tablet or board\"! Rather, really it is written on a wall, high up [as first suggested]. And your question because of Rabbah, Rabbah is but [a contender] in a Tannaic argument, as it is taught [in a baraita], \"One can count his guests and his extra portions verbally, but not from something written. Rav Acha permitted [counting] from something written upon a wall.\" What is the case? If you say it is on the wall low down, let [Rav Acha] be concerned of \"lest on come to erase\"! Rather, it is surely on the wall, high up. And learn from it that Rabbah is [a contender] in a Tannaic argument, learn from it. And this Tannaic argument is like another Tannaic argument, as it is taught [in a baraita], \"One may not look into a mirror on the Sabbath [lest one feels the need to cut ones hair, and does it despite the Sabbath]. Rabbi Meir permitted a mirror that is set on a wall.\" Why does it matter if it is set [or not]? Because while [he is trying to find a scissor] he will remember [it is the Sabbath]. If it is not set, he will also remember! [Whether it is set should not make a difference!] Here, we are dealing with a metal mirror, and according to that of Rabbi Nachman, in the name of Rabbah bar Avuha, for Rabbi Nachman said in the name of Rabbah bar Avuha, \"Why did they say that a metal mirror is prohibited? Because a person will cut thin hairs using it['s sharp edges].\" Our rabbis taught [in a baraita], \"Writing that goes under a painting or a bust, it is forbidden to read it on the Sabbath. And the bust itself is forbidden to gaze at even during the week,  as it says, 'Do not turn to idols...' [Leviticus 19:4].\" How is this learned? Rabbi Chanin said, \"Turn not to that which is from your own minds.\" \"One can raffle off [portions] with his sons...\" With his sons and with his household, yes, but with others, no. What is the reason? It is like that of Rav Yehuda in the name of Shmuel, for Rav Yehuda said in the name of Shmuel, \"Members of a group [eating together], and who are very strict on each other [as to how much food they lend to each other], are transgressing [the prohibitions of] measuring, weighing, and counting, browwing and repaying on the festival,"
        ], 
        [
            "and according to Beit Hillel, even [the prohibition of] interest.\" If so, his sons and his household as well [should be forbidden for those reasons]! His sons and his household are within the reasoning of Rav Yehuda in the name of Rav, for Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav, \"One is permitted to lend to his sons and his household with interest, so that they can taste the [bitter] taste of interest.\" If [we allow prohibited actions for educational purposes], pitting a larger portion against a smaller portion [should be permitted] as well [to allow them to taste the bitter taste of gambling]! Yes, indeed [that is correct], and it is missing [words], and this is how it should be taught: One can raffle off [portions] with his sons and his household for the table, even to pit a larger portion against a smaller portion.\" What is the reason? It is like that of Rav Yehuda in the name of Rav [that this is permitted for educational purposes]. With his sons and his household, yes, but with others, no. What it the reason? Like that of Rav Yehuda in the name of Shmuel, \"A larger portion against a smaller portion, it is prohibited [from being raffled off] to others even during the week.\" What is the reason? Because of [the prohibition of] gambling.", 
            "\"Priests can draw lots...\" What does it mean, \"but not for portions\"? Rav Yaakov, son of the daughter of Yaakov, said: [It means] \"but not the portions of the [previous] week's [sacrifices] on the festival.\" That's obvious! [No,] what would you have said? Since it is written, \"For your nation is like the priests who fight,\" [Hosea 4:4] even the portions of the week [should be raffled off] as well [to prevent fights]. It teaches us [that this is not so.] And Rav Yaakov, son of the daughter of Yaakov [also] said: Anyone whose fellow gets punished because of him, is not allowed in to the borders of the Holy One, blessed be He. How do we know this? If you'll say it's because of what's written, \"And God said, 'Who will entice Achav, so he will go up and fall at Ramot-Gilad?' and one said this and one said that, and a spirit went out and stood before God, and he said, 'I will entice him'... And he said, 'I will go out and I will be a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all his prophets.' And He said, 'You will entice, and you will be able. Go out and do it.'\" [I Kings 22:20-22]. And we say [on that], what is this \"spirit\"? The spirit of Navot [whom Achav had killed]. And what is this \"go out\"? Rav said: \"Go out from my borders\" [thus, the spirit was banned from God's borders because he caused Achav's downfall]. But perhaps over there, the reason was because of that which is written, \"He who is deceitful shall not dwell within\" [Psalms 101:7]? Rather, [the source of Rav Yaakov's statement is] from here, \"You have become sated more from disgrace than from honor. You, too, drink and become of the uncircumcised....\" [Habakkuk 2:16]: \"You have become sated more from disgrace than from honor\": That is Nevuchadnezzar. \"You, too, drink and become of the uncircumcised\": That is Tzidkiyah [and since he caused Nevuchadnezzar to be punished, he is considered \"uncircumcised\"]. First of all, the whole verse is referring to Nevuchadnezzar! And furthermore, what should the righteous Tzidkiyah have done for him? For Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav: \"When that wicked man sought to do such [rape] to that righteous man\" [and thus, he was forced to punish him]! Rather, [Rav Yaakov's source is] from here, \"Punishment to the righteous is not good\" [Proverbs 17:26], \"not good\" can only mean \"wicked\", [and this applies to the righteous who punish others], and it is written, \"For You are not a God Who desires wickedness; evil does not abide with You\" [Psalms 5:5]. [Meaning], God, You are righteous, and evil shall not live in Your abode. How does \"Chalashim\" [in the mishnah] connote \"lots\"? As it is written, \"How have you fallen from heaven, morning star? You have been cut down to earth, you who cast lots [cholesh] on nations\" [Isaiah 14:12]. Rabbah bar Rav Huna said: This teaches that [Nevuchadnezzar] would cast lots on the royal staff to figure out which day was theirs for homosexual relations. And it is written, \"All of the kings of nations, all of them... [lay in honor, each man to his house]\" [Isaiah 14:18]. Rabbi Yochanan said, \"That they rested from homosexual relations.\"", 
            "And Rabbi Yochanan said, \"As long as that wicked man lived, not a single creature had joy in its mouth, as it says, \"All the land rested, became tranquil, they opened [their mouth] in song,\" [Isaiah 14:7] implying that until now, there had not been singing.", 
            "And Rav Yitzchak said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan: It is forbidden to stand in the house of that wicked man, as it says, \"...and wild goats shall dance there\" [Isaiah 13:21]. And Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav, \"When that wicked man sought to do such [rape] to that righteous man, he extended his foreskin 300 cubits, and would twist it around in front of the whole party, as it says, \"You have become sated more from disgrace than from honor. You, too, drink and become of the uncircumcised....\" [Habakkuk 2:16], \"uncircumcised\" in numerical value is 300. And Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav, \"When that wicked man went down to hell, all the descenders of hell  trembled. They said, 'Perhaps he has come to rule over them, or to be weak like them,' as it says, \"Have you too become weak like us? Have you come to rule over us?\" [Isaiah 14:10]. A heavenly voice came out and said, \"Whom do you surpass with beauty? Go down with, and you shall be laid with the uncircumcised\" [Ezekiel 32:19]. \"How the oppressor has ceased! [How] the fury has ceased!\" [Isaiah 14:4]. Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav, \"This nation has ceased, which had said"

'It is permitted to think [in learning] in any place except for in the bathhouse and in the bathroom, [showing that thoughts are like speech, by being forbidden in some areas].'\" ... It is different there, for we require \"and your camp shall be holy\" [Deuteronomy 23:15], and there is not [in the case of a bathroom].",

[Which are fed by God’s loving kindness.] He who is born on the eve of the Sabbath will be a seeker. Rabbi Nahman ben Isaac commented: A seeker after good deeds. He who is born on the Sabbath will die on the Sabbath, because the great day of the Sabbath was desecrated on his account.

Rabbi Hanina said to them, [his disciples]: Go out and tell the son of Levi, Not the constellation of the day but that of the hour is the determining influence. He who is born under the constellation of the sun will be a distinguished (bright and handsome) man: he will eat and drink of his own and his secrets will lie uncovered; if a thief, he will have no success. He who is born under Venus will be wealthy and unchaste [immoral]. What is the reason? Because fire was created therein. He who is born under Mercury will be of a retentive memory and wise. What is the reason? Because it [Mercury] is the sun’s scribe. He who is born under the Moon will be a man to suffer evil, building and demolishing, demolishing and building. eating and drinking that which is not his and his secrets will remain hidden: if a thief, he will be successful. He who is born under Saturn will be a man whose plans will be frustrated. Others say: All [nefarious] designs against him will be frustrated. He who is born under Tzedek [Jupiter] will be a right-doing man [tzaddik] Rabbi Nahman ben Isaac observed: ‘He who is born under Mars will be a shedder of blood. Rabbi Ashi observed: Either a surgeon, a thief, a slaughterer, or a ‘mohel’ (a performer of ritual circumcision). Rabbah said: I was born under Mars. Abaye retorted: You too inflict punishment and kill. It was stated. Rabbi Hanina said: The planetary influence gives wisdom, the planetary influence gives wealth, and Israel stands under planetary influence, (yesh mazal leyisrael). Rabbi Johanan maintained: Israel is immune from planetary influence, (eyn mazal leyisrael)."
