            "R' Yehudah son of R' Shmuel said in the name of Rav fires only occur in a place where there is a desecration of Shabbat, as it says \" And if you will not hearken to Me to hallow the Sabbath day and not to carry burdens and to come into the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath, I will kindle a fire in her gates, and it will consume the palaces of Jerusalem, and it will not be quenched.\"  (Jeremiah 17:27) What does 'and it will not be quenched' mean? R' Nachman bar Yitzchak said:  At a time when no people will be there to put it out. Abaye said: Jerusalem was only destroyed because they violated Shabbat within her, as it says \" and they hid their eyes from My Sabbaths, and I was profaned in their midst.\" (Ezekiel 22:26)",
            "R' Abahu said: Jerusalem was only destroyed because they nullify the practice of saying shema in the morning and the evening, as it says \" Woe to those who rise early in the morning; they pursue strong wine...\" (Isaiah 5:11) and it is written \"And there are harp and lute, tambourine and flute, and wine at their drinking feasts; and the work of the Lord they do not regard...\" (Isaiah 5:12) and it is written  \"Therefore, My people shall go into exile because of lack of knowledge...\" (Isaiah 5:13)",
            "R' Hamnunah said: Jerusalem was only destroyed because they caused the children to cease learning, as it says  \"...pour it out upon the babes in the street...\" (Jeremiah 6:11) What was the reason it was poured out? Because of the babes in the street. Ulah said: Jerusalem was only destroyed because they had no shame before one another, as it says \"They shall be put to shame since they have committed abomination. Neither are they ashamed nor do they know to feel disgrace.\" (Jeremiah 6:15) R' Yitzchak said:  Jerusalem was only destroyed because they made the great and the small equivalent, as it says \"And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest...\" (Isaiah 24:2) and it is written after this \"The land shall be emptied...\" (Isaiah 24:3)",
            "R' Amram the son of R' Shimon bar Abba said in the of his father who said in the name of R' Chanina Jerusalem was only destroyed because they did not rebuke one another, as it says  \"...her princes were like harts who did not find pasture...\" (Lamentations 1:6) Just as harts stand with this one's head next to that one's tail, so too Israel in that generation pressed their faced to the floor and did not rebuke one another. R' Yehudah said: Jerusalem was only destroyed because they disparaged talmidei chachamim in her, as it says  \"But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised His words and scoffed His prophets, until the Lord's wrath ascended upon His people beyond remedy.\" (Chronicles II 36:16) What does 'beyond remedy' mean? R' Yehudah said in the name of Rav: Anyone one who disparaged a talmid chacham, his wounds will not heal.",
            "R' Yehudah said in the name of Rav: What is written \"Do not touch My anointed ones, and do not harm My prophets.\" (Chronicles I 16:22)? 'Do not touch my anointed' refers to the children of the house of study, 'and do not harm my prophets' refers to the talmide chachamim. Resh Lakish said in the name of R' Yehudah Nesiyah: The world only persists because of the breath from the mouths of the children of the house of study. R' papa said to Abaye: what about mine and yours? He replied: there is no comparison between breath which has sin and breath which has no sin. And Resh Lakish said in the name of R' Yehudah Nesiyah: We do not interrupt the study of the children even for the building of the Holy Temple. And Resh Lakish said to R' Yehudah Nesiyah: This is what I received from my fathers (and there are those who say it 'from your fathers'): We destroy any city which does not have children studying. Ravena said: we place it in cherem (excommunication).",
            "And Rava said: Jerusalem was only destroyed because men of faith ceased to be found there, as it says “Stroll in the streets of Jerusalem, and see now and know, and seek in its squares, whether you will find a man, whether there is one who performs justice, who seeks faith, and I will forgive her.” (Jeremiah 5:1) Is that so?! Behold, R’ Kitina said:  even in the hour of Jerusalem’s failure, men of faith were still found there, as it says ... “When a man shall seize his brother of the house of his father, [saying], You have a garment, be an officer to us…” you have in your hands the things with which people cover themselves as if with a garment “…and this obstacle shall be under your hands,” (Isaiah 3:6)"
        ],
        [
            "you have in your hands the things which people do not master unless they fail in them– be an officer to us.  “He shall swear (yisah) on that day, saying, \"I will not be a ruler…” (Isaiah 3:7)  The word yisah indicates an oath, as it says  “You shall not take the name of the Lord…” (Exodus 20:6)  ‘I will not be a ruler (literally binder up) (choveish)’ I will not be among those who confine (chovshei) themselves to the house of study. “…while in my house there is neither bread nor clothing…” (Isaiah 3:7) I have neither scripture, Mishna nor Talmud in my hands.  And why should you say so?  Perhaps it is different in that case, that if he says to them that he has learned, they will say –  tell us!  He could say:  I learned and forgot.  Why say I will not be a binder up at all?  This is not a difficulty. Here it is in regard to Torah learning, and there in regard to matters of the world."

            "It was taught in a baraita, R’ Yosi ben Elisha says:  if you see a generation that experiences much suffering – go check the judges of Israel.  This is because any retribution which comes upon the world only comes because of the judges of Israel, as it says  “Hearken now to this, you heads of the house of Jacob and you rulers of the house of Israel, who condemn justice and pervert all that is straight. Each one builds Zion with blood and Jerusalem with injustice. Its heads judge for bribes, and its priests teach for a price; and its prophets divine for money, and they rely on the Lord…” (Micah 3:9-11) They are wicked, but they put their trust in the One who spoke and brought the world into being.",
            "Therefore the Holy One brought three types of punishment upon them parallel to the three sins in their hands,  as it says  “Therefore, because of you, Zion shall be plowed as a field; Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the Temple Mount like the high places of a forest.” (Micah 3:12) ",
            "The Holy One does not bring His Presence to rest upon Israel until evil judges and officers are eliminated from Israel, as it says  “And I will return My hand upon you and purge away your dross as with lye, and remove all your tin. And I will restore your judges as at first and your counsellors as in the beginning; afterwards you shall be called City of Righteousness, Faithful City.” (Isaiah 1:25-26) ",
