            "MISHNAH: One does not sit down before the barber, close to the time of the afternoon prayer, unless he has already said his prayer. Neither shall he enter the bath house or a tannery, or sit down to eat or begin a law suit;  but if they have begun it, they need not interrupt it. ... One interrupts for the reading of the <i>Shema'</i>, but not for the prayer (the <i>'Amida</i>.",

            "  ", 
            "    ", 
            " After all we speak here of the usual haircut. Why may not one sit down at the beginning? Because the shears may be broken.  Thus one may not enter the bathhouse if only for sweating. Why not at the outset? Because one may faint.  Nor a tannery if only to inspect it.  Why not at the outset? Because one may notice that his goods are being spoiled, and that will worry him;  nor sit down to eat, not even a small meal.  Why not in the first place? Because one may prolong the meal.  Nor to a law suit, even if at the end of it. Why not in the first place? Because he may find a new plea for changing the decision", 
            "What constitutes the beginning of haircutting?  Rabbi Abim says:  When the sheet is spread on one's knee.  What constitutes the beginning of a bath?  Rabbi Abim says:  When one takes off his coat.  And what is the beginning of tanning?  When one tied his apron round his shoulders.  When does the meal begin?  Rav says:  When one washed his hands.  Rabbi Hanina says:  When one loosened his girdle. ", 
            "There is no disagreement here.  One speaks of his [the Babylonians' practice] and the other of his [the Palestinians' practice]."
