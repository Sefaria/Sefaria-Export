            "<b>Who</b> has the status of <b>a minor</b> with regard to this <i>halakha</i>? <b>Any</b> child <b>who is unable to ride on his father’s shoulders and ascend from Jerusalem to the Temple Mount;</b> this is <b>the statement of Beit Shammai. And Beit Hillel say: Any</b> child <b>who is unable to hold his father’s hand and ascend</b> on foot <b>from Jerusalem to the Temple Mount, as it is stated: “Three times [<i>regalim</i>]”</b> (Exodus 23:14). Since the term for feet is <i>raglayim</i>, Beit Hillel infer from here that the obligation to ascend involves the use of one’s legs.",
            "<b>Beit Shammai say: The</b> burnt-offering of <b>appearance</b> brought on a pilgrim Festival must be worth at least <b>two silver</b> coins, <b>and the Festival peace</b>-offering must be worth at least one <b>silver <i>ma’a</i></b> coin. <b>And Beit Hillel say: The</b> burnt-offering of <b>appearance</b> must be worth at least one <b>silver <i>ma’a</i> and the Festival peace</b>-offering at least <b>two silver</b> coins.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: When the mishna states that all are obligated in the mitzva of appearance in the Temple, the term: All, comes <b>to add what</b> in the mishna’s ruling? The Gemara answers: It serves <b>to add one who is half-slave half-freeman.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Ravina, who said: One who is half-slave half-freeman is exempt from the appearance</b> in the Temple, the term: <b>All,</b> comes <b>to add what?</b> The Gemara answers: It comes <b>to add</b> one who was <b>lame on</b> the <b>first day</b> of the Festival and was unable to travel, <b>and was healed on</b> the <b>second day</b> of the Festival. This man is obligated to appear before the end of the Festival.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who said</b> that <b>all</b> seven days of the Festival <b>redress one another,</b> i.e., the obligation to appear applies equally on all days of the Festival. Consequently, one who was unable to travel on the first day may do so on the second day. <b>However, according to the one who said</b> that the main obligation is on the first day and <b>all</b> the remaining days merely <b>redress the first</b> day, and therefore one who was exempt from appearing on the first day of the Festival remains exempt throughout the rest of the Festival, the term: <b>All,</b> comes <b>to add what?</b> The Gemara answers: It comes <b>to add</b> one who is <b>blind in one of his eyes.</b>",
            "The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> this is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Yoḥanan ben Dehavai says in the name of Rabbi Yehuda:</b> One who is <b>blind in one of his eyes is exempt from the</b> mitzva of <b>appearance, as it is stated:</b> “Three occasions in the year all your males <b>will appear [<i>yera’e</i>]</b> before the Lord God” (Exodus 23:17). Since there are no vowels in the text, this can be read as: All your males <b>will see [<i>yireh</i>]</b> the Lord God. This teaches that <b>in the</b> same <b>manner that one comes to see, so he comes to be seen: Just as</b> the usual way <b>to see</b> is <b>with both one’s eyes, so too</b> the obligation <b>to be seen</b> applies only to one who comes <b>with</b> the sight of <b>both his eyes.</b> Therefore, one who is blind in one eye is not obligated in the mitzva of appearance in the Temple.",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Actually,</b> it is <b>as we said initially,</b> that it comes to include one who is half-slave and half-freeman. <b>And</b> as for that <b>which</b> poses <b>a difficulty to</b> the opinion <b>of Ravina,</b> it is <b>not difficult: Here</b> it is in accordance with <b>the initial</b> version of the <b>mishna,</b> whereas <b>there,</b> Ravina’s statement, is <b>in accordance with the ultimate</b> version of the <b>mishna. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 88a): <b>One who is half-slave half-freeman serves his master one day</b> and works for <b>himself one day.</b> This is <b>the statement of Beit Hillel.</b>",

            "And if you say <b>he should be idle</b> and not marry, <b>but isn’t it</b> true that <b>the world was created only for procreation, as it is stated: “He did not create it to be a waste; He formed it to be inhabited”</b> (Isaiah 45:18)? <b>Rather, for the betterment of the world we force his master to make him a freeman, and</b> the slave <b>writes a bill to</b> his master accepting his responsibility to pay <b>half his value</b> to him. <b>And Beit Hillel</b> ultimately <b>retracted</b> their opinion, <b>to rule in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai</b> that a half-slave must be set free.",
            "§ The mishna taught: <b>Except for a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor.</b> The Gemara notes: By listing these three cases together the mishna <b>is teaching</b> that <b>a deaf-mute is similar to an imbecile and a minor: Just as an imbecile and a minor</b> are among those <b>who are not of sound mind, so too the deaf-mute [<i>ḥeresh</i>]</b> mentioned here is one <b>who is not of sound mind. And</b> this <b>teaches us as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 1:2): <b>The <i>ḥeresh</i>, whom the Sages discussed everywhere,</b> is one <b>who does not hear and does not speak,</b> and therefore his mind is not lucid. It can be inferred from this that <b>one who speaks but does not hear</b> and <b>one who hears but does not speak are obligated</b> in mitzvot like any other person.",
            "The Gemara notes: <b>We</b> already <b>learned this, as the Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Terumot</i> 1:2): <b>One who speaks but does not hear, this is a deaf</b> person. One who <b>hears but does not speak, this is a mute.</b> Both <b>this</b> one <b>and that</b> one <b>are</b> in the same legal category <b>as those who can see and hear</b> with regard <b>to all matters.</b> This shows that the <i>ḥeresh</i> exempted by the Sages is one who neither hears nor speaks.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that one who speaks but does not hear is a deaf</b> person, and one who <b>hears but does not speak is a mute? As it is written: “But I am as a deaf man, I hear not; and I am as a dumb man [<i>illem</i>] who does not open his mouth”</b> (Psalms 38:14). <b>If you wish, say</b> instead that this is <b>as people say: His speech has been taken [<i>Ishtakeil Milulei</i>];</b> the term <i>illem</i> is an acronym for this phrase.",
            "The <i>Tosefta</i> taught that <b>one who speaks but does not hear</b> and <b>one who hears but does not speak</b> are <b>obligated</b> in mitzvot. The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>one who speaks but does not hear</b> and <b>one who hears but does not speak</b> are <b>exempt?</b>",
            "<b>Ravina said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rava</b> who said: The mishna <b>is incomplete and is teaching the following: All are obligated in</b> the mitzvot of <b>appearance</b> in the Temple <b>and rejoicing</b> during the pilgrim Festival by eating the sacrificial meat, <b>except for a deaf</b> person <b>who speaks but does not hear</b> and a mute person <b>who hears but does not speak,</b> each of whom <b>is exempt from</b> the mitzva of <b>appearance.

            "The Gemara explains: <b>With regard to</b> their exemption from the obligation of <b>appearance,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>derives</b> this <i>halakha</i> by means of a verbal analogy between the term <b>appearance</b> stated with regard to the mitzva of appearance at the Temple on the pilgrim Festival and the term <b>appearance</b> stated with regard to the mitzva <b>of assembly,</b> i.e., the obligation to assemble in the Temple on <i>Sukkot</i> in the year following the Sabbatical Year. <b>As it is written,</b> with regard to the mitzva of assembly: <b>“Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:12), <b>and it is written</b> in that context: <b>“When all of Israel come to appear”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:11). Just as a deaf person and a mute are not obligated to attend the assembly, they are likewise exempt from appearing in the Temple on the Festivals.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And there,</b> with regard to the mitzva of assembly, <b>from where do we</b> derive that a deaf person and a mute are exempt? <b>As it is written</b> there: <b>“That they may hear, and that they may learn”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:12), <b>and it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the phrase <b>“that they may hear” excludes one who speaks but does not hear;</b> and the phrase <b>“and that they may learn” excludes one who hears but does not speak,</b> as he is unable to learn.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that one who</b> is <b>not</b> able to <b>speak</b> is <b>not</b> able to <b>learn? But</b> consider the following incident. There were <b>two mute people who were in the neighborhood of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. They were the <b>sons of the daughter of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Gudgeda, and some say</b> that they were the <b>sons of the sister of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> ben Gudgeda. <b>Whenever Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>would enter the study hall they would</b> also <b>enter and sit before</b> the Sages, <b>and they would nod their heads</b> as if they understood <b>and move their lips.</b>",
            "<b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>prayed for</b> God to have <b>mercy upon them, and they were healed. And it was discovered that they had learned</b> and were proficient in <b><i>halakha</i>,</b> i.e., Mishna; <b><i>Sifra</i>,</b> the halakhic midrash on Leviticus; <b><i>Sifrei</i>,</b> the halakhic midrash on Numbers and Deuteronomy; <b>and the entire Talmud.</b> This shows that those who cannot speak are able to learn.",
            "<b>Mar Zutra said</b> that one should <b>read into</b> the verse: <b>That they may teach [<i>yelamdu</i>],</b> instead of: “That they may learn [<i>yilmedu</i>]” (Deuteronomy 31:12). Even if a mute person is able to learn he cannot teach others. <b>Rav Ashi said</b> that the verse <b>is certainly</b> to be read: <b>That they may teach. As, if it enters your mind</b> that one should read: <b>“That they may learn,”</b> as it is written, <b>and</b> you will explain that <b>since he is not</b> able to <b>speak he</b> is <b>not</b> able to <b>learn,</b> and similarly the reason for the exemption of a deaf person is that <b>since he is not</b> able to <b>hear he is not</b> able to <b>learn,</b> you will have erred. According to this interpretation, it is clear from the context that a deaf person is exempted by the phrase: “That they may hear,” not merely due to his lack of hearing but because his inability to hear prevents him from learning.",
            "However, this is incorrect, for if so, <b>this</b> exemption of a mute could also be <b>derived from: “That they may hear,”</b> as the verse has already taught the basic principle that anyone who cannot learn is not obligated in the mitzva of assembly. <b>Rather,</b> the verse <b>is certainly</b> to be read as: <b>“That they may teach,”</b> which indicates that although a mute is able to learn himself, and therefore he is not exempted by the previous verse, he is nevertheless exempt because he is unable to teach others.",
            "<b>Rabbi Tanḥum said: One who is deaf in one ear is exempt from</b> the mitzva of <b>appearance</b> in the Temple, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the mitzva of assembly: “When all Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God in the place that He shall choose, you shall read this law before all Israel <b>in their ears”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:11). This verse indicates that the obligation of assembly applies only to those who can hear with both ears. Since the two mitzvot are connected by verbal analogy, as explained above, this <i>halakha</i> applies to the mitzva of appearance as well.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But this</b> phrase: <b>“In their ears,” is necessary</b> to teach that the reading of the Torah at the assembly must enter <b>the ears of the entire Jewish people.</b> Consequently, it cannot serve as the source of the <i>halakha</i> concerning one who is deaf in one ear. The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> <i>halakha</i>, that the reading of the Torah must be heard by the entire Jewish people, <b>is derived from</b> the phrase: <b>“Before all Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:11). The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> that <i>halakha</i> were derived <b>from: “Before all Israel,” I would say</b> that the mitzva applies <b>even though they cannot hear;</b> therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes: “In their ears,” and that</b> indicates that <b>they</b> must be able to <b>hear.</b> If so, this phrase is not available for deriving the <i>halakha</i> of someone who is deaf in one ear.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> <i>halakha</i>, that the people must hear, <b>is derived from: “That they may hear”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:12). Therefore, the phrase: “In their ears,” is not required for that purpose. Rather, it teaches that only those who can hear with both ears are obligated in the mitzva of assembly, and by extension, in the mitzva of appearance as well.",
            "<b>Rabbi Tanḥum said: One who is lame in one leg is exempt from</b> the mitzva of <b>appearance, as it is stated:</b> “Three <b>times [<i>regalim</i>]</b> shall you keep a feast for Me in the year” (Exodus 23:14).Since the term for feet is <i>raglayim</i>, it can be inferred from here that the obligation to ascend involves the use of both of one’s legs.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> the term <b>“<i>regalim</i>” is necessary</b> to <b>exclude people with artificial legs.</b> Although these people are capable of walking, as they do not have two natural legs they are exempt from ascending to the Temple. The Gemara responds: <b>That</b> <i>halakha</i> is <b>derived from:</b> “Three <b>occasions [<i>pe’amim</i>]</b> in the year all your males will appear before the Lord God” (Exodus 23:17). The term <i>pe’amim</i> can also mean legs, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, with regard to the term <b>“<i>pe’amim</i>”: <i>Pe’amim</i> means nothing other</b> than <b>legs. And so it says: “The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor and the steps [<i>pa’amei</i>] of the needy”</b> (Isaiah 26:6), <b>and it says: “How beautiful are your feet [<i>fe’amayikh</i>] in sandals, daughter of the prince”</b> (Song of Songs 7:2).",
            "With regard to the aforementioned verse, <b>Rava taught: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “How beautiful are your feet in sandals, daughter of the prince [<i>nadiv</i>]”? How pleasant are the feet [<i>raglehen</i>] of the Jewish people when they ascend to</b> Jerusalem <b>on the pilgrimage Festival [<i>regel</i>]. “Daughter of the prince”:</b> this is referring to <b>the daughter of Abraham our father who is called a prince, as it is stated: “The princes of the peoples are gathered together, the people of the God of Abraham”</b> (Psalms 47:10). The Gemara asks: Is God only <b>“the God of Abraham,” and not the God of Isaac and Jacob? Rather,</b> the verse mentions <b>“the God of Abraham,” as</b> he <b>was the first of the converts.</b> Abraham was the first prince, as all converts who follow in his path are called “the princes of the peoples.”",
            "The Gemara cites another statement of Rabbi Tanḥum. <b>Rav Kahana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Natan bar Manyumi taught in the name of Rabbi Tanḥum: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written</b> with regard to Joseph: “And they took him, and cast him into the pit; <b>and the pit was empty, there was no water in it”</b> (Genesis 37:24). <b>By inference from that which is stated: “And the pit was empty,” don’t I know that there was no water in it?

            "§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> There was <b>an incident involving Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka and Rabbi Elazar ben Ḥisma, when they went to greet Rabbi Yehoshua in Peki’in.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them: What novel</b> idea <b>was</b> taught <b>today in the study hall?

            "He asked them: <b>Whose week was it,</b> i.e. who was the lecturer this week? They said to him: <b>It was Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya’s week.</b> He inquired: <b>And on what</b> subject <b>was the lecture today? They said to him:</b> He spoke <b>about the portion of</b> the mitzva of <b>assembly.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua persisted: <b>And what</b> verse <b>did he interpret homiletically with regard to</b> this mitzva?",
            "They said to him that Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya interpreted the following verse: <b>“Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:12). This verse is puzzling: <b>If men come to learn,</b> and <b>women,</b> who might not understand, <b>come</b> at least <b>to hear, why do the little ones come?</b> They come <b>in order</b> for God to <b>give a reward to those who bring them,</b> i.e., God credits those who bring their children to the assembly. Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them:</b> This <b>good pearl</b> of wisdom <b>was in your hands, and you tried to conceal it from me?</b>",
            "Upon seeing that Rabbi Yehoshua was pleased to hear this idea, Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka and Rabbi Elazar ben Ḥisma said to him: <b>Additionally,</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>interpreted</b> the following verses <b>homiletically: “You have affirmed, this day,</b> that <b>the Lord</b> is your God, and that you will walk in His ways and keep His statutes, His mitzvot, and His ordinances, and listen to His voice. <b>And the Lord has affirmed you, this day,</b> to be His treasure, as He promised you, and that you should keep all His mitzvot” (Deuteronomy 26:17–18).",

To tell you</b> that <b>just as this goad directs the cow to her furrow to bring forth</b> sustenance for <b>life to the world, so too the words of Torah direct those who study them from the paths of death to the paths of life.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> derive the following from that same analogy: <b>Just as this goad is movable</b> and not rigid, <b>so too matters of Torah are movable</b> in accordance with circumstance and are not permanent. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Nails,”</b> which are permanent.",
            "The Gemara further asks: <b>If so,</b> one can explain as follows: <b>Just as this nail is diminished</b> in size <b>and does not expand,</b> as it wastes away over time, <b>so too matters of Torah are</b> gradually <b>diminished and do not expand.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Well fastened [<i>netuim</i>].” Just as this plant [<i>neti’a</i>] flourishes and multiplies, so too matters of Torah flourish and multiply. “Those that are composed in collections [<i>ba’alei asufot</i>]”: These are Torah scholars who sit in many groups [<i>asupot</i>] and engage in Torah</b> study. There are often debates among these groups, as some of <b>these</b> Sages <b>render</b> an object or person <b>ritually impure and these render it pure; these prohibit</b> an action <b>and these permit</b> it; <b>these deem</b> an item <b>invalid and these deem it valid.</b>",
            "<b>Lest a person say: Now, how can I study Torah</b> when it contains so many different opinions? <b>The verse states</b> that <b>they are all “given from one shepherd.” One God gave them; one leader,</b> i.e., Moses, <b>said them from the mouth of the Master of all creation, Blessed be He, as it is written: “And God spoke all these words”</b> (Exodus 20:1). The plural form “words” indicates that God transmitted all the interpretations of the Ten Commandments. Since the Sages invariably utilize the Torah itself or the statements of the prophets as the sources for their opinions, there is a certain unity to the study of Torah, despite the numerous explanations and applications.",

            "This difference is important, <b>because the first consecration</b> of Eretz Yisrael, by those who ascended from Egypt, caused <b>it</b> to be <b>sanctified</b> only <b>for its time and it</b> was <b>not sanctified forever,</b> as that depended on the renewed conquest of the land by the Jewish people. <b>And</b> those who ascended from Babylonia <b>left those</b> cities aside and did not consider them part of Eretz Yisrael even after Jewish settlement was renewed there. They would plow and harvest in these places in the Sabbatical Year and tithe the poor man’s tithe, <b>so that the poor</b> of Eretz Yisrael, who did not have sufficient income from the previous years, <b>could rely upon</b> that produce <b>in the Sabbatical Year,</b> receiving help from this tithe.",

            "<b>But wasn’t</b> it <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili who said: The burnt</b>-offering <b>that the Jewish people sacrificed in the desert</b> at Mount Sinai <b>was the daily burnt</b>-offering?

            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the practical difference</b> between the two readings? <b>Mar Zutra said:</b> The practical difference is with regard <b>to the punctuation of</b> the cantillation <b>notes,</b> whether there should be a break in the verse after: “And they sacrificed burnt-offerings,” indicating that these offerings consisted of sheep; or whether it should read: “And they sacrificed burnt-offerings and sacrificed peace-offerings of bulls,” as one clause.",

            "This explanation is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Levi, as Rabbi Levi raised a contradiction</b> between two verses. <b>It is written: “Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor’s house,” and it is written: “I will come into Your house with burnt</b>-offerings, I will perform for You my vows” (Psalms 66:13).

It is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Ḥizkiya,</b> who said that one may combine only one animal with another animal, <b>and not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who said that one may combine only money with other money.",
            "<b>And if you would say: It is the <i>amora’im</i> who disagree,</b> whereas <b>the <i>baraitot</i></b> that were cited in support of their opinions <b>do not disagree and</b> therefore Rav Sheshet may present his own opinion on the matter, this cannot be the case, as the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: The first eating</b> must come <b>from non-sacred</b> property. In other words, the first animal one eats must come entirely from non-sacred property, and combining is permitted only for the second animal. This indicates that although one may combine an additional animal with that first one, one may not combine money with other money to purchase even one animal.",
            "The Gemara explains. <b>What is</b> the meaning of: <b>The first eating?</b> This means that when one combines non-sacred money with second-tithe money, <b>the monetary</b> value <b>of</b> the required <b>measure</b> of the <b>first eating</b> from the offering must come <b>from non-sacred</b> funds. However, the remaining value of that animal may come from second-tithe funds. Therefore, according to the opinion of Rav Sheshet, one may combine an animal with another animal, i.e., by purchasing two separate animals, one from non-sacred funds and one from second-tithe money. Another option is to purchase one animal with combined funds, provided that the first eating is from non-sacred funds.",
            "§ <b>Ulla said</b> that <b>Reish Lakish said:</b> If one <b>separated ten animals for</b> the purpose of <b>his Festival peace-</b>offering, and <b>he sacrificed five</b> of them <b>on the first</b> day of <b>the Festival, he may return and sacrifice</b> the remaining <b>five on the second day of the Festival,</b> or on any of the other days. There is no concern for the prohibition of: “You shall not add” (Deuteronomy 13:1), as though he were celebrating the first day twice, because the remaining offerings merely complete the first day’s offerings. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Since he stopped</b> after the first five offerings on the day on which he first brought the Festival peace-offerings, <b>he may no longer sacrifice</b> the remaining animals on the other days, as that would be considered celebrating an extra day.",
            "<b>Rabbi Abba said: And</b> these <i>amora’im</i> <b>do not disagree,</b> as they are referring to different circumstances. <b>Here,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan is speaking of a case <b>where one did not specify</b> when he intended to sacrifice these offerings, and therefore it is assumed that he meant to sacrifice them all on the first day. <b>There,</b> Reish Lakish is referring to a case <b>where one explicitly</b> said at the outset that he intended to bring them on all the days of the Festival (Rabbeinu Ḥananel).",
            "The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>this</b> case where he <b>did not specify, what are the circumstances?

In this case his bringing of the additional offerings is not prohibited.",
            "<b>But rather,</b> you must say that this is referring to a case <b>where he does not have</b> enough <b>eaters</b> in his household, and as one may not have leftovers, he did not sacrifice the remaining offerings.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach this ruling <b>only</b> in a case <b>where there is time</b> left <b>in the day and he has eaters</b> in his household. <b>From</b> the fact <b>that he did not sacrifice them on the first</b> day of the Festival, one can <b>conclude from</b> it that <b>he left them</b> intentionally.

            "The Gemara comments: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan agrees that if one specifies his intentions he may sacrifice the offerings on the remaining days, <b>as when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> If <b>one separated ten animals for his Festival peace-</b>offering, and <b>he sacrificed five on the first day</b> of <b>the Festival, he may return and sacrifice</b> the other <b>five on the second</b> day of the <b>Festival.</b> These two statements of Rabbi Yoḥanan, cited by Ulla and Ravin respectively, apparently <b>contradict each other.</b>",

            "The Gemara adds that the term assembly in each of these contexts is <b>free</b> for this verbal analogy, i.e., it is superfluous in both contexts. <b>As, if it is not free</b> the verbal analogy <b>can be refuted,</b> because each context in which the term appears contains features that do not apply to the other one. <b>What</b> can one say <b>about the seventh</b> day <b>of Passover?

            "§ The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the concept of <b>redress</b> mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>? The Gemara answers that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The other days are <b>redress for the first</b> day. If one did not bring the Festival offering on the first day, he may still do so on the remaining days of the Festival. <b>And Rabbi Oshaya said:</b> The days are <b>redress for one another.</b> Each day can be considered the main day of obligation, i.e., if one did not bring the offering on the first available day he may do so on the remaining days.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> these two explanations? <b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> The practical difference <b>between them</b> is in a case of one who was <b>lame on the first day</b> of the Festival <b>and was healed on the second day.

The second day is not for those who were completely exempt on the first, but for those who were obligated to sacrifice but neglected to do so. <b>And Rabbi Oshaya said</b> that the days are <b>redress for one another.</b> Consequently, <b>even though he was not fit</b> to bring the offering <b>on the first</b> day, he is <b>fit</b> to do so <b>on the second.</b> Since a separate obligation applies on each day, even if one was unfit to bring the offering on the first day he must do so when he becomes fit.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> actually <b>say this?</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan was involved in a dispute with regard to a nazirite. A nazirite who becomes ritually impure as a result of contact with a corpse must undergo a seven-day process of ritual purification, after which he must bring a set of offerings and restart counting the days of his nazirite period. Usually, a nazirite may bring one set of offerings even for many occurrences of ritual impurity. However, if he came into contact with a corpse for a second time on the eighth day after he first became ritually impure he must bring two sets of offerings, as the second impurity occurred at a time when he could have begun counting the days of his nazirite vow again. The <i>amora’im</i> dispute the details of this <i>halakha</i>.",
            "The Gemara continues. <b>Didn’t Ḥizkiya say</b> that if a nazirite <b>became ritually impure on</b> the eighth <b>day</b> itself, <b>he brings</b> a second set of offerings? However, if he became ritually impure <b>on the</b> previous <b>night he does not bring</b> an additional set of offerings, because he could not have brought the offering at night. Although seven complete days have passed, as he did not yet have the opportunity to bring the offering, it is as though his seven days were not yet complete. Consequently, he may still bring one set of offerings for the two instances of ritual impurity.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even</b> if the nazirite became ritually impure <b>on the night</b> on which the eighth day begins, <b>he also brings</b> a second set of offerings. Rabbi Yoḥanan maintains that this nazirite is effectively ready to begin counting the days of his vow again, as only the technicality that one may not bring offerings at night prevents him from doing so. This shows that according to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, even when one is incapable of sacrificing his offerings, his obligation remains intact. So too, in the case of a lame person, his obligation to bring the Festival offering applies in theory even on the first day, which means that he should be able to bring the offerings at a later date during the Festival.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said:</b> The case of one who cannot bring an offering due to <b>ritual impurity is different.</b> He is not completely disqualified, <b>as there is redress for</b> ritual purity. This can be demonstrated from the <i>halakha</i> <b>of the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>.</b> Just as one who is ritually impure and may not sacrifice the Paschal offering has the opportunity to redress the situation by means of the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>, so too, anyone who cannot bring an offering due to impurity may redress this at a later date.",
            "<b>Rav Pappa strongly objects to this</b> reasoning: <b>This works out well according to the one who said</b> that <b>the second <i>Pesaḥ</i></b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>is redress for the first</b> Paschal offering.

            "<b>Rather, Rav Pappa said: Rabbi Yoḥanan holds</b> that <b>night</b> is <b>not</b> considered part of a date <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived. Although one may not sacrifice offerings at night, the date itself has arrived and his period of impurity is complete, which is why any further impurity requires a second set of offerings. Consequently, Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion with regard to a lame person does not contradict his ruling concerning a nazirite. The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> actually <b>say this,</b> that night is not considered part of a date whose time has not yet arrived?",
            "<b>But didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> say: A <i>zav</i> at the end of his seven-day purification process who <b>saw</b> that he experienced <b>one</b> emission <b>at night and</b> then <b>two in the day brings</b> additional offerings for the second impurity? Had he experienced the emissions before he became ritually pure, he would have been required to bring only one set of offerings. However, once his purification is complete he must bring a separate set. In this case, the first emission occurred before he was able to sacrifice the offerings for his initial period of impurity. Nevertheless, as the two subsequent sightings occurred during the day, and they alone would suffice to confer upon him the status of a <i>zav</i>, they combine with the one from the previous night and he is required to bring new offerings.",
            "However, if he saw <b>two</b> emissions <b>at night and one in the day, he does not bring</b> additional offerings, because at night he could not yet sacrifice the offerings owed due to his current status, and without those two new sightings he would not become a <i>zav</i> again. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan holds</b> that <b>night</b> is <b>not</b> considered a date <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived, then <b>even</b> in the case where he saw <b>two</b> emissions <b>at night and one in the day he</b> should have to <b>bring</b> another set of offerings. He already reached the date of sacrificing the previous offerings before these new emissions occurred. This indicates that Rabbi Yoḥanan holds that night is considered part of a date whose time has not yet arrived.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>When Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> this statement, he spoke <b>according to the one who says</b> that <b>night</b> is considered part of a date <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived. However, he himself maintains that even if a <i>zav</i> saw all three emissions at night he must bring another offering. The Gemara asks: If he spoke only <b>according to the one who says</b> that opinion, it <b>is obvious</b> that no new offerings are required; what novel idea did Rabbi Yoḥanan intend to express? The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, <b>it was necessary for him</b> to teach the case of a <i>zav</i> who saw <b>two in the day and one at night.</b>",
            "The Gemara elaborates: It was necessary for Rabbi Yoḥanan to say this, lest it <b>enter your mind to say</b> in the manner <b>of the strong objection of Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi</b> (see <i>Keritot</i> 8a), who holds that there is no reason to distinguish between a <i>zav</i> seeing one or two emissions at night. Therefore, Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>teaches us</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Yosef,</b> that the first sighting confers merely the status of ritual impurity of one who has a seminal emission, and he is not yet classified as a <i>zav</i>. Consequently, there is a difference between one who experienced one emission at night and one who experienced two.",

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer said:</b> The <i>halakhot</i> of the dissolution of vows <b>have something to support them, as it is stated: “When</b> a man shall <b>clearly utter</b> a vow” (Leviticus 27:2), and: <b>“When</b> either man or woman shall <b>clearly utter</b> a vow” (Numbers 6:2), i.e., the words “clearly utter” appear <b>twice. One clear utterance is for prohibition,</b> i.e., when one states his intention to accept the vow, <b>and one clear utterance is for dissolution,</b> when he provides the Sage with a reason why the vow should no longer apply. This is an allusion in the Torah to the annulment of vows.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yehoshua</b> likewise <b>says:</b> These <i>halakhot</i> <b>have something to support them, as it is stated: “Wherefore I swore in My wrath”</b> (Psalms 95:11), meaning: <b>In my wrath I swore, and I retracted.</b> This is the basis for the dissolution of vows, in which the one who uttered the vow tells the Sage that he regrets it, as he did so in a moment of anger.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> These <i>halakhot</i> <b>have something to support them, as it is stated: “Whoever is of a willing heart,</b> let him bring it” (Exodus 35:5). This verse indicates that as long as one retains the same desire to fulfill the vow, he must continue to fulfill it, but if he regrets taking the vow he may arrange for it to be dissolved. <b>Ḥananya, son of Rabbi Yehoshua’s brother,</b> also <b>says: They have something to support them, as it is stated: “I have sworn, and have fulfilled it, to observe your righteous ordinances”</b> (Psalms 119:106). This verse indicates that certain oaths need not be fulfilled, i.e., those that have been dissolved.",
            "<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: If I had been there,</b> sitting with those Sages, I would have <b>said to them: My</b> source <b>is better than yours, as it is stated: “He shall not nullify his word”</b> (Numbers 30:3), from which it may be inferred: <b>He</b> himself <b>cannot nullify his word; however, others,</b> i.e., a Sage, <b>may nullify</b> it <b>for him</b> by dissolving his vow. <b>Rava said: For all of</b> the suggested sources for the dissolution of vows <b>there is</b> a possible <b>refutation, except for that of Shmuel, for which there is no refutation.</b>",
            "Rava elaborates. <b>As, if</b> it is derived <b>from</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Eliezer, perhaps</b> the phrase: “Clearly utter” should be understood <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who said</b> an alternative interpretation <b>in the name of Rabbi Tarfon. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to two people who are arguing whether or not someone who passed before them is a nazirite, each of them declaring that if he is correct he himself will become a nazirite, <b>Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Tarfon: Actually, neither of them is a nazirite, as naziriteship is effected only by</b> means of <b>a clear utterance</b> and neither party is certain they will be a nazirite at the time of their utterance. He derives this <i>halakha</i> from this phrase: “Clearly utter.”",

            "Finally, <b>if</b> it is derived <b>from</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Ḥananya, son of Rabbi Yehoshua’s brother, perhaps</b> the phrase “and fulfilled it” should be explained <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Giddel,</b> who said that <b>Rav said</b> a different interpretation of this verse. <b>As Rav Giddel said</b> that <b>Rav said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> although one is already obligated to fulfill all mitzvot <b>one may take an oath to fulfill a mitzva,</b> and this is not considered an oath taken in vain? <b>As it is stated: “I have sworn, and have fulfilled it, to observe Your righteous ordinances”</b> (Psalms 119:106).",

The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to say this <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Abba.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps this is what the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: The <b>fats</b> of gift offerings <b>that are brought during a Festival may not remain all night.</b> If so, the phrase “My Festival feast” is not referring to a type of offering at all, but to a particular time.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>However, if that is so,</b> this verse indicates that it is only those fats <b>that are brought during a Festival that may not remain overnight.</b> It may be inferred from here <b>that</b> fats which are brought <b>throughout the year may remain all night.</b> But <b>it is written</b> about burnt-offerings: “On its firewood upon the altar <b>all night into the morning”</b> (Leviticus 6:2).

            "The Gemara further asks: <b>Perhaps if</b> this <i>halakha</i> was derived <b>from that</b> verse, <b>I would say that</b> verse serves as the source <b>of a positive mitzva.</b> Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes this</b> verse: “Shall not remain all night,” <b>as a prohibition</b> as well.",

The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps</b> the verse: “Shall not remain all night” comes to teach that one who does so <b>violates two prohibitions and a positive mitzva.</b>",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara rejects this explanation in favor of the claim that the source for a Festival peace-offering <b>comes</b> from a verbal analogy between the term <b>“wilderness”</b> stated here and the term: <b>“wilderness”</b> stated elsewhere. <b>It is written here: “They shall make an offering to Me in the wilderness”</b> (Exodus 5:1), <b>and it is written there: “Did you bring to Me sacrifices and offerings</b> forty years <b>in the wilderness,</b> house of Israel?” (Amos 5:25). <b>Just as there</b> it is referring to actual <b>animal offerings, so too here,</b> it is referring to <b>animal offerings,</b> not merely the celebration of a Festival.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in light of this verbal analogy, in <b>what</b> way is this <i>halakha</i> <b>like mountains suspended by a hair?</b> The Gemara answers: The textual evidence is not that strong, as generally <b>one does not derive Torah matters from texts of the tradition,</b> i.e., Prophets and Writings. Since the prophets were not permitted to introduce new <i>halakhot</i>, as the Torah is the only authoritative source in that regard, this verbal analogy does not carry the same weight as a <i>halakha</i> derived from the Torah itself.",

The Gemara asks: But <b>they are written</b> in the Torah (Leviticus 5:14–16). <b>Rami bar Ḥama said:</b> This statement <b>is necessary only for that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Me’ila</i> 20a): With regard to <b>an agent who performs his agency,</b> e.g., when a homeowner sends someone to buy an object with consecrated money and the agent does as he was instructed, <b>the homeowner has misused</b> consecrated property and must bring an offering for the actions of the agent performed on his behalf.

            "The Gemara explains: <b>And when he performed his agency, why</b> is the owner considered to have <b>misused</b> consecrated property? <b>And is it</b> possible <b>that this one sins and that one is rendered liable?</b> Since this <i>halakha</i> is counterintuitive, it is not apparent from the verses. <b>This is</b> what the mishna was referring to when it said that these <i>halakhot</i> are <b>like mountains suspended by a hair.</b>",
            "<b>Rava said: And what is</b> the logical <b>difficulty</b> with this <i>halakha</i>? <b>Perhaps</b> the transgression of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>is different, as it is derived</b> through a verbal analogy from the parallel term <b>“sin”</b> (Leviticus 5:6) and <b>“sin”</b> (Numbers 18:9), <b>from</b> the case of <b><i>teruma</i>: Just as there,</b> with regard to <i>teruma</i>, the legal status of <b>a person’s agent is like</b> that of <b>himself,</b> and therefore the agent may separate <i>teruma</i> on behalf of the owner of the produce, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to misuse of consecrated property, the legal status of <b>a person’s agent is like</b> that of <b>himself,</b> which means that when the agent properly performs his agency the owner is liable.",
            "<b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The mishna’s statement with regard to mountains <b>is necessary only for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If, after he sent an agent to use a consecrated object, <b>the homeowner remembered</b> that it was a consecrated item <b>and the agent did not remember, the agent has misused</b> consecrated property despite the fact that he was merely performing his agency. This is because one is liable for the misuse of consecrated property only if he acted unwittingly.

However, he does not have permission to give it to someone else, and therefore when he hands it over to someone else he has misused consecrated property. If so, this <i>halakha</i> is also perfectly logical and should not be considered like mountains suspended by a hair.",

If <b>he did not dwell in it, no,</b> he has not misused consecrated property, as he gained no benefit from the stone.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the reason is <b>actually in accordance with</b> the aforementioned opinion <b>of Rava,</b> who holds that the innovative element of this <i>halakha</i> involves a case where the homeowner remembered, which caused the agent to misuse consecrated property. <b>And</b> with regard to that <b>which</b> posed <b>a difficulty for you,</b> i.e., that the <i>halakha</i> here should be <b>just as it is with</b> regard to <b>one who spends consecrated money for non-sacred</b> purposes, the two cases are not identical. <b>There,</b> in the case that Rava mentioned, the agent <b>knew that he</b> also <b>had consecrated coins</b> and therefore <b>he should have examined</b> carefully whether this money was consecrated. <b>Here, did</b> the agent <b>know</b> that there was a possibility that the money was consecrated? <b>This is</b> why this <i>halakha</i> is <b>like mountains suspended by a hair.</b>",
            "§ The mishna explained that those matters that are like mountains suspended by a hair have <b>little</b> written about them in <b>the Torah, and</b> yet the details of their <b><i>halakhot</i> are numerous.</b> A Sage <b>taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: The <i>halakhot</i> of <b>leprosy and</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity imparted by <b>tents</b> in which a corpse lies have <b>little in the Torah and</b> their <b><i>halakhot</i> are numerous.</b> The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>leprosy,</b> is there <b>little</b> about their <i>halakhot</i> in <b>the Torah?

The Gemara answers: It <b>is necessary</b> to state that sacrificial rites have merely something to support them <b>only with regard to</b> the rite of <b>carrying the blood</b> to the altar. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “And Aaron’s sons, the priests, <b>shall offer</b> the blood” (Leviticus 1:5); <b>this is</b> referring to <b>collecting the blood,</b> which is the stage before carrying the blood to the altar.",

            "Evidently, the Torah is referring to collecting the blood with the same terminology it used when referring to carrying. <b>That is to say that carrying should not be excluded from the category of collecting.</b> In other words, all the <i>halakhot</i> that pertain to collecting the blood of offerings, e.g., that it must be performed by a priest with his right hand, apply equally to carrying the blood.",

As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a verse that deals with creeping animals: “Whoever touches <b>them</b> when they are dead shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:31).",
            "One <b>might</b> have thought that only someone who touches <b>an entire,</b> whole creeping animal becomes ritually impure. <b>The verse states:</b> “And upon whatever any <b>of them</b> falls, when they are dead, it shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:32). “Of them” indicates that this <i>halakha</i> applies even if one comes into contact with a part of them. One <b>might</b> have thought that even <b>some of them</b> suffices to impart impurity. <b>The verse states: “Them,”</b> i.e., all of them. This conclusion apparently contradicts the first ruling.",
            "<b>How</b> can <b>this</b> apparent contradiction be resolved? One does not become impure <b>until he touches some of it that is like the whole,</b> i.e., a significant amount. And <b>the Sages estimated</b> this measure as the size <b>of a lentil-bulk.</b> The reason is <b>that</b> in <b>its early</b> stages, <b>the <i>ḥomet</i>,</b> the smallest of these creeping animals, is the size <b>of a lentil-bulk. Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says:</b> The size of a lentil-bulk is that <b>of a lizard’s tail,</b> which is considered a part that is like the whole. The tail of a lizard can be cut off easily, and as it continues to twitch even after it has been cut off, it has the appearance of life.

The verse seems to indicate that all these things are found on the earth. <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: David requested mercy with regard to them,</b> that they should not remain in heaven, <b>and He brought them down to earth. He said before Him: Master of the Universe, “You are not a God that has pleasure in wickedness, evil shall not sojourn with You”</b> (Psalms 5:5). In other words, <b>You are righteous, O Lord.</b> Nothing <b>evil should sojourn in Your vicinity.</b> Rather, it is better that they remain close to us. <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> this place <b>is called “heaven”?

Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya said to him: Akiva, what are you doing</b> occupying yourself <b>with</b> the study of <b><i>aggada</i>?</b> This is not your field of expertise. <b>Take [<i>kelakh</i>] your words to</b> the topics of <b>plagues and tents.</b> Meaning, it is preferable that you teach the <i>halakhot</i> of the impurity of leprosy and the impurity of the dead, which are within your field of expertise. <b>Rather,</b> with regard to the two thrones: <b>One</b> throne is <b>for a seat and one</b> is <b>for a small seat.</b> The <b>seat</b> is <b>to sit on,</b> and the <b>small seat</b> is <b>for His footstool, as it is stated: “The heavens are My seat, and the earth My footstool”</b> (Isaiah 66:1).",
            "§ The Gemara stated earlier that one who studies the secrets of Torah must be “a captain of fifty and a man of favor” (Isaiah 3:3), but it did not explain the meaning of these requirements. It now returns to analyze that verse in detail. <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Israel to Babylonia, <b>he said: Isaiah cursed Israel with eighteen curses, and his mind was not calmed,</b> i.e., he was not satisfied, <b>until he said to them the</b> great curse of the <b>following verse: “The child shall behave insolently against the aged, and the base against the honorable”</b> (Isaiah 3:5).",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What are these eighteen curses?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “For behold, the Master, the Lord of hosts, shall take away from Jerusalem and from Judah support and staff, every support of bread, and every support of water; the mighty man, and the man of war; the judge, and the prophet, and the diviner, and the elder; the captain of fifty, and the man of favor, and the counselor, and the cunning charmer, and the skillful enchanter. And I will make children their princes, and babes shall rule over them”</b> (Isaiah 3:1–4). The eighteen items listed in these verses shall be removed from Israel.",
            "The Gemara proceeds to clarify the homiletical meaning of these terms: <b>“Support”; these are masters of the Bible. “Staff”; these are masters of Mishna, such as Rabbi Yehuda ben Teima and his colleagues.</b> The Gemara interjects: <b>Rav Pappa and the Rabbis disagreed with regard to this. One</b> of them <b>said:</b> They were proficient in <b>six hundred orders of Mishna, and</b> the other <b>one said:</b> In <b>seven hundred orders of Mishna,</b> only six of which remain today.",
            "<b>“Every support of bread”; these are masters of Talmud, as it is stated: “Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine that I have mingled”</b> (Proverbs 9:5). <b>“And every support of water”; these are the masters of <i>aggada</i>, who draw people’s hearts like water by</b> means of <b><i>aggada</i>. “The mighty man”; this is the master of halakhic tradition,</b> one who masters the <i>halakhot</i> transmitted to him from his rabbis. <b>“And the man of war”; this is one who knows how to engage in the discourse of Torah,</b> generating novel teachings <b>in the war of Torah. “A judge”; this is a judge who judges a true judgment truthfully. “A prophet”; as it literally indicates. “A diviner”; this is a king.</b> Why is he called a diviner? <b>For it is stated: “A divine sentence is on the lips of the king”</b> (Proverbs 16:10). <b>“An elder”; this is one fit for</b> the position of head of <b>an academy.</b>",
            "<b>“A captain of fifty,” do not read</b> it as <b>“<i>sar ḥamishim</i>,” rather</b> read it as <b>“<i>sar ḥumashin</i>”; this is one who knows how to engage in discourse</b> with regard to <b>the five books of [<i>ḥamisha ḥumshei</i>] the Torah.

Others gain favor <b>below, for example: Rabbi Abbahu,</b> who would plead Israel’s case <b>in the house of</b> the <b>emperor.</b>",
            "<b>“The counselor”;</b> this is referring to one <b>who knows how to intercalate years and determine months,</b> due to his expertise in the phases of the moon and the calculation of the yearly cycle. <b>“The cunning”; this is a student who makes his rabbis wise</b> through his questions. <b>“Charmer [<i>ḥarashim</i>]”;</b> this is referring to one so wise <b>that when he begins speaking matters of Torah, all</b> those listening <b>are as though deaf [<i>ḥershin</i>],</b> as they are unable to comprehend the profundity of his comments. <b>“The skillful”; this is one who understands something</b> new <b>from something else</b> he has learned. <b>“Enchanter [<i>laḥash</i>]”; this</b> is referring to one <b>who is worthy of having words of the Torah that were given in whispers [<i>laḥash</i>],</b> i.e., the secrets of the Torah, <b>transmitted to him.</b>",
            "The Gemara continues to interpret this verse: <b>“And I will make children their princes”</b> (Isaiah 3:4). The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>“And I will make children [<i>ne’arim</i>] their princes”? Rabbi Elazar said: These are people who are devoid [<i>meno’arin</i>] of mitzvot;</b> such people will become the leaders of the nation.",
            "<b>“And babes [<i>ta’alulim</i>] shall rule over them”; Rav Pappa bar Ya’akov said:</b> <i>Ta’alulim</i> means <b>foxes [<i>ta’alei</i>], sons of foxes.</b> In other words, inferior people both in terms of deeds and in terms of lineage. <b>And</b> the prophet Isaiah’s <b>mind was not calmed until he said to them: “The child shall behave insolently against the aged, and the base against the honorable”</b> (Isaiah 3:5). “The child” [<i>na’ar</i>]; <b>these are people who are devoid of mitzvot,</b> who <b>will behave insolently toward one who is as filled with mitzvot as a pomegranate. “And the base [<i>nikleh</i>] against the honorable [<i>nikhbad</i>]”;</b> this means that <b>one for whom major [<i>kaved</i>]</b> transgressions <b>are like minor ones [<i>kalot</i>] in his mind will come and behave insolently with one for whom</b> even <b>minor</b> transgressions <b>are like major ones in his mind.</b>",
            "§ The Gemara continues its explanation of the chapter in Isaiah. <b>Rav Ketina said: Even at the time of Jerusalem’s downfall, trustworthy men did not cease to exist</b> among its people, <b>as it is stated: “For a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father,</b> and say: <b>You have a cloak, be our ruler”</b> (Isaiah 3:6). The Gemara explains that they would approach someone and say to him: <b>Things that people</b> are careful to keep <b>covered as with a cloak,</b> i.e., words of Torah that are covered and concealed, <b>are under your hand,</b> as you are an expert with regard to them.",
            "<b>What is</b> the meaning of the end of that verse: <b>“And this stumbling block”</b> (Isaiah 3:6)? <b>Things that people cannot grasp unless they have stumbled over them,</b> as they can be understood only with much effort, <b>are under your hand. Although</b> they will approach an individual with these statements, he <b>“shall swear that day, saying: I will not be a healer, for in my house there is neither bread nor a cloak; you shall not make me ruler of a people”</b> (Isaiah 3:7). When the verse states: <b>“Shall swear [<i>yissa</i>],” <i>yissa</i> is none</b> other <b>than an expression of an oath, as it is stated: “You shall not take [<i>tissa</i>] the name of the Lord your God</b> in vain” (Exodus 20:6). Therefore, the inhabitant of Jerusalem swears: <b>“I will not be a healer [<i>ḥovesh</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 3:7), which means: <b>I was never</b> one <b>of those who sit [<i>meḥovshei</i>] in the study hall; “for in my house there is neither bread nor a cloak,” as I possess</b> knowledge of <b>neither</b> the <b>Bible, nor Mishna, nor Gemara.</b> This shows that even at Jerusalem’s lowest spiritual ebb, its inhabitants would admit the truth and own up to their complete ignorance.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But perhaps it is different there, for if he had said: I have learned, they would have said to him: Tell us,</b> and people do not lie about things that can be easily verified. The Gemara rejects this claim: If he were a liar, <b>he would have said</b> that <b>he learned and forgot,</b> thereby avoiding shame. <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>“I will not be a healer,”</b> which seems to imply that he had learned in the past? It means: <b>I will not be a healer at all,</b> as I have never learned. Consequently, there were trustworthy men in Jerusalem after all.",
            "The Gemara raises another difficulty: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rava say: Jerusalem was not destroyed until trustworthy men ceased to exist in it, as it is stated: “Run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now and know, and seek in its broad places, if you can find a man, if there is any that acts justly, that seeks truth, and I will pardon her”</b> (Jeremiah 5:1), implying there were no trustworthy people at that time?

            "§ The Gemara returns to the topic of the Design of the Divine Chariot. <b>The Sages taught: An incident</b> occurred <b>involving Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai, who was riding on a donkey and was traveling along the way, and</b> his student, <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh, was riding a donkey behind him.</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>said to him: My teacher, teach me one chapter in the Design of the</b> Divine <b>Chariot.

            "<b>Immediately, Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai alighted from the donkey, and wrapped</b> his head in his cloak in a manner of reverence, <b>and sat on a stone under an olive tree.</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>said to him: My teacher, for what reason did you alight from the donkey? He said:</b> Is it <b>possible that</b> while <b>you are expounding the Design of the</b> Divine <b>Chariot, and the Divine Presence is with us, and the ministering angels are accompanying us, that I should ride on a donkey? Immediately, Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh began</b> to discuss <b>the Design of the</b> Divine <b>Chariot and expounded, and fire descended from heaven and encircled all the trees in the field, and all</b> the trees <b>began reciting song.</b>",
            "<b>What song did they recite? “Praise the Lord from the earth, sea monsters and all depths…fruit trees and all cedars…praise the Lord”</b> (Psalms 148:7–14). <b>An angel responded from the fire, saying: This is the very Design of the</b> Divine <b>Chariot,</b> just as you expounded. <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai stood and kissed</b> Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh <b>on his head, and said: Blessed be God, Lord of Israel, who gave our father Abraham a son</b> like you, <b>who knows</b> how <b>to understand, investigate, and expound the Design of the</b> Divine <b>Chariot.

            "The Gemara relates: <b>And when</b> these <b>matters,</b> this story involving his colleague Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh, <b>were recounted before Rabbi Yehoshua, he was walking along the way with Rabbi Yosei the Priest.

            "The Gemara poses a question: <b>Is that so?

            "§ <b>The Sages taught: Four entered the orchard [<i>pardes</i>],</b> i.e., dealt with the loftiest secrets of Torah, <b>and they are as follows: Ben Azzai; and ben Zoma; <i>Aḥer</i>,</b> the other, a name for Elisha ben Avuya; <b>and Rabbi Akiva.

            "The Gemara recounts the greatness of ben Zoma, who was an expert interpreter of the Torah and could find obscure proofs: <b>They asked ben Zoma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>castrating a dog?</b> The prohibition against castration appears alongside the sacrificial blemishes, which may imply that it is permitted to castrate an animal that cannot be sacrificed as an offering. <b>He said to them:</b> The verse states “That which has its testicles bruised, or crushed, or torn, or cut, you shall not offer to God, nor <b>shall you do so in your land”</b> (Leviticus 22:24), from which we learn: With regard to <b>any</b> animal <b>that is in your land, you shall not do</b> such a thing. <b>They</b> also <b>asked ben Zoma:</b> A woman considered <b>to be a virgin who became pregnant, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>A High Priest</b> may marry only a virgin; is he permitted to marry her? The answer depends on the following: <b>Are we concerned for</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel? Shmuel says:</b>"

        [
            "<b>I can engage in intercourse several times without blood.</b> In other words, I can have relations with a woman while leaving her hymen intact.

            "The Gemara asks: How could she possibly become pregnant in such a manner? <b>Didn’t Shmuel say: Any semen that is not shot like an arrow cannot fertilize?</b> The Gemara answers: This does not mean that it must be shot like an arrow at the moment of fertilization. Even if <b>initially,</b> when released from the male, <b>it was shot as an arrow,</b> it can <b>also</b> fertilize a woman at a later moment.",
            "With regard to the fate of ben Zoma, <b>the Sages taught: There was once an incident with regard to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya, who was standing on a step on the Temple Mount, and ben Zoma saw him and did not stand before him</b> to honor him, as he was deep in thought. Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: From where</b> do you come <b>and where are you going, ben Zoma,</b> i.e., what is on your mind? <b>He said to him:</b> In my thoughts <b>I was looking upon</b> the act of Creation, at the gap <b>between the upper waters and the lower waters, as there is only</b> the breadth of <b>a mere three fingers between them, as it is stated: “And the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters”</b> (Genesis 1:2), <b>like a dove hovering over its young without touching</b> them. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to his students</b> who had overheard this exchange: <b>Ben Zoma is still outside;</b> he has not yet achieved full understanding of these matters.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>Now,</b> this verse: <b>“And the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters,” when was</b> it stated? <b>On the first day,</b> whereas <b>the division</b> of the waters <b>occurred on the second day, as it is written: “And let it divide the waters from the waters”</b> (Genesis 1:6). How, then, could ben Zoma derive a proof from the former verse? The Gemara asks: <b>And how much,</b> in fact, is the gap between them? <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: Like the thickness of a thread; and the Rabbis said: Like</b> the gap between <b>the boards of a bridge. Mar Zutra, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Asi, said: Like two robes spread one over the other,</b> with a slight gap in between. <b>And some said: Like two cups placed one upon the other.</b>",

            "The Gemara proceeds to ask: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived; what is the biblical source for this prohibition? <b>As the Sages taught: “You shall observe the festival of Passover seven days”</b> (Exodus 23:15).

            "<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> concerning the same topic: With regard to the first day of Passover and <i>Sukkot</i>, the verse states: <b>“You shall do no kind of laborious work”</b> (Leviticus 23:35), followed by “seven days, you shall bring an offering made by fire to the Lord,” which <b>teaches that the performance of labor is prohibited during the intermediate Festival days;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei the Galilean.

The day of slaughter retains a measure of the sanctity of <i>Shavuot</i> through the offering of Festival offerings and should therefore be treated as a Festival. <b>There,</b> however, the mishna is referring <b>to a Festival that occurs on Shabbat.</b> Since in that case the day of slaughter occurs on a Sunday, it cannot be observed as a Festival, in order to counter the view of the Sadducees. <br>After discussing many issues unrelated to the main topic of the tractate, the Gemara now begins to discuss the topic of ritual purity and will do so for the remainder of the tractate.

            "The Gemara responds: It is <b>not difficult. Here</b> the mishna is referring <b>to eating,</b> before which one must wash his hands. <b>There</b> the mishna in <i>Bikkurim</i> deals <b>with touching</b> alone, for which prior washing of the hands is not necessary.",
            "<b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi strongly objects to this: The Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Meir only with regard to eating tithes, but with regard to touching tithes and eating non-sacred</b> food <b>they do not disagree</b> with him.

            "The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>And from where</b> is it clear that this is the meaning of the mishna? <b>Perhaps we are dealing with</b> one who <b>is sitting and awaiting</b> for <b>when a wave will detach</b> and fall on the vessels, and the implication is the opposite: <b>Vessels are similar</b> to <b>a person: Just as a person</b> is <b>capable of intention</b> to ritually purify himself, <b>so too</b> the case of the <b>vessels</b> mentioned in the mishna is referring to a situation <b>where one intends on their behalf</b> that they be purified.",
            "<b>And if you would say</b> that the mishna is indeed referring <b>to</b> one who <b>is sitting and awaiting, what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> this? Such a <i>halakha</i> would not appear to offer a novelty; why would it be necessary to state it?",
            "The Gemara responds: It nevertheless provides a novel teaching, as <b>it might enter your mind to say that it should be decreed</b> that a detached wave does not affect purification, <b>lest one come to immerse in a flow of rainwater</b> whose volume is forty <i>se’a</i>. In other words, one might think that immersion in a flood of rainwater affects purification, whereas the <i>halakha</i> is that rainwater purifies only if it is gathered in one location. <b>Alternatively,</b> you might think that <b>it should be decreed</b> that purification by means of <b>the edges</b> of the waves that comes in contact with the ground should be ineffective <b>due to</b> the upper <b>arcs</b> of the waves.

            "<b>Rather,</b> the proof that the purification with regard to non-sacred produce does not require intention is <b>from that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Makhshirin</i> 4:7): In the verse that is referring to the preconditions required for fruit and seeds to be susceptible to ritual impurity, it is stated: “If water be put on seeds, and any of their carcasses fall there, it shall be impure to you” (Leviticus 11:38). <b>If fruit fell into a water channel, and one whose hands were ritually impure extended his hands and lifted them up</b> with the goal of removing them from the water channel, <b>his hands are ritually pure,</b> as he has purified them by inserting them into the water channel, <b>and</b> these <b>fruits are not</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>“if</b> water <b>be put</b> on seeds.” The verse is referring only to fruit that has intentionally been brought into contact with water. Since the fruit in this case was not intentionally made wet, it cannot as yet contract impurity.",

            "In relation to the above, the Gemara explains: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> that one <b>whose foot is still in the water</b> is considered to be still immersing himself? <b>Rabbi Pedat said: It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 7:6): In the case of <b>a ritual bath that was measured and</b> found to <b>contain exactly forty <i>se’a</i></b> of water, <b>and</b> then <b>two</b> individuals <b>descended and immersed one after the other, the first one is ritually pure,</b> since he immersed in a valid ritual bath, <b>but the second is ritually impure.</b> Because a small amount of water clings to the first individual, the ritual bath subsequently holds less than the requisite amount. Therefore, it does not purify the second individual. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: If the feet of the first one were</b> still <b>touching the water,</b> so that he had not yet exited the ritual bath entirely while the second one immersed, <b>the second is also ritually pure.</b> This teaches that Rabbi Yehuda is of the opinion that one who still has a foot in the water is considered to be inside the ritual bath.",

            "The Gemara clarifies the dilemma raised by this question: Does <b>Rabbi Yehuda accept</b> only the principle of <b>lowering the partition,</b> meaning that an item positioned above another item is considered as if it continued downward, and therefore the water on the body of the one immersing is viewed as descending into the ritual bath, so that the bath retains its requisite size; but <b>he does not accept</b> the concept of <b>raising the partition,</b> so that the water in the ritual bath is not considered to rise up to one’s head, making him part of the ritual bath as well? <b>Or, perhaps he also accepts</b> the principle of <b>raising the partition,</b> which means that one is indeed considered part of the ritual bath?",

The Gemara answers: <b>We do not accept</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>from</b> <i>amei ha’aretz</i>, as they are not trustworthy with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual purity, and therefore it does not matter if the vessels he uses for <i>teruma</i> are not immersed properly. Therefore, the Sages were not concerned that the <i>am ha’aretz</i> may come to a misunderstanding when observing a <i>ḥaver</i> immersing vessels within vessels.",
            "The Gemara continues its line of questioning. If so, <b>we should likewise not accept sacrificial</b> food <b>from</b> <i>amei ha’aretz</i>, since they are not sufficiently meticulous with ritual purity, and we should therefore not care if they immerse their vessels improperly. The Gemara responds: The <i>am ha’aretz</i> <b>will have</b> feelings of <b>antagonism</b> if sacrificial food is not accepted from him, and this would lead to internal discord and conflict within Israel.",
            "The Gemara asks: If so, in the case of <b><i>teruma</i> he will also have</b> feelings of <b>antagonism</b> if <i>teruma</i> is not accepted from him.

            "The Gemara notes that this sensitivity of not causing offense to the <i>am ha’aretz</i> is expressed elsewhere as well: <b>And who is the <i>tanna</i> that is concerned for</b> such <b>antagonism</b> of <i>amei ha’aretz</i>? <b>It is Rabbi Yosei, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei said: For what</b> reason are <b>all</b> people, i.e., even <i>amei ha’aretz</i>, <b>trusted with regard to the purity of</b> their <b>wine and oil</b> that they bring to the Temple for sacrificial purposes <b>throughout the year?</b> Why is the status of these items not investigated to determine that they were prepared with the necessary regard for ritual purity? In order to avoid schisms among the people, <b>so that each and every individual should not go off and build a</b> private <b>altar for himself and burn a red heifer for himself.</b> Were the Sages to reject sacrificial wine and oil from <i>amei ha’aretz</i>, they would become alienated and go off and create schisms, going so far as to build their own separate temples and bring their own private offerings.",
            "<b>Rav Pappa said: In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>do we accept testimony nowadays from an <i>am ha’aretz</i>,</b> despite the concern of some Sages that their carelessness with regard to observance of <i>halakha</i> might also lead to personal untrustworthiness? <b>In accordance with whom</b> is this done? <b>In accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b>",
            "§ We have established that the reason for leniency with regard to immersing one vessel inside another for <i>teruma</i> is based on the fact that we do not care if the vessels <i>amei ha’aretz</i> use for <i>teruma</i> are improperly purified, since we do not accept <i>teruma</i> from them in any event. The Gemara asks: <b>But let us be concerned about borrowing</b> vessels from them. Although <i>ḥaverim</i> do not accept <i>teruma</i> from an <i>am ha’aretz</i>, they do sometimes borrow their vessels and use them for <i>teruma</i>. It should therefore be a matter of concern for us if those vessels are not properly purified.",
            "The Gemara proves that it is acceptable to borrow vessels from an <i>am ha’aretz</i>: <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 1:14): <b>An earthenware vessel</b> of an <i>am ha’aretz</i> <b>shields</b> all kinds of items from the ritual impurity imparted by a corpse. There are two applications of this fact: If there are objects or foods inside a tightly sealed earthenware vessel located inside a room containing a corpse, the vessel prevents the impurity from reaching the items inside it. Also, if there is a corpse in the first floor of a house and food or vessels are located in a second story of the same building, with an opening such as a skylight in the floor between the two stories, an earthenware vessel plugging up the opening will prevent the ritual impurity from spreading to the second story. This is <b>the statement of Beit Hillel. Beit Shammai say: It shields only food, drink, and earthenware vessels,</b> but not utensils of metal, wood, cloth, etc.",
            "The mishna continues: <b>Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai: For what</b> reason do you make this distinction? It is clear that a closed, pure earthenware vessel serves as a barrier, blocking the spread of impurity in a room with a corpse (see Numbers 19:15). <b>Beit Shammai said</b> to them: <b>Because</b> the earthenware vessel itself <b>is impure on account of</b> its contact with <b>an <i>am ha’aretz</i>.</b> The Sages decreed that anything touched by an <i>am ha’aretz</i> is impure, since such people are not meticulous or sufficiently knowledgeable about the <i>halakhot</i> of purity; therefore his vessels are considered impure. <b>And</b> the principle is that <b>an impure vessel does not serve as a barrier</b> from impurity. <b>Beit Hillel said to them: But didn’t you declare the food and drink inside</b> the earthenware vessel to be <b>pure?</b> If the vessel of an <i>am ha’aretz</i> cannot serve as a barrier, why do you say that some items inside it are pure? <b>Beit Shammai said to them: When we declared the food and drink inside it to be pure,</b>"

        [
            "<b>we declared</b> them <b>pure for</b> the <i>am ha’aretz</i> <b>himself,</b> not for <i>ḥaverim</i>, since <i>ḥaverim</i> in any event do not consider anything touched by an <i>am ha’aretz</i> to be pure. A <i>ḥaver</i> would therefore never relate to the food of an <i>am ha’aretz</i> as pure, and he would not use the earthenware vessels of an <i>am ha’aretz</i> for preparation of pure food, since an earthenware vessel cannot be purified through immersion. However, he might borrow a metal vessel, for instance, and purify it through immersion before using it for pure food.",
            "<b>But</b> how <b>can we purify a vessel</b> of metal and other materials, <b>whose purity</b> would be relevant both <b>for you and for him?</b> A <i>ḥaver</i> may one day borrow a metal vessel from the <i>am ha’aretz</i>, and not realize that it was once inside an earthenware vessel in the same room as a corpse and as a result requires extensive purification from corpse contamination through the ashes of the red heifer, rather than mere immersion. Therefore, the <i>am ha’aretz</i> is informed that his vessels of metal and other materials have contracted impurity from the corpse, and must undergo the extensive purification process, and after this is done these vessels will now be fit for use of the <i>ḥaver</i> after mere immersion.",
            "<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to this debate between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said: I am ashamed of your words, Beit Shammai,</b> for they are illogical.

Similarly: Is it possible that there is <b>a</b> metal <b>pitcher [<i>login</i>] full of liquid</b> in the second story, and the <b>pitcher</b> should be <b>impure with impurity of seven</b> days, <b>while the liquids</b> remain <b>pure?</b>",
            "After Rabbi Yehoshua posed this question, <b>one student from among the students of Beit Shammai approached him</b> and <b>said to him: I will tell you Beit Shammai’s reasoning. He said to him: Speak. He said to him: Does an impure vessel serve as a barrier</b> to corpse contamination <b>or does it not serve as a barrier?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: It does not serve as a barrier.</b> The student asked further: And <b>is a vessel of an <i>am ha’aretz</i> pure or impure? He said to him: Impure.</b> The student responded: <b>And if you tell him</b> that his vessel <b>is impure, will he pay attention to you at all?</b> Clearly he will not. <b>What is more, if you say to him</b> that it is <b>impure, he will say to you:</b> On the contrary, <b>my</b> vessel <b>is pure and yours is impure.</b>",
            "<b>And that is Beit Shammai’s reasoning:</b> Food, drink, and earthenware vessels inside a sealed earthenware vessel remain pure, as, since they belong to an <i>am ha’aretz</i>, a <i>ḥaver</i> will not eat the food or borrow the earthenware vessel. Vessels of metal or similar materials may one day be borrowed by a <i>ḥaver</i>, however, and therefore Beit Shammai declared these to be impure.",
            "Once he heard the logic behind Beit Shammai’s opinion, <b>Rabbi Yehoshua immediately went and prostrated himself on the graves of Beit Shammai,</b> i.e., the students and proponents of Shammai, and <b>said: I humble myself before you, bones of Beit Shammai. If such</b> clarity and wisdom is <b>found in your</b> rulings that you stated and left <b>unexplained, all the more so</b> must this be the case <b>in your</b> rulings when they were stated and <b>explained.</b> People <b>said</b> of Rabbi Yehoshua: <b>Throughout his days his teeth darkened because of</b> all <b>his fasts</b> that he undertook to atone for having spoken inappropriately of Beit Shammai.",
            "The Gemara returns to its main point. <b>In any event,</b> this mishna <b>teaches</b> that the status of the vessels of an <i>am ha’aretz</i> is relevant both <b>for you and for him. Apparently,</b> then, <b>we</b> <i>ḥaverim</i> <b>may borrow</b> vessels <b>from</b> <i>amei ha’aretz</i>. The question therefore arises: Why are the Sages not concerned that <i>amei ha’aretz</i> may immerse vessels inside of other vessels in an inappropriate way, so that they will remain unpurified when borrowed by a <i>ḥaver</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>For when we</b> <i>ḥaverim</i> <b>borrow</b> vessels <b>from them we immerse them</b> before using them. It is therefore inconsequential to us if their vessels were not immersed properly beforehand.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so, let Beit Hillel respond to Beit Shammai.</b> They can respond as follows: <b>When we borrow</b> vessels <b>from them we immerse them,</b> and that is why we rule that vessels of metal or similar materials are pure. The Gemara explains: That dispute is referring to the impurity of a corpse. <b>And that which becomes impure by</b> proximity to <b>a corpse requires sprinkling</b> of the red heifer’s ashes on the <b>third and seventh</b> days of its purification, <b>and people do not</b> generally <b>lend vessels for seven days.</b> The solution the <i>ḥaver</i> implements of immersing vessels that he borrows from an <i>am ha’aretz</i> is effective only for other impurities, but not for the impurity imparted by a corpse.",
            "The Gemara poses a question with regard to the <i>halakha</i> that a <i>ḥaver</i> must immerse vessels that he borrows from an <i>am ha’aretz</i>: <b>But</b> is it so that <i>amei ha’aretz</i> <b>are not trusted with regard to immersion? Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b><i>Amei ha’aretz</i> are trusted with regard to the purification</b> process <b>of immersion of that which has become impure by</b> contact with <b>a corpse?</b> In addition to being sprinkled with purification water on the third and seventh days, a person or article that has been in contact with a corpse must also undergo immersion on the seventh day. An <i>am ha’aretz</i> is believed when he says that he has performed this immersion.",
            "The Gemara presents two answers for this question. <b>Abaye said</b> one answer: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that an <i>am ha’aretz</i> is trusted, is referring <b>to</b> the immersion of <b>his body,</b> whereas <b>this</b> teaching of the Gemara that <i>amei ha’aretz</i> are not trusted concerning immersion deals <b>with his vessels. Rava said</b> a different answer: Both <b>this and that,</b> both the <i>baraita</i> and the Gemara’s teaching, refer <b>to</b> the <b>vessels</b> of an <i>am ha’aretz</i>, <b>and it is</b> nevertheless <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that an <i>am ha’aretz</i> is trusted, is referring to an <i>am ha’aretz</i> <b>who said: I never immersed one vessel inside another,</b> which is a statement that we accept. <b>And this</b> teaching of the Gemara that <i>amei ha’aretz</i> are not trusted deals with one <b>who said: I have immersed</b> vessels inside of other vessels, <b>but I did not immerse with a vessel whose mouth does not have</b> the width of <b>the tube of a wineskin.</b> It is with regard to such details that an <i>am ha’aretz</i> cannot be trusted.",
            "<b>And so it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> to this effect: <b>An <i>am ha’aretz</i> is trusted to say</b> that <b>produce has not been made susceptible</b> to impurity, i.e., that it has never come into contact with water, <b>but he is not trusted to say</b> that the <b>produce has been made susceptible</b> to impurity <b>but has not</b> actually <b>become impure.</b> This <i>baraita</i> shows that <i>amei ha’aretz</i> are trusted concerning basic facts, but not concerning matters that require detailed knowledge and scrupulous care.",
            "The Gemara poses a question with regard to Abaye’s opinion: <b>And is</b> an <i>am ha’aretz</i> really <b>trusted</b> concerning <b>his body,</b> when he claims to have immersed? <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Concerning <b>a <i>ḥaver</i> who comes</b> before those in charge of sprinkling water of purification <b>to be sprinkled</b> with that water, and claims that the requisite three days have passed since his contamination by a corpse, <b>they may sprinkle upon him immediately. But</b> concerning <b>an <i>am ha’aretz</i> who comes</b> before them and claims that three days have passed, <b>they may not sprinkle upon him until he performs</b> and counts <b>in our presence</b> the <b>third</b> day <b>and</b> the <b>seventh</b> day? This shows that an <i>am ha’aretz</i> is not trusted concerning the purity of his own body.",
            "<b>Rather, Abaye said,</b> modifying his previous explanation: <b>Because of the stringency that you applied to</b> the <i>am ha’aretz</i> <b>in his beginning,</b> i.e., at the beginning of the purification process, by not allowing him to purify himself without first ensuring that he has not been in contact with a corpse for three days, <b>you</b> may <b>be lenient with him in his end,</b> in that he is trusted regarding having immersed at the end of the seven days, removing the impurity contracted through contact with a corpse.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: The <i>halakhot</i> of <b>the back</b> of a vessel <b>and</b> its <b>inside</b> apply to vessels used for <i>teruma</i>, but not for sacrificial food. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of: <b>The back and</b> its <b>inside?</b>",
            "The Gemara explains. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Keilim</i> 25:6): <b>A vessel whose back</b> part, as opposed to its inside, <b>was defiled by</b> contact with impure <b>liquid. Its back is impure,</b> while its other parts, such as <b>its inside, its rim, its ear-shaped handles, and its</b> straight <b>handles are pure.</b> By Torah law, foods and liquids cannot impart ritual impurity to a vessel at all, but by rabbinic law liquids can. In order to clarify that it is only a rabbinic decree, they instituted that the impurity thereby imparted, if the liquid touched the outside of the vessel, should affect only the part touched by the liquid, but not its inside or the other parts of its outside. However, if <b>its inside was defiled,</b> even by impurity only according to rabbinic law, <b>it is all impure.</b> This <i>halakha</i> applies only to <i>teruma</i>, but regarding offerings, the defilement of any part of the vessel renders it all impure.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: <b>And its place for gripping.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of: <b>Place for gripping [<i>beit hatzevita</i>]? Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> It is the <b>place</b> where <b>he</b> grips the vessel in order to <b>pass [<i>tzovet</i>]</b> it, a kind of indentation used for grasping the vessel. <b>And similarly it states: “And he pinched [<i>vayitzbat</i>] some parched corn for her”</b> (Ruth 2:14), which means that he gave her a little of the corn. Therefore, the term is referring to a place on the vessel used to grasp it. <b>Rabbi Asi</b> said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is the <b>place that fastidious people</b> use for <b>dipping.</b> A small receptacle for spices and the like would be attached to the sides of vessels for dipping one’s food.",
            "<b>Rav Beivai taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Naḥman: No vessels have</b> this difference between <b>the back and inside, whether</b> they are vessels used for <b>consecrated</b> foods <b>of the Temple or</b> those used for <b>consecrated</b> foods <b>of outlying areas,</b> i.e., outside the Temple. In these cases, if one of the parts of the vessel was defiled with impure liquids the entire vessel becomes impure. Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: What are these consecrated</b> foods <b>of outlying areas</b> mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>? This term is usually applied to <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> but if so the <i>baraita</i> contradicts the mishna. For <b>didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: The <i>halakhot</i> of <b>the back</b> of a vessel <b>and</b> its <b>inside and its place for gripping</b> apply <b>to</b> vessels used for <b><i>teruma</i>?</b>",
            "Rav Naḥman continued: <b>Perhaps</b> when you said the consecrated foods of outlying areas you were not referring to <i>teruma</i>, but rather <b>you are speaking of non-sacred</b> food <b>prepared according to the</b> standards of <b>purity of sacrificial</b> food, and you called them consecrated foods of outlying areas because this level of purity can be observed outside the Temple as well.",
            "In the course of this discussion Rav Naḥman said to Rav Beivai: <b>You have</b> now <b>reminded me</b> of something that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said</b> concerning this issue: <b>They taught eleven stringencies</b> of sacrificial food <b>here</b> in the mishna. The <b>first six</b> apply <b>both to sacrificial</b> food <b>and to non-sacred</b> food <b>prepared according to the</b> standards of <b>purity of sacrificial</b> food, whereas <b>the last</b> five <b>apply</b> only <b>to sacrificial</b> food<b>s but not to non-sacred</b> food <b>prepared according to the</b> standards of <b>purity of sacrificial</b> food. Rabba bar Avuh’s statement therefore corroborates the interpretation of the <i>baraita</i> as dealing with non-sacred food prepared according to the standards of purity of sacrificial foods.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: <b>One who carries an object trodden</b> by a <i>zav</i> may <b>carry <i>teruma</i></b> at the same time, if he is careful that neither he nor the impure object come into contact with the <i>teruma</i>, <b>but</b> this may <b>not</b> be done with <b>sacrificial</b> food. The Gemara asks: Concerning <b>sacrificial</b> food, <b>what is the reason</b> that he may <b>not</b> carry it? As long as contact with the food is prevented, why should he not carry sacrificial food as well? The Gemara answers: This enactment was made <b>due to an incident that occurred. As Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> There was once <b>an incident involving someone who was transferring a barrel of sacrificial wine from one place to another,</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>and the strap of his sandal,</b> which had been rendered ritually impure by being trodden by a <i>zav</i>, <b>broke off, and he picked up</b> the strap <b>and placed it on</b> top of <b>the mouth of</b> the <b>barrel, and</b> it <b>fell into the airspace of the barrel,</b> thereby <b>rendering</b> the entire barrel <b>impure. At that time</b> the Sages <b>said</b> and issued a permanent decree that <b>one who carries an object that is impure by having been trodden</b> by a <i>zav</i> <b>may carry <i>teruma</i></b> at the same time, <b>but not sacrificial</b> food.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> if they prohibited doing so due to that incident, they should have made the same decree with regard to <b><i>teruma</i> also,</b> because if the same incident would occur with <i>teruma</i> it would defile the <i>teruma</i> as well. The Gemara answers: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> stated? <b>It is</b> that of <b>Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya, who said</b> concerning a similar issue: <b>They prohibited</b> it <b>only in the Jordan</b> River, <b>and</b> only <b>in a boat,</b> in a situation <b>similar to the incident that occurred,</b> which triggered the enactment. In his opinion, whenever the Sages enacted a decree prohibiting something due to a particular incident, they did not extend the prohibition to related cases, but only to the same set of circumstances that pertained to that specific incident.",
            "The Gemara presents the background to Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya’s statement: <b>What is that</b> enactment that Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya was referring to? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person may not carry the water of purification and the ashes of purification and transport them across the Jordan</b> River, <b>and</b> this is if he is <b>on a boat. Nor may he stand on one side</b> of the river <b>and throw them to the other side. Nor may he float them</b> across the river. <b>Nor may he</b> ford the river <b>riding on an animal or on his friend</b> and carrying the water or ashes of purification, <b>unless his feet are touching the ground</b> as he fords the river. <b>But he may transfer them</b> across the river <b>over a bridge without concern</b> about transferring them improperly. This decree applies <b>both</b> to <b>the Jordan and</b> to <b>other rivers. Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya says:</b> The Sages <b>prohibited</b> these acts <b>only in the Jordan</b> River, <b>and</b> only if he transports them <b>in a boat, and</b> in circumstances exactly <b>like</b> those of <b>the incident that occurred.</b>",
            "The Gemara inquires: <b>What</b> was the <b>incident that occurred? Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> There was once <b>an incident involving a person who was transferring water of purification and ashes of purification in the Jordan, and</b> he was <b>on a boat, and an olive-bulk</b> from a <b>corpse was discovered stuck in the floor of the boat,</b> over which the water of purification had passed, thereby rendering them impure and invalid. <b>At that time</b> the Sages <b>said: A person may not carry water of purification and ashes of purification and transport them across the Jordan,</b> and this is if he is <b>on a boat.</b> Just as in that case, Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya stated that the decree was limited to the specific circumstances of the original incident, here too, he would say that since the original incident involved sacrificial food and not <i>teruma</i> the Sages did not apply the decree to <i>teruma</i>.",
            "Several <b>dilemmas were raised before</b> the scholars: It is clear that this <i>halakha</i>, like the incident itself, applies to an object that has actually contracted impurity by being trodden by a <i>zav</i>, such as an <b>impure sandal.</b> But if it is <b>a pure sandal, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is the decree so far-reaching as to include a prohibition against carrying even a pure sandal together with sacrificial food? Similarly, the <i>halakha</i> certainly applies to <b>an open barrel,</b> where there is a danger that the sandal may enter the airspace of the barrel, as in the original incident, but if it was <b>a closed barrel,</b> where there is no such danger, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does the decree apply in this case as well? Another question: If someone <b>transgressed</b> this decree <b>and carried</b> an impure sandal together with sacrificial food, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Did the Sages decree that the sacrificial food would become defiled because their decree was transgressed or not?",
            "The Gemara presents a conclusion for the last dilemma. <b>Rabbi Ila said: If one transgressed and carried</b> sacrificial food together with an impure sandal, <b>it is</b> indeed rendered <b>impure. Rabbi Zeira said:</b> If <b>he transgressed and carried</b> sacrificial food in this manner, <b>it is</b> still <b>pure.</b>",
            "§ The mishna states: <b>Vessels that were</b> fashioned and <b>completed in purity</b> require immersion for sacrificial food but not for <i>teruma</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>Who completed</b> the work of these vessels? <b>If we say that</b> it was <b>a <i>ḥaver</i>,</b> an individual who is meticulous about the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual purity, who <b>completed them, why</b> should <b>they</b> require <b>immersion,</b> given that he is meticulous about the <i>halakhot</i> of purity?",
            "<b>Rather,</b> it must mean <b>that an <i>am ha’aretz</i> completed them.</b> But can one <b>call these</b> vessels <b>completed in purity?</b> The very touch of an <i>am ha’aretz</i> renders them impure. <b>Rabba bar Sheila said</b> that <b>Rav Mattana said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Actually,</b> the mishna is dealing with vessels <b>that a <i>ḥaver</i> completed,</b> and the Sages declared them impure for sacrificial food <b>due to</b> a concern that the <b>spittle of an <i>am ha’aretz</i></b> might have fallen on them, which would render them impure if he were a <i>zav</i>.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>When did</b> this hypothetical spittle <b>fall</b> on the vessel? <b>If we say</b> it was <b>before he completed</b> the vessel, in <b>that</b> case <b>it is not</b> yet <b>a vessel,</b> and therefore cannot contract impurity at that stage at all. <b>Rather,</b> it must have sprayed onto the vessel <b>after he completed it.</b> But at that point, since he is a <i>ḥaver</i>, <b>he is careful about it.</b> He would ensure that no spittle would fall on it, so there is no danger that it might have become defiled. The Gemara responds: <b>Actually,</b> we must explain that the spittle fell <b>before he completed it,</b> when the <i>ḥaver</i> was not yet guarding it against impurity, <b>and</b> the Sages were concerned that <b>perhaps at the moment when he completed</b> the vessel the spittle <b>was still moist,</b> and thus still capable of defiling the finished vessel, for the continued presence of the spittle on the vessel might have escaped the attention of the <i>ḥaver</i> craftsman.",
            "The Gemara comments: The mishna states that the vessel requires immersion, implying: <b>Immersion, yes,</b> but <b>the setting of the sun</b> after immersion, <b>not,</b> i.e., it is considered pure immediately after immersion, even though generally the purification engendered by immersion does not take effect until sunset.",
            "The Gemara asks: If so, <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 5:4): Regarding <b>a tube</b> of reed, <b>which one cut for</b> storing ashes of <b>purification, Rabbi Eliezer says: He should immerse</b> it <b>immediately; Rabbi Yehoshua says: He should</b> first <b>render</b> it <b>impure</b> by touching it to an actual source of impurity <b>and</b> only <b>after that immerse</b> it. <b>And we discussed</b> the mishna’s case, asking: <b>Who cut</b> this tube? <b>If we say a <i>ḥaver</i> cut it, why do I</b> need <b>immersion?</b> The <i>ḥaver</i> prepared it with the strictest adherence to the <i>halakhot</i> of purity. <b>Rather,</b> it must be that an <i>am ha’aretz</i> <b>cut it.</b> But <b>in that case, would Rabbi Yehoshua say</b> that <b>he should</b> first <b>render</b> it <b>impure and</b> only then <b>immerse</b> it? <b>Isn’t it already impure,</b> due to the handling of the <i>am ha’aretz</i>?",
            "<b>And</b> in response to this question, <b>Rabba bar Sheila said</b> that <b>Rav Mattana said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Actually,</b> the case is <b>that a <i>ḥaver</i> cut it, and</b> the reason it requires immersion is <b>because</b> the Sages were concerned that the <b>spittle of an <i>am ha’aretz</i></b> might have touched it. The Gemara asks: <b>When did</b> this hypothetical spittle <b>fall</b> on the tube? <b>If we say</b> it was <b>before he cut</b> the tube, in <b>that</b> case <b>it is not</b> yet <b>a vessel</b> and therefore cannot contract impurity at that stage. <b>Rather,</b> it must have sprayed onto the vessel <b>after he completed it.</b> But at that point, since he is a <i>ḥaver</i>, <b>he is careful about it</b> and would ensure that no spittle would fall on it, so there is no danger that it might have become impure.

            "The Gemara continues: <b>Granted, according to Rabbi Yehoshua it is</b> found <b>that there is</b> an act of <b>recognition</b> performed in opposition <b>to</b> the <b>Sadducees,</b> in order to demonstrate that the Sages do not take their opinions into account.",
            "<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 3:7): <b>They would render impure the priest who burns the</b> red <b>heifer, in order to counter the opinion of</b> the <b>Sadducees, who used to say:</b> The ritual of the red heifer <b>was</b> to be <b>performed by those who had experienced sunset</b> after their immersion. The Sadducee opinion was that all those involved in the preparation of the red heifer must be completely pure, having undergone immersion as well as having waited until after sunset, when the purification takes full effect. The Sages, however, maintain that the red heifer may be prepared by people immediately after immersion, without waiting for sunset. In order to clearly demonstrate their rejection of the Sadducee opinion they would deliberately defile the people involved with preparing the red heifer and then immerse them. It is for this reason as well that Rabbi Yehoshua ruled that the tube must be rendered impure before it is immersed.",
            "<b>But according to Rabbi Eliezer, granted, if you say</b> that <b>generally, the setting of the sun is required</b> after a vessel is completed, <b>it is</b> found <b>that there is</b> some act of <b>recognition</b> in opposition <b>to</b> the <b>Sadducees,</b> as according to him, the tube used for the red heifer ashes, which should normally have required the setting of the sun, is used without waiting for sunset. <b>But if you say</b> that <b>generally the setting of the sun is not required</b> to remove the impurity caused by the touch of an <i>am ha’aretz</i>, and immersion alone is sufficient, <b>what</b> act of <b>recognition</b> in opposition <b>to</b> the <b>Sadducees is there</b> here? It must be, therefore, that Rabbi Eliezer requires the setting of the sun for purification from the impurity imparted by an <i>am ha’aretz</i>. Therefore, the mishna, which implies that immersion alone is sufficient, does not accord with Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion.",
            "<b>Rav said:</b> Indeed, Rabbi Eliezer does not require the setting of the sun for vessels that have been completed in purity, but there is nevertheless a demonstrative sign that the opinion of the Sadducees is rejected,"

        [
            "as <b>they treated</b> the tube with severity <b>as</b> though it had been <b>rendered impure</b> by contact with a dead <b>creeping animal.</b> Therefore, in not requiring the setting of the sun they made it noticeable that they were opposed to the Sadducees.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty. <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> that the tube is treated as if defiled by a creeping animal, <b>it should not render a person impure,</b> as something defiled by a creeping animal is impure to the first degree of ritual impurity, which cannot impart ritual impurity to people. <b>Why,</b> then, <b>is it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The one who <b>cuts and immerses</b> the tube for the red heifer ashes <b>requires immersion</b> himself, which shows that the tube does defile people? <b>But rather,</b> say that <b>they treated it as</b> something <b>made impure by</b> contact with <b>a corpse,</b> for such objects do defile people as well. The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> the tube <b>should</b> also <b>require the sprinkling</b> of the water of purification on the <b>third and seventh</b> days of its purification, like all things defiled by a corpse.",
            "<b>Why,</b> then, <b>is it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The one who <b>cuts and immerses it requires immersion,</b> which indicates that <b>immersion</b> for the tube, <b>yes,</b> this is required, but <b>sprinkling of the third and the seventh</b> day, <b>no.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Sages <b>never made any innovations</b> in the <i>halakhot</i> of impurity <b>with regard to the</b> red <b>heifer</b> procedure. In other words, although the Sages added stringencies to the red heifer procedure, they never created new <i>halakhot</i> for it that do not exist elsewhere in other areas of <i>halakha</i>. We have said that the tube is treated as if it had had contact with a corpse even though it did not; this is an innovation that is not found anywhere else.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Abaye said:</b> When they said that the Sages did not make innovations, they were not referring to something of this nature, but meant that <b>they did not say</b> that <b>a spade</b> upon which a <i>zav</i> sits <b>can become impure as a seat.</b> They thereby preserved the basic <i>halakhot</i> of impurity, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It states with regard to a <i>zav</i>: <b>“And he who sits on any object</b> whereon the <i>zav</i> sits shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening” (Leviticus 15:6). One <b>might</b> have thought that if a <i>zav</i> <b>turned over</b> a vessel used to measure <b>a <i>se’a</i> and sat on it,</b> or if he turned over a vessel used to measure <b>a <i>tarkav</i>,</b> i.e., a half-<i>se’a</i>, <b>and sat on it,</b> that the vessel <b>should be</b> rendered <b>impure</b> as a seat upon which a <i>zav</i> sat.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> concludes: Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And he who sits on any object whereon</b> the <i>zav</i> <b>sits…and be unclean</b> until the evening” (Leviticus 15:6). The wording of the verse indicates that it is speaking of an object <b>that is designated for sitting,</b> i.e., upon which people generally sit, <b>excluding such</b> a vessel for <b>which we would say to</b> someone sitting on it: <b>Stand up, so we can do our work.</b> A spade and a measuring bowl, then, are not subject to the impurity of the seat of a <i>zav</i>, even if a <i>zav</i> sat on them. Rather, they are considered to be on the lower level of impurity transmitted through simple contact with a <i>zav</i>. The same <i>halakha</i> was applied to the vessels used in preparation of the red heifer; the Sages did not add stringency and decree that a vessel not generally used for sitting should be considered as the seat of a <i>zav</i>.",
            "§ The mishna states: <b>A vessel combines</b> all the food that is in it with regard <b>to sacrificial</b> food <b>but not</b> with regard <b>to <i>teruma</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived?

            "§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>And if</b> the giver <b>says</b> to the priest: <b>I separated</b> and placed <b>into</b> this barrel of <i>teruma</i> <b>a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> <b>of sacrificial</b> wine or oil, <b>he is deemed credible.</b> The Gemara proceeds to cite a mishna in tractate <i>Oholot</i>, the discussion of which ultimately relates to this mishna here: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Oholot</i> 18:4): <b>Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel agree that one may examine</b> the ground <b>for those performing the paschal</b> offering, <b>but one may not examine</b> the ground <b>for those who eat <i>teruma</i>.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of: <b>One may examine? Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: A person may blow</b> at the ground of <b>a <i>beit haperas</i> and walk</b> through it as he does so. A <i>beit haperas</i> is a patch of ground with a grave in it that was subsequently plowed over. The Sages were concerned that there might be small pieces of human bone scattered in the field, which would impart impurity to anyone moving them with his foot. Therefore, they decreed that whoever traverses such a field becomes impure. However, the Sages allowed one to pass through the field while maintaining his purity if he blows on the ground as he goes, the assumption being that any small pieces of bone would thereby be blown out of his path. This is the examination to which this mishna refers. The mishna teaches that this examination is sufficient to allow one to retain his purity as he goes to perform the paschal offering, but not to allow one to retain his purity with regard to the eating of <i>teruma</i>.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said in the name of Ulla: A <i>beit haperas</i> that has been trodden</b> by passersby who have beaten a path through it <b>is</b> considered <b>pure for those who</b> are on their way to <b>perform the paschal</b> offering, as the assumption is that no more bone fragments remain on the surface of the ground. The examination referred to in the mishna, then, is referring to ascertaining whether a particular <i>beit haperas</i> has been trodden or not. The reason for this leniency is that the impure status of a <i>beit haperas</i> is only a rabbinical decree, and the Sages <b>did not uphold their words</b> decreeing the field to be impure <b>in a place</b> where this affects one’s ability to perform a mitzva involving <b><i>karet</i>;</b> and failure to bring a paschal offering is punishable by <i>karet</i>.",
            "However, with regard <b>to those who</b> wish to <b>eat <i>teruma</i></b> after traversing a <i>beit haperas</i>, the Sages <b>did uphold their words</b> decreeing the field to be impure <b>in a place</b> of a sin involving the punishment of <b>death</b> by God’s hand. The sin of eating <i>teruma</i> in a state of impurity is punishable by death by God’s hand, and the Sages were therefore strict in insisting that one not eat it after traversing a <i>beit haperas</i>.",
            "<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the scholars: If <b>one examined a</b> <i>beit haperas</i> <b>for</b> the purpose of bringing <b>his paschal</b> offering, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <i>teruma</i> after he has traversed the field? Is it permissible <b>that he</b> can rely on this examination to <b>eat his <i>teruma</i></b> as well, since his passage through the field has been established as not having defiled him? <b>Ulla said:</b> If he <b>examined</b> the ground <b>for</b> purposes of bringing <b>his paschal</b> offering, <b>he is permitted</b> afterward <b>to eat his <i>teruma</i>,</b> for once he is declared pure with regard to the offerings it would be inconsistent to declare him at the same time impure with regard to <i>teruma</i>. But <b>Rabba bar Ulla said:</b> If one <b>examined</b> the ground <b>for</b> purposes of bringing <b>his paschal</b> offering, it <b>is prohibited</b> for him <b>to eat his <i>teruma</i>.</b>",
            "<b>A certain older man said to</b> Rabba bar Ulla: <b>Do not argue with Ulla, as we learned</b> in the mishna <b>in accordance with his</b> opinion, for the mishna states: <b>And if</b> the <i>am ha’aretz</i> <b>says</b> to the priest: <b>I separated</b> and placed <b>into</b> this barrel of <i>teruma</i> <b>a quarter-</b><i>log</i> of <b>sacrificial</b> wine or oil, <b>he is deemed credible. Apparently, then, once</b> the <i>am ha’aretz</i> <b>is deemed credible</b> with regard to the <b>sacrificial</b> items in the barrel <b>he is also deemed credible</b> with regard to the <b><i>teruma</i></b> in it. <b>Here too,</b> the same principle should be applied, so <b>once he is deemed credible</b> and is considered pure with regard to the <b>paschal</b> offering, <b>he is also deemed credible with regard to <i>teruma</i>.</b>",
            "§ It was taught in the mishna: Concerning <b>jugs of wine and jugs of oil</b> that are mingled, <i>amei ha’aretz</i> are deemed credible during the period of the winepress and the olive press. A Sage <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <i>Amei ha’aretz</i> <b>are not deemed credible, neither with regard to flasks nor with regard to <i>teruma</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Flasks of what?

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> it is referring <b>to empty</b> flasks that had contained <b>sacrificial</b> food <b>during the rest of the days of the year,</b> i.e., during all the days of the year, for an <i>am ha’aretz</i> is deemed credible with regard to sacrificial food throughout the year, yet he is not deemed credible with regard to its flask once the food has been removed, <b>and</b> it is referring as well <b>to</b> flasks <b>full of <i>teruma</i></b> wine <b>during the period of the winepress,</b> when they are deemed credible with regard to the <i>teruma</i> itself, but not the vessels.",
            "The Gemara asks a question: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: With regard to <b>jugs of wine and jugs of oil that are mingled [<i>meduma</i>],</b> <i>amei ha’aretz</i> are deemed credible during the period of the winepress and the olive press, and seventy days before the winepress. The Gemara asks: <b>What, is it not so that mingled</b> means that there is a mixture <b>of <i>teruma</i></b> oil or wine in the jug, and yet the mishna states that <i>amei ha’aretz</i> are deemed credible with regard to the jugs? This would appear to contradict the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> that they are not deemed credible with regard to flasks containing <i>teruma</i>. The Gemara answers: <b>In the school of Rabbi Ḥiyya they say</b> that the mishna in fact is referring to ordinary oil or wine <b>mingled with sacrificial</b> wine or oil, so that it contains a certain amount of sacrificial liquid.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And does</b> the concept of <i>meduma</i> <b>apply to sacrificial</b> foods at all? This term <i>meduma</i> applies only to <i>teruma</i>, not to sacrificial items. In <b>the school of Rabbi Elai they say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of the mishna is stated <b>with regard to one who is keeping his</b> wine <b><i>tevel</i>,</b> i.e., produce from which the requisite <i>teruma</i> and tithes have not yet been separated, <b>in purity,</b> because he intends <b>to take</b> wine for <b>libations from it.</b> It is therefore in a sense a mixture of sacrificial food, <i>teruma</i> and non-sacred food all in one, and accordingly the term <i>meduma</i> is applicable. The mishna is teaching that since the <i>am ha’aretz</i> is deemed credible with regard to the sacrificial food in this mixture, he is also deemed credible with regard to the <i>teruma</i> and the jugs.",
            "§ It is taught in the mishna that apart from the period of the winepress itself, <i>amei ha’aretz</i> are also deemed credible <b>seventy days before</b> the period of <b>the winepress.

For didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 22:1): Concerning <b>a table and a <i>dulpaki</i> that</b> some of its surface <b>became broken off, or that one coated with marble,</b> i.e., stone not being susceptible to impurity: If <b>he left on them a place</b> on the surface that remained unbroken or uncoated, big enough <b>for placing cups, it</b> remains <b>susceptible to impurity</b> as a wooden vessel. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> It must have an unbroken and uncoated <b>place</b> big enough <b>for placing pieces</b> of meat and bread as well in order to maintain susceptibility to impurity as a wooden vessel. It is clear from this mishna that if a table is completely coated with stone it is not susceptible to impurity, showing that the status of a vessel follows its external coating, not its main material. The Temple table, which was coated with gold, should have the status of a metal vessel.",
            "The Gemara proposes a possible answer: <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>acacia wood,</b> from which the Temple table was made, <b>is different, as</b> it is an <b>important,</b> valuable kind of wood <b>and is</b> therefore <b>not nullified</b> by a coating, <b>this works out well according to Reish Lakish, who said: They taught</b> that a wooden vessel is nullified by its coating <b>only with regard to vessels</b> made of cheap <b><i>akhselag</i></b> wood <b>which comes from overseas, but</b> vessels made of expensive <b><i>masmi</i></b> wood <b>are not nullified</b> by a coating. According to this opinion it is <b>fine,</b> for we can say that the acacia wood of the table is also not nullified by its golden coating. <b>But according to Rabbi Yoḥanan, who said: Even</b> expensive <b><i>masmi</i> vessels are also nullified</b> by a coating, <b>what is there to say?</b>",
            "The Gemara proposes another possible answer: <b>And if you would say</b> that the mishna is not applicable because <b>here</b> in the mishna the wood is nullified by its coating because it is speaking <b>of a fixed coating,</b> whereas <b>there</b> in the case of the Temple table the golden <b>coating</b> is <b>not fixed</b> onto the wood, this is impossible. For <b>didn’t Reish Lakish inquire of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> Does this law that vessels follow their coating deal only <b>with a fixed coating or</b> even <b>with a coating that is not fixed?</b> And he asked him further: Does it deal only <b>with</b> a coating <b>that covers the</b> table’s <b>rim</b> as well as the table itself, <b>or</b> even <b>with one that does not cover its rim?</b>",
            "And Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him</b> in response: <b>It is not different</b> if <b>it is a fixed coating and it is not different</b> if <b>it is a coating that is not fixed;</b> and <b>it is not different</b> if the coating <b>covers</b> the table’s <b>rim and it is not different</b> if <b>it does not cover its rim.</b> Therefore, since the coating always determines the status of the vessel, the Temple table, with its gold coating, should be susceptible to impurity. <b>Rather,</b> we must say a different explanation as to why the coating does not make the table susceptible to impurity: The <b>table is different</b>"

            "<b>because the Merciful One called it: “Wood,” as it is written</b> with regard to the table of the shewbread: <b>“The altar, three cubits high, and its length two cubits, was of wood, and so its corners, its length, and its walls were also of wood, and he said to me: This is the table that is before the Lord”</b> (Ezekiel 41:22). This verse indicates that even though the table was coated, its identity as a wooden vessel was preserved, which means that, like all wooden vessels, it would not be susceptible to impurity were it not for the fact that they took it out to show to the pilgrims.",
            "As the Gemara has cited the above verse, it clarifies a puzzling aspect of it: The verse <b>began with the</b> word <b>“altar” and ended with the</b> word <b>“table,”</b> both words describing the same item. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish both say</b> the following exposition: <b>When the Temple is standing the altar atones for a person; now</b> that the Temple has been destroyed, it is <b>a person’s table</b> that <b>atones for him,</b> for his feeding of needy guests atones for his sins.",
            "§ The mishna taught: <b>All the vessels that were in the Temple had second</b> and third substitute vessels, <b>etc.</b> All the vessels that were in the Temple required immersion, apart from the golden altar and the bronze altar, because they are considered like the ground. The Gemara cites the relevant sources: <b>The bronze altar</b> is considered like the ground, <b>as it written</b> concerning this altar: <b>“An altar of earth you shall make for Me”</b> (Exodus 20:21). <b>The golden altar</b> is considered like the ground, <b>as it is written: “The candelabrum and the altars”</b> (Numbers 3:31). The plural word “altars” indicates that <b>the</b> two <b>altars</b> of the Temple, the bronze one and the golden one, <b>are compared to each other,</b> teaching that just as the bronze altar is like the ground in that it cannot contract impurity, the same applies to the golden altar.",
            "§ According to the mishna, Rabbi Eliezer maintains that the altars are pure because they are like the ground, <b>and the Rabbis say:</b> It is <b>because they are coated.</b> The mishna seems to be saying that the Rabbis are offering a different reason for the altars not being susceptible to impurity, namely, that they are coated. The Gemara is puzzled by this: <b>On the contrary, since they are coated</b> with gold or bronze that is a reason that they should <b>contract impurity,</b> as the metal coating makes the entire altar considered as a metal vessel, as stated above, and metal is susceptible to impurity. The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> and emend the mishna text as follows: <b>And the Rabbis</b> disagree with Rabbi Eliezer altogether, and <b>declare</b> the altars <b>to be susceptible to impurity, because they are coated.</b>",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> that our text of the mishna is correct, and we should understand that <b>the Rabbis were saying</b> their statement in response <b>to Rabbi Eliezer: What is your reasoning</b> for stating that the altars are not susceptible to impurity because they are like the ground? Why didn’t you say simply that they are wooden vessels fixed in one place? For that is sufficient reason for them not to be susceptible to impurity. Is it <b>because</b> they <b>are coated</b> with metal, and therefore they would be considered metal vessels rather than wooden ones, and susceptible to impurity, were it not for the fact that they are considered like the ground?",
            "This is a mistake, for the coating is not important, and <b>their coating is nullified</b> and considered subordinate <b>to them,</b> so that they are indeed considered wooden vessels in a fixed place and therefore not susceptible to impurity. Although generally the status of a vessel does follow its coating, the Temple table and its altars are exceptions, as derived from the verse in Ezekiel cited above (41:22). There is therefore no need to mention that they are compared to the ground. Since these altars are made of wood they do not contract impurity, irrespective of whether or not they are attached to the ground.",
            "§ Apropos the coating of the altar, the Gemara cites an Aggadic teaching: <b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> The <b>fire of Gehenna has no power over Torah scholars.</b> This can be derived by <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from the salamander [<i>salamandra</i>],</b> a creature created out of fire and immune to its effects, and whose blood is fireproof: <b>If a salamander, which is</b> merely <b>a product of fire,</b> and nevertheless when <b>one anoints</b> his body <b>with its blood, fire has no power over him, all the more so</b> should fire not have any power over <b>Torah scholars, whose entire bodies are fire, as it is written: “Surely My words are as fire, says the Lord”</b> (Jeremiah 23:29), and the words of Torah become part of the Torah scholars’ very bodies.",
            "<b>Reish Lakish said:</b> The <b>fire of Gehenna has no power over the sinners of Israel</b> either. This can be derived by <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from the golden altar: If the golden altar, which</b> has <b>on it</b> a coating that is <b>no more than the thickness of a gold dinar,</b> and which has incense burning on it <b>for many years</b> and yet <b>fire has no power over it,</b> as the gold miraculously remained undamaged, <b>all the more so</b> should immunity from fire be granted to <b>the sinners of Israel, who are filled with good deeds as a pomegranate</b> is full of seeds, <b>as it is written: “Your temples [<i>rakatekh</i>] are like a pomegranate split open”</b> (Song of Songs 4:3), which is to be expounded as follows: <b>Do not read</b> this word as <b><i>rakatekh</i>, rather</b> read it as <b><i>reikanin shebakh</i>,</b> meaning the empty, worthless people among you; even these people are as full of good deeds as a pomegranate is full of seeds."
