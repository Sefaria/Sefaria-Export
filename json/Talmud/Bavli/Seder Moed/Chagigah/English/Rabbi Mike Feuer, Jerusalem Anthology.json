            "R’ Yehudah said:  there are two firmaments, as it says “Behold, to the Lord, your God, belong the heavens and the heavens of the heavens…” (Devarim 10:14) ", 
            "Reish Lakish said:  there are seven, and they are – vilon, rakiyah, shechakim, zevul, maon, machon, aravot.  Vilon serves no purpose except that it enters in the morning and goes out in the evening, and renews the works of creation each day as it says “…who stretches out the heaven like a curtain, and He spread them out like a tent to dwell.” (Yeshayahu 40:22)  Rakiyah is where the sun, moon, stars and constellations are fixed, as it says “And God placed them in the expanse of the heavens…”(Bereshit 1:17)  Shechakim is where the millstones that grind manna for the righteous stand, as it says “And He had commanded the skies from above, and He had opened the portals of heaven. He had rained upon them manna to eat…” (Tehillim 78:23-24) ", 
            "Zevul is where Jerusalem, the Holy Temple and the altar are built. Micha’el the great prince stands there and offers sacrifices, as it says “I have surely built You a house to dwell in (bet zevul); a settled place for You to dwell in forever.” (Melachim I 8:13)  And from where do we learn that this is called the heavens? As it is written “Look from heaven and see, the dwelling (zevul) of Your holiness and Your glory…” (Yeshayahu 63:15)"
