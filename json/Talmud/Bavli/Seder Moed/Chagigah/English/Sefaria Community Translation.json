These are the words of the house of Shammai. But the house of Hillel say, Anyone who is not able to take hold of his father's hand, and to go up from Jerusalem to the mountain of the House, as it is said, (Exodus 23:14) \"three times.\"",

But according to Ravina, who said,  He who is half a slave and half free is exempt from the \"appearing\", what is the expression \"all\" to include? It is to include one who is lame on the first day and well on the second day.",

Meaning, if one didn't bring the sacrifice on the first day, he can make it up on the second, and if he missed it on the second, he can make it up on the third, etc.]; but according to him who says, All of them can be \"made up\" for the first day only, what does \"all\" include? It is to include one who is blind in one eye.",

And that which is difficult to you because of Ravina [who already says he is exempt],there is no difficulty. Here is according to the older Mishnah, here is according to the later Mishnah.

Just as a mentally ill person and a child are not considered capable of awareness [i.e responsible for their actions], so too a deaf man is not considered capable of awareness [i.e responsible for his actions]. And it is teaching us as we are taught by a Mishnah, The deaf man that the Sages referred to in every place, is one who does not hear and does not speak. Implying, he who speaks and does not hear, or he who hears and does not speak, is obligated [to appear at the Temple during the holidays]?",

Ashi said, Certainly it is, \"in order that they may teach\"; for, if you imagine that it is, \"in order that they may learn,\" then, since he who does not talk does not learn, and since he who does not hear does not learn, this sense of learn comes out of the words, \"in order that they may hear,\"",

How comely are the feet of Israel at the time when they go up for the pilgrimage! \"Prince's daughter\" means the daughter of Abraham our father, who is called prince, as it is said, (Psalms 47:10) \"The princes of the peoples are gathered together to be the people of the God of Abraham.\" \"God of Abraham\" - and not God of Isaac and Jacob?!

It is to tell you, Just as a staff is what direct the heifer in her furrows, so as to produce sustenance for the world, so too the words of the Torah direct the learners of them from paths of death to the paths of life. If you say, that just as a staff is what moves, so the words of the Torah will move; the text teaches \"nails.\" ",
