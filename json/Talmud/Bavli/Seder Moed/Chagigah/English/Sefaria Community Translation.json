These are the words of the house of Shammai. But the house of Hillel say, Anyone who is not able to take hold of his father's hand, and to go up from Jerusalem to the mountain of the House, as it is said, (Exodus 23:14) \"three times.\"",

But according to Ravina, who said,  He who is half a slave and half free is exempt from the \"appearing\", what is the expression \"all\" to include? It is to include one who is lame on the first day and well on the second day.",
            "This agrees with he who says, All of the [days] can be [used as] \"make up\" from one to another [within the holiday. Meaning, if one didn't bring the sacrifice on the first day, he can make it up on the second, and if he missed it on the second, he can make it up on the third, etc.]; but according to him who says, All of them can be \"made up\" for the first day only, what does \"all\" include? It is to include one who is blind in one eye.",

For Yochanan ben Dahabai, in the name of Rabbi Yehudah, taught, He who is blind in one eye is exempt from the \"appearing\", as it is said, (Exodus 23:17) \"He shall be seen\" or \"He shall see.\" As he went to see, so he went to be seen; just as he went to be seen with both eyes, so too to see with both eyes.",

And that which is difficult to you because of Ravina [who already says he is exempt],there is no difficulty. Here is according to the older Mishnah, here is according to the later Mishnah.

Just as a mentally ill person and a child are not considered capable of awareness [i.e responsible for their actions], so too a deaf man is not considered capable of awareness [i.e responsible for his actions]. And it is teaching us as we are taught by a Mishnah, The deaf man that the Sages referred to in every place, is one who does not hear and does not speak. Implying, he who speaks and does not hear, or he who hears and does not speak, is obligated [to appear at the Temple during the holidays]?",

            "Regarding the \"appearing\" there is an exegetical tradition, \"appearing\"/\"appearing\" from the Hakhel Assembly as it is written, (Deuteronomy 31:12) \"Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones,\" and it is written, (Deuteronomy 31:11) \"When all Israel comes to appear.\"",

Ashi said, Certainly it is, \"in order that they may teach\"; for, if you imagine that it is, \"in order that they may learn,\" then, since he who does not talk does not learn, and since he who does not hear does not learn, this sense of learn comes out of the words, \"in order that they may hear,\"",

            "But this \"footgoing times,\" is needed to exempt men with wooden legs! This comes out of \"pe'amim\" [which can be translated both as \"times\" and \"steps\"], for it is taught in a Baraita: \"Pe'amim\" refers not to \"times\" but \"feet\", and so it says, (Isaiah 26:6) \"The foot shall tread it down, the feet of the poor, the feet (\"pe'amei\") of the needy,\" and it says, (Song of Songs 7:2) \"How beautiful are your feet (pa'amech\") in shoes, O prince's daughter!\"",
            "Rava expounded: What is the meaning of that which is written, (Song of Songs 7:2) \"How beautiful are thy steps in shoes, O prince's daughter\"? How comely are the feet of Israel at the time when they go up for the pilgrimage! \"Prince's daughter\" means the daughter of Abraham our father, who is called prince, as it is said, (Psalms 47:10) \"The princes of the peoples are gathered together to be the people of the God of Abraham.\" \"God of Abraham\" - and not God of Isaac and Jacob?!

It is to tell you, Just as a staff is what direct the heifer in her furrows, so as to produce sustenance for the world, so too the words of the Torah direct the learners of them from paths of death to the paths of life. If you say, that just as a staff is what moves, so the words of the Torah will move; the text teaches \"nails.\" ",
            "If you say, that just as a nail is a thing which diminishes and does not add, so too the words of the Torah diminish and do not add, the text teaches \"planted.\" Just as planting is a thing which is fruitful and multiplies, so too the words of the Torah are fruitful and multiply. ‘The masters of assemblies’: these are the disciples of the wise, who sit in manifold assemblies and occupy themselves with the Torah, some pronouncing unclean and others pronouncing clean, some prohibiting and others permitting, some disqualifying and others declaring fit.

Yochanan ben Zakai, who heard from his teacher, and his teacher from his teacher until it was a law transmitted to Moses at Sinai, that Ammon and Moab must give the poor man’s tithe in the Sabbatical year.

It makes sense for one of double gender that this was necessary, for you might have thought that since he has an aspect of masculinity, he should be obligated. We learn from this that he is a case unto himself. But one of doubtful gender, this is a doubt [on our part what the Torah considers him/her]. Is the verse needed to remove that doubt?",

To the exclusion of these who are not fit to go up with all your males.",

            "But I might say, It links [Shavuot] to Sukkot-- Just like Sukkot has make-up [days] for all eight [days afterwards], so to Shavuot has make-up [days] for all eight [days afterwards]? Shmini Atzeret (lit. the eighth [day]) is a holiday in its own right. When do we say that Shmini Atzeret is a holiday in its own right? These words [only apply] regarding <em>PAZA\"R KASHA\"V</em> (acronym for <em>Payis, Zeman, Regel, Korban, Shir, Beracha</em>, meaning the lots [for the bringing of the offerings], the time-[blessing, ie. <em>She'hechiyanu</em>], the holiday['s consideration as a separate holiday], the offering [of the day], the song [of the holiday], [and] the blessing [of the king]).

            "If you [try to] catch a large amount, you have not caught it; if you [try to] catch a small amount, you have caught it. [Thus, one should settle with a day for make-up offerings instead of a week.]",
            "Rather, to what [do we owe] the law? When the Merciful wrote of Sukkot, [It was] to link it to Pesach; just like Pesach requires [staying] overnight [in Jerusalem], so too Sukkot requires [staying] overnight [in Jerusalem].",

The House of Hillel say, \"It does not have a day of slaughtering.\" What [does that mean]? It doesn't have a day of slaughtering at all? No (ie. it does not), because it does not need a day of slaughtering.",

            "We need this statement [that Beit Hillel and Beit Shammai disagree over whether there is a make-up slaughtering day], because if [the Mishnah] only taught us this [second statement regarding the permissibility of bringing certain offering on the festival, we would think that] in this case, the House of Shammai say [that you may not bring elevation offerings], because it is possible to bring them the next day; but here [in the case where the next day is Shabbat], they would agree with the House of Hillel.",
