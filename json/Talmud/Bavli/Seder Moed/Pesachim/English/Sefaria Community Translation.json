And what about what was said about (checking) two rows in a cellar? (This is a case of) a place where Chametz is brought into.  Beit Shamai say the two upermost rows of the wine cellar (require checking).  Beit Hillel say the two outermost rows (require checking).",

            "There were two disciples sitting before Hillel, of whom one was R. Jochanan b. Zakai. According to others, these disciples were sitting before Rabbi, and one of them was R. Jochanan. One said [while studying a Mishnah]: \"Why must the grapes be cut according to the rules of levital cleanliness, while olives may be gathered even according to the rules of levitical defilement?\" The other pupil said: \"Why must the grapes be cut under the rules of levitical cleanliness, while the gathering of olives need not be made under the rules of levitical cleanliness?\" \"I am sure,\" remarked their teacher, \"that this one [who used becoming words] will become a judge in Israel.\" It is said that before many days had elapsed he became a judge in Israel.  There were three priests [discussing the portions of their priestly gifts]; one said: \"Mine was as large as a bean.\" To this the other responded: \"Mine, was as large as an olive.\" The third one said: \"Mine was as large as the tail of a lizard.\" In consequence of that unfit expression, the last was examined as to his fitness to serve upon the altar and they found in him a blemish of descent. Have we not been taught [in a Mishnah] ''No family records are searched beyond the altar\"? [for he was certainly examined before he began serving upon it; hence how was this examination possible?] Do not say a \"blemish of descent,\" but say [they found in him] \"obscenity which made him unworthy of the priesthood.\" And if you please, you may say this instance differs, because he harmed himself by causing the investigation]. There was a gentile that used to go up and eat the Passover sacrifices in Jerusalem. He said: It is written, no stranger [i.e. gentile] should eat from it; no uncircumcised person shall eat from it, but I eat of the very best. R. Judah b. Bathyra said to him: Did they give you a piece from the fatty tail? No, he replied. When you go there tell them to give you some of the tail. When he went up he said to them, Give me from the fatty tail. They said to him: The fatty tail is sacrificed on the altar.  They said to him: Who told you to do this? He said: R. Judah b. Bathyra. They said: What's going on? They did a background check and discovered that he was a gentile and killed him. Then they sent a message to R. Judah b. Bathyra: Peace be with you, R. Judah b. Bathyra, for you are in Netzivin but your net is spread in Jerusalem. When R. Cahana became ill, the Rabbis sent R. Joshua, the son of R. Ide, with instructions to visit him and find out what his condition was. When he came, he found R. Cahana dead. He tore his clothes, then turned them towards his back, and returned weeping. \"Is he dead?\" they asked him. \"You say it, I do not say it,\" was his reply, adding also (Proverbs 10:18) “And he that spreadeth abroad an evil report is a fool.” (Fol. 4) "

The Gemara asks: What is the practical difference between these possibilities? Let him ask the owner of the house.

To a lamp in the presence of a torch. And Raba also said: [To use] a torch for havdalah is the most preferable [way of performing this] duty? — Said R. Nahman b. Isaac: The one can be brought into holes and chinks [in the wall], whereas the other cannot be brought into holes and chinks. R. Zebid said: The one [throws] its light forward, whereas the other [throws] its light behind. R. Papa said: Here [with a torch] one is afraid, whereas there [with a lamp] one is not afraid.
