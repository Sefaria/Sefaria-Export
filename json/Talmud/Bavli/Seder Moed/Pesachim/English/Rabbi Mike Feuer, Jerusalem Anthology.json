Rather: not like Avraham in connection to whom it is written ‘mountain,’ as it says “…as it is said to this day: On the mountain, the Lord will be seen.” (Bereshit 22:14) And not like Yitzchak in connection to whom it is written ‘field,’ as it says “And Yitzchak went out to pray in the field…” (Bereshit 24:63) Rather like Yaakov, whom called it a house, as it says “And he named the place Beth El…” (Bereshit 28:19)"
