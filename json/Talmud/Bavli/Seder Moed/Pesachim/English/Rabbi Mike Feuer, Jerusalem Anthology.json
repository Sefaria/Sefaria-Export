            "And R’ Elazar said: what does it mean “And many peoples shall go, and they shall say, \"Come, let us go up to the Lord's mount, to the house of the God of Yaakov…” (Isaiah 2:3) The God of Yaakov and not the God of Avraham and Yitzchak? Rather: not like Avraham in connection to whom it is written ‘mountain,’ as it says “…as it is said to this day: On the mountain, the Lord will be seen.” (Bereshit 22:14) And not like Yitzchak in connection to whom it is written ‘field,’ as it says “And Yitzchak went out to pray in the field…” (Bereshit 24:63) Rather like Yaakov, whom called it a house, as it says “And he named the place Beth El…” (Bereshit 28:19)"
