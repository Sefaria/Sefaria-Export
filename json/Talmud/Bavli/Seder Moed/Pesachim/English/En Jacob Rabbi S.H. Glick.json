Acha b. Jacob said: \"Sixteen extra letters are used [in order to avoid an unfit word], as it is said (I Sam. 20:26) For he thought something hath befallen him, he is not clean, because he has not yet purified himself [in order to avoid the word impure].\"",

Ishmael, it was taught that a man should always speak in clean language, since the seat of a male zab the passage calls (Lev. 15:9) saddle, and the seat of a female zab the passage calls (Ib.) sitting place. This principle is also supported by the following passage (Job 15:6 ) So that thou choosest the language of the prudent. Also by another passage (Ib. 33, 3) And my lips utter knowledge clearly.",

And if you will say that  this applies only to Rabbinical matters, but for secular affairs any language might be used : Come, Listen to this passage : And my lips utter knowledge clearly."

Bathyra and said to him: \"It is written in your Torah (Ex. 12:43) No stranger shall eat thereof, and again (Ex. 12:48) But no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof; nevertheless, I get to eat of the very best.\"",

Juda said to him: \"The next time you go, ask of them to give thee a piece of the fat of the tail.\" The following year then, when he came to Jerusalem, he said to them: \"Give me a piece of the fat of the tail.\" \"What!\" exclaimed they, \"is not the fat of the tail sacrificed on the altar?",
            "Did anyone advise thee to ask for this?\" they questioned him. And the heathen answered: 'R. Juda b. Bathyra has advised me thus.\" \"What does this mean?\" said they to themselves. Thereupon they made an investigation and, discovering that the man was a gentile, punished him. They then sent a message to R. Juda b. Bathyra, saying: “Peace unto thee R. Juda b. Bathyra, who sitteth in Nizibin, yet whose net is cast in Jerusalem.\"",

            "R. Elazar was in accord with the opinion of the Tanna, Issi b. Juda, who taught: \"Since the Torah says (Exodus 34:24) ‘Yet shall no man desire thy land,’ it is to be implied that the cow shall feed in the pasture and no beast shall harm it, the chicken shall dig in the rubbish and no weasel shall harm it.\" ",
            "Now, can this not be inferred a fortiori? If, regarding the things which are exposed to injury, it is promised that no harm will occur, how much the more so regarding things that are usually not exposed to injury? This conclusion I could only arrive at with reference to protection while on the way to perform [a meritorious act]. Whence, however, do we infer that even on the return, no harm will occur? It is said (Deuteronomy 16:7) ‘And thou shalt turn in the morning and go unto thy tents.’ From this passage we may learn that Thou wilt go and find thy tents in peace. ",
            "Since even on the return [he will meet no evil], wherefore is it necessary to mention [the protection] on the way going to perform the religious duty? We must therefore say this statement is necessary for the reference to what R. Ami said: \"Every man who has land is in duty bound to visit Jerusalem during the festivals, but a man who has no land need not visit Jerusalem during the festivals.\" ",

Lest those who visit Jerusalem during the festivals should say, 'Had we come here merely to enjoy of the Gennesar-fruit: it would have been sufficient.' Hence their visit would become not as a matter of duty.\" ",
            "The same said R. Dastoe b. Janai: \"Why are not the hot springs of Tiberias located in Jerusalem? For the simple reason that those who visit Jerusalem during the festivals, should not say, 'Were it for nothing else than to bathe ourselves in the hot springs of Tiberias that we visited Jerusalem, it would have been sufficient! Thus their visiting Jerusalem would turn out to be not as a matter of duty.\"  "
