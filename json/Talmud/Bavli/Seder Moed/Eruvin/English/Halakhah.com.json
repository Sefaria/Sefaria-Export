            "a place for planting of vineyards.", 
            "R. Jeremiah b. Eleazar further stated: Come and see that human relationship is not like that with the Holy One, blessed be He.  In human relationship when a man is sentenced to death for [an offence against] a government, a hook must be placed in his mouth in order that he shall not [be able to] curse the king, but in the relationship with the Holy One, blessed be He, when a man incurs [the penalty of] death for [an offence against] the Omnipresent he keeps silence, as it is said:", 
            "Towards Thee silence is praise; and he, furthermore, offers praise, for it is stated: ‘praise’; and not only that but he also regards it as if he offered a sacrifice, for it is said in Scripture: And unto Thee the vow is performed.", 
            "This is exactly in line with what R. Joshua b. Levi has said: What [is the meaning of] what is written: Passing through the valley of Baca they make it a place of springs; yea, the early rain clotheth it with blessings,", 
            "‘passing’ is an allusion to men who transgress the will of the Holy One, blessed be He; ‘valley’ [is an allusion to these men] for whom Gehenna is made deep;  ‘of Baca’ [signifies] that they weep and shed tears; ‘they make it a place of springs’, like the constant flow of the altar drains; ‘Yea, the early rain clotheth it with blessings’, they acknowledge the justice of their punishment and declare before Him, ‘Lord of the universe, Thou hast judged well, Thou hast condemned well, and well provided Gehenna for the wicked and Paradise for the righteous’."
