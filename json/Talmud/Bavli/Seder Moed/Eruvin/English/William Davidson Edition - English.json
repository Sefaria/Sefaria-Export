            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If an alleyway is enclosed on three sides with courtyards opening into it from three sides, and the fourth side opens into a public domain, it is prohibited by rabbinic law to carry objects in it on Shabbat. However, carrying in an alleyway under those circumstances is permitted if a cross beam is placed horizontally over the entrance to the alleyway. The mishna teaches that if the cross beam spans the entrance to <b>an alleyway</b> at a <b>height above twenty cubits, one must diminish</b> the height of the cross beam so that it is less than twenty cubits. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He need not</b> diminish it, since the cross beam enables one to carry in the alleyway even at that height.",
            "If the entrance to the alleyway is <b>wider than ten cubits, one must diminish</b> its width. <b>However, if</b> the entrance to the alleyway <b>has the form of a doorway,</b> i.e., two vertical posts on the two sides, and a horizontal beam spanning the space between them, <b>even if it is wider than ten cubits, he need not diminish</b> it, as it is then regarded as an entrance, rather than a breach, even if it is very wide.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there,</b> in tractate <i>Sukka</i>: <b>A <i>sukka</i> that is more than twenty cubits high is unfit, and Rabbi Yehuda deems it fit.</b> The <i>halakhot</i> are similar in substance but differ in formulation, and accordingly the Gemara asks: <b>What is the difference</b> that <b>with regard to a <i>sukka</i></b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> that it is <b>unfit, whereas with regard to an alleyway, it teaches</b> the method of <b>rectification,</b> that one must diminish the height of the cross beam?",
            "The Gemara answers: With regard to <b><i>sukka</i>,</b> since it is a mitzva <b>by Torah law,</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> that it is <b>unfit,</b> as if it is not constructed in the proper manner, no mitzva is fulfilled. Whereas with regard to <b>an alleyway,</b> where the entire prohibition of carrying is only <b>by rabbinic law,</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> the method of <b>rectification,</b> as the cross beam comes only to rectify a rabbinic prohibition, but does not involve a mitzva by Torah law.",
            "The Gemara suggests an alternative explanation: <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>even</b> with regard to matters prohibited <b>by Torah law,</b> it would have been appropriate for the mishna to teach a method of <b>rectification. However,</b> with regard to <b><i>sukka</i>, whose matters are numerous, it categorically teaches</b> that it is <b>unfit.</b> Merely diminishing the height of a <i>sukka</i> is insufficient to render it fit; it must also satisfy requirements governing its size, its walls, and its roofing. Teaching the remedy for each disqualification would have required lengthy elaboration. With regard to <b>an alleyway,</b> however, <b>whose matters are not numerous,</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> the method of <b>rectification.</b> Once the height is diminished, it is permitted to carry in the alleyway.",
            "<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: The Rabbis only derived</b> this <i>halakha</i>, that an opening more than twenty cubits high is not considered an entrance, <b>from the doorway of the Sanctuary,</b> the inner sanctum of the Temple. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda only derived</b> his opinion, that even an opening more than twenty cubits high is considered an entrance, <b>from the doorway of the Entrance Hall</b> leading into the Sanctuary.",
            "<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>The doorway of the Sanctuary is twenty cubits high and ten cubits wide, and that of the Entrance Hall is forty cubits high and twenty cubits wide.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains the basis of this tannaitic dispute. <b>Both of them,</b> the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda, <b>interpreted the same verse homiletically:</b> “And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering <b>and slaughter it at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting,</b> and Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall sprinkle the blood on the altar round about” (Leviticus 3:2). <b>As the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>the sanctity of the Sanctuary is discrete and the sanctity of the Entrance Hall is discrete,</b> i.e., the Sanctuary and the Entrance Hall have distinct levels of sanctity. <b>And</b> since the essence of the Temple is the Sanctuary and not the Entrance Hall, and since the Sanctuary in the Temple parallels the Tent of Meeting in the Tabernacle, <b>when</b> the verse <b>speaks of the doorway of the Tent of Meeting, it is referring to</b> the doorway of <b>the Sanctuary.</b> Therefore, the term doorway applies to an opening similar to the doorway of the Sanctuary, which is twenty cubits high. There is no source indicating that an opening with larger dimensions is also considered a doorway.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>the Sanctuary and the Entrance Hall are one,</b> equal, <b>sanctity, and</b> therefore, <b>when it is written: “The doorway of the Tent of Meeting,” it is referring to both of them,</b> and accordingly, the term doorway applies to a larger entrance as well.",
            "The Gemara suggests an alternative understanding of the dispute. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>even according to Rabbi Yehuda, the sanctity of the Sanctuary is discrete and the sanctity of the Entrance Hall is discrete. And here, this is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda:</b> By fusing together language from different verses, the result is <b>as it is written: To the doorway of the Entrance Hall of the House.</b> Therefore, even the doorway of the Entrance Hall is referred to in the Torah as a doorway, and the same is true of any opening with comparable dimensions.",
            "<b>And the Rabbis</b> say: <b>Had</b> the verse <b>written: “To the doorway of the Entrance Hall,”</b> it would be interpreted <b>as you said.</b> However, <b>now that it is written: “To the doorway of the Entrance Hall of the House,”</b> it is to be understood: To the doorway of <b>the House that opens into the Entrance Hall,</b> i.e., the Sanctuary, and consequently, the definition of doorway is derived from the dimensions of the doorway of the Sanctuary.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty with the very basis of this explanation: <b>But when this is written:</b> “The doorway of the Tent of Meeting,” <b>isn’t it written with regard to the Tabernacle</b> in the wilderness? How can the status in the permanent Sanctuary, i.e., the Temple in Jerusalem, be derived from matters stated with regard to the Tabernacle?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>We find that the Tabernacle is called Temple, and that the Temple is called Tabernacle;</b> therefore, the <i>halakhot</i> that govern one can be derived from the other. <b>As if you do not say so,</b> that the Tabernacle and the Temple are one with regard to their <i>halakhot</i>, <b>that which Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Peace-offerings that were slaughtered</b> in the Temple <b>prior to the opening of the doors of the Sanctuary</b> in the morning <b>are disqualified</b> would be difficult. That <i>halakha</i> is derived <b>as it is stated: “And he shall slaughter it at the doorway [<i>petaḥ</i>] of the Tent of Meeting,”</b> from which it is derived: <b>When</b> the doors to the Tent of Meeting <b>are open [<i>petuḥin</i>], and not when they are closed. But when this is written:</b> The doorway of the Tent of Meeting, <b>isn’t it written with regard to the Tabernacle? Rather,</b> for halakhic purposes, <b>we find the Temple called Tabernacle, and the Tabernacle called Temple.</b>",
            "The Gemara questions its previous conclusion: <b>Granted, the Temple is called Tabernacle, as it is written: “And I will set My Tabernacle among you”</b> (Leviticus 26:11), and the reference is to the permanent Sanctuary, i.e., the Temple, as the verse is referring to that which will transpire after the Jewish people settle in their land. <b>However,</b> the fact that <b>the Tabernacle is called Temple, from where do we</b> derive it? The Gemara answers: <b>If you say</b> that it is derived <b>from that which is written: “And the Kehatites, the bearers of the Temple, set forward, that they may set up the Tabernacle before they came”</b> (Numbers 10:21),"
        ],
        [
            "<b>that</b> instance of the term Temple <b>is</b> not written with regard to the Tabernacle; rather, it is <b>written with regard to the ark</b> and the other sacred objects in the Tabernacle, as the sons of Kehat carried only the sacred vessels and not the Tabernacle itself. <b>Rather,</b> it is derived <b>from here: “And let them make Me a Temple that I may dwell among them”</b> (Exodus 25:8), where the reference is to the Tabernacle.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Both according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis and according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, let them derive</b> the maximum width of a doorway <b>from the doorway of the gate of the courtyard</b> of the Tabernacle. <b>As it is written: “The length of the courtyard shall be one hundred cubits and the breadth fifty everywhere, and the height five cubits”</b> (Exodus 27:18). <b>And it is written: “The hangings on one side of the gate shall be fifteen cubits;</b> their pillars three and their sockets three” (Exodus 27:14). <b>And it is written: “And for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and on that hand, were hangings of fifteen cubits;</b> their pillars three and their sockets three” (Exodus 38:15). If the hangings on both sides of the gate covered thirty of the courtyard’s total width of fifty cubits, apparently, the gate of the courtyard was twenty cubits wide and five cubits high. Therefore, <b>just as there,</b> with regard to the Tabernacle, an entrance <b>five</b> cubits high <b>by twenty</b> cubits <b>wide</b> is considered a doorway, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>eiruv</i>, an entrance <b>five</b> cubits high <b>by twenty</b> cubits <b>wide</b> should be considered a doorway.",
            "The Gemara rejects this assertion: There is no proof from there, as that entrance <b>is called the doorway of the gate of the courtyard,</b> but <b>it is not called a doorway, unmodified.</b> Consequently, the dimensions of a doorway mentioned without qualification cannot be derived from that doorway.",
            "The Gemara offers an alternative answer: <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>when it is written: “The hangings on one side of the gate shall be fifteen cubits,”</b> it is referring <b>to the height</b> of the hangings. The width of the hangings, however, is not specified in the Torah at all, and therefore the width of the doorway of the gate of the courtyard is unknown.",
            "The Gemara raises an objection: Could it be that the <b>height</b> of the hangings was fifteen cubits? <b>Isn’t it written</b> explicitly in the verse: <b>“And the height five cubits”?</b> The Gemara answers: The verse is stating that the height of the hangings was five cubits, measured <b>from the edge of the altar and above.</b> The altar itself was ten cubits high, while the hangings of the courtyard were fifteen cubits high, five cubits higher than the altar.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Did Rabbi Yehuda</b> actually <b>derive</b> his opinion <b>from the doorway of the Entrance Hall? But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that if the entrance to an alleyway is <b>wider than ten cubits, one must diminish</b> its width? <b>And Rabbi Yehuda does not dispute</b> this ruling. Wasn’t the doorway of the Entrance Hall wider than ten cubits?",
            "<b>Abaye said:</b> In fact, Rabbi Yehuda <b>disagrees</b> with the unattributed opinion of the first <i>tanna</i> <b>in a <i>baraita</i>. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If the entrance to an alleyway is <b>wider than ten cubits, he must diminish</b> its width; <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> disagrees and <b>says: He need not diminish it.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks further: If so, <b>let him disagree in the mishna.</b> Why is Rabbi Yehuda’s dispute cited only in the <i>baraita</i>, and not in the mishna? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yehuda <b>disagrees</b> in the mishna <b>with regard to</b> an entrance’s <b>height, but the same applies to its width.</b> His statement: He need not reduce it, is referring both to the entrance’s height and to its width.",
            "The Gemara poses a question: <b>And still,</b> is it possible that <b>Rabbi Yehuda derived</b> his opinion <b>from the doorway of the Entrance Hall? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a cross beam spanning the entrance to <b>an alleyway that is higher than twenty cubits, one must diminish</b> its height; <b>and Rabbi Yehuda deems it fit up to forty and fifty cubits. And</b> in a different <i>baraita</i>, <b>bar Kappara taught</b> the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda: It is fit <b>up to a hundred</b> cubits.",
            "The Gemara clarifies its question: <b>Granted, according to bar Kappara,</b> the phrase: Up to a hundred, can be understood as <b>an exaggeration,</b> not as an exact number. All that Rabbi Yehuda meant to say is that it is permitted to carry in the alleyway even if the cross beam is significantly higher than twenty cubits. <b>However, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yehuda</b> in the name of Rav, <b>what exaggeration</b> is there? He certainly meant precisely what he said. <b>Granted,</b> with regard to <b>forty</b> cubits, <b>Rabbi Yehuda derived</b> it <b>from the doorway of the Entrance Hall. However,</b> with regard to <b>fifty</b> cubits, <b>from where does he derive</b> it? Apparently, Rabbi Yehuda did not derive the dimensions of an entrance from the doorway of the Entrance Hall. He derived them from a different source.",
            "<b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> It was <b>this <i>baraita</i></b> that <b>misled Rav</b> and led him to explain that Rabbi Yehuda derived the measurements of an entrance from the doorway of the Entrance Hall. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a cross beam spanning the entrance to <b>an alleyway that is higher than twenty cubits, higher than the doorway of the Sanctuary, one must diminish</b> its height. Rav <b>maintains: From</b> the fact <b>that the Rabbis derived</b> the dimensions of an entrance <b>from the doorway of the Sanctuary, Rabbi Yehuda</b> must have <b>derived</b> those dimensions <b>from the doorway of the Entrance Hall. But that is not so.</b> Rather, <b>Rabbi Yehuda derived</b> the dimensions of an entrance <b>from the entrance of kings,</b> whose regular practice was to erect their entrances exceedingly high and wide.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And,</b> according to <b>the Rabbis, if they derived</b> their opinion <b>from the doorway of the Sanctuary, let them require doors</b> in order to render an alleyway fit for one to carry within it, <b>just as</b> there were doors in <b>the Sanctuary. Why</b> then <b>did we learn</b> in the mishna: With regard to the method of <b>rendering an alleyway fit</b> for carrying within it, <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> Both <b>a side post</b> placed adjacent to one of the sides of the alleyway’s entrance <b>and a</b> cross <b>beam</b> over the entrance to the alleyway are required. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> Either <b>a side post or a</b> cross <b>beam</b> is sufficient. However, not even according to the more stringent opinion of Beit Shammai are doors required.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>The Sanctuary doors were made solely for</b> the purpose of <b>privacy,</b> but served no practical function. The doorway of the Sanctuary did not require doors to be considered an entrance. It was a full-fledged entrance even without them.",
            "The Gemara raises another question: <b>But if so,</b> that the Rabbis derive their opinion from the entrance to the Sanctuary, <b>the form of a doorway,</b> i.e., two vertical posts on the two sides, with a horizontal cross beam spanning the space between them, <b>should not be effective</b> if the alleyway is more than ten cubits wide, <b>as the Sanctuary had the form of a doorway, and even so, it was</b> no more than <b>ten cubits wide. Why</b> then <b>did we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>If</b> the entrance <b>has the form of a doorway,</b> then <b>even if it is wider than ten cubits, he need not diminish</b> its width?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>As that is the reason only according to Rav,</b> who holds that the Rabbis derive their opinion from the doorway of the Sanctuary. <b>Didn’t Rav Yehuda teach</b> this mishna to <b>Ḥiyya bar Rav before Rav,</b> saying that if the entrance had the form of a doorway <b>he need not diminish it, and Rav said to him</b> to <b>teach</b> a different version: <b>He must diminish it.</b> Apparently, according to Rav himself, the form of a doorway does not render it permitted to carry within the alleyway if its entrance is wider than the doorway of the Sanctuary, and therefore the question about the form of a doorway poses no difficulty to his opinion.",
            "The Gemara raises an additional difficulty: <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>a</b> molded or protruding <b>cornice [<i>amaltera</i>]</b> crowning the entrance <b>should not be effective</b> in rendering an alleyway fit to carry within it if it is higher than twenty cubits, <b>as the Sanctuary had a cornice, and even so</b> it was <b>twenty cubits high,</b> and no more. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Over it were five oak cornices, one</b> protruding <b>above the other.</b>",
            "The Gemara attempts to dismiss this difficulty: <b>And,</b> with regard to <b>that</b> mishna, <b>what is the refutation? Perhaps when that</b> mishna <b>with regard to cornices was taught, it was taught with regard to the Entrance Hall,</b> whose height was forty cubits, and not with regard to the Sanctuary.",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>And what is the difficulty</b> with <b>that? Perhaps the design of the Sanctuary was like the design of the Entrance Hall.</b> Just as there were cornices in one doorway, there were cornices in the other.",
            "The Gemara returns to its question with regard to a cornice: <b>Why</b> then <b>did Rabbi Ile’a say</b> that <b>Rav</b> himself <b>said:</b> If the <b>width</b> of a cross beam is <b>four</b> handbreadths, <b>even if it is not sturdy,</b> it renders the alleyway fit for carrying within it. <b>And if it has a cornice, even if it is higher than twenty cubits, one need not diminish</b> its height.",
            "<b>Rav Yosef said:</b> This <i>halakha</i> with regard to a <b>cornice</b> was not actually stated by Rav, but rather it <b>is a <i>baraita</i>. Who,</b> in fact, <b>teaches</b> that <i>baraita</i>? Perhaps it is not an authoritative <i>baraita</i>, and Rav does not have to accept what it says.",
            "<b>Abaye said: Isn’t it Ḥama, son of Rabba bar Avuh, who teaches it? And</b> therefore, even if the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a <b>cornice will be a <i>baraita</i>, it</b> nevertheless <b>poses a difficulty to Rav.</b>",
            "<b>Rav</b> could have <b>said to you:</b> Even if you <b>eliminate me</b> and my explanation <b>from</b> the discussion <b>here, don’t the</b> two <b><i>baraitot</i></b> themselves, the <i>baraita</i> that states that the Rabbis derive the dimensions of an entrance from the doorway of the Sanctuary and the <i>baraita</i> that states that in the case of a cornice, even if it is higher than twenty cubits, it need not be lowered, <b>contradict each other? Rather, what have you to say</b> to reconcile the contradiction? The matter is the subject of a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>; so too, according to my</b> opinion, it <b>is</b> the subject of a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Without Rav, the <i>baraitot</i> do not contradict each other,</b> as <b>according to the Rabbis, what is the reason</b> that <b>a</b> cross <b>beam</b> renders an alleyway fit for carrying? Because it serves <b>as a conspicuous marker</b> between the alleyway and the public domain. Ordinarily a cross beam more than twenty cubits high is not noticeable; however, a cornice attracts attention even at that height. <b>And that which is taught</b> in the other <i>baraita</i> with regard to the height of a beam at the entrance to an alleyway: <b>Greater than the entrance of the Sanctuary,</b> is <b>merely</b> a <b>mnemonic</b> device. No actual <i>halakhot</i> are derived from the entrance of the Sanctuary.",
            "The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> that the explanation of <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak works out well if he does not hold this</b> opinion <b>of Rabba; however, if he holds this</b> opinion <b>of Rabba,</b> it is difficult. As <b>Rabba said</b> with regard to the fitness of a <i>sukka</i> whose roofing is higher than twenty cubits that <b>it is written: “In order that your generations should know that I made</b> the children of Israel <b>dwell in booths</b> when I brought them out of the land of Egypt; I am the Lord your God” (Leviticus 23:43). When the roofing of a <i>sukka</i> is <b>up to twenty cubits</b> high, <b>a person is aware that he is dwelling in a <i>sukka</i>;</b> however, when the roofing of the <i>sukka</i> is <b>above twenty cubits, a person is not aware</b> that he is dwelling in a <i>sukka</i>, <b>because the eye does not discern</b> the <i>sukka</i> roofing. One does not usually raise his head to look that high, and consequently, he sees the walls and does not notice the defining feature of the <i>sukka</i>, its roofing.",
            "The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>Apparently, with regard to <i>sukka</i> as well,</b> the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda <b>disagree</b> whether or not an item more than twenty cubits high is <b>conspicuous.</b> According to Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak, <b>why do I</b> need them to <b>disagree</b> about the same point <b>in two cases,</b> that of <i>sukka</i> and that of an alleyway? That the dispute between the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda with regard to <i>sukka</i> revolves around this issue indicates that their dispute with regard to an alleyway revolves around a different point, as asserted by Rav.",
            "The Gemara answers: It is <b>necessary</b> to teach both disputes, <b>as had</b> the mishna <b>taught us</b> only <b>with regard to <i>sukka</i>,</b> one might have thought that only <b>in this</b> case does <b>Rabbi Yehuda say</b> that an object is conspicuous even above twenty cubits; <b>since</b> a <i>sukka</i> <b>is designed for</b> extended <b>dwelling, the eye</b> undoubtedly <b>discerns</b> the roofing at some point. <b>However,</b> in the case of <b>an alleyway,</b> which <b>is designed for walking, say</b> that <b>he concedes to</b> the <b>Rabbis</b> that a person walking in an alleyway does not notice objects at so significant a height. <b>And had</b> the mishna <b>taught us</b> only <b>with regard to that</b> case of an alleyway, one might have thought that only <b>in that</b> case do <b>the Rabbis say</b> that people do not notice objects at so significant a height; <b>however, in that</b> case of <i>sukka</i>, <b>say</b> that <b>they concede to Rabbi Yehuda,</b> for the above-stated reason. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to teach both disputes.",
            "The Gemara seeks to arrive at a precise definition of <i>amaltera</i>, translated above as cornice. <b>What</b> is <b>an <i>amaltera</i>? Rav Ḥama, son of Rabba bar Avuh, said:</b> It refers to decorative wood carvings in the shape of <b>birds’ nests. When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said</b> that <b>they say in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, it is referring to <b>cedar poles.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>The one who said</b> that <i>amaltera</i> refers to <b>cedar poles</b> would <b>all the more so</b> permit use of carvings of <b>birds’ nests,</b> as a cross beam engraved with images attracts attention and is noticeable even at a great height. However, <b>the one who said</b> that <i>amaltera</i> refers to carvings of <b>birds’ nests</b> would say that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a cornice applies only to them, <b>but not to cedar poles.</b>",
            "The Gemara clarifies the opinion of <b>the one who said cedar poles. What is</b> the <b>reason</b> for his opinion? He holds that <b>since its length is great,</b> a cedar pole attracts attention. <b>But isn’t the length of a <i>sukka</i> great</b> as well, <b>and</b> nevertheless, <b>the Rabbis say that</b> a <i>sukka</i> higher than twenty cubits is <b>not</b> fit?",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the reason is as follows: <b>Since</b> a cedar pole <b>is</b> of <b>significant</b> value, <b>it</b> generates <b>publicity.</b> People passing through an alleyway stop and stare at a cross beam of that kind, even when it is higher than twenty cubits, leading others to do so as well.",
            "The Gemara raises a question: If <b>part of the</b> cross <b>beam</b> of an alleyway is <b>within twenty</b> cubits of the ground, <b>and part of the</b> cross <b>beam</b> is <b>above twenty</b> cubits, and similarly, if <b>part of the roofing</b> of a <i>sukka</i> is <b>within twenty</b> cubits, <b>and part of the roofing</b> is <b>above twenty</b> cubits, what is its legal status? <b>Rabba said: In</b> the case of <b>an alleyway, it is fit; in</b> the case of <b>a <i>sukka</i>, it is unfit.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is different in</b> the case of <b>an alleyway</b> that the ruling is <b>that it is fit?</b> It is because <b>we say: Thin</b> the part of the cross beam that is beyond twenty cubits, i.e., consider it as if it were not there. If so, in the case of <b><i>sukka</i> too, say: Thin</b> the roofing that is beyond twenty cubits.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>If you thin</b> the roofing beyond twenty cubits, <b>it will result in</b> a <i>sukka</i> <b>whose sun is more than its shade.</b> Were the section of the roofing above twenty cubits removed, the roofing that remained would not provide sufficient shade for the <i>sukka</i>.",

            "<b>As the Master said:</b> The Holy <b>Ark</b> in the Tabernacle was <b>nine</b> handbreadths high, as the verse states that its height was a cubit and a half.

Apparently, a partition of ten handbreadths creates a separate domain.",
            "The Gemara answers: The <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai <b>is necessary only</b> according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who said: The cubit</b> mentioned with regard to <b>the building</b> of the Tabernacle and the Temple <b>was a</b> large <b>cubit of six</b> handbreadths, whereas <b>the cubit</b> mentioned with regard to the sacred <b>vessels was a cubit of five</b> handbreadths. According to this opinion, the Ark, which was a cubit and a half, and its cover, which was a handbreadth, measured eight and a half handbreadths. Therefore, nothing can be derived with regard to a partition of ten handbreadths.",
            "The Gemara poses a question. <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who said: All the cubits were medium</b> ones, regular cubits of six handbreadths; <b>what can be said?</b> Apparently, according to his opinion, the laws governing partitions are explicitly stated in the Torah.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a partition of ten handbreadths is indeed written in the Torah. However, the <b><i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai <b>comes</b> to teach other <i>halakhot</i> concerning partitions, e.g., the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>extending</b> [<b><i>gode</i>],</b> according to which an existing partition is extended upward or downward to complete the requisite measure; <b>and</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>joining [<i>lavud</i>],</b> according to which two solid surfaces are joined if they are separated by a gap of less than three handbreadths; <b>and</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>the curved wall</b> of a <i>sukka</i>.

            "The Gemara considers a new case: If the cross beam spanning the entrance to an alleyway <b>was less than ten handbreadths</b> above the ground, <b>and one hollowed out</b> the ground under the cross beam in order <b>to complete</b> the distance from the ground to the cross beam <b>to ten, how much must he hollow out?</b> The Gemara is surprised by the question: <b>How much must he hollow out?

            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that</b> these <i>amora’im</i> <b>disagree with regard to</b> the ruling of <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi.

The Gemara proposes that <b>Rav Yosef,</b> who says that the hollowed-out area need only extend four handbreadths, <b>adopts</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ami,</b> whereas <b>Abaye,</b> who requires a hollowed-out area of four cubits, <b>does not adopt</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ami.</b>",
            "The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Abaye</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that the two cases are not comparable: <b>There,</b> in Rav Ami’s case, we are dealing with <b>the final</b> stage <b>of an alleyway,</b> i.e., an alleyway that had at first been properly structured, and only later did it become breached. <b>Here,</b> we are dealing with <b>the initial</b> stage <b>of an alleyway,</b> i.e., an alleyway that from the very outset did not fulfill the necessary conditions. In this case: <b>If there are four cubits</b> in the hollowed-out area, <b>yes,</b> it is considered an alleyway, and <b>if not, no,</b> it is not considered an alleyway.",
            "<b>Abaye said: From where do I say</b> that a length of at least four cubits is required? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>An alleyway is permitted by means of a side post or</b> cross <b>beam only if it has</b> both <b>houses</b> opening into courtyards <b>and courtyards opening into it,</b> as only in that case can it be called an alleyway.",
            "<b>And if</b> the entire length of the alleyway is only <b>four</b> handbreadths, as is indicated by Rav Yosef’s opinion, <b>how can you find this</b> case?

Consequently, argues Abaye, a length of at least four cubits is required.",
            "<b>And Rav Yosef,</b> how would he respond to this? Rav Yosef explains that the <i>baraita</i> is dealing with a case <b>where</b> the courtyards <b>open</b> into the alleyway <b>at its corners.</b> In this way it is possible to have two openings, each of which is at least four handbreadths wide, although the length of the alleyway itself is no greater than four handbreadths, as the four handbreadths of the openings to the courtyards are divided between the width and the length of the alleyway.",
            "<b>Abaye</b> further <b>said: From where do I say</b> that a length of at least four cubits is required? <b>As Rami bar Ḥama said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said:</b> With regard to <b>a side post that protrudes from the wall</b> on the side <b>of an alleyway</b> into the opening of the alleyway, if its protrusion was <b>less than four cubits, it is deemed a side post</b> that renders it permitted to carry in the alleyway, <b>and no other side post is required to render it permitted</b> to carry in it.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And Rav Yosef,</b> how would he respond to this?

            "The Gemara poses a question: <b>That side post,</b> which is added in order to permit carrying within the alleyway that was formed by the four-cubit side post, <b>where does one position it</b> such that one may carry within the alleyway? The Gemara clarifies its difficulty: <b>If one positions it alongside</b> the first side post as an addition to it, it looks as if <b>he is</b> merely <b>extending</b> the original side post, and it is not noticeable that an extra side post is present.",
            "<b>Rav Pappa said: He should position it,</b> the extra side post, <b>on the other side</b> of the alleyway, near the opposite wall. <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: Even if you say that he positions it alongside</b> the first side post, it is valid, so long as <b>he adds to it or diminishes from it</b> in thickness or height, so that it will be noticeable that it is a side post of its own.",
            "The Gemara limits the application of Rami bar Ḥama’s ruling: <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: We stated</b> this halakha with regard to a side post protruding four cubits into the alleyway <b>only in</b> the case of <b>an alleyway</b> that is at least <b>eight</b> cubits wide. <b>However, in</b> the case of <b>an alleyway</b> that is only <b>seven</b> cubits wide, it is <b>permitted</b> to carry within the alleyway without an additional side post, not because the original side post functions as a side post but rather because it sufficiently seals off the entrance to the alleyway such that the <b>standing</b> segment <b>is greater than the breached</b> segment. The alleyway is now closed off from all four sides, and the remaining opening to the public domain is regarded as an entrance, as most of that side is closed and only a small part of it is open.",
            "<b>And</b> this is derived by means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i> inference from a courtyard: Just as</b> in <b>a courtyard, which is not</b> rendered a <b>permitted</b> domain <b>by</b> means of <b>a side post or a</b> cross <b>beam,</b> but actual partitions are required, it <b>is</b> nevertheless rendered a <b>permitted</b> domain even if there are gaps in the partitions, as long <b>as the standing</b> segment <b>is greater than the breached</b> segment in <b>an alleyway,</b> with regard to which the Sages were lenient, <b>as</b> it <b>is</b> rendered a <b>permitted</b> domain <b>by</b> means of <b>a side post or a</b> cross <b>beam, is it not right</b> that it <b>is</b> rendered a <b>permitted</b> domain <b>when the standing</b> segment of the partition is <b>greater than the breached</b> segment?",
            "The Gemara refutes this <i>a fortiori</i> inference that was based on the fact that the legal status of a courtyard is more lenient than that of an alleyway, as it is in fact more stringent than that of an alleyway in at least one respect.

            "<b>They raised a dilemma before Rav Anan</b> with regard to this issue: <b>Need</b> the door <b>be locked or need</b> it <b>not be locked? He said to them: Come</b> and <b>see these</b> city <b>entrances of Neharde’a</b> that open on two opposite sides into the public domain, the gateways of <b>which were filled up halfway with earth,</b> so that the doors themselves could not possibly be locked. <b>Mar Shmuel</b> regularly <b>goes in and out</b> through them, <b>but has never said anything to</b> the people of Neharde’a about them. This shows that it is not necessary for the doors to be locked.",
            "<b>Rav Kahana</b> rejected this proof and <b>said: Those</b> doors in Neharde’a <b>were</b> partially <b>blocked,</b> and therefore there was no need to lock them, but in general, the door of an alleyway that opens on both sides into the public domain must be locked.",
            "The Gemara relates that <b>when Rav Naḥman came</b> to Neharde’a, <b>he said: Clear away the earth,</b> so that the doors can be locked. The Gemara attempts to understand Rav Naḥman’s instruction: <b>Let us say that Rav Naḥman holds</b> that the door of an alleyway that is open on two opposite sides <b>must be locked.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> this is not proof. In order for carrying to be permitted in such an alleyway, it is enough that the doors <b>be fit to be locked, even if they are not</b> actually <b>locked.</b>",
            "The Gemara describes <b>a certain crooked,</b> L-shaped <b>alleyway that was in Neharde’a, upon which they imposed the stringency of Rav and the stringency of Shmuel, and required it</b> to have <b>doors.</b> The Gemara attempts to understand this ruling: <b>The stringency of Rav,</b> namely, that <b>which he said,</b> that an L-shaped alleyway <b>is regarded like</b> an alleyway that is <b>open</b> on two opposite sides. <b>But</b> this is difficult, for <b>didn’t Rav say</b> that <b>the law follows the</b> anonymous <b>first <i>tanna</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i>, who says that even an open alleyway itself does not require doors, and that an opening in the form of a doorway suffices?",
            "The Gemara answers: They required doors <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel, who said</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Ḥananya.

The Gemara explains: The doors were required <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, who said</b> that an L-shaped alleyway <b>is regarded like</b> an alleyway that is <b>open</b> on two opposite sides. Therefore, they adopted the stringencies of both Rav and Shmuel: Rav’s stringency that an L-shaped alleyway is deemed an open alleyway, and Shmuel’s stringency that an open alleyway requires a door.",
            "The Gemara poses a question: <b>But do we adopt the</b> respective <b>stringencies of two</b> authorities who disagree on a series of issues? <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b><i>halakha</i> is always in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel, but one who wishes to act in accordance with the opinion of Beit Shammai may do so,</b> and one who wishes to act <b>in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel may do so.</b> If he wishes to adopt both <b>the leniencies of Beit Shammai and</b> also <b>the leniencies of Beit Hillel,</b> he is <b>a wicked person.</b> And if he wishes to adopt both <b>the stringencies of Beit Shammai and</b> also <b>the stringencies of Beit Hillel, with regard to him the verse states: “The fool walks in darkness”</b> (Ecclesiastes 2:14). <b>Rather,</b> he should act <b>either in accordance with Beit Shammai,</b> following both <b>their leniencies and their stringencies, or in accordance with Beit Hillel,</b> following both <b>their leniencies and their stringencies.</b>",
            "The Gemara first raises a problem concerning the wording of the <i>baraita</i>: The <i>baraita</i> <b>is itself difficult</b> to understand, because it contains an internal contradiction between its clauses: <b>You</b> first <b>said</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i> is always in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel, and then you reversed</b> that and <b>said</b> that <b>one who wishes to act in accordance with the view of Beit Shammai may do so.</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> the <i>baraita’s</i> statement that a person may act as he wishes was made <b>before the Divine Voice</b> emerged and announced that the <i>halakha</i> is always in accordance with Beit Hillel; and <b>here,</b> the statement that the <i>halakha</i> is always in accordance with Beit Hillel was made <b>after the Divine Voice</b> issued this ruling.",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> a different answer: Both <b>this</b> statement <b>and that</b> statement were made <b>after the Divine Voice</b> announced that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with Beit Hillel,"
        ],
        [
            "<b>and</b> the latter statement <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua, who does not pay attention to a Divine Voice</b> that attempts to intervene in matters of <i>halakha</i>, for according to him, the dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel has not yet been decided.",
            "The Gemara suggests yet another resolution: <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>this is</b> what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: Wherever you find two <i>tanna’im</i> or two <i>amora’im</i> who disagree with each other in the manner of the disputes between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, one should not act either in accordance with the leniency of the</b> one <b>Master and in accordance with the leniency of</b> the other <b>Master,</b> nor should one act <b>in accordance with the stringency of</b> the one <b>Master and in accordance with the stringency of</b> the other <b>Master.

            "All of this is suggested to explain the wording of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>In any case, it is difficult</b> to explain the law with regard to the alleyway in Neharde’a, concerning which they simultaneously adopted the stringencies of both Rav and Shmuel.",
            "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> In fact, <b>they acted entirely in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav,</b> and the reason that they required doors and did not rely on the opening in the form of a doorway alone is due to that <b>which Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> This is the <b><i>halakha</i>; however, a</b> public <b>ruling is not issued to that effect</b> <i>ab initio</i>. Although Rav maintains that an opening in the form of a doorway is sufficient in an open alleyway, a public ruling is not issued to that effect; rather, the ruling is stringent, in accordance with Ḥananya’s position, and requires doors.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the statement of <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava</b> that <b>Rav said, as</b> Rav Adda bar Ahava <b>said</b> that Rav said with regard to the same issue: This is the <b><i>halakha</i> and a</b> public <b>ruling is issued to that effect, what can be said?</b> Why did the residents of Neharde’a adopt the stringencies of the two authorities?",
            "<b>Rav Sheizvi said:</b> The principle of dictating <b>when we do not act in accordance with the stringencies of two</b> authorities applies only in a case <b>where</b> the two stringencies <b>contradict one another.</b> In these types of cases, following both stringencies would result in an internal contradiction.",
            "The Gemara illustrates this principle with <b>an example</b> from the laws governing <b>the spine and skull. As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>The spine and the skull</b> of a corpse that are <b>incomplete</b> do not impart ritual impurity via a tent as a corpse would; rather, they impart impurity only through contact or if they are carried as individual bones. This basic law was unanimously accepted, but the details were the subject of dispute: <b>How much</b> is considered <b>a deficiency in the spine</b> for this purpose? <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> If it is missing <b>two vertebrae, and Beit Hillel say:</b> Even if it is missing only <b>one vertebra. And</b> similarly, they argued over the deficiency <b>in the skull: Beit Shammai say:</b> It must be missing piece the <b>size of a drill hole, and Beit Hillel say:</b> It must be missing an amount that, <b>when removed from a living</b> person, would cause him <b>to die,</b> which is a larger amount.",
            "<b>And Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel argued <b>likewise with respect to a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> a kosher animal suffering from a wound or illness that will cause it to die within twelve months, and which is prohibited to be eaten even after the required ritual slaughter. Beit Shammai say that an animal is regarded as a <i>tereifa</i> if it is missing two vertebrae, while Beit Hillel hold that it is a <i>tereifa</i> if it lacks even one. In such a situation, a person must not be stringent with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>tereifa</i> in accordance with the view of Beit Hillel, and at the same time be stringent with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity of a corpse in accordance with the view of Beit Shammai, for the two disputes relate to the same issue, and one must not act in accordance with two contradictory opinions.",
            "Rav Sheizvi continues: <b>However, in a case where</b> the two stringencies <b>do not contradict one another, we may</b> indeed <b>act</b> in accordance with the stringencies of two authorities. Therefore, the stringencies adopted in the case of the alleyway in Neharde’a were legitimate, for the two stringencies related to two separate issues: Rav’s stringency was that an L-shaped alleyway is regarded like an open alleyway, and Shmuel’s stringency was that an open alleyway requires a door.",
            "The Gemara challenges Rav Sheizvi’s assertion: Is it true that <b>we do not act</b> in accordance with the stringencies of two authorities in a case <b>where</b> the two stringencies <b>contradict one another? Rav Mesharshiya raised an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident involving Rabbi Akiva, who gathered</b> the fruit of <b>a citron</b> tree <b>on the first of</b> the month of <b>Shevat and applied</b> the laws of <b>two tithes to it.</b> After <i>teruma</i> and the first tithe have been separated, an additional tithe is separated from what is left. During the first, second, fourth, and fifth years of the Sabbatical cycle, second tithe is set aside to be taken to Jerusalem and eaten there by its owner, while during the third and sixth years, poor man’s tithe is set aside to be distributed to the needy. When tithing the fruit picked on the first of Shevat, Rabbi Akiva set aside both additional tithes, second tithe and poor man’s tithe: He set aside <b>one in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai,</b> who say that the new year for trees begins on the first of Shevat, and as that day belongs to the new year, a tithe must be set aside in accordance with the law of that year; and he set aside <b>one in accordance with the statement of Beit Hillel,</b> that the new year for trees is the fifteenth of Shevat, and any fruit picked prior to that date must be tithed in accordance with the law of the previous year. Apparently, Rabbi Akiva adopted for himself two contradictory stringencies.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> did not act in this way in order to be stringent in accordance with both opinions, but because <b>he was in doubt with regard to his tradition and did not know whether Beit Hillel said</b> the New Year for trees falls <b>on the first of Shevat or on the fifteenth of Shevat, and</b> therefore <b>he acted stringently here and stringently there.</b>",
            "The Gemara resumes its discussion of alleyways that are open on two opposite sides. <b>Rav Yosef sat before Rav Huna, and he sat and said: Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: The dispute</b> between the anonymous first <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> and Ḥananya refers <b>to</b> a case where there is <b>a main street [<i>seratya</i>] from here,</b> on one side of the alleyway, <b>and a main street from here,</b> on the other side. <b>Alternatively,</b> it refers to a case where there is <b>a plaza [<i>pelatya</i>] from here,</b> on one side of the alleyway, <b>and a plaza from here,</b> on the other side.",
            "<b>But</b> if there is <b>a main street from here,</b> on one side, <b>and a valley from here,</b> on the other side, a valley being a <i>karmelit</i>, which is neither a public domain nor a private domain, in which carrying is prohibited on Shabbat by rabbinic decree, <b>or</b> if there is <b>a valley from here,</b> on one side, <b>and a valley from here,</b> on the other side, <b>one constructs</b> an opening in the <b>form of a doorway from here,</b> on one side of the alleyway, <b>and</b> places <b>a side post or a</b> cross <b>beam from here,</b> on the other side. One is thereby permitted to carry in the alleyway even according to the opinion of Ḥananya.",
            "The Gemara raises a question about this ruling: <b>Now,</b> if you say that where there is <b>a main street from here,</b> on one side of the alleyway, <b>and a valley from here,</b> on the other side, it is sufficient to <b>construct</b> an opening in <b>the form of a doorway from here,</b> on one side, <b>and a side post or a</b> cross <b>beam from here,</b> on the other side, <b>was it necessary</b> to state that these are sufficient if there is <b>a valley from here,</b> on one side of the alleyway, <b>and a valley from her</b>e, on the other side?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>This is</b> what <b>he</b> intended <b>to say:</b> If there is <b>a main street from here,</b> on one side, <b>and a valley from here,</b> on the other side, <b>it is considered as if there were a valley from here,</b> on one side, <b>and a valley from here,</b> on the other side.",
            "The Gemara continues: <b>And</b> when Rav Yosef reported this ruling, <b>he concluded</b> with a statement <b>in the name</b> of <b>Rav Yehuda</b> himself, without attributing it to one of Rav Yehuda’s teachers: <b>If the alleyway terminated in a backyard,</b> i.e., a closed-off area behind a group of houses, then even if there is a breach in the wall between the yard and the public domain beyond it, <b>nothing is needed</b> on this side of the alleyway, as it is considered closed.",
            "<b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: This</b> ruling <b>of Rav Yehuda is</b> a ruling <b>of</b> his teacher <b>Shmuel,</b> and not of his other teacher, Rav."

            "<b>For if</b> it is a ruling <b>of Rav,</b> the apparent contradiction between one statement <b>of Rav</b> and another statement <b>of Rav</b> poses <b>a difficulty in two</b> ways.

In this case, <b>let it be like an alleyway that terminates in a backyard,</b> where Rav Yehuda ruled that nothing further is needed to permit carrying.",
            "Rav Yosef <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>I do not know</b> in accordance with which of his teachers Rav Yehuda issued this ruling. All I know is that there was <b>an incident in a shepherds’ village</b> where <b>an alleyway terminated in a backyard, and</b> the matter <b>came before Rav Yehuda</b> for a ruling, <b>and he did not require anything</b> to render it permitted to carry in the alleyway. <b>And if,</b> as you say, <b>it is difficult</b> if we say that he issued his ruling <b>in the name of Rav, let it be</b> suggested that he issued it <b>in the name of</b> his other teacher, <b>Shmuel, and</b> then <b>there will be no difficulty.</b>",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>Now that Rav Sheshet said to Rav Shmuel bar Abba, and some say</b> that he said <b>to Rav Yosef bar Abba: I will explain to you</b> Rav’s statement with regard to an alleyway that was breached along the entire length of its back wall into a courtyard. One must make a distinction based on the nature of the case: <b>Here </b>it is referring to a case <b>where</b> the residents of the courtyard <b>established an <i>eiruv</i></b> together. In that case, Rav permits carrying in the alleyway and is not concerned with the breach into the courtyard, as the courtyard and the alleyway are treated as a single domain. <b>There</b> it is referring to a case <b>where</b> the residents <b>did not establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> together. In that case, Rav prohibits carrying in the alleyway, because the alleyway now has new residents, i.e., the residents of the courtyard, who did not participate in the <i>eiruv</i>, and they prevent the residents of the alleyway from carrying.",
            "Consequently, it can be said that Rav Yehuda’s statement with regard to an alleyway that terminates in a backyard is in accordance with the opinion of Rav, as the apparent contradiction between one statement <b>of Rav</b> and another statement <b>of Rav also</b> poses <b>no difficulty.

            "<b>And</b> with regard <b>to what first entered our minds,</b> that Rav and Shmuel <b>disagree both</b> in the case <b>where</b> the residents of the alleyway and the residents of the yard <b>established an <i>eiruv</i></b> together, <b>as well as</b> in the case <b>where they did not establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> together, explanation is necessary. The Gemara seeks to explicate <b>on what</b> point <b>they disagree in</b> the case <b>where they established a</b> joint <b><i>eiruv</i>,</b> and <b>on what</b> point <b>they disagree</b> in the case <b>where they did not establish a</b> joint <b><i>eiruv</i>.</b> That is to say, what is the crux of the argument in these two cases?",
            "The Gemara explains: In the case <b>where they did not establish</b> a joint <b><i>eiruv</i>,</b> Rav and Shmuel <b>disagree concerning</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing an alleyway that <b>appears</b> closed <b>from the outside.</b> Outside the alleyway there is a wider courtyard, so that from the perspective of those standing in the courtyard, the breach at the end of the alleyway seems like an entrance, and the alleyway appears to be closed, <b>but</b> appears to be <b>even from the inside.</b> From the perspective of those inside the alleyway, the breach is even with the walls of the alleyway, so that the breach does not look like an entrance, and the alleyway appears to be open. The dispute revolves around the question of whether an alleyway of this kind is considered open or closed. According to the authority who says that it is considered a closed alleyway, one is permitted to carry within an alleyway that terminates in a backyard in this manner.",
            "And in the case <b>where they established a</b> joint <b><i>eiruv</i>, they disagree about</b> the principle stated by <b>Rav Yosef. For Rav Yosef said:</b> The allowance to carry in an alleyway that terminates in a backyard <b>was only taught</b> in a case <b>where</b> the alleyway <b>terminates in the middle of the backyard,</b> so that when viewed from the yard, the alleyway appears to be closed. <b>But</b> if it <b>terminates on</b> one of <b>the sides of the backyard,</b> so that the alleyway and yard appear continuous, carrying in the alleyway <b>is prohibited.</b>",
            "<b>Rabba</b> took the discussion one step further and <b>said: That which you say:</b> Where the alleyway terminates <b>in the middle of the backyard,</b> carrying <b>is permitted,</b> this <b>was only stated</b> with regard to a case where the breach in the back wall of the alleyway into the yard and the breach in the facing wall of the yard into the public domain <b>are not opposite one another. But</b> if the two breaches <b>are opposite one another,</b> carrying within the alleyway <b>is prohibited.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Mesharshiya</b> continued this line of thought and <b>said: That which you say:</b> If the two breaches <b>are not opposite one another,</b> carrying within the alleyway <b>is permitted,</b> this <b>was only stated</b> with regard to the case where <b>the backyard</b> belongs to <b>many</b> people. <b>But</b> if <b>the yard</b> belongs to <b>a</b> single <b>individual, he might sometime change his mind about it and build houses</b> in that part of the yard that is wider than the alleyway, <b>and</b> then the alleyway <b>will become like an alleyway that terminates on</b> one of <b>the sides of the backyard,</b> which is <b>prohibited.</b> If the owner of the yard closes off one side of the yard with houses, the alleyway will no longer terminate in the middle of the yard, but on one of its sides, in which case carrying will be forbidden. Consequently, although the houses have not yet been built, adjustments must be made in the alleyway to permit carrying, so that no problems should arise in the future.",
            "Rav Mesharshiya adds: <b>And from where do you say that we distinguish between a backyard</b> that belongs to <b>many</b> people <b>and a backyard</b> that belongs to <b>a</b> single <b>individual? As Ravin bar Rav Adda said that Rabbi Yitzḥak said:</b> There was <b>an incident involving a certain alleyway,</b> where <b>one of its sides terminated in the sea and one of its sides terminated in a refuse heap,</b> resulting in an alleyway closed on both sides. <b>And the incident came before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, so that he may rule on whether these partitions are sufficient or whether some additional construction is necessary, <b>and he did not say</b> anything <b>about it, neither permission nor prohibition.</b>",
            "The Gemara clarifies: Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>did not state</b> a ruling indicating <b>a prohibition</b> to carry <b>in</b> the alleyway, <b>for partitions,</b> i.e., the sea and the refuse heap, indeed <b>stand,</b> and the alleyway is closed off on both sides. However, <b>he</b> also <b>did not state</b> a ruling granting <b>permission</b> to carry <b>in</b> the alleyway, <b>for we are concerned that perhaps the refuse heap will be removed</b> from its present spot, leaving one side of the alleyway open. <b>And,</b> alternatively, perhaps <b>the sea will raise up sand,</b> and the sandbank will intervene between the end of the alleyway and the sea, so that the sea can no longer be considered a partition for the alleyway.",
            "The Gemara continues: <b>Are we</b> really <b>concerned that perhaps the refuse heap will be removed? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: <b>A refuse heap in the public domain</b> that is <b>ten handbreadths high,</b> so that it has the status of a private domain, and there is <b>a window above</b> the pile of refuse, i.e., the window is in a house adjacent to the refuse heap, <b>we may throw</b> refuse from the window <b>onto</b> the heap <b>on Shabbat.</b> Carrying on Shabbat from one private domain, i.e., the house, to another, i.e., the refuse heap, is permitted. We are not concerned that someone might remove some of the refuse, thus lowering the heap until it is no longer a private domain, such that throwing refuse upon it is prohibited. This seems to present a contradiction, for in some cases we are concerned that the refuse heap might be removed, but in other cases we are not.",
            "<b>Apparently,</b> we <b>distinguish between a public refuse heap and a private refuse heap,</b> such that in the case of a private refuse heap we cannot assume that it will remain in place permanently, as it is likely to be emptied at some point.",
            "<b>Here, too,</b> we <b>distinguish between a backyard</b> belonging to <b>many</b> people, where buildings are not likely to be added, <b>and a backyard</b> belonging to <b>a</b> single <b>individual,</b> where he might consider making changes and add buildings.",
            "The case involving an alleyway opening on one side to the sea and on the other side to a refuse heap was brought before Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, who did not rule on the matter. The Gemara inquires: <b>And the Rabbis</b> of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s generation, <b>what</b> was their opinion with regard to this case? The fact that we are told that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi did not want to issue a ruling indicates that his colleagues disagreed with him.",
            "<b>Rav Yosef bar Avdimi said: It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And the Rabbis prohibit</b> carrying in such an alleyway. <b>Rav Naḥman said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the statement of</b> the <b>Rabbis.

            "The Gemara relates: <b>Mareimar would block off</b> the ends of the alleyways of <b>Sura,</b> which opened to a river, <b>with nets</b> to serve as partitions. <b>He said:</b> Just as <b>we are concerned that perhaps the sea will raise up sand,</b> so too, we are concerned that the river will raise up sand, and hence we cannot rely on its banks to serve as partitions.",
            "The Gemara further relates: With regard to <b>a certain crooked</b> L-shaped <b>alleyway that was in Sura,</b> the residents of the place <b>rolled up a mat</b> and <b>placed it at the turn</b> to serve as a side post to permit carrying within it. <b>Rav Ḥisda said: This</b> was done <b>neither in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav nor in accordance with</b> that of <b>Shmuel.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>According to Rav,</b> who <b>said</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> of</b> a crooked L-shaped alleyway <b>is like that of an</b> alleyway that is <b>open</b> on two opposite sides, it <b>requires</b> an opening in <b>the form of a doorway.</b> And even <b>according to Shmuel,</b> who <b>said</b> that <b>its <i>halakha</i> is like that of an</b> alleyway that is <b>closed</b> at one side, so that carrying is permitted by means of a side post, <b>this applies only</b> to a case where <b>a proper side post</b> was erected. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>this</b> mat, <b>once the wind blows upon it, it throws it over; it is</b> regarded as <b>nothing</b> and is totally ineffective.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>But if a peg was inserted</b> into the mat, <b>and</b> thus the mat was properly <b>attached</b> to the wall, it is considered <b>attached</b> and serves as an effective side post.",
            "The Gemara examines Rav Yirmeya bar Abba’s statement cited in the course of the previous discussion. <b>As to the matter itself, Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said that Rav said: An alleyway that was breached along the entire</b> length of its back wall <b>into a courtyard, and</b> likewise <b>the courtyard was breached on its opposite side</b> into the public domain, <b>the courtyard is permitted</b> for carrying, <b>and the alleyway is prohibited</b> for carrying.",

With regard to the larger courtyard, the breach running the entire length of the smaller courtyard is considered like an entrance in one of its walls, for the breach is surrounded on both sides by the remaining portions of the wall of the larger courtyard, and therefore carrying is permitted. With regard to the smaller courtyard, however, one wall is missing in its entirety, and therefore carrying is forbidden. This seems to be exactly the same as the case of an alleyway that was breached along the entire length of its back wall into a courtyard.",
            "<b>He,</b> Rav Beivai bar Abaye, <b>said to him,</b> Rabba bar Ulla: <b>If</b> this was learned <b>from there</b> alone, <b>I would have said</b> that we must distinguish between the cases: The Mishna’s ruling <b>only applies in a place where many people do not tread.</b> The breach between the smaller and larger courtyard will not cause more people to pass through the larger courtyard, and therefore it remains a unit of its own. <b>But in a place where many people tread,</b> i.e., in the case where a courtyard is breached on one side into an alleyway and on the other side into the public domain, you might <b>say</b> that carrying is prohibited <b>even</b> in the <b>courtyard as well,</b> owing to the people passing through it from the alleyway to the public domain.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But didn’t we</b> already <b>learn this as well,</b> that the mere fact that many people tread through a courtyard does not forbid carrying, for we learned in the Tosefta: <b>A courtyard</b> that was properly surrounded by partitions, <b>into</b> which <b>many people enter on this</b> side <b>and exit on that</b> side, is considered <b>a public domain</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>ritual impurity,</b> so that in cases of doubt, we say that the person or article is pure, <b>but</b> it is still <b>a private domain</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>Shabbat.</b> Therefore, we see that with regard to Shabbat, the sole criterion is the existence of partitions, and the fact that many people pass through the courtyard does not impair its status as a private domain.",
            "The Gemara refutes this argument: <b>If</b> this was derived <b>there</b> alone, <b>I would have said</b> that this <b>only applies</b> in a case where the two breaches are <b>not opposite one another,</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>but</b> if the two breaches <b>are opposite one another,</b> you might <b>say</b> that it is <b>not</b> considered a private domain even with regard to Shabbat. Rav therefore teaches us that even if the breaches of the courtyard line up with each other, carrying is nonetheless permitted therein.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>And according to Rabba, who said</b> that where the alleyway terminates in a backyard and the breaches <b>are one opposite another,</b> carrying <b>is prohibited, how does</b> he <b>construe Rav’s</b> case? Rav’s ruling must refer to a case where the breaches <b>are not one opposite another,</b> and if so, <b>why do I</b> need <b>two</b> rulings? The essence of this <i>halakha</i>, that the yard is deemed a private domain with regard to Shabbat, was already stated in the <i>Tosefta</i>, so why did Rav need to teach another <i>halakha</i> with regard to the very same issue?",
            "The Gemara explains that there is a novelty in Rav’s teaching: <b>If one</b> learned the <i>halakha</i> <b>from there,</b> the <i>Tosefta</i>, alone, <b>I would have said</b> that this ruling that the courtyard is a private domain with regard to Shabbat <b>only applies</b> to the issue <b>of throwing,</b> i.e., that one who throws from the public domain into this courtyard is liable, since it is considered a private domain according to Torah law. <b>But</b> to allow <b>carrying</b> in it like a proper private domain, you might <b>say no,</b> that the Sages forbade carrying in it, owing to the many people passing through it. Rav therefore <b>teaches us</b> that we are not concerned about this, and that carrying in the yard is permitted, even by rabbinic law.",
            "<b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagree about the following matter: With regard to <b>an alleyway</b> that is <b>shaped like a centipede,</b> i.e., a long alleyway that opens to the public domain but with a series of small alleyways branching off of it on both of its sides, all of which also open to the public domain, <b>Abaye said:</b> An opening in <b>the form of a doorway is made for the large</b> alleyway, <b>and all the</b> small alleyways <b>are permitted by</b> means of <b>a side post or a</b> cross <b>beam.</b>",
            "<b>Rava said to him: According to whom</b> do you state this <i>halakha</i>? Apparently according to the opinion of <b>Shmuel, who said</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> of</b> a crooked L-shaped alleyway <b>is like</b> that of an alleyway that is <b>closed</b> at one side. For in this case of an alleyway that is shaped like a centipede, when each of the smaller alleyways connects to the larger alleyway, it forms a crooked L-shaped alleyway. However, if the <i>halakha</i> is indeed in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel, <b>why is the form of a doorway</b> needed <b>for it?</b> According to Shmuel, an alleyway of this kind only requires a side post or a cross beam at each end in order to permit carrying within it. <b>And furthermore,</b> with regard to <b>the crooked,</b> L-shaped <b>alleyway in Neharde’a,</b> which was Shmuel’s place of residence, <b>didn’t they take into consideration</b> the position <b>of Rav?</b> This indicates that the <i>halakha</i> in practice follows Rav as opposed to Shmuel.",
            "<b>Rather, Rava said:</b> An alleyway made like a centipede can be rendered fit for one to carry within it as follows: An opening in <b>the form of a doorway is made for all of</b> the small alleyways <b>on this</b> one of their <b>sides, and the other side is permitted by</b> means of <b>a side post or a</b> cross <b>beam.</b>",
            "The Gemara considers a new case: <b>Rav Kahana bar Taḥalifa said in the name of Rav Kahana bar Minyumi,</b> who said <b>in the name of Rav Kahana bar Malkiyu,</b> who said <b>in the name of Rav Kahana, the teacher of Rav; and some say</b> that <b>Rav Kahana bar Malkiyu is Rav Kahana, the teacher of Rav:</b> With regard to <b>an alleyway that</b> opens into the public domain, <b>its one side</b> being <b>long and its other side</b> being <b>short,</b> i.e., one side juts out into the public domain more than the other, the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: If the difference in length between the two sides is <b>less than four cubits, the</b> cross <b>beam is placed diagonally</b> across the opening between the ends of the two walls of the alleyway.

            "Rava added: <b>I will state my reason, and I will state their reason.

            "<b>I will state their reason</b> as well: <b>What is the reason for a</b> cross <b>beam? To</b> function <b>as a partition,</b> that is to say, the cross beam is considered as though it descended to the ground, creating a fourth wall for the alleyway.

            "<b>Rav Kahana said: Since this</b> involves <b><i>halakhot</i> of</b> Sages named <b>Kahana,</b> I too <b>will say something</b> with regard <b>to it: That which you said,</b> that <b>the</b> cross <b>beam is placed diagonally</b> across the alleyway, this <b>was only said</b> in a case <b>where the diagonal is no more than ten</b> cubits. <b>But if the diagonal is more than ten</b> cubits, then even if the width of the alleyway itself is less than ten cubits, <b>all agree that</b> the cross beam <b>must be placed</b> straight <b>across</b> the alleyway at the end of <b>the short</b> side, for an entrance wider than ten cubits cannot be permitted by a cross beam, and here the entire length under the cross beam is considered an entrance.",
            "<b>A dilemma was raised</b> before the Sages: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>utilizing</b> and carrying in the area <b>beneath the</b> cross <b>beam</b> spanning the opening of an alleyway, which the beam permits carrying?

            "The Gemara suggests a way to understand this dispute: <b>Shall we say</b> that these <i>amora’im</i> <b>argue over the following</b> issue, <b>that Master,</b> representing those who permit it, <b>holds: A</b> cross <b>beam serves</b> in an alleyway <b>as a conspicuous marker</b> that separates it from the public domain, <b>and Master,</b> representing those who prohibit it, <b>holds: A</b> cross <b>beam serves as a partition.</b>",
            "The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>No, everyone</b> might <b>agree</b> that <b>a</b> cross <b>beam serves as a conspicuous marker, but here they argue over the following: Master,</b> representing those who forbid it, <b>holds</b> that <b>the conspicuous marker</b> is intended for those situated <b>inside</b> the alleyway, and hence the area outside the inner edge of the cross beam may not be used; <b>and Master,</b> representing those who permit it, <b>holds</b> that <b>the conspicuous marker</b> is intended for those <b>outside</b> in the public domain, and it is therefore permitted to carry up to the outer edge of the cross beam.",
            "The Gemara proposes an alternative explanation: <b>And if you wish,</b> you can <b>say that everyone</b> agrees that a cross beam permits carrying <b>as a partition, and here they argue over the following</b> issue: <b>As</b> one <b>Sage holds</b> that <b>the inner edge</b> of the cross beam <b>descends</b> to the ground <b>and seals off</b> the alleyway, and therefore under the cross beam is not within the closed-off area; <b>and the</b> other <b>Sage holds</b> that <b>the</b> cross <b>beam’s outer edge descends</b> to the ground <b>and seals off</b> the alleyway, and therefore it is permitted to carry even in the area beneath the cross beam.

            "<b>Rav Ḥisda said: All concede</b> that utilizing the area <b>between the side posts</b> placed at the entrance to an alleyway to permit carrying <b>is prohibited,</b> for a side post functions as a partition, and therefore one may only use the space up to its inner edge, but no further.",
            "<b>Rami bar Ḥama raised a dilemma before Rav Ḥisda: What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in a case where a person <b>inserted two pegs in the two alleyway walls,</b> one in each wall, <b>on the outside</b> of the entrance facing the public domain, <b>and he placed a</b> cross <b>beam on top of</b> the pegs, such that the beam is attached to the front of the alleyway walls instead of on top of them?

            "Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: According to the statement of</b> the one <b>who permits</b> utilizing the area beneath the cross beam, carrying within the alleyway <b>is prohibited,</b> for he holds that the cross beam’s outer edge is the critical one, and here this outer edge is positioned outside the alleyway and therefore cannot permit it.

            "<b>Lest you say</b> that if the cross beam is distanced from the wall <b>from one direction, we say</b> that the principle of <b><i>lavud</i></b> applies, and it is as if the cross beam is joined to the wall; but if it is distanced from the wall <b>from two directions, we do not say</b> that the principle of <b><i>lavud</i></b> applies. The <i>baraita</i>, therefore, comes and <b>teaches us</b> that there is no difference in this regard.",

            "The Gemara records a dispute with regard to the scope of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement: <b>Abaye said: Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement is reasonable</b> with regard to the area <b>beneath the</b> cross <b>beam,</b> as only the area beneath the cross beam should be considered a private domain, <b>but between the side posts,</b> carrying <b>is</b> indeed <b>prohibited,</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Zakkai. <b>And Rava said:</b> The entire statement of Rabbi Zakkai is to be rejected, as Rabbi Yoḥanan asserted, and <b>even</b> in the area <b>between the side posts</b> carrying <b>is permitted.</b>",
            "<b>Rava said: From where do I</b> know to <b>say this,</b> that carrying is permitted even between the side posts? <b>For when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A place that has</b> an area of <b>less than four by four</b> handbreadths and is located between a public and private domain but belongs to neither has the status of an exempt domain with regard to carrying on Shabbat. Therefore, <b>it is permitted for</b> both <b>the people in the public domain</b> as well as <b>the people in the private domain to</b> use it for <b>loading</b> their burdens <b>onto their shoulders, so long as they do not exchange</b> objects with one another. Therefore, a place having an area of less than four handbreadths is not considered a <i>karmelit</i>, but rather an exempt domain, where carrying is permitted. Consequently, the area between the side posts should likewise be considered an exempt domain, and carrying should be permitted within it.",
            "<b>And Abaye</b> said that this offers no proof, as <b>there,</b> with regard to Rav Dimi’s statement, the area being discussed <b>is</b> at least <b>three</b> handbreadths <b>high,</b> setting it apart from the other domains. It is therefore considered a domain in its own right, and has the <i>halakha</i> of an exempt domain.",

This demonstrates that it is forbidden to carry in the space between the side posts without another side post.",
            "<b>And if you say that</b> this is a case where the doorway <b>has</b> an area <b>four by four</b> handbreadths, and therefore an additional side post is required to permit carrying there, this is not a valid argument. <b>For didn’t Rav Ḥanin bar Rava say that Rav said:</b> The area <b>within the opening</b> itself, <b>even if it does not have</b> an area of <b>four by four</b> handbreadths, <b>requires an additional side post</b> in order <b>to permit</b> carrying within it. This indicates that the area between the side posts is not to be used.",
            "<b>And Rava</b> replies that a distinction must be made between the cases: <b>There,</b> the case of Rav’s ruling refers to a scenario where the alleyway’s entrance <b>opens to a <i>karmelit</i>,</b> and thus the space between the entrance posts is also viewed as a <i>karmelit</i>, and an additional side post is required.",
            "The Gemara poses a question: <b>But</b> if the entrance opens <b>to a public domain, what</b> would be the <i>halakha</i>? Would it be <b>permitted</b> to carry there even without an additional side post? If so, it follows that the <i>halakha</i> of a <i>karmelit</i> is more stringent than that of a public domain. However, this seems untenable, for carrying in a <i>karmelit</i> is prohibited only by rabbinic decree, owing to the similarity between a <i>karmelit</i> and the public domain. This is similar to a situation where <b>a permanent resident is</b> down <b>on the ground, while a stranger is</b> raised up <b>to the highest heaven,</b> the very opposite of the appropriate state of affairs.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>Yes,</b> it is possible that this is the ruling, for we can say that <b>it has found its own type and been awakened.</b> In other words, as the area within the entranceway is not a defined domain, it doesn’t have the status of an independent domain. Therefore, when it opens into a <i>karmelit</i>, to which it is similar, its status is negated, and it joins with the <i>karmelit</i> to form a single unit. However, when it opens into a public domain, it cannot join with it because it is not similar to a public domain, which has a totally different set of laws; and therefore it is considered part of the alleyway, and it is permitted to carry within it.",

            "<b>Rather,</b> it must be that he set the vines <b>on top of</b> the posts. <b>And in what</b> circumstances did Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish disagree? <b>If you say</b> that the posts were set at a distance <b>of ten</b> cubits from each other, <b>would Rabbi Yoḥanan say in that</b> case that <b>with regard to Shabbat,</b> they did <b>not</b> permit him to consider the area sealed?

            "Abaye explains the dispute: <b>Rabbi Meir holds</b> that <b>one carves</b> out the area <b>to complete</b> the four handbreadths, i.e., the arch is considered as though it has already been carved out, and the opening has the necessary dimensions. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>one does not carve out</b> the arch <b>to complete</b> the four handbreadths.

However, they both agree that a side post and a cross beam alone are not effective. Since at this point the Gemara assumes that the dispute in the mishna between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel applies to all alleyways, whether closed on one side or open on two opposite sides to the public domain, these opinions reflect an entirely different position.",

            "Rava replied: <b>This is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> If the alleyway is closed on one side such that <b>it requires only a side post</b> in order to permit carrying within in, <b>one who throws</b> an object <b>into it</b> from the public domain <b>is liable</b> because the alleyway already has three partitions and is therefore a proper private domain according to Torah law. However, if the alleyway requires <b>a side post and something else</b> in order to permit carrying within it, <b>one who throws</b> an object <b>into it</b> from the public domain <b>is exempt</b> because the alleyway has only two partitions and is therefore not considered a private domain.",
            "<b>He raised an</b> additional <b>objection</b> to Rava from the following <i>baraita</i>. <b>Furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> is as follows with regard to <b>one who has two houses</b> opposite each other <b>on two sides of the public domain,</b> if he chooses, <b>he may</b> create a private domain for himself in the area of the public domain. He may <b>place a</b> ten-handbreadth high <b>side post from here,</b> perpendicular to the public domain. This creates a symbolic wall which, in the <i>halakhot</i> of alleyways, has the legal status of a wall. <b>And,</b> he may place <b>an</b> additional <b>post from here,</b> on the other side, and that has the same legal status as if he closed the public domain on all of its sides. <b>Or,</b> he can implement a different solution appropriate for alleyways by placing <b>a beam</b> extending <b>from here,</b> from one end of one house, to the end of the house opposite it. This creates a symbolic partition across the width of the street. <b>And,</b> he may place <b>a beam</b> extending <b>from here,</b> from the other side of the house.

It follows from this that a side post is in fact deemed a proper partition, contrary to Rava’s statement.",
            "The Gemara answers: This is not the reason behind Rabbi Yehuda’s statement. Rather, <b>there Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>by Torah law two partitions</b> suffice to constitute a private domain, and he requires side posts only as a conspicuous marker.

            "The Gemara challenges this statement: <b>Is that so?

The Torah requires <b>writing that can be blotted out.</b>",
            "The Gemara clarifies elements of the conversation: <b>What is</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>saying to</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>and what is he answering him?</b> Rabbi Meir’s response with regard to iron sulfate does not seem to address Rabbi Yishmael’s comments with regard to omissions and additions.",
            "The Gemara explains that <b>this is</b> what Rabbi Meir <b>is saying to</b> Rabbi Yishmael: <b>There is no need</b> to mention <b>defective and plene</b> words, <b>as I am an expert; however, even with regard to the concern that a fly might come and land on the crown of</b> the letter <b><i>dalet</i> and blot it out and render it a <i>reish</i>,</b> thereby changing the meaning of the word, I am not concerned, as <b>I have a substance called iron sulfate that I place into the ink</b> so that it will not be erased.",
            "Nevertheless, <b>there is a difficulty between service and service,</b> as one source states that Rabbi Meir initially served Rabbi Akiva, whereas the other source states that he served Rabbi Yishmael first. <b>There is a difficulty between</b> the words <b>he prohibited it</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, which is referring to Rabbi Akiva, <b>and he prohibited it</b> in the statement of Rav Yehuda, which is referring to Rabbi Yishmael.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>Granted, there is no difficulty between</b> the accounts in the two sources with regard to <b>service and service,</b> as it can be suggested as follows: Rabbi Meir <b>initially came</b> to study <b>before Rabbi Akiva, and since he was unable to comprehend</b> the teachings <b>in accordance with his</b> opinion, <b>he came before Rabbi Yishmael and studied the tradition, and again came before Rabbi Akiva and studied logical</b> analysis.

            "Having reconciled the first difficulty, the Gemara continues: <b>However, the difficulty with regard to</b> whether Rabbi Akiva <b>prohibited</b> iron sulfate or Rabbi Yishmael <b>prohibited</b> it remains <b>difficult.</b> The Gemara notes: It indeed remains <b>difficult;</b> no answer was found.",
            "The Gemara continues the discussion of iron sulfate. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: One may place iron sulfate into the ink</b> that is to be used <b>for all</b> sacred writings, <b>except for</b> the writing of <b>the</b> Torah <b>passage</b> with regard to <b>a <i>sota</i>,</b> as it must be possible to erase that writing. <b>Rabbi Ya’akov says in his name: Except for</b> the writing of <b>the</b> Torah <b>passage</b> with regard to <b>a <i>sota</i></b> used <b>in the Temple</b> in the ordeal to determine the guilt or innocence of the wife suspected of adultery.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the difference <b>between their</b> opinions, i.e., what is their point of dispute? The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Yirmeya said:</b> The difference <b>between their</b> opinions <b>is</b> whether it is permissible <b>to erase</b> the passage of a <i>sota</i> <b>from a Torah</b> scroll. The <i>tanna’im</i> of the <i>baraita</i> disagree whether or not a section taken from a Torah scroll may be used for this purpose, or whether a special scroll must be written for use in the ordeal of the <i>sota</i>.",
            "<b>And those <i>tanna’im</i></b> disagree in the same dispute <b>as these <i>tanna’im</i>, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A scroll that was written for one woman suspected of infidelity but was not used, <b>her scroll is not fit</b> to prepare the water <b>to give to another <i>sota</i> to drink.</b> However, <b>Rabbi Aḥai bar Yoshiya said: Her scroll is fit</b> to be used to prepare the water <b>to give another <i>sota</i> to drink.</b> The legal status of a Torah scroll, which is not written for a particular <i>sota</i>, should be the same.",
            "<b>Rav Pappa said: Perhaps that is not</b> the case, as the two circumstances are not comparable. <b>The first <i>tanna</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>stated</b> his opinion that one woman’s scroll may not be used for another woman <b>only there; since it had</b> originally <b>been designated in the name of</b> one woman, e.g., <b>Rachel, it cannot then be designated in the name of</b> another woman, e.g., <b>Leah.

            "Furthermore, <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> in another attempt to resolve the matter: <b>Perhaps it is not so,</b> as an additional distinction exists between the two cases: <b>Rabbi Aḥai bar Yoshiya stated</b> his opinion that the first woman’s scroll may be used for another woman <b>only there because at least,</b> in that case, <b>it was written for a</b> particular <b><i>sota</i> in the world.

            "The Gemara rejects this: <b>And it is not so;</b> that is not a valid <i>a fortiori</i> argument, as it can be refuted.

            "The Gemara suggests another proof. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the following mishna: With regard to <b>a tree</b> whose branches <b>hang over</b> from a height of greater than ten handbreadths and reach almost to <b>the ground, if</b> the ends of <b>its branches are not higher than three handbreadths from the ground, one may carry under it;</b> the branches constitute partitions all around, and it is therefore permissible to carry in the enclosed area. The Gemara responds: <b>Here, too, with what are we dealing?</b> With a case <b>where he planted</b> the tree <b>from the outset for this</b> purpose.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so, it should</b> be permitted to <b>carry in all of it</b> no matter how large the area. <b>Why,</b> then, <b>did Rav Huna, the son of Rav Yehoshua, say: One may only carry</b> under the tree if its branches enclose an area no larger than <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>,</b> i.e., five thousand square cubits? If the area is larger, it is not considered a courtyard, and carrying there is prohibited. This indicates that the branches are not considered full-fledged partitions.",
            "The Gemara answers: The reason that carrying is permitted only if the enclosed area is less than this size is <b>because it is a dwelling whose use is for</b> the open <b>air</b> beyond it, i.e., it is used by guards who are watching the fields beyond it, rather than as an independent dwelling place, <b>and</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>any dwelling whose use is for</b> the open <b>air</b> beyond it is that <b>one may carry in it only if</b> its area is no larger than <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>.</b>",
            "The Gemara suggests another proof. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which was taught in the following <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one</b> who <b>established his Shabbat</b> abode <b>on a mound that was ten</b> handbreadths <b>high and</b> its area was anywhere <b>from four cubits to</b> the <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>; and similarly,</b> one who established his Shabbat abode <b>in a</b> natural <b>cavity</b> of a rock <b>that is ten</b> handbreadths <b>deep and</b> its area was anywhere <b>from four cubits to two <i>beit se’a</i>;</b> and similarly, one who established his Shabbat abode in a field of <b>reaped grain, and</b> rows of <b>stalks</b> ten handbreadths high that have not been reaped <b>surround it,</b> serving as a partition enclosing the reaped area, <b>he may walk in the entire</b> enclosed area, <b>and outside it</b> an additional <b>two thousand cubits.</b> This indicates that a partition not specifically constructed to serve as a partition is nonetheless valid.",
            "<b>And if you say</b> that <b>here, too,</b> it is a case <b>where he made it from the outset for this</b> purpose, there is a difficulty. <b>Granted,</b> in the case of the <b>grain,</b> this answer is <b>all right; but</b> with regard to <b>a mound and a cavity, what can be said?</b> They were there from time immemorial and were not constructed to serve as partitions.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara rejects its previous argument and explains: <b>With regard to partitions, all agree that</b> a partition that stands by itself <b>is a partition,</b> despite the fact that it was not erected for that purpose. <b>Where they disagree</b> is <b>with regard to a side post.

            "The Gemara now attempts to prove which side is correct according to this version of the dispute. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the <i>Tosefta</i>: With regard to <b>stones of a wall that protrude from the wall</b> and are <b>separated from each other</b> by <b>less than three</b> handbreadths, <b>there is no need for another side post</b> in order to permit carrying in the alleyway; the protruding stones join together to form a side post.

            "Based on Rav’s response, the Gemara argues as follows: <b>The reason</b> that the palm tree could not serve as a side post is <b>because we did not rely</b> on the palm tree from yesterday. This indicates that <b>had we relied</b> on it, <b>it would be a</b> valid <b>side post,</b> thus proving that a side post that was not erected for that purpose is nonetheless valid, in accordance with the opinion of Abaye.",

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir says: An animate object may neither be used as a wall for a <i>sukka</i>, nor as a side post for an alleyway, nor as</b> one of the upright <b>boards</b> surrounding <b>a well, nor as the covering of a grave.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason for Rabbi Yosei HaGelili’s</b> opinion? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “When a man takes a wife, and marries her, then it comes to pass if she finds no favor in his eyes, because he has found some unseemly thing in her; that he write her <b>a scroll</b> of severance and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house” (Deuteronomy 24:1): From the word scroll, <b>I have</b> derived that <b>only a scroll</b> is valid. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>to include all objects</b> as valid materials upon which a bill of divorce may be written? <b>The Torah states: “That he write her,” in any case,</b> i.e., any surface upon which the formula can be written. <b>If so, why does the verse state “scroll”? To tell you</b> that a bill of divorce must be written on a surface like a scroll: <b>Just as a scroll is neither alive nor food, so too,</b> a bill of divorce may be written on <b>any object that is neither alive nor food.</b> That is why Rabbi Yosei HaGelili invalidates a bill of divorce written on a living being.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree and say that a bill of divorce may be written even on a living creature or on food, interpret the verse?

No, <b>scroll [<i>sefer</i>] is written, which comes to</b> teach that <b>a mere account of the matters [<i>sefirot devarim</i>]</b> is required. In other words, <i>sefer</i> is referring not to the surface on which a bill of divorce must be written, but rather to the essence of the bill of divorce. The verse teaches that the bill of divorce must contain particular content.",
            "The Gemara continues: <b>And what do the Rabbis derive</b> from <b>the</b> phrase <b>“that he write her”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> phrase <b>is required</b> to teach the principle that a woman <b>is divorced</b> only <b>by means of writing,</b> i.e., a bill of divorce, <b>and she is not divorced by means of money. It might have entered your mind to say: Since</b> in the verse, <b>leaving</b> marriage, i.e., divorce, <b>is juxtaposed to becoming</b> married, i.e., betrothal, then, <b>just as becoming</b> married <b>is</b> effected <b>with money, so</b> too, <b>leaving</b> marriage may be effected <b>with money.</b> Therefore, the Torah <b>teaches us:</b> “That he write for her”; divorce can be effected only with a written bill of divorce.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, from where does he</b> derive <b>this reasoning,</b> that a woman cannot be divorced with money? The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> the phrase: <b>A scroll of severance,</b> which teaches that <b>a scroll,</b> i.e., a written document, <b>severs her</b> from her husband <b>and nothing else severs her</b> from him.",
            "The Gemara continues: <b>And the Rabbis</b> explain that <b>this</b> phrase: <b>A scroll of severance, is required</b> to teach that a bill of divorce must be <b>a matter that severs</b> all connection <b>between him and her. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a man says to his wife: <b>This is your bill of divorce, on condition that you will</b> never <b>drink wine,</b> or <b>on condition that you will never go to your father’s house, that is not severance;</b> the bill of divorce is not valid. If a bill of divorce imposes a condition upon the woman that permanently binds her to her husband, her relationship with her husband has not been completely severed, which is a prerequisite for divorce. If, however, he imposes a condition <b>for the duration of thirty days,</b> or any other limited period of time, <b>that is severance,</b> and the bill of divorce is valid, as the relationship will be completely terminated at the end of the thirty-day period.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yosei HaGelili derives</b> that a condition without a termination point invalidates the divorce <b>from</b> the fact that instead of using the term <b><i>karet</i>,</b> the verse uses the more expanded term <b><i>keritut</i>.</b> Inasmuch as both terms denote severance, using the longer term teaches us two things: Divorce can be effected only by means of writing and not through money, and divorce requires total severance.",

            "With regard to <b>any</b> partition that consists of boards that are <b>four</b> handbreadths wide, <b>as well as</b> boards <b>from four</b> handbreadths <b>to ten cubits</b> wide, <b>it is necessary that there not be</b> a gap <b>the full</b> width of a board <b>between one</b> board <b>and the next, so that the breached</b> segment <b>will not equal the standing</b> segment. <b>And if the breached</b> segment <b>equals the standing</b> segment, then in the area <b>opposite the standing</b> segment, <b>it is permitted</b> to sow other species, as there is a partition there; however, in the area <b>facing the breached</b> segment <b>it is prohibited.

            "The Gemara explains how the passage from the <i>Tosefta</i> of tractate <i>Kilayim</i> supports the opinion of Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, contrary to that of Rav Pappa. <b>In any case, the first clause</b> of the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>teaches</b> that if each of the boards that make up the partition is <b>from three to four</b> handbreadths wide, sowing other species is permitted, <b>provided that there is not</b> a gap <b>the full</b> width of a board <b>between one</b> board <b>and the next.</b> This is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion of <b>Rav Pappa,</b> who permits carrying when the breach equals the standing segment of the partition.",

            "The Gemara points out that that analysis of the <i>baraita</i> leads to the conclusion that <b>the latter clause poses a difficulty for Rav Pappa’s</b> opinion; <b>the first clause poses a difficulty for</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua.</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>The latter clause poses no difficulty to Rav Pappa. Since the first clause taught</b> the expression: If <b>the</b> sum of <b>the breached</b> segment <b>is greater than the</b> sum of the <b>standing</b> segment, <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>taught</b> the parallel expression: If <b>the</b> sum of the <b>standing</b> segment <b>is greater than</b> the sum of <b>the breached</b> segment, even though the latter formulation is imprecise, as the same <i>halakha</i> applies even if the two are equal.",
            "Similarly, the Gemara explains that <b>the first clause does not pose a difficulty to Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua. Since</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>sought to teach</b> the expression <b>in</b> the <b>latter clause:</b> If the sum of <b>the standing</b> segments <b>is greater than the</b> sum of the <b>breached</b> segments, in <b>the first clause taught</b> the parallel expression: If the sum of <b>the breached</b> segments <b>is greater than</b> the sum of <b>the standing</b> segments, even though this formulation is imprecise, as the same <i>halakha</i> applies even if the two are equal.",
            "The Gemara continues: <b>Granted, according to Rav Pappa,</b> who permits carrying in the case where the breaches equal the standing segments, the <i>baraita</i> makes sense, as <b>for that</b> reason the <i>tanna</i> <b>did not combine</b> the case of boards less than three handbreadths wide with the case of boards three handbreadths wide <b>and teach them</b> in a single clause. According to Rav Pappa, there is a significant difference between the two situations. In a case where the boards are less than three handbreadths wide, the partition is invalid if there is a gap of three handbreadths between one bar and the next. However, if the boards are precisely three handbreadths wide, the partition is valid unless there is a gap of more than three handbreadths between them.",
            "<b>However, according to Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua,</b> who considers a partition invalid when its breached segments are equal to its standing segments, the <i>baraita</i> <b>should have combined</b> the case of boards less than three handbreadths wide with the case of boards exactly three handbreadths wide <b>and taught them</b> in the following single clause: <b>Any</b> partition made of boards <b>less than three</b> handbreadths wide <b>or</b> exactly <b>three</b> handbreadths wide, <b>it is necessary that there not be</b> a gap of <b>three</b> handbreadths <b>between one</b> board <b>and another.</b> According to Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, if a partition with boards three handbreadths wide is to be valid, the gap must be less than three handbreadths.",
            "The Gemara explains why the two cases were not combined according to Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua. It is <b>because the disqualification in the first clause is not similar to the disqualification in the latter clause.</b> The reason for <b>the disqualification in the first clause</b> is because a valid partition must be constructed <b>so that a goat would not</b> be able <b>to jump</b> through the gap <b>in one</b> leap; the reason for <b>the disqualification in the latter clause,</b> where the boards are three handbreadths wide, is <b>so that the breached</b> segments <b>will equal the</b> combined <b>standing</b> segments. In practice, just as in the case of boards less than three handbreadths wide, the gap must be less than three handbreadths, so too, in the case of boards three handbreadths wide, the gap must also be less than three handbreadths. However, in terms of underlying reasoning, the case of boards three handbreadths wide must be categorized in the second grouping in the <i>Tosefta</i>, not the first. Therefore, no proof can be cited from here, neither in support of the opinion of Rav Pappa nor in support of the opinion of Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua.",
            "The Gemara briefly discusses the ruling cited in the <i>Tosefta</i> that a breach of <b>less than three</b> handbreadths does not invalidate a partition.

Is it also considered standing if the standing segment is greater than the breached segment, or not?",

            "The Gemara presents a difficulty: <b>And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> that this would be effective? <b>Where does he position</b> the space of slightly <b>less than four</b> handbreadths? <b>If he positions it at the bottom, its</b> legal status <b>is like</b> that of <b>a partition through which goats pass,</b> which is not a valid partition.",

However, if each side is considered separately, the breach is greater than the standing portion. If it is nevertheless deemed a partition, <b>conclude from it</b> that even if <b>the standing</b> segment <b>is greater than the breached</b> segment only when the standing segments <b>on the two sides</b> of the breach are combined, the partition is considered <b>standing.</b> However, that circumstance was raised as a dilemma and remained unresolved.",
            "<b>Rather, Rav Hamnuna raised the following dilemma:</b> What is the <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where one brought a mat that is seven</b> handbreadths <b>and any</b> additional amount, <b>and carved in it</b> a hole <b>three</b> handbreadths wide, <b>and left four</b> handbreadths above the hole <b>and any</b> additional amount below it, <b>and positioned</b> the mat <b>less than three</b> handbreadths off the ground?",
            "<b>Rav Ashi said: The dilemma he raised</b> is with regard to the legal status of a ten-handbreadth <b>partition suspended</b> off the ground.

            "But <b>the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He</b> is that <b>one is</b> willingly <b>silent</b> when he <b>is sentenced to death by the Omnipresent, as it is stated: “For You silence is praise,</b> O God in Zion, and to You shall the vow be performed” (Psalms 65:2). <b>And what is more, he praises</b> God for his sufferings, <b>as it is stated: “Praise.” And what is more, it appears to him as though he were offering a sacrifice</b> in atonement for his sin, <b>as it is stated: “And to You shall the vow be performed.”</b>",

            "<b>“Those who pass through [<i>overei</i>],” these are people who transgress [<i>overin</i>] the will of the Holy One, Blessed be He. “Valley [<i>emek</i>]”</b> indicates that their punishment is that <b>Gehenna is deepened [<i>ma’amikin</i>] for them. “Of weeping [<i>bakha</i>]”</b> and “turn it into a water spring [<i>ma’ayan yeshituhu</i>],” indicates that <b>they weep [<i>bokhin</i>] and make tears flow like a spring [<i>ma’ayan</i>] of the foundations [<i>shitin</i>],</b> meaning like a spring that descends to the foundations of the earth. <b>“Moreover, the early rain covers it with blessings,”</b> indicates that <b>they accept</b> the justice of God’s <b>judgment, and say before Him: Master of the Universe, You have judged properly, You have acquitted properly, You have condemned properly, and it is befitting that You have prepared Gehenna for the wicked and the Garden of Eden for the righteous.</b>",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Is that so?

The verse <b>does not say: Who rebelled, but</b> rather: <b>“Who rebel,”</b> in the present tense, meaning <b>they continue rebelling forever.</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult; here,</b> i.e., where it is said that they accept God’s judgment, it is referring <b>to the sinners of the Jewish people; there,</b> i.e., where it is said that they do not recant, it is referring <b>to the rebels among the nations of the world.</b>",
            "<b>So too, it is reasonable</b> to say this, for <b>if</b> you do not say <b>so,</b> there would be <b>a contradiction</b> between one statement <b>of Reish Lakish and</b> another statement <b>of Reish Lakish.

            "<b>If the golden altar</b> in the Temple, <b>which was only covered by</b> gold <b>the thickness of a golden dinar, stood for many years and the fire did not burn it,</b> for its gold did not melt, so too <b>the sinners of the Jewish people, who are filled with good deeds like a pomegranate, as it is stated: “Your temples [<i>rakatekh</i>] are like a split pomegranate</b> behind your veil” (Song of Songs 6:7), will not be affected by the fire of Gehenna. <b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said</b> about this: <b>Do not read: Your temples [<i>rakatekh</i>], but</b> rather: <b>Your empty ones [<i>reikateikh</i>],</b> meaning that <b>even the sinners among you are full of mitzvot like a pomegranate; how much more so</b> should the fire of Gehenna have no power over them.",
            "<b>However, that which is written: “Those who pass through the valley of weeping”</b> (Psalms 84:7), which implies that the sinners nonetheless descend to Gehenna, should be explained as follows: <b>There</b> it speaks of <b>those who are liable at that time</b> for punishment <b>in Gehenna, but our father Abraham comes and raises them up and receives them.</b> He does not leave the circumcised behind and allow them to enter Gehenna, <b>except for a Jew who had relations with a gentile woman,</b> in punishment for which <b>his foreskin is drawn, and</b> our father Abraham <b>does not recognize him</b> as one of his descendants.",
            "<b>Rav Kahana strongly objected to this: Now</b> that <b>you have said</b> that the words <b>those who rebel</b> are referring to <b>those who go on rebelling, if so,</b> in those verses in which <b>it is written of</b> Him: <b>“He Who brings out”</b> (see Exodus 6:7) <b>and “He Who raises up”</b> Israel from Egypt (see Leviticus 11:45), do these expressions mean: <b>He Who is</b> currently <b>raising</b> them <b>up and bringing</b> them <b>out?

            "The Gemara refutes this objection: <b>Rav Naḥman’s statement applies</b> only in a case where the partition was erected <b>intentionally.</b> Since the partition was erected intentionally on Shabbat, the Sages imposed a penalty that it is prohibited to carry within the enclosed area.

            "After Rabbi Yehoshua <b>related to him the entire incident,</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>said to him: Give me water so that I may wash my hands.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him:</b> The water that I brought <b>will not suffice for drinking;</b> how <b>will it suffice for washing your hands?

In that case, the total area enclosed by the boards could exceed an area of two <i>beit se’a</i>.",
            "The underlying rationale of each side of this dilemma is as follows: Does one <b>fix his eyes on his cistern,</b> keeping in mind that the partition is made because of it, <b>and</b> therefore, since the area of the cistern is not greater than an area of two <i>beit se’a</i>, <b>we do not decree lest he come to carry</b> also <b>in an enclosure [<i>karpef</i>],</b> an enclosed storage space behind the house that was not originally surrounded by a fence for the purpose of residence, even when it is <b>more than</b> an area of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>?</b>",
            "<b>Or perhaps a person fixes his eyes on his partition,</b> and does not pay attention to the cistern, but only to the area enclosed by the partition. <b>And</b> in this case <b>we</b> do <b>decree, lest he come to confuse</b> this case <b>with</b> that of <b>a <i>karpef</i></b> that is <b>larger than</b> an area of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>,</b> and come to carry there, because of the similarity between them.",
            "In order to resolve this question, the Gemara cites a proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> what was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How close</b> may the boards be to the well?

            "The other Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Yehuda: Do you not concede with regard to a pen, a stable, a backyard, and a courtyard, that even one</b> the size <b>of five <i>beit kor</i> and</b> even <b>of ten <i>beit kor</i> is permitted</b> for use?",
            "Rabbi Yehuda <b>said to them:</b> A distinction can be made between the cases, for <b>this,</b> the wall surrounding the pen, the stable or the yard, is a proper <b>partition,</b> and hence it is permitted to carry in them even if they are more than an area of two <i>beit se’a</i>.

            "The Gemara tries to draw an inference from this <i>baraita</i>: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar spoke</b> only <b>of the cistern</b> itself <b>and not</b> of the upright <b>boards,</b> we can <b>infer</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda spoke of</b> both <b>the cistern</b> itself <b>and</b> the area enclosed by <b>the</b> upright <b>boards.</b> The Gemara rejects this argument: It is <b>not so.</b> When <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> said that the area may be expanded up to an area of two <i>beit se’a</i>, <b>he was,</b> in fact, <b>speaking of</b> the area of <b>the cistern without</b> that which is enclosed by <b>the</b> upright <b>boards.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so, that is</b> exactly what <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar</b> said.

            "The Gemara adds: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar stated a principle:</b> With regard to <b>any</b> enclosed <b>space that is used as a dwelling, such as a pen, a stable, a backyard, or a courtyard,</b> even if it lacks a roof and <b>even</b> if the structure has the area of <b>five <i>beit kor</i> and</b> even <b>ten <i>beit kor</i>, it is permitted</b> to carry in it.",

            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: If he first <b>opened</b> the entrance <b>and afterward fenced in</b> the area, it is <b>obvious</b> that it is permitted to carry throughout the yard, because it is clear that the area was enclosed for the entrance, i.e., in order to use it from the house. The Gemara answers: This ruling <b>is necessary only</b> in the case <b>where there is a threshing floor</b> in the yard. This is because <b>you might have said</b> that <b>he made</b> the entrance <b>with the threshing floor in mind,</b> and not so that he would be able to use the entire yard. <b>He</b> therefore comes and <b>teaches us</b> that the entrance renders it permitted to carry in the yard in all cases.",

            "The Gemara seeks to clarify which of the Sages held which opinion. <b>Conclude that</b> it was <b>Rav Ḥisda</b> who <b>said it is effective, for it was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagreed about the following: If <b>one erected a partition on top of an</b> existing <b>partition, Rav Ḥisda said:</b> With regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>Shabbat,</b> e.g., if the first partition was not erected for the purpose of residence, the second partition <b>is effective.</b>",

            "<b>What is the reason</b> that the first one who sowed the seeds does not acquire the property? <b>At the time that he sowed,</b> the land <b>was not improved</b> by his sowing. <b>When it did improve,</b> with the growth of the turnips, <b>it improved on its own.</b> That is to say, the act of sowing alone is not a sufficiently noticeable action that changes and improves the property at the time. Although the sowing later proves to have been beneficial, this is seen as an improvement of the land that comes on its own. Therefore, an action that will only provide benefit in the future cannot serve as an act of acquisition.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> you must say that the dilemma was raised <b>with respect to Shabbat,</b> in which case it is <b>a partition that was made on Shabbat;</b> beforehand it was not a valid partition, and the upper ones acquired the status of a partition only after the lower partitions sank into the ground.",
            "<b>And it was</b> already <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Any partition made on Shabbat, whether unwittingly or intentionally, is called a</b> valid <b>partition.</b> Consequently, the upper partitions should be regarded as valid partitions that allow one to carry in the <i>karpef</i>.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Wasn’t it stated about this</b> law that <b>Rav Naḥman said: They taught</b> that such a partition is called a partition <b>only</b> as a stringency, in that it is prohibited <b>to throw</b> from an area enclosed by such a partition into the public domain and vice versa; <b>but to carry</b> within it as a full-fledged private domain <b>is prohibited.</b> This implies that these are not proper partitions.",
            "The Gemara refutes this objection: <b>When</b> that statement of <b>Rav Naḥman was stated, it was stated</b> with regard to a case where one erected the partition <b>intentionally.</b> Since one intentionally violated Shabbat when he erected the partition, the Sages imposed a penalty that he is prohibited to carry within the enclosed area.

As, if the Torah had written</b> only <b>“on oxen,” I might have said</b> that <b>it is</b> only an <b>ox that may be bought</b> together <b>with its hide</b> with second-tithe money <b>because</b> the hide <b>is</b> an inseparable part of <b>its body,</b> and therefore it is not considered an independent entity from its flesh. <b>But</b> as for buying a <b>sheep</b> together <b>with its fleece, which is not</b> an inseparable part of <b>its body</b> because the fleece can be removed from the sheep while it is alive, you might <b>say no,</b> second-tithe money may not be spent in this manner. It was therefore necessary to state “on sheep.”",

Therefore, <b>the Torah wrote:</b> “On <b>strong drink.”</b>",
            "The necessity of each word much be proven in the opposite order as well. <b>And if the Torah had</b> only <b>written “on strong drink,” I might have said: What is</b> meant by <b>strong drink?

            "If so, <b>why do I</b> need the words <b>“on oxen”?</b> If one may purchase a sheep together with its fleece with second-tithe money, it should certainly be permitted to buy an ox together with its hide. <b>And if you say</b> that <b>if the Torah had not written “on oxen,” I might have said</b> that <b>a sheep</b> together <b>with its hide, yes,</b> it may be bought with second-tithe money, but together <b>with its fleece, no,</b> it may not be bought; therefore, <b>the Torah wrote “on oxen,” to include its hide,</b> and so “on <b>sheep” remains</b> available for interpretation <b>to include its fleece,</b> i.e., that a sheep may be bought even together with its fleece. Therefore, the words “on oxen” are necessary, for without them I would have understood “on sheep” differently.",
            "This argument can, however, be refuted: Even <b>if the Torah had not written “on oxen,” I would not have said</b> that a <b>sheep</b> together <b>with its hide, yes,</b> it may be bought with second-tithe money, but together <b>with its fleece, no,</b> it may not. For <b>if</b> it were <b>so, the Torah should have written</b> “on <b>oxen,” in which case</b> the words “on <b>sheep” would remain</b> available for interpretation. “On sheep” can be explained in two ways, both in reference to its hide as well as in reference to its fleece. Had the Torah wanted to teach only that an animal may be bought together with its hide but not with its fleece, it would have written “on oxen” only, which would have left no room for error, as oxen do not have fleece.",
            "<b>And since the Torah writes</b> “on <b>sheep,”</b> teaching that a sheep may be bought with second-tithe money <b>even</b> together <b>with its fleece, why do I need</b> the words <b>“on oxen”?</b> These words are <b>now</b> entirely superfluous.

            "The Gemara explains the two opinions: <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> the appropriate blessing is: <b>Who creates the fruit of the ground, as it is food.</b> Since heart of palm is edible it is called a fruit, and we recite a blessing over it in the manner of all fruits. <b>And Shmuel said</b> the appropriate blessing is: <b>By Whose word all things came to be.

Rav Yosef thought to say</b> that an <i>eiruv</i> may not be established <b>unless there is</b> a complete <b>meal of this</b> kind of food <b>and</b> a complete <b>meal of that</b> kind of food, meaning that an <i>eiruv</i> may only be established if each meal consists of a single type of food. <b>Rabba said to him:</b> An <i>eiruv</i> may be established with the amount of food required for two meals <b>even</b> if each type of food made up only <b>half, a third, or a quarter</b> of a meal.",
            "The Gemara now examines Rav’s statement <b>itself,</b> which was cited in the course of the previous discussion. <b>Rav said: One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> with two-quarters</b> of a <i>log</i> <b>of wine.</b> The following question may be raised: <b>Do we</b> really <b>need so much?

Additionally, the minimal amount of <b>vinegar</b> that may be used to establish an <i>eiruv</i> is <b>enough to dip</b> the food <b>in it,</b> and the minimal amount of <b>olives and onions</b> is <b>enough to eat them</b> together with the bread. All of these quantities are calculated on the basis of <b>two meals.</b> This <i>baraita</i> clearly indicates that an <i>eiruv</i> may be established with much less than two-quarters of a <i>log</i> of wine.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to cooked wine,</b> which is very strong, and therefore even a small amount suffices.",
            "<b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that the minimal amount of <b>vinegar</b> that may be used for an <i>eiruv</i> <b>is enough to dip</b> food <b>in it.

Some say</b> that <b>Rav Giddel said that Rav said:</b> Enough to dip in it the <b>vegetables that are eaten in two</b> ordinary <b>meals,</b> which is less than the amount consumed in two meals consisting entirely of vegetables.",
            "<b>The Master</b> also <b>said</b> that the minimum measure of <b>olives and onions</b> that may be used for an <i>eiruv</i> is enough <b>to eat them</b> with <b>the food of two meals.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>May one establish an <i>eiruv</i> with onions?

            "The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult.

            "<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person should not eat onion because of</b> the <b>toxins in it. There was an incident with Rabbi Ḥanina, who ate half an onion and half of its toxins, and he fell deathly ill, and his colleagues prayed for mercy for him, and he survived.</b> He was rescued only <b>because the time needed him,</b> as his generation was in need of his teaching, but otherwise he would not have recovered.",
            "<b>Rabbi Zeira said that Shmuel said: One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> with beer, and it invalidates a ritual bath with</b> a measure of <b>three <i>log</i>,</b> similar to drawn water. <b>Rav Kahana strongly objects to this:</b> This is <b>obvious, for what is the difference between this and dye-water?

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> beer is needed to <b>establish an <i>eiruv</i>? Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Yosef, thought to say before Rav Yosef</b> as follows: <b>Two-quarters</b> of a <i>log</i> <b>of beer.</b> Rav Aḥa’s reasoning is now spelled out in detail. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: If <b>one carries out wine</b> on Shabbat from a private domain to a public domain, he is liable if he carries out <b>enough</b> wine <b>for diluting a cup,</b> i.e., enough undiluted wine to fill a cup after it has been diluted with water. <b>And</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught about</b> this mishna: <b>Enough</b> wine <b>for diluting a fine cup.</b> They inquired: <b>What</b> is meant by <b>a fine cup?</b> They answered: <b>A cup of blessing. And Rav Naḥman said that Rabba bar Avuh said: A cup of blessing must contain a quarter of a quarter-</b><i>log</i> of wine, <b>so that</b> after one <b>dilutes</b> the wine with water, <b>it amounts to a</b> full <b>quarter-</b><i>log</i>. <b>And</b> this measure is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rava</b> with regard to the strength of wine, <b>as Rava said: Any wine that is not</b> strong enough to require that it be <b>diluted</b> with <b>three</b> parts <b>water to one</b> part wine <b>is not</b> proper <b>wine.</b>",
            "<b>And we learned in the latter clause</b> of the aforementioned mishna: <b>And</b> one is liable for carrying out <b>all other liquids, and</b> similarly <b>all waste water,</b> in the measure of <b>a quarter-</b><i>log</i>. Now, Rav Aḥa argues as follows: <b>Since there,</b> with respect to liability for carrying on Shabbat, the ratio is <b>one to four,</b> as one is liable for carrying out a quarter of a quarter-<i>log</i> of wine, and one is only liable for carrying out other liquids if one carries out a quarter-<i>log</i>; <b>here, too,</b> with respect to making an <i>eiruv</i>, the ratio of <b>one to four</b> should be maintained. Therefore, since Rav said that two-quarters of a <i>log</i> of wine are required for an <i>eiruv</i>, the minimum amount of beer one may use should be two full <i>log</i>.",
            "The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>And this is not so. There,</b> with regard to carrying on Shabbat, we require four times as much beer as wine because <b>less than that</b> amount, i.e., less than a quarter-<i>log</i> of beer, <b>is insignificant. However, here,</b> with regard to establishing an <i>eiruv</i>, this is <b>not</b> relevant, <b>as it is common for people to drink a cup</b> of beer <b>in the morning and a cup</b> of beer <b>in the evening, and they rely on them</b> as their meals, as beer is satisfying even in such quantities. Therefore, we should require only two-quarters of a <i>log</i> of beer for an <i>eiruv</i>.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>How many dates</b> are needed to establish an <i>eiruv</i>? <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> The minimal amount of <b>dates</b> one may use is <b>a <i>kav</i>. Rav Yosef said: From where do I say this</b> <i>halakha</i>? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one inadvertently <b>ate dried figs</b> of <i>teruma</i>, <b>and paid dates</b> in compensation, <b>may a blessing come upon him.</b>",
            "The Gemara proceeds to clarify this ruling: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If you say</b> that one paid <b>according to the value</b> of the figs he ate, e.g., <b>he ate a <i>zuz</i></b> worth of figs <b>and he paid a <i>zuz</i></b> worth of dates, <b>what is</b> the reason it says: <b>May a blessing come upon him? He ate a <i>zuz</i> and paid a <i>zuz</i>. Rather, is it not</b> that he paid <b>in accordance with the measure</b> of the figs eaten, e.g., that <b>he ate a <i>se’a</i> of dried figs worth one <i>zuz</i>, and he paid a <i>se’a</i> of dates worth four</b> <i>zuz</i>. <b>And it says: May a blessing come upon him. Apparently, dates are superior</b> to dried figs. Accordingly, since we learned above that one may establish an <i>eiruv</i> with a <i>kav</i> of dried figs, a <i>kav</i> of dates should certainly suffice for the purpose of an <i>eiruv</i>.",
            "<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: No proof can be brought from here. It can be argued that <b>he actually ate a <i>zuz</i></b> worth of figs <b>and he paid a <i>zuz</i></b> worth of dates. <b>And what</b> is the reason it says: <b>May a blessing come upon him? For he ate something that buyers are not eager</b> to buy, <b>and he paid him something that buyers are eager</b> to buy. Even though they are equal in value, the priest benefits, for it is easier for him to sell dates than to sell dried figs.",
            "With regard to <b><i>shetita</i>,</b> a dish made of roasted flour and honey, <b>Rav Aḥa bar Pineḥas said: Two large spoonfuls</b> are needed for an <i>eiruv</i>.

            "Having mentioned roasted grain, the Gemara tangentially relates that <b>Abaye said: Mother,</b> actually his foster mother, <b>told me: These roasted grains are good for the heart and drive away</b> worrisome <b>thoughts.</b>",
            "<b>And Abaye said: Mother told me</b> about another remedy. <b>One who suffers from weakness of the heart should</b> go and <b>bring the meat of the right thigh of a ram, and</b> also <b>bring the dung of grazing cattle from</b> the month of <b>Nisan, and if there is no cattle dung he should bring willow twigs, and</b> then <b>roast</b> the meat on a fire made with the dung or twigs, <b>and eat</b> it, <b>and drink afterward</b> some <b>diluted wine.</b> This will improve his condition.",
            "Returning to the matter of quantities of food required for an <i>eiruv</i>, <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The minimum quantity for <b>anything that serves as a relish</b> is <b>enough to eat</b> two meals <b>with it,</b> i.e., enough to serve as a relish for the bread eaten in two meals. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>anything that is not a relish,</b> but rather is a food in its own right, one must use <b>enough to eat</b> two meals <b>of it.</b> The minimum quantity of <b>raw meat</b> is <b>enough to eat</b> two meals <b>of it. Roasted meat</b> is the subject of a dispute: <b>Rabba said: Enough to eat</b> the bread of two meals <b>with it.</b> That is to say, roasted meat is not a food in itself, but rather it serves as relish for other foods. <b>And Rav Yosef said: Enough to eat</b> two meals <b>of it,</b> as it is a food in its own right.",
            "<b>Rav Yosef said: From where do I say this</b> <i>halakha</i>? <b>For these Persians eat pieces of</b> roasted <b>meat [<i>tabahakki</i>] without bread,</b> which shows that meat itself is a food. <b>Abaye said to him: But are the Persians a majority of the world?</b> The <i>halakha</i> follows the customary practice of most of the world and not that of particular locales. <b>Didn’t we learn</b> the following in a <i>baraita</i>? <b>Clothing of the poor,</b> i.e., pieces of cloth measuring three by three fingerbreadths, contracts impurity when in the possession of any <b>poor people</b> because poor people attach importance even to scraps of cloth of such small size. <b>Clothing of the wealthy</b> measuring at least three by three handbreadths contracts impurity in all cases, whether or not it is owned by <b>the wealthy.</b>"

        [
            "<b>But the clothing of the wealthy</b> does <b>not</b> need to be three by three handbreadths in order to become ritually impure <b>for the poor</b> because even smaller pieces of cloth are significant for the poor.

So too, the law of <i>eiruv</i> pertaining to the rest of the world should not be determined by the customary practice of the Persians to eat roasted meat as a food in itself.",
            "<b>And if you say:</b> Both <b>here</b> the ruling is <b>stringent,</b> and <b>there</b> the ruling is <b>stringent,</b> i.e., with regard to ritual impurity the <i>halakha</i> is stringent with respect to the poor and declares scraps of cloth that are only three by three fingerbreadths impure, but with regard to <i>eiruv</i> the <i>halakha</i> requires enough roasted meat to suffice for two meals as a food in its own right, in accordance with the practice of the Persians, then there is a difficulty: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> for an ill or elderly</b> person <b>with</b> an amount of <b>food that is enough for him</b> for two meals, and if he eats less than the average person due to his sickness or age, a smaller amount of food is required in order to establish an <i>eiruv</i> on his behalf; <b>however, for a glutton,</b> we do not require food in an amount that would satisfy him but merely enough food for two meals measured according to <b>an average meal for the typical person?</b> This indicates that the <i>halakha</i> with respect to an <i>eiruv</i> is lenient and not stringent. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, this is <b>difficult.</b>",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty with the aforementioned <i>baraita</i>: <b>Did Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar</b> really <b>say this?

If the corpse can fit through some of the openings but not through others, only the larger openings are ritually impure. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says that in the case of a giant the size of Og, king of the Bashan, one opening can only prevent the others from contracting impurity if it is large enough for Og’s corpse to fit through. This indicates that the law is determined by the measure of each particular person and not by some general measure.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what does <b>Abaye</b> say? How does he reconcile his position with regard to an <i>eiruv</i>, which maintains that we follow the customary practice of most of the world and not that of particular locales, with Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar’s ruling with regard to the corpse of a giant? The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of a giant, <b>what should we do? Should we cut</b> the corpse <b>into pieces and carry it out?</b> We have no choice but to carry it out through an opening large enough for the corpse to pass through. However, in the case of the food for the two meals of an <i>eiruv</i>, there is no such logistical constraint, and the law should be determined in accordance with the usual practice.",
            "<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>Do the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, or not?

This indicates that the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar.",
            "The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>There,</b> we are dealing with a case <b>where there are many small openings, and there is</b> only <b>one that is four</b> handbreadths wide.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> in the case of <b><i>teruma</i> as well, one can ask</b> a Sage to annul <b>its</b> status. <i>Teruma</i> is consecrated through a verbal declaration by the one separating it, and that declaration, like other consecrations and vows, can be nullified by a Sage. The Gemara answers: Such a course of action would not help. <b>If one asks</b> a Sage to annul his declaration that turned the produce into <i>teruma</i>, the produce <b>will return to</b> its status as <b><i>tevel</i>,</b> produce from which the requisite dues and tithes were not separated, and he will still be prohibited to consume it.",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> makes it <b>necessary</b> to say that the mishna is referring to this very unique case? <b>Rather,</b> we must retract all that was stated above and say as follows: <b>Summakhos agrees with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say: Anything that is</b> prohibited on Shabbat <b>due to a rabbinic decree [<i>shevut</i>],</b> the Sages <b>issued the decree</b> to apply even <b>during twilight.</b> Even though this period is of questionable status with regard to whether it is day or night, the Shabbat restrictions instituted by the Sages apply then as they do on Shabbat itself. Consequently, since it is prohibited to separate <i>teruma</i> on Shabbat, it is prohibited during the twilight period as well. Therefore, during twilight, when the <i>eiruv</i> would go into effect, it is impossible to cause it to become permitted to an Israelite.",

            "We learned in the mishna: One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>for a priest in a <i>beit haperas</i>,</b> an area in which there is doubt concerning the location of a grave or a corpse. The Gemara explains that the reason for this is as <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> In a time of need <b>a person may blow</b> on the dust in a <b><i>beit haperas</i></b> before taking each step, so that if there is a bone beneath the dust he will expose it and avoid it, <b>and</b> he may thus <b>walk</b> across the area. Similarly, <b>Rabbi Yehuda bar Ami said in the name of Rav Yehuda: A <i>beit haperas</i> that has been trodden</b> underfoot, creating a path, <b>is pure,</b> as we assume that it no longer contains any bones as large as a kernel of barley. Both of these statements indicate that the ritual impurity of a <i>beit haperas</i> is a stringency decreed by the Sages. Therefore, since there is a way to avoid becoming ritually impure there, even a priest may place his <i>eiruv</i> in a <i>beit haperas</i>.",
            "We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> An <i>eiruv</i> may be established for a priest <b>even</b> in <b>a cemetery,</b> an area which the priest may not enter by Torah law. <b>It was taught:</b> This is permitted <b>because</b> the priest <b>can interpose and walk</b> between the graves inside <b>a carriage, a crate, or a cupboard.</b> These containers do not contract impurity because of their large size, and anything found inside of them remains pure. From here we see that <b>he holds</b> the following: <b>A moving tent is called a tent,</b> and therefore the carriage, box, or cupboard are also considered tents. They shield a person carried in them from the impurity imparted by the graves in a cemetery.",
            "The Gemara notes that this matter is the subject of <b>a dispute between the following <i>tanna’im</i>, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who enters the land of the nations,</b> i.e., any territory outside Eretz Yisrael, not on foot, but <b>in a carriage, a crate, or a cupboard, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>renders</b> him ritually <b>impure.

            "The Gemara explains: <b>With regard to what do they disagree?

The Gemara answers: We are dealing here with a case <b>where</b> the <i>teruma</i> <b>had not yet been rendered susceptible</b> to ritual impurity, as it had not yet come into contact with a liquid. Produce that has yet to come into contact with a liquid does not contract impurity. <b>Or</b> we are dealing with bread <b>that was kneaded with fruit juice,</b> which is not one of the seven liquids that render a food susceptible to ritual impurity.",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>Doesn’t</b> the utensil <b>cover</b> the grave?

            "The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> that is <b>so,</b> and there is a way for the <i>teruma</i> to remain ritually pure and for the priest to access it, <b>what is the reason</b> the Sages disagreed with Rabbi Yehuda and did not allow an <i>eiruv</i> to be established for a priest on a grave? The Gemara answers: <b>They hold</b> that <b>it is prohibited to acquire a home with items from which benefit is prohibited.</b> It is prohibited to derive benefit from a grave. Since one acquires a place of residence for Shabbat by means of the <i>eiruv</i>, it would be as if the priest acquired a home for himself with something from which he may not derive benefit.",

Abaye answers: <b>This</b> produce, which has been threshed and placed into piles, is completely processed and <b>has become grain, and that</b> produce, which remained on the stalks, <b>did not</b> yet <b>become grain.</b> The wording of the biblical verses indicates that the requirement to separate <i>teruma</i> applies only to grain, whereas the produce is not considered grain until it has been threshed.",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rav Naḥman,</b> who holds that with respect to Torah laws we may not rely on the presumption that an agent fulfills his agency, refute this proof?

However, an ordinary <b>agent,</b> who is not as diligent, is only presumed to have completed his mission by the end of <b>the entire day.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Sheshet said: From where do I say</b> my opinion? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A woman who is responsible</b> to offer sacrifices following <b>childbirth or</b> after experiencing <b><i>ziva</i></b> (Leviticus 12, 15) <b>brings money and puts it in</b> the appropriate collection <b>box</b> in the Temple, <b>immerses</b> in a ritual bath, <b>and</b> she may then <b>eat sacrificial food at nightfall.

We may rely only on the special court appointed to carry out this task, as it can be trusted. However, no proof may be brought from here with regard to an ordinary agent.",
            "<b>Rav Sheshet said</b> another proof: <b>From where do I say this?

            "<b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> The fact that one must bring his <i>eiruv</i> the day before to the spot that he wishes to establish as his place of residence, and the potential to bring it there does not suffice, is <b>a decree due to a Festival that occurs after Shabbat.</b> In that case, the <i>eiruv</i> is valid for the Festival only if it was brought there before Shabbat, for it cannot be carried there on Shabbat. Since one cannot actually bring the <i>eiruv</i> there, it cannot be said: It is considered as though he did bring it there because had he wished to bring the <i>eiruv</i> he could have. Consequently, the Sages decreed that in all cases, the <i>eiruv</i> is only valid if it was actually brought to the designated spot, lest one come to think that even on a Festival that occurs after Shabbat it need not be brought there.",

            "<b>Why</b> should this be so? <b>Here too, let us say</b> that his <i>eiruv</i> should be valid even if it was placed below ten handbreadths, <b>since one can tilt</b> the cupboard <b>and bring it to within ten</b> handbreadths from the ground, in which case he and his <i>eiruv</i> would be in the same domain. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said: Here, we are dealing with a cupboard that is nailed</b> to the wall so that it cannot be tilted.",

Rather, in that case there is a unique <b>decree lest he break</b> it <b>off</b> from the ground if the reed is relatively soft.

If, however, the key is found <b>in a field, his <i>eiruv</i> is not a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i>, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> due to the prohibition to carry in a <i>karmelit</i>.

            "The discussion above constitutes one understanding of the mishna. <b>Rabba and Rav Yosef,</b> however, <b>both said: Here, we are dealing with a wooden cupboard,</b> and the <i>tanna’im</i> disagree with regard to the following point: <b>The</b> first, anonymous <b>Sage,</b> who rules that the <i>eiruv</i> is valid, <b>holds</b> that the cupboard <b>is a utensil, and</b> that <b>there is no</b> prohibited labor of <b>building utensils, and</b> similarly, <b>there is no dismantling of utensils.</b> Since dismantling a utensil is not included in the prohibited labor of dismantling, one may make a hole in the cupboard in order to access the food used for the <i>eiruv</i>. <b>And</b> the other <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Eliezer, who invalidates the <i>eiruv</i>, <b>holds</b> that the cupboard <b>is a tent.</b> A wooden implement of such a large size is no longer classified as a utensil; rather, it is considered a building, and therefore it is subject to the prohibitions against building and dismantling on Shabbat.",
            "<b>And</b> their dispute is parallel to <b>the dispute between these <i>tanna’im</i>, as we learned</b> in a mishna with regard to the ritual impurity of a <i>zav</i>: One of the unique laws of a <i>zav</i> is that he imparts impurity to an object simply by moving it, even if he does not touch it directly. If a <i>zav</i> <b>knocked on a carriage, crate, or cupboard,</b> even if he did not actually come into direct contact with them, <b>they are</b> nonetheless ritually <b>impure</b> because he caused them to move when he struck them. <b>Rabbi Neḥemya and Rabbi Shimon</b> disagree and <b>render</b> them <b>pure.</b>",
            "<b>What, are they not disagreeing about this</b> point: <b>The</b> first <b>Sage holds</b> that a carriage, crate, or cupboard <b>is</b> categorized as <b>a utensil,</b> and therefore it contracts ritual impurity when a <i>zav</i> causes it to move; <b>and the</b> other <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Neḥemya and Rabbi Shimon, <b>holds</b> that <b>it is a tent,</b> and a building does not contract ritual impurity in any way from a <i>zav</i>?",
            "<b>Abaye said</b> in refutation of this proof: <b>And</b> do <b>you think</b> that this is a reasonable explanation of the mishna? <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a <i>zav</i> shook a real <b>tent, and it moved, it is</b> ritually <b>impure;</b> and if he shook <b>a utensil and it did not move, it is</b> ritually <b>pure?</b> This indicates that the critical factor is not whether the article is classified as a tent or as a utensil but whether or not it actually moves when shaken. Furthermore, <b>it was taught in the latter clause</b> of that <i>baraita</i>: <b>And if they moved, they are</b> ritually <b>impure,</b> and <b>this is the principle:</b> If a utensil or a tent <b>moved due to the</b> direct <b>force</b> of the <i>zav</i>, <b>it is</b> ritually <b>impure.</b> But if it moved <b>due to vibrations,</b> e.g., if the <i>zav</i> knocked on the floor or on the platform upon which the object is located, and the vibrations of the floor or the platform caused the object to move, <b>it is</b> ritually <b>pure,</b> as it was not moved by the direct force of the <i>zav</i>. Once again, the determining factor is not the object’s classification as a tent or a utensil but whether it was actually moved by the <i>zav</i>.",
            "<b>Rather, Abaye said</b> that the dispute between the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Neḥemya and Rabbi Shimon should be understood as follows: <b>All</b> agree that <b>movement due to</b> the direct <b>force</b> of the <i>zav</i> causes the object to become ritually <b>impure,</b> whether it is a tent or a utensil.

And here, we are dealing with</b> a case where the object <b>vibrated because of</b> the direct <b>force</b> of the <i>zav</i>, i.e., where he banged upon the object itself, causing it to vibrate but not to move. <b>And</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree with regard to the following</b> point: <b>The</b> first <b>Sage holds</b> that this, too, <b>is</b> considered <b>movement; and the</b> other <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Neḥemya and Rabbi Shimon, <b>holds</b> that vibration <b>is not</b> considered <b>movement.</b> Therefore, Abaye rejects Rabba and Rav Yosef’s proof for their explanation of the mishna.",
            "The Gemara therefore proceeds to ask: If so, <b>how is the mishna</b> with regard to <i>eiruv</i> <b>to be interpreted?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Abaye and Rava both said: We are dealing</b> here <b>with a lock</b> that is <b>tied with a leather strap, and a knife is required to cut it</b> if there is no key.",

            "<b>And Rabbi Eliezer holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Neḥemya, who said: Even a cloak,</b> and <b>even a spoon,</b> which are certainly used only for activities permitted on Shabbat, <b>may be moved</b> on Shabbat <b>only for the purpose of their</b> ordinary <b>use.</b> The same applies to a knife, which may be moved only in order to cut food, but not for any other purpose. Consequently, one cannot cut the strap around the lock of the cupboard, and therefore his <i>eiruv</i> is invalid unless the key is located in town and he can transport it via courtyards.",

Due to the uncertainty concerning his Shabbat border, he must act stringently, as though his resting place were both in his town and at the location where he placed the <i>eiruv</i>. He must restrict his Shabbat movement to those areas that are within two thousand cubits of both locations.",

            "The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Even if you say</b> that the mishna <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, we can say that this ruling <b>was necessary only</b> in a case <b>where a hoe or a spade would be required</b> in order to remove the <i>eiruv</i> from under the stones, i.e., one would have to dig, which is a Shabbat labor prohibited by Torah law, not only by rabbinic decree.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> both rulings, the ruling concerning an <i>eiruv</i> that rolled beyond the Shabbat limit and the ruling concerning an <i>eiruv</i> that became buried under a pile of rocks, <b>are necessary.

Didn’t we learn</b> the following in a mishna: If a ritually <b>impure</b> person <b>descended to immerse</b> in a ritual bath, and there is <b>doubt</b> whether he actually <b>immersed or he did not immerse; and even if he</b> certainly <b>immersed,</b> there is <b>doubt</b> whether he <b>immersed in</b> a ritual bath containing <b>forty <i>se’a</i></b> of water, the minimal amount of water necessary for the ritual bath to be valid, <b>or he did not immerse in forty <i>se’a</i>; and similarly,</b> if there are <b>two</b> adjacent <b>ritual baths, one</b> of which <b>has forty <i>se’a</i></b> of water <b>in it</b> and is therefore valid, <b>and one</b> of which <b>does not have forty <i>se’a</i></b> of water <b>in it, and he immersed in one of them, but he does not know in which of them he immersed;</b> in each of these cases, owing to <b>one’s doubt, he</b> remains ritually <b>impure?</b>",
            "<b>In what case is this statement,</b> which maintains that in cases of doubt one is considered impure, <b>said?</b> It is said <b>with regard to severe</b> forms of ritual <b>impurity,</b> i.e., those imparted by a primary source of ritual impurity.",
            "<b>However, with regard to lenient</b> forms of ritual <b>impurity</b> imposed only by rabbinic decree, <b>such as one who ate</b> half a half-loaf of <b>impure foods; and</b> similarly, <b>one who drank impure liquids; and one whose head and most of his body came under drawn water,</b> as opposed to spring water or rainwater, in which case the Sages decreed that person to be ritually impure; <b>or if three <i>log</i> of drawn water fell on one’s head and most of his body,</b> in which case the Sages also decreed that person to be impure; <b>and</b> if in any of these cases <b>one descended to immerse</b> himself in a ritual bath to purify himself of the rabbinically decreed impurity, and there is <b>doubt</b> whether he actually <b>immersed or he did not immerse; and even if he</b> certainly <b>immersed,</b> there is <b>doubt</b> whether he <b>immersed in forty <i>se’a</i></b> of water <b>or he did not immerse in forty <i>se’a</i>; and similarly,</b> if there were <b>two ritual baths, one</b> of which <b>has forty <i>se’a</i></b> of water <b>in it and one</b> of which <b>does not have forty <i>se’a</i></b> of water <b>in it, and he immersed in one of them, but he does not know in which of them he immersed;</b> in all of these cases, owing to <b>his doubt, he is</b> ritually <b>pure.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Yosei</b> disagrees and <b>renders him</b> ritually <b>impure.</b> In any event, it is clear that, according to the unattributed mishna, which is generally presumed to reflect the opinion of Rabbi Meir, the <i>halakha</i> is lenient in cases of doubt relating to ritual impurity that is due to rabbinic decree. Why, then, doesn’t Rabbi Meir agree that we should be lenient in cases of doubt relating to an <i>eiruv</i>, which is also of rabbinic origin?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Meir holds</b> that the prohibitions relating to Shabbat <b>limits are</b> prohibited <b>by Torah law,</b> and therefore the uncertainties in the mishna involve a Torah prohibition, with regard to which one may not be lenient.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Does Rabbi Meir</b> really <b>hold</b> that the prohibitions of Shabbat <b>limits are</b> prohibited <b>by Torah law? Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: When taking measurements related to Shabbat boundaries, if a fifty-cubit rope is held at either end by two people, the distance between them is deemed to be fifty cubits, even if the distance on the ground is greater, owing to inclines and depressions? If there is a hill or incline between them that <b>cannot be swallowed</b> by the fifty-cubit measuring rope, so that the usual mode of measurement cannot be used, <b>in this</b> situation, <b>Rabbi Dostai said in the name of Rabbi Meir: I heard that we pierce mountains,</b> i.e., we measure the distance as if there were a hole from one side of the hill to the other, so that in effect we measure only the horizontal distance and ignore the differences in elevation.",
            "<b>And if it should enter your mind</b> to say that the prohibitions relating to Shabbat <b>limits are</b> prohibited <b>by Torah law, would</b> it be permitted to <b>pierce the mountains?

            "The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as there is no contradiction between the two statements. <b>This</b> statement, according to which Shabbat limits are by Torah law, <b>is his; that</b> statement, in which he is lenient, <b>is his teacher’s.</b> The language of the mishna <b>is also precise</b> according to this explanation, <b>as we learned: In this</b> case, <b>Rabbi Dostai bar Yannai said in the name of Rabbi Meir: I have heard that we pierce mountains.</b> This formulation indicates that Rabbi Meir did not state his own opinion. Rather, he transmitted a ruling that he had heard from his teacher, even though he did not agree with it himself. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>conclude from this</b> that this resolution is correct.",
            "The Gemara continues: There is still room <b>to raise a contradiction</b> between one ruling with regard to <b>Torah law and</b> another ruling with regard to <b>Torah law, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b>",
            "<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: If one <b>touched one</b> other person <b>at night, and he does not know whether</b> the person he touched was <b>alive or dead, and the following day he arose and found him dead,</b> and he is in doubt as to whether or not he contracted ritual impurity as a result of having come into contact with a corpse, <b>Rabbi Meir renders him</b> ritually <b>pure.</b> It is assumed that the deceased was still alive until the point that it is known with certainty that he is dead. <b>And the Rabbis render him</b> ritually <b>impure because</b> it is assumed that <b>all</b> ritually <b>impure</b> items had already been in the same state as they were <b>at the time they were discovered.</b> Just as the deceased was found dead in the morning, so too, it may be presumed that he was dead when he was touched in the middle of the night. Therefore, Rabbi Meir is lenient even with respect to an uncertainty relating to a Torah law, and he holds that a person is presumed to be alive until it is known with certainty that he died. Why, then, is he stringent concerning doubt as to whether the <i>eiruv</i> had already become impure on the previous day or only after nightfall? Here too, one should assume that the <i>eiruv</i> is ritually pure until he knows with certainty that it became defiled, and so the <i>eiruv</i> should be valid, even if Shabbat limits are considered Torah law.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said: The mishna</b> is referring to a case <b>where a creeping animal</b> that imparts ritual impurity <b>was on</b> the <i>teruma</i> that was used to establish the <i>eiruv</i> <b>for the entire twilight</b> period. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, in that case, would Rabbi Yosei say</b> that <b>an <i>eiruv</i></b> whose validity is <b>in doubt is valid?</b> There is no uncertainty in this case.",
            "It was <b>Rabba and Rav Yosef who both said:</b> The doubt here does not result from the facts of the case themselves, but from conflicting testimonies and an inability to decide between them. <b>Here, we are dealing with two sets of witnesses, one</b> of which <b>says:</b> The <i>teruma</i> <b>became impure while it was still day,</b> before the onset of Shabbat; <b>and one</b> of which <b>says:</b> The <i>teruma</i> became impure only <b>after nightfall.</b>"

        [
            "<b>Rava said:</b> That is not the way to resolve the apparent contradiction between the two rulings; rather, there is a difference between the cases with regard to the ritual impurity itself: <b>There,</b> with regard to touching a person who was later found dead, there are <b>two presumptions</b> supporting <b>leniency,</b> whereas <b>here,</b> with respect to the <i>teruma</i> being used for an <i>eiruv</i>, there is only <b>one presumption</b> supporting <b>leniency.</b> How so? With regard to one who touched another person who was later found to be dead, there are two presumptions of purity: Firstly, the person who was found dead was previously alive, and the presumption is that he remained in that state until we know with certainty that he was dead. Secondly, the one who touched that person was previously pure, and he remains in that presumptive state until we know with certainty that he became impure. Therefore, Rabbi Meir had adequate reason to be lenient. However, with regard to <i>teruma</i>, only one presumption exists, that the <i>teruma</i> was previously pure and presumably remained in that state until proven otherwise. Since there is no additional presumption, Rabbi Meir ruled stringently.",
            "All the difficulties raised above are based on the seemingly conflicting statements of Rabbi Meir. Yet it would appear that there is also <b>a contradiction between</b> one statement of <b>Rabbi Yosei and</b> another statement of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> for he was stringent with regard to the doubts involving ritual baths but lenient with regard to doubts involving <i>eiruv</i>.",
            "<b>Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana said:</b> The law with regard to ritual <b>impurity is different, since it has a basis in the Torah.</b> Therefore, Rabbi Yosei was stringent even with respect to immersion performed in order to remove impurity that is only of rabbinic origin.

The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Yosei holds:</b> The laws of Shabbat <b>limits</b> are by <b>rabbinic</b> law, not by Torah law.",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>This</b> stringent ruling <b>is his; that</b> lenient ruling with regard to an <i>eiruv</i> <b>is his teacher’s.</b> The Gemara comments: The language of the mishna <b>is also precise</b> according to this explanation, <b>as we learned</b> in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yosei said:</b> The Sage <b>Avtolemos testified in the name of five Elders that an <i>eiruv</i></b> whose validity is <b>in doubt is valid.</b> This formulation indicates that Rabbi Yosei was merely reporting a ruling that he had heard from his teacher, although he may not have accepted it.

            "The Gemara clarifies: The question may <b>be asked according to</b> the stringent opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> and it may <b>be asked according to</b> the lenient opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b> The question may <b>be asked according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir</b> in the following manner: Perhaps <b>Rabbi Meir only stated</b> his stringent opinion with regard to a questionable <i>eiruv</i> <b>there, where there is no</b> <i>teruma</i> that is definitely <b>pure</b> present, but only <i>teruma</i> whose purity is in doubt. <b>Here,</b> however, <b>there</b> definitely <b>is a pure</b> loaf, and therefore even Rabbi Meir may agree to rule leniently. <b>Or perhaps</b> it may be argued that <b>even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, he only said</b> that we are lenient with regard to an <i>eiruv</i> whose validity is in doubt in the case dealt with <b>there,</b> where, <b>if indeed</b> the <i>teruma</i> <b>is pure, he knows</b> where <b>it</b> is; <b>but here, he does not know</b> how to identify <b>it.</b>",

One may rely on the principle of retroactive designation and say that when he is finished drinking, the wine that is left becomes retroactively designated as <i>teruma</i> and tithes, such that the wine he drank was permitted for consumption. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> However, <b>Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Yosei, and Rabbi Shimon prohibit</b> drinking the wine in this manner. Therefore, it would appear that Rabbi Yehuda rejects the principle of retroactive designation, contrary to the ruling of the mishna and in accordance with the opinion of Ayo.",
            "<b>Ulla</b> also took note of this contradiction between the statements of Rabbi Yehuda, but he <b>said</b> the opposite: The statement of <b>Ayo</b> should <b>not</b> be accepted <b>because</b> it contradicts what is stated in <b>the mishna.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But that which was taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Yosei, and Rabbi Shimon prohibit</b> drinking the wine in this manner, indicates, as was demonstrated above, that Rabbi Yehuda rejects the principle of retroactive designation.",
            "<b>Ulla taught</b> the names of the authorities mentioned in the <i>Tosefta</i> dealing with wine <b>in pairs,</b> as follows: The allowance mentioned in the <i>Tosefta</i> is according to <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda,</b> whereas <b>Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon prohibit</b> drinking the wine in this manner. Therefore, Rabbi Yehuda agrees with Rabbi Meir and accepts the principle of retroactive designation, in accordance with the mishna.",
            "To this point, it has been accepted that Rabbi Yosei clearly prohibits the procedure described in the <i>Tosefta</i>. Therefore, he apparently rejects the principle of retroactive designation. With regard to this point, the Gemara asks: <b>Does Rabbi Yosei</b> really <b>hold that there is no retroactive designation? Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna elsewhere that <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> If <b>two women took their birds’ nests,</b> pairs of turtledoves or pigeons as purification offerings following childbirth, <b>jointly</b> and without specifying which pair of birds was for which woman, <b>or</b> if <b>they gave their birds’ nests to a priest</b> but did not inform him which birds were consecrated as sin-offerings and which as burnt-offerings, <b>whichever the priest wishes he may offer as a burnt-offering, and whichever he wishes he may offer as a sin-offering.</b> Therefore, Rabbi Yosei must accept the principle of retroactive designation, such that when the priest offers any of the birds as a sacrifice, it is retroactively clarified that the bird had been selected for that woman and as that sacrifice.",
            "<b>Rabba said:</b> There is no proof from there, with regard to retroactive designation, as the mishna <b>there</b> deals with a special case, <b>where</b> the women <b>stipulated</b> from the outset that the priest would decide which bird would be offered for which woman and as what sacrifice.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so, what</b> need was there for the mishna <b>to say</b> anything? If they made an explicit stipulation to that effect, then the priest certainly has the power to fulfill their condition. The Gemara answers: The mishna nonetheless <b>teaches us</b> that the law is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥisda, as Rav Ḥisda said: Birds’ nests become designated</b> as burnt-offerings or sin-offerings <b>only</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>when they are purchased by their owner,</b> if the owner explicitly consecrated it as a burnt-offering or sin-offering when he purchased it, <b>or through the actions of the priest</b> when he offers the birds as sacrifices. Therefore, even if the women did not verbalize their intentions, it is considered as if they had made a stipulation from the outset. Therefore, this case is not an instance of retroactive designation.",
            "<b>And still</b> the question may be raised: Does <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> really <b>hold</b> that <b>there is no retroactive designation? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>an <i>am ha’aretz</i>,</b> who is not known to be scrupulous in separating tithes, <b>said to a <i>ḥaver</i>,</b> one known to be meticulous in his observance of <i>halakha</i> and especially the laws of <i>teruma</i> and tithes, before the <i>ḥaver</i> went to the market to buy himself vegetables from another <i>am ha’aretz</i>: <b>Buy for me</b> as well <b>a bundle of vegetables or a cake [<i>geluska</i>],</b> the <i>ḥaver</i> <b>does not need to tithe</b> the food that he gives to the <i>am ha’aretz</i>. The only reason the food needs to be tithed is because it is <i>demai</i>, and an <i>am ha’aretz</i> is not particular about that issue. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei.</b> It can be deduced from this ruling that Rabbi Yosei accepts the principle of retroactive designation, as the <i>ḥaver</i> purchased bundles of vegetables without specifying which was for himself and which was for the <i>am ha’aretz</i>, and when he gave one to the <i>am ha’aretz</i>, it became retroactively clear that he had purchased that bundle for the <i>am ha’aretz</i> from the start, and therefore he does not need to separate tithes from it as <i>demai</i>.",
            "<b>And the Rabbis say: He must tithe</b> it. Since we do not accept the principle of retroactive designation, everything that the <i>ḥaver</i> bought was bought for himself, and the fact that he later gave part of it to the <i>am ha’aretz</i> does not exempt him from his original obligation to separate tithes from the <i>demai</i>. In any case, it seems that Rabbi Yosei’s opinion in this <i>baraita</i> contradicts his opinion in the <i>Tosefta</i> cited above with regard to wine. The Gemara answers: <b>Reverse</b> the opinions in the <i>baraita</i> and say that according to Rabbi Yosei he must tithe the produce he gives to the <i>am ha’aretz</i>, while the Rabbis permit him to proceed without tithing.",
            "The Gemara attempts to bring another proof. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a different <i>Tosefta</i>: In the case of <b>one who says:</b> The second <b>tithe that I have in my house shall be redeemed upon the <i>sela</i></b> coin <b>that will</b> happen to <b>come up in my hand</b> when I remove it <b>from the pouch,</b> i.e., he did not have a particular coin in mind, <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The second tithe <b>is redeemed.</b> When the coin is removed from the pouch, it is retroactively clarified that this is the coin that he had in his mind from the outset. This indicates that Rabbi Yosei accepts the principle of retroactive designation.",
            "The Gemara answers again: <b>Reverse</b> the attributions, and <b>say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: He has not redeemed</b> the second tithe. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>What did you see that you reversed two</b> sources <b>because of one,</b> and made the two <i>baraitot</i> conform to the mishna, which indicates that Rabbi Yosei holds that there is no retroactive designation? Perhaps <b>I should reverse one</b> source, i.e., the mishna, <b>because of</b> the <b>two</b> <i>baraitot</i> and say that in fact Rabbi Yosei accepts the principle of retroactive designation, and it is the lone source that indicates otherwise that must be revised.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> <i>Tosefta</i> was <b>certainly taught in reverse,</b> as <b>the latter clause states: And Rabbi Yosei concedes with regard to one who says: The</b> second <b>tithe that I have in my house shall be redeemed with the new <i>sela</i></b> coin <b>that will</b> happen to <b>come up in my hand</b> when I remove it <b>from the pouch, that he has redeemed</b> the second tithe. The Gemara makes the following inference: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that it said here that he has redeemed</b> the second tithe, it can be proven <b>by inference that there,</b> in the first clause of the <i>Tosefta</i>, <b>he did not redeem</b> the second tithe. Therefore, the wording found in the earlier part of the <i>baraita</i> is clearly incorrect and must be reversed.",
            "The Gemara raises a question with regard to the <i>halakha</i> cited in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>This new <i>sela</i>, what are its circumstances? If</b> it is referring to a situation <b>where there are two</b> or <b>three</b> coins in his pouch, so that it is not clear which coin he is referring to, <b>and there is</b> the possibility of <b>retroactive designation, this is</b> exactly the same as <b>the first</b> case. Why does he rule here, as opposed to the earlier case, that there is retroactive designation? <b>Rather,</b> it must refer to a situation <b>where he has only one</b> coin in his pouch. But if so, <b>what</b> is the meaning of the expression: <b>Will</b> happen to <b>come up?</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: In fact, it is referring to a case where one has only one coin in his pouch, and the wording of the latter clause is imprecise. <b>Since the first clause taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> using this expression: <b>Will</b> happen to <b>come up, the latter clause also taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> using this same expression: <b>Will</b> happen to <b>come up,</b> even though he was referring to the only new coin that he has in his pouch.",
            "<b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman: Who is this <i>tanna</i></b> who <b>does not accept</b> the principle of <b>retroactive designation even concerning rabbinic decrees?

The Gemara answers: <b>He did not accept</b> Ayo’s version of Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion and considered it incorrect.",
            "<b>Rav Yosef said,</b> in his unique style: Have <b>you removed the <i>tanna’im</i> from the world?</b> Is there no <i>tanna</i> who holds this position? The possibility of retroactive designation with regard to rabbinic enactments <b>is</b> a dispute among <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One said: <b>I am hereby establishing an <i>eiruv</i> for the <i>Shabbatot</i> of the entire year,</b> so that <b>if I want</b> to make use of it, <b>I will</b> be able to <b>walk</b> two thousand cubits from the <i>eiruv</i>, and <b>if I do not want</b> to do so, <b>I will not walk.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>Didn’t we hear that Rabbi Shimon does not accept</b> the principle of <b>retroactive designation</b> in the case of wine from <i>Kutim</i>?

            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the difficulty</b> here? <b>Perhaps it is with regard to Torah law that Rabbi Shimon does not accept</b> the principle of <b>retroactive designation, but with regard to rabbinic</b> decrees, <b>he does accept</b> the principle of retroactive designation.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Yosef holds</b> that <b>one who accepts</b> the principle of <b>retroactive designation accepts it</b> in all cases; <b>there is no difference</b> between <b>Torah law and rabbinic</b> decrees. <b>And one who does not accept</b> the principle of <b>retroactive designation does not accept it</b> at all; <b>there is no difference</b> between <b>Torah law and rabbinic</b> decrees.",

            "Rava refutes this argument: <b>There,</b> with regard to a pile of produce, <b>it is different because there are</b> recognizable remnants <b>around it.</b> He specified that the <i>teruma</i> should be inside the heap, which indicates that it is in the middle of the pile, and therefore the produce on the perimeter of the pile is certainly not <i>teruma</i>, and some of the remnants of the act of separation are recognizable.",

            "The Gemara relates that <b>when Rav Huna,</b> Rav’s preeminent student, <b>passed away, Rav Ḥisda entered</b> the study hall <b>to raise a contradiction between</b> one statement of <b>Rav and</b> another statement of <b>Rav: Did Rav</b> actually <b>say:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the four Elders and in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who said</b> that when Shabbat and a Festival fall out on consecutive days, <b>they</b> constitute <b>two</b> distinct <b>sanctities?</b>",
            "<b>Wasn’t it stated</b> that with regard to a case where <b>Shabbat and a Festival</b> occur on consecutive days, <b>Rav said:</b> An egg that <b>was laid on one is prohibited on the other,</b> just as an egg that was laid on a Festival day is prohibited on that same day? This statement indicates that the two days constitute a single sanctity. How, then, can he say here that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion that they are two distinct sanctities?",
            "<b>Rabba said</b> that a distinction may be drawn between the cases: <b>There,</b> the egg is prohibited on the second day not because the two days constitute a single sanctity but <b>because of</b> the prohibition against <b>preparation,</b> i.e., because it is prohibited to prepare things on a Festival for Shabbat or on Shabbat for a Festival.",
            "<b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse that states: <b>“And it shall come to pass, on the sixth day, when they shall prepare</b> that which they bring in” (Exodus 16:5), indicates as follows: On an ordinary <b>weekday one may prepare</b> what is needed <b>for Shabbat, and</b> similarly, on an ordinary <b>weekday one may prepare</b> what is needed <b>for a Festival.</b> However, on <b>a Festival one may not prepare for Shabbat, and</b> on <b>Shabbat one may not prepare for a Festival.</b> Therefore, an egg that was laid on a Festival is prohibited on Shabbat not because they constitute a single sanctity, but because it is prohibited to prepare on one sanctified day for another.",
            "<b>Abaye said to him: But</b> what about <b>that which we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>What does he do</b> if a Festival occurs on Friday, and he wishes to establish an <i>eiruv</i> that will be valid for the Festival and Shabbat? <b>He</b> or his agent <b>takes</b> the <i>eiruv</i> to the spot that he wishes to establish as his residence <b>on</b> the eve of <b>the first</b> day, <b>and he stays</b> there <b>with it until nightfall, and</b> then <b>he takes it</b> with him <b>and goes away.

            "<b>Rabba said to him: Do you think that the <i>eiruv</i> acquires</b> one’s residence <b>at the end of the day,</b> i.e., at the last moment of Shabbat eve, which in this case is a Festival, so that this would involve prohibited preparation? <b>The <i>eiruv</i> acquires</b> his residence <b>at the beginning of the day,</b> i.e., at the first moment of Shabbat, which means that no preparations were made for Shabbat on the Festival, <b>and</b> on <b>Shabbat</b> one may <b>prepare for</b> Shabbat <b>itself.</b>",
            "Abaye asked: <b>But if that is so, one should</b> be able to <b>establish an <i>eiruv</i> with flasks</b> of wine that were filled from a barrel of first-tithe that was still <i>tevel</i> with respect to <i>teruma</i> of the tithe, and with regard to which one said: Let this wine in the flask be <i>teruma</i> of the tithe for the wine in the barrel only after nightfall. If you say that an <i>eiruv</i> acquires one’s residence at the beginning of the day, why was it determined that one may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> with such wine?",
            "The Gemara answers: In that case the <i>eiruv</i> is not valid for a different reason: <b>We require a meal that is fit</b> to be eaten <b>while it is still day, and there is none,</b> as the wine in the flask remains <i>tevel</i> and therefore unfit for drinking until nightfall.",
            "Abaye asked further: <b>But</b> what about <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> If <b>a Festival is adjacent to Shabbat, whether before it or after it, a person may establish two <i>eiruvin</i>.</b> Why are these <i>eiruvin</i> valid? <b>Don’t we require a meal that is fit</b> to be eaten <b>while it is still day, and there is none?</b> Since one established his <i>eiruv</i> in one direction for the first day, he can only travel within a two-thousand-cubit radius of that location. Therefore, if he established his <i>eiruv</i> for the second day in the opposite direction, he cannot access that <i>eiruv</i> during the first day.",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>Do you think that</b> we are dealing with a case where <b>he placed</b> one <i>eiruv</i> in the furthest possible spot <b>at the end of two thousand cubits in this</b> direction, <b>and</b> he placed the other <i>eiruv</i> in the furthest possible spot <b>at the end of two thousand cubits in that</b> direction, and he is therefore unable to go from one to the other on one day? <b>No,</b> the case is <b>that he placed</b> one <i>eiruv</i> <b>at the end of one thousand cubits in the this direction, and</b> he placed the other <i>eiruv</i> <b>at the end of one thousand cubits in that</b> direction, so that even after acquiring his residence on one side of the town by means of the first <i>eiruv</i>, he can still go to the spot where he left the other <i>eiruv</i> for the second day.",
            "Abaye raised yet another difficulty: <b>But</b> what about <b>that</b> which <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> If <b>one established an <i>eiruv</i> with his feet</b> for the <b>first day, he may establish an <i>eiruv</i> with his feet</b> for the <b>second day;</b> and if <b>he established an <i>eiruv</i> with bread on</b> the <b>first day, he may establish an <i>eiruv</i> with bread on</b> the <b>second day?

            "Rabba <b>said to him: Do you think that one must go and say something</b> at the site of the <i>eiruv</i>, therefore performing an act of preparation? <b>He goes, and is silent, and sits</b> there, and he automatically acquires his residence without having to say or do anything. This does not fall into the category of prohibited preparation.",
            "Abaye asked: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion do you say that nothing must be said when establishing an <i>eiruv teḥumin</i>?

            "The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>And this is not</b> correct.

Whereas <b>here,</b> with regard to an <i>eiruv</i>, <b>it is not clear</b> to others that one’s actions are for the purpose of establishing an <i>eiruv</i>.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>If he is a Torah scholar [<i>tzurva merabbanan</i>], we,</b> the observers, would <b>say:</b> Perhaps <b>his study pulled him,</b> i.e., he was engrossed in his study and was not paying attention to where he was going. <b>And if he is an ignoramus, we</b> would <b>say:</b> Perhaps <b>he lost</b> his <b>donkey</b> and went to look for it. His actions give no indication that he is going to establish an <i>eiruv</i> for the following day, as establishing an <i>eiruv</i> does not require any recognizable action.",
            "The Gemara now examines Rav Yehuda’s statement <b>itself,</b> which was cited in the course of the previous discussion. <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> If <b>one established an <i>eiruv</i> with his feet on</b> the eve of the <b>first day, he may establish an <i>eiruv</i> with his feet on</b> the eve of <b>the second</b> day as well.

            "The Gemara adds: <b>And the Rabbis,</b> who do not accept the opinion of Shmuel, argue that this is no proof, as <b>perhaps there,</b> the mishna is merely <b>teaching us good advice</b> as to how one can rely on a single <i>eiruv</i> and avoid having to prepare an additional <i>eiruv</i> for the second day.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> During the time period when the Jewish calendar was established by the court according to the testimony of witnesses who had seen the new moon, Rosh HaShana would be observed for only one day if witnesses arrived on that day, and for two days if witnesses failed to arrive and the month of Elul was declared to be an extended, thirty-day month. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>Rosh HaShana,</b> if <b>one feared that</b> the month of Elul <b>might be extended,</b> and he wanted to travel in two different directions on the two days that could be Rosh HaShana, this <b>person may establish two <i>eiruvin</i> and say: My <i>eiruv</i> on the first</b> day shall be <b>to the east and on the second</b> day <b>to the west,</b> or alternatively: <b>On the first</b> day it shall be <b>to the west, and on the second</b> day <b>to the east.</b> Similarly, he may say: <b>My <i>eiruv</i></b> shall apply <b>on the first</b> day, <b>but on the second</b> day I shall be <b>like</b> the rest of <b>the inhabitants of my town,</b> or alternatively: <b>My <i>eiruv</i></b> shall apply <b>on the second</b> day, <b>but on the first</b> day I shall be <b>like</b> the rest of <b>the inhabitants of my town.

            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> based upon the following <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“Give a portion to seven, and also to eight”</b> (Ecclesiastes 11:2). <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: “Seven,” these are the seven days of Creation; “eight,” these are the eight days</b> until <b>circumcision.

The Gemara responds: <b>This is not difficult,</b> as the case is that <b>he happened to have a cup;</b> but without a cup of wine, the blessing may not be recited.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> one can recite the blessing over a cup of wine on <b><i>Shavuot</i> and Rosh HaShana;</b> but <b>what does one do on Yom Kippur?

            "However, <b>Rabban Gamliel the Elder instituted that they</b> should <b>have two thousand cubits in each direction,</b> so that witnesses not refrain from coming to testify. <b>And</b> it is <b>not only these</b> whom the Sages <b>said</b> are given two thousand cubits in the place that they have reached, <b>but even a midwife who comes to deliver</b> a child, <b>and one who comes to rescue</b> Jews <b>from</b> an invasion of gentile <b>troops or from a river or a collapsed building or a fire; they are like the inhabitants of the town</b> at which they arrive, <b>and they have two thousand cubits in each direction.</b>",
            "The question may be raised: Are they given <b>no more</b> than two thousand cubits? <b>Didn’t it say</b> in the mishna: <b>All who go out to save</b> lives <b>may return to their</b> original <b>locations</b> on Shabbat, which indicates that they may walk <b>even more</b> than two thousand cubits?",
            "In response, <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> We must not infer from the mishna that they may go home even if they went out more than two thousand cubits from their limit, but rather <b>that they may return with</b> their <b>weapons to their</b> original <b>locations,</b> provided that they are within two thousand cubits. <b>As it was taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>At first</b> those returning from a rescue mission <b>would place their weapons in</b> the first house that they encountered upon their return, i.e., <b>the house nearest the wall,</b> to avoid carrying on Shabbat any more than necessary.",
            "<b>Once,</b> their <b>enemies noticed that they</b> were no longer carrying their weapons, <b>and</b> they <b>chased after them; and</b> the defenders <b>entered</b> the house <b>to take up their weapons</b> and fight, <b>and</b> their <b>enemies entered after them,</b> causing great confusion. In the chaos, the defenders began to <b>push one another, and</b> they <b>killed more of each other than</b> their <b>enemies killed</b> of them. <b>At that time</b> the Sages <b>instituted that they should return to their locations,</b> i.e., their destinations, <b>with their weapons.</b>",
            "The Gemara cites an alternate resolution that <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> in the mishna in <i>Rosh HaShana</i> where they only permitted two thousand cubits, it is referring to a situation <b>where the Jews defeated the nations of the world,</b> i.e., the gentiles, in battle; in such a case there is no concern and they need not return to their original locations. Whereas <b>here,</b> in the mishna which indicates that the Sages permitted even more than two thousand cubits, it is referring to a situation <b>where the nations of the world defeated themselves,</b> i.e., the Jews, whom the Gemara refers to euphemistically as themselves; in such a case the Sages allowed the defeated soldiers to return to their original locations.",
            "Since the Gemara discussed war on Shabbat, the Gemara cites <b>Rav Yehuda,</b> who <b>said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> With regard to <b>gentiles who besieged Jewish towns, they may not go out</b> to fight <b>against them with their weapons, nor may they desecrate Shabbat</b> in any other way <b>due to them,</b> but rather they must wait until after Shabbat.",
            "<b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, with a caveat: With regard to <b>gentiles who besieged, etc. In what</b> case <b>is this said?</b> It is said in a case <b>where</b> the gentiles <b>came</b> and besieged the town <b>with regard to monetary matters,</b> i.e., banditry. <b>However, if they came with regard to lives,</b> i.e., there is concern that the gentiles will attack, <b>they may go out against them with their weapons, and they may desecrate Shabbat due to them.</b>",
            "<b>And with regard to a town that is</b> located <b>near the border, even if</b> the gentiles <b>did not come with regard to lives, but</b> rather <b>with regard to matters of hay and straw,</b> i.e., to raid and spoil the town, <b>they may go out against them with their weapons, and they may desecrate Shabbat due to them,</b> as the border must be carefully guarded, in order to prevent enemies from gaining a foothold there.",
            "<b>Rav Yosef bar Manyumi said</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said: And Babylonia is considered like a town</b> located <b>near the border,</b> and war may be waged there on Shabbat even if the gentiles came for financial gain. <b>And this means</b> the city of <b>Neharde’a,</b> which was located near the border.",
            "<b>Rabbi Dostai</b> of the town <b>of Biri expounded: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “And they told David, saying: Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Ke’ila, and they rob the threshing floors”</b> (i Samuel 23:1), after which David asked God how he should respond.",
            "<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Ke’ila was a town</b> located <b>near the border,</b> and the Philistines <b>came only with regard to matters of hay and straw, as it is written: “And they rob the threshing floors.” And</b> in the next verse <b>it is written: “Therefore David inquired of the Lord, saying: Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the Lord said to David: Go and smite the Philistines, and save Ke’ila”</b> (i Samuel 23:2), which indicates that war may be waged in a border town on Shabbat, even with regard to monetary matters.",
            "The Gemara refutes this proof by asking: <b>What is</b> David’s <b>dilemma? If you say</b> that he had a halakhic question and was in doubt <b>whether it was permitted or prohibited</b> to fight the Philistines on Shabbat, it is possible to respond: <b>But the court of Samuel from Rama was</b> then <b>in existence,</b> and rather than inquire by way of the <i>Urim VeTummim</i> he should have inquired of the Great Sanhedrin.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> he asked: <b>Will he succeed or will he not succeed</b> in his war? The Gemara comments: <b>This is also precise</b> in the language of the verse, <b>as it is written</b> in the response to David’s query: <b>“Go and smite the Philistines, and save Ke’ila.” Learn from this,</b> from the assurance that God gave David of his victory, that this was the subject of his inquiry.",

            "<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He may enter</b> the town. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: It once happened that Rabbi Tarfon entered</b> a town on Shabbat <b>without intention</b> from the beginning of Shabbat to establish residence in the city.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: It once happened that Rabbi Tarfon was walking along the way</b> on Shabbat eve, <b>and night fell upon him, and he spent the night outside the town.

            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who was sleeping along the road</b> on Shabbat eve <b>and did not know that night had fallen, he has two thousand cubits in each direction;</b> this is the statement of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri,</b> who maintains that knowledge and awareness are not necessary for one to acquire residence, but rather, a person’s presence in a given location establishes residence there.",
            "<b>But the Rabbis say: He has only four cubits,</b> as since he did not knowingly acquire residence, he did not establish a Shabbat limit. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> He has only four cubits total <b>and he is in the middle of them,</b> i.e., he has two cubits in each direction.",

            "<b>And</b> according to this understanding, Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri <b>should by right have disagreed</b> with the Rabbis even <b>about utensils</b> that were left in the field, i.e., that according to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, ownerless utensils can be moved two thousand cubits in each direction. <b>And the reason that they disagreed about a person</b> is <b>to convey the far-reaching</b> nature of the stringent ruling <b>of the Rabbis, that although there is</b> room <b>to say: Since</b> a person who is <b>awake acquires</b> for himself two thousand cubits, <b>he also acquires</b> them if he is <b>sleeping,</b> the mishna nonetheless <b>teaches us that</b> the Rabbis did <b>not</b> accept this argument, and this is why the dispute is taught specifically with respect to a person.",
            "<b>Or perhaps</b> we should understand his position differently, that <b>in general Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri holds</b> that <b>ownerless objects do not acquire residence</b> of their own. <b>But here,</b> with regard to a person, <b>the reason is as follows: Since</b> a person who is <b>awake acquires</b> for himself two thousand cubits, <b>he also acquires</b> them if he is <b>sleeping.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Yosef said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution to this dilemma from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rain that fell on the eve of a Festival has two thousand cubits in each direction,</b> meaning that one is permitted to carry the rainwater within a radius of two thousand cubits.

            "<b>Abaye sat and recited this tradition. Rav Safra said to Abaye: Perhaps we are dealing with rain</b> that fell <b>near a city, and the inhabitants of that city had it in mind,</b> and that is why it acquires two thousand cubits in each direction.",
            "Abaye <b>said to him: It should not enter your mind</b> that such an understanding is correct, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>A cistern that belongs to an individual,</b> its water is <b>like the feet of that individual,</b> the owner of the cistern, in that it may be carried wherever he is permitted to walk. <b>And</b> a cistern <b>that belongs to a particular city,</b> its water is <b>like the feet of</b> the people of <b>that city,</b> in that it may be carried wherever the inhabitants of that city may walk, i.e., two thousand cubits in each direction from the city. <b>And</b> a cistern <b>that belongs to pilgrims from Babylonia</b> on the way to Eretz Yisrael, meaning that it belongs to all Jews and has no particular owner, its water is <b>like the feet of the one who draws</b> the water, in that it may be carried wherever he is permitted to walk.",

            "<b>Rather,</b> in order to resolve the contradiction, <b>learn from here: This</b> source, which states that the water may be carried two thousand cubits, was taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri,</b> who says that even ownerless objects acquire residence; <b>that</b> source, which states that water that does not belong to any particular person is like the feet of the one who draws it, was taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who say that ownerless objects do not acquire residence.",

            "According to your understanding, that the rainwater may be carried two thousand cubits because the inhabitants of the town had it in mind, the <i>baraita</i> <b>should have</b> said: The rainwater is <b>like the feet of the inhabitants of that city.</b> Rather, you must say that the inhabitants of the city did not acquire the water and that it may be carried within a radius of two thousand cubits, because the <i>baraita</i> was taught in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, that ownerless objects acquire residence.",
            "The Gemara further examines the <i>baraita</i> cited earlier. <b>The Master said:</b> If rain fell <b>on the Festival</b> itself, <b>it is like the feet of all people.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>And why</b> should this be? The water <b>should have acquired residence in the ocean [<i>okeyanos</i>],</b> where it was when the Festival began.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps those</b> clouds that had already been formed on the eve of the Festival <b>went</b> away, <b>and these</b> clouds, from which the rain fell, <b>are others</b> that did acquire residence in the ocean?

            "<b>Rav Pappa said</b> a different explanation for the fact that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi made both statements: <b>It was necessary</b> for Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi to inform us that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, because had he said only that the <i>halakha</i> follows the lenient opinion with regard to an <i>eiruv</i>, <b>it could have entered your mind to say</b> that <b>this statement applies only with regard to</b> the laws governing the <b><i>eiruv</i> of courtyards,</b> which are entirely rabbinic in origin. <b>But with regard to</b> the more stringent laws governing the <b><i>eiruv</i> of</b> Shabbat <b>limits,</b> you would have <b>said</b> that we should <b>not</b> rule leniently, and therefore <b>it was necessary</b> to make both statements.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do you say that we distinguish between an <i>eiruv</i> of courtyards and an <i>eiruv</i> of</b> Shabbat <b>limits?

It was said <b>with regard to an <i>eiruv</i> of</b> Shabbat <b>limits, but with regard to an <i>eiruv</i> of courtyards, an <i>eiruv</i> may be established</b> for another person whether <b>with his knowledge or without his knowledge, as one may act in a person’s interest in his absence; however, one may not act to a person’s disadvantage in his absence.</b> One may act unilaterally on someone else’s behalf when the action is to that other person’s benefit; however, when it is to the other person’s detriment, or when there are both advantages and disadvantages to him, one may act on the other person’s behalf only if one has been explicitly appointed as an agent. Since an <i>eiruv</i> of courtyards is always to a person’s benefit, it can be established even without his knowledge. However, with regard to an <i>eiruv</i> of Shabbat limits, while it enables one to walk in one direction, it disallows him from walking in the opposite direction. Therefore, it can be established only with his knowledge.",
            "<b>Rav Ashi said</b> that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi’s need to issue two rulings can be explained in another manner: <b>It is necessary</b> for Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi to inform us that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, as if he had said only that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the lenient opinion with regard to an <i>eiruv</i>, <b>it could have entered your mind to say</b> that <b>this statement applies only with regard to the remnants of an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> i.e., an <i>eiruv</i> that had been properly established, where the concern is that it might subsequently have become invalid. <b>But with regard to an initial <i>eiruv</i>,</b> i.e., an <i>eiruv</i> that is just being established and has not yet taken effect, you might have <b>said</b> that we should <b>not</b> rule leniently, and therefore it was necessary to issue both rulings.",

The brother-in-law is obligated by Torah law either to perform levirate marriage with his deceased brother’s widow, or to free her to marry others by participating in <i>ḥalitza</i>. <b>The woman waiting for her brother-in-law may neither participate in <i>ḥalitza</i> nor undergo levirate marriage until three months have passed</b> following her husband’s death, due to concern that she may be pregnant from him, in which case she is exempt from levirate marriage and <i>ḥalitza</i>.

Otherwise, if she is within the first three months of her pregnancy from her first husband, and she gives birth six months later, a doubt would arise as to the identity of the father. The Sages did not differentiate between cases where this concern is applicable and where it is not; rather, they fixed a principle that applies universally.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> A woman who had been <b>married</b> when she became widowed or divorced <b>may be betrothed</b> immediately, as couples do not have relations during the period of their betrothal. However, she may not marry until three months have passed, in order to differentiate between any possible offspring from the first and second husband.",
            "A woman who had only been <b>betrothed</b> when she became widowed or divorced <b>may be married</b> immediately, as it may be assumed that the couple did not have relations during the period of their betrothal. This is <b>except for a betrothed woman in Judea, because</b> there the bridegroom’s <b>heart is bold,</b> as it was customary for couples to be alone together during the period of betrothal, and consequently there is a suspicion that they might have had relations, in which case she might be carrying his child. However, no similar concern applies in other places.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yosei says: All the women</b> listed above <b>may be betrothed</b> immediately, because the decree applies only with regard to marriage; this is <b>except for a widow,</b> who must wait for a different reason, <b>because</b> of the <b>mourning</b> for her deceased husband.",

            "Rabbi Asi answered: <b>Yes, and</b> so <b>it was taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>If</b> a woman <b>was eager to go to her father’s house</b> and did not remain with her husband during his final days, <b>or</b> if she <b>was angry with her husband</b> and they separated, <b>or</b> if <b>her husband was elderly or sick</b> and could not father children, <b>or</b> if <b>she was sick,</b> or <b>barren,</b> or <b>an elderly woman,</b> or <b>a minor, or a sexually underdeveloped woman</b> who is incapable of bearing children, <b>or a woman who was unfit to give birth</b> for any other reason, <b>or</b> if <b>her husband was imprisoned in jail,</b> or if <b>she had miscarried after the death of her husband,</b> so that there is no longer any concern that she might be pregnant from him, <b>all</b> these women <b>must wait three months</b> before remarrying or even becoming betrothed; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir,</b> who maintains that this decree applies to all women, even when the particular situation renders it unnecessary. In all these cases <b>Rabbi Yosei permits</b> the woman <b>to be betrothed and to marry immediately.</b>",
            "The Gemara resumes its question: <b>Why do I need</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan to state that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with Rabbi Yosei? <b>Didn’t you say:</b> In a dispute between <b>Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yosei,</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> and therefore the <i>halakha</i> should be in accordance with him here as well?

            "<b>Rather,</b> the proof that these principles do not apply is <b>from that which was taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may go to a fair of</b> idolatrous <b>gentiles and buy animals, slaves, and maidservants from them,</b> as the purchase raises them to a more sanctified state; and he may buy <b>houses, fields, and vineyards</b> from them, due to the mitzva to settle Eretz Yisrael; <b>and he may write</b> the necessary deeds <b>and confirm</b> them <b>in their</b> gentile <b>courts</b> with an official seal, even though this involves an acknowledgement of their authority, <b>because it is as though he were rescuing</b> his property <b>from their hands,</b> as the court’s confirmation and stamp of approval prevents the sellers from appealing the sale and retracting it.",

            "The Gemara proceeds to analyze <b>the matter</b> of Rabba’s statement <b>itself. Rabba said: Anything that cannot</b> be accomplished <b>sequentially even simultaneously</b> it <b>cannot</b> be accomplished. <b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba</b> based on the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>One who increases tithes,</b> i.e., he tithes two-tenths instead of one-tenth, the remainder of <b>his produce is rendered</b> fit for consumption, as he properly tithed it; <b>however, his tithes are ruined,</b> as the additional tenth is neither a tithe nor is it tithed produce. It is not a tithe because tithe status applies only to one tenth, and neither is it tithed produce as it was not tithed. Since it is unclear which of the two-tenths is the actual tithe and which is not, this produce may neither be treated as a tithe nor as tithed produce.",
            "According to Rabba’s opinion, the question arises: <b>Why</b> should the produce be rendered fit for consumption? <b>Let us say</b> and apply his principle: <b>Anything that cannot</b> be accomplished <b>sequentially; even simultaneously</b> it <b>cannot</b> be accomplished. Since one may not designate two tenths sequentially, one tenth followed by a second tenth, likewise, he should be precluded from simultaneously designating two tenths of his produce as a tithe. Accordingly, it should be considered as though he had not designated any tithe at all, and therefore his produce should not be regarded as tithed.",
            "Gemara answers: The case of <b>a tithe is different, as</b> tithe status <b>takes effect partially,</b> i.e., on less than a unit of produce. <b>As if one said: Let half of each</b> grain of <b>wheat be designated</b> as tithed, <b>it is designated.</b> Just as one can designate an entire grain of wheat as a tithe, he can likewise designate half a grain. In this case too, when one tithes two tenths of the produce, the ruling is not that one tenth is actual tithe and the other tenth is untithed produce mixed with the tithe. Instead, half of each grain of the set-aside portion is designated as a tithe, while the other half of each grain is not. Accordingly, the remainder of the produce is tithed, as one tenth of the total has been designated as first tithe. However, the portion designated as the tithe is ruined, because it is impossible to identify which part of each grain is designated.",
            "Another objection was raised against Rabba’s opinion: Yet there is the case of the <b>animal tithe, which does take effect partially,</b> as one cannot consecrate half an animal for his tithe. Three times a year, the owner of a herd of kosher animals would gather all the animals born during the preceding period into an enclosure and let them out one by one. Every tenth animal would be marked with red paint to indicate that it was sacred. Only an entire animal could be consecrated as animal tithe, not a part of an animal.",
            "<b>And Rabba said:</b> If <b>two</b> animals <b>emerged</b> from the enclosure together <b>as the tenth, and he designated them</b> both as the <b>tenth, the tenth and eleventh</b> animals <b>are intermingled with each other.</b> One is sacred with the sanctity of the animal tithe, while the other remains a peace-offering, but there is no way to determine which is which. The question arises: If the principle that anything which cannot be accomplished sequentially; even simultaneously it cannot be accomplished applies, neither animal is consecrated, as one cannot designate both the tenth and the eleventh animals as the animal tithe, one after the other.",
            "The Gemara answers: The <b>animal tithe is different, as</b> two animals can indeed be designated as animal tithe <b>one after the other in</b> the case of <b>an error.</b> Although one cannot designate the tenth and eleventh animals as the animal tithe <i>ab initio</i>, if he did so in error they are both consecrated.",
            "<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: If <b>one</b> erred and <b>designated the ninth</b> animal <b>as the tenth,</b> and erred again and designated <b>the tenth as the ninth and the eleventh as the tenth,</b> all <b>three</b> animals <b>are consecrated.</b> The first is consecrated because it was designated as the tenth, the second because it actually is the tenth, while the third is also consecrated because it was designated as the tenth. Apparently, more than one animal can be consecrated as the animal tithe, if designated in error. Here too, a modicum of sanctity applies to the two animals that emerged together and were together designated as the tenth.",
            "The Gemara raises another objection to Rabba’s principle. <b>But there is</b> the case of the forty loaves that accompany a <b>thanks-offering, which are not</b> consecrated if they were designated <b>in error, and</b> likewise <b>are not</b> consecrated if two sets of loaves were designated for the same offering <b>one after the other.

This last verse mentions both place and fleeing, <b>and</b> the term <b>place</b> is derived <b>from</b> the term <b>fleeing. And</b> the term <b>fleeing</b> is derived <b>from</b> the term <b>fleeing,</b> written in a different verse with regard to the unwitting murderer: “But if the slayer shall at any time come outside the border of the city of his refuge, whither he has fled” (Numbers 35:26). <b>And</b> the term <b>fleeing</b> is derived <b>from</b> the term <b>border,</b> which appears in the same verse. <b>And</b> the term <b>border</b> is derived <b>from</b> the term <b>border,</b> as it states there: “And the avenger of blood find him outside [<i>miḥutz</i>] the borders of the city of his refuge” (Numbers 35:27). Since this verse mentions both the term border and the term outside, the term <b>border</b> is derived <b>from</b> the term <b>outside.

From this chain of identical terms, the meaning of the term place stated in connection with Shabbat is derived from the two thousand cubits mentioned with regard to the Levite cities.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But let us derive</b> instead by means of a verbal analogy between the term outside in the verse: “Outside the borders of the city of refuge,” and the term outside in the verse: <b>“From the wall of the city outward [<i>vaḥutza</i>] a thousand cubits”</b> (Numbers 35:4), that the Shabbat limit measures only a thousand cubits. The Gemara answers: <b>One derives</b> the meaning of the term <b>outside [<i>ḥutz</i>]</b> by means of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> another instance of the term <b>outside [<i>ḥutz</i>], but one does not derive</b> the meaning of the term <b>outside from</b> the term <b>outward [<i>ḥutza</i>].</b>",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>What is</b> significant about <b>the difference</b> between the two terms? <b>Didn’t the school of Rabbi Yishmael teach</b> a verbal analogy with regard to leprosy of houses between the verse: <b>“And the priest shall return [<i>veshav</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:39) and the verse: <b>“And the priest shall come [<i>uva</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:44), from which it is derived that <b>this is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>returning,</b> i.e., it is after seven days; <b>this is</b> the same <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>coming;</b> it is after seven days.

            "If <b>one house</b> in a row of dwellings <b>was protruding like a turret, or</b> if <b>two houses</b> were <b>protruding like two turrets, one regards them as though a cord is stretched over their</b> outer edge along the length of the city, <b>and one measures two thousand cubits</b> beginning <b>from there.</b> If the city <b>was shaped like a bow or like</b> the Greek letter <b><i>gamma</i>, one regards it as though</b> the interior space were <b>full of houses and courtyards, and one measures two thousand cubits</b> beginning <b>from there.</b>",
            "The Gemara proceeds to analyze the <i>Tosefta</i>. <b>The Master said:</b> If the city is <b>long,</b> the Shabbat limit is measured from the boundary <b>as it is.</b> The Gemara expresses surprise: That is <b>obvious.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>It was necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> with regard to a case <b>where</b> the city is <b>long and narrow. Lest you say: Let us give its breadth</b> the dimension <b>of its length</b> and regard the city as if it were square, <b>it teaches us</b> that we do not do so.",
            "The <i>Tosefta</i> stated: If the city is <b>square, one does not create</b> additional <b>corners for it.</b> Once again the Gemara asks: That is <b>obvious.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> with regard to a case <b>where</b> the shape of the city <b>is square but</b> that <b>square is not</b> aligned with the <b>four</b> directions <b>of the world,</b> i.e., north, south, east, and west. <b>Lest you say: Let us</b> align the <b>square with the four</b> directions of the <b>world, it teaches us</b> that this is not done.",
            "The <i>Tosefta</i> also stated: If <b>one house</b> in a row of dwellings <b>was protruding like a turret, or</b> if <b>two houses</b> were <b>protruding like two turrets,</b> one regards them as though a cord is stretched over their outer edge along the length of the city, and one measures two thousand cubits beginning from there. The Gemara asks: <b>Now,</b> if with regard to <b>one house, you said</b> to extend the city’s boundaries, with regard to <b>two houses, is it necessary</b> to say so?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> with regard to a case where the two houses were protruding <b>on two</b> different <b>sides</b> of the city. <b>Lest you say:</b> When a house protrudes <b>from one side, we say</b> that the city is extended even due to a single house, but if houses protrude <b>from two sides we do not say</b> so; therefore, <b>it teaches us</b> to regard the city as though it is extended on both sides.",
            "The <i>Tosefta</i> stated: If the city <b>was shaped like a bow or like</b> the Greek letter <b><i>gamma</i>, one regards it as if</b> the interior space were <b>full of houses and courtyards, and one measures two thousand cubits</b> beginning <b>from there. Rav Huna said:</b> With regard to <b>a city that is shaped like a bow,</b> the following distinction applies: <b>If there are less than four thousand cubits between</b> the <b>two ends</b> of the bow, so that the Shabbat limits measured from the two ends of the city overlap, the interior space of the bow is regarded as if it were filled with houses, and <b>one measures</b> the Shabbat limit of the city <b>from the</b> imaginary <b>bowstring</b> stretched between the two ends of the bow. <b>But if</b> that is <b>not</b> the case, and the distance between the two ends of the bow is four thousand cubits or more, <b>one measures</b> the Shabbat limit <b>from the bow</b> itself.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Did Rav Huna</b> actually <b>say</b> that the distance between two sections of a single city that renders them separate entities is four thousand cubits? <b>Didn’t Rav Huna say:</b> With regard to <b>the wall of a city that was breached,</b> even if there is a gap between two sections of the city, the city is still considered a single entity if the breach is no more than <b>141⅓</b> cubits? However, if the breach is wider, the two sections are considered separate entities. Apparently, a distance of 141⅓ cubits suffices to separate between two sections of a city and to render them separate entities.",

            "The Gemara answers: <b>It is necessary</b> for Rav Huna to state this <i>halakha</i> in both instances, <b>as, had he taught it to us</b> only <b>here,</b> in the case of the breached wall, one might have said that a <i>karpef</i> is allocated to each city only in that case <b>because it had an aspect of permissibility from the outset,</b> namely, the two sections originally formed one city. <b>But there,</b> with regard to the two cities, <b>say</b> that this is <b>not the case</b> and the two cities are only considered as one if they are separated by less than the measure of a single <i>karpef</i>.",

            "The discussion with regard to measuring Shabbat limits has been referring to a properly built city. <b>Rav Huna said: Those who dwell in huts,</b> i.e., in thatched hovels of straw and willow branches, are not considered inhabitants of a city. Therefore, <b>one measures</b> the Shabbat limit <b>for them only from the entrance to their homes;</b> the huts are not combined together and considered a city.",
            "<b>Rav Ḥisda raised an objection:</b> The Torah states with regard to the Jewish people in the desert: <b>“And they pitched by the Jordan, from Beit-HaYeshimot</b> to Avel-Shittim in the plains of Moab” (Numbers 33:49), <b>and Rabba bar bar Ḥana said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: I myself saw that place, and it is three parasangs [<i>parsa</i>],</b> the equivalent of twelve <i>mil</i>, <b>by three parasangs.</b>",

This indicates that even on Shabbat, when people needed to defecate, they would walk the entire length of the camp, which was considerably longer than two thousand cubits, which equals one <i>mil</i>. It is apparent that the encampment of the Jewish people was considered to be a city despite the fact that it was composed of tents alone. How, then, did Rav Huna say that those who live in huts are not considered city dwellers?",
            "<b>Rava said to him: The banners of the desert, you say?</b> Are you citing a proof from the practice of the Jewish people as they traveled through the desert according to their tribal banners? <b>Since it is written with regard to them: “According to the commandment of the Lord they remained encamped, and according to the commandment of the Lord they journeyed”</b> (Numbers 9:20), <b>it was considered as though it were a permanent</b> residence <b>for them.</b> A camp that is established in accordance with the word of God is regarded as a permanent settlement.",

There is concern that while they are away their wives commit adultery, and that consequently their children are not really their own. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Because they sense when one another immerses.</b> Similarly to the men, the women must walk a significant distance in order to immerse in a ritual bath. Since the settlement is very small and everyone knows when the women go to immerse, it is possible for an unscrupulous man to use this information to engage in adulterous relations with them by following them and taking advantage of the fact that they are alone.",

Even in such cities they are known to have a regular life expectancy. <b>Rather, say: They grow old at half their days,</b> i.e., they age prematurely due to the strain of climbing up and down the inclines.

            "With regard to the measurements of a city’s boundaries, <b>the Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: If, in order to measure the Shabbat limit, <b>one comes to square</b> a city, i.e., to extend the city’s boundaries to include all of its protrusions within an imaginary square, <b>he squares it</b> so that the sides of the square align <b>with the four</b> directions <b>of the world.

And your sign</b> by which you can recognize the directions of the world is as follows: The constellation of <b>Ursa Major is in the north and Scorpio is in the south.</b> The directions of the city are determined by these constellations.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yosei says: If one does not know how to square</b> the city in alignment <b>with the four</b> directions <b>of the world</b> based upon the constellations, <b>he should square it based upon the seasons,</b> although this is less precise. <b>How so?</b> Where <b>the sun rises and sets on the longest day</b> of the year, the summer solstice, <b>this</b> route of the sun <b>is the face of the north.</b> The sun rises in the northeast and sets in the northwest, and thus travels from east to west across the north side of the world. Conversely, where <b>the sun rises and sets on the shortest day</b> of the year, the winter solstice, <b>this</b> route of the sun <b>is the face of the south.</b> Whereas at <b>the vernal equinox and the autumnal equinox,</b> when day and night are equal in length, <b>the sun rises in the middle of the east and sets in the middle of the west.</b>",

The sun also rises and the sun goes down, and hastens to its place, where it rises again. <b>It goes toward the south, and turns about to the north;</b> round and round goes the wind, and on its circuits the wind returns” (Ecclesiastes 1:4–6). The verse is understood as describing the sun’s movements, as follows: <b>“It goes toward the south” during the day; “and turns about to the north,”</b> on the other side of the earth, <b>at night. “Round and round goes the wind [<i>ruaḥ</i>];”</b> the word <i>ruaḥ</i> can also mean direction or side.

            "On the topic of the previous discussion with regard to calculating the directions of the world based upon the seasons, <b>Shmuel said: The vernal equinox occurs only at</b> the beginning of one of <b>the four quarters of a day: Either</b> precisely <b>at the beginning of the day, or</b> precisely <b>at the beginning of the night, or at midday, or at midnight.</b>",

Since he cannot join in an <i>eiruv</i> with the Jew, he renders it prohibited for the Jew to carry from his house to the courtyard or from the courtyard to his house. Consequently, the case of <b>one</b> Jew living in the courtyard is <b>no different</b> from the case of <b>two</b> Jews living there. In both cases, the gentile renders it prohibited for carrying.",

            "<b>Rather,</b> this explanation must be rejected, and the dispute in the mishna should be understood differently: <b>Everyone agrees</b> that <b>the residence of gentile is not considered a</b> significant <b>residence, and here they disagree about a decree</b> that was issued <b>lest</b> the Jew <b>learn from</b> the gentile’s <b>ways.</b> The disagreement is with regard to whether this decree is applicable only when there are two Jews living in the courtyard, or even when there is only one Jew living there.",
            "The disagreement should be understood as follows: <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov holds</b> that <b>since a gentile is suspected of bloodshed,</b> it is unusual for a single Jew to share a courtyard with a gentile. However, it is not unusual for two or more Jews to do so, as they will protect each other. Therefore, in the case of <b>two</b> Jews, <b>who commonly live</b> together with a gentile in the same courtyard, the Sages <b>issued a decree</b> to the effect that the gentile renders it prohibited for them to carry. This would cause great inconvenience to Jews living with gentiles and would thereby motivate the Jews to distance themselves from gentiles. In this manner, the Sages sought to prevent the Jews from learning from the gentiles’ ways. However, in the case of <b>one</b> Jew, for whom <b>it is not common</b> to live together with a gentile in the same courtyard, <b>the Sages did not issue a decree</b> that the gentile renders it prohibited for him to carry, as the Sages do not issue decrees for uncommon situations.",
            "On the other hand, <b>Rabbi Meir holds</b> that <b>sometimes it happens that</b> a single Jew <b>lives</b> together with a gentile in the same courtyard, and hence it is appropriate to issue the decree in such a case as well. <b>Therefore, the Sages said: An <i>eiruv</i> is not effective in a place</b> where <b>a gentile</b> is living, <b>nor is the renunciation of rights</b> to a courtyard in favor of the other residents <b>effective in a place</b> where <b>a gentile</b> is living. Therefore, carrying is prohibited in a courtyard in which a gentile resides, <b>unless</b> the gentile <b>rents</b> out his property to one of the Jews for the purpose of an <i>eiruv</i> regardless of the number of Jews living there. <b>And</b> as <b>a gentile</b> would <b>not</b> be willing <b>to rent</b> out his property for this purpose, the living conditions will become too strained, prompting the Jew to move.",
            "The Gemara poses a question: <b>What is the reason</b> that a gentile will not rent out his property for the purpose of an <i>eiruv</i>? <b>If you say</b> it is <b>because</b> the gentile <b>thinks</b> that <b>perhaps they will</b> later <b>come to take possession of his property</b> based on this rental, <b>this works out well according to the one who said</b> that <b>we require a full-fledged rental,</b> i.e., that rental for the purpose of an <i>eiruv</i> must be proper and valid according to all the <i>halakhot</i> of renting.",
            "<b>However, according to the one who said</b> that <b>we require</b> only <b>a flawed,</b> symbolic <b>rental,</b> i.e., all that is needed is a token gesture that has the appearance of renting, <b>what is there to say?</b> The gentile would understand that it is not a real rental, and therefore he would not be wary of renting out his residence. <b>As it was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disputed this issue as follows: <b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that we require a <b>full-fledged rental, and Rav Sheshet said: A flawed,</b> symbolic <b>rental</b> is sufficient.",

The principle that less than the value of a <i>peruta</i> is not considered money applies to Jews alone. With regard to gentiles, it has monetary value, and therefore one may rent from a gentile with this amount.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the distinction between a full-fledged rental and a flawed rental should be explained as follows: <b>A full-fledged</b> rental refers <b>to</b> one that is confirmed <b>by legal documents [<i>moharkei</i>]</b> and guaranteed by <b>officials [<i>aburganei</i>];</b> and <b>a flawed</b> rental means one that is <b>not</b> confirmed <b>by legal documents and</b> guaranteed by <b>officials,</b> an agreement that is unenforceable in court.

Here,</b> in the verse in which David remained silent, it is referring <b>to the period when Ira HaYa’iri,</b> David’s teacher, <b>was alive; there,</b> in the verse where he publicized his words, it is referring <b>to the period when Ira HaYa’iri was no</b> longer <b>alive.</b>",
            "Having mentioned Ira HaYa’iri, the Gemara now cites a related teaching. <b>Rabbi Abba bar Zavda said: Whoever gives</b> all <b>his</b> priestly <b>gifts to one priest</b> has acted improperly and <b>brings famine into the world</b> as punishment. <b>As it is stated:</b> “And also <b>Ira HaYa’iri was a priest for David”</b> (II Samuel 20:26), which invites the question: <b>Was he a priest for David</b> alone, and <b>not for anyone else? Rather,</b> it means <b>that</b> David <b>would send</b> all <b>his</b> priestly <b>gifts to him</b> alone, i.e., he was the only priest to enjoy David’s gifts. <b>And it is written afterward: “And there was a famine in the days of David,</b> three years, year after year” (II Samuel 21:1).",
            "<b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> Anyone who rules in his teacher’s presence <b>is lowered from his</b> position of <b>greatness, as it is stated: “And Elazar the priest said to the men of war</b> who went to battle: This is the statute of the Torah which the Lord commanded Moses” (Numbers 31:21). <b>Although</b> Elazar <b>said to</b> the soldiers: God commanded this statute <b>to</b> my <b>father’s brother, while to me He did not command</b> it, <b>even so he was punished</b> for speaking in this manner in the presence of his teacher, Moses.",
            "What was his punishment? <b>As it is written</b> that God had told Moses with regard to Joshua: <b>“And he shall stand before Elazar the priest,</b> who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before the Lord: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation” (Numbers 27:21). Elazar was originally awarded a place of great honor. <b>But we do not find</b> in the Bible <b>that Joshua</b> ever <b>had need of him.</b> It is never stated that Joshua made use of the Urim through Elazar, which shows that Elazar never achieved the greatness promised him.",
            "With regard to this same issue, <b>Rabbi Levi said: Whoever answers a word in the presence of his teacher will go down to the netherworld childless, as it is stated: “And Joshua bin Nun, the minister of Moses from his youth, answered and said: My lord Moses, shut them in”</b> (Numbers 11:28). Since he spoke to his teacher out of turn, he was punished by remaining childless."

Since Joshua did not attend to this state of affairs, he was responsible for the people’s neglect of the commandment to be fruitful and multiply, for which he was punished by remaining childless.",
            "The Gemara now cites a further teaching in this regard: <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Inya said in the name of Rav: Torah study is greater than the offering of daily</b> sacrifices, as the angel <b>said to</b> Joshua: <b>“I am now come,”</b> i.e., on account of the second sin, demonstrating that neglect of Torah study is a more serious offense than neglect of the daily offerings.",

            "The Gemara returns to the issue of renting out domains for the purpose of an <i>eiruv</i>. The Gemara relates that <b>there was a certain alleyway in which</b> the gentile, <b>Laḥman bar Ristak, lived.</b> His Jewish neighbors <b>said to him: Rent us your domain,</b> i.e., your right to use the alleyway, so that it will not render it prohibited for us to carry. <b>He would not rent</b> it <b>to them,</b> and therefore they could not carry in the alleyway on Shabbat.",

            "Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, replied: It is required <b>that they establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> anyway, as a reminder of the laws of <i>eiruvin</i>, even though it serves no halakhic purpose. Rava retorted that this in turn results in a different problem: Observers will then <b>say</b> that <b>an <i>eiruv</i> is effective</b> even <b>in the place of a gentile,</b> even if he does not rent out his domain, which is against the <i>halakha</i>. He replied: <b>We make an announcement</b> to the effect that they are not carrying because of the <i>eiruv</i>, and that it only serves as a reminder.",

Recalling that their fathers established an <i>eiruv</i> in this alleyway, they will think that an <i>eiruv</i> is effective even in the place of a gentile. Therefore, one cannot rely on Abaye’s solution.",
            "<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that the gentile’s Jewish neighbors should proceed as follows: <b>Let one of them go and become friendly with</b> the gentile, <b>and ask him</b> for permission to make use of <b>a place</b> in his domain, <b>and set something down there, thus becoming like</b> the gentile’s <b>hired laborer or harvester.

            "<b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: If there were five hired laborers or five harvesters there, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?

            "The Gemara proceeds to examine the ruling cited in the course of the previous discussion.

            "The Gemara poses a question: <b>Does</b> walking <b>a path of</b> only <b>a <i>mil</i> dispel the</b> effects of <b>wine? Wasn’t</b> it <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There was an incident involving Rabban Gamliel, who was riding a donkey and traveling from Akko to Keziv, and</b> his student <b>Rabbi Elai was walking behind him.</b> Rabban Gamliel <b>found</b> some <b>fine loaves</b> of bread <b>on the road, and he said to</b> his student: <b>Elai, take the loaves from the road.</b> Further along the way, Rabban Gamliel <b>encountered a certain gentile</b> and <b>said to him: Mavgai, take these loaves from Elai.</b>",

He <b>said to him: No.</b>",
            "The Gemara interrupts the story in order to comment: <b>At that time we learned that Rabban Gamliel divined</b> the gentile’s name <b>by way of divine inspiration</b> that rested upon him. <b>And at that time we</b> also <b>learned three matters</b> of <i>halakha</i> from Rabban Gamliel’s behavior: <b>We learned that one may not pass by food,</b> i.e., if a person sees food lying on the ground, he must stop and pick it up.",
            "<b>We</b> also <b>learned that we follow the majority of travelers.</b> Since the area was populated mostly by gentiles, Rabban Gamliel assumed that the loaf belonged to a gentile, and was consequently prohibited to be eaten by a Jew. Therefore, he ordered that it be given to a gentile. And <b>we</b> further <b>learned that</b> with regard to <b>leavened bread belonging to a gentile, it is permitted</b> to <b>benefit</b> from this food <b>after Passover.</b> The incident recounted above occurred not long after the festival of Passover. By giving the loaf to the gentile instead of burning it in accordance with the <i>halakhot</i> of leavened bread that remains after Passover, Rabban Gamliel gained a certain benefit from it in the form of the gentile’s gratitude. This benefit is regarded as having monetary value.",
            "The Gemara resumes the narrative: <b>When</b> Rabban Gamliel <b>arrived in Keziv, a</b> person <b>came</b> before him <b>to request</b> that he dissolve <b>his vow.</b> Rabban Gamliel <b>said to the one who was with him,</b> i.e., Rabbi Elai: <b>Did we drink a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of Italian wine</b> earlier? He <b>said to him: Yes.</b> Rabban Gamliel replied: <b>If so, let him journey after us until</b> the effect of <b>our wine is dispelled,</b> after which we may consider his issue.",
            "<b>And</b> that person <b>journeyed after them</b> for <b>three <i>mil</i>, until</b> Rabban Gamliel <b>arrived at the Ladder of Tyre. When he arrived at the Ladder of Tyre, Rabban Gamliel alighted from his donkey and wrapped himself</b> in his shawl in the customary manner of a judge, who wraps himself in a shawl in order to sit in awe at the time of judgment, <b>and he sat and dissolved his vow.</b>",
            "The Gemara continues: <b>At that time we learned many matters</b> of <i>halakha</i> from Rabban Gamliel’s conduct. <b>We learned that a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of Italian wine intoxicates, and we learned</b> that <b>one who is intoxicated may not issue a</b> halakhic <b>ruling, and we learned that</b> walking on <b>a path dispels</b> the effect <b>of wine, and</b> lastly <b>we learned that one may not annul vows</b> when he is <b>either mounted</b> on an animal, <b>or walking, or</b> even <b>standing, but</b> only when he is <b>sitting.</b>",
            "<b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is teaching</b> that Rabban Gamliel found it necessary to walk <b>three <i>mil</i></b> in order to become sober after drinking wine.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>This is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as there is</b> an authority <b>who says</b> that <b>one</b> may <b>open</b> the possibility for dissolution of a vow <b>by means of regret</b> alone. In other words, there is no need to search for a special reason in order to dissolve a person’s vow; it is enough to ascertain that he regrets making it.

            "<b>And there is</b> another authority <b>who says</b> that <b>one</b> may <b>not open</b> the possibility for dissolution of a vow <b>by means of regret</b> alone.

            "<b>As Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> With <b>what did Rabban Gamliel open</b> the possibility for dissolving his vow <b>for that man,</b> i.e., what opening did he find for him?

Therefore, one should not vow at all. Had you known that whoever vows is liable to be executed, would you have vowed? <b>Rather, it is the tongue of the wise that heals,</b> as when a Sage dissolves a vow, he dissolves it retroactively, and it is as though one had never taken the vow.",
            "The Gemara continues with its analysis of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said</b> previously: One of the <i>halakhot</i> learned from the incident involving Rabban Gamliel was that <b>one may not pass by food;</b> rather, one must treat the food with respect and pick it up. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon bar Yoḥai: They taught</b> this ruling <b>only in the early generations, when Jewish women were not accustomed to using witchcraft.

            "The Gemara comments: It is <b>necessary</b> to explain that Shmuel and Rabbi Yoḥanan disagreed with regard to both cases, as neither case could have been learned from the other. <b>As, if it had taught</b> only that there is no renunciation of rights <b>from one courtyard to another,</b> one could have said that it is only <b>with regard to this</b> case that <b>Shmuel said</b> that there is no renunciation of rights, <b>because the use</b> of the one courtyard stands <b>alone and the use</b> of the other courtyard stands <b>alone.</b> Each courtyard is not used by the residents of the other courtyard, and therefore there is no renunciation of rights from one courtyard to the other. <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>a ruin, where there is one</b> common <b>use for both</b> neighbors, as the residents of both houses use it, <b>I</b> would <b>say</b> that he <b>concedes to Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b>",
            "<b>And</b> conversely, <b>if it was stated</b> only <b>with regard to</b> the case of a ruin, one could have said that it is only <b>with regard to this</b> case that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan stated</b> his position, <b>but with regard to the other</b> case, renouncing rights from one courtyard to another, perhaps <b>he concedes to Shmuel.</b> Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to teach both cases.",
            "<b>Abaye said:</b> With regard to <b>that which Shmuel said,</b> that <b>there is no renunciation of rights from one courtyard to another, we said</b> this <b>only</b> with regard <b>to two courtyards,</b> one alongside the other and each opening into an alleyway, <b>that have a single opening between them. However,</b> if there were <b>two courtyards, one within the other, since</b> the residents <b>render</b> each other <b>prohibited</b> to carry, <b>they may</b> also <b>renounce</b> their rights in favor of each other.",
            "<b>Rava said: Even</b> in the case of <b>two courtyards, one within the other, sometimes</b> the residents may <b>renounce</b> their rights in favor of each other, <b>and sometimes they</b> may <b>not renounce</b> them. <b>How</b> so?

The person who neglected to establish an <i>eiruv</i> renders it prohibited for the residents of both courtyards to carry, because the <i>eiruv</i> for both courtyards is located in the outer one, and it is prohibited to carry there without an <i>eiruv</i> due to the right of passage of the residents of the inner courtyard through the outer courtyard. Therefore, there is no effective <i>eiruv</i> at all, not even for the residents of the inner courtyard.",
            "However, if the residents of the two courtyards <b>placed their <i>eiruv</i> in the inner</b> courtyard, the following distinction applies: <b>If</b> a resident <b>of the inner</b> courtyard <b>forgot and did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>, both</b> courtyards are <b>prohibited.</b> In that case, it is prohibited to carry in the inner courtyard itself, due to the one who did not join in the <i>eiruv</i>. Since the inner courtyard is prohibited, it also renders the outer one prohibited, as the residents of the inner courtyard must pass through it.",
            "On the other hand, <b>if a</b> resident <b>of the outer</b> courtyard <b>forgot and did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> it is <b>permitted</b> to carry in <b>the inner</b> courtyard <b>and</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to carry in <b>the outer</b> courtyard. The residents of the inner courtyard have an <i>eiruv</i>, as they established an <i>eiruv</i> together, and therefore they may carry in their courtyard. The residents of the outer courtyard do not render it prohibited for them to carry, as they do not have the right to pass through the inner courtyard, and the inhabitants of the latter could bar their entrance to the inner courtyard by locking their doors.",
            "The Gemara explains why the residents of these courtyards cannot avail themselves of the option of renunciation: If the residents of the two courtyards <b>placed their <i>eiruv</i> in the outer</b> courtyard, <b>and one</b> person <b>forgot</b> to do so, <b>whether</b> he was a resident <b>of the inner</b> courtyard <b>or of the outer</b> courtyard, <b>and</b> he therefore <b>did not establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> with the others, then it is <b>prohibited</b> to carry in <b>both</b> courtyards, and the person who forgot to join in the <i>eiruv</i> cannot renounce his rights to the courtyard.

            "The Gemara attempts to clarify the meaning of this <i>baraita</i>: <b>To which</b> part of the <i>baraita</i> is the clause: Up to the size of two <i>beit se’a</i>, referring? <b>If you say</b> it is referring <b>to the latter clause,</b> can it be that with regard to a rock that is less than ten handbreadths high, the <i>halakha</i> is that carrying is permitted if the rock is up to the size of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>,</b> but <b>no more</b> than that? <b>Wouldn’t he be carrying from one <i>karmelit</i> to another,</b> which is certainly permitted?",
            "<b>Rather, is it not</b> referring <b>to the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>and this is</b> what <b>it is saying:</b> With regard to <b>a rock</b> protruding from <b>the sea</b> that is <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>high and four</b> handbreadths <b>wide, one may not carry from it to the sea or from the sea to it,</b> as it has the status of a private domain. <b>And how large</b> may it be for this prohibition to apply? <b>Up to</b> the size of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>.

            "<b>Rava said:</b> Only <b>one who does not know how to explain <i>mishnayot</i> raises</b> such <b>refutations against Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> one of the greatest Sages of his generation.

            "<b>Rav Ashi said</b> that the <i>baraita</i> may be explained differently, yet still in a manner that does not refute the words of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>Actually,</b> the final words of the <i>baraita</i> refer <b>to the first clause,</b> as stated by Rav Huna bar Ḥanina. However, one may not infer from them a principle with regard to enclosures, as <b>they said</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is stringent in one case, <b>and they said</b> that the <i>halakha</i> should be lenient in a different case, i.e., the same Sages who were stringent in one case were lenient in another.",
            "How so? <b>They said</b> that in the case of <b>an enclosure greater than</b> the size of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i> that was not</b> originally <b>enclosed</b> with a fence <b>for</b> the purpose of residence, <b>one</b> may <b>carry only</b> a distance of <b>four cubits,</b> as it has the status of a <i>karmelit</i> in this regard. <b>And they</b> also <b>said</b> that <b>one</b> may <b>not carry from a private domain to a <i>karmelit</i>.</b> Both of these <i>halakhot</i> are decrees of the Sages.",
            "Therefore, the Sages developed the following principles: With regard to a rock that is no larger than <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>,</b> so <b>that it is permitted to carry on all of it, the Sages prohibited carrying from the sea to it and from it to the sea. What is the reason</b> for this? It is that the rock <b>is a full-fledged private domain,</b> and they did not permit one to carry from a private domain to a <i>karmelit</i> or vice versa.",
            "However, if it is <b>larger than</b> the size of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>,</b> so <b>that it is prohibited to carry on all of it</b> by rabbinic decree, <b>the Sages permitted carrying from the sea to it and from it to the sea.

It is because the Sages were concerned that <b>perhaps</b> people would <b>say</b> that <b>it is a proper private domain, and they would come to carry on all of it.</b> Were the Sages to prohibit carrying from the rock to the sea, people would think that it is a full-fledged private domain, and they would carry on it. Since all these decrees are rabbinic in nature, the Sages permitted carrying from a private domain to a <i>karmelit</i> in this case in order to prevent people from violating a different rabbinic decree, which prohibits carrying in an enclosure that is greater than the size of two <i>beit se’a</i>. However, no general conclusion may be inferred from this that an enclosure larger than two <i>beit se’a</i> is not a private domain by Torah law.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the difference</b> between the decrees that caused the Sages to choose to uphold the one decree and not the other? The Gemara answers: The difference is that carrying <b>within</b> the rock <b>is common,</b> whereas carrying <b>from it to the sea and from the sea to it is not common.</b> The Sages permitted carrying in the less likely scenario in order to reinforce the decree against carrying within the rock, the more common situation.",
            "The Gemara now relates that there was once <b>a certain baby whose warm water,</b> which had been prepared for his Shabbat circumcision, <b>spilled.

The mishna cites another dispute: If <b>one gave away his rights</b> in his courtyard to the other residents of the courtyard, renouncing them after having forgotten to establish an <i>eiruv</i> with them the previous day, <b>and</b> then <b>he carried</b> something <b>out</b> from his house into the courtyard – <b>whether unwittingly,</b> forgetting that he had renounced his rights, <b>or intentionally, he</b> renders carrying <b>prohibited</b> for all the residents of the courtyard, for his action cancels his renunciation; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If he acted <b>intentionally, he</b> renders carrying <b>prohibited;</b> but if he acted <b>unwittingly, he does not</b> render carrying <b>prohibited.</b>",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara first analyzes the language of the mishna. It states: It is prohibited to bring in objects from the courtyard to his house and to take them out from his house into the courtyard. It can be inferred from this that <b>it is carrying</b> to and from <b>his house</b> that <b>is prohibited, but carrying</b> to and from <b>his</b> share of the <b>courtyard is permitted</b> to the other residents of the courtyard.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> where this ruling applies? <b>If</b> the resident who forgot to establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>renounced</b> his rights, <b>why is his house</b> rendered <b>prohibited?</b> And <b>if he did not renounce</b> his rights, <b>why is his courtyard permitted?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing <b>with</b> a special case, <b>where he renounced his rights in his courtyard</b> to the others <b>but did not renounce his rights in his house</b> to them. <b>And the Rabbis hold that one who renounces his rights in his courtyard has not renounced his rights in his house,</b> as it is common <b>for people to reside in a house without a courtyard.</b>",
            "The Gemara proceeds in its analysis of the mishna: It states that carrying in and out of <b>their</b> houses <b>is permitted for him and for them.</b> The Gemara poses a question: <b>What is the reason</b> that their houses are permitted to him? The Gemara answers: <b>For he is</b> regarded <b>like a guest of theirs,</b> i.e., he is subordinate to them and may carry wherever they may do so.",
            "We learned in the mishna: <b>If</b> the other residents <b>gave</b> away <b>their rights</b> in the courtyard <b>to him, he is permitted</b> to carry from his house into the courtyard, <b>but they are prohibited</b> from doing so. The Gemara asks: <b>But let them,</b> the ones who renounced their rights in the courtyard, <b>be</b> regarded as <b>guests of his,</b> which would enable them to carry as well.

            "The Gemara attempts to draw another inference from the wording of the mishna: Shall we not <b>learn from this,</b> from the order of events in the mishna, that <b>one may renounce</b> his rights in favor of another when he needs it, <b>and then</b> the latter <b>may renounce</b> his rights in favor of the former when he needs it? For the mishna first describes a case in which the one who forgot to establish an <i>eiruv</i> renounces his rights in favor of the others, at which stage they may use the courtyard, and then afterward recounts that the other residents renounce their rights in favor of the one who forgot to establish an <i>eiruv</i>, leaving it permitted for him and prohibited for them.",
            "The Gemara answers: No proof can be brought from here, for <b>this is</b> what the mishna <b>is saying: If they gave away their rights</b> in the courtyard <b>to him at the outset,</b> it is <b>permitted</b> for <b>him and</b> it is <b>prohibited for them.</b> In other words, this is not a continuation of the previous clause, but a separate case.",
            "We learned in the mishna: <b>If two</b> residents of a courtyard forgot to establish an <i>eiruv</i>, and the others renounced their rights in the courtyard in their favor, <b>they</b> render <b>one another prohibited</b> from carrying. The Gemara raises a difficulty: Isn’t this <b>obvious?</b> What novel teaching is stated here? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> this ruling <b>is necessary</b> in a case where the others renounced their rights in the courtyard in favor of the pair, and <b>one of them then renounced</b> his rights <b>in favor of the other.

Therefore, his renunciation is ineffective, and they are both prohibited from carrying.",
            "The mishna explains: <b>For one</b> resident <b>may give away</b> and receive <b>rights</b> in a domain. The Gemara poses a question: <b>Why</b> do <b>I</b> need <b>this further</b> explanation?

            "The Gemara answers: <b>He needed</b> it due to the ruling in <b>the latter clause,</b> which includes the novel teaching that <b>two</b> residents <b>may give away rights</b> in a domain.

            "After explaining the <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara proceeds to clarify the issue at hand: <b>In any event, the first clause is teaching</b> that the person who acquires the convert’s property <b>renders</b> carrying <b>prohibited;</b> but <b>why does he render</b> carrying <b>prohibited? Let him renounce</b> his rights in the domain like an heir. The implication then is that he does not have the option of renunciation, in contrast to the opinion of Rav Naḥman.",
            "Rav Naḥman replied: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the word <b>prohibits that it teaches</b> here? It means he renders carrying prohibited <b>until he renounces</b> his rights, but renunciation is effective.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Who is the <i>tanna</i> of the</b> problematic <b><i>baraitot</i></b> that imply that an heir cannot renounce rights, and from which objections were brought against Rav Naḥman? <b>It is Beit Shammai, who say</b> that <b>there is no renunciation of rights on Shabbat</b> at all, even for the owner of the property. <b>As we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>When may one give away rights</b> in a domain? <b>Beit Shammai say: While it is still day. And Beit Hillel say:</b> Even <b>after nightfall.</b>",
            "With regard to this dispute itself, <b>Ulla said: What is the reason of Beit Hillel</b> that one may renounce rights even after nightfall? This should be considered an act of acquisition, which is prohibited on Shabbat. He explains: <b>It is comparable to one who says: Turn toward the high-quality ones.</b> If a person sets aside <i>teruma</i> from another person’s produce without the latter’s knowledge, and when the owner finds out he says: Why did you set aside this produce? Turn toward the high-quality ones, i.e., you should have gone to find better produce to use as <i>teruma</i>, then the <i>teruma</i> that was separated is considered <i>teruma</i>, provided there was indeed quality produce in that place. The reason is that the owner has demonstrated his retroactive acquiescence to the other person’s setting aside of <i>teruma</i>. Therefore, the latter is considered his agent for this purpose. The same applies to our issue. If a person intended to permit both himself and others to carry in a courtyard by means of establishing an <i>eiruv</i> but forgot to do so, by renouncing his rights after nightfall, he retroactively makes plain his desire that his domain should be mingled with that of his neighbors. What he then does on Shabbat is not a complete action, but merely a demonstration of his intentions.",
            "<b>Abaye said:</b> This explanation is unsatisfactory, as when <b>a gentile dies on Shabbat, what</b> connection <b>is there to</b> the concept: <b>Turn toward the high-quality ones?</b> When a gentile dies on Shabbat, his Jewish neighbors may renounce their rights in the courtyard to each other and thus render carrying in the courtyard permitted, even though such renunciation would have been ineffective prior to his passing. Consequently, it cannot be said that it works retroactively.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara rejects Ulla’s explanation and states that <b>here they disagree over the following: Beit Shammai hold</b> that <b>renunciation of a domain is</b> equivalent to <b>acquisition of a domain, and acquisition of a domain is prohibited on Shabbat. And Beit Hillel hold</b> that <b>it is merely withdrawal from a domain, and withdrawal from a domain seems well on Shabbat,</b> i.e., it is permitted. As such, there is no reason to prohibit renunciation as a form of acquisition, which is prohibited as a part of a decree against conducting commerce on Shabbat.",

            "If, however, he was in partnership <b>with this</b> one <b>in wine and with that</b> one <b>in oil, they must establish an <i>eiruv</i>.</b> As they are not partners in the same item, they are not all considered one partnership. <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> In <b>both this</b> case <b>and that</b> case, i.e., even if he partners with his neighbors in different items, <b>they need not establish an <i>eiruv</i>.</b>",

            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav’s opinion from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>shepherds; fig watchmen,</b> who guard figs spread out in the field; <b>guardsmen</b> who sit in small guardhouses; <b>and produce watchmen; when they customarily sleep in the city</b> in addition to eating there, <b>they are like the residents of the city</b> with regard to their Shabbat limit, even though they were in the field when Shabbat began. However, <b>when they customarily sleep in the field,</b> even though they eat in the town, <b>they have</b> only <b>two thousand</b> cubits <b>in each direction</b> from the places where they sleep. This seems to contradict the opinion of Rav, who maintains that a person’s place of dwelling is determined by where he eats, not by where he sleeps.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of the people in the field, <b>we are witnesses,</b> i.e., it is clearly evident, <b>that if</b> people would <b>bring them bread there,</b> to the place where they sleep, <b>it would be more convenient for them.</b> Fundamentally, however, a person’s dwelling place is determined by where he eats, rather than where he sleeps.",

            "<b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava permits in</b> the case of <b>the slaves,</b> as a slave necessarily follows his master, <b>and he prohibits in</b> the case of <b>the wives,</b> as each woman is significant in her own right, and is not totally dependent on her husband.",

The same applies to any slave vis-à-vis his master.",
            "The Gemara proceeds to clarify various aspects of this issue, starting with a summary of what has already been stated. The <i>halakha</i> is <b>obvious</b> in the case of <b>a son with his father, as we stated</b> it above the mishna. <b>A wife with her husband and a slave with his master</b> are subject to the <b>dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira and Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava.</b> With regard to <b>a student</b> who lives <b>with his master</b> in the same courtyard and receives his sustenance from him, <b>what</b> is his status with regard to <i>eiruv</i>?",

            "<b>Abaye raised a dilemma before Rabba:</b> With regard to <b>five</b> people <b>who</b> live in the same courtyard and <b>collected their <i>eiruv</i>, when they take their <i>eiruv</i> elsewhere</b> in order to merge their courtyard with a different one, is <b>one</b> contribution to the <b><i>eiruv</i></b> sufficient <b>for all of them, or do they need</b> a separate contribution to the <b><i>eiruv</i> for each and every one</b> of them?

            "Abaye asked: <b>But</b> in the case of <b>brothers, who are comparable</b> to people <b>who collected</b> their <i>eiruv</i>, the mishna nonetheless <b>teaches: They require a</b> separate <b><i>eiruv</i> for each and every one</b> of them.

            "The Gemara comments: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> to understand, <b>as</b> the mishna <b>teaches: When</b> do they state this <i>halakha</i>? <b>When they bring their <i>eiruv</i> elsewhere</b> in the courtyard. <b>But if their <i>eiruv</i> was coming to them, or if there are no</b> other <b>residents with them in the courtyard, they do not need to establish an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> as they are considered like a single individual living in a courtyard. <b>Learn from this</b> that the preceding ruling refers to a situation where they shared the courtyard with other residents.",

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the mishna’s determination that the size of the window must be four by four handbreadths, the Gemara asks: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>we learned</b> an <b>unattributed</b> mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the previously cited opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, who said: Any</b> gap <b>less than four</b> handbreadths <b>is considered <i>lavud</i>,</b> i.e., two objects are considered connected if the space between them is less than four handbreadths. That would explain why the window must be four handbreadths in size, as otherwise it would be considered as though it were sealed, based on the principle of <i>lavud</i>.",
            "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>Even if you say</b> that the mishna is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> that only gaps of less than three handbreadths are included in the principle of <i>lavud</i>, <b>the Rabbis disagreed with Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel only with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b><i>lavud</i>,</b> i.e., what is considered connected. <b>But with regard to an opening, even the Rabbis agree that if there is</b> an opening of <b>four by four</b> handbreadths, it is <b>significant, and if not, it is not significant.</b>",
            "It was taught in the mishna: If the window is <b>less than four</b> by four handbreadths, or above ten handbreadths from the ground, the residents of each courtyard must establish a separate <i>eiruv</i>. The Gemara objects: <b>This</b> is <b>obvious. Since</b> the mishna <b>stated</b> in the previous clause that if the window is <b>four by four</b> handbreadths and <b>within ten</b> handbreadths from the ground, they establish one <i>eiruv</i>, <b>from</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>itself I know</b> that if the window is <b>less than four</b> by four handbreadths <b>or above ten</b> handbreadths, they may <b>not</b> establish one <i>eiruv</i>. Why was it necessary to teach this in the mishna?",
            "The Gemara answers: It <b>teaches us this</b> matter: <b>The reason</b> is specifically that <b>the entire</b> window is <b>above ten</b> handbreadths; <b>however,</b> if <b>part of it is within ten</b> handbreadths of the ground, <b>they establish two <i>eiruvin</i>, and if they desire, they</b> may <b>establish one <i>eiruv</i>.</b>",
            "The Gemara comments: According to this explanation, <b>we</b> already <b>learned</b> in the mishna <b>that</b> which <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If nearly <b>all of</b> the window <b>is above ten</b> handbreadths <b>and</b> only a small <b>part of it is within ten</b> handbreadths, or if nearly <b>all of it is within ten</b> handbreadths <b>and</b> only a small <b>part of it is above ten</b> handbreadths, <b>they establish two <i>eiruvin</i>, and if they desire, they</b> may <b>establish one <i>eiruv</i>.</b>",
            "The essential meaning of this <i>baraita</i> is clear, but the Gemara raises a question with regard to its formulation: <b>Now,</b> if nearly <b>all of it is above ten</b> handbreadths <b>and</b> only a small <b>part of it is within ten</b> handbreadths, <b>you said</b> that <b>they establish two <i>eiruvin</i>, and if they desire, they</b> may <b>establish one <i>eiruv</i>,</b> i.e., the window has the status of an opening and therefore the two courtyards may establish a joint <i>eiruv</i>, then <b>is it necessary</b> to state the <i>halakha</i> governing the case where almost <b>all of it is within ten and</b> only a small <b>part of it is above ten?</b>",
            "The Gemara answers that indeed, this <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> employing the style: <b>This, and it is unnecessary to say that,</b> moving from the more difficult and novel case to the easier, more straightforward one.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A circular window must have a circumference of twenty-four handbreadths, with two and a bit of them within ten</b> handbreadths of the ground, <b>so that when he squares</b> the window, i.e., if he forms the shape of a square inside it, it measures four by four handbreadths, and <b>a bit</b> of it <b>is then within ten</b> handbreadths of the ground.",
            "The Gemara poses a question with regard to this calculation: <b>Now, since</b> there is a general principle that <b>any</b> circle <b>with a circumference of three handbreadths is one handbreadth in diameter,</b> then according to this formula, a window with a circumference <b>of twelve</b> handbreadths, meaning that it has a diameter of four handbreadths, should be <b>sufficient</b> to create a window of four by four."

        [
            "<b>This</b> measurement <b>applies</b> only <b>to a circle</b> and the ratio between its circumference and diameter, <b>but with regard to a square</b> that must fit entirely within that circle, <b>we require</b> a circle with a <b>larger</b> circumference. In order for a square of four by four handbreadths to be entirely contained within a circle, the circumference of the circle must measure more than twelve handbreadths",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Now, how much larger is a square than a circle?</b> It is larger by <b>one quarter.</b> If so, a circle <b>with</b> a circumference of <b>sixteen</b> handbreadths at most should <b>suffice.</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> statement that a square is larger than a circle by a quarter <b>applies</b> only <b>to a circle circumscribed by a square, but</b> with regard to <b>a square circumscribed by a circle, we require more,</b> and the difference between the square and the circle is greater. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>due to the projection of the corners</b> of the square, as the distance from the center of the square to its corners is greater than the distance from the center to its sides.",
            "The Gemara further objects: <b>Since every cubit in</b> the side of <b>a square</b> is <b>a cubit and two-fifths in the diagonal,</b> a square of four by four handbreadths has a diagonal of five and three-fifths handbreadths. And since the diameter of a circle equals the diagonal of the square that it encompasses, the circle circumscribing a square of four by four handbreadths has a diameter of five and three-fifths handbreadths. If that measure is multiplied by three to arrive at the circumference of that circle, the result is that a circle with a circumference of <b>seventeen handbreadths minus a fifth is sufficient</b> to circumscribe a square of four by four handbreadths. Why, then, does Rabbi Yoḥanan say that a circular window must have a circumference of twenty-four handbreadths?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan spoke in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the judges of Caesarea, and some say in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Sages of Caesarea, who say: A circle</b> that is circumscribed <b>within a square</b> is smaller than it by <b>one quarter;</b> with regard to <b>a square</b> that is circumscribed <b>within a circle,</b> the difference between them is equal to <b>half</b> the square. According to this explanation, Rabbi Yoḥanan calculated as follows: Since a square of four by four handbreadths has a perimeter of sixteen handbreadths, the circumference of the circle that encompasses it must be fifty percent larger, or twenty-four handbreadths.",
            "It was taught in the mishna: If a window is <b>less than four by four</b> handbreadths, or if it is above ten handbreadths from the ground, the residents of the two courtyards may not establish one joint <i>eiruv</i> but must instead establish two independent ones. <b>Rav Naḥman said: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> of a window within ten handbreadths of the ground <b>only</b> with regard to <b>a window between two courtyards.

            "<b>Rava raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman</b> from that which was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A window between two courtyards, and a window between two houses, and a window between two attics, and a window between two roofs, and a window between two rooms are all one and the same to me; they all</b> must be <b>four by four</b> handbreadths and <b>within ten</b> handbreadths from the ground.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Explain</b> that this <i>halakha</i> of ten handbreadths mentioned in the <i>baraita</i> is referring only to <b>courtyards.</b> The Gemara objects: <b>Doesn’t</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach: Are all one and the same to me,</b> indicating that they are all equal in this regard? Rather, <b>explain</b> that they are all equal in that the window must be the size of <b>four by four</b> handbreadths, but not that all must be within ten handbreadths of the ground.",

            "The Gemara clarifies the two sides of the question: <b>When we say</b> that <b>a house is considered as though it</b> were <b>filled,</b> does <b>this apply</b> only to a window positioned <b>on the side, but not</b> to a window <b>in the middle?</b> In that case, the opening would not be viewed as near the full part of the house, and a permanent ladder would be required. <b>Or perhaps there is no difference,</b> and since the house is considered filled, no ladder is necessary.",
            "Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: It is not necessary.</b> The Sages <b>understood from</b> this response that he meant that <b>a permanent ladder is not required, but a temporary ladder is required.</b> However, <b>it is stated</b> in this regard: <b>Rav Yosef bar Manyumi said</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said: Neither a permanent ladder nor a temporary ladder is required,</b> as the fact that the opening is located within the house is sufficient to render it permitted to carry from the house to the attic.",

This presents a challenge to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion.",
            "The Gemara answers that <b>this is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying:</b> If the top of the wall between the two courtyards <b>is four by four</b> handbreadths, then to <b>ascend, yes,</b> it is permitted.

            "<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan followed his</b> line of <b>reasoning</b> in this regard, <b>as when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> With regard to <b>a place that does not have</b> an area of <b>four by four</b> handbreadths and is situated between a public and a private domain, <b>it is permissible for</b> both <b>the people in the public domain and for the people in the private domain to</b> adjust the burden on their <b>shoulders upon it, provided they do not exchange</b> objects between them from one domain to the other domain.

Therefore, there is no need to impose decrees and enactments in order to preserve them. The same is not true of rabbinic decrees; if people ignore the preventive measures, they might come to violate the entire enactment.",
            "<b>Rabba said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> With regard to <b>a wall that is between two courtyards,</b> and <b>one side</b> facing one courtyard is <b>ten handbreadths high, and the other side is level with the ground</b> of the second courtyard, i.e., the second courtyard is built on a higher plane, so that the wall is less than ten handbreadths above its floor, in this case the Sages <b>grant</b> the use of the top of the wall on Shabbat only <b>to the</b> courtyard in which the wall is <b>level with the ground.</b>",
            "The reason is <b>because the use of</b> the wall <b>is convenient for one</b> side, i.e., the higher courtyard, <b>but difficult for the other</b> side. The wall can be used more conveniently by the residents of the higher courtyard. <b>And</b> the principle is that in <b>any</b> case with regard to Shabbat where an action is <b>convenient for one</b> party <b>and difficult for another,</b> the Sages <b>grant it to the one for whom its use is convenient.</b>",
            "Similarly, <b>Rav Sheizvi said</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> In the case of <b>a ditch between two courtyards, one side of which is ten</b> handbreadths <b>deep, and the other side of which is level with the ground</b> of the second courtyard, i.e., is less than ten handbreadths below it, the Sages <b>grant</b> the use of the ditch <b>to the</b> courtyard in which the ditch is <b>level with the ground.</b> This is <b>because it is</b> a case in which <b>the use of</b> the ditch <b>is convenient for one</b> side, where it is close to level with the ground, <b>and difficult for the other,</b> where the ditch is ten handbreadths deep, and whenever use of an item is convenient for one party and inconvenient for another, it is granted to the one for whom it is convenient.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> it was <b>necessary</b> to cite both of these cases, as it would not have been possible to learn one from the other, <b>since, had</b> Rav Naḥman <b>taught us</b> only the case <b>with regard to a wall,</b> one could have said that the <i>halakha</i> applies only in that case, <b>because people use an elevated</b> surface.

            "<b>And</b> likewise, <b>had he taught us</b> only the case <b>with regard to a ditch,</b> one could have said that the <i>halakha</i> applies only in that case, <b>because its use does not cause worry,</b> as anything placed in the ditch is protected. <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>a wall, the use of which causes worry</b> that the objects placed there are liable to fall, one might <b>say</b> that it may <b>not</b> be used by the residents of either courtyard. Therefore, it was <b>necessary</b> to state both of these rulings.",
            "With regard to a wall between two courtyards, the Gemara states: If <b>one comes to diminish</b> the height of the wall by placing a stone next to it, or by building a platform in order to permit its use or to utilize it as a passageway to another courtyard, the following distinction applies: <b>If the diminished</b> section <b>is</b> at least <b>four handbreadths</b> wide, <b>it is permitted to use the entire wall.</b> This area has the status of an entrance and the two courtyards are considered one, which renders the entire wall permitted. <b>However, if</b> the diminished section is <b>not</b> at least four handbreadths wide, <b>one</b> may <b>use only the</b> area of the wall <b>opposite</b> the <b>diminished</b> section, but no more.",

Since it can be removed at any moment on Shabbat, such an object cannot be viewed as a permanent part of the wall. The Gemara answers: <b>No, it is necessary;</b> this basin can be considered a permanent part of the wall in a case <b>where he attached</b> the basin <b>to the ground</b> by covering it with soil. The basin may then not be moved on Shabbat due to the prohibition of handling soil.",

            "The Gemara further challenges this explanation: <b>And if</b> the basin <b>has a rim, what of it? Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: With regard to <b>one who buries a turnip or a radish</b> in the ground <b>beneath a vine</b> for safekeeping, <b>when</b>"

            "<b>Rav Huna said:</b> If <b>a pillar in the public domain</b> is <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>high and four</b> handbreadths <b>wide,</b> so that it is considered a private domain, <b>and one drove a stake of any</b> size <b>into</b> the top of <b>it, he has diminished its</b> area.

            "<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said:</b> This applies only if the stake is at least <b>three</b> handbreadths <b>high.</b> If it is less than three handbreadths high, it is considered part of the top of the pillar, based on the principle of <i>lavud</i>. This is in contrast to <b>Abaye and Rava, who both say: Even if</b> the stake is <b>not three</b> handbreadths <b>high,</b> the pillar is no longer considered a private domain.",
            "<b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion of Abaye and Rava? It is that the pillar <b>is no longer</b> fit to be <b>used,</b> as a surface of four by four handbreadths is suitable for use only when it is level. If it has even a small projection, it is no longer usable.",
            "<b>Rav Ashi said: Even a stake three</b> handbreadths <b>high</b> does not diminish the area of the pillar. <b>What is the reason</b> for this?

            "<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi:</b> According to your opinion, if <b>he filled it entirely with stakes,</b> i.e., if he drove so many stakes into the top of the post that it was completely filled, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?",
            "Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Did you not hear that</b> which <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said?</b> He said that <b>a pit and its embankment</b> of stone around the edge <b>join</b> together to complete the measure of <b>ten</b> handbreadths.

            "<b>Abaye said: Here, we are dealing with</b> the case of a <b>house</b> that is <b>slightly less than thirteen</b> handbreadths high <b>and the hay</b> is <b>ten</b> handbreadths high. The haystack is less than three handbreadths from the ceiling, and based on the principle of <i>lavud</i>, they are considered joined as though the partitions reach the ceiling.",
            "<b>And Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is dealing <b>with a house ten</b> handbreadths high,"
        ],
        [
            "<b>and</b> the <b>hay</b> in the house is <b>slightly more than seven</b> handbreadths high it is considered a full-fledged partition that reaches the ceiling, as objects separated by <b>any</b> gap of <b>less than three</b> handbreadths <b>are considered joined,</b> based on the principle of <i>lavud</i>.",
            "The Gemara comments. <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Abaye, that is why</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches:</b> If the height of the haystack was reduced to less <b>than ten</b> handbreadths. <b>However, according to Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, what is</b> the meaning of: Less <b>than ten?</b> Even at the outset it was never as high as ten handbreadths.",
            "The Gemara answers: It means that it was reduced to less <b>than the law of ten</b> handbreadths. As long as the hay is slightly more than seven handbreadths high, it is regarded as ten handbreadths high, in accordance with the principle of <i>lavud</i>. Once its height is reduced to less than seven handbreadths, the <i>halakha</i> of a partition ten handbreadths high is no longer in effect.",
            "The same <i>baraita</i> taught that if the height of the hay was reduced to less than ten handbreadths, it is <b>prohibited</b> to carry in <b>both.</b> The Gemara comments: Should we <b>learn from this</b> that <b>residents who arrive on Shabbat prohibit</b> the other residents from carrying? At the onset of Shabbat, both sets of residents were permitted to use the hay and the house, but once the hay was reduced on Shabbat it is as though new residents had been added to each of the courtyards, and it is prohibited for all of them to carry. Why not say that since at the beginning of Shabbat it was permitted to carry in the domain, they are permitted to do so for its duration?",
            "The Gemara rejects this contention: <b>Perhaps</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the hay <b>was</b> already <b>reduced on the previous day,</b> before Shabbat began. In that case, it was never permitted to carry at all.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>How,</b> then, <b>does</b> the resident of one of the courtyards <b>act</b> if he seeks to permit use of the other courtyard to its resident? He <b>locks his house and renounces his right</b> to carry in the courtyard in favor of the other person. The Gemara is surprised by this ruling: Does he require these <b>two</b> steps? One should suffice. The Gemara answers: <b>This is what</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: Either he locks his house or he renounces his right</b> to the courtyard.",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> a different explanation instead. <b>Actually, both</b> actions are required in this case, even though one of them would ordinarily suffice. The reason is: <b>Since he is accustomed to</b> using the courtyard, <b>he will come to carry.</b> Consequently, the Sages were stringent with a person in this position and obligated him to implement an additional change so that he will not forget and come to carry when it is prohibited.",
            "It was taught in the <i>baraita</i>: If one locks his house and renounces his rights to the courtyard, <b>it is prohibited</b> for him to carry, <b>and it is permitted</b> for <b>the other</b> person to carry. The Gemara raises a difficulty: Isn’t this <b>obvious?</b> Why was it necessary to state this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary only</b> in a case <b>where the other</b> person <b>then renounced</b> his right in favor <b>of the first</b> person. <b>And</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us that</b> one <b>may not renounce</b> his rights in favor of the other, <b>and then</b> have the latter <b>renounce</b> his own rights in favor of the former.",
            "It was further taught in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And you</b> can <b>say likewise with regard to a pit of hay that</b> is situated <b>between two Shabbat limits.</b> The inhabitants of each area may feed their animals from the common hay. The Gemara raises a difficulty: Isn’t this <b>obvious?</b> The same principle that is in effect with regard to a haystack between courtyards should apply here as well. The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> only <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who said</b> that the principle of Shabbat <b>boundaries</b> is <b>by Torah law. Lest you say</b> that <b>let us issue a decree</b> and prohibit it, <b>lest</b> people <b>come to exchange</b> objects from one boundary to another, which would violate a Torah prohibition; therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that no distinction is made between the cases, and no decree of this kind is issued.",

            "The Gemara answers: <b>This is</b> the subject of a dispute between <b>the <i>tanna’im</i>, as Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> There was <b>an incident involving</b> the <b>daughter-in-law of Rabbi Oshaya, who went</b> before Shabbat <b>to the bathhouse,</b> which was located beyond the Shabbat boundary, <b>and it grew dark</b> before <b>she</b> was able to return, <b>and her mother-in-law established a joining</b> of Shabbat boundaries for her so that she could return home.",

            "The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult.</b> In <b>this</b> case, where Shmuel said that a wife may establish an <i>eiruv</i> without her husband’s knowledge, he was referring to a situation where the husband <b>would prohibit</b> his neighbors from carrying if he did not join their <i>eiruv</i>, and the <i>halakha</i> is therefore lenient, as a wife may establish an <i>eiruv</i> on his behalf. However, in <b>that</b> case, the <i>baraita</i>, which states that his wife may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> without his knowledge, is referring to a situation where <b>he would not prohibit</b> his neighbors from carrying.",
            "The Gemara adds: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> that this is the correct interpretation, <b>as if</b> you do not say <b>this,</b> there is <b>a contradiction between</b> this ruling <b>of Shmuel and</b> another ruling <b>of Shmuel.

        [
            "The Gemara answers: <b>It is different there, as there are no partitions.</b> That alley is breached, and it is therefore fitting to compel its residents to establish some sort of partition, if only for the sake of protection. However, if there are partitions, one is not obligated to join in a merging of alleyways.",
            "<b>Another version</b> of this explanation: <b>From the side it is different,</b> i.e., the preparation of an <i>eiruv</i> does not involve an adjustment to the alleyway itself, but rather it is a side issue. Consequently, an individual cannot be forced to participate in its preparation (<i>Meir Netiv</i>).",
            "<b>It is stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disputed this issue. <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said: One</b> may <b>build a side post</b> from the wood of <b>an <i>asheira</i>.</b> Although it is prohibited to benefit from the tree and it must be burned, setting up a side post is a mitzva, and mitzvot were not given for benefit, i.e., the fulfillment of a mitzva is not in itself considered a benefit. <b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: One</b> may <b>build a</b> cross <b>beam</b> from the wood of <b>an <i>asheira</i>.</b>",

With regard to a side post, by contrast, a minimum width suffices, which means that even wood from an <i>asheira</i> is fit, despite the fact that it is viewed as burned.",

Consequently, he must inform them with which alleyway he prepared the merging, in case they preferred to join the other alleyway. <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>a courtyard</b> that opens into only <b>one alleyway,</b> the merging of the alleyway only benefits them and does not harm them in any way, and you might therefore <b>say no,</b> that even the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna concedes that it is not necessary to inform them. Rav Ḥisda therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna maintains that he must inform them in all cases, contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda.",
            "The mishna continues: <b>What is the measure</b> of food required for a merging of the alleyways? It then specifies different amounts when the residents of the alley are numerous and when they are few. The Gemara asks: <b>How many are numerous,</b> and how many are considered few? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Eighteen people</b> are considered numerous. The Gemara registers surprise: <b>Eighteen and no more?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Say: From eighteen upward.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And what is</b> the significance of the number <b>eighteen</b> that <b>he cited?</b> Why this figure in particular? The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, said: It was explained to me</b> personally <b>by my father,</b> Rav Yehuda: <b>Any</b> case where, <b>if</b> one were to <b>divide</b> the food of <b>two meals between them and it does not amount to</b> the measure of <b>a dried fig for each and every one of them, these are the very ones</b> the <i>tanna</i> called <b>numerous, and</b> in this case <b>food for two meals suffices</b> for all of them. <b>And if not, these are the very ones</b> the <i>tanna</i> termed <b>few,</b> which means food in the measure of a dried fig is required for each of them.",
            "And Rav Yehuda <b>incidentally teaches us that</b> food for <b>two meals consists of</b> a measure equal to <b>eighteen dried figs.</b> Consequently, if there were numerous residents in the alley, then eighteen dried figs, which is food sufficient for two meals, is enough for them.",

Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b> There is nonetheless a concern <b>lest the problem recur,</b> as one of them might give an entire loaf and proceed to complain about his neighbor who donated only a partial loaf.",
            "A portion of dough, known as <i>ḥalla</i>, must be set aside and given to the priests. If <i>ḥalla</i> was not set aside from the dough, it must be separated from the baked bread. Moreover, if one part <i>teruma</i> fell into a hundred parts non-sacred produce, a proportionate amount must be removed from the mixture and given to a priest, after which the remainder may be eaten. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Shaul said: If one removed from</b> the loaf <b>as much as</b> must be set aside for <b>its <i>ḥalla</i>, or as much as</b> must be separated <b>from a mixture</b> of <i>teruma</i> and non-sacred produce, <b>he</b> may <b>establish an <i>eiruv</i> with</b> that loaf. The reason is that in this case people would not complain that he did not give a whole loaf, as they would assume the loaf had a small part missing because <i>ḥalla</i> had been separated from it, or because <i>teruma</i> had fallen into the dough, which necessitated the separation of a certain portion. However, if more than this amount was missing, people would suspect him of eating from the <i>eiruv</i>.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Wasn’t it was taught</b> otherwise in a <i>baraita</i>: If a loaf was missing <b>as much as</b> must be removed <b>from a mixture</b> of <i>teruma</i> and non-sacred produce, <b>one may establish an <i>eiruv</i> with it,</b> but if it was missing <b>as much as</b> must be removed for <b>its <i>ḥalla</i>, one may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> with it?</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as the two sources are not dealing with the same amounts. In <b>this</b> case, where the <i>tanna</i> permitted a loaf that was missing the amount that must be removed for <i>ḥalla</i>, he is referring <b>to a baker’s <i>ḥalla</i>,</b> which is a smaller amount and is therefore not considered a significant reduction of the loaf. However, in <b>that</b> case, where the <i>tanna</i> did not permit a loaf that was lacking the amount that must be removed for <i>ḥalla</i>, it is referring <b>to an</b> ordinary <b>homeowner’s <i>ḥalla</i>.</b> This <i>ḥalla</i> portion is larger in size, and consequently the loaf may not be used for an <i>eiruv</i> if it is missing such a large amount.",
            "The Gemara explains that this is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>The measure of <i>ḥalla</i></b> fixed by the Sages is <b>one twenty-fourth</b> of the dough.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> bread which the dog refused to eat <b>was</b> a mixture of <b>various types</b> of grain. It was baked in order to discover the taste of a bread of mixed ingredients and was similar to that which the prophet Ezekiel was commanded to eat, as it is written: <b>“Take you for yourself wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt,</b> and put them in one vessel, and make them for yourself into bread” (Ezekiel 4:9).

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara poses a question: <b>What is the reason for Rabbi Eliezer’s</b> opinion that one who gave money to a grocer or a baker has acquired possession of the food for the <i>eiruv</i>? This ruling is difficult, as <b>he did not</b> perform a transaction by <b>pulling</b> the food into his possession, and one can acquire an object only by performing a valid act of acquisition.",
            "<b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Abbahu said: Rabbi Eliezer established</b> this acquisition so that it should be <b>like the four times during the year</b> that the payment of money effects acquisition, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>On these four times</b> every year, on the eves of Passover, <i>Shavuot</i>, Rosh HaShana, and the Eighth Day of Assembly, one who paid for meat may <b>force the butcher to slaughter</b> an animal against his will. <b>Even</b> if his <b>ox</b> was <b>worth a thousand dinar, and the customer has</b> paid for <b>only one dinar’s</b> worth of meat, the customer may <b>force</b> the butcher <b>to slaughter</b> it, so that the buyer can receive his meat. The reason is that on these four occasions everyone buys meat, and therefore the butcher who promised to supply the customer with meat must give it to him, even if this causes the butcher a considerable loss.",
            "<b>Therefore, if</b> the ox <b>died, it died at the buyer’s</b> expense. That is to say, he must bear the loss and is not entitled to get his dinar back. The Gemara asks: Why is this so? The customer <b>did not pull</b> the ox into his possession. As he did not perform an act of acquisition, he has not acquired any part of the ox, and his dinar should therefore be restored to him. <b>Rav Huna said:</b> We are dealing here with a case <b>where he did pull</b> the ox into his possession.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so, say the latter clause</b> of that mishna as follows: With regard to <b>the rest of the days of the year, it is not so. Therefore, if</b> the animal <b>died, it died at the seller’s</b> expense. If, as Rav Huna claims, the mishna is referring to a case where the purchaser had already pulled the animal into his possession, <b>why</b> must the seller suffer the loss? Since the customer <b>pulled</b> it into his possession and has acquired it, the ox died in his possession.",
            "<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said: Actually,</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the customer <b>did not pull</b> the animal into his possession. <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing <b>with</b> a case <b>where</b> the butcher <b>conferred possession upon</b> his customer <b>by means of another</b> person, i.e., the butcher conferred possession upon the customer by instructing another person to acquire a dinar’s worth of the ox’s meat on his behalf, without having obtained his consent.",
            "Consequently, <b>at these four times, when it is for his benefit,</b> as everyone wishes to buy meat on these days, <b>one may act for his benefit in his absence,</b> and the acquisition is valid. With regard to <b>the rest of the days of the year, when it is to his disadvantage,</b> as it obligates him in payment and he might have no interest in this purchase, <b>one may act to his disadvantage only in his presence.</b>",
            "<b>And Rav Ila said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: At these four times, the Sages based their statement on Torah law,</b> i.e., they ruled in accordance with Torah law. <b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan said: By Torah law,</b> the payment of <b>money</b> is an effective act of acquisition, which <b>acquires</b> movable property. Merchandise that is purchased with money is immediately transferred to the ownership of the buyer.",
            "<b>And why,</b> then, <b>did</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that the mode of acquisition of <b>pulling,</b> not monetary payment, <b>acquires</b> movable goods? It is <b>a decree</b> issued by the Sages, <b>lest</b> the seller <b>say to</b> a buyer who has already paid for his merchandise: <b>Your wheat was burned in the upper story</b> of my house, and you have lost everything. According to Torah law, once the buyer pays, he owns the merchandise wherever it is located. As this state of affairs can lead to fraud, the Sages instituted that only an act of physical transfer of the item purchased can finalize the sale. On these four occasions, however, the Sages ordained that Torah law remains in effect. Rabbi Eliezer maintains that this enactment applies to an <i>eiruv</i> as well.",

The reason for their disqualification is that those who play games of chance do not fully relinquish ownership of their gambling money, as they expect to win their bet. Consequently, one who accepts money in such circumstances has effectively taken something that the giver has not wholeheartedly handed over, and he is therefore like a robber, at least by rabbinic decree. The list of those disqualified from giving testimony includes <b>merchants</b> who trade in the produce <b>of the Sabbatical Year,</b> which may be eaten but may not be sold as an object of commerce.",

Rabbi Yehuda maintains that one who earns money by means of games of chance is not a criminal or a robber. Rather, the reason why these people are disqualified from giving testimony is because they are not occupied in the constructive development of the world. As they earn their money without effort, they do not care about the monetary losses of others. Consequently, if they have any other occupation, they are valid witnesses.",

            "<b>Rav Beruna sat and stated this <i>halakha</i></b> in the name of Rav. <b>Rabbi Elazar, a student of the Torah academy, said to him: Did Rav</b> actually <b>say this?</b> Rav Beruna <b>said to him: Yes,</b> he did. He said to him: <b>Show me his</b> place of <b>lodging,</b> and I will go and ask him myself. <b>He showed him</b> where Rav lived. Rabbi Elazar <b>came before Rav</b> and <b>said to him:</b> Did <b>the Master</b> actually <b>say this? He said to him: Yes,</b> I did.",
            "Rabbi Elazar then <b>said to</b> Rav: Since you prohibit using the middle ruin, you evidently maintain that one person renders it prohibited for another by way of the air. That being the case, it must be that you permit the resident of each house to use the adjacent ruin because one’s use of the ruin, while not convenient for him, is more convenient than the other person’s usage. <b>But wasn’t it the Master</b> himself who <b>said:</b> With regard to a place that can be used by the residents of <b>the one</b> courtyard only <b>by lowering</b> an object down to it <b>and</b> by the residents of <b>another</b> courtyard only <b>by throwing</b> an object on top of it, so that neither courtyard has convenient access to it, <b>both</b> sets of residents <b>are prohibited</b> from using it, although lowering an object is more convenient than throwing it?",
            "Rav <b>said to him: Do you think that</b> we are dealing with a case of three ruins <b>positioned</b> alongside each other <b>in</b> a straight <b>line? No. They are</b> arranged in the form <b>of a tripod</b>, i.e. in a triangular form. In other words, two of the ruins, each adjacent to one of the houses, are located next to each other; the third is positioned adjacent to one side of the other two, near both houses. The middle ruin is prohibited to the residents of both houses because both houses have equally inconvenient but direct access to it. However, each of the other ruins is permitted to the resident of the adjacent house, as he has direct access to it, while the resident of the other house can reach it only through the air of the ruin nearest to him, and Rav maintains that one person does not render it prohibited for use by another by way of the air.",
            "<b>Rav Pappa said to Rava: Let us say</b> that <b>Shmuel,</b> who maintains that one renders it prohibited for another by way of the air, <b>does not agree with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Dimi. When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A place less than four by four</b> handbreadths in size is an exempt domain with respect to carrying on Shabbat. Consequently, if this place is located between a public domain and a private domain, <b>it is permitted for</b> both <b>the people in the public domain and the people in the private domain to adjust</b> the burden <b>on their shoulders in it, as long as they do not exchange</b> objects with each other by way of the exempt domain. According to Shmuel’s opinion this should be prohibited due to the air of a different domain.",
            "Rava replied: <b>There,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan is dealing <b>with</b> an exempt domain situated between a public domain and a private domain, the two existing <b>domains by Torah law.</b> In that case, the Sages did not prohibit the use of the place due to the air. By contrast, <b>here,</b> with regard to the air between private domains, we are dealing <b>with domains</b> between which carrying is prohibited <b>by rabbinic law, and the Sages reinforced their statements</b> even <b>more than those of the Torah;</b> they added preventive measures in order to safeguard their decrees. Consequently, according to Shmuel, the Sages indeed decreed that one renders it prohibited for another by way of the air.",
            "<b>Ravina said to Rava: But did Rav</b> actually <b>say this,</b> that one person does not render it prohibited for use by another by way of the air? <b>But wasn’t it stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> disagreed with regard to <b>two houses</b> belonging to one person that stood <b>on two</b> opposite <b>sides of a public domain. Rabba bar Rav Huna</b> said that <b>Rav said:</b> It is <b>prohibited to throw</b> an object <b>from one</b> house <b>to the other; and Shmuel said</b> that it is <b>permitted to throw from one to the other.</b> Rav apparently forbade the act of throwing due to the prohibited air of the public domain that lies between the two houses.",
            "Rava <b>said to him: Wasn’t it established that one</b> house was relatively <b>higher and the</b> other <b>one</b> was <b>lower</b> than the first? Rav prohibited throwing from one domain to the other, not due to the air of the public domain, but rather due to the difficulty of throwing from a low place to a higher one, as the thrown object <b>might sometimes roll and fall</b> back into the public domain <b>and</b> people might <b>come to pick it up</b> and carry it from the public domain to the private domain. It was for this reason that Rav prohibited throwing an object from one house to another.",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is he teaching us</b> by this? <b>We have</b> already <b>learned</b> this in the mishna: With regard to <b>one who placed his <i>eiruv</i> in a gatehouse</b> or in <b>a portico</b> or in <b>a balcony, it is not a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i>.</b> It can be inferred from the mishna that <b>an <i>eiruv</i>, it is not, a merging</b> of the alleyway, it <b>is.</b> What, then, is novel in this statement?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary for him</b> to teach the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a gatehouse</b> that belongs <b>to an individual and</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the airspace</b> of <b>an alleyway, which we did not learn</b> in the mishna. <b>This was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who placed his <i>eiruv</i> in a gatehouse,</b> or in <b>a portico, or</b> in <b>a balcony, or in a courtyard, or in an alleyway, this is</b> a valid <b><i>eiruv</i>. But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that this <b>is not an <i>eiruv</i>?</b> Rather, you must <b>say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> should read: <b>This is</b> a valid <b>merging</b> of the alleyway.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: But if one places the food of the <b>merging</b> of the alleyway <b>in the alleyway</b> itself, it is <b>not</b> properly <b>guarded,</b> which means that it is as though he has not placed the merging of the alleyway there at all. Rather, you must <b>say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> should read: If he placed his merging of the alleyway <b>in a courtyard in the alleyway,</b> it is valid.",
            "<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> If there were <b>a group</b> of people <b>who were dining</b> together on Shabbat eve, <b>and the day became sanctified for them,</b> i.e., Shabbat began while they were eating, <b>they may rely upon the bread on the table for an <i>eiruv</i></b> of courtyards, so that they are all permitted to carry in the courtyard. <b>And some say</b> they may rely on the bread <b>for a merging</b> of the alleyway.",
            "<b>Rabba said:</b> The two versions <b>do not disagree</b> with regard to whether the bread counts as an <i>eiruv</i> or a merging of the alleyway. Rather, <b>here,</b> the teaching that states it can be used as an <i>eiruv</i>, is referring to a case <b>where</b> they are <b>dining in the house,</b> as food deposited in a house can be used as an <i>eiruv</i> for the courtyard. By contrast, <b>there</b> it is referring to a situation <b>where</b> they are <b>dining in the courtyard,</b> and they may therefore rely on the bread only as a merging of the alleyway but not as an <i>eiruv</i>.",
            "<b>Abaye said to Rabba:</b> A <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught that supports you.

            "We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: If</b> the homeowner <b>has there,</b> in the hay shed or one of the other places listed, <b>a right of usage,</b> the person living there does not render the courtyard prohibited. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances of a right of usage?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>For example, the courtyard of</b> a man named <b>Bonyas,</b> an extremely wealthy individual who allowed various people to take up residence on his property, and he kept some of his many possessions in the living quarters assigned to those people. As he retained the right to remove his articles from their apartments, those areas continued to be regarded as quarters belonging to Bonyas and the people living there were deemed members of his household.",
            "The Gemara relates another incident involving Bonyas and his wealth: The <b>son of Bonyas came before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. Realizing from his visitor’s clothing that he was dealing with a wealthy individual, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to</b> his attendants: <b>Make way for one</b> who possesses <b>one hundred <i>maneh</i>,</b> i.e., one hundred times one hundred <i>zuz</i>, as one of this status deserves to be honored in accordance with his riches.

            "<b>Make way</b> even more <b>for one</b> who possesses <b>two hundred <i>maneh</i>.

            "In explanation of this story, the Gemara comments: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi would <b>honor the wealthy,</b> and <b>Rabbi Akiva would</b> likewise <b>honor the wealthy, in accordance with Rava bar Mari’s interpretation</b> of the verse: <b>“May he be enthroned before God forever; appoint mercy and truth, that they may preserve him”</b> (Psalms 61:8). <b>When may he be enthroned before God forever? When he appoints</b> [<b><i>man</i></b>] <b>mercy and truth that they may preserve him.</b> Rava bar Mari explains the word <i>man</i> as referring to portions of food and interprets the verse as follows: If one provides food to others, he deserves to be enthroned before God, to be shown honor and respect. Consequently, it is proper to honor the wealthy who bestow such kindnesses.",
            "<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said:</b> What is considered a right of usage? <b>For example,</b> if the homeowner stores <b>the pin of a plough</b> in his tenant’s quarters. The tenant is prohibited to remove this pin from his residence on Shabbat due to its being set aside from use [<i>muktze</i>], and the homeowner therefore enjoys a fixed right of usage there.",
            "<b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> A Sage <b>of the school of Shmuel taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: If the homeowner stores <b>an object that can be moved on Shabbat</b> with his tenant, the tenant’s residence <b>renders</b> the other residence <b>prohibited</b> if he neglected to join the <i>eiruv</i>. This is not considered a right of usage. If the <b>object</b> being stored is one <b>that cannot be moved on Shabbat,</b> the tenant’s residence <b>does not render it prohibited for</b> them to use the courtyard.",
            "The Gemara adds: <b>So too, it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that if the tenant <b>has untithed produce</b> that may not be moved on Shabbat; or if <b>he has lumps</b> of glass or iron; <b>or anything</b> else <b>that may not be moved on Shabbat</b> that the homeowner deposited with him, the tenant <b>does not render it prohibited for</b> the other residents to use the courtyard.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who leaves his house,</b> which is located in a shared courtyard, <b>and goes to spend Shabbat in a different town, whether</b> he is <b>a gentile or a Jew, he renders it prohibited</b> for the other residents to use the courtyard as though he were still at home; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: He does not render it prohibited for</b> them, as he left behind him an empty residence.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yosei says: A gentile renders it prohibited</b> but <b>a Jew does not render it prohibited,</b> as <b>it is not the manner of a Jew to come</b> home <b>on Shabbat.</b> A Jew will not return home, therefore his empty residence does not render it prohibited. By contrast, a gentile might return over the course of Shabbat. Therefore, he is not considered to have fully uprooted himself from his house, and he renders it prohibited.",
            "<b>Rabbi Shimon says: Even</b> if the Jew <b>left his house and went to spend Shabbat with his daughter</b> who lived <b>in the same town, he does not render it prohibited.</b> Although he can return home at any time, it is assumed <b>that he has already removed from his mind</b> any thought of going back there and has established his Shabbat residence away from his home.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> if one went to <b>his daughter’s</b> house; <b>but</b> if he went to <b>his son’s</b> house, <b>no,</b> this is not the <i>halakha</i>. One cannot be sure that he will be able to stay at his son’s house, for his daughter-in-law might object to his presence and force him to return home. <b>As people say: If a dog barks at you, enter; if a female dog barks at you, leave.</b> In other words, the objections of a female, such as one’s daughter-in-law, who will certainly not be opposed by her husband, are more powerful than those of a male, such as one’s son-in-law.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>a cistern that is</b> located <b>between two courtyards,</b> situated partly in each courtyard, <b>one may not draw</b> water <b>from it on Shabbat,</b> lest the residents of one courtyard draw water from the domain of the other courtyard, <b>unless a partition ten handbreadths high was erected for it</b> as a separation between the domains.

            "<b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said:</b> This is the subject of an early dispute of <i>tanna’im</i>, as <b>Beit Shammai said</b> that the partition, which permits drawing water, must be placed <b>below; and Beit Hillel said</b> it should be positioned <b>above. Rabbi Yehuda said: A partition is no better than the wall between them.</b> A wall dividing the two courtyards passes over the cistern, therefore it is not necessary to erect an additional partition in the cistern’s airspace.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Huna said:</b> When Beit Shammai said <b>below,</b> they meant <b>actually below,</b> near the water; the partition need not touch the water itself. When Beit Hillel said <b>above,</b> they meant <b>actually above,</b> higher than the water and near the rim of the cistern. <b>And both of these</b> are within the airspace of the <b>cistern. And Rav Yehuda said: Below</b> means <b>below the water,</b> so that part of the partition is inside the water; whereas <b>above</b> means <b>above the water,</b> in such a manner that the partition does not come into contact with the water.",
            "<b>Rabba bar Rav Ḥanan said to Abaye:</b> With regard to <b>that</b> which <b>Rav Yehuda said: Below</b> means <b>below the water, what is different</b> about a case where the partition is <b>actually below,</b> in the airspace cistern near the water, that led Rav Yehuda to say that one may <b>not</b> draw water in that case? It is <b>because</b> he was concerned lest <b>the water</b> of the two courtyards <b>become intermingled</b> beneath the partition. In a case where the partition is located <b>below the water,</b> near the bottom of the cistern, <b>as well, won’t the water</b> of the two courtyards <b>become intermingled</b> above it?",
            "Abaye <b>said to him: Didn’t you hear that which Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said, and some arrived at</b> this statement <b>in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya: The tops of the reeds</b> of the partition <b>must be visible a handbreadth above</b> the surface of <b>the water?</b> This will ensure that there is a full partition between the two sides of the cistern.",
            "<b>And</b> Rabba bar Rav Ḥanan <b>further</b> asked: With regard to <b>that</b> which <b>Rav Yehuda said: Above</b> means <b>above the water,</b> we can inquire: <b>What is different</b> about a case where the partition is <b>actually above,</b> i.e., near the rim of the cistern that led Rav Yehuda to say that one may <b>not</b> draw water in that case? It is <b>because</b> he was concerned lest <b>the water</b> of the two courtyards <b>become intermingled</b> beneath the partition. However, even if the partition is <b>above the water</b> below the rim of the cistern, <b>the water</b> of the two courtyards will <b>also become intermingled</b> beneath it. Abaye <b>said to him: Haven’t you heard that which Ya’akov from Karḥina taught: The ends of the reeds</b> of a partition <b>must be immersed</b> at least <b>a handbreadth</b> into the <b>water,</b> so that they divide the water in the cistern?",
            "<b>But</b> the Gemara raises a further question. <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> If there is a cross <b>beam of four</b> handbreadths, it <b>permits</b> one to carry underneath it <b>in a ruin.</b> If a crossbeam four handbreadths wide is laid across the walls of a ruin, its edges are viewed as though they descended to the ground on each side, thereby forming partitions that permit one to carry under the cross beam. <b>And Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said:</b>"
        ],
        [
            "A cross <b>beam of four</b> handbreadths laid across a cistern located between two courtyards <b>permits</b> one to draw <b>water</b> from that cistern.",
            "With this in mind, the following difficulty arises: The <b>bucket</b> he uses to draw the water <b>might drift</b> under the cross <b>beam to the other side</b> of the cistern <b>and bring</b> water from the other courtyard. The Gemara answers: <b>The Sages have established that a bucket does not drift more than four handbreadths</b> from the point where it was lowered, and it will therefore stay on its original side of the partition.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Nonetheless, the water becomes intermingled under the</b> cross <b>beam,</b> and consequently the bucket will bring up water from the other courtyard. <b>Rather,</b> it must be that the reason for the leniency is not that the cross beam actually prevents the flow of the water, but <b>because the Sages were lenient with regard to water.</b> They allowed a partition suspended above the water to be considered as though it blocked the flow of the water. <b>As Rav Tavla asked of Rav:</b> With regard to <b>a suspended partition, does it permit</b> carrying <b>in a ruin?</b> Do we say that the remnants of the walls suspended in the air are considered as though they descended to the ground and closed off the area, thereby rendering it a private domain? Rav <b>said to him: A suspended partition</b> of this kind <b>permits</b> carrying <b>only</b> in the case <b>of water,</b> as <b>the Sages were lenient with regard to water.</b>",
            "The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> There is no need for a partition in the cistern, as <b>a partition</b> inside a cistern <b>is no</b> better than the wall above it. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Rabbi Yehuda stated this in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, who said: A suspended partition permits</b> carrying <b>even on land,</b> as it is considered as though it descended to the ground and sealed off the area. Accordingly, there is no need to erect a partition inside the airspace of a cistern.",
            "<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>One who lowers</b> <i>sukka</i> <b>walls from above</b> going <b>downward, when</b> the walls <b>are three handbreadths higher than the ground,</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>is invalid,</b> as they are not considered partitions; but if he constructed walls <b>from below</b> going <b>upward, if they are ten handbreadths high</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>is valid,</b> even if they do not reach the roofing.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> however, <b>says: Just as</b> with regard to walls constructed <b>from below</b> going <b>upward, ten</b> handbreadths suffice, <b>so</b> too, in the case of walls built <b>from above</b> going <b>downward, ten</b> handbreadths are enough for it to be considered a whole wall, even if it more than three handbreadths above the ground. Similarly, Rabbi Yehuda maintains that a partition suspended above a cistern is considered as though it descended and sealed off the area.",
            "The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>But this is not so,</b> for we can distinguish between the two opinions and claim that <b>neither Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> in accordance <b>with Rabbi Yosei, nor does Rabbi Yosei hold</b> in accordance <b>with Rabbi Yehuda.</b>",
            "The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rabbi Yehuda does not</b> necessarily <b>hold</b> in accordance <b>with Rabbi Yosei,</b> as a distinction can be made between the two cases. <b>Rabbi Yehuda stated</b> his opinion <b>only with regard to the joining of courtyards,</b> which are required <b>by rabbinic law, but</b> in the case of <b>a <i>sukka</i>, which</b> is required <b>by Torah law, no,</b> he did not say that we can rely on suspended partitions.",
            "<b>And</b> conversely, <b>Rabbi Yosei does not</b> necessarily <b>hold</b> in accordance <b>with Rabbi Yehuda,</b> as <b>Rabbi Yosei stated</b> his opinion <b>only with regard to a <i>sukka</i>,</b> which <b>is a prohibition</b> stated in the Torah <b>from a positive commandment.</b> The prohibition is not written as a negative commandment, but it can be inferred from a positive commandment. Neglect of the positive commandment of <i>sukka</i> is not punishable by the court, therefore we are not stringent in this regard. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>Shabbat,</b> which is <b>a prohibition</b> punishable <b>by stoning,</b> Rabbi Yosei <b>did not state</b> his opinion. Consequently, Rabbi Yosei might agree that we must be very stringent with regard to all <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat, even those that are rabbinic in origin.",
            "<b>And if you ask: That incident, which occurred in Tzippori,</b> when they relied on suspended partitions on land for Shabbat, <b>on whose authority was it performed?</b> It was done <b>not on the authority of Rabbi Yosei, but</b> rather <b>it was performed on the authority of Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei,</b> who maintains that a suspended partition renders it permitted to carry even if it is over land and even on Shabbat.",
            "The incident transpired in the following manner. <b>As when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said:</b> It <b>once</b> happened that the people <b>forgot and did not bring a Torah scroll</b> to the synagogue on Friday <b>while it was still day,</b> which meant they were left without a scroll from which to read on Shabbat. <b>On the following day,</b> Shabbat, <b>they spread a sheet over the pillars</b> positioned between the house where the scroll was kept and the synagogue, thereby forming a corridor with partitions suspended on each side. <b>And</b> in this manner <b>they brought the Torah scroll</b> to the synagogue <b>and read from it.</b>",
            "The Gemara expresses surprise at the wording of this account: Did they actually <b>spread</b> sheets on Shabbat? <b>Is it permitted</b> to do so <b><i>ab initio</i>? But doesn’t everyone agree that one may not erect a temporary tent on Shabbat</b> <i>ab initio</i>? Spreading sheets over pillars is considered constructing a temporary tent.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> what happened was that <b>they found sheets spread over the pillars,</b> which they used as partitions, <b>and</b> in this manner <b>they brought the Torah scroll</b> to the synagogue <b>and read from it.</b>",
            "<b>Rabba said: Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya said the same thing.</b> Both were very lenient with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of a partition over water. The ruling of <b>Rabbi Yehuda is that which we</b> just <b>said,</b> that the wall of the courtyard permits a cistern. The ruling of <b>Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya is as we learned: Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya says:</b> In the case of <b>a balcony that contains four cubits by four cubits,</b> which is suspended over water,"

Consequently, it is permitted to draw water through the hole.",
            "<b>Abaye said to him: But perhaps that is not so,</b> as we can distinguish between the opinions. It is possible that <b>Rabbi Yehuda stated</b> his opinion <b>only there,</b> with regard to the wall of the courtyard and the cistern, <b>as he said</b> that we rely on the halakhic principle of <b>extend and lower the partition.</b> The partition above the cistern is considered as though it descended to the bottom. <b>But</b> the principle of <b>bend</b> the partition <b>and extend</b> it downward, as suggested by Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya, <b>no,</b> he does not accept this principle.",
            "<b>And</b> we can likewise say that <b>Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya stated</b> his opinion <b>only there,</b> in the case of the balcony, <b>with regard to the Sea of Tiberias,</b> i.e., the Sea of Galilee, <b>since it has</b> clearly defined <b>banks</b> around it, <b>and towns and enclosures surround it</b> on all sides. The Sea of Galilee is surrounded by clear boundaries on all sides and is therefore somewhat similar to a private domain in appearance. Consequently, even a minor adjustment is sufficient. <b>However, with regard to other waters, no,</b> Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya did not permit this practice.",
            "<b>Abaye said: And according to the statement of Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya,</b> if the balcony <b>was less than three handbreadths</b> away <b>from the wall,</b> it is permitted to draw water from it in the following circumstances: <b>Its length must be four cubits, and its width</b> must be <b>eleven</b> handbreadths <b>and</b> any <b>amount.</b> By carving out a hole of slightly more than one handbreadth by four handbreadths on the side near the wall, alongside the other three handbreadths, one creates a hole of four handbreadths by four handbreadths. This hole is surrounded by partitions ten handbreadths high on each side. How so? The wall itself is one partition. The four-cubit length is viewed as bent down on both sides of the hole, forming two partitions of ten handbreadths; the remaining ten handbreadths of the width is seen as though it were bent down, which creates a partition on the fourth side of the balcony.",
            "If the balcony <b>was upright,</b> i.e., it had upright partitions on all sides (Rabbeinu Ḥananel), <b>the height</b> of these partitions <b>must be ten handbreadths, and the width</b> of the balcony must be <b>six handbreadths and two</b> minimal <b>amounts.</b> This leaves slightly more than a handbreadth on each side of the hole of four handbreadths, on which he can stand.",

            "With regard to these measures of three and four handbreadths, the Gemara asks: <b>With what are we dealing</b> here? <b>If you say</b> this <i>halakha</i> is referring <b>to the water channel itself,</b> that it was three or four handbreadths wide, this presents a difficulty, <b>for when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A <i>karmelit</i> cannot be less than four</b> handbreadths wide. The <i>karmelit</i> is an intermediate domain established by the Sages, whose status is between a public and a private domain. Any open area that is not a public thoroughfare, e.g., a field, sea, river, alleyway, or a lane, is classified as a <i>karmelit</i>. It is prohibited to carry an article four cubits within a <i>karmelit</i>, or to transfer an object from a private domain or a public domain to a <i>karmelit</i>, or vice versa. One who draws water through a window from a water channel into a house has carried from a <i>karmelit</i> to a private domain. Consequently, if the <i>tanna’im</i> of the <i>baraita</i> dispute the width of the channel, they are in effect disagreeing about the minimal size of a <i>karmelit</i>.",
            "The Gemara resumes its question: <b>Let us say,</b> then, that <b>the teaching that</b> Rav Dimi <b>cited,</b> that a <i>karmelit</i> cannot be less than four handbreadths wide, was actually the subject of a dispute of <b><i>tanna’im</i></b> and not a unanimous <i>halakha</i>.",
            "The Gemara rejects the previous explanation. <b>Rather,</b> the measure of three or four handbreadths is referring not to the channel itself but <b>to the banks</b> of the channel, <b>and</b> it is stated <b>with regard to</b> an act of <b>exchange.</b> The dispute here does not concern the measure of a <i>karmelit</i>, but the measure of an exempt domain. It is permitted to transfer the empty bucket from the window, which is a private domain, by way of the channel’s banks, which are exempt domains, to the water channel, which is a <i>karmelit</i>, and back again with the full bucket.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A place that does not have</b> an area of <b>four by four</b> handbreadths is an <b>exempt domain.</b> Consequently, if this place is situated between a public domain and a private domain, <b>it is permitted for</b> both <b>the people of the private domain and for the people of the public domain to</b> adjust the burdens on their <b>shoulders on it, provided</b> that <b>they do not exchange</b> objects between them via the exempt domain.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> Rav Dimi is referring to <b>domains by Torah law,</b> i.e., this <i>halakha</i> involves the transfer of objects from a private domain to a public domain via an exempt domain. The Sages forbade this activity, so that people would not transfer objects directly from the private domain to the public domain."

            "However, <b>here,</b> Rav Dimi is referring to <b>domains by rabbinic law.</b> As the transfer of objects from a private domain to a <i>karmelit</i> is prohibited only by rabbinic decree, the Sages did not prohibit this transfer when it is accomplished by way of an exempt domain.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that transferring objects from one domain to another by way of an exempt domain is prohibited <b>even in</b> the case of <b>domains</b> that apply <b>by rabbinic law.

            "If <b>the wall is breached,</b> a distinction applies: If the breach is <b>up to ten cubits</b> wide, <b>they may establish two <i>eiruvin</i>, and if they wish, they may establish one <i>eiruv</i>, for it is like an entrance.</b> This breach is similar to any opening of less than ten cubits. If the breach is <b>more than this, they may establish one <i>eiruv</i>, but they may not establish two <i>eiruvin</i>.</b> A breach of this size nullifies the partition, as the two courtyards merge into a single domain.",
            "<b>And we discussed this</b> mishna and raised a question: If this wall <b>is not four</b> handbreadths thick, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav said:</b> In that case, <b>the air of two domains controls it.</b> As the wall is not broad enough to be considered a domain of its own, its top belongs to both courtyards, and it is therefore prohibited to both of them. Accordingly, <b>one may not move</b> anything <b>on</b> top of the wall even as much as <b>a hairsbreadth.</b>",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> disagreed and <b>said: These,</b> the residents of one courtyard, <b>may carry up</b> their food <b>from</b> their courtyard to the top of the wall <b>and eat</b> it there, <b>and those,</b> the residents of the other courtyard, <b>may</b> likewise <b>carry up</b> their food <b>from</b> their courtyard <b>and eat</b> it there.

            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>And let</b> the water channel that passes through the courtyard <b>be</b> treated at least <b>like the cavities of a <i>karmelit</i>,</b> even if it is not wide enough to be considered a <i>karmelit</i> on its own. Just as the cavities in the wall of a private domain are considered a private domain even if they do not include the prescribed measure of a private domain, the water channel passing through the courtyard should likewise be considered as a cavity of the larger water channel in the street. It should therefore have the status of a <i>karmelit</i>.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Abaye bar Avin and Rav Ḥanina bar Avin both said: There is no</b> category of <b>cavities for a <i>karmelit</i>.</b> As a <i>karmelit</i> is only a rabbinic in origin, the <i>halakha</i> is not so stringent with regard to this domain.

            "<b>And the Rabbis follow their</b> regular line of <b>argument,</b> that the principle of <i>lavud</i> applies only to a gap less than three handbreadths wide.

            "The Gemara clarifies this <i>baraita</i>: <b>They may draw water through</b> a hole cut out of <b>a balcony on Shabbat</b> is the <i>halakha</i> <b>that we stated</b> above. <b>And they may insulate</b> produce <b>in the pods</b> of legumes; <b>what is</b> this <i>halakha</i>? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>rose early</b> in the morning <b>to bring residue</b> from the field, e.g., the straw of wheat or the stalks or pods of legumes, in order to store his produce in them, the following distinction applies: <b>If</b> he rose early <b>because</b> the residue still <b>has dew on it,</b> and he wants to use this moisture for his produce, <b>this</b> instance <b>is considered</b> to be in the following category: <b>If</b> any water <b>be put.</b> Food or produce can contract ritual impurity only if it has come into contact with a liquid, either directly through the action of its owner, or without his direct intervention but with his approval. This is derived from the verse: “But if any water be put on the seed, and any part of their carcass falls on it, it shall be unclean to you” (Leviticus 11:38). Returning to our issue, if this person rose early because the residue still has dew on it, the produce he stores in it is rendered susceptible to ritual impurity, as it has come into contact with the dew with its owner’s approval.",

            "The Gemara turns to the third activity that Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya permitted for the inhabitants of Tiberias: <b>And they may dry themselves with a towel.

            "<b>And Rav</b> follows <b>his</b> regular line of <b>argument</b> here, <b>as Rav said: One person does not impose restrictions upon another person by way of the air.</b> Since the lower balcony is far from the higher one, it does not prohibit it, although it can make use of it by means of the vacant airspace between them, albeit with difficulty.",
            "<b>Rabba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya said, and Rav Yosef said</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> of <b>stealing applies to Shabbat</b> domains, <b>and a ruin must be returned to its owner.</b>",

If this person uses the ruin during the week, on Shabbat he may treat it as though it were his own, by carrying objects from his own house into the ruin and vice versa. <b>From here</b> we can infer that a stolen place <b>is acquired</b> for the purpose of Shabbat domains, although it does not belong to the person for other purposes. However, you subsequently said that <b>a ruin must be returned to its owner,</b> and <b>from here</b> we can infer that a ruin <b>is not acquired</b> for the purpose of Shabbat domains by the person who used it during the week, and therefore he may not carry objects from his own house into the ruin.",
            "The Gemara answers: We should not understand this statement as suggested above, but rather <b>this is</b> what Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Oshaya <b>are saying: The <i>halakha</i> of</b> returning <b>stolen</b> property <b>applies to Shabbat</b> domains. <b>How so?</b> This means <b>that a ruin must be returned to its owner.</b> In other words, one who uses a ruin during the week does not acquire it even for the purpose of Shabbat domains.",

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Since they erected</b> a separate partition <b>for the lower</b> balcony, <b>they</b> each thereby <b>revealed their intention</b> to the residents of the upper balcony <b>that: It is not my wish to be</b> partners <b>with you.</b> Consequently, they no longer prohibit the residents of the upper balcony from using it.",

            "The Gemara is surprised by this explanation: <b>And now that it is fit for residence, what dilemma is he raising?</b> The situation is comparable to the case of two standard roofs. The Gemara answers: Rav Beivai was unaware of the resolution to the dilemma raised by Rami bar Ḥama, and therefore, <b>he states</b> the dilemma employing the style: <b>If you say. If you say</b> that <b>a portico is not fit for residence,</b> and therefore carrying is permitted, it can be argued that as <b>a ruin is fit for residence,</b> the legal status of its roof should be like that of a standard roof. <b>Or perhaps</b> that is not the case, as <b>now in any event there are no residents in</b> the ruin, and therefore its roof is not comparable to a standard roof. No resolution was found for these dilemmas, and they <b>stand</b> unresolved.",

This is <b>difficult,</b> as there is an apparent contradiction between one statement <b>of Rav and</b> another statement <b>of Rav.</b> With regard to level roofs, Rav said that according to the Rabbis one may carry on each roof only within four cubits. The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of a roof among roofs, <b>the</b> inner <b>partitions</b> between the houses <b>are not conspicuous,</b> and therefore, are not taken into consideration. <b>Here,</b> however, <b>the</b> outer <b>partitions</b> of a single house or group of houses <b>are conspicuous,</b> meaning that they are considered to extend upward and delineate the edge of the roof.",
            "The Gemara returns to discuss Shmuel’s ruling. <b>And Shmuel said: One may carry only within four</b> cubits. Once again, it is <b>difficult,</b> as there is an apparent contradiction between one statement <b>of Shmuel and</b> another statement <b>of Shmuel,</b> who said that in the case of level roofs, according to the Rabbis one may carry throughout each separate roof. The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> the area of the roof <b>is no greater than two <i>beit se’a</i>;</b> whereas <b>here,</b> the area <b>is greater than two <i>beit se’a</i>.

            "<b>Rav Ashi teaches</b> Shmuel’s acceptance of Rav’s opposing view (Ritva) with regard <b>to a ship,</b> as stated above; <b>and Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, teaches it</b> with regard <b>to a portico, as it was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> disagreed with regard to <b>a portico</b> located <b>in a field.</b> A portico has a roof and either incomplete walls or no walls.

The Gemara answers: It is prohibited because Rabbi Meir issued <b>a decree, due to</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi.</b> As stated previously, Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi rules that one may not transfer objects between two halakhically equivalent but physically distinct domains ten or more handbreadths high.

            "<b>And similarly,</b> with regard to <b>one’s son</b> who was born in a field and may not be carried on Shabbat, since that is akin to carrying a burden in the public domain: <b>One gives him to another, and the other</b> passes him <b>to another, even</b> if it requires <b>a hundred</b> people. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: A person</b> may even <b>give a barrel to another, and the other</b> may pass it <b>to another,</b> and in that way <b>even</b> take it <b>beyond the</b> Shabbat <b>limit,</b> provided that no one person carries it more than four cubits. <b>They said to him: This</b> barrel may <b>not go a greater</b> distance <b>than the feet of its owner,</b> i.e., it may not be carried any farther than its owner may walk.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> We learned in the mishna that a person who finds phylacteries in a field may carry them by pairs, indicating that <b>one pair, yes,</b> it may be carried; however, <b>more</b> than one pair, <b>no,</b> they may not be carried.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And from where</b> do we know that <b>this unattributed</b> mishna with regard to Shabbat <b>is</b> a reflection of the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir?

            "In answer to the question, <b>Rava said: Even if you say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> there is a distinction between the cases. <b>There,</b> if he dons the clothes in <b>the manner that he</b> typically <b>wears them, the Sages rendered</b> the legal status of wearing garments on Shabbat <b>like</b> the status of wearing garments during the <b>week</b> and permitted him to remove clothes from his house by wearing them in that manner. <b>And here,</b> too, if he dons phylacteries in <b>the manner that he</b> typically <b>dons them, the Sages rendered</b> the legal status of donning phylacteries on Shabbat <b>like</b> the status of donning phylacteries during the <b>week.</b>",

            "The Gemara answers that even when one dons two phylacteries on his arm, he is regarded as donning them in the typical manner, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna.

Yet the Sages instituted that outside of Eretz Yisrael, Jews must observe <i>Sukkot</i> for eight days, even though one who sleeps in a <i>sukka</i> on the eighth night outside of Eretz Yisrael transgresses a Torah law. <b>Rather, it is clear as we originally answered,</b> i.e., you must accept one of the other explanations.",
            "Since the topic of phylacteries was discussed, the Gemara continues to explore this issue. <b>Whom did you hear</b> who said that <b>Shabbat is</b> a fit <b>time for</b> donning <b>phylacteries?</b> It is <b>Rabbi Akiva, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the end of the section in the Torah beginning with: “Sanctify all firstborns to me” (Exodus 13:2), which deals with the mitzvot of the Paschal lamb and phylacteries: <b>“And you shall observe this ordinance in its season from year [<i>miyamim</i>] to year”</b> (Exodus 13:10), which indicates that these mitzvot apply during the <b>days</b> [<b><i>yamim</i></b>] <b>and not</b> during the <b>nights.</b> Furthermore, the letter <i>mem</i> in <b>“from year” [<i>miyamim</i>]</b> teaches: <b>But not</b> on <b>all days;</b> this <b>excludes Shabbat and Festivals,</b> on which phylacteries are not worn. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Akiva says: This ordinance is stated only with regard to the Paschal</b> lamb, and it does not refer to phylacteries at all. According to Rabbi Akiva, there is no reason to refrain from donning phylacteries on Shabbat and Festivals.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>that</b> which <b>we learned</b> in a mishna that <b>the Paschal</b> lamb <b>and circumcision are positive mitzvot, let us say that</b> this statement is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b> The reason for this claim is <b>that if</b> you say this teaching is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, since he establishes</b> this verse as referring <b>to the Paschal</b> lamb, this would mean that in failure to bring this offering there <b>is also</b> the violation of <b>a negative</b> mitzva, <b>in accordance with</b> the principle <b>that Rabbi Avin</b> said that <b>Rabbi Elai said.

            "The Gemara rejects this: <b>Even if you say</b> that <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> holds that no negative mitzva applies to the Paschal lamb, it is not difficult, as an additional principle must be taken into account. Although it is true that the term <b>observe with regard to a negative</b> mitzva indicates the presence of another <b>negative</b> mitzva; that same term <b>observe</b> with regard to <b>a positive</b> mitzva has the force of <b>a positive</b> mitzva, as the Torah is warning adherents to take special care in the observance of a mitzva. The word observe in connection with the Paschal lamb is an example of this type of positive mitzva.",
            "The Gemara returns to the issue at hand: <b>And</b> does <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> really <b>hold that Shabbat is a time for</b> donning <b>phylacteries?

The obligation to don phylacteries applies when Jews <b>require a sign</b> to assert their Judaism and their status as the Chosen People, i.e., during the week, <b>excluding</b> Shabbat and Festivals, <b>as they are themselves signs</b> of Israel’s status as the Chosen People and a remembrance of the exodus from Egypt. Consequently, no further sign is required on these days. This teaching proves that Rabbi Akiva maintains that Shabbat is not a fit time for donning phylacteries.",
            "<b>Rather, it is this <i>tanna</i>,</b> Rabbi Natan, who maintains that Shabbat is a fit time for donning phylacteries, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who is awake at night, if he wishes he</b> may <b>remove</b> his phylacteries, and <b>if he wishes he</b> may continue to <b>don</b> them, and he need not worry about violating the prohibition against adding to mitzvot.

            "<b><i>Shin</i>, <i>yod</i>, <i>tzadi</i>, <i>yod</i>, <i>ayin</i>, <i>tzadi</i>, <i>beit</i>, <i>yod</i></b> is a <b>mnemonic</b> for the statements that follow. The Gemara adds: <b>And now that the father of Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak has taught</b> that <b>these are</b> deemed <b>old</b> phylacteries: <b>Any that have straps that</b> are permanently <b>tied</b> in the manner of phylacteries, and <b>new</b> phylacteries are those <b>that have straps that are not tied,</b> the conclusion is <b>that everyone agrees</b> that <b>a person does not exert</b> himself to fashion an amulet similar to phylacteries or string-like ritual fringes. They disagree with regard to new phylacteries that are not tied properly and cannot be donned in a manner typical of a weekday. The reason is that tying a permanent knot on Shabbat is prohibited by Torah law. Therefore, these phylacteries may not be donned, and Rabbi Zeira’s opinion is accepted.",
            "The Gemara asks a question with regard to Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion that new phylacteries may not be brought into town because they lack a permanent knot: Why must one tie the phylacteries with a knot? <b>Let him</b> simply <b>tie a bow,</b> which is not prohibited on Shabbat, and place the phylacteries on his head and arm in that manner. <b>Rav Ḥisda said: That is to say</b> that <b>a bow is invalid for phylacteries,</b> as a proper knot is required.",
            "<b>Abaye said:</b> This is not the correct interpretation. Rather, <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> conforms to <b>his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he said: A bow is a full-fledged knot,</b> and it is prohibited to tie it on Shabbat by Torah law.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>The reason</b> that it is prohibited to tie a bow is <b>that a bow is a full-fledged knot.</b> If <b>that were not so,</b> one could <b>tie</b> the phylacteries <b>with a bow. But didn’t Rav Yehuda, son of Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat, say in the name of Rav:</b> The form of the permanent <b>knot of phylacteries is a <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai; and Rav Naḥman said: And their decorative</b> side, the side of the knot where the shape of the letter appears, must face <b>outward.</b> Apparently, a bow does not suffice for phylacteries, as an actual knot is required.",
            "The Gemara rejects this contention: It is referring to a case <b>where one tied a bow similar</b> in form <b>to a</b> permanent <b>knot,</b> without actually tying a permanent knot.",
            "<b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>Rav said: One who purchases</b> a large quantity of <b>phylacteries from one who is not an expert,</b> i.e., a person who has not proven to be a reliable manufacturer of phylacteries, the purchaser <b>examines two</b> phylacteries <b>of the arm and one of the head, or two of the head and one of the arm,</b> to see if they are valid and the individual reliable. If the three phylacteries are found to be valid upon examination, the seller is considered an expert and the rest of the phylacteries are presumed valid as well.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Whichever way you look at it,</b> this ruling is problematic: <b>If</b> the buyer <b>purchased</b> all of the phylacteries <b>from one person,</b> who acquired them from somebody else, <b>let him examine three</b> phylacteries <b>of the arm or three of the head,</b> in accordance with the principle that presumptive status is established after three instances.",
            "<b>If he purchased</b> the phylacteries <b>from two</b> or <b>three people, each and every one</b> of the phylacteries <b>should require examination.</b> The presumptive status of one pair of phylacteries does not apply to the others, as they might have been produced by a different person. The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> this refers to a case where the buyer <b>bought</b> the phylacteries <b>from one person, and we require</b> that the seller prove himself <b>to be an expert with regard to</b> both the phylactery <b>of the arm and</b> the phylactery <b>of the head.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rabba bar Shmuel teach</b> that <b>with</b> regard to <b>phylacteries one examines three of the arm and</b> three <b>of the head? What, is it not</b> that he examines <b>either three</b> phylacteries <b>of the arm or three of the head?</b> The Gemara rejects this explanation: <b>No,</b> it means that he examines <b>three</b> phylacteries in total, <b>among them</b> phylacteries <b>of the arm and among them</b> phylacteries <b>of the head,</b> as stated by Rav Ḥisda in the name of Rav.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rav Kahana teach</b> that <b>with</b> regard to <b>phylacteries one examines two of the arm and</b> two <b>of the head?</b> This statement certainly contradicts Rav’s opinion. The Gemara explains: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>halakha</i>? <b>It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who said: Presumptive status is</b> established <b>by two times.</b> Although most Sages maintain that it takes three instances to establish a presumptive status, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi rules that two cases suffice. Consequently, in the case of phylacteries, it is sufficient to examine two.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> this ruling is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>say the latter clause</b> of that same <i>baraita</i> as follows: <b>And</b> he must <b>likewise</b> examine <b>the second bundle</b> of phylacteries, <b>and likewise the third bundle. And if it is</b> in accordance with <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion, <b>is he of</b> the opinion that <b>a third</b> examination is necessary? Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi does not require a third examination to establish a presumptive status, as he maintains that the examination of two bundles suffices.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>concedes with regard to bundles, as one buys</b> them <b>from two</b> or <b>three</b> different <b>people.</b> It can be assumed that the various bundles of phylacteries were not all manufactured by the same person. Consequently, the validity of one bundle does not establish a presumption with regard to another. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, even</b> the <b>fourth</b> bundle must be examined <b>as well, and even</b> the <b>fifth as well.</b> If the bundles were bought from different manufacturers, every one of them requires examination, not only the third.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is indeed so;</b> this is how one must proceed. <b>And</b> the reason <b>that</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>teaches three</b> bundles rather than four or five is <b>to exclude</b> the third bundle <b>from its presumptive status.</b> By stating that the third bundle must be examined, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi indicates that in this case two examinations do not establish a presumption; rather, all of the bundles must be checked. <b>And actually, even</b> the <b>fourth and fifth</b> bundles require examination <b>as well.</b>",
            "It was stated in the mishna that if <b>one finds</b> phylacteries <b>tied in bundles or in wrapped piles,</b> he sits there and waits with them until dark and then brings them in. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>bundles</b> in this context, <b>and what is</b> meant by <b>wrapped piles?

            "<b>And what,</b> then, is the meaning of the Rabbis’ statement in the mishna: <b>This</b> may <b>not go</b> farther than the feet of the owners may go, which apparently refers to the barrel?

            "The Gemara rejects this explanation. <b>Say that you heard Rabbi Yehuda</b> express <b>his</b> opinion that water has no substance in a case <b>where it is absorbed in dough;</b> but in a case <b>where it is in its pure, unadulterated</b> state <b>did you hear him</b> say so? <b>Now,</b> if with regard to water <b>in a pot</b> of cooked food <b>Rabbi Yehuda said</b> that it <b>is not nullified,</b> would it be <b>nullified when it is in its pure, unadulterated</b> state?

            "<b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that there is a distinction between the cases: If <b>he turned</b> the spittle <b>over</b> in his mouth, it is like spittle that has been detached from its place, and therefore its legal status is that of a liquid, which means the fig is <b>impure.</b> However, if <b>he</b> had <b>not</b> yet <b>turned</b> the spittle <b>over</b> in his mouth, the fig is <b>pure.</b> This indicates that according to Rabbi Yehuda, spittle that has not yet been turned over in one’s mouth is not considered detached.",

However, if the cistern’s embankment is ten handbreadths high, the one drawing the water transfers it by way of an area that is more than ten handbreadths above the public domain, which is an exempt domain.",
            "<b>And the reason</b> that drawing the water is permitted is <b>that there is an embankment of ten</b> handbreadths; but <b>if there is no embankment of ten</b> handbreadths, it is prohibited, as this would involve <b>moving</b> objects <b>from one private domain to another by way of the public domain.</b>",

            "<b>And the other</b> Sage, how does he counter this reasoning?

            "<b>And the other</b> Sage maintains that these cases also involve Torah prohibitions. How so?

If we do not accept this opinion, one who carries the Paschal lamb transgresses the Torah prohibition against carrying an object four cubits in the public domain.

            "<b>Rav Yosef raised an objection</b> against this explanation from a mishna. <b>Rabbi Eliezer said</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is <b>an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: If slaughtering</b> the Paschal lamb, <b>which is</b> prohibited <b>due to</b> the fact that it is <b>a prohibited labor</b> by Torah law, nonetheless <b>overrides Shabbat</b> in the Temple, with regard to <b>these</b> actions, i.e., carrying the animal, bringing it from outside the Shabbat boundary, and cutting off its wart, which are prohibited <b>due to rabbinic decree, isn’t it right that they</b> should <b>override Shabbat?</b> Evidently, the previous explanation must be rejected, as there too the mishna is referring to rabbinic prohibitions.",
            "<b>Rather, Rav Yosef said: Both</b> sources are referring to a case where the wart is removed <b>by hand,</b> an activity that constitutes a rabbinic prohibition, <b>and</b> the contradiction can be resolved as follows: To transgress <b>a rabbinic decree</b> relating to <b>the Temple within</b> the confines of <b>the Temple</b> itself, <b>they permitted</b> doing so. However, to transgress <b>a rabbinic decree</b> relating <b>to the Temple, in the country, they did not permit</b> doing so.
