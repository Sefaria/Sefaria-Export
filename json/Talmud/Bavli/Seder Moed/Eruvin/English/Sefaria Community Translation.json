            "R' Acha bar Chanina said, It is revealed and known before the One Who said and the world came into being that nobody in the generation of R' Meir was like him, and it was only because his contemporaries couldn't stand on the end of his knowledge that we don't pasken like him. For he might say on something that is impure that it is pure and faces were turned on him, and [he might say on] something that is pure that it is impure and faces were turned on him", 
            "It was taught: R' Meir's name wasn't that; it was R' Nehorai. So why was he called R' Meir? It was because he enlightened [me'ir] the eyes of the other Sages in law. And Nehorai wasn't his name, either; it was R' Nechemia. And others say that his name was R' Elazar ben Erech. So why was he called Nehorai? Because he clarified [manhir] the eyes of the other Sages in law.",

            "R' Avahu said in the name of R' Yochanan, There was a student of R' Meir's named Sumchos, and he would give 48 reasons for anything that he declared impure and 48 reasons for anything that he declared pure.",

            "Rabbi Abba said in the name of Shmuel, For three years, the House of Hillel and the House of Shammai argued. One said, 'The halakha is like us,' and the other said, 'The halakha is like us.' A heavenly voice spoke: \"These and these are the words of the living God, and the halakha is like the House of Hillel.\"", 
            "A question was raised: Since the heavenly voice declared: \"Both these and those are the words of the Living God,\" why was the halacha established to follow the opinion of Hillel? It is because the students of Hillel were kind and gracious. They taught their own ideas as well as the ideas from the students of Shammai. Not only for this reason, but they went so far as to teach Shammai's opinions first.", 
            "Like that which we taught, One whose head and majority of his body are in the Sukkah and his table are in the [adjacent] house, Beis Shamai said it is invalid, and Beis Hillel said it is valid. Beis Hillel said to Beis Shamai, Is there not a story in our hands that the elders of Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel went to visit R' Yochanan ben HaChornis, and they found him sitting with his head and majority of his body in the Sukkah and his table in the house? [Doesn't this imply it's permissible?] Beis Shamai said back to them, From there you bring a proof? Even they said to him that if this is how you act, you never fulfilled the mitzvah of Sukkah in your life!", 
            "[This story is] to teach you that whoever degrades himself, Hashem raises him, and whoever raises himself, Hashem degrades him. Whoever runs toward greatness, greatness flees from him, and whoever flees from greatness, greatness runs toward him. Whoever uses his time wisely, the time stretches out, and whoever procrastinates, the time stands still.", 
            "It was taught in a Braisa: For two-and-a-half years the house of Shammai and the house of Hillel argued. These said: Better for man never to have been created than to have been created. And these said: Better for man to have been created that not to have been created. They counted and decided: Better for man never to have been created than to have been created. Now that he has been created, he should sift through his actions. And there are those who say he should examine his actions.",

[If the eruv was deposited] within three [handbreadths from the ground] it is permitted to move it.

They then distanced themselves and Elazar sat to the right of Moses and Itamar to the left of Aaron. Rabbi Yehuda said, Aaron was always on the right of Moses. Returning, the elders entered and Moses taught them their portion. The elders distanced themselves and the entire nation entered and Moses taught them their portion. The result was that Aaron heard the teaching four times, his sons, three times, the elders, twice, and the entire nation, once. Moses then distanced himself and Aaron repeated his portion. His sons then repeated their portion and left. The elders then repeated their portion and left. In this way, everyone heard everything four times. Based on this method, Rabbi Eliezer said, everyone is obligated to repeat his teachings to his disciples four times.
