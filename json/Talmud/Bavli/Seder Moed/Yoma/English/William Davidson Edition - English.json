            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Seven days prior to Yom Kippur</b> the Sages would <b>remove the High Priest,</b> who performs the entire Yom Kippur service, <b>from his house to the Chamber of <i>Parhedrin</i>,</b> a room in the Temple designated specifically for the High Priest during that period. <b>And they would designate another priest in his stead</b> to replace him <b>lest a disqualification</b> due to impurity or another circumstance beyond his control prevent him from entering the Temple on Yom Kippur.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The Sages would <b>even designate another wife for him lest his wife die, as it is stated</b> in the Torah portion of the Yom Kippur service: <b>“And it will atone for him and for his house”</b> (Leviticus 16:6); the Sages interpreted the term: <b>His house, that is his wife.</b> The priest must be married in order to fulfill this commandment. Due to the concern lest his wife die, another wife was designated to address that possibility. <b>The Rabbis said</b> to Rabbi Yehuda: <b>If so,</b> that this is a concern, <b>there is no end to the matter,</b> as what if the designated replacement wife dies? This possibility need not be a source of concern.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The <i>halakha</i> of sequestering the High Priest prior to his performance of the Temple service on Yom Kippur is comparable to the sequestering of the priest designated to burn the red heifer. Therefore, the Gemara cites that which <b>we learned</b> in a mishna <b>there,</b> in tractate <i>Para</i>: <b>Seven days prior to the burning of the</b> red <b>heifer,</b> the Sages <b>would remove the priest who burns the heifer from his house to the chamber that was before the <i>bira</i></b> at the <b>northeast</b> corner of the courtyard on the Temple Mount. And that chamber <b>was called the Chamber of the Stone House.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>And why was it called the Chamber of the Stone House?</b> It is <b>because all the actions</b> associated with the red heifer were performed <b>in dung vessels, stone vessels, and earth vessels,</b> which are vessels that cannot become ritually impure.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that they were so stringent with regard to the purity of the heifer? The Gemara explains: It is <b>since</b> a priest who <b>immersed that day is fit</b> for service and may perform the ritual of the <b>heifer</b> after immersion, even before sunset, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>They would</b> intentionally <b>render the priest who burns the heifer ritually impure and immerse him</b> immediately, <b>to remove</b> a misconception <b>from the hearts of the Sadducees</b> by means of a public display of disregard for their ruling. <b>As</b> the Sadducees <b>would say: Only</b> by <b>those for whom the sun set was</b> the heifer ritual <b>performed.</b> The Sadducees believed that it is prohibited for priests who began the purification process with immersion during that day to burn the red heifer until sunset, when the purification process is completed.",
            "That mishna continues: Since they would intentionally render the priest who burned the heifer ritually impure, <b>the Sages</b> in turn <b>instituted</b> the stringencies of utilizing <b>dung vessels, stone vessels, and earth vessels, which do not</b> have the capacity to <b>become ritually impure, lest people</b> come <b>to treat</b> the ritual <b>with contempt</b> and perform it in ritual impurity after seeing that the red heifer ritual was performed by one who immersed that day.",
            "Apropos the mishna in tractate <i>Para</i>, the Gemara asks: <b>What is different about</b> the chamber located in the <b>northeast</b> corner of the Temple courtyard that led the Sages to house the priest performing the red heifer ritual specifically in that chamber? The Gemara answers: It is different <b>since it is a sin-offering,</b> as the red heifer is referred to as a sin-offering in the Torah, and the slaughter and sprinkling of the blood of <b>a sin-offering</b> must be performed <b>north</b> of the altar; <b>and</b> since <b>it is written with regard to</b> the red heifer: “And sprinkle it <b>before the opening of the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Numbers 19:4), and before the Tent of Meeting means on its eastern side. Therefore, <b>the</b> Sages <b>established a chamber in the northeast</b> so <b>that</b> the ritual of the red heifer <b>will have a distinctive indicator;</b> this will cause the administering priest to be vigilant in its performance.",
            "The Gemara asks with regard to the terminology of the mishna: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the term <b><i>bira</i></b> cited there? <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: There was a place on the Temple Mount and its name is <i>bira</i>,</b> and the Chamber of the Stone House was adjacent to it. <b>And Reish Lakish said: The entire Temple is called <i>bira</i>, as it is stated</b> in the prayer of David: “To Solomon my son grant a wholesome heart, to observe your commandments, your admonitions, and your statutes, to fulfill them all, and to build <b>the <i>bira</i> for which I have made provision”</b> (I Chronicles 29:19).",
            "§ With regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of sequestering the High Priest prior to performance of the Yom Kippur service, and of sequestering the priest designated to burn the heifer prior to performance of the red heifer ritual, the Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> in the Torah <b>are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Minyomi bar Ḥilkiya said</b> that <b>Rabbi Maḥseya bar Idi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> they are derived from Aaron and his sons, who remained in the Tabernacle for seven days prior to performing the service in the Tabernacle on the eighth day of their inauguration, <b>as the verse states: “As has been done this day, so the Lord has commanded to do, to make atonement for you”</b> (Leviticus 8:34), meaning that this mitzva of sequestering was not limited to the days prior to the dedication of the Tabernacle; rather, it applies to future generations as well. The verse is interpreted homiletically: <b>“To do”; these are the actions</b> performed in the burning of <b>the</b> red <b>heifer</b> for which the priest performing the ritual is sequestered seven days in advance; <b>“to make atonement”; these are the actions</b> performed on <b>Yom Kippur,</b> before which the High Priest is sequestered seven days.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, the entire verse is not established as referring</b> exclusively <b>to</b> the red <b>heifer,</b> as: <b>“To atone,” is written, and the heifer is not capable of</b> facilitating <b>atonement;</b> rather, it facilitates ritual purity. <b>Rather, say</b> that <b>the entire verse is written with regard to Yom Kippur,</b> as the rites performed to achieve atonement on Yom Kippur are similar to those performed during the days of the inauguration. What, then, is the source for sequestering the priest who is to perform the red heifer ritual?",
            "The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>Derive</b> it from a verbal analogy between the terms <b>commanded</b> and <b>commanded. It is stated here,</b> with regard to the days of the inauguration: <b>“The Lord commanded to do,” and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the red heifer: <b>“This is the statute of the Torah that the Lord commanded, saying”</b> (Numbers 19:2). <b>Just as</b> the term commanded <b>there</b> refers <b>to the heifer, so too here,</b> the phrase: “The Lord commanded to do” written in the context of the days of the inauguration refers <b>to the heifer. And just as here,</b> with regard to the inauguration, there is the principle of <b>sequestering</b> prior to performing the service, <b>so too there,</b> in the context of the <i>halakhot</i> of the heifer, <b>sequestering</b> is required prior to performance of the mitzva."
        ],
        [
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And say</b> that there is indeed a verbal analogy; however, it is not between the red heifer and the inauguration of the priests, but between the term <b>commanded</b> in the context of the inauguration and the term <b>commanded</b> in the context <b>of Yom Kippur, as it is written:</b> “And this will be an everlasting statute for you, to atone for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year; <b>and he did as the Lord commanded Moses”</b> (Leviticus 16:34). In that case, only the sequestering prior to Yom Kippur can be derived. The Gemara rejects this, as a verbal analogy is derived only between functionally similar phrases. <b>One derives commanded that is</b> stated <b>before performance,</b> as in the portion of the heifer, <b>from commanded that is</b> stated <b>before performance</b> in the portion of the inauguration; <b>and one does not derive commanded that is</b> stated <b>after performance</b> in the portion of Yom Kippur <b>from commanded that is</b> stated <b>before performance.</b>",
            "Again the Gemara asks: <b>And say</b> that there is a verbal analogy between the term commanded in the context of the inauguration and the term <b>commanded</b> with regard to <b>offerings, as it is written: “On the day that He commanded [<i>tzavoto</i>] the children of Israel</b> to sacrifice their offerings” (Leviticus 7:38). The result would be that any priest sacrificing a communal offering would require sequestering for seven days. The Gemara rejects this: <b>One derives</b> the term <b>commanded from</b> the identical term <b>commanded, and one does not derive</b> the term <b>that he commanded [<i>tzavoto</i>] from</b> the term <b>commanded [<i>tziva</i>].</b>",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>What is the practical difference</b> between the two terms? <b>Didn’t the school of Rabbi Yishmael teach</b> a verbal analogy with regard to leprosy of houses between the verse: <b>“And the priest shall return [<i>veshav</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:39) and the verse: <b>“And the priest shall come [<i>uva</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:44)? From that verbal analogy it is derived that <b>this is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>returning,</b> i.e., it is after seven days; and <b>this is</b> the same <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>coming,</b> i.e., it is also after seven days. Obviously, the less pronounced difference in grammatical forms between <i>tziva</i> and <i>tzavoto</i> should not prevent the teaching of a verbal analogy.",
            "The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>This applies</b> only <b>where there are no</b> terms <b>that are identical to it; however, where there are terms that are identical to it, we derive</b> the verbal analogy <b>from</b> terms <b>that are identical to it,</b> rather than from terms that are merely similar.",
            "§ The Gemara analyzes the verbal analogy from which the sequestering of the High Priest is derived. The Gemara states with regard to the phrase <b>“to make atonement,”</b> written in the context of the inauguration: <b>These are the actions</b> performed on <b>Yom Kippur.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>And say</b> that it refers to <b>the atonement of offerings</b> in general, such that any priest engaged in sacrificing atonement offerings must be sequestered seven days beforehand.",
            "The Gemara seeks to reject this suggestion from a practical perspective. <b>Do we know</b> in advance <b>which priest will happen</b> to sacrifice a given offering, and <b>who</b> would consequently <b>require sequestering?</b> The Sages <b>say: Why not?</b> There are certainly ways to do so. Each of the twenty-four priestly watches has set weeks during which it serves in the Temple, and the patrilineal families that constitute that watch have set days during that week on which each serves in the Temple. <b>We could require sequestering for the entire patrilineal family of the</b> priestly <b>watch</b> designated to serve on that day the following week. The Gemara rejects the suggestion that all priests should be sequestered prior to sacrificing an atonement offering. <b>We derive a matter that has a fixed time</b> during the year, Yom Kippur, <b>from a matter that</b> also <b>has a fixed time,</b> the inauguration of the priests for service in the Tabernacle, <b>to the exclusion of offerings that are</b> sacrificed <b>every day.</b>",
            "Again the Gemara asks: <b>And say</b> that one derives from the phrase “to make atonement” the principle of sequestering prior to sacrificing atonement offerings on the <b>Festivals,</b> which have fixed times. The Gemara rejects this: <b>We derive a matter that is performed once a year,</b> the service of Yom Kippur, <b>from a matter that is performed once a year,</b> like the inauguration, which was a one-time event, <b>to the exclusion of</b> the service on the <b>Festivals, which is not</b> performed <b>once a year;</b> rather, it is performed three times a year.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And say</b> that the service on <b>one Festival</b> of the three, which is performed once a year, should require sequestering. <b>And if you say: We do not know which of them</b> is the most significant and requires sequestering, since one could suggest that it is <b>Passover, with which the verse opened,</b> as the Torah always lists it first among the Festivals; <b>or</b> one could suggest that it is <b><i>Sukkot</i>, since its mitzva</b> is to bring <b>numerous</b> offerings, many more than the number brought on the other Festivals.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara rejects this possibility and explains: <b>One derives sequestering for seven days</b> prior to performing a service <b>for one day,</b> Yom Kippur, <b>from sequestering for seven days</b> prior to performing a service <b>for one day,</b> the inauguration. <b>And one does not derive sequestering for seven days</b> prior to performing a service <b>for seven</b> days, a Festival, <b>from sequestering for seven days</b> prior to performing a service <b>for one day,</b> the inauguration. Therefore, atonement offerings on Festivals are not derived from the inauguration.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And say</b> that the sequestering for seven days is prior to the festival of the <b>Eighth</b> Day of Assembly, as that would also be <b>sequestering for seven days</b> prior to performing a service <b>for one day.</b> The Gemara rejects this: <b>One derives a matter before which there is not sanctity,</b> Yom Kippur, which is preceded by weekdays, <b>from a matter before which there is not sanctity,</b> the day of the inauguration, which was also preceded by weekdays. <b>And we do not derive a matter before which there is sanctity,</b> the Eighth Day of Assembly, which is preceded by the seven days of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>from a matter before which there is not sanctity.</b>",
            "The Gemara challenges this: <b>And is it not an <i>a fortiori</i> inference? Now,</b> if <b>a matter before which there is not sanctity requires sequestering,</b> due to its sanctity, then with regard to <b>a matter before which there is sanctity, all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that it should require sequestering? <b>Rav Mesharshiyya said</b> in rejection of this challenge: <b>No,</b> there is no <i>a fortiori</i> inference here, as the verse: “As has been done <b>this</b> day, so the Lord has commanded to do, to make atonement for you” (Leviticus 8:34), <b>is written</b> to emphasize specifically a day <b>like this</b> day; precisely as it was for the inauguration, and not in any other situation.",
            "<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> There is another reason why it could not be that sequestering is required prior to the Eighth Day of Assembly. Is <b>there</b> any <b>matter where the primary Festival,</b> the first day of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>does not require sequestering,</b> as was already proven, while that which is <b>secondary to it requires sequestering?</b> Since the Eighth Day of Assembly is an addendum to <i>Sukkot</i>, could its sanctity and stringency be greater than that which is associated with the primary Festival? <b>And even according to the one who said: The Eighth</b> Day of Assembly <b>is a Festival in and of itself</b> and is not part of the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>that applies only to the matter of</b>"

            "<b><i>Peh</i>, <i>zayin</i>, <i>reish</i>, <i>kuf</i>, <i>shin</i>, <i>beit</i>,</b> an acronym for: Lottery [<i>payis</i>], as a new lottery is performed on that day to determine which priests will sacrifice the offerings that day, and the order established on <i>Sukkot</i> does not continue; the blessing of time [<i>zeman</i>]: Who has given us life, sustained us, and brought us to this time, is recited just as it is recited at the start of each Festival; Festival [<i>regel</i>], as it is considered a Festival in and of itself and there is no mitzva to reside in the <i>sukka</i> (see <i>Tosafot</i>); offering [<i>korban</i>], as the number of offerings sacrificed on the Eighth Day is not a continuation of the number offered on <i>Sukkot</i> but is part of a new calculation; song [<i>shira</i>], as the Psalms recited by the Levites as the offerings were sacrificed on the Eighth Day are not a continuation of those recited on <i>Sukkot</i>; blessing [<i>berakha</i>], as the addition to the third blessing of Grace after Meals and in the <i>Amida</i> prayer (see <i>Tosafot</i>) is phrased differently than the addition recited on <i>Sukkot</i>.",
            "<b>However,</b> despite all these differences, <b>with regard to compensation</b> for failure to sacrifice the Festival offerings at the earliest opportunity, everyone agrees that <b>it is</b> a day of <b>compensation for</b> obligations not met during the <b>first</b> Festival, <b>as didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>One who did not celebrate on the first Festival day</b> of <i>Sukkot</i> by sacrificing the Festival offering may <b>celebrate</b> and sacrifice the Festival offering throughout <b>the whole Festival in its entirety,</b> including <b>the last Festival day of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>. Apparently, the Eighth Day of Assembly is considered the last Festival day of Sukkot and is appended to it with regard to its obligations.",
            "The Gemara challenges further: <b>And say</b> that the priest should be sequestered before the festival of <b><i>Shavuot</i>,</b> which is a Festival preceded by weekdays, as there too <b>it is</b> a matter of <b>sequestering of seven</b> days <b>for one day. Rabbi Abba said:</b> There is a distinction between the inauguration and <i>Shavuot</i>, as <b>one derives</b> an instance where the obligatory offering is <b>one bull and one ram,</b> Yom Kippur, <b>from</b> an instance where the obligatory offering is <b>one bull and one ram,</b> the inauguration, <b>to the exclusion of <i>Shavuot</i>,</b> when <b>they are two rams</b> that are offered.",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>This</b> works out <b>well</b> according <b>to the one who said</b> that the obligatory offering on <b>Yom Kippur is one ram; however,</b> according <b>to the one who said</b> that <b>they are two rams</b> that are sacrificed on Yom Kippur, <b>what is there to say?</b> According to that opinion, Yom Kippur is not comparable to the inauguration. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: One ram is the one that is mentioned here;</b> as it is written: “With this Aaron will come into the Sanctuary, with a young bull for a sin-offering and a ram for a burnt-offering” (Leviticus 16:3), and <b>it is the</b> same <b>one that is mentioned in the book of Numbers:</b> “And on the tenth day of the seventh month you will have a sacred gathering when you will afflict your souls; you will not do any labor, and you will offer a burnt-offering to the Lord for a sweet aroma: One young bull, one ram…” (Numbers 29:7–8). <b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: They are two rams</b> offered on Yom Kippur, <b>one mentioned here</b> in the book of Leviticus <b>and one mentioned in the book of Numbers.</b>",
            "The Gemara rejects this solution: <b>Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> and two rams are brought on Yom Kippur, a distinction remains between Yom Kippur and <i>Shavuot</i>. <b>There,</b> with regard to Yom Kippur, <b>one</b> ram, mentioned in the book of Leviticus, is <b>for the obligation of the day,</b> the atonement of Yom Kippur; <b>and one</b> ram, mentioned in the book of Numbers, is for the <b>additional offerings.</b> This is <b>to the exclusion of</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b><i>Shavuot</i>, where both</b> rams <b>are obligations of the day.</b> Therefore, there is no basis for deriving the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <i>Shavuot</i> from the inauguration.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And say</b> that the requirement derived is to sequester the priest prior to <b>Rosh HaShana, as</b> there, too, <b>it is sequestering of seven</b> days <b>for one day.</b> The days before Rosh HaShana are weekdays, and as in the inauguration, a bull and a ram are sacrificed. <b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that this too is rejected: <b>One derives a bull and a ram</b> that the High Priest brings <b>from his own</b> property on Yom Kippur <b>from a bull and a ram</b> that Aaron brought <b>from his own</b> property at the inauguration. This is <b>to the exclusion of <i>Shavuot</i> and Rosh HaShana,</b> when the bull and the ram sacrificed are <b>from community</b> property and not owned by the priest.

            "<b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that when the Torah states: <b>Take you,</b> it means <b>from your own</b> property, <b>and</b> when it states: <b>Make you,</b> it means <b>from your own</b> property; however, when the Torah states: <b>And they will bring to you,</b> it means <b>from community</b> property.

According to the <b>one who said</b> that the Torah was given <b>on the seventh</b> of the month, <b>it was given on the seventh and Moses ascended on the seventh, as it is written: “And he called to Moses on the seventh day.”</b>",
            "The Gemara proceeds to link the two disputes. <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i></b> in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>who said</b> that it was <b>on the sixth</b> of the month <b>that the Torah was given; therefore, this incident occurred after</b> the revelation of <b>the Ten Commandments.</b> That is why he explains the verse <b>“And the glory of the Lord abode on Mount Sinai and the cloud covered him for six days”</b> to mean that the cloud covered <b>Moses, and He called to Moses on the seventh day to receive the rest of the Torah. As, should it enter your mind</b> to interpret the verse as follows: <b>“And the glory of the Lord abode” from the New Moon</b> of Sivan; <b>“And the cloud covered it,” the mountain; “And He called to Moses on the seventh day,”</b> to receive only the Ten Commandments; <b>didn’t they</b> already <b>receive</b> the Ten Commandments <b>on the sixth</b> of the month, <b>and the cloud</b> that was on the mountain <b>already departed on the sixth</b> of the month?",
            "<b>And Rabbi Akiva holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, who said that on the seventh of the month</b> the <b>Torah was given to the Jewish people.</b> That is why Moses was summoned on the seventh of the month immediately after the revelation of the Ten Commandments. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> that the Torah was given on the seventh of Sivan and Moses then proceeded to climb the mountain and remain there for forty days, <b>that</b> explains the calculation <b>that you find: On the seventeenth of Tammuz the tablets were shattered,</b> according to the standard tradition.

            "<b>However, according to Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who said:</b> There were <b>six</b> days <b>of sequestering</b> after the Torah was given and an additional <b>forty</b> days <b>that</b> Moses was on the <b>mountain, the tablets were not shattered until the twenty-third of Tammuz,</b> contrary to the standard tradition. <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili</b> could have <b>said to you: The forty</b> days <b>that</b> Moses was on the <b>mountain include the six</b> days <b>of sequestering.</b>",

            "<b>Rabbi Zerika raised a contradiction between verses before Rabbi Elazar, and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Zerika said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar raised a contradiction: It is written</b> in one place: <b>“And Moses was not able to enter into the Tent of Meeting because the cloud dwelt on it”</b> (Exodus 40:35), as Moses was unable to enter the cloud. <b>And it is written</b> elsewhere: <b>“And Moses came into the cloud”</b> (Exodus 24:18). <b>This teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, grabbed Moses and brought him into the cloud</b> since he could not enter on his own.",
            "<b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> There is a verbal analogy that resolves this contradiction. <b>It is stated here:</b> “And Moses came <b>into</b> the cloud,” <b>and it is stated below,</b> in another verse: <b>“And the children of Israel went into the sea</b> on dry land” (Exodus 14:22); <b>Just as below,</b> there was <b>a path</b> within the sea, <b>as it is written: “And the water was a wall for them”</b> (Exodus 14:22), <b>here too,</b> there was <b>a path</b> through the cloud, but Moses did not actually enter the cloud.",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a source for the fact that when the High Priest is appointed, there is a requirement of donning <b>multiple</b> garments for <b>seven</b> days <b><i>ab initio</i>;</b> however, <b>from where do we</b> derive the requirement of <b>anointment</b> for <b>seven</b> days <b><i>ab initio</i>?</b> According to Ravina, there is a requirement to anoint the priest on each of the seven days <i>ab initio</i>, even though failure to do so does not invalidate the offering throughout the generations. From where is that requirement derived?",
            "<b>If you wish, say:</b> It is derived <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the verse:</b> “And the priest who shall be anointed and who shall be consecrated to serve in his father’s stead shall make the atonement,” <b>is necessary to exclude</b> requirements derived from other sources, i.e., that both donning multiple garments and anointment must be for seven days. Apparently, anointment for seven days is required <i>ab initio</i>. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that it is derived from <b>that</b> which <b>the verse states: “And the sacred garments of Aaron shall be for his sons after him, to be anointed in them and to be consecrated in them”</b> (Exodus 29:29). <b>Anointment is juxtaposed</b> in this verse <b>to</b> donning <b>multiple</b> garments: <b>Just as</b> donning <b>multiple</b> garments is required <b>for seven</b> days <i>ab initio</i>, <b>so too, anointment</b> is required <b>for seven</b> days <i>ab initio</i>.",

            "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> One <b>derives a</b> verbal analogy between the word opening that appears in the two portions of the inauguration. It is written in the command concerning the inauguration: “The <b>opening</b> of the Tent of Meeting” (Exodus 29:32), and in its fulfillment it is written: “The <b>opening</b> of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 8:31). Failure to perform the matters written in both portions invalidates the inauguration.<br><b>Rav Mesharshiyya said:</b> The verbal analogy is unnecessary, as the conclusion can be derived directly from the verse written with regard to the implementation of the inauguration: <b>“And keep the charge of the Lord,</b> that you not die, for so I am commanded” (Leviticus 8:35). The emphasis on this being the charge of the Lord comes to teach that failure to perform all the details mentioned in the implementation of the command <b>invalidates</b> the inauguration. <br><b>Rav Ashi says:</b> The phrase: <b>For so I am commanded,</b> is the source from which it is derived that all the details written in both portions <b>invalidate</b> the inauguration.",
            "Apropos that phrase, the Gemara cites a related halakhic midrash. <b>The Sages taught:</b> In the context of the implementation of the inauguration, three variations of the phrase appear: <b>“For so I am commanded”</b> (Leviticus 8:35); <b>“as I commanded”</b> (Leviticus 10:18); and <b>“as God has commanded”</b> (Leviticus 10:15). What does this repetition teach? From the phrase: <b>“For so I am commanded,”</b> it is derived that even in a state of <b>acute mourning,</b> on the first day after the death of a relative, one must <b>eat</b> the offering. God stated the verse: <b>“As I commanded,” at the time of the incident</b> just after the deaths of Nadav and Avihu, when Aaron and his sons were in a state of acute mourning.

It is written: <b>“This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer to the Lord</b> in the day when he is anointed, <b>a tenth of an ephah”</b> (Leviticus 6:13). And in the verse cited above in the context of the inauguration it says: “And this is the matter that you shall do for them,” which teaches that there is an obligation to offer a tenth of an ephah during the inauguration.",

What is the point of the Gemara’s question?",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>This is</b> what the Gemara <b>is saying. Why did he withdraw from his house,</b> i.e., his wife? The Gemara explained why he must be removed to a special location; but why doesn’t his wife join him? <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says:</b> It is due to the concern <b>lest his wife be found</b> to be in a situation of <b>uncertainty</b> as to whether or not she has the halakhic status of <b>a menstruating woman, and</b> he will <b>have relations with her</b> and become impure.",
            "The Gemara asks in astonishment: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>we are dealing with wicked people?</b> Will the High Priest, aware of the uncertain status of his wife, have relations with her? <b>Rather,</b> rephrase the statement: It is due to the concern <b>lest he have relations with his wife and</b> then <b>she be found</b> to be in a situation of <b>uncertainty</b> as to whether or not she has the halakhic status of <b>a menstruating woman.</b> In a case where blood is found on the sheets after the couple engaged in relations, and there is uncertainty as to whether or not the High Priest had relations with his wife while she had the halakhic status of a menstruating woman, the status of the High Priest is one of uncertain impurity.",

As, if</b> it were in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> it is difficult: <b>Didn’t they say</b> that a woman with regard to whom there is uncertainty as to whether or not she has the halakhic status of <b>a menstruating woman does not render the man who had with relations with her</b> retroactively <b>impure.</b> Therefore, the High Priest need not leave his wife during the week prior to Yom Kippur.",
            "<b>Rav Ḥisda said to</b> the Sages: <b>Even if you say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of the <b>Rabbis, the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Akiva</b> with regard to retroactive impurity <b>only</b> in a case where blood was discovered on the sheets <b>long afterward,</b> after there was time for the woman to leave the bed and bathe and only then discover the blood. Due to the time that elapsed, the Rabbis hold that there is no way to prove a connection between when the woman menstruated and when they engaged in relations. <b>However,</b> if the blood was found merely <b>afterward,</b> the Rabbis <b>concede to</b> Rabbi Akiva that she renders the man retroactively impure.",
            "<b>Rabbi Zeira said: Learn from it</b> that one who is impure because <b>he had relations with a menstruating woman is unlike a menstruating woman</b> in terms of the time of immersion.

Therefore, if a High Priest has relations with his wife just before he is sequestered and there is uncertainty as to whether she has the halakhic status of a menstruating woman, the seventh day of his impurity occurs on Yom Kippur eve. He immerses himself that day and completes the purification process at nightfall. This allows him to enter the Temple to perform the Yom Kippur service.",

            "The Gemara rejects that proof because the term <b>menstruating woman</b> in that <i>baraita</i> includes the woman <b>and everyone whose inclusion</b> in the impurity <b>is derived</b> from her status.

            "Apparently, the frontplate <b>gains forgiveness only</b> for <b>the sin of impurity, which was exempted from its general</b> prohibition <b>in</b> cases involving <b>the public.</b> This poses <b>a difficulty to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Sheshet,</b> who said that the prohibition of impurity is overridden in cases involving the public, as the <i>baraita</i> clearly states that impurity is permitted. The Gemara responds: According to Rav Sheshet, the question of whether the prohibition of impurity is permitted or overridden in cases involving the public <b>is</b> the subject of <b>a dispute between <i>tanna’im</i>, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The frontplate effects acceptance whether it is on</b> the High Priest’s <b>forehead or whether it is not on</b> the High Priest’s <b>forehead</b> when the offering becomes impure.

How could you suggest that the legal status of a residence occupied for only part of the year is not that of a house? <b>Isn’t it written: “I will strike the winter-house with the summer-house”</b> (Amos 3:15)? Apparently, even a residence occupied only half the year is a house. Rava <b>said to him:</b> A residence occupied only part of the year may be <b>called the winter-house or the summer-house.

            "<b>Abaye raised a</b> different <b>objection to</b> the opinion of Rava, from a mishna: If one brought produce from the field into <b>the <i>sukka</i></b> that he constructed for <b>the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>on the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>Rabbi Yehuda obligates</b> him to tithe the produce <b>and the Rabbis exempt</b> him from tithing the produce. <b>And it was taught concerning</b> the mishna: <b>Rabbi Yehuda obligates</b> the owner of that <i>sukka</i> to include the <i>sukka</i> <b>in</b> the <b>joining</b> of courtyards, like any of the houses in the courtyard; <b>and in</b> the mitzva of affixing a <b><i>mezuza</i></b> in the <i>sukka</i>; <b>and in</b> separating <b>tithes</b> from produce brought into the <i>sukka</i>. One is obligated to tithe his produce only when its processing has been completed. When he brings the produce into the house, he is obligated to tithe it. Rabbi Yehuda holds that the legal status of a <i>sukka</i>, in which one resides for a mere seven days, is that of a house in terms of the mitzva of <i>mezuza</i>.",
            "<b>And if you say</b> that Rabbi Yehuda rules that <b>by rabbinic law</b> the status of the <i>sukka</i> is like that of a house, but that by Torah law his opinion is consistent with Rava’s opinion, <b>granted,</b> with regard to the <b>joining</b> of courtyards <b>and <i>mezuza</i>, it is</b> possible <b>to say</b> that the obligation is <b>by rabbinic law; however,</b> with regard to <b>tithes, is it</b> possible <b>to say</b> that according to Rabbi Yehuda the obligation is <b>by rabbinic law?</b>"

Produce that one is obligated to tithe by rabbinic law has the status of exempt produce by Torah law. Since it is difficult to distinguish between produce that one is obligated to tithe by Torah law and produce that one is obligated to tithe by rabbinic law, one might seek to fulfill his obligation by separating tithes from one for the other. In both cases, both the produce designated as a tithe and the produce for which it was tithed would retain the status of untithed produce. Therefore, Rabbi Yehuda could not have said that a <i>sukka</i> is considered a house by rabbinic law.",
            "<b>Rather, Abaye said:</b> The dispute with regard to the <i>mezuza</i> in the <i>Parhedrin</i> chamber must be explained differently. <b>During</b> the <b>seven</b> days that the High Priest lives in the <i>Parhedrin</i> chamber during his sequestering, <b>everyone agrees that</b> the chamber is <b>obligated</b> in the mitzva to affix a <i>mezuza</i> there. <b>When they disagree</b> is with regard to <b>the rest of the days of the year,</b> when no one resides there. <b>The Rabbis hold: We issue a decree</b> and require that a <i>mezuza</i> be affixed during the rest of the year <b>due to</b> those <b>seven</b> days that the High Priest lives there; <b>and Rabbi Yehuda holds: We do not issue</b> that <b>decree,</b> and there is no obligation to affix a <i>mezuza</i> to the chamber the rest of the year.",

If, as Abaye said, the <i>tanna’im</i> agree that there is an obligation to affix a <i>mezuza</i> during the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> even though it is used for only a brief period, on what basis do the Rabbis rule that there is no obligation even on the Festival itself?",

            "The Gemara explains: With regard to <b><i>sukka</i>, the reason is discrete.

            "<b>And</b> similarly, with regard to the <b>chamber, the reason is discrete.

However, the Sages <b>instituted</b> this obligation <b>by rabbinic law so that</b> people <b>will not say: The High Priest is imprisoned in jail,</b> as only in substandard residences that appear unfit for residence is there no obligation to affix a <i>mezuza</i>.",
            "<b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>? <b>As the Sages taught:</b>"

            "<b>Let us say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis and not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as, if</b> it were in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> a difficulty arises.

            "§ Apropos the <i>mezuza</i> in the High Priest’s chamber, the Gemara discusses other <i>halakhot</i> of <i>mezuza</i>. <b>The Sages taught</b> with regard to the verse: “And you will write them upon the doorposts of your houses and <b>upon your gates”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:9): With regard to <b>the gates of houses, and the gates of courtyards, and the gates of cities, and the gates of towns, all</b> of them are <b>obligated</b> in <b>the mitzva</b> of <i>mezuza</i> in that <b>place, due to</b> the fact <b>that it is stated: “And you will write them upon the doorposts of your houses and upon your gates.”</b>",

            "<b>And Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> There was <b>an incident</b> involving <b>an examiner [<i>artavin</i>], who was examining <i>mezuzot</i> in the upper marketplace of Tzippori</b> during a period when decrees were issued against the Jewish people, <b>and a</b> Roman <b>official [<i>kasdor</i>] found him and collected</b> a fine of <b>one thousand <i>zuz</i> from him.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Elazar say</b> that <b>those on the path to perform a mitzva are not</b> susceptible to <b>harm</b> throughout the process of performing the mitzva? The Gemara responds: In a place <b>where danger is permanent it is different,</b> as one should not rely on a miracle, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to God’s command to Samuel to anoint David as king in place of Saul: <b>“And Samuel said: How will I go, and Saul will hear and kill me; and God said: Take in your hand a calf and say: I have come to offer a sacrifice to God”</b> (I Samuel 16:2).

            "After discussing the status of Jerusalem, the Gemara addresses the matter of synagogues in villages.

It is written: “When you enter the land of Canaan that I give you <b>for a possession,</b> and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession” (Leviticus 14:34).

            "<b>The verse states: “And the one whom the house is his will come”</b> (Leviticus 14:35); one <b>whom</b> the house <b>is designated for him</b> and who is certain of his ownership, <b>excluding those</b> houses <b>which are not designated for him.</b> Apparently, the legal status of synagogues in villages is that of communal property, as the portion of each individual is not clearly identifiable, and therefore they cannot become impure. <b>Rather,</b> there is no distinction in this regard between synagogues in large cities and those in villages. And with regard to the original question, <b>it is clear as we responded initially</b> with alternative resolutions to the contradiction between the <i>baraitot</i>.",
            "§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>And they would designate another priest</b> in the High Priest’s stead, lest a disqualification due to impurity prevent his entering the Temple on Yom Kippur. The Gemara asks: It is <b>obvious</b> that if <b>disqualification befell</b> the incumbent High Priest <b>prior to the</b> sacrifice of the <b>daily morning offering</b> on Yom Kippur, that <b>one initiates</b> the replacement by dressing him in the eight garments of the High Priest <b>with the daily morning offering,</b> which renders him acting High Priest. <b>However,</b> if <b>disqualification befell</b> the incumbent High Priest <b>after the daily morning offering, how does one initiate</b> the replacement? After the daily morning offering, the High Priest begins the Yom Kippur service clothed in the four linen garments unique to the day, which are the same as the tunic, trousers, turban, and belt of the common priest. How is it evident that he is the acting High Priest?",
            "<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said:</b> It is evident <b>by</b> means of his <b>belt.</b> The belt worn by the High Priest on Yom Kippur was made of linen, unlike that of the common priest, which was a mixture of the diverse kinds of linen and wool. The Gemara asks: <b>This</b> works out <b>well</b> according <b>to the one who said:</b> Throughout the rest of the year, <b>the belt of the High Priest,</b> which the Torah clearly states is made of a mixture of diverse kinds, <b>is</b> identical to <b>the belt of the common priest,</b> whereas on Yom Kippur, the belt is made of linen. When the replacement priest dons the linen belt he is initiated as the acting High Priest. <b>However, according to the one who said: The belt of the High Priest is not</b> identical to <b>the belt of the common priest, what can be said?</b> According to this approach, throughout the year the High Priest wears a belt of blue and purple wool and linen, while the belts of common priests are made of white linen like the rest of their clothes. Therefore, on Yom Kippur, when the High Priest dons a belt of white linen, his belt is identical to that of a common priest. If so, what initiates the replacement as acting High Priest?",
            "<b>Abaye said:</b> Before the replacement begins serving on Yom Kippur with the four linen garments, he is initiated and promoted to the High Priesthood by <b>donning</b> the <b>eight</b> garments of the High Priest <b>and turning over</b> one of the limbs on the altar <b>with a fork,</b> thereby accelerating the burning of the daily morning offering. By performing part of the service while wearing the garments of the High Priest, he is initiated as acting High Priest. <b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Huna, as Rav Huna said: A non-priest who turns over</b> part of the offering on the altar <b>with a fork is liable</b> to receive the <b>death</b> penalty because he engaged in Temple service restricted to priests. <b>And Rav Pappa said:</b>"
        ],
        [
            "That action is unnecessary and therefore superfluous; <b>his service initiates him.</b> The replacement High Priest need not undergo any preliminary initiation. His very performance of the Yom Kippur service, which is valid only if performed by the High Priest, initiates him as acting High Priest. As proof, the Gemara states: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>all the</b> sacred <b>vessels that Moses made, their anointment</b> with oil <b>consecrates them. From that</b> point <b>forward,</b> in the generations after Moses, new vessels did not require anointment to be consecrated; rather, <b>their</b> use in Temple <b>service initiates them</b> and renders them fit for use. <b>Here, too,</b> with regard to the High Priest, <b>his service initiates him.</b>",
            "§ Apropos the belt of the High Priest, the Gemara cites the aforementioned dispute in its entirety. <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he said:</b> With regard to <b>the belt of the common priest,</b> there is a dispute between <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon.

            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Conclude that it is Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>who said</b> that the belt of the common priest was a mixture <b>of diverse kinds, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The only</b> difference <b>between a High Priest and a common priest is</b> the <b>belt;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: Not even</b> the <b>belt</b> represents a difference between them. The Gemara explains: With regard to the difference between the High Priest and the common priest, <b>when</b> is there a dispute between the <i>tanna’im</i>? <b>If we say</b> that the dispute is with regard to <b>the rest of the days of the year, there are many</b> other differences between them, since <b>the High Priest serves</b> wearing <b>eight garments and the common</b> priest wears <b>four</b> garments. Therefore, that could not be the point of the dispute.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> is it <b>not</b> that the dispute is with regard to the differences between the High Priest and the common priest on <b>Yom Kippur?</b> They agree that the belt of the High Priest on Yom Kippur is made of linen, but disagree with regard to the common priest’s belt. According to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, who says that there is a difference between the belts, the belt of the common priest must be made of a mixture of diverse kinds. According to Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, who says that there is no difference between their belts, the belt of the common priest must be made of linen, like that of the High Priest on Yom Kippur.",
            "The Gemara rejects this proof. The Sages <b>say: No,</b> this is not a proof, as <b>actually,</b> the dispute is with regard to the differences <b>during the rest of the days of the year.</b> However, the dispute is not with regard to all the differences between the High Priest and the common priest, but rather only with regard to <b>those</b> four garments <b>common</b> to both priests: The tunic, trousers, turban, and belt. Based on this understanding that the dispute is with regard to the rest of the year, the analysis of the dispute is reversed: According to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi the belt of the High Priest is a mixture of diverse kinds and that of the common priest is made of linen, while according to Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, the belt of the common priest is a mixture of diverse kinds. Therefore, there is no definitive proof from the <i>baraita</i>.",
            "<b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he stated</b> this tradition in a clearer fashion: With regard to <b>the belt of the High Priest on Yom Kippur, everyone agrees</b> that it is made <b>of fine linen,</b> as stated in the Torah. With regard to <b>the belt of the High Priest during the rest of the days of the year, everyone agrees</b> that it is a mixture <b>of diverse kinds. They disagreed only with regard to the belt of the common priest both during the rest of the days of the year and on Yom Kippur, as Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi says: It was a mixture <b>of diverse kinds, and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says</b> it was made <b>of linen.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: We, too, have learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah says with regard to the removal of the ashes from the altar: “And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen trousers shall he put <b>upon his flesh”</b> (Leviticus 6:3). The <i>baraita</i> questions the formulation of the verse. Since at the beginning of the verse it is written: “And the priest shall put on,” for <b>what</b> purpose <b>does the verse state: “Shall he put upon,”</b> in the latter part of the verse? <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> It comes <b>to include</b> donning the <b>mitre</b> and the <b>belt for the removal of the ashes,</b> even though it is not explicitly stated in the verse. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Dosa says</b> that the term: Shall put on, comes <b>to include</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>the garments of the High Priest on Yom Kippur are fit for a common priest.</b> During the Yom Kippur service, the High Priest wears just four linen garments. Although he may not serve in those garments on Yom Kippur the following year, a common priest may serve in them during the rest of the year. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: There are two responses to</b> reject this <b>statement</b> of Rabbi Dosa. <b>One: The belt of the High Priest on Yom Kippur is not</b> the same as <b>the belt of the common priest</b> during the rest of the year. Clearly, according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, the belt of the High Priest on Yom Kippur is made of linen, and that of the common priest during the year is a mixture of the diverse kinds of wool and linen.",
            "<b>And furthermore,</b> there is another reason to reject the statement of Rabbi Dosa. Could it be that with regard to <b>garments that were used</b> by the High Priest to perform a service of <b>extreme sanctity,</b> the common priest <b>will use them</b> to perform a service of <b>minor sanctity? Rather,</b> according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, for <b>what</b> purpose <b>does the verse state</b> the phrase: <b>Shall put on?</b> It comes <b>to include threadbare</b> garments and to teach that as long as they are not completely tattered, they may be worn for that service.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Dosa follows his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: That which is written: “And Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the Sanctuary, <b>and shall leave them there”</b> (Leviticus 16:23), <b>teaches</b> that the garments worn by the High Priest on Yom Kippur <b>require interment</b> and may not be put to additional use. <b>Rabbi Dosa says:</b> It means only that the High Priest <b>may not use them</b> on <b>Yom Kippur</b> in <b>a different</b> year. According to Rabbi Dosa, they may be worn by a common priest during his service, as they do not require interment.",
            "§ The Gemara returns to the initiation of the acting High Priest. <b>The Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: If <b>a disqualification befalls</b> the High Priest <b>and they appointed another in his stead,</b> and then the cause of the disqualification of the High Priest is resolved, e.g., he was purified from impurity, the <b>original</b> High Priest <b>returns to his service.</b> With regard to the <b>second,</b> acting High Priest, <b>all the mitzvot of the High Priesthood are</b> incumbent <b>upon him.</b> He serves wearing eight garments and it is prohibited for him to let his hair grow, to rend his garments in mourning the death of a relative, to subject himself to impurity imparted by the corpse of a relative, or to marry a widow. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The <b>original</b> priest <b>returns to his service,</b> while the <b>second is fit</b> to serve <b>neither as High Priest</b> with eight garments, because there is a different High Priest; <b>nor as a common priest</b> with four garments, as once he was elevated to a state of extreme sanctity he may not be reduced to a state of minor sanctity.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yosei said</b> as proof for his opinion: There was <b>an incident involving</b> the priest <b>Yosef ben Elem of Tzippori,</b> who, when a reason for <b>disqualification befell a High Priest,</b> the priests <b>appointed him in his stead.</b> After the cause of the disqualification was resolved, <b>the Sages said:</b> The <b>original</b> High Priest <b>returns to his service,</b> while the <b>second is fit</b> to serve <b>neither as High Priest nor as a common priest.</b> The Gemara explains: Neither as a <b>High Priest, due to hatred,</b> jealousy and bitterness that would arise if there were two High Priests with equal standing in the Temple; nor as a <b>common priest, because</b> the principle is: <b>One elevates</b> to a higher level <b>in</b> matters of <b>sanctity and one does not downgrade.</b> Once he has served as a High Priest he cannot be restored to the position of a common priest.",

The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that the mere knowledge that another priest is in waiting to replace him is enough to generate hatred, and <b>would be for him</b> like a woman whose husband has taken a <b>rival wife in</b> her <b>lifetime;</b> therefore, Rav <b>teaches us</b> that this is not a concern.",

The Gemara asks with regard to <b>the Rabbis: Aren’t they concerned lest</b> he become impure, which is why the Sages designate a replacement High Priest? Why then, are they not concerned lest his wife die? The Gemara answers that <b>the Rabbis</b> could have <b>said to you: Impurity is common,</b> as it is not unusual for the High Priest to become impure either due to secretions from his body or from an external source. <b>Death is not common,</b> and therefore there is no concern lest his wife die.",
            "It was taught in the mishna that <b>the Rabbis said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda: <b>If so,</b> that you are concerned lest his wife die, <b>there is no end to the matter.</b> You should also be concerned lest the second wife die, requiring designation of a third and even a fourth wife.

The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yehuda says <b>that</b> not only is a replacement wife designated, but <b>he</b> actually <b>marries her. If so,</b> another problem arises. The High Priest <b>has two houses, and the Merciful One said: “And he shall make atonement for himself and for his house”</b> (Leviticus 16:11).

            "The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yehuda says <b>that</b> after marrying the second wife, <b>he then divorces her.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If he divorces her, our difficulty is restored to its</b> original <b>place.</b> There is no point in designating a second wife, as if the first wife dies, the second woman is not married to him. The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where</b> he marries her and <b>divorces her provisionally, as he says to her: This is your bill of divorce on condition that you die</b> on Yom Kippur. If she dies on Yom Kippur, then she was divorced retroactively and he has only one wife; if she does not die but the original wife dies, her divorce does not take effect and the second wife is married to the High Priest.

One may derive from this: One house, i.e., wife, and not two. The Gemara responds that when the Torah says: “Then <b>his <i>yevama</i></b> shall go up to the gate” (Deuteronomy 25:7), “and <b>his <i>yevama</i></b> will draw nigh to him” (Deuteronomy 25:9), twice, it comes to <b>include</b> a situation where the deceased had two wives; in that case one of them is required to marry his brother in levirate marriage.",

In practice, that is not the <i>halakha</i>. The Gemara answers that the Torah says: “The wife of the dead shall not be married <b>outside</b> to one not of his kin” (Deuteronomy 25:5). The superfluous term: Outside, comes <b>to include the betrothed woman.</b> Although she is technically still outside the family, the brother of the deceased must either marry her in levirate marriage or perform <i>ḥalitza</i>.",

According to tradition, even Solomon in his great wisdom could not understand the contradictory nature of the sprinkling of purification water that purifies an impure person and impurifies a pure person. <b>And the Rabbis</b> ascribe Solomon’s bewilderment to a different aspect of the <i>halakha</i>: <b>The one who sprinkles</b> the water <b>and the one upon whom one sprinkles</b> the water are <b>pure; but one who touches</b> the water unrelated to sprinkling is <b>impure.</b>",

The Gemara responds: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term: <b>He who sprinkles?</b> It means: <b>He who touches. But isn’t it written: He who sprinkles?

And furthermore,</b> in that verse, <b>one who sprinkles requires washing</b> of his <b>clothes,</b> indicating a more severe level of impurity, whereas <b>one who touches does not require washing</b> of his <b>clothes.</b> Apparently, when it is written: He who sprinkles, it is not referring to one who touches.",

            "§ The Gemara cites a dispute between the Rabbis and Rabbi Shimon Ish HaMitzpa.

The Gemara asks: <b>What is the rationale</b> for the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon Ish HaMitzpa,</b> who changes the sprinkling of the blood of the daily offering vis-à-vis the sprinkling of blood of all other burnt-offerings?",
            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of one</b> of the Sages <b>of the school of Rabbi Yannai</b> that <b>the verse states: “And one goat as a sin-offering to the Lord; it shall be offered aside from the daily burnt-offering and its libation”</b> (Numbers 28:15). From the phrase: Beside the daily burnt-offering, it is derived that the daily offering is <b>a burnt-offering</b>, and from the juxtaposition of the sacrifice of the sin-offering to the daily offering, <b>the Merciful One said: Perform with it the procedure of a sin-offering.</b>",
            "And <b>how</b> can <b>this</b> be accomplished? It can be accomplished by performing half of the sprinklings according to the procedure of a burnt-offering, and half according to the procedure of a sin-offering.

            "The Gemara responds: The two suggestions are different. <b>There,</b> in the statement of Rabbi Shimon Ish HaMitzpa, there is no radical divergence from the standard burnt-offering; <b>it is merely dividing the sprinklings.</b> Instead of sprinkling the blood on the corner so that it falls on two sides of the altar, one sprinkles the blood on each of the two sides separately. In contrast, performing two independent acts of sprinkling is a radical divergence. <b>And</b> the Gemara suggests an alternative manner in which the daily offering could be offered like a sin-offering. <b>Let us sprinkle one</b> sprinkling <b>that is two below</b> the red line painted halfway up the altar, <b>in accordance with the procedure of a</b> standard <b>burnt-offering,</b> and sprinkle another <b>two sprinklings that are two above</b> the red line on the upper half of the altar <b>in accordance with the procedure of a sin-offering</b>.",

            "The Gemara rejects this: That is not a case of half the blood sprinkled upward and half sprinkled downward. Instead, that sprinkling was <b>like a <i>matzlif</i>;</b> the sprinklings were not performed one above the other, but rather one beneath the other, and all were sprinkled in a row on the Ark cover.

            "§ Just as the contradiction above was resolved by attributing different sources to different <i>tanna’im</i>, the Gemara cites an additional contradiction with a similar resolution. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there: The appointee,</b> the deputy High Priest, <b>said to</b> the other priests: <b>Go out and bring a lamb from the Chamber of the Lambs,</b> where lambs awaiting sacrifice were kept after they underwent inspection and were found to be without blemish.

            "The Gemara raises a different problem with the practice of Rav and Rav Naḥman. <b>But didn’t Rava say:</b> With regard to <b>one who proposed marriage to</b> a woman <b>and she agreed,</b> she <b>is required to sit seven clean days,</b> as perhaps due to the anticipatory desire she might not notice that she experienced menstrual bleeding and she is therefore impure. How, then, could these <i>amora’im</i> marry a woman on the day that they proposed? The Gemara answers: <b>The Sages would inform them by sending messengers before</b> their arrival. The messenger would announce that the <i>amora</i> sought to marry a local woman. The woman who agreed would in fact wait seven clean days before marrying him.",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that these Sages were not actually proposing marriage; rather, they proposed so that they could <b>be in seclusion with</b> the women, without consummating the relationship.

Similarly, an unmarried man experiences a more acute desire. In order to mitigate that desire, these Sages made certain that women would be designated for them.",

One</b> was <b>the <i>Parhedrin</i> chamber and one</b> was <b>the Chamber of the House of Avtinas. One</b> of them was <b>in the north</b> of the courtyard, <b>and one</b> was <b>in the south.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>One</b> was in <b>the north, as we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>There were six chambers in the</b> Israelite <b>courtyard, three in the north and three in the south.</b>",
            "The chambers <b>in the south</b> were <b>the Chamber of the Salt, the Chamber of the <i>Parva</i>,</b> and <b>the Chamber of the Rinsers.</b> The Gemara explains the function performed in each chamber. <b>The Chamber of the Salt</b> was <b>where</b> the priests <b>would place the salt for the offering</b> in storage <b>The Chamber of the <i>Parva</i>,</b> the hides, was <b>where they salted the consecrated hides</b> that belonged to the priests, to prevent them from spoiling. <b>And on the roof</b> of that chamber <b>was the Hall of Immersion for the High Priest for Yom Kippur.

            "In any event, it was taught that there was a chamber of the High Priest in the north of the courtyard, and there is proof that he also had <b>one</b> chamber <b>in the south</b> of the courtyard, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Seven gates were in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard, three in the north and three in the south and one in the east.</b> The gates <b>in the south</b> were <b>the Gate of Fire; second to it</b> was <b>the Gate of the Offering; third to it</b> was <b>the Gate of the Water.</b> The gate <b>that was in the east</b> was called the <b>Gate of Nicanor, and two chambers were there</b> next to the Gate of Nicanor, <b>one to its right and one to its left.

            "The Gemara rejects this reasoning: <b>Why not</b> impose upon him?

            "<b>The Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: There was <b>an incident involving a</b> certain <b>Sadducee</b> who was appointed as High Priest, <b>who prepared the incense outside</b> and then <b>brought</b> it into the Holy of Holies. <b>Upon his emergence he was overjoyed</b> that he had succeeded. <b>The father of</b> that Sadducee <b>met him and said to him: My son, although we are Sadducees</b> and you performed the service in accordance with our opinion, <b>we fear the Pharisees</b> and do not actually implement that procedure in practice. The son <b>said to his</b> father: <b>All my days I have been troubled over this verse: “For I will appear in the cloud above the Ark cover”</b> (Leviticus 16:2). The Sadducees interpreted this verse to mean that God will appear above the Ark cover, i.e., will enter the Holy of Holies, only after the incense cloud is already there. <b>I said: When will</b> the opportunity <b>become available to me, and I will fulfill it</b> according to the Sadducee interpretation? <b>Now that</b> the opportunity <b>has become available to me,</b> will <b>I not fulfill it?</b>",
            "The Sages <b>said: Not</b> even <b>a few days</b> passed <b>until he died and was laid out in the garbage</b> dump, <b>and worms were coming out of his nose</b> in punishment for his actions. <b>And some say</b> that <b>he was struck</b> as soon <b>as he emerged</b> from the Holy of Holies, <b>as Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: A type of sound was heard in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard, as an angel came and struck him in the face.

            "§ It was taught in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Zekharya ben Kevutal</b> says: Many times I read before the High Priest from the book of Daniel. <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Rava taught this to Ḥiyya bar Rav before Rav</b> in the following manner: <b>Rabbi Zekharya bar Kefutal said, and Rav demonstrated with his hand</b> that the name should be pronounced <b>Kevutal.</b> The Gemara asks: Why did Rav demonstrate his point with a gesture? <b>Let him</b> simply <b>say it.</b> The Gemara answers: Rav <b>was reciting <i>Shema</i></b> at that moment and could not interrupt <i>Shema</i> by speaking.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And is</b> interrupting in a manner <b>of that sort,</b> by gesturing, <b>permitted</b> during <i>Shema</i>? <b>Didn’t Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Shmuel bar Marta say: One who is reciting <i>Shema</i> should neither make allusions with his eyes, nor open and close</b> his mouth <b>with his lips</b> to convey a message, <b>nor gesture with his fingers?

By signaling while reciting <i>Shema</i> he behaves contemptuously toward God, and it is tantamount to not having recited <i>Shema</i> before Him. How, then, could Rav gesture while reading <i>Shema</i>?",
            "The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> prohibition to interrupt one’s recitation of <i>Shema</i> with a gesture applies <b>in</b> the course of reciting the <b>first paragraph</b> of <i>Shema</i>, which is more fundamental; <b>that</b> case where Rav gestured was <b>in</b> the course of reciting the <b>second paragraph</b> of <i>Shema</i>, where gesturing to convey a significant message is permitted.",

            "§ It was taught in the mishna that before the lottery was instituted, <b>when there were many</b> priests who sought to perform the removal of the ashes, the first priest to reach within four cubits of the top of the altar was privileged with performing the removal of the ashes. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> It is <b>obvious to me</b> that the <b>four cubits</b> the mishna is referring to are not the four cubits adjacent to the ramp <b>on the ground,</b> because <b>we learned</b> in the mishna that the priests <b>run and ascend on the ramp,</b> and not adjacent to the ramp. It is <b>also not</b> referring to the <b>first</b> four cubits from the foot of the ramp, because <b>we learned</b> that the priests <b>run and ascend on the ramp, and only afterward</b> it says: <b>Any</b> priest <b>who precedes another</b> and reaches within four cubits of the altar first, indicating that the competition begins only once they have ascended the ramp to some extent.",
            "It is <b>also not</b> referring to four cubits somewhere in the <b>middle,</b> between the four on the bottom and the top of the altar, because <b>the matter is not defined</b> and there is no clear indication which four cubits on the ramp are the determining cubits.

The priest who reaches those four cubits first is the one privileged to remove the ashes.",
            "Rav Pappa <b>raised a dilemma</b> based on the above clarification: Are the <b>four cubits that they stated,</b> which are the four cubits adjacent to the altar, calculated <b>including the cubit of the base</b> of the altar <b>and the cubit of</b> its <b>ledge,</b> as the ramp continues and overlaps these two cubits at the top of the altar,"

        [
            "<b>or</b> are they <b>perhaps calculated excluding the cubit of the base</b> of the altar <b>and the cubit of</b> its <b>ledge?</b> The altar’s edge can be considered to be at the end of the ramp, the point at which it meets the altar, or it can be considered the point on the ramp that is directly over the external base of the altar, which is two cubits away from the point where the ramp meets the altar. Which of these two calculations is the correct one? Rav Pappa’s question remains unanswered, and the Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.",
            "§ It was taught in the mishna that <b>if both of them were equal</b> and neither preceded the other, <b>the appointed</b> priest <b>says</b> to all the priests: <b>Extend</b> your <b>fingers</b> [<b><i>hatzbiu</i></b>], and a lottery was performed. A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> the meaning of the unusual term <i>hatzbiu</i>: <b>Put out your fingers for a count.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Let him count</b> the priests <b>themselves</b> directly, rather than counting their fingers. The Gemara answers: This is <b>a support for</b> a teaching of <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, as Rabbi Yitzḥak said: It is prohibited to count Jews</b> directly, <b>even for the purposes of a mitzva, as it is written</b> concerning King Saul and his count of his soldiers: <b>“And he numbered them with <i>bezek</i>”</b> (I Samuel 11:8), meaning that he counted them through shards, one shard representing each man, rather than counting them directly.",
            "<b>Rav Ashi strongly objects to this</b> interpretation of the verse: <b>From where</b> do you derive <b>that this</b> word <b><i>bezek</i> is a term</b> related to the verb meaning <b>to break apart,</b> so that it means shards? <b>Perhaps it is the name of a town,</b> and it means that Saul counted them in Bezek, <b>as it is written: “And they found Adoni-bezek</b> in Bezek” (Judges 1:5), which shows that Bezek is the name of a place. The Gemara answers: Indeed, the proof is not from that verse <b>but from here,</b> where it says: <b>“And Saul summoned the people and numbered them by sheep”</b> (I Samuel 15:4), meaning that Saul tallied his soldiers by having each one take a sheep and put it aside to represent him in the count.",
            "<b>Rabbi Elazar said: Whoever counts</b> a group of <b>Jews violates a negative</b> mitzva, <b>as it is stated: “And the number of the children of Israel will be like the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured”</b> (Hosea 2:1). Rabbi Elazar interprets the verse to be saying: Which may not be measured. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> One who counts a group of Jews in fact <b>violates two negative</b> mitzvot, <b>as it is stated</b> in that verse: “Which <b>cannot be measured and cannot be counted”</b> (Hosea 2:1).",
            "<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan raised a contradiction: It is written</b> in this verse: <b>“And the number of the children of Israel will be like the sand of the sea,”</b> suggesting that they will have a specific number, though it will be very large. On the other hand, it continues and says: <b>“Which cannot be measured and cannot be counted,”</b> which means they will not be countable at all. How can these two statements be reconciled?",
            "It is <b>not difficult: Here,</b> in the second statement, it is referring to <b>a time when the Jewish people fulfill the will of God;</b> then they will be innumerable. <b>There,</b> in the first statement, it is referring to <b>a time when</b> the Jewish people <b>do not fulfill the will of God;</b> then they will be like the sand of the sea, having a specific number. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said</b> a different resolution <b>in the name of Abba Yosei ben Dostai:</b> It is <b>not difficult: Here,</b> in the second statement, it is referring to counting <b>by the hand of man;</b> the Jewish people will be too numerous to count by man. <b>There,</b> in the first statement, it is referring to counting <b>by the hand of God,</b> and He will find that they are like the number of the grains of the sand of the sea.",
            "<b>Rav Nehilai bar Idi said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Once a man is appointed as a leader of the community, he becomes wealthy.</b> This is derived from the verses cited above. <b>Initially, it is written</b> with regard to Saul: <b>“And he numbered them with <i>bezek</i>,”</b> meaning pottery shards, <b>and in the end it is written: “And he numbered them with sheep,”</b> indicating that he was able to provide enough of his own sheep to use them in counting the people. The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps</b> the people provided these sheep <b>from their own</b> flocks. The Gemara rejects this: <b>If so, what is the novelty in the matter?</b> Why would the text tell us that the people were counted with sheep if not to illustrate incidentally the great wealth of Saul?",
            "§ Having mentioned the verse about Saul, the Gemara proceeds to interpret more of that passage: “And Saul came to the city of Amalek <b>and he strove in the valley”</b> (I Samuel 15:5). <b>Rabbi Mani said:</b> This means that Saul strove with God, as it were, <b>concerning the matter of the valley. At the time when the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to</b> Saul: “Now <b>go and attack Amalek</b> and proscribe all that belongs to him; do not pity him, but kill men and women alike, infants and sucklings alike, oxen and sheep alike, camel and donkey alike” (I Samuel 15:3), Saul countered and <b>said: Now, if</b> on account of <b>one life</b> that is taken, in a case where a slain person’s body is found and the murderer is unknown, <b>the Torah said to bring a heifer whose neck is broken</b> to a barren valley, in the atonement ritual described in Deuteronomy 21:1–9, <b>all the more so</b> must I have pity and not take <b>all these</b> Amalekite <b>lives.</b>",
            "<b>And</b> he further reasoned: <b>If the men have sinned,</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>have the animals sinned?</b> Why, then, should the Amalekites’ livestock be destroyed? <b>And if the adults have sinned,</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>have the children sinned? A Divine Voice</b> then <b>came forth and said to him: “Do not be overly righteous”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:16). That is to say: Do not be more merciful than the Creator Himself, Who has commanded you to do this, for to do so would not be an indication of righteousness but of weakness. At a later time, <b>when Saul said to Doeg: “Turn around and strike down the priests,</b> and Doeg the Edomite turned around and struck down the priests, and he killed on that day eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod, and he struck Nob the city of priests by the sword, man and woman alike, infants and sucklings alike, oxen and donkeys and sheep, by the sword” (I Samuel 22:18–19), <b>a Divine Voice came forth and said to him: “Do not be overly wicked”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:17).",
            "Apropos Saul’s contravention of God’s command to obliterate Amalek, the Gemara observes that <b>Rav Huna said: How little does a person who has the support of his Lord have to worry or be concerned.</b> The proof for this assertion is a comparison between Saul and David. <b>Saul</b> failed <b>with one</b> single sin <b>and it was counted against him,</b> costing him the throne. <b>David,</b> however, failed <b>with two</b> sins <b>and</b> they were <b>not counted against him,</b> as he retained his position. The Gemara asks: <b>What was Saul’s one</b> sin? <b>The incident</b> with <b>Agag,</b> king of Amalek, whom Saul spared in defiance of God’s command (see I Samuel 15:9). <b>But</b> was this his sole sin? <b>There is</b> also <b>the incident of Nob, the city of priests,</b> in which Saul later slew many innocent people, as cited above. The Gemara answers: It was after <b>the incident</b> with <b>Agag,</b> and even before the incident at Nob, that God said: <b>“I regret that I have crowned Saul to be king”</b> (I Samuel 15:11).",
            "Rav Huna stated above that <b>David</b> failed <b>with two</b> sins. <b>What were they?</b> One was the incident in which he had <b>Uriah</b> killed. The other was the matter of <b>the incitement</b> of David to conduct a census of the Jewish people (see II Samuel 24:1), which led to many deaths in a plague.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> were these his only two sins? <b>There is also the incident of Bathsheba,</b> in which he took another man’s wife as his own. The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in that case, <b>punishment was exacted from him</b> separately, so the matter is no longer listed among his sins, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to this incident: <b>“And he shall restore the lamb fourfold”</b> (II Samuel 12:6). The lamb was a metaphor for Bathsheba, and ultimately David was indeed given a fourfold punishment for taking Bathsheba: The first <b>child</b> born to Bathsheba and David died (see II Samuel 12:13–23); David’s son <b>Amnon</b> was killed; <b>Tamar,</b> his daughter, was raped by Amnon (see II Samuel 13); <b>and</b> his son <b>Avshalom</b> rebelled against him and was ultimately killed (see II Samuel 15–18).",
            "The Gemara asks: If sins for which David was punished separately are not counted, one could ask: <b>There, too,</b> with regard to the sin of the census, <b>he was punished</b> separately, <b>as it is written: “And the Lord sent a plague against Israel from the morning until the appointed time”</b> (II Samuel 24:15). The Gemara responds: <b>There,</b> David <b>was not punished</b> personally, <b>in his</b> own <b>body;</b> rather, the punishment was inflicted on the Jewish people.",
            "The Gemara challenges this: <b>There, too,</b> in the incident with Bathsheba, David <b>was not punished</b> personally, <b>in his</b> own <b>body;</b> rather, it was his children who suffered punishment. The Gemara answers: That is <b>not so; he was punished</b> personally, <b>in his</b> own <b>body,</b> for that sin, as <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: David was stricken with leprosy</b> for <b>six months</b> after that incident, <b>and the Sanhedrin withdrew from him</b> in protest over his behavior, <b>and the Divine Presence</b> also <b>left him. As it is written</b> that David prayed: <b>“May those who fear You return to me, and they who know Your testimonies”</b> (Psalms 119:79). Since he prayed for the return of those who fear God and who know His testimonies, referring to the Sages of the Sanhedrin, it can be inferred that they had withdrawn from him. <b>And it is written</b> as well: <b>“Restore to me the joy of Your salvation,</b> let a vigorous spirit support me” (Psalms 51:14), where David asks for the return of the Divine Spirit, which had left him.",
            "The Gemara asks: And didn’t David commit other sins? <b>Didn’t Rav say: David accepted a slanderous report</b> from Ziba about Mephibosheth, son of Jonathan, stating that the latter was pleased with David’s downfall? There was, in that case, this additional sin. The Gemara responds: Consequently, it is necessary to follow the approach of <b>Shmuel, who said: David did not accept a slanderous report,</b> because Ziba’s claim was true.",
            "The Gemara continues: <b>And even</b> according <b>to Rav, who said that David accepted a slanderous report,</b> one could answer that that sin is not counted, as <b>was he not punished</b> for it? <b>As Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: At the time when David said to Mephibosheth: “I say that you and Ziba should divide the field”</b> (II Samuel 19:30), <b>a Divine Voice came forth and said to him: Rehoboam and Jeroboam will divide the kingship.</b> Because David believed Ziba’s slanderous report and awarded him half of Mephibosheth’s field, David was punished by having his kingdom divided into two. Following King Solomon’s death the Jewish people split into two kingdoms, Israel to the north and Judea to the south (see I Kings 12<b>)</b>. Therefore, David was punished for that sin too.",
            "§ The Gemara continues its discussion of Saul and David. It is written: <b>“Saul was one year old when he began to reign”</b> (I Samuel 13:1), which cannot be understood literally, as Saul was appointed king when he was a young man. <b>Rav Huna said:</b> The verse means that when he began to reign he was <b>like a one-year–old, in that he had never tasted the taste of sin</b> but was wholly innocent and upright.",
            "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak strongly objects to this</b> interpretation of the verse, saying: You could just as well <b>say</b> that he was <b>like a one-year-old</b> in that he was always <b>filthy with mud and excrement. Rav Naḥman was shown a frightful dream</b> that night, and he understood it as a punishment for having disparaged Saul. <b>He said: I humbly submit myself to you, O bones of Saul, son of Kish,</b> and beg your forgiveness. But <b>once again he was shown a frightful dream,</b> and he understood that he had not shown enough deference in his first apology. He therefore <b>said</b> this time: <b>I humbly submit myself to you, O bones of Saul, son of Kish, king of Israel,</b> and beg your forgiveness. Subsequently, the nightmares ceased.",
            "<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Why did the kingship of the house of Saul not continue</b> on to succeeding generations? It is <b>because there was no flaw</b> in his ancestry; he was of impeccable lineage. <b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak: One appoints a leader over the community only if he has a box</b> full <b>of creeping animals hanging behind him,</b> i.e., he has something inappropriate in his ancestry that preceded him. Why is that? It is <b>so that if he exhibits a haughty attitude toward the community, one can say to him: Turn</b> and look <b>behind you</b> and be reminded of your humble roots. This is why David’s kingdom lasted while Saul’s did not, as David descended from a family with problematic ancestry, namely Tamar (see Genesis, chapter 38) and Ruth the Moabite (see Ruth 4:18–22).",
            "<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: Why was Saul punished</b> in that he was ultimately led to commit the sins described above? <b>Because</b> at the very outset of his reign he inappropriately <b>forwent his</b> royal <b>honor, as it is stated</b> with regard to Saul’s inauguration: <b>“And some base fellows said: How can this man save us? So they disparaged him and brought him no present. But he made himself as if he did not hear”</b> (I Samuel 10:27). And it is stated immediately afterward: <b>“And Nahash the Ammonite marched up and encamped against Jabesh-gilead”</b> (I Samuel 11:1). The implication is that if Saul had forcefully assumed his throne, Nahash would not have dared to attack the people of Jabesh-gilead. In this way, his humility led to the crisis.",

The Gemara responds: <b>That</b> prohibition <b>is written with regard to monetary</b> matters and not personal insults, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is revenge and what is bearing a grudge?

            "§ The mishna describes that the lottery between competing priests is conducted by the priests extending their fingers for a count. And the mishna elaborated: <b>And what</b> fingers <b>do they extend</b> for the lottery? They may extend <b>one or two</b> fingers, and the priests do not extend a thumb in the Temple. The Gemara asks: <b>Now</b> that the mishna states that the priest may extend <b>two</b> fingers, is it <b>necessary</b> to state that they may also extend <b>one</b> finger?",
            "<b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> when the mishna speaks of extending one finger, it is referring to <b>a healthy person</b>, who has no difficulty extending just one finger without extending a second one. <b>There,</b> when the mishna mentions two fingers, it is referring to <b>a sick person,</b> for whom it is difficult to extend a single finger at a time. <b>And</b> so <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>They</b> may <b>extend one</b> finger, but <b>they</b> may <b>not extend two. In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said <b>in</b> reference to <b>a healthy person; however, a sick person</b> may <b>extend even two</b> fingers. <b>And</b> the sick priests who sit or lie <b>alone,</b> separately from the other priests, <b>extend two</b> fingers, <b>but</b> their two fingers are <b>counted only as one.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> are the sick priest’s two fingers really <b>counted as only one?

            "Jerusalem <b>does not bring a heifer whose neck is broken.</b> The reason for this is that the <i>halakha</i> of the heifer whose neck is broken applies only to land that was apportioned to a specific tribe of the Jewish people. Jerusalem alone was not divided among the tribes, but was shared equally by the entire nation. <b>And furthermore, it is written</b> that the heifer whose neck is broken is brought when <b>“it be not known who had smitten him,” and</b> here, in the case of the slain priest, <b>it was</b> well <b>known who had smitten him.

He said: May</b> my son’s death <b>be an atonement for you.</b> But <b>my son is still alive,</b> etc. This incident comes <b>to teach you that the ritual purity of utensils</b> was <b>of more concern to them than the shedding of blood.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an answer to the dilemma: Since the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>adduces a biblical teaching</b> from the verse, <b>“Furthermore, Manasseh spilled innocent blood,” conclude from this</b> that <b>it was bloodshed that had become trivialized, and</b> the importance of <b>purity of utensils remained where it had been.</b>",
            "§ The Gemara returns to the mitzva of removing the ashes from the altar and associated issues. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah states, after describing the removal of the ashes: <b>“And he shall put off</b> his garments, <b>and put on other garments, and carry the ashes out</b> of the camp to a clean place” (Leviticus 6:4). <b>I</b> might <b>understand</b> from here that this change of garments is a mitzva to change into a different kind of garment, <b>similar to</b> the change of garments performed on <b>Yom Kippur,</b> when the High Priest changes back and forth from gold clothes to white clothes. Here, too, the Torah requires <b>that he remove his sacred garments and put on non-sacred garments.</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: To teach us otherwise, <b>the verse states: “And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments,”</b> thereby <b>juxtaposing the garments he puts on to the garments he takes off.</b> This indicates that <b>just as there,</b> the garments he removes, i.e., those in which he had performed the mitzva of removal of the ashes, are <b>sacred garments, so too here,</b> the clothes he puts on to take the ashes out of the camp are <b>sacred garments.</b>",
            "<b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: Other</b> garments, which implies that the second set of garments is different from the first? It means they are <b>of lower quality than</b> the first set of garments. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says</b> a different interpretation of the words: Other garments. The verse states: “And put on <b>other</b> garments, <b>and carry</b> the ashes <b>out</b> of the camp,” in which the Hebrew juxtaposes the words “other” and “carry out.” This <b>teaches that priests with</b> physical <b>blemishes,</b> who are considered others in that they are not eligible to perform sacred tasks, <b>are eligible to carry out the ashes.</b>",
            "The Gemara now explains the <i>baraita</i> in detail. <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: The words: <b>Other</b> garments, teach that they are to be <b>of lower quality than</b> the garments worn during the removal of the ashes.

Similarly, one who performs the dirtying task of carrying out the ashes should not wear the same fine clothes worn to perform other services.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> taught that Rabbi Eliezer derived from the word other that blemished priests are eligible for the task of carrying out the ashes, while the first <i>tanna</i> derived a different teaching from those words. The Gemara clarifies the scope of the dispute between the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Eliezer. <b>Reish Lakish said: Just as</b> there is <b>a dispute</b> between Rabbi Eliezer and the first <i>tanna</i> <b>with regard to carrying</b> the ashes <b>out</b> of the camp, <b>so too, there is a dispute with regard to the removal of the ashes</b> from the altar. Rabbi Eliezer maintains that the removal of the ashes may also be performed by blemished priests, while the first <i>tanna</i> disagrees. <b>But Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The <b>dispute</b> is only <b>with regard to carrying</b> the ashes <b>out</b> of the camp, <b>but all agree that the removal</b> of the ashes <b>is a</b> bona fide Temple <b>service</b> that cannot be performed by blemished priests.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason behind</b> the opinion <b>of Reish Lakish?</b> Reish Lakish could have <b>said to you: If it enters your mind</b> that the removal of the ashes <b>is a</b> bona fide Temple <b>service,</b> you are faced with the following difficulty: <b>Do you have</b> any Temple <b>service that may be performed with</b> only <b>two garments</b> rather than the full set of four vestments worn by the priests? In the Torah’s description of the garments worn to remove the ashes it says: “And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen trousers shall he put on his flesh” (Leviticus 6:3).",
            "<b>And</b> what is the explanation for <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan’s</b> opinion? In fact, the priest is required to wear all four priestly garments. <b>The Merciful One reveals</b> in the Torah that the priest must wear <b>the tunic and the trousers</b> like any other service so that one would not think that taking out the ashes may be performed in regular, non-sacred clothes. Once the Torah has made this point and mentioned these two specific garments, <b>the same is true</b> for the other two garments as well, i.e., <b>the mitre and the belt.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: If the Torah requires all four garments and mentions the tunic and trousers only as examples, <b>what is different about these</b> two that the Torah mentioned them in particular? The Gemara answers that these two particular garments were mentioned in order to teach certain <i>halakhot</i>. The Torah refers to the tunic as <b>“his linen garment,”</b> with the words <b>“his garment” [<i>middo</i>],</b> indicating that the tunic must conform <b>to his</b> exact <b>size [<i>middato</i>]</b> and should fit the priest perfectly. As for the words <b>“linen trousers,”</b> they come to teach <b>that which was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> as the priest gets dressed <b>no</b> garment <b>should precede the trousers? As it is stated: “And his linen trousers shall he put on his flesh,”</b> which implies that the trousers should be donned when the priest has nothing but his flesh, i.e., when he has no other garments on him yet.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>Reish Lakish,</b> who maintains that these two garments are mentioned because they are the only two that the priest wears when removing the ashes, from where does he derive these two <i>halakhot</i>? The Gemara answers: The <i>halakha</i> that <b>his</b> linen <b>garment,</b> i.e., the tunic, must be <b>according to his size</b> is derived the fact that <b>the Merciful One uses the expression “his garment,”</b> i.e., his fitted garment, in the Torah, rather than calling it by its usual name, tunic. And the <i>halakha</i> <b>that no</b> garment <b>should precede the trousers</b> when the priest dresses is <b>derived</b> from the fact that the Torah added the phrase <b>“on his flesh.”</b>",
            "<b>Let us say</b> that the dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b> As it was taught in a <i>baraita</i> that the Torah states: “And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen trousers shall he put on his flesh” (Leviticus 6:3). The words “shall he put on” seem superfluous, since these same words were already stated earlier in the verse. Therefore, the Torah could have sufficed with saying: “And linen trousers <b>on his flesh.” What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Shall he put on”?</b> This extra expression comes <b>to include</b> the donning of the <b>mitre and</b> the <b>belt,</b> which are not mentioned here explicitly, for <b>the removal</b> of the ash; this is the statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Dosa says:</b> The extra expression comes <b>to include the</b> permissibility of the <b>High Priest’s clothes</b> that he wears <b>on Yom Kippur,</b> which are linen garments identical to those of the common priest, to teach that <b>they are acceptable</b> to be used afterward by <b>common priests</b> in their service. In other words, the expression teaches that the High Priest’s garments need not be permanently retired from service after Yom Kippur, unlike the opinion of another Sage, as will be explained below.",
            "<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: There are two refutations</b> against Rabbi Dosa’s interpretation: <b>One</b> is that <b>the belt of</b> the <b>High Priest</b> that he wears on Yom Kippur is made only of linen and <b>is not</b> identical to <b>the belt of</b> the <b>common priest,</b> which, in Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion, is made of wool and linen.

With regard to the garments of the High Priest, the Torah states: “And Aaron shall go into the tent of meeting, and he shall take off the linen garments that he had put on when he went into the Sanctuary, <b>and shall leave them there”</b> (Leviticus 16:23). This verse <b>teaches that</b> the linen garments worn by the High Priest during the Yom Kippur service <b>require storing away,</b> i.e., they may not be used again. <b>Rabbi Dosa says:</b> They do not have to be stored away, because although they may not be used again by the High Priest on a subsequent Yom Kippur, <b>they are acceptable</b> for use <b>for a common priest.

It means <b>that</b> the High Priest himself <b>may not use them</b> on a <b>subsequent Yom Kippur</b> for service in the Holy of Holies; it does not mean that they may not be used at all.",
            "The Gemara returns to the question of whether or not the removal of the ashes is considered a bona fide Temple service, requiring all four priestly garments, and whether or not this is the subject of debate between <i>tanna’im</i>. <b>What, is it not with regard to this that</b> Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Dosa <b>disagree: One Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, who derives from the phrase “he shall wear” that all four garments are required, <b>holds</b> that the removal of the ashes <b>is a</b> bona fide <b>service; and one Sage,</b> Rabbi Dosa, who derives a different teaching from “he shall wear,” <b>holds</b> that <b>it is not a</b> bona fide <b>service,</b> and consequently only two of the four garments are required?

            "§ <b>Rabbi Avin raised a dilemma: How much</b> ash must be removed in order to fulfill the mitzva of <b>removal of the ashes?

            "§ <b>Rav said:</b> Although a non-priest may not perform any Temple service, <b>there are</b> only <b>four</b> Temple <b>services</b> for which <b>a non-priest is liable to</b> receive the punishment of <b>death</b> by God’s hand for doing so.

And similarly, Levi taught in his</b> collection of <b><i>baraitot</i>: The removal of ashes</b> is <b>also</b> included among those services for which a non-priest incurs the death penalty if he performs them.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason for Rav’s</b> opinion? <b>As it is written: “And you and your sons with you shall keep your priesthood in everything pertaining to the altar and to that within the veil; and you shall serve; I give you the priesthood as a service of gift; and the common man that draws near shall be put to death”</b> (Numbers 18:7). Rav interprets this verse as follows: <b>“A service of gift”</b> indicates a service that involves giving, i.e., placing something on the altar, <b>and not a service</b> that involves <b>removal</b> from the altar, to the exclusion of removing the ashes. <b>“And you shall serve [<i>va’avadtem</i>]”</b> is interpreted as referring to <b>a service that is complete [<i>avoda tamma</i>]</b> on its own, such as sprinkling the blood, <b>and not</b> a service that is not complete, i.e., <b>a service that</b> is only a preparatory step and <b>has another service after it</b> that completes its purpose, such as slaughtering the animal or collecting its blood, which are only preparatory steps leading up to the sprinkling of the blood on the altar.",
            "<b>And</b> what is the reason for the opinion of <b>Levi?</b> Why does he include the removal of ashes? According to him, <b>the Merciful One includes</b> this service by adding <b>“in everything pertaining to the altar,”</b> which teaches that all actions performed on the altar, including the removal of ashes, are significant and are prohibited to a non-priest on pain of death. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what does <b>Rav</b> learn from the phrase “in everything pertaining to the altar”? The Gemara answers: According to him, the word “everything” in <b>that</b> phrase comes <b>to include the seven sprinklings that are</b> performed <b>inside</b> the Sanctuary, when the blood of certain offerings is sprinkled on the veil of the Holy of Holies, <b>and</b> the seven sprinklings of oil <b>of the leper,</b> which are also performed inside the Sanctuary. Rav learns from the word “everything” that if a non-priest were to perform any of these actions he would be liable to receive the death penalty, despite the fact that they are not performed on the altar.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> from where does <b>Levi</b> derive these cases? The Gemara answers: <b>He derives</b> them <b>from</b> the superfluous wording of the text. As the entire phrase <b>“pertaining</b> to the altar” is superfluous, he derives from this the inclusion of the removal of the ashes. Additionally, the expression <b>“everything pertaining”</b> implies a further inclusion, from which he derives the internal sprinklings mentioned above. <b>And</b> what does <b>Rav</b> learn from this superfluous wording? Rav does <b>not derive</b> anything particular from the distinction between the expressions <b>“pertaining</b> to the altar” and <b>“everything pertaining</b> to the altar.”",
            "The Gemara asks about Levi’s position: <b>But say</b> that the verse should be interpreted as follows: <b>“In everything pertaining”</b> is a <b>generalization,</b> and <b>“a service of gift”</b> is a <b>specification,</b> indicating a case of <b>a generalization</b> followed by <b>a specification.</b> One of the principles of hermeneutics states that in such cases, <b>the generalization includes only what</b> is mentioned explicitly <b>in the specification.</b> Following that rule, one would conclude: <b>A service of giving,</b> i.e., placing on the altar, <b>yes,</b> this is included, but <b>a service of removal</b> is <b>not</b> included.

            "The Gemara answers: The phrase: “<b>And you shall serve [<i>va’avadtem</i>],”</b> which begins with the conjunction <i>vav</i>, meaning: And, indicates that <b>the verse goes back and combines</b> the service performed within the veil to services performed outside of it.

            "The Gemara explains the two approaches. <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> The priests were dressed in <b>non-sacred garments, because if you say</b> the lottery was to be held when they were dressed in their <b>sacred garments, there are</b> strong-<b>armed men who might act with force and perform the service</b> even if they did not win the lottery.

            "The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>The</b> tasks of carrying the <b>coal pan and</b> burning the <b>incense are different, because</b> together <b>they are</b> considered as <b>a single service,</b> so that a single lottery determined the participants for the two tasks.",
            "<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that this <i>baraita</i> was brought to derive the opposite conclusion: It was <b>specifically</b> concerning the case of carrying <b>the coal pan and</b> burning <b>the incense, which are</b> considered as two parts of <b>one</b> and the same <b>service,</b> that Rabbi Yehuda said one lottery can be used to assign the two tasks. <b>However,</b> the implication is that <b>other services,</b> which are not interrelated in this manner, <b>require a lottery</b> for each and every separate task.

            "This argument is rejected: That is not a proof that other services require their own lotteries. The reason Rabbi Yehuda mentioned this specific example is that <b>it was necessary for him</b> to teach explicitly that the coal pan and the burning of the incense do not have separate lotteries but a single, combined lottery. It might <b>have entered your mind to say that since</b> the burning of incense <b>is infrequent,</b> being performed only twice a day, unlike other offerings, which may be donated by private individuals and brought many times a day, <b>and</b> also since <b>it brings about wealth</b> for whoever performs it, as the Gemara teaches later, <b>we should institute a</b> separate <b>lottery for</b> bringing in the coal pan <b>itself,</b> as many priests wished to perform this task. Therefore, Rabbi Yehuda <b>teaches us</b> that despite this, the bringing in of the coal pan does not have its own lottery. Consequently, there is no proof either way from this <i>baraita</i>.",

            "§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>The second lottery</b> determines who slaughters, who sprinkles the blood, etc. The task of collecting the blood in a vessel, which is between slaughtering and sprinkling, is not mentioned.

Is it the one who <b>slaughters</b> the offering who also <b>collects</b> the blood? The reason to support this conclusion is <b>that if you say</b> that the one who <b>sprinkles</b> the blood is the one who <b>collects</b> it, a situation might arise in which, <b>due to</b> his enthusiasm and <b>his love</b> for the mitzva of sprinkling, a service that is considered more important than collecting because it directly involves the altar, the priest might <b>not collect all the blood</b> as the <i>halakha</i> requires but would hurry to go on and sprinkle it after he has collected only some of the blood.",
            "<b>Or perhaps</b> one should draw the opposite conclusion, that it is the one who <b>sprinkles</b> that <b>collects</b> the blood, <b>as, if you say</b> that the one who <b>slaughters</b> is the one who <b>collects,</b> this principle could not be universally applied, as <b>sometimes a non-priest slaughters</b> the offering. Slaughtering offerings is not a sacred service and may be performed by anyone, unlike the collection of the blood, which is performed by a priest. In those cases when a non-priest slaughtered the daily offering, he would not be able to collect the blood.",
            "The Gemara cites a source as evidence for one side of the argument: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> from that which was taught in a mishna: <b>Ben Katin made twelve spigots for the</b> large <b>laver</b> to replace the original two spouts that were there, <b>so that his twelve fellow priests who were engaged in</b> the sacrifice of <b>the daily offering could</b> all <b>sanctify their hands and feet at one time.</b> Although there are thirteen participants listed in the mishna, the slaughterer of the offering was not required to sanctify his hands and feet because, as mentioned above, slaughtering is not a sacred service.

            "<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the daily afternoon offering requires</b> that <b>two logs</b> be brought along with it, and that they must be brought <b>by two priests? As it is stated</b> with regard to the burnt-offering: “The sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar <b>and lay out wood</b> [<b><i>etzim</i></b>] in order upon the fire” (Leviticus 1:7). The word <i>etzim</i> is plural, which teaches that two logs are called for. <b>If this is not applicable to the daily morning offering, as it is</b> already <b>written about</b> the morning offering explicitly: <b>“And the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and arrange</b> the burnt-offering <b>on it”</b> (Leviticus 6:5), <b>apply it to the daily afternoon offering.</b> The verse therefore teaches us that two logs should be added before that offering.",

In other words, perhaps the Torah’s intention is that two logs be arranged on the altar twice in the morning, and that accounts for the two verses. The Gemara rejects this possibility: <b>If</b> it were <b>so,</b> the text <b>should</b> use the same expression both times and <b>say: “And he shall burn</b> wood on it,” and again: <b>“And he shall burn</b> wood on it.” Since the text does not do so, but instead employs two different verbs, saying: “They shall lay out wood” once and: “He shall burn wood” the second time, this indicates that the Torah is describing two different times.",

The <i>baraita</i>, which does assign this task to a seventeenth priest, is therefore not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov. As the Gemara explained earlier, the opinions of Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov are mutually exclusive; consequently, since the <i>baraita</i> contradicts the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, it must be in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda.

        ],
        [
            "The Gemara asks: But <b>that</b> verse about putting fire on the altar <b>is needed for its own sake,</b> to teach that the wood must be brought by a priest; it should not be interpreted as an inference that other services, such as flaying and cutting, may be performed by non-priests. <b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi said: I found Abaye explaining</b> Hizkiya’s derivation <b>to his son</b> based on the following <i>baraita</i>. It is written: <b>“And he shall slaughter</b> the bull before the Lord” (Leviticus 1:5), with no mention of a priest, which teaches that <b>slaughter by a non-priest is acceptable.</b> The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Now, from where would you come</b> to think otherwise? Why would one even suspect that a priest should be required to slaughter the offering, so that a specific verse is required to tell us otherwise? <b>From the fact that it is stated: “And you and your sons with you shall keep your priesthood”</b> (Numbers 18:7), <b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> that no part of the sacrificial service may be performed by a non-priest, not <b>even slaughtering.</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And he shall slaughter the bull before the Lord, and the sons of Aaron…shall sacrifice the blood”</b> (Leviticus 1:5), from which it is inferred that <b>from the</b> sacrificing of blood, which begins with the <b>collection</b> of the blood, <b>and onward is a mitzva</b> exclusively <b>of priesthood.</b> Just prior to this the Torah states: <b>“And he shall place his hands</b> upon the head of the burnt-offering…<b>and he shall slaughter</b> the bull before the Lord” (Leviticus 1:4–5). In this verse the Torah is referring to the donor of the offering when it says: He shall place his hands, and therefore when it continues: And he shall slaughter, it is also referring to the donor. The Torah thereby <b>taught</b> that <b>the slaughter</b> of the offering <b>is acceptable</b> if performed <b>by a non-priest.</b>",
            "Abaye asked: <b>Since,</b> as this <i>baraita</i> establishes, <b>from the collection</b> of the blood <b>and onward is a mitzva</b> exclusively <b>of priesthood, why do I</b> need the Torah to say afterward: <b>“The sons of Aaron shall put</b> fire on the altar” (Leviticus 1:7)? Since the verse about putting the fire on the altar follows the verse about collection of blood, it is clear that it must be done by priests, and the verse’s stipulation of this fact appears superfluous. This is why Ḥizkiya concluded that the verse is not required for its own sake but is needed to teach the following inference: It is only the placing of fire on the altar that requires priests, <b>to the exclusion of flaying and cutting up</b> the animal, which may be performed by a non-priest.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But still,</b> the verse about the placement of wood by priests <b>is necessary</b> for its own sake. As <b>it might have entered your mind to say</b> that <b>since</b> placing the wood is <b>not a service that is indispensable</b> for obtaining <b>atonement,</b> as atonement is achieved solely through the blood of the offering, it should <b>not be required</b> to be performed by <b>priests.</b> And one might have thought that the principle that all tasks from the collection of the blood and onward require a priest applies only to services relating to the blood. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that nevertheless, <b>priesthood is required.</b> Consequently, it cannot be asserted that the verse is written for the purpose of excluding other services.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> Hizkiya’s derivation must be rejected, and the acceptability of non-priests for flaying and cutting the animal must be learned <b>from here:</b> It is written: <b>“And Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall lay out the pieces, the head and the fat”</b> (Leviticus 1:8). <b>Since,</b> as the <i>baraita</i> above establishes, <b>from the collection</b> of the blood <b>and onward is a mitzva</b> exclusively <b>of priesthood, why do I</b> need the verse to specify: <b>“And</b> Aaron’s sons <b>shall lay out</b> the pieces”? Since the specification of priesthood here appears superfluous, one must conclude that it is written not for its own sake but <b>to exclude flaying and cutting up</b> the animal, to teach that those acts need not be performed by a priest.",
            "The Gemara asks: Granted, the verse comes to convey the inference that another act does not require priesthood, <b>but say</b> that it comes <b>to exclude the arrangement of the two logs,</b> to teach that this activity may be done by a non-priest. The Gemara rejects this: <b>It is</b> more <b>reasonable</b> that the verse, which deals with laying out the pieces of the offering on the altar, would <b>exclude a service</b> that is <b>similar to itself,</b> i.e., something related to the body of the sacrificial animal, such as flaying it and cutting it up, rather than the arrangement of the wood, which is not related to the animal itself.",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>On the contrary,</b> one should say that <b>it excludes</b> something relevant to <b>arrangement,</b> i.e., the placement of the logs, <b>which is similar</b> to the laying of the pieces of the offering in that both pertain to the placement of an item on the altar. Perhaps, then, the verse is coming to convey the inference that the arrangement of the logs, unlike the arrangement of the pieces of the offering, may be performed by a non-priest.",
            "The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>It cannot enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as the Master said:</b> After mentioning the mitzva to collect the blood, the Torah states: <b>“And the priest shall bring all of it near and burn it on the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:13), where bringing near is referring to <b>carrying the limbs to the ramp.</b> The specification of priesthood in this verse is not required for its own sake, since all services following the collection of blood require priesthood. Therefore, it must be that it comes to convey the inference that <b>it is</b> only <b>carrying the limbs to the ramp that requires priesthood,</b> but <b>carrying wood</b> to the altar <b>does not require priesthood. This,</b> in turn, implies that <b>the</b> actual <b>arrangement of the two logs,</b> which was not excluded, <b>does require priesthood.</b>",
            "The Gemara returns to the derivation presented above, where the question was raised: <b>Why do I</b> need the words <b>“and</b> Aaron’s sons <b>shall lay out</b> the pieces”? The conclusion was that the specification of priesthood here comes <b>to exclude flaying and cutting up</b> the animal, to teach that these acts may be performed by a non-priest. The Gemara now rejects this derivation: <b>But say that this</b> verse <b>too is</b> necessary <b>for its own sake,</b> to teach the lesson that the Gemara will shortly derive from these words (Maharsha), and one can no longer assert that the verse comes solely for the purpose of conveying the inference that other, similar acts, i.e., flaying and cutting up the animal, do not require priesthood.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> this derivation must be rejected as well, and another verse must be found from which to prove that non-priests may flay and cut up the animal. The Torah states: <b>“And the priest shall burn all of it on the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:9). Since this is an act following the collection of the blood, the specification of priesthood is not needed for its own sake. Therefore, <b>for what</b> purpose does that verse <b>come?</b> It comes <b>to exclude flaying and cutting up</b> the animal, which may be performed by a non-priest.",
            "The Gemara reviews the lessons taught by the other verses cited above. When the Torah writes: <b>“The priest shall bring all of it near…the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:13), <b>this</b> is referring to <b>carrying the limbs to the ramp,</b> and the verse comes to exclude other, similar actions, teaching that although <b>carrying the limbs to the ramp requires priesthood, carrying wood</b> to the altar <b>does not require priesthood. Therefore,</b> it is derived from here as well that the <b>arrangement of the two logs does require priesthood,</b> as explained above. And when the Torah writes: “The sons of Aaron <b>shall put</b> fire on the altar” (Leviticus 1:7), this is necessary <b>for its own sake,</b> to teach that this service must be done by priests.",
            "When the Torah states: “And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall lay out the pieces, the head and the fat” (Leviticus 1:8), it comes to teach the following: <b>“And they shall lay out,”</b> through the use of the plural, teaches that it must be done by <b>two</b> priests, as the minimum number implied by a plural word is two. <b>“The sons of Aaron,”</b> also in plural, indicates an additional <b>two; “the priests,”</b> also in plural, indicates <b>two</b> more. <b>We</b> therefore <b>learn</b> from this verse <b>that</b> the sacrificial <b>lamb requires six</b> priests to carry its limbs to the altar. The flesh is taken by five priests, and the innards by one, as described in an earlier mishna.",
            "<b>Rav Hamnuna said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar posed a difficulty: This</b> verse <b>is written</b> about a young bull, not a lamb; and a <b>bull requires twenty-four</b> priests.

And <b>he resolved</b> the difficulty himself as follows: The same verse states: <b>“On the wood that is on the fire upon the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:8), all of which apparently teaches nothing new about the sacrifice. Therefore, it is seen as an allusion to the daily offering, which was a lamb, as <b>what is an item about which it is stated that</b> specially prepared <b>wood and fire</b> on an <b>altar</b> must be provided, and that pre-existing wood and fire do not suffice?"

            "§ <b>Rabbi Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A non-priest who set up the arrangement of wood</b> on the altar <b>is liable</b> to receive the death penalty by God’s hand for having performed an act that is restricted to priests, and the woodpile that he placed is invalid. <b>What should he do</b> to repair the woodpile? <b>He</b> should <b>dismantle it and then rearrange it.</b> The Gemara is surprised at this: <b>What good would this do for</b> the woodpile? How would it help for the non-priest himself to rearrange the wood? It would be just as invalid as it was the first time. <b>Rather,</b> one must say that the <b>non-priest</b> should <b>dismantle</b> it, as there is nothing wrong with a non-priest dismantling the woodpile, <b>and a priest</b> then <b>rearranges it.</b>",

That the wood on the altar may be arranged while it is still nighttime shows that it is not a bona fide service, and therefore it should be permitted for non-priests to perform it.",
            "The Gemara expresses wonder at Rabbi Zeira’s equation of the two issues: <b>And</b> is there really <b>no</b> such thing as a service that may be performed at night but which is prohibited for a non-priest to perform? <b>Isn’t there</b> the burning <b>of the limbs and the fats</b> of offerings on the altar, which continues throughout the night, and yet it was taught earlier in this chapter that a non-priest who participates in that service incurs the death penalty? The Gemara rejects this objection: The burning of sacrificial limbs and fats, though it may be done at night, is not considered a nighttime service but <b>the end of the daytime service,</b> as it is merely the culmination of the sacrificial service that began during the day.",
            "The Gemara asks further: <b>But isn’t there the removal of the ashes</b> from the altar, which may be performed at night, and yet may not be done by a non-priest? The Gemara rejects this too: The removal of ashes is also not considered a nighttime service but <b>the start of the daytime service.</b> And the proof for this is <b>that Rabbi Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> If a priest has <b>sanctified his hands</b> at night by washing them <b>for the removal of the ashes, the next day,</b> i.e., after daybreak, <b>he need not sanctify</b> his hands again, <b>as he already sanctified</b> them <b>at the start of the service.</b> Rabbi Zeira’s equation between services performed at night and services that may be performed by non-priests therefore remains intact. <b>If so,</b> the objection that he raised to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan remains <b>difficult.</b>",
            "<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement must be revised, and one must posit that <b>when it was stated, this is how it was stated. Rabbi Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A non-priest who arranges the two logs</b> on the altar <b>is liable</b> to receive the death penalty by God’s hand, <b>since it is a daytime service. Rava strongly objects to this: But if</b> that is <b>so,</b> if arranging the two logs is a bona fide daytime service and is prohibited to non-priests on pain of death, it <b>should require a lottery;</b> and yet in practice this service is not assigned by a lottery. The Gemara comments that <b>it must have escaped</b> Rava’s mind <b>that which is taught</b> explicitly in a <i>baraita</i>: The priest <b>who was privileged to</b> perform the <b>removal of the ashes was</b> also <b>privileged with setting up the arrangement of wood</b> on the altar and with placing the <b>two logs.</b>",
            "Another difficulty is raised with regard to Rava’s statement: <b>Is that to say that a daytime service requires a lottery</b> and, conversely, <b>a nighttime service does not require a lottery?

The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there the removal of the ashes</b> from the altar, which is a nighttime service and yet requires a lottery? The Gemara answers: Indeed, a lottery should not have been required for that service, but one was instituted <b>due to the incident that occurred,</b> when the priests came to danger, as related in the mishna.",
            "The Gemara asks further: <b>Is that to say that</b> any service that is a <b>daytime service and</b> for which <b>a non-priest</b> would be <b>liable</b> to receive <b>the death penalty requires a lottery,</b> and conversely, a daytime service for which <b>a non-priest</b> would <b>not</b> be <b>liable</b> to receive <b>the death penalty does not require a lottery? But isn’t there</b> the <b>slaughtering</b> of the daily offering, which may be performed by a non-priest and yet requires a lottery? The Gemara rejects this point: <b>Slaughtering is different,</b> because <b>it is the beginning of the service</b> of the daily offering and is therefore considered important enough to warrant a lottery.",
            "The Gemara asks with regard to the revised version of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement: <b>Mar Zutra, and some say Rav Ashi, said: But didn’t we learn</b> that <b>it is not so</b> that arranging the logs must be done during the day, as it was taught in a mishna: <b>The appointed</b> priest <b>said to them: Go out and see if the time for slaughtering has arrived.</b> The mishna <b>does not teach</b> that the appointee said: Go and see if <b>the time for</b> arranging <b>the two logs</b> has arrived. This shows that the logs need not be placed after daybreak but may be arranged while it is still night.",
            "The Gemara rejects this argument: The reason the mishna mentions slaughtering is that it prefers to <b>teach</b> this statement with regard to <b>that which has no rectification</b> if it is done at night, such as slaughtering the offering, which is rendered irreparably invalid if done before daybreak. <b>It does not</b> want to <b>teach something that has rectification</b> if done at night, such as arranging the two logs, which can always be removed and replaced properly. However, the proper time for arranging the logs is indeed daytime.",
            "<b>And some say</b> a different version of Rabbi Zeira’s objection: <b>Rabbi Zeira strongly objects to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement that a non-priest who arranged the woodpile incurs the death penalty: <b>And do you have any service that is</b> not complete on its own but is <b>followed by a different service,</b> such as the arrangement of the two logs, <b>and</b> yet is <b>invalid</b> and is punishable by death if performed <b>by a non-priest?</b> It was taught earlier in the chapter that a non-priest incurs the death penalty only for performing a service that is complete, i.e., a service that is not followed by other services that complete the task being performed."

            "The Gemara expresses wonder at Rabbi Zeira’s equation of these two issues: <b>But isn’t there</b> the burning of <b>the limbs and the fats?</b> The Gemara answers: That is not difficult, because the burning of the limbs and the fats <b>is the end of the daytime service.</b> The Gemara asks further: <b>But isn’t there the removal of the ashes?</b> The Gemara rejects that argument: Removing the ashes is <b>the start of the daytime service,</b> as <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> If a priest <b>sanctified his hands</b> at night by washing them <b>for the removal of the ashes, the next day,</b> i.e., after daybreak, <b>he need not sanctify</b> his hands again, <b>as he already sanctified</b> them <b>at the start of the service.</b> Rabbi Zeira’s equation between services that are incomplete by themselves and services for which a non-priest does not incur the death penalty therefore remains intact. <b>If so,</b> the question that he asked concerning Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement remains <b>difficult.</b>",
            "<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement must be revised, and one must posit that <b>when it was stated, this is how it was stated: Rabbi Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A non-priest who arranges the two logs is liable</b> to receive the death penalty, <b>since it is a service that is complete,</b> i.e., it is not followed and completed by a subsequent service. Although the burning of the limbs upon the altar follows the placement of the logs, that is considered to be an independent act, not the completion of the service of placing the logs. This is because the placing of the logs is done while still night, while the burning of the limbs cannot be done until daybreak.",
            "<b>Rava strongly objects to this: However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> the service of placing the two logs <b>should require a lottery.</b> The Gemara expresses surprise at Rava’s comment: <b>And doesn’t it require a lottery? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Whoever was privileged</b> to perform the <b>removal of the ashes</b> is <b>also privileged</b> to perform the <b>arrangement of the two logs?</b> There was in fact a lottery for arranging the two logs.",
            "Rather, <b>this is what</b> Rava actually <b>said:</b> If placing the logs is considered a complete service and is therefore a task important enough to warrant the death penalty for a non-priest who performs it, <b>they</b> should <b>hold a</b> separate <b>lottery for it by itself.</b> The Gemara answers: It is <b>as we said</b> at the beginning of the chapter, that the task of placing the logs was added to the lottery for the removal of ashes as an incentive for the priests to rise before dawn (Rabbeinu Ḥananel).",
            "Based on Rava’s comments, the Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that</b> any service that is <b>a complete service and</b> for which <b>a non-priest</b> would be <b>liable</b> to receive <b>the death penalty requires a lottery,</b> but if <b>a non-priest</b> would <b>not</b> be <b>liable</b> to receive <b>the death penalty it would not require a lottery? But isn’t there slaughtering,</b> which may be performed by non-priest and yet requires a lottery? The Gemara rejects this point: <b>Slaughtering is different,</b> because <b>it is the beginning of the daytime service,</b> which gives it added importance.",
            "The Gemara asks further on Rava’s statement: <b>Is that to say that a service that is complete requires a lottery,</b> whereas <b>a service which is followed by a</b> subsequent <b>service</b> that completes it <b>does not require a lottery? But isn’t there</b> the burning of <b>the limbs and the fats?</b> The Gemara answers: That is not difficult because the burning of the limbs and the fats <b>is the end of the daytime service.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t there the removal of the ashes?</b> The Gemara answers: A lottery was established for that service only <b>due to the incident that occurred</b> when the priests came to danger.",
            "As explained above, the reason Rabbi Yoḥanan holds that the arrangement of the logs is a complete service, and is not considered a prelude to the burning of limbs, is because the former is a nighttime service and the latter is a daytime service. <b>Mar Zutra, and some say Rav Ashi, said: We too have learned</b> in a mishna that the arrangement of the two logs is a nighttime service. As we learned: <b>The appointed</b> priest <b>said to them: Go out and see if the time for slaughtering has arrived, whereas</b> the mishna <b>did not teach:</b> See whether <b>the time for arranging the two logs</b> has arrived. This shows that arranging the logs may be done while it is still night; it is therefore not considered to be connected to, and complemented by, the placing of the limbs the following day.",
            "The Gemara rejects this proof: The reason the mishna mentions slaughtering is that it prefers to <b>teach</b> this statement with regard to <b>that which has no rectification</b> if it is done at night, such as slaughtering the offering, which is rendered irreparably invalid if performed before daybreak. <b>It does not</b> want to <b>teach</b> it with regard to <b>something that has rectification</b> if done at night, such as arranging the two logs, which can always be removed and replaced properly. However, it is possible that the proper time for arranging the logs is daytime, and therefore it may be regarded as a service that is completed by the subsequent burning of limbs on the altar.",

Now, if indeed this <i>halakha</i> is derived from the conduct of Abraham, <b>let us slaughter</b> the offering even earlier, <b>from when the walls</b> begin to <b>blacken,</b> just after the end of the sixth hour of the day.

            "The Gemara rejects this: <b>What is the difficulty?</b> <br><b>Perhaps the walls of the Temple</b> begin to <b>blacken</b> only <b>at six and a half</b> hours of the day <b>because they are not perfectly aligned.</b> The Temple walls were broad at the bottom and gradually narrowed as they reached the top; therefore, the upper part of the wall did not cast a shadow on the wall opposite it until six and a half hours of the day. <br><b>Or, alternatively,</b> it is <b>different</b> with regard to <b>Abraham</b> because <b>there was great</b> knowledge of <b>astronomy [<i>itztagninut</i>] in his heart.</b> He was able to precisely calculate the movements of the heavenly bodies and was therefore able to discern immediately after noon that the sun had begun its descent. Others require a half hour to be certain that the descent of the sun has begun. <br><b>Or, alternatively</b> Abraham was different <b>because he was an Elder and sat</b> and studied Torah <b>in a yeshiva,</b> where the Divine Presence rests. There he developed the expertise to determine the precise hour. <b>As Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: From the days of our ancestors, yeshiva never left them.</b> Our ancestors were leaders of their generations, who taught Torah to students who came to them.",

And similarly, when <b>they were in the desert,</b> there was <b>a yeshiva with them, as it is stated: “Gather for me seventy men from the Elders of Israel”</b> (Numbers 11:16). <b>Abraham our Patriarch</b> was himself <b>an Elder and would sit in yeshiva, as it is stated: “And Abraham was old, advanced in years”</b> (Genesis 24:1). From the apparent redundancy of the terms old and advanced in years, it is derived that old means that he was a wise Elder and prominent in Torah, and advanced in years means that he was elderly. Similarly, <b>Isaac our Patriarch was an Elder and sat in yeshiva, as it is stated: “And it came to pass when Isaac was old</b> and his eyes were dim” (Genesis 27:1).

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> perhaps <b>I should reverse</b> them and say that the first verse refers to the arrangement of wood for the incense, and the second verse refers to the large arrangement of wood.

            "The Gemara rejects this: <b>On the contrary,</b> the <b>second arrangement</b> takes <b>precedence, as</b> unlike the large arrangement in which offerings are burned exclusively on the outer altar, coals <b>from it are taken inside</b> the Sanctuary.

            "Abaye continued and said that the <b>second arrangement for incense precedes the setting up of the two logs.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> do <b>we</b> derive this? <b>As it is written: “And the priest shall burn wood upon it in the morning, in the morning”</b> (Leviticus 6:5); there is an obligation to place new logs upon the large arrangement. The term <b>upon it</b> underscores that the wood is placed only on the large arrangement, <b>and not on the other</b> arrangement from which coals are taken for the incense.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But this</b> term: <b>Upon it, is needed for its own sake,</b> to teach the obligation to place the logs on the altar; therefore, how can the timing of their placement be derived from that term? The Gemara answers: The term: <b>Upon it, is written twice</b> in that verse: “And the priest shall burn wood upon it in the morning, in the morning, and he shall place the burnt-offering upon it.” From one instance of this term the fundamental obligation to place the logs is derived, and from the other instance the order of their placement is derived.",

Apparently, the place where the confession is recited must be considered north. The Gemara clarifies: About <b>whom did you learn that he said</b> that the area <b>between the Entrance Hall and the altar</b> is considered <b>north</b> and is therefore a valid location for slaughtering offerings of the most sacred order, based on the verse written with regard to the burnt-offering: “On the side of the altar northward” (Leviticus 1:11)?",

Therefore, the mishna could be in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi as well.",
            "The Gemara reformulates its suggestion: <b>This is what we are saying: If</b> the mishna were in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who holds that the entire courtyard is considered north, <b>let us stand</b> the bull anywhere <b>in the entire courtyard</b> and not necessarily between the Entrance Hall and the altar.

            "<b>Rather, what have you to say</b> to explain why the bull is positioned specifically between the Entrance Hall and the altar?

In his opinion, this is not a case of a prohibition that after violation is transformed into a positive mitzva, as the positive mitzva: “Give it to the stranger in your community to eat,” in no way rectifies the prohibition that was violated. If the carcass was eaten, obviously it cannot then be given to the stranger. Apparently, the verse means that due to the prohibition against eating it, one should give it to the stranger. <b>And Rabbi Yosei HaGelili holds: It is not a full-fledged prohibition;</b> rather, it is a prohibition that after violation is transformed into a positive mitzva.

And you shall not glean your vineyard, neither shall you gather the fallen fruit of your vineyard; <b>you shall leave</b> them for the poor and for the stranger, I am the Lord your God (Leviticus 19:9–10).

If one fails to fulfill that mitzva, he violates full-fledged prohibitions punishable by lashes. However, <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili holds</b> that the positive mitzva: <b>You shall leave, indicates now,</b> after one violated the prohibition. Even if the individual violated the prohibitions and harvested those crops, there is an obligation to rectify his actions by leaving the produce he harvested for the poor.

Based on Rav’s logic, that indicates that the priest is indispensable.",
            "The Gemara explains: The slaughter of the bull by a non-priest is valid because <b>slaughtering is not</b> classified as a sacrificial <b>service;</b> therefore, it does not have to be done by a priest. The Gemara challenges this answer: <b>If so,</b> by the same logic, the red <b>heifer</b> should <b>also</b> be valid when slaughtered by a non-priest. The Gemara concludes: The logic that slaughtering is not classified as a sacrificial service does not apply in the case of the red heifer because the red <b>heifer is different.</b> It has the sanctity <b>of</b> items <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance,</b> and therefore the principles that apply to other offerings do not necessarily apply to it.",
            "But <b>is it not</b> arguable, by <b>an <i>a fortiori</i> inference,</b> that the slaughter of the red heifer by a non-priest is valid? If the slaughter of the bull of the High Priest, which is an actual offering, is valid when performed by a non-priest, then all the more so the slaughter of the red heifer, which is not an offering, should be valid when similarly performed by a non-priest. <b>Rav Shisha, son of Rav Idi, said:</b> The slaughter of the red heifer by a non-priest is invalid. The <i>halakha</i> is <b>just as in</b> the case of <b>appearances of leprosy, which,</b> despite their <b>not</b> being a sacrificial <b>service,</b> still <b>require the priesthood.</b> Only a priest may declare the signs of leprosy to be pure or impure. It is apparent from this case that the logic of the <i>a fortiori</i> inference does not hold.",
            "The Gemara analyzes Shmuel’s opinion: <b>And</b> according <b>to Shmuel, who said</b> that if a non-priest slaughters <b>the bull</b> of the High Priest it <b>is invalid, what is different</b> with regard to <b>his bull</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i>? It is different in <b>that,</b> with regard to it, <b>it is written “Aaron,”</b> indicating that a priest is required, <b>and “statute,”</b> indicating that the requirements of the Yom Kippur service are indispensable. But with regard to the red <b>heifer it is also written: “Elazar” and “statute”</b> which by the same logic should indicate the need for a priest is indispensable. The Gemara concludes: <b>It is different there as it is written: “And he shall slaughter it before him”</b> (Numbers 19:3), i.e., in front of Elazar, which suggests <b>that it could be</b> that <b>a non-priest slaughters and Elazar watches.</b>",
            "<b>And Rav,</b> who assumes the slaughter is performed by the priest himself, how does he interpret the phrase: “Before him”? He understands it to mean <b>that he should not divert his attention from</b> the heifer from the moment of slaughtering until the completion of the process. As with other matters of purification, one is required to maintain his attention on the matter; any distraction can invalidate the process. <b>And from where does Shmuel,</b> who already derived something from this verse, derive <b>that he should not divert his attention</b> from it? <b>He derives it</b> from the verse: <b>“And he shall burn the heifer in his sight”</b> (Numbers 19:5).",
            "<b>And</b> what does <b>Rav</b> learn from this verse? He holds that <b>one</b> verse is needed to teach the requirement to maintain one’s attention <b>with regard to slaughtering, and one</b> verse is needed to teach the requirement <b>with regard to burning.</b>",
            "<b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to have the requirement stated in both cases <b>since, if the Merciful One had written it</b> only <b>with regard to slaughtering,</b> I might have limited the requirement to that case <b>because it is the start of the</b> Temple <b>service; but</b> with regard to <b>burning, I could say</b> that <b>no,</b> there is no requirement. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to teach the requirement also in the case of burning. <b>And if the Merciful One had written</b> the requirement only <b>with regard to burning,</b> I might have limited it to that case, <b>because it is now that</b> the <b>heifer is</b> actually <b>being made ready</b> to be used; <b>but</b> with regard to <b>slaughtering, I could say</b> that <b>no,</b> there is no requirement. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to teach the requirement also in that case.",
            "As the requirement is mentioned with regard to two stages of the rite of the red heifer, this suggests that it does not exist for every stage. Therefore, the Gemara asks: It is written this way in order <b>to exclude what</b> stage? <b>If we say, to exclude</b> from the requirement the stages of <b>gathering its ashes and filling the water for sanctification,</b> i.e., taking the water in order to pour it on the ashes and mix them together,"

            "<b>And</b> if the word “law” serves to include all stages in the <i>halakha</i> and the word “this” serves to exclude some stages, <b>what did you see to include these</b> stages <b>and to exclude those?

            "<b>Abaye said: This is the challenge:</b> With regard to <b>a woman, what is the reason</b> she may not perform these stages?

            "The Gemara considers other aspects of the rite of the red heifer: <b>Ulla said:</b> Throughout <b>the entire passage</b> of the red heifer, certain conditions apply to some stages of the rite, but not to others.

            "The Gemara proceeds to demonstrate Ulla’s claim by expounding the verses throughout the passage of the red heifer: The verse states with regard to the red heifer: <b>“And you shall give it to Elazar the priest</b> and he shall take it out to the outside of the camp, and he shall slaughter it before him” (Numbers 19:3).

What in fact is the ruling in a situation where the High Priest took a handful of incense and then died? May the newly appointed High Priest use the handful that has already been scooped, or does he require a new handful? <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The resolution of this question depends on a different problem. <b>If</b> the High Priest <b>scoops</b> the handful when he takes the incense from the coal pan, and <b>again scoops</b> a handful in the Holy of Holies, this would mean that <b>another</b> priest may <b>enter with the handful</b> of the first High Priest, <b>as</b> the mitzva of <b>scooping</b> the handful has been <b>fulfilled.</b> However, <b>if</b> the High Priest does <b>not scoop and again scoop, let the dilemma be raised.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said to Rav Pappa: On the contrary, if</b> the High Priest <b>scoops and again scoops, another</b> priest should <b>not</b> be permitted to <b>enter with his handful,</b> as <b>it is impossible</b> that the new handful <b>will be neither less nor more</b> than the amount of the first handful, which means the handful will not have been taken properly. <b>But</b> conversely, <b>if he does not scoop and again scoop, let the dilemma be raised,</b> as the mitzva of taking a handful has already been fulfilled by the first priest, and the second priest has merely to place the incense on the coals.",
            "The Gemara explains the background to this problem. <b>As a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Does the High Priest <b>scoop</b> a handful from the incense once <b>and again scoop a handful</b> a second time in the Holy of Holies, <b>or</b> does he <b>not</b> scoop a second time? The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this dilemma from the mishna: <b>This was the measure</b> of the spoon. <b>What, is it not</b> correct to infer from the mishna that <b>just as its measure</b> is <b>on the outside, so is its measure on the inside,</b> i.e., there is no need to scoop another handful, as this is its fixed measure that he pours onto the coal pan.",
            "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No,</b> that is not necessarily the correct interpretation of the mishna. <b>Perhaps</b> it means <b>that if he wants to measure</b> a precise <b>amount</b> for his handful, <b>he may measure</b> with a utensil for this purpose. <b>Alternatively,</b> it could mean <b>that</b> he may take <b>neither less nor more</b> than the measure he initially took. Consequently, there is no proof from the mishna with regard to whether the High Priest must scoop a second handful.",

After he places the coal pan on the ground, <b>he holds the</b> front of <b>the ladle,</b> i.e., the spoon of incense, <b>with his fingertips, and some say</b> he holds it <b>with his teeth.</b> At this stage the handle of the spoon rests between his arms. <b>And</b> he pushes it and <b>raises</b> it <b>up</b> slowly <b>with his thumb</b> toward his body <b>until it reaches between his elbows,</b> which he then uses to turn it over. <b>He then returns</b> the incense <b>into his palms,</b> after which he pours it from his hands into the coal pan. <b>And he heaps</b> the incense into a pile on the coals <b>so that its smoke rises slowly.

            "The Sages disputed this matter. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: “With a bull,” and not with the blood of a bull,</b> which means that the newly appointed High Priest must slaughter another bull, as he can enter only with the blood of a bull he himself slaughtered. <b>And Reish Lakish said: “With a bull,” and even with the blood of a bull.</b> Likewise, <b>Rabbi Ami said: “With a bull” and not with the blood of a bull; Rabbi Yitzḥak said: “With a bull,” and even with the blood of a bull.</b>",

            "§ The Gemara returns to the issue of a replacement High Priest entering with the blood of the first bull: <b>And let him derive</b> the answer to this problem from the fact <b>that it is a sin-offering whose owners have died.</b> After all, the bull of the first High Priest is a sin-offering and its owner has died. Since there is a principle that <b>a sin-offering whose owners have died is left to die,</b> this should resolve the dilemma. <b>Ravin bar Rav Adda said to Rava: Your students say</b> that <b>Rav Amram said</b> that the sin-offering bull of the High Priest <b>is a communal sin-offering,</b> as the High Priest brings it both on his own behalf and for his fellow priests, and a communal sin-offering <b>is not left to die.</b>",

The <i>halakha</i> in this case is that the court must bring a bull for an unwitting communal sin. Rava insisted on referring to the bull that atones for all of the priests on Yom Kippur as a sin-offering of partners, not a communal sin-offering, for the following reason: If a court composed of priests issued a mistaken ruling, and the priests acted in accordance with that teaching, the <b>priests do not bring a bull for</b> this <b>ruling,</b> as they are not considered a community but a large partnership.",

In any event, the question of why the bull is not invalidated upon the death of the High Priest has been resolved, as the reason is either because it is a communal sacrifice or because it is a sacrifice of partners.",
            "§ Since the Gemara has mentioned Rabbi Elazar’s dilemma, the Gemara addresses <b>the matter itself. Rabbi Elazar asked:</b> According <b>to</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>who says</b> that the <b>bull of Yom Kippur</b> is <b>an individual offering,</b> can one <b>perform substitution</b> for this animal <b>or</b> can one <b>not perform substitution?</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the dilemma he is raising?</b> What is the basis of his inquiry?",
            "The Gemara suggests that his dilemma is as follows: <b>Do we follow</b> the one <b>who consecrates</b> the animal, i.e., the High Priest, as he was the one who paid for it, in which case it is considered an individual sacrifice and his substitution is effective? <b>Or do we follow</b> the one <b>who seeks atonement</b> by the offering, and as this bull atones both for the High Priest and the entire community of his fellow priests, it is considered a communal sacrifice, and therefore his substitution is not effective? The question is: Which party is followed for the purposes of substitution?",
            "The Gemara expresses surprise at this possible interpretation of Rabbi Elazar’s dilemma: It is <b>obvious that we follow</b> the one <b>who seeks atonement, as Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> With regard to <b>one who consecrates</b> his animal for an offering but intends it for someone else’s atonement, if he subsequently redeems the animal, <b>he adds a fifth</b> to it. This is in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> that one who redeems an animal that he himself dedicated must add a fifth of its value to the redemption, whereas if the person for whom it atones redeems it, he does not add a fifth. <b>And the one for whom</b> the sacrifice <b>atones</b> can <b>perform substitution for it,</b> whereas the one who consecrated the animal cannot effect substitution, as he is not considered its owner for the <i>halakhot</i> of substitution.",
            "<b>And</b> likewise, with regard to <b>one who separates</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>from his</b> wheat <b>for</b> the wheat <b>of another,</b> to spare his friend from having to separate his own <i>teruma</i>, although the friend’s produce is now exempt from the obligation of <i>teruma</i>, the <b>benefit of discretion is his,</b> the one who separated the <i>teruma</i>. The one who separated the <i>teruma</i> is entitled to determine which priest receives the <i>teruma</i>, despite the fact that the <i>teruma</i> was separated for the crop of another. Similarly, when someone consecrates an animal for another person, it is the one who gains atonement that can perform substitution. If so, there is no place for Rabbi Elazar’s dilemma.",
            "The Gemara rejects this suggested explanation of Rabbi Elazar’s dilemma: <b>Actually,</b> it is <b>obvious to</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>that we follow</b> the one <b>who seeks atonement</b> by the offering, <b>and this is his dilemma:</b> Do <b>his fellow priests achieve atonement by the essence</b> of the offering, i.e., part of the offering is sacrificed on their behalf, which means they are partners in the bull? <b>Or perhaps they achieve atonement incidentally,</b> while the main atonement is that of the High Priest. If the atonement of the other priests is merely incidental, the High Priest can effect substitution with this bull.",

Once again, the issue is whether this term belongs to the beginning or the end of the verse.",
            "The fourth case is the term: <b>“<i>Arur</i>”</b> (Genesis 49:7). This verse can be read: “Cursed [<i>arur</i>] be their anger for it was fierce, and their wrath for it was cruel,” on account of Levi and Simeon’s treatment of Shechem. Alternatively, this term, which appears at the beginning of the verse, can be read as the last word of the previous verse: “And in their anger they cut off cursed [<i>arur</i>] oxen” (Genesis 49:6–7). According to this interpretation, “cursed oxen” is referring to the oxen of Shechem, who descended from the accursed Canaan.",
            "Finally, the term: <b>“<i>Vekam</i>”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:16) can be read as: “Behold, you are about to sleep with your fathers and rise up [<i>vekam</i>]” at the time of the resurrection of the dead; or: “And this people will rise up [<i>vekam</i>] and go astray.”",

            "<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> This is not a true case of retroactive clarification, <b>as the Sage had already come</b> by twilight, but the one who established the <i>eiruv</i> did not yet know at which side of the town the Sage had arrived. Therefore, at the time the <i>eiruv</i> establishes his Shabbat residence, it is clear which <i>eiruv</i> he wants, although he himself will become aware of that only later. In this case, Rabbi Yehuda agrees that the <i>eiruv</i> is valid, but he nonetheless maintains in general that there is no retroactive clarification. This accounts for Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion that there was no container for nests of obligatory sin-offerings and burnt-offerings, as he maintains that there is no solution for the possible mixture of the different coins.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And now that we have said</b> and proven that <b>according to Rabbi Yehuda there is no</b> retroactive <b>clarification,</b> nevertheless <b>he is of</b> the opinion that one may rely on <b>writing,</b> as proven from the <i>halakha</i> of the collection horns. If so, on <b>Yom Kippur as well, let us place two</b> pedestals <b>and write on them</b> which one is for the blood of the bull and which is for the blood of the goat.",
            "The Gemara answers: The reason they did not place two pedestals with writing on them is <b>due to the High Priest’s weakness.</b> Since he is fasting during the entire day’s service, the writing will <b>not</b> be <b>on his mind;</b> he will pay no attention to it and might become confused. <b>As, if you do not say so,</b> that there is concern for the High Priest’s weakness, even <b>without writing</b> he should <b>also</b> not err, as <b>this</b> bowl in which he collects the bull’s blood <b>is</b> relatively <b>large and this</b> one for the goat’s blood <b>is small.</b>",
            "<b>And if you say</b> that <b>he does not collect all</b> the bull’s blood but only some of it, so that the bowls are of equal size, <b>didn’t Rav Yehuda say: One who slaughters</b> the bull <b>must receive all of the blood of</b> the <b>bull, as it is stated: “And all the blood of the bull he shall pour out on the base of the altar”</b> (Leviticus 4:7).",
            "<b>And if you say</b> that <b>perhaps some of</b> the bull’s blood <b>might spill,</b> yielding equal amounts of blood, there should still be no mistake, as <b>this</b> blood, that of the goat, is <b>white</b> and bright compared to the blood of the bull, <b>and this</b> blood of the bull <b>is red</b> and darker than the other. <b>Rather,</b> the reason must be that <b>due to the High Priest’s weakness,</b> these differences will <b>not</b> be <b>on his mind.

            "§ The Gemara relates: <b>A certain person descended</b> to lead the prayer service on Yom Kippur <b>before Rava</b>. He included the order of the High Priest’s Yom Kippur service in his prayer, and <b>he recited:</b> The High Priest then <b>emerged</b> from the Holy of Holies <b>and placed</b> the bowl <b>on the second golden pedestal in the Sanctuary; he took the blood of the bull</b> from the pedestal <b>and placed the blood of the goat</b> in its place.",

            "The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to the aforementioned <i>halakha</i>. It was stated above that the comparison to the goat teaches that the High Priest sprinkles the bull’s blood once upward; and the seven downward sprinklings of the goat’s blood are derived from the rite of the blood of the bull. Subsequently, the order of sprinkling toward the curtain in the Sanctuary is again derived by means of a similar comparison. The Gemara asks: <b>And does a matter derived by juxtaposition,</b> i.e., a <i>halakha</i> not written explicitly in the Torah but learned by means of a comparison, <b>again teach by juxtaposition?</b> There is a general principle that a <i>halakha</i> derived by juxtaposition with regard to offerings cannot subsequently teach another <i>halakha</i> by juxtaposition.",
            "The Gemara answers that the first juxtaposition was not a proper inference by verbal analogy, as <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> that the High Priest must sprinkle once upward and seven times downward <b>is</b> derived both <b>from that</b> juxtaposition <b>and something else</b> as well. Since the basic requirement that he must sprinkle upward and downward for the bull and the goat is stated explicitly in both cases, and the comparison was necessary only to teach the precise number of sprinklings, this inference <b>is not</b> considered <b>a juxtaposition</b> to the extent that one cannot derive further comparisons from it.",
            "The Gemara continues to question this explanation: <b>It works out well according to the one who said</b> that a juxtaposition that is also inferred from something else <b>is not</b> considered <b>a juxtaposition</b> in this regard; <b>but according to the one who says</b> that this too <b>is</b> called <b>a juxtaposition, what can be said?</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>It is</b> the <b>locations that are derived from one another.</b> The <i>halakha</i> of the blood of the bull was not derived from that of the goat, nor the <i>halakha</i> of sprinkling the bull’s blood outside the curtain from that of sprinkling the bull’s blood inside. Instead, the first comparison equates the sprinkling of the bull’s blood and the goat’s blood, while the second comparison equates the locations, i.e., he sprinkles outside the curtain in the same manner that he sprinkles inside. Consequently, the two juxtapositions are not connected to each other, which means that there is no problem of a <i>halakha</i> derived by juxtaposition itself teaching by juxtaposition.",
            "<b>If you wish, say</b> instead a different resolution: The sprinkling <b>outside is derived from</b> the sprinkling <b>inside all at once,</b> i.e., the juxtaposition includes not only the blood of the bull and the goat, but also the manners of sprinkling the blood inside and outside. There are not two comparisons here, one derived from the other, but a single, complex juxtaposition.",
            "§ A Sage <b>taught: When</b> the High Priest <b>sprinkles</b> the blood, <b>he does not</b> actually <b>sprinkle on the curtain but opposite the curtain. Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, said: I saw</b> the curtain <b>in Rome.</b> After a miracle was performed on his behalf and he healed the daughter of the Roman emperor, Rabbi Elazar was permitted to view the ruler’s treasures and take whatever he wanted. He saw the Temple vessels that the Romans captured, including the curtain. Rabbi Elazar continued: <b>And on</b> the curtain <b>were several drops of blood from the bull and the goat of Yom Kippur.</b> This shows that the blood was actually sprinkled on the curtain.",
            "The Gemara questions this conclusion: <b>But</b> how can Rabbi Elazar be sure that these drops of blood were from the bull and goat of Yom Kippur? <b>Perhaps</b> they <b>were</b> from the <b>bull for an unwitting communal sin</b> or <b>the goats for</b> a sin of <b>idolatry,</b> both of whose blood is also sprinkled on the curtain.",
            "The Gemara explains <b>that he saw that these</b> sprinklings of blood <b>were performed in their order,</b> one drop after another, a sequence that is followed only in the Yom Kippur service. <b>And we also learned</b> in a mishna about <b>a case like this with regard to</b> the <b>bull for an unwitting communal sin: When he sprinkles,</b> the blood <b>would not touch the curtain, but if it did touch, it touched,</b> and this did not invalidate the service.",
            "<b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, said: I saw</b> the curtain <b>in Rome, and there were several drops of blood on it from</b> the <b>bull for an unwitting communal sin and</b> the <b>goats for</b> a sin of <b>idolatry.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> how could he identify the source of the blood; <b>perhaps they</b> were <b>from the bull and goat of Yom Kippur?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He saw that they were performed not in their order</b> and inferred that they must be sprinklings from communal sin-offerings, which are not presented in a sequence.",

If the first cup contained the blood of the goat, he performed the sprinkling of the goat’s blood before that of the bull, which means his first set of sprinklings are discounted. Consequently, when he sprinkled from the second cup, which contains the bull’s blood, and a third time from the cup of the goat’s blood, he fulfilled his obligation with the second and third sets of sprinklings.",
            "The Gemara asks yet another question: <b>If</b> only <b>part of</b> the <b>blood became mixed</b> together <b>and part of the blood did not become mixed,</b> e.g., if some of the blood spilled and became mixed in a third vessel, the solution is <b>obvious: When he presents, he presents from the</b> blood of <b>certain</b> identity.",

From where does he begin?</b> He begins <b>from the northeast corner,</b> and proceeds to the <b>northwest</b> corner, and then to the <b>southwest</b> corner, and finally to the <b>southeast</b> corner. A way to remember this is: At the <b>place</b> where <b>he begins</b> sprinkling the blood <b>for a sin-offering</b> sacrificed <b>on the outer altar,</b> the southeast corner, <b>there he finishes</b> sprinkling the blood <b>on the inner altar.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The priest would not circle the altar; rather, <b>he stood in</b> one <b>place and sprinkled</b> the blood from there. Since the altar was only one square cubit, he could sprinkle the blood on all four corners without moving.",

Upon his exit, after sprinkling toward the curtain, the High Priest must necessarily reach the golden altar. <b>Rabbi Neḥemya said:</b> It is <b>because we find with regard to the bull brought for</b> a violation of <b>all the mitzvot,</b> i.e., the bull that must be brought in the event that the community errs with regard to any of the mitzvot, which is called the bull for an unwitting communal sin, <b>that when the priest sprinkles</b> toward the curtain <b>he stands past the altar and sprinkles</b> back <b>toward the curtain;</b> therefore, one <b>might</b> have thought <b>that here, too,</b> the rite should be performed in <b>the same</b> manner.",
            "Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And he shall go out to the altar.” Where was he</b> before? He was <b>on the inner side of the altar,</b> i.e., the western side, close to the curtain, when he sprinkled, not on the outer side of the altar.",

            "<b>And why does he not do</b> so; why does the High Priest not begin the sprinkling on one of the western corners?

If he sprinkled on the corner next to him from below upward, the blood might fall on his clothes, and he would have to change garments, as dirty priestly garments may not be worn for the Temple service.",
            "§ The mishna taught: <b>He sprinkled</b> blood <b>on</b> the <b>pure</b> gold <b>[<i>tohoro</i>] of the altar.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term <b><i>tohoro</i>?

The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states:</b> “And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, <b>and cleanse it and sanctify it”</b> (Leviticus 16:19), which indicates that the <b>place he sanctified</b> by sprinkling blood, the corner of the altar where he sprinkled last, <b>there he shall</b> also begin to <b>cleanse</b> and sprinkle on top.",
            "§ The mishna taught: <b>And he would pour the remainder of the blood on the western base of the outer altar.</b> The Gemara explains: The reason is <b>that the verse states</b> with regard to the sin-offering bull of the High Priest during the rest of the year: <b>“And he shall pour out all the blood of the bull</b> at the base of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 4:7), <b>and when he goes out</b> from the Sanctuary to pour the remainder of the blood, <b>he first reaches that</b> western side of the base of the altar.",

            "<b>However,</b> with regard to <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai, what is the reason</b> that he holds that both sets of remainders of blood are spilled at the southern base? <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai <b>maintains</b> that the <b>entrance</b> of the Sanctuary <b>is positioned at the south</b> side of the altar, i.e., the altar is not located in the middle of the courtyard but to the north. Consequently, the southern base of the altar is closest to the High Priest’s exit from the Sanctuary.",

The Gemara comments: <b>And your mnemonic</b> to remember the shift in opinion is: <b>The men pulled the man,</b> i.e., the majority overruled the individual. In this case, the numerous students of Rabbi Shimon convinced the individual Sage, Rabbi Yishmael, to accept their ruling.",

It is prohibited to use consecrated objects for mundane purposes, and one who does so is committing the sin of misusing consecrated property. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> that there is no misuse for blood, derived? <b>Ulla said</b> that <b>the verse states:</b> “For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it <b>to you</b> upon the altar to make atonement for your souls” (Leviticus 17:11). “To you” indicates that <b>it shall be yours.</b> It is not the property of the Temple; rather, it belongs to all of the Jewish people. <b>The school</b> of <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> likewise <b>taught</b> that the phrase <b>“to make atonement”</b> teaches that God says: <b>I gave it for atonement and not for</b> the prohibition against <b>misuse</b> of consecrated objects.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived from a different phrase. <b>The verse states:</b> “For <b>it is</b> the blood that makes atonement by reason of the life” (Leviticus 17:11), which indicates that it retains the same status <b>before atonement as after atonement: Just as after atonement</b> it is <b>not subject to</b> the prohibition against <b>misuse</b> of consecrated objects, as the mitzva has been performed, <b>so too, before atonement it is not subject to misuse</b> of consecrated objects.

The Gemara rejects this contention: This cannot be the case, as there is a general principle: <b>There is nothing whose mitzva has been performed that is</b> still <b>subject to misuse</b> of consecrated property.

Consequently, they are <b>two verses that come as one,</b> i.e., they share a unique <i>halakha</i> not found elsewhere. <b>And</b> there is a principle: <b>Any two verses that come as one do not teach,</b> i.e., an analogy may not be derived from these two similar cases.

            "<b>However,</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Dosa, who said</b> that these <b>priestly vestments are fit for a common priest</b> and do not require interment, one does not misuse consecrated property by using them, and therefore <b>what is there to say?</b> In his opinion, the <i>halakha</i> of misuse of consecrated objects after the performance of a mitzva applies only to the removal of ashes from the altar, not to the priestly vestments, which means it is stated in only a single case. Why, then, does this case not serve as a model for other instances in the Torah?",
            "The Gemara responds: The reason is <b>because</b> the cases of the <b>removal of the ashes and the heifer whose neck is broken are two verses that come as one,</b> as it is prohibited to derive benefit from either of them even after their mitzva is completed, <b>and any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> their common feature to other cases. The heifer whose neck is broken is a ritual performed when a murder victim’s body is found outside a town, and it is not known who caused his death.",
            "The Gemara challenges this reply from a different angle: <b>It works out well according to the one who said</b> that two verses that come as one <b>do not teach</b> their common feature to other cases, <b>but according to the one who says that two verses that come as one</b> do <b>teach</b> with regard to other cases, <b>what is there to say?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Two exclusions are written</b> in these two cases, which indicate that this <i>halakha</i> applies to them alone. With respect to the removal of ashes, it states: <b>“And he shall put it”</b> (Leviticus 6:3), implying “it” and nothing else. With regard to the heifer whose neck is broken, it is written: <b>“Whose neck was broken”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:6), which teaches that this <i>halakha</i> applies solely to this case.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> if this <i>halakha</i> is derived from those two cases, <b>why do I</b> need <b>these three verses</b> stated <b>with regard to blood,</b> from which it is derived that the prohibition against misuse of consecrated objects does not apply to the remainder of blood that flows to the Kidron River? The reference is to the three phrases singled out above from the verse: “I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls, for it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of the life” (Leviticus 17:11).",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>One</b> of those phrases comes <b>to exclude</b> the blood from the prohibition of <b><i>notar</i>,</b> offerings that remain after the time when they may be eaten has expired. If one ate leftover blood, he is not punished with <i>karet</i>, as generally incurred by one who consumes <i>notar</i>. Rather, he is liable only for violating the prohibition against eating blood. <b>And one</b> phrase comes <b>to exclude</b> it <b>from</b> the prohibition against <b>misuse</b> of consecrated objects, <b>and one</b> other phrase comes <b>to exclude</b> it <b>from ritual impurity.</b> If one ate this blood in a state of ritual impurity, he is liable only for the transgression of eating blood, but not on account of eating consecrated food while ritually impure.",
            "<b>However, no verse is required to exclude</b> this blood <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b><i>piggul</i>,</b> an offering disqualified by improper intention, because this is already derived from another source, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: With regard to <b>any</b> offering <b>that has</b> another rite that <b>permits it,</b> e.g., an offering that is permitted by the sprinkling of blood or by means of a second offering, <b>one is liable to</b> receive <i>karet</i> if he eats it after it is rendered <b><i>piggul</i>.</b> This is the case <b>whether</b> the other rite permits it <b>for human</b> consumption <b>or whether</b> it enables the offering to be sacrificed <b>on the altar.</b> However, the permitting factor itself is not subject to <i>piggul</i>.

            "The Gemara elaborates on the preceding argument: If one claims that the mishna permits priests to sleep upon their vestments, <b>it works out well according to the one who said: The belt of the High Priest</b> worn on Yom Kippur, which does not contain diverse kinds, <b>is the same as the belt of a common priest.</b> According to this view, the common priest’s belt does not contain diverse kinds, and therefore it may be permitted for a priest to sleep upon it. <b>However, according to the one who said</b> that <b>the High Priest’s belt</b> on Yom Kippur <b>is not the same as the belt of a common priest,</b> and that the belt of the common priest is made of diverse kinds, <b>what is there to say?</b> How could the mishna possibly permit priests to sleep upon their vestments?",
            "<b>And if you say</b> that with regard to the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds</b> only <b>wearing</b> or <b>placing</b> the garment <b>upon oneself is prohibited, but spreading them out</b> and lying upon them on <b>is permitted,</b> and as such it should be permitted for the priests to sleep upon their vestments, this is incorrect. As, <b>wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states: <b>“Neither shall there come upon you</b> a garment of diverse kinds”(Leviticus 19:19), which implies: <b>But you are permitted to spread it beneath you</b> to lie upon. This is true according to Torah law, <b>but the Sages said: It is prohibited to do so, lest a fiber wrap upon his flesh,</b> which would lead to the transgression of the Torah prohibition.",
            "<b>And if you say</b> that a priest could still avoid the prohibition of diverse kinds by <b>placing a separation between</b> himself and the belt containing diverse kinds, <b>didn’t Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said in the name of the holy community in Jerusalem: Even</b> if there are <b>ten mattresses</b> piled <b>one atop the other and</b> a garment of <b>diverse kinds</b> is placed <b>underneath them</b> all, <b>it is prohibited to sleep upon them?</b> This is because the rabbinic decree is applied equally to all cases irrespective of whether the original concern exists. Therefore, there can be no way for the priests to sleep upon the vestments without transgressing the prohibition of diverse kinds. <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> the preceding discussion that the mishna permits the vestments to be placed only <b>next to their heads?</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>Learn from it</b> that this is indeed so.",
            "<b>Rav Ashi said: Actually,</b> the mishna may be understood as permitting the vestments to be placed <b>under their heads.</b> One should not object that by doing so the priests would be <b>deriving benefit from</b> a garment made of <b>diverse kinds</b> because <b>priestly vestments,</b> and specifically the belt, <b>are stiff,</b> and therefore the prohibition of diverse kinds does not apply to them. This is <b>in accordance with that</b> which <b>Rav Huna, son of Rabbi Yehoshua, said: This stiff felt [<i>namta</i>],</b> made of diverse kinds, that is produced <b>in</b> the city of <b>Neresh, is permitted,</b> since a stiff object does not wrap around the body to provide warmth, and therefore the person wearing is not considered to have derived benefit from it.",
            "Since the mishna’s intention is uncertain, it cannot provide a clear proof for the dilemma of whether it is permitted to derive benefit from priestly vestments. The Gemara therefore suggests another proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an explicit <i>baraita</i> concerning this issue: With regard to <b>priestly vestments, it is prohibited to go out to the country,</b> i.e., outside the Temple, while <b>wearing them, but in the Temple it is permitted</b> for the priests to wear them, <b>whether during the</b> Temple <b>service or not during the service, due to</b> the fact <b>that it is permitted to derive benefit from priestly vestments. Learn from this</b> that it is indeed permitted.",
            "§ The <i>baraita</i> taught that the priestly vestments may not be worn outside the Temple. The Gemara challenges this: Is it really <b>not</b> permitted to wear priestly vestments <b>in the country? Wasn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>, in <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i>: <b>The twenty-fifth of Tevet</b> is known as <b>the day of Mount Gerizim,</b> which was established as a joyful day, and therefore <b>eulogizing</b> is <b>not</b> permitted.",
            "What occurred on that date? It was on that <b>day that the Samaritans [<i>kutim</i>] requested the House of our Lord from Alexander the Macedonian in order to destroy it, and he gave it to them,</b> i.e., he gave them permission to destroy it.

And all that night, these,</b> the representatives of the Jewish people, <b>approached from this side, and those,</b> the armies of Alexander and the Samaritans, <b>approached from that side, until dawn,</b> when they finally saw one another.",
            "<b>When dawn arrived,</b> Alexander <b>said to</b> the Samaritans: <b>Who are these</b> people coming to meet us? <b>They said to him:</b> These are the <b>Jews who rebelled against you.

            "<b>He said</b> to the representatives of the Jewish people: <b>Why have you come?

            "It is apparent from the <i>baraita</i> that Shimon HaTzaddik wore the priestly vestments even outside the Temple. This would seem to be in contravention of the ruling of the other <i>baraita</i> prohibiting this. The Gemara resolves the contradiction: <b>If you wish, say</b> Shimon HaTzaddik did not wear a set of genuine, sanctified priestly vestments; rather, he wore garments that were <b>fitting to be priestly vestments</b> in that they were made of the same material and design. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that he indeed wore a set of genuine priestly vestments, but in times of great need, such as when one seeks to prevent the destruction of the Temple, it is permitted to violate the <i>halakha</i>, as indicated by the verse: <b>“It is time to act for the Lord, they have nullified your Torah”</b> (Psalms 119:126).",

            "Apropos the verse in Nehemiah, the Gemara interprets an adjacent verse homiletically. It is stated: <b>“And Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God”</b> (Nehemiah 8:6). The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>“great”</b> here? <b>Rav Yosef said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> It means <b>that he ascribed greatness to Him by</b> enunciating God’s <b>explicit name.

            "When they saw that the evil inclination for idol worship was delivered into their hands as they requested, the Sages <b>said: Since it is an auspicious time, let us pray also concerning the</b> evil <b>inclination for sin</b> in the area of sexual relationships. <b>They prayed, and it was</b> also <b>delivered into their hands.</b>",

            "The Gemara returns to its discussion of the verse in Nehemiah cited above: <b>In the West,</b> i.e., Eretz Yisrael, <b>they taught</b> the debate concerning the verse “the Lord, the great God” <b>as follows: Rav Giddel said: “Great”</b> means <b>that he ascribed greatness to Him by</b> enunciating God’s <b>explicit name.

As Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Why are</b> the Sages of those generations <b>called the members of the Great Assembly?</b> It is <b>because they returned the crown</b> of the Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>to its former</b> glory. How so? <b>Moses came</b> and <b>said</b> in his prayer: <b>“The great, the mighty, and the awesomeGod”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:17). <b>Jeremiah</b> the prophet <b>came and said: Gentiles,</b> i.e., the minions of Nebuchadnezzar, <b>are carousing in His sanctuary; where is His awesomeness?</b> Therefore, <b>he did not say awesome</b> in his prayer: “The great God, the mighty Lord of Hosts, is His name” (Jeremiah 32:18). <b>Daniel came</b> and <b>said: Gentiles are enslaving His children; where is His might?</b> Therefore <b>he did not say mighty</b> in his prayer: “The great and awesome God” (Daniel 9:4).",
            "The members of the Great Assembly <b>came and said: On the contrary, this is the might of His might,</b> i.e., this is the fullest expression of it, <b>that He conquers His inclination</b> in <b>that He exercises patience toward the wicked.</b> God’s anger is flared by the gentile nations’ enslavement of His people, yet He expresses tremendous might by suppressing His anger and holding back from punishing them immediately. Therefore, it is still appropriate to refer to God as mighty. <b>And these</b> acts also express <b>His awesomeness: Were it not for the awesomeness of the Holy One, Blessed be He, how could one people,</b> i.e., the Jewish people, who are alone and hated by the gentile nations, <b>survive among the nations?</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis,</b> i.e., Jeremiah and Daniel, <b>how could they do this and uproot an ordinance instituted by Moses,</b> the greatest teacher, who instituted the mention of these attributes in prayer? <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> They did so <b>because they knew of the Holy One Blessed be He, that He is truthful</b> and hates a lie. <b>Consequently, they did not speak falsely about Him.</b> Since they did not perceive His attributes of might and awesomeness, they did not refer to them; therefore, they cannot be criticized for doing so.",

            "After sacrificing these offerings, <b>he sanctified his hands and feet and removed</b> the golden garments, <b>and he descended</b> into the ritual bath <b>and immersed and ascended and dried himself.</b>",
            "<b>They brought him the white garments</b> again, <b>and he dressed</b> in them <b>and sanctified his hands and feet.</b> Afterward <b>he entered</b> the Holy of Holies <b>to take out the</b> incense <b>spoon and the coal pan,</b> which he had brought there earlier. <b>He</b> again <b>sanctified his hands and feet and removed</b> the white garments <b>and descended</b> to the ritual bath <b>and immersed and ascended and dried himself</b> with a towel.",
            "<b>They brought him</b> the <b>golden garments, and he dressed</b> in them <b>and sanctified his hands and feet and entered</b> the Sanctuary <b>to burn the afternoon incense and to remove</b> the ashes from <b>the lamps,</b> which signified the end of the day’s service. <b>And he sanctified his hands and feet and removed</b> the golden garments, <b>and he descended</b> to the ritual bath <b>and immersed and ascended and dried himself.</b>",
            "<b>They</b> then <b>brought him his own clothing and he dressed,</b> since the service was complete and Yom Kippur was over; and the people <b>escort him to his house</b> in deference to him. <b>And</b> the High Priest <b>would make a feast for his loved ones</b> and his friends <b>when he emerged in peace from the Sanctuary.</b>",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It was taught in the mishna: Rabbi Akiva said the seven lambs were sacrificed with the daily morning offering; and the bull of the Yom Kippur burnt-offering; and the goat whose services are performed outside of the Sanctuary, i.e., in the Temple courtyard, with the daily afternoon offering. It is unclear whether the middle clause concerning the bull should be read as a continuation of the first clause, or as relating to the latter clause. The Gemara seeks to clarify this ambiguity. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What is</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>saying?</b> Does he mean to say the seven lambs <b>were sacrificed with the daily morning offering,</b> whereas <b>the bull</b> of the Yom Kippur <b>burnt-offering and the goat whose</b> services <b>are performed outside were sacrificed with the daily afternoon offering?</b>",

            "<b>And furthermore,</b> another dilemma: According to <b>both Rabbi Eliezer’s</b> opinion <b>and</b> according to <b>Rabbi Akiva’s</b> opinion, since neither of them mentioned the <b>portions of the sin-offering</b> to be consumed on the altar, it must be clarified <b>when</b> the High Priest <b>performs their</b> service and places them on the altar.",

            "<b>What is the rationale of the Rabbis,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, who divide the sacrifice of the seven lambs into two parts? <b>Two verses are written</b> that suggest different times at which the additional offerings are sacrificed: <b>It is written</b> with regard to the additional offerings: <b>“Besides the morning burnt-offering</b> which is the daily burnt-offering you shall sacrifice these” (Numbers 28:23), implying that the additional offerings are sacrificed in the morning. <b>But it is</b> also <b>written</b> that upon concluding the service of the day: <b>“And he shall exit and make his burnt-offering</b> and the burnt-offering of the people” (Leviticus 16:24). As the phrase: “The burnt-offering of the people,” is referring to the additional offerings, this verse implies that the additional offerings are sacrificed in the afternoon. <b>Therefore,</b> in order to fulfill both verses, <b>he performs</b> the sacrifice of <b>some of them here,</b> in the morning, <b>and some of them there,</b> in the afternoon.",
            "<b>With regard to what do</b> Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Elazar <b>disagree?

There is no concern that by doing so he might become weak and be unable to perform the service of the day, because <b>with regard to the service of the day,</b> the High Priest is <b>diligent</b> and will always muster the energy needed.",
            "The Gemara notes: Despite their disagreements, <b>everyone</b> agrees, <b>however,</b> that <b>there is</b> only <b>one ram</b> for the people. <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> Only one ram for the people is sacrificed, as <b>the one stated here</b> in Leviticus: “With this shall Aaron come into the Sanctuary: With a young bull for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering” (Leviticus 16:3), <b>is the same one</b> that is <b>stated in the Book of Numbers:</b> “And you shall sacrifice a burnt-offering to the Lord of pleasing odor: One young bull, one ram, seven unblemished year-old lambs shall be unto you” (Numbers 29:8). <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: There are two rams</b> for the people: <b>One that is stated here</b> in Leviticus, which is part of the service of the day, <b>and one stated in the Book of Numbers,</b> which is part of the day’s additional offerings.",

            "<b>Rav Mari said</b> another reason not to derive the number of strands in a pomegranate from the breastplate and ephod: “Like the work of the ephod <b>you shall make it”</b> (Exodus 28:15) <b>is written</b> with regard to the breastplate to indicate that <b>you shall make it,</b> i.e., the breastplate, like the ephod, which indicates that <b>for this,</b> i.e., the breastplate, you shall use thread of twenty-eight strands, <b>and not for anything else.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Ashi said</b> another reason that there could not be twenty-eight strands in a pomegranate: <b>“And you shall make</b> pomegranates of sky-blue, and of purple, and of scarlet” (Exodus 28:33) <b>is written</b> to indicate <b>that all the makings of it must be equal,</b> i.e., that each color thread should be made from the same number of strands.

            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us derive</b> the number of strands in the robe <b>from its hem and pomegranates: Just as there,</b> each thread is spun from <b>eight</b> strands, <b>so too here,</b> the threads should be spun from <b>eight</b> strands.

            "The <i>baraita</i> further states: Each thread of the <b>curtain</b> was made of <b>twenty-four</b> strands.

            "But couldn’t one <b>say</b> the <b>gold</b> should be made as a thread of <b>six</b> strands, like the other colors? <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said</b> that <b>the verse states:</b> “And they beat the gold into thin plates, <b>and cut it into cords,</b> to work it into the sky-blue, and into the purple, and into the scarlet, and into the fine linen, the work of a skilled craftsman” (Exodus 39:3). <b>“Cord”</b> implies a strand that is doubled over and can be twisted into a cord; <b>“cords”</b> is in the plural, meaning at least two of these. <b>Accordingly, there are four</b> strands <b>here.</b>",

The Gemara rejects this: <b>Is it written: In order that it not become detached, and: In order that they not be removed?</b> Clearly, the intention of the verse is to state a prohibition.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, raised a contradiction.</b> In one verse <b>it is written: “The staves shall be in the rings of the Ark; they shall not be removed from it”</b> (Exodus 25:15), implying the staves should remain there permanently. But in another verse <b>it is written: “And its staves shall be put into the rings”</b> (Exodus 27:7), implying that when the Ark is used the staves are inserted, which suggests that they do not remain there permanently. <b>How is this</b> contradiction resolved?

According to this opinion, the outer ark needed to be only ten handbreadths and a bit and could still contain the outer ark and have room for the cover. <b>And what is</b> this additional <b>bit?</b> It is the ornamental <b>crown</b> on the edge of the outer ark.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: There</b> were <b>three crowns</b> on the sacred vessels in the Temple: The crown <b>of the altar, and of the Ark, and of the table.</b> The regal appearance they provided symbolized power and authority: The crown <b>of the altar</b> symbolized the crown of priesthood; <b>Aaron was deserving and took it,</b> and the priesthood continues exclusively through his descendants.

            "In addition, when in mourning, a High Priest <b>does not let</b> his hair <b>grow wild, nor does he rend</b> his clothing in the way other mourners do. <b>But he does rend</b> his clothing <b>from below,</b> in a place that is not noticeable, while <b>the common</b> priest rends <b>from above</b> in the normal manner. <br><b>And he</b> may <b>not become ritually impure</b> in the event of the death of <b>his close relatives,</b> but a common priest may. <br><b>And he is commanded to</b> marry a <b>virgin, and he is prohibited from</b> marrying a <b>widow,</b> in contrast to a common priest who is prohibited to marry only a divorcee. <br><b>And</b> his death <b>allows the return of the</b> accidental <b>killer</b> from the city of refuge.",
            "<b>And he sacrifices</b> offerings even when he is <b>an acute mourner,</b> i.e., on the first day of his mourning, <b>but he may not eat</b> from the offerings on that day <b>and he may not take a portion</b> from them. <br><b>And he takes</b> his <b>portion first</b> from any offering of his choice. <br><b>And</b> he has the <b>first</b> right <b>to sacrifice</b> any offering he wants. <br><b>And he serves</b> wearing <b>eight garments.</b> <br><b>And he is exempt from</b> bringing an offering for unwittingly causing <b>ritual impurity to the Temple and its sacred objects.</b> <br><b>And all</b> parts of the <b>Yom Kippur service are valid only</b> when performed <b>by him.</b>",
            "<b>And all these</b> <i>halakhot</i> unique to the High Priest are not limited to one who was consecrated with anointing oil, but <b>apply</b> also to a High Priest <b>of many garments.</b> During the Second Temple period, when the oil used for anointing was no longer available for anointing High Priests, the High Priests were consecrated by virtue of wearing the eight garments. This is true <b>except</b> with regard to <b>the bull brought for all the mitzvot,</b> which is brought only by a High Priest consecrated with anointing oil.",
            "<b>And all these</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>apply to a former High Priest</b> who had been consecrated to substitute for a High Priest who had become disqualified. If the disqualification of the original High Priest is removed, he may return to his position.

            "<b>And none of them applies to the priest anointed for war, except for</b> the <b>five items stated</b> explicitly <b>in the passage</b> about the High Priest (Leviticus 21:10–15): <br>When in mourning, he <b>does not let</b> his hair <b>grow wild nor does he rend</b> his clothing in the way regular mourners do. <br><b>And he</b> may <b>not become ritually impure</b> in the event of the death of <b>his close relatives.</b> <br><b>And he is commanded to</b> marry <b>a virgin, and he is prohibited from</b> marrying <b>a widow.</b> <br><b>And</b> his death <b>allows the return of the</b> accidental <b>killer</b> from the city of refuge, <b>in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Yehuda</b> in tractate <i>Makkot</i> (11a). <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> His death <b>does not allow the return</b> of the accidental killer from the city of refuge.

            "The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>When</b> the High Priest <b>has no animosity</b> toward someone else wearing the same garments, it is only <b>where</b> that person <b>is similar to him,</b> such as a former High Priest who held the same rank.

However, if one swore not to eat at all, his oath takes effect on permitted foods. Consequently, if he eats any food he is liable.",
            "<b>And Reish Lakish said:</b> The only application of this mishna <b>you will find is</b> in a case where one <b>explicitly</b> says that he will not eat <b>a half-measure, and</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> They say that when one swears that he will not eat, he prohibits himself only from eating a whole measure of food. If he eats a half-measure, he has not violated a prohibition. Therefore, in order for a half-measure to be prohibited, he needs to specify this in his oath.

            "<b>And if you say:</b> Perhaps Reish Lakish <b>maintains</b> that <b>since</b> a half-measure <b>is permitted by Torah</b> law, despite the fact that it is prohibited by rabbinic law, one is <b>liable</b> to <b>bring an offering</b> for violating <b>an oath,</b> then there is the following problem: <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: <b>An oath of testimony</b> where one is sworn to give testimony on something that he saw or knew, <b>applies only to those who are eligible to give testimony.</b> If one who is ineligible to testify swears an oath to give testimony, the oath is invalid even if he does not testify. <b>And we discussed it:</b> The statement: Those who are eligible to give testimony, comes <b>to exclude what?</b> After all, it was already said that the oath does not apply to women, relatives, and other disqualified people. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> It comes <b>to exclude a king.</b> A king is not disqualified from giving testimony, but he does not testify before a court, due to the requirement to give respect to a king.",
            "<b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> It comes <b>to exclude one who plays with dice,</b> whom the Sages disqualified from giving testimony. <b>But surely one who plays with dice is eligible by Torah law</b> to give testimony, <b>and</b> it is <b>the Sages</b> who <b>disqualified him.</b> Despite this, <b>an oath of testimony does not apply to him</b> by Torah law, even though the prohibition on his testifying is rabbinic.",

The Torah makes liability for an oath of testimony contingent on one’s ability to testify. Therefore, an oath of testimony would not apply to someone unable to testify. However, one who takes an oath not to eat is liable if he breaks that oath, notwithstanding the rabbinic prohibition against eating less than a measure of forbidden food. Consequently, this rejection does not stand, and the first explanation remains.",

The Gemara rejects this. <b>This is</b> what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: When they said</b> that those five activities are <b>prohibited, they said that only</b> with regard to <b>a half-measure; but</b> a full <b>measure is punishable by <i>karet</i>. And although</b> a violation <b>is punishable by <i>karet</i>, it is punishable by <i>karet</i> only</b> if one <b>eats, or drinks, or performs</b> prohibited <b>labor;</b> these <b>alone</b> are the cases where <i>karet</i> is incurred.",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>when it is taught</b> in the mishna using the language of <b>prohibited,</b> it is referring to <b>the other</b> transgressions, which do not incur <i>karet</i>. <b>As Rabba and Rav Yosef taught this in other books</b> of <b>Rav’s school,</b> i.e., the <i>Sifrei</i>, the halakhic midrash on Numbers and Deuteronomy: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to engage <b>in bathing, and in smearing</b> oil on one’s body, <b>and in wearing shoes, and in having relations on Yom Kippur?

If one continues to eat more, he will eat a whole measure, which is punishable by Torah law. Therefore, even when he eats the first half-measure <b>he is eating forbidden</b> food. <b>Reish Lakish said it is permitted by Torah</b> law. His reason is as follows: With regard to all forbidden foods, <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“Eat,”</b> for example in the verse: “You shall eat neither fat nor blood” (Leviticus 3:17). Eating is defined as consuming a minimum of an olive-bulk, <b>and there is no</b> prohibition if one eats less than an olive-bulk.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish</b> from what was taught in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the prohibition of forbidden fat: <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>anything that is included in the punishment</b> of <i>karet</i> <b>is included in the prohibition.</b> However, one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>there is no prohibition</b> to eat fat of <b>a <i>koy</i>, or a half-measure</b> of forbidden fat, <b>since there is no punishment</b> for those. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “All fat”</b> (Leviticus 7:23), indicating that there is a prohibition to eat any kind of fat, including fat of uncertain status and a half-measure of fat. Therefore, a half-measure of fat is prohibited by Torah law. Reish Lakish rejects this argument: This prohibition is <b>rabbinic, and the verse</b> brought as a proof is <b>a mere support.</b> It cannot be claimed that there is such a prohibition by Torah law.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> to say that the <i>baraita</i> cites only the verse as a support and not as a source to prove the prohibition. <b>For if it could enter your mind</b> that this teaching constitutes a prohibition <b>by Torah law,</b> there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether <b>a <i>koy</i></b> is a wild beast or a domestic animal. Is <b>a verse necessary to include an uncertainty?</b> There is no doubt before God and therefore no purpose in writing a case of doubt in the Torah.

            "§ After clarifying the wording of the mishna, the Gemara brings a halakhic midrash to analyze the mishna’s laws. <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: “And this shall be a statute to you forever: In the seventh month on the tenth day of the month <b>you shall afflict your souls”</b> (Leviticus 16:29). I <b>might</b> have thought that one should <b>sit in the sun or in the cold to suffer</b> and afflict his soul; therefore <b>the</b> continuation of <b>the verse states: “And you shall not do any labor,</b> the home-born, or the stranger that lives among you” (Leviticus 16:29). This teaches that <b>just as</b> prohibited <b>labor is</b> a mitzva that requires one to <b>sit and do nothing,</b> as one is commanded to refrain from action, <b>so too, affliction</b> of one’s <b>soul is also</b> a mitzva requiring one to <b>sit and do nothing.</b> One is not commanded to be proactive in order to afflict his soul. Rather, one must refrain from specified actions such as eating and drinking.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And say that</b> it means that <b>when</b> one <b>sits in the sun and it is</b> too <b>hot for him, we do not say to him: Get up and sit in the shade.</b> Or, if one <b>sits in the shade and it is</b> too <b>cold for him, we do not say to him: Get up and sit in the sun.</b> These are also cases of affliction involving sitting and doing nothing. The Gemara rejects this: It must be <b>similar</b> to the prohibition of <b>labor. Just as</b> with regard to prohibited <b>labor you did not distinguish</b> between situations, since the prohibition is independent of one’s personal circumstance, <b>so too, you do not distinguish</b> with regard to <b>affliction,</b> which is not affected by one’s circumstance.",
            "<b>It was taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that as the verse states: <b>“You shall afflict your souls”</b> (Leviticus 16:29), I <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one</b> must <b>sit in the sun or the cold and be uncomfortable;</b> therefore, <b>the</b> continuation of <b>the verse states: “And you shall not do any labor”</b> (Leviticus 16:29). <b>Just as</b> prohibited <b>labor is something</b> that <b>incurs</b> <i>karet</i> <b>in other circumstances,</b> like Shabbat, <b>so too, affliction</b> relates to acts that <b>in other circumstances incur</b> <i>karet</i>. <b>And what is that</b> circumstance? <b>That is</b> referring to <b><i>piggul</i> and <i>notar</i>,</b> which lead to <i>karet</i> if eaten, and which therefore may not be eaten on Yom Kippur.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>I will include</b> the categories of <b><i>piggul</i> and <i>notar</i>, for which</b> one is punished <b>with <i>karet</i></b> if eaten during the year, <b>but I will not include untithed produce, which does not</b> cause one to incur the punishment <b>of <i>karet</i></b> if eaten. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “You shall afflict”</b> (Leviticus 16:29), and it also states: <b>“And you shall afflict your souls”</b> (Leviticus 16:31). The Torah comes to <b>include</b> another affliction of a serious eating prohibition, i.e. untithed produce.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>I will include untithed produce,</b> for which one receives <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven; <b>but I will not include an</b> unslaughtered <b>animal carcass,</b> which, although it is prohibited for consumption, one who eats it <b>is not</b> punishable by <b>death</b> at the hands of Heaven. Therefore, <b>the verse states “you shall afflict”</b> and also <b>“and you shall afflict your souls.”</b> The Torah <b>includes</b> foods that are associated with a prohibition even if one who eats them is not punishable by death.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>I will include an</b> unslaughtered <b>animal carcass, which</b> is prohibited by <b>a negative mitzva, but I will not include non-sacred,</b> regular food, <b>which is not</b> prohibited by <b>a negative mitzva.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> both <b>“you shall afflict”</b> and <b>“and you shall afflict your souls.”</b> Although non-sacred food is not prohibited in general, the Torah <b>includes</b> it in the prohibition of eating on Yom Kippur.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>I will include non-sacred food, which is not</b> associated with any positive mitzva to <b>arise</b> and <b>eat,</b> i.e., there is no obligation to eat non-sacred food; <b>but I will not include <i>teruma</i>, which</b> one is required to <b>arise</b> and <b>eat,</b> as priests are commanded to eat <i>teruma</i>. Therefore, <b>the verse states “you shall afflict”</b> and <b>“and you shall afflict your souls.”</b> The Torah <b>includes</b> <i>teruma</i> as well in the foods one is prohibited to eat on Yom Kippur. <b>I will include <i>teruma</i>, which is not</b> subject to the command: <b>“You shall not leave over”</b> (Leviticus 22:30), since <i>teruma</i> need not be consumed within a specific time, <b>but I will not include sacred food,</b> which is subject to the command <b>“you shall not leave over”;</b> it is prohibited to leave the meat uneaten after a certain amount of time. Therefore, <b>the verse states “you shall afflict”</b> and <b>“and you shall afflict your souls,”</b> to <b>include</b> the category of sacred food in the prohibition of eating on Yom Kippur. Consequently, the Gemara has demonstrated that it is prohibited to eat any type of food on Yom Kippur.",
            "<b>And if it is your wish to say</b> something to challenge this reasoning, the Gemara brings an additional proof: <b>Surely,</b> the verse <b>states</b> with regard to one who violates Yom Kippur: <b>“I will destroy that soul</b> from among his people” (Leviticus 23:30). Therefore, <b>affliction</b> is something <b>that destroys a soul. And what is that? That is</b> refraining from <b>eating and drinking,</b> since someone who does not eat and drink at all will die. The Torah is not referring to other afflictions that do not lead to death. These are the words of the <i>baraita</i>.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>What is</b> meant by: <b>And if it is your wish to say?</b> What flaw did the first proof have? The Gemara explains: <b>And if you say the verse is discussing</b> relations with <b>those with whom relations are forbidden,</b> avoidance of which is also called affliction, and it is not discussing eating and drinking, <b>the verse states: I will destroy that soul,</b> meaning <b>an affliction that can cause death. And what is that? That is</b> refraining from <b>eating and drinking.</b>",
            "<b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> the following concerning the nature of Yom Kippur: The word <b>affliction is stated here</b> with regard to Yom Kippur, <b>and</b> the word <b>affliction is stated further on</b> in a different place, concerning the Jews in the desert: “And He afflicted you and caused you to hunger” (Deuteronomy 8:3). <b>Just as further on</b> the meaning of <b>affliction</b> is <b>hunger, so too, here,</b> the meaning of the word <b>affliction</b> is <b>hunger.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And let us derive it</b> not from the verse that indicates affliction of hunger but from the verse where Laban warns Jacob: <b>“If you shall afflict my daughters”</b> (Genesis 31:50), which is referring not to hunger but to marital relations. The Gemara answers: <b>We derive affliction</b> commanded to <b>the public</b> on Yom Kippur <b>from affliction</b> relating to <b>the public,</b> i.e., the Jewish people in the desert, <b>and we do not derive affliction</b> of <b>the public from affliction</b> of <b>an individual,</b> as in the case of Jacob’s wives.",
            "The Gemara continues to challenge the view of Rabbi Yishmael: <b>And let us derive</b> it <b>from affliction</b> stated with regard to <b>Egypt, as it is written: “And He saw our affliction”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:7). <b>We say that</b> this verse is referring to <b>abstinence from conjugal relations.</b> The Egyptians prevented the Jewish people from having relations. This affliction is an example of public affliction that is not abstention from eating or drinking. <b>Rather,</b> the prohibition to eat or drink on Yom Kippur should not be learned as stated previously, but as follows: <b>We derive affliction by the hand of God from affliction by the hand of God,</b> i.e., affliction caused directly by God or through His mitzvot; <b>and we do not derive affliction by the hand of God from affliction by the hand of man.</b>",
            "§ Apropos the verse: “And he afflicted you and caused you to hunger, and fed you with manna” (Deuteronomy 8:3), the Gemara expounds related verses. The Torah states: <b>“Who feeds you manna in the desert</b> which your fathers did not know, <b>in order to afflict you”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:16). What affliction was there in eating the manna? <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi</b> disagreed on the matter. <b>One said: There is no comparison between one who has bread in his basket and one who does not have bread in his basket.</b> The affliction in eating the manna lay in there being no leftover food for the next day. Each day the people worried that they might not have any food to eat the next day. <b>And one said: There is no comparison between one who sees</b> the food <b>and eats</b> it <b>and one who does not see</b> the food <b>and eats</b> it. Though the manna could taste like anything, it always looked the same and did not look as it tasted. Being unable to see the food that they tasted was an affliction.",
            "<b>Rav Yosef said: From here</b> there is an <b>allusion</b> to the idea <b>that blind</b> people <b>eat but are not</b> fully <b>satisfied</b> when they eat because they cannot see their food. Seeing the food contributes to the enjoyment of eating. <b>Abaye said: Therefore,</b> from what we have just learned, <b>one who has a meal should eat it only during daytime,</b> when there is light to see the food that is being eaten. <b>Rabbi Zeira said: What is the verse</b> that alludes to this? <b>“Better is the seeing of the eyes than the wandering of the desire”</b> (Ecclesiastes 6:9). On the same verse, <b>Reish Lakish said: The sight of a woman is better than the actual act</b> of relations, <b>as it is stated: “Better is the seeing of the eyes than the wandering of the desire.”</b>",
            "§ Apropos the dispute between Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi, the Gemara continues with another dispute they had with regard to the correct interpretation of a verse. It is stated: “Do not look upon the wine when it is red, <b>when it gives its color in the cup, when it glides down smoothly [<i>bemeisharim</i>]”</b> (Proverbs 23:31). <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi</b> disagreed. <b>One said: Whoever casts</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>his eye on his cup,</b> i.e., is habitually drunk, all the prohibitions of <b>those with whom relations are forbidden seem to him like level [<i>mishor</i>]</b> ground. He is unaware of the pitfalls of sin and continues walking along a twisted and dangerous path. <b>And one said: Whoever casts his eye on his cup, the whole world seems to him like level [<i>mishor</i>] ground.</b> Not only is such a person unconcerned by forbidden sexual relations, but all other prohibitions, e.g., monetary prohibitions, also seem permitted in his eyes.",
            "§ The Gemara explains another verse in Proverbs: <b>“If there is care in a man’s heart, let him quash it [<i>yashḥena</i>]”</b> (Proverbs 12:25). <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi</b> dispute the verse’s meaning. <b>One said: He should forcefully push it [<i>yasḥena</i>] out of his mind.</b> One who worries should banish his concerns from his thoughts. <b>And one said:</b> It means <b>he should tell [<i>yesiḥena</i>] others his</b> concerns, which will lower his anxiety.",
            "§ Another verse states: <b>“And dust shall be the serpent’s food”</b> (Isaiah 65:25). <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi</b> dispute the verse’s meaning. <b>One said: Even if</b> the serpent <b>eats all the delicacies in the world, they will</b> still <b>taste like dust. And one said: Even if it eats all the delicacies in the world, its mind is unsettled until it</b> also <b>eats</b> some <b>dust.</b>",
            "With regard to the same topic, <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei said: Come and see that the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He, is different than the attribute of flesh and blood. The attribute of flesh and blood</b> is that one who seeks to <b>provoke another harasses him</b> in all aspects of <b>his life, but the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not</b> act in <b>this</b> way. <b>He cursed the serpent</b> and what happened? When <b>the serpent goes up to the roof its food is with it,</b> and when <b>it comes down its food is with it.</b> Consequently, the curse that it suffers does not ruin its life but rather benefits it.",
            "Similarly, <b>He cursed Canaan</b> that he should be the servant of servants, but he benefits somewhat from this. <b>He eats what his master eats, and drinks what his master drinks,</b> and does not worry like a free man does. <b>He cursed the woman</b> and <b>everyone pursues her</b> to marry her. <b>He cursed the land</b> after the sin of Adam and Eve, yet <b>everyone is sustained from it.</b> Even when God is angry, He does not punish His creations severely.",
            "The Gemara cites more verses that pertain to the same issue. <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagree with regard to the following verse: <b>“We remember the fish which we ate in Egypt for nothing”</b> (Numbers 11:5). <b>One said:</b> The verse is referring literally to <b>fish. And one said:</b> The verse is referring to incestuous <b>relations</b> that the Torah had not yet forbidden. The people cried once the Torah prohibited certain relatives to them. The Gemara explains: <b>The one who said</b> that the verse is referring to <b>fish</b> bases his explanation on the verse, <b>as it is written “which we ate.”</b> This means what they actually ate. <b>And the one who said</b> that the verse is referring to <b>forbidden sexual relations</b> also bases his explanation on the verse, <b>as it is written “for nothing.”</b> Certainly, the people did not actually eat fish for free.",
            "The Gemara asks: And <b>according to the one who said</b> that it is referring to forbidden <b>relations, but</b> isn’t it <b>written “which we ate”?</b> The Gemara answers: The Torah <b>employed a euphemistic expression.</b> Eating is used as a euphemism for sexual relations, <b>as it is written:</b> “So is the way of an adulterous woman; <b>she eats, and wipes her mouth, and says I have done no wickedness”</b> (Proverbs 30:20). <b>And according to the one who said</b> it is referring to <b>fish, what</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“for nothing”?</b> The people <b>brought the fish from</b> the river, which was <b>ownerless property,</b> since the Egyptians obviously would not have given them free food. <b>The Master said: When the Jews drew water</b> from the river, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, prepared little fish for them in the water.</b> They swam <b>into their jugs.</b>",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that they cried over actual <b>fish but</b> were <b>not promiscuous</b> in having <b>forbidden relations</b> in Egypt, <b>this is what is written</b> to praise the Jewish people: <b>“A garden enclosed is my sister the bride;</b> a locked fountain, a sealed spring” (Song of Songs 4:12). This figurative language teaches that Jewish women are chaste. <b>However, according to the one who said</b> the Jewish people cried over <b>forbidden sexual relations, what</b> does the phrase <b>“a sealed spring”</b> mean? The Gemara answers: It means that they were <b>not promiscuous</b> with <b>those</b> relatives <b>who were</b> already <b>forbidden</b> to them. In Egypt, the Jewish people observed the laws of forbidden sexual relations that are included in the seven Noahide commandments. In the desert, they cried over the additional prohibitions imposed when the Torah was given.",
            "The Gemara asks further: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that they cried over the new prohibitions of <b>forbidden sexual relations, this is as it is written: “And Moses heard the people weeping for their families”</b> (Numbers 11:10). They cried <b>with regard to the issue of their families, because</b> now <b>it became prohibited for them to cohabit with them. But according to the one who says</b> that they cried over <b>fish what</b> does <b>“weeping for their families”</b> mean? The Gemara answers: <b>Both this and that happened.</b> They cried about the laws of forbidden sexual relations, and they also cried because they no longer had the fish of Egypt.",
            "The Gemara returns to the same verse: It states: “We remember…<b>the cucumbers, and the melons,</b> and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic” (Numbers 11:5). <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi</b> debate the verse’s meaning. <b>One said: They tasted the flavor of all types of food in the manna,</b> but they cried because <b>they could not taste the tastes of these five foods</b> that they mentioned. <b>And one said: They tasted the flavor of all types of food,</b> as well as <b>their textures.</b> The sensation was so strong that it seemed to them like they were eating those very foods. However, with the foods they listed, the people tasted only <b>their flavor but not their texture.</b>",
            "With regard to the manna, the Torah further states: <b>“And it was white [<i>lavan</i>] like coriander seed; and its flavor</b> was like wafers made of honey” (Exodus 16:31). The Gemara questions this, since coriander is brown, not white. <b>Rabbi Asi said:</b> The manna was <b>round like coriander</b> seed <b>but white like a pearl. This was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Coriander [<i>gad</i>]</b> is so named <b>because it is similar to flax seeds on their stalks,</b> which are bound [<i>agud</i>] in a bundle.",
            "<b>Others say:</b> It was called <b>coriander [<i>gad</i>] because it is similar to a tale [<i>haggada</i>], which draws a person’s heart</b> toward it, just <b>like water,</b> which is essential for life, draws one. <b>It was taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: Why is it called <b><i>gad</i>? Because it told [<i>maggid</i>] the Jewish people</b> the answer to issues of uncertainty, such as the paternity of a baby. If a woman remarries within two months after her divorce or the death of her husband and gives birth seven months after her remarriage, it is unclear if the baby gestated for seven months and is the son of the second husband or for nine months and is the son of the first husband. The manna would tell them <b>if</b> the baby was born after <b>nine</b> months and belongs to the <b>first</b> husband, <b>or if</b> the baby was born after <b>seven</b> months and belongs to the <b>second</b> husband. Since the manna was collected by each family based on the number of its biological members, the manna established the baby’s paternity.",
            "The manna was called <b>white because it whitened Israel’s sins.</b> The people feared that if they sinned the manna would not continue to fall. Consequently, they devoted themselves to introspection and repentance.",
            "Similarly, <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Just like the prophet would tell the Jewish people what was in the holes and what was in the cracks</b> of their souls, highlighting the sins of the people, <b>so too, the manna clarified for Israel what was in the holes and what was in the cracks.

            "Similarly, if <b>a man and a woman came to Moses for a judgment, he saying: She sinned against me,</b> and therefore I may divorce her and am not obligated to pay her divorce settlement, <b>and she saying: He sinned against me</b> and therefore I am entitled to the full settlement from the marriage contract, <b>Moses</b> would <b>say to them: In the morning there will be a judgment. The following day, if her <i>omer</i></b> of manna <b>was found in her husband’s house, it would be clear that she sinned against him.</b> The fact that her nourishment was given to his household signifies the fact that he has respected her appropriately and is worthy of nourishing her. <b>If her <i>omer</i></b> of manna <b>was found in her father’s house, it would be clear that he sinned against her.</b> Her nourishment has not been given to his household, signifying that he has been disrespectful to her and is not worthy of nourishing her.",
            "§ The Gemara continues to discuss the manna: <b>It is written: “And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it”</b> (Numbers 11:9). <b>And it is written: “And the people shall go out and gather</b> a day’s portion every day” (Exodus 16:4). <b>And it is written: “The people went about and gathered it”</b> (Numbers 11:8). <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled?

The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>“every morning”?

            "§ It is told: <b>Rabbi Tarfon, and Rabbi Yishmael, and the Elders were sitting and discussing the passage about the manna and Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i was sitting among them. Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i responded and said: The manna that fell for the Jewish people was sixty cubits high.

            "<b>He said to him: Rabbi, I am interpreting a verse.</b> How so? It states about the Flood: <b>“Fifteen cubits above did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered”</b> (Genesis 7:20). <b>Is it possible that it would be fifteen cubits</b> high <b>from a valley, fifteen</b> cubits <b>from the plain,</b> and <b>fifteen</b> cubits <b>from the mountains?

Afterward,</b> the verse states that <b>“fifteen cubits above did the waters prevail.”</b>",
            "Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i continues: <b>But which attribute is greater, the attribute of goodness or the attribute of retribution? One must say the attribute of goodness</b> is greater <b>than the attribute of retribution. With regard to the attribute of retribution,</b> in the case of the Flood, the verse <b>states: “And the windows of heaven were opened”</b> (Genesis 7:11), which indicates that there were only windows. Whereas, <b>with regard to the attribute of goodness,</b> in the case of the manna, the verse <b>states: “He commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven, and rained down manna upon them to eat and gave them heavenly grain”</b> (Psalms 78:23–24).",
            "Based on this, the Gemara calculates: The area of <b>how many windows are in a door? Four.</b> A door is equivalent to four windows in size. One adds another <b>four</b> for the second door, as the verse uses the plural “doors,” which implies that there were two doors. <b>This equals</b> the area of <b>eight</b> windows. If the depth of water in the Flood is based on the phrase “windows of heaven,” implying two windows, then the manna fell at a rate four times that of the water of the Flood. Since the water of the Flood reached a depth of fifteen cubits, <b>it turns out that the manna that fell for the Jewish people was sixty cubits high,</b> i.e., four times as high.",
            "Similarly, <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Isi ben Yehuda said: The manna that fell for the Jewish people would accumulate and ascend until all the kings of the East and West could see it, as it is stated: “You prepared a table before me in the presence of my enemies;</b> you anointed my head with oil; <b>my cup runs over”</b> (Psalms 23:5).

            "The Gemara asks how Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i can compare the depth of the Flood waters with the amount of manna that fell in the desert: <b>This is not similar,</b> and the calculation is inaccurate. <b>There,</b> in the case of the Flood, the water rose fifteen cubits in <b>forty days;</b> but <b>here,</b> in the case of the manna, it took only <b>one hour</b> every day to fall.

            "§ The mishna taught that as per the five prohibited activities on Yom Kippur it is <b>prohibited</b> to engage <b>in eating</b> and in drinking, and in bathing, and in smearing the body with oil, and in wearing shoes, and in conjugal relations. The Gemara asks: <b>These five afflictions</b> of Yom Kippur, to <b>what</b> do they <b>correspond?</b> Where is the Torah source or allusion to them? <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> They are based on <b>the five</b> times that the <b>afflictions</b> of Yom Kippur are mentioned <b>in the Torah.</b> It is stated: (1) <b>“And on the tenth</b> of this seventh month you shall have a holy convocation, and you shall afflict your souls” (Numbers 29:7); (2) <b>“But on the tenth</b> of this seventh month is the day of atonement, it shall be a holy convocation for you and you shall afflict your souls” (Leviticus 23:27); (3) “It shall be for you <b>a Shabbat of solemn rest,</b> and you shall afflict your souls (Leviticus 23:32); (4) <b>“It is a Shabbat of solemn rest [<i>shabbaton</i>]</b> for you, and you shall afflict your souls” (Leviticus 16:31); (5) <b>“And it shall be</b> a statute <b>for you</b> forever, in the seventh month on the tenth of the month, you shall afflict your souls” (Leviticus 16:29).",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Are these five</b> the only afflictions? <b>We learn</b> in the mishna that there are <b>six:</b> Eating, drinking, bathing, smearing oil, conjugal relations, and wearing shoes. The Gemara answers: <b>Drinking is included in</b> the prohibition of <b>eating;</b> both together are considered a single affliction. <b>As Reish Lakish said: From where do we derive that drinking is included in</b> the concept of <b>eating? As it is stated: “And you shall eat before the Lord your God,</b> in the place where He shall choose to cause His name to dwell there, <b>the tithe of your grain,</b> of <b>your wine [<i>tirosh</i>], and</b> of <b>your oil”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:23). <b><i>Tirosh</i> is wine,</b> yet the verse <b>calls</b> the drinking of wine eating with the phrase <b>“and you shall eat,”</b> meaning that eating also refers to drinking.",
            "The Gemara rejects this answer: <b>From where</b> do you draw this conclusion? <b>Perhaps</b> the wine <b>was eaten as <i>anigron</i>,</b> a sauce made of oil, beet juice, and garum mixed with wine. As <b>Rabba bar Shmuel said: <i>Anigron</i></b> is <b>beet juice</b> and wine mixed together. <b><i>Akhsigron</i></b> is <b>water that comes from boiled vegetables</b> that have wine mixed into them.

            "The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>From where</b> do you draw this conclusion? <b>Perhaps here too it was eaten as <i>anigron</i>?</b> The Gemara rejects this: Here that answer is insufficient because the verse <b>writes “strong drink [<i>sheikhar</i>],”</b> meaning <b>something</b> that <b>intoxicates.</b> Beverages that generally intoxicate do not do so when they are in a mixture. The Gemara asks: <b>Perhaps</b> <i>sheikhar</i> does not refer to wine but to a food that causes intoxication, such as <b>a sweet dried fig from Keilah.

            "The Gemara returns to the meaning of the word <i>tirosh</i>: <b>Is <i>tirosh</i> wine? Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One</b> who <b>vows</b> not to benefit <b>from <i>tirosh</i> is not allowed sweet foods,</b> e.g., sweet fruits, <b>but is allowed wine.</b> Therefore, <i>tirosh</i> is not wine but sweet food. The Gemara rejects this: <b>And is</b> <i>tirosh</i> <b>not wine? But isn’t it written: “<i>Tirosh</i> shall make the young women flourish [<i>yenovev</i>]”</b> (Zechariah 9:17). The word <i>yenovev</i> comes from the word <i>niv</i>, speech. Consequently, <i>tirosh</i> is a food that tempts the heart and mouth of the drinker, even of virgins, who are modest and reticent. Since sweet foods do not have this effect, <i>tirosh</i> must be wine. The Gemara replies: This is not a proof, since we could explain it otherwise: <b>Something that comes from <i>tirosh</i>,</b> such as wine, <b>causes virgins to come forth;</b> <i>tirosh</i> itself means sweet grapes. Perhaps wine is called <i>tirosh</i> only by extension because it is made from <i>tirosh</i>.",
            "The Gemara challenges this: <b>But isn’t it written: “And your vats shall overflow with <i>tirosh</i>”</b> (Proverbs 3:10). This description implies that <i>tirosh</i> is wine rather than sweet grapes. The Gemara answers: This too is not a proof that <i>tirosh</i> means wine. We could say that <b>the vats shall overflow with something that comes from <i>tirosh</i>,</b> i.e., wine; yet <i>tirosh</i> itself means sweet fruits.",
            "The Gemara objects: <b>But it is written: “Harlotry, and wine, and <i>tirosh</i> take away the heart”</b> (Hosea 4:11). Since <i>tirosh</i> leads the heart astray, it is clear that it is wine. Therefore, the Gemara accepts that <i>tirosh</i> means wine. <b>Rather, according to everyone,</b> the word <b><i>tirosh</i></b> in the Bible refers to <b>wine, but vows follow colloquial language.</b> During the time of the Mishna, <i>tirosh</i> meant sweet fruits; the term included grapes but not wine. When dealing with vows, the intention of the speaker is what must be determined, but no inference can be drawn from colloquial language to the biblical definition of the word.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> if so, <b>why does</b> the Bible <b>call</b> it <b>wine</b> and <b>why does it call it <i>tirosh</i>?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>“Wine”</b> suggests <b>that it brings lament to the world</b> because drunkenness causes most sins. There is a phonetic resemblance between the <i>yayin</i>, wine, and <i>ta’aniya va’aniya</i>, sorrow and howling, which Rashi (on Job 2:5) explains as lament. <b>“<i>Tirosh</i>”</b> shows <b>that those who indulge in it become poor [<i>rash</i>].</b>",
            "<b>Rav Kahana raised a contradiction: It is written</b> as <b><i>tirash</i> but we read it <i>tirosh</i>.</b> This should be understood as follows: If <b>one merits</b> and drinks appropriately, <b>he is made a head [<i>rosh</i>];</b> if <b>one does not merit</b> and does not drink appropriately, <b>he is made poor [<i>rash</i>].</b> The Gemara comments: <b>This is the same as</b> what <b>Rava</b> said, as <b>Rava raised a contradiction: It is written:</b> “And wine that <b>makes glad [<i>yishamaḥ</i>]</b> the heart of man” (Psalms 104:15) with a <i>shin</i>, but <b>we read it <i>yisamaḥ</i></b> with a <i>sin</i>.

            "<b>We have found</b> proof that abstaining from <b>smearing</b> oil on oneself is considered affliction; <b>from where do we</b> derive that abstaining from <b>bathing</b> is also called affliction? <b>Rav Zutra, son of Rabbi Toviya, said: The verse states: “And it came into his innards like water, and like oil into his bones”</b> (Psalms 109:18).

The Gemara objects: <b>But say</b> that “came into his innards like water” is referring to <b>drinking</b> rather than smearing oil. The Gemara rejects this: <b>It is similar</b> to <b>oil.

            "<b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Michael,</b> the ministering angel of the Jewish people: <b>Michael, your nation has sinned</b> (see Daniel 10:21). <b>He replied: Master of the Universe,</b> may <b>it be enough for the good</b> people <b>among them</b> to save them from destruction. <b>He said to him: I will burn them and the good among them</b> because the good do not rebuke the wicked. <b>Immediately,</b> God spoke to Gabriel: <b>“He spoke to the man clothed in linen and said: Go in between the wheelwork and beneath the cherub, and fill your hands with coals of fire from between the cherubs, and scatter them over the city; and he came before my eyes”</b> (Ezekiel 10:2). <b>Immediately: “And the cherub stretched out his hand from between the cherubs into the fire that was between the cherubs, and took and put it into the hands of him that was clothed in linen, who took it and went out”</b> (Ezekiel 10:7).",
            "<b>Rav Ḥana bar Bizna said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon Ḥasida said: If it were not for the fact that the embers cooled</b> as they were passed <b>from the hand of the cherub to the hand of Gabriel,</b> instead of Gabriel taking the embers directly himself as he had been told, <b>not a remnant or a refugee of the enemies of the Jewish people,</b> a euphemism for the Jewish people themselves, <b>would have survived.</b> The cooling of the embers limited the punishment.",
            "The Gemara continues. <b>And it is written: “And behold, the man clothed in linen with the slate by his side, reported the matter saying: I have done as You have commanded me”</b> (Ezekiel 9:11). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: At that moment, they cast out Gabriel from behind the curtain [<i>pargod</i>],</b> where the inner angels reside, <b>and they struck him with sixty blows [<i>pulsei</i>] of fire. They said to him: If you did not do it, you did not do it; if you did do it, why did you not do it according to what you were commanded</b> but deviated from what you were instructed to do? <b>Moreover,</b> after <b>you already did it, do you not have</b> knowledge of the principle: <b>One should not deliver</b> a report <b>about destruction?</b> If one is sent on a mission of destruction, he should not deliver a detailed report of its success but should only hint at it.",
            "<b>They</b> then <b>brought Dubiel, the ministering angel of the Persians and put him in the place of [<i>baḥarikei</i>]</b> Gabriel <b>and he served for twenty-one days.

Corresponding to those twenty-one days, <b>they gave him,</b> the ministering angel of Persia, <b>twenty-one kings</b> who ruled and <b>the seaport</b> of <b>Mashhig.</b>",
            "The ministering angel of the Persians <b>said: Write for me that the Jews</b> must pay <b>taxes [<i>akarga</i>]</b> to the Persians. <b>They wrote it for him</b> as he asked.

            "<b>He came</b> and <b>found Dubiel</b> the ministering angel of the Persians <b>holding the letter in his hand.</b> Gabriel <b>wanted to take</b> the letter <b>from him,</b> but Dubiel <b>swallowed it.

            "§ The Gemara returns to the issue of whether refraining from bathing is considered affliction. <b>If you wish, say</b> instead: The fact <b>that bathing is considered affliction, from where do we</b> derive this? <b>As it is written: “And to Ebiathar the priest the king said: Get to Anatoth to your fields, for you are deserving of death. But I will not put you to death today, because you carried the Ark of the Lord God before David my father, and because you have been afflicted in all that my father was afflicted”</b> (I Kings 2:26). <b>And it is written with regard to David: “For they said the people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty in the wilderness”</b> (II Samuel 17:29). <b>Hunger</b> means <b>from</b> lack of <b>bread</b> to eat, <b>and thirst</b> means <b>from</b> lack of <b>water</b> to drink. The word <b>weary</b> means lack <b>from what? Is it not from bathing?</b> The comparison of the verses suggests that that too is affliction. The Gemara challenges: <b>And perhaps</b> “weary” means from lack of <b>wearing shoes?</b> Therefore, this does not teach us that refraining from bathing is considered an affliction.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> another source needs to be found. <b>Rav Yitzḥak said:</b> It can be derived <b>from here: “As cold water on a weary soul,</b> so is good news from a far country” (Proverbs 25:25). This implies that the word weary is used to describe someone who has not bathed. The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps</b> the verse is referring to weariness <b>from</b> not <b>drinking?</b> The Gemara rejects this: <b>Is it written: As cold water in a weary soul?</b> That would mean that it entered one like a drink. Rather, <b>“on a weary soul” is written,</b> which implies bathing.",
            "§ The Gemara clarifies the next point in the mishna: The fact that not <b>wearing shoes</b> is considered an affliction, <b>from where do we</b> derive this? <b>As it is written: “And David went up by the ascent of the Mount of Olives, and wept as he went up, and he had his head covered, and was walking barefoot”</b> (II Samuel 15:30). <b>Barefoot</b> implies a lack <b>of what? Is it not</b> a lack <b>of wearing shoes?</b> All these deprivations are described as affliction. The Gemara rejects this: No, <b>perhaps</b> he was barefoot <b>from a horse and whip.</b> Even if he was wearing shoes, a king without a horse and whip was considered as if he were going barefoot.",
            "<b>Rather, Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> We learn it <b>from here,</b> as it states: <b>“Go and loose the sackcloth from your loins, and remove your shoe from your foot”</b> (Isaiah 20:2). <b>And it is written: “And he did so, walking naked and barefoot”</b> (Isaiah 20:2). <b>Barefoot</b> implies a lack <b>of what? Is it not</b> a lack of <b>wearing shoes?</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>And say</b> that perhaps the meaning of barefoot is that Isaiah walked <b>with patched shoes. Because if you do not say this,</b> but you claim that the verse is to be understood literally, does “naked” mean <b>actually naked? Rather,</b> the meaning is that Isaiah walked in <b>ragged garments. Here too,</b> the meaning is that he walked <b>in patched shoes.</b>",
            "<b>Rather,</b> a different source must be found. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that we derive it <b>from here:</b> It states: <b>“Withhold your foot from being barefoot, and your throat from thirst”</b> (Jeremiah 2:25), meaning: <b>Keep yourself from sin, so that your feet will not come to be barefoot; keep your tongue from idle talk, so that your throat will not come to be thirsty.</b> Consequently, we learn that being barefoot is considered an affliction.",
            "§ The Gemara continues to clarify another of the afflictions of Yom Kippur: <b>From where do we</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> that refraining from <b>conjugal relations is called affliction? As it is written,</b> Laban said to Jacob: <b>“If you shall afflict my daughters, and if you shall take</b> other <b>wives</b> beside my daughters” (Genesis 31:50)."
        ],
        [
            "This can be explained as: <b>“If you shall afflict</b> my daughters” by refraining <b>from conjugal relations, “and if you shall take</b> other wives” causing them to suffer <b>from</b> additional <b>rival</b> wives. The Gemara objects: <b>And say that this</b> phrase <b>and that</b> phrase are both referring to taking <b>rival</b> wives. The Gemara rejects this: <b>Is it written: If you take? “And if you shall take” is written.</b> Therefore, the clauses must be referring to two different kinds of affliction.",
            "The Gemara challenges further: <b>And say that this</b> phrase <b>and that</b> phrase <b>are referring to</b> taking <b>rival</b> wives. <b>One</b> phrase is referring to <b>his</b> wives’ current <b>rivals.</b> “If you shall afflict” means that Jacob should not elevate the position of the two maidservants, Bilhah and Zilpah, to the status of wife, which would make them co-wives with Laban’s daughters. <b>And one</b> phrase is referring to <b>rivals who</b> might <b>come to him from the world</b> at large, which would be <b>similar</b> in meaning to <b>“if you shall take.”</b> The Gemara rejects this: <b>Is it written: If you take and if you afflict?</b> It is logical to first state the more severe warning and then the less severe one. But according to this proposed reading that “take” refers to rivals from the world at large and “afflict” refers to elevating the status of maidservants, the text would have first mentioned the less painful affliction of elevating the maidservants and then followed it with a warning about taking new rival wives, as <b>“if you shall afflict and if you shall take” is written.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: But conjugal relations themselves are called affliction, as it is written:</b> “And Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her; and he took her, <b>and he lay with her and afflicted her”</b> (Genesis 34:2). If so, how can it be said that the affliction is in withholding conjugal relations? <b>He said to him: There,</b> Shechem <b>afflicted her from different relations,</b> meaning he slept with her in an unnatural way. That type of relations is clearly an affliction.",
            "§ The Gemara clarifies some of the prohibitions relating to Yom Kippur. <b>The Sages taught: It is prohibited to bathe part of the body</b> just as it is prohibited to bathe <b>the whole body. But if one is dirty from mud or excrement, he</b> may <b>bathe in his</b> usual <b>manner, and he</b> need <b>not be concerned</b> about transgressing, since his goal is not pleasure.

            "<b>They said about Shammai the Elder that he did not want to feed</b> his children <b>with one hand,</b> to avoid having to wash it.

            "§ Apropos the river that will flow in the future, the Gemara explains additional verses in Ezekiel. <b>One might think</b> that Ezekiel <b>could cross</b> the river <b>by swimming.

            "The Gemara continues its discussion of the river that will in the future come out of the Holy of Holies. <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Pazi said: Even the Angel of Death does not have permission to pass through it</b> to the other side of this river, and proof of this is in the verse, <b>as it is written here: “No galley with oars [<i>ani shayt</i>] can travel” and</b> as <b>it was written there:</b> “Then Satan answered the Lord and said: <b>From going to and fro [<i>mishut</i>] the earth</b> and from walking up and down in it” (Job 1:7).

            "§ The Gemara investigates the permissibility of crossing water in order to fulfill a mitzva: It works out <b>well</b> that on <b>Yom Kippur</b> it is permitted because <b>there are no shoes,</b> and there is no problem going through water barefoot.

Are priests who are Torah scholars also suspected of inflicting blemishes? <b>Or perhaps the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel,</b> who <b>said:</b> One who is suspect <b>is believed about his fellow but is not believed about himself.

            "<b>Rava said:</b> This entire line of questioning has no basis: <b>There,</b> in the incident of the <i>sukka</i>, <b>this is the reasoning</b> that the <i>halakha</i> permits eating the dates outside of the <i>sukka</i>, <b>due to</b> the fact that dates <b>are fruit, and fruit need not</b> be eaten in <b>a <i>sukka</i></b> but may be eaten outside of a <i>sukka</i>.

            "Until now, the Gemara has assumed that the volume of a large date is more than that of an egg. <b>Rav Zevid</b> disagreed with what was mentioned earlier and <b>said:</b> This is not so. Rather, <b>the volume of a large date that they spoke</b> of <b>is less than an egg-bulk, as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> With regard to <b>leaven,</b> the sourdough used to make dough rise, ownership of <b>the volume of an olive-bulk</b> violates the prohibitions in the following verses stated regarding Passover: “And no leavened bread shall be seen with you” (Exodus 13:7) and “Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses” (Exodus 12:19). However, the amount of <b>leavened bread</b> that must be owned to violate the prohibition <b>is the volume of a large date.</b>",
            "The Gemara continues. <b>And we discussed it: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Beit Shammai?</b> If both leaven and leavened bread had the same measure that determines liability, <b>let the Merciful One write</b> only: <b>“Leavened bread,” and</b> He would <b>not need</b> to write: <b>“Leaven.” I would say,</b> based on logic: <b>If leavened bread, whose leavening ability is</b> not as <b>strong, is prohibited</b> at <b>an olive-bulk, all the more so</b> should <b>not leaven, whose leavening ability is strong</b> because it causes dough to rise, be also prohibited at an olive-bulk? Since <b>the Merciful One distinguishes</b> between <b>them</b> and states both “leaven” and “leavened bread,” this <b>taught you</b> that <b>the measure for one is not</b> the same as <b>the measure for the other.</b> The measure that determines liability for <b>leaven</b> is <b>an olive-bulk,</b> like in the case of most prohibitions from the Torah, and the measure that determines liability for <b>leavened bread,</b> whose leavening ability is weaker, is the <b>volume of a large date.</b>",

            "<b>Rather,</b> it cannot be proven from here.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And what</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mean when it says: <b>A proof for this</b> is from <b>Yom Kippur?</b> Why is the verse pertaining to ritual impurity not sufficient to show that the Sages changed the measure based on the different words in the verse?

Rabbi Abbahu said that Rabbi Elazar said that the verse states: “Of all food [<i>okhel</i>] which may be eaten [<i>ye’akhel</i>],</b> on which water comes shall be ritually impure” (Leviticus 11:34). The double usage of the root <i>akhal</i> teaches that the ritual impurity of food applies even to the amount which can be described as <b>food that comes on account of food,</b> i.e., food that comes from another food. <b>And which</b> food <b>is that? A chicken egg.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And say</b> it is referring to <b>a kid,</b> which comes from a mother goat, and is therefore also food that comes from another food. The Gemara answers: <b>It lacks ritual slaughter.</b> The young goat is not yet food, since it is not edible until it has been slaughtered. The Gemara asks further: <b>And say</b> it is referring to <b>a <i>ben pekua</i>.</b> Since the slaughter of its mother made it fit to eat, the fetus itself need not be slaughtered, even if it survives and continues to live independently of its mother. The Gemara answers: The calf still <b>requires cutting,</b> since it cannot be eaten live, but it does not require ritual slaughter.",
            "The Gemara asks: Even if we claim that the measure for impure foods is an egg-bulk, one could <b>say</b> it is referring to the giant <b>egg</b>-<b>bulk</b> of the bird called <b><i>bar yokhani</i>.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>If you grasped many, you did not grasp anything; if you grasped few, you grasped something.</b> This means that in a case of doubt, take the smaller number, as it is included in the larger number.

They would consider me a thief and learn from my behavior that one is permitted to steal. <b>Abaye said: They taught this</b> statement of Rav <b>only in a place where they do not ask</b> for the money, where it is not customary for the butcher himself to come and collect payment from the customer. When the customer does not pay immediately, people may suspect him of theft. <b>But in a place where they ask</b> for the money from the customer some time later, <b>we have no</b> problem <b>with</b> doing this.

Indeed, the Torah states: “Her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife after she has been made impure” (Deuteronomy 24:4). The relationship between the Jewish people and the Holy One, Blessed be He, is compared to that between a husband and wife. Just as it is prohibited for an adulterous wife to return to her husband, it should be prohibited for the Jewish people to return to God from their sins, yet repentance overrides this prohibition.",

            "Furthermore, during confession, <b>one must detail the sin</b> he committed and not suffice with a general admission of sin, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And Moses returned to the Lord and said: <b>Please, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made themselves a god of gold”</b> (Exodus 32:31); this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava.

            "It is further related that <b>Rav had a complaint against a certain butcher</b> who insulted him. <b>The butcher did not come before him</b> to apologize. <b>On Yom Kippur eve,</b> Rav <b>said: I will go</b> and <b>appease him.

        [
            "<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> Rav’s uncle and teacher, <b>came in,</b> whereupon Rav <b>returned to the beginning</b> of the portion and began to read it again. Afterward, <b>bar Kappara came in,</b> and Rav <b>returned to the beginning</b> of the portion out of respect for bar Kappara. Then <b>Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>came in,</b> and <b>he returned</b> again <b>to the beginning</b> of the portion. Then, <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Ḥama came in,</b> and Rav <b>said</b> to himself: <b>Shall I go back</b> and read <b>so many times? He did not return</b> but continued from where he was. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina was offended</b> because Rav showed that he was less important than the others. <b>Rav went before</b> Rabbi Ḥanina <b>on Yom Kippur eve</b> every year for <b>thirteen</b> years to appease him, <b>but he would not be appeased.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>How could</b> Rav <b>act this way? Didn’t Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina say: Anyone who requests forgiveness from another should not ask more than three times?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rav is different,</b> since he was very pious and forced himself to act beyond the letter of the law. The Gemara asks: <b>And how could Rabbi Ḥanina act this way</b> and refuse to forgive Rav, though he asked many times? <b>Didn’t Rava say:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who suppresses his honor</b> and forgives someone for hurting him, God <b>pardons all his sins?</b>",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>Rather,</b> this is what happened: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina saw in a dream</b> that <b>Rav was being hung on a palm tree, and</b> he <b>learned</b> as a tradition that <b>anyone</b> about whom there is a dream in <b>which he was being hung on a palm tree will become the head</b> of a yeshiva. <b>He said: Learn from this that </b>providence has decreed that <b>he must eventually become the head</b> of the yeshiva. Therefore, <b>I will not be appeased, so that he will have to go and study Torah in Babylonia.</b> He was conscious of the principle that one kingdom cannot overlap with another, and he knew that once Rav was appointed leader, he, Rabbi Ḥanina, would have to abdicate his own position or die. Therefore, he delayed being appeased, so that Rav would go to Babylonia and be appointed there as head of the yeshiva. In this way, the dream would be fulfilled, as Rav would indeed be appointed as head of a yeshiva, but since he would be in Babylonia, Rabbi Ḥanina would not lose his own position.",
            "§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> The main <b>mitzva of confession</b> is on <b>Yom Kippur eve when darkness</b> falls. <b>But the Sages said:</b> One should also <b>confess</b> on Yom Kippur eve <b>before he eats and drinks</b> at his last meal before the fast <b>lest he become confused at the meal,</b> due to the abundance of food and drink, and be unable to confess afterward. <b>And although one confessed before he ate and drank, he confesses</b> again <b>after he eats and drinks,</b> as <b>perhaps he committed some sin during the meal</b> itself. <b>And although one confessed</b> during <b>the evening prayer</b> on the night of Yom Kippur, <b>he</b> should <b>confess</b> again during <b>the morning prayer.</b> Likewise, although one confessed during the <b>morning prayer, he</b> should still <b>confess during</b> the <b>additional prayer.</b> Similarly, although one confessed <b>during</b> the <b>additional prayer, he</b> should also <b>confess during</b> the <b>afternoon prayer;</b> and although one confessed <b>during</b> the <b>afternoon prayer, he</b> should <b>confess</b> again <b>during</b> the <b>closing prayer [<i>ne’ila</i>].</b>",

            "<b>Rav said: The <i>ne’ila</i> prayer exempts</b> one from <b>the evening prayer.</b> Since one recited an added prayer after the afternoon prayer, when darkness fell, it serves as the evening prayer.

One is exempt even if he does not pray the closing prayer. The Gemara answers: <b>He said this in accordance with the statement of the one who says</b> that the evening prayer <b>is mandatory.</b> Even according to the opinion that maintains that the evening prayer is mandatory, if one recites <i>ne’ila</i>, he has fulfilled his obligation to recite the evening prayer.",
            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from that which we learned in a <i>baraita</i>: During the <b>evening</b> after <b>Yom Kippur, one prays seven</b> blessings in the <i>Amida</i> <b>and confesses;</b> during the <b>morning prayer,</b> one prays <b>seven</b> blessings in the <i>Amida</i> <b>and confesses;</b> during the <b>additional prayer,</b> one prays <b>seven</b> blessings in the <i>Amida</i> <b>and confesses; during <i>ne’ila</i> one prays seven</b> blessings in the <i>Amida</i> <b>and confesses;</b> and during <b>the evening prayer,</b> one prays <b>seven</b> blessings <b>in</b> an <b>abridged</b> version of the <b>eighteen</b> blessings of the weekday <i>Amida</i> prayer. One recites the first three blessings, the final three, and a middle blessing that includes an abbreviated form of the other weekday blessings. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel</b> says <b>in the name of his ancestors: One prays</b> the <b>full eighteen</b> blessings of the weekday <i>Amida</i> prayer as usual,"
        ],
        [
            "<b>because he must recite <i>havdala</i> in</b> the blessing: <b>Who graciously grants knowledge,</b> and there is nowhere to insert this prayer in the abridged <i>Amida</i>.

The Gemara answers: <b>It is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Anyone who requires immersion immerses in his</b> usual <b>manner on Yom Kippur,</b> as this act does not violate the prohibition against <b>washing. A menstruating woman and a new mother,</b> who immerse at night, <b>immerse in their</b> usual <b>manner on the night of Yom Kippur.</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>One who had a seminal emission</b> during Yom Kippur before the afternoon prayer may <b>immerse at any point</b> in the day <b>until the afternoon prayer,</b> in order to be able to recite it. Ezra decreed that a man who has had a seminal emission must immerse in order to pray and study Torah. If the emission occurred after the afternoon prayer, he should not immerse then but should wait until darkness falls. Since the time for <i>ne’ila</i> is at night, this individual should wait and immerse after the fast has concluded, so as to avoid violation of the prohibition of washing on Yom Kippur, and then pray afterward. This indicates that <i>ne’ila</i> is a nighttime prayer, and therefore its recitation exempts one from the weekday evening prayer. <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> He may immerse <b>at any point in the day.</b> According to his opinion, the <i>ne’ila</i> prayer is recited while it is still daytime, and therefore the individual must immerse in the daytime in order to be able to recite it. Consequently, Rabbi Yosei holds that <i>ne’ila</i> does not exempt one from the evening prayer.",
            "The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> with regard to this <i>baraita</i> from that which was taught: In the case of <b>the <i>zav</i>, and the <i>zava</i>, the male and female leper, and one who had relations with a menstruating woman, and one who is ritually impure</b> through contact with <b>a corpse,</b> if their time has come for purification, they <b>immerse in their</b> usual <b>manner on Yom Kippur.

            "The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> statement, in which Rabbi Yosei says that one may not immerse during the day, is referring to a case <b>where he</b> had already <b>prayed the <i>ne’ila</i> prayer</b> before he noticed his seminal emission. <b>That</b> statement, in which Rabbi Yosei says that one may immerse during the day, is referring to a case <b>where he had not</b> yet <b>prayed</b> the <i>ne’ila</i> prayer when he noticed his seminal emission, and he therefore immerses in order to pray <i>ne’ila</i>.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If he had already prayed</b> <i>ne’ila</i> before he noticed his seminal emission, <b>what is the reasoning of the Rabbis,</b> who permit him to immerse on Yom Kippur? The immersion seems to have no purpose. The Gemara answers: <b>The Rabbis hold that immersion at its proper time</b> is <b>a mitzva,</b> even when one does not need to immerse to pray. Therefore, if the time for immersion falls on Yom Kippur, the individual should immerse as usual.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>By inference, Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that immersion at its proper time is <b>not a mitzva. But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If</b> God’s <b>name is written</b> in ink on one’s <b>flesh, he</b> may <b>not wash and he</b> may <b>not smear</b> it with oil lest he erase the name, <b>and he</b> may <b>not stand in a filthy place</b> out of respect for the name. <b>If his time came for an immersion</b> that is <b>a mitzva,</b> he must try to ensure that the name not be erased.

            "<b>And we maintain</b> that <b>they disagree as to</b> whether or not <b>immersion at its</b> proper <b>time is a mitzva.</b> According to the Rabbis, immersion at its proper time is not a mitzva. Therefore, if the individual has no reed, he should wait even until the following day rather than immerse without it. However, Rabbi Yosei maintains that immersion at its proper time is a mitzva. Therefore, it must be done at its proper time, even if that requires immersion without covering God’s name.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> Rabbi Yosei mentioned in the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> actually <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda,</b> and this resolves the contradiction, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda says: It is sufficient for the immersion to be at the end.</b> According to one opinion, if a menstruating woman is uncertain on which day to immerse, she immerses multiple times to ensure that the required immersion is at its proper time. However, according to Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda, it is sufficient for her to immerse once at a point when she is certainly pure. Consequently, according to his opinion, there is no mitzva to immerse at the proper time.",
            "<b>The Sages taught: One who sees</b> an emission of <b>semen on Yom Kippur descends and immerses.

What was, was.</b> Since he has already immersed, how will removing interpositions afterward benefit the immersion? <b>Rather, say</b> that <b>he should rub</b> his skin <b>from the evening</b> before Yom Kippur to remove any obstructions, in case it becomes necessary to immerse on Yom Kippur. The Gemara comments: <b>This</b> Master <b>holds</b> that <b>it is a mitzva to rub.</b>",
            "§ Apropos the <i>halakhot</i> of immersion for one who has had a seminal emission on Yom Kippur, the Gemara relates: <b>A <i>tanna</i> taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Naḥman:</b> With regard to <b>one who sees</b> an emission of <b>semen on Yom Kippur, his sins are forgiven.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>His sins are arranged</b> before him? The Gemara answers: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>arranged? They are arranged</b> to be <b>forgiven.</b>",
            "<b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: One who sees</b> an emission of <b>semen on Yom Kippur should worry the whole year</b> that perhaps he was given a sign that he and his fast were rejected. <b>But if he survives the year, he can be assured</b> that his good deeds protected him and ensured for him <b>a share</b> in <b>the World-to-Come.
