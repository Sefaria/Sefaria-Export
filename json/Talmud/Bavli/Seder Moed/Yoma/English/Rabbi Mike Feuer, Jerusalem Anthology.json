            " Has it not been taught:  “…upon a house in the land of your possession,” (Vayikra 14:34) which means that the house of the land of your possession can become defiled through leprosy, but Jerusalem cannot.  R’ Yehudah said  ‘I have only heard that the place of the Sanctuary (mikdash) is unaffected by the law of leprosy?  That implies that synagogues and houses of learning are subject to the law of leprosy, even though they are in large cities!  Read it as:  R’ Yehudah said ‘I have only heard that sacred places (mekudash) are not subject to the law of leprosy. ",
            "What principle are they disputing?  The first Tanna holds  Jerusalem was not divided among the tribes and R’ Yehudah holds  Jerusalem was divided among the tribes, ",
            "the basis of their argument is another argument between Tannaim, for it has been taught:  What was in the portion of Yehudah? The Temple mount, the cells, the courts.  And what was in the portion of Benyamin? The Hall, the Palace and the Holy of Holies.  And a strip of land protruded from Yehudah's portion and went into Benyamin's portion, and on this the Holy Temple was built —  Benyamin the Righteous longed to swallow it every day as it is written: “He protects him all day long…” (Devarim 33:12) ",
            "therefore he merited to be the host of the Omnipotent, as it is said “…and He dwells between his shoulders.\" (ibid.) ",
            "This Tanna holds that Jerusalem was not divided among the tribes, for it has been taught:  One does not rent houses in Jerusalem, because the city does not belong to the inhabitants.  R’ Elazar bar R’ Shimon said:  Nor any beds.  Therefore the innkeepers take the skin of the sacrificial animals even by force.  Abaye said  ‘learn from this that it is the custom for a man to leave to his host the empty wine pitcher and the hide.’ "

And when the wind blew through them they dropped their fruits, as it says “…may its fruit rustle like Lebanon…” (Psalms 72:16)  Once strangers entered into the Palace – they dried out, as it says “…and the blossoms of the Lebanon are cut off.” (Nachum 1:4)"

            "The Sages say:  from Tzion it was created as it says, “A song of Asaph; God, God the Lord, spoke and called to the earth, from the rising of the sun until its setting.” (Tehillim 50:1) And it says, “From Zion, the perfection of beauty, God appeared” (Tehillim 50:2) - from it the beauty of the world was perfected."
