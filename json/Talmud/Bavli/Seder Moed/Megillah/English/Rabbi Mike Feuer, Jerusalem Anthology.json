            "    GEMARA. R’ Yitzchak said:  I heard that sacrifices may be offered in the Temple of Onias in our time.  He was of opinion that  the Temple of Onias is not a house of idolatry,  and that the first holiness of Jerusalem was temporary and not for all time, ", 
            "as it is written “For you have not yet come to the resting place or to the inheritance…” (Devarim 12:9) ‘Rest’ means Shiloh and ‘inheritance’ means Jerusalem.  ‘Inheritance’ is connected to ‘rest’ to teach -  just as after the place of rest was destroyed the high places were again permitted, so too after the place of inheritance is destroyed they will be permitted.

R’ Mari brought the following challenge:  after the sanctification of Shiloh high places can again be permitted, but after the sanctification of Jerusalem there can be no such permission.  We further learned:  After they came to Jerusalem, the high places were forbidden, and they were never permitted again, and it was the ‘inheritance’. ", 
            "This is an argument of Tana’im –  R’ Eliezer said:  I have heard that when they were building the sacred palace (heichal) they made curtains for the heichal and for the courtyard,  the difference being that in the heichal they built the walls outside the curtains and in the courtyard they built the walls within the curtains.
