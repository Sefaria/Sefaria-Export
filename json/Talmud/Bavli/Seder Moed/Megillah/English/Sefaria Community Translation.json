            "MISHNAH: The Megillah is read on the eleventh, the twelfth, the thirteenth, the fourteenth, and the fifteenth [of Adar], never earlier and never later. Cities which have been walled since the days of Yehoshua ben Nun read on the fifteenth. Villages and large towns read on the fourteenth. The villages, however may [sometimes] push the reading forward to the court day.",
            "How does this work? If [the fourteenth of Adar] falls on Monday, the villages and large towns read on that day, and the walled places on the next day. If it falls on Tuesday or Wednesday, the villages push the reading forward to the court day. The large towns read on the day itself, and the walled place on the next day.",
            "If [the fourteenth falls] on Thursday, the villages and large towns read on that day and the walled places on the next day. If it falls on Friday, the villages push the reading forward to the court day, and the large towns and walled places read on the day itself.",
            "If it falls on Shabbos, the villages and large towns push the reading [of the Megillah] forward to the court day and the walled places read [the Megillah] on the next day. If it falls on Sunday, the villages push the reading [of the Megilla] forward to the court day. The large towns read on the same day, and the walled cities [read] on the following day. ",
            "GEMARA: \"The Megillah is read on the eleventh.\" How can this be derived? [How can you ask,] ‘Where can this be derived’? Surely it is as we state further on, ‘The Sages made a concession to the villages, allowing them to push the reading forward to the Court day, so that [they should have leisure to] supply food and water for their brethren in the large towns’?",
            "What we mean [by our question] is this: Let us see now. All these dates were laid down by the Men of the Great Assembly.  For if you should [deny this and affirm] that the Men of the Great Assembly laid down only the fourteenth and fifteenth, [is it possible that] the [later] Rabbis should have come and annulled a regulation made by the Men of the Great Assembly, Seeing that we have learnt, ‘One court cannot annul the ordinances of another unless it is superior to it in number and in wisdom’?",
            "Obviously, therefore, all these days must have been laid down by the Men of the Great Assembly, [and therefore we ask], where are they hinted to [in the Megillah]?",
            "Rav Shemen bar Abba said in the name of R' Yochanan: It says, (Esther 9:31) ‘To confirm these days of Purim in their times.’ [which indicates that] they laid down many ‘times’ for them. ",
            "But this text is required for its literal meaning! If that were the case, it [the Megillah] could have simply stated ‘at the [appointed] time’. What then is implied by ‘their times’? A large number of ‘times’!",
            "But still I may say that [the expression ‘their’ times’] is required, To indicate that the time of one is not the same as the time of the other! If that were the case, it [the Megillah] should say [simply], ‘their time’. Why does it say ‘their times’? So that you may infer from this:  All of them [the days]. ",
            "And I could say, \"'Their times’ means numerous times. The expression ‘their times’ is to ‘their time’:  Just as ‘their time’ would indicate two [days], so ‘their times’ indicates two [extra days]. ",
            "And I could say, [these two days are] the twelfth and thirteenth? [This is not correct] for the reason given [elsewhere] by Rav Shmuel bar Yitzchak: The thirteenth was the time of assembly for all [meaning, the Jews assembled to fight their enemies on the thirteenth, both those who lived in Shushan and the village-dwellers], and [therefore] no special indication is required for it in the text. We may say here that the thirteenth day is a time of assembly and no special indication is required for it in the text. ",
            "And I could say,[these two days are the] sixteenth and seventeenth? [ This is not correct, as it says,] (Esther 9:27) ‘And it shall not pass’.",
            "But R' Shmuel bar Nachmani says: It [the Tanach] says (Esther 9:22) ‘As the days wherein the Jews had rest from their enemies.’  [The expression] ‘the days’ [would have sufficed] and we have ‘as the days’, to include the eleventh and the twelfth.",
            "But cannot I say the twelfth and thirteenth? Said Rav Shmuel bar Yitzchak: The thirteenth is a time of assembly for all, and does not require special indication [in the text].  But cannot I say the sixteenth and the seventeenth? It is written, (Esther 9:27) ‘and it shall not pass’.",
            "Why did R' Samuel bar Nachmani not derive the rule from the expression ‘in their times’? He does not accept the distinction [made above between] ‘time’, ‘their time’ and ‘their times’.",
            "And why did Rav Shimon bar Abba not derive the rule from the expression ‘as the days’? He can say to you: This is meant to make the rule apply to future generations. ",
            "Rava bar Bar Chanah said in the name of R' Yochanan This [rule stated in the Mishnah] is the ruling of R. Akiva - the anonymous authority, who draws the distinction between ‘time’, ‘their time’ and ‘their times’.  The Megilla is only to be read on the proper day. ",
            "The following was adduced in refutation of this: R' Yehuda said: 'When does this rule apply? When the years are properly fixed and Israel resides upon their own soil.' But in these days, since people reckon from it, the Megillah is to be read only on the proper day.",
            "Which opinion is R’ Yehuda following? Shall I say he follows the opinion of R’ Akiva? This cannot be, because [according to him] the regulation is in force in these days also.",
            "It must be then that he follows the Rabbis, and [even according to them]  we read [on the other days] at any rate when the years are properly fixed and Israel reside on their own soil! Is this not a refutation of R’ Yochanan?",
            "It is. Rava bar Bar Chunah said in the name of R' Yochanan 'This rule follows the ruling of R’ Akiva - the anonymous authority.' But the Sages say: 'In these days, since people reckon from it, we read it only on the proper day.'",
            "It has been taught to the same effect, Rabbi Yehudah Says: 'When does this rule hold good? When the years are properly fixed and Israel reside upon their own soil, but in these days, since people reckon from it, it is read only on the proper day.'",

            "R' Yirmiyahu (and some say R' Chiyah bar Abba) also taught: The Aramaic translation of the Torah was revealed by Onkelos the Convert, which he received from R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua. The Aramaic translation of the Prophets was revealed by Yonatan ben Uziel, which he received from Chagai, Zechariah, and Malachi. When he revealed it, the land of Israel shook an area of 400 parsah. A voice from heaven called out: \"Who is this who is revealing my secrets to the sons of man?\"",
            "Stood Yonatan ben Uziel and proclaimed: \"I am he who dared reveal your secrets to the sons of man. It is known and revealed that I did not do this for my family's or my honor, but rather I did this for your glory, so that disputes [over the meaning of the text] would not proliferate in Israel.\"",
            "He (Yonatan ben Uziel) also wished to reveal the translation of the Writings, but a voice from heaven said: \"Enough\". Why did it say that? Because [in the Writings] is contained the description of the coming of the Messiah.",
            "Did Onkelos the Convert really reveal the translation of the Torah? Didn't R' Ika son of Avin say in the name of R' Chananel who said in the name of Rav: What is the meaning of the pasuk: [Nehemiah 8:8] \"And they read in the book of the Teaching of God, in great depth and application of knowledge, and they understood through reading.\" \"And they read in the book of the Teaching of God,\"- this is the Torah. \"in great depth\" - this is the Targum (Aramaic translation). \"and application of knowledge,\"- these are the pasuk divisions. \"and they understood through  reading\" - these are the cantillation marks. Some say it means",
            "the oral traditions. [Obviously the Targum was known in Ezra's time, before Onkelos was born!] Rather, it was forgotten, and [Onkelos] reestablished it.",
            "Why is it that the Land of Israel shook when the Targum of the Prophets was revealed, but not the Targum on the Torah? Because the Torah is written in clear, explanatory, language whereas the Prophets' wording gets terse and murky at times. An example [of this murky writing]: \"In that day the mourning in Jerusalem will grow great, as the mourning of Haddadrimon in the valley of Megiddo was.\" (Zechariah 12:11). And R' Yosef said:",
            "If not for the Targum on this verse, we would not have known the meaning (of the verse.) (The Targum is:) \"On that day, the mourning in Jerusalem will grow great, like that of Achav son of Omri, who killed Haddadrimon son of Tavrimmon in the Heights of Gilead, and like the mourning of Josiah son of Amon, who killed Pharaoh Neco in the Valley of Megiddon.\"",
            "(Another example from Daniel 10:7) \"And I alone saw the wonder, but the men who were with me did not see the wonder, however a great fear grasped them and they fled to hide.\"   Who were these people? R' Yimiyahu said, and some say R' Chiya bar Abba: These are the prophets Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi,",

(1:) To read the Shema. (2:) If he is in an unclean place (where he may not recite the Shema,) he should jump from his place four jumps. If he cannot do that, (3:) he should say this: \"The rams of the slaughterhouse are fatter than me!\"",
            "And now that we have explained the verse \"Nation and nation, city and city\" as being required for a Drasha, what do we need \"Household and household\" for? R' Yosei bar Chanina said: To include the families of the priesthood and Levi'im who must stop doing their work (in the Temple) and come to listen to the recitation of the Megillah.",
            "This is as R' Yehuda said in the name of Rav: The priests in their work, the Levi'im on their steps (duchan), and the Israelites in their shifts, all of them stop their work and go to listen to the recitation of the Megillah.",

From this, the house of Rabbi would stop their learning and come to listen to the Megillah, because it was implied  that if the holy work was stopped (which is so important), so too the learning (which is less,) should also be stopped.",

You should not think thus (as it says) \"Remember\" (Devarim 25:17): It could mean in your heart, but then it goes on \"do not forget\" (ibid. vv. 19) - and the heart does forget! Rather, I must be fulfilling \"remember\" with the mouth [by recitation.]:",
            "[MISHNA:] \"If he read it in Aramaic, he did not fulfill is obligation...\" How so? If the scroll is written in Hebrew, and the reader reads in Aramaic, this is by heart! [which was forbidden previously.] Therefore, here, the case must be that it was written in Aramaic and it was read in Aramaic.",
            "[MISHNA:] \"But he may read in a foreign language to a foreigner.\" Had we not said [previously in the Mishna] that to read in any [other] language was not permissible? Rav and Shmuel agreed: [Here, we are dealing with] the Greek language.",
            "How so? If the scroll was written in Hebrew block letters, and the reader read in Greek, he is reading by heart! Said R' Acha son of R' Eliezer: The scroll was also written in Greek.",
            "R' Acha son of R' Eliezer also said: From where do we see that the Holy One, Blessed Be He, called Jacob \"El\"? As it says (Genesis 33:20): \"And he called it 'El Elohei Yisrael'. Had Jacob called the altar [from the verses] \"El\", it should have read \"And Jacob called\" [instead of \"he\"]. Rather, it means \"And he called Jacob 'El'.\" Who called him this? \"'Elohei Yisrael' ['God of Israel'].\"",
            "We raise a question [from a Braita:] \"If he read it in Giftian, Hebrew, Elamite, Medite, or <b>Greek</b>, he did not fulfill his obligation.\"",
            "[That is if he did not understand the language. Rav and Shmuel discuss one who knows Greek, as in] these examples of reading \"in Giftian to Giftians, Hebrew to Hebrews, Elamite to Elamites, or Greek to Greeks, he has fulfilled his obligation.\"  ",
            "If so, then why did Rav and Shmuel establish that the \"foreign language\" was Greek, if the same applies to every language? (Rather, the Mishna follows the Braita, and) Rav and Samuel say that Greek is good for <b>all peoples.</b> ... Did Rav and Shmuel really say that Greek is good for all?",
            "Does it not teach [in the Braita:] \"Greek to Greeks\" - and the word \"Greeks\" comes to exclude all other nations? It is as Raban Shimon ben Gamliel taught [in a Mishna:] \"Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says: [holy] Books may not be written [in any other language] save for Greek. [and cannot be maftir anyone an obligation, save for Greek.]\"",
            "Rav and Shmuel hold like this.  If so, then they should have said [instead of \"You may read in Greek\"] \"The law is in accordance with Raban Shimon son of Gamliel.\" No, Greek must be explicitly taught in the case of Megillah, where it says \"as it is <b>written</b> [in this book<b> in Hebrew</b>.]\"",
            "[MISHNA:] \"A foreigner who heard it in Hebrew has fulfilled his obligation.\" But he doesn't understand what is being said! Rather, one has fulfilled his obligation even without understanding, like women and country bumpkins.",
            "Ravina strongly disagreed with this answer, saying: \"And do we know the meaning of ha-achashteranim benei ha-ramachim? But all the same we perform the Mitzvah of reading the Megillah and proclaiming the miracle. So they too perform the Mitzvah of reading the Megillah and proclaiming the miracle.\"",
            "[MISHNA:] \"If he read it with <i>seirugin</i>, he has fulfilled his obligation.\" The Rabbis did not know what <i>seirugin</i> was.
