They [the <i>Chachamim</i>] said to him: Is this proof? She was a women, and therefor free from the [<i>mitzvah</i>] of Sukkah  He answered them: ‘Did she not have seven sons?

",

Whereas of ‘his table’ there is no mention.  Does a contradiction not arise between the two [Baraisas]?  We must consequently infer therefrom  that: One is from Bais Shammai, and one is from Bais Hillel.", 
            "Mar Zutra said: The wording of this Mishnah also proves it, since is says: ‘Bais Shammai declare it <i>pasul</i>, and Bais Hillel says it's <i>Kosher</i>’, and if it were [as you say] it should read Bais Shammai say’, He has not fulfilled his obligation while Bais Hillel say that he has.",

But the text is defective and is to be read like this:  ‘He whose head and the greater part of his body were within the Sukkah and his table within the house, Bais Shammai say, He has not fulfilled his obligation and Bais Hillel says:  He has. and if it is [able to contain only his head and the major part of his body alone, Beth Shammai says it's <i>pasul</i> and Bais Hillel says it's <i>Kosher</i>.’ ",

Ashi said: The dispute concerns only the original produce itself, but with regard to secondary produce, both agree that [it can be redeemed] either by way of sale or by way of exchange.

Ashi: [It has been taught]: If a man has a sela [gained through selling the produce of] the Sabbatical Year, and wishes to purchase with it a shirt, what should he do? Let him go to his regular shopkeeper and say to him, ‘Give me a sela worth of fruit’ and give it to him. Then he tells him,  ‘Behold this fruit is given [back]] to you as a gift’, and [the shopkeeper] answers him, ‘And here is a gift for you of a sela.'  And then he may purchase with it whatsoever he desires. Now here, surely, the sela is a secondary produce, and yet it teaches [that it may be redeemed only] by way of sale, and not by way of exchange?",

Yohanan] is over secondary produce, but with regard to the original produce all agree that [it may be redeemed] only by way of sale, and not by way of exchange. \"Both the produce of the Sabbatical Year and of the Second Tithe [may be redeemed by exchange]\"— his refers to the money for which the produce is exchanged.

Judah? —  That sounding was a mere signal.",
