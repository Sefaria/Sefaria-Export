Up to twenty cubits [high] one knows that he is dwelling in a sukkah, but with one higher than twenty cubits he does not ‘know’ that he is dwelling in a sukkah, since his eye does not catch sight of it.",

Up to twenty cubits [high] one makes his home a temporary one; higher than twenty cubits, one does not make his home temporary, but permanent.",

They [the <i>Chachamim</i>] said to him: Is this proof? She was a women, and therefor free from the [<i>mitzvah</i>] of Sukkah  He answered them: ‘Did she not have seven sons?  And besides, ... she did nothing except in accordance with the command of the <i>Chachamim</i>’.",
            "Why does he have to add ‘and besides, she did nothing except in accordance with the command of the <i>Chachamim</i>’?",

            "Now this [Baraisa] is well according to the authority who says that their difference of opinion was in the case where the walls did not reach the covering; Since it is the custom of a queen to sit in a sukkah whose walls do not reach the roof,"

            "The Rabbis hold the opinion that: her sons sat in the proper Sukkah, while she sat in one of the recesses for reasons of modesty, and hence they made no remark,    [While,]R. Judah was of the opinion that her sons sat with her, and still they made no remark.",
            "Rav Shmuel bar Yitzchak said: The Halachah is that [the Sukkah] must be able to contain his head, the greater part of his body, and his table.  R. Abba said to him: [In] agreement with whom [is this ruling?] Like Bais Shammai? He [Rav Shmuel bar Yitzchak] said to him: According to whom else? (I. E. Who else would it be?)",

            "Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak objected: How do we know that Bais Shammai and Bais Hillel are disputing about a small Sukkah? Perhaps their dispute concerns a large Sukkah, as for instance, where a man sat at the entrance of the Sukkah with his table inside the house, [with]Bais Shammai holding the opinion that we prohibit it lest he be drawn after the table,while Bais Hillel holds that  we do not prohibit it? ",
            "This, furthermore, may be deduced also [from the wording], for it was stated,  ‘If his head and the greater part of his body were within the Sukkah but his table was within the house, Bais Shammai [says] it's <i>pasul</i>, and Bais Hillel [says] it's <i>Kosher</i>;' but if it is [as you say] it should read, [If the Sukkah can] contain, or cannot contain [his head, etc.]. ",
            "But do they not dispute concerning a small Sukkah? Has it not in fact been taught: [If a Sukkah can] contain his head, the greater part of his body and his table, it is <i>kosher</i>. Rabi says: It must be four <i>amos</i>. ",
            "While in another [Baraitha] it has been taught: Rabbi says:  Any Sukkah which is not four <i>amos</i> square is invalid, while the Sages say: Even if it can contain only his head, and the greater part of his body it is <i>kosher</i>. Whereas of ‘his table’ there is no mention.  Does a contradiction not arise between the two [Baraisas]?  We must consequently infer therefrom  that: One is from Bais Shammai, and one is from Bais Hillel.",
            "Mar Zutra said: The wording of this Mishnah also proves it, since is says: ‘Bais Shammai declare it <i>pasul</i>, and Bais Hillel says it's <i>Kosher</i>’, and if it were [as you say] it should read Bais Shammai say’, He has not fulfilled his obligation while Bais Hillel say that he has.",
            "But do not the words, ‘He [whose head, etc.] were’ present a difficulty? ",
            "The fact is that they differ on two [points]. They differ on a small Sukkah and they differ on a large Sukkah. But the text is defective and is to be read like this:  ‘He whose head and the greater part of his body were within the Sukkah and his table within the house, Bais Shammai say, He has not fulfilled his obligation and Bais Hillel says:  He has. and if it is [able to contain only his head and the major part of his body alone, Beth Shammai says it's <i>pasul</i> and Bais Hillel says it's <i>Kosher</i>.’ ",

And the <i>Tana</i> says: If a man placed his <i>Eruv</i> in a gatehouse or in an exedra (a semicircular recess), or in a ballcony, it is <i>asur</i> and he who dwells within it cannot be a cause of prohibition?",

Then he tells him,  ‘Behold this fruit is given [back]] to you as a gift’, and [the shopkeeper] answers him, ‘And here is a gift for you of a sela.'
