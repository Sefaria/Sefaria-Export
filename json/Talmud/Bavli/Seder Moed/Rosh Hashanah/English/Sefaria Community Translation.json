            "Mishnah: During four different times, the world is judged.  On Passover, regarding produce; on Shavuot, regarding the fruits of the trees; On New Year's [ie. 1 Tishrei], all of those who are in this world pass before Him like children of Maron, as it is said, \"He who fashions their hearts at once; He who understands all their doings (Psalms 33:15).\" And on Sukkot, we are judged regarding water.", 
            "...What produce? .If we are speaking about the standing, ripe produce- then one can object \"all these occurrences that have happened to it already, when where they judged?\"   Rather we are speaking about the produce that will be planted later this year.", 
            "Is this to say that this produce is judged only once? But I will challenge you from a baraita: \"produce which was subjected to a natural disaster or a disturbance- if it happened before Pesach, it was judged during last years Pesach (before it was planted). If it happened after Pesach, it was judged this past Pesach (when it was already planted) likewise, a person who is subjected to a natural disaster or a disturbance- if it happened before Yom Kippur, it was judged during last years Yom Kippur. If it happened after Yom Kippur, it was judged this past Yom Kippur\"", 
            "Says Rava: we see from here (this beraita) that produce is judged twice. Says Abaye: Therefore, when one sees that his slow growing crop is prospering, let him quickly plant his fast growing crop, in order that it should have grown slightly before the next judgement.", 
            "Which tanna is our mishna in accordance with? neither Rebbi Meir, or Rebbi Yehudah, or Rebbi Yossi, nor Rebbi Natan.", 
            "As we taught in a baraita: \" All are judged on Rosh Hashana and their judgement is sealed on Yom Kippur, these are the words of R' Meir. R' Yehudah says:  All are judged on Rosh Hashana and their judgement is sealed on each in its own proper time on Pesach for produce of the field, on Atzeret (Shavuot) for the fruits of the tree, on the festival (Sukkot) for water, and people are judged on Rosh Hashana and their judgement is sealed on Yom Kippur", 
            "R' Yossi says: People are judged every day, as it says (Job 7:18) \"and I will remmember him in the mornings\" R' Natan says: People are judged every hour, as it says (Job 7, 18) \"for seconds I will test him\"...", 
            "And if you will suggest that our Mishna is in fact R' Yehudah, and our Mishnah was listing the times of the year that the judgement is sealed, still our Mishnah is a contradiction with reguard to the judgement of people", 
            "Says Rava:.. This Tanna is the academy of R' Yishmael for the academy of R' Yishmael taught at four times in the year the world is judged on Pesach for produce of the field, on Atzeret (Shavuot) for the fruits of the tree, on the festival (Sukkot) for water, and people are judged on Rosh Hashana and their judgement is sealed on Yom Kippur and the Mishna was speaking about the beginning of the judgement", 
            "Says R' Chisda: \"What is R' Yossi's reasoning?\" (the gemara retorts) why, his reason is as he stated (based on the verse): \"and I will remember him in the mornings\" rather, this is what we (R' Chisda)  are asking \"why didnt R' Yossi say like R' Natan said?  because he would say (about the verse of R' Natan) that \"testing\" is just an examination (not a judgement)  (we can retort to R' Yossi) \"remembering\" is also just an examination (not a judgement) ", 
            "Therefore, says R' Chisda,  the source for R' Yossi is from here (Kings 1 8:59) \"to excecute the justice of his servant and his nation Israel each and every day\" ", 
            "and R' Chisda said further: a king and a congregation (which both await judgement) the king has precedence, as it says \"to execute the justice of his servant and his nation Israel\" what is the reason? if you want you can say it isn't proper to have the king wait outside and if you want you can say (the king should receive judgement) before the anger (of G-D) is increased", 
            "Says R' Yosef in accordance with who do we pray for the sick and the weak? in accordance with R' Yossi  and if you want you can say even in accordance with the Rabbis and R' Yitzchak because R' Yitzchak said: prayer is helpful both before and after the judgement is sealed", 
            "it was taught in a baraita: \"says R' Yehudah in the name of R' Akiva why did the Torah say to bring an omer measurement on Pesach? Because Pesach is the time of the (judgement for) produce the Holy One said: bring before me an omer on Pesach in order that your produce in the fields should be blessed and why did the Torah say to bring two loaves of bread on Atzeret (Shavuot)? Because Atzeret is the time for the (judgement for) the fruits of the tree. The Holy One said:  Bring before me two breads on Atzeret in order that your fruits of the tree be blessed", 
            "and why did the Torah say to pour water on Sukkot? The Holy One said:  Pour before me water on Sukkot in order that the rain of the year be blessed. And Say before me on Rosh Hashana kingship, remembrance, and shofar kingship in order that you make me king over yourselves, remembrance so that your remembrance comes before me for good, and how? With the Shofar\"", 
            "Says R' Abahu why do we blow with the horn of a ram? Said the Holy One: blow before me with a ram's horn in order that I remember for you the binding of Isaac son of Abraham, and I will consider it as if you bound yourselves before me", 
            "(and says) R' Yitzchak: why do we blow on Rosh Hashana? (The gemara objects) why do we blow?  why, the Torah said explicitly \"blow\" rather (what we are asking is) why do we blow a teruah?  (The gemara objects) why do we blow a teruah?  why, the Torah said explicitly \"blow a teruah\" rather (what we are asking is) .. why do we blow and sound a teruah when we are sitting, ..."
