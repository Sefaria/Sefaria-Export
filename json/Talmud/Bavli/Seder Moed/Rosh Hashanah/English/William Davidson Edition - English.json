            "<b>On the first of Elul is the New Year for animal tithes;</b> all the animals born prior to that date belong to the previous tithe year and are tithed as a single unit, whereas those born after that date belong to the next tithe year. <b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say:</b> The New Year for animal tithes is <b>on the first of Tishrei.</b>",
            "<b>On the first of Tishrei is the New Year for</b> counting <b>years,</b> as will be explained in the Gemara; <b>for</b> calculating <b>Sabbatical Years and Jubilee Years,</b> i.e., from the first of Tishrei there is a biblical prohibition to work the land during these years; <b>for planting,</b> for determining the years of <i>orla</i>, the three-year period from when a tree has been planted during which time its fruit is forbidden; <b>and for</b> tithing <b>vegetables,</b> as vegetables picked prior to that date cannot be tithed together with vegetables picked after that date.",
            "<b>On the first of Shevat is the New Year for the tree;</b> the fruit of a tree that was formed prior to that date belong to the previous tithe year and cannot be tithed together with fruit that was formed after that date; this ruling is <b>in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai.</b> But <b>Beit Hillel say:</b> The New Year for trees is <b>on the fifteenth of</b> Shevat.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The New Year <b>for kings; with regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> is it mentioned in the mishna? Why is it necessary to set a specific date to count the years of a king’s rule, rather than counting them from the day that he ascends to the throne? <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> It is <b>for</b> determining the validity of <b>documents.</b>",
            "It was the common practice to date documents in accordance with the years of the king’s rule; therefore, it was important that these years begin at a fixed time, so that one knows whether a particular document was antedated or postdated, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Antedated promissory notes,</b> i.e., promissory notes dated prior to the date on which the loan actually took place, <b>are invalid</b> because a loan document creates a lien on the borrower’s property. By dating the document earlier than the loan itself, the lender has a fraudulent mortgage on the property, which can be used against any future purchaser. Therefore, the Sages ordained that an antedated promissory note does not establish a lien, even from the true date of the loan. <b>But postdated</b> promissory notes bearing a date that is later than the date when the loan actually took place <b>are valid,</b> as postdating the note presents no opportunity for defrauding a purchaser.",

            "The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for a case <b>where</b> the princes agreed to <b>appoint him</b> as king already <b>in</b> the month of <b>Adar.

            "It was further taught in the <i>baraita</i>: But if the first king <b>died in Adar and another</b> king <b>succeeded him in Nisan, one counts the first</b> year <b>to the first</b> king as his final year, <b>and the second</b> year <b>to the second king</b> as the first year of his reign.

            "§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one counts</b> the years of kings’ reigns <b>only from Nisan?

This verse <b>juxtaposes the reign of Solomon to the exodus from Egypt: Just as</b> one counts the years since <b>the exodus from Egypt from Nisan,</b> when the Jewish people left Egypt, <b>so too,</b> one counts the years of <b>Solomon’s reign from Nisan.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that we count</b> the years from <b>the exodus from Egypt themselves from Nisan? Perhaps we count</b> them <b>from Tishrei.</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>It should not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is written: “And Aaron the priest went up to Mount Hor at the commandment of the Lord, and died there, in the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fifth month, on the first day of the month”</b> (Numbers 33:38), <b>and it is</b> later <b>written: “And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first of the month, that Moses spoke</b> to the children of Israel” (Deuteronomy 1:3). <b>From the fact that when</b> the Bible <b>speaks of</b> the month of <b>Av,</b> which is the fifth month, <b>it calls</b> that year <b>“the fortieth year,” and when it speaks of</b> the following <b>Shevat, it</b> also <b>calls</b> that year <b>“the fortieth year,” the implication is</b> that the <b>New Year</b> does <b>not</b> begin in <b>Tishrei.</b> Were it the case that the New Year begins in Tishrei, Av and the following Shevat would not be in the same year because the year would have changed in Tishrei.",
            "The Gemara raises an objection: <b>Granted,</b> in <b>this</b> case of Aaron’s death it is <b>explicitly stated that</b> the year is counted <b>from the exodus from Egypt,</b> as it states: “In the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt.” <b>But</b> with regard to <b>this</b> other incident of Moses’ oration, <b>from where</b> is it known <b>that</b> the year is counted <b>from the exodus from Egypt? Perhaps</b> it is forty years <b>since the establishment of the Tabernacle</b> in the wilderness.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>In accordance with</b> what <b>Rav Pappa said</b> in a different context, that the meaning of one instance of the expression <b>“the twentieth year”</b> may be inferred from another instance of the expression <b>“the twentieth year” by way of a verbal analogy, here too,</b> the meaning of one instance of the expression <b>“the fortieth year”</b> may be inferred from another instance of the expression <b>“the fortieth year” by way of a verbal analogy: Just as here,</b> with regard to Aaron’s death, the count is <b>from the exodus from Egypt, so too, here,</b> with regard to Moses’ oration, although this is not stated explicitly, the count is <b>from the exodus from Egypt.</b>",
            "The Gemara raises another question: Even if this serves as proof that these two events both took place in the fortieth year from the exodus from Egypt, <b>from where</b> is it known <b>that the incident of</b> Aaron’s death in <b>Av</b> took place <b>first? Perhaps the incident of</b> Moses’ oration in <b>Shevat</b> took place <b>first,</b> in which case it is possible that the years from the Exodus are counted not from Nisan, but from Tishrei.",
            "The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>It should not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is written</b> that Moses delivered his oration <b>“after he had slain Sihon”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:4), <b>and when Aaron died Sihon was still alive, as it is written:</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>“And when the Canaanite, the king of Arad,</b> who dwelt in the South, <b>heard</b> tell that Israel came by the way of Atharim; and he fought against Israel” (Numbers 21:1). <b>What report did he hear? He heard that Aaron had died, and that the clouds of glory had withdrawn</b> from the Jewish people, <b>and he thought</b> that <b>he had been granted permission to wage war against the Jewish people. And this is as it is written: “And all the congregation saw that [<i>ki</i>] Aaron was dead,</b> and they wept for Aaron thirty days, all the house of Israel” (Numbers 20:29).",
            "About this, <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: Do not read</b> the verse as: <b>“And they saw [<i>vayiru</i>]”; rather,</b> read it as: <b>“And they were seen [<i>vayeira’u</i>]”</b> by others, because the cover of the clouds of glory had been removed from them. <b>And</b> the next word, “that [<i>ki</i>],” should be understood as meaning because, <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Reish Lakish, as Reish Lakish said:</b> The word <b><i>ki</i> is used</b> in the Bible <b>in four senses: If, perhaps, but, and because.</b> Therefore, the verse should be understood as follows: And all the congregation was seen, i.e., revealed, because Aaron had died. This shows that at the time of Aaron’s death Sihon was still alive; perforce, Moses’ oration, which was delivered after he had slain Sihon, must have occurred later.",
            "The Gemara raises an objection against this proof: <b>Is it comparable? There,</b> the verse is speaking of <b>Canaan,</b> king of Arad, whereas <b>here,</b> the verse is speaking of <b>Sihon.</b> What proof, then, can be brought from the one with regard to the other? The Gemara explains: A Sage <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: All three names are referring to the same person: <b>He is Sihon,</b> and <b>he is Arad,</b> and <b>he is</b> also <b>Canaan.</b> He was called <b>Sihon because he was similar</b> in his wildness <b>to a foal [<i>seyyaḥ</i>] in the desert;</b> and he was called <b>Canaan after his kingdom,</b> as he ruled over the Canaanite people; <b>and what was his</b> real <b>name? Arad was his name. Some say</b> an alternative explanation: He was called <b>Arad because he was similar to a wild ass [<i>arod</i>] in the desert;</b> and he was called <b>Canaan after his kingdom; and what was his</b> real <b>name? Sihon was his name.</b>",
            "The Gemara raises another question: Granted, when counting the years from the exodus from Egypt, Av and the following Shevat are both part of the same year, but it has not been established that the counting of years from the Exodus is specifically from Nisan. <b>Say</b> that the <b>New Year</b> for this purpose <b>is</b> in the following month, the month of <b>Iyyar.</b>",
            "The Gemara rejects this proposal: <b>It should not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is written: “And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the Tabernacle was established”</b> (Exodus 40:17), <b>and it is written: “And it came to pass in the second year, in the second month,</b> on the twentieth day of the month, <b>that the cloud was taken up from over the Tabernacle of the testimony”</b> (Numbers 10:11). It may be argued as follows: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that when</b> the Bible <b>speaks of Nisan,</b> which is the first month, <b>it calls it “the second year,” and when it speaks of</b> the following <b>Iyyar,</b> which is the second month, <b>it</b> also <b>calls it “the second year,” by inference, Rosh HaShana is not</b> at the beginning of <b>Iyyar.</b> Were it the case that the New Year begins in Iyyar, Nisan and the following Iyyar would not occur in the same year, as the year would have changed in Iyyar.",
            "The Gemara asks further: <b>And say</b> that the <b>New Year</b> for this purpose <b>is</b> in the third month, the month of <b>Sivan.</b> The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>It should not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is written: “In the third month, after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt,</b> the same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai” (Exodus 19:1). <b>And if it is so</b> that the New Year is the beginning of Sivan, the verse <b>should have</b> said: <b>In the third month, in the second year after</b> the children of Israel <b>had gone out</b> of the land of Egypt, as a new year had started.",
            "The Gemara continues: <b>But</b> perhaps one could <b>say</b> that the New Year for counting the Exodus is in the fourth month, the month of <b>Tammuz; or say</b> that it is in the fifth month, the month of <b>Av; or say</b> that it is in the twelfth month, the month of <b>Adar.</b> There is no clear refutation that these months are not the New Year.",
            "<b>Rather, Rabbi Elazar said:</b> It is <b>from here</b> that it is derived that the years of a king’s rule are counted from Nisan, as it is stated: <b>“And he began to build in the second month, in the second, in the fourth year of his reign”</b> (II Chronicles 3:2). <b>What is</b> the meaning of the words <b>“the second”? Doesn’t it</b> mean <b>second to the month from which</b> Solomon’s <b>reign is counted?</b> This is clear proof that the years of a king’s rule are counted from the first month, i.e., the month of Nisan.",
            "<b>Ravina strongly objects to this:</b> Why not <b>say</b> that the words “the second” are referring to <b>the second</b> day <b>of the month?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>If so, it should have explicitly stated: “On the second of the month,”</b> as that is the formulation usually used in the Bible to refer to a specific day of the month.",
            "The Gemara raises another objection: Why not <b>say</b> that the words “the second” are referring to the second day <b>of the week?</b> This argument is rejected for two reasons: <b>First, we have not found the second</b> day <b>of the week</b> ever being <b>written;</b> nowhere does the Bible give the day of the week on which a particular event transpired. <b>And further,</b> the verse <b>juxtaposes the second</b> instance of the word <b>“second” to the first</b> instance of the word <b>“second”: Just as the first “second”</b> is referring to <b>a month, so too, the latter “second”</b> is referring to <b>a month.</b>",

            "<b>As Rabbi Ḥiyya taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a thanks-offering that became mixed up with its substitute,</b> i.e., one substituted an animal for one designated as a thanks-offering, in which case both animals are considered consecrated, and then the original animal and its substitute became mixed up with each other, <b>and one of them died, there is no remedy for the other one,</b> and so it must be left to graze until it becomes blemished.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>What could he have done</b> with the remaining animal? If you say <b>that he may sacrifice it and sacrifice the bread with it,</b> i.e., the forty loaves of bread that are brought as a meal-offering together with the animal component of the thanks-offering, <b>perhaps this</b> animal <b>is</b> not the one that had originally been set aside but rather <b>the substitute,</b> and the rule is that the substitute is sacrificed like the thanks-offering itself, but without bread. If you say <b>that he should sacrifice it without bread, perhaps it is the</b> original <b>thanks-offering,</b> which must be brought with bread. This, then, is the substitute that the <i>baraita</i> says is not subject to the prohibition against delaying.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But since</b> the animal <b>is not fit to be sacrificed, why do I</b> need a special <b>verse to exclude it</b> from the prohibition against delaying? In any case it cannot be sacrificed on the altar, and so there is no need to state that it is not included in the prohibition.",
            "<b>Rav Sheshet said: Actually,</b> you can say that the verse comes <b>to exclude the substitute for a burnt-offering or a peace-offering. And here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where two Festivals</b> already <b>passed</b> from the time that one had consecrated the original animal but did not bring it to the altar, <b>and it became blemished, and he redeemed it by</b> replacing it with <b>another</b> animal, as required. <b>And</b> then <b>another Festival passed</b> and he did not yet bring the substitute to the altar. In that case, <b>it might enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since</b> this second animal <b>comes in place of the first</b> one, as it was consecrated as a substitute for it, <b>it</b> should be <b>considered as one for which three Festivals have</b> already <b>passed;</b> therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so. Rather, the three Festivals are counted from the time of the replacement animal’s consecration.",
            "The Gemara asks: This answers the question of which substitute the <i>baraita</i> is referring to according to the opinion of the Rabbis, <b>but</b> according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who said: Once</b> even <b>the first Festival has passed one transgresses</b> the mitzva: <b>You shall not delay, what is there to say</b> here? <b>Rava said: Here, we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the original animal <b>became blemished during the Festival, and one redeemed it</b> by replacing it with another animal, <b>and the Festival passed</b> without that animal being sacrificed. In that case, <b>it might enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since</b> this second animal <b>comes in place of the first</b> one, and the first one had already been consecrated before the Festival, <b>it</b> should be <b>considered as one for which an entire Festival has</b> already <b>passed,</b> so that he transgresses the prohibition against delaying; therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case. Rather, an entire Festival must pass for the replacement animal.",
            "§ It was taught in the <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And it would be sin in you,”</b> which teaches that the sin of delaying would be sin in you, <b>but there would be no sin in your offering,</b> i.e., the offering would not become disqualified due to the delay. The Gemara asks: <b>Is it from here that this is learned?</b> But <b>isn’t it derived</b> from the statement <b>of <i>Aḥerim</i>? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b><i>Aḥerim</i> say</b> that one <b>might</b> have thought <b>that a firstborn</b> animal <b>after its</b> first <b>year passed,</b> during which time it was not sacrificed, <b>should be like consecrated things that have become disqualified</b> due to a blemish, <b>and</b> so <b>it is disqualified</b> from being brought to the altar.",
            "Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And you shall eat before the Lord your God,</b> in the place which He shall choose to place His name there, <b>the tithe of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil, and the firstborns of your herds, and of your flocks”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:23), thereby <b>juxtaposing a firstborn</b> animal <b>to the tithe</b> of grain. <b>Just as tithe is not disqualified</b> by being kept over <b>from one year to the next,</b> as it is explicitly stated that tithes may be eaten until the end of three years, <b>so too, a firstborn</b> animal <b>is not disqualified</b> by being kept over <b>from one year to the next,</b> despite the delay in being brought to the altar. Therefore, there is another source for the <i>halakha</i> that the offering itself does not become disqualified even if it is brought late.",
            "The Gemara answers: The first derivation cited <b>was necessary.</b> Had this <i>halakha</i> been learned only from the case of a firstborn animal, <b>it might enter your mind to say</b> that <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> that the offering is not disqualified <b>applies</b> only to <b>a firstborn, which is not for appeasement,</b> i.e., it does not come to atone for any sin, not even for the neglect of a positive mitzva, but is merely a gift for the priest. <b>But</b> as for other <b>consecrated</b> animals, <b>which appease,</b> their role being to atone for the sins of their owners, one might <b>say</b> that <b>they do not appease</b> when brought late. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so. Rather, the other offerings are also not disqualified when brought late.",
            "The Gemara asks further: <b>But still,</b> it may be argued that this derivation is unnecessary,"
        ],
        [
            "as this <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived from</b> that <b>which ben Azzai</b> said, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>ben Azzai says:</b> The verse states: “And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offering be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed to him who offers <b>it,</b> it shall be <i>piggul</i>” (Leviticus 7:18).",
            "For <b>what</b> purpose does <b>the verse state</b> the word “it”? <b>Since</b> elsewhere <b>it states:</b> “When you shall vow a vow to the Lord your God, <b>you shall not delay paying it;</b> for the Lord your God will surely require it from you, and it would be sin in you” (Deuteronomy 23:22), <b>I might have interpreted</b> from this verse that <b>even one who is late</b> in paying <b>his vow</b> is included in: <b>It shall not be accepted.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states “it.” It,</b> an offering disqualified by improper intention [<i>piggul</i>], <b>is</b> included in the <i>halakha</i> of: <b>“It shall not be accepted,” but</b> the animal of <b>one who is late</b> in paying <b>his vow is not</b> included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of: <b>“It shall not be accepted.”</b>",
            "The Gemara rejects what was said above; <b>rather,</b> the explanation of the verse is as follows. The phrase: “And it would be <b>sin in you”</b> comes to teach that there would be a sin in you, <b>but</b> there would <b>not</b> be <b>a sin in your wife.</b>",
            "It was necessary to say that the lateness is not imputed to the other members of one’s household for the following reason: <b>It might enter your mind to say: Since Rabbi Yoḥanan said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> who said: <b>A person’s wife dies only because</b> others <b>demand of him money and he does not have</b> means with which to pay, <b>as it is stated</b> about one who commits himself to guarantee a loan: <b>“If you have nothing with which to pay, why should he take away your bed from under you?”</b> (Proverbs 22:27). The verse warns one who takes a loan that incurring debt may result in one losing the very sheets that he sleeps on to his creditor. The Gemara understands this homiletically: Why should you cause God to take away your wife, i.e., she who shares your bed, so that she dies? Consequently, you might <b>say that</b> one’s <b>wife also dies for this transgression</b> of the prohibition: <b>You shall not delay,</b> in that one fails to fulfill his commitment.

            "The Gemara proceeds to discuss <b>the</b> matter <b>itself,</b> i.e., the <i>baraita</i> cited above, which stated: In the case of <b>both a firstborn</b> animal <b>and all consecrated animals, once a year has passed,</b> even if three <b>Festivals</b> have <b>not</b> passed, or once three <b>Festivals have passed,</b> even if a whole <b>year</b> has <b>not</b> passed, the owner <b>transgresses</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not delay.

How can a year pass without three Festivals also passing?",
            "The Gemara clarifies the question: <b>This</b> works out <b>well according to the one who is of</b> the opinion that one transgresses the prohibition against delaying only if the three Festivals have passed <b>in their</b> proper <b>order.

How is the year determined? <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: One counts 365 days like the number of the days in a solar</b> year, and not the usual lunar year, which is why it is called a full year.",
            "<b>And the Rabbis</b> disagree and <b>say: One counts twelve months from day to day,</b> from the date of the sale until that same date twelve months later, <b>and if it is a leap year</b> with an added month, <b>the leap</b> month is <b>for</b> the seller’s benefit, i.e., he has thirteen months to redeem his house. <b>You</b> can <b>find</b> a year without three Festivals <b>according to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.

            "<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Why does one sound</b> [<b><i>tokin</i></b>] a blast <b>on Rosh HaShana?</b> The Gemara is astonished by the question: <b>Why do we sound</b> a blast? <b>The Merciful One states</b> in the verse: <b>“Sound [<i>tiku</i>]</b> a <i>shofar</i>” (Psalms 81:4). <b>Rather,</b> the question is: <b>Why does one sound</b> a staccato series of <i>shofar</i> <b>blasts [<i>terua</i>]</b> in addition to a long continuous <i>shofar</i> blast [<i>tekia</i>]? The Gemara is still surprised by the question: <b>Sound a <i>terua</i>? The Merciful One states:</b> “In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall be a solemn rest unto you, <b>a memorial proclaimed with the blast of horns [<i>terua</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 23:24). <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak asked about the common practice in Jewish communities, which is not explicitly stated in the Torah: <b>Why does one sound</b> a long, continuous <i>shofar</i> <b>blast [<i>tekia</i>] and</b> then a staccato series of <i>shofar</i> <b>blasts [<i>terua</i>]</b> while the congregation is still <b>sitting</b> before the silent prayer,"

            "<b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said,</b> playing on the double meaning of the word <i>meri’in</i>, which can mean either sound a <i>terua</i> or cause misfortune: <b>Any year during which,</b> due to some mishap, <b>the <i>shofar</i> was not sounded at its beginning will suffer evil</b> and misfortune <b>at its end. What is the reason? Because Satan was not confused,</b> and he was able to put forward his accusations, so that the Jewish people would be punished.",
            "§ The Gemara brings a series of statements in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak, all of which relate to judgment: <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Any year that is poor [<i>rasha</i>]</b> and troubled <b>at its beginning will be made rich at its end, for it is stated: “From the beginning [<i>mereishit</i>] of the year”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:12). The word <b><i>meireishit</i> is written</b> defectively, without an <i>alef</i>, so that it may also be understood in the sense of <i>rashut</i>, poverty. The verse continues: <b>“And until the end [<i>aḥarit</i>]</b> of the year,” which means <b>that the end</b> of the year <b>will have</b> expectations of good things <b>in the end [<i>aḥarit</i>].</b>",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: A man is judged only according to his deeds at the time</b> of his judgment, and not according to his future deeds, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to Ishmael: <b>“For God has heard the voice of the lad where he is”</b> (Genesis 21:17). Although Ishmael and his descendants would act wickedly in the future, his prayer was heard and answered because he was innocent at the time.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Three matters evoke a person’s sins,</b> and <b>they are:</b> Endangering oneself by sitting next to <b>an inclined wall</b> that is about to collapse; <b>expecting prayer</b> to be accepted, as that leads to an assessment of one’s status and merit; <b>and passing a case against another</b> to Heaven, <b>for Rabbi Avin said: Anyone who passes a case against another</b> to God <b>is punished first.</b> Praying for God to pass judgment on another causes one’s own deeds to be examined and compared with the deeds of the other, <b>as it is stated: “And Sarai said to Abram: My anger be upon you;</b> I have given my maid into your bosom, and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes; let the Lord judge between me and you” (Genesis 16:5), <b>and it is written</b> afterward: <b>“And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her”</b> (Genesis 23:2). Sarah called upon Heaven to pass judgment between her and her husband, and therefore she was punished and died first.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: A person’s sentence is torn up on</b> account of <b>four</b> types of <b>actions. These are:</b> Giving <b>charity, crying out</b> in prayer, <b>a change of</b> one’s <b>name, and a change of</b> one’s <b>deeds</b> for the better. An allusion may be found in Scripture for all of them: Giving <b>charity, as it is written: “And charity delivers from death”</b> (Proverbs 10:2); <b>crying out</b> in prayer, <b>as it is written: “Then they cry to the Lord in their trouble, and He brings them out of their distresses”</b> (Psalms 107:28); <b>a change of</b> one’s <b>name, as it is written:</b> “As for <b>Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be”</b> (Genesis 17:15), <b>and it is written</b> there: <b>“And I will bless her, and I will also give you a son from her”</b> (Genesis 17:16); <b>a change of</b> one’s <b>deeds</b> for the better, <b>as it is written: “And God saw their deeds”</b> (Jonah 3:10), <b>and it is written</b> there: <b>“And God repented of the evil, which He had said He would do to them, and He did not do</b> it” (Jonah 3:10).",
            "<b>And some say: Also, a change of</b> one’s <b>place</b> of residence cancels an evil judgment, <b>as it is written: “And the Lord said to Abram: Go you out of your county”</b> (Genesis 12:1), <b>and afterward</b> it is written: <b>“And I will make of you a great nation”</b> (Genesis 12: 2). The Gemara explains: <b>And the other</b> one, i.e., Rabbi Yitzḥak, who does not include a change of residence in his list, holds that in the case of Abram, <b>it was the merit</b> and sanctity <b>of Eretz Yisrael that helped him</b> become the father of a great nation.",
            "The Gemara cites two more statements in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak, relating to the Festivals: <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: A person is obligated to</b> go out and <b>greet his teacher on a Festival, as it is stated</b> that the husband of the Shunamite woman asked, when she was readying herself to go to the prophet: <b>“Why will you go to him today; it is neither the New Moon nor Shabbat”</b> (II Kings 4:23). <b>By inference,</b> we learn <b>that on the New Moon and on Shabbat,</b> which in this context means a Festival that is a day of rest, <b>she was required to go.</b>",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: A person is obligated to purify himself on a Festival, as it is stated: “And their carcasses you shall not touch;</b> they are impure to you” (Leviticus 11:8). This verse is referring to the Festivals, as taught in the following <i>baraita</i>.",
            "<b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And their carcass you shall not touch.”</b> One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that</b> ordinary <b>Jews are prohibited from touching an animal carcass.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron,</b> and say to them: There shall none be defiled for the dead among his people” (Leviticus 21:1). It is derived from here that <b>the sons of Aaron are prohibited</b> from defiling themselves, but <b>the children of Israel,</b> i.e., non-priests, <b>are not prohibited</b> from doing so.",
            "<b>But are</b> these <b>matters not an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference? <b>If,</b> with regard to <b>severe impurity,</b> i.e., contact with a human corpse, <b>priests are prohibited</b> from defiling themselves, while ordinary <b>Israelites are not prohibited</b> from doing so, in the case of <b>light impurity,</b> e.g., touching an animal carcass, is it <b>not all the more so</b> that Israelites be permitted to defile themselves? <b>Rather, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “And their carcass you shall not touch?”</b> It means that <b>on a Festival</b> all are obligated to purify themselves.",
            "§ The Gemara goes back to discuss the Day of Judgment. <b>Rabbi Kruspedai said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Three books are opened on Rosh HaShana</b> before the Holy One, Blessed be He: <b>One of wholly wicked</b> people, <b>and one of wholly righteous</b> people, <b>and one of middling</b> people whose good and bad deeds are equally balanced. <b>Wholly righteous</b> people <b>are immediately written and sealed for life; wholly wicked</b> people <b>are immediately written and sealed for death;</b> and <b>middling</b> people <b>are left</b> with their judgment <b>suspended from Rosh HaShana until Yom Kippur,</b> their fate remaining undecided.

When they first purified the Temple they had to prepare the candelabrum out of wood, as no other material was available. Since this candelabrum is fit for the Temple, it is prohibited to fashion one of this kind for oneself.",
            "The other Sages <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda: <b>From there</b> you seek to bring <b>a proof?</b> There the branches of the candelabrum <b>were</b> comprised of <b>spits [<i>shippudin</i>] of iron and they covered them with tin.</b> Later, when <b>they grew richer</b> and could afford a candelabrum of higher-quality material, <b>they fashioned them from silver.</b> When <b>they grew even richer, they fashioned them from gold.</b> Still, Abaye proves from this <i>baraita</i> that the prohibition against forming an image applies only to items that can be reconstructed in an accurate manner.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And is it</b> really <b>permitted</b> to form images of <b>those attendants</b> concerning <b>which it is impossible to reproduce their likeness?

However, all other images, which are not the likeness of the ministering angels, are permitted.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so, let</b> the fashioning of an image of <b>a human face [<i>partzuf</i> ] alone be permitted. Why,</b> then, <b>is it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>All faces are permitted</b> for ornamental purposes, <b>except for the face of a person? Rav Huna, son of Rav Idi, said: From a lecture of Abaye I heard</b> that there is a different reason why one may not form an image of a human face, as the verse states: <b>“You shall not make with Me [<i>iti</i>]”</b> (Exodus 20:19). This can be read as: <b>You shall not make Me [<i>oti</i>].</b> Since man is created in the image of God, it is prohibited to form an image of a human being.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And is it permitted</b> to form images of <b>other attendants? Isn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> that the verse: <b>“You shall not make with Me</b> gods of silver” (Exodus 20:19), teaches that <b>you shall not make images of My attendants that serve before Me on high, for example, <i>ofanim</i> and seraphim and the sacred <i>ḥayyot</i> and the ministering angels. Abaye said: The Torah prohibited only</b> those <b>attendants that are</b> found <b>in the upper Heaven,</b> i.e., the supreme angels in the highest firmament, but not the celestial bodies, e.g., the sun and the moon, despite the fact that they too are located in heaven.",
            "The Gemara raises another difficulty: <b>And is it permitted</b> to form images of <b>those</b> bodies found <b>in the lower heaven? Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “You shall not make for yourself any graven image, nor any manner of likeness, of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth” (Exodus 20:3). The phrase <b>“that is in heaven”</b> comes <b>to include</b> the <b>sun,</b> the <b>moon,</b> the <b>stars, and</b> the <b>constellations.</b> The term <b>“above”</b> serves <b>to include the ministering angels.</b> Apparently, it is prohibited to form an image even of the celestial bodies found in the lower Heaven.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> that <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>the prohibition against worshipping them,</b> then <b>even a tiny worm</b> should <b>also</b> be prohibited.

            "The Gemara raises yet another objection: <b>And is the mere fashioning</b> of images of the celestial bodies <b>permitted?

            "The Gemara proposes an alternative resolution: The case of <b>Rabban Gamliel is different, as others,</b> i.e., gentiles, <b>fashioned</b> those images <b>for him,</b> and it is prohibited only for a Jew to fashion such images; there is no prohibition against having them in one’s possession. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> there is the case of <b>Rav Yehuda, as others fashioned for him</b> a seal in the form of a human being, <b>and Shmuel said to Rav Yehuda,</b> who was his student: <b>Sharp-witted one, blind this one’s eyes,</b> i.e., disfigure the image, as it is prohibited even to have the image of a human being in one’s possession.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of Rav Yehuda, <b>his was a protruding seal,</b> i.e., the image projected from the ring, and Shmuel prohibited it <b>due to</b> the potential <b>suspicion</b> that he had an object of idol worship in his hand. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a ring,</b> if <b>its seal protrudes it is prohibited to place it</b> on one’s finger, due to the suspicion of idol worship, <b>but it is permitted to seal</b> objects <b>with it.</b> In this case, the act of sealing creates an image that is sunken below the surface, which is not prohibited. However, if <b>its seal is sunken, it is permitted to place it</b> on one’s finger, <b>but it is prohibited to seal</b> objects <b>with it,</b> as that creates a protruding image.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And are we concerned about</b> arousing <b>suspicion</b> in a case of this kind? <b>But</b> what about that <b>certain synagogue that had been</b> destroyed in Eretz Yisrael and its stones were <b>relocated and</b> it was rebuilt so that it <b>sat in Neharde’a,</b> and <b>there was a statue [<i>andarta</i>]</b> of the king <b>in it.

Rather, it is assumed that the statue is there exclusively for purposes of ornamentation.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t Rabban Gamliel an individual?</b> According to this reasoning, his images of the moon should have been prohibited, as they would have aroused suspicion. The Gemara answers: <b>Since he is the <i>Nasi</i>,</b> the head of the Great Sanhedrin, <b>many</b> people <b>were</b> always <b>found with him,</b> and therefore there was no room for suspicion.

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabban Gamliel said to the Sages,</b> in explanation of his opinion that it is possible for the new moon to be visible so soon after the last sighting of the waning moon: <b>This is</b> the tradition that <b>I received from the house of my father’s father: Sometimes</b> the moon <b>comes by a long</b> path <b>and sometimes it comes by a short</b> one.",

This verse indicates that <b>it is</b> only <b>the sun</b> that <b>knows its going down,</b> i.e., its seasons and the times that it shines are the same every year.

Since, according to Rava, even if one did not intend to observe the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> but slept in the <i>sukka</i> for a different reason, his sleeping in the <i>sukka</i> constitutes the fulfillment of a mitzva to dwell there, then, if one did so at an inappropriate time, he is considered to have transgressed the prohibition against adding to the mitzvot.

The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> means that <b>he completed one blessing,</b> i.e., the first verse of the Priestly Blessing, but he still has two more blessings to recite.",
            "The Gemara raises a further difficulty: <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> dealing with the same issue: If <b>he completed all of his blessings.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Here,</b> with regard to the Priestly Blessings, <b>it is different, since if he encounters another congregation, he may recite the blessings again,</b> from which we learn that <b>the entire day is the</b> prescribed <b>time</b> of the mitzva. Therefore, even if he added a blessing of his own only after he finished reciting all three verses of the Priestly Blessing, he is still considered to have added to the mitzva in its prescribed time, and he therefore transgresses the prohibition against adding to mitzvot.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>And from where do you say</b> that if a mitzva may be performed again, the whole day is considered its prescribed time? <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: If the blood of sacrifices <b>that require</b> only <b>one sprinkling,</b> such as the firstborn offering, <b>became mingled with</b> the blood of other sacrifices that <b>require</b> only <b>one sprinkling,</b> the mixture of blood <b>is sprinkled once.</b> Similarly, if the blood of sacrifices that require <b>four sprinklings,</b> such as burnt-offerings, became mingled <b>with</b> the blood of other sacrifices that require <b>four sprinklings,</b> the mixture <b>is sprinkled four times.</b>",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that all the blasts and blessings are indispensable on Rosh HaShana? <b>Rabba said</b> that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Recite before Me on Rosh HaShana Kingship, Remembrances, and <i>Shofarot</i>. Kingship, so that you will crown Me as King over you; Remembrances, so that your remembrance will rise before Me for good. And with what? With the <i>shofar</i>.</b> Since these blessings constitute a single unit, one who did not recite them all has not fulfilled his obligation.",
            "§ The mishna taught: In the case of <b>one who recited the blessings</b> of the additional prayer <b>and</b> only <b>afterward a <i>shofar</i> became available to him, he sounds</b> a <i>tekia</i>, <b>sounds</b> a <i>terua</i> <b>and sounds</b> a <i>tekia</i>; this is a set that he repeats three times. The Gemara explains: <b>The reason</b> that he may do this is <b>that he did not have a <i>shofar</i> at the outset.</b> This indicates that if <b>he had a <i>shofar</i> at the outset, when he hears</b> the blasts <b>he must hear them by the order of the blessings,</b> i.e., one set must be sounded after each special blessing.",
            "The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Pappa bar Shmuel</b> once <b>rose to pray</b> on Rosh HaShana. <b>He said to his attendant: When I signal to you</b> that I have finished each of the blessings, <b>sound</b> the <i>shofar</i> <b>for me. Rava said to him: They said</b> that the <i>shofar</i> must be sounded after each blessing <b>only where there is a quorum of ten [<i>ḥever ir</i>],</b> not when it is sounded for an individual.",
            "<b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>When one hears</b> the <i>shofar</i> blasts, <b>he</b> must <b>hear them in order,</b> i.e., a <i>tekia</i>-<i>terua</i>-<i>tekia</i> set, <b>and upon the order of the blessings. In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? Where</b> there is <b>a quorum of ten [<i>ḥever ir</i>]. However, where</b> there is <b>not a <i>ḥever ir</i>, one</b> must <b>hear them in order, but</b> he need <b>not</b> hear them <b>upon the order of the blessings. And</b> in the case of <b>an individual who has not sounded</b> the <i>shofar</i>, <b>another may sound</b> it <b>for him. But</b> with regard to <b>an individual who has not recited the blessings, another may not recite the blessings for him.</b>",
            "<b>And</b> if one has to choose between hearing the <i>shofar</i> and reciting the blessings, the <b>mitzva</b> to be among <b>those who sound</b> the <i>shofar</i> is <b>more</b> important <b>than</b> the mitzva to be among <b>those who recite the blessings. How so?</b> If there are <b>two towns, in one</b> there are those who know how to <b>sound</b> the <i>shofar</i>, <b>and in the other</b> there are individuals who know how to <b>recite the blessings, one</b> should <b>go to the place where they sound</b> the <i>shofar</i>, <b>and</b> one does <b>not go to the place where they</b> know how to <b>recite the blessings.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: This <i>halakha</i> is <b>obvious.</b> Sounding the <i>shofar</i> <b>is</b> a mitzva <b>by Torah law,</b> whereas the additional prayer applies <b>by rabbinic law.</b> A mitzva that applies by Torah law is clearly more important. The Gemara answers: <b>No;</b> this seemingly superfluous ruling <b>is necessary</b> to teach that <b>although</b> in <b>this</b> town it is <b>certain</b> that the additional prayer will be recited <b>and</b> in <b>this</b> other town it is <b>uncertain</b> whether or not the <i>shofar</i> will be sounded, one should still go to the place where they know how to sound the <i>shofar</i> rather than the location where they know how to recite the blessings.",
            "§ The mishna states: <b>Just as the prayer leader is obligated</b> in the prayers of Rosh HaShana, <b>so too, every individual</b> is obligated in these prayers. Rabban Gamliel says: The prayer leader fulfills the obligation on behalf of the many. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the Rabbis <b>said to Rabban Gamliel: According to your statement, why does the congregation recite</b> the silent <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer</b> beforehand? <b>He said to them: In order that the prayer leader</b> should have time to prepare and <b>arrange his prayer.</b>",
            "<b>Rabban Gamliel said to</b> the Rabbis: <b>According to your statement,</b> that the prayer leader does not fulfill the obligation on behalf of the many, <b>why does the prayer leader descend before the ark</b> and recite the <i>Amida</i> prayer? <b>They said to him:</b> He does so <b>to fulfill</b> the obligation <b>of one who is not an expert</b> in prayer.

            "The Gemara questions this conclusion: <b>On the contrary,</b> the opposite is more reasonable: <b>Those</b> in the fields did not come to the synagogue <b>due to circumstances beyond their control,</b> and therefore they should be allowed to fulfill their obligation through the prayer leader.
