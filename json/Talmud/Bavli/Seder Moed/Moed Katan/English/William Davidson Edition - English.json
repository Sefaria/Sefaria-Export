            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may irrigate a field that requires irrigation on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival as well as during the Sabbatical Year, both from a newly emerged spring</b> that began to flow only during the Festival, <b>and from a spring that did not just emerge</b> and that has been flowing for some time. <b>However, one may not irrigate</b> a field <b>with rainwater</b> collected in a cistern, a procedure that requires excessive exertion, <b>or with water drawn with a shadoof [<i>kilon</i>],</b> a lever used to raise water with a bucket from deep down in a well.",
            "<b>And one may not construct circular ditches</b> around the bases of <b>grapevines</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival. <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says: One may not construct a new</b> water <b>channel during</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival or during the Sabbatical Year. And the Rabbis say: One may construct a new</b> water <b>channel during the Sabbatical Year and one may repair damaged</b> water channels <b>during</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival.</b>",
            "In addition to performing labor on one’s own property in order to avoid financial loss, it is also permitted to perform labor on the intermediate days of a Festival for the public welfare: <b>One may repair damaged water</b> cisterns <b>that are in the public domain, and clean them out</b> by removing the dirt and sediment that accumulated there; <b>one may repair roads, streets, and ritual baths; and one may tend to all</b> other <b>public needs.</b> So too, <b>one may mark graves</b> to inform the public of their ritual impurity, <b>and</b> inspectors <b>may even go out to</b> uproot <b>the</b> shoots of prohibited <b>diverse kinds</b> [<b><i>kilayim</i>]</b> that grew in the fields during the rainy season.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara begins by questioning the wording of the mishna: <b>Now</b> that <b>it has been said</b> that on the intermediate days of a Festival <b>one may irrigate</b> a field <b>from a newly emerged spring,</b> whose walls have not yet stabilized and are <b>likely to collapse,</b> necessitating laborious repairs, <b>is it necessary</b> to mention that one may irrigate a field <b>from a spring that did not just emerge,</b> whose walls have already stabilized <b>and are</b> therefore <b>not likely to collapse?</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>They say</b> that <b>it was necessary</b> to mention the second case as well. For <b>had</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> us the <i>halakha</i> with regard to only <b>a newly emerged spring, I would have said</b> that <b>here,</b> in the case of <b>a field that requires irrigation, yes,</b> one is permitted to irrigate from such a spring, but in the case of <b>a field that</b> ordinarily <b>suffices with rainwater, no,</b> one is not permitted to do so, <b>because it is likely to collapse. But</b> with regard to <b>a spring that did not just emerge, that is not likely to collapse, I</b> might <b>say that</b> one may provide supplementary irrigation <b>even</b> in the case of <b>a field that</b> ordinarily <b>suffices with rainwater.</b>",
            "Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that <b>a newly emerged spring is no different</b> from <b>a spring that did not just emerge.</b> In the case of <b>a field that requires irrigation, yes,</b> one may irrigate on the intermediate days of a Festival, while in the case of <b>a field that</b> ordinarily <b>suffices with rainwater, no,</b> one may not do so, even from an established spring.",
            "The Gemara raises a question with regard to a linguistic issue: <b>And from where</b> may it <b>be inferred that this</b> term, <b><i>beit hashelaḥin</i>,</b> a field that requires irrigation, <b>is a term</b> denoting <b>thirst,</b> implying that supplementary watering is necessary? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “And you were faint and weary”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:18). The term faint is referring to the thirst of the Israelites in the desert. <b>And,</b> in the standard Aramaic translation, <b>we translate</b> the verse as: <b>And you were thirsty [<i>meshalhei</i>] and weary.</b> The letters <i>ḥet</i> and <i>heh</i> are sometimes interchanged, and therefore the term <i>beit hashelaḥin</i> connotes a thirsty field.",
            "<b>And from where</b> may it <b>be inferred that this</b> term, <b><i>beit haba’al</i>,</b> a field that suffices with rainwater, <b>is a term denoting settlement,</b> i.e., an established field that does not require extensive upkeep? <b>As it is written: “For as a young man takes to himself [<i>yiv’al</i>] a virgin,</b> so shall your sons take you to themselves” (Isaiah 62:5). <b>And it is translated</b> in the Aramaic translation: <b>As a young man settles down with a virgin, so shall your sons become settled within you.</b> Similarly, <i>beit haba’al</i> is referring to a settled field that suffices with rainwater.",
            "The Gemara begins to clarify the underlying principle of the mishna, asking: <b>Who is the</b> anonymous <b><i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna who maintains <b>that</b> labor performed to prevent a considerable <b>loss,</b> such as watering a field that requires irrigation, <b>yes,</b> it is permitted on the intermediate days of a Festival; but labor performed to increase one’s <b>profit,</b> such as watering a field that ordinarily suffices with rainwater, <b>no,</b> it is not permitted? Furthermore, <b>even in a case</b> involving <b>loss, one may not</b> excessively <b>exert</b> oneself, as the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna renders prohibited all cases of watering fields with collected rainwater or with water drawn with a shadoof, even in a field that requires irrigation.",
            "<b>Rav Huna said: It is Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> In a field filled with trees, <b>one may draw water</b> via channels <b>from tree to tree, provided that</b> in doing so <b>he does not water the entire field.</b> As this field ordinarily suffices with rainwater, it is prohibited to water the entire field. Therefore, it is evident that Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov renders prohibited work performed to increase profit on the intermediate days of a Festival.",
            "The Gemara challenges this comparison: <b>Say that you heard</b> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> ben Ya’akov holds that labor performed only to increase <b>profit is not</b> permitted. But <b>did you hear him</b> prohibit excessive <b>exertion in a case of</b> considerable <b>loss?</b> This aspect of the mishna finds no expression in the words of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov.",
            "<b>Rather, Rav Pappa said:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From a newly emerged spring one may irrigate even a field that</b> ordinarily <b>suffices with rainwater;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: One may irrigate only a field requiring irrigation that dried up</b> and needs water. <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says: Neither the one nor the other. Furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> Owing to the exertion involved, <b>one may not divert a water channel</b> from its regular path in order <b>to water his garden or his ruin,</b> which is now being used for planting, <b>during the intermediate days of a Festival.</b>",
            "The Gemara first clarifies the case of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>What</b> does Rabbi Yehuda mean when he speaks of a field that <b>is dried up? If we say</b> that the field is <b>literally dried up</b> and the plants are already parched, <b>why do I</b> need <b>to water it? Abaye said:</b> It means that <b>the one spring</b> from which the field had been irrigated until now <b>dried up, but</b> in the meantime <b>another spring emerged.</b> If the field is not irrigated from this spring, it will be ruined.",
            "The Gemara explains the next clause of the <i>baraita</i>, which states: <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says: Neither the one nor the other.</b> By this he means that <b>it is no different</b> whether <b>the</b> original <b>spring dried up or did not dry up.</b> The guiding principle is: From <b>a newly emerged spring</b> one may <b>not</b> irrigate even a field that requires irrigation. In any event, Rabbi Yehuda seems to maintain an opinion that is like that of the mishna, i.e., that only a field that requires irrigation may be watered, but not a field that suffices with rainwater. And even in the case of a field that requires irrigation, excessive exertion is prohibited. ",
            "The Gemara challenges this understanding: <b>And from where</b> do you conclude that the mishna reflects the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda? <b>Perhaps Rabbi Yehuda stated</b> that <b>a field that requires irrigation, yes,</b> one may irrigate it on the intermediate days of a Festival, and <b>a field that suffices with rainwater, no,</b> one may not do so, <b>only</b> with regard to <b>a newly emerged spring,</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>as it is likely to collapse. But</b> in the case of <b>a spring that did not just emerge, which is not likely to collapse</b> because its walls have already stabilized, <b>even a field that</b> ordinarily <b>suffices with rainwater</b> may be irrigated.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> that were <b>so,</b> then <b>to whom,</b> i.e., to which <i>tanna</i>, <b>would you attribute</b> the mishna? According to this interpretation, the mishna does not correspond to any opinion, while according to the previous interpretation, it corresponds to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda. <b>Rather,</b> it must be that according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, a newly emerged spring is no different</b> from <b>a spring that did not just emerge. A field that requires irrigation, yes,</b> it may be irrigated, while <b>a field that suffices with rainwater, no,</b> it may not be irrigated. <b>And</b> the <i>baraita</i> opted <b>to teach</b> this dispute in the case of <b>a newly emerged spring</b> in order <b>to convey the far-reaching nature of</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir,</b> which states that <b>one may irrigate even from a newly emerged spring,</b> and <b>even a field that suffices with rainwater.</b>",
            "§ <b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disputed the following question: With regard to <b>one who weeds or one who waters seedlings on Shabbat, for what</b> prohibited labor <b>do we forewarn him?</b> Judicial punishment may be administered to a sinner only if he has been forewarned by two witnesses prior to the commission of his offense. This forewarning must include the specific transgression being violated, and on Shabbat it must include the specific category of prohibited labor that the action involves. <b>Rabba said:</b> It is <b>due to</b> the prohibition against <b>plowing. Rav Yosef said:</b> It is <b>due to</b> the prohibition against <b>sowing.</b>",
            "<b>Rabba said: According to my opinion</b> it <b>is reasonable. Just as the</b> usual objective <b>of plowing is to loosen the earth, so too, this,</b> weeding or watering, <b>loosens the earth. Rav Yosef said: According to my</b> opinion, it <b>is reasonable. Just as the</b> usual objective <b>of sowing is to cause the fruit to grow, here too,</b> weeding or watering <b>causes the fruit to grow.</b>",
            "<b>Abaye said to Rabba: According to your</b> opinion, it is <b>difficult, and according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yosef,</b> it is <b>difficult.</b> Abaye explains: <b>According to your</b> opinion, it is <b>difficult:</b> Is it true that <b>for</b> the prohibition against <b>plowing, yes,</b> he is forewarned, but <b>for</b> the prohibition against <b>sowing, no,</b> he is not forewarned? Similarly, <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yosef, it</b> is <b>difficult:</b> Can it be that <b>for</b> the prohibition against <b>sowing, yes,</b> he is forewarned, but <b>for</b> the prohibition against <b>plowing, no,</b> he is not forewarned? Everyone should agree that weeding and watering fall under the categories of both plowing and sowing.",
            "<b>And if you say that anywhere that there are two</b> possible categories of prohibited labor into which a particular action might fall, <b>one is liable</b> to be punished <b>for only one</b> of them, <b>didn’t Rav Kahana say:</b> If <b>one prunes</b> the branches of a vine on Shabbat <b>and he needs the wood</b> for firewood or any other purpose, <b>he is liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin-offerings? He is liable to bring <b>one</b> sin-offering <b>for</b> violating the primary category of <b>sowing,</b> as pruning vines facilitates their growth, and so it is a sub-category of sowing. <b>And</b> he is liable to bring <b>one</b> sin-offering <b>for</b> violating the primary category of <b>reaping,</b> as the essence of reaping is detaching that which one needs from the ground. Since he needs the wood that he is detaching from the vine, his action is considered reaping. Consequently, one action that incorporates two prohibited labors causes liability for both.",
            "The Gemara concludes: Indeed, it is <b>difficult</b> according to both opinions.",
            "<b>Rav Yosef raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba</b> from what is taught in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who weeds</b> in proximity to diverse kinds of seeds, <b>or covers</b> with earth the exposed roots of <b>diverse kinds, is flogged</b> for transgressing the prohibition against diverse kinds, i.e., tending different species of crops in one area of the same field, as it is stated: “You shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed” (Leviticus 19:19). <b>Rabbi Akiva says: Even one who maintains</b> in his field a mixture of species that he could have uprooted is flogged for violating the prohibition against diverse kinds of seeds.",
            "Rav Yosef explains: <b>Granted, according to my</b> opinion, <b>that I say</b> that one who weeds on Shabbat is forewarned <b>for</b> the prohibited labor of <b>sowing, this is</b> the reason he is liable to be punished with flogging for weeding diverse seeds: <b>Sowing diverse kinds is prohibited. But according to you, who said</b> that one who weeds on Shabbat is forewarned <b>for plowing,</b> why is one liable to be flogged for weeding in proximity to diverse kinds? <b>Is plowing prohibited</b> in connection with <b>diverse kinds?</b> At the time of plowing, there is no mixture of different species of crops, so plowing cannot be prohibited in this case.",
            "Rabba <b>said to him:</b> According to my opinion, one who weeds a field of diverse kinds is flogged not because he is guilty of plowing, but <b>for</b> violating the prohibition against <b>maintaining</b> a mixture of species in his field.",
            "The Gemara objects: <b>However, from</b> the fact <b>that it teaches in the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Akiva says: Even one who maintains</b> in his field a mixture of species is liable to be flogged, <b>it may be inferred that</b> according to <b>the</b> anonymous <b>first <i>tanna</i>,</b> the liability for weeding is <b>not for maintaining</b> diverse kinds, but for performing some other prohibited labor.",
            "The Gemara rejects this opinion: In fact, <b>the entire</b> <i>baraita</i> reflects the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, and it is stated</b> in the style of <b>what is the reason.</b> The <i>baraita</i> should be understood as follows: <b>What is the reason that one who weeds and one who covers</b> the exposed roots of <b>diverse kinds</b> with earth <b>is flogged?</b> He is flogged <b>for maintaining</b> diverse kinds in his field, <b>as Rabbi Akiva says: Even one who maintains</b> in his field a mixture of species is flogged.",
            "With regard to Rabbi Akiva’s opinion, the Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for <b>Rabbi Akiva’s</b> opinion? How did he derive this prohibition from the verses? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“You shall not sow your field with mingled seed”</b> (Leviticus 19:19). <b>I have</b> derived from this verse that <b>only sowing</b> diverse kinds is prohibited. <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>maintaining</b> diverse kinds, which does not involve any positive action, is also prohibited?",
            "<b>The verse states: “Diverse kinds, you shall not</b> sow <b>your field</b> with mingled seed” (Leviticus 19:19). The prohibition against planting different species of a crop in one area of the same field is preceded in the verse by the prohibition against crossbreeding livestock: “You shall not let your cattle gender with a diverse kind.” A slight change in punctuation yields the phrase: Diverse kinds in your field, you shall not, indicating that merely preserving diverse kinds in one’s field is prohibited.",
            "§ The Gemara returns to the original topic of discussion: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>One may irrigate a field that requires irrigation on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival as well as during the Sabbatical Year.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> with regard to the intermediate days of <b>a Festival,</b> where the prohibition against irrigation is <b>due to</b> the mandate to avoid excessive <b>exertion</b> on the Festival, <b>in a case of</b> considerable <b>loss, the Sages permitted</b> one to exert himself. <b>However,</b> during the <b>Sabbatical Year, both according to</b> the <b>one who said</b> that one who waters is liable <b>due to</b> the prohibition against <b>sowing, and according to the one who said</b> that one is liable <b>due to</b> the prohibition against <b>plowing, are sowing and plowing permitted during the Sabbatical Year?</b> How can these actions be permitted when the Torah explicitly renders prohibited working the land during the Sabbatical Year?",
            "<b>Abaye said:</b> The mishna is referring <b>to the Sabbatical Year in the present time,</b> when its prohibitions are only by rabbinic decree, <b>and it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> When the verse states: <b>“And this is the manner of the release,</b> every creditor <b>will release</b> that which he has lent to his neighbor” (Deuteronomy 15:2), <b>the verse speaks of two releases: One</b> is <b>the release of land,</b> that one must refrain from working the land, <b>and the other</b> is <b>the release of money,</b> that one must refrain from collecting debts.",
            "This verse equates these two releases, indicating that <b>when you</b> are mandated by Torah law to <b>release land, you</b> must <b>release money, and when you</b> are <b>not</b> mandated to <b>release land, you need not release money.</b> This indicates that according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, at the present time, the release of land is not mandated by Torah law. Therefore, observance of the Sabbatical Year is mandated only by rabbinic law, and the Sages were lenient in a case of significant loss.",
            "<b>Rava said: Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the mishna was taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and maintain that the observance of the Sabbatical Year, even at the present time, is mandated by Torah law, one can understand the leniency in the mishna. The reason for the leniency with regard to irrigation is because only <b>primary categories of labor were prohibited by the Merciful One,</b> i.e., by Torah law,"
        ],
        [
            "whereas <b>the subcategories</b> of labor that are derived from them, e.g., watering, <b>were not prohibited by the Merciful One,</b> i.e., by Torah law, but only by rabbinic law; and in a case of loss the Sages were lenient. The source for this distinction is <b>as it is written: “But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land,</b> a sabbath for the Lord: <b>Your field you shall not sow,</b> and your vineyard you shall not prune. That which grows of its own accord of your harvest you shall not reap, nor gather the grapes of your undressed vines” (Leviticus 25:4–5).",
            "<b>Since pruning is included in</b> the principal category of <b>sowing,</b> as its objective is to encourage the plant’s growth, <b>and picking</b> grapes <b>is included in</b> the principal category of <b>reaping</b> grain, as both involve removal of produce from a plant, <b>for</b> the purpose of teaching <b>what <i>halakha</i> did the Merciful One write them?</b> Why did the Torah explicitly prohibit pruning and picking grapes, rather than sufficing with the general prohibitions against sowing and reaping?",
            "The Gemara answers that these were individually enumerated <b>to say</b> that only <b>for these subcategories</b> of labor <b>is one liable</b> to be flogged, while <b>for other</b> subcategories of labor, i.e., watering a field, <b>one is not liable.</b> Consequently, there are only four types of labor that are prohibited by Torah law during the Sabbatical Year: Sowing and its subcategory of pruning, as well as reaping and its subcategory of grape picking. All other subcategories of labor are prohibited only by rabbinic decree.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is there really <b>no</b> liability for other subcategories of labor? <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Your field you shall not sow, and your vineyard you shall not prune”</b> (Leviticus 25:4). <b>I have</b> derived from here an explicit prohibition <b>only</b> against <b>sowing and pruning. From where</b> do I derive that <b>weeding,</b> i.e., uprooting weeds, <b>hoeing, and cutting weeds,</b> even without uprooting them, are also prohibited? <b>The verse states: “Your field</b> you shall <b>not</b> sow” and <b>“your vineyard</b> you shall <b>not</b> prune.” This wording indicates that <b>no labor</b> may be performed <b>in your field, and no labor</b> may be performed <b>in your vineyard.</b>",
            "Similarly, <b>from where</b> is it derived that <b>one may not prune trees, and one may not trim dry branches</b> from trees, <b>and one</b> may <b>not cut large branches [<i>mefasegin</i>] from trees? The verse states: “Your field</b> you shall <b>not</b> sow” and <b>“your vineyard</b> you shall <b>not</b> prune,” thereby teaching that <b>no labor</b> may be performed <b>in your field, and no labor</b> may be performed <b>in your vineyard.</b>",
            "Similarly, <b>from where</b> is it derived that <b>one</b> may <b>not fertilize</b> fields and vineyards, <b>and one may not remove stones</b> that surround the base of a tree and impede its growth, <b>and one</b> may <b>not</b> cover exposed roots with <b>dust, and one may not fumigate a tree</b> in order to exterminate worms? <b>The verse states: “Your field</b> you shall <b>not</b> sow” and <b>“your vineyard</b> you shall <b>not</b> prune,” thereby indicating that <b>no labor</b> may be performed <b>in your field, and no labor</b> may be performed <b>in your vineyard.</b>",
            "The apparent conclusion from this is that all labor in a field or a vineyard is prohibited. One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one may</b> also <b>not hoe lightly under olive</b> trees <b>and one may not hoe under grapevines, and one may not fill cracks</b> in the ground <b>with water, and one may not construct circular ditches</b> around the bases of <b>grapevines</b> in order to collect rainwater. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Your field you shall not sow.”</b>",
            "The Gemara explains the derivation: <b>Sowing was included</b> in the general prohibition against performing agricultural labors during the Sabbatical Year, as the verse states “But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land” (Leviticus 25:4). <b>Why was</b> sowing <b>singled out</b> and mentioned explicitly? In order <b>to compare</b> other types of labor <b>to it</b> and to <b>say to you: Just as sowing is unique in that it is labor</b> performed both <b>in the field and in the vineyard, so too, any</b> other <b>labor</b> performed both <b>in the field and in the vineyard</b> is prohibited. However, labors performed only in the vineyard but not in the field, i.e., whose objective is merely to sustain the vines from year to year, such as the labors mentioned above, are permitted. In any case, this <i>baraita</i> indicates that many subcategories of labor are prohibited during the seventh year, and not just sowing and pruning, as Rava had stated.",
            "The Gemara rejects this opinion: These labors, with the exceptions of sowing, pruning, grape picking, and reaping, are all prohibited only <b>by rabbinic law, and the verse</b> that is cited as a source from the Torah <b>is a mere support,</b> and not a bona fide source.",
            "Incidental to this discussion, the Gemara asks: <b>Is</b> light <b>hoeing</b> under olive trees in fact <b>permitted during the Sabbatical Year? Isn’t it written: “But the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie fallow”</b> (Exodus 23:11), and it is taught with regard to this verse: <b>“You shall let it rest” from light hoeing, “and lie fallow” from clearing</b> the field of <b>stones.</b> This indicates that light hoeing is indeed prohibited during the Sabbatical Year.",
            "<b>Rav Ukva bar Ḥama said: There are two</b> types of light <b>hoeing, one</b> whose objective is <b>to strengthen</b> the <b>trees, and another</b> that is intended <b>to seal cracks.</b> There is a practical halakhic difference between them: Hoeing performed in order <b>to strengthen the tree is prohibited,</b> as it is similar to plowing in that it enhances the tree’s growth. However, hoeing undertaken in order <b>to seal cracks is permitted,</b> as by doing so one prevents damage to the tree.",
            "§ <b>It was stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar</b> disagreed with regard to <b>one who plows during the Sabbatical Year. One said: He is flogged</b> for doing so, <b>while the</b> other <b>one said: He is not flogged.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that they disagree with regard to</b> the principle that <b>Rabbi Avin</b> said that <b>Rabbi Ile’a said,</b> and one accepts this principle while the other does not. <b>As, Rabbi Avin said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ile’a said: Wherever a generalization is stated</b> in the Torah <b>as a positive</b> mitzva, <b>and a detail</b> relating to that generalization is stated <b>as a negative</b> mitzva, <b>one does not apply</b> the hermeneutical principle of <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization,</b> according to which the <i>halakha</i> under discussion is expanded to all cases that resemble the detail.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>The one who said</b> that one who plows during the Sabbatical Year <b>is flogged does not</b> accept the principle <b>that Rabbi Avin</b> said that <b>Rabbi Ile’a said.</b> Accordingly, he expounds the verses as follows: The verse “But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land” (Leviticus 25:4) is a generalization stated as a positive mitzva. The continuation of the verse is “Your field you shall not sow,” which is a detail stated as a negative mitzva. This is followed by another generalization: “For it shall be a year of rest for the land” (Leviticus 25:5). By applying the principle of a generalization, a detail, and a generalization, one can derive that there is a prohibition against performing any agricultural task that is similar to sowing, including plowing.",
            "<b>And the one who said</b> that <b>one is not flogged</b> for plowing <b>holds</b> in accordance with the ruling <b>that Rabbi Avin</b> stated in the name of Rabbi Ile’a. Therefore, the prohibition stated as a detail, i.e., the prohibition against sowing, is not extended to include any other labor.

            "Based on this ruling, the Gemara clarifies several practical issues: It is <b>obvious</b> that if the channel is <b>half a handbreadth</b> deep and he wants to restore it to a depth <b>of three handbreadths, since water does not flow</b> through a three-handbreadth-deep channel in sufficient quantity, <b>it is nothing</b> at all and it is certainly prohibited to exert oneself with work that provides insignificant benefit.

This verse teaches <b>that</b> the leper <b>is prohibited</b> from engaging <b>in conjugal relations,</b> as the words <b>his tent</b> refer <b>only</b> to <b>his wife, as it is stated: “Go, say to them: Return again to your tents” (</b>Deuteronomy 5:27). <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The verse states: “And after he is cleansed, <b>they shall count for him seven days”</b> (Ezekiel 44:26), indicating that he is prohibited from having conjugal relations during <b>the days of his counting, but not</b> during <b>the days of his confirmed</b> leprosy.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says:</b> Since the verse indicates that the prohibition to engage in conjugal relations applies during <b>the seven days of his counting</b> before becoming ritually pure, it follows based on an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference that the prohibition should also apply during <b>the days of his confirmed</b> leprosy, when his impurity is more severe.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya said: I deliberated</b> this matter <b>before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi and said: <b>Have you</b> not <b>taught us, our teacher,</b> that King <b>Jotham was only</b> born <b>to Uzziah,</b> the king of Judah, <b>during the days of his confirmed</b> leprosy? This would indicate that a confirmed leper is permitted to engage in conjugal relations. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: I too said this;</b> I am also of the opinion that a confirmed leper is permitted to engage in conjugal relations, in contrast to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle do <b>they disagree?</b> The Gemara explains that <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, holds: The Merciful One revealed</b> the prohibition of conjugal relations with one’s wife <b>during the days of his counting; and all the more so</b> the prohibition applies <b>during his days of confirmed</b> leprosy, when his ritual impurity is more severe. <b>And one Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>maintains: That which</b> the verse <b>revealed, it revealed, but that which it did not reveal, it did not reveal;</b> the prohibition is not interpreted in a way that adds an extra stringency beyond what is stated explicitly in the Torah.",
            "§ The Gemara returns to the original dispute with regard to the priest’s examination of the symptoms of leprosy. <b>Is this to say that the matter depends upon</b> the discretion of <b>the priest,</b> i.e., the priest can decide whether to declare the affected person ritually pure or impure or whether to examine the leprous symptoms or not? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, and</b> so too <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“But on the day it appears in him”</b> (Leviticus 13:14), from which it may be inferred that <b>there is a day when you examine</b> the symptoms found in <b>him and there is a day when you do not examine</b> those symptoms.",
            "<b>From here they stated:</b> With regard to <b>a bridegroom upon whom leprous symptoms came into being, we give him the seven days of the</b> wedding <b>feast</b> before the examination that determines ritual purity or impurity. This ruling applies whether the leprous symptoms appeared <b>upon him, upon his house, or upon his clothing.

            "<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The ruling is correct, but <b>there is no need</b> to prove it from this verse, as a much simpler proof can be brought from a different source. <b>It says: “Then the priest shall command that they empty the house</b> before the priest goes into it to see the plague, so that all that is in the house be not made unclean” (Leviticus 14:36). <b>If we delay</b> the priest’s examination of the house in order to give the owner time to remove his utensils and prevent them from contracting ritual impurity, which is merely <b>an optional matter, all the more so</b> should we delay his examination <b>for a matter of mitzva,</b> e.g., so as not to detract from the bridegroom’s joy or from the joy of a Festival.",

            "<b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: It was necessary</b> for the Torah to state both verses: “But on the day it appears in him” (Leviticus 13:14), as well as: “Then the priest shall command that they empty the house” (Leviticus 14:36). <b>As, if the Merciful One had written</b> only: <b>“But on the day it appears in him,” I would have said</b> that <b>for a matter of mitzva, yes,</b> one may delay the priest’s examination of the leprous symptoms, but <b>for an optional matter, no,</b> one may not, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And from where</b> does <b>Rava</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> that the examination is performed <b>during the day but not at night?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> the verse: <b>“As far as the priest’s eyes can see”</b> (Leviticus 13:12), which indicates that the priest must be able to carry out a careful examination of the leprous symptoms; this cannot be done at night, when his vision is limited. <b>And Abaye</b> could say that <b>this</b> verse <b>is necessary to exclude</b> a priest who is <b>blind in one eye</b> from inspecting symptoms of leprosy, as it says “eyes,” in the plural.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But Rava also requires</b> this verse <b>to</b> teach <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i>, i.e., that a priest who is blind in one eye is unfit to examine symptoms of leprosy.

            "If so, <b>from where</b> does Rava derive the <i>halakha</i> that a priest examines leprous symptoms <b>during the day but not at night?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> the verse that quotes a homeowner saying to a priest: <b>“There seems to me as it were a plague in the house”</b> (Leviticus 14:35), which emphasizes that the leprous symptom is seen <b>by me, and not by</b> way of <b>my light,</b> i.e., that this takes place during the day.

After the flesh had decomposed, the bones would be collected, placed in a coffin, and buried in a vault together with the bones of the deceased individual’s ancestors.

The fact that he did not do so indicates that one must not mix one joy with another.",
            "The Gemara raises a question: <b>Perhaps,</b> however, it may be derived from here only that <b>we may not delay</b> a wedding to be on a Festival, just as King Solomon did not delay the Temple dedication to be on the Festival, but nevertheless, <b>where it happens</b> to occur that way, <b>we may</b> indeed <b>prepare</b> a feast to celebrate both occasions together. The Gemara answers: If this were permitted, Solomon <b>should have left a small</b> part of the Temple unfinished until the Festival, and thereby arranged for a joint celebration of the dedication of the Temple and the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>.",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>One may not leave</b> any part of <b>the building of the Temple</b> undone, as a mitzva should be completed as quickly as possible. The Gemara modifies its previous opinion: Solomon <b>should have left the cubit-</b>wide plates with spikes, which were designed to <b>eliminate the ravens,</b> unfinished. The roof of the Temple was fitted with sharp metal spikes to deter the ravens, who were attracted by the smell of the sacrificial meat, from perching there. Although this was not considered a part of the building itself, delaying its installation would have allowed Solomon to delay the celebration of the Temple dedication.",
            "The Gemara rejects this opinion as well: <b>The cubit</b>-wide plates with spikes to <b>eliminate the ravens was a necessary</b> element <b>in the building of the Temple,</b> and consequently Solomon could not delay its construction either. <b>Rather,</b> the proof is <b>from the redundancy</b> in <b>the verse.

            "§ Apropos the discussion of the celebration at Solomon’s dedication of the Temple, the Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Parnakh said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: That year,</b> the Jewish people <b>did not observe Yom Kippur,</b> as the seven-day celebration of the dedication of the Temple coincided with Yom Kippur and all seven days were celebrated with feasting. <b>And</b> the people <b>were worried and said: Perhaps the enemies of the Jewish people,</b> a euphemism for the Jewish people themselves, <b>have become liable to be destroyed</b> for the transgression of eating on Yom Kippur, which is punishable by <i>karet</i>. <b>A Divine Voice issued forth and said to them: All of you are designated for life in the World-to-Come.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What derivation</b> led them to conclude that it was permitted for them to eat on Yom Kippur?

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if they had firm basis for their behavior, <b>why were they worried?</b> The Gemara answers that one can refute this <i>a fortiori</i> inference as follows: <b>There,</b> at the dedication of the Tabernacle, Shabbat was desecrated only <b>for the necessities</b> of the Temple service to God on <b>High,</b> i.e., by sacrificing offerings. <b>Here,</b> at the dedication of the Temple, they desecrated Yom Kippur by eating and drinking, which was for <b>the need of common</b> mortals. Based on this distinction the Gemara suggests: <b>Here too,</b> at the dedication of the Temple <b>they should</b> have <b>performed</b> the rites of the sacrificial offerings and <b>they should not</b> have <b>eaten or drunk.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There is no</b> complete <b>rejoicing without eating and drinking.</b>",
            "With regard to the proof itself, the Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive that the offerings brought at the dedication of <b>the Tabernacle overrode Shabbat? If we say</b> it is <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the offerings brought by the tribal princes: <b>“On the first day”</b> (Numbers 7:12) <b>and “on the seventh day”</b> (Numbers 7:48), this is not a conclusive proof, as <b>perhaps</b> this refers not to the seventh day of the week but to <b>the seventh</b> day <b>of</b> sacrificial <b>offerings.</b> Perhaps they skipped Shabbat and did not sacrifice offerings connected to the dedication of the Tabernacle on that day. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: The verse</b> also <b>states: “On the day of the eleventh day”</b> (Numbers 7:72). The repetition of the word day indicates that <b>just as a day is all</b> one <b>continuous</b> period of time, <b>so too, the eleven</b> days <b>were all</b> one <b>continuous</b> period of time, with no break in the middle, even for Shabbat.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps</b> this refers only to <b>days that are fit</b> for an individual’s offerings, i.e., the offerings were sacrificed on eleven consecutive days that were suitable for sacrificing the offerings of an individual, but not on Shabbat. The Gemara answers: In <b>another verse it is written: “On the day of the twelfth day”</b> (Numbers 7:78), indicating that <b>just as a day is all</b> one <b>continuous</b> period of time, <b>so too, the twelve days were all</b> one <b>continuous</b> period of time.",
            "The Gemara asks again: <b>But perhaps here too</b> this is referring to <b>days that are fit</b> for sacrificing the offerings of an individual? The Gemara rejects this opinion: <b>If so, why do I</b> need <b>two verses,</b> the verse with regard to the eleventh day and the verse with regard to the twelfth day, to teach the same principle? The fact that the Torah uses repetitive phraseology in both verses indicates that all the days were consecutive, without a break for Shabbat.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive that the feasting at the time of the dedication of <b>the Temple overrides Yom Kippur,</b> so that the people did not have to fast? <b>If we say</b> it is derived <b>from that which is written: Fourteen days, perhaps</b> this is referring to <b>days that are fit</b> for feasting, to the exclusion of Yom Kippur. The Gemara answers: This is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the word <b>“day”</b> mentioned in this context <b>and</b> the word <b>“day”</b> mentioned <b>there,</b> with regard to the dedication of the Tabernacle.

The term <b>“joyful”</b> is referring to the fact <b>they had enjoyed the splendor of the Divine Presence,</b> as there was a revelation of the Divine Presence when the offerings were sacrificed in the Temple.

The verse should be understood as follows: <b>“And after he is purified”; after he has separated from</b> his <b>deceased</b> relative. <b>“They shall count for him seven days”; these are the seven days of his counting</b> before he may purify himself. <b>“And on the day that he goes into the Sanctuary, into the inner court, to minister in the Sanctuary, he shall sacrifice his sin</b>-offering, says the Lord God” (Ezekiel 44:27);"
        ],
        [
            "<b>this is</b> the meal-offering of <b>a tenth of an ephah</b> of flour, which every priest would bring on the day he began serving in the Temple. But as long as he is ritually impure, whether because he had come into contact with a corpse or due to leprosy, he may not send his offerings to the Temple; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The verse states: “And on the day that <b>he goes into</b> the Sanctuary, into the inner court, to minister in the Sanctuary <b>he shall sacrifice</b> his sin offering.” This teaches that <b>when he is fit to enter</b> the Sanctuary, <b>he is fit to sacrifice</b> an offering. But <b>when he is not fit to go into</b> the Sanctuary, i.e., when he is ritually impure, <b>he is not fit to sacrifice</b> an offering. This implies that a leper may not send his offerings to the Temple to be sacrificed on the altar, as he himself is not fit to enter the Temple.",
            "§ Having discussed some of the restrictions applying to a person who was ostracized, the Gemara explains some of the basic principles relating to ostracism: <b>Rava said: From where do we</b> derive <b>that a court agent is sent to summon</b> the defendant <b>to</b> appear before the <b>court</b> before he is ostracized? <b>As it is written: “And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab”</b> (Numbers 16:12). <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that we summon</b> the defendant, that he himself must appear before the <b>court? As it is written: “And Moses said to Korah: Be you and all your congregation</b> before the Lord, you and they, and Aaron, tomorrow” (Numbers 16:16).",
            "From where is it derived that the defendant must be told that he is being summoned to appear <b>before a great man? As it is written:</b> “And Moses said to Korah: Be you and all your congregation <b>before the Lord”</b> (Numbers 16:16). From where is it derived that the summons must mention the names of both parties: <b>You and so-and-so,</b> the plaintiff? <b>As it is written: “You, and they, and Aaron”</b> (Numbers 16:16). From where is it derived <b>that we set a date</b> for the court proceedings? <b>As it is written: “Tomorrow”</b> (Numbers 16:16). From where is it derived that a second <b>date</b> must be set <b>after</b> the first <b>date,</b> if the defendant did not heed the first summons? <b>As it is written: “They did cry there, Pharaoh, king of Egypt is but a noise; he has passed the time appointed…</b>Surely as Tabor is among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, so shall he come” (Jeremiah 46:17). Although a time had been appointed and it had passed, it was not canceled entirely but pushed off to a later date.",
            "<b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that if</b> the summoned person <b>behaves disrespectfully toward the agent of the court, and</b> the agent <b>comes</b> back <b>and reports</b> his conduct, that <b>this is not considered slander? As it is written: “Will you put out the eyes of these men?”</b> (Numbers 16:14). Dathan and Abiram spoke these words to the messenger that Moses had sent to them, and the messenger reported them back to Moses.",
            "<b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that we ostracize</b> one who does not obey a court summons? <b>As it is written: “Curse Meroz”</b> (Judges 5:23), who was ostracized for not coming to battle after having been summoned. From where is it derived that the ostracized person must be told <b>that it</b> was <b>the decision of a great man</b> to ostracized him? <b>As it is written:</b> “Curse Meroz, <b>said the messenger of the Lord”</b> (Judges 5:23). <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that,</b> if he fails to mend his ways, <b>we excommunicate</b> such a person more harshly, putting him under the most severe form of excommunication? <b>As it is written:</b> “Curse Meroz…<b>curse bitterly</b> its inhabitants” (Judges 5:23), implying that one curse is followed by another, i.e., lesser ostracism is followed by harsh excommunication.",
            "From where is it derived <b>that</b> the curse applies to anyone who <b>eats or drinks with, or stands within, four cubits of</b> the ostracized person? <b>As it is written:</b> “Curse bitterly <b>its inhabitants”</b> (Judges 5:23), in reference to all those sitting together with Meroz. <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that we detail his sin in public? As it is written:</b> “Curse bitterly its inhabitants, <b>because they did not come to the help of the Lord”</b> (Judges 5:23).",
            "<b>And Ulla said: Barak ostracized Meroz with</b> the blowing of <b>four hundred <i>shofarot</i></b> due to his failure to come.

This star, which did not help the Jewish people, was cursed.",
            "<b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> the court <b>may declare the property of</b> one who does not obey its orders <b>as ownerless? As it is written: “And that whoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the Elders, all his substance shall be forfeited [<i>yaḥoram</i>] and himself separated from the congregation of the exiles”</b> (Ezra 10:8). “Shall be forfeited” is referring to excommunication.",
            "<b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that we may contend with</b> such a person, <b>and curse</b> him, <b>and beat</b> him, <b>and pull out</b> his <b>hair, and make</b> him <b>take an oath</b> in order to prevent him from sinning? <b>As it is written: “And I contended with them, and cursed them, and beat some of them, and pulled out their hair, and made them take oath</b> by God” (Nehemiah 13:25).",
            "<b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that we may shackle</b> his hands and feet, <b>chain</b> him, <b>and apply pressure? As it is written: “Whether it be for death, or for banishment [<i>lishroshi</i>], or for confiscation of goods, or for imprisonment”</b> (Ezra 7:26). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the word <b>“<i>lishroshi</i>,”</b> translated here as banishment? <b>Adda Mari said</b> that <b>Neḥemya bar Baruch said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> This is <b>pressure.</b> Since this expression is also unclear, the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b>pressure?

            "<b>Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana said to him: Rav Ḥisda said as follows:</b> Before excommunicating a person, the court <b>warns him</b> three times, on <b>Monday, Thursday, and</b> the following <b>Monday.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>This applies</b> in a case where one ignores <b>a monetary judgment</b> that was issued against him.

            "§ The Gemara relates that <b>a certain butcher behaved disrespectfully toward Rav Tuvi bar Mattana. Abaye and Rava were appointed</b> to the case <b>and ostracized him.

Shall <b>he be released</b> from his decree of ostracism? <b>His</b> decree of <b>ostracism has not</b> yet <b>been in effect for</b> the usual <b>thirty days.</b> On the other hand, <b>shall he not be released</b> from ostracism? But <b>the Sages wish to enter</b> his shop and purchase meat, and they are presently unable to do so. What, then, is the most appropriate course of action?",
            "<b>He said to Rav Idi bar Avin:</b> Have <b>you heard anything with regard to such</b> a case?

            "The Gemara comments: <b>Apparently, Abaye maintains</b> that if <b>three</b> people <b>ostracized</b> one, <b>three others may not come and release him.</b> This is derived from the fact that Abaye was concerned about releasing the butcher from ostracism and did not delegate the task to someone else.",
            "<b>As a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If <b>three</b> people <b>ostracized</b> someone, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>three others coming and releasing him</b> from his decree of ostracism? The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who was ostracized by the teacher</b> of Torah for having acted disrespectfully toward him <b>is</b> considered <b>ostracized with regard to the student,</b> and the latter must keep his distance from him. However, <b>one who was ostracized by the student is not</b> considered <b>ostracized with regard to the teacher.</b>",

            "The Gemara says: <b>Learn three</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>from this</b> <i>baraita</i>. <b>Learn from this</b> that in the case of <b>a student who ostracizes</b> someone <b>due to</b> an insult to <b>his dignity</b> and not because the ostracized person was guilty of some transgression, <b>his</b> decree of <b>ostracism is valid.</b> Were the case one where one was ostracized due to sin, everyone is required to respect the decree of ostracism, even the student’s teacher. <b>And learn from this</b> that <b>each and every one</b> who participated in the decree of ostracism <b>nullifies his</b> own <b>portion</b> of the decree of ostracism, as the <i>baraita</i> speaks of: His portion. <b>And learn from this</b> that if <b>three</b> people <b>ostracized</b> another person, <b>three other</b> people <b>may not come and nullify</b> the decree of ostracism.

            "<b>Ameimar said: The <i>halakha</i> is</b> that if <b>three</b> people <b>ostracize</b> another person, <b>three others may come and nullify</b> the decree of ostracism. <b>Rav Ashi said to Ameimar: But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> If <b>one of the students had ostracized</b> another person, <b>and he died</b> before releasing him from the decree of ostracism, <b>his portion is not nullified?

The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>No,</b> this means that the decree of ostracism remains in force <b>until three other people come and nullify</b> it.",
            "§ <b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Ostracism does not</b> apply <b>for less than</b> a period of <b>thirty days, and admonition,</b> which is less severe than ostracism, <b>does not</b> apply <b>for less than</b> a period of <b>seven days.

            "<b>Rav Ḥisda said: Our</b> decree of <b>ostracism</b> in Babylonia has the power <b>of their admonition</b> in Eretz Yisrael.

The Gemara asks: Is <b>their admonition</b> in Eretz Yisrael only <b>seven</b> days <b>and no more?

            "This incident demonstrates <b>that, apparently, admonition of those</b> who live in Eretz Yisrael lasts for <b>thirty days</b> and not for seven days.

            "The Gemara raises a question about the ruling itself: <b>And did Shmuel</b> actually <b>say</b> that we are concerned that <b>perhaps another</b> man will come and betroth the woman <b>first? But didn’t Rav Yehuda say that Shmuel said: Every day a Divine Voice issues forth and says: The daughter of so-and-so</b> is destined to be the wife of <b>so-and-so; the field of so-and-so</b> will belong <b>to so-and-so?</b> If this is the case, why should one be concerned lest another betroth her first?

            "<b>Rather,</b> Shmuel’s statement should be understood as follows: <b>Perhaps another</b> man will come and betroth her <b>first by means of</b> praying for divine <b>mercy.</b> In other words, Shmuel is concerned that the rival may beseech God to cancel the decree of the Divine Voice, and therefore the first man needs to hurry and betroth the woman before the other one has a chance to pray that he should take her from him.",

It is <b>from the Torah, as it is written: “Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said: The thing comes from the Lord,</b> we cannot speak to you either bad or good” (Genesis 24:50). <b>From the Prophets, as it is written: “But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the Lord”</b> (Judges 14:4). <b>From the Writings, as it is written: “House and riches are the inheritance of fathers; but a prudent woman is from the Lord”</b> (Proverbs 19:14).",

This implies that every man thought that his wife had secluded herself with Moses and sinned, although this was certainly not the case. This demonstrates that it is possible to suspect an absolutely innocent person. The Gemara answers: <b>There they did it out of hatred</b> for Moses. They did not actually suspect him of wrongdoing.

Here,</b> in the instructions given to Aaron not to mourn the deaths of his sons, <b>it is written: “Let the hair of your heads not grow loose [<i>tifra’u</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 10:6), which indicates that ordinary mourners are required to grow their hair long. <b>And there,</b> with regard to a nazirite, <b>it is written: “He shall let the hair of his head grow long [<i>pera</i>]”</b> (Numbers 6:5). <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of the nazirite, he must grow his hair for <b>thirty</b> days, <b>so too, here</b> a mourner must grow his hair for <b>thirty</b> days.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And there,</b> with regard to a nazirite, <b>from where do we</b> derive that he must grow his hair for thirty days? Nowhere is this explicitly stated with regard to a nazirite. The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Mattana said: An unspecified naziriteship,</b> when one takes a vow of naziriteship without specifying for how long, extends for <b>thirty days. What is the reason</b> for this? <b>The verse states: “He shall be sacred,</b> and he shall let the hair of his head grow” (Numbers 6:5), and <b>“He shall be [<i>yihye</i>],”</b> which is written <i>yod</i>, <i>heh</i>, <i>yod</i>, <i>heh</i>, <b>has a numerical value [<i>gimatriyya</i>] of thirty,</b> as <i>yod</i> has a numerical value of ten and <i>heh</i> has a numerical value of five.

            "<b>Ameimar taught</b> the previous discussion <b>as follows: Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> an alternative version of the discussion: <b>For a joyous social gathering one is permitted to enter immediately.</b> The Gemara poses a question: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>For joyous celebrations and for joyous social gatherings,</b> one must wait <b>thirty</b> days?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>This is not difficult. This</b> ruling, of the <i>baraita</i>, is referring <b>to an initial</b> gathering, when the mourner is the first in the group of friends to host. The <i>baraita</i> teaches that in such a situation the mourner is required to wait thirty days before doing so. <b>That</b> ruling, of Rabba bar bar Ḥana, is referring <b>to a reciprocal</b> gathering. The mourner’s friends have already hosted these gatherings, and now it is his turn to host. Since he is required to host such a gathering for his colleagues, he need not postpone it. Rather, he may host the group immediately.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>With regard to all</b> other <b>deceased</b> relatives, <b>one rends</b> his garment the length <b>of a handbreadth,</b> and that suffices. <b>In</b> the case of <b>his father or mother,</b> he must rend his garment <b>until he reveals his heart. Rabbi Abbahu said: What is the verse</b> that teaches that the rent must be a handbreadth? <b>“And David took hold of his clothes and rent them”</b> (II Samuel 1:11), <b>and taking hold cannot</b> be done for a garment <b>less than a handbreadth.</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> teaches further: <b>With regard to all</b> other deceased relatives, <b>even if he is wearing ten garments,</b> one on top of the other, <b>he rends only</b> his <b>outer</b> garment. But <b>in</b> the case of <b>his father or mother, he must rend them all.</b> Failure to rend <b>his undergarment,</b> however, <b>does not invalidate</b> the fulfillment of the mitzva.",
            "<b>Both a man and a woman</b> are required to rend their garments. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: A woman</b> first <b>rends</b> her <b>inner</b> garment <b>and turns</b> it <b>around,</b> so that the tear is <b>on her back.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>Let us say</b> that this is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i></b> with regard to whether or not some mourning rites are observed even on Shabbat, for it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One whose deceased</b> relative <b>is laid out before him eats in another room.</b> If <b>he does not have another room, he eats in the house of a friend.

            "The Gemara elaborates upon the <i>halakhot</i> mentioned in this <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where do we</b> derive that one must rend his clothing for <b>his father, his mother, and his teacher who taught him Torah? As it is written</b> with regard to the prophet Elijah, when he ascended to Heaven in a tempest: <b>“And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and their horsemen”</b> (II Kings 2:12). The Gemara interprets this verse as follows: <b>“My father, my father”; this</b> comes to teach that one must rend his garments for the death of <b>his father or mother. “The chariots of Israel and their horsemen”; this</b> comes to include also <b>one’s teacher who taught him Torah.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> may it <b>be inferred</b> that this is referring to one’s teacher? The Gemara explains: <b>As</b> the verse <b>was translated by Rav Yosef: My teacher, my teacher, who was better for</b> the protection of the <b>Jewish people with his prayers than</b> an army with <b>chariots and horsemen.</b>",
            "<b>And from where do we</b> derive that these rents <b>are never</b> to be properly <b>mended?

            "<b>Reish Lakish said to Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> But isn’t <b>Elijah</b> still <b>alive?</b> Why, then, did Elisha rend his garments for him? <b>He said to him: Since it is written: “And he saw him no more”</b> (II Kings 2:12), Elijah was <b>considered dead from</b> Elisha’s perspective, and so Elisha rent his clothing for him.",
            "§ <b>From where do we</b> derive that one must rend his clothing for the death of the <b><i>Nasi</i> or</b> the <b>president of the court and</b> upon hearing <b>evil tidings?

            "The Gemara explains how the aforementioned <i>halakhot</i> are derived from the verse: <b>“Saul”; this is</b> a reference to the <b><i>Nasi</i>,</b> as Saul was king of Israel. <b>“Jonathan”; this is</b> a reference to the <b>president of the court. “For the people of the Lord, and for the house of the Israel”; these are</b> a reference to <b>evil tidings.</b>",
            "<b>Rav bar Shaba said to Rav Kahana: But</b> perhaps you can <b>say</b> that one need not rend his clothing <b>until all these</b> calamities occur together, and that rending clothing is performed only over a tragedy of this magnitude. <b>He said to him:</b> The repetition of the word “for”: <b>“For</b> Saul,” <b>“for</b> Jonathan,” and “for the people of the Lord” <b>divides the matter</b> and teaches that each individual misfortune is sufficient cause to rend one’s garments.",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> difference <b>does</b> it make that they rent their garments <b>when they heard</b> the curse the first time? <b>Didn’t they hear</b> it again <b>now?</b> The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>This will not enter your mind, as it is written: “And it came to pass, when King Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes”</b> (II Kings 19:1). This indicates that <b>the king rent</b> his garments, <b>but</b> those who reported the blasphemy to him <b>did not rend</b> theirs, as they had already rent their garments the first time.",
            "<b>And from where do we</b> derive that these rents <b>may not be</b> properly <b>mended? This is derived</b> by way of a verbal analogy between the verb <b>rending</b> used here with regard to Hezekiah and the verb <b>rending</b> used in the case of Elijah and Elisha.",
            "§ <b>From where do we</b> derive that one must rend his garments when <b>a Torah scroll has been burned?

            "The Gemara explains: <b>They said to Jehoiakim: Jeremiah has written a book of Lamentations</b> over the future downfall and destruction of Jerusalem. <b>He said to them: What is written in it?</b> They read him the first verse: <b>“How does the city sit solitary”</b> (Lamentations 1:1). <b>He said to them: I am king,</b> and this does not apply to me. <b>They read him</b> the second verse: <b>“She weeps sore in the night”</b> (Lamentations 1:2). He said to them: <b>I am king,</b> and this does not apply to me. They read him the third verse: <b>“Judah is gone into exile due to affliction”</b> (Lamentations 1:3). He said to them: <b>I am king.</b> They read to him: <b>“The ways of Zion do mourn”</b> (Lamentations 1:4). He said to them: <b>I am king.</b> These are the four leaves, or verses, that he read first.",
            "They read him an additional verse: <b>“Her adversaries have become the chief”</b> (Lamentations 1:5), i.e., the reigning king will be removed from power. Once he heard this, <b>he said to them: Who said</b> this? They said to him: This is the continuation of the verse: <b>“For the Lord has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions”</b> (Lamentations 1:5). <b>Immediately, he cut out all the names</b> of God <b>from</b> the book <b>and burned them in fire. This is as it is written: “Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments,</b> neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words” (Jeremiah 36:24). <b>By inference,</b> this shows <b>that</b> they <b>were required to rend</b> their clothing when they saw this.",

            "The Gemara answers: <b>This is not difficult.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>There</b> the woman is permitted to tack the rent <b>due to the woman’s honor,</b> as it would be dishonorable for her to be seen wearing torn garments. However, halakhically the rent is considered as if it still exists, and therefore she must make a new rent for a new bereavement and not merely add to the previous one.",
            "Rabbi Zeira asked further: According to <b>the one who said</b> that <b>all thirty days</b> of mourning <b>one must make</b> a new <b>rent</b> rather than add to the existing tear, <b>why</b> does he say this? It is because during the thirty days <b>one is not given</b> permission to properly <b>mend</b> the garment, and so it still appears to be torn. <b>But</b> then, in a case of a rent made <b>for one’s father or mother,</b> for <b>which</b> he <b>is not given</b> permission to <b>ever</b> properly <b>mend it,</b> would you say that he should <b>so too</b> be forever barred from adding to the rent for a new bereavement and is instead obligated to make a new rent?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>There</b> he may not properly mend the rent <b>due to the honor due to his father and mother.</b> Essentially, however, the tear is considered as if it had been sewn up after the thirty-day period, and therefore the son may extend it in the case of a new bereavement.",
            "<b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who goes out before the deceased in a rent garment</b> that he had previously torn over another bereavement, thereby giving the appearance of having rent his garment for him, <b>steals from the dead,</b> as he did not rend a garment for him. <b>And</b> he similarly steals <b>from the living,</b> who see him and think that he made the tear in honor of the deceased, when in reality he is deceiving them.",

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>At first,</b> the meal after the burial <b>would be brought to the house of the mourner</b> in various ways. <b>The wealthy</b> would bring the meal <b>in baskets of silver and gold, and the poor</b> would bring it in <b>baskets of peeled willow branches.

        [
            "<b>on a plain bier</b> made from poles that were strapped together, <b>and the poor were embarrassed.</b> The Sages <b>instituted that everyone should be taken out</b> for burial <b>on a plain bier, due to the honor of the poor.</b>",
            "Similarly, <b>at first they would place incense under</b> the beds of <b>those who died with an intestinal disease,</b> because the body emitted an especially unpleasant odor. <b>And those who were alive with an intestinal disease were embarrassed</b> when they understood that they, too, would be treated in this manner after their death, and that everyone would know the cause of their death. The Sages <b>instituted that incense should be placed under everyone, due to the honor of those with an intestinal disease who were</b> still <b>living.</b>",
            "Moreover, <b>at first they would</b> ritually <b>immerse</b> all <b>the utensils</b> that had been used <b>by</b> women who <b>died</b> while <b>menstruating,</b> which had thereby contracted ritual impurity. <b>And</b> due to this, <b>the living menstruating women were embarrassed.</b> The Sages <b>instituted that</b> the utensils that had been used <b>by all</b> dying <b>women must be immersed, due to the honor of living menstruating women.</b> And, <b>at first they would</b> ritually <b>immerse</b> all <b>the utensils</b> that had been used by <b><i>zavin</i>,</b> men suffering from gonorrhea, <b>who died,</b> as the utensils had thereby contracted ritual impurity. <b>And</b> due to this <b>the living <i>zavin</i> felt embarrassed.</b> The Sages <b>instituted that</b> the utensils that had been used <b>by all</b> men <b>must be immersed, due to the honor of the living <i>zavin</i>.</b>",
            "Likewise, <b>at first taking the dead out</b> for burial <b>was more difficult for the relatives than the</b> actual <b>death,</b> because it was customary to bury the dead in expensive shrouds, which the poor could not afford.

            "It is taught in the mishna: <b>The bier</b> of the deceased <b>is not set down in the street</b> during the intermediate days of a Festival, so as not to encourage eulogies. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> There are <b>no</b> restrictions on eulogizing on the intermediate days of <b>a Festival in the presence</b> of a deceased <b>Torah scholar,</b> and therefore he may be eulogized in the ordinary manner during the Festival week. <b>And all the more so</b> a Torah scholar may be eulogized on the days of <b>Hanukkah and Purim,</b> which have less sanctity than the intermediate days of a Festival.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>But this</b> allowance to eulogize a Torah scholar during the intermediate days of a Festival <b>applies only</b> when the eulogy is <b>in</b> the <b>presence</b> of the deceased, before the bier. <b>However,</b> giving a eulogy that is <b>not in his presence</b> is <b>not</b> permitted.

            "The Gemara continues its discussion of the <i>halakhot</i> of mourning: <b>Ulla said:</b> Although <i>hesped</i> usually refers to a eulogy, strictly speaking, <b><i>hesped</i></b> is referring to striking oneself <b>on the heart, as it is written: “Striking [<i>sofedim</i>] the breasts”</b> (Isaiah 32:12).

            "<b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who stomps his foot on the ground</b> as a sign of mourning <b>should not stomp with a sandal, but rather</b> he should do so wearing <b>a shoe, due to the danger</b> of being hurt.

            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Once a mourner nods his head</b> to show that his grief has slightly diminished, <b>the consolers may no longer sit next to him,</b> as with his action the mourner shows that he no longer desires their presence.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan further said: All are obligated to stand</b> in the <b>presence of the <i>Nasi</i>, except for a mourner and one who is sick.

            "<b>Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav: A mourner</b> on the <b>first day</b> of his mourning <b>is prohibited from eating of his own bread.</b> From where is this derived? <b>From</b> what <b>the Merciful One says to Ezekiel</b> when the latter is in mourning: <b>“Nor eat the bread of men”</b> (Ezekiel 24:17), which indicates that other mourners must eat bread made by others. It was related that when <b>Rabba and Rav Yosef</b> were in mourning they <b>would exchange their meals with each other.</b>",
            "<b>And Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav:</b> When a person <b>dies in a city, all of the residents of that city are prohibited from performing work</b> until he has been buried.",
            "The Gemara relates that when <b>Rav Hamnuna</b> once <b>happened</b> to come to a place called <b>Darumata he heard the sound of a <i>shofar</i></b> announcing that a person <b>had died</b> in the town.

            "<b>And Rav Yehuda said further in the name of Rav: Anyone who grieves excessively over his dead</b> and does not allow himself to be consoled <b>will</b> in the end <b>weep for another</b> person.

            "The Sages taught in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse that states: <b>“Weep not for the dead, neither bemoan him”</b> (Jeremiah 22:10): <b>“Weep not for the dead”</b> is referring to <b>excessive</b> mourning; <b>“neither bemoan him” more than the</b> appropriate <b>measure</b> of time. <b>How so?</b> What is the appropriate measure? <b>Three days for weeping, and seven for eulogizing, and thirty for</b> the prohibition against <b>ironing</b> clothing <b>and for</b> the prohibition against <b>cutting hair.

            "It is stated in the continuation of the verse: <b>“Weep sore for him that goes away.” Rav Yehuda said:</b> This is referring <b>to one who leaves</b> the world <b>without children</b> to survive him, since mourning for him is much more intense.

            "The Gemara notes that <b>Rav Huna</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning,</b> as <b>Rav Huna said: Once a person commits a transgression and repeats it, it becomes permitted to him.</b> The Gemara questions the wording used here: <b>Does it enter your mind</b> that it is actually <b>permitted?</b> How could it possibly be permitted for him to sin? <b>Rather, say</b> instead: <b>It becomes as though it were permitted,</b> for after doing it twice he no longer relates to his action as the violation of a serious prohibition.",
            "<b>Rabbi Levi said: A mourner</b> during <b>the first three days</b> of his mourning <b>should see himself as though a sword were lying between his two thighs,</b> meaning that he too may be facing imminent death.

            "With regard to that same verse <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> further: <b>Miriam also died by</b> the divine <b>kiss,</b> just like her brother Moses.
