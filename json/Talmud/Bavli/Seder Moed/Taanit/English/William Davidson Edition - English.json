            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>From when,</b> i.e., from which date, <b>does one</b> begin to <b>mention the might of the rains</b> by inserting the phrase: He makes the wind blow and rain fall, in the second blessing of the <i>Amida</i> prayer? <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The phrase is inserted <b>from the first Festival day of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: From the last Festival day of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to</b> Rabbi Eliezer: <b>Since rain is nothing other</b> than <b>a sign of a curse during the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, as rainfall forces Jews to leave their <i>sukkot</i>, <b>why</b> should <b>one mention</b> the might of rain during this period? <b>Rabbi Eliezer said to him: I too did not say</b> that it is proper <b>to request</b> rain at this time, <b>but</b> it is proper only <b>to mention</b> the phrase: <b>He makes the wind blow and rain fall, in its due time.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: If so,</b> i.e., if reciting the phrase does not constitute a request for rain, <b>one should always mention</b> rain, even in the summer.",
            "The mishna states a general principle: <b>One requests rain only</b> immediately <b>preceding the rainy season. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>the one who passes before the ark</b> as prayer leader <b>on the concluding Festival day of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, the Eighth Day of Assembly: <b>The last</b> prayer leader, who leads the additional prayer, <b>mentions</b> rain, whereas <b>the first</b> prayer leader, for the morning prayer, <b>does not mention</b> rain. The opposite is the case at the conclusion of the period for mentioning rain <b>on the first Festival day of Passover:</b> Here, <b>the first</b> prayer leader, who leads the morning prayer, <b>mentions</b> rain, while <b>the last</b> prayer leader, who leads the additional prayer, <b>does not mention</b> rain.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Where does</b> the <b><i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna <b>stand, that</b> he <b>teaches: From when?</b> The mishna’s opening question indicates that it has already been established that there is an obligation to mention rain at this time of the year. Where is this obligation stated? The Gemara answers: The <b><i>tanna</i> is standing there,</b> i.e., he bases himself on a mishna in <i>Berakhot</i>.",
            "<b>As it teaches</b> (<i>Berakhot</i> 33a): <b>One mentions the might of the rains</b> and recites: He makes the wind blow and the rain fall <b>in</b> the second blessing of the <i>Amida</i> prayer, the blessing of <b>the resurrection of the dead. And the request</b> for rain: And grant dew and rain as a blessing, is recited <b>in</b> the ninth blessing of the <i>Amida</i> prayer, <b>the blessing of the years. And</b> the prayer of <b>distinction [<i>havdala</i>]</b> between the sacred and the profane, recited in the evening prayer following Shabbat and Festivals, is recited <b>in</b> the fourth blessing of the <i>Amida</i> prayer: <b>Who graciously grants knowledge. And</b> it is based on that mishna, which establishes the obligation to request for rain, <b>that</b> this mishna <b>teaches: From when does one</b> begin to <b>mention the might of the rains.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>there,</b> in tractate <i>Berakhot</i>, at the beginning of the order of <i>Zera’im</i>. <b>What is different</b> about this case <b>that he left it until here,</b> toward the end of the order of <i>Moed</i>? In other words, if this issue is indeed a continuation of the mishna in <i>Berakhot</i>, why did the <i>tanna</i> neglect it until tractate <i>Ta’anit</i>?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, the <i>tanna</i> interrupted</b> a discussion <b>from</b> tractate <b><i>Rosh HaShana</i>. As we learned</b> in a mishna there: <b>And on the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i> all creatures <b>are judged for water. Since</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught: And on the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i> all creatures <b>are judged for water,</b> from which it can be inferred that one should request rain near the time of this judgment, he <b>taught</b> here: <b>From when does one mention the might of the rains.</b>",
            "§ The Gemara asks a question with regard to the language of the mishna: <b>And let</b> the <i>tanna</i> simply <b>teach: From when does one mention the rains. What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>The might of the rains? Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Because</b> the rains <b>fall with might.</b> The might of the rain displays God’s power in the world, <b>as it is stated: “Who does great things beyond comprehension, marvels without number”</b> (Job 5:9). <b>And it is</b> also <b>written: “Who gives rain upon the earth, and sends water upon the fields”</b> (Job 5:10).",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> may it <b>be inferred</b> that these verses indicate that rainfall is considered a mighty act of God? <b>Rabba bar Sheila said:</b> This is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the term <b>“comprehension”</b> here and the term <b>“comprehension” from</b> a passage that deals with <b>the creation of the world.</b>",
            "Rabba bar Sheila elaborates on this verbal analogy. <b>It is written here: “Who does great things that are beyond comprehension,” and it is written there,</b> with regard to the creation of the world: <b>“Have you not known? Have you not heard that the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, does not grow faint or weary? His discernment is beyond comprehension”</b> (Isaiah 40:28). This shows that both creation and rainfall are beyond comprehension. <b>And</b> concerning the creation of the world, <b>it is written</b> elsewhere: <b>“Who sets firm the mountains with Your strength; Who is girded with might”</b> (Psalms 65:7). From this verse it can be inferred that rainfall, like the creation of the world, reflects God’s might.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive that rain must be mentioned specifically <b>in</b> the <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“To love the Lord your God and to serve Him with all your heart”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:13). <b>Which is the service</b> of God <b>that is</b> performed <b>in the heart? You must say</b> that <b>this</b> is referring to <b>prayer. And, afterward, it is written: “And I shall give the rain of your land in its due time, the first rain and the last rain”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:14). This juxtaposition teaches that it is appropriate to request rain while engaged in the service of the heart, i.e., prayer.",
            "§ The Gemara cites related statements concerning the idea that rainfall provides evidence of God’s might. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> There are <b>three keys</b> maintained <b>in the hand of the Holy One, Blessed be He, which were not transmitted to an intermediary,</b> i.e., God tends to these matters Himself. <b>And they are: The key of rain, the key of birthing, and the key of the resurrection of the dead.</b>",
            "Rabbi Yoḥanan cites verses in support of his claim. <b>The key of rain, as it is stated: “The Lord will open for you His good treasure, the heavens, to give the rain of your land in its due time”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:12), indicates that rainfall is controlled by God Himself. <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>the key of birthing</b> is maintained by God? <b>As it is written: “And God remembered Rachel and listened</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>to her, and He opened her womb”</b> (Genesis 30:22). <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>the key of the resurrection of the dead</b> is maintained by God Himself? <b>As it is written: “And you shall know that I am the Lord when I have opened your graves”</b> (Ezekiel 37:13).",
            "<b>In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they say: The key of livelihood</b> is <b>also</b> in God’s hand, <b>as it is written: “You open Your hand</b> and satisfy every living thing with favor” (Psalms 145:16). The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan did not consider this</b> key of livelihood in his list? The Gemara answers that Rabbi Yoḥanan could have <b>said to you: Rain is</b> the same as <b>livelihood</b> in this regard, as rain is indispensable to all livelihoods.",
            "§ The mishna taught that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> One mentions rain <b>from the first Festival day of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>etc. A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>From where did Rabbi Eliezer derive this</b> <i>halakha</i>? He must have learned it from one of the two mitzvot of <i>Sukkot</i> that are linked to rain. Did he <b>derive it from</b> the mitzva to wave the <b><i>lulav</i>, or</b> did he <b>derive it from</b> the obligation of <b>the water libation?</b>",
            "The Gemara clarifies the significance of this dilemma: Did he <b>derive this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the <b><i>lulav</i>,</b> in which case one would say: <b>Just as</b> the mitzva to take the <b><i>lulav</i></b> applies <b>during the day</b> and not at night, <b>so too,</b> the <b>mention</b> of rain begins <b>during the day</b> of the first Festival day of <i>Sukkot</i>. <b>Or perhaps</b> he <b>derives this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>from the water libation,</b> in which case one would say: <b>Just as the water libation</b> can be prepared <b>from the</b> first <b>night</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>as the Master said,</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“And their meal-offerings and their libations”</b> (Numbers 29:18), and certain meal-offerings and libations may be brought <b>even at night, so too,</b> the <b>mention</b> of rain begins <b>from the evening.</b>",
            "The Gemara seeks to resolve this dilemma: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution, <b>as Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer derived this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>from nothing other</b> than the case of <b><i>lulav</i>. Some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Abbahu learned this</b> claim <b>by</b> way of a <b>tradition,</b> which was the source of Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion; <b>and some say</b> that <b>he learned it from a <i>baraita</i>.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>baraita</i> from which Rabbi Abbahu may have derived his statement? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From when does one</b> begin to <b>mention the rains</b> in his prayers? <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: From the time that one takes</b> the <b><i>lulav</i>,</b> i.e., the first day of <i>Sukkot</i>. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: From the time that one puts</b> the <i>lulav</i> <b>down,</b> i.e., at the conclusion of <i>Sukkot</i>.",
            "§ The <i>baraita</i> cites a discussion of these opinions. <b>Rabbi Eliezer said:</b> It is <b>since these four species,</b> the <i>lulav</i> and the other species taken with it, <b>come only to offer appeasement for water,</b> as they symbolize the rainfall of the coming year. <b>And</b> this symbolism is as follows: <b>Just as these four species cannot</b> exist <b>without water,</b> as they need water to grow, <b>so too, the world cannot</b> exist <b>without water.</b> Therefore, it is proper to mention rain in one’s prayers when taking the four species.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to him</b> in response: <b>But rain during the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>is nothing other</b> than <b>a sign of a curse. Rabbi Eliezer said to</b> Rabbi Yehoshua: <b>I too did not say</b> that it is proper <b>to ask</b> for rain at this time, <b>but</b> only <b>to mention</b> it. And <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>the resurrection of the dead, one mentions</b> it <b>the entire year and</b> yet <b>it</b> will <b>come only at its</b> proper <b>time,</b> when God wills the resurrection, <b>so too, one mentions the might of the rains all the year, and they</b> fall <b>only in their season. Therefore, if one seeks to mention</b> rain <b>throughout the year, he</b> may <b>mention it. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: I say</b> that <b>when one ceases to request</b> rain, <b>one also ceases to mention</b> it.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says: On the second day of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>one mentions</b> rain, rather than on the first day. <b>Rabbi Akiva says: On the sixth day one mentions</b> rain. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua:</b> With regard to <b>the one who passes before the ark</b> as prayer leader <b>on the concluding Festival day of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, the Eighth Day of Assembly, <b>the last</b> prayer leader of the additional prayer <b>mentions</b> rain, whereas <b>the first</b> prayer leader for the morning prayer <b>does not</b> mention rain. Conversely, <b>on the first Festival day of Passover, the first</b> prayer leader <b>mentions</b> rain, while <b>the last</b> prayer leader <b>does not mention</b> rain.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Rabbi Eliezer is speaking well to Rabbi Yehoshua.</b> How does Rabbi Yehoshua respond to Rabbi Eliezer’s powerful argument that one can mention God’s praises at any time of the year? The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua</b> could have <b>said to you: Granted,</b> with regard to <b>the resurrection of the dead, one mentions</b> this daily, <b>as</b> although it is not fulfilled every day, <b>any day is</b> fit to be <b>its proper time.</b>",
            "<b>However,</b> in the case of <b>rain,</b> are <b>all</b> times <b>when it falls its proper time? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (12b): <b>If</b> the month of <b>Nisan has ended and rains</b> subsequently <b>fall, they are a sign of a curse, as it is stated: “Is not the wheat harvest today?</b> I will call to the Lord that He may send thunder and rain, and you will know and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight of the Lord, in asking you a king” (I Samuel 12:17).",
            "§ The <i>baraita</i> states that <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says: On the second day of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>one</b> begins to <b>mention</b> rain. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason for</b> this ruling of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught,</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that deals with the source for the water libation on <i>Sukkot</i>, that <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says:</b> The Torah alludes to the water libation in its description of the libations of the additional offerings of <i>Sukkot</i>. The Torah uses a slightly different term for the libations of certain days. On most days, it states that the sin-offering must be brought with “its libation [<i>veniskah</i>]” (e.g., Numbers 29:16), in the singular form.",
            "By contrast, <b>it is stated on the second day</b> that one must offer <b>“their libations [<i>veniskeihem</i>]”</b> (Numbers 29:19). The plural form indicates the presence of multiple offerings. <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>it is stated</b> concerning the sin-offering libations <b>on the sixth day: “And its libations [<i>unsakheha</i>]”</b> (Numbers 29:31), which is again a plural form that is referring to many libations. <b>And</b> finally, <b>it is stated,</b> with regard to the libations of the additional offering <b>on the seventh day,</b> that they must apportion the respective animals, i.e., oxen, rams, and sheep: <b>“According to their laws [<i>kemishpatam</i>]”</b> (Numbers 29:33), using another plural form which differs from the phrase used on the other Festival days: “According to the law [<i>kamishpat</i>]” (e.g., Numbers 29:19), in the singular.",
            "<b>These</b> variations yield the three superfluous letters <b><i>mem</i>, <i>yod</i>,</b> and <b><i>mem</i>,</b> from <i>veniskeiheM</i>, <i>unsakhEha</i>, and <i>kemishpataM</i>, <b>which</b> together spell the Hebrew word for <b>water [<i>MaYiM</i>].</b> The letter <i>yod</i> is represented in <i>unsakhEha</i> with the letter E and in <i>MaYiM</i> with the letter Y. <b>From here</b> one learns <b>an allusion to the</b> mitzva of <b>the water libation in the Torah.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And what is different about the second</b> day <b>that</b> Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira <b>took</b> it as the day on which one begins to mention rain? The Gemara answers: The reason is <b>that when the verse</b> first <b>alludes</b> to the water libation, <b>it is on the second</b> day of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>that it alludes</b> to it (Numbers 29:19). <b>Therefore, on the second</b> day one begins to <b>mention</b> rain.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> stated that <b>Rabbi Akiva says: On the sixth day one</b> begins to <b>mention</b> rain. The Gemara explains that this ruling is based on the allusion to the water libation in the offering of this day. <b>As it is stated on the sixth day: “And its libations [<i>unsakheha</i>]”</b> (Numbers 29:31). The allusion is written in the plural, which indicates that <b>the verse is speaking of two libations: One</b> is <b>the water libation and</b> the other <b>one</b> is <b>the</b> standard <b>wine libation.</b>",
            "The Gemara raises an objection: Even if it is accepted that the verse is referring to two libations, one can <b>say</b> that <b>both</b> libations are <b>of wine.</b> The Gemara answers: Rabbi Akiva <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira, who said</b> that the superfluous letters of these verses <b>allude</b> to <b>water [<i>mayim</i>].</b> This proves that the additional libation of the sixth day must be a water libation."
        ],
        [
            "The Gemara objects: <b>If</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira</b> with regard to this derivation, <b>let</b> him <b>say</b> that it <b>is in accordance with his</b> ruling that one begins mentioning rain from the second day of <i>Sukkot</i>, not the sixth day. The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that <b>when</b> that <b>extra</b> reference to <b>libation is written</b> in the verse, it is with regard <b>to the sixth day that it is written.</b> In other words, it is the plural phrase: “Its libations [<i>unsakheha</i>]” (Numbers 29:31), which appears on the sixth day, that directly indicates that one must perform more than one libation, while the other two superfluous letters merely serve to teach that this second libation must be of water, not wine. Therefore, the additional libation is performed on the sixth day.",
            "§ <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Natan says: “In the Sanctuary you shall pour out a libation [<i>hassekh nesekh</i>] of strong drink to the Lord”</b> (Numbers 28:7). The Torah states the term for libation twice, which indicates that <b>the verse is speaking of two libations: One</b> is <b>the water libation and</b> the other <b>one</b> is <b>the wine libation.</b> The Gemara asks: Why not <b>say</b> that <b>both</b> libations are <b>of wine?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>If so, let the verse write either <i>hassekh hessekh</i> or <i>nassekh nesekh</i>,</b> with the same prefix each time. <b>What is</b> the meaning of the varied formulation: <b>“<i>Hassekh nesekh</i>”? Learn from this</b> that <b>one</b> libation is <b>of water and</b> the other <b>one</b> is <b>of wine.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>However,</b> what about <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Sukka</i> 42b): <b>The water libation is</b> performed <b>all seven days</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>. <b>Who is</b> the author of this mishna? <b>If</b> you say it is <b>Rabbi Yehoshua, let us say</b> that this ritual is performed only <b>one day,</b> the Eighth Day of Assembly. <b>If</b> it is <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> the mishna should state <b>two days,</b> the sixth and the seventh Festival days. <b>If</b> it is <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira,</b> the mishna should say that the water libation is performed on <b>six days,</b> from the second day of <i>Sukkot</i> onward.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the ruling of the mishna <b>is</b> that of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira, and he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> as stated <b>in a mishna. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Sukka</i> 47a) that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He would pour with</b> a utensil that held <b>a <i>log</i></b> of water <b>all eight days</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, which includes the Eighth Day of Assembly. <b>And</b> Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira <b>removes the first day</b> from this obligation and <b>includes the eighth,</b> which results in seven days of water libations.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And what is different</b> about <b>the first</b> day, <b>that</b> the water libation <b>is not</b> performed on that day, according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira? Is the reason <b>that when</b> the Torah <b>alludes</b> to <b>water, it is on the second day that it alludes</b> to this libation? If so, one should not bring the libation on the <b>eighth</b> day <b>either,</b> because <b>when</b> the Torah <b>alludes</b> to <b>water</b> for the last time, <b>it is on the seventh day that it alludes</b> to it.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara retracts from the previous explanation in favor of the claim that this mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua. And</b> Rabbi Yehoshua maintains that this ruling that <b>the water libation is</b> performed <b>all seven days</b> of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>is a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai, <b>learned through tradition.</b> In other words, this obligation is not based upon a textual source.",
            "<b>As Rabbi Ami said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Neḥunya of the valley of Beit Ḥortan:</b> The <i>halakha</i> of <b>ten saplings,</b> that if there are ten saplings that require water planted in an area of a <i>beit se’a</i>, 2,500 square cubits, it is permitted to plow the entire field in the summer preceding the Sabbatical Year despite the fact that it is prohibited to plow other fields starting from the preceding <i>Shavuot</i>; the practice of walking around the altar with <b>a willow</b> and adorning the altar with it on <i>Sukkot</i> and taking it on the last day of <i>Sukkot</i>; and the obligation of <b>the water libation;</b> each of these three is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai.</b>",
            "It is stated in the same <i>baraita</i> cited previously that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua:</b> With regard to <b>the one who passes before the ark</b> as prayer leader <b>on the concluding Festival day of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, the Eighth Day of Assembly, <b>the last</b> prayer leader of the additional prayer <b>mentions</b> rain, whereas <b>the first</b> prayer leader for the morning prayer <b>does not mention</b> rain.

This indicates that one starts to <b>mention</b> rain from the beginning of the day, i.e., the evening prayer service.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> you will say that Rabbi Yehuda is referring to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> cited <b>in the <i>baraita</i>.</b> However, this too is untenable, as <b>didn’t</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>say</b> there that one begins to mention rain <b>from the time one puts down</b> the <i>lulav</i>, i.e., from the end of the seventh day of <i>Sukkot</i>? This statement also indicates that one begins to mention rain from the evening service of the Eighth Day of Assembly.",
            "The Gemara asks another question: <b>And, furthermore, that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of ben Beteira:</b> With regard to <b>the one who passes before the ark on the concluding Festival day of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, the Eighth Day of Assembly, <b>the last</b> prayer leader <b>mentions</b> rain.

            "<b>Rav Naḥman Bar Yitzḥak said: Let</b> the ben Beteira mentioned by Rabbi Yehuda in the <i>baraita</i> <b>be</b> understood as a reference <b>to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Beteira,</b> and this will resolve all the above difficulties. <b>At times,</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>calls him by his name,</b> Rabbi Yehoshua, despite the fact that the name Rabbi Yehoshua generally refers to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya. <b>At</b> other <b>times,</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>calls him by his father’s name,</b> e.g., in the second <i>baraita</i>, when the ruling is attributed to ben Beteira. <b>And</b> the Gemara explains the reason for the different names: <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i>, where he is called by his father’s name, was written <b>before he was ordained, and this</b> <i>baraita</i>, where he is called simply Rabbi Yehoshua, was from <b>after he was ordained.</b>",
            "§ It is <b>taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: With regard <b>to dew and</b> with regard <b>to wind, the Sages did not obligate one to mention</b> them by reciting: He makes the wind blow and the dew fall, in the second blessing of the <i>Amida</i>, <b>but if one seeks to mention</b> them, <b>he</b> may <b>mention</b> them.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>winds, from where do we</b> derive that <b>it is not withheld</b> but perpetually blows? <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said that the verse states: “For I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, says the Lord”</b> (Zechariah 2:10).

            "<b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Therefore,</b> since wind and dew are always present, if <b>during the summer one recited: He makes the wind blow, we do not require him to return</b> and repeat the blessing since the wind blows during the summer as well.

            "It was <b>taught</b> in a similar <i>baraita</i>: With regard <b>to clouds and</b> with regard <b>to wind, the Sages did not obligate one to mention</b> them, but <b>if one wishes to mention</b> them, <b>he may mention</b> them.

            "<b>Rabbi Abba said to Rav Ashi: You learned</b> the proof for this idea <b>from</b> that verse <b>there; we learned it from here, as it is written: “A land whose stones [<i>avaneha</i>] are iron”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:9). <b>Do not read</b> this phrase as <b>“whose stones [<i>avaneha</i>],” rather,</b> read it as <b>whose builders [<i>boneha</i>],</b> since Torah scholars build the land spiritually and are as tough as iron.

            "As a preamble to the statement of Rabbi Berekhya, below, the Gemara cites that which <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: Three</b> people <b>entreated</b> God in an <b>unreasonable</b> manner, i.e., in situations where their requests might have received an unfavorable answer. <b>To two</b> of them God <b>responded reasonably,</b> with a favorable response to their requests, <b>and to one</b> God <b>responded unreasonably,</b> i.e., unfavorably, in a manner befitting the unreasonable request. <b>And they are: Eliezer, servant of Abraham; Saul, son of Kish; and Jephthah the Gileadite.</b>",
            "The Gemara clarifies each of these cases in turn: With regard to <b>Eliezer, servant of Abraham,</b> he made a request when he prayed beside the well, <b>as it is written: “That the maiden to whom I shall say: Please let down your pitcher</b> that I may drink; and she shall say: Drink, and I will also give your camels to drink; that she be the one whom you have appointed for your servant Isaac” (Genesis 24:14). Eliezer entreated God unreasonably, as his request allowed for the possibility that she <b>might even</b> be <b>lame</b> or <b>even blind,</b> and yet he had promised to take her to Isaac. Nevertheless, God <b>responded</b> to him <b>reasonably and</b> the eminently suitable <b>Rebecca happened</b> to come <b>to him.</b>",
            "With regard to <b>Saul, son of Kish,</b> he made an offer when Goliath the Philistine challenged the Jews, <b>as it is written: “And it shall be that the man who kills him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter”</b> (I Samuel 17:25). The man who killed Goliath <b>might even</b> have been <b>a slave or a <i>mamzer</i>,</b> one born from an incestuous or adulterous union, who would be unfit to marry his daughter. Nevertheless, God <b>responded</b> to him <b>reasonably and David happened</b> to come <b>to him.</b>",
            "By contrast, there is the case of <b>Jephthah the Gileadite.</b> Upon leaving for battle he issued a statement, <b>as it is written: “Then it shall be that whatever comes forth from the doors of my house</b> to meet me when I return in peace…it shall be to the Lord and I will bring it up for a burnt-offering” (Judges 11:31). This <b>might even</b> have been <b>an impure,</b> non-kosher <b>animal,</b> which he had committed himself to sacrifice. In this instance, God <b>responded</b> to him <b>unreasonably, and his daughter happened</b> to come <b>to him.</b>",
            "Regarding the incident of Jephthah, the Gemara remarks: <b>And this is what the prophet said to the Jewish people: “Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there?</b> Why then has the health of the daughter of my people not recovered?” (Jeremiah 8:22). This verse alludes to the fact that had he sought a means to do so, Jephthah could have had his vow annulled.",

            "The Gemara interprets each phrase of this verse: <b>“Which I did not command,” this</b> is referring to <b>the son of Mesha, king of Moab.</b> King Mesha sacrificed his son, <b>as it is stated: “Then he took his firstborn son, who would reign after him, and he offered him as a burnt-offering”</b> (II Kings 3:27). <b>“And I did not speak,” this</b> is referring to <b>Jephthah,</b> who sacrificed his daughter as an offering. <b>“Nor did it come into my heart,” this</b> is referring to <b>Isaac, son of Abraham.</b> Although God commanded Abraham to sacrifice Isaac, there was no intent in God’s heart that he should actually do so; it was merely a test.",

In other words, even according to the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, one begins to request rain just before the rainy season, on the Eighth Day of Assembly, whereas one starts to mention rain already on the first day of <i>Sukkot</i>.",

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Naḥman said to Rabbi Yitzḥak:</b> Is the <b>first rain in Nisan?</b> The <b>first rain is in Marḥeshvan, as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The first rain</b> is <b>in Marḥeshvan and the last rain</b> is <b>in Nisan.</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said as follows: This verse was fulfilled in the days of</b> the prophet <b>Joel, son of Pethuel,</b> in a year <b>concerning</b> which <b>it is written: “That which the palmer-worm has left, the locust has eaten</b> and that which the locust has left, the canker-worm has eaten; and that which the canker-worm has left, the caterpillar has eaten” (Joel 1:4), when no crops remained. In <b>that year,</b> the month of <b>Adar ended and</b> still <b>no rain had fallen.</b> The rain of the <b>first rainy season fell for them on the first of Nisan.</b>",
            "After the first rain fell, <b>the prophet said to the Jews: Go out and sow. They said to him: One who has</b> one <b><i>kav</i> of wheat or two <i>kav</i> of barley</b> left, <b>should he eat them and live</b> off them for a while <b>or sow them and die?</b> Given the improbability of the crops’ growth under these circumstances, it appears wasteful to plant them rather than consume that which remains. The prophet <b>said to them: Nevertheless, go out and sow. A miracle occurred for them and they discovered</b> wheat and barley seeds <b>that</b> were hidden <b>in the walls and that</b> were concealed <b>in ant holes.</b>",
            "<b>They went out and sowed on the second, third, and fourth</b> days of Nisan, <b>and</b> the rain of the <b>second rainy season fell for them on the fifth of Nisan.</b> The crops grew so quickly that <b>they</b> were able to <b>sacrifice</b> the <b><i>omer</i></b> offering in its proper time, <b>on the sixteenth of Nisan. Consequently, grain that</b> normally <b>grows in six months grew in eleven days, and consequently,</b> the <b><i>omer</i> that is</b> generally <b>sacrificed from grain</b> that grows <b>in six months was sacrificed</b> that year <b>from grain</b> that grew <b>in eleven days.</b>",

The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the expression: <b>“Though he goes on his way weeping, who bears</b> the measure of seed”? <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: An ox, when it plowed</b> at that time, <b>it went</b> on its way <b>weeping</b> and lamenting its labor; <b>and</b> yet <b>upon its return,</b> through the same furrow, <b>it</b> was able to <b>eat the young shoots [<i>ḥaziz</i>]</b> of crops that had already sprouted <b>from the furrow.

            "§ Incidental to the interpretation of these verses, the Gemara cites a series of verses, starting with the topic of hunger, that also involve questions that Rav Naḥman posed to Rabbi Yitzḥak. <b>Rav Naḥman said to Rabbi Yitzḥak: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “For the Lord has called upon a famine and it shall also come upon the land seven years”</b> (II Kings 8:1)?

Rabbi Yitzḥak <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One may not speak during a meal, lest the trachea will precede the esophagus.</b> Food is meant to enter the esophagus, and when one speaks his trachea opens and the food might enter there. <b>And</b> therefore, one should not speak during a meal, as he might <b>come into</b> the <b>danger</b> of choking.",
            "<b>After they had eaten,</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said as follows: Our patriarch Jacob did not die.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>asked him</b> in surprise: <b>And was it for naught that the eulogizers eulogized</b> him <b>and the embalmers embalmed</b> him <b>and the buriers buried</b> him?

            "§ The Gemara returns to the topic of rain. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>first rain [<i>yoreh</i>]</b> is called by this name due to the fact <b>that it instructs [<i>moreh</i>] people to plaster their roofs and to bring in their produce</b> from the fields to their houses <b>and to attend to all their needs</b> in the field before more rain falls. <b>Alternatively,</b> <i>yoreh</i> is referring to the fact <b>that it moistens [<i>marve</i>] the earth and waters it to</b> the <b>depths, as it is stated: “Watering [<i>ravvei</i>] its ridges abundantly, settling down its furrows, You make it soft with showers, You bless its growth”</b> (Psalms 65:11). <b>Alternatively,</b> <i>yoreh</i> means <b>that it falls gently and it does not fall vehemently.</b>",
            "<b>Or</b> perhaps <b>that is not</b> the case; rather, <b><i>yoreh</i></b> means <b>that</b> the rain <b>causes the fruit to drop</b> from the trees, <b>washes the seeds</b> away, <b>and washes the trees</b> away in a destructive manner. According to this interpretation, <i>yoreh</i> is related to <i>yeriya</i>, shooting. Therefore <b>the verse states: “Last rain [<i>malkosh</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:14); <b>just as <i>malkosh</i></b> refers specifically to rains that are <b>for a blessing, so too, <i>yoreh</i></b> is referring to rains that are <b>for a blessing. Or</b> perhaps <b>that is not</b> the case; rather, <b><i>malkosh</i></b> means <b>that</b> the rain falls so hard [<i>kashe</i>] and vehemently that <b>it knocks down the houses, shatters the trees and brings up the locusts?</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “<i>Yoreh</i>,”</b> from which it may be inferred that <b>just as <i>yoreh</i> is for a blessing, so too, <i>malkosh</i></b> is <b>for a blessing.</b>",
            "<b>And</b> with regard to <b><i>yoreh</i> itself, from where do we</b> derive that it is referring to rain that falls for a blessing? <b>As it is written: “You children of Zion, be glad and rejoice in the Lord your God, for He has given you the first rain [<i>moreh</i>] in His kindness, and He caused to come down for you the rain,</b> the <b>first rain [<i>moreh</i>] and</b> the <b>last rain [<i>malkosh</i>], in the first</b> month” (Joel 2:23). This verse clearly states that <i>yoreh</i>, also referred to as <i>moreh</i>, fall due to God’s kindness, for a blessing.",
            "The Gemara cites another <i>baraita</i> on the same topic. <b>The Sages taught:</b> The <b>first rain</b> falls <b>in Marḥeshvan and</b> the <b>last rain in Nisan.</b> Do <b>you say</b> that the <b>first rain is in Marḥeshvan and</b> the <b>last rain in Nisan, or</b> perhaps <b>it is only</b> that the <b>first rain</b> falls <b>in Tishrei and</b> the <b>last rain in Iyyar?</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “I shall give the rain of your land <b>in its due time”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:14). Its due time is in Marḥeshvan, when rain is needed for the crops to sprout, and in Nisan, to complete the growth of the crops.",
            "The Gemara clarifies the meaning of the word for the <b>last rain [<i>malkosh</i>]. Rav Nehilai bar Idi said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> It is <b>a matter that circumcises [<i>mal</i>] the stubbornness [<i>kashyuteihen</i>] of the Jewish people,</b> i.e., it penetrates to the hearts of the Jewish people, as when rain does not fall in its time, they turn to God in repentance. <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> The last rain is called <i>malkosh</i> because it is <b>a matter that fills out [<i>memalle</i>] produce in its stalks [<i>bekasheha</i>].</b> Although the stalks already exist from earlier in the year, it is this rain that causes the grain within to swell and fill them. <b>It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>:</b> <i>Malkosh</i> is <b>a matter that comes down on the ears [<i>melilot</i>] and on the stalks [<i>kashin</i>].</b>",
            "<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>first rain</b> falls <b>in Marḥeshvan and</b> the <b>last rain in Nisan.</b> Do <b>you say</b> that <b>the first rain is in Marḥeshvan, or</b> perhaps <b>it is only in</b> the month of <b>Kislev?

Likewise, Marḥeshvan is the best time for the first rains to fall.",
            "<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: The <b>first rain</b> is <b>in Marḥeshvan and</b> the <b>last rain</b> is <b>in Nisan.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say:</b> The time of the <b>first rain</b> is <b>in Kislev.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Who are the Rabbis</b> cited here? <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> It is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>When is the first rainfall?</b> Each opinion cited in the <i>baraita</i> provides a range of dates for when this rainfall is expected. <b>The earliest</b> date on which the first rainfall might occur is <b>on the third of Marḥeshvan,</b> the <b>intermediate</b> time is <b>on the seventh of</b> the month, <b>and the latest</b> is <b>on the seventeenth of</b> the month.

Likewise, the time of the <b>third</b> rainfall is important, so that one knows when to begin <b>to fast</b> if no rain has fallen by then. However, <b>for what</b> reason is the <b>second</b> rainfall mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>? <b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> The second rainfall is significant <b>for</b> the issue of <b>vows, as we learned</b> in a mishna:"

        [
            "In the case of <b>one who vows</b> to prohibit from himself a type of benefit <b>until the rains,</b> the vow is in effect <b>from when the rains</b> begin to <b>fall until the second rainfall,</b> as this is considered the time of the rains.",

            "Incidentally, the Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the term for searchers, <b><i>namoshot</i>?

            "<b>Rav Pappa said</b> that the time of the second rainfall is significant <b>so that</b> one can know until when it is permitted <b>to walk on the permitted paths</b> in fields. One may utilize certain paths on private property, provided no damage is caused to the field. <b>As the Master said: Anyone</b> may <b>walk on the permitted paths until the second rainfall falls.</b> One who walks on them at a later point in time is likely to trample the plowed field and damage its crops.",
            "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that the time of the second rainfall is significant for determining when <b>to remove the produce of the Sabbatical Year</b> from one’s possession. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Until when may one derive benefit and burn</b> the <b>straw and</b> the <b>hay of the Sabbatical Year? Until the second rainfall falls.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that one must remove the produce of the Sabbatical Year from one’s possession? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written</b> with regard to the Sabbatical Year: <b>“And for your cattle and for the beasts in your land</b> all its increase shall be for food” (Leviticus 25:7). This verse indicates that <b>as long as a beast,</b> i.e., a non-domesticated animal, is able to find and <b>eat</b> produce <b>in the field, you</b> may <b>feed your cattle,</b> your domesticated animals, from that type of food <b>in the house.</b> However, when a given type of produce <b>has ceased</b> to be available <b>to the beast in the field, cease</b> providing it to <b>your cattle in the house.</b> After the time of the second rainfall there is no longer any straw or hay in the fields.",
            "§ The Gemara returns to the subject of rain. <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: What is</b> the meaning of the <b>term</b> for rainfall, <b><i>revia</i>?</b> It is referring to <b>a matter that penetrates [<i>rove’a</i>],</b> i.e., which causes <b>the earth</b> to bear fruit.

            "<b>And if he whispered</b> his prayers <b>and</b> yet <b>was not answered, what is his remedy?</b> He should <b>go to</b> the most <b>pious individual of the generation, and</b> this pious individual will <b>increase</b> his <b>prayers on his behalf, as it is stated</b> one verse earlier: <b>“And He has commanded it due to imploring”</b> (Job 36:32). <b>And “imploring”</b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>prayer, as it is stated: “Therefore, do not pray you for this nation, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither implore Me”</b> (Jeremiah 7:16).",

            "The Gemara responds: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>here</b> Rabbi Ami is referring <b>to an individual</b> who prays without sincerity and consequently his prayer goes unheard, whereas <b>there</b> Shmuel is saying that when one prays <b>with</b> the <b>community,</b> even if his prayers are deficient, they are accepted in the merit of the congregation.",
            "<b>Rabbi Ami</b> further <b>said: Rain falls only due to faithful people, as it is stated: “Truth springs out of the earth, and righteousness has looked down from heaven”</b> (Psalms 85:12).

            "Likewise, an expression of <b>giving birth is stated with regard to a woman, and</b> an expression of <b>giving birth is</b> also <b>stated with regard to rain.</b> Specifically, <b>giving birth is stated with regard to a woman, as it is written</b> in the case of Rachel, when God had mercy on her: <b>“And she conceived and gave birth to a son”</b> (Genesis 30:23). <b>And giving birth is stated with regard to rain, as it is written:</b> “For as the rain comes down, and the snow from heaven, and does not return there, except it waters the earth <b>and causes it to give birth and bud”</b> (Isaiah 55:10).",

            "The <i>baraita</i> comments: Up <b>to this point</b> is the <b>attribute of middling people,</b> who merely exclude themselves from the suffering of the community. <b>However,</b> with regard <b>to</b> the <b>attribute of wicked people, what is written</b> about those who hope for more of these days? <b>“Come, I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and tomorrow shall be as this day,</b> and much more abundant” (Isaiah 56:12). <b>And what is written afterward? “The righteous perishes, and no man lays it to heart,</b> and godly men are taken away, none considering <b>that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come”</b> (Isaiah 57:1). This verse teaches that righteous people suffer early death to prevent them from witnessing the harm that will befall these evil people.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rather, a person should be distressed together with the community.

The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>And anyone who is distressed together with the community will merit seeing the consolation of the community.</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> further states: <b>And lest a person say,</b> I have acted in secret; <b>who will testify against me</b> on the Day of Judgment? The <i>tanna</i> explains that the <b>stones of a person’s house and</b> the <b>beams of a person’s house</b> will <b>testify against him, as it is stated: “For a stone shall cry out from the wall, and a beam out of the timber shall answer it”</b> (Habakkuk 2:11). In <b>the school of Rabbi Sheila they say:</b> The <b>two ministering angels who accompany a person</b> will <b>testify against him, as it is stated: “For He will give His angels charge over you,</b> to keep you in all your ways” (Psalms 91:11).",

            "The <i>baraita</i> cites another verse that deals with judgment. <b>“A God of faithfulness and without iniquity,</b> He is just and righteous” (Deuteronomy 32:4). The <i>baraita</i> interprets <b>“a God of faithfulness”</b> to mean that <b>just as punishment is exacted from the wicked in the World-to-Come even for a light transgression that they commit, so too, punishment is exacted from the righteous in this world for a light transgression that they commit.</b> The righteous suffer their punishment in this world to purify them so they can enjoy the World-to-Come.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> turns to the second section of the verse: <b>“And without iniquity.”</b> This teaches that <b>just as reward is paid to the righteous in the World-to-Come even for a minor mitzva that they fulfill, so too, reward is paid to the wicked in this world for even a minor mitzva that they fulfill,</b> to give the wicked all the reward they deserve for the performance of mitzvot in this world, and deprive them of any share in the World-to-Come.",
            "With regard to the third section of the verse: <b>“He is just and righteous,”</b> the Sages <b>said: At the hour of a person’s departure to his eternal home, all his deeds are enumerated before him</b> and are rendered visible to him once again, <b>and</b> the deeds themselves <b>say to him: You did such and such, in such and such a place, on such and such a day, and he says: Yes,</b> that is exactly what happened. <b>And they say to him: Sign</b> a statement that this is correct, <b>and he signs</b> it, <b>as it is stated: “He makes the hand of every man sign”</b> (Job 37:7). <b>And not only that,</b> but after one has been shown all his deeds, <b>he justifies the judgment upon himself, and says to them: You have judged me well.</b> This response serves <b>to fulfill that which is stated: “That You may be justified when You speak and be right when You judge”</b> (Psalms 51:6).",
            "§ The Gemara returns to the primary topic of the tractate, the issue of fasts. <b>Shmuel said: Whoever sits in</b> observance of <b>a fast is called a sinner,</b> as it is inappropriate to take unnecessary suffering upon oneself. The Gemara comments: Shmuel <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the following <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Elazar HaKappar the Great says: What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states,</b> with regard to a nazirite: <b>“And he will atone for him for that he sinned by the soul [<i>nefesh</i>]”</b> (Numbers 6:11). <b>But with what soul did this</b> nazirite <b>sin?

            "<b>And are</b> these <b>matters not</b> inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i>? And if this</b> nazirite, <b>who distressed himself</b> by abstaining <b>only from wine, is</b> nevertheless <b>called a sinner</b> and requires atonement, then with regard to <b>one who distresses himself</b> by abstaining <b>from each and every matter</b> of food and drink when he fasts, <b>all the more so</b> should he be considered a sinner.",
            "Conversely, <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> One who accepts a fast upon himself is <b>called sacred, as it is stated</b> with regard to the nazirite: <b>“He shall be sacred, he shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long”</b> (Numbers 6:5). Here too, one can apply an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>And if this</b> nazirite, <b>who distressed himself</b> by abstaining <b>from only one matter,</b> wine, is nevertheless <b>called sacred,</b> then with regard to <b>one who distresses himself</b> by abstaining from <b>every matter, all the more so</b> should he be considered sacred.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel,</b> the nazirite <b>is</b> indeed <b>called sacred,</b> as stated by Rabbi Elazar. The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>is referring to</b> the sanctity of the <b>growth of the locks,</b> as the nazirite’s hair does possess an element of sanctity, but it does not refer to the nazirite himself. The Gemara reverses the question: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> the nazirite <b>is called a sinner.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>refers</b> specifically <b>to</b> a nazirite <b>who rendered himself ritually impure</b> by coming into contact with a dead body, an act that is prohibited for him. This particular nazirite must bring an offering to atone “for that he sinned by the soul.”",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabbi Elazar</b> actually <b>say this,</b> that fasting is a virtuous act? <b>But didn’t Rabbi Elazar say: A person should always consider himself</b>"

This statement indicates that it is prohibited to take a fast upon oneself. The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> first ruling, that one who fasts is sacred, is referring to a case <b>where he is able to distress himself</b> without causing bodily harm. <b>That</b> second ruling, that one may not overly burden his body, deals with a situation <b>when he is unable to distress himself</b> while avoiding all harm, and he proceeds to fast nevertheless.",

Similarly, <b>Rav Sheshet said: This student of a Torah academy who sits in</b> observance of <b>a fast</b> has <b>let a dog eat his portion.</b> Since his fast weakens him and prevents him from studying Torah, it is considered as though a dog ate his meal, as the student derived no benefit from it.",

            "The Gemara cites another proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, said: I am a descendant of Senaah, son of</b> the tribe of <b>Benjamin, and once the Ninth of Av occurred on Shabbat, and we postponed</b> the fast <b>until after Shabbat,</b> as Shabbat supersedes the fast of the Ninth of Av. <b>And we fasted on that</b> day, <b>but we did not complete</b> the fast, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the tenth of Av <b>is a holiday of ours,</b> a private holiday for our family (26a), and one does not fast on holidays. This proves that a fast of only a few hours is nevertheless called a fast. The Gemara rejects this claim: <b>There too,</b> they did so <b>merely to cause themselves distress.</b>",
            "The Gemara again attempts to disprove the opinion of Rav Ḥisda, this time by citing a custom of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> occasionally <b>said: I shall be in</b> observance of <b>a fast until I come to my house.</b> This indicates that one can take a fast upon himself even for just a few hours.

            "<b>Shmuel said: Any fast that one did not take upon himself while it was still day</b> is <b>not called a fast.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And if</b> one happened to <b>sit</b> in observance of a fast that day, <b>what</b> is that considered? <b>Rabba bar Sheila said:</b> He is <b>likened to a bellows that is full of air.</b> His behavior does not constitute a fast, as he is merely a container full of air, without food.",

The Gemara answers that the practical difference <b>between them</b> is in a case where one placed <b>ordinary earth</b> upon the heads of the individuals instead of ashes. Although earth does symbolize self-nullification and may be used according to the first explanation, it has no connection to the sacrifice of Isaac, and therefore it does not satisfy the second explanation.",

            "The Gemara answers that this is <b>as it is written: “Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks [<i>pera</i>] to grow long”</b> (Ezekiel 44:20), <b>and it is written</b> immediately <b>afterward: “Neither shall any priest drink wine when they enter the inner courtyard”</b> (Ezekiel 44:21). <b>And</b> in this manner the prohibition concerning <b>those who have long hair is juxtaposed with</b> the prohibition concerning <b>those who have drunk wine,</b> to teach the following: <b>Just as those who have drunk wine</b> and perform the Temple service are subject <b>to death, so too, those who have long hair</b> are punishable <b>by death.</b>",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>And from this</b> comparison one can also argue as follows: <b>If</b> so, <b>just as those who have drunk wine desecrate</b> the Temple <b>service, so too, those who have long hair desecrate the service.</b> The Gemara rejects this contention: <b>No, when</b> the two cases <b>were juxtaposed,</b> it was with regard <b>to death that</b> they <b>were juxtaposed. However,</b> as <b>for desecrating</b> the Temple <b>service,</b> in this regard they <b>were not juxtaposed.</b> Consequently, Rav Ashi’s distinction concerning the practical application of these two <i>halakhot</i> still applies.",
            "On this issue, <b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Before Ezekiel came</b> and stated this <i>halakha</i>, <b>who said it?</b> From where was it derived before Ezekiel that priests may not serve with long hair? This prohibition, which is not mentioned in the Torah, could not have been innovated by Ezekiel, as prophets may not enact new <i>halakhot</i>. Rav Ashi <b>said to him: And according to your reasoning,</b> there is a similar difficulty with <b>that which Rabbi Ḥisda said: This matter,</b> that an uncircumcised priest may not serve in the Temple, <b>we did not learn it from the Torah of Moses,</b> but <b>we learned it from the text of the tradition,</b> i.e., Prophets and Writings: <b>“No stranger, uncircumcised in heart or uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter my Temple”</b> (Ezekiel 44:9). <b>Before Ezekiel came, who said</b> that it is prohibited for an uncircumcised priest to serve?",
            "<b>Rather,</b> you must say that it <b>is learned</b> as a definite <b>tradition,</b> like the rest of the Oral Torah, <b>and Ezekiel came and supported it by</b> means of <b>a verse</b> in his book. He did not, however, teach this <i>halakha</i> anew. <b>Here too,</b> with regard to a priest with long hair, it <b>is learned</b> as a tradition, <b>and Ezekiel came and supported it by a verse.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is itself difficult.</b> Initially, <b>you said</b> that if a dangerous beast is <b>seen in the city,</b> this is <b>an outbreak,</b> which indicates that it <b>is no different</b> whether it is seen by day and <b>it is no different</b> if it is seen at night. <b>And then you said:</b> If the animal is seen <b>during the day,</b> this is <b>an outbreak;</b> if it is seen <b>at night,</b> this is <b>not an outbreak.</b>",
            "The Gemara resolves this difficulty: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> If it is <b>seen in the city during the day,</b> this is <b>an outbreak;</b> if it is seen <b>in the city at night,</b> this is <b>not an outbreak.

            "The Gemara inquires about another apparent contradiction: The <i>baraita</i> states that if the beast <b>saw two people and chased after them,</b> this is <b>an outbreak.</b> This indicates that if <b>it stands</b> but does not run away, this is <b>not an outbreak. And then you said</b> that if it <b>hid from them,</b> this is <b>not an outbreak,</b> from which it may be inferred that if <b>it stands</b> and does not run away, this is <b>an outbreak.</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as the two sections of the <i>baraita</i> describe different situations. <b>Here,</b> where it is an outbreak, the beast is <b>standing in a field near a marsh.</b> It is natural for the animal to stand, for the beast knows that if people attempt to catch it, it can run into the marsh. Conversely, <b>there,</b> where it is not an outbreak, the beast is <b>standing in a field that is not near a marsh.</b> Since it has nowhere to run, standing demonstrates an unnatural lack of fear.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> taught that if the beast <b>tore apart two people and ate one of them,</b> this is <b>an outbreak,</b> but if it <b>ate both of them</b> this is <b>not an outbreak.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t you say</b> that <b>even</b> if the animal merely <b>chased after</b> two people, this is an outbreak? <b>Rav Pappa said: When that</b> ruling of a beast that tore apart two people <b>is taught,</b> it is referring to an animal <b>in a marsh.</b> Since it is in its own habitat, it is natural for a territorial beast to attack.",
            "The Gemara returns to <b>the</b> matter of the <i>baraita</i> <b>itself.</b> If a wild animal <b>climbed to the roof and took a baby from</b> its <b>cradle,</b> this is <b>an outbreak.</b> The Gemara asks: It <b>is obvious</b> that this animal is acting unnaturally. Why does the <i>baraita</i> mention this case? <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring to the roof of <b>a hunter’s hideout.</b> Since this hut is in a wild area, one might have thought that it is natural for the beast to attack.

            "The Gemara asks a question about one of the details of this story. <b>And Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa, from where did he have goats?

How, then, could Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa raise goats? <b>Rav Pineḥas</b> said that this is how it came to pass: <b>An incident</b> occurred in which <b>a certain man passed by the entrance of</b> Rabbi Ḥanina’s <b>house and left chickens there.
