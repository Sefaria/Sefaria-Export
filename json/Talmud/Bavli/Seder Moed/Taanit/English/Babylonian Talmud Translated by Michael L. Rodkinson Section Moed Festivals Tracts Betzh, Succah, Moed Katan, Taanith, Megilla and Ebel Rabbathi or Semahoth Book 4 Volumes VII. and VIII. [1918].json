            "\"For,\" said he to R. Eliezer, \"since rain on the Feast of Tabernacles is considered unpropitious, why should it be mentioned in the prayers?\" And R. Eliezer answered: \"I do not mean to say that rain should be prayed for, but only that it should be mentioned with the words, 'He causeth the wind to blow, and the rain to descend in its proper time.'\" \"If so,\" rejoined R. Jehoshua, \"such mention might be made at all seasons of the year.\"",
            "Prayers for rain should not be said sooner than shortly before the commencement of the rainy season. R. Jehudah said: \"The last of the ministers of the congregation who on the last day of the Feast of Tabernacles officiates at the reading-desk should mention the rain, but not he who officiates first. On the first day of Passover, the minister who officiates first (at the morning prayer) should still mention it, but not he who officiates last (at the Additional Service).\"...",
            "GEMARA: Whence does the Tana of this Mishna adduce that the rain must be mentioned or prayed for at all (in the daily prayer), that he commences by saying: \"From what time should it be mentioned\"? He adduces this ",
            "",
            "",
            "from the Mishna in Tract Rosh-Hashana (New Year) where he has learned that on the Feast of Tabernacles judgment is passed concerning rain, and having learned this, he proceeds to inform us when rain must be mentioned and prayed for.",
            "If so, let him teach us concerning the rain--why does he mention \"the power manifested in the descent of rain\"? Said R. Johanan: \"Because rain descends with the power of God, as it is written [Job, v. 10]: 'Who giveth rain upon the surface of the earth, and sendeth out waters over the face of the fields'; and further it is written [ibid. ix. 10]: 'Who doeth great things which are quite unsearchable, and wonders which are quite without number (and rain is also included among these \"great things\").",

            "",
            "Whence do we know, however, that mention must be made of rain in the eighteen benedictions of the daily prayer? Because we have learned in a Boraitha thus: It is written [Deut. xi. 13]: \"To love the Lord your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.\" And what service can be performed with the heart? The service of prayer, and immediately following the passage quoted it is said [ibid. 14]: \"I will send rain for your land in its due season, the first rain and the latter rain,\" etc.",
            "R. Johanan said: Three keys are in the hands of the Holy One, blessed be He, which are not intrusted to any messenger, and they are: The key of rain, the key for a woman lying-in, and the key for the resurrection of the dead.",
            "The key of rain, as it is written [Deut. xxviii. 12]: \"The Lord will open unto thee his good treasure, the heaven, to give the rain of thy land in its season\"; the key for a woman lying-in, as it is written [Genesis, xxx. 22]: \"And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, "

            "and opened her womb\"; and the key for the resurrection of the dead, as it is written [Ezekiel, xxxvii. 13]: \"And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I open your graves and when I cause you to come up out of your graves, O my people.\" ",
            "The sages of the West say, that also the key to a man's earnings are in the hands of God alone, as it is written [Psalms, cxlv. 16]: \"Thou openest thy hand and satisfiest the desire of every living thing.\" Why did not R. Johanan mention this also? Because R. Johanan may claim that rain itself is the means of earning a livelihood.",
            "\"R. Eliezer said: 'From the first day of the Feast of Tabernacles.'\" The schoolmen propounded a question: Whence does R. Eliezer derive his teaching? Does he derive it from the palm-branch which is brought along for use at the morning service only, or from the pouring of water, which is brought also in the evening, ",
            "as the Master says: \"It is written [Numb. xxix. 24.]: 'Their meat-offerings and their drink-offerings' (in plural), that is to say, that they may be brought even in the evening, and therefore R. Eliezer holds that mention of the rain should be made even on the eve of the Feast of Tabernacles?\"",
            "Come and hear: R. Abbahu said: \"R. Eliezer derived his teaching from the palm-branch.\" Some say, that R. Abbahu had a tradition to that effect, while others hold that he takes it from the following Boraitha: ",
            "From what time is mention made of rain in the daily prayer? R. Eliezer said: \"From the time the palm-branch is taken\" (i.e., from the time the morning-prayer is said). R. Jehoshua, however, said: \"From the time when the palm-branch is laid aside\" (i.e., from the time of the Additional Prayer, when the palm-branch is not used).",
            "Said R. Eliezer: \"Because the four articles <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> See Leviticus, xxiii. 40. </i>of the Feast of Tabernacles are used only for the purpose of favorably inclining the judgment concerning rain; and as those four articles cannot grow without water, neither can the world exist without water, therefore mention of rain must be made even in the morning.\"",
            " And R. Jehoshua replied: \"But rain during the festival of Tabernacles is considered an unpropitious event!\" (because it prevents the sitting in the booth). Whereupon R. Eliezer rejoined: \"I do not mean to say that rain should be prayed for but merely that it should be mentioned, and it is the same as the mention of the resurrection of the dead, which though this can take place only at the appointed time, it us nevertheless mentioned all the year round. Therefore if a man desires to mention rain in the prayer the whole year, he may do so.\"  Rabbi, however, said: \"I say, that when a man ceases to pray for rain, he should also cease mentioning it.\"",
            "And R. Jehudah ben Bathyra said: \"Mention of the rain should begin to be made on the second day of the Feast of Tabernacles.\" R. Aqiba said: \"Even on the sixth day.\" R. Jehudah in the name of R. Jehoshua said: \"The last of the ministers of the congregation who on the last day of the Feast of Tabernacles officiates at the reading-desk should mention the rain; but not he who officiates first. On the first day of the Passover, the minister who officiates first should still mention it, but not he who officiates last.\""

            "During the rainy season if he omitted in his prayer the words, \"He causeth the wind to blow,\" he need not be made to say the prayer over again, but if he omitted the words, \"He causeth the rain to descend,\" he should be made to say the prayer again.

I will burn it up for a burnt-offering.\" The prayer was improper, because an unclean thing (such as a swine or a dog) might have come forth which would not be a proper sacrifice, and the answer was also not proper, for his own daughter came forth to meet him.",
            "This causes the wrathful query of Jeremiah the prophet, as it is written [Jeremiah, viii. 22]: \"Is there no more balm in Gilead? or is no physician there?\"(meaning was there not Pin'has the high-priest in Gilead, who could have released Jephthah of his vow?). <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Elsewhere the Talmud rebukes both Jephthah and Pin'has; Jephthah would not go to Pin'has because he, being a prince, considered himself the superior of Pin'has, while Pin'has, being high-priest, thought it below his dignity to go to Jephthah, and on account of this pride a human life was sacrificed. </i>.",
