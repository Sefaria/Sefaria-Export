            "Hezekiah, King of Yehudah, did four things in which his thought was in accord with Gd’s intention. He hid away the Book of Healing, and his thought was in accord with Gd’s intention. He destroyed the bronze snake, and his thought was in accord with Gd’s intention, as it says “…for until those days the children of Israel were burning incense to it; and he called it Nechushtan.” (Kings II 18:4) He removed the altars and high places and his thought was in accord with Gd’s intention, as it says “Did not he - Hezekiah - remove His high places and His altars and say to Judah and to Jerusalem, saying: Before one altar you shall prostrate yourselves, and upon it you shall burn incense?” (Chronicles II 32:12) He blocked up the waters of the Gihon spring and his thought was in accord with Gd’s intention, as it says “And he-Hezekiah-stopped up the source of the waters of the upper Gihon, and he led them straight down on the west to the City of David, and Hezekiah prospered in all his works.” (Chronicles II 32:12)"
