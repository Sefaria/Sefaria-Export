            "Moses was sanctified by the cloud and received the Torah at Sinai, as it is stated, <i>And the glory of the Lord abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered him six days</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ex. 24, 16, E.V. <i>covered it</i>.</i> [It covered Moses] in order to cleanse him, and this occurred after [the proclamation of] the Ten Commandments. So expounded R. Jose the Galilean. R. Aḳiba said: The verse <i>and the cloud covered him six days</i> refers to [the mountain and not to] Moses.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This reading is adopted by all Commentators and has MS. support. The sense of the controversy also requires this reading.</i> The continuation of the verse, <i>And the seventh day He called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud</i>, is to single Moses out for special honour.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The two views represented in this passage originate in the meaning given to the suffix of the verb <i>covered</i> which can signify ‘him’ or ‘it’. R. Jose is of the opinion that immediately after the declaration of the Ten Commandments, which occurred on the sixth day of Sivan, Moses was enveloped by a Divine Cloud and thereby underwent a seven-day period of purification before he could ascend the mount and approach the Divine Presence for his forty days’ stay. A similar purification was prescribed in Temple times for the High Priest before entering upon the ritual of the Day of Atonement. R. ‘Aḳiba, on the other hand, holds that the Cloud covered the mountain and not Moses. Moses was not required to undergo a period of purification, because the call to him to ascend the mount came to him on the seventh day of the month counting from the day on which Israel arrived in the wilderness of Sinai (cf. Ex. 19, 1). The call to Moses from among the assembly of Israel was merely a mark of honour, to show that he stood high above the congregation. Cf. Yoma 4aff (Sonc. ed., pp. 13ff). For the background of this controversy, cf. L. Finkelstein, <i>Mabo le-Massektot Abot ve-Abot d’Rabbi Nathan</i>, English summary, p. XXIX, note 4.</i><br>R. Nathan said: Why was it that Moses remained on the mountain six whole days without the Word<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Dibbur</i>, a Rabbinic term for Divine Revelation.</i> descending upon him? It was that he might be purged of all food and drink which were in his bowels, until such time as he would become holy and be like the ministering angels.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">[For the idea of unevacuated food being a bodily defilement, cf. Semaḥot III, 10 (below, p. 338) and A. Büchler, <i>Studies in Sin and Atonement</i>, pp. 328ff.]</i> R. Mathia b. Ḥeresh said to him, ‘Master, surely the only purpose was to impress him so that he should receive the words of the Torah with awe and fear, with dread and trembling, as it is stated, <i>Serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ps. 2, 11.</i><br>It is related that R. Josiah and R. Mathia b. Ḥeresh happened to be sitting engaged in the study of the Torah, when R. Josiah departed to pursue some secular affairs. R. Mathia b. Ḥeresh said to him, ‘Master, why do you forsake the words of the living God and immerse yourself in secular affairs? And though you are my teacher and I your pupil, [I venture to say that] it is not right to forsake the words of the living God and immerse oneself in secular affairs’. It was said of them that while they were engaged together in the study of the Torah they were like foes one towards the other, but when they departed they were like lifelong friends.",
            "By the hand of Moses was the Torah given at Sinai, as it is stated, <i>And He wrote them upon two tables of stone, and gave them unto me</i>;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 5, 19.</i> and in another passage it is stated, <i>These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which the Lord made between Him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lev. 26, 46.</i> The Torah which the Holy One, blessed be He, gave to Israel was given solely through Moses, as it is stated, <i>Between Him and the children of Israel</i>. Thus Moses was worthy to become the intermediary between Israel and the All-present. Moses offered the ram of consecration<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">By which Aaron and his sons were initiated into the priesthood; cf. Ex. 29.</i> and prepared the anointing oil with which he anointed Aaron and his sons during the seven days of consecration.

As Eleazar, Aaron’s son, acted in this matter on the instruction and under the direction of Moses, the whole ritual is referable to Moses, and on that account it was effective for all future generations.</i> from whose ashes all the unclean of later generations were made clean. R. Eliezer said: Great was this act<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">lit. ‘measure’, of anointing oil.</i> because it was effective for all future generations, since Aaron and his sons were consecrated with this anointing oil [and their priesthood continued for many generations], as it is stated, <i>And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and sanctify them, that they may minister unto Me in the priest’s office</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ex. 30, 30.</i>",
            "Joshua received [the Torah] from Moses, as it is stated, <i>And thou shalt put of thy honour upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may hearken</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Num. 27, 20.</i><br>The elders received it from Joshua, as it is stated, <i>And the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of the Lord, that He had wrought for Israel</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Judg. 2, 7.</i><br>The Judges received it from the elders,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">So according to the MSS. and as corrected by GRA.

Quotations from Aboth are printed in capitals.</i>",
            "<small>BE DELIBERATE IN JUDGMENT</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that a man should be cautious in judgment, because the more cautious a man is in judgment the more confirmed is he in his judgment, as it is stated, <i>These are the proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Prov. 25, 1.</i>—they did not merely copy them out but deliberated on them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Heb. for <i>copied out</i> (<i>he ‘etiḳu</i>) may also be derived from a root meaning ‘to grow old, to spend much time’; hence the suggested interpretation ‘pondered over, deliberated’. The proverbs were studied for a long time and their meaning elucidated.</i> Abba Saul said: [The meaning is] not that they deliberated on them but brought them to light.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Giving the Heb. verb <i>he’etiḳu</i> the sense of ‘moving from a place’ as in Gen. 12, 8; hence bringing out the work from its place of concealment to the light of day. The interpretation is also borne by the late Heb. verb <i>perash</i> used by Abba Saul; cf. Reifmann in <i>Keneset Hagedolah</i> I, p. 91. According to Finkelstein, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 126, <i>perash</i> here signifies ‘they put aside’ for concealment and burial.</i> At first it was held that the books of Proverbs, Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes were to be stored away<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e. not regarded as canonical Scriptures.</i> since they merely contained aphorisms and were not part of the [holy] writings. Thereupon they condemned them to be stored away, [and so they remained] until the men of the Great Assembly<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">All commentators rightly emend to ‘the men of Hezekiah’.</i> came and brought them to light again. For it is stated,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verses which follow are typical examples of passages from the books mentioned which ostensibly deal with erotic themes and as such are unworthy of a place in the Scriptures.</i> <i>And I beheld among the thoughtless ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding…. And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of a harlot, and wily of heart. She is riotous and rebellious, her feet abide not in her house; now she is in the streets, now in the broad places, and lieth in wait at every corner. So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face she said to him: Sacrifices of peace-offerings were due from me; this day have I paid my vows. Therefore came I forth to meet thee, to seek thy face, and I have found thee. I have decked my couch with coverlets, with striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt. I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning; let us solace ourselves with loves. For my husband is not at home, he is gone a long journey; he hath taken the bag of money with him; he will come home at the full moon</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Prov. 7, 7, 10-20.</i> And it is written in the Song of Songs: <i>Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field;</i> [17<i>a</i>] <i>let us lodge in the villages. Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see whether the vine hath budded, whether the vine-blossom be opened, and the pomegranates be in flower; there will I give thee my love</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cant. 7, 12f.</i> And it is written in Ecclesiastes: <i>Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes; but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Eccl. 11, 9.</i> And it is further written in the Song of Songs: <i>I am my beloved’s and his desire is toward me</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cant. 7, 11.</i> Thus they did not deliberate on them but brought them to light.<br>Another interpretation of <small>BE DELIBERATE IN JUDGMENT</small>: What does it mean? It teaches that a man should speak his words calmly and should not speak in anger; for he who speaks in anger will [in the end] cause his words to be forgotten. We find it so in the case of Moses our master that he forgot his words, as it is stated, <i>And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war that went to the battle: This is the statute of the law which the Lord hath commanded Moses</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Num. 31, 21.</i> He commanded Moses but not me; He commanded Moses, my father’s brother, but not me.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although Moses received the law from God, he had forgotten it on account of his anger, and it was left to Eleazar the priest to instruct the warriors.</i> And where do we find that Moses had spoken in anger? It states, <i>And Moses was wrath with the officers of the Lord…. And Moses said unto them: Have ye saved all the women alive?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>ibid.</i> 14f.</i> Why does the verse state <i>all the women?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This sentence is deleted by GRA who reads instead: ‘What is meant by <i>through the counsel of Balaam</i> (<i>ibid.</i> 16)?’</i> It is because of the advice which the wicked Balaam counselled against Israel, as it is written, <i>And now, behold, I go unto my people; come, and I will announce to thee what this people shall do to thy people in the end of days</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>ibid.</i> XXIV, 14.</i> He said to Balak, ‘This people whom you hate is hungry for food and athirst for drink, since they have nothing to eat or drink except the manna alone. Go, then, erect booths for them, set out food and drink for them, and place there beautiful girls of royal station, to the end that the people may stray after Baal of Peor, and they will fall by the hand of the All-present’. Forthwith Balak proceeded to carry out all that the wicked Balaam had counselled. See, now, what calamity that wicked Balaam brought upon Israel, since through him there fell twenty and four thousand of them, as it is stated, <i>And these that died by the plague were twenty and four thousand</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>ibid.</i> XXV, 9.</i> Is there not here an argument from the greater to the less? If it happened to Moses, who was the wisest among the wise and the greatest among the great, the father of the prophets, that when he spoke in anger he forgot his words, how much more so [does this apply to us ordinary persons]! It therefore teaches that a man should speak his words calmly and not speak in anger.<br>Ben ‘Azzai said: Beware of idle chatter in your speech.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Do not misuse the gift of speech with empty talk.</i>",
            "<small>AND MAKE A FENCE ROUND THE TORAH</small>. Make a fence to your words as the Holy One, blessed be He, made a fence to His words; and likewise Adam the first man, the Torah, Moses, Job, the Prophets, the Writings,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e. the Hagiographa, the third division of the Scriptures. The word is inserted here by GRA and is attested by the MSS.</i> and the Sages all made a fence to their words.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The usual meaning given to the maxim ‘make a fence’ is that the Rabbis added restrictions and further severities to the Torah to avoid the infringement of the commandment. The examples cited, however, as illustrations of those who ‘made fences’, differ in character from each other and do not conform to the pattern of the traditional definition. The older and perhaps original meaning of the maxim was an injunction to the Rabbis to explain and present the reasons for their decision, thereby safeguarding it against ridicule and rejection. It is in this sense that God made a fence to His words. As a development of the original meaning of the maxim was the exhortation to the Rabbis to express the power of God in a form intelligible to human beings; this was the ‘fence’ adopted by the Prophets. The other examples of ‘fences’ are additional prohibitions in the usual sense. For a detailed discussion on this subject, cf. the essays of Finkelstein in <i>Journal of Biblical Literature</i>, vol. LVII (1938), pp. 13-50, and vol. LIX (1940), pp. 455-469.</i><br>What fence did the Holy One, blessed be He, make to His words? It is stated, <i>Even all the nations shall say; Wherefore hath the Lord done thus unto this land?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 29, 23.</i> This teaches that it was already revealed to Him Who spoke and the world came into being<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">[For this designation of God, cf. A. Marmorstein, <i>The Old Rabbinic Doctrine of God</i>, I, p. 89.]</i> that future generations will ask: <i>Wherefore hath the Lord done thus unto this land?</i> Consequently the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, ‘Moses, write [down the answer] and place it on record for generations to come: <i>Then men shall say: Because they forsook the covenant of the Lord … and went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods that they knew not, and that He had not allotted unto them</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>ibid.</i> 24f. In this passage there is a vindication of God’s actions. Lest the nations misjudge and deem them tyrannical or arbitrary, it is stated from the beginning what calamities will befall the people in the event of disobedience. Cf. the parallel passage in <i>’Aboth d’Rabbi Nathan</i>, Recension II, ed. Schechter, p. 3.</i> Hence you learn that the Holy One, blessed be He, made a fence to His words, and recorded in the Torah what people would say in the future; thus bearing witness that the Holy One, blessed be He, pays His creatures their reward in full.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A difficult passage with the text in an uncertain state. The translation follows the text as emended by Finkelstein, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 116, reading <i>dikthab battorah</i> for <i>dikthib bathreh</i> and ‘<i>edin</i> (i.e. <i>‘edim</i>) for <i>‘adayin</i>. The Meiri in his commentary on Aboth explains the last sentence to mean that God prescribed in His Torah only such laws as were acceptable to man and within the capacity of human activity, and did not lay upon His creatures impossible demands. In this way mankind was afforded an opportunity of drawing a full reward.</i><br>What fence did Adam, the first man, make to his words? It is stated, <i>And the Lord God commanded the man, saying: Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gen. 2, 16f.</i> Adam was unwilling to tell this to Eve exactly as the Holy One, blessed be He, had commanded him; he therefore made a fence to his words, over and above the words which the Holy One, blessed be He, had spoken to him, and this is what he said to her, <i>But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said: Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>ibid.</i> III, 3.</i> By so doing he meant to keep both himself and Eve away from the tree, even to the extent of not touching it. At that moment the wicked serpent reasoned to himself saying, ‘Since I cannot bring about the fall of Adam, I will bring about the fall of Eve’. Thereupon he went and seated himself beside Eve and entered into much conversation with her. He said, ‘If you think it is the touching [of the tree] that the Holy One, blessed be He, has forbidden us, behold I will touch it and not die; so you, too, will not die if you touch it’. What did the wicked serpent then do? He arose, touched the tree with his hands and feet, and shook it violently so that its fruit fell to the ground. There are some, however, who say that he did not actually touch it, but that as soon as the tree saw him it cried out, ‘O wicked one, do not touch me’; as it is stated, <i>Let not the foot of pride overtake me, and let not the hand of the wicked shake me</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. Ps. 36, 12. E.V., <i>let not the hand of the wicked drive me away</i>.</i>",
            "Another interpretation of the verse, <i>Let not the foot of pride overtake me</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This was the cry of the altar when Titus entered the Temple.</i> refers it to Titus, may his bones rot! For he raised his hand in contempt and struck the altar exclaiming, ‘Lukos! Lukos!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A Greek word meaning ‘wolf’, here applied opprobiously to the altar. Cf. Suk. 56b (Sonc. ed., p. 276).</i> You are a king just as I am a king, come and engage in battle with me. How many oxen have been slain upon you! How many birds have been killed upon you! How much wine has been poured out upon you! How much incense has been burned upon you! It is you who are destroying the whole world’, as it is stated, <i>Ah, Ariel, Ariel</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A poetical name for the altar.</i> <i>the city where David was encamped! Add ye year to year, let the feasts come round!</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Is. 29, 1. The reference is to the countless sacrifices offered on the altars at every season because of the many sins of the people.</i><br>Furthermore the serpent said to her, ‘If you think it is the eating [of the fruit of the tree] that the Holy One, blessed be He, has forbidden us, behold I will eat of it and will not die; so you, too, will not die if you eat of it’. Eve then began to think to herself, ‘All that my master has commanded me from the beginning is false’—for Eve used to address Adam as ‘master from the beginning’. She immediately took of the fruit and ate it, and also gave some to Adam, which he ate, as it is stated, <i>And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes</i>, etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gen. 3, 6.</i>",
            "With ten curses was Eve cursed at that time, as it is stated, <i>Unto the woman He said: I will multiply and multiply thy pain and thy travail; in pain thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>ibid.</i> 16, so lit. E.V., <i>I will greatly multiply</i>.</i> <i>I will multiply and multiply</i>—these are the two discharges of blood [which cause pain to women], the menstrual and [at the termination of] virginity. [<i>Thy pain</i>—this is the anxiety connected with the rearing of children.]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Inserted by GRA in accordance with ‘Erub. 100b (Sonc. ed., p. 697).</i> <i>And thy travail</i>—this is the pain associated with conception. <i>In pain thou shalt bring forth children</i>—this is to be understood in its literal meaning. <i>And thy desire shall be to thy husband</i>—this teaches that a woman particularly yearns for her husband when he is about to set out on a journey. <i>And he shall rule over thee</i>—for the man solicits by word of mouth whereas the woman solicits in her heart. [Furthermore, during her periods] she is wrapped up like a mourner, shut up as in a prison and banished from the company of all men. Now what brought about the act of touching? The answer is the fence which Adam had made to his words.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Adam’s fault was that he had attached as great importance to the ‘fence’ as to the original command.</i> Hence [the Sages] said: When a man makes a fence to his words, he is not always able to stand by his words. They further said: Hence let not a man add to the words which he has heard. R. Jose said: A firm [wall] of ten hand-breadths is better than a tottering [wall] of a hundred cubits.<br>What was in the mind of the wicked serpent at that time? ‘I will go,’ he thought, ‘slay Adam and marry his wife; then I will be king over the whole world. I shall also walk erect and eat all the dainties of the world.’ Whereupon the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, ‘You reckoned [17<i>b</i>] to slay Adam and marry Eve; therefore <i>I will put enmity between thee and the woman</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>ibid.</i> 15.</i> You reckoned to be king over the whole world; therefore <i>Cursed art thou from among all cattle</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>ibid.</i> 14.</i> You reckoned to walk erect; therefore <i>Upon thy belly shalt thou go</i>. You reckoned to eat all the dainties of the world; therefore <i>Dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life</i>.<br>R. Simeon b. Menasia said: Alas for the most useful servant that was lost to the world! For had not the serpent been cursed, every Israelite would have been provided with two serpents for his personal use at home; one he would send to the west and the other to the east, to bring him thence gems, precious stones, pearls and every desirable thing in the world, and no creature could ever injure them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Or, according to another reading: ‘could ever hold them back’.</i> Moreover, they could have been employed in the place of camels, asses and mules to provide manure for gardens and orchards.",

And why was this so?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e. why was Adam created last of all, on the sixth day just before the commencement of the Sabbath?</i> In order that [Adam] might immediately partake of the Sabbath meal.<br>R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: I will expound this to you with a parable. To what might Adam be compared? To a man who married a proselyte and used to give her instruction, saying, ‘My dear, do not eat bread when your hands are defiled, do not eat untithed produce, do not profane the Sabbath, do not make vows rashly, and do not associate with another man. If you break one of these rules, you will die’.

V reads ‘what did that man do’, apparently referring to the husband.</i> He arose and ate in her presence bread although his hands were defiled, he ate before her untithed produce—he profaned the Sabbath and made vows rashly—and also offered her some [of the food].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Adopting the reading of MS. E, lit. ‘he handed her with his hands’. V ‘and brought out to her’.</i> What could that proselyte have thought to herself? All that my husband forbade me in the beginning was without foundation. She thereupon went and transgressed them all.<br>R. Simeon b. Yoḥai said: I, too, will explain this to you by a parable. To what might Adam be compared? To a man who had his wife at home with him. Now what did that man do? He went and brought a cask into which he put an exact number of figs and nuts. He also caught a scorpion, placed it in the mouth of the cask, covered the cask with a tight-fitting lid and put it away in a corner. He then said to his wife, ‘My dear, all that I possess in this house is at your disposal except this cask which you may not touch under any circumstances’. What did this woman do? No sooner had her husband gone off to market than she arose, opened the cask, put her hand in it and was bitten by the scorpion. Immediately she went and flung herself on her bed. When her husband returned from market he asked her what had happened, and she replied, ‘I put my hand in the cask and was bitten by a scorpion, and now I am dying’. He said to her, ‘Did I not tell you in the beginning that everything I had in the house was at your disposal except that cask which you were not to touch under any circumstances?’ He at once became furious with her and drove her out. So it was with Adam, the first man, when the Holy One, blessed be He, charged him, <i>Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">74</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gen. 2, 16f.</i> No sooner had Adam eaten of it than he was driven out [of Eden], to fulfil that which is stated, <i>Man tarrieth not overnight in his glory; he is like the beasts that perish</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">75</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ps. 49, 13.

According to GRA and MS. E seven came down, since two twin sisters were born with Abel; cf.

Most scholars, following GRA, substitute ‘seven’ for ‘three’, and the reference is to the monthly period of uncleanness. The ‘latter days of impurity’ would be, what is known in Talmudic phraseology, ‘the days of white garments’, i.e. the seven days of observation after the. cessation of the discharge. During this period a woman is forbidden by Rabbinic law all intimacy with her husband, including acts of endearment.</i> She said to him ‘Master, God forbid!

And so we find it with Daniel, the man greatly beloved, who devoted himself to acts of lovingkindness. What were the acts of lovingkindness to which Daniel devoted himself? If you say that he offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings in Babylon, had it not been previously ordained, <i>Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt-offerings in every place that thou seest; but in the place which the Lord shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt-offerings</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 12, 13f.</i> What, then, were the acts of lovingkindness to which he devoted himself?

What do I demand of you? Merely that you deliver to me one bow or one arrow<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A token of submission.</i> and then I will depart from you’.

The version given here differs in many respects from other passages in Rabbinic literature relating to Vespasian; cf. Giṭ. 56b (Sonc. ed., p. 258). [S. Zeitlin, <i>Megillat Taanit</i>, p. 104, writes: “The two former generals were undoubtedly Florus and Cestius”, whose armies were defeated in 66 <small>C.E.</small>, but the generals were not killed by the Jews.]</i> and slew them, so we will go out against you and slay you’. When Rabban Joḥanan b. Zakkai heard this, he sent for the men of Jerusalem and said to them, ‘My sons, why would you destroy this city and burn the Temple? What does he demand of you? Merely one bow or one arrow, and then he will depart from you’. They answered him, ‘As we went forth against his two predecessors and slew them, so we will go out against him and slay him’.<br>Now Vespasian had some men of his resident [within and] close to the walls of Jerusalem, and whatever they heard they wrote upon an arrow which they shot beyond the wall. [In this manner] they reported that Rabban Joḥanan b. Zakkai was among Caesar’s friends. So Rabban Joḥanan b. Zakkai appealed to the men of Jerusalem. After he had pleaded with them for several days<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">lit. ‘one day and two and three days’.</i> and they would not agree with him, he sent for his disciples, R. Eliezer and R. Joshua, and said to them, ‘My sons, arise and carry me forth from here. Make a coffin for me and I will lie in it’. [They did so, and] R. Eliezer took hold of it at the head and R. Joshua at the foot, and they carried him until sunset when they arrived at the gates of Jerusalem. The gatekeepers asked, ‘What is this?’ They replied, ‘A dead man; do you not know that a corpse may not be kept overnight in Jerusalem?’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. below XXXV, 2, p. 171.</i> They said, ‘If it is a corpse, carry it out’.

A variant gives the curious reading: ‘the precept of <i>tefillin</i> (phylacteries)’.</i> and observe all the commandments prescribed in the Torah’. He said to him, ‘Go and do all that you wish to perform’. Rabban Joḥanan then said, ‘May I be permitted to say a word to you?’ ‘Speak,’ he said. Rabban Joḥanan then said, ‘You are about to become Emperor’. ‘How do you know this?’ he asked, and Rabban Joḥanan replied, ‘There is a tradition with us that the Temple will not be delivered into the hand of a common soldier but to a king, as it is stated, <i>And He shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one</i>’.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Is. 10, 34.

            "What was the beginning of R. Eliezer b. Hyrḳanos? He was twenty-two years old and had not yet studied Torah. One day he said [to his father], ‘I will go and study Torah under Rabban Joḥanan b. Zakkai’. His father Hyrḳanos replied, ‘You shall not taste a morsel of food until you shall have ploughed a complete furrow’. He rose early in the morning and ploughed a complete furrow. It is said that that day was the eve of the Sabbath, so that he went and dined at the house of his father-in-law. Another version is that he tasted nothing between six hours before the Sabbath and six hours after the Sabbath. As he was walking on his way he saw a stone which he thought<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An unusual word in this context. MS. E. reads <i>herimah</i> (he lifted it up).</i> [to be food]; he took it and put it in his mouth—some say that it was cattle dung. He walked on until he came to an inn where he spent the night. He went and sat before Rabban Joḥanan b. Zakkai in Jerusalem. Soon an offensive smell came forth from his mouth; whereupon Rabban Joḥanan b. Zakkai said, ‘Eliezer, my son, have you eaten anything to-day!’ He did not answer. Again the question was put to him and he still remained silent. The innkeeper was sent for and asked, ‘Has Eliezer eaten with you?’ He replied, ‘I thought that perhaps he had eaten at your table, Master’. ‘I, too, thought that perhaps he had eaten at your table,’ said Rabban Joḥanan; ‘between us we might have lost R. Eliezer.’ He then said to Eliezer, ‘Just as an offensive smell came forth from your mouth, so shall there go forth from you a distinguished name in Torah’.<br>When his father Hyrḳanos heard that he was studying Torah under Rabban Joḥanan b. Zakkai, he declared, ‘I shall go [to Jerusalem] and prohibit my son Eliezer by vow [from deriving any benefit] from my estate’. It was said that on that day Rabban Joḥanan b. Zakkai was sitting and expounding the Torah in Jerusalem, and all the notables of Israel were sitting before him. On learning that Hyrḳanos had arrived, he posted watchmen and charged them, ‘If Hyrḳanos comes in and wishes to sit down,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Among the scholars in the back rows.</i> do not let him.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He would then have to move forward to the front rows, thus coming closer to his son and witnessing his distinction.</i> When he came in and wished to sit down, they did not allow him to do so, and he was compelled to move forward<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">lit. ‘he was leaping and going forward’.</i> until he came to where Ben Ẓiẓith Hakkeseth, Naḳdimon b. Gorion, and Ben Kalba Sabua‘<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These three men are named as being extremely wealthy in Giṭ. 56a (Sonc. ed., p. 256).</i> were seated, and he sat down among them trembling. It was said that on that day Rabban Joḥanan b. Zakkai turned his gaze upon R. Eliezer and bade him commence the discourse. He said, ‘I cannot do so’. The master as well as the disciples urged him, whereupon he began the discourse and expounded matters about which no ear had ever heard [the like]. At every utterance that came from his lips, Rabban Joḥanan b. Zakkai stood up and kissed him on the head; but R. Eliezer exclaimed, ‘My master, you have taught me the truth’. Before the time of adjournment had arrived, his father Hyrḳanos stood up and said, ‘My masters, I came here for the sole purpose of depriving my son Eliezer by vow of my property, but now [I declare] all my property assigned to my son Eliezer, [21<i>a</i>] and all his brothers stand dispossessed and deprived of everything’.<br>Why was Ẓiẓith Hakkeseth so named? Because he used to recline upon a silver couch at the head of all the notables of Israel.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On the basis of the explanation given here it has been argued that the correct form of the name is Ẓiẓith Hakkesef, i.e. ‘Ẓiẓith of the silver (couch)’. This variant has some MS. authority; cf. Finkelstein, <i>op. cit.</i> p. 135. In the Talmud (Giṭ. <i>loc. cit.</i>) he was so called because his fringes (<i>ẓiẓith</i>) used to trail on cushions (<i>keseth</i>), or his seat (<i>kisse’</i>) was among those of the Roman nobility.</i><br>It is related concerning the daughter of Naḳdimon b. Gorion that her bed had been arrayed at the cost of twelve thousand golden <i>dinars</i>, and that from one eve of the Sabbath to the next a Tyrian golden <i>dinar</i> was spent by her on sweetmeats.

Naḳdimon went to a certain nobleman and said to him, ‘Lend me twelve wells of water from now until such and such a day, and if I do not repay you twelve wells of water I will give you twelve talents of silver’. He fixed a time-limit for repayment. When the time came the nobleman sent him [the message], ‘Deliver to me either twelve wells of water or twelve talents of silver’. He replied, ‘There is still time during the day [for repayment]’. The nobleman sneeringly said to him, ‘There has been no rain the whole year, will it rain now?’ The nobleman repaired in a happy mood to the bath-house, while Naḳdimon b.

He said, ‘Lord of the universe! It is revealed and known before Thee that I did not act for my own glory or for the glory of my father’s house, but for Thy glory did I act that the pilgrims should have water to drink’. Immediately the sky became overcast and rain began to fall until the twelve wells were filled to overflowing. He then sent [a message] to that nobleman, ‘Deliver to me the money for the extra water which you have because of me’. He replied, ‘The sun has already set and the rain has fallen in my possession’.

Perform for me a miracle now as Thou didst perform before’. Immediately the wind blew, the clouds dispersed, and the sun shone through. When they met the nobleman said, ‘I know that it was only for your sake that the Holy One, blessed be He, disorganized His world’.<br>Why was Kalba Sabua‘ so named? Because whoever entered his house hungry like a dog came out fed to the full.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kalba means ‘a dog’ and Sabua‘ ‘satiated’.</i><br>When the Emperor Vespasian came to destroy Jerusalem, the zealots sought to burn all his stores with fire. Kalba Sabua‘ said to them, ‘Why do you destroy this city and seek to burn all [my] stores with fire? Wait until I go in and ascertain what I have in the house’. He went in and found that he had enough to supply food for every citizen in Jerusalem for a period of twenty-two years. He immediately gave orders and the produce was stacked and cleaned, ground and sifted, kneaded and baked into bread, so providing a food-supply for every citizen in Jerusalem for twenty-two years. They, however, paid no heed to him. What did the men of Jerusalem do? They took the loaves of bread,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Reading <i>ha’iggulim</i> for <i>ha’agalim</i> with Jastrow, p. 1066b.</i> cut them through with saws and soiled them with mud.

One man was given five dates, and he went down and brought back five heads of the men of Vespasian. When Vespasian examined the excrement of the besieged men and saw that it was without a trace of corn, he remarked to his soldiers, ‘If these men who subsist on straw only can slay so many of you, how many more of you would they slay if they were to eat and drink like you!’"

What does this mean? It teaches that a man’s house should be opened wide to the south, to the east, to the west and to the north, like Job who made four doors to his house. And why did Job make four doors to his house? So that the poor should not have the trouble of going round the entire house. He who came from the north entered straight ahead, and he who came from the south entered straight ahead, and so on all sides. For this reason Job made four doors to his house.<br><small>AND LET THE POOR BE MEMBERS OF YOUR HOUSEHOLD</small>. This does not mean literally that they should be members of your household, but that the poor should be able to talk freely about what they ate and drank in your house, just as the poor talked freely about what they had eaten and drunk in Job’s house. When the poor met, one would ask the other, ‘Whence do you come?’ and he would reply, ‘From Job’s house’. Or one would ask the other, ‘Where are you going?’ and he would reply, ‘To Job’s house’. When the great calamity befell him, he addressed the Holy One, blessed be He, saying, ‘Lord of the universe!

It teaches that a man should love [to foster] peace in Israel between man and man, just as Aaron loved [to foster] peace in Israel between man and man, as it is stated, <i>The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips; he walked with Me in peace and uprightness, and did turn many away from iniquity</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mal. 2, 6.</i> R. Meir said: What is meant by <i>and did turn many away from iniquity?</i> Whenever Aaron walked along the road and met a wicked man, he would offer him greetings. On the following day when that man was about to commit a transgression, he would say, ‘Woe is me! How can I raise my eyes after doing that and look Aaron in the face? I should be ashamed before him, since he greeted me’. Consequently that man withholds himself from transgression.<br>Similarly, when two men had quarrelled one with the other, Aaron would go and sit with one of them and say, ‘My son, see what your companion is doing!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">So according to GRA; V reads ‘saying’.</i> He beats his breast and tears his clothes, exclaiming, “Woe is me! how can I raise my eyes and look my companion in the face? I am ashamed before him since it is I who offended him” ’. Aaron would sit with him until he had removed all enmity from his heart. Then Aaron would go and sit with the other and say likewise, ‘My son, see what your companion is doing! He beats his breast and tears his clothes, exclaiming, “Woe is me! how can I raise my eyes and look my companion in the face? I am ashamed before him since it was I who offended him” ’. Aaron would sit with him until he had removed all enmity from his heart. Later when the two met, they embraced and kissed each other. Therefore it is stated, <i>They wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Num. 20, 29.</i>",
            "Another interpretation—why was it that for Aaron <i>all the house of Israel</i> wept thirty days, i.e. the men as well as the women? Because Aaron judged everyone favourably,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The usual and literal connotation of the phrase is: ‘he judged a judgment of truth according to its truth’, i.e. he dealt out justice strictly and in all its severity. This quality, however, is inapplicable to Aaron in this context where he is described as overlooking faults. In the parallel passage in the Yalḳuṭ on the verse in Num. <i>ibid.</i>, this phrase is descriptive of Moses and not of Aaron; consequently the commentators have resorted to emendation here in order to make the passages correspond (cf. GRA and the Glosses of J. Bachrach). The translation given in the text retains the original reading and is to be interpreted: he regarded every matter in the light of truth, i.e. he considered every person’s action as right (he ‘gave him right’), or at least endeavoured to see justification in every person’s action, taking a favourable view of it. Cf. the expression in Aboth 1:6, ‘Judge all men in the scale of merit’.</i> for he never said to any man or any woman, ‘You have done wrong’. Therefore it is written of him that <i>all the house of Israel</i> wept for him. Of Moses, on the other hand, who rebuked the people with harsh words, it is stated, <i>And all the children of Israel wept for Moses</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 34, 8.</i> Moreover, many thousands in Israel were given the name Aaron, since but for him they would not have come into the world, because he was the peacemaker between husband and wife. When [after being reconciled] they were united, they would name the child who was born after him. [23<i>a</i>]<br>Others say that for this reason it is stated, <i>And they wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel</i>—because who could look upon Moses our teacher sitting and weeping and himself not weep? Others express it in this way: Who could look upon Eleazar and Phinehas,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The son and grandson of Aaron respectively.</i> the two High Priests, standing and weeping and himself not weep?<br>",
            "At that time Moses wished to die in the same manner as Aaron had died; because he saw Aaron’s couch arrayed in great splendour, and hosts of ministering angels lamenting him. Did Moses express this desire in the hearing of another person? No, he only expressed the wish to himself and the Holy One, blessed be He, heard his whisper [and granted his wish,] as it is stated, <i>And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 32, 50.</i> From this you may infer that Moses wished to die the same death as Aaron.<br>At that hour [when Moses was to die], He said to the angel of death, ‘Go and bring Me the soul of Moses’. The angel of death went and stood before him and said, ‘Moses, deliver your soul to me’. Moses rebuked him saying, ‘In the place where I am seated you have not the right to stand,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For Moses was engaged in the study of the Torah, and the angel of death cannot approach one who is so engaged; cf. Shab. 30b (Sonc. ed., p. 134).</i> yet you say to me, “Deliver your soul to me” ’. He rebuked him and drove him away in anger. At length the Holy One, blessed be He, [intervened and] said to Moses, ‘Moses, you have had enough of this world; the world to come awaits you since the six days of creation’, as it is stated, <i>And the Lord said: Behold there is a place by Me, and thou shalt stand upon the rock</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ex. 33, 21.</i> The Holy One, blessed be He, took the soul of Moses and stored it under the Throne of Glory, as it is stated, <i>The soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord thy God</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">1 Sam. 25, 29.</i> When He took his soul it was with a kiss, as it is stated, <i>By the mouth of the Lord</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 34, 5.

To what may this be compared? To a man who took a stone and placed it in a sling; though he hurls it from place to place he knows not where it will come to rest.

            "<small>PURSUING PEACE</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that a man should pursue peace in Israel among all men in the same way that Aaron pursued peace in Israel among all men; as it is stated, <i>Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ps. 34, 15.</i> R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: If a man stays at home in quietude, how can he pursue peace in Israel among all men? He should rather leave his home and go about the world so that he can pursue peace in Israel, as it is stated, <i>Seek peace, and pursue it</i>: meaning <i>seek peace</i> in your own place, <i>and pursue it</i> by going elsewhere.<br>Even the Holy One, blessed be He, made peace on high.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. Job 25, 2.</i> What manner of peace did He make on high? By not naming ten [angels] ‘Gabriel’, ten ‘Michael’, ten ‘Uriel’, or ten ‘Raphael’, after the manner of men who name ten [persons] ‘Reuben’, ten ‘Simeon’, ten ‘Levi’, or ten ‘Judah’. Had He done as men do, on summoning one [angel, all bearing that name] would come before Him and they would be envious of one another. He therefore named one [angel] ‘Gabriel’ and one ‘Michael’, so that when He summons an angel [by name] only one appears before Him and is sent wherever He wishes. And whence do we know that [the angels] reverence one another, respect one another, and are more humble than human beings? When they are about to open their mouths to sing hymns, one says to the other, ‘You begin, for you are greater than I’; and the other replies, ‘No, you begin, for you are greater than I’. This is quite unlike the behaviour of human beings, everyone saying to his fellow, ‘I am greater than you’. According to another view [the courteous remarks are made by] groups of angels, one group saying to the other, ‘You begin, for you are greater than we’; as it is stated, <i>And one called unto another, and said</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Is. 6, 3 where the reference is to groups of seraphim.</i>",
            "<small>LOVING MANKIND</small>. What does this mean?

Since they loved one another,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is inferred from the statement that they were <i>of one language and of one speech</i> (Gen. 11, 1).</i> the Holy One, blessed be He, did not wish to destroy them, but dispersed them to the four corners of the earth.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>ibid.</i> 8.</i> Because the men of Sodom, on the other hand, hated one another, the Holy One, blessed be He, destroyed them from this world and the world to come; as it is stated, <i>The men of Sodom were wicked and sinners against the Lord exceedingly</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>ibid.</i> XIII, 13.</i> [<i>Wicked</i> signifies that they hated one another;]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Inserted by GRA; it is also found in all the parallel passages.</i> <i>sinners</i>, that they offended against morality; <i>against the Lord</i>, that they profaned the Name; <i>exceedingly</i>, that they sinned with premeditation.

            "<small>AND BRINGING THEM NEAR TO THE TORAH</small>. What does this mean?

You have harmed yourself and also the child’. For that illegitimate son may be desirous of studying Torah together with the scholars who sit and study in Jerusalem. He joins their company until they reach Ashdod; there he halts and cries, ‘Woe is me! Had I not been of illegitimate birth, I should now be studying with those who were hitherto my fellow-students; but being illegitimate I may not sit and study with them because an illegitimate is not allowed to enter Jerusalem; as it is stated, <i>And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zech. 9, 6.</i>",

Hillel said to him, ‘Take a seat, and I will tell you something.

He came to Hillel the Elder and said to him, ‘May all the blessings of the Torah alight on your head! Had you been like Shammai the Elder, I would never have entered the assembly of Israel. The impatience of Shammai sought to destroy me out of this world and out of the world to come; your gentleness brought me to life in this world and in the world to come’.

Or when he lays his hand on glowing coals and is burnt, this was caused by none other than the evil inclination which is within his body, since the evil inclination it is that drives him headlong [to destruction]. Observe, however, a kid or lamb: when it sees a well it turns back, since there is no evil inclination in a beast [to lead it into harm].<br>R. Simeon b.

When asked, ‘Who was with you [as an accomplice]?’ he could reply, ‘There was no one with me’; but he says to himself, ‘Since I am to be executed, let my fellow be executed along with me’. In the same way the evil inclination speaks, ‘Since I am doomed in the world to come, I will drag the entire body with me to destruction’.<br>R. Simeon b.

Go forth and be mindful of the honour of your fellow-man, and when you pray know before Whom you are standing and praying. Then will you merit the life of the world to come’.<br>R. Eleazar said: Five things did we learn from R. Eliezer [on that day], and they afforded us greater pleasure than all that we had enjoyed from him in his lifetime, and they are as follows: If a round cushion, a ball, a shoemaker’s last, an amulet or a phylactery, about which you spoke to us, were torn, what would be the law?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The five articles enumerated have in common that they are made of leather and are permanently filled with stuffing. It is established law that an article of leather can contract defilement only if it is a receptacle, i.e. it has a cavity in which it can hold things. Since the articles here listed are <i>permanently</i> filled, the Sage held the view that they are not considered to be vessels with receptacles and consequently cannot be ritually defiled. R. Eliezer, however, was of the opinion that since the filling was removable, they were to be considered vessels with receptacles and could contract defilement. Furthermore, if any one of the enumerated articles were torn the opinion was unanimous that it could contract defilement, because some of the filling must have fallen out and in consequence a receptacle was formed. If, in the circumstances stated, the article became unclean, there was a further argument between R. Eliezer and the Sages whether it was necessary to remove <i>all</i> the filling before immersion took place. The Sages held the view that this must be done otherwise the immersion would be invalid, since the filling interposed between the vessel and the water. R. Eliezer, on the other hand, ruled that it could be immersed as it was without the removal of the filling. R. Eliezer here put forward his views as ancient traditional rulings. Cf. Kel. XXIII, 1 (Sonc. ed., p. 110).</i> The answer he gave was: They can contract uncleanness so be careful with them; and [if unclean] they may be immersed as they are.

Before the decree has been sealed; but once the decree has been sealed, both impulses bear equal responsibility for sin.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The intention of this passage is obscure. Perhaps the meaning is: because the evil impulse enters man at birth (Gen. 8, 21) and the nature of man is prone to fall under its sway (<i>ibid.</i> VI, 5), God will not judge it on the same footing as the good impulse, but make allowance for human frailty. Once man has been sentenced at the seat of judgment, both impulses are on equal footing as regards responsibility for sin.

            "In ten places in the Torah [certain words or letters] have dots over them:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On the whole passage, cf. the parallels in Sifrë on Num. 9, 10, Midrash Rabbah, Numbers, III, 13 (Sonc. ed., pp. 91ff) and Soferim VI, below pp. 238; also L. Blau, <i>Masoretische Untersuchungen</i>. Among the many theories put forward in explanation of these dots two may be mentioned: (<i>i</i>) they were intended to call attention to important homiletical teachings which the early Rabbis had connected with the dotted words; (<i>ii</i>) they indicate that the words or letters are doubtful and are to be deleted.

In the parallel passages, Mekilta, <i>Mishpaṭim, Neziḳin</i> XVIII, Semaḥoth VIII, below p. 365, and II ARN XLI, R. Ishmael suggests that his sad fate might be attributed to his having delayed justice. It is on this score that the story finds its place here. The passage to be inserted reads: ‘Did a woman ever come to you to ask about her monthly impurity, or a man about his vow, and they were kept waiting, because you were asleep or having a meal, or perhaps you had no free time, or perhaps the attendant would not allow them to enter?’</i> ‘Perhaps when you were sitting down to a meal, poor persons came and stood at your door, and you did not allow them to enter and eat with you’. Rabban Simeon replied, ‘I swear by Heaven that I never did so; but I set watchers who sat at the door, and when poor persons came they brought them to me and they ate and drank with me, and blessed Heaven’s name’. Then R. Ishmael said, ‘Perhaps when you were sitting and expounding [the Torah] on the Temple mount, and all the multitudes of Israel were sitting before you, your mind was puffed up’. Rabban Simeon answered, ‘Ishmael, my brother, a man must be prepared to accept his fate’.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reason suggested—his elation and pride at the sight of men standing and listening to his teaching—apparently accounted for his fate, and Rabban Simeon acknowledged God’s justice.</i> They both pleaded with the executioner; one said, ‘I am a priest, son of a High Priest; put me to death first so that I do not witness the death of my colleague’. The other said, ‘I am a prince, the son of a prince; put me to death first so that I do not witness the death of my colleague’. The executioner said, ‘Draw lots’. They did so, and the lot fell upon Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel. The executioner took the sword and cut off his head. R. Ishmael b.

But the man answered, ‘I will not forgive you until you say to the Craftsman Who made me, “How ugly is the vessel which Thou hast made!” ’ R. Simeon ran after him for three miles [until he reached his town]. When the people of the town came out to meet him, greeting him with the words, ‘Peace be unto you, Master’, the man asked them, ‘Whom do you address as Master?’ They replied, ‘Him who follows you’.

They said to him, ‘Nevertheless, forgive him’. The man replied, ‘I will forgive him, but on condition that he will never again act in this manner’. That same day R. Simeon entered his great House of Study and lectured: At all times a man should be pliant as a reed and not hard like a cedar. Now what is the feature of the reed?
