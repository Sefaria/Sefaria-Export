            "The hand-<i>tefillah</i> is put on the upper part of the hand<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The biceps, and not on the palm of the hand.</i> [because Scripture declares, <i>And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thy hand</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ex. 13, 9.</i> which means that the sign shall be for thee<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Where only he who wears the <i>tefillah</i> can see it, i.e. on the biceps covered by the sleeve.</i> but not for others<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Had the <i>tefillah</i> been put on the palm of the hand it would be visible to all.</i>]. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The part enclosed in square brackets is based on Men. 37b (Sonc. ed., p. 229).</i>So also [the Scriptural expression] <i>between thine eyes</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ex. 13, 9.</i> [implies] the upper part of the head, [because] <i>upon thy hand</i> and <i>between thine eyes</i> [occur in juxtaposition we infer]: as <i>upon thy hand</i> [means] on the upper part of the hand, so <i>between thine eyes</i> [means] on the upper part of the head. This is according to R. Eliezer b. Jacob; R. Judah says: It is stated <i>upon thy hand</i> and it is also stated [in the same verse] <i>between thine eyes</i> [the inference being that] as <i>upon thy hand</i> [refers to] a place that is susceptible of ritual uncleanness by one [symptom of] leprosy,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The biceps, like any other part of the body that is free from hair, is declared ritually unclean by one symptom only, viz. white hair in the leprous spot.</i> so also <i>between thine eyes</i> [refers to] a place that is susceptible of ritual uncleanness by one [symptom of] leprosy.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Viz. the upper part of the head, whose symptom of uncleanness is yellow hair in the leprous spot. The region between the eyes, however, where both hair and clean flesh are to be found, can be declared unclean by either of the two symptoms (yellow or white hair) and must therefore be ruled out.</i> [Another reason:] It is stated <i>between thine eyes</i> and it is also stated, <i>Nor make any baldness between your eyes:</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 14, 1.</i> as baldness occurs where there is hair [on the head] so you must put the <i>tefillah</i> only where there is hair [on the hand].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since both verses contain the expression <i>between … eyes</i>.</i> It is stated, <i>And thou shalt write them</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Referring to the <i>mezuzah</i> (Deut. 6, 9).</i> and it is also stated [in juxtaposition] <i>and thou shalt bind them;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>tefillin</i> (<i>ibid.</i> 8).</i> [hence the inference that] the hand that writes [the <i>mezuzah</i>]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e. the right hand, with which most people write.</i> is the hand that binds [the <i>tefillah</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The hand-<i>tefillah</i> is therefore put on the left hand.</i>",

If a man rises early to go on a journey, he should not put them on before the time [for the performance] of the commandment; but if he had put them on before [the proper time for the performance of] the commandment, he should place his hand upon them at the time [for the performance] of the commandment<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">At dawn.</i> and say the benedictions.",
