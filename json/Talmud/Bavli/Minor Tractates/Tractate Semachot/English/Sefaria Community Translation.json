                "The man at the end of his life is needs the same as every living thing in the world. He may be required to take part in yibbum, and he may release himself from the obligation. If a limb is severed from his body, it is a limb from a living person; and his flesh like that of a living person. And the blood of his sin offering may be sprinkled on his behalf until he dies.",
                "No knot may be tied round his jaw. And his extremities may not be blocked. And they may not place a cool metal tool on his naval till his death as it is said: \"till the silver cord snaps And the golden bowl crashes, The jar is shattered at the spring, And the jug is smashed at the cistern.\" (Ecclesiastes 12:6)",
                "He may not be moved and he may not be be placed on sand and on salt till he has died. ",
                "His eyes may not be closed. And if he is stirred it is as if he has shed his blood. Rav Meir says he is like a candle which drips when it is touched. So too with a man whose life departs when his eyes are closed.",
                "And you shall not rip your clothing. And you may not bare [your shoulder], and do not bring a coffin into the home until he dies."
