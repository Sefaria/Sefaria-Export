[For it is stated, <i>And she be not seized</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Num. 5, 13, E.V. <i>neither she be taken in the act.</i> The phrase is interpreted by the Rabbis in the sense that she did not act under compulsion but willingly, referring to a married woman who was defiled secretly without witnesses to testify against her.</i>—[only then] is she forbidden; if, however, she was <i>seized</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e. violated by force.</i> she is permitted. There is another class of woman who is forbidden [to her husband] even though she had been <i>seized;</i> and who is that?

There is another class of woman who is permitted [to her husband] even if she had not been <i>seized;</i> and who is that? A woman whose betrothal was mistaken.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If, e.g., a condition were attached to the betrothal that remained unfulfilled. In such a case the woman may leave her husband without a <i>geṭ</i>, and in any subsequent intercourse, whether forced or willing, her status is that of an unmarried woman who had never been previously married. The passage within brackets is added by GRA and is necessary, otherwise R. Ishmael would be contradicting himself. Cf. Yeb. 100b (Sonc. ed., p. 692), Keth. <i>loc. cit.</i></i>]<br>If a divorcee who became betrothed was seduced, whether under force or of her free will, she is forbidden to return to her former husband.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If her second husband subsequently died or divorced her. She is, however, permitted to remarry her former husband after betrothal alone, where no marriage with the second man took place and he died.</i> This is the opinion of R. Jose b. Ḳippar in the name of R. Eleazar b. Shammua‘. This is the reasoning by which R. Jose b. Ḳippar expounded his view:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the reading of GRA as against V and H, who name R.

This is the reading of GRA. V and H have ‘the wife of a <i>kohen’</i>.</i> whether under compulsion or of her free will she is forbidden to return to her former husband.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">So GRA. V and H ‘to him’.</i>",

The requirement of a divorce in these cases is only a preventive measure against the possibility of assuming that the second marriage was legal, and hence inferring that a married woman may leave her husband to marry another without a <i>geṭ</i>.</i> and a married woman,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Whose husband was reported by one witness to be dead and she remarried with the sanction of a <i>Beth Din</i> who accepted the evidence, and later the husband returned. In such a case the woman requires a divorce from her second husband as a preventive measure against the possibility of assuming that the first had divorced her and the second had married her legally, and consequently a married woman may leave her husband without a <i>geṭ.</i> Cf.

            "The following exposition was given by R. Ḥanina b. Uri before [a gathering of] the Sages in the name of R. Nathan: Anyone who is included in the category <i>Shall not enter</i> [<i>into the assembly of the Lord</i>]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 23, 2-4.</i> disqualifies a woman by his cohabitation<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">From marrying a <i>kohen</i> or from eating <i>terumah</i> if she was the daughter of a <i>kohen.</i> Cf.

Dosethai b. Judah in Ḳid. 77a (Sonc. ed., p. 395), who maintained that as the sons of Israel are a <i>miḳweh</i> of purification for <i>ḥalaloth</i>, so are the daughters a <i>miḳweh</i> of purification for <i>ḥalalim</i>, so that their issue is eligible for the priesthood. The Mishnah (<i>ibid.</i>) states: The daughter of a <i>ḥalal</i> is unfit to the priesthood for all time.</i>",
            "If a man had intercourse with any of the women prohibited to him as forbidden relatives, he is still permitted to marry her near relatives.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Only relatives of a married wife are subject to the law of incest.</i> [For instance,] he who had intercourse with a married woman is permitted to marry her daughter.",
            "This is the question which R. Jose b. Taddai of Tiberias put to Rabban Gamaliel: If I, who may cohabit with my wife, am prohibited from marrying her daughter, how much more should I be prohibited from marrying the daughter of a married woman, seeing that I am prohibited from cohabiting with her!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The purpose of this <i>a fortiori</i> argument is to point out that one should not be allowed to marry anyone except the daughter of a widow or of a divorcee, because these are no longer a man’s wife.</i> He replied to him: Go and provide me [a wife] for the High Priest of whom it is written, <i>A virgin of his own people shall he take to wife</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lev. 21, 14.</i> and I will provide you [with wives] for Israel.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since a High Priest may not marry a widow or a divorcee, their daughters also ought to be prohibited according to R. Jose’s argument, and this would be contrary to the Scriptural text. Hence the reasoning must be fallacious. The premise is false, viz. that he is permitted to cohabit with his wife who was the daughter of a married woman.</i> Another explanation<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Yalḳuṭ omits the words ‘another explanation’.</i> [in refutation of the reasoning is that] we do not use an <i>a fortiori</i> argument to abrogate a specific law of Scripture.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is explicitly stated, <i>He shall take to wife</i>, but if we adopt R. Jose’s argument, a High Priest could never marry.</i> Rabban Gamaliel excommunicated him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Yalḳuṭ omits this sentence.</i>",
            "If a man cohabits with any woman forbidden him as incest, he does not thereby disqualify her from marrying a <i>kohen</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. Yeb. 61b (Sonc. ed., p. 409) where R. ‘Aḳiba maintains that the term <i>harlot</i> forbidden to a <i>kohen</i> applies only to one who is in fact a prostitute. GRA omits ‘not’. Higger quotes the suggestion of Prof. L. Ginzberg that there is a scribal error through dittography and the text should read: ‘Not only is the child a bastard but he even disqualifies her from marrying a <i>kohen’</i>.</i> [If a <i>kohen</i> cohabits with his wife when she is] <i>niddah</i>, although he is liable to a penalty for the intercourse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf.

R. Jose said: It once happened at Haitali<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Babylonian form of Aitalu, the modern Aiterun, N.W. of Ḳadesh; cf. S.

            "The following are the forbidden relatives in the second degree: his father’s mother, his mother’s mother,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Bible only prohibits a man’s mother and the Rabbis extended the prohibition to his mother’s mother on account of his mother.
