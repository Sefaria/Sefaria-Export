            "A bride<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here used in the sense of a betrothed girl. In the Talmudic period betrothal (<i>’erusin</i>) and marriage (<i>ḳiddushin</i>) denoted two stages different from what they are now. <i>’Erusin</i> took place in the bride’s home and <i>ḳiddushin</i> subsequently in the bridegroom’s home. It is important to note that the ceremony of <i>’erusin</i> was binding upon the bridal couple and could not be dissolved without a bill of divorce. Later the current custom prevailed whereby the two ceremonies were combined and performed at the same time (cf. P.B., pp. 298f., the benediction on the first of the pages being of <i>’erusin</i>).</i> is forbidden to her husband without the [marriage] benediction<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This consisted of seven benedictions. For the wording cf. K.R. I, 1, below p. 415f.; Keth. 7b-8a (Sonc. ed., pp. 31ff.); P.B., p. 299.</i> in the same manner as a <i>niddah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Biblical law the period of menstrual impurity lasted seven days (Lev. 15, 19ff.) but was extended by the Rabbis to eleven days. At the end of the period immersion in a ritual bath was necessary.</i> Just as a <i>niddah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Whose period of purification has ended.</i> who has not immersed [in the ritual bath] is forbidden to her husband, so likewise is a bride forbidden to her husband without the [marriage] benediction. Whence is the benediction of bridegrooms derived from the Torah? As it is stated, <i>And they blessed Rebekah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gen. 24, 60.</i> And whence do we derive that even a widow is so forbidden?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On remarriage without the benediction, cf. Keth. 7a (Sonc. ed., p. 26).</i> As it is stated, <i>And he took ten men of the elders of the city … And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders said, We are witnesses. The Lord make the woman … and let thy house be like the house of Perez</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ruth 4, 2, 11f.</i>",
            "After the consummation of her marriage on the first day, a bride is forbidden<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To her husband; cf. Nid. 65b (Sonc. ed., p. 460).</i> for the whole of the succeeding seven days, and it is not permitted to take any object<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">lit. ‘a cup’.</i> from her hand all the seven days. This is the view of R. Eliezer, but R. Joshua said: Not until the matter is examined—if she was <i>niddah</i> while still in her father’s house, she is forbidden [to her husband], but if not she is allowed to him.<br>R. Eliezer was asked, ‘Is it permissible to drink from the hand of the bride so long as her husband is sitting with her at the festive table?’ He replied, ‘Whoever drinks from the hand of a bride is as though he drinks from the hand of a harlot’. [His colleagues] said to him, ‘Are not all the daughters of Israel possessed of good manners?’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And it is therefore usual for a bride to hand things to the guests.</i> He answered, ‘God forbid! Anyone who is not familiar with the Torah<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And since women are not usually learned in the Torah it cannot be assumed that they possess good manners.</i> cannot be possessed of good manners’. R. Eleazar b. Azariah made a public declaration accompanied by the sounding of three hundred <i>shofars</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In K.R. I, 5, below p. 418 the reading is ‘four hundred <i>shofars</i>’. These were sounded to increase the solemnity of the declaration.</i> ‘Whether a bride be of the daughters of a scholar or of an <i>‘am ha-’areẓ</i>, he who drinks from her hand is as though he drinks from the hand of a harlot’. He further said, ‘Whoever takes a cup from the hand of a bride and drinks from it has no share in the World to Come’.",
            "He who recites a verse from the Song of Songs<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. Sanh. 101a (Sonc. ed., p. 684). GRA reads ‘evil’ instead of ‘Flood’.</i> rendering it as a [secular] song, and similarly whoever recites a verse from the Torah unseasonably at banqueting tables, causes the Flood to come upon the world; because the Torah clothes itself in sackcloth, stands before the Holy One, blessed be He, and complains, ‘Sovereign of the universe! Thy children have made me as a harp upon which scorners play’. To this He replies, ‘My daughter, when they rejoice what should they do?’ She makes the rejoinder, ‘Sovereign of the universe! If he is a scholar let him occupy himself with the Torah, with study and good deeds and <i>’aggadoth;</i> let students of Scripture occupy themselves with Scripture, students of Midrash and Mishnah with the laws of Passover on Passover, the laws of Pentecost on Pentecost and the laws of Tabernacles on Tabernacles’. R. Simeon<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">GRA adds ‘b. Eleazar in the name of R. Joshua b. Ḥananiah’.</i> testified and said: Whoever reads a verse in season brings good to the world, as it is stated, <i>And a word in due season, how good is it!</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Prov. 15, 23.</i>",
            "One who sends the cup of benediction<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Used in the Grace after meals.</i> to a woman without the knowledge of her husband forfeits his life because his mind prevailed over him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">lit. ‘is great over him’. GRA emends: ‘over him’ to ‘over her’, i.e. he is attracted to her. Similarly in the next sentences.</i> Rabbi [Judah the Prince] said: Because the evil inclination has prevailed over him. Similarly the members of a company who send the cup of benediction to a woman without the knowledge of her husband forfeit their lives because their minds prevailed over them. Rabbi [Judah the Prince] said: Because the evil inclination has prevailed over them."

R. ‘Aḳiba took the money and distributed it among the poor. Later R. Ṭarfon met him and asked, ‘Where are the cities which you purchased for me?’ [R. ‘Aḳiba] took him by the hand and led him to the House of Study. He produced a Book of Psalms and placed it in front of them both. They went on reading until they came to the verse, <i>He hath scattered abroad</i>, etc., and then he exclaimed, ‘This is the city which I bought for you’. Thereupon R.

He then asked him, ‘Why has the fire gone low?’ He replied, ‘I adjured it in the name of my Creator that it should not touch me until I know whether it was so decreed against me in Heaven.
