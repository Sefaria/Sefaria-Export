I and II are repeated from tractate <i>Kallah</i>, correspondence with which is indicated in the notes. The commentary on that tractate is not reproduced here and should be referred to.<br>K (Kallah) 1.</i> A bride is forbidden to her husband without the [marriage] benediction in the same manner as a <i>niddah</i> who has not immersed; just as a <i>niddah</i> who has not immersed is forbidden to her husband, so likewise is a bride forbidden to her husband without the [marriage] benediction.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. Raba said: Of which benediction do [the Sages] speak? The benediction [consisting of] seven [blessings] and not the benediction of betrothal. Which is the benediction of betrothal? R. Judah said in the name of Rab:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. Keth. 7b (Sonc. ed., p. 30); P.B., p. 298.</i> ‘[Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe,] Who hast sanctified us by Thy commandments, and hast commanded us concerning forbidden relations and hast forbidden us unto the betrothed and hast allowed us unto the wedded by the rite of the [marriage] canopy and sanctification. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who sanctified Israel by the rite of the canopy and sanctification’.<br>In what order are the [seven] blessings recited? R. Levi said: ‘Who created the fruit of the vine’, and ‘Who hast created all things to Thy glory’. ‘Blessed art Thou the Creator of man.’ ‘Blessed art Thou Who hast made man in Thine image, after Thy likeness, and hast prepared unto him, out of his very self, a fabric for ever. Blessed art Thou, Creator of man.’ ‘May [Zion] who was barren be exceeding glad and exult, when her children are gathered within her in joy. Blessed art Thou Who makest Zion joyful through her children.’ ‘O make these loved companions greatly to rejoice, even as of old Thou didst gladden Thy creature in the Garden of Eden. Blessed art Thou Who makest bridegroom and bride to rejoice.’ ‘Blessed art Thou Who hast created joy and gladness, bridegroom and bride, mirth, pleasure, exultation, love, brotherhood, peace and fellowship. Soon may there be heard in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of joy and gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the jubilant voice of bridegrooms from their canopies, and of youths from their feasts of song. Blessed art Thou Who makest the bridegroom to rejoice with the bride.’<br>An objection was raised: [It is stated,] <i>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ex. 20, 7; Deut. 5, 11.</i> To what does this refer? For instance, to one who recites a benediction unnecessarily; but here he recites the benediction, ‘Who created the fruit of the vine’! So how may he do it? He tastes of [the wine].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The act of tasting the wine makes the benediction necessary.</i> But the master has said: If he tasted it, he disqualifies it!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Another benediction cannot be made over that cup until more wine is added; cf. Ber. 52a (Sonc. ed., p. 314).</i> He pours [some wine] from the cup into his hand and drinks it. This is possible when wine is available, but what if no wine is available? Over what may he recite the benediction? Over beer. May [one recite it] over [the juice of] the date-berry?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">V has a word which is unknown; it may be a corruption of <i>kufra</i>, ‘the date-berry’.</i> [If there is no wine] it must be over water or bread.<br>The question was asked: If one recited all the [seven] benedictions out of their proper sequence, or if he omitted one of them, what is the law? Come and hear: Benedictions do not invalidate one another.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the order is changed; cf. Ber. 11b (Sonc. ed., p. 66).</i> Levi was present at a wedding feast and recited six<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Keth. 8a (Sonc. ed., p. 33) the number is given as ‘five’.</i> [benedictions]; deduce from this that although one is omitted we are not concerned. Perhaps there the case was different because [Levi held the view that] there was one formation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That the creation of men and women is alluded to in the third benediction, and the second is unnecessary as a separate benediction for the creation of man.</i>",
            "<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">K 1.</i> And whence is the benediction of bridegrooms derived from the Torah? As it is stated, <i>And they blessed Rebekah</i>.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. Did they, then, bless her over a cup [of wine]? This is but a support [and not a proof for the necessity of a benediction]. R. Joḥanan said: It is derived from the verse, <i>And God blessed them</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gen. 1, 28.</i> But how will he explain that concerning [other] living creatures it is also written, <i>And God blessed them?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>ibid.</i> 22.</i> But [the benediction is required] because it is written, <i>And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from the man, made He</i> [<i>banah</i>]<i> a woman;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>ibid.</i> II, 22.</i> for in the coast towns they call plaits <i>binyatha</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">[Cf. ARN IV, 3, above p. 36.] Adam and Eve are in a different category in that God plaited Eve’s hair and brought her adorned to Adam.</i>",
            "<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">K 1.</i> And whence do we derive that even a widow requires the benedictions? As it is stated, <i>And he took ten men</i> … and it is further written, <i>And all the people that were in the gate and the elders said, We are witnesses … the Lord make</i>, etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Boaz was a widower and Ruth a widow.</i><br><small>GEMARA</small>. Deduce from this that the benediction of bridegrooms needs [the presence of] ten persons, and also infer that we recite the benediction even in the case of a widower who marries a widow. An objection was raised: In which cases do we recite the benediction? When a bachelor marries a spinster, or a bachelor marries a widow, or a widower marries a spinster; but not in a marriage between a widower and a widow! There [the recital of the benediction] is during the seven days.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When a widower marries a widow the benedictions are recited on the first day only, but in other cases all the seven days of the marriage feast; cf. Keth. 7b (Sonc. ed., p. 31).</i>",
            "<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">K 2.</i> After the consummation of her marriage on the first day, a bride is forbidden to her husband for the whole of the succeeding seven days. This is the view of R. Eliezer. R. Joshua said: Not until the matter is examined; if she was <i>niddah</i> while still in her father’s house she is forbidden [to him], but if not she is allowed [to him].<br><small>GEMARA</small>. Wherein do they<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Eliezer and R. Joshua.</i> dispute? R. Eliezer adheres to his view [that she is forbidden] lest she was losing blood but was unaware of it. R. Joshua adheres to his view that it is possible for the matter to be examined. And how long [is she forbidden]? R. Joshua said: For three days.",
            "<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">K 3.</i> R. Eliezer was asked, ‘Is it permissible to drink from [the hand of] the bride so long as her husband is sitting with her at the festive table?’ He replied, ‘Whoever drinks from [the hand of] the bride is as though he drank from the hand of a harlot’. [His colleagues] said to him, ‘Are not the daughters of Israel possessed of good manners?’ He answered, ‘God forbid! Anyone who is not familiar with the Torah cannot be possessed of good manners’. R. Eleazar b. Azariah made a public proclamation accompanied by the sounding of four hundred <i>shofars</i>, ‘He who receives a cup from the bride will never be pardoned’.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. Wherein do they<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Eliezer and the Sages opposed to him.</i> dispute? The Sages are of the opinion that since she is the daughter of a scholar she continues the customs of her father;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And would disregard any improper advances made to her.</i> whereas R. Eliezer maintains that a woman follows in the ways of her husband.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And can be easily misled.</i><br>The story<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. ‘A.Z. 39a (Sonc. ed., p. 193).</i> is told of a woman, married to a scholar, that she used to bind the <i>tefillin</i> around his arm. The scholar died and she married a tax-collector and used to attach the tax-seals for him. R. Eleazar b. Azariah made a public proclamation. ‘Infer from this that thinking a thing is like doing it’. [And should you say that it is not so,] why do we then take the stricter view and declare that he<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">viz. one who receives a cup of wine from the hand of the bride, and there it can only be a case of impure thought and not of improper action.</i> will never be pardoned? I will answer you, ‘ “Thinking” is not like “doing”, since it is written, <i>If I had regarded iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not hear!</i>’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ps. 66, 18.</i> [Thinking in connection with] a married woman is different because it is much stricter.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It may lead to a grave moral lapse.</i><br>Raba expounded: What is the meaning of the verse, <i>Good and upright is the Lord; therefore doth He instruct sinners in the way?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>ibid.</i> XXV, 9.</i> Come and see the righteousness of the Holy One, blessed be He. Whoever has the intention to perform a precept but under duress fails to perform it, Scripture accounts it to him as though he had fulfilled it;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. Ḳid. 40a (Sonc. ed., p. 196).</i> and whoever has the intention to commit a sin is not regarded as guilty until the time of its commission; as it is written, <i>If I had regarded iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not hear</i>.",
            "<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">K 4.</i> He who recites a verse from the Song of Songs rendering it as a [secular] song, and similarly whoever recites a verse from the Torah unseasonably brings evil upon the world; because the Torah clothes itself in sackcloth, stands before the Holy One, blessed be He, and complains, ‘Sovereign of the universe! Thy children have made me as a harp upon which the nations [of the world] play’. To this He replies, ‘My daughter, when they rejoice what should they do?’ She makes rejoinder, ‘Let them occupy themselves with the study of the Torah, the Mishnah, <i>halakoth</i> and <i>’aggadoth;</i> and if they be unlearned let them occupy themselves with the laws of Passover on Passover, the laws of Pentecost on Pentecost and the laws of Tabernacles on Tabernacles’. R. Simeon b. Eleazar testified in the name of R. Joshua b. Ḥananiah: Whoever reads a verse in season brings good to the world.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. How can it be like a [secular] song? For instance, he chants [the text] but his mind is on [sinful] thoughts, and the verse which he recites from the Torah unseasonably is like reciting from Lamentations. Raba said: A verse [recited] in season is like bread in time of hunger, and out of season is like bread in time of plenty.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One derives no enjoyment from it as one does in a time of scarcity.</i>",
            "<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">K 5.</i> One who sends the cup of benediction to a woman without her husband’s knowledge forfeits his life because his mind has prevailed over him. Rabbi [Judah the Prince] said: Because the evil inclination has prevailed over him.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. Raba said: Why is the word for ‘woman’ <i>’ishshah?</i> Because she is fire [<i>’esh</i>]; and [why is the word for ‘man’] <i>’ish?</i> Because he is fire. The letters <i>yod</i> from <i>’ish</i> and <i>he</i> from <i>’ishshah</i> form the Divine Name [<i>Yah</i>] which is conferred upon them. If they both become overheated [from sexual excitement] the Divine Name departs from them and they are [only] fire and fire.",
            "<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">K 5.</i> Similarly the members of a company who send the cup of benediction to a woman without the knowledge of her husband forfeit their lives because their minds prevailed over them. Rabbi [Judah the Prince] said: Because the evil inclination has prevailed over them.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. What need is there to state ‘similarly the members of a company’? One might [erroneously] have thought that only an individual is forbidden but not a company; therefore it teaches us that since it is done without her husband’s knowledge any dissolute person [in the company] may have been inflamed because of her.",
            "<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">K 6.</i> He who pays money to a woman, counting it from his hand into her hand in order to gaze at her, even if he be great like Moses, who received the Torah from Sinai, will not be free from the penalty of Gehinnom; as it is stated, <i>Hand to hand, the evil man shall not be unpunished</i>.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. Since [sending a cup of wine to a woman] is prohibited, what is the necessity for [a separate regulation about counting] money? With the former it is forbidden if done without the husband’s knowledge; but with the latter it is forbidden even if done with the husband’s knowledge. Alternatively, with the former it is forbidden in the case of one who is not [suspected] of evil thoughts, but with the latter it is forbidden in the case of one who is [suspected] of evil thoughts. It has been taught: The same [rule applies] if one bride sends gifts from her festive table to another bride.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The text is doubtful and H conjectures the reading <i>lehakkallah lifnë ba‘alah</i>, ‘to another bride in her husband’s presence’. Here, too, there may be an evil intention.</i>",
            "<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">K 7.</i> Behold Scripture declares, <i>And we have brought the Lord’s offering … armlets and bracelets, signet rings, ear-rings and girdles to make atonement for our souls before the Lord. ’Eẓadah</i> [armlets] means a garter; <i>ẓamid</i> [bracelets] silk cloaks; <i>‘agil</i> [ear-rings] a cast of the female breasts and <i>kumaz</i> [girdles] a cast of the womb. For what purpose [are the words added], <i>to make atonement for our souls before the Lord?</i> Moses said, ‘Perhaps you have returned to your former sinful lapse’. They replied to him, ‘<i>There lacketh not one man of us</i>’. ‘If so’, he retorted, ‘why this atonement?’ They answered, ‘We have escaped sin but we have not escaped sinful thoughts’. Hence the Rabbis declared: Whoever touches a woman’s little finger is as though he touched ‘that place’.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. When [the Israelites] came to him,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">During the war against Midian.</i> Moses said to them, <i>Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Num. 31, 17.</i> How would they know [the latter]? Rab said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf.

            "<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">K 8.</i> Whoever gazes upon a woman’s heel will have children deformed from birth. Why [are children born] lame, blind, dumb or deaf? R. Eliezer said: Because [the husband] claimed marital rights but she refused. R. Joshua said: Because she declared at the time of cohabitation, ‘I have been forced’. R. ‘Aḳiba said: Because they talk in causeless hatred.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. Raba said: They made this statement [even] of one’s wife. [His colleagues] remarked, ‘[In that case] you do not allow people an opportunity to carry on life!’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Owing to the strictness of the regulations on cohabitation.</i> [He replied,] ‘But [the regulations on] cohabitation are as just stated, and [the deformed child] is conceived from such intercourse’.<br>‘R.

            "<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">K 8.</i> R. Nehemiah said: Because of the sin of causeless hatred a man’s wife suffers miscarriage, his children die young, and contention is rife in his house.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. It is quite reasonable [to say] that causeless hatred brings about strife, as it is written, <i>Hatred stirreth up strifes;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Prov. 10, 12.</i> but whence do we learn [that it causes] miscarriage? As it is written, <i>In vain have I smitten your children</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jer. 2, 30.</i> [<i>in vain</i> meaning] for causeless strifes.",
            "<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">K 9.</i> R. Joḥanan b. Dahabai said: The Ministering Angels told me four things, viz.: Why [are children born] lame? Because [their parents] overturned their tables. Why [are children born] blind? Because [their parents] gazed at ‘that place’. Why [are children born] dumb? Because [their parents] kiss ‘that place’. Why [are children born] deaf? Because [their parents] converse during cohabitation.<br><small>GEMARA</small>.

            "<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">K 9.</i> The Sages say that the <i>halakah</i> is not in agreement with R. Joḥanan b. Dahabai; but a man may do with his wife as he desires, because the matter can be best compared to a man who purchased meat from the butcher; if he wishes he eats it roasted on coals, if he wishes he eats it salted. The matter may also be compared to fish bought from fishermen: if [the purchaser] wishes he eats it preserved in salt, if he wishes he eats it roasted, if he wishes he eats it grilled on coal.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. Since R. Joḥanan b. Dahabai did not make the statement on his own account [but quoted it in the name of the Ministering Angels], why did not the Rabbis agree with him? R.

Eliezer and sister of Rabban Gamaliel, was asked, ‘Why are your children beautiful? And during intercourse how does [your husband] conduct himself towards you?’ She replied, ‘He does not converse with me during the first or last watch of the night, but only during the middle watch; [and when he cohabits] he uncovers a handbreadth and covers a handbreadth, and is as though he were urged on by a demon. And when I questioned him, “What is the reason for all this?” he replied, “So that another woman should not come to my mind and my children consequently come within the category of bastards” ’.<br><small>GEMARA</small>.

Giṭ. 62a (Sonc. ed., p. 292).</i> Seeing that [the answer] is evident, why was the question asked? The question asked was, Is it permissible to salute them first?

By greeting him first, he avoids the need for further greetings.</i><br>The question was asked: Is it permissible to greet a murderer, adulterer or those who are liable to <i>kareth?</i> As for returning their greetings there is no question [that it is permissible], since they were the first to greet you their salutation must be returned. But how is it with greeting them first? Come and hear: [It is written,] <i>The way of peace they know not, and there is no right in their goings; they have made them crooked paths, whosoever goeth therein doth not know peace</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isa. 59, 8. L. Ginzberg suggested that the author found in the words <i>the way of peace they know not</i> an allusion to murderers and in <i>they made them crooked paths</i> to violent men who escape punishment through superior force (Higger).</i> Hence it can be inferred that if greetings are given by those who are about to suffer the death penalty they may be returned, but not of those who save themselves [from punishment] by force. And as for greeting them first, it is prohibited in all cases. As for an adulterer and his friends, should they greet one in public their salutation is returned out of respect for the public. Some say that he who associates with an adulterer is like an adulterer.

Mahalalel.</i> Whoever keeps four things before his eyes will never sin again, viz. whence he came, whither he goes, what will become of him, and Who will be his Judge. Whence he came: from a putrefying secretion, from a place which the eye cannot see. And whither he goes: to a place of darkness and deep gloom. And what will become of him: worms and maggots. And Who will be his Judge: the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He. R. Simeon said: He came from a place of defilement, he came from a place of uncleanness and is destined to defile others. He came from a putrefying secretion and goes to a place of worms and maggots, as it is stated, <i>How much less man, that is worm! and the son of man, that is a maggot!</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 25, 6.</i> R. Eliezer b. Jacob said: <i>Man</i>, that is maggot in his lifetime, alluding to vermin; <i>and the son of man</i>, that is worm in his death. R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: Man is beautiful and splendid, but he brings forth from his inwards something that the eye cannot [bear to] see. To what can this be compared? To a human king who built a large, beautiful and magnificent palace through which a stream of water from a tannery flowed. Every passer-by exclaimed, ‘How beautiful would this palace be but for the stream from the tannery flowing through it!’ So it is with man who resembles [that palace]. Even when he brings forth from his inwards something disgusting which the eye cannot [bear to] see he prides himself before the All-present.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">H adds: ‘So if he produced sweet odours and precious oil, how much more would he pride himself over creatures!’ [Cf.

            "When R. Eliezer was dying, his disciples came and sat down before him and said to him, ‘Our teacher, teach us a law’. He replied, ‘What shall I teach you? Go forth and be mindful of each other’s honour; and when you pray know before Whom you stand, for through this you will enter into the life of the World to Come’. R. Eleazar b. Azariah said: Five things did R. Eleazar teach us when he was dying, and gladdened us with them more than with what he taught us during his lifetime, viz. the ball, the shoemaker’s last, the amulet, the phylactery, and a round cushion; be mindful of these and immerse them [for purification] just as they are, because they are established laws which were commanded to Moses on Sinai.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">[Cf.

Whoever sets his heart on four things is a sinner, viz. wealth, woman, the evil inclination and strife. It is necessary [to enumerate them all].

Therefore [it is made clear] that even when he has a wife it is prohibited [to neglect this] lest something forbidden chances to come his way [and he sins]. If it [only] cited ‘the evil inclination’, I might have said that the prohibition holds good only where it concerns his person but not where money [is involved], therefore it adds ‘riches’.

When he approached them he exclaimed, ‘Peace be upon you, headed by Rabban Gamaliel’.

At first it is written, <i>My lord being old</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gen. 18, 12.</i> and afterwards, <i>I … who am old</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>ibid.</i> 13. When Sarah was told by the angel that she would have a son she laughed to herself and exclaimed, <i>My lord being old;</i> but when God repeated what she had said to Abraham, not to hurt his feelings He changed the word to <i>I … who am old</i>.</i> [Beth Hillel] can reply: There is no question [that what we say] is correct according to the Torah, but it is also correct by the standard of human beings; reverse it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The text should read <i>kelappë ’alyah</i>, lit. ‘towards the tail’, i.e. reverse it, and the word which follows is an explanatory gloss (Jastrow <i>s.v. ’alyah</i>). The meaning is, To meet the question raised, it would be best in the Baraitha first to cite the passage from Genesis and then the example of ‘a bad purchase’.</i><br>[It was quoted above:] <i>And the innocent and righteous slay thou not</i>. Since you mention <i>the innocent</i> [may not be slain], obviously the <i>righteous</i> [may not]!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The term <i>innocent</i> has a negative connotation, viz. one who keeps away from evil; but the term <i>righteous</i> has both a negative and positive connotation, viz. one who keeps away from evil and does good.</i> [It denotes] ‘innocent because of witnesses’ and ‘righteous because of disciples’.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These are forensic terms. I. Where two witnesses testify against a man that he had committed an offence but disagree on the details, the accused is discharged. E.g., two witnesses testify that they saw him worshipping idols; one says that he worshipped the sun and the other that it was the moon. Because the witnesses are in disagreement on details, the man is acquitted. He is technically termed <i>naḳi me‘edim</i>, ‘innocent (or, freed) because of [the disagreement of] witnesses’. II. In the criminal court young scholars sat in rows in front of the judges. When the trial ended and before the verdict was delivered, any one of these scholars could, if he knew anything in favour of the accused, come forward and speak for him, and if the judges accepted his statement they discharged the accused. He was then termed <i>ẓaddiḳ min hattalmidim</i>, ‘righteous (i.e. acquitted) because of the disciples’. If the disciple wished to testify against the accused, he was not permitted to do so. That would be a case of <i>rasha‘ min hattalmidim</i>, ‘condemned because of the disciples’, which was not allowed. Cf. Sanh. 33b-34a (Sonc. ed., p. 212) and Rashi <i>ad loc.</i></i> From this we learn [the ruling]: Do not put to death ‘the innocent because of witnesses’ and ‘the condemned because of disciples’. [Do you think,] ‘Condemned because of disciples’? Say, because of <i>one</i> of the disciples.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refusal to listen to disciples’ statements against the accused holds good only when <i>one</i> disciple came forward. This procedure is based on Num. 35, 30; cf. Sanh. <i>loc. cit.</i></i><br>Raba expounded: What is the meaning of what is written, <i>For the Lord is righteous, He loveth righteousness; the upright shall behold His face?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ps. 11, 7.</i> If so, [the verse should read,] ‘He loveth the righteous’!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since He is described as <i>righteous</i>, that is the wording which might have been expected.</i> But [it is to be understood] as Raba interpreted it:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. ‘Erub 19a (Sonc. ed., pp. 129f.).</i> Abraham<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">So the text must be emended.

He prepared for them four beds, laid an abundant meal before them and gave them wine to drink. They said, ‘We discern that this wine [has the flavour of]the dead’. He brought them meat and they said, ‘This meat is dog’s flesh’. He brought them pickle and they said, ‘It contains urine’. He brought them mustard and they said, ‘It contains beetles’. [The host] went to the tavern-keeper and asked, ‘What happened to the wine?’ He replied, ‘Nothing’. He said, ‘I adjure you to tell me’. He replied, ‘The wine comes from my father’s vineyard where he is buried’. He went to the butcher who told him, ‘It was the meat of a lamb whose dam died and I made her suck from a bitch’. He went to the pickle-maker who told him, ‘One night I was drunk and [my family] locked me in. I wanted to pass water but was unable to go out, so I opened this [jar of pickle] and poured the urine into it’. He went to the mustard-maker who told him, ‘One night I left [the mustard] uncovered and beetles got into it’. He then took the trouble to prepare [another] meal for them. They said one to another, ‘We notice that the host’s legs are like those of a clown’. The host overheard this and said [to himself], ‘Perhaps these men speak the truth’. So he pretended to be very ill and people came to visit him. He said to his mother, ‘If you disclose to me the name of my father I will recover’. She told him, but he said to her, ‘You are telling a lie’. Since she noticed that he was grieved she said to him, ‘My son, once my husband brought a clown to me; I misconducted myself with him and conceived you’. He went and embraced them, bowed to them and exclaimed, ‘In truth you are the people of the Holy God’. This is what Solomon said, <i>For in much wisdom is much vexation; and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Eccl. 1, 18.
