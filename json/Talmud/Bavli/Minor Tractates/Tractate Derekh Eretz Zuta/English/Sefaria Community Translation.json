He says, \"all that is in this world, I have no delight in it, because this world is not for me.\" He abides, and repeats, and wears out his coat at the feet of the wise disciples, and no man can find fault [see an evil word] with him.

Rather, be like a lower threshold that all dust upon, like a (deep?) stake that all lean upon."

He questions according to the topic, and he answers with respect to the law. He speaks of first things first, and last things last. Regarding that which he has not heard, he says, \"I have not heard\", and he acknowledges the truth. The opposite of all these, the unformed soul does."
