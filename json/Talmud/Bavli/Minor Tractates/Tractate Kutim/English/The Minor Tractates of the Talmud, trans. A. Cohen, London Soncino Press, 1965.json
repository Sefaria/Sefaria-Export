            "The Samaritan is on the same footing as an Israelite in regard to all damages mentioned in the Torah. Whether an Israelite kills a Samaritan or a Samaritan kills an Israelite, if he did it by inadvertence he goes into exile [to a City of Refuge], if wilfully he is put to death.

            "Their cheeses are permitted. R. Simeon b.

If a Samaritan priest offers from what he is eating to an Israelite, should [the priest] be unclean it is permissible, but if clean it is forbidden.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Samaritan priest, if unclean, would not eat <i>terumah</i>, and therefore the Israelite may eat what he was eating.</i>",

[As the continuation indicates, the ruling was made because the Samaritan Passover did not always coincide exactly with the Jewish Festival. Cf. Kirchheim <i>ad loc.</i>]</i> When does this apply? When they have not prepared their unleavened bread together with Israelites or they observed Passover one day earlier; but if they baked their unleavened bread together with Israelites or observed Passover one day later, their leaven is permitted. R. Simeon forbids it because they do not know how to observe the law of unleavened bread like the Israelites.",

Apparently Gedor was a Samaritan village and Kfar Paggasha a heathen village near by with whose inhabitants the Samaritans freely mingled. Hence the doubt about the wine.</i> Later they revised this rule and said: Wherever [Samaritans] are suspected because of their mingling with Gentiles, if [their wine is] in an open [vessel] it is forbidden,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Because some of it may have been used in heathen worship.</i> and if in a closed [vessel] it is permitted. R. Meir said: All their wine is permitted except that which is in open [vessels for sale] in the markets; but the Sages said: In an open [vessel] it is everywhere forbidden and in a closed [vessel] permitted, while [a vessel] which has been pierced and then sealed is like one which is sealed.

            "Why are Samaritans forbidden to enter the Jewish community? Because they have become mixed up with the priests of the high places. R.

            "When may they be received into the Jewish community?
