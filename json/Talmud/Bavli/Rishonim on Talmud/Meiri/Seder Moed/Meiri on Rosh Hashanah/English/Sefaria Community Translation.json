                "Blessings of prayer, and blessings of praise and thanksgiving are all thanks and placation. And since that is such one person may not discharge his fellow's obligation for them, even though they are obligatory. It is explained in the [Jerusalem] Talmud, \"It is correct that everyone should request mercy for himself.\" Nevertheless, the prayer leader can discharge the obligation of someone who is unfamiliar with the prayers, as will be explained. And even though he already prayed, he may go back and pray to discharge the community, even those who are familiar, of their obligation to recite kaddish and kedushah. And so did some of the great authorities write here. However he can only discharge the obligation of prayer for one who is not familiar [with it]. Some of the great authorities wrote that one who already prayed and goes back to pray to discharge [the obligation of] others: And he finds that the congregation finished the songs of praise (<i>pesukei dezimrah</i>) but has not yet finished reciting the concluding blessing for them - meaning <i>yistabach</i> - he may also recite the blessing of  <i>yistabach</i>, since he is praying on their behalf, so he becomes attached to them. And he recites the blessing, even though he was not there at the time they said the songs of praise. But there are those who disagree about this; and I am leaning towards the opinion of those who disagree."
