                "<b>Even if a man married a woman in his youth, he should marry [again] in his old age. If he had children in his youth, he should have children in his old age:</b> Meaning to say, even if he already fulfilled the commandment of fruitfulness and multiplication. And this is rabbinic, as we explained above (on Yevamot 61b).  \"[If] one studied Torah in his youth, etc.; if he had students in his youth, he should have them in his old age.\" As sometimes those from his youth die, and the ones from his old age come and complete [the educational work needed]. \"They said about Rabbi Akiva that he had twelve thousand pairs of students and they all died in one period of time, because they did not treat each other with respect. And the world was desolate of Torah until Rabbi Akiva came to our Rabbis in the South and taught them - Rabbi Meir, Rabbi Yehudah, Rabbi Yosei, Rabbi Shimon, and Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua. And these are the very ones who upheld the time.\" And it is mentioned here that these [earlier] students all died from Pesach until Shavuot, but it is a tradition in the hands of the Geonim that the dying stopped on the day of Lag BaOmer - so as a result of that, we are accustomed not to fast on it. And we are also accustomed, as a result of that, not to marry a woman from Pesach [only] until that time. "
