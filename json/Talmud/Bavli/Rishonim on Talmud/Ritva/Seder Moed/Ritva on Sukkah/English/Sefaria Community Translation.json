            "Mishnah: A Sukkah which is taller than etc. The explanation is that the 'schach' itself is referred to as 'sukkah' in most places, but sometimes 'sukkah' refers to the 'schach' and the walls. And it established in the first perek of Eruvin that it taught about the space within the sukkah [and also] the space of a mavoi (entrance to a courtyard), this is coming to say that a sukkah is only invalid if the space within the sukkah is larger than 20 amot, and this is why it [the Mishnah] uses the language of \"taller than 20\", and we established over there [], that these 20 amot are amot comprised of 6 tefachim according to everyone, as was elucidated later on. And thus, you ... in every place. And the Gemara will explain the reason why this is invalid.",
            "And Rabbi Yehuda renders it valid: The Gemara will explain the reason.",
            "And its height can't be lower than ten tefachim: Explained, that 'schach' is not considered 'schach' unless there is space of ten tefachim below it, as it is stated in the gemara [later on].",
            "And if it does not have three walls: In the Gemara, this is explained.",
            "And if its [proportion of] sun is greater than its [proportion of] shade: Explained, that it is not considered 'schach' even according to Rabbi Yehuda, as everyone was only arguing on the first clause [in the Mishnah] alone. And then you will say; but was it not that Rabbi Yehuda does not need shade for 'schach', as he renders a sukkah taller than 20 amot kosher, because [in that case] there is no shade from the 'schach', rather only schach from walls, as is written in the Gemara. There is to say [i.e. answer], that Rabbi Yehuda doesn't need the 'schach' to actually produce shade, nonetheless he needs the 'schach' to have the ability to produce shade, because without this, it can't be called 'schach' at all, since everyone holds that 'schach' needs to produce shade. And this is right.",
            "An old sukkah, beis Shammai render invalid: In the Gemara it is explained that an 'old sukkah' is one that was made 30 days prior to sukkot. Some explain that the reason the halacha is like beis Hillel is that if it [the halacha] was like beis Shammai, there wouldn't have been an argument, but this isn't clear. The explanation is that an old sukkah would be rendered valid as any  sukkah made 30 days before Sukkot, would be made for the sake of the Festival. Beis Shammai hold that any sukkah made before Sukkot might not be for the sake of the festival, and therefore, render it [the sukkah] invalid. but this explanation, it does not hold when it comes to the language of the later teachings, that if one built his sukkah for the sake of the festival, it is valid."
