And stones, even placed simply, when he does not know if he will remove them or not, it is considered nullified. Unless he knows that he will remove it; then it is like straw placed simply, and it is not nullified.\" It follows that if straw or earth are nullified verbally, then everybody agrees that they are considered nullified. If straw is placed without intention, or earth is placed with intention to remove it, then it is not nullified according to everybody. On straw that he will not remove, and earth of similar nature, or even earth without any intention, it is a disagreement, and Rabbi Yose considers them to be nullified."
