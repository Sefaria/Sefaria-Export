And so was it taught before it (Sifra, Emor, Section 13:7), \"'To raise a light always' - so that the western light [burn] continuously, as he would begin with it and end with it.\" And since it is not written, \"to raise lights\" - we understand from this that one lamp is fixed, to begin with it every day. And that is the western lamp - the second one from the east. And thus do we learn (Tamid 33a), \"He entered.

But he would leave the western lamp burning, as from that lamp he would kindle the candelabrum in the afternoon.

This implies all [the others] are not before the Lord, etc.\" And he would finish the ordering with it. For he would order the rest in the morning, but he would order this one in the afternoon. And he would hold the old one in his hand or place it in a vessel until he would place the oil and wick and light, and [then] light the others from it. And that which we say in Seder Yoma (33b) - \"The arranging [of the candelabrum] is five lamps before the two lamps,\" implies that he would arrange all of them in the morning; and it learns this from verses - that is when no miracle existed, and he would find that it had been extinguished.
