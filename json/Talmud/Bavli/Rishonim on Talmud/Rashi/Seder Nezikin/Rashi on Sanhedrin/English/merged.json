In general, an asmachta involves one party (or both) consenting to surrender to the other a certain sum of money, depending on the performance or outcome of a particular event. In each case, the individual obligating himself enters into the agreement \"relying\" that the outcome will be favorable and that he will not have to pay. Since a transfer of ownership requires that the object's owner give it willingly, an asmachta agreement is non-binding, because the obligated party never sincerely meant to obligate himself.",
                "it is non-binding -- Rami bar Chama considers gambling an example of asmachta, because each player consents to the terms of the game only because he expects to win. Since the loser does not willingly surrender the wagered amount, the winner is considered to be stealing when he collects, and is thus ineligible as a witness or judge."

                "any agreement such as this is not considered an asmachta -- a true case of asmachta involves a situation in which the man obligating himself has reason to believe that he will not actually have to pay. For example, one who contracts to work his neighbor's field and stipulates that if he does not live up to his agreement he will pay a fine, never really expects to pay, because he feels confident that he can do as promised. Another example: Reuven, a debtor, pays 50 zuz of the 100 that he owes to his creditor, Shimon. To assure Shimon that he will repay the remaining 50 zuz in a timely fashion, Reuven gives the note of indebtedness to athird party, Levi, and states that if he, Reuven, does not pay the balance by such-and-such date, Levi should return the note to Shimon, thus enabling him to collect the entire 100 zuz. Reuven does not really expect to have to pay the additional penalty, because he believes that he will be able to meet his obligation on time. Since both these cases are asmachta agreements, if the contractor is unable to work the field or the debtor is prevented from paying on time, he is not subject to the agreed-upon penalty. A wager, though, does not constitute an asmachta, because each player realizes that as skilled as he may be at the game, the outcome is nonetheless governed by chance. Therefore, he is resigned to pay if he loses, and the winner is thus not guilty of stealing."

Rabbi Tarfon said neither of them [became] a nazirite because his words were in jest and that is not a solemn vow; a person must make a solemn vow [to become a nazirite].  He [Rabbi Yehuda]  is explaining Rabbi Tarfon’s reasoning; that is to say, he’s laying it out even though [the opinion] is not his.

                "Of Bayah the tax-collector - It once happened that Jewish tax-farmer, evil, and a great scholar died on the same day and in the same place. All the people assembled to attend the burial of the great scholar; at the same time the relatives of the tax-farmer brought his bier for burial. Enemies attacked the group, so they all dropped both biers and ran. One student however stayed there guarding the body of his rabbi. Some time later the town dignitaries returned to resume the burial of the great scholar, but the biers of the rabbi and the tax-farmer somehow got exchanged and the protests of the student were of no avail. So the relatives of the tax-farmer buried the great rabbi, which greatly distressed the student; nor could he explain to himself what great sin had caused the one to be buried in such a shameful way and what great merit in the other had brought about his interment with such honor. His rabbi appeared to him in a dream and told him not to be distressed. \"Come and let me show you how greatly I am honored in paradise and let me also show you that man in hell with the hinges of the gates of hell turning through his ears. Once I heard people calumniating the sages and did not protest (and that is why I was punished); he once prepared a banquet in honor of a city dignitary who did not show up, and he distributed the food to the poor (and that is why he was rewarded).\" The student asked how long the poor man was doomed to suffer such difficult judgment. \"Until Shimeon ben Shatach dies,\" was the reply, \"who will then replace him!\" \"Why?\" asked the student; \"Because there are Jewish women in Ashkelon who practice witchcraft and he does not subject them to judgment.\" The following day the student related his dream to Shimeon ben Shatach. The latter assembled eighty tall young men and distributed to each of them a jar with a cloak wrapped up inside (it was a rainy day). He also told them to make sure that they were always eighty in number. \"When you come inside,\" he said, \"one of you must raise his jar from the ground; from that moment the witches will have no further hold over you; if that does not work then we can never beat them.\" Shimeon ben Shatach went into the witches' hall and left the young men outside. When the witches asked him who he was he replied that he was a wizard who had come to test them with his wizardry. \"What tricks can you do?\" they asked. \"Despite the fact that it is raining today I can produce eighty young men with dry talitot!\" \"Show us!\" He went outside and beckoned the young men inside. They removed the talitot from the jars, put them on, and came in. They took each man one witch and carried them, and were able to defeat them, and hung them all up. The relatives of the witches were incensed. Two of them came forward and perjured themselves by testifying that Shimeon ben-Shatach's son had committed some crime that was punishable by death. He was condemned to death. As he was being taken out to be stoned he said, \"If I am guilty of this crime may my death bring me atonement, and if I am innocent may it atone for all my other sins and the responsibility for my death will be on the shoulders of the witnesses.\" When the perjurers heard this they recanted their testimony and explained that they had only acted because of their animosity at the fate of their women-folk, and so he wasn't killed."
