                "2. Takes <i>arakh</i> vows - if one says on another, 'the arakh of so-and-so is upon me'. He gives that arakh value of so-and-so according to his years that the arakh values were given according to years [age] as written in the Chapter of Arakhin. And after the years of the subject of the arakh vow we follow.",
                "3. Can be subject to <i>arakh</i> vows - if one says on, my arakh is upon me, or if another says upon him, 'so-and-so's arakh is upon me'.",

                "<b>Our Mishnah - a field, a lot:</b> A lot was a thousand cubits around the city. At it is written (Numbers 35:4), \"from the walls of the city and outward a thousand cubits.\" And outside of those thousand [cubits], the Levites had a thousand cubits for [cultivated] fields and vineyards. As it is written (Numbers 35:5), \"You shall measure from outside the city [two thousand], etc.\" Subtract a thousand cubit lot from them, and the rest is fields and vineyards. A lot is emptied of anything; it has no house in it, nor do we plant in it. Rather it is an adornment for the city [that way].",
