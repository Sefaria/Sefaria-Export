Also, before this period is not considered the time for lying down.  Therefore, if one read the Shema before, he does not fulfill his obligation.  If so, why do we read the Shema in the Synagogue?  In order to stand in Tefilah, in connection with words of Torah as is taught in the Briata in the Jerusalem Talmud Berachot.  Therefore one would have to read again after it gets dark.  [In this case] Reading the first section of the Shema at bed time suffices."

The offering of the fats that we learn here the sages did not say until midnight at all, and we did not learn here only to teach us that anything that is applied to at night is valid the entire night.

                "A minor girl who was married off by her mother after her father's death, because from the Torah, her marriage is nothing, because a minor girl is not capable of legal decisions, and her mother does not have from the Torah the power to marry her off, but her father does, as it says \"I have given my daughter to this man\" (Dev. 22). And even so the Rabbis decreed marriage for her which requires refusal, so that he will marry her and she will not go out to immorality. Therefore if she refuses after a time and says \"I cannot have him\", she goes out and is permitted to any man, and does not require a divorce from him. And R' Yehuda ben Bava testified that there are times when it is a Mitzvah for Bais Din to teach her to refuse him, such as two brothers married to two orphaned sisters - one an adult and her marriage is from the Torah, and one a minor whose marriage is only Rabbinic. And the husband of the adult one dies without children, and she falls to her brother for Yibum. And it is found she (the adult sister) is connected to him from the Torah, and this connection forbids his wife (the minor sister) to him, because she is the sister of a woman connected to him (for Yibum), which is like the sister of his wife. And Rabbi Eliezer says in Maseches Yevamos (109a): \"We teach such a minor girl to refuse her husband, and to uproot her marriage all the way back, and to make all her intimacy (with her husband) like immorality - to permit her husband to do Yibum with with her sister,\" as we learned in a Mishnah: \"They may marry (a relative of) a raped or seduced girl\" (Yevamos 97a). And Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava testified on the day Eduyos was taught that the Halacha is like Rabbi Eliezer."
