            "It was already a custom in the small towns to say 'El Melech Ne'eman' between Ahavat Olam and the reading of the Shema. And in my childhood it was difficult for me since it is known that Ahavat Olam is a blessing for a mitzvah for the reading of the Shema. All the mitzvot, all of them, require a blessing while one does them, and so we find in the Halel, and Megilah, and reading of the Torah, and all the more so in the reading of the Shema. And what we said in another commentary that  one who reads does not need to bless since he was already covered by Ahavah Rabah since it is a blessing to study Torah, rather we were silent regarding the two blessings before the reading of the Shema because its timing is dependent on the creation of light, and on its setting, but the blessings Yotzer Or and Ma'ariv Aravim are blessings of praise, as expressed in the dispute on page 53b... and since this is a blessing of mitzvah it is a clear thing that anyone who blesses, on a mitzvah or on food, and answers amen to one's own blessing is commiting a complete mistake, as it is explained in the Yerushalmi... on this I need to explain that the present issue [of saying EMN before the Shema]  that is explained by others that this constitutes an interruption, and one needs to go back and recite the blessing again, as taught [in Berakhot 40a.] \"take, the blessing was said.\"",
            "And why did they do this custom? - I needed to ask to Rabbi Meir HaLevi, and he answered that it is clear that this is a mistake, and it is not the custom on Sefarad rather on the Land of Israel, and may this error go back to its place.",
            "And after some time I saw some French students asking questions, and saying that they had a midrash agadah on the reading of the Shema that it had 248 words, corresponding to the limbs in the body, but when they counted they found only 239. And \"baruch shem kevod malchuto leolam vaed\" [=245] and that the sages needed to teach what is Pesachim, that \"el melech ne'eman\" completes the count, and obviously this is what our sages say in Yelamdenu..."
