            "<b>These found objects are his:</b> The explanation [of this is] - not specifically these, but rather anything that does not have an identifying mark is surely his. But it needed these to make us understand that they do not have an identifying mark. And for Abbaye, it was needed to make us understand that they were not [cases of] abandonment without awareness. And for Rava, it is possible that it came to make us understand that [this is the law] even though [the owner] did not know that it fell from him, for abandonment without awareness is [still considered] abandonment. And, according to Rava, from that which it teaches - bundles in a public area are his, but in a private area, he announces - it is implied that a knot is an identifying mark...",
            "<b>Scattered produce. And how much, etc... What are the circumstances?:</b> There are those that raise the difficulty for us, that since the Talmud holds that if [the case was in] the manner of being placed, even less [than a <i>kav</i> would require announcement]; if [it was] in the manner of being dropped, even more [than a <i>kav</i> would belong to the finder] - why does it originally inquire, \"and how much.\" And they answer that Rabbi Yitzchak himself said this: \"And how much? One <i>kav</i> in four cubits.\" And so too do they explain that which it says later (Bava Metzia 30b) concerning one who found a donkey or a cow grazing on a path not being a lost object, and the gemara inquires, \"And forever;\" and Rav Yehuda [answers], three days,\" and it comes back and asks, \"What are the circumstances,\" etc. And since it asks, \"What are the circumstances,\" why did it originally inquire, \"And how much (forever)?\" Rather, it is Rav Yehudah that inquired this. And likewise in the chapter [entitled] Lo Yachpor (Bava Batra 22b) [when it says], \"With what are we dealing here? [With a wall that is positioned] to the side. And how much? The full width of the window, etc. But can’t he still peer in, etc.?\" And so have I heard and it is a correct thing. And likewise in this way is that which they said in the first chapter of Chagigah 4a, \"Slaves, from where do we derive it? Rav Huna said, 'The verse stated, etc.'\" And it goes back and asks, \"Why do I need a verse, etc.?\" And it is likewise in many places. And likewise that which we said in the first chapter (Bava Metzia 18b) - \"Rabba does not say like Rabbi Zeira, as he holds that a mishna is stronger for raising a difficulty\" - is in this way. For at the beginning, it is the Talmud saying it. However the one in the chapter [entitled] Lo Yachpor is not similar to these. And its main explanation is like this: The one that asked the question was not at ease with four cubits nor was he at ease with the full width of the window, but rather with an in-between measurement, such as [two] (four) cubits and that which is similar to it.",
            "However here we can be exacting - why did Rabbi Yitzchak establish the mishna to be [a case of] a <i>kav</i> in four cubits and in the gathering [of grain] on the threshing floor? Let him establish it [as being found] in the way of being placed, and even more [than a <i>kav</i>]. And they answer because of Abbaye - since the law is like him - he could only have established the mishnah like this, as we say later on. But according to that reason, one could say that it was the gemara that asked, \"And how much\" - it established the mishnah to be in the gathering on the threshing floor and was asking about it, \"And how much?\" And Rabbi Yitzchak said about that, \"One <i>kav</i> in four cubits.\" And if you will say, \"If so, how did it ask, 'if [it was] in the manner of being dropped, even more [than a <i>kav</i> would belong to the finder]'; as it implied that [something found] in the manner of being dropped is his, whereas according to Abbaye, [what is found] in the manner of being dropped is not his\" - one can say that the gemara did not know the opinion of the one that says \"And how much,\" and it did not know the opinion of Rabbi Yitzchak. And hence it says, \"Also even [with] more, its law is a <i>kav</i> in four cubits\" - until Rav Ukma came and taught that our mishnah is [dealing with] the gathering on the threshing floor in accordance with everyone - both according to the opinion of the one that asked, and according to the opinion of Rabbi Yitzchak.  ",
            "And it should be explained that Rabbi Yitzchak did not come to establish the mishnah to only be [dealing with] the gathering on the threshing floor. Rather, this is what he meant: In the gathering on the threshing floor, a <i>kav</i> in four cubits is his. And he came to make us understand [that] law. But the mishnah was taught as definitive, for everything that is [found] not in the way of being placed. And likewise must you explain that which we say later (Bava Metzia 30b) - Rav Yehudah says, \"Three days\" - and it is established to be [in a case of] the early hours [of the morning] and in the dark [of nightfall] and for three days. As Rav Yehudah did not have to establish the mishnah to be in [a case of] the early hours and in the dark and for three days. Rather this is what he meant: The mishnah that taught that a cow grazing in the path is not a lost object did not mean always. Rather [it is] any time when it appears that it is standing there with the knowledge of [its] owners, and there are times when it is only three days and no more - such as the early hours and in the dark.",
            "And I can say that there, it is established as in the early hours and the dark because of this: For if it was in the daytime, it is obvious that it is not a lost object. And this is the main [explanation]. And that which our rabbi brought in the Halakhot (Rif Bava Metzia 12a) - \"If [it was] in the manner of being dropped, even more [than a <i>kav</i> would belong to the finder]\" - is not correct according to what we have written (since the law follows Abbaye). And it appears to me that he holds that after we answer [up other parts of the mishnah according to Abbaye] in the gemara (Bava Metzia 21b), [that] it is on account of their significance and weightiness, these [sheaves of grain] are also weighty and significant - so Abbaye would not need that [qualification] of Rav Ukva. And our last explanation that we wrote would be correct, such that they did not establish our mishnah to be only in the gathering on the threshing floor. For behold, even according to Abbaye, it is not necessary to establish it exclusively like that."
