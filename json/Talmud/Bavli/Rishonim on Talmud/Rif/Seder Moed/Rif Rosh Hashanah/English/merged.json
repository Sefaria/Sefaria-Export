            "<b>Gemara (Rosh Hashanah 18b):</b> It was stated, \"Rav and Rabbi Chanina said, 'The Scroll of Fasting (<i>Megillat Taanit</i>) has been abolished.' And Rabbi Yochanan and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said, 'It was not abolished.'\" (19b) And the law is that it was abolished; and the law is that it was not abolished! There is a difficulty from [one] law to [the other] law!?! It is not difficult. Here it is about Chanukkah and Purim; there it is about the other days."
