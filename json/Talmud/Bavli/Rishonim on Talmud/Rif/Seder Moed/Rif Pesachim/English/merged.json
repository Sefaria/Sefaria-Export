            "It was taught (in a baraita), \"They said about Hillel that he would wrap matzah and bitter herbs together and eat them, because it is stated (Numbers 9:11), 'They shall eat it with matzot and bitter herbs.'\" Rabbi Yochanan said, \"His colleagues disagree with Hillel, as it was taught (in another baraita), 'One might [have thought] that he should wrap matzot and bitter herbs together and eat them in the manner that Hillel eats them; [therefore] we learn to say, \"They shall eat it with matzot and bitter herbs\" - even this by itself, and that by itself.'\" And now that the law was not stated in accordance with Hillel, nor in accordance with the Rabbis, and we must make a remembrance of the Temple and we must also eat each one of them by itself - so that the bitter herbs which are rabbinic do not come and negate the matzah which is of Torah writ - one recites the blessing over the matzah by itself and eats it; and then he recites the blessing over the bitter herbs by themselves and eats them; and then he wraps the matzah and bitter herbs together and eats them without a blessing, in remembrance of the Temple, like Hillel"
