            "The Talmud asks what do we do if there is no (publicity) clause? Ravina says we are not concerned, Rav Ashi says we are concerned. And the Halakha is that we are concerned. Rav Hai Ga'on writes \"we are not normally concerned with wills that don't include a (publicity) clause. It is an every day event that we remove assets, for it is a mitzvah at a time of death, through gifts, and transfers are completed and we are not concerned that they do not include a publicity clause\". And he further wrote that \"a person on his deathbed who says do  not publicize this request until after I die, is not considered a concealed gift, for since it will be carried out after his death, at that time it was not concealed, for he told the witnesses that after he dies it will be revealed, and clearly it will be revealed, for he told them that after his death they should do what is in the will, and there is no need to be concerned with a concealed gift.\" "
