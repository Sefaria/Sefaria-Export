            "I will begin Tractate Beitzah (Egg).  With the help of the One Who is Great in Council. ",
            "Regarding an egg laid on a Festival, Beit Shammai says that you may eat it and Beit Hillel says that you may not eat it:  Food that has been separated.  This is the explanation:  such as food has been separated; a limb from a limb.  Regarding Muktzeh, anything that has not been prepared (i.e. designated for use on Yom Tov or Shabbat) is called Muktzeh.  Here is the meaning of Nolad: Anything that did not exist from yesterday and came into being today is called Nolad. Rav Nachman establishes that the case in our Mishnah deals with a hen that was designated for laying eggs.  And he has aligned Beit Shammai with Rabbi Shimon who is lenient and does not subscribe to a broad application of Muktzeh.  And he has aligned Beit Hillel with Rabbi Yehuda who is stringent and subscribes to a broad application of Muktzeh.  We find ourselves perplexed wondering if Rav Nachman could have really aligned Beit Shammai with Rabbi Shimon and Beit Hillel with Rabbi Yehuda for indeed this is the opposite of what we have heard from him for we have learned (in Mishnah Shabbat) Chapter (21) titled \"A Man May Lift His Child.\"  Beit Hillel says we may pick up bones and shells (from the table) and Beit Shammai says one must remove the whole table board (and shake them off).  And in both cases we go after the Stam Mishnah (i.e. the Mishnah that had not been attributed to any particular Rabbi)."
