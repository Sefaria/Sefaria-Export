            "Rava said: Learn from the statement of Rabbi Akiva three halachos. Learn from it that the removal of leavened bread can be performed only by means of burning, because if you say that you can do it with out burning, it should be allowed even on Yom Tov, without burning. And second, learn from it that the prohibition against kindling a fire on Shabbos was specifically singled out in the Torah to divide the various primary categories of labor and to establish liability for performance of each of them. Because if you say that kindling is singled out to teach that there is no capital punishment for performing that primary category of labor, the positive commandment of Shabbos should come and push off the prohibition of kindling a fire. And third, learn from it that we do not say: Since it is permitted to kindle a fire for the purpose of preparing food, it is also permitted to light a fire not for the purpose of preparing food, e.g., to burn leaven.\n"
