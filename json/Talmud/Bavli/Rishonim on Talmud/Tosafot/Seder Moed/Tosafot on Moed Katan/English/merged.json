Answer: That small amount is not important, since it is Kalshehu (any amount suffices); R. Gamliel would agree that one must add that Shi'ur [to Shevi'is, when it enters and leaves]."

Gamliel was meticulous about why the traditions about Tosefes Shevi'is and Nisuch ha'Mayim were taught together; Everywhere, these three Halachos (including also Aravah) are taught together. They were given [to Moshe] this way. Surely, Hash-m did so to teach [that all of them apply only when the Mikdash stands]."

Regarding anything that ceases, we forbid lest he bring from a far place. Since he began to water it, [he must continue,] lest his field be ruined. Therefore, we establish here to discuss when it does not cease."

Even though he does not intend for this, it is Melachah. Implied question: R. Shimon permits Davar she'Eino Miskaven! Answer: We say that R. Shimon agrees about a Pesik Reishei (an inevitable consequence, e.g. one cannot cut off a chicken's head) and it will not die; Rabanan (who permit) hold that since he does it through a Shinuy, it is not a Melachah, and it is permitted, for it is not considered plowing."

Inference: From the Mishnah with the Gemara, we can learn that one may not water land, except for what is Devar ha'Avud, lest the grain or trees planted in it get ruined. The same applies to other Avodas Karka. It is forbidden during Chol ha'Moed. Implied question: We say that one may water! Answer: This is only from an irrigation channel that passes through the field itself. It is not excessive exertion. One may fix pits and caves of an individual, and dig l'Chatchilah for a Rabim, since they need water. The Beraisa above says so, like I explained."

However, Chachamim were stringent due to the stringency of Taharos. Therefore, they were lenient, for there is not a Safek Torah; They said [to be stringent], and they said [when to be lenient]. They did not regularly bury deeply, like nowadays. Therefore, we are not concerned lest the Mes was deep under the plow (and a Shi'ur of something with Tum'as Ohel remains there.) Letter of the law, one should not even need to blow. It is merely a stringency of Taharos that Chachamim imposed in this matter. Question #1: Why aren't we concerned lest there is a Mes in the ground that he does not touch, and it is Metamei b'Ohel? Question #2: Alternatively, trees on the side towering [over the Beis ha'Peras] should be Metamei a person b'Ohel! Answer to both questions: This shows that it is not Metamei b'Ohel."

Rava expounded that the Halachah follows R. Yoshiyah, who does not decree lest one grind spices, regarding Refu'ah of animals. Rashi's opinion: \"Lisrukei Susya\" is rubbing and cleaning a horse with a comb. Rebuttal: We hold that both Kirod and Kirtzof (combing with a fine or coarse comb) are permitted (Beitzah 23a), according to R. Shimon, who permits Davar she'Eino Miskaven (a fine comb makes a wound), and the Halachah follows him! Conclusion: Rather, it is another matter."
