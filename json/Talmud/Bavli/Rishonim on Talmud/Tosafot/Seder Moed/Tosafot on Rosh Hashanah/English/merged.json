                "<b>Rava said, \"That is to say one who blows for the music (<i>lashir</i>) has fulfilled [his obligation]\":</b> As commandments do not require intent. In the chapter [entitled] Arvei Pesachim (Pesachim 114b), it is implied that it is [the basis of] an argument concerning, \"[Vegetables] would be set before him; he dips the lettuce.\" As [a beraita] is taught in the Gemara, \"If one ate [vegetables] of doubtfully tithed produce, he has fulfilled [his obligation]. If he ate them without the intent, he has fulfilled [his obligation].\" But in a different baraita [there, it says], \"It was taught (in a baraita) [that] Rabbi Yosei says, 'Although one has already dipped the lettuce, it is a commandment to bring before him  (matzah), lettuce and <i>charoset</i>.'\" And there it infers that it is perforce not on account of a signal [for the children to ask], since it taught, \"it is a commandment.\" Rather it is on account of commandments not requiring intent [and he did not have intent the first time]. But now that which Rava had to infer from here and did not bring the baraita from there that taught it explicitly is since I would have said that it is [only] with the vegetables [which are] rabbinic; but [with] Torah commandments, intent is required. And that which he asks from baraitot later and does not challenge from Rabbi Yose there is since he could have found to push it off [by saying,] \"That it is a commandment on account of [it being] a signal.\""

As, if so, even if he had had intent, he also would not fulfill [his obligation]. So it appears to me,  he sounded bark-like blasts, since he did not intend to blow the measure of the blast, but he [nevertheless] blew the measure of the blast. And perhaps this is what [Rashi] means to say. Or also (another answer) is that it is similar to what [Rashi] explained later in the last chapter (Rosh Hashanah 33b) - he was acting unawares, as he [only] blasted the shofar, but it came out for him as a [proper] blow."

                "<b>The length of a <i>teruah</i> is like three whimpers (<i>yevavot</i>):</b> [Rashi] explained [that this is] simply three short sounds. And later on (Rosh Hashanah 34a), we say that Rabbi Abbahu established [the blowing of] <i>kashra\"k, kasha\"k, kara\"k</i> (<i>tekiah, shevarim-teruah, tekiah; tekiah, shevarim, tekiah; tekiah, teruah, tekiah</i>), in Caesarea because he was in doubt if the <i>teruah</i> of the verse is an actual <i>teruah</i> - what we call <i>teruah</i> - which is pouting pouts; or perhaps <i>shevarim</i> of wailing wails; or that both <i>shevarim</i> and <i>teruah</i> are needed for <i>teruah</i>, as perhaps it is [both] wailing wails and pouting pouts. So one needs to be careful with <i>shevarim</i> not to stretch each one out by itself like the three whimpers that are three short sounds. As if so, it becomes a <i>tekiah</i> and not a <i>shevarim</i>. For behold, the length of a <i>tekiah</i> is like [that of] a <i>teruah</i>, and the length of a <i>teruah</i> is like three whimpers. And it appears that a person is obligated to stretch out the <i>tekiah</i> of <i>kashra\"k</i> more than of <i>kasha\"k</i>, and of <i>kasha\"k</i> more than <i>kara\"k</i>. For behold the length of a <i>tekiah</i> is like [that of] a <i>teruah</i>; and we do <i>kashra\"k</i> of pouting and wailing. So it comes out that we have to stretch out the <i>tekiah</i> of <i>kashra\"k</i> like the length of three <i>shevarim</i> and three whimpers; the <i>tekiah</i> of <i>kasha\"k</i> like the length of three <i>shevarim</i> - since behold we do <i>kasha\"k</i> for the doubt that it is wailing wails; and the <i>tekiah</i> of <i>kara\"k</i> like the length of a <i>teruah</i>, which is pouting pouts. However, if he stretches out each <i>tekiah</i> like those of <i>kashra\"k</i>, there is no concern. For he may stretch it out as [much as] he wishes, since it is taught [in the mishnah], \"and then stretched out the second [<i>tekiah</i>] like two, he only has [the fulfillment of] one in his hand.\" (This shows that a long <i>tekiah</i> nevertheless counts as a <i>tekiah</i>.) And it is also due to this reason that there no concern if one does four or five <i>shevarim</i>, since the <i>shevarim</i> are in place of a <i>teruah</i>. So it is a long <i>teruah</i>, just like we stretch out the whimpers [of a standard <i>teruah</i>]. And the Riva and the Ri, son of the rabbi, Rabbi Meir, explain that a whimper is three very short blows. It comes out that a <i>teruah</i> is nine blows, and that is the length of a <i>tekiah</i> as well. And according to their explanation, there is no concern if one stretches out the <i>shevarim</i> a little. However, according to their opinion, one needs to stretch out the <i>tekiah</i> of <i>kashra\"k</i> the length of three <i>shevarim</i> and nine blows. And one who does not stretch out those <i>tekiah</i> blasts like this length, but stretches out the <i>shevarim</i> a little, will not fulfill the commandment - neither like [one] master, nor like the [other] master. And Rabbenu Chananel explained like the explanation of [Rashi]. And today we are accustomed to blowing thirty blows while sitting after the reading of the Torah - three of each <i>kashra\"k, kasha\"k</i> and <i>kara\"k</i>. And during the [additional (<i>musaf</i>)] prayer, we blow <i>kashra\"k</i> during [the blessing of] Kingship (Malkhiot); <i>kasha\"k</i> during [the blessing of] memory (zikhronot); and <i>kara\"k</i> during [the blessing of] shofar (shofarot). But according to the discussion of our entire chapter, it would have been fitting to blow <i>kashra\"k, kasha\"k, kara\"k</i> - once for Kingship; and likewise for memory; and likewise for shofar - during the prayer; or all of it after the prayer. But we do not find [a source for blowing] before the prayer. It is as is taught [in the mishnah], \"one who recited the blessings, and only afterward a shofar became available to him.\" However we do find earlier in the the first chapter (Rosh Hashanah 16a), \"Why do we blow <i>tekiah</i> and <i>teruah</i> while they are sitting and blow <i>tekiah</i> and <i>teruah</i> while they are standing? In order to confuse the Satan.\" And that is like what we do. However at first glance it would appear that the blowing during the prayer should likewise be <i>kashra\"k, kasha\"k, kara\"k</i> for each [of the blessings] of Kingship, memory and shofar, in order to alleviate the doubt of Rabbi Abbahu. And in the Arukh, he explained that this is what they would do. As he explains in the entry for <i>erev</i>, \"And those who are stringent blow thirty [blasts] (a full set) when they are sitting, thirty during the silent prayer and thirty according to the order [of the blessings], corresponding to the hundred yelps of Sisera's mother. And those [extra] ten (needed in order to bring it to one hundred) are when they finish all of the prayers - a single blowing of ten, <i>tashra\"t, tasha\"t, tara\"t</i>. So there are one hundred.\" And Rabbenu Tam would wonder about our custom, since the <i>kashra\"k</i> of Kingship and the <i>kasha\"k</i> of memory and the <i>kara\"k</i> of shofar contradict one another. For if [the intended sound] is wailing and pouting, they all need to have <i>kashra\"k</i>; and it it is only wailing, they all need to have <i>kasha\"k</i>; and if it is only pouting, they all need to have <i>kara\"k</i>. So Rabbenu Tam instituted in our place to blow <i>kashra\"k</i> for memory and shofar, just like for Kingship. As now we have alleviated any doubt, and there is only [the issue of] a pause. But it is enough with this, so as not to change the custom too much. [And the pause is also not a problem.] For behold we say, \"If one heard nine blasts at nine times during the day, he has fulfilled [his obligation].\" But one can somewhat give a reason for our custom: That it holds like the one that says adjacently (Rosh Hashanah 34a:10), One [<i>teruah</i>] is from the words of the Torah and two are from the words of the Sages.\" And since, while sitting, they have already [covered] all the doubts about those of the Torah and those of the Sages, they only concerned themselves to repeat and to do the [blasts for the] doubt about the Torah, at the time of the prayer. And in the Kedushah of Agan Hasahar, Rabbi Shimshon bar Yonah wrote, \"the beauty of forty blasts when we blow them.\" And that is like our custom. And likewise is it in the Seder Rav Amram, except that he wrote that we blow one <i>teruah</i> without a <i>tekiah</i> at the end. And if you [ask]: How do we fulfill [the commandment] with those of sitting - behold we learn [in a baraita] at the end of the chapter (Rosh Hashanah 34b), \"The blasts and the blessings of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur impinge upon one another\" - hence they need to be done at the time of the prayer!?! That is not a refutation. For even though it is implied from [Rashi's] commentary that the explanation of - if he recited the blessing and did not blow, or he blew but did not recite the blessing - is about Kingship, memory and shofar, it is impossible to say this.  For we learn [in a baraita] later on (ibid.), \"If there are two towns - in one they blow, and in the other they recite the blessings, one should go to the place where they blow, and one does not go to the place where they recite the blessings.\" And we [also] learned [in the mishnah], \"One who recited the blessings, and a shofar became available to him afterward.\" This implies that one can recite the blessing without the blasts. Rather, \"the blasts and the blessings impinge upon one another,\" means that the blasts impinge upon each other and the blessings impinge upon each other: When he recites the blessings of Kingship, memory and shofar, he recites all three blessing or he does not recite any blessing at all. And likewise, <i>tekiah, shevarim</i>, and <i>teruah</i> - if he is an expert in the three of them, he should blow; and if not, he should not blow. But there is a need to [understand] about those thirty blasts that we blow while sitting, when he finishes the three sets of <i>kashra\"k</i> and he begins the sets of <i>kasha\"k</i>; or when he finishes the sets of <i>kasha\"k</i> and he begins the sets of  kara\"k - why do I need two <i>tekiah</i> blasts, one after the other? Either way, he could be absolved [from the obligation] with one blast! For if [the intended sound] is wailing and pouting, behold he has fulfilled [his obligation] with the three series of <i>kashra\"k</i>; if it is only wailing, that last <i>tekiah</i> of <i>kashra\"k</i> should count for the tally of <i>kasha\"k</i>; and likewise if it is pouting, that last <i>tekiah</i> of <i>kasha\"k</i> should count for the tally of <i>kara\"k</i>. But perhaps once they [designated] the tekiah to be for the sake of the simple blast after the <i>teruah</i>, they did not want it to count for the sake of the simple blast before it. However, we have found, \"[if] he then stretched out the second [<i>tekiah</i>] like two,\" that it would have counted as two [blasts] if it were not because we do not divide a blast into two."
