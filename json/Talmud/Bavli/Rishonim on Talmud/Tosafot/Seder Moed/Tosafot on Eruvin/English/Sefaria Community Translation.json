But since he is now back in his original Shabbos boundary, he is not given another 4 handbreadths, rather he returns to his original Shabbos boundary [of 2,000 handbreadths].  But in case where he does not lose his [new boundary of] 4 handbreadths by walking back in [to the original Shabbos boundary] -- he cannot return [to the original boundary].\n"

Because [in the final analysis] this [reason of propensity to run away], was not Rabbi Meir's reason [for prohibiting an animal], as the Gemara concludes in the chapter \"The One Who Sleeps\" (Sukkah 23a).
