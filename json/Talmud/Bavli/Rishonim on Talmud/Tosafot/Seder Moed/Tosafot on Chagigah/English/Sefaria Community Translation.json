                "<b>Mishnah \"All are obligated in the appearance\"</b>. Rashi explains <small>(this passage of the Mishnah)</small> with the Mitzvah of (Shemos 23:17) <i>Your Males shall appear (before the Sovereign, the Lord)</i>. <small>[Translator: the current assumption is Rashi is referring specifically to the aspect of the Mitzva that requires one to appear in Temple for the Festival, not the aspect where one must bring a Korban (sacrifice). Tosafos will bring 4 proofs against this assumption]</small> Yet, asks Rabbeinu Elchonon that behold we teach in close proximity <small>(i.e. later in the Mishna)</small> <b>Bais Shammai says the Appearance (Korban) is two silver coins</b>. The implication being we are discussing the Korban. Further, the Gemara (4b) (says) <b>It is taught (i.e. Baraisa): The uncircumcised and the ritually impure are exempt from (the mitzva) of appearance. (The Gemara comments:) Granted, a ritually impure (person is exempt), as it is written \"And there you shall come\" (Devarim 12:5). Anyone that is included in coming (into the Temple which is disallowed if one is impure), is included in bringing (the Korban)</b>. And further, we say in the Talmud Yerushalmi at the beginning of our Tractate (1a) <small>[Translator: this is not exactly how our version of Yerushalmi is worded but the meaning and derivation is the same.]</small> <b>In what regard are these words said (i.e. the 1st Mishna in Chagiga - All are obligated in appearance) the Appearance Korban, but in (the aspect of) Physical Appearance in the Azarah (Temple Courtyard) all are obligated (i.e. even many of those exempt from brining a Korban) like (the mitzva of) Hakhel (when all would gather at the end of Sukkos to hear a public Torah reading by the king) men, women and (even) little children.</b> Further, it says in the Gemara (6b) <b>As it is taught (i.e. Baraisa) Rabbi Yosei (HaGelili) says The Jewish people were commanded three mitzvot when they ascended for the Festivals: Appearance, Simcha (Joy), and the Chagigah (festival offering)</b> <small>[this is reversed in our version of the Gemara with Simcha]</small> (continues the Gemara) <b> There is to the Appearance not with the other two...that the Appearance is completely burned (or brought up).</b> The implication is that Appearance without explanation refers to the Korban. <small>[Translator: Now that Tosafos has shown the proofs/refutations that Rashi can't be explained as referring to just the appearing aspect of the mitzvah but the Korban. Tosafos now assumes Rashi is referring to both parts of the Mitzva.]</small> Therefore, it is seems to Rabbeinu Tam that the Mishnah is referring to the Korban and the Temple Courtyard (i.e. appearing there), and Rashi who mentions the physical appearance in the Temple Courtyard mentions one that implies two. Since the exemptions of all mentioned even exempting from appearing in the Temple Courtyard, all the more so in the matter of Appearance in regard to the Korban. <small>[Translator: having previously mentioned 4 proofs that the Mishnah is mentioning the Korban, there could be an assumption that the Mishnah is exclusively about the Korban aspect of the mitzvah not the Physically Appearing aspect. This is in fact the opinion of the Talmud Yerushalmi mentioned above. Tosafos goes on to prove that this is not the case in the Bavli, bringing 4 proofs that show clearly the Bavli argues.]</small> And there is also to respond that the Mishnah implies the Physical Appearance as well, that it teaches afterward <b>Which minor (is exempted)? All that are not able to go etc. </b>. The implication being the Minor mentioned is stated <small>(in the Mishnah in question 'All are obligated etc.')</small> - we see <small>(the exemption is)</small> due to the Physical Appearance in the Temple Courtyard because he is not able to go there. However to the opinion of the Yerushalmi it does not work according to our teaching's opinion <small>(i.e. the Talmud Bavli)</small> because of many things. That there (in the Yerushalmi) it learns from \"Hakhel\" to obligate, but we do not learn from it rather to exempt a Chereish (Deaf Person, see 2b-3a). Even though we say later (source) <b> You might have thought learn from \"Appearing\" \"Appearing\" from Hakhel - just as there women are obligated etc.</b>. Nonetheless, from there we learn that in truth we do not learn from Hakhel to obligate."

                "<b>Return rebellious children:</b> In the Yerushalmi (Jerusalem Talmud Chagigah 2:1:10), it explains why this happened to him, and there are more verses that he expounds: He killed those that spoke words of Torah. They said, if he saw a student excelling in Torah, he killed him. Not only that, but he went to the school house and saw children in front of their Torah teacher. He said, what are those sitting doing here? [The profession of this one is builder,] etc. When they heard this, they left us (the rabbis) and went away. And Rabbi Meir told him, that which it is written (Job 42:10),  \"(And the Lord blessed) Job twice all that he had\" - he [explained it to mean] that He doubled his money. But [Acher] answered him that Rabbi Akiva expounded it, that He blessed him by the merit of commandments and good deeds which were from his beginning. He brought him (Ecclesiastes 7:8), \"The end of a matter is better than the beginning of it.\" Rabbi Meir expounded it about a man who had children in his youth but they died, and had children in his old age and they lived. He said, your teacher, Rabbi Akiva, did not expound it so; rather, the end of a matter is good in the case that it is good from the beginning, and this applies to me. My father Abuya was one of the leading Jerusalemites. On the day he came to circumcise me, he invited all the leading Jerusalemites and sat them in one room, and sat Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua in another place. After they ate and drank, they started to clap  and dance. Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua said, \"While they are occupied in theirs let us be occupied with ours.\" They sat occupied with words of the Torah. Fire descended from Heaven and surrounded them. [Abuya] said to us, \"My teachers! Why do you come to burn down my house?\" They said to him, \"Heaven forbid! But we were sitting reviewing the words of the Torah, from the Torah to the Prophets, from the Prophets to the Writings, and the words were joyful as at their giving on Sinai. And were they not [then originally] given in fire?\" [So Abuya] said, \"If that is the power of Torah, if this son of mine survives, I dedicate him to Torah.\" Since his intent was not for Heaven, it did not succeed with him. And in place of that which in our Gemara (Bavli) is, \"behind the curtain,\" there it is, \"behind the holy of holies.\" And also found there is that  once he rode [on an animal] on Yom Kippur which fell out on a Shabbat and he heard, etc. And it brings that [passage] from Kiddushin (39b), such that he saw a man taking the chicks and sending away the mother. And when approaching, [that man] fell and he died. But [Acher] did not know to expound the [relevant verse] like Rabbi Yaakov - as it is brought there. And also found [there] is that he saw the tongue of Rabbi Yehudah the baker in the mouth of a dog, and he was the great man from Kiddushin. But Rabbi Natan says, \"When his mother was pregnant with him, she passed by idolatry, smelled of that kind and ate it. And that kind was bubbling in her body like the poison of a viper.\" Later [Elisha] fell sick. They told Rabbi Meir, \"Your teacher is sick.\" He went to visit him. He said, \"Are you repenting?\" He said, \"If I repent, will they accept [me]?\" He said to him, \"Is it not written (Psalms 90:3), 'You bring back a man up to extinction, saying, \"Repent, sons of man!\"'\" Elisha cried and passed away. Rabbi Meir said, \"It seems that he passed away repentant.\" After they buried him, fire descended from Heaven and burned [his grave]. They told Rabbi Meir, \"Your teacher’s grave is on fire.\" He went and spread his garment over it. He said, \"'Stay for the night, etc.' (Ruth 3:13) - stay here in this world, which compares to the night; 'and it will be in the morning,' for the world to come. 'If he will act as a redeemer, good' - the redeemer, this is the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is written (Psalms 145:9), 'The Lord is good to all.' 'Let him redeem. But if he does not want to act as redeemer for you, I will do so myself.'\" They said to [Rabbi Meir], \"[What would you say] if they say to you in that world, 'Whom do you want to bring close first, your father or your teacher?'\" He said to us, \"I would bring my teacher close first and afterwards my father.\" They said to him, \"Will they listen to you?\" He said to them, \"Did we not teach, 'One saves the case of a scroll with the scroll?' One saves Elisha with the merit of his Torah.\" "

It can be said (answered) that it was minors who were studying before him, and we are concerned lest they by drawn [after him]. And also (another answer): Even though they were adults, Rav Yehudah excommunicated him, since he found room to do so. And it was legal, since he had gained a bad reputation (R. R. Elchanan).\n"
