However, in the first teachings of Megillah (page 2) it is difficult, as it asks, \"From where do we derive this?\" \"From where?! As we need to say that the sages were lenient, etc.\" And so what? Is it because of this that we don't inquire about where this comes from? Since that reason is not explicitly stated in the Mishnah!"
