However, this does not appear [to be a correct], since the (Aramaic) Targum explains items that cannot be understood from the Hebrew, as can be found in many places. [For example], Rabbi Yosef said, (Megillah 3a) \"If it were not for the (Aramaic) Targum of this verse, I would not know what it is speaking of.\" Therefore, one should not recite [the translation] in any language the third time (i.e. after the verses are read in Hebrew twice), except for the language of the (Aramaic) Targum."

                "It was asked to Rabbi Yitzchak '[People]  like us, who do not learn right after the morning prayer and are busy, go without learning until midday or later. Why don't we say the Blessings for Torah Study a second time when we start to learn [In the afternoon.]?' <br>Rabbi Yitzchak replied: 'We don't accept what it says in Jerusalem Talmud. In our Talmud doesn't say that you have to learn immediately [without any interruption]. Furthermore even according to the Jerusalem Talmud, the blessing of  Ahavah Rabbah is not primarily a blessing for Torah Study - it was primarily instituted as a blessing for the Shema. Therefore it doesn't cover  blessing for Torah Study, unless one learns right away without any interruption. <br> However, the blessings Asher Bachar Banu Laasok BeDivrei Torah Which are mainly  Blessings for Torah Study covers his study for the entire day. <br>If you will ask why is this different to Sukkah that you have to make a blessing lay-shayv bah-soo-kah before every meal [and for Torah Study just in the morning]? <br>Answer: One can suggest that studying Torah is different because he doesn't forget about it. A person is constantly obligated to learn, like it says ”you shall meditate therein day and night”. It's similar to one who was sitting a whole day [And learning Torah] without interruption.  <br>However, eating in the sukkah has a set time <br>If you ask, why don't we make a blessing “to sleep in the sukkah”? <br>Answer: One can suggest, that the blessing we say for eating covers the sleeping in the sukka.  <br>Alternative answer: since he may not fall asleep and it becomes a blessing in vain. For a person is not able to fall asleep whenever he wants. Rabbeinu Tam used to say, that when a person gets up  in the night to study he doesn't need to say the Blessings for Torah because the blessings from yesterday morning cover until the next morning.  <br>But it doesn't seem right.

And it's not clear because Ezra decreed the reading of the Torah, and since it was Ezra, why would I need the word \"Vehayu?\" And there is to say that since this is referencing the biblically ordained readings like Parshat Zachor. Alternatively, it could reference the biblical readings like on the first fruits, the tithe confession, and the spurning of the levirate marriage whose recitation is biblical. Even though it was said in every language at Sinai because every utterance from the Mouth of G-d would divide into seventy languages [those readings must be recited in the Holy Tongue]."

However, in the Yerushalmi it says, if you want to be stringent, we don't let him. Therefore, it appears to say, one does not bless and one is not permitted to bless, and the Yerushalmi explains why, and says because of Kavod HaMeit (respect for the dead). Alternatively, because he doesn't have anyone who will carry his burden. We ask a question: but isn't it taught in a Braita: exempt from netilat lulav. And should you think we are dealing with Yom Tov, and there he is not too busy to carry the burden, and we teach that it is referring to Chol, meaning Chol HaMoed [because he could potentially bury on Chol]. But isn't it taught in a Braita: 'Exempt from the blowing of the shofar'. It should have said on a weekday and not on Yom Tov. And that's a question. And we answer: Rav Chanina said, since he needs to prepare the casket and the shrouds [which the dead wear], as it is taught in a Mishnah: \"you may violate the boundary to bring him a casket and shrouds\" its as if he is carrying the burden. Consequently, the implication is that on shabbat and yom tov you are not permitted to make blessings and pray since you are busy violating the boundary to bring him a casket and shrouds.

                "If he erred and did not pray mincha on Friday etc.; He erred and did not pray mincha on shabbat he prays at arbit twice.  This is to say, on Saturday night, and he says havdalah in the first, etc.   Rabeinu Yehuda wrote that if he erred and did not mention Rosh Chodesh at mincha he should not pray an extra time in the evening, for what will this accomplish? He already prayed mincha, he just forgot to add [yaaleh ve'yavoh for] Rosh Chodesh. If so, he does not gain anything if he prays an extra time in the evening after Rosh Chodesh has ended, since he will not mention Rosh Chodesh [in the extra prayer], and he has already prayed Amida. And this is different than the case here, where one erred and did not pray mincha on shabbat [at all], where in the evening he prays an extra time using the Amida of a regular evening, since here he did not pray at all so at least he gains the extra amida when he prays after shabbat ends in the evening, even though he is not mentioning shabbat.  And if you will ask, isn't he praying more than required since on shabbat there were only seven blessings and he will pray 18? There is no reason to worry about this, since even on shabbat it would be appropriate to pray all 18, but this was not required because of the extra effort it would require. We find, then, that he gains the full extra prayer. But when he erred and did not mention Rosh Chodesh, he has already prayed, so praying an additional time on Saturday evening will yield nothing.  And similarly, if he prayed a regular weekday amida at mincha on shabbat, and did not mention shabbat, it would seem that he should not pray again Saturday evening since he already said the amida. However, Rav Alfas [the Rif] does not seem to maintain this position, and in this case even though he does not gain anything he requires an extra prayer. To quote him: \"With regard to the statement 'make havdalah in the first one and not in the second one, and if you did not say havdalah in the first one but did say havdalah in the second one, the second counts but the first does not count', since he needed to say the second one first; since he did not say havdalah in the first one but said havdalah in the second one, he has shown his intention that the second one should be his normal prayer. Therefore, he must pray again another time for his make-up prayer so that the obligatory prayer precedes the make-up.  And if he said havdalah in both of them, even though he was not required to do so, he does not need to repeat. And if he did not say havdalah in either of them, we do not make him repeat, as we learn in a braita 'if on erred and did not say havdalah in He Who grants us wisdom, we do not make him repeat since he can say havdalah on the cup of wine'\".  Therefore, we require him to pray again even though he will not gain anything additional the second time. This is what Rabbi Moshe Malavar concluded from the words of Rabbi Alfas. "

                "If he says \"Bring salt\", he needs to repeat the blessing. - Because this is a distraction, and as we have learned, one who speaks between putting on the two tefillin needs to say another blessing (Menachot 36a). This is true too if one speaks between saying the blessing of Hamotzi and eating, or between kiddush and drinking, that one needs to repeat the blessing, unless it relates to something in the meal. The same too for ritual slaughter of animals, if one says after the blessing \"are there any more animals to slaughter\" or \"hold this tight\", the blessing does not need to be repeated. We do not have the practice to have salt on the table and no relish either, because our bread is refined, as we see in subsequent section of Talmud. Rabbi Menachem however was very scrupulous to have salt on the table. This relates to the following midrash: when Israel sit at the table and wait for each other to wash hands, Satan accuses them, but the covenant of salt (Leviticus 2:13) protects them."

                "Who hast sanctified us by His commandments, and hast commanded us to lay the Tefillin - since he starts by putting it on his arm, he should bless \"to lay,\" but on that of the head he blesses \"concerning the precept\" and not \"to lay,\" sind he already started and layed one of them. But in chapter Hakometz it says, \"if he did not talk he says one blessing, if he talked he says two blessings.\" Rashi explained that it says so on both Tefillin, that he says one blessing on both of them if he did not talk in between them, but it is difficult to say that the two blessings of \"to lay\" and \"concerning the precept\" were only needed when he talked and did a transgression. Therefore Rabbeinu Tam explained that on that of the head, which is the finishing of the commandment and the main part, because it has four compartments and the letter Shin, he says on it (an additional blessing of) \"on the precept,\" and this is (how it appears) in Shimusha Rabba, authored by the Ge'onim. And according to the explanation of Rabbeinu Tam regarding \"if he talked he says two blessings,\" (it refers to) if he puts on that of the head alone, since they (the two Tefillin) do not hold back each other  (from letting the wearer fulfill a commandment from it), he says two blessings. And this that the Gemara doesn't mention that on that of the head he says two blessings, it is because it is not at all common to place one without placing the other, since Tefillin by one with an obligation is common. And Rabbeinu Tam explained like this in his Responsa, and Rabbeinu Elchanan, in his \"Order of the enactment of prayer,\" wrote like this."
