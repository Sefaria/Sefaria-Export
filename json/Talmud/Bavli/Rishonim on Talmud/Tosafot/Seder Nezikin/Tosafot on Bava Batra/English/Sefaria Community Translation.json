A wall\":</b> Even though [this understanding] stands in the end, it said, \"they assumed,\" since this version is not the main one, due to the challenge from later. And that which it answers [that challenge] is a mere deflecting (not fully satisfying). But the law is like the second version, and so does Rabbenu Tam decide; and once it [used] the expression, \"They assumed,\" here - it also used it in the other version. And further (another answer is that) RI says that in the first chapter of Nedarim (11a), \"they assumed,\" is found even though it stands in the end and it concludes like it.",
                "<b>As it was taught in a baraita, \"A partition of a vineyard that was breached\":</b> There are texts that have the version, \"as it was taught in a mishnah.\" But Rabbenu Tam says that this is not a mishnah in any place. (However if that is so,) how did [the Gemara] conclude from it in [the chapter entitled] HaGozel Kamma (Bava Kamma 100a, ff.) that Rabbi Meir judges [with] the law of <i>garmi</i>. As if it were a mishnah, it would come out well, since an unspecified mishnah is [from] Rabbi Meir! So Rabbenu Tam says that it implied that it goes according to Rabbi Meir based on the force of [the] mishnah in Kilayim (7:4) that it brings there, \"One who causes his vine to overhang his fellow’s grain, the grain is rendered prohibited and he is liable for it.\" And that is an unspecified mishnah. Hence this too that is taught, \"it is rendered prohibited,\" is [from] Rabbi Meir. But we should not elaborate more here.",
                "<b>He may say to him, \"Build a partition\":</b> [Meaning] to the owner of the vineyard, and he is the damager. For the four ells' distance that they said to make is because of the work on the vineyard, as we said in the second chapter later (Bava Batra 26a). And [this is the case] even according to Rabbi Yose, who said later (Bava Batra 18b, 25b), it is upon the damaged to distance himself - behold, Rav Ashi said later (Bava Batra 25b), \"Rabbi Yose concedes in [the case] of his arrows (when the damager clearly causes the damage).\" And RI says that this is why it teaches, \"He may say to him, 'Build a partition'\"; and it does not teach, \"He is liable to build the partition: Since he must warn him. And if he does not warn him, he is not liable for the loss. And that is also why it twice [mentions], \"[If] it was breached, he may say to him, 'Build a partition.'\" [Because] even when it was breached the second time, he must [still] warn him. For he does not figure that he liable to build it all the time. But if it is breached a third time, RI was in doubt whether he must warn him all the time, or maybe he does not need to warn him any more. But Rabbenu Tam explains that this is why it [mentions it] twice: To have us understand that if there is an addition of a two hundredth between what [grew] during the first breach and what [grew] during the second breach - that they do not combine to create a prohibition; and they [start over] each time. And I elaborated [about this] in [the chapter entitled] HaGozel Kamma (Bava Kamma 100a, ff.) and in the chapter [entitled] BeMeh Eshah (Shabbat 65a.) "

But if he did not neglect and is occupied with it all the time, to build the partition, it is permitted, even though it added a two hundredth. It is as we learned in Tractate Kilayim (5:6), \"One who sees a vegetable in a vineyard, and said, 'When I reach it, I will pluck it,' it is permitted. [But if he says,] 'When I return, I will pluck it,' if [the vegetable] has increased by a two hundredth, it is forbidden.\" Hence when he is pursuing its plucking, it is permitted even when it adds a two hundredth. And it can be explained that the reason is because it is written (Deuteronomy 22:9), \"Do not plant in your vineyard forbidden mixtures\" - that which is similar to planting, such that it is pleasing to him.",

For behold, it is noticeable that it is a forbidden mixture when he sees the vines [crossing over] into the field. But one who spread impurity - even though we see the <i>sheretz</i> (a category of particularly impure animals) on the pure foods, it is not considered noticeable damage. As who knows if they were made susceptible [to absorb impurity]. However it should not be said that also [our case here] is damage that is not noticeable but that the [Sages] fined him - like with the one who spreads impurity (Gittin 53a), so that everyone not go and render the pure foods of his fellow impure. For here there is no concern for that, since the owner of the vineyard will also incur a loss. And also, if it was a fine, he should only be liable if it was volitional. "

And even though it says in Sanhedrin (72a) that a tunneling thief is judged according to his end. And Rava explains that this is because there is an assumption that a person would not stand by idly while his money is threatened [and therefore, the fact that the homeowner would defend himself will lead the thief to respond with violence...thus a thief coming to steal money is prepared to act violently] even so, we assess [the caravan attacked by bandits] according to wealth, sinc the bandits only want to seize money, and if the caravan does not defend itself, they bandits will not physically harm them. Therefore, this is not considered a situation of danger. But in the case of bandits, if the caravan comes to terms with them, the amount is assessed by wealth.

Why is the Talmud asking: what is the difference between the two versions? It is clear that they are explicitly arguing in the case where the specification as to where to write is missing. Furthermore we rule that we are concerned about unspecified deeds. If so how can he use the gift deed since he does not tell the witnesses to write it in the market outside. However, because these days it has been instituted to write in gift deeds: He told us to write it in the market and sign it outside, therefore even if he only told them to write it, he has in mind that it be written according to all rabbinical rules. But at the time of the Amoraim, they had not made this regulation, therefore he had to explicitly tell them to write it in public. And in the version of Rabenu Chanan'el it says that he told them not to sit in the open market, and this is considered unspecified, for he does not tell them to hide, but he tells them not to publicize it, and this is considered unspecified, not to publicize it, but not to hide. But if he simply tells them to write it, that is not unspecified, and is valid according to Rabenu Chanan'el. Therefore nowadays when the deed includes that he instructed the witnesses to write it in the market and sign it in the open, it is not a requirement, but only to improve the beauty of the deed. However the term unspecified does not seem to mean this. "

                "But here there is no possibility of repentance. And this is said specifically regrading the sexual sins that lead to no mamzer, but one who has intercourse with a married woman and gives birth from her, or from one of the other forbidden close relations, this is \"a crooked thing cannot be made straight\" (Eccl. 1:15) as it is said (Yevamot 21a) regarding teshuvah 'and behold Rabbi Chayim says that even though what is crooked cannot be made straight it is possible to do teshuvah as commanded by God, Who has commanded him to do teshuvah and sincerely repent, but a robber, whose teshuvah is dependent on returning what was stolen, as it is written \"and he returns what he stole, etc.\" (Lev. 5:23), how can one who stole from the public know exactly from whom he has stolen to return [the property]? And even though it is said 'let him pay with [the stolen goods] the needs of the community' (Baba Kamma 94b) in any instance it is not complete teshuvah."
