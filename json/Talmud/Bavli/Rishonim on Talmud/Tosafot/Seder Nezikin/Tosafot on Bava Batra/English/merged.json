                "<b>They assumed, \"What is a <i>mechitzah</i>? A wall\":</b> Even though [this understanding] stands in the end, it said, \"they assumed,\" since this version is not the main one, due to the challenge from later. And that which it answers [that challenge] is a mere deflecting (not fully satisfying). But the law is like the second version, and so does Rabbenu Tam decide; and once it [used] the expression, \"They assumed,\" here - it also used it in the other version. And further (another answer is that) RI says that in the first chapter of Nedarim (11a), \"they assumed,\" is found even though it stands in the end and it concludes like it.",
                "<b>As it was taught in a baraita, \"A partition of a vineyard that was breached\":</b> There are texts that have the version, \"as it was taught in a mishnah.\" But Rabbenu Tam says that this is not a mishnah in any place. (However if that is so,) how did [the Gemara] conclude from it in [the chapter entitled] HaGozel Kamma (Bava Kamma 100a, ff.) that Rabbi Meir judges [with] the law of <i>garmi</i>. As if it were a mishnah, it would come out well, since an unspecified mishnah is [from] Rabbi Meir! So Rabbenu Tam says that it implied that it goes according to Rabbi Meir based on the force of [the] mishnah in Kilayim (7:4) that it brings there, \"One who causes his vine to overhang his fellow’s grain, the grain is rendered prohibited and he is liable for it.\" And that is an unspecified mishnah. Hence this too that is taught, \"it is rendered prohibited,\" is [from] Rabbi Meir. But we should not elaborate more here.",
                "<b>He may say to him, \"Build a partition\":</b> [Meaning] to the owner of the vineyard, and he is the damager. For the four ells' distance that they said to make is because of the work on the vineyard, as we said in the second chapter later (Bava Batra 26a). And [this is the case] even according to Rabbi Yose, who said later (Bava Batra 18b, 25b), it is upon the damaged to distance himself - behold, Rav Ashi said later (Bava Batra 25b), \"Rabbi Yose concedes in [the case] of his arrows (when the damager clearly causes the damage).\" And RI says that this is why it teaches, \"He may say to him, 'Build a partition'\"; and it does not teach, \"He is liable to build the partition: Since he must warn him. And if he does not warn him, he is not liable for the loss. And that is also why it twice [mentions], \"[If] it was breached, he may say to him, 'Build a partition.'\" [Because] even when it was breached the second time, he must [still] warn him. For he does not figure that he liable to build it all the time. But if it is breached a third time, RI was in doubt whether he must warn him all the time, or maybe he does not need to warn him any more. But Rabbenu Tam explains that this is why it [mentions it] twice: To have us understand that if there is an addition of a two hundredth between what [grew] during the first breach and what [grew] during the second breach - that they do not combine to create a prohibition; and they [start over] each time. And I elaborated [about this] in [the chapter entitled] HaGozel Kamma (Bava Kamma 100a, ff.) and in the chapter [entitled] BeMeh Eshah (Shabbat 65a.) "

                "<b>[If] he neglected [it] and did not build a partition:</b> Specifically when he neglected [it]. But if he did not neglect and is occupied with it all the time, to build the partition, it is permitted, even though it added a two hundredth. It is as we learned in Tractate Kilayim (5:6), \"One who sees a vegetable in a vineyard, and said, 'When I reach it, I will pluck it,' it is permitted. [But if he says,] 'When I return, I will pluck it,' if [the vegetable] has increased by a two hundredth, it is forbidden.\" Hence when he is pursuing its plucking, it is permitted even when it adds a two hundredth. And it can be explained that the reason is because it is written (Deuteronomy 22:9), \"Do not plant in your vineyard forbidden mixtures\" - that which is similar to planting, such that it is pleasing to him.",
                "<b>And he is liable for the loss:</b> Even though damage that is not noticeable is not called damage (Gittin 53a). [As] it appears to RI that this is considered noticeable damage. For behold, it is noticeable that it is a forbidden mixture when he sees the vines [crossing over] into the field. But one who spread impurity - even though we see the <i>sheretz</i> (a category of particularly impure animals) on the pure foods, it is not considered noticeable damage. As who knows if they were made susceptible [to absorb impurity]. However it should not be said that also [our case here] is damage that is not noticeable but that the [Sages] fined him - like with the one who spreads impurity (Gittin 53a), so that everyone not go and render the pure foods of his fellow impure. For here there is no concern for that, since the owner of the vineyard will also incur a loss. And also, if it was a fine, he should only be liable if it was volitional. "

Hence it forces it and explains a <i>mechitzah</i> as [being] a division - even though a <i>mechitzah</i> is a wall in every [other] place.",
                "<b>And since they wished [to divide the courtyard], they build a wall in the center [even] against his will:</b> Later it is established [that this is a case] not subject to the law of division. But this is surprising to RI: As why did the teacher of our mishnah take [a case] not subject to the law of division, and teach, \"who wished?\" He should [more simply] speak about [a case] subject to the law of division. And he answered that we learn to deduce that I might have [otherwise] said that when it is not subject to the law of division, he would find to say, \"It was on condition not to make a [bona fide] wall. I did not concede to you to make a wall.\" And there are some texts that explicitly ask and answer this at the end of the discussion."

And even though, even if they did not wish [a bordermark], they also make a bordermark against their will, as shown adjacently - as it says, \"Is it not with a wall? No with a bordermark\" - that means an inferior bordermark. But if they wanted [a bordermark], they must make a bordermark from non-chiseled stone or chiseled stone in accordance with the regional custom. And that is called a bordermark because it is full of windows - as it is explained in the Arukh - and it does not protect from damage to visual privacy. And also (another possibility is) because it is not ten handbreadths high, as is shown later concerning a roof that is adjacent to a courtyard. As Rav Nachman said, \"He makes a parapet for it ten handbreadths high.\" And it challenges, \"For what? If it is for damage to visual privacy, we need four ells; and if it is for [one crossing it to] be caught like a thief, a bordermark is enough! But [Rashi] explained that, \"who wished,\" is referring to the splitting. But that is a wonder! As behold [the Gemara] concludes that a <i>mechitzah</i> is a wall; for if it were a division, it should have said, \"Who wished to divide.\" Moreover, how could one find to say that I would have said it is with a mere bordermark? Behold, we understand [otherwise] from the end [of the mishnah] (Bava Batra 11a)! As it taught, \"But when both of them wish [to divide it], they may divide it, even if it is less than this.\" And that is at least with a [more solid] bordermark. Moreover, how could one find to say, \"With a mere bordermark?\" Behold it is explicitly taught in our mishnah, \"non-chiseled stone or chiseled stone.\""

                "They collect according to the wealth of each individual: Since there is no life-threatening danger, we do not assess according to wealth. And this is also true in the last chapter of Bava Kamma (116b): A caravan traveling in the desert, and a troop of bandits stood over it, we assess according to wealth, for there is not danger to life since in the troop is attacking only for money. And even though it says in Sanhedrin (72a) that a tunneling thief is judged according to his end. And Rava explains that this is because there is an assumption that a person would not stand by idly while his money is threatened [and therefore, the fact that the homeowner would defend himself will lead the thief to respond with violence...thus a thief coming to steal money is prepared to act violently] even so, we assess [the caravan attacked by bandits] according to wealth, sinc the bandits only want to seize money, and if the caravan does not defend itself, they bandits will not physically harm them. Therefore, this is not considered a situation of danger. But in the case of bandits, if the caravan comes to terms with them, the amount is assessed by wealth. But when people get lost in the wilderness, it says there that the assessment is per capita, since when people get lost, there is danger to life. "

                "A different version: Rav Yosef says that he did not tell them to sit.... This version is difficult for the Ri. Why is the Talmud asking: what is the difference between the two versions? It is clear that they are explicitly arguing in the case where the specification as to where to write is missing. Furthermore we rule that we are concerned about unspecified deeds. If so how can he use the gift deed since he does not tell the witnesses to write it in the market outside. However, because these days it has been instituted to write in gift deeds: He told us to write it in the market and sign it outside, therefore even if he only told them to write it, he has in mind that it be written according to all rabbinical rules. But at the time of the Amoraim, they had not made this regulation, therefore he had to explicitly tell them to write it in public. And in the version of Rabenu Chanan'el it says that he told them not to sit in the open market, and this is considered unspecified, for he does not tell them to hide, but he tells them not to publicize it, and this is considered unspecified, not to publicize it, but not to hide. But if he simply tells them to write it, that is not unspecified, and is valid according to Rabenu Chanan'el. Therefore nowadays when the deed includes that he instructed the witnesses to write it in the market and sign it in the open, it is not a requirement, but only to improve the beauty of the deed. However the term unspecified does not seem to mean this. "

Since we concluded in the tractate of Holiday Offerings (page 10A) that oaths can be annuled from the pasuk \"that I swore in my anger\" (psalms 95:11) the Gemarah explains that one can annul it for oneself. \"Since I swore in my anger, I can nullify the vow (ibid.).\" We see from here that one can annul one's own vows. However, this doesn't make sense because it says \"One can't go back on one's word.\" (Numbers 30:3) We learn from here that even a scholar can't go back on his own vow (tractate of Promises page 21B). It says in chapter four of the tractate of Promises (page 23A) that there was a launderer who dissolved his vow, but this doesn't mean that he dissolved it himself. Rather that he found a way for its dissolution that was then carried out by the Rabbinic authorities."
