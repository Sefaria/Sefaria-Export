                "\"It dies first.\" But we have learned in Perek \"Behemah Hamaksheh\" (Hullin 74a) that in the case of one who slaughters an animal and finds a live 9-month old, there is a distinction between 'died' and 'killed,' as it says in Arachin 7a: \"But it also said ...",
                "If you say : if so, the embryo should inherit and cause to inherit, in the situation of a woman who started to give birth and died first",
                "One could respond: Yes, indeed! And it specifies a one day old because it rules that it inherits and causes to inherit, but an embryo it does not rule this way.",
                "However, one who kills \"a one day old\" is liable since it is taught, but not an embryo. That is, even if she was killed or started to give birth until the head came out, as is taught in Ohalot 7:6. And it brings in \"Ben Sorer UMoreh\" (Sanhedrin 72b): \"A woman who is having difficulty giving birth, one cuts the embryo. Once the head has emerged, we do not set aside one life for another.\"",
                "But it is possible that specifically when the mother is alive that the one who kills it is not liable until the head emerges, since it depends on the mother's life. But when she has died, one is liable, because it is like it is placed in a cup.",
                "And if you say: If you say it is permissible to kill it in utero even if the mother died, and it is not like it is placed in a cup,",
                "Then [I would ask]: why do we desecrate the Shabbat for it, that we can bring a knife through public property, to cut the mother, as is proved in Arachin 7b.",
                "One could reply: nevertheless for saving a life we desecrate Shabbat,even though it is permitted to kill it, since \"dying at the hands of a person\" (e.g. condemned to death by a court) one who kills him is exempt (Sanhedrin 78a) since most dying people are [going] to death. And we desecrate Shabbat for him (Yoma 84b) since with saving a life, we don't follow the rule of \"majority\"."
