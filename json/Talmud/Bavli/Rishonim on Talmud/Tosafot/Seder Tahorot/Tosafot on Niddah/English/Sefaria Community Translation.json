                "Matni' Me'et le'et - it is explained in the gemara that [foods retroactively declared impure] are suspended, neither eaten nor burnt, and this concerns only sanctified foods (Kodashim or Teruma[ - the distinction will be explained elsewhere]), but as for mundane foods (Chullin), all agree that she only renders them impure from the moment she saw blood (Daya sha'ata) for we establish her in presumption of purity (Chezkat tahara). And if you ask why this doubt of retroactive impurity, differs from all other doubts of impurity in the private domain (Reshut hayachid) which are [rendered] unambiguously impure even for chullin foods and are not held in chezkat tahara, it is because we learn (below, page 3a) from a woman presumed adulterous (Sotah)"
