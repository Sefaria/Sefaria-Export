            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Everyone substitutes</b> a non-sacred animal for a consecrated animal, <b>both men and women.</b> That is <b>not</b> to say <b>that it is permitted for a person to effect substitution; rather,</b> it means <b>that if one substituted</b> a non-sacred animal for a consecrated animal, <b>the substitution takes effect,</b> and the non-sacred animal becomes consecrated, and the consecrated animal remains sacred. <b>And</b> the one who substituted the non-sacred animal <b>incurs the forty [<i>sofeg et ha’arba’im</i>]</b> lashes.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara <b>notes</b> an apparent contradiction in the mishna: <b>This</b> mishna <b>itself</b> is <b>difficult: You say</b> that <b>everyone substitutes</b> a non-sacred animal for a consecrated one, which indicates that substitution may be performed <b><i>ab initio</i>. And then you teach:</b> That is <b>not</b> to say <b>that it is permitted for a person to effect substitution; rather,</b> it means only <b>that if one</b> unlawfully <b>substituted</b> a non-sacred animal for a consecrated animal, <b>the substitution takes effect,</b> indicating that it is effective only <b>after the fact.</b>",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>And can you understand</b> the phrase: <b>Everyone substitutes,</b> as indicating that substitution may be performed <b><i>ab initio</i>?</b> If so, <b>before the mishna poses a difficulty for you, the verse should pose a difficulty for you, as it is written: “He shall not alter it, nor substitute it”</b> (Leviticus 27:10). The verse clearly states that it is prohibited to perform substitution.",
            "<b>Rather, Rav Yehuda says: This</b> is what the mishna <b>is teaching: Everyone can apply</b> the status of a consecrated animal to a non-sacred animal <b>by</b> the act of <b>substitution, both men and women.</b> But that is <b>not</b> to say <b>that it is permitted for a person to effect substitution, as, if</b> one <b>did effect substitution,</b> the <b>substitution takes effect</b> only after the fact, <b>and he incurs the forty</b> lashes.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: Everyone substitutes a non-sacred animal for a consecrated animal. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does the comprehensive term: <b>Everyone,</b> serve <b>to include?</b> The Gemara answers: It serves <b>to include an inheritor, and</b> accordingly, this mishna is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>",
            "<b>As we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>An inheritor</b> who inherited a consecrated animal <b>places</b> his <b>hands</b> on the head of the offering when he sacrifices it as would the original owner, and likewise <b>an inheritor is able to substitute</b> a non-sacred animal for the consecrated one that he inherited. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: An inheritor does not place</b> his <b>hands</b> on the head of the offering when he sacrifices it, <b>and an inheritor does not substitute</b> a non-sacred animal for a consecrated one that he inherited. These acts may be performed only by the one who initially consecrated the animal. The mishna indicates that an inheritor is able to effect substitution, contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>He derives</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>the</b> animal’s <b>initial consecration from the end of the consecration,</b> i.e., the sacrifice of the consecrated animal, as follows: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>the end of a consecrated</b> animal, <b>an inheritor does not place</b> his <b>hands</b> on the head of the offering before slaughter, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>the initial consecration, an inheritor does not effect substitution</b> to consecrate the animal.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> of <b>placing hands itself?</b> The Gemara answers: The term <b>“his offering” is written three</b> times in the passage discussing a peace offering, in connection with the placing of hands (Leviticus 3:2, 8, 12). <b>One</b> instance teaches that the requirement of placing hands applies to <b>his offering but not the offering of a gentile. And one</b> instance teaches that it applies to <b>his offering but not the offering of another,</b> as only the owner places his hands on the offering. <b>And one</b> instance teaches that it applies to <b>his offering but not the offering of his father,</b> as an inheritor does not place his hands on an offering he inherited.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But according to Rabbi Meir, who said</b> that <b>an inheritor places</b> his <b>hands</b> on the head of the offering when he sacrifices it, <b>isn’t</b> the term <b>“his offering” written</b> in the verse? How does he interpret the third instance of that term? The Gemara explains: <b>He requires that</b> term <b>to include all joint owners [<i>ba’alei ḥoverin</i>] in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>placing hands,</b> to teach that they all must place their hands on the offering’s head.",
            "The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Yehuda, he does not accept</b> that <b>joint owners</b> are included in the requirement of <b>placing hands. What is the reason</b> for this? The reason is <b>that their offering is not specific</b> to one person and is therefore not included in the term “his offering.” <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>actually, he accepts</b> that one instance of “his offering” serves to include joint owners, <b>and he derives</b> both the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the offering of a gentile and</b> that of <b>the offering of another from one verse,</b> so <b>that one</b> instance of the term “his offering” <b>remains for him to</b> include <b>joint owners in</b> the requirement of <b>placing hands</b> on the head of an offering, and the third instance serves to teach that an inheritor does not place hands on the offering of his father.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reasoning</b> of <b>Rabbi Meir, who said</b> that <b>an inheritor</b> can <b>effect substitution?</b> The Gemara answers: Rabbi Meir could <b>say to you</b> that the repetition of the verb in the verse: “And <b>if he shall at all substitute [<i>hamer yamir</i>]</b> animal for animal” (Leviticus 27:10), serves <b>to include the inheritor.</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>And he derives</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>the end of a consecrated</b> animal <b>from the initial consecration</b> of the animal, as follows: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>the initial</b> state of <b>consecration</b> of the animal, <b>an inheritor</b> can <b>effect substitution, so too,</b> with regard to <b>the end of the consecrated</b> animal, <b>an inheritor places</b> his <b>hands</b> on its head.",
            "The Gemara asks: According to <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that an inheritor is not able to effect substitution, <b>what does he do with this</b> repetitive language in the verse: <b>“And if he shall at all substitute”?</b> How does he interpret it? The Gemara answers: It serves <b>to include a woman</b> as able to effect substitution and to incur the penalty of forty lashes for doing so. <b>And</b> this is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Since</b> the verses concerning <b>the entire matter</b> of substitution <b>speak only in the masculine, as it is stated: “He shall not exchange it, nor substitute it”</b> (Leviticus 27:10), <b>from where</b> is it derived that <b>a woman</b> is included? <b>The verse states: “And if he shall at all substitute,” to include a woman.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Rabbi Meir,</b> who derives a different <i>halakha</i> from that verse, <b>from where</b> does <b>he</b> derive that <b>a woman</b> is included? The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> the addition of the conjunction “and” in the verse: <b>“And if</b> he shall at all substitute.” <b>And Rabbi Yehuda does not interpret</b> the term <b>“and if”</b> as having any special significance.",
            "The Gemara analyzes this dispute. <b>And</b> according to <b>both</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir and</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, the reason</b> why a woman is included is <b>that the verse</b> explicitly <b>includes a woman,</b> either by adding a conjunction or by repetition of the verb. The Gemara asks: Should one infer that if <b>the verse did not include</b> a woman, <b>I would say</b> that <b>when</b> a woman <b>performs</b> an act of <b>substitution she is not flogged? But didn’t Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Rav says, and so too the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught,</b> that when the verse states: <b>“When a man or woman shall commit any sin that people commit”</b> (Numbers 5:6), <b>the verse equates a woman with a man with regard to all punishments of the Torah?</b> Why, then, is there a need for the verse to include women in the prohibition against substitution?",
            "The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary</b> for the verse to include women specifically, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>this statement</b> that equates women with men in general refers only to <b>a punishment that</b> applies <b>equally to an individual and to the public. But here, since it is a punishment that does not</b> apply <b>equally to all, as we learned</b> in a mishna (13a): <b>The public and partners do not render</b> an animal <b>a substitute,</b> one could claim that <b>a woman as well, when she performs</b> an act of substitution, <b>is not flogged.</b> The verse therefore <b>teaches us</b> that she is in fact liable.",
            "§ <b>Rami bar Ḥama raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>a minor, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is he able <b>to effect substitution</b> or not? The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances</b> where this question arises? <b>If we say</b> that it is referring <b>to a minor who has yet to reach the age of</b> responsibility for his <b>vows,</b> i.e., twelve years and one day, <b>you should not raise the dilemma, as since he cannot consecrate</b> an animal by means of a vow, <b>can he effect substitution? Rather, when he raises this dilemma,</b> it is <b>with regard to a minor who has reached the age of</b> responsibility for his <b>vows.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains the dilemma: <b>Do we say</b> that a minor can effect substitution, <b>since the Master said</b> with regard to consecration: The verse states: “When <b>a man</b> shall clearly utter a vow” (Numbers 30:3). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> the unusual formulation: <b>Shall clearly utter [<i>yafli</i>] a vow,</b> instead of the more conventional term: Shall take a vow [<i>yiddor</i>]? This serves <b>to include a discriminating</b> minor <b>[<i>mufla</i>] on the brink of adulthood,</b> teaching <b>that his consecration takes effect.</b> Perhaps, from the fact <b>that he can consecrate</b> an animal, <b>he can also effect substitution. Or perhaps, since no</b> minor <b>is subject to punishments, he cannot apply</b> sanctity to an animal <b>by</b> an act of <b>substitution,</b> which would incur a punishment.",
            "And even <b>if you say</b> that <b>a minor can perform substitution, as he will come to</b> an age when he is <b>subject to punishments, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> as to whether <b>a gentile</b> can <b>effect substitution? Do you say</b> that he can do so from the fact <b>that his consecration takes effect, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“Any man [<i>ish ish</i>]…</b>that brings his offering.” <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> repetitively <b>“<i>ish ish</i>”?</b> This serves <b>to include gentiles,</b> teaching <b>that they</b> can <b>take vows</b> to bring <b>vow offerings and gift offerings as a Jew</b> can. Since the consecration of a gentile takes effect, perhaps <b>he can effect substitution as well. Or perhaps, since he will not come to</b> a time when he is <b>subject to punishments,</b> therefore <b>when he performs</b> an act of <b>substitution,</b> the animal is <b>not consecrated.</b>",
            "<b>Rava says: Come</b> and <b>hear, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Zevaḥim</i> 5:6): With regard to animals <b>consecrated by gentiles,</b> one <b>may not derive benefit</b> from them <i>ab initio</i>, <b>but</b> if one derived benefit from them, he is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property after the fact. <b>And</b> if one consumes <b>them one is not liable for</b> committing a transgression <b>with regard to</b> the prohibitions of <b><i>piggul</i></b> if they were sacrificed with the intent to consume them beyond their designated time, of <b><i>notar</i></b> if he consumed them beyond their designated time, <b>and</b> of consuming <b>ritually impure</b> offerings if he was impure. Gentiles <b>cannot render</b> a non-sacred animal <b>a substitute</b> for one they consecrate. <b>And one does not bring libations for</b> the offerings of a gentile as independent offerings, <b>but his offering requires libations.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Yosei said: With regard to all of them I see</b> fit <b>to be stringent. In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that Rabbi Shimon exempts animals consecrated by gentiles from liability for misuse, <b>said?</b> It is said <b>with regard to</b> animals <b>consecrated for the altar,</b> i.e., offerings; <b>but with regard to</b> animals <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance,</b> one who derives benefit from <b>them</b> is liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property. Rava notes: <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that gentiles <b>cannot render</b> an animal <b>a substitute</b> for his offering.",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>And Rami bar Ḥama</b> can say: <b>I do not raise a dilemma</b> in a case <b>where a gentile consecrated</b> an animal as an offering <b>for a gentile</b> such as himself <b>to achieve atonement.</b> In this case the <i>baraita</i> rules explicitly that he cannot effect substitution. <b>When I raise the dilemma,</b> it is in a case <b>where a gentile consecrated</b> an animal as an offering <b>and a Jew achieves atonement</b> with it. In this situation, <b>do we follow</b> the <b>one who consecrated</b> it, in which case the gentile cannot effect substitution, <b>or do we follow the one achieving atonement,</b> in which case he can?",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Solve this</b> dilemma <b>by</b> invoking a statement <b>of Rabbi Abbahu, as Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If <b>one consecrates</b> an animal as an offering to be brought by another, and the animal develops a blemish disqualifying it for sacrifice, if the one who consecrated it desires to redeem it, he <b>adds one-fifth</b> to its value, just as he would were it his own offering. By contrast, if the one achieving atonement with the offering desires to redeem it, he does not need to add one-fifth. <b>But the one achieving atonement</b> with the offering <b>can render</b> another animal <b>a substitute</b> for it as if he had consecrated it. <b>And</b> if <b>one separates <i>teruma</i>,</b> the portion of produce designated for a priest, <b>from his own</b> produce"
        ],
        [
            "<b>for</b> the purpose of exempting the produce <b>of another, the benefit of discretion</b> as to which priest or Levite will receive it <b>is his.</b> Apparently, the <i>halakhot</i> of substitution follow the one achieving atonement.",
            "Rami bar Ḥama could <b>say to</b> this: <b>There,</b> in Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement, the offering <b>comes on behalf of</b> the <b>Jew</b> who consecrated it. <b>Due to that</b> reason, <b>we follow</b> the <b>one atoning, and</b> during both the <b>initial</b> consecration of the offering <b>and its ultimate</b> sacrifice the animal <b>is in the possession of a Jew,</b> who is able to effect substitution. <b>But here,</b> where a gentile consecrated the animal, <b>this is how he raises the dilemma: Do we require that from the initial</b> consecration of the offering <b>until the ultimate</b> act of sacrifice <b>it</b> must <b>be in the possession of one who</b> is able to <b>effect substitution</b> or not? The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand [<i>teiku</i>]</b> unresolved.",
            "§ <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> cited on the previous <i>amud</i>: With regard to animals <b>consecrated by gentiles,</b> one <b>may not derive benefit</b> <i>ab initio</i>, <b>but</b> if one benefited from them after the fact, he is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property. The Gemara explains: The <i>halakha</i> that one <b>may not benefit</b> from them <i>ab initio</i> is <b>by rabbinic law. And</b> that <i>halakha</i> that if one benefited from them after the fact <b>he is not</b> liable for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property is <b>by Torah law.</b>",
            "<b>What is the reason</b> that one is not liable for misuse? <b>As it is written</b> with regard to misuse of consecrated property: <b>“If anyone commit a trespass, and sin through error,</b> in the holy items of the Lord” (Leviticus 5:15). <b>And we derive</b> a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the use of the word <b>“sin”</b> in this verse and the word <b>“sin”</b> used in the context of <b><i>teruma</i>:</b> “They shall therefore keep My charge, lest they bear sin for it” (Leviticus 22:9). <b>And with regard to <i>teruma</i> it is written</b> explicitly: “Even of all the hallowed items of <b>the children of Israel”</b> (Numbers 18:8), from which one can infer: <b>But not</b> of <b>gentiles.</b> The <i>halakhot</i> of misuse as well, therefore, do not apply to animals consecrated by gentiles.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> if one consumes <b>them,</b> i.e., animals consecrated by gentiles, <b>one is not liable for</b> committing a transgression, <b>with regard to</b> the prohibitions of <b><i>piggul</i>, <i>notar</i>, or</b> consuming offerings while <b>ritually impure.</b> The source for this is a verse, <b>as it is written with regard to ritual impurity: “Speak to Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy items of the children of Israel,</b> which they hallow unto Me, <b>and that they profane not</b> My holy <b>name”</b> (Leviticus 22:2). This verse explicitly mentions items consecrated by the children of Israel, to emphasize that the <i>halakha</i> of distancing oneself from consecrated items while in a state of ritual impurity does not include items consecrated by gentiles.",
            "<b>And one derives</b> the exemption from <b><i>notar</i></b> by drawing a verbal analogy <b>between</b> the word <b>“profane”</b> used in the context of <i>notar</i> and the word <b>“profane”</b> used in the context of <b>ritual impurity. As it is written</b> in the verse cited above <b>with regard to ritual impurity:</b> “That they separate themselves from the holy items of <b>the children of Israel,</b> which they hallow unto Me, <b>and that they profane not</b> My holy name.” <b>And it is written with regard to <i>notar</i>: “But every one that eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has profaned the holy item of the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 19:8). Since the prohibition against consuming consecrated items while impure does not apply to the offerings of gentiles, neither does the prohibition of <i>notar</i>.",
            "<b>And</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>derives</b> the gentiles’ exemption from <b><i>piggul</i></b> by verbal analogy <b>between</b> the word <b>“iniquity”</b> used in the context of <i>piggul</i> and the word <b>“iniquity”</b> used in the context of <b><i>notar</i>, as it is written with regard to <i>piggul</i>: “And the soul that eats of it shall bear his iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 7:18), <b>and it is written with regard to <i>notar</i>: “But everyone that eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has profaned the holy item of the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 19:8). <b>And</b> based on these two verbal analogies, one concludes that with regard to <b>all of them,</b> i.e., <i>piggul</i>, <i>notar</i>, and ritually impure offerings, the prohibition against consumption applies only to offerings of <b>the children of Israel, but not</b> to those of <b>gentiles.</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> a gentile <b>cannot render</b> a non-sacred animal <b>a substitute</b> for one he has consecrated. The Gemara cites the source for this <i>halakha</i>: <b>As it is written</b> with regard to substitutions: <b>“He shall not exchange it, nor substitute</b> it” (Leviticus 27:10), <b>and it is written at the beginning of the matter: “Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: When a man shall clearly utter a vow</b> of persons to the Lord, <b>according to your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:2). Since the passage specifically addresses the children of Israel, the <i>halakhot</i> of substitution apply only to them, not to gentiles.",
            "The Gemara presents <b>another version</b> of the source for this <i>halakha</i>: The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>And</b> a gentile <b>cannot render</b> a non-sacred animal <b>a substitute</b> for one he has consecrated. <b>What is the reason?</b> The reason is <b>that</b> the <b>substitution of</b> consecrated <b>animals is juxtaposed with the animal tithe</b> (see Leviticus 27:32), <b>and the animal tithe</b> is juxtaposed <b>with the grain tithe. And with regard to the grain tithe it is written: “For the tithe of the children of Israel, which they set apart as a gift to the Lord,</b> I have given to the Levites for an inheritance” (Numbers 18:24), indicating that the <i>halakhot</i> of the grain tithe apply only to the <b>children of Israel, but not</b> to <b>gentiles.</b> From the juxtapositions, one derives that the same holds for substitution.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And one does not bring libations</b> for a gentile as an independent offering, <b>but his offering requires libations.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? They are derived from a verse, <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to libations: “All that are <b>homeborn</b> shall do these after this manner, in presenting an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the Lord” (Numbers 15:13). One who is <b>homeborn,</b> i.e., a Jew, <b>brings libations, but a gentile does not bring libations.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that a gentile’s <b>burnt offering should not require libations;</b> therefore, <b>the verse states: “So</b> shall it be done for each bull, or for each ram, or for each of the lambs, or of the goats” (Numbers 15:10–11). This teaches that every burnt offering, even that of a gentile, requires libations.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yosei said: I see</b> the logic of the opinion that <b>in all of</b> these cases it is correct <b>to be stringent</b> about the offerings of gentiles. The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason? With regard to</b> the offering of a gentile, <b>it is written:</b> “Whosoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that brings his offering, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their gift offerings, which are brought <b>to the Lord</b> for a burnt offering” (Leviticus 22:18). The verse equates the offerings of gentiles, “the strangers in Israel,” with those of Jews, and indicates that the consecrated status of the former is identical to that of the latter.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said <b>with regard to</b> animals <b>consecrated for the altar, but with regard to</b> animals <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance,</b> one who benefits <b>from them</b> is liable for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property. The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason?</b> The reason is <b>that when we learn</b> that items consecrated by gentiles are not subject to liability for <b>misuse</b> by the verbal analogy between the word <b>sin</b> and another instance of the word <b>sin from</b> the context of <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> this applies only to consecrated property that is <b>similar to <i>teruma</i>, which is consecrated</b> with <b>inherent sanctity. But with regard to</b> an item that has the <b>sanctity of the Temple maintenance, whose sanctity</b> inheres in its <b>value,</b> as it will ultimately be sold and the proceeds used for Temple maintenance, the analogy does <b>not</b> apply.",
            "§ The mishna teaches that one who effects substitution receives lashes. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>any prohibition in the Torah,</b> if one <b>performed an action</b> to transgress <b>it,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to receive lashes. But if he <b>did not perform an action</b> to transgress <b>it,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from receiving lashes.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But is</b> it an established <b>principle that</b> one who transgresses <b>a prohibition that does not involve an action</b> is <b>exempt? But there is</b> the prohibition of <b>substitution, which is a prohibition that does not involve an action, and</b> one is <b>flogged</b> for transgressing it, <b>as we learned</b> in the mishna: That is <b>not</b> to say <b>that it is permitted for</b> a person <b>to effect substitution; rather,</b> it means <b>that if one substituted</b> a non-sacred animal for a consecrated animal, <b>the substitution takes effect, and</b> the one who substituted the non-sacred animal <b>incurs the forty</b> lashes.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rav</b> could have <b>said to you:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna written? <b>It is</b> in accordance with that opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who said:</b> With regard to <b>a prohibition that does not involve an action, one is flogged for</b> transgressing <b>it.</b> The Rabbis, however, disagree.",
            "The Gemara counters: <b>But can you establish the mishna</b> as being <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda?

            "<b>Rabbi Abbahu objects to this</b> explanation of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of the <b>false oath</b> under discussion? <b>If we say that</b> the one taking the oath <b>said:</b> I take an oath <b>that I will not eat</b> a certain item, <b>and he</b> then <b>ate</b> that item; <b>there he performed an action</b> to violate his oath by eating the item, and the prohibition would then involve an action. <b>And</b> if it was <b>rather</b> a case <b>where he said:</b> I take an oath <b>that I will eat</b> a certain item, <b>and he did not eat</b> that item; <b>is that</b> individual <b>flogged?

            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>he is not flogged, as it is a prohibition that does not involve an action, and one is not flogged for any prohibition that does not involve an action.

The first clause excludes from the punishment of lashes the passive violation of an oath pertaining to the future, and the latter clause includes in the obligation to bring an offering a false oath pertaining to the past if he uttered it unwittingly. Neither clause contradicts the explanation of Rabbi Abbahu.",
            "§ In listing those who incur the punishment of lashes even though they did not perform an action in their transgression, Rabbi Yosei HaGelili was cited above as including: <b>And one who effects substitution.</b> The Gemara adds: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to the <i>tanna</i></b> who would recite the <i>baraitot</i> in his academy: <b>Do not teach: And one who effects substitution,</b> in this regard, <b>because</b> one who effects substitution <b>performs an action</b> of consecration <b>by his speech.</b>",

            "<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one renounced ownership of his vineyard,</b> thereby exempting it from tithes and gifts to the poor, <b>and he rose early in the morning,</b> retook possession of it, <b>and harvested it, he is</b> still <b>obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>individual fallen</b> grapes left for the poor <b>[<i>peret</i>], and</b> in the mitzva of <b>incompletely formed clusters</b> of grapes left for the poor <b>[<i>olelot</i>],</b> and <b>in</b> the mitzva of <b>forgotten</b> clusters of grapes left for the poor, <b>and in</b> the mitzva of <b><i>pe’a</i>, but he</b> remains <b>exempt from the</b> mitzva to <b>tithe</b> his produce.

Rather, the clause <b>“his offering unto the Lord for his naziriteship”</b> is referring to a case <b>where he separated</b> an offering <b>from his own</b> animals, whereas the clause <b>“besides that for which his means suffice”</b> is referring to a case <b>where others separated</b> the offering <b>for him.</b> This teaches that designation by others is effective.",

            "The Gemara responds: The <i>baraita</i> is <b>not</b> referring <b>to substitution,</b> but to the matter of atonement. <b>And that which is difficult for you,</b> that it is obvious that the nazirite can atone by bringing an offering consecrated by another, as <b>they have given it to him as a gift,</b> this is in fact not obvious. <b>Had the Merciful One not included</b> an offering received from another by writing the clause <b>“besides that for which his means suffice,” I would say</b> that <b>it is a Torah edict</b> expressed in the term <b>“his offering,”</b> that a nazirite can <b>atone</b> only with an offering consecrated <b>from his own</b> animals, <b>but not</b> through one received <b>from</b> the animals <b>of others.</b> Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that he can atone even with an offering received from others.",

            "<b>Rabbi Akiva says: The <i>teruma</i> of neither of them is <i>teruma</i>.</b> Since each separated <i>teruma</i> independently, it is clear that neither accepts the separation of the other, and therefore neither is valid. <b>And the Rabbis say: If the first one separated <i>teruma</i> of</b> the correct <b>measure,</b> i.e., one-fiftieth of the produce, the produce is thereby tithed, and therefore <b>the <i>teruma</i> of the second is not <i>teruma</i>; but if</b> the first <b>did not separate <i>teruma</i> of</b> the correct <b>measure,</b> and he separated too little, <b>the <i>teruma</i> of the second is <i>teruma</i>.</b>",

            "<b>Rabbi Shimon said:</b> The fact that animals belonging to the community or partners do not render animals exchanged for them substitutes is derived as follows: The <b>animal tithe was</b> included <b>in</b> the <b>category</b> of all offerings, <b>and why was it</b> singled <b>out</b> in the verse: “And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be sacred unto the Lord.

It serves <b>to discuss</b> a special <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> the animal tithe, that of <b>substitution of its name.</b> If, when the animals emerge from the pen to be tithed, the one counting them errs and calls the tenth animal the ninth and the eleventh the tenth, they are both sanctified. The animal that actually emerges tenth is the animal tithe, while the eleventh animal is consecrated as a peace offering. <b>And</b> since this <i>halakha</i> of a substitution of its name applies only to the animal tithe, it is necessary <b>to</b> teach that the general <i>halakha</i> of <b>the substitution of its body,</b> i.e., regular substitution, applies to it as well.",
            "Furthermore, the verse <b>tells you</b> other <i>halakhot</i> unique to the animal tithe: An animal that is <b>the substitute of the name of</b> an animal tithe is <b>sacrificed</b> upon the altar as a peace offering, whereas <b>the substitute of its body is not sacrificed</b> at all. But for all other offerings, substitutes hold the same status as the animal for which they were substituted. Another difference is that <b>the substitute of the name of</b> an animal tithe is <b>redeemed</b> when it develops a blemish, like a peace offering, and the proceeds of the sale belong to the Temple treasury, whereas <b>the substitute of its body is not redeemed,</b> as it is stated with regard to the animal tithe: “Then both it and that for which it is substituted shall be sacred; it shall not be redeemed” (Leviticus 27:33).",
            "Finally, the sanctity of <b>the substitution of the body of</b> an animal tithe <b>takes effect upon</b> both <b>an item that is fit</b> for sacrifice upon the altar <b>and upon an item that is unfit</b> for sacrifice, e.g., a blemished animal, as the sanctity of the animal tithe can apply even to a blemished animal, <b>but the substitution of its name takes effect only upon an item that is fit</b> for sacrifice. If the animal that was mistakenly called the tenth is blemished, it is not consecrated.",
            "The Sages <b>say</b> in response to the statement of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: Simply <b>because the Merciful One includes</b> a unique <i>halakha</i> with regard to the animal tithe, <b>that it has the substitution of its name,</b> would one assume that it <b>is diminished,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> of regular substitution does not apply to it? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> one can make such a claim, <b>as we say:</b> That <b>which</b> the verse <b>included</b> with regard to a particular <i>halakha</i>, <b>it included, and</b> that <b>which it did not include, it did not include.</b> Since the passage initially addresses substitution of name solely with regard to the animal tithe, one could assume that this is the only substitution that applies to it.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And from where would this be derived,</b> that in this case we should assume only that which is specifically mentioned? <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said:</b> This is derived <b>since</b> this is a case of <b>a matter,</b> i.e., the animal tithe, <b>where</b> the Torah <b>comes to discuss a novel matter,</b> i.e., substitution of name, <b>and</b> as a rule, in such cases the object of discussion <b>has only its novelty,</b> and one cannot infer the applicability of additional principles.

            "Rava adds: <b>And</b> this qualification mentioned by Rabbi Shimon <b>is necessary only to</b> exclude <b>a burnt offering that came from surplus</b> funds. For example, if one set aside a certain sum of money for a sin offering or a guilt offering, and after purchasing his animal some of the money remained, he must purchase a burnt offering with that money. The <i>halakha</i> of substitution does not apply to such an animal.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: The Sages disputed the use of surplus money.

            "As explained earlier (9b), Rabbi Avin’s dilemma was first posed <b>with regard to two bodies,</b> i.e., two different animals, <b>and one</b> type of <b>sanctity,</b> e.g., in a case where one separated an animal as a guilt offering, and he effected substitution for it, and the animal he separated as a guilt offering developed a blemish and he redeemed it with another animal, which assumed the same status of a guilt offering. <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> as to whether one can substitute for this replacement? Do we say that since it is a different animal from the one for which he initially effected substitution, the second substitution is effective? Or perhaps, since it possesses the same sanctity as the original animal, one cannot effect substitution for it.",
            "<b>And</b> then Rabbi Avin further asked: <b>If you say</b> that in the above case one cannot effect substitution for the animal, perhaps this is only because the two animals possess <b>one sanctity.

For example, if one consecrated a guilt offering and effected substitution for it, and he subsequently lost it and atoned using another animal, and he then found it again, such that the original animal must now be consigned to be sacrificed as a burnt offering, does one say that since the animal now possesses a different sanctity he can effect further substitution for it?

            "<b>And</b> the Gemara notes that both verses are <b>necessary, as if the Merciful One had written</b> only the verse: <b>“Beside the <i>Shabbatot</i> of the Lord,” I would say</b> that <b>on the day</b> following Shabbat, <b>yes,</b> one may bring the offerings, <b>but on the night</b> after Shabbat, <b>no,</b> one may not bring them, just as the offering itself could not have been brought at night.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And libations, may they be sacrificed at night?

            "With regard to Rav Yosef’s claim that the item: Meal offering that accompanies the libations, should be removed from the <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara states: <b>When Rav Dimi ascended</b> from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael, <b>he found Rav Yirmeya sitting and saying in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: From where</b> is it derived that <b>libations that come with</b> an animal <b>offering may be sacrificed only in the day?

            "Before resolving the difficulty, the Gemara further discusses the prohibition of writing down the Torah: <b>Rabbi Yehuda bar Naḥmani, the disseminator for Reish Lakish, expounded</b> as follows: <b>One verse says: “Write you these words,” and one verse says,</b> i.e., it states later in that same verse: <b>“For by the mouth of these words”</b> (Exodus 34:27).

            "<b>They said</b> in response to the question of how Rav Dimi could propose writing down the <i>halakha</i> in a letter: <b>Perhaps</b> with regard to <b>a new matter</b> it <b>is different,</b> i.e., it might be permitted to write down new material so that it not be forgotten. One proof for this suggestion is <b>that Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish</b> would <b>read from a scroll of <i>aggada</i>,</b> containing the words of the Sages, <b>on Shabbat.

            "With regard to the last <i>halakha</i>, <b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Dimi, when he cited this statement in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>But let the Master say</b> that the phrase “and your peace offerings” serves to include the <b>peace offering</b> that is brought together with <b>a Paschal offering.</b> This offering is sacrificed on the fourteenth of Nisan by a large group of people when they will not receive enough meat from their Paschal offering to feed them all. The suggested derivation from the verse is that if a peace offering separated for this purpose was not sacrificed on the fourteenth of Nisan, it may be brought during the intermediate days of the Festival. Abaye further adds: It is more reasonable to include this peace offering, <b>as, if</b> the verse is referring to <b>the peace offering of a nazirite, it is</b> already included by the verse in the categories of offerings that are <b>vowed or contributed</b> voluntarily.",
            "Abaye elaborates: <b>As isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>This is the principle: Any</b> offering <b>that is vowed or contributed</b> voluntarily, e.g., a burnt offering or a peace offering, <b>is sacrificed on a private altar.

If so, there is no need for it to be included separately by the verse. Rav Dimi replied to Abaye: <b>Delete</b> the phrase: Offering of <b>a nazirite from here,</b> i.e., from the <i>baraita</i> that considers it an offering that is vowed or contributed voluntarily. Only the nazirite vow itself is classified as voluntary; once the vow has been uttered, the ensuing offerings are obligatory.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Is there one who said that</b> the offering of <b>a nazirite is not vowed or contributed</b> voluntarily? <b>But isn’t it written: “And it came to pass at the end of forty years, that Absalom said to the king: Please let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to the Lord, in Hebron.

The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>What, is it not</b> the case that Absalom asked his father for permission for him to go to Hebron <b>to</b> sacrifice <b>an offering</b> on a private altar?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> Absalom did not go to Hebron to sacrifice his nazirite offerings.

            "<b>Rav Aḥa said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rabba bar Rav Ḥanan</b> who said: The verse means that <b>Absalom went to Hebron only</b> in order <b>to bring sheep</b> specifically from there.

            "The Gemara rejects Rabba bar Rav Ḥanan’s answer: <b>But rather, what</b> is our explanation of the verse? That Absalom went <b>to bring sheep from Hebron?</b> If so, <b>this</b> verse that states: “Please let me go and pay my vow, <b>which I have vowed to the Lord, in Hebron”</b> (II Samuel 15:7), <b>should</b> instead <b>have</b> stated: Which I have vowed to the Lord <b>from Hebron.</b>",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>From where does Rav Pappa derive this</b> statement? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>because it is written: “Your sons shall be instead of your fathers”</b> (Psalms 45:17), i.e., it is considered as though the fathers are alive, <b>if so,</b> then this should apply <b>even</b> to <b>an individual as well.</b> In other words, sons should be able to sacrifice the sin offerings of their late fathers.",
            "<b>Rather, this is</b> Rav Pappa’s <b>reasoning</b> for his statement <b>that a community does not die.</b> It is derived <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the goats</b> sacrificed on <b>pilgrimage Festivals and</b> on <b>New Moons, as the Merciful One states: Bring them from the</b> funds of the <b>collection of the</b> Temple treasury <b>chamber,</b> where they kept the half-shekels donated every year in the month of Adar, with which communal offerings were purchased. The Gemara explains: <b>But perhaps the owners of these coins</b> that were used to purchase these offerings <b>have died</b> in the meantime between the month of Adar and when the offerings are sacrificed throughout the year. If so, how can a sin offering be brought on behalf of some of its owners who have already died? <b>Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from</b> this <i>halakha</i> that <b>a community does not die?</b>",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead a different answer in response to the earlier difficulty: The sin offerings for idolatry brought by the returning exiles were not in fact sacrificed for people who had died. Rather, <b>when they sacrificed these sin offerings</b> for the idolatry committed in the time of Zedekiah, <b>they sacrificed them for the living,</b> i.e., for those survivors who had worshipped idols in the time of Zedekiah and were still alive many decades later and had returned to rebuild the Second Temple. <b>As it is written: “But many of the priests, Levites, and heads of fathers’ houses, the old men that had seen the first house standing on its foundation, wept with a loud voice when this house</b> was before their eyes; <b>and many shouted aloud</b> for joy” (Ezra 3:12).",
            "The Gemara objects: <b>But perhaps those</b> who remained and remembered the First Temple were <b>the minority,</b> in which case they should have each brought individual sin offerings, rather than a communal sin offering. The fact that they brought communal sacrifices indicates that the sin offering was not brought only on behalf of those few who remained. The Gemara explains: <b>You cannot say</b> that they were the minority, <b>as it is written</b> in the following verse: <b>“So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people;</b> for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off” (Ezra 3:13).

With regard</b> to <b>sacrificial</b> animals, if the animal was unwittingly consecrated, it is <b>not consecrated.</b>",
            "The Gemara cites another <b>alternative version</b> of the difference between substitution and consecration of an animal: The case is <b>of</b> one <b>who thinks to say:</b> The first <b>black</b> animal that comes out of my house will be a substitute, <b>but he</b> unwittingly <b>said:</b> The first <b>white</b> animal that comes out of my house will be a substitute. <b>With regard to a substitute,</b> the white animal is consecrated, and the individual therefore is liable to receive <b>lashes</b> for transgressing the Torah’s prohibition, despite the fact that he acted unwittingly. Conversely, <b>in</b> a similar case of <b>sacrificial</b> animals, e.g., one meant to say: The first blemished black animal that comes out of my house shall be consecrated, but he unwittingly said: The first blemished white animal shall be consecrated, if a white animal came out of his house, the animal is not consecrated, and therefore he is <b>not</b> liable to receive <b>lashes.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> another case of unwitting substitution of an animal. This is referring to a case <b>of</b> one who <b>says:</b> Let <b>this</b> animal <b>emerge</b> from its sanctity and become non-sacred, <b>and</b> let <b>that</b> animal <b>enter</b> in its place and become consecrated. This person acted unwittingly, because he mistakenly thought that in this manner the consecrated animal would no longer be sacred. <b>With regard to</b> a similar case involving <b>sacrificial</b> animals, <b>where he</b> has a sacrificial animal that developed a blemish and he incorrectly <b>says:</b> Any animals <b>that have developed a blemish may be eaten without redemption,</b> and he proceeded to eat the animal without first redeeming it, he is <b>not</b> liable to <b>receive lashes.</b> But <b>with regard to a substitute,</b> if he did this he would be liable to <b>receive lashes,</b> as stated above.",
            "<b>Rav Sheshet says</b> yet another example of unwittingly performing substitution: It is referring to a case <b>of</b> one who <b>says: I will enter this house and consecrate</b> an animal intentionally, or: I will enter this house <b>and substitute</b> an animal <b>intentionally, and he entered and substituted or consecrated unintentionally,</b> i.e., he acted absentmindedly.

            "§ The mishna taught that <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> An animal crossbred from <b>diverse kinds, and a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> and an animal born by caesarean section, and a <i>tumtum</i> animal, and a hermaphrodite animal, are neither sacred through consecration nor do they sanctify non-sacred animals by means of substitution. <b>Shmuel says</b> in explanation: They <b>are not sanctified by substitution,</b> i.e., if one said that an animal in any of these categories should be a substitute for a sacrificial animal, it does not become sanctified. <b>And</b> the clause that they <b>do not sanctify</b> non-sacred animals means that if one of these types of animal was sanctified and one attempted <b>to render</b> a non-sacred animal <b>a substitute</b> for it, that non-sacred animal does not become sanctified.",
            "<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir said: But since</b> these animals <b>do not become sanctified, how can</b> it even be suggested that <b>they</b> could <b>sanctify</b> another non-sacred animal? <b>Rather, you find</b> that the ruling of Rabbi Elazar applies <b>only when</b> one <b>sanctifies an animal and afterward it became a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> or <b>when</b> one <b>sanctifies a fetus and it emerged</b> from the womb <b>by caesarean section.

            "<b>Rav Pappa said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar?</b> He holds that the <i>halakhot</i> of these categories of animal is <b>like</b> that of <b>a non-kosher</b> domesticated <b>animal: Just as a non-kosher</b> domesticated <b>animal is not sacrificed</b> as an offering <b>and inherent sanctity does not rest upon it, so too, these</b> animals in the categories of a <i>tereifa</i>, an animal born by caesarean section, a <i>tumtum</i>, or a hermaphrodite <b>may not be sacrificed</b> as offerings <b>and inherent sanctity does not rest upon them.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Pappa said to Rava: But</b> why aren’t animals in these categories compared to <b>a blemished</b> animal, <b>which may not be sacrificed</b> as an offering <b>but</b> nevertheless <b>inherent sanctity</b> does <b>rest upon it?</b> Rava <b>said to</b> Rav Pappa in response: Although <b>a blemished</b> animal is not sacrificed on the altar, another animal of <b>its</b> same <b>type,</b> i.e., an unblemished animal, <b>is sacrificed</b> as an offering. By contrast, an animal born by caesarean section, a <i>tumtum</i>, and a hermaphrodite may never be sacrificed. Rav Pappa said to Rava: <b>If so,</b> what will you say about <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> as other animals <b>of its type are sacrificed.</b> According to your explanation, why doesn’t inherent sanctity rest upon a <i>tereifa</i>?",
            "<b>Rather, Rava</b> retracts his previous answer and instead <b>says:</b> The <i>halakhot</i> of animals in these categories are <b>like</b> those of <b>a non-kosher</b> domesticated <b>animal,</b> in the following manner: <b>Just as</b> the category of <b>a non-kosher</b> domesticated <b>animal is an inherent disqualification,</b> and such an animal cannot be sanctified or render another animal sanctified, <b>so too</b> the same applies to <b>any</b> other category of animal that <b>is an inherent disqualification,</b> such as a <i>tereifa</i>, an animal born by caesarean section, a <i>tumtum</i> animal, and a hermaphrodite. This serves <b>to exclude blemished</b> animals, <b>which are disqualified</b> only because they <b>lack</b> certain limbs.",
            "<b>Rav Adda</b> raised a difficulty with regard to this answer and <b>said to Rava:</b> Is the disqualification of a blemished animal always because it is lacking a limb? <b>But isn’t</b> the phrase: <b>Too long or closed</b> hooves, <b>written in the passage</b> of the Torah addressing blemishes that disqualify an animal; <b>and these are inherent disqualifications.</b> The verse states: “Either a bull or a lamb that has any limb too long or closed hooves, you may offer for a voluntary offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted” (Leviticus 22:23).",
            "<b>Rather, Rava</b> again retracted his previous answer and <b>said:</b> The explanation of Rabbi Elazar’s opinion is as I explained initially. The <i>halakhot</i> of animals in these categories are <b>like</b> those of <b>a non-kosher</b> domesticated <b>animal: Just as a non-kosher</b> domesticated <b>animal is not</b> sacrificed on the altar and neither are any animals <b>of its type, so too</b> these <i>halakhot</i> apply to <b>any</b> animal that <b>is not</b> sacrificed on the altar and neither are any animals <b>of its type.</b> This serves <b>to exclude a blemished</b> animal, <b>because</b> other animals of <b>its type are</b> sacrificed on the altar.",
            "<b>What</b> did <b>you say</b> to challenge this explanation? You said that in the case of <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, there are</b> other animals <b>of its type</b> that are sacrificed, and if so, why doesn’t inherent sanctity rest upon a <i>tereifa</i>? The answer is that a <i>tereifa</i> <b>is not similar to a blemished animal,</b> as <b>a non-kosher animal is forbidden for consumption, and a <i>tereifa</i> is forbidden for consumption.</b> This serves <b>to exclude a blemished</b> animal, <b>which is permitted for consumption.</b>",
            "§ With regard to a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>Shmuel says:</b> One <b>who consecrates</b> an animal that is <b>a <i>tereifa</i> is required</b> to wait until it develops <b>a permanent blemish,</b> on account <b>of which he may redeem it.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to this statement of Shmuel.

Consequently, a consecrated <i>tereifa</i> animal may be redeemed even if it is going to be fed to the dogs.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty against the opinion of Shmuel. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna (31a): With regard to <b>all sacrificial</b> animals <b>that became <i>tereifa</i>, one may not redeem them</b> and render them non-sacred, <b>because</b> their consumption is forbidden; and <b>one does not redeem sacrificial</b> animals <b>to feed them to</b> the <b>dogs.</b> The Gemara analyzes this ruling: <b>The reason</b> that they may not be redeemed is because <b>they became</b> <i>tereifa</i> after they had already been consecrated. <b>Consequently,</b> if <b>they were</b> already <i>tereifa</i> <b>from the outset,</b> when they were consecrated, one <b>may redeem them.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Perhaps this <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>anywhere that</b> an animal <b>itself</b> is <b>not fit</b> for sacrifice, <b>inherent sanctity does not rest upon it</b> at all.",

            "§ With regard to the mishna’s statement that the halakhic status of the offspring of peace offerings and their substitutes are like that of the peace offering itself, the Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara answers: <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “And if his offering be a sacrifice of peace offerings: If he offer of the herd, if male if female, he shall offer it without blemish before the Lord” (Leviticus 3:1). Since the verse already states: “If he offer of the herd,” the words “if male if female” are unnecessary.

            "The <i>baraita</i> objects: <b>But</b> could this <b>not</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference: If a substitute</b> of a peace offering, <b>which</b> is lenient in that it <b>is not grown from consecrated</b> property, i.e., it is not the offspring of a sacrifical animal, <b>is sacrificed</b> as a peace offering, then with regard to <b>the offspring</b> of a peace offering, <b>which is</b> more stringent since it is <b>grown from consecrated</b> property, <b>is it not logical that it be sacrificed</b> as a peace offering?",
            "The <i>baraita</i> responds that this <i>a fortiori</i> inference may be refuted: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about</b> the halakhic status of <b>a substitute?</b> It is unique in <b>that</b> the <i>halakha</i> of substitution <b>applies to all sacrificial</b> animals that belong to an individual, and therefore the substitute of a peace offering is offered as a peace offering. <b>Shall you say</b> the same <b>with regard to the offspring, which</b> is more lenient in that it <b>does not apply to all sacrificial</b> animals, as some are male and do not give birth, and therefore there is reason to say that it <b>is not sacrificed</b> as a peace offering, <b>since</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the sanctity of the offspring <b>does not apply to all sacrificial</b> animals?

            "<b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>the substitute of an unblemished</b> peace offering <b>and the offspring of an unblemished</b> peace offering have the status of a peace offering. <b>From where</b> do I derive that <b>the offspring of blemished</b> animals <b>and the substitute of blemished</b> animals which are themselves unblemished have the status of peace offerings? <b>The verse states</b> in a more expanded form: <b>“If male,” to include the offspring of blemished</b> animals, and <b>“if female,” to include the substitute of blemished</b> animals.",
            "The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rav Safra said to Abaye: But</b> why should <b>I</b> not <b>reverse</b> the interpretations and say that the words “if male” serve to include the substitute of blemished animals, and the words “if female” serve to include the offspring of blemished animals? Abaye responds: It <b>stands to reason</b> that <b>from the</b> same <b>place that the substitute of unblemished</b> animals <b>is included,</b> i.e., from the word “female,” <b>the substitute of blemished</b> animals is also <b>included,</b> i.e., from the expanded form “if female.” Likewise, since the word “male” teaches that the offspring of an unblemished peace offering is included, the offspring of a blemished peace offering is included from the phrase “if male.”",
            "Rav Safra <b>said to</b> Abaye in explanation of his question: <b>Did I say to you to reverse</b> the interpretations of the phrases <b>“if male”</b> and <b>“if female”?

Abaye <b>said to him</b> in response: It is logical to interpret the verse as the <i>baraita</i> does, as the word <b>offspring [<i>valad</i>] indicates a masculine form,</b> while the word <b>substitute [<i>temura</i>] indicates a feminine form.</b>",
            "§ The <i>baraita</i> stated that the offspring of a blemished peace offering has the status of a peace offering. The Gemara asks: <b>For what</b> matter is that <b><i>halakha</i></b> relevant? <b>Shmuel said:</b> It is relevant with regard <b>to sacrificing</b> it on the altar as a peace offering, even though its mother is blemished and disqualified for the altar. <b>And</b> the <i>baraita</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar,</b> who rules that if one sets aside a female animal for a burnt offering, and that animal gave birth to a male, the offspring is offered as a burnt offering, even though its mother may not be offered as a burnt offering (see 18b).",
            "The <i>baraita</i> therefore teaches that the same is true with regard to the offspring of a blemished peace offering. And although Rabbi Elazar already stated this principle, it was necessary for the <i>baraita</i> to repeat it in this case, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>when Rabbi Elazar says</b> his opinion, it is only with regard to <b>a burnt offering,</b> due to the fact <b>that</b> there the discrepancy between mother and offspring is their sex, and <b>there is burnt offering status</b> for females, i.e., the case of a bird that is the same sex <b>as its mother,</b> as one may sacrifice a female bird burnt offering. <b>But</b> perhaps <b>these offspring</b> of a blemished peace offering <b>are not sacrificed,</b> as there is no case of a blemished animal that may be offered as a peace offering.

            "§ In the <i>baraita</i>, the <i>halakha</i> governing the substitute and offspring of a peace offering is derived from the superfluous words “male” and “female.” The Gemara notes: <b>But this <i>tanna</i> cites</b> the source of this <i>halakha</i> <b>from here:</b> “Only the holy things you have, and your vows, you shall take and go to the place which the Lord shall choose; and you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the Lord your God; and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out against the altar of the Lord your God, and you shall eat the flesh” (Deuteronomy 12:26–27).",

            "The Gemara answers: The verse is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that these <b>five sin offerings</b> may be left to <b>die in any location, but these,</b> the offspring and substitute of a peace offering, must be left to <b>die</b> specifically <b>in the Temple.</b> Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so, as the offspring and substitute of a peace offering may be offered upon the altar.",

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> it <b>is indeed so,</b> that the verse is unnecessary for that purpose. <b>Rather, why do I</b> need <b>the verse?

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> let <b>him derive all of</b> the <i>halakhot</i>, that of the offspring and the substitute of an unblemished peace offering as well as that of the offspring and the substitute of a blemished offering, <b>from this verse:</b> “If male if female,” in the same manner that the <i>tanna</i> of the first <i>baraita</i> derived them from that verse. The Gemara answers: <b>He does not learn</b> anything from the word <b>“if,”</b> which is a common term and is not considered superfluous.",

            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Although the previous mishna stated plainly that the offspring of a peace offering is itself sacrificed as a peace offering, its status is actually subject to a dispute between the <i>tanna’im</i>. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The offspring of a peace offering is not sacrificed</b> on the altar as <b>a peace offering;</b> rather it is sequestered and left to die. <b>And the Rabbis say: It is sacrificed</b> as a peace offering.",

            "<b>Rather, Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This is the reason of Rabbi Eliezer,</b> that the offspring of a peace offering is not sacrificed as a peace offering: It is a rabbinic <b>decree</b> that it may not be sacrificed, <b>lest</b> the owner delay sacrificing the peace offerings that he is obligated to bring so that he may <b>raise</b> entire <b>herds from them</b> in order to sell the animals to people who need peace offerings.",

            "§ <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>to support</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi,</b> that all agree that the offspring of the offspring of a peace offering is not sacrificed: The verse states: <b>“If he sacrifices a lamb</b> for his offering, then shall he present it before the Lord” (Leviticus 3:7). Two limitations are derived from this verse: The word “lamb” indicates that <b>the first offspring,</b> i.e., the offspring of the peace offering, <b>is sacrificed,</b> but <b>the second offspring,</b> i.e., the offspring of the offspring, <b>is not sacrificed.</b>",
            "In addition, the word <b>“he [<i>hu</i>]”</b> is interpreted as referring to the offspring of the peace offering rather than the owner, as it is obvious from the context that the owner is sacrificing the animal and the word would be unnecessary if written only for that purpose. Therefore, it teaches that the offspring of a peace offering <b>is sacrificed, but the offspring of all</b> other <b>sacrificial</b> animals <b>is not sacrificed.</b> This indicates that even those Sages who rule that the offspring of a peace offering is sacrificed agree that the offspring of the offspring is not sacrificed.",
            "The Gemara clarifies the second limitation, that the offspring of other sacrificial animals is not sacrificed: <b>The offspring of which</b> type of offering is referred to here? <b>If</b> it is referring to that <b>of a burnt offering or guilt offering, they are male and</b> therefore <b>not capable of</b> giving birth to <b>offspring.

            "<b>Ravina said:</b> The verse serves <b>to include,</b> in the limitation that the offspring of other sacrificial animals are not sacrificed, <b>the offspring of</b> an animal that was consecrated as animal <b>tithe</b> and then gave birth. The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>a verse</b> to include <b>the offspring of</b> the animal <b>tithe? It is derived through</b> a verbal analogy between the word <b>passing [<i>avara</i>]</b> mentioned with regard to animal tithe, and the word <b>passing [<i>avara</i>]</b> mentioned with regard to <b>a firstborn</b> animal, which is male and cannot give birth to offspring. With regard to animal tithe the verse states: “And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatsoever passes [<i>ya’avor</i>] under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32), and with regard to a firstborn, the verse states: “And you shall set apart [<i>veha’avarta</i>] for the Lord all that opens the womb; every firstborn that is a male, which you have that comes of an animal, shall be the Lord’s” (Exodus 13:12).",
            "The Gemara answers: This verse is <b>necessary,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>one does not derive the possible from the impossible,</b> as in this case, where one seeks to derive by way of analogy the <i>halakha</i> of the offspring of animal tithe from that of a firstborn, which is a male and therefore cannot give birth. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that the offspring of animal tithe is not sacrificed on the altar as an offering.",

            "Since the term <i>ḥag</i> generally refers to <i>Sukkot</i>, the Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rava, who said</b> with regard to <b>sacrificial</b> animals that <b>once one pilgrimage Festival has passed</b> from when they were consecrated, and the owner has not yet brought them to the Temple, <b>each day he transgresses with regard to them</b> the prohibition <b>of: You shall not delay,</b> which is derived from the verse that states: “When you shall vow a vow to the Lord your God, you shall not delay to pay it” (Deuteronomy 23:22), already <b>from <i>Shavuot</i> he must eat</b> the offspring of the peace offering that was sacrificed on Passover. Why then did they wait until <i>Sukkot</i>? <b>Rav Zevid said in the name of Rava:</b> It is referring to a case where the owner was unable to sacrifice the offspring of the peace offering on <i>Shavuot</i> due to circumstances beyond his control, <b>for example,</b> if the animal <b>was ill on <i>Shavuot</i></b> [<b><i>ba’Atzeret</i></b>]<b>.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Ashi said</b> an alternative explanation: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the word <b><i>ḥag</i> that is taught</b> in the mishna in the testimony of Rabbi Pappeyas?

            "<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> Since a female is unfit to be sacrificed as a guilt offering, its halakhic status is like that of a blemished animal in the sense that it does not become inherently sacred; rather, its value alone becomes sacred.

This proves that according to Rabbi Shimon, even an offering that is not fit to be sacrificed has inherent sanctity.

            "<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava bar Rav Azza: <b>And let the dilemma be raised</b> in a case of <b>one who inflicts a blemish on</b> other sacrificial animals, such as <b>the ninth</b> animal counted while selecting the animal <b>tithe</b> offering, which was mistakenly declared to be the tenth.

            "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak teaches</b> that statement in <b>this</b> way, in the opposite manner to the previous version: <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Azza, said</b> that <b>they inquired in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael: In the case of <b>one who inflicts a blemish upon the ninth</b> animal counted while selecting the animal <b>tithe</b> offering, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?

            "§ The mishna teaches that although the firstborn and animal tithe offerings should not be brought from outside Eretz Yisrael <i>ab initio</i>, <b>if they came unblemished,</b> they may be sacrificed. With regard to this issue, the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction:</b> There was an incident where <b>ben Antigonus brought up firstborn</b> animals <b>from Babylonia</b> in order to sacrifice them <b>and they did not accept them</b> in the Temple. <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> That is <b>not difficult: This</b> statement in the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> while <b>this</b> case of ben Antigonus is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b>",
            "<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yishmael disagreed over this matter: <b>Rabbi Yosei says three matters in the name of three elders:</b> Rabbi Yishmael, Rabbi Akiva, and Ben Azzai, each of whom issued a different statement with regard to a firstborn and second tithe. <b>Rabbi Yishmael says</b> that one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>a person may bring up second tithe in the present</b> day to Jerusalem <b>and eat it in Jerusalem.</b>",
            "<b>But</b> the opposite conclusion should be derived through <b>logical inference</b> from the <i>halakha</i> of a firstborn: <b>A firstborn requires</b> that it be <b>brought</b> to a specific <b>place,</b> i.e., Jerusalem, <b>and</b> second <b>tithe requires</b> that it be <b>brought</b> to a specific <b>place.

            "Rather, perhaps you will <b>say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of eating second tithe in Jerusalem in the present is derived from a comparison to first fruits: <b>First fruits require</b> that they be <b>brought</b> to a specific <b>place,</b> i.e., Jerusalem, <b>and</b> second <b>tithe requires</b> that they be <b>brought</b> to a specific <b>place. Just as first fruits may be eaten only in the presence of the Temple, so too,</b> second <b>tithe may be eaten only in the presence of the Temple.</b>",
            "But this comparison is also flawed, as <b>what</b> is unique <b>about first fruits?</b> They are unique in <b>that they require placement</b> before the altar, as it is stated: “And the priest shall take the basket out of your hand, and set it down before the altar of the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 26:4). Perhaps it is for this reason that they must be eaten in the presence of the Temple. <b>Shall you say</b> that this is also the case with regard <b>to</b> second <b>tithe, which is not</b> obligated in placement before the altar?",
            "<b>The verse states</b> with regard to second tithe: <b>“And you shall eat before the Lord your God</b> in the place that He shall choose to cause His name to dwell there, <b>the tithe of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil, and the firstborn of your cattle and sheep”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:23). This verse <b>compares</b> second <b>tithe to the firstborn: Just as a firstborn is eaten only in the presence of the Temple, so too,</b> second <b>tithe is eaten only in the presence of the Temple.</b> This concludes the statement of Rabbi Yishmael.",
            "The Gemara analyzes the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael: <b>But let the inference return</b> and compare second tithe to both the firstborn and first fruits together, <b>and let</b> the <i>halakha</i> of second tithe <b>be derived by</b> analogy from <b>the common element [<i>bema hatzad</i>]</b> of the two sources: Just as the firstborn and first fruits both require that they be brought to a specific place and are not eaten in the present time, so too, second tithe, which also requires that it must be brought to a specific place, should not be eaten in the present time.",
            "<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> of second tithe cannot be derived in this manner, <b>because it can be said: What</b> is notable <b>about the common element of these</b> cases?

            "According to Rabbi Yishmael, a firstborn is not eaten in the present day, but with regard to second tithe he is uncertain about the <i>halakha</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>And what does he hold?

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Actually, he holds</b> that the <b>initial consecration sanctified</b> Jerusalem <b>for its time but did not sanctify it forever, and here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where the blood of a firstborn</b> offering <b>was sprinkled</b> upon the altar <b>before the Temple</b> was destroyed, <b>and</b> then <b>the Temple was destroyed, but its flesh was still in existence.</b>",
            "<b>Since if the blood is</b> still <b>there</b> and had not yet been sprinkled upon the altar, it is <b>not subject to sprinkling,</b> as the Temple has been destroyed, and consequently <b>the meat</b> of the firstborn offering may not be eaten.

This teaches that the meat may be eaten only when the blood is fit to be sprinkled upon the altar. By contrast, there is no such juxtaposition with regard to second tithe, and therefore Rabbi Yishmael remains uncertain whether it may be eaten in the present time in Jerusalem."

            "<b>And</b> then, as Rabbi Yishmael holds that a firstborn definitely may not be eaten in the present, he says that second <b>tithe comes and</b> its status <b>is derived from</b> the juxtaposition to <b>the firstborn.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And can we derive</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>sacrificial</b> food <b>from one another? But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say:</b> In <b>the entire Torah, we may derive</b> that which is <b>derived from</b> a <i>halakha</i> that was itself <b>derived</b> from another source, <b>except for</b> the case of <b>sacrificial</b> animals, <b>where</b> we <b>do not derive</b> that which is <b>derived from</b> that which was already <b>derived</b> from another source.",

The Gemara answers: The status of <b>the meat and the blood</b> of a firstborn offering <b>are one matter.</b> Therefore, the meat is not considered as derived from another <i>halakha</i>.",
            "§ The Gemara cites the second statement of Rabbi Yosei from the elders, in the continuation of the <i>baraita</i> above: <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>a person may bring up a firstborn from outside Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>to Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>when the Temple is standing and sacrifice it.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And you shall eat before the Lord your God,</b> in the place which He shall choose to cause His name to dwell there, <b>the tithe of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:23). Rabbi Akiva derives from here that only <b>from the place that you bring up the tithe of grain</b> to Jerusalem, i.e., from Eretz Yisrael, <b>may you bring up a firstborn</b> to the Temple as an offering.",
            "<b>But from a place that you may not bring up the tithe of grain,</b> i.e., outside Eretz Yisrael, <b>you may not bring up a firstborn</b> from there. Therefore, the statement of the mishna that if one did bring up an unblemished firstborn from outside Eretz Yisrael it may be sacrificed, is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael. By contrast, the statement that ben Antigonus brought firstborn offerings from Babylonia and they were not accepted as offerings is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva.",
            "§ The Gemara relates the third statement in the <i>baraita</i>, which discusses second tithe: <b>Ben Azzai says</b> that one <b>might</b> have thought that he may <b>bring up second tithe and eat it in any</b> place <b>that overlooks</b> Jerusalem.<b>But</b> could this matter not be derived through <b>logical inference: A firstborn</b> offering <b>requires</b> that it be <b>brought</b> to the <b>place,</b> i.e., Jerusalem, <b>and</b> a second <b>tithe requires</b> that it be <b>brought</b> to the <b>place. Just as a firstborn</b> animal <b>is eaten only within the walls</b> of Jerusalem, <b>so too,</b> second <b>tithe is eaten only within the walls</b> of Jerusalem.",
            "This inference may be refuted: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about a firstborn?</b> It is unique in <b>that it requires the placement of the blood and sacrificial portions upon the altar.

Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And you shall eat before the Lord your God,</b> in the place which He shall choose to cause His name to dwell there, <b>the tithe of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock.”</b> The verse <b>juxtaposes</b> second <b>tithe</b> and the <b>firstborn,</b> to teach that <b>just as the firstborn is eaten only within the walls, so too,</b> second <b>tithe is eaten only within the walls.</b>",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>What is difficult for</b> ben Azzai <b>that</b> prompted him to <b>say:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that it is permitted to eat second tithe in any place that overlooks Jerusalem? The Gemara explains: <b>You</b> can <b>say</b> that it is difficult for him <b>since we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Megilla</i> 9b): <b>The difference between</b> the Tabernacle in <b>Shiloh and</b> the Temple in <b>Jerusalem is only that in Shiloh one eats offerings of lesser sanctity,</b> e.g., individual peace offerings, thanks offerings, and the Paschal lamb, <b>and</b> also <b>the second tithe, in any place that overlooks</b> Shiloh,<b>but in Jerusalem</b> one eats those consecrated items only <b>within the walls.</b>",
            "<b>And likewise, offerings of the most sacred order</b> are eaten only in the area <b>within the hangings,</b> which surrounded the courtyard in the Tabernacle in Shiloh, which was equivalent to the area within the surrounding wall in the Temple courtyard in Jerusalem. <b>Lest you say</b> that even <b>in Jerusalem, they may bring second tithe</b> and eat it <b>in any</b> location <b>that overlooks</b> the walls, since, unlike the firstborn animal, second tithe does not possess any unique stringency, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so, as taught in the mishna.",
            "§ Rabbi Yosei cites one more statement in the <i>baraita</i> with regard to a firstborn: The mishna (<i>Bekhorot</i> 26b) states that a firstborn animal is eaten from one year to the next, i.e., within its first year, as it is stated: “You shall eat it before the Lord your God year by year” (Deuteronomy 15:20). Rabbi Yosei adds that <b>others say:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>a firstborn whose first year has passed should</b> have the same status <b>as disqualified consecrated</b> animals <b>and</b> therefore <b>be disqualified.</b>",
            "Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And you shall eat before the Lord your God…<b>the tithe of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil,</b> and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock.” The verse thereby <b>juxtaposes a firstborn</b> animal <b>to</b> second <b>tithe,</b> which teaches that <b>just as</b> second <b>tithe is not disqualified from</b> one <b>year to the next, so too, a firstborn</b> animal <b>is not disqualified from</b> one <b>year to the next.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the Rabbis,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yishmael, Rabbi Akiva, and ben Azzai, <b>who expound</b> this verse <b>for another explanation, from where do they</b> derive that a firstborn animal is not disqualified <b>from</b> one <b>year to the next?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>They derive it from</b> the verse <b>“You shall eat it before the Lord your God year by year.”</b> The formulation “year by year” indicates two years, thereby <b>teaching with regard to a firstborn</b> animal <b>that it is not disqualified from</b> one <b>year to the next.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>the others,</b> who derive this <i>halakha</i> from the juxtaposition of the firstborn and second tithe, with regard to <b>what do they interpret</b> the verse: <b>“You shall eat it before the Lord your God year by year”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the time for the consumption of a firstborn animal: The phrase “year by year” teaches that there is a manner in which it may be eaten over two years: During <b>one day of this year, and</b> during <b>one day of the next year.</b> The verse therefore <b>teaches with regard to a firstborn</b> offering <b>that it may be eaten for two days and one night</b> in between.",

            "<b>Rava says:</b> There are <b>two refutations of</b> Rabba’s <b>statement: One</b> refutation is <b>that if</b> it is <b>so,</b> that the mishna is referring to an animal that was lost and then found when it had a temporary blemish, then instead of stating: It shall graze until it becomes blemished, the mishna <b>should have taught: One observes</b> the animal to see whether the temporary blemish becomes permanent. <b>And furthermore,</b> according to this interpretation of the mishna, when it mentions the case of a sin offering <b>whose</b> first <b>year</b> from birth <b>has passed, with regard to what <i>halakha</i> is</b> that case <b>taught?</b>",
            "<b>Rather, Rava said</b> a different explanation of the mishna so that it does not contradict the statement of Reish Lakish: <b>This</b> is what the mishna <b>is teaching:</b> With regard to a sin offering <b>whose</b> first <b>year</b> from birth <b>has passed and was lost, or</b> one that <b>was lost and</b> when it was <b>found</b> it was <b>blemished,</b> which means that in each case, there are two disqualifying factors, the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: If the first animal is found <b>after the owner achieved atonement</b> with another sin offering, the animal shall be left to <b>die.</b> If it is found <b>before the owner achieved atonement</b> with another sin offering, <b>it shall graze until it becomes blemished and</b> then <b>it shall be sold.</b> Reish Lakish, by contrast, is referring to a situation where the sin offering was not lost. In such a case there is only one disqualifying factor, and therefore the animal is left to graze regardless of whether or not the owner achieved atonement with another animal.",
            "Rava continues: <b>And</b> it was <b>necessary</b> for the mishna <b>to teach: If it was lost, with regard to</b> a sin offering that was found to be <b>blemished, and</b> also to teach that clause <b>with regard to</b> a sin offering <b>whose</b> first <b>year has passed.</b> In other words, it was necessary for the mishna to teach that in each of these cases losing the animal means that it must be sequestered and left to die if the owner already achieved atonement with another animal. <b>As if it</b> had <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> only <b>with regard to</b> a sin offering <b>whose</b> first <b>year has passed, I would say:</b> It is only <b>there that</b> the fact that it was <b>lost is effective</b> in requiring that the animal must be left to die, <b>because it is not fit for its</b> original <b>purpose,</b> as an animal more than one year old is inherently unfit for a sin offering. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a blemished</b> animal, <b>which would</b> have been <b>fit</b> for sacrifice <b>if not for its blemish,</b> I might <b>say</b> that the fact that it was <b>lost is not effective</b> in causing the animal to be left to die.",
            "<b>And</b> similarly, <b>if</b> the mishna had <b>taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> only <b>with regard to a blemished</b> animal, I would say: It is only <b>there that</b> the fact that it was <b>lost is effective</b> in requiring that the animal must be left to die, <b>because</b> a blemished animal <b>is not fit for sacrifice</b> at all. <b>But</b> with regard to a sin offering <b>whose</b> first <b>year has passed, which is fit for sacrifice</b> as a different offering, I might <b>say</b> that the fact that it was <b>lost is not effective</b> in causing the animal to be left to die. Consequently, it was <b>necessary</b> for the mishna to teach the <i>halakha</i> with regard to both cases.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rava</b> actually <b>say this,</b> that an animal whose first year has passed and was then lost is left to die? <b>But didn’t Rava say:</b> A sin offering <b>lost at night is not called lost?</b> In other words, if the offering is lost at a time that it is not fit for sacrifice, the animal is not considered lost. Consequently, provided that the owner finds the sin offering before morning, it is left to graze and not to die, even if the owner designated another animal in its stead. By the same logic, as a sin offering whose first year has passed is not fit for sacrifice as a sin offering, it should not be considered lost even if the owner cannot locate it. Therefore, it should not be left to die.",
            "The Gemara responds: The case of a sin offering lost at night is <b>not comparable</b> to that of a sin offering lost after its first year has passed. When a sin offering is <b>lost at night, it is not fit</b> at all, <b>neither for itself,</b> i.e., to be sacrificed, <b>nor for</b> its <b>value,</b> to be sold and the proceeds used to purchase another offering. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>this</b> sin offering that was lost after its first year has passed, <b>granted that it is not fit for itself,</b> but <b>it is fit for</b> its <b>value.</b>",
            "The Gemara presents another challenge to the opinion of Rava: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Yoma</i> 62a): On Yom Kippur, a pair of goats are brought to the Temple, and lots are drawn to determine which goat is to be sent to Azazel as the scapegoat, and which goat is sacrificed as a sin offering. If after the lots were drawn for both goats, the scapegoat died, another pair of goats is brought and lots are drawn for the second pair. In such a case, there are two goats that were selected as the sin offering, i.e., the remaining goat from the first pair and the goat selected from the second. One of them is sacrificed and <b>the second</b> goat <b>shall graze until it becomes blemished,</b> at which point <b>it will be sold, and the money</b> received from <b>its</b> sale <b>will be allocated for</b> communal <b>gift offerings.</b> This is <b>because a communal sin offering</b> is <b>not</b> left to <b>die.</b> One may infer from the mishna that under similar circumstances, the sin offering <b>of an individual</b> is left to <b>die.</b>",
            "The Gemara continues: <b>And</b> as the mishna does not specify which of the two goats is sacrificed as the sin offering, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The goat from the second pair is sacrificed, since <b>living animals are rejected.</b> That is, animals that were consecrated for a specific purpose but were not fit to be used for that purpose at the proper time are permanently disqualified as a sacrifice. Accordingly, as the first goat was unfit for sacrifice when the first scapegoat died, it is permanently disqualified from the altar. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>when</b> the High Priest <b>achieves atonement</b> on behalf of the Jewish people, he <b>achieves atonement with the second</b> goat <b>of the second pair [<i>zug</i>].</b>",
            "The Gemara concludes: <b>And the other</b> goat, i.e., the <b>first</b> goat selected as the sin offering, <b>is like</b> a sin offering <b>whose</b> first <b>year has passed,</b> in that both are disqualified due to an external factor. <b>And</b> the Gemara infers that <b>the reason</b> the first goat is not left to die is <b>that</b> it is a <b>communal</b> sin offering; <b>but</b> if it was the sin offering <b>of an individual,</b> it would be left to <b>die.</b> Evidently, a sin offering whose first year has passed is left to die even if it was not lost.",
            "The Gemara responds: Rava could <b>say to you:</b> The case of sin offerings that were <b>rejected is discrete and</b> the case of sin offerings that were <b>lost is discrete,</b> i.e., the two cases cannot be compared. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? In the case of <b>lost</b> sin offerings, the owner’s <b>mind is on them,</b> as he thinks that <b>perhaps they</b> will be <b>found</b> and will be fit for sacrifice. Therefore, they are not left to die simply because they are lost. But in the case of sin offerings that have been <b>rejected, they do not become fit</b> ever <b>again,</b> and therefore the owner’s mind is not on them."

            "§ The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself,</b> which was cited above: <b>Rava said:</b> A sin offering <b>lost at night,</b> when one cannot sacrifice an offering, <b>is not called lost.</b> Provided that the offering is found before morning, then even if the owner designated another sin offering in its stead, the first sin offering is not left to die. The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this statement? <b>If we say</b> that it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis,</b> who maintain that a sin offering is not left to die unless the owner achieved atonement with another offering, <b>why</b> does Rava <b>specifically</b> mention that it was <b>lost at night?

            "<b>Rather,</b> you must say that it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who maintains that if a sin offering was lost at the time when another animal was designated in its stead, the first sin offering is left to die even if it was found before the second animal was sacrificed. Rava teaches that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>states</b> his opinion <b>only</b> with regard to an animal <b>lost during the day, but</b> if the animal was <b>lost</b> only <b>at night, even Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>concedes that it goes to graze</b> and is not left to die.",
            "<b>If you wish, say: Actually,</b> Rava’s statement is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis. And</b> as for the question of why Rava specifies that it is lost only at night when the same <i>halakha</i> should apply even if it was lost during the day, one may respond: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> an animal that is still <b>lost at the time</b> when the owner achieves <b>atonement</b> with another animal. Rava teaches that when <b>the Rabbis say</b> that a sin offering that remained <b>lost at the time</b> when the owner achieved <b>atonement</b> with another animal is left to <b>die,</b> this applies <b>only where the initial loss</b> of the animal was <b>during the day,</b> when the animal could have been sacrificed. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where the initial loss</b> of the animal was <b>at night,</b> it is <b>not</b> left to die. According to this interpretation, Rava is not merely saying that a sin offering is not classified as lost provided that it is found before morning. Rather, he maintains if it was initially lost at night it is never considered lost at all.",
            "§ With regard to this matter, <b>Abaye said: We have a tradition</b> that a sin offering that was <b>lost</b> is left to die, <b>but not</b> a sin offering that was <b>stolen;</b> a sin offering that was <b>lost</b> is left to die, <b>but not</b> a sin offering that was <b>robbed.</b> If a sin offering was stolen or robbed, and the animal was returned after the owner achieved atonement with another animal, the first sin offering is left to graze until it develops a blemish, after which it is sold, and the proceeds are used to purchase a gift offering.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> in which an animal is considered to be <b>lost? Rabbi Oshaya says: Even one</b> sin offering intermingled with other animals <b>in</b> the owner’s <b>flock,</b> to the extent that he cannot discern which animal is the sin offering, is considered lost. <b>And even one</b> sin offering intermingled <b>with one</b> non-sacred animal, so that the owner does not know which is the sin offering, is considered lost. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> An animal found <b>behind the door</b> is considered to have been lost.",
            "<b>A dilemma was raised before the</b> Sages with regard to the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan: With regard to <b>what</b> case <b>is he speaking?</b> Does Rabbi Yoḥanan mean that <b>it is</b> only when the animal is found <b>behind the door</b> that it is considered to have been lost, <b>as there is no one who sees it, but</b> if the animal was <b>outside</b> and was intermingled with other animals, <b>where there are</b> people <b>who see it, it is not</b> considered to be <b>lost?

Since no resolution is offered, the Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.",
            "The Gemara further discusses a sin offering that was lost. <b>Rav Pappa said: We learn</b> through tradition that if a sin offering is <b>lost from</b> the owner <b>but</b> is <b>not</b> lost <b>from the shepherd</b> of the flock, i.e., the shepherd knows which animal is the sin offering, <b>it is not</b> considered <b>lost.

The Gemara asks: If the sin offering was <b>lost from</b> the owner <b>and the shepherd, but</b> there is <b>one</b> individual located far away, even <b>at the end of the world,</b> who <b>recognizes</b> the animal, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Again the Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.",
            "§ <b>Rav Pappa raises a dilemma:</b> In a case where a sin offering was <b>lost,</b> and the owner designated another sin offering in its stead, and the second sin offering was slaughtered, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if the original sin offering was found after the blood of the second offering was collected <b>in a cup</b> and stands ready to be sprinkled upon the altar? The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion does Rav Pappa raise this dilemma? <b>If we say</b> that he raises it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, this cannot be correct, as <b>didn’t</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>say</b> that even a sin offering that was <b>lost at the time</b> when another animal was merely <b>designated</b> in its stead is left to <b>die?</b>",
            "<b>Rather, when</b> Rav Pappa <b>raises the dilemma,</b> he does so <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis,</b> and the dilemma is as follows: <b>Do we say</b> that <b>when the Rabbis said:</b> A sin offering that was <b>lost at the time</b> when another animal was <b>designated</b> in its stead is left to <b>graze,</b> this applies only if the original animal was found <b>before one collects the blood</b> of the other sin offering <b>in a cup; but here,</b> where the other sin offering was already slaughtered and its blood was collected in a cup, <b>the</b> Rabbis <b>hold: Any</b> blood <b>that stands</b> ready <b>to be sprinkled</b> upon the altar <b>is considered like</b> it has already been <b>sprinkled,</b> and it is as though the owner has achieved atonement? If so, this sin offering that was found after the collection of the blood should be left to die.",
            "<b>Or perhaps</b> the Rabbis maintain that <b>as long as the blood has not</b> been <b>sprinkled</b> on the altar, <b>it is</b> still <b>considered like</b> a case where the original offering was <b>lost at the time</b> when another animal was <b>designated</b> in its stead but was found by the time the second offering was brought to the altar. If so, as the first sin offering was found before the sprinkling of the blood, it should be left to <b>graze</b> until it develops a blemish.",
            "<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> an alternate explanation of the dilemma: <b>Actually,</b> Rav Pappa raises his dilemma <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>And when</b> Rav Pappa <b>raises the dilemma,</b> it is not with regard to a case involving two sin offerings, as described above. Rather, it is with regard to a case <b>where</b> the original sin offering was slaughtered and the priest <b>collected its blood in two cups, and one of them was lost</b> at the time when the priest sprinkled the blood of the remaining cup.",
            "The Gemara elaborates: <b>And you should not raise the dilemma according to</b> the opinion <b>of the one who said</b> that when blood is collected in two cups, one <b>cup renders</b> the blood of <b>the other</b> cup <b>rejected,</b> as in such a case, the entire offering is disqualified. Rather, <b>when should you raise the dilemma?</b> Raise it <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of the one who says</b> that one <b>cup renders the other</b> cup <b>a remainder,</b> i.e., the blood in the second cup is considered the remainder of the first cup and is poured out at the base of the altar.",
            "The dilemma is as follows: Do we say that <b>this statement,</b> that the second cup is considered the remainder of the first cup, applies only in a case <b>where both</b> cups <b>are present, since</b> with <b>whichever</b> cup the priest <b>wants, he may sprinkle; but here,</b> since one of the cups <b>is not</b> present, the missing cup is therefore considered rejected and the offering is disqualified? <b>Or perhaps</b> it makes <b>no difference</b> whether both cups are present or not.

Otherwise, one might fail to consume the entire remainder, and some of it would be rendered leftover from an offering after the time allotted for its consumption [<i>notar</i>].",
            "Rav Mesharshiyya concludes his objection: This <i>baraita</i> teaches that an ordinance was enacted in order to prevent the remainder of a meal offering from being rendered <i>notar</i>. The same reasoning should apply to other consecrated items, including a sin offering. <b>What, is it not</b> that this <i>baraita</i> is stated <b>even</b> according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> this <i>baraita</i> is stated specifically according to the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>",
            "<b>And Rabbi Abba says</b> that <b>Rav</b> says: <b>All concede</b> that <b>in</b> a case where <b>one achieves atonement through the one that was not lost, the one that was lost</b> is left to <b>die. With regard to what</b> case do the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>disagree?</b> They disagree with regard to a case <b>where one achieves atonement with the one that was lost. As Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b> that if one <b>designates</b> a sin offering instead of one that was <b>lost, it is considered like the lost</b> sin offering. Therefore, the second animal is left to die. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that if one designates a sin offering instead of one that was lost, <b>it is not considered like the lost</b> animal. Accordingly, the second animal is left to graze.",
            "The Gemara objects to the explanation of Rabbi Abba in the name of Rav: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Yoma</i> 62a): On Yom Kippur, a pair of goats is brought to the Temple, where lots are drawn to determine which goat is sent to Azazel as the scapegoat, and which goat is sacrificed as a sin offering. If the scapegoat died after the lots were drawn for both goats, another pair of goats is brought and lots are drawn for the second pair. This means that there are two goats that were selected as the sin offering, i.e., the remaining goat from the first pair and the goat selected from the second pair. One of these is sacrificed; and <b>the second</b> goat <b>shall graze until it becomes blemished, and it shall</b> then <b>be sold, and the money</b> received from <b>its</b> sale <b>will be allocated for</b> communal <b>gift</b> offerings. This is <b>because a communal sin offering</b> is <b>not</b> left to <b>die.</b> One may infer from the mishna that under similar circumstances, the sin offering <b>of an individual</b> is left to <b>die.</b>",
            "The Gemara continues its objection: <b>And Rav says</b> with regard to this mishna: <b>Living animals are not rejected.</b> In other words, the sin offering from the first pair is not disqualified on account of the death of the first scapegoat. And therefore, <b>when he achieves atonement,</b> he may even <b>achieve atonement with the second</b> goat <b>of the first pair. And the other</b> sin offering from the <b>latter</b> pair <b>is like</b> an animal <b>designated</b> instead of an offering that was <b>lost,</b> as the second pair was brought due to the death of the first scapegoat. <b>And</b> the mishna states that <b>the reason</b> the remaining sin offering is not left to die is <b>that</b> it is <b>a communal</b> sin offering, <b>but</b> if it were the sin offering <b>of an individual,</b> it would be left to <b>die.</b>"

            "The Gemara concludes: <b>What, is it not</b> that this mishna is stated <b>even</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis?</b> If so, the mishna is teaching that even according to the Rabbis, an offering designated in the stead of a lost animal is considered like the lost animal, which would contradict the statement of Rabbi Abba. The Gemara responds: <b>No, it is</b> stated only in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.",
            "The Gemara poses a challenge to the explanations of both Rav Huna and Rabbi Abba from that which <b>we learned</b> in the mishna: In the case of <b>one who designates a sin offering, and</b> the animal <b>was lost, and he</b> designated <b>another in its stead and sacrificed</b> it, and the first animal was subsequently found, that is a sin offering whose owner achieved atonement with another animal, and <b>it shall</b> be left to <b>die.</b>",
            "The Gemara infers: The <b>reason</b> that the original animal is left to die is <b>that</b> the second animal was already <b>sacrificed, but</b> if the owner <b>did not sacrifice</b> the second animal before the original animal was found, then the original animal is left to <b>graze.</b> The mishna apparently indicates that there <b>is no difference</b> whether he <b>achieves atonement with the</b> sin offering that was <b>lost</b> and there <b>is no difference</b> whether he <b>achieves atonement with the</b> sin offering <b>that was not lost.</b> It can likewise be inferred from the mishna that there <b>is no difference</b> whether he <b>took</b> the animal and sacrificed it without consulting the court and there <b>is no difference</b> whether he <b>did not take</b> the animal and sacrifice it without consulting the court.

            "If so, this is a <b>conclusive refutation of</b> the opinions of <b>both of them,</b> since according to Rav Huna everyone agrees that an animal is left to die if the owner took one of the animals without consulting the court; and according to Rabbi Abba everyone agrees that if the owner achieved atonement with the second animal, the lost animal is left to die.",
            "The Gemara responds: One should not infer in that manner from the mishna. Rather, the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>taught a matter that was absolute,</b> i.e., a case where the second animal was sacrificed before the original animal was found, as the lost animal is always left to die. <b>He did not teach a matter that was not absolute,</b> i.e., a matter that depends on some other factor, e.g., whether the owner took the animal without consulting the court, or whether the owner achieved atonement with the lost animal.",
            "The Gemara poses another difficulty from that which <b>we learned</b> in the mishna: In the case of <b>one who designates money for</b> purchase of his <b>sin offering, and</b> the money <b>was lost, and he designated other</b> money <b>in its stead, and thereafter the original</b> money <b>was found, he should bring a sin offering from</b> a combination of <b>this</b> original money <b>and that</b> money designated in its stead, <b>and the remainder shall be allocated for</b> communal <b>gift</b> offerings.",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this statement? <b>If we say</b> that it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, it is <b>obvious that</b> the second pile of money is <b>allocated for</b> communal <b>gift</b> offerings, as <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> that the surplus money is cast into the Dead Sea <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> one <b>designated</b> the money instead of money that was <b>lost.

            "<b>Rather, it was necessary for</b> Rabbi Ami to teach this <i>halakha</i> <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that whenever the owner achieved atonement with another sin offering the remaining animal is left to die, even if it was initially designated as a guarantee. <b>Lest you say</b> that just as <b>Rabbi Shimon does not hold</b> that an animal is left to graze if the owner achieved atonement with another animal, he also does not maintain that the unused money is allocated for communal <b>gift</b> offerings, Rabbi Ami <b>teaches us that</b> even Rabbi Shimon <b>holds</b> that if one separates additional money as a guarantee, the unused money is allocated for communal <b>gift</b> offerings.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But how can you say</b> that one might think that <b>Rabbi Shimon does not hold</b> that the unused money is allocated for communal <b>gift</b> offerings? <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 18a): <b>There were thirteen</b> collection <b>horns in the Temple, and</b> the intended use of the funds <b>was written upon</b> each one, as follows: <b>New shekels,</b> for shekels given for the current year; <b>and old</b> shekels, for shekels given belatedly for the previous year; <b>pairs</b> of birds, whose funds were used to purchase obligatory bird offerings, e.g., for a woman who gave birth; <b>and fledglings</b> designated for voluntary <b>burnt offerings; wood</b> for the arrangement on the altar; <b>and frankincense</b> that accompanied meal offerings; <b>and gold</b> donated <b>for the Ark Cover.

            "<b>And it is taught with regard to</b> that mishna: The funds contained in the <b>six</b> horns designated <b>for</b> communal <b>gift</b> offerings were used <b>to</b> purchase <b>burnt offerings that come from the surplus</b> funds which had been allocated for the purchase of sin offerings or guilt offerings and were not needed for those purposes. Such burnt offerings were brought in the absence of other offerings, so that the altar would not remain idle. Unlike other burnt offerings, the <b>hides</b> of these offerings were <b>not</b> given <b>to the priests;</b> rather, they were sold, and the money received from their sale was allocated for additional communal gift offerings. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Neḥemya said to him, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> who said to Rabbi Yehuda: <b>If so, the teaching of Jehoiada the</b> High <b>Priest</b> has been <b>negated.

On the one hand, the verse states: <b>“It is a guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 5:19), indicating that the meat of this guilt offering is eaten by the priests, as is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to all guilt offerings. On the other hand, the same verse concludes: “He is certainly guilty before the Lord,” which indicates that the <b>entire</b> offering is for God, like a burnt offering.

            "Likewise, everyone agrees that in a case where one says: Consecration of this animal as a substitute for a burnt offering <b>shall not take effect unless</b> the consecration of this animal as a substitute for a peace offering <b>shall</b> also <b>take effect,</b> the animal is <b>consecrated</b> as <b>both</b> a burnt offering and a peace offering.",
            "Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yosei <b>disagree only with regard to</b> a case <b>such as</b> the one in <b>our mishna, where</b> one <b>said:</b> This animal is <b>the substitute of the burnt offering, the substitute of the peace offering. As Rabbi Meir holds: Since</b> if he wanted both sanctities to take effect, <b>he should have said: The substitute of the burnt offering and the peace offering, but</b> instead <b>he said: The substitute of the burnt offering, the substitute of the peace offering, he is</b> considered <b>like one who says:</b> The consecration of this animal as a substitute for a burnt offering <b>will take effect and afterward</b> the consecration of this animal as a substitute for a peace offering <b>will take effect.</b> Therefore, according to Rabbi Meir only the first sanctity takes effect; the second sanctity cannot take effect because the animal is already consecrated.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that from the outset he intended for both sanctities to take effect, and he did not say: <b>The substitute of the burnt offering and the peace offering,</b> because he reasoned that <b>if he said</b> that, one <b>would say</b> that he intends for the animal to be <b>consecrated</b> with two sanctities, half as a substitution of the burnt offering and half as a substitution of the peace offering. <b>And</b> if so, the animal <b>cannot be sacrificed</b> in the Temple, because it is impossible to sacrifice half the animal as one type of offering and half as another type of offering. Therefore, Rabbi Yosei <b>teaches us</b> that when he says: The substitute of the burnt offering the substitute of the peace offering, he intends for the animal to be both entirely a burnt offering and entirely a peace offering, as he mistakenly thinks that such an animal can be sacrificed in the Temple. But since he intended for both types of sanctity to take effect, the animal is half a burnt offering and half a peace offering.",
            "§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of one who had two animals standing before him, one a burnt offering and one a peace offering, and <b>he said</b> with regard to one of his non-sacred animals: <b>This animal, half of it is the substitute of the burnt offering, and half of it is the substitute of the peace offering,</b> that animal is the substitute of the burnt offering and is therefore <b>entirely sacrificed as a burnt offering.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.

            "The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>Rabbi Yosei said: If that was his intent from the outset,</b> then <b>since it is impossible to call two designations simultaneously, his statement stands,</b> and the animal is half a burnt offering and half a peace offering. The Gemara objects: The opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei is identical to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Rabbi Yosei taught the entire</b> <i>baraita</i>, and the opinion of the Rabbis in the <i>baraita</i> is Rabbi Yosei’s opinion.",

Just as in the first case of the <i>baraita</i> where one mentioned the burnt offering first and the sin offering second, Rabbi Meir holds that only the first expression takes effect, so too if one mentioned the sin offering first and the burnt offering second, only the first expression takes effect; this means that the animal is a sin offering, and therefore it must be left to die, as he is not obligated to bring a sin offering.",
            "The Gemara explains that the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> is necessary, <b>lest you say: If it hadn’t taught us</b> the opinion of Rabbi Meir in the latter case, <b>I would say</b> that <b>the reason for</b> the ruling <b>of Rabbi Meir</b> in the first clause of the mishna <b>is not that</b> we <b>attend</b> only to <b>the first statement.

Rather, his ruling is due to the principle that we attend only to the first statement, and therefore Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yosei agree in the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i> that the animal must be left to die.",

            "The Gemara explains the dilemma: Is the animal <b>sacrificed as a substitute, as</b> the sanctity of substitution <b>applies to all sacrificial</b> animals? <b>Or perhaps</b> the animal <b>is sacrificed as</b> an animal <b>tithe, as</b> the consecration of the animal tithe is more comprehensive, since if one mistakenly counted the ninth animal to pass underneath the rod as the tenth or the eleventh as the tenth, <b>he consecrates</b> those animals that passed <b>before and after</b> the tenth.

            "§ The <i>baraita</i> further teaches that the phrase <b>“from the flock”</b> (Leviticus 1:2) serves <b>to exclude</b> an animal <b>set aside</b> for idol worship, while the conjunction “or” at the beginning of the phrase <b>“or from the flock”</b> (Leviticus 1:2) serves <b>to exclude</b> an animal <b>that gored</b> and killed a person. <b>Rabbi Shimon said: If</b> it <b>is stated</b> that <b>an animal that copulated with a person</b> is disqualified as a sacrifice, <b>why is it stated</b> that an animal that <b>gored</b> is disqualified? <b>And if it is stated</b> that an animal that <b>gored</b> is disqualified, <b>why is it stated</b> that <b>an animal that copulated with a person</b> is disqualified? How do the transgressions differ?",
            "Rabbi Shimon explains: It is <b>because there is</b> a stringency <b>pertaining to an animal that copulated with a person that does not pertain to</b> one that <b>gored,</b> and vice versa. Rabbi Shimon elaborates: <b>There is</b> a stringency <b>pertaining to an animal that copulated with a person, as</b> with regard to <b>an animal that copulated with a person,</b> the Torah <b>renders</b> an animal that is a victim of <b>forced copulation like</b> one that acted <b>willfully, which is not so with regard to</b> an animal that <b>gored,</b> which is exempt if others induced it to gore.",
            "By contrast, <b>there is</b> a stringency <b>pertaining to</b> an animal that <b>gored, as</b> with regard to an animal <b>that gored,</b> its owner <b>pays a ransom; which is not so with regard to</b> the owner of <b>an animal that copulated with a person.</b> Therefore, the Torah <b>had to state</b> that <b>an animal that copulated with a person</b> is disqualified, <b>and</b> it also <b>had to state</b> that an animal that <b>gored</b> is disqualified.",
            "§ The <i>baraita</i> teaches that the prohibition of sacrificing an animal that copulated with a person and an animal that was the object of bestiality on the altar is derived from the phrase “from the cattle.” The Gemara notes: <b>And this <i>tanna</i> cites</b> that <i>halakha</i> <b>from here, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>an animal that copulated with a person and an animal that was the object of bestiality</b> that were consecrated, <b>they are</b> considered <b>like sacrificial</b> animals <b>whose temporary blemish preceded their consecration.</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> animals with a temporary blemish cannot be sacrificed at present, nor can they be redeemed. Rather, <b>they require a permanent blemish</b> for one <b>to redeem them on account of</b> that blemish, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the disqualification of blemished animals from the altar: “Neither from the hand of a foreigner shall you offer the bread of your God of any of these, <b>because their corruption is in them, there is a blemish in them;</b> they shall not be accepted for you” (Leviticus 22:25).",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> biblical <b>derivation</b> here? How is this verse relevant to an animal that copulated with a person and an animal that was the object of bestiality? The Gemara answers that the <i>baraita</i> <b>is incomplete and this</b> is what <b>it is teaching: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> an animal that copulated with a person and an animal that was the object of bestiality <b>are prohibited</b> to be sacrificed? <b>The verse states: “Because their corruption is in them, there is a blemish in them,” and the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> a principle with regard to the derivation of verses: <b>Anywhere that</b> the term <b>corruption is stated, it is</b> a reference <b>only</b> to <b>a matter of sexual immorality and idol worship.</b>",
            "Corruption refers to <b>a matter of sexual immorality, as it is written</b> with regard to the generation of the flood, which was steeped in sexual immorality: “And God saw the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; <b>for all flesh had corrupted</b> its way upon the earth” (Genesis 6:12). Corruption also refers to <b>idol worship, as it is written: “Lest you deal corruptly, and make you a graven image even the form of any figure”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:16). Since the term corruption is also used with regard to blemished animals, the following may be derived: In <b>any</b> case <b>in which a blemish disqualifies</b> an animal from the altar, <b>a matter of sexual immorality,</b> such as an animal that copulated with a person or an animal that was the object of bestiality, <b>or</b> their use as an object of <b>idol worship,</b> also <b>disqualifies them.</b>",

The Gemara answers that he <b>requires</b> these three terms to <b>exclude sick, old, and filthy</b> animals, which may not be sacrificed.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And the first <i>tanna</i>, who derives from these verses</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>of an animal that copulated with a person and an animal that was the object of bestiality, from where does he</b> derive the ruling that <b>sick, the old, and filthy</b> are disqualified from being sacrificed on the altar? The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it</b> from the verse: “And if his offering be <b>of the flock, whether of the sheep or of the goats”</b> (see Leviticus 1:10). The Gemara comments: <b>And according to the <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael,</b> that these <i>halakhot</i> are not derived from that verse, it is because it is <b>the manner of the verse to say this,</b> i.e., to state the general category of flock before specifying sheep and goats.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: <b>Which is the</b> animal that is <b>set-aside?</b> It is an animal that is set aside <b>for idol worship.

As it is stated</b> with regard to the offerings: “My food that is presented to Me for offerings made by fire, of a pleasing aroma to Me, <b>you shall safeguard it to sacrifice to Me in its due season”</b> (Numbers 28:2), which refers to <b>anything that is safeguarded.</b> The Gemara initially assumes that Rabbi Yoshiya meant that any sacrifice must be safeguarded, i.e., set aside and not sacrificed immediately after its consecration.",
            "<b>Abaye objects to this: If that is so,</b> then in a case where one <b>brought a lamb that</b> was <b>weak</b> as an offering, <b>and</b> its owner clearly <b>did not safeguard it, so too</b> will you say <b>that it is unfit for sacrifice?</b> Nowhere is it stated that an animal is disqualified for the altar because it has not been treated well.

            "The Gemara continues to discuss the definition of an animal that has been set aside for idolatry. <b>Rava bar Rav Adda says</b> that <b>Rav Yitzḥak says:</b> An animal that has been <b>set aside</b> for idol worship is <b>prohibited,</b> i.e., still considered set aside, <b>only until it has been used for work</b> by the attendants of that idolatry.

But after it has been handed over it is not prohibited, as it will not be sacrificed.",
            "The Sage <b>Baha says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> says: A set-aside animal is prohibited only <b>until</b> its owner <b>feeds it vetches of idolatry</b> after it has been given to the attendants of idolatry. <b>Rabbi Abba said to Baha: Do you dispute</b> the statement <b>of Ulla,</b> who defined set-aside differently according the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan?

            "The Gemara continues to discuss the issue of set-aside. <b>Rabbi Ḥananya Terita taught before Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> An animal that has been <b>set aside</b> for idolatry is <b>prohibited only until an action has been performed upon it.

            "§ The mishna teaches: <b>Which is</b> the animal that is <b>worshipped</b> as idolatry? It is any animal that one worships. The mishna proceeds to state: The consumption of both this, the animal designated for idol worship, and that, the animal worshipped, is permitted. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived?",
            "<b>Rav Pappa said that the verse states,</b> with regard to offerings: “And one lamb of the flock, out of two hundred, from the well-watered pastures of Israel, for a meal offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make atonement for them” (Ezekiel 45:15). The expression: <b>“From the well-watered pastures of Israel,”</b> means that one brings offerings only <b>from that which is permitted to Israel.

Rather, they must be permitted in consumption to an ordinary person.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it true that <b>anywhere that</b> an item is <b>prohibited to an ordinary person, a verse is not necessary</b> to teach that it may not be used as a sacrifice? <b>But</b> there is the case of <b>an animal with a condition that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>], which is prohibited</b> in consumption <b>to an ordinary</b> person, <b>and</b> yet <b>a verse excludes it</b> from sacrifice <b>to the Most High.</b>",
            "<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It was previously derived from the verse: “You shall bring your offering from the cattle, even from the herd or from the flock” (Leviticus 1:2), that certain animals are prohibited to be sacrificed on the altar (see 28a). <b>When it says below,</b> in the next verse: “If his offering is a burnt offering <b>of the herd,” there is</b> apparently <b>no need for the verse to state</b> this, as it was already stated earlier. <b>Rather,</b> this serves <b>to exclude a <i>tereifa</i></b> from being brought as an offering.",
            "The Gemara answers: In this case the derivation <b>was necessary,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say: This statement,</b> that a <i>tereifa</i> may not be sacrificed, applies <b>where it became a <i>tereifa</i> and afterward was consecrated</b> as an offering. <b>But</b> if <b>it was consecrated and</b> only <b>afterward became a <i>tereifa</i>, I would say that it should be permitted to the Most High,</b> despite the fact that it is prohibited in consumption. Consequently, the derivation from the verse is necessary.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> isn’t the <i>halakha</i>, that an animal which became a <i>tereifa</i> after it was consecrated is prohibited to be sacrificed, <b>derived from here,</b> a verse that deals with the animal tithe: “And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, <b>whatsoever passes under the rod,</b> the tenth shall be holy to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32). The phrase: “Whatsoever passes under the rod,” indicates that the <i>halakha</i> of animal tithe applies only to an animal that can pass under the rod, <b>excluding a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> e.g., if its leg was cut above the knee, <b>which cannot pass</b> under the rod. From this paradigm case of a <i>tereifa</i>, the exception is expanded to apply to all <i>tereifot</i>.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> derivation from animal tithe <b>was also necessary,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say: This statement,</b> that a <i>tereifa</i> may not be sacrificed, applies <b>where it did not have a period of fitness</b> to be sacrificed before it became a <i>tereifa</i>, e.g., <b>where it was born a <i>tereifa</i> from its mother’s womb.

It is written here,</b> with regard to payment to a prostitute, <b>“abomination,” and it is written there,</b> with regard to forbidden sexual relations: <b>“For whoever shall do any of these abominations”</b> (Leviticus 18:29). <b>Just as there</b> the verse is referring to <b>those with whom relations are forbidden</b> and <b>with whom betrothal does not take effect, so too,</b> the prohibition of payment to a prostitute is referring to a woman <b>with whom betrothal does not take effect,</b> including a gentile.",
            "<b>And</b> Abaye further stated with regard to a gentile prostitute: <b>A priest who engaged in intercourse with her is not flogged for</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>her due to</b> the prohibition with regard to priests: “They shall not take a woman who is <b>a prostitute”</b> (Leviticus 21:7). <b>What is the reason?</b> It is <b>because the verse states: “And he shall not profane his seed</b> among his people” (Leviticus 21:15). This verse indicates that the prohibition of profaning his seed applies only to a priest who engages in intercourse with a woman <b>whose offspring are attributed to him,</b> i.e., a Jew, where the lineage of the children is determined by the identity of the father. This <b>excludes</b> a priest who engaged in intercourse with <b>a gentile woman, whose offspring are not attributed to him,</b> but to her, as their child is a gentile.",
            "Abaye further stated: With regard to one who engages in intercourse with an unmarried <b>Jewish prostitute, her payment is permitted</b> to be sacrificed on the altar. <b>What is the reason?</b> It is <b>that betrothal takes effect with her,</b> and payment is prohibited only in the case of a prostitute with whom betrothal is ineffective. <b>And a priest who engaged in intercourse with her is flogged due to</b> the prohibition against engaging in intercourse with <b>a prostitute. What is the reason?</b> It is <b>because his offspring</b> from this relationship <b>are attributed to him.</b>",

            "<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>all sacrificial</b> animals <b>that developed a blemish and</b> one <b>slaughtered them, Rabbi Meir says</b> that <b>they shall be buried,</b> as he holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon that animals consecrated for the altar were included in the <i>halakha</i> of standing and valuation and must be buried if they died. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> Since an animal consecrated for the altar is not included in the <i>halakha</i> of standing and valuation, even if one slaughtered it, <b>it can be redeemed.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Yirmeya</b> further <b>said to Rabbi Zeira: According to Rabbi Shimon, who said</b> that animals <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance were not included in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>standing and valuation</b> and are redeemed if they died, <b>why</b> does he state, in the last <i>baraita</i> cited earlier, that <b>unblemished</b> animals consecrated for Temple maintenance <b>shall be buried</b> and not redeemed? Rabbi Zeira responds: It is <b>because they are fit for sacrifice</b> upon the altar.",
            "The Gemara explains the significance of the fact that these animals, which were consecrated for Temple maintenance, are fit for the altar. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who associates unblemished</b> animals, i.e., consecrates them by means of associating their sanctity with sanctified items, <b>for Temple maintenance,</b> when they are redeemed by the treasurer <b>they are redeemed only for the altar,</b> i.e., they are sold to those who must bring an offering, and the animals are sacrificed upon the altar. They may be redeemed only for the altar, not for any non-sacred use, <b>as any</b> consecrated item <b>that is fit</b> to be sacrificed <b>on the altar may never leave</b> the custody of the <b>altar.</b>",
            "§ The Gemara continues to analyze the opinions of Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish. <b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye, and some say</b> that <b>Rava</b> said to Abaye: <b>According to Rabbi Yoḥanan, who interprets</b> the above <i>baraita</i> as referring <b>to</b> an animal <b>blemished from the outset, and</b> who further claims that <b>everyone,</b> i.e., Rabbi Shimon and the Rabbis, <b>holds that</b> an animal <b>blemished from the outset was not included in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>standing and valuation,</b> one may ask: <b>And</b> do they both agree that an animal blemished from the outset was <b>not</b> included in that <i>halakha</i>?",
            "<b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Bekhorot</i> 14a): <b>All the sacrificial</b> animals in <b>which a permanent blemish preceded their consecration</b> are not sanctified as offerings; rather, they are sold and the money received is used to purchase valid offerings. <b>And</b> once <b>they are redeemed,</b> they <b>are obligated in,</b> i.e., subject to accounting their offspring, <b>a firstborn; and in the</b> priestly <b>gifts</b> of the foreleg, jaw, and maw; <b>and they emerge</b> from their sacred status and assume complete <b>non-sacred</b> status in order <b>to be shorn and to be utilized for labor.</b>",
            "And <b>their offspring and their milk are permitted after their redemption. And one who slaughters them outside</b> the Temple courtyard is <b>exempt</b> from <i>karet</i>, even if the animal was not yet redeemed, <b>and</b> those animals <b>do not render</b> an animal exchanged for them <b>a substitute. And if</b> these animals <b>died</b> before they were redeemed, <b>they may be redeemed.</b>",
            "<b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says,</b> with regard to this mishna: <b>This</b> statement, that one who consecrates a blemished animal for the altar may redeem it if it dies, is in accordance with <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon, who says</b> that animals <b>consecrated for the altar were included in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>standing and valuation,</b> but animals <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance were not</b> included. <b>As we learned</b> in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: If</b> animals <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance died, they can be redeemed,</b> since they were not included in the <i>halakha</i> of standing and valuation. But animals consecrated for the altar that died are buried, as they were included in this <i>halakha</i>.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Shimon concedes with regard to</b> an animal that was <b>blemished from the outset,</b> which was consecrated for the altar and died, <b>that it is redeemed. What is the reason? As the verse states:</b> “Then he shall set the animal before the priest. And the priest shall value <b>it”</b> (Leviticus 27:11–12). The emphasis of <b>“it”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> an animal that was <b>blemished from the outset</b> from the <i>halakha</i> of standing and valuation. <b>But the Rabbis say:</b> Every animal consecrated for the altar, <b>even</b> one that was <b>blemished from the outset, was included in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>standing and valuation,</b> and must be buried if it dies. This apparently contradicts the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, who says that according to the Rabbis an animal that was blemished from the outset was not included in the <i>halakha</i> of standing and valuation.",
            "<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Pappa, or Rava: The statement of Rav Yehuda in the name of Rav does not pose a difficulty for Rabbi Yoḥanan, as Rav was not referring to the Rabbis of the mishna, who disagree with Rabbi Shimon. Rather, <b>who is</b> the <i>tanna</i> referred to here as <b>the Rabbis?</b> It is <b>a <i>tanna</i> of the school of Levi.</b> The other rabbi questioned Abaye’s answer: <b>If so,</b> that even the Rabbis of the mishna hold that an animal that was blemished from the outset is redeemed, why did Rav Yehuda say that Rav said that <b>this</b> mishna in tractate <i>Bekhorot</i> is in accordance with <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon, and nothing more?</b> This statement indicates that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon alone. <b>He should have</b> said that <b>this</b> mishna is in accordance with the <b>statement of Rabbi Shimon and</b> those who <b>disagree</b> with <b>him,</b> i.e., the Rabbis.",
            "Abaye <b>said to him:</b> The reason <b>that</b> Rav Yehuda <b>does not teach</b> in <b>this</b> manner, i.e., he does not say that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, is <b>because Rav holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish, who said</b> that <b>according to the Rabbis</b> of the mishna, only animals <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance were included in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>standing and valuation;</b> animals <b>consecrated for the altar were not</b> included, and are therefore redeemed.",
            "<b>And</b> admittedly <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna can be explained in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, as it <b>teaches</b> that <b>if they died they can be redeemed.</b> This ruling is in accordance with the Rabbis, as an animal that was blemished from the outset is considered as one consecrated for the altar, since as it was consecrated in order to be sold to purchase a valid offering. But <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna, which discusses a case where the consecration of the animal preceded the development of a blemish, is not in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, as it <b>teaches</b> that <b>if they died they shall be buried.</b> According to Reish Lakish and Rav, the Rabbis hold that in such a case the animal is redeemed. Consequently, the mishna cannot be in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis.",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>Rav holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> that the Rabbis maintain that all consecrations were included in the <i>halakha</i> of standing and valuation and are buried if they died, and the mishna is in fact in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis. <b>And</b> as for <b>that</b> which posed <b>a difficulty for you,</b> that Rav Yehuda <b>should have</b> said that <b>this</b> mishna is in accordance with <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon and</b> those who <b>disagree</b> with <b>him, say: Indeed</b> he said so, that the mishna is in accordance with <b>the opinion of</b> Rabbi Shimon and those who disagree with him.",

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> Among the items from which benefit is prohibited, the mishna states that <b>the hair of a nazirite shall be buried.</b> With regard to this <i>halakha</i>, <b>Tavi raised a contradiction before Rav Naḥman: We learned</b> in the mishna that <b>the hair of a nazirite shall be buried; but</b> one can <b>raise a contradiction</b> from another mishna (<i>Orla</i> 3:3): <b>One who weaves one <i>sit</i>,</b> the distance between one’s index and middle fingers, <b>of the wool of a firstborn</b> animal, from which deriving benefit is prohibited in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> of all sacrificial animals, <b>in a garment, the garment shall be ignited.</b> Similarly, if one weaves <b>from the hair of a nazirite, or</b> from the hair of <b>a firstborn donkey, in a sack, the sack shall be ignited.</b>",
            "Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Tavi: There is no contradiction. <b>Here,</b> the ruling of the mishna that teaches that the hair of a nazirite is buried, is stated <b>with regard to a nazirite</b> who became <b>ritually impure,</b> and who must therefore shave his head and begin a new naziriteship. And <b>there,</b> the ruling of the mishna that states that the hair is burned, is stated <b>with regard to</b> the hair of <b>a ritually pure nazirite,</b> who shaves his head upon successful completion of his naziriteship. At this stage his hair is burned, in accordance with the verses: “And this is the law of the nazirite, when the days of his consecration are fulfilled…And the nazirite shall shave his consecrated head at the door of the Tent of Meeting, and shall take the hair of his consecrated head and put it on the fire that is under the sacrifice of peace offerings” (Numbers 6:13–18).",

            "The Gemara notes that these responses of Rav Naḥman and Rav Sheshet were <b>also stated</b> by other Sages. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: Here,</b> in tractate <i>Orla</i>, the mishna is referring to a case where the hair of the nazirite or firstborn donkey was weaved <b>in a sack,</b> whereas <b>there</b> it is referring <b>to the hair</b> of the nazirite or firstborn donkey itself.

            "Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rav Sheshet: Even if there is a difference between the hair itself and hair weaved in a sack, <b>let</b> the hair that was weaved in <b>a sack be nullified by the majority,</b> i.e., the other materials weaved into the sack, and therefore the sack need not be burned. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> That mishna is dealing <b>with</b> a case where one used the prohibited hair to weave an ornamental design of <b>a bird</b> into the sack. Such a design is considered significant in its own right, and consequently it is not nullified by the majority.

            "Rabbi Yirmeya responded: <b>This is what I</b> meant to <b>say: If</b> it is <b>possible to remove it</b> from the sack, <b>fine; and if not,</b> there is a third answer to the contradiction that Tavi raised before Rav Naḥman: <b>Interpret</b> the mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who said</b> that <b>if one wished to impose a stringency upon himself</b> by <b>burning</b> items <b>that are</b> to be <b>buried,</b> he is <b>permitted</b> to do so.",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to items that are <b>buried</b> that <b>their ashes are prohibited? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>the blood of a menstruating woman and the flesh of a corpse,</b> which normally render one ritually impure whether they are dry or wet, in a case <b>where</b> they dried up and <b>crumbled,</b> they are <b>ritually pure. What, is it not</b> correct to infer from the <i>baraita</i> that they are <b>ritually pure and</b> one is <b>permitted</b> to derive benefit from them, despite the fact that a corpse is an item that is buried? The Gemara rejects this inference: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> means that they are <b>pure</b> only in the sense that they do not render one ritually impure, <b>but</b> it is nevertheless <b>prohibited</b> to derive benefit from them.",
            "<b>Rav Pineḥas raises an objection</b> from another <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a burnt offering of the bird whose blood was squeezed</b> onto the wall of the altar in the appropriate manner, <b>its crop and its feathers,</b> which do not ascend upon the altar, <b>have</b> been <b>removed from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>misuse. What, is it not</b> correct to infer from this that <b>they have</b> been <b>removed</b> entirely <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>misuse</b> and are no longer consecrated? <b>And</b> therefore one is <b>permitted</b> to derive benefit from them, despite the fact that the crop and feathers are buried, as they are tossed to the eastern side of the altar and are swallowed in their place. Evidently, it is permitted to derive benefit from items that are buried. The Gemara rejects this claim: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> means that <b>they have</b> been <b>removed from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>misuse, but</b> one is nevertheless <b>prohibited</b> to derive benefit from them.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>consecrated</b> items that are <b>burned</b> that <b>their ashes are permitted? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>all</b> prohibited items <b>that must be burned, their ashes are permitted, except for wood from a tree</b> used as part of idolatrous rites <b>[<i>ashera</i>]. And ash of consecrated</b> property <b>is prohibited forever.</b>",
            "Before summarizing the question, the Gemara explains why the <i>baraita</i> teaches the <i>halakhot</i> with regard to an <i>ashera</i> and consecrated property separately: <b>And</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>did not combine them</b> into one phrase <b>and teach them</b> together, <b>because an <i>ashera</i></b> can become permitted, as it <b>has</b> the option of <b>nullification by a gentile,</b> whereas <b>consecrated</b> property <b>never has</b> the option of <b>nullification.</b> The Gemara concludes its question: <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that the <b>ash of consecrated</b> property <b>is prohibited forever.</b>",
            "<b>Rami bar Ḥama said:</b> In general, it is permitted to derive benefit from the ash of burnt consecrated property. But this is the <i>halakha</i> either in a case where the consecrated property has been disqualified in some manner, as in the mishna, when its sanctity is weakened, or in a case where one would be liable for misuse of consecrated property when burning it. In such a situation, it is the misuse which causes the consecrated property to become non-sacred. By contrast, the <i>baraita</i> is dealing with a case where the ash remains prohibited, <b>for example, if a fire fell by itself onto consecrated wood. Since it cannot</b> be <b>known who</b> burned the wood, as <b>there is no person who misused</b> the wood in order <b>that its ash should change to non-sacred</b> status, the ash is therefore prohibited.",
            "<b>Rav Shemaya said: When this <i>baraita</i> was taught,</b> it was <b>taught with regard to the removal of the ashes</b> every morning, i.e., the rite in which the priest removes some of the ashes from upon the altar and places them on the ground beside the altar. <b>In</b> this instance, the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that</b> the ash <b>is prohibited forever.</b>",
            "<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the removal of the ashes: The verse states: “And he shall take up the ashes to which the fire has consumed the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar” (Leviticus 6:3). The term <b>“and he shall put them”</b> indicates that he shall place them down <b>gently,</b> rather than cast them down. Additionally, the emphasis on “them” in the term <b>“and he shall put them”</b> teaches that he shall put <b>all of them.</b> Finally, it is derived from the superfluous “and” in the term <b>“and he shall put them” that he shall not scatter</b> the ashes. The ruling of the <i>baraita</i> that all of the ashes must be placed in the ground indicates that even after the consecrated item is burned, the ashes remain sanctified and are prohibited."
