            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There are <b>thirty-six</b> cases <b>in the Torah</b> with regard to which one who performs a prohibited action intentionally is liable to receive <b>excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>].</b> They are: <b>One who engages in sexual intercourse with</b> his <b>mother; or with the wife of</b> his <b>father,</b> even if she is not his mother; <b>or with</b> his <b>daughter-in-law.</b> The same punishment is imposed on a man <b>who engages in intercourse with</b> another <b>male [<i>hazekhur</i>], or</b> who copulates <b>with an animal; and a woman who brings an animal upon her</b> to engage in bestiality. The same punishment is imposed on <b>one who engages in intercourse with a woman and her daughter, or</b> with <b>a married woman.</b> The same punishment is imposed on <b>one who engages in intercourse with his sister, or with his father’s sister, or with his mother’s sister, or with his wife’s sister, or with his brother’s wife, or with the wife of his father’s brother, or with the wife of his mother’s brother, or with a menstruating woman.</b>",
            "<b>And</b> these too are liable to receive <i>karet</i>: <b>One who blasphemes</b> the name of Heaven, <b>and</b> one who <b>worships an idol, and one who gives of his children to <i>Molekh</i></b> (see Leviticus 20:1–5), <b>and a necromancer, and</b> one who <b>desecrates Shabbat. And</b> the same is the punishment of <b>one who is ritually impure who ate sacrificial</b> food; <b>and one who enters the Temple</b> while <b>ritually impure; and one who eats</b> forbidden <b>fat, or</b> consumes <b>blood, or</b> eats meat <b>left over from an offering after the time allotted for its consumption [<i>notar</i>], or</b> eats meat of <b>an offering that was sacrificed with the intent to consume it after its designated time [<i>piggul</i>]; and one who slaughters</b> offerings <b>and offers</b> them <b>up outside</b> the Temple.",
            "<b>And</b> these too are liable to receive <i>karet</i>: <b>One who eats leavened bread on Passover, and one who eats or performs</b> prohibited <b>labor on Yom Kippur. And</b> the same is the punishment of <b>one who blends the</b> anointing <b>oil</b> according to the specifications of the oil prepared by Moses in the wilderness (see Exodus 30:22–33); <b>and one who blends the incense</b> according to the specifications of the incense used in the Temple service for purposes other than use in the Temple; <b>and one who applies the anointing oil</b> to his skin. <b>And</b> one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> for failure to fulfill the mitzva of bringing <b>the Paschal offering and the</b> mitzva of <b>circumcision,</b> which unlike the cases of prohibitions enumerated in the mishna, are <b>positive mitzvot.</b>",
            "<b>For</b> any of <b>these</b> prohibitions, one is <b>liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for its intentional</b> violation <b>and</b> to bring <b>a sin offering for its unwitting</b> violation. <b>And for their</b> violation in a case where it is <b>unknown</b> to him whether or not he transgressed, he is liable to bring <b>a provisional guilt offering,</b> which provides provisional atonement until he discovers whether or not he transgressed. This is the <i>halakha</i> for all of the transgressions listed above <b>except for one who defiles the Temple,</b> i.e., he enters the Temple while ritually impure, <b>or</b> partakes of <b>its consecrated items</b> while ritually impure. In these cases he does not bring a provisional guilt offering <b>because he is</b> obligated <b>to</b> bring <b>a sliding-scale</b> offering for a definite transgression. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>",
            "<b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The <i>halakha</i> is the same <b>even</b> with regard to <b>the one who blasphemes, as it is stated</b> with regard to the sin offering: <b>“You shall have one law for him who performs the action unwittingly”</b> (Numbers 15:29), <b>excluding</b> one who <b>blasphemes, as he does not perform an action</b> but sins with speech."

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the mishna to state this <b>tally</b> of cases where one who performs the action is liable to receive <i>karet</i>? Why does it state a number? All thirty-six are listed in the mishna, and one could simply count them to discover how many there are. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> By listing the tally, the mishna is teaching <b>that if one performed all of them in</b> the course of <b>one lapse of awareness,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to receive punishment <b>for each and every one,</b> i.e., to bring thirty-six sin offerings.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And furthermore,</b> with regard to <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 73a): The <b>primary categories of labor</b> are <b>forty-less-one; why do I</b> need this <b>tally</b> of forty-less-one? The Gemara answers: By listing the tally the mishna is teaching <b>that if one performed all of</b> the prohibited labors <b>in one lapse of awareness</b> during which he was unaware of the prohibition involved, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering <b>for each and every one.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: And <b>furthermore,</b> with regard to <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (8b): There are <b>four</b> people <b>who have not yet</b> brought <b>an atonement</b> offering to complete their purification process and may not eat sacrificial meat until they bring the requisite offerings. The mishna then teaches: And these are the people who have not yet brought an atonement offering: The <i>zav</i>, and the <i>zava</i>, and the woman after childbirth, and the leper. <b>Why do I</b> need this <b>tally</b> of four?",
            "The Gemara answers: By listing the tally, the mishna serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, who says there are five</b> such individuals. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: A convert</b> is also <b>one who has not yet</b> brought <b>an atonement</b> offering and he may not partake of sacrificial meat, although he was circumcised and immersed in a ritual bath, <b>until the priest sprinkles</b> the <b>blood</b> of his offering on the altar <b>on his</b> behalf. It is <b>for this</b> reason that the mishna <b>teaches four,</b> to emphasize that there are not five such people.",
            "The Gemara asks: And <b>furthermore,</b> with regard to <b>that which we learned</b> in that same mishna (8b): And there are <b>four who bring</b> an offering <b>for the intentional</b> transgression of a prohibition <b>as</b> they do for <b>the unwitting</b> transgression of a prohibition: One who engages in intercourse with a designated maidservant (see Leviticus 19:20–22), a nazirite who became ritually impure (see Numbers 6:9–12), one who takes a false oath that he does not know testimony on behalf of another (Leviticus 5:1), and one who takes a false oath on a deposit, i.e., that that an item belonging to another is not in his possession (Leviticus 5:21–26). <b>Why do I</b> need this <b>tally</b> of four?",
            "The Gemara answers: By listing the tally, the mishna serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: The intentional</b> transgressor who takes a false <b>oath on a deposit is not given</b> the opportunity <b>for atonement</b> by bringing an offering. It is <b>for this</b> reason that the mishna <b>teaches four,</b> to emphasize that taking a false oath on a deposit is included in this list.",
            "The Gemara asks: And <b>furthermore,</b> with regard to <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (9a): There are <b>five</b> people who <b>bring one offering for several transgressions,</b> i.e., for violating the same transgression several times; and the mishna then teaches: These individuals bring one offering for several transgressions: One who engages in several acts of intercourse with an espoused maidservant; a nazirite who became ritually impure via several instances of ritual impurity; one who issues a warning to his wife with regard to entering into seclusion with several men; a leper who was afflicted with several instances of leprosy; and a woman who gave birth to several offspring. <b>Why do I</b> need this <b>tally</b> of five?",
            "The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> of the mishna lists the tally <b>because</b> he <b>wants to teach the latter clause:</b> This also applies to <b>a nazirite if he became ritually impure with several</b> instances <b>of ritual impurity.</b> The tally of five includes the case of a nazirite. The Gemara explains what the novelty of this case is: <b>And you find this,</b> that a nazirite can contract ritual impurity several times consecutively, in a case <b>where he became ritually impure on the seventh</b> day <b>and,</b> after undergoing the purification process, <b>again became ritually impure on the seventh</b> day. <b>And</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is it? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that <b>the naziriteship of purity,</b> i.e., the naziriteship one must observe afresh after his purification, <b>takes effect on</b> the nazirite <b>from</b> the <b>seventh</b> day of his purification process.",
            "The Gemara clarifies: <b>As, if you say</b> the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, that is difficult: <b>Since</b> he says <b>that</b> the <b>naziriteship of purity does not take effect on</b> the nazirite <b>until</b> the <b>eighth</b> day, <b>how can you find</b> a case in which <b>these</b> circumstances apply, i.e., that a nazirite can be considered impure with several instances of ritual impurity in the same term of naziriteship?",
            "The Gemara explains why, according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, this is not possible: <b>If</b> this case involves a nazirite <b>who became ritually impure on the seventh</b> day, <b>and,</b> after undergoing the purification process, <b>again became ritually impure on the seventh</b> day, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi would hold that <b>all these</b> impurities <b>are</b> in fact one instance of <b>long ritual impurity.</b> His reasoning is that the nazirite never reached the eighth day, which would renew his observance of naziriteship in purity. If so, the mishna would not refer to this as a case of multiple impurities.",
            "<b>And if</b> the mishna is referring to a nazirite <b>who became ritually impure on the eighth</b> day <b>and,</b> after undergoing the purification process, <b>again became ritually impure on the eighth</b> day, the ruling of the mishna would not apply either. <b>Since he left</b> his state of impurity <b>at an appropriate time to bring</b> his <b>offering,</b> as he can bring his offering on the eighth day, it is not considered a continuation of the previous ritual impurity and he is <b>liable</b> to bring a separate offering <b>for each and every</b> instance of impurity. <b>Rather, conclude from it</b> that this mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> It is to emphasize this fact that the mishna lists the tally.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the source of this opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and what</b> is the source of this opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a verse that discusses a nazirite who became ritually impure and brought two birds to the Temple: “And the priest shall prepare one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, and make atonement for him, for he sinned by the soul, <b>and he shall sanctify his head that same day”</b> (Numbers 6:11). The verse is referring <b>to the day of the bringing of his offerings,</b> which is the eighth day of his purification; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>And Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says</b> the verse is referring <b>to the day of his shaving,</b> i.e., the seventh day of his purification.",
            "The Gemara returns to its series of questions concerning the mention of tallies in <i>mishnayot</i>. The Gemara asks: And <b>furthermore,</b> with regard to <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (9a): And there are <b>five</b> people who <b>bring a sliding-scale offering,</b> which is determined by the financial status of the sinner; and the mishna then teaches (10b): These bring a sliding-scale offering: One brings such an offering for hearing the voice of an oath, and for a false oath of the utterance of the lips, and for the defiling of the Temple and its sacred foods, and the woman after childbirth, and the leper. <b>Why do I</b> need this <b>tally</b> of five?",
            "The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> of the mishna lists the tally <b>because</b> of the <i>halakha</i> taught in the latter clause, <b>as the latter clause teaches,</b> in a different mishna (<i>Horayot</i> 8b): The court is not liable for issuing a ruling with regard to the hearing of a voice, or for a false oath of the utterance of the lips, or for the defiling of the Temple and its sacred foods. The status of the <b>king is like</b> that of the court and he is exempt from bringing an offering in these cases. It is for this reason the mishna teaches <b>five, to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer, who says</b> that <b>a king brings a goat,</b> i.e., a fixed sin offering, instead of a sliding-scale offering for the defiling of the Temple and its sacred foods.",
            "The Gemara asks: And <b>furthermore,</b> with regard to <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Kamma</i> 2a): There are <b>four primary categories of damage:</b> The category of Ox, the category of Pit, the category of <i>Maveh</i>, and the category of Fire. <b>Why do I</b> need this <b>tally</b> of four?",
            "The Gemara answers: By listing the tally, the mishna serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Oshaya, who says</b> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Bava Kamma</i> 9:1): <b>There are thirteen primary categories of damage. And according to Rabbi Oshaya, why do I</b> need this <b>tally</b> of thirteen? By listing the tally, he serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ḥiyya, who says: There are twenty-four primary categories of damage. And according to Rabbi Ḥiyya, why do I</b> need this <b>tally</b> of twenty-four? By listing the tally, he serves <b>to exclude</b> the case of <b>an informer</b> who causes the authorities to confiscate the property of another, <b>and</b> a priest <b>who renders</b> another’s offering <b><i>piggul</i>,</b> as Rabbi Ḥiyya concedes that these are not included in the primary categories of damage.",
            "§ The Gemara returns to discuss the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan. <b>The Master said</b> earlier: By listing the tally, the mishna is teaching <b>that if he performed all of them,</b> i.e., he unwittingly violated every prohibition, <b>in</b> the course of <b>one lapse of awareness,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to receive punishment <b>for each and every one,</b> i.e., to bring thirty-six sin offerings.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to the prohibitions against engaging in forbidden intercourse: <b>Granted, you cannot say</b> that one who unwittingly violates every prohibition against engaging in forbidden intercourse is <b>entirely exempt, as it is written: “For whoever shall do any of these abominations,</b> the souls that do them <b>shall be cut off</b> from among their people” (Leviticus 18:29), and as they all are punishable by <i>karet</i> he is liable to bring a sin offering for his unwitting transgression. <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that if he <b>transgressed one</b> prohibition <b>he becomes liable</b> to bring <b>one</b> sin offering, and likewise if he <b>transgressed all of them in one lapse of awareness</b> he <b>is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin offering.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is <b>for this</b> reason that <b><i>karet</i></b> which one incurs for engaging in intercourse <b>with one’s sister</b> is <b>singled out</b> and mentioned independently of the other acts of forbidden intercourse (Leviticus 20:17). This serves <b>to separate</b> the prohibitions and teach that one is liable to receive a separate punishment of <i>karet</i> or to bring a sin offering for each individual prohibition against forbidden intercourse.",
            "<b>Rav Beivai bar Abaye objects to this:</b> Why not <b>say:</b> With regard to one who engages in intercourse with <b>his sister, which the verse detailed</b> separately, <b>he becomes liable</b> to bring <b>one</b> sin offering <b>for it, but</b> with regard to <b>all</b> the other acts of forbidden intercourse, <b>once</b> he transgressed all of them <b>in one lapse of awareness he becomes liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin offering for all of them.",
            "The Gemara objects: <b>And according to Rav Beivai bar Abaye, does he not</b> accept <b>that</b> hermeneutical principle <b>which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Any matter that was included in a generalization, but was singled out to teach</b> a <i>halakha</i>, <b>was singled out to teach</b> that <i>halakha</i> <b>not</b> only <b>about itself but to teach</b> that <i>halakha</i> <b>about the entire generalization.</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>How so?</b> The verse states: <b>“But the soul that eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings</b> that belong to the Lord, with his ritual impurity upon him, that soul shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 7:20). <b>But weren’t peace offerings included in the</b> general category of all <b>sacrificial</b> offerings; <b>why,</b> then, were <b>they</b> explicitly <b>singled out</b> in this verse?",
            "The <i>baraita</i> answers: They were singled out <b>to juxtapose</b> the <i>halakha</i> of other offerings <b>to them,</b> teaching: <b>Just as peace offerings</b> are unique in <b>that they are consecrated for the altar and</b> one is <b>liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> <b>for</b> partaking of <b>them</b> while impure, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>all</b> food <b>that is consecrated for the altar,</b> one is <b>liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> <b>for</b> partaking of <b>them</b> while impure. This <b>excludes</b> from this <i>halakha</i> items that are <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance.</b> The same reasoning should apply to the singling out of the prohibition against engaging in intercourse with one’s sister, as it teaches that one is liable separately for all the categories of forbidden relations.",
            "<b>Rav Beivai</b> bar Abaye <b>said to</b> the Sage who raised this difficulty: The discussion of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement should be held <b>apart from that</b> <i>baraita</i>. As, <b>didn’t you say there</b> that the comparison to peace offerings <b>excludes</b> items that are <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance?</b> The matter that was singled out teaches its <i>halakha</i> only with regard to cases that are similar to it. The same reasoning should apply with regard to the prohibition against engaging in intercourse with one’s sister.",
            "Rav Beivai elaborates: <b>Here too, just as</b> the case of <b>one’s sister is unique</b> in <b>that she is a forbidden relative who cannot be permitted during the</b> entire <b>life of</b> the one <b>who prohibits her,</b> i.e., her brother, as she will always be his sister, <b>so too,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that one is liable to bring a sin offering for the transgression of each prohibition applies to <b>any</b> forbidden relative <b>who cannot be permitted in the life of</b> the one <b>who prohibits her.</b> This <b>excludes a married woman, who can be permitted in the life of</b> the one who prohibits her, i.e., <b>her husband,</b> as their relationship can be terminated by means of divorce. If so, one would not be liable to bring a separate sin offering for each instance of engaging in intercourse with a married woman, whereas Rabbi Yoḥanan maintains that one is liable to bring a sin offering for violating each of the prohibitions listed in the mishna, including the one concerning a married woman.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yona said</b> in response, <b>and some say</b> this was stated by <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua: The verse states: “For whoever shall do any of these abominations,</b> the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people” (Leviticus 18:29). <b>Since this is a juxtaposition,</b> it means that in this verse <b>all of those with whom relations are forbidden are juxtaposed to</b> the case of <b>one’s sister,</b> written in that passage, as follows: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>one’s sister</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring a separate sin offering <b>for</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>her alone, so too,</b> with regard to any one of <b>all</b> the cases of forbidden relations, one is <b>liable</b> to bring a separate sin offering <b>for</b> engaging in intercourse with that woman <b>alone.</b> When a <i>halakha</i> is derived by juxtaposition the cases do not have to be entirely similar.",
            "The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> this presents a difficulty <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, who says:</b> All <b>those liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i></b> in cases of incest <b>were included in</b> the principle: “For whoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the people who commit them shall be cut off from among their people” (Leviticus 18:29). <b>And why was <i>karet</i></b> incurred by engaging in intercourse with <b>one’s sister singled out</b> in Leviticus 20:17? It was singled out <b>to judge it,</b> so that the transgressors receive the punishment <b>of <i>karet</i> and not</b> the punishment <b>of lashes.</b> Although they have violated a prohibition, which generally carries the punishment of lashes, they are not flogged, as they are liable to receive the more severe punishment of <i>karet</i>.",
            "The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>From where does</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak learn <b>to separate</b> the prohibitions and teach that one is liable to receive a separate punishment of <i>karet</i> or to bring a sin offering for each violation of the prohibition against forbidden intercourse? Unlike Rabbi Yoḥanan, he cannot derive it from the above verse, as he learns this aforementioned <i>halakha</i> from that verse. The Gemara answers: <b>He derives</b> it <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“And you shall not approach a woman</b> to uncover her nakedness <b>as long as she is impure by her menstruation”</b> (Leviticus 18:19). Since the verse could have stated simply: And you shall not approach a menstruating woman, the lengthy expression of: “A woman…as long as she is impure by her menstruation,” serves <b>to separate</b> the transgressions and render him liable to receive a punishment <b>for each and every woman</b> with whom he engaged in forbidden sexual intercourse.",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yitzḥak, <b>let them also derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> that one is liable to receive a separate punishment of <i>karet</i> or to bring a sin offering for each violation of the prohibition against forbidden intercourse <b>from</b> the verse cited by Rabbi Yitzḥak: <b>“And</b> you shall not approach <b>a woman</b> to uncover her nakedness <b>as long as she is impure by her menstruation.”</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is indeed so.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if they derive that <i>halakha</i> from the same source as Rabbi Yitzḥak, <b>for what</b> purpose does the specific instance of <b><i>karet</i></b> stated <b>with regard to one’s sister come?</b> The Gemara answers: The Rabbis <b>require</b> it <b>to separate</b> the transgressions and render one liable to bring a separate sin offering for engaging in intercourse <b>with his sister, and</b> for engaging in intercourse <b>with his father’s sister, and</b> for engaging in intercourse <b>with his mother’s sister,</b> in a single lapse of awareness.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> is it necessary for the verse <b>to separate</b> the transgressions and render one liable to bring a separate sin offering with regard to <b>these</b> forbidden relatives? <b>Aren’t they separate categories</b> of prohibitions, <b>and aren’t they separate bodies,</b> i.e., three different people? It is obvious that each act of intercourse will require a separate sin offering. <b>Rather, say</b> as follows: The verse serves <b>to separate</b> the transgressions and render one liable to bring a separate sin offering for unwittingly engaging in intercourse <b>with his sister who is</b> also <b>his father’s sister and who is</b> also <b>his mother’s sister,</b> i.e., one is liable to bring three sin offerings despite the fact that all three prohibitions are violated through one act of intercourse with the same person.",
            "The Gemara turns its attention to the other opinion: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, from where does he</b> derive <b>this matter?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He derives</b> it <b>from the latter clause of the verse, as it is written: “He has uncovered his sister’s nakedness”</b> (Leviticus 20:17). This seemingly superfluous phrase teaches this <i>halakha</i>.",
            "The Gemara further asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the Rabbis,</b> concerning this mention of <b>“his sister” in the latter clause of the verse, what do they do with it?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>They require</b> it"

            "<b>to</b> teach the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>his sister who is</b> both <b>his father’s daughter and his mother’s daughter,</b> and this serves <b>to say that one does not administer punishment</b> based <b>on</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference.</b> Although the verses state a punishment both for one who engages in intercourse with his half sister who is his father’s daughter and for his half sister who is his mother’s daughter, one cannot learn via an <i>a fortiori</i> inference that he should also be punished for engaging in intercourse with his sister from both parents, as punishments are applied only when the Torah expressly imposes them.",
            "The Gemara notes: <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak,</b> who does not interpret the verses in this manner, <b>maintains</b> that <b>one administers punishment</b> based <b>on</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference. And if you wish, say</b> instead a different reason why Rabbi Yitzḥak does not require this exposition: He <b>derives</b> the <b>punishment</b> of <i>karet</i> for engaging in intercourse with a sister from both parents <b>from</b> the <b>warning,</b> i.e., the prohibition that is stated with regard to her. Just as the verse explicitly prohibited engaging in intercourse with a sister from both parents, so too, the same punishment of <i>karet</i> applies to engaging in intercourse with her as it does to engaging in intercourse with other forbidden relatives.",
            "§ <b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that <b>Rabbi Hoshaya says: Anywhere you find two</b> different <b>prohibitions, and</b> only <b>one</b> punishment of <b><i>karet</i></b> is stated for both of them, you should <b>divide</b> the <b>sin offering between them,</b> i.e., if one transgressed both prohibitions unwittingly he is liable to bring a sin offering for each. <b>And what is</b> this case? One who <b>blends the anointing oil</b> according to the specifications of the oil prepared by Moses in the wilderness, for purposes other than use in the Temple, <b>and</b> one who <b>applies</b> this anointing oil to the skin of a person, <b>as it is written: “Upon the flesh of man it shall not be applied,</b> neither shall you make any like it <b>according to its composition”</b> (Exodus 30:32). These are two prohibitions, one for applying the oil and the other for blending it, and <b>one <i>karet</i></b> is stated with regard to both, <b>as it is written: “Whoever compounds any like it, or whoever puts any of it upon a stranger, he shall be cut off from his people”</b> (Exodus 30:33).",
            "The Gemara challenges this statement: <b>But</b> accordingly, <b>once</b> there are <b>separate prohibitions</b> stated in the Torah with regard to engaging in intercourse with all forbidden relatives (Leviticus, chapter 18), and at the conclusion of that passage it is written: “For whoever shall do any of these abominations, the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people” (Leviticus 18:29), it is indicated that the punishments of <i>karet</i> or a sin offering apply to all these prohibitions. If so, <b>why do I</b> need the punishment of <b><i>karet</i> that the Merciful One writes with regard to one’s sister,</b> in a separate passage: “And they shall be cut off in the sight of the children of their people; he has uncovered his sister’s nakedness” (Leviticus 20:17)?",
            "The Gemara explains: This verse is required to teach one <i>halakha</i> according to the opinion of the Rabbis, and one <i>halakha</i> <b>according to Rabbi Yitzḥak, per his</b> opinion. The Gemara elaborates: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, they require</b> this verse <b>to say that one does not administer punishment</b> based <b>on</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis,</b> from where do they derive this <i>halakha</i>?

            "§ The Gemara returns to Rabbi Elazar’s statement that one who unwittingly blends the anointing oil and applies it to the skin is liable to bring two sin offerings. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: We learn</b> in the mishna <b>as well: And one who blends the</b> anointing <b>oil, and one who blends the incense, and one who applies the anointing oil</b> to his skin.",
            "Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak explains his inference: <b>Why do I</b> need the <i>tanna</i> <b>to teach</b> the clause: <b>One who blends the incense, in the middle,</b> between the two cases concerning the anointing oil? Is it <b>not</b> correct that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>teaches us: Just as</b> blending the <b>incense</b> is <b>an independent prohibition and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for it by itself,</b> and to bring a sin offering for its unwitting transgression, <b>so too,</b> with regard to one <b>who blends</b> the anointing <b>oil and</b> one <b>who applies</b> the anointing oil to his skin, <b>since</b> they are each <b>an independent prohibition, one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> each action <b>by itself,</b> and to bring a sin offering for the unwitting transgression of each of them.",

            "§ The mishna included in its list of those liable to receive <i>karet</i> a male <b>who engages in intercourse with</b> another <b>male</b> or one who copulates with an animal, and a woman who brings an animal upon her to engage in bestiality. The Gemara asks: <b>According to what</b> criteria <b>does</b> the <b><i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna <b>tally</b> the prohibitions in the mishna? Rabbi Yoḥanan explained that the tally stated in the mishna serves to teach that one who violated every prohibition against engaging in forbidden intercourse in a single lapse of awareness is liable to receive punishment for each and every one.

            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches in its latter clause</b> the case of one who <b>blasphemes, and we interpret</b> this clause <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> it may be inferred that <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna is <b>also</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b>",

            "Rabbi Abbahu continues: By contrast, <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin offering, <b>as he derives</b> both prohibitions <b>from one verse: “You shall not lie [<i>tishkhav</i>] with a man,”</b> in the active form, as one can <b>read</b> the verb <b>in</b> this verse, written in the Torah without vowels, as though it stated: <b>Enable your being lain with [<i>tishakheiv</i>],</b> in the passive. Evidently, Rabbi Akiva disagrees with the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael with regard to a male who engages in intercourse with another male and a male who brings another male upon him to engage in intercourse.",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Rather, the first clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, and with regard to</b> one who <b>blasphemes he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so, let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>also teach</b> two additional cases with regard to bestiality: <b>One who copulates with an animal,</b> derived from the verse: “And you shall not lie with any beast” (Leviticus 18:23); <b>and</b> a man <b>who brings an animal upon him</b> for bestiality, derived from: “There shall not be a sodomite of the sons of Israel” (Deuteronomy 23:18), which can be interpreted as applying to all forms of male anal intercourse, including with animals.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Didn’t Abaye say:</b> With regard to <b>one who copulates with an animal, and who brings an animal upon him</b> to engage in bestiality, <b>even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael he is liable to</b> bring <b>only one</b> sin offering, <b>as when the verse:</b> “There shall not be a sodomite,” <b>is written, it is written with regard to men,</b> i.e., the term sodomite does not include one who engages in bestiality. In conclusion, according to Rabbi Yoḥanan, the mishna is listing prohibitions transgressed by men, and therefore one should remove from the tally the case of a woman who brings an animal upon her to engage in bestiality, and add the case of a man who brings another male upon him to engage in intercourse, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael.",
            "The Gemara cites another interpretation: <b>Rabbi Elazar said in the name of Rav:</b> The mishna is listing prohibitions transgressed by men and not women, but one should not remove from the tally the case of a woman who brings an animal upon her to engage in bestiality. The reason is that the <b><i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna <b>teaches thirty-three</b> prohibitions for which a man brings <b>sin offerings, and he teaches</b> another <b>three</b> instances of <b><i>karet</i></b> in order <b>to complete</b> the list of transgressions for which one is liable to be punished <b>with <i>karet</i>.</b> Those three do not meet the same criteria as the other thirty-three, and the case of a woman who brings an animal upon her to engage in bestiality is one of those three.",
            "What supports this interpretation? <b>As</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> in <b>the latter clause:</b> And one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> for failure to fulfill the mitzva of bringing the <b>Paschal offering and</b> the mitzva of <b>circumcision,</b> which unlike the cases of prohibitions enumerated in the mishna, are <b>positive mitzvot. Why</b> does the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach</b> the cases of the <b>Paschal offering and circumcision?</b>",
            "<b>And if you say</b> the mishna mentions these positive mitzvot <b>to</b> teach that <b>one brings an offering for</b> unwittingly failing to perform <b>them, does one</b> in fact <b>bring</b> an offering in such a case? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The entire Torah is juxtaposed to idolatry, as it is written: “You shall have one law [<i>torah</i>] for him that does unwittingly. But the soul that does with a high hand,</b> whether he be home-born or a stranger, he blasphemes the Lord; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people” (Numbers 15:29–30).",
            "The phrase “But the soul that does with a high hand, whether he be home-born or a stranger, he blasphemes the Lord” is referring to one who engages in idol worship, and it is derived from here: <b>Just as idol worship</b> is a situation in which the Torah says to a person: <b>Sit and refrain from action,</b> and one who transgresses this prohibition unwittingly must bring a sin offering, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>every</b> transgression in which the Torah says that one must <b>sit and refrain from action,</b> one is liable to bring a sin offering for performing the act. Accordingly, one is not liable to bring an offering for the unwitting failure to perform a positive mitzva, such as bringing the Paschal offering or circumcision.",
            "The Gemara concludes its statement: <b>Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from</b> the mishna that the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>taught thirty-three</b> prohibitions for which a man brings <b>sin offerings,</b> which apply to <b>one who acts unwittingly, and he taught</b> another <b>three</b> instances of <b><i>karet</i></b> in order <b>to complete</b> the list of transgressions for which one is liable to be punished with <b><i>karet</i>?</b> These three instances are a woman who brings an animal upon her to engage in bestiality, one who fails to bring the Paschal offering, and one who fails to perform circumcision. The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> the mishna that this is the case.",
            "§ The mishna’s list of prohibitions for whose unwitting violation one must bring a sin offering includes <b>one who desecrates Shabbat.</b> The Sages express their surprise at this ruling and <b>say:</b> The primary labors of <b>Shabbat are forty-less-one,</b> and one is liable to bring a sin offering for each primary labor he violates.

The <i>tanna</i> would not then need to list these individual transgressions.",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>Are</b> these cases <b>comparable?</b> In the cases of <b>Shabbat and idol worship</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> their details <b>in their places [<i>abeinekheihon</i>],</b> on <i>Shabbat</i> 73a and <i>Sanhedrin</i> 60b, respectively. Consequently, <b>with regard to <i>karet</i>, where it is necessary</b> to mention them as part of a list of prohibitions that are punishable by <i>karet</i>, Rav Beivai bar Abaye <b>answers</b> that the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches the category of Shabbat and teaches the category of idol worship,</b> but he did not need to specify the details in this manner. By contrast, <b>with regard to bringing up</b> an offering, <b>does</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach them</b> in <b>their place,</b> so <b>that</b> Rav Beivai bar Abaye can <b>answer</b> in <b>this</b> manner?",
            "§ It was stated earlier that Rabbi Elazar says that Rabbi Oshaya says: Anywhere you find two different prohibitions but only one punishment of <i>karet</i> is stated for both of them you should divide the sin offering between them, i.e., if one transgressed both prohibitions unwittingly he is liable to bring a sin offering for each. In a similar vein, <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raised a dilemma before Rabbi Zeira:</b> If there are <b>two</b> punishments of <b><i>karet</i> and</b> only <b>one prohibition</b> written with regard to a certain act, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is one liable to bring a separate sin offering for each act? Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: Are you saying</b> this in reference to one <b>who slaughters</b> offerings outside the Temple <b>and</b> one <b>who offered up</b> the limbs of offerings outside the Temple? These do not match your description, as <b>these are two</b> separate <b>prohibitions.</b>",
            "Rabbi Zeira elaborates: <b>If</b> one considers the matter <b>according to the one who derives</b> the prohibition <b>from a verbal analogy,</b> it is as though both prohibitions are written explicitly. As <b>it is stated here</b> an expression of <b>bringing:</b> “Or who slaughters it outside the camp, and to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting he did not bring it” (Leviticus 17:3–4), <b>and it is stated there</b> an expression of <b>bringing:</b> “Who sacrifices a burnt offering or sacrifice, and to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting he did not bring it” (Leviticus 17:8–9).",
            "Since there is a verbal analogy linking slaughtering an offering outside the Temple to sacrificing one outside the Temple, it follows that <b>just as there,</b> with regard to sacrificing, the Torah <b>did not</b> prescribe <b>punishment unless</b> it explicitly <b>prohibited</b> the act, as it is written: “Take heed to yourself, lest you sacrifice your burnt offerings in every place that you see” (Deuteronomy 12:13), <b>so too here,</b> with regard to slaughtering, the Torah <b>did not</b> prescribe <b>punishment unless</b> it explicitly <b>prohibited</b> the act as a separate prohibition.",
            "If one considers the matter <b>according to the one who derives</b> the prohibition <b>from a juxtaposition,</b> it is also as though both prohibitions are written explicitly. The juxtaposition is that <b>the verse states: “There you shall sacrifice</b> your burnt offerings <b>and there you shall do</b> all that I command you” (Deuteronomy 12:14). Here the verse <b>juxtaposes slaughtering,</b> in the phrase: “And there you shall do,” <b>to offering up.</b> This teaches that <b>just as there,</b> with regard to offering up, the Torah <b>did not</b> prescribe <b>punishment unless</b> it explicitly <b>prohibited</b> the act, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to slaughtering, the Torah <b>did not</b> prescribe <b>punishment unless</b> it explicitly <b>prohibited</b> the act. Whether one derives the prohibition by verbal analogy or juxtaposition, it is considered as though the Torah explicitly wrote a prohibition with regard to slaughtering, and therefore this would not meet the criteria of Rabbi Yirmeya’s dilemma.",
            "Rabbi Zeira continues to address Rabbi Yirmeya: <b>Perhaps you are stating</b> your dilemma with regard to <b>two</b> prohibitions punishable by the <b>death</b> penalty <b>and</b> only <b>one prohibition</b> is written with regard to them, and your dilemma is whether one brings two sin offerings if one transgressed both unwittingly, despite the fact that only one prohibition is written with regard to both acts. <b>What is</b> such a circumstance? This applies in the case of <b>a necromancer,</b> who raises up the spirit of the dead, <b>and a sorcerer,</b> who places a certain bone in his mouth for it to speak of its own accord (see Leviticus 20:6, 27).",
            "Rabbi Zeira further <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya: This should not be a dilemma, <b>as this</b> matter is <b>a dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish.

            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The <i>tanna</i> in tractate <i>Karetot</i> does not count the case of the sorcerer on its own <b>since both</b> the sorcerer and the necromancer <b>were stated in one prohibition:</b> “Do not turn to the necromancers and the sorcerers” (Leviticus 19:31); therefore, there is no separate obligation to bring an offering for each of them. The Gemara clarifies: <b>And let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>say</b> the case of <b>a sorcerer and let him not say</b> the case of <b>a necromancer,</b> rather than the reverse.

            "<b>And Reish Lakish says:</b> The case of the sorcerer is not included in the list of transgressions punishable by <i>karet</i> <b>since it does not involve an action,</b> but only speech, through the use of a bone, and one does not bring a sin offering for a prohibition that does not involve an action. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Reish Lakish, what is the reason he does not state</b> an explanation <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan?</b>",
            "<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> Reish Lakish disagrees with the explanation of Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>because</b> the cases of a necromancer and a sorcerer <b>are divided</b> in the verse <b>with regard to</b> the issue of the <b>death</b> penalty, i.e., one is liable to receive the death penalty for transgressing either prohibition, as it is stated: “And a man also or a woman, who are a necromancer or a sorcerer shall be put to death” (Leviticus 20:27). Consequently, one would be liable to bring a separate sin offering for the unwitting transgression of either prohibition were it not for the fact that sorcery does not involve an action. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> could <b>say to you</b> that <b>a division of a prohibition is</b> considered <b>a division</b> that leads to separate sin offerings, whereas <b>a division of</b> separate <b>death</b> penalties <b>is not</b> considered <b>a division</b> in this regard.",
            "The Gemara further asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, what is the reason he does not state</b> an explanation <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Reish Lakish,</b> who says the prohibition with regard to a sorcerer is not counted because it does not involve an action? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>maintains: Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> the list of those liable to receive <b><i>karet</i>? It is Rabbi Akiva, who says: An action is not required</b> for one to be liable to bring a sin offering.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Reish Lakish,</b> how does he respond to this claim? He could say that <b>although Rabbi Akiva does not require a significant action</b> for one to be liable to bring a sin offering, nevertheless he <b>does require a minor action.</b> The transgression of a sorcerer involves no action, as the voice emerges of its own accord, and therefore even Rabbi Akiva would not hold one liable to bring a sin offering for the unwitting violation of this prohibition.",
            "The Gemara asks: In the case of <b>a necromancer, what action is there in</b> this transgression?

Since Rabbi Akiva holds that an unwitting blasphemer is liable to bring a sin offering, this apparently indicates that no action at all is necessary. The Gemara answers: <b>The twisting of his lips</b> while he speaks <b>is</b> considered <b>an action.</b>",
            "The Gemara comments: It <b>enters our mind</b> that <b>the striking of</b> the necromancer’s <b>arms</b> against each other <b>is</b> considered <b>a minor action even according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> and they would deem him liable.

            "<b>And</b> this is <b>as Rabbi Ḥanina taught: Why does the verse list</b> the obligation to burn the <b>sacrificial portions</b> on the altar <b>with regard to</b> a firstborn <b>ox, and</b> the obligation to burn the <b>sacrificial portions [<i>ve’eimurim</i>] with regard to</b> a firstborn <b>sheep, and</b> the obligation to burn the <b>sacrificial portions with regard to</b> a firstborn <b>goat?

            "Rabbi Ḥanina explains: These repetitions <b>are necessary, as, if</b> the Torah <b>had written</b> this obligation only with regard to a firstborn <b>ox I would say</b> that <b>we do not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a sheep and a goat from it, as</b> that derivation <b>can be refuted: What</b> is notable <b>about an ox?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> an ox <b>has an increased</b> number <b>of</b> wine <b>libations,</b> more than those poured with sheep and goat offerings. Therefore, perhaps the additional obligation to burn the sacrificial portions applies only with regard to an ox.",
            "And likewise, if you were to suggest: <b>Let the Merciful One write</b> the obligation to burn the sacrificial portions only <b>with regard to a sheep and we will derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>an ox and a goat from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a sheep,</b> that derivation <b>can be refuted: What</b> is notable <b>about a sheep?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> there is <b>an increased</b> obligation <b>with regard to</b> a sheep’s <b>tail,</b> as explained earlier.",

            "Rabbi Ḥanina continues: <b>We cannot derive</b> these <i>halakhot</i> <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of any <b>one</b> of the others, but <b>let</b> the Torah <b>write two</b> of them <b>and we will derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>one</b> of them <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the other <b>two.

            "The Rabbis have explained why all three mentions of an ox, a sheep, and a goat are necessary. Consequently, the Gemara again states: The Rabbis <b>spoke well to</b> Rabbi Yishmael, i.e., their response is persuasive. The Gemara suggests: <b>Rather, the reason of Rabbi Yishmael</b> is <b>actually as we said at the outset, that if so,</b> that one who eats the forbidden fats of all three animals is liable to receive only one set of lashes, <b>let</b> the verse <b>write:</b> You shall eat no <b>fat, and be silent. What did you say</b> in response? That <b>this</b> fact <b>that</b> the verse <b>writes: “Ox, or sheep, or goat,”</b> serves <b>to permit</b> the <b>fat of an undomesticated animal?</b> This is not a valid objection.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>When the verse</b> concerning forbidden fat <b>is written</b> it is <b>in the context of sacrificial</b> animals, since the subsequent verse concerning the prohibition against eating forbidden fat states: “For whoever eats the fat of the animal of which men present an offering of fire to the Lord, even the soul that eats it shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 7:25). The verse categorizes an animal whose fat one may not eat as an “animal of which men present an offering of fire to the Lord,” i.e., offerings. <b>And</b> one of the thirteen hermeneutical principles is: <b>A matter</b> is <b>derived from its context,</b> i.e., one interprets a verse according to the context in which it is written. Since offerings may be brought only from domesticated, not undomesticated, animals, the prohibition against eating forbidden fat applies only to such animals.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: Can one conclude <b>by inference that the Rabbis maintain we do not derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> by employing the hermeneutical principle of: <b>A matter</b> is <b>derived from its context?</b> This cannot be correct, as it is an accepted basic principle of exegesis. The Gemara answers: <b>No, everyone</b> agrees that <b>we do derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> by employing the hermeneutical principle of: <b>A matter</b> is <b>derived from its context, and here</b> it is <b>about this</b> issue <b>that they disagree: Rabbi Yishmael maintains</b> that <b>we derive</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of one <b>prohibition from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of another <b>prohibition,</b> and this applies <b>whether</b> it is <b>from</b> a standard <b>prohibition,</b> whose transgression results in the punishment of lashes, <b>or whether from a prohibition</b> whose transgression results in the punishment <b>of <i>karet</i>.</b>",
            "Accordingly, the prohibition <b>of:</b> “You shall eat <b>no fat of ox, or sheep, or goat,”</b> can be derived <b>from the prohibition of: “It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings, that you shall eat neither fat nor blood”</b> (Leviticus 3:17), <b>which is written with regard to the matter of sacrificial</b> animals. <b>And there are no undomesticated animals in</b> the category of <b>sacrificial</b> animals. <b>So too,</b> with regard to the prohibition of: “You shall eat <b>no fat of ox,</b> or sheep, or goat,” <b>when</b> the verse <b>writes it without</b> further <b>specification, there is no</b> reason <b>to be uncertain</b> whether or not it is referring also <b>to undomesticated animals. Therefore,</b> the phrase <b>“ox, or sheep, or goat” comes to separate,</b> i.e., <b>to render one liable for</b> eating the forbidden fat of <b>each and every one</b> of them.",
            "All this teaches only that a separate prohibition applies to each type of animal. <b>And</b> with regard to the liability to receive lashes for eating each one <b>we derive the prohibition of:</b> “You shall eat <b>no fat,” and the prohibition of: “It shall be a perpetual statute,” from the</b> example of <b><i>karet</i></b> stated in the verse: <b>“For anyone who eats the fat of the domesticated animal, of which people present</b> an offering of fire to the Lord, the soul that eats it shall be cut off from its people” (Leviticus 7:25). <b>Just as that</b> verse serves <b>to separate</b> and teach that if one unwittingly ate the fat of an ox, a goat, and a sheep he is liable to bring a sin offering for each one, <b>so too, this</b> verse serves <b>to separate</b> and teach that one is liable to receive lashes for eating the fat of each one.",
            "<b>And the Rabbis</b> maintain <b>we derive</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of one standard <b>prohibition from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of another standard <b>prohibition,</b> but <b>we do not derive</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of a standard <b>prohibition from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of a prohibition whose transgression results in the punishment of <b><i>karet</i>.</b>",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>this is the reason of the Rabbis: As Rav Mari said to Rav Zevid</b> when asked about a different issue: <b>If that is so,</b> that a sheep tail is categorized as fat by the verses and is included in the portions of an offering for which one is liable for the misuse of consecrated property, then the <b>tail of a non-sacred</b> animal <b>should be prohibited</b> for consumption as forbidden fat. Rav Zevid <b>said to</b> Rav Mari: <b>With regard to your</b> claim, <b>the verse states</b> concerning forbidden fat: “You shall eat <b>no fat of ox, or sheep, or goat”</b> (Leviticus 7:23). This teaches that for the prohibition against eating forbidden fat to take effect <b>we require an item that is</b> found <b>equally in all three</b> types of animals, an ox, and a sheep, and a goat, <b>and that is not</b> the case here. Since an ox and goat do not have tails, the tail is not prohibited even in the case of a sheep.",
            "<b>Therefore,</b> the same applies with regard to the issue at hand: <b>When</b> the verse <b>“ox, or sheep, or goat” comes, it comes to permit</b> consumption of the <b>tail of a non-sacred</b> animal, and one cannot learn from here that a separate prohibition applies to each type of forbidden fat. <b>And Rabbi Yishmael</b> could <b>say to you</b> in response: <b>If so, let</b> the verse <b>state:</b> You shall eat <b>no fat of ox or sheep; why do I</b> need the mention of <b>a goat? Learn from it</b> that the verse serves <b>to separate</b> between them and render one liable to receive lashes for eating each type of forbidden fat.",
            "<b>Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> Although <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> maintains that one who unwittingly eats the fat of an ox, a sheep, and a goat is liable to receive a separate set of lashes for each one, he <b>concedes with regard to</b> bringing <b>an offering that</b> if he ate those types of forbidden fat in a single lapse of awareness he <b>brings only one sin offering. What is the reason?</b> The reason is <b>that this prohibition is not similar to the prohibition of those with whom relations are forbidden.</b> As derived in the Gemara on 2b, one who unwittingly engages in intercourse with many women to whom he is forbidden is liable to bring a sin offering for each act. In that context the verse states a separate prohibition for each forbidden relative, whereas in this case there is a single prohibition that applies to the forbidden fat of all domesticated animals.",
            "§ With regard to the sin offering required of one who transgresses the prohibition against eating forbidden fat, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “Speak to the children of Israel, saying: A soul that sins in error, from all the commandments of God that may not be performed, and from one of them” (Leviticus 4:2). This phrase should be interpreted as though it states: <b>And performs one,</b> and again states: <b>And performs them,</b> i.e., it serves <b>to render one liable</b> to bring a sin offering <b>for each and every</b> transgression.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: This teaches <b>that if one ate</b> forbidden <b>fat and</b> again ate forbidden <b>fat,</b> if it was from <b>one category,</b> i.e., the same type of forbidden fat, and he ate it <b>in two lapses of awareness,</b> that is, he was made aware of his sin after the first instance of consumption and then again ate unwittingly, he is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin offerings. If he ate forbidden fat from <b>two categories,</b> as the Gemara will soon explain, <b>in one lapse of awareness,</b> he is likewise <b>liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin offerings.",
            "<b>Rami bar Ḥama said to Rav Ḥisda: Granted,</b> one who ate forbidden fat from <b>one category in two lapses of awareness</b> is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin offerings, as this is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that the lapses of awareness separate</b> between his transgressions; each time he becomes aware of his transgression he is liable to bring another sin offering. <b>But</b> in a case where he ate forbidden fat from <b>two categories in one lapse of awareness, why</b> is he <b>liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin offerings? <b>We require separate lapses of awareness and that is not</b> the case here.",

This verse states: <b>“But everyone who eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has profaned the sacred thing of the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 19:8), <b>and it is written: “You shall burn the leftovers [<i>notar</i>] in fire;</b> they are not to be eaten, <b>for</b> they are <b>sacred”</b> (Exodus 29:34).

            "<b>Abaye says: A verbal analogy should never be lightly regarded in your eyes, as</b> the fact that one is punished with <i>karet</i> for engaging in intercourse with <b>one’s daughter</b> born <b>from the woman he raped is</b> one of <b>the fundamental</b> principles <b>of the Torah, and the verse taught it only through a verbal analogy.</b>",
            "Abaye elaborates: This is <b>as Rava says: Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Avdimi said to me</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is <b>derived</b> by a verbal analogy between the unusual form <b>“they [<i>henna</i>]”</b> and <b>“they [<i>henna</i>],”</b> written <b>with regard to the prohibition</b> against engaging in intercourse with one’s daughter born from the woman he raped. As it is written: “The nakedness of a woman and her daughter…you shall not take her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s daughter, to uncover her nakedness: They [<i>henna</i>] are near kinswomen” (Leviticus 18:17). And it is stated: “The nakedness of your son’s daughter, or of your daughter’s daughter; for they [<i>henna</i>] are your own nakedness” (Leviticus 18:10). This latter verse is interpreted as referring to one’s granddaughter from the woman he raped (see <i>Yevamot</i> 97a). The verbal analogy teaches that although one’s daughter from the woman he raped is not mentioned in the verse, she too is included with one’s granddaughter, just as a daughter and a granddaughter are equated in Leviticus 18:17.",
            "Furthermore, the punishment for this transgression of intercourse with one’s daughter from the woman he raped is <b>derived</b> from a verbal analogy between: “It is <b>lewdness”</b> (Leviticus 18:17), which is written with regard to engaging in intercourse with both a woman and her daughter, and the same term <b>“lewdness”</b> that appears elsewhere, which teaches that the transgressor is liable <b>to</b> be put to death by <b>burning.</b> As it is stated: “And if a man take with his wife also her mother, it is lewdness; they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they” (Leviticus 20:14). This teaches that death by burning is the punishment for engaging in intercourse with both a woman and her daughter, and the same applies to intercourse with one’s daughter from the woman he raped, due to the verbal analogy of <i>henna</i> and <i>henna</i> linking the two cases.",

Rav Kahana says</b> it is <b>taught: When</b> Aaron <b>would speak</b> his beard would move, and these drops <b>would</b> miraculously <b>rise and sit on the roots of his beard,</b> so that they would not fall to the ground. <b>And with regard to this matter Moses, our teacher, was concerned,</b> thinking: <b>Perhaps, God forbid, I misused the anointing oil</b> by pouring too much, which resulted in these two additional drops.",
            "<b>A Divine Voice emerged and said:</b> “It is like the precious oil upon the head, descending upon the beard; the beard of Aaron, that descends upon the collar of his garments, <b>like the dew of the Hermon that comes down upon the mountains of Zion”</b> (Psalms 133:2–3). This comparison serves to teach: <b>Just as the Hermon’s dew is not subject to misuse</b> of consecrated property, as it is not consecrated but can be used by all, <b>so too,</b> the anointing <b>oil that descends upon Aaron’s beard is not subject to misuse</b> of consecrated property.",
            "<b>And still Aaron himself was concerned,</b> thinking: <b>Perhaps Moses did not misuse</b> consecrated property <b>but I misused</b> the oil, as the additional oil is on my body and I derive benefit from it. <b>A Divine Voice emerged and said to him: “Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity”</b> (Psalms 133:1). <b>Just as</b> your brother <b>Moses did not misuse</b> consecrated property, <b>so too, you did not misuse</b> consecrated property.",
            "§ The Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> which discusses the anointing of kings. <b>The Sages taught: One may anoint kings only next to a spring.</b> This is done as a fortuitous sign, <b>so that their kingdom should continue</b> uninterrupted just as the waters of the spring flow uninterrupted throughout the year. <b>As it is stated</b> with regard to the coronation of Solomon in the days of King David: <b>And the king said to Benaiah:</b> Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon my own mule, <b>and bring him down to Gihon. And</b> let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet <b>anoint him there</b> king over Israel (see I Kings 1:33–34). The Sages derived from here that all kings should be anointed near a spring.",
            "Parenthetical to this matter of performing an act as a fortuitous sign, the Gemara cites that which <b>Rav Ami says: One who desires to know if he will</b> live <b>through</b> this current <b>year or not should bring</b> a lit <b>candle during those ten days between Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur and hang it in a house</b> through <b>which wind does not blow,</b> and he should watch it carefully: <b>If its light continues he shall know that he will live out his year.</b>",

The Gemara notes that Hannah said: <b>“My horn is exalted,” and</b> she did <b>not</b> say: <b>My jug is exalted.</b> With regard to <b>David and Solomon, who were anointed with</b> oil from <b>a horn,</b> this was a good omen for them, and <b>their kingships lasted.</b> But with regard to <b>Saul and Jehu, who were anointed</b> with oil <b>from a jug, their kingships did not last.</b>",
            "§ The mishna included in its list of those liable to receive <i>karet</i>: <b>One who blends the incense</b> according to the specifications of the incense used in the Temple service, for purposes other than use in the Temple. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who blends the incense</b> in order <b>to teach</b> himself how to prepare <b>it or</b> in order <b>to transfer it to the community is exempt</b> from liability.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And is there</b> the prohibition of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property with regard to smell? <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says in the name of bar Kappara:</b> With regard to exposure to the <b>sound, or</b> to the <b>sight, or</b> to the <b>smell</b> of consecrated items, including incense, these <b>are not subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property?",
            "The Gemara answers: With regard to exposure to the <b>smell</b> of the incense, the following distinction applies: The smell of the incense that is emitted when the spices are placed on the coals on the altar is subject to the prohibition, since this is the manner in which the mitzva is performed. By contrast, the smell emitted <b>after</b> the flame catches and <b>the column of smoke rises is not subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And why not</b> say that misuse of consecrated property applies to an item whose mitzva has been already performed? <b>But there is</b> the case of <b>the</b> daily <b>removal of the ashes</b> of the offerings from the altar, <b>whose mitzva has been performed,</b> as the offerings have been burnt, <b>and</b> yet one who uses the ashes is liable for <b>misusing</b> the ashes, as derived from the verse: “And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh; and he shall take up the ashes of what the fire has consumed of the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar” (Leviticus 6:3).",
            "The Gemara answers: This case does not disprove the principle, <b>since the</b> <i>halakhot</i> of <b>the removal of the ashes and the priestly vestments</b> of white linen worn by the High Priest on Yom Kippur are <b>two verses that come as one,</b> i.e., to teach the same matter, <b>and</b> there is a principle that <b>any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> their common aspect to apply to other cases. In other words, if a <i>halakha</i> is stated twice with regard to two separate cases, this <i>halakha</i> applies only to those cases. Had the Torah wanted to teach that this <i>halakha</i> applies to all other relevant cases as well, it would have mentioned it only once, and other cases would be derived from there.

Therefore, one should derive a principle from the verse discussing the removal of the ashes.",
            "The Gemara answers: One cannot derive a general principle from this case, <b>because the removal of the ashes and</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the heifer whose neck is broken,</b> from which one may not derive benefit after that rite has been performed, are <b>two verses that come as one, and any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> their common aspect to apply to other cases.

            "The Gemara further asks: <b>And what</b> is the meaning of the suggestion: The second <b>detail</b> is <b>in</b> the same category as the <b>first detail?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>this is what</b> is <b>difficult to</b> the <i>tanna</i>: Since it is derived by the principle of a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization that all items similar to those specified in the verse are included, as stated earlier that spices from <b>types of trees are derived from</b> the mention of <b>stacte and</b> spices <b>grown from the ground are derived from</b> the mention of <b>onycha,</b> one might say as follows: <b>Let them also learn from</b> the mention of <b>pure frankincense, which includes one aspect,</b> i.e., <b>that</b> one should <b>include an item whose scent diffuses, even though its smoke</b> does not <b>rise.</b>",
            "The Gemara continues: The <i>tanna</i> <b>then said</b> that this cannot be the case, as <b>if so, let the verse write “pure frankincense” in the middle,</b> between the two mentions of “spices,” alongside stacte, onycha, and galbanum, <b>and</b> then one would <b>derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from it.</b> Since the frankincense is mentioned after the second mention of “spices,” it is not part of the generalization, detail, and generalization.",
            "The Gemara questions this claim: <b>If</b> the verse were to <b>write “pure frankincense” in the middle, there</b> would be <b>twelve</b> ingredients in the incense, as that ingredient would also be included in the doubling of the second mention of “spices.” The Gemara explains: <b>If so,</b> that frankincense is meant to be one of the details, <b>let the verse write “pure frankincense” in the middle and “galbanum” at the end,</b> after the second mention of “spices.” Since the verse placed frankincense at the end, one cannot derive <i>halakhot</i> from it as a detail. <b>Reish Lakish says</b> that this <i>halakha</i> can be derived <b>from</b> the word incense <b>itself: What</b> is the meaning of the <b>term incense [<i>ketoret</i>]?</b> It means <b>an item that</b> produces <b>smoke [<i>koter</i>] and rises.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Ḥana bar Bizna says</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon Ḥasida says: Any fast that does not include</b> the participation of some <b>of the sinners of the Jewish people is not a fast, as the smell of galbanum is foul and</b> yet <b>the verse lists it with the ingredients of the incense. Abaye says</b> that this is derived <b>from here:</b> “It is He Who builds His upper chambers in the heavens <b>and has established His bundle on the earth”</b> (Amos 9:6), i.e., when the people are united as a bundle, including their sinners, they are established upon the earth.",
            "§ The mishna includes in its list of those liable to receive <i>karet</i>: <b>And one who applies the anointing oil</b> to his skin. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who applies the anointing oil to animals or vessels</b> is <b>exempt,</b> and one who applies it <b>to gentiles or to corpses</b> is <b>exempt.</b> The Gemara objects: <b>Granted,</b> one is exempt in the case of <b>animals and vessels, as it is written: “Upon the flesh of a person it shall not be applied”</b> (Exodus 30:32), <b>and animals and vessels are not</b> the flesh of <b>a person.</b> It is <b>also</b> clear why one is <b>exempt</b> if he applies it to <b>a corpse, as once someone has died,</b> the body <b>is called a corpse and not a person. But</b> if one applies anointing oil to <b>gentiles why</b> is he <b>exempt? Aren’t they</b> included in the meaning of the term <b>person [<i>adam</i>]?</b>",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>Indeed</b> they are not. <b>As it is written: “And you My sheep, the sheep of My pasture, are people [<i>adam</i>]”</b> (Ezekiel 34:31), from which it is derived that <b>you,</b> the Jewish people, <b>are called <i>adam</i>, but gentiles are not called <i>adam</i>.</b>",
            "The Gemara raises an objection based on a verse discussing captives taken during the war against Midian. <b>But isn’t it written: “And the people [<i>nefesh adam</i>] were sixteen thousand”</b> (Numbers 31:40). This indicates that gentiles are also referred to as <i>adam</i>. The Sage who was asked this <b>said to</b> the questioner: <b>That</b> term serves <b>to exclude,</b> i.e., to distinguish between the people who were taken captive and the <b>animals</b> that were taken as spoils of war, which are also mentioned in that verse.",
            "The Gemara raises another difficulty: <b>But isn’t it written: “And should I not have pity on Nineveh,</b> that great city, wherein are more than one hundred and twenty thousand people [<i>adam</i>] who cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand, and also much cattle” (Jonah 4:11). The inhabitants of Nineveh were gentiles. The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> term serves <b>to exclude</b> them from the <b>animals</b> mentioned in the verse.",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead a different reason why one who applies anointing oil to gentiles is exempt. This is <b>as a <i>tanna</i> teaches before Rabbi Elazar: Anyone included in</b> the obligation not to <b>apply</b> anointing oil to himself or others <b>is</b> likewise <b>included</b> as subject to the prohibition of: <b>It shall not be applied,</b> i.e., it is prohibited to apply the oil to him. <b>And anyone not included in</b> the obligation not <b>to apply</b> anointing oil to himself or others <b>is not included</b> as the object of: <b>It shall not be applied.</b> Only Jews are included in the prohibition against applying the anointing oil.",
            "<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who applies the anointing oil to animals or vessels,</b> or <b>to gentiles or</b> on <b>corpses,</b> is <b>exempt.</b> If one applies the anointing oil <b>to kings or to priests</b> after they had already been anointed, <b>Rabbi Meir deems</b> him <b>liable and Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> him <b>exempt.

Rabbi Yehuda says: An olive-bulk.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yehuda say</b> that he is entirely <b>exempt?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>When Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> him <b>exempt</b> that is <b>with regard to</b> applying oil to <b>kings and priests,</b> whereas in the case <b>of an ordinary</b> person Rabbi Yehuda <b>deems</b> him <b>liable.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Concerning what</b> matter do <b>Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda disagree? Rav Yosef says</b> that <b>they disagree concerning this</b> issue: <b>Rabbi Meir holds</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is based on the fact that <b>it is written: “Upon the flesh of a person it shall not be applied”</b> (Exodus 30:32), <b>and it is written: “Or whoever places any of it upon a stranger,</b> he shall be cut off from his people” (Exodus 30:33). The wording of the prohibition teaches with regard to the liability to receive <i>karet</i>: <b>Just as</b> the act of <b>applying</b> the oil to the skin prohibited by the verse refers to the application of <b>any amount,</b> as there is no specific measure stated in this regard, <b>so too,</b> the act of <b>placing</b> the oil mentioned with regard to <i>karet</i> refers to <b>any amount.</b>",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yehuda holds: We derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>placing [<i>netina</i>] that</b> is stated here, which is <b>upon a stranger,</b> i.e., one upon whom there is no mitzva to place the anointing oil, <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>giving [<i>netina</i>] in general. Just as giving in general</b> is with the amount of <b>an olive-bulk, so too, placing</b> anointing oil <b>upon a stranger</b> is with the amount of <b>an olive-bulk.</b> The principle that giving [<i>netina</i>] in general is with the amount of an olive-bulk is derived from the verse: “And if a man eats a sacred thing in error then he shall add a fifth part in addition to it, and shall give [<i>venatan</i>] to the priest the sacred item” (Leviticus 22:14). This verse is referring to an item given for eating, and the minimum amount that must be consumed for an act to be considered eating is an olive-bulk. Rav Yosef adds: <b>But</b> with regard to the mitzva of <b>applying</b> the oil in order <b>to anoint kings and priests, everyone agrees</b> it is accomplished with <b>any amount.</b>",
            "<b>And Rav Yosef</b> further <b>says: With regard to what</b> matter do <b>Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda disagree</b> in the case <b>of kings and priests</b> who had already been anointed? <b>Rabbi Meir holds</b> that since <b>it is written: “Or whoever puts any of it upon a stranger,” and</b> right <b>now</b> the <b>king and priest are strangers</b> because the mitzva to anoint them no longer applies, they are included in the prohibition. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda holds:</b> For the purposes of this prohibition <b>we require that</b> the individual in question <b>be a stranger from his beginning to his end, and</b> the <b>king and priest were initially not strangers.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Ika, son of Rav Ami, said: And</b> Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda both <b>follow their</b> lines of <b>reasoning, as it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 7:2):"

        [
            "With regard to <b>the daughter of a priest who married an Israelite and</b> then unwittingly <b>partook of <i>teruma</i>, she pays the principal,</b> as a thief would, as she partook of <i>teruma</i> to which she owns no rights. <b>But she does not pay the</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment, which is the fine paid by an Israelite who partakes of <i>teruma</i> unwittingly (see Leviticus 22:14). This is because she is not completely disqualified from the priesthood, since if she becomes widowed or divorced without having borne children she will again be permitted to partake of <i>teruma</i>. <b>And</b> if she commits adultery <b>her death</b> penalty is administered <b>by burning,</b> as is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the daughter of a priest (see Leviticus 21:9).",
            "By contrast, if <b>she married one of those who are unfit</b> for her to marry due to his lineage, thereby disqualifying herself from the priesthood for the future, <b>she pays</b> the <b>principal and</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment, <b>and her death</b> is <b>by strangulation,</b> as is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to Israelite women.

This opinion of the Rabbis is presumably that of Rabbi Yehuda, who is usually the disputant of Rabbi Meir.

            "<b>Rav Yosef said</b> the <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda applies <b>to the placing of the anointing oil, and</b> it is explained <b>by</b> those <b>answers that we answered</b> earlier, that according to Rabbi Meir one is liable for the placing of any amount, as the verse uses an expression of applying, whereas according to Rabbi Yehuda one is liable only if one places oil that is the volume of an olive-bulk. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>placing in general,</b> e.g., the prohibition not to place frankincense on the meal offering of a sinner (see Leviticus 5:11), <b>everyone agrees</b> one is liable for placing only the volume of <b>an olive-bulk.</b>",

This dual reading indicates that one who is commanded not to apply the oil is the same as the one upon whom it is prohibited to apply the oil, as stated by the <i>tanna</i>.",
            "§ <b>Rav Ḥananya taught</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>before Rava: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to a High Priest who took from the anointing oil that is on his head and placed it on his stomach; from where</b> is it derived <b>that he is liable?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “Upon the flesh of a person it shall not be applied”</b> (Exodus 30:32). <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: What is different between</b> this case and <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a priest who applied <i>teruma</i> oil</b> to himself, <b>the Israelite son of his daughter may rub against [<i>mitaggel</i>]</b> this oil <b>without concern</b> that he might be deriving benefit from <i>teruma</i>?",
            "Rav Ashi <b>said to him: There,</b> with regard to <i>teruma</i> oil, <b>it is written: “They will die through it if they profane it”</b> (Leviticus 22:9), and <b>since</b> the priest <b>has</b> already <b>profaned</b> the oil by using it, it is considered <b>profaned.

            "§ The mishna teaches: <b>For</b> any of <b>these</b> prohibitions, <b>one is liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> <b>for its intentional</b> violation and to bring a sin offering for its unwitting violation.

The Gemara notes that the mishna further <b>teaches:</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> for all the transgressions listed above <b>except for one who defiles the Temple,</b> i.e., he enters the Temple while ritually impure <b>or</b> renders <b>its consecrated items</b> ritually impure.

            "The <i>baraita</i> rejects this opinion: <b>No, if you said</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to a sin offering and a guilt offering, which do not atone for intentional</b> sins <b>as</b> they do for <b>unwitting</b> sins, <b>shall you</b> also <b>say</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to Yom Kippur, which does atone for intentional</b> sins <b>as</b> it does for <b>unwitting</b> sins?

            "The Gemara rejects this interpretation: Granted, the <b>offering is rejected</b> from the altar, and therefore it cannot be sacrificed at a later stage. But the <b>man</b> himself <b>is fit for atonement,</b> and he can bring another sin offering. The Gemara suggests another interpretation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rather,</b> it must be that the category of <b>those who repent</b> is referring to one <b>who says: My sin offering should atone for me, and</b> the category of <b>those who do not repent</b> is referring to one <b>who says: My sin offering should not atone for me.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>Conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that a sin offering does not atone for one who states beforehand: My sin offering should not atone for me, in contradiction of the earlier statement of Rava. Since Rava was aware of this <i>baraita</i>, he must have retracted his opinion.",
            "The Gemara continues its analysis of this <i>baraita</i> by comparing it to another <i>baraita</i>. <b>And</b> the Sages <b>raise a contradiction:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>Yom Kippur shall atone only for</b> one <b>who fasted on it and did not perform labor on it and declared it a holy convocation.</b> With regard to one who <b>did not fast on it, or performed labor on it, or did not declare it a holy convocation,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>Yom Kippur shall not atone</b> for him.

The Gemara explains: Here we <b>arrive at</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, and this</b> is what <b>Rabbi Akiva is saying to the Rabbis: You say</b> that the transgression of one who <b>blasphemes does not involve an action,</b> as <b>what is</b> the case of one who <b>blasphemes?</b> It is one who <b>blesses,</b> i.e., curses, <b>the Name,</b> i.e., God. <b>But</b> if so, then concerning the punishment of <b><i>karet</i> that is written:</b> “That person blasphemes the Lord; and that soul shall be cut off [<i>venikhreta</i>] from among his people” (Numbers 15:30), <b>for what</b> purpose <b>does it come,</b> if not to render him liable to bring an offering?",
            "The Rabbis <b>say to him:</b> It comes <b>to give</b> the punishment of <b><i>karet</i> to one who curses</b> God, in order to teach that the phrase: “Shall bear his sin,” written in the verse: “Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin” (Leviticus 24:15), is referring to <i>karet</i>, so that one can derive by verbal analogy that an individual who was obligated to bring a Paschal offering for the second <i>Pesaḥ</i> and did not do so is likewise liable to receive <i>karet</i>. <b>As it is written with regard to one who curses</b> God: “Whoever curses his God <b>shall bear his sin,” and it is written with regard to</b> one who was obligated to bring a Paschal offering for the <b>second <i>Pesaḥ</i></b> and did not do so: “That man <b>shall bear his sin”</b> (Numbers 9:13). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to one who curses God it is referring to the punishment of <b><i>karet</i>, so too here,</b> with regard to the Paschal offering it is referring to the punishment of <b><i>karet</i>.</b>",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the special emphasis in the mishna: <b>And likewise</b> a Canaanite <b>maidservant?</b> Why does the mishna deem it necessary to write this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>when we say:</b> With regard to <b>any mitzva in which a woman is obligated</b> a Canaanite <b>slave is</b> also <b>obligated in that</b> mitzva, <b>this statement</b> applies <b>with regard to a matter that is the same for a man and for a woman.

            "§ The mishna teaches: <b>These</b> women <b>bring</b> a sin <b>offering</b> but their sin offerings are not eaten. It then teaches that in a case where one miscarried a fetus of a type for which a woman is exempt from bringing an offering and the other one miscarried a fetus of a type for which a woman is obligated to bring an offering, Rabbi Yosei maintains that if both are standing together they bring one offering together. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> exactly <b>do they do? The two of them bring one definite</b> burnt <b>offering, and a sin offering of a bird</b> due to <b>uncertainty, and they</b> each <b>stipulate</b> that if she is obligated to bring the sin offering the animal is hers, and if not then it belongs to the other woman.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And is Rabbi Yosei of</b> the opinion that <b>a stipulation</b> is effective in the case of a sin offering? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (23a): With regard to a situation where one of two women unwittingly ate a piece of forbidden fat and is obligated to bring a sin offering, but it is unknown which woman, <b>Rabbi Shimon says: They both bring one sin offering</b> together, and <b>Rabbi Yosei says: They do not both bring one sin offering</b> together. <b>Evidently, Rabbi Yosei is not of</b> the opinion that <b>a stipulation</b> is effective with regard to a sin offering.",
            "<b>Rava said: Rabbi Yosei concedes</b> that a stipulation is effective <b>with regard to one who has not yet</b> brought <b>an atonement</b> offering to complete the purification process, as is the case concerning a woman after childbirth. <b>And likewise, when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Rabbi Yosei concedes with regard to one who has not yet</b> brought <b>an atonement</b> offering that a stipulation is effective.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this difference between the sin offering of one who has not yet brought an atonement offering and standard sin offerings? The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> with regard to a sin offering brought for a transgression, <b>the man requires</b> definite <b>awareness</b> of his transgression for him to be obligated to bring a sin offering, <b>as it is written: “If his sin,</b> which he has sinned, <b>be known to him”</b> (Leviticus 4:28). <b>Therefore,</b> in the case where one of two women ate forbidden fat, <b>they do not bring</b> a sin offering together <b>and stipulate</b> that it should be for whichever of them ate the forbidden fat. <b>But here,</b> with regard to a woman after a miscarriage, <b>when</b> these <b>women bring</b> their sin offering they do so only in order <b>to become permitted in the consumption of sacrificial</b> food, and therefore the stipulation is effective.",
            "The Gemara cites a proof that this distinction is in fact the opinion of Rabbi Yosei: <b>As it is taught in the latter clause of that</b> mishna that <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> With regard to <b>any sin offering that comes</b> as atonement <b>for a sin, two</b> people <b>do not bring it</b> together. This indicates that if a sin offering does not atone for a sin, two people can bring it together.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: And <b>these</b> women <b>do not bring</b> a sin offering, and among them are a woman who gives birth by caesarean section. <b>Rabbi Shimon deems</b> a woman <b>liable</b> to bring an offering <b>in</b> a case where she gives birth by <b>caesarean section.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason of Rabbi Shimon? Reish Lakish said</b> that <b>the verse states: “But if she bears a girl”</b> (Leviticus 12:5). The term “she bears” is superfluous in the context of the passage, and it serves <b>to include another</b> type of <b>birth,</b> and <b>what</b> is <b>it?</b> This is a birth by <b>caesarean section.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis, what is</b> their <b>reasoning? Rabbi Mani bar Pattish said</b> that their ruling is derived from the verse: <b>“If a woman conceives [<i>tazria</i>] and gives birth to a male”</b> (Leviticus 12:2). The word <i>tazria</i> literally means to receive seed, indicating that all the <i>halakhot</i> mentioned in that passage do not apply <b>unless she gives birth through the place where she receives seed,</b> not through any other place, such as in the case of a caesarean section.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> A woman who gives birth to a daughter counts fourteen days during which she is ritually impure. That is followed by sixty-six days during which she remains ritually pure even if she experiences a flow of blood. The Torah obligates a woman to bring her offering on the eighty-first day (see Leviticus 12:1–6). If the woman miscarries another fetus before that day, she is not required to bring an additional offering. In the case of a woman <b>who miscarries</b> a fetus <b>on the night of,</b> i.e., preceding, <b>the eighty-first</b> day, <b>Beit Shammai deem</b> her <b>exempt from</b> bringing a second <b>offering and Beit Hillel deem</b> her <b>liable</b> to bring a second offering.",
            "<b>Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai: What is different</b> between the <b>night of the eighty-first and</b> the <b>day of the eighty-first?

            "<b>Beit Shammai said to</b> Beit Hillel: <b>No,</b> there is a difference between that night and the following day. <b>If you said with regard to</b> a woman <b>who miscarries</b> on the <b>eighty-first day</b> that she is obligated to bring an additional offering, this is logical, <b>as she emerged into a period that is fit</b> for <b>her to bring</b> her <b>offering.</b> Would you <b>say</b> the same <b>with regard to</b> a woman <b>who miscarries on the night of</b> the <b>eighty-first</b> day, <b>where she did not emerge into a period that is fit</b> for <b>her to bring</b> her <b>offering,</b> as offerings are not sacrificed at night?",
            "<b>Beit Hillel said to</b> Beit Shammai: <b>But let</b> the case of a woman <b>who miscarries on</b> the <b>eighty-first day that occurs on Shabbat prove</b> that this distinction is incorrect, <b>as she did not emerge into a period that is fit</b> for <b>her to bring</b> her <b>offering</b> because individual offerings are not sacrificed on Shabbat, <b>and</b> nevertheless <b>she is obligated to bring</b> an additional <b>offering.</b>",
            "<b>Beit Shammai said to</b> Beit Hillel: <b>No,</b> there is a difference between these cases. <b>If you said</b> this ruling with regard to a woman <b>who miscarries on</b> the <b>eighty-first day that occurs on Shabbat,</b> the reason is <b>that although</b> Shabbat <b>is unfit for</b> the sacrifice of <b>an individual offering,</b> it is <b>fit for</b> the sacrifice of <b>a communal offering</b> whose time is fixed, e.g., the daily offering. Would you <b>say</b> the same <b>with regard to</b> a woman <b>who miscarries on the night of</b> the <b>eighty-first</b> day, <b>as the night is completely unfit,</b> since <b>neither an individual offering nor a communal offering</b> is sacrificed at night?",
            "Beit Shammai add: <b>And</b> as for the ritual impurity status of <b>the blood,</b> i.e., Beit Hillel’s opinion that the two time periods are equal with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity, this <b>does not prove</b> what the <i>halakha</i> should be with regard to offerings, <b>as</b> with regard to a woman <b>who miscarries</b> before the <b>completion</b> of the term of eighty days, <b>her blood is impure</b> like the blood of a woman after childbirth, and nevertheless <b>she is exempt from</b> bringing <b>the offering.</b>"

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> In continuation of the discussion of the mishna, it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai:</b> The verse <b>states:</b> “And when the days of her purification are fulfilled, for a son or <b>for a daughter”</b> (Leviticus 12:6). The entire clause: “For a son or for a daughter,” is superfluous and serves <b>to include the night</b> preceding the <b>eighty-first</b> day, i.e., if she has a miscarriage at that point she is obligated to bring another offering.",
            "The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Hoshaya would regularly</b> study <b>before bar Kappara. He</b> then <b>left him and came</b> to study <b>before Rabbi Ḥiyya. One day</b> Rabbi Hoshaya <b>encountered</b> bar Kappara and <b>raised</b> the following <b>dilemma before him:</b> With regard to <b>a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>zav</i>],</b> who is obligated to bring an offering on the eighth day of his purification for three discharges, if <b>he saw</b> another <b>three sightings,</b> i.e., experienced an additional three discharges, <b>on the night</b> preceding the <b>eighth</b> day, <b>what do Beit Hillel say about this matter?</b> Must the <i>zav</i> bring a separate offering for this impurity as he would if he experienced the discharges on the eighth day?",
            "Rabbi Hoshaya explains the sides of the dilemma: Is the <b>reason</b> for the ruling <b>of Beit Hillel that</b> a woman <b>who miscarries on the night</b> preceding the eighty-first day must bring an additional offering <b>due to</b> the derivation from the verse, <b>as it is written:</b> “For a son or <b>for a daughter”?

            "<b>Bar Kappara said to</b> Rabbi Hoshaya: <b>What does</b> the <b>Babylonian,</b> i.e., Rabbi Ḥiyya, who came from Babylonia, <b>say about this matter?

This indicates that the <i>halakha</i> applies only in the case of a woman after childbirth.",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> this dilemma <b>is subject</b> to a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b> With regard to <b>a <i>zav</i> who saw three sightings on the night</b> preceding the <b>eighth</b> day, it <b>is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i> that he <b>brings</b> an additional offering, <b>and</b> it <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that he <b>does not bring</b> another offering. <b>What, is it not</b> the case that this <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>?

            "<b>Rav Huna bar Aḥa said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said: These <i>tanna’im</i></b> both <b>hold</b> that <b>night</b> is considered part of a date <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived, and therefore a <i>zav</i> who experienced three discharges on the night preceding the eighth day does not bring another offering. <b>And</b> the ruling of <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i>, <b>which taught</b> that he <b>brings</b> an additional offering, is stated <b>with regard to a <i>zav</i> who experienced two sightings.</b> Since this <i>zav</i> has completed his purification process, as he is not obligated to bring an offering, these discharges constitute a new instance of ritual impurity. <b>And</b> the ruling of <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, <b>which taught</b> that he <b>does not bring</b> another offering, is stated <b>with regard to a <i>zav</i> who</b> had <b>experienced three sightings.</b> This <i>zav</i> must bring an offering, and the time for the offering has not yet arrived on the eighth night. Therefore, he is not obligated to bring another offering.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: If the ruling of that <i>baraita</i> is stated with regard to <b>a <i>zav</i> who experienced two sightings, what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> this <i>halakha</i>? It is obvious that this is a new instance of ritual impurity. The Gemara explains: <b>This</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us:</b> It is <b>specifically</b> if this <i>zav</i> <b>saw</b> a discharge <b>on the night</b> preceding the <b>eighth</b> day that he must bring an offering; <b>but</b> if he saw a discharge <b>on</b> the <b>seventh day</b> he is <b>not</b> obligated to bring an offering. This is because the <i>tanna</i> of this <i>baraita</i> <b>holds: Any sighting</b> of <i>ziva</i> <b>that negates</b> the days of purity, i.e., which causes the <i>zav</i> to have to count seven clean days afresh, <b>does not bring</b> him <b>to</b> the point of being liable to bring another <b>offering.</b>",
            "<b>Rava said: Why did you interpret that which is taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, i.e., that he <b>does not bring</b> another offering, as stating a ruling <b>with regard to a <i>zav</i> who experienced three sightings?</b> If that is correct, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach</b> this example <b>in</b> the list that appears in a mishna from the next chapter (9a): There are <b>five</b> people who <b>bring one offering for multiple transgressions,</b> i.e., for violating the same transgression several times. The Gemara explains: The <i>tanna</i> did not include this case in that list because he could <b>not</b> state this <i>halakha</i> as <b>a definitive</b> ruling. <b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If the <i>zav</i> <b>saw one</b> discharge <b>at night and</b> then <b>two on the</b> eighth <b>day,</b> he <b>brings</b> an additional offering for these discharges. By contrast, if he saw <b>two</b> discharges <b>at night and one in the day,</b> he <b>does not bring</b> an additional offering.",
            "<b>Rav Yosef said: Know that</b> if a <i>zav</i> saw <b>one</b> discharge <b>at night and two in the day</b> he <b>brings</b> an additional offering. This is <b>because</b> the <b>first sighting</b> of any <i>zav</i> is considered <b>merely semen,</b> since one who has a single discharge of <i>ziva</i> immerses on that day and is rendered ritually pure at sundown, like one who experiences a seminal emission. <b>And yet</b> if he <b>sees two other</b> discharges <b>they combine</b> with the first one <b>to</b> establish <b>him</b> as a <i>zav</i> and render him liable to bring an offering. The same applies in this case with regard to the eighth day.",
            "<b>Rav Sheshet, son of Rav Idi, said: Are the cases comparable?</b> With regard to the <b>first sighting of a <i>zav</i>, he saw it at a time of</b> potential <b>liability</b> to bring an offering, which is why it combines with the next two discharges. By contrast, in a case where a <i>zav</i> sees <b>one</b> discharge <b>at night</b> preceding the eighth day, <b>since he saw it</b> when it was <b>not the time of</b> potential <b>liability</b> to bring an offering for the subsequent two sightings, as one who sees three discharges on the night preceding the eighth day does not bring an additional offering, <b>were it not</b> for the fact <b>that Rabbi Yoḥanan teaches us that it combines</b> with the other two discharges <b>I would say</b> it <b>does not combine</b> with them.",

            "<b>But doesn’t Ḥizkiyya say</b> that if a nazirite contracted ritual impurity through contact with a corpse and underwent the purification rites, after which he must bring an offering on the eighth day, and he again <b>became ritually impure on the</b> eighth <b>day</b> itself, he <b>brings</b> a second set of offerings. But if he became ritually impure <b>on the night</b> preceding the eighth day he <b>does not bring</b> an additional set of offerings, because he could not have brought the offering at night. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Even</b> if the nazirite became ritually impure <b>on the night</b> preceding the eighth day, he <b>brings</b> a second set of offerings.

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna lists four individuals whose status is defined as lacking atonement until their offering is brought: The <i>zav</i>, the <i>zava</i>, the woman after childbirth, and the leper. The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>a <i>zav</i> and a <i>zava</i>, that</b> the <i>tanna</i> decided to <b>count them as two</b> separate cases? The Gemara answers: They are different <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that the impurity of</b> a <i>zav</i> <b>is distinct</b> from that of a <i>zava</i>, <b>as a <i>zav</i> does not become impure</b> if he has a discharge <b>by accident,</b> i.e., due to a cause such as an illness or having consumed certain foods, whereas there is no such exemption in the case of a <i>zava</i>; <b>and a <i>zava</i>,</b> unlike a <i>zav</i>, <b>does not become impure by</b> three <b>sightings</b> of menstrual-type blood on one day <b>like</b> she becomes impure <b>by</b> sightings on three consecutive <b>days.</b>",
            "<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “When any man has a discharge from his flesh, his discharge is impure” (Leviticus 15:2).

            "The Gemara objects: <b>If so,</b> then <b>even a meal offering</b> should fulfill the convert’s obligation.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And where was a bird</b> offering <b>included</b> as an option?

            "The Gemara challenges Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s statement: <b>And</b> is it true that we have <b>not</b> found an offering of an individual bird anywhere in the Torah? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to a bird sacrificed as a burnt offering: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall sacrifice it”</b> (Leviticus 1:15). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> this? <b>Since</b> it <b>is stated about doves: “And he shall sacrifice</b> his offering of doves” (Leviticus 1:14), in the plural, <b>I</b> might <b>derive</b> from here that <b>the one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a bird</b> as <b>a burnt offering, shall not bring less than two young birds.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And</b> the priest <b>shall sacrifice it”</b> (Leviticus 1:15), in the singular, to teach that one may bring a gift offering of <b>even one</b> single <b>young bird.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>In any event, we have not found an obligatory</b> offering of just one bird.",
            "The Gemara challenges this assertion as well: <b>But isn’t there</b> the offering of <b>a woman after childbirth, who brings</b> a single <b>pigeon or dove as a sin offering</b> (Leviticus 12:6)?

            "The Gemara returns to the main part of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s statement. <b>The Master said: Just as your ancestors entered the covenant only</b> through circumcision, immersion in a ritual bath, and the sprinkling of blood, converts must do the same. The Gemara objects: <b>Granted,</b> they underwent <b>circumcision</b> prior to entering the covenant, <b>as it is written: “For all the nation that left</b> Egypt <b>was circumcised”</b> (Joshua 5:5). <b>Alternatively,</b> it may be derived <b>from here,</b> a verse describing the redemption from Egypt: <b>“And when I passed by you, and saw you wallowing in your blood, I said unto you: In your blood, live;</b> and I said unto you: In your blood, live” (Ezekiel 16:6).

In such a case, even the Rabbis would maintain that the second birth does not interrupt the term following the first.

            "The Gemara elaborates: <b>A woman after childbirth brings</b> a sliding-scale offering either <b>in poverty,</b> i.e., two doves or two pigeons, one as a burnt offering and one as a sin offering, <b>or</b> in <b>wealth,</b> i.e., a lamb as a burnt offering and a dove or a pigeon as a sin offering (see Leviticus 12:1–8). <b>A leper brings</b> the offering either <b>in poverty</b> in the form of a lamb for a guilt offering, and two doves or two pigeons, one as a sin offering and one as a burnt offering, or in wealth in the form of a lamb for a guilt offering, a lamb as a burnt offering, and a female lamb as a sin offering (see Leviticus 14:10–22).

            "It <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: When offerings are brought in poverty rather than wealth, <b>there is</b> a case in which one <b>brings one</b> offering <b>instead of</b> a different <b>one; there is</b> a case in which one <b>brings two</b> offerings <b>instead of two</b> other offerings; <b>there is</b> a case in which one <b>brings two</b> offerings <b>instead of one</b> offering; and <b>there is</b> a case in which one <b>brings one</b> offering <b>instead of two</b> offerings. <b>From here you may derive</b> that the offering <b>of one-tenth of an ephah</b> may be worth as little <b>as one <i>peruta</i>.</b>",

            "<b>From where</b> is this <i>halakha</i> derived?

            "<b>And if you would say</b> that the mother’s milk <b>was not rendered susceptible</b> to impurity because it never came into contact with a liquid, which is necessary in order to render a food item susceptible to impurity, that is not so, as <b>it</b> is <b>rendered susceptible</b> to ritual impurity <b>due to the drop</b> of milk that is <b>smeared on the nipple.</b> Since this drop is not consumed by the child, it attains the status of a liquid rather than a food, and it subsequently renders the rest of the milk that passes through the nipple susceptible to impurity. <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where the child nursed <b>with one strong</b> suck, and therefore it did <b>not leave a drop</b> of milk <b>smeared on the nipple.</b>",

This is because <b>the location</b> from which <b>the milk</b> emerges <b>is a spring,</b> i.e., it has the same status as the woman’s body. Therefore, if the woman is impure, her milk is also impure.",
            "Rava elaborates: <b>As</b> a mishna (<i>Makhshirin</i> 6:8) <b>teaches: A woman’s milk renders</b> food with which it comes into contact susceptible to <b>impurity, whether</b> it <b>emerges to</b> the <b>satisfaction</b> of the infant <b>or not to</b> its <b>satisfaction.</b> By contrast, the milk of <b>an animal renders</b> food susceptible <b>to impurity only</b> if it emerges <b>to</b> the <b>satisfaction</b> of the animal’s owner.",

This means that it need not come into contact with a liquid in order to become impure or to impart impurity to another item. The question therefore remains: Why does the child remain pure when he drinks this impure liquid?",
            "<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that <b>this is the reason that her child</b> remains <b>pure:</b> The reason is <b>that</b> it is <b>uncertain</b> whether it <b>nursed the measure</b> of milk necessary to disqualify it from consuming <i>teruma</i>, <b>or</b> whether it did <b>not nurse</b> a sufficient amount of milk. <b>And</b> even <b>if you say</b> that it <b>nursed</b> a sufficient amount of milk, it is still <b>uncertain</b> whether it <b>nursed</b> the required amount of milk <b>within</b> the time it takes to <b>eat a half-loaf</b> of bread, or whether it <b>nursed</b> that amount <b>in more than</b> the time it takes <b>to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread and therefore is not disqualified from consuming <i>teruma</i>.",

            "<b>Rava said: Perhaps it is not so,</b> as Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri would not agree with the ruling of Sumakhos.

            "<b>But with regard to</b> the case of slaughtering <b>a mother and its offspring</b> in a single day, <b>where all of</b> the permutations <b>are called: A mother and its offspring, as there are no differentiated names</b> given in the Torah for slaughtering a mother animal and then its offspring or for slaughtering the offspring and subsequently its mother, Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri might maintain that one is <b>not</b> liable to receive multiple sets of lashes.",

            "The Gemara raises an objection: This line of reasoning <b>can be refuted,</b> as follows: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about</b> the case of <b>five menstruating women</b> that would render one liable to bring a separate sin offering for having intercourse with each one of them?

            "<b>Rather,</b> the reason one is liable to bring three separate sin offerings for engaging in intercourse with his sister who is also the sister of his mother and the sister of his father is that <b>the verse states:</b> “And if a man takes his sister…and they shall be cut off [<i>venikhretu</i>] in the sight of the children of their people; <b>he has uncovered his sister’s nakedness”</b> (Leviticus 20:17).

            "<b>Rabba said: The reason</b> for the ruling <b>of Rabbi Eliezer there,</b> in the case of forbidden relations, is <b>that</b> the sinner <b>performed two</b> separate prohibited acts; and <b>here too, he has performed two</b> separate acts of reaping and is liable to bring two sin offerings. <b>And Rav Yosef said: The reason</b> for the ruling <b>of Rabbi Eliezer there,</b> in the case of forbidden relations, is <b>that it is impossible for him to combine</b> the two transgressions into a single act; <b>but</b> if it is <b>possible for him to combine them,</b> e.g., by reaping two fig-bulks of grain, <b>he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin offering.",
            "<b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: Each type of labor prohibited on Shabbat comprises acts that are primary categories of that labor and acts that are subcategories of that labor, both prohibited by Torah law. <b>Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> one <b>liable</b> to bring separate sin offerings <b>for</b> the performance of <b>subcategories</b> of prohibited <b>labor</b> on Shabbat <b>in a situation</b> where he also performed the corresponding <b>primary categories of</b> prohibited <b>labor</b> during the same lapse of awareness.

            "<b>If</b> you suggest that they disagree <b>with regard to</b> a case where one acts <b>unwittingly</b> in that he does not know it is <b>Shabbat and intentionally</b> in that he knows his actions constitute prohibited <b>labors,</b> then that cannot be correct.

It might be suggested that if one adds a single thread to a preexisting woven fabric, Rabban Gamliel would deem him liable whereas Rabbi Eliezer would deem him exempt. And yet Rabban Gamliel concedes that if one writes one letter next to a letter written on the previous Shabbat he is exempt. This suggestion is also difficult, as Rabbi Eliezer <b>deems</b> one <b>liable</b> in the case of adding a single thread, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 105a) that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: One who weaves three threads at the beginning</b> of a new fabric, <b>or</b> adds <b>one</b> thread <b>to</b> a preexisting <b>woven fabric,</b> is <b>liable.</b>",

Another <i>baraita</i> then states that although Rabban Gamliel maintains that the separate domains do not cause the two acts to be considered separate, he concedes that individual <i>Shabbatot</i> are considered separate entities, and therefore writing two letters on two different <i>Shabbatot</i> is considered two separate acts and the individual is exempt.",

            "§ <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> In a case where <b>one had two pieces</b> of fat <b>before him, one of</b> permitted <b>fat and one of</b> forbidden <b>fat, and</b> he <b>ate one of them and he does not know which of them he ate,</b> he is <b>obligated</b> to bring a provisional guilt offering.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> difference <b>is there between</b> the reasoning for Rav’s opinion given by Rav Naḥman, that one is liable in the case of two pieces because the <b>prohibition was established,</b> and the reasoning given by Rabbi Zeira, <b>that</b> if there is one piece <b>it is impossible to identify its prohibition?</b>",

This demonstrates that according to Rabbi Meir it is not necessary for the prohibition to be established for one to be obligated to bring a provisional guilt offering.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But why</b> did Rav Naḥman say that he could have responded to Rava’s contradiction by claiming the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir? <b>Let him say to him that</b> the mishna <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> as was the response to the previous objections. The Gemara explains that <b>this</b> is what Rav Naḥman <b>is teaching us: That</b> the reason for the ruling of <b>Rabbi Meir</b> is that he <b>holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who says an established prohibition is not required for one to be obligated in a provisional guilt offering.",

The Rabbis disagree and maintain that a provisional guilt offering may be brought only in a case of actual uncertainty whether one performed a sin for which he would be liable to bring a sin offering.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> did Rav <b>specifically</b> choose a case <b>where one ate</b> the item of uncertain status in order <b>to</b> exemplify the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer?

He said: If they would have allowed me to do so I would have brought a provisional guilt offering even on that day. <b>But they say to him: Wait until you enter into a situation of potential uncertainty.</b> For this reason Rav presents a scenario where an item whose status is uncertain was consumed, in order to allow for the potential uncertainty that would justify bringing a provisional guilt offering.",
            "§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case where <b>one had before him two pieces</b> of fat, <b>one of</b> permitted <b>fat and one of</b> forbidden <b>fat,</b> if <b>a Jew came and ate the first</b> piece and then <b>a gentile came and ate the second,</b> the Jew is <b>liable</b> to bring a provisional guilt offering. <b>And the same</b> applies if <b>a dog</b> ate the second piece <b>and the same</b> is true if <b>a raven</b> ate it.

            "The Gemara cites another version of the difficulty raised against Abaye’s opinion: <b>Some say</b> that <b>Rava bar Ḥanan said to Abaye:</b> Since Yom Kippur serves to divide the two acts of consumption into two obligations, similar to knowledge of the questionable status of fat according to Abaye, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in the following case: <b>If</b> one <b>ate an olive-bulk of</b> forbidden <b>fat</b> on the <b>morning of Yom Kippur and an olive-bulk of</b> forbidden <b>fat in</b> the <b>afternoon of Yom Kippur, so too</b> would he <b>be obligated</b> to bring <b>two sin offerings?</b> This cannot be correct, as both olive-bulks were consumed in a single lapse of awareness.",
            "<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava bar Ḥanan: <b>Who shall say to us that Yom Kippur provides atonement at every hour</b> of the day? <b>Perhaps the entire day</b> as a single unit serves to provide atonement only when it begins, <b>in the evening? Rabba bar bar Ḥana said to him: Fool [<i>terada</i>]!

            "<b>Rav Idi bar Avin raises</b> another <b>objection</b> to Abaye’s opinion from a mishna (<i>Yoma</i> 81a): If <b>one ate and drank</b> unwittingly on Yom Kippur <b>in one lapse of awareness,</b> e.g., he forgot it was Yom Kippur, <b>he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one sin offering. But</b> according to Abaye he should be liable to bring two sin offerings, as <b>between</b> the <b>eating and</b> the <b>drinking it is impossible that there was no</b> interval of even a minimal amount of <b>time during the day.

            "Rav Idi bar Avin concludes his objection: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that <b>knowledge</b> of <b>uncertainty</b> prior to each possible transgression <b>divides</b> them into obligations <b>to</b> bring separate <b>sin offerings</b> for each one, this lapse of time on Yom Kippur should serve to divide his two transgressions and therefore <b>he should be liable</b> to bring <b>two sin offerings.</b> The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>When Rabbi Zeira said</b> that knowledge of uncertainty prior to each unwitting transgression divides them into obligations to bring separate sin offerings, he was clarifying the opinion <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. By contrast, <b>this</b> mishna, which indicates that the passage of time on Yom Kippur does not divide transgressions into obligations for separate sin offerings, <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>",
            "The Gemara objects: <b>But from</b> the fact that <b>the latter clause</b> of that mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, it follows that the first clause is also in accordance with his opinion. This is significant, <b>as</b> that same mishna later <b>teaches</b> (<i>Yoma</i> 81a): If on Yom Kippur one <b>drank</b> the salty <b>liquid</b> in which fish are pickled, <b>or fish brine [<i>morayes</i>],</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> One can infer: <b>But</b> if he drank <b>vinegar</b> he is <b>liable.</b>",
            "<b>And who is</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna? <b>It is Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Vinegar does not revive the spirit,</b> i.e., it does not have the status of a beverage, and therefore one who drinks it on Yom Kippur is exempt. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: I say</b> that <b>vinegar does revive the spirit</b> and is therefore considered like a beverage. <b>And from</b> the fact that <b>the latter clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>the first clause</b> must <b>also</b> be in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.

            "<b>Rava raised</b> another <b>objection</b> to Abaye from a <i>baraita</i>: One is obligated to bring a guilt offering for misuse of consecrated property only if he derived benefit of at least the value of one <i>peruta</i> from the property. If one unwittingly <b>ate</b> from consecrated property <b>today</b> and <b>ate</b> again <b>tomorrow,</b> or if he <b>derived benefit</b> from consecrated property <b>today</b> and again <b>derived benefit tomorrow,</b> or if he <b>ate</b> from the property <b>today</b> and <b>derived benefit</b> from it <b>tomorrow,</b> or if he <b>derived benefit</b> from it <b>today</b> and <b>ate</b> from it <b>tomorrow, even</b> if the time between them was as long as <b>from now until three years</b> later, <b>from where</b> is it derived <b>that they combine with each other</b> to amount to one <i>peruta</i>-worth of benefit and thereby render him obligated to bring a guilt offering?",
            "The <i>baraita</i> answers that <b>the verse states:</b> “If anyone <b>commits a misuse [<i>tim’ol ma’al</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 5:15). The double verb [<i>tim’ol ma’al</i>] <b>extended</b> the obligation to bring a guilt offering for misuse of consecrated property to a case where the value of individual instances of misuse at different times amount to a total of one <i>peruta</i>. Rava concludes his objection: <b>But why</b> should that be the <i>halakha</i> according to Abaye, who maintains that knowledge of uncertainty, and similarly the day of Yom Kippur, which has the same effect as a provisional guilt offering, divides his actions into separate entities? When the second misuse occurs after Yom Kippur, <b>isn’t his</b> sin <b>atoned</b> for <b>by Yom Kippur?</b> Since his acts of possible transgression are divided, how can they combine to the value of one <i>peruta</i>?",
            "The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>When</b> does <b>Yom Kippur atone</b> for sins? Only <b>with regard to ritual prohibitions.</b> But it does <b>not atone with regard to monetary matters.</b> Misuse of consecrated property entails a monetary obligation to restore the value of the principal with the addition of one-fifth. Since Yom Kippur does not exempt one from the monetary obligation entailed by a sin, the two acts of misuse combine to render one obligated to bring a guilt offering.",
            "The Gemara suggests another answer. <b>If you wish, say</b> instead: <b>When does Yom Kippur atone</b> for sins? It atones for sins only if they were committed <b>in their full measure,</b> but it does <b>not atone for</b> sins that one transgressed only by <b>half of</b> their full <b>measure.</b> Consequently, Yom Kippur does not atone for misuse of consecrated property of the value of less than one <i>peruta</i>, which is why the two acts of misuse combine.",
            "§ The Gemara cites the opinions of other <i>amora’im</i> with regard to this matter. <b>Similarly,</b> like Rabbi Zeira, <b>Reish Lakish says: Here,</b> in his statement in the <i>baraita</i> above, <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>taught</b> that <b>knowledge of uncertain</b> status prior to each possible transgression <b>divides</b> them into separate obligations <b>to</b> bring <b>sin offerings</b> for each one.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to Rabbi Yoḥanan, this is</b> why the <i>baraita</i> is formulated in a manner that indicates the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a provisional guilt offering is dependent upon</b> the <i>halakhot</i> governing the <b>sin offering.</b> Just as knowledge of an unwitting transgression renders one liable to bring a sin offering, so too, knowledge of uncertainty renders one liable to bring a provisional guilt offering. <b>But according to Reish Lakish,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>should have taught</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a sin offering</b> is <b>dependent upon</b> the knowledge of uncertainty necessary to render one liable to bring a provisional <b>guilt offering,</b> rather than the other way around.

            "Before explaining the contradictions between the opinions of Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish, the Gemara asks a question about Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda’s statement: Can it be that Rabbi Shimon holds that one is exempt <b>even in the first case?</b> Since he walked down both paths prior to entering the Temple, he had definite knowledge of his impure status. <b>Rava said: What are we dealing with here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where he walked on the first</b> path, <b>and at the time of his walking on the second</b> path <b>he forgot that he</b> had previously <b>walked on the first</b> path.

            "The Gemara returns to discuss the contradictions for which it cited this <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said:</b> If he <b>walked on the first</b> path <b>and entered</b> the Temple, <b>and</b> then he received the <b>sprinkling</b> of the ashes of the red heifer on the third and seventh days, <b>and immersed, and</b> subsequently <b>walked on the second</b> path <b>and entered</b> the Temple, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering. The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> is he <b>liable?</b> After all, <b>he did not have</b> definite <b>knowledge</b> of his ritual impurity each time he entered the Temple. Although it is certain that after walking on the second path he had contracted ritual impurity at some point, as he had been purified in between, there was no specific point at which he had knowledge of definite impurity.",
            "<b>Reish Lakish said:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, who does not require knowledge at the outset,</b> before an unwitting transgression, in order to render one liable to bring a sin offering. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: You</b> may <b>even say</b> that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who maintain that definite knowledge is necessary to render one liable to bring a sin offering, as <b>here they rendered uncertain knowledge like</b> full <b>knowledge.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains the contradiction: <b>It enters your mind</b> to say that Rabbi Yoḥanan meant that <b>here they rendered</b> uncertain knowledge like full knowledge, <b>and the same is true for the entire Torah.</b> Therefore, it is <b>difficult,</b> as there is an apparent contradiction between the statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> above and this statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b> Here, Rabbi Yoḥanan says that uncertain knowledge is considered like full knowledge, whereas earlier he stated that uncertain knowledge, unlike full knowledge, does not divide separate unwitting transgressions to render one obligated to bring multiple sin offerings.",
            "<b>And</b> likewise it is <b>difficult</b> with regard to the apparent contradiction between the statement <b>of Reish Lakish</b> earlier and the statement <b>of Reish Lakish</b> here. Reish Lakish previously stated that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi maintains that uncertain knowledge divides unwitting transgressions to render one obligated to bring separate sin offerings, whereas here he explains that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael, not Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>Granted,</b> the apparent contradiction between one statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> and the other statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> is <b>not difficult.</b> One can answer that when he said: <b>Here they rendered</b> uncertain knowledge like full knowledge, he meant specifically here, <b>but with regard to the entire Torah</b> it is <b>not</b> considered like full knowledge.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that this particular case is an exception? <b>Here, with regard to ritual impurity, it is written:</b> “Or if anyone touch any impure thing…<b>and it was concealed from him that he is impure”</b> (Leviticus 5:2). This indicates that even when one has <b>knowledge that has an uncertainty to it, the verse renders</b> him <b>obligated</b> to bring an offering. <b>But with regard to</b> the rest of <b>the entire Torah it is written:</b> “If his sin, <b>which he has sinned, be known to him”</b> (Leviticus 4:28). This teaches that <b>it is</b> only <b>if he has</b> full <b>knowledge that he is obligated</b> to bring an offering.",
            "<b>But</b> the contradiction between one statement of Reish Lakish and the other statement <b>of Reish Lakish</b> is <b>difficult: Instead of interpreting</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, he should interpret it in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is what Reish Lakish <b>is teaching us</b> by establishing the <i>baraita</i> in accordance with Rabbi Yishmael: <b>That Rabbi Yishmael also does not require knowledge at the outset,</b> before an unwitting transgression, in order to render one liable to bring a sin offering.",
            "The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> that is already taught explicitly in <b>a mishna, as we learned</b> (<i>Shevuot</i> 14b) that <b>Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> The verse states: <b>“It was concealed from him”</b> (Leviticus 5:2–3), <b>twice.</b> One mention of the phrase serves <b>to render one obligated</b> to bring a sin offering <b>for a lapse of awareness</b> of his state of <b>ritual impurity</b> when he entered the Temple, <b>and</b> the other mention of the phrase teaches that he is obligated to bring a sin offering <b>for a lapse of awareness</b> during which he forgot that the building he was entering while impure was the <b>Temple.</b> Since this is the same verse that is the source for the requirement of knowledge at the outset, evidently Rabbi Yishmael disagrees with this opinion, as he derives a different <i>halakha</i> from the verse.",
            "The Gemara explains: It <b>was necessary</b> for Reish Lakish to state that Rabbi Yishmael does not require knowledge at the outset, as it might <b>enter your mind to say:</b> Although Rabbi Yishmael <b>has no verse</b> from which he could derive this requirement, perhaps <b>he has a tradition</b> with regard to the requirement of prior knowledge. By establishing that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael, Reish Lakish <b>teaches us</b> conclusively that Rabbi Yishmael does not require knowledge at the outset.",

            "With regard to Rava’s explanation, the Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> that supports the claim that if one intended to perform two prohibited labors in one order and mistakenly reversed the order, he is exempt. <b>And it is taught:</b> If someone <b>had before him two long candles</b> that were <b>lit, and</b> he <b>intended to extinguish this</b> one <b>and</b> instead he <b>extinguished that</b> one, or if he intended <b>to light this</b> one <b>and</b> instead he <b>lit that one,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> But in a case where he intended <b>to light</b> one <b>and</b> then <b>extinguish</b> the other, <b>and</b> instead he drew a breath and blew the flame from one candle to the other, as he accomplished his intention and <b>extinguished</b> one <b>and lit</b> the other, albeit <b>with one breath,</b> he is <b>liable.</b> This indicates that if he had not performed the two acts simultaneously, but in the reverse order, he is exempt.",
            "With regard to the last ruling, the Gemara asks: Isn’t this <b>obvious?</b> Since he accomplished his act as he had intended, he is clearly liable. The Gemara answers that the ruling is necessary, <b>lest you say: He did not</b> actually <b>perform</b> the labors in accordance with <b>his thought, as</b> he <b>wanted to light</b> one <b>initially and ultimately to extinguish</b> the other, <b>but when he performed</b> the <b>action, it</b> might be considered as though <b>he</b> first <b>extinguished</b> one <b>and ultimately lit</b> the other. <b>And</b> therefore one might <b>say</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> Consequently, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that <b>although he did not perform</b> the lighting <b>first,</b> as he had intended, nevertheless he <b>also did not</b> perform the lighting <b>after</b> the extinguishing, as they occurred simultaneously. Since his action did not entirely contradict his intention, he is liable.",
            "§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who stokes coals on Shabbat</b> is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a sin offering. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok:</b> He is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin offerings, <b>because he extinguishes the upper</b> coals that are moved to the bottom, due to lack of oxygen, <b>and he ignites the bottom</b> coals as he moves them to the top. The Gemara asks: <b>What are we dealing with</b> here? <b>If</b> it is a case <b>where he intends to extinguish and kindle, what is the reason of the one who exempts</b> him? <b>Rather,</b> it must be <b>that</b> he <b>does not intend to kindle,</b> but only to extinguish.

            "<b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Ḥanina both say</b> in explanation: The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> a blacksmith needed the coals on top and <b>he</b> therefore <b>intended to extinguish the upper</b> coals, and <b>in order</b> to do that he knew he would <b>ignite the bottom</b> ones. The <i>tanna’im</i> disagree with regard to an undesired act of kindling on Shabbat, which is tantamount to a destructive act. <b>As, the first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that one who produces an undesired or <b>destructive</b> outcome when he performs the labor <b>of kindling</b> is <b>exempt, and Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says</b> he is <b>liable. And similarly, Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> That disagreement was <b>taught with regard to</b> the case of <b>a blacksmith.</b> And <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Until</b> it was taught that the case involves a blacksmith, <b>the reason for this <i>halakha</i> was not revealed.</b>",

            "This is referring to a case <b>where he intended</b> both <b>to extinguish and to kindle.</b> The Torah singles out the labor of kindling on Shabbat, as it is written: “You shall not kindle fire in all your dwelling places on the day of Shabbat” (Exodus 35:3). The Sages disagree with regard to the interpretation of this verse. <b>As the first <i>tanna</i> holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, who says: Kindling was</b> singled <b>out</b> from the general category of prohibited labors in order to teach that it is unlike other labors, teaching <b>that</b> it is a regular <b>prohibition,</b> i.e., it is punishable only with lashes and does not entail <i>karet</i> or stoning for an intentional transgression, or a sin offering for an unwitting transgression. Consequently, he is not liable to bring a sin offering for the kindling.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok, holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan, who says: Kindling was</b> singled <b>out</b> in the Torah <b>to divide</b> the various primary categories of labor and to establish liability for the performance of each of them. According to this opinion, the prescribed punishments for kindling are the same as for the rest of the prohibited labors.",
            "<b>Rava said</b> yet another explanation of the disagreement in the <i>baraita</i>: The difference <b>between them</b> involves a case where one intended to ignite the lower coals and subsequently extinguish the upper coals, and instead he extinguished the upper ones and ignited the lower ones simultaneously. Since he <b>performed</b> the extinguishing <b>first</b> and did not perform it after he ignited as he had intended, the first <i>tanna</i> rules he is liable to bring only one sin offering. By contrast, Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok, maintains there is no exemption for performing the prohibited labors in a different sequence than intended.",
            "<b>Rav Ashi said</b> another explanation: The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where he intended to extinguish</b> a flame <b>and</b> he was not aware that the bottom coals would be kindled.

            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But say</b> that the verse should be interpreted as follows: The phrase <b>“no manner of blood”</b> is <b>a generalization,</b> and the mention of <b>“bird or animal” is a detail.</b> This is <b>a generalization and a detail,</b> and the hermeneutical principle in such cases is that <b>the generalization includes only what</b> is mentioned <b>in the detail.</b> Consequently, with regard to <b>a bird and an animal, yes,</b> it is prohibited to consume their blood, but with regard to <b>anything else,</b> the prohibition does <b>not</b> apply.",
            "The Gemara explains that when the next verse states: <b>“Whoever consumes any blood,</b> that soul shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 7:27), <b>it then generalized</b> again.

            "The Gemara objects: <b>But the last generalization is not similar to the first generalization.

            "The Gemara responds: <b>This <i>tanna</i>,</b> whose opinion is recorded in this <i>baraita</i>, is of <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael,</b> who maintains that <b>we expound generalizations and details</b> even <b>in a case</b> like <b>this, even though the last generalization is not similar to the first generalization.</b>",

            "Before explaining the contradiction between this mishna and the <i>baraita</i> cited above, the Gemara seeks to clarify the mishna itself: <b>And</b> the following was <b>difficult for us: Why do I</b> need <b>intent? Let his</b> act of <b>cutting serve as intent</b> to eat the flesh. <b>And Reish Lakish said:</b> This is referring <b>to one who cuts</b> the flesh in order to feed it <b>to a dog, and intent</b> to feed it <b>to a dog is not</b> considered <b>intent</b> to use the flesh as food.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is intent to feed a dog <b>not</b> considered intent to use the flesh as food? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 8:6): The Sages <b>stated a principle with regard to ritual impurity:</b> With regard to <b>any</b> food <b>that is</b> assumed to be <b>food designated</b> for <b>a person,</b> once it becomes impure with the impurity of food, it remains <b>impure until it is rendered unfit to be consumed by a dog?</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> mishna is referring <b>to removing impurity from it. Since</b> the food <b>was initially fit to</b> be eaten by <b>a person,</b> its status of <b>impurity</b> cannot be <b>removed from</b> it <b>until it is rendered unfit to be consumed by a dog.</b> By contrast, <b>here,</b> with regard to one who cuts flesh, the mishna is referring <b>to granting it</b> susceptibility to <b>impurity.</b> In this case, <b>if</b> it is <b>fit for a person</b> then it is <b>fit for a dog,</b> i.e., it is susceptible to the impurity of food; <b>if</b> it is <b>not fit for a person, it is not fit for a dog,</b> i.e., it is not susceptible to ritual impurity.",
            "The Gemara addresses the contradiction between the mishna in <i>Teharot</i> and the <i>baraita</i> cited above: <b>In any case,</b> that mishna <b>teaches</b> that human flesh requires <b>intent, and intent is for a light</b> form of <b>ritual impurity,</b> i.e., this requirement of intent is necessary only for the flesh to become susceptible to ritual impurity as a food item. This apparently contradicts the claim of the <i>baraita</i> that the impurity of food items does not apply to human flesh. The Gemara answers: <b>This statement</b> of the mishna that human flesh is susceptible to impurity as a food item applies <b>while</b> the person <b>is alive. But after death</b> his corpse <b>is impure</b> by <b>a severe</b> form of <b>impurity</b> and is no longer susceptible to impurity as a food item, and that is the meaning of the <i>baraita</i>.",

But <b>in the corresponding</b> situation <b>with regard to an animal after death, if</b> one is referring to its <b>meat,</b> then it <b>transmits impurity</b> by <b>a severe</b> form of <b>impurity,</b> the impurity of a carcass, <b>and if</b> one is referring to its <b>blood,</b> it likewise <b>transmits impurity</b> by <b>a severe</b> form of <b>ritual impurity,</b> and not a light form of ritual impurity.",

Why, then, does the <i>baraita</i> differentiate between people and animals and indicate that dead animals are susceptible to a light form of ritual impurity?",
            "The Gemara answers: The statement of the <i>baraita</i> that animals are susceptible to a light form of impurity after death while people are not <b>is necessary only for that which we learned</b> in a mishna with regard to the impurity of food (<i>Okatzin</i> 3:3): <b>A carcass of a non-kosher animal,</b> e.g., a horse or donkey, found <b>in any location,</b> and likewise an unslaughtered <b>carcass of a kosher bird</b> found <b>in villages,</b> where there are not many people and it is unlikely to be eaten, <b>require</b> express <b>intent</b> to be eaten in order for them to be considered food and susceptible to impurity of food.

            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that they disagree about this</b> following method of halakhic derivation: <b>That Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that when the Torah connects two topics with the term “and” <b>one learns</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of the <b>earlier</b> passage <b>from</b> those in the <b>later</b> passage.

This is derived from the fact that the Torah states the <i>halakhot</i> of a young bull brought as a burnt offering (Leviticus 1:3–9) and then states: “And if his offering is of the flock, from the sheep or from the goats, as a burnt offering, an unblemished male he shall present it, and he shall slaughter it on the side of the altar northward” (Leviticus 1:10–11).",
            "<b>Rather, here,</b> in the case of one who is uncertain whether he misused consecrated property, <b>this is</b> the <b>reason that the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt</b> from bringing a provisional guilt offering: It is <b>because they derive</b> the details of the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the provisional guilt offering written in the verse: “And if anyone sin, and perform one of all the <b>commandments</b> of the Lord that are not to be performed” (Leviticus 5:17), by means of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the verse stated with regard to <b>a sin offering:</b> “And if any one of the common people sin through error, in his performance of any of the <b>commandments</b> of the Lord that may not be performed” (Leviticus 4:27).",
            "The verbal analogy indicates that <b>just as there,</b> the sin offering is brought only for <b>an act that renders one liable to</b> be punished with <b><i>karet</i> for its intentional</b> violation <b>and</b> liable to bring <b>a sin offering for its unwitting</b> violation, <b>and</b> to bring <b>a provisional guilt offering for its uncertain</b> violation, <b>so too,</b> for <b>every</b> transgression <b>for which one is liable to</b> be punished with <b><i>karet</i> for its intentional</b> violation <b>and</b> one is liable to bring <b>a sin offering for its unwitting</b> violation, one is also liable to bring <b>a provisional guilt offering for its uncertain</b> violation.",

            "<b>And Rabbi Akiva derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> that the provisional <b>guilt offering</b> must be worth at least two <b>silver shekels from</b> the verse: <b>“This is the law of the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:1).

            "<b>And the Rabbis</b> would reply that <b>even though it is written: “This is the law of the guilt offering,”</b> nevertheless it <b>was necessary</b> for the verse <b>to write: “And if anyone</b> sin,” in which the letter <b><i>vav</i> adds to the previous matter and</b> indicates that the <i>halakhot</i> of the <b>later</b> passage <b>are learned from the earlier</b> passage. This teaches that a provisional guilt offering must be worth at least two silver shekels.",
            "<b>And if</b> you would say that this could be derived <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“This is the law of the guilt offering,”</b> that is impossible, as <b>I would say: When I say</b> that there is <b>one law for all of the guilt offerings, that statement</b> applies only <b>to other definite guilt offerings.</b> In other words, just as the guilt offering for definite misuse of consecrated property must be worth at least two silver shekels, the same applies to all definite guilt offerings.",
            "<b>But</b> with regard to the <b>provisional guilt offering, since it comes for an uncertain</b> violation, e.g., in a case where one is uncertain whether he ate forbidden <b>fat,</b> one might <b>say</b> that the offering one brings for <b>its uncertain</b> violation <b>should not be</b> more <b>stringent than</b> the offering one brings for <b>its definite</b> violation: <b>Just as</b> for <b>its definite</b> violation one may bring <b>a sin offering worth</b> even <b>one-sixth [<i>danka</i>]</b> of a dinar, <b>so too,</b> for <b>its uncertain</b> violation one may bring <b>a guilt offering worth</b> even <b>one-sixth</b> of a dinar.

And if</b> the mishna is discussing a case <b>where</b> the animal is <b>alive,</b> the heifer <b>has still not atoned</b> for <b>its uncertainty.</b> Rather, it is clear from the last clause of the mishna that the prohibition takes effect when the heifer’s neck is broken.",
            "The Gemara explains: Although it is evident that the mishna rules that the prohibition takes effect when the heifer’s neck is broken, this matter <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in accordance with the opinion of Rav Hamnuna: It <b>is stated</b> in the Torah that there are offerings that <b>enable</b> one to partake of sacrificial foods, e.g., the guilt offering of a leper, <b>and</b> there are offerings that <b>atone,</b> e.g., a sin offering or guilt offering, all of which are brought <b>inside</b> the Temple. <b>And</b> it <b>is</b> also <b>stated</b> in the Torah that there are offerings that <b>enable</b> one to partake of sacrificial foods, e.g., the birds of a leper’s purification ritual, <b>and</b> offerings that <b>atone,</b> e.g., the heifer whose neck is broken, that are brought <b>outside</b> the Temple.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: Therefore, the offerings brought outside the Temple are compared to those offered inside: <b>Just as</b> with regard to the offerings that <b>enable or atone which are stated</b> in the Torah that are sacrificed <b>inside</b> the Temple, the Torah <b>made</b> the offering that <b>enables like</b> the offering that <b>atones,</b> as even the former has portions of it that are burned on the altar, <b>so too,</b> with regard to offerings that <b>enable or atone which are stated</b> in the Torah that are sacrificed <b>outside</b> the Temple, the Torah <b>made</b> the offering that <b>enables,</b> e.g., the birds of a leper, <b>like</b> the offering that <b>atones,</b> e.g., the heifer whose neck is broken, in that one is prohibited from deriving benefit from either while they are still alive. According to this <i>baraita</i>, the heifer whose neck is broken is prohibited while it is still alive.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: A person may volunteer</b> to bring <b>a provisional guilt offering every day and at any time that he chooses,</b> even if there is no uncertainty as to whether he sinned, and <b>this</b> type of offering <b>was called the guilt offering of the pious,</b> as they brought it due to their constant concern that they might have sinned. <b>They said about Bava ben Buta that he would volunteer</b> to bring <b>a provisional guilt offering every day except for one day after Yom Kippur,</b> when he would not bring the offering.",

            "<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi:</b> According to the opinion of the Rabbis, one can suggest that <b>perhaps a provisional guilt offering is like a burnt offering and a peace offering: Just as a burnt offering and a peace offering</b> sometimes <b>come as obligatory</b> offerings, e.g., the Festival peace offering and the burnt offering of appearance brought on the pilgrimage Festivals, <b>and they</b> sometimes <b>come as gift</b> offerings, likewise, <b>a provisional guilt offering also</b> sometimes <b>comes as an obligatory</b> offering and sometimes <b>comes as a gift</b> offering <b>as well.</b>",
            "Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> Rav Aḥa, son of Rava: <b>A burnt offering and a peace offering are primarily written,</b> i.e., discussed, in the context <b>of a gift</b> offering, and they are brought as obligatory offerings only in specific cases mentioned explicitly in the Torah.

            "<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Dimi: <b>But</b> how can one derive this matter from the verse? <b>When that verse is written, it is written with regard to the goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary on Yom Kippur,<b>which does not atone for a known violation of a mitzva,</b> but only for a violation that is unknown.

            "The Gemara now analyzes the above statement: Those liable to bring provisional guilt offerings are exempt from bringing them after Yom Kippur because Yom Kippur atones for a sin of which only the Omnipresent is aware.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai, who says: A woman who gave birth is a sinner, what is there to say?</b> The Gemara answers: Even according to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, <b>when a woman who gave birth brings an offering,</b> she brings it in order <b>to permit</b> her to <b>eat sacrificial</b> food, which is the final stage in her process of purification; <b>but she does not bring</b> the offering <b>for atonement.</b> Therefore, she must bring her offering after Yom Kippur, as Yom Kippur effects atonement but not purification.",
            "<b>Rav Ashi said</b> that <b>we learn</b> in the mishna (25a) <b>as well: A woman upon whom</b> it is incumbent to bring <b>a bird sin offering</b> due to <b>uncertainty,</b> e.g., uncertainty as to <b>whether</b> her miscarriage obligated her to bring the sin offering of a woman who gave birth, <b>for whom Yom Kippur has passed, is liable to bring</b> it <b>after Yom Kippur.</b> This is <b>because</b> the offering does not come as atonement for a sin.

            "The Gemara objects: <b>If that is so,</b> then <b>an uncertain leper</b> who is obligated to bring an offering for purification <b>for</b> whom <b>Yom Kippur has passed should not bring</b> his offering, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that Yom Kippur has passed for him, as this is</b> a case of <b>a sin of which only the Omnipresent is aware,</b> since God knows if he is impure. <b>Rabbi Oshaya said</b> that the verse states: <b>“For all their sins”</b> (Leviticus 16:21), <b>but not for all their impurity,</b> and this offering is also brought for purification.",
            "The Gemara objects: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> Leprous <b>marks come due to seven matters,</b> i.e., there are seven sins that are the possible causes of leprosy.

Since leprosy develops because of some sin, this means that the leper’s offerings are also brought because of sin.

Consequently, he must bring his offering after Yom Kippur.",
            "The Gemara continues to object: <b>If that is so, an uncertain <i>sota</i>,</b> i.e., a woman suspected by her husband of having been unfaithful who then secludes herself with another man, <b>for whom Yom Kippur has passed,</b> should <b>not bring</b> an offering, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that Yom Kippur has atoned for her, as this is a sin of which only the Omnipresent is aware.

            "<b>Rav Pappa said</b> another answer: <b>The verse states</b> that the priests at the ceremony of the heifer whose neck is broken should recite the following sentence: <b>“Forgive,</b> Lord, <b>Your people Israel,</b> whom You have redeemed” (Deuteronomy 21:8). The verse indicates that <b>this atonement,</b> which is achieved through the heifer whose neck is broken, <b>is</b> also <b>fit to atone</b> retroactively <b>for those who left Egypt,</b> i.e., every case of unknown murder that occurred since the Jews left Egypt.

            "§ The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Now that you said</b> that <b>Yom Kippur atones for a sin of which only the Omnipresent is aware,</b> one can <b>say</b> that <b>when</b> his sin <b>becomes known to him after Yom Kippur as well, he should not bring a sin offering.

Nevertheless, it is correct <b>that Rabbi Shimon holds</b> that consecrated <b>living animals are not</b> permanently <b>disqualified.</b>",
            "<b>And</b> Rabbi Shimon likewise maintains <b>that</b> the <b>drawing</b> of the lots for the two goats on Yom Kippur to decide which goat is designated as a sacrifice and which is designated as the scapegoat, <b>is not indispensable. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one of</b> the goats <b>died</b> following their designation, one <b>brings another</b> goat instead of it, and it is designated <b>without drawing</b> lots. The surviving goat is still used for the purpose for which it was designated by the lot; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon.</b>",
            "<b>Evidently, Rabbi Shimon holds:</b> Consecrated <b>living animals are not</b> permanently <b>disqualified.</b> Although the surviving goat was disqualified when the other goat died, it is once again fit when a new goat is designated as its partner. <b>And</b> Rabbi Shimon also holds that the <b>drawing</b> of the lots <b>is not indispensable,</b> as the new goat was designated without drawing lots.",
            "§ <b>Rav Ḥisda says: Nests,</b> i.e., pairs of birds, <b>are designated,</b>one as a burnt offering and one as a sin offering, <b>only</b> in the following manner: <b>Either</b> by the <b>owner</b> at the time <b>of purchase or,</b> if the owner did not designate the birds at that stage, by the <b>priest</b> at the time <b>of sacrifice.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi said: What is the reason of Rav Ḥisda? As it is written</b> with regard to the offering of a woman after childbirth: <b>“And she shall purchase two doves</b> or two pigeons, one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering” (Leviticus 12:8). And with regard to the offering of a leper it is written: <b>“And the priest shall sacrifice</b> the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering” (Leviticus 15:30). Together, these verses indicate that one bird is designated as a burnt offering and the other as a sin offering <b>either</b> by the <b>owner</b> at the time <b>of purchase or</b> by the <b>priest</b> at the time <b>of sacrifice.</b>",
            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> in the <i>Sifra</i> that discusses the drawing of lots for the two goats of Yom Kippur. The verse states: “Aaron shall bring forward the goat upon which the lot came up for the Lord, <b>and he shall sacrifice it for a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 16:9). This teaches that the drawing of <b>the lot renders it a sin offering, but</b> verbally designating <b>the name</b> of the goat <b>does not render it a sin offering, and</b> likewise the act of the <b>priest,</b> placing the lot on the goat, <b>does not render it a sin offering.</b>",
            "A verse is required to teach this <i>halakha</i>, <b>as</b> one <b>might</b> have come to the opposite conclusion: <b>Could this not</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference,</b> as follows: <b>And if in a case where</b> the drawing of <b>a lot does not sanctify</b> an animal with a specific designation, e.g., a woman after childbirth, who cannot determine by lot the status of the two birds she must bring, one as a sin offering and one as a burnt offering, nevertheless, in such a case a verbal designation of <b>the name does sanctify</b> with a specific designation; <b>is it not logical</b> in <b>a case where</b> the drawing of <b>a lot sanctifies</b> an animal with a specific designation, i.e., the two goats of Yom Kippur, <b>that</b> verbally designating <b>the name</b> should <b>sanctify</b> it with a specific designation?",
            "The <i>baraita</i> concludes: Therefore <b>the verse states,</b> with regard to one of the two goats of Yom Kippur: <b>“He shall sacrifice it for a sin offering,”</b> to teach that the drawing of <b>the lot renders it a sin offering, but</b> verbally designating <b>the name</b> of the goat <b>does not render it a sin offering.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains the objection: The <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that verbally designating the <b>name</b> of an offering <b>is similar to</b> drawing <b>a lot.</b> If so, one can reason as follows: <b>Just as</b> the drawing of <b>a lot</b> is <b>not</b> performed <b>at</b> the time of <b>purchase nor at</b> the time of <b>sacrifice, so too</b> verbal designation of <b>the name also</b> does <b>not</b> have to be performed <b>at</b> the time of <b>purchase nor at</b> the time of <b>sacrifice.</b> This contradicts the opinion of Rav Ḥisda.",
            "<b>Rav said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: And if in a place where</b> the drawing of <b>a lot,</b> either by the <b>owner</b> at the time <b>of purchase or</b> by the <b>priest</b> at the time <b>of sacrifice, does not sanctify</b> an animal with a specific designation, and nevertheless a verbal designation of <b>the name, either</b> by the <b>owner</b> at the time <b>of purchase or</b> by the <b>priest</b> at the time <b>of sacrifice, does sanctify</b> it with a specific designation; <b>here,</b> with regard to the two goats, <b>where</b> the drawing of <b>a lot</b> that does <b>not</b> take place <b>at</b> the time of <b>purchase nor at</b> the time of <b>sacrifice sanctifies</b> the animal with a specific designation, <b>is it not logical that</b> verbally designating <b>the name, either at</b> the time of <b>purchase or at</b> the time of <b>sacrifice,</b> should <b>sanctify</b> it with a specific designation?",
            "Therefore, <b>the verse states: “He shall sacrifice it for a sin offering,”</b> to teach that drawing <b>the lot renders it a sin offering, but</b> verbally designating <b>the name</b> of the goat <b>does not render it a sin offering.</b>",
            "The Gemara <b>raises</b> another <b>objection</b> to the opinion of Rav Ḥisda from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a poor person who defiles the Temple,</b> i.e., he entered the Temple while ritually impure, <b>who designated money for his nest,</b> as he is required to bring one bird as a sin offering and another bird as a burnt offering, <b>and he</b> then <b>became wealthier,</b> he is now obligated to bring a female lamb or goat as a sin offering.",
            "If he was unaware that he is no longer obligated to bring a pair of birds, and he <b>says: This</b> money <b>is for my sin offering and this</b> money <b>is for my burnt offering,</b> which is an error, as he is not obligated to bring a burnt offering, <b>he adds</b> more money <b>and brings his obligation</b> of a lamb or goat for his sin offering <b>from</b> the <b>money</b> designated <b>for his sin offering. But he may not add</b> more money <b>and bring his obligation</b> of a sin offering <b>from</b> the <b>money</b> designated <b>for his burnt offering,</b> as one may not use money that is designated for a burnt offering for the purchase of a sin offering.",
            "The Gemara explains the objection: <b>But here,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is dealing with a case where he said: This money is for my sin offering and that money is for my burnt offering, which means that he designated the money at a stage <b>that was not</b> the time of <b>purchase nor</b> the time of <b>sacrifice; and</b> yet the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that the designation is established and therefore <b>he brings his obligation</b> of a sin offering <b>from</b> the <b>money</b> designated for <b>a sin offering but not from</b> the <b>money</b> designated for <b>a burnt offering.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Sheshet said: And can you understand</b> that <b>this <i>baraita</i> is properly</b> explained, i.e., the <i>baraita</i> as it stands is difficult, <b>as it teaches: He became wealthier</b> and said: This money is for my sin offering and this money is for my burnt offering. <b>But</b> this is difficult, as <b>doesn’t Rabbi Elazar say</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya says: A wealthy person who defiles the Temple,</b> i.e., he entered the Temple while ritually impure,<b>who brought</b> the <b>offering</b> of <b>a poor person</b> to atone for his transgression has <b>not fulfilled</b> his obligation. Since he cannot fulfill his obligation with that offering, how can his designation permanently establish the status of the money?",
            "<b>Rather, what have you to say?</b> You must say that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where he already said:</b> This money is for my sin offering and this money is for my burnt offering, <b>at the time</b> when <b>he was poor. So too,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where he already said</b> it even earlier, <b>at the time</b> when <b>he designated</b> the money, and therefore there is no difficulty for Rav Ḥisda.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But according to Rabbi Ḥagga,</b> who <b>says</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya says</b> that a wealthy person who brings the offering of a poor person has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation, <b>what can be said?</b> According to this opinion, there is no inherent difficulty in the <i>baraita</i> that necessitates Rav Sheshet’s interpretation, and therefore that <i>baraita</i> apparently contradicts Rav Ḥisda’s ruling. The Gemara answers that one should <b>teach</b> the <i>baraita</i> as follows: <b>And after</b> he became wealthier, <b>he purchased</b> animals <b>and said</b> at the time of purchase: This is designated as my sin offering and this as my burnt offering.",
            "With regard to the dispute between Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Ḥagga in the case of a wealthy person who brings the offering of a poor person, the Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A poor leper who brought the offering of a wealthy person</b> has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation. By contrast, <b>a wealthy</b> leper <b>who brought the offering of a poor person</b> has <b>not fulfilled</b> his obligation. This is apparently <b>a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion <b>that Rabbi Ḥagga</b> says that <b>Rabbi Oshaya says.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains that Rabbi Ḥagga could have <b>said to you:</b> The <i>halakha</i> <b>is different with regard to</b> a wealthy <b>leper, as the Merciful One excluded</b> the possibility of a wealthy person bringing the offering of a poor person in the verse: <b>“This</b> shall be the law of the leper” (Leviticus 14:2). The emphasis of “this” teaches that a leper fulfills his obligation only with the appropriate offering.",
            "The Gemara objects: <b>If so,</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived from a verse, then <b>even</b> in the case of <b>a poor leper who brings the offering of a wealthy person as well,</b> he should <b>not fulfill</b> his obligation. The Gemara rejects that suggestion: This is <b>not so,</b> as <b>the verse returned</b> to state: “This shall be <b>the law</b> of the leper,” which includes a leper who brings an inappropriate offering. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the phrase <b>“the law</b> of the leper” serves <b>to include a poor leper who brought the offering of a wealthy person,</b> that he <b>has fulfilled</b> his obligation. One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> in the case of <b>a wealthy</b> leper <b>who brought the offering of a poor person, he</b> has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “This</b> shall be the law.”",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> why not <b>derive</b> a principle <b>from that</b> verse that with regard to any sliding-scale offering, a wealthy person who brings a poor person’s offering has not fulfilled his obligation? The Gemara answers: With regard to a leper <b>the verse states: “And if he is poor and cannot afford”</b> (Leviticus 14:21). The emphasis of “he” teaches that <b>it is</b> only with regard to <b>a leper that a wealthy person who brought a poor person’s offering</b> has <b>not fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>one who defiles the Temple,</b> i.e., he entered the Temple while ritually impure, <b>a wealthy person who brought a poor person’s offering</b> has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Lambs precede goats</b> almost <b>everywhere</b> in the Torah that they are both mentioned, as in the verse: “You shall take it from the lambs or from the goats” (Exodus 12:5).

Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And a pigeon or a dove for a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 12:6), with the usual order reversed, which <b>teaches that both of them are equal.</b>",
            "Likewise, mention of <b>the father precedes</b> that of <b>the mother</b> almost <b>everywhere</b> in the Torah, as in the verse: “Honor your father and your mother” (Exodus 20:12).

But the Sages said:</b> Honor of <b>the father takes precedence over</b> honor of <b>the mother everywhere, due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> both the son <b>and his mother are obligated in the honor of his father.</b>",
            "<b>And likewise with regard to Torah study, if the son was privileged</b> to acquire most of his Torah knowledge from studying <b>before the teacher,</b> honor of <b>the teacher takes precedence over</b> honor of <b>the father, due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> both the son <b>and his father are obligated in the honor of his teacher,</b> as everyone is obligated in the honor of Torah scholars.",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> ultimately <b>happened to</b> Yissakhar from the village of Barkai? <b>Yannai the king, and the queen were sitting</b> and discussing food. <b>The king said</b> that <b>goat</b> meat <b>is better</b> food than lamb meat, <b>and the queen said lamb</b> meat is the <b>better</b> food. <b>They said: Let us ask Yissakhar from the village of Barkai, as he is the High Priest and is very familiar with</b> various <b>dishes.</b>",
            "<b>They asked him,</b> and <b>he said to them: If goat</b> meat <b>were better,</b> it would be <b>sacrificed as the daily offering.</b> The fact that the daily offering is lamb proves that its meat is preferable to that of goat. <b>As he spoke, he signaled</b> contemptuously <b>with his hand.
