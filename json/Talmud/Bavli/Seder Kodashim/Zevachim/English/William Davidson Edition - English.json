            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>All slaughtered offerings that were slaughtered not for their own sake,</b> i.e., during the slaughtering the slaughterer’s intent was to sacrifice a different offering, <b>are fit,</b> and one may continue their sacrificial rites and partake of their meat where that applies. <b>But</b> these offerings <b>did not satisfy the obligation of the owner,</b> who is therefore required to bring another offering. This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to all offerings <b>except for the Paschal offering and the sin offering.</b> In those cases, if the owner sacrificed them not for their own sake, they are unfit. But there is a difference between the two exceptions. <b>The Paschal offering</b> is unfit only when sacrificed not for its sake <b>at its</b> appointed <b>time,</b> on the fourteenth day of Nisan after noon, while <b>the sin offering</b> is unfit <b>any time</b> that it is sacrificed not for its sake.",
            "<b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The guilt offering too</b> is unfit when sacrificed not for its sake. According to his opinion, the correct reading of the mishna is: <b>The Paschal offering</b> is unfit only <b>at its</b> appointed <b>time,</b> while <b>the sin offering and the guilt offering</b> are unfit <b>at all times. Rabbi Eliezer said</b> in explanation: <b>The sin offering is brought for</b> performance of <b>a transgression and the guilt offering is brought for</b> performance of <b>a transgression. Just as a sin offering is unfit</b> when sacrificed <b>not for its sake, so too, the guilt offering is unfit</b> when sacrificed <b>not for its sake.</b>",
            "<b>Yosei ben Ḥoni says:</b> Not only are the Paschal offering and the sin offering unfit when slaughtered not for their sake, but also other offerings <b>that are slaughtered for the sake of a Paschal offering and for the sake of a sin offering are unfit.</b>",
            "<b>Shimon, brother of Azarya, says</b> that this is the distinction: With regard to all offerings, if <b>one slaughtered them for the sake of</b> an offering whose level of sanctity is <b>greater than theirs, they are fit;</b> if one slaughtered them <b>for the sake of</b> an offering whose level of sanctity is <b>less than theirs, they are unfit.</b>",
            "<b>How so? Offerings of the most sacred order,</b> e.g., sin offerings and burnt offerings, <b>that one slaughtered for the sake of offerings of lesser sanctity,</b> e.g., peace offerings, <b>are unfit. Offerings of lesser sanctity that one slaughtered for the sake of offerings of the most sacred order are fit.</b> Likewise, there is a distinction between different offerings of lesser sanctity. <b>The firstborn</b> animal <b>and the</b> animal <b>tithe that one slaughtered for the sake of a peace offering are fit,</b> as the sanctity of peace offerings is greater. <b>Peace offerings that one slaughtered for the sake of a firstborn</b> animal <b>or for the sake of</b> an animal <b>tithe are unfit.</b>",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches: All slaughtered offerings that were slaughtered not for their sake are fit, but they did not satisfy the obligation of the owner. The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the mishna <b>to teach</b> this <i>halakha</i> using the language: <b>But they did not [<i>ella shelo</i>] satisfy</b> the obligation of the owner? <b>Let it teach</b> simply: <b>And they did not [<i>velo</i>] satisfy the obligation of the owner.</b> What does the word: But [<i>ella</i>], add?",
            "The Gemara responds: By adding <b>this</b> word, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that the only deficiency with regard to these offerings <b>is that they did not satisfy the obligation of the owner, but they retain their sanctity, and it is</b> still <b>prohibited to deviate</b> from the protocol <b>of their</b> sacrificial process, i.e., the remaining rites must be performed with proper intent.",
            "<b>And</b> this <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rava, as Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>a burnt offering that one slaughtered not for its sake,</b> it is still <b>prohibited to sprinkle its blood</b> on the altar <b>not for its sake.</b>",
            "The Gemara adds: <b>If you wish, propose a logical argument</b> to support this statement, and <b>if you wish, cite a verse</b> as proof. The Gemara elaborates: <b>If you wish, propose a logical argument:</b> Just <b>because</b> one <b>deviated</b> from protocol <b>in its</b> sacrifice once, i.e., in its slaughter, could it be that <b>he should continue to deviate</b> from protocol <b>in all</b> the rest of the sacrificial rites? One deviation does not justify additional deviations.",
            "And <b>if you wish, cite a verse: “That which has gone out of your lips you shall observe and do; according to what you have vowed [<i>nadarta</i>] freely [<i>nedava</i>] to the Lord your God,</b> even that which you have promised with your mouth” (Deuteronomy 23:24). The Gemara interprets the words <i>nadarta</i> and <i>nedava</i> exegetically: Can <b>this</b> verse be referring to <b>a gift</b> offering [<b><i>nedava</i></b>]?"
        ],
        [
            "<b>It is</b> already referred to as <b>a vow</b> offering <b>[<i>neder</i>]. Rather,</b> the verse indicates that <b>if you did what you vowed</b> to do, i.e., you sacrificed your vow offering properly, <b>it shall be</b> a satisfactory <b>vow</b> offering; <b>and if</b> you did <b>not</b> sacrifice it properly, <b>it shall be</b> rendered a voluntary <b>gift</b> offering unrelated to the vow, and shall not satisfy the obligation of your vow.",
            "The Gemara concludes: <b>And is it permitted to deviate</b> from protocol <b>in</b> the sacrifice of <b>a gift</b> offering <i>ab initio</i>? Clearly it is not. Evidently, even if one of the sacrificial rites was performed for the sake of sacrificing a different offering, it is still prohibited to perform any of the other sacrificial rites in the incorrect manner.",
            "§ <b>Ravina said to Rav Pappa:</b> Since <b>you were not with us last night within the</b> Shabbat <b>limit of Bei Ḥarmakh,</b> you did not hear <b>that Rava raises a contradiction between</b> two <b>superior</b> mishnaic <b>statements and teaches their</b> resolution.",
            "<b>What</b> are these <b>superior statements? We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>All slaughtered offerings that were slaughtered not for their sake</b> are fit, but they did not satisfy the obligation of the owner. Rava infers: <b>The reason</b> they do not satisfy the obligation of the owner is specifically <b>that</b> they were slaughtered <b>not for their sake. But</b> if offerings were slaughtered <b>without specification</b> of intent, <b>they, as well, satisfied the obligation of the owner. Apparently,</b> if one performs any action <b>without specification</b> of intent, it is <b>also considered as</b> if he performed it expressly <b>for its sake.</b>",
            "<b>And</b> Rava <b>raises a contradiction</b> from another mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 24a): <b>Any bill of divorce that was written not for the sake of</b> the <b>woman</b> in question is <b>not valid. And</b> it is derived from the continuation of that mishna that if a bill of divorce was written <b>without specification</b> as to which woman it is referring, it is <b>also not valid.</b>",
            "<b>And</b> Rava <b>resolves</b> the contradiction: <b>Ordinary slaughtered offerings stand</b> designated <b>for their</b> own <b>sake.</b> From the time that the offering is consecrated, its presumed end is that it will be slaughtered for the type of offering for which is was consecrated. Therefore, even if the one slaughtering it has no particular intention, it is in effect considered slaughtered for its own sake. By contrast, <b>an ordinary wife does not stand</b> designated <b>for divorce.</b> Therefore, a bill of divorce is never presumed to be referring to a given woman unless it is specified explicitly.",
            "§ The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive that <b>slaughtered offerings are fit</b> and even satisfy the obligation of the owner if slaughtered <b>without specification? If we say</b> it is <b>from that which we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>All slaughtered offerings that were slaughtered not for their sake</b> are fit, but these offerings did not satisfy the obligation of the owner, <b>and</b> it <b>does not teach</b> this using the language: All slaughtered offerings <b>that were not slaughtered for their sake</b> are fit, but these offerings did not satisfy the obligation of the owner, this cannot be. One cannot infer from this language that slaughter without specification is valid, since the Mishna <b>also teaches with regard to a bill of divorce: Any bill of divorce that was written not for the sake of the woman is not valid, and it does not teach: That was not written for the sake of the woman is not valid,</b> and it is a given that a bill of divorce written without specification is not valid.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> perhaps it is derived <b>from that which we learned</b> in a mishna (13a): <b>How</b> are offerings slaughtered <b>for their sake and</b> then <b>not for their sake?</b> For example, one might slaughter the Paschal offering <b>for the sake of a Paschal offering and</b> then <b>for the sake of a peace offering.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> such an offering is unfit is <b>that he says</b> that he is slaughtering it <b>for the sake of a Paschal offering and</b> then he says that he is slaughtering it <b>for the sake of a peace offering. But</b> if he says that he is slaughtering it <b>for the sake of a Paschal offering, and</b> then slaughters it <b>without specification,</b> it is <b>fit. Apparently,</b> slaughtering an offering <b>without specification is considered as</b> if one slaughtered it <b>for its sake.</b>",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>Perhaps there it is different, as</b> the mishna <b>is saying</b> that <b>anyone who performs</b> an action <b>performs</b> it <b>with</b> his <b>original intent</b> in mind. Therefore, since he specified initially that he was slaughtering the offering for the sake of a Paschal offering, there are no grounds to assume that he then changed his mind. Here, by contrast, he pronounced no initial statement of proper intent.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> perhaps this <i>halakha</i> is derived <b>from the latter clause</b> of that mishna: How are offerings slaughtered <b>not for their sake and</b> then <b>for their sake?</b> For example, one might slaughter the Paschal offering <b>for the sake of a peace offering and</b> then <b>for the sake of a Paschal offering.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> it is unfit <b>is that he says</b> he is slaughtering it <b>for the sake of a peace offering and</b> then he says he is slaughtering it <b>for the sake of a Paschal offering. But</b> if he started slaughtering it <b>without specification and</b> then slaughtered it <b>for the sake of a Paschal offering,</b> it is <b>fit.</b> Apparently, if one slaughters an offering without specification it still satisfies the obligation of the owner.",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>Perhaps there it is different, as</b> the mishna <b>is saying</b> that <b>his ultimate</b> intent <b>proves</b> the nature <b>of his original</b> intent. Since his ultimate intent was to sacrifice a Paschal offering, that was presumably his original intent as well. Here, by contrast, there is no ultimate expression of proper intent.",
            "<b>Alternatively,</b> it can be explained that even if one’s ultimate intent is not considered proof of his original intent, the mishna still uses the same term in both clauses to preserve symmetry. <b>Since</b> in the former clause the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> using the language: <b>For their sake and</b> then <b>not for their sake,</b> teaching that original intent is considered proof of ultimate intent, the <i>tanna</i> <b>also taught</b> the second clause using the language: <b>Not for their sake and</b> then <b>for their sake.</b> In any event, there is no proof from that mishna that an offering slaughtered without specification satisfies its owner’s obligation.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> perhaps this <i>halakha</i> is derived <b>from that</b> mishna (46b), which states: <b>The offering is slaughtered for the sake of six matters: For the sake of</b> the particular <b>offering; for the sake of the one sacrificing</b> the offering, i.e., the owner; <b>for the sake of God; for the sake of</b> consumption by the <b>fires</b> of the altar; <b>for the sake of</b> sacrificing it in a manner that gives <b>an aroma;</b> and <b>for the sake of pleasing</b> God. <b>And the sin offering and a guilt offering</b> are slaughtered <b>for the sake of</b> atonement for the <b>sin.</b>",
            "The mishna on 46b continues: <b>Rabbi Yosei said: Even</b> in the case of <b>one who did not have in mind</b> to slaughter the offering <b>for the sake of</b> any <b>one of these,</b> the offering is <b>fit, since</b> this <b>is a stipulation of the court.</b> The Gemara explains Rabbi Yosei’s opinion: The <b>court stipulated that</b> one <b>should not say</b> that he is slaughtering the offering <b>for its sake, lest he come to say</b> that he is slaughtering it <b>not for its sake.</b> Therefore one should not specify his intent at all.",
            "The Gemara infers: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that if one slaughters an offering <b>without specification</b> it is <b>unfit, would the court arise and stipulate a matter that disqualifies</b> the offering? Clearly, an offering slaughtered without specification is fit and satisfies the obligation of the owner.",
            "§ The Gemara asks: <b>And with regard to a bill of divorce, from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> if it is written <b>without specification</b> as to which woman it is referring, it is <b>not valid?</b>",
            "<b>If we say</b> it is inferred <b>from that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 24a): In the case of a man who <b>was passing through the marketplace, and</b> he <b>heard scribes</b> who write bills of divorce <b>dictating</b> to their students: The <b>man so-and-so divorces so-and-so from</b> the <b>place</b> of <b>such and such, and</b> the man <b>said: This is my name and that is the name of my wife,</b> and he desires to use this bill for his divorce, this bill is <b>unfit to divorce</b> his wife <b>with it,</b> that is not a proof.",
            "It can be explained: <b>Perhaps</b> the mishna is <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation <b>of Rav Pappa. As Rav Pappa says: Here we are dealing with scribes who are wont to practice</b> writing bills of divorce; <b>and</b> this bill of divorce is a draft and <b>was not written for the sake of severance,</b> i.e., divorce, <b>at all.</b> But if a bill of divorce is written to be used for divorce, perhaps it is fit even if written without specifying the woman in question.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> derive this <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the subsequent clause in <b>that</b> mishna:"
        ],
        [
            "<b>Moreover,</b> if a husband <b>wrote</b> a bill of divorce with which <b>to divorce his wife but</b> later <b>reconsidered,</b> and <b>a resident of his town found him and said to him: My name is</b> the same <b>as your name, and my wife’s name is</b> the same <b>as your wife’s name,</b> and we reside in the same town; give me the bill of divorce and I will use it, the bill of divorce is <b>unfit</b> for the second man <b>to divorce</b> his wife <b>with it.</b> Evidently, even if the bill of divorce was written to be used for divorce, if it was not written specifically for the given woman it is not valid.",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>Perhaps there it is different, as</b> the bill of divorce <b>was</b> specifically <b>designated</b> For <b>the sake of that</b> man’s <b>divorce,</b> and therefore it is not valid for the second man’s divorce. But a bill of divorce that was written without specification might be valid if written for the sake of divorce.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> derive it <b>from</b> the subsequent clause in <b>that</b> mishna: <b>Moreover,</b> if <b>he has two wives whose names are identical,</b> and he <b>wrote</b> a bill of divorce <b>to divorce the older</b> one, and then reconsidered, <b>he may not divorce the younger</b> one <b>with it.</b> Evidently, a bill of divorce must be written specifically to divorce a specific wife.",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>Perhaps there it is different, as</b> the bill of divorce <b>was</b> specifically <b>designated for the sake of the divorce of that</b> other wife.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> derive it <b>from</b> the subsequent clause in <b>that</b> mishna: <b>Moreover,</b> if <b>he said to the scribe [<i>lalavlar</i>]: Write</b> a bill of divorce for one of my two wives who have identical names, <b>and I will</b> use it to <b>divorce whichever</b> one of them <b>that I want,</b> this bill of divorce is <b>unfit to divorce</b> either wife <b>with it.</b> Evidently, it must be written for the divorce of a specific woman.",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>Perhaps there it is different, as there is no</b> retroactive <b>designation.</b> The designation of the bill of divorce cannot be determined retroactively. It cannot be used for either wife because it was possibly written for the sake of the other wife. But a bill of divorce written without specification may be valid.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> derive it <b>from that</b> mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 26a): With regard to a scribe <b>who writes the standard</b> part <b>of [<i>tofesei</i>] bills of divorce</b> in advance, so that when one requests a bill of divorce, he will have to add only the details unique to the case, <b>he must leave</b> empty <b>the place</b> of the name <b>of the man, and the place</b> of the name <b>of the woman, and the place</b> of the names <b>of the witnesses, and the place of the date. And</b> in addition, <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> A scribe <b>must also leave the place of</b> the essential phrase: <b>You are hereby permitted to</b> marry <b>any man,</b> since it must be written for the sake of that specific woman. Evidently, a bill of divorce must be written for a specific husband and wife, and if not it is not valid, even if it was written for the sake of divorce.",
            "§ Ravina continued to inform Rav Pappa of Rava’s statements: Rava <b>further raises another contradiction: Did Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Rav says</b> that <b>a sin offering that one slaughtered for the sake of a burnt offering</b> is <b>unfit,</b> whereas if one <b>slaughtered</b> the animal <b>for the sake of</b> consumption of <b>non-sacred</b> meat, it is <b>fit? Apparently,</b> only improper intent that is <b>of its type,</b> i.e., for the sake of another offering, <b>ruins</b> the offering and renders <b>it</b> unfit, whereas wrong intent that is <b>not of its type,</b> i.e., for the sake of consumption of non-sacred meat, is disregarded and <b>does not ruin it.</b>",
            "<b>And</b> Rava <b>raises a contradiction</b> from the aforementioned mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 24a): <b>Any bill of divorce that was written not for the sake of</b> the <b>woman</b> who is being divorced with it <b>is not valid; and</b> by inference, <b>even</b> if it was written <b>for the sake of a gentile woman,</b> it is <b>not valid.</b> With regard to the matter of divorce, a gentile woman is not of the same type as a Jewish woman, as the <i>halakhot</i> of bills of divorce are irrelevant to her.",
            "<b>And</b> Rava <b>resolves</b> the contradiction: If <b>a bill of divorce</b> is written for the sake of a gentile woman it is not valid, because if you <b>remove</b> the intent for the sake of <b>a gentile woman from it, it is</b> considered to be <b>without specification</b> of the woman who is divorced with it, <b>and</b> a bill of divorce written <b>without specification is not valid.</b> But if <b>sacrificial</b> animals are slaughtered for the sake of consumption of non-sacred meat, they remain fit, since if you <b>remove</b> the <b>non-sacred</b> intent <b>from them, they are</b> considered to be <b>without specification, and</b> offerings slaughtered <b>without specification are fit.</b>",
            "§ <b>And</b> Rava <b>raised another contradiction: Did Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Rav says</b> that <b>a sin offering that one slaughtered for the sake of a burnt offering</b> is <b>unfit,</b> whereas if one <b>slaughtered it for the sake of</b> consumption of <b>non-sacred</b> meat it is <b>fit? Apparently,</b> he holds that only improper intent that is <b>of its type ruins it,</b> whereas wrong intent that is <b>not of its type does not ruin it.</b>",
            "<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah states with regard to ritually impure carcasses of creeping animals: “And every earthen vessel into <b>whose interior</b> any of them falls, anything that is in its interior shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:33). From the word “interior” it is derived that only food in its interior is rendered impure, <b>but not</b> any food that is in <b>the interior of its interior,</b> i.e., in another vessel within the earthenware vessel. <b>And</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> not only if the inner vessel is an earthenware vessel; <b>even</b> if it is a metal or wooden <b>vessel,</b> which is purified though <b>rinsing</b> in a ritual bath and is therefore susceptible to impurity from its exterior, it nevertheless <b>protects</b> food that is inside it from being rendered impure. Evidently, even a vessel that is not of the same type serves to nullify the status of the interior of an earthenware vessel.",
            "<b>And</b> Rava <b>resolves</b> the contradiction as follows: A vessel purified through rinsing is actually considered of the same type as an earthenware vessel, since they are both vessels. Concerning the <i>halakhot</i> of impurity, the equivalent of intent with regard to the consumption of non-sacred meat is an item that is not a vessel at all; the Sages <b>rendered non-sacred</b> meat <b>with regard to sacrificial</b> animals <b>like a partition with regard to</b> an earthenware <b>oven: Just as a partition in an oven is not effective at all</b> in preventing the transmission of impurity from one side to the other since it is not a vessel, <b>so too,</b> slaughtering an offering for the consumption of <b>non-sacred</b> meat <b>is not effective at all with regard to</b> rendering <b>sacrificial</b> animals unfit.",
            "This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 8:1): In the case of <b>an oven that</b> one <b>divided with boards or with curtains, and</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal was found in one place, all</b> of the food in the oven, including that on the other side of the partition, is rendered <b>impure.</b>",
            "The mishna continues: In the case of <b>a round barrel that is broken and plugged up with straw and lowered into the airspace of the oven,</b> if the carcass of <b>a creeping animal</b> is <b>inside</b> the barrel, <b>the oven</b> is rendered <b>impure.</b> And if the carcass of <b>a creeping animal</b> is <b>in the oven,</b> the <b>food that is inside</b> the barrel is rendered <b>impure.</b> The broken barrel is not considered a vessel despite its being plugged up with straw, and therefore it does not prevent the transmission of impurity between the creeping animal and the oven. <b>And Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> the food in the barrel <b>pure.</b>",
            "The mishna continues: <b>Rabbi Eliezer said:</b> My opinion can be inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i>: If</b> a barrel or any other partition between some item and a corpse under the same roof <b>protects</b> the item <b>from</b> becoming impure, even though impurity imparted by <b>a corpse</b> is <b>severe</b> in that it lasts seven days, <b>shouldn’t</b> a partition <b>protect</b> food <b>in</b> the airspace of <b>an earthenware vessel</b> from impurity imparted by the carcass of a creeping animal, <b>which is mild</b> by comparison?",
            "The mishna continues: The Rabbis <b>said to him:</b> Your inference is <b>not</b> correct."
        ],
        [
            "<b>If</b> a partition <b>protects</b> an item <b>from</b> impurity imparted by <b>a corpse,</b> which is <b>severe,</b> this is only <b>because</b> such impurity is unique in that it is imparted to that which is in the same tent, i.e., under the same roof, and <b>tents are divided</b> by partitions. If so, <b>should</b> a partition <b>protect</b> food from impurity imparted <b>in an earthenware vessel, which,</b> although <b>mild, is not divided by</b> partitions, like <b>tents</b> are?",
            "The Gemara notes: The comparison between non-sacred meat vis-à-vis offerings and a partition in an earthenware vessel <b>works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold that a partition does not prevent transmission of impurity inside an earthenware vessel. But <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who maintains that a partition is effective in an earthenware oven, <b>what can be said?</b> How is this compatible with the principle that an item is not affected by something not of its type?",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> agrees with this principle. Yet he <b>says</b> that a partition in an earthenware vessel is effective due to his <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, which overrides the principle that an item is not affected by something not of its type.",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>If that is so,</b> that an <i>a fortiori</i> inference overrides this principle, <b>let us say an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>there as well,</b> with regard to a sin offering that was slaughtered for the consumption of non-sacred meat: If slaughtering sacrificial animals for the sake of other <b>sacrificial</b> animals <b>desecrates</b> those <b>sacrificial</b> animals, <b>all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that slaughtering them for the consumption of <b>non-sacred</b> meat desecrates them?",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>Rather, the reasoning</b> behind the statement <b>of Rav</b> that a sin offering slaughtered for the consumption of non-sacred meat is fit is not in accordance with this principle at all, but it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar. As Rabbi Elazar says: What is the reasoning</b> behind the statement <b>of Rav?</b> The verse: <b>“And they shall not desecrate the sacred items of the children of Israel, which they set apart unto the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 22:15), teaches that only improper intentions for the sake of <b>sacred items,</b> i.e., offerings, <b>desecrate sacred items, but non-sacred</b> intent <b>does not desecrate sacred items.</b>",
            "The Gemara notes: <b>Apparently,</b> an inference from <b>a verse</b> can <b>come to rule out</b> a conflicting <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference. If so, <b>here too,</b> with regard to a partition in an oven, <b>let</b> the verse “and every earthen vessel into <b>whose interior</b> any of them falls” <b>come to rule out</b> Rabbi Eliezer’s <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference that a partition prevents food in an oven from becoming impure.",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>This</b> expression: <b>“Whose interior,”</b> does not indicate that a partition is ineffective, as it <b>is necessary to</b> teach another <i>halakha</i>, namely, that <b>food that one kneaded with clay,</b> covering it from all sides, <b>and put in the airspace of an oven</b> that had the carcass of a creeping animal in it is impure. Because it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since</b> the food <b>cannot become impure by touching</b> an impure item, as the clay serves as an interposition, <b>it also cannot become impure</b> by being put <b>in the airspace of</b> an impure oven. The phrase “in whose interior any of them falls” <b>teaches us</b> that the food does contract impurity.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis,</b> who apparently do interpret the verse as teaching that a partition is ineffective in preventing the contracting of impurity in an earthenware vessel, how do they derive that food covered with clay and placed in an impure oven is impure?

            "§ <b>Rav Yosef bar Ami raises a contradiction</b> between Rav’s statement with regard to <b>deviation</b> with regard to the type <b>of offering,</b> i.e., slaughtering for the sake of a different type of offering, <b>and</b> Rav’s statement with regard to <b>deviation</b> with regard to the <b>owner,</b> i.e., slaughtering for the sake of someone other than the offering’s owner, <b>and</b> he then <b>resolves</b> the contradiction.",
            "The contradiction is as follows: <b>Did Rav say</b> that <b>a sin offering that one slaughtered for the sake of</b> another <b>sin offering,</b> i.e., one that the owner is obligated to bring for a different transgression, is <b>fit,</b> but that if one slaughtered it <b>for the sake of a burnt offering</b> it is <b>unfit? Apparently,</b> slaughtering an offering with an improper intention <b>not of its type ruins it;</b> whereas intent that is <b>of its type does not ruin it.</b>",
            "<b>But doesn’t Rav say</b> that <b>a sin offering that one slaughtered for</b> a person who is not its owner but <b>who</b> nevertheless <b>is obligated</b> to bring <b>a sin offering</b> is <b>unfit,</b> whereas if one slaughtered it <b>for</b> a person <b>who is obligated</b> to bring <b>a burnt offering,</b> it is <b>fit? Apparently,</b> an improper intention that is <b>of its type ruins</b> the offering, whereas intent <b>not of its type does not ruin it.</b>",
            "<b>And</b> he <b>resolves</b> the contradiction as follows: <b>There,</b> with regard to deviation from the type of offering, <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“And slaughter it for a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:33). <b>And</b> here <b>a sin offering was slaughtered for the sake of a sin offering,</b> and therefore although it was for the sake of a different sin offering, it remains fit.",
            "<b>Here,</b> concerning deviation with regard to the owner, it <b>is written</b> in the Torah concerning a sin offering: <b>“And he shall be forgiven”</b> (Leviticus 4:26), indicating that specifically <b>he,</b> the owner, <b>but not another</b> person, shall be forgiven. Therefore, if a sin offering is slaughtered for the sake of another person, it is unfit. <b>The other</b> person to whom this is referring is presumably <b>similar to him,</b> the owner of the sin offering, in <b>that he is obligated</b> to make <b>atonement similar to</b> that of the owner. Therefore, if the other person is obligated to bring a burnt offering and not a sin offering, this disqualification does not apply.",
            "§ <b>Rav Ḥaviva raises a contradiction</b> between Rav’s statement concerning <b>deviation</b> with regard to the <b>owner and</b> the aforementioned <i>baraita</i> concerning <b>the interior of its interior,</b> i.e., a vessel placed in an earthenware vessel, <b>and resolves</b> the contradiction.",
            "The contradiction is as follows: <b>But did Rav say</b> that <b>a sin offering that one slaughtered for</b> a person other than its owner but <b>who is</b> also <b>obligated</b> to bring <b>a sin offering</b> is <b>unfit,</b> whereas if one slaughtered it <b>for</b> a person <b>obligated</b> to bring <b>a burnt offering,</b> it is <b>fit?

            "<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that if the carcass of a creeping animal is found inside an earthenware vessel, the vessel’s <b>interior</b> is rendered impure <b>but not the interior of its interior,</b> and <b>even a vessel</b> purified through <b>rinsing,</b> if placed in the earthenware vessel, <b>protects</b> food inside it from contracting impurity? Evidently, impurity in the airspace of an earthenware vessel can be contained by something not of its type.",
            "<b>And</b> Rav Ḥaviva <b>resolves</b> the contradiction as follows: The expression: <b>Whose interior [<i>tokho</i>], is written four</b> times. In other words, in the verse: “And every earthen vessel into whose interior [<i>tokho</i>] any of them falls, anything that is in its interior [<i>tokho</i>] shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:33), the word <i>tokho</i> is mentioned twice, and each time, the verse could have written: The interior. Since the possessive: Its, is added to each instance, the verse is interpreted exegetically as though the word interior [<i>tokh</i>] were mentioned four times: <b>Interior [<i>tokh</i>], whose interior [<i>tokho</i>], interior [<i>tokh</i>],</b> and <b>its interior [<i>tokho</i>].</b>",
            "<b>One</b> of these is necessary <b>to</b> teach the matter <b>itself,</b> that an im-pure earthenware vessel imparts impurity to food in its airspace; <b>and one</b> instance is used <b>for a verbal analogy</b> between the two instances of the word interior, from which it is derived that an earthenware vessel itself contracts impurity from impure items in its airspace.",
            "<b>One</b> indicates that <b>the interior</b> airspace <b>of this,</b> i.e., an earthenware vessel, renders food impure, <b>but not the interior of another</b> type of vessel, which imparts impurity only through contact; and <b>the other</b> instance indicates that <b>its interior, but not the interior of its interior,</b> imparts impurity, <b>and</b> that <b>even a vessel</b> purified through <b>rinsing,</b> if placed in the earthenware vessel, <b>protects</b> food inside it from becoming impure. Consequently, it is derived from a verse that inside an earthenware vessel, other vessels not of its type can block the transmission of impurity. Since this halakha is derived from a verse written in that context, there is no reason to assume that a similar <i>halakha</i> would apply to slaughter."

            "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>There too,</b> with regard to the purification process of a leper, one can explain that the oil atoned for one matter and did not atone for another: It <b>atoned;</b> in other words, the <b>placement</b> of oil on the leper’s right <b>thumb and big toe,</b> which was performed, effected its atonement.

            "The Gemara responds: <b>Are the cases comparable?

            "The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, what is</b> the latter clause concerning a firstborn and animal tithe <b>teaching us,</b> if not that no offerings of lesser sanctity propitiate God when sacrificed for the sake of offerings of greater sanctity?

            "The Gemara raises an objection to this answer: <b>We</b> already <b>learn this as well,</b> in another mishna (89a): The <b>peace offering precedes</b> sacrifice of <b>the firstborn because</b> the peace offering <b>requires placement</b> of its blood twice so as to be visible on <b>four</b> sides of the altar, <b>placing hands</b> on the head of the offering, <b>libations, and waving of</b> the <b>breast and thigh</b> by the priest and the owner, none of which is required for the firstborn.",

Since the verse states: “And <b>she shall be pure,”</b> one learns <b>by inference that she is ritually impure</b> to some extent until she brings her offering, even though she has already immersed. Anyone who has not yet brought an atonement offering is likewise impure to some extent, and rites performed by one who is impure are disqualified (see 17a).",
            "§ The mishna teaches that rites performed by <b>one whose hands and feet are not washed</b> are disqualified.

            "The Gemara responds: <b>No, if the owner became impure due to a corpse,</b> the frontplate <b>indeed</b> effects acceptance for the offering.

The middle thought is disregarded, since it constitutes only half the requisite measure, and the offering is rendered <i>piggul</i>. <b>And Rav Hamnuna says: It constitutes a combination of</b> improper <b>intentions.</b> The middle thought, although itself insufficient to disqualify the offering, is sufficient to interfere with the intention to consume it beyond its time, and the offering is not rendered <i>piggul</i>.",
            "<b>Rava said: From where,</b> i.e., based on what, <b>do I state</b> my ruling? <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 1:5): <b>An egg-bulk of food</b> with <b>first-</b>degree impurity <b>and an egg-bulk of food</b> with second-degree impurity <b>that one mixed together</b> are collectively considered to have <b>first-</b>degree impurity. If one <b>separated them</b> into two portions, each containing a homogenous mixture, <b>this</b> portion is considered to have <b>second-</b>degree impurity <b>and that</b> portion is considered to have <b>second-</b>degree impurity. Since neither of them contains the requisite amount of food with first-degree impurity, each mixture settles to the lower level of impurity between the two foods. Rava reasoned: <b>But</b> if one <b>mixed them again,</b> they revert to <b>be</b> of <b>first-</b>degree impurity.",
            "<b>From where</b> do I know this? <b>From</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause</b> of that mishna <b>teaches:</b> If <b>this</b> portion <b>fell by itself and that</b> portion fell <b>by itself onto a loaf of <i>teruma</i>, it disqualifies it,</b> as would any food with second-degree impurity. But it does not render it impure, since only foods with first-degree impurity impart impurity to other foods. But if <b>they both fell simultaneously</b> onto the loaf, <b>they render it</b> a food with <b>second</b>-degree impurity. Evidently, although the first-degree impurity lay dormant for lack of a requisite measure, it resurfaces when the rest of the measure is added, despite the fact that each portion was previously considered to have second-degree impurity. The <i>halakha</i> would be the same in the case of intent to consume the offering beyond its designated time, i.e., the intent to consume half an olive-bulk outside its area does not interfere with the intent of <i>piggul</i>.",

            "<b>Rav Hamnuna said: From where do I say</b> my opinion? <b>As we learned</b> in another mishna (<i>Me’ila</i> 17b): <b>The food that became ritually impure</b> through contact <b>with a primary source of ritual impurity,</b> thereby assuming first-degree impurity, <b>and</b> the food <b>that became ritually impure</b> through contact <b>with a derivative source of ritual impurity,</b> thereby assuming second-degree impurity, <b>join together</b> to constitute the requisite measure of an egg-bulk <b>to impart impurity in accordance with the</b> more <b>lenient of the two,</b> i.e., as a food of second-degree impurity. <b>What, is it not</b> that they retain second-degree impurity <b>even if one makes up</b> the requisite measure <b>again?</b> If so, it can be inferred that the first-degree impurity is lost, and it does not lie dormant or resurface.

            "<b>The Sages said: Although</b> any <b>other</b> individual who was ritually impure <b>who immersed that day</b> and is waiting for nightfall for the purification process to be completed <b>may not enter</b> the Temple mount until nightfall, <b>this</b> one <b>may enter.</b> The reason is that <b>it is better</b> for <b>a positive mitzva that has</b> a punishment of <b><i>karet</i>,</b> i.e., the bringing of the Paschal offering, to <b>come and override a positive mitzva for which there is no</b> liability to be punished with <b><i>karet</i>,</b> i.e., the mitzva to remove individuals who are ritually impure from the Temple courtyard, than have the positive mitzva that has a punishment of <i>karet</i> not be performed.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: By Torah law, there is not even a positive mitzva</b> that restricts from entering the Temple courtyard one who has immersed that day and will become pure only upon nightfall, <b>as it is stated: “And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judea and Jerusalem, in the House of the Lord, before the new courtyard”</b> (II Chronicles 20:5). <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>“the new courtyard”? Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> This is referring to the place <b>in which they innovated many matters and said</b> that <b>one who immersed that day may not enter the camp of the Levites,</b> which in Jerusalem includes the entire Temple Mount. This indicates that the prohibition is of rabbinic origin, and by Torah law it is permitted for him to enter.",
            "Rav Hoshaya concludes his objection: <b>And if you say</b> that <b>partial entry</b> into the courtyard <b>is considered entry, how</b> does the leper who immersed himself that day <b>insert his hands</b> into the courtyard <b>so that</b> his right <b>thumb and big toe</b> will become purified? In this situation, both <b>this</b> mitzva to eat of the Paschal offering <b>and that</b> mitzva for an impure person to not enter the courtyard <b>are</b> each <b>a positive mitzva for which there is</b> liability to be punished with <b><i>karet</i>,</b> as someone who immersed himself that day who enters the Temple courtyard is liable to be punished with <i>karet</i>.",
            "Ulla <b>said to</b> Rabbi Hoshaya: A proof to my opinion can be brought <b>from your</b> own <b>burden,</b> i.e., from the question you asked. <b>A leper is different,</b> as the Torah permitted him to insert his right thumb and big toe into the courtyard in order to become purified despite the fact that he has not yet brought an atonement offering to complete the purification process, and <b>since he was permitted</b> to partially enter the courtyard <b>for</b> purification from <b>his leprosy, he was</b> also <b>permitted</b> with regard to his impurity due <b>to his seminal emission.</b> Nevertheless, a partial entry into the courtyard is in fact considered an entry.",
            "Based on Ulla’s previous comment, <b>Rav Yosef said: Ulla holds</b> that if <b>most of</b> the Jewish people were <b><i>zavim</i></b> on Passover eve, and were therefore prohibited from sacrificing the Paschal offering while impure, <b>and</b> then <b>they became ritually impure due to a corpse,</b> which allows them to sacrifice the Paschal offering despite their impurity as they are a majority of the Jewish people, <b>since they are permitted</b> to sacrifice the offering <b>with regard to their impurity</b> due to a corpse, <b>they are</b> also <b>permitted with regard to their <i>ziva</i>.</b>",
            "<b>Abaye said to him: Are</b> the cases <b>comparable?</b> With regard to a leper who experienced a seminal emission, he was already permitted to partially enter the courtyard despite his initial impurity. There-fore, the subsequent impurity does not prohibit him from entering. By contrast, the <i>zavim</i> were originally prevented from sacrificing the Paschal offering. Therefore, even if he would be <b>permitted</b> to enter the courtyard despite becoming <b>impure</b> due to a corpse, he would <b>not</b> be <b>permitted</b> to enter due to the <b><i>ziva</i></b> that was previously present.",
            "Furthermore, Abaye <b>said to him: Perhaps this</b> is what <b>the Master is saying:</b> If <b>most of</b> the Jewish people were initially <b>ritually impure due to a corpse, and they</b> subsequently <b>became <i>zavim</i>, since they are permitted with regard to their impurity</b> due to a corpse, <b>they are permitted with regard to their <i>ziva</i></b> as well. Rav Yosef <b>said to him: Yes,</b> that was what I meant.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But still,</b> this is <b>not comparable</b> to the case of Ulla, since with regard to <b>a leper, it is</b> with total <b>permission</b> that he is allowed partial entry into the courtyard. And <b>since it was permitted</b> with regard to one impurity, <b>it was permitted</b> with regard to a second impurity. But the <b>ritual impurity</b> with regard to the sacrificing of the Paschal offering <b>is</b> only <b>overridden,</b> and there is not a total permission. Perhaps <b>with regard to this,</b> i.e., ritual impurity due to a corpse, <b>it is overridden,</b> but <b>with regard to that,</b> i.e., the impurity of <i>ziva</i>, <b>it is not overridden.</b>",
            "<b>Rava said to him: On the contrary, the opposite is</b> more <b>reasonable.</b> With regard to <b>a leper, it is</b> with specific <b>permission</b> that he was allowed by the Torah to insert his right thumb and big toe into the courtyard in order to become purified despite his ritual impurity, which was not granted for other impurities. Therefore, perhaps only <b>with regard to this</b> impurity <b>it is permitted, but with regard to that</b> impurity, i.e., due to a seminal emission, <b>it is not permitted.</b> But with regard to <b>ritual impurity,</b> since <b>it is overridden</b> in the case of ritual impurity due to a corpse, <b>what</b> difference does it make <b>to me</b> if there is <b>one</b> impurity that is <b>overridden,</b> and <b>what</b> difference does it make <b>to me</b> if there are <b>two</b> impurities that are <b>overridden?</b>"

            "<b>Rav Yirmeya of Difti teaches</b> the discussion <b>this</b> way: <b>Abaye asked Rabba:</b> If the blood was collected in more than one cup and the presenting of the blood on the corners of the altar was performed with one <b>cup, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does the cup <b>render</b> the blood of <b>the other</b> cup <b>rejected,</b> and it is therefore poured into the drain running through the Temple courtyard, <b>or</b> does it render it <b>a remainder,</b> which is poured on the base of the altar?",
            "Rabba <b>said to him:</b> This is <b>a dispute between Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, and the Rabbis. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the remainder of the blood of the external sin offering: In the verse <b>above,</b> discussing the sin offering of a <i>Nasi</i>, <b>it states:</b> “And <b>he shall pour its blood</b> out at the base of the altar of the burnt offering” (Leviticus 4:25). In the verse <b>below,</b> discussing the sin offering of an individual, <b>it states: “And he shall pour all its blood</b> out at the base of the altar” (Leviticus 4:30).",
            "The discrepancy between the first verse and the second verse, which contains the additional term “all,” is explained as follows: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to a sin offering which</b> the priest <b>collected its blood in four cups and placed one placement</b> of blood onto the altar <b>from this</b> cup, <b>and one placement</b> of blood <b>from that</b> cup, and likewise for all four corners of the altar, <b>that</b> the remainder of blood from <b>all</b> the cups <b>are poured</b> out <b>onto the base</b> of the altar? <b>The verse states: “And he shall pour all its blood.”</b>",
            "One <b>might</b> have thought that if <b>he placed four placements</b> of blood of the sin offering <b>from one cup,</b> the blood in <b>all</b> the rest of the cups <b>should be poured onto the base</b> of the altar. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And</b> he shall pour <b>its blood,”</b> and not all of its blood. <b>How so?</b> Only <b>that</b> blood in the cup from which blood was properly presented on the altar <b>is poured onto the base</b> of the altar, <b>and</b> the rest of the cups of blood are rejected and <b>are poured into the</b> Temple courtyard <b>drain.</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to a sin offering which</b> the priest <b>collected its blood in four cups and</b> then <b>placed four placements from one cup, that</b> the blood from <b>all</b> the cups <b>are poured</b> out <b>onto the base</b> of the altar? <b>The verse states: “And he shall pour all its blood.”</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “And he shall pour its blood,”</b> which indicates that not all of the blood is poured? <b>Rav Ashi said: That</b> verse serves <b>to exclude</b> the <b>remainder that is in the throat of</b> the <b>animal</b> that was never collected in a vessel to be presented, which is not poured onto the base of the altar but into the Temple courtyard drain.",
            "§ The mishna discussed three similar cases: If <b>the</b> priest <b>fit</b> for Temple service <b>collected</b> the blood in a vessel <b>and gave</b> the vessel <b>to an unfit</b> person, that person should return it to the fit priest. If the priest collected the blood in a vessel in his right hand and moved it to his left hand, he should return it to his right hand. If the priest collected the blood in a sacred vessel and placed it in a non-sacred vessel, he should return the blood to a sacred vessel.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> it was <b>necessary</b> to mention all of these cases, <b>as had</b> the mishna <b>taught us</b> only the case where he gave the blood to <b>an unfit</b> individual, <b>I would say: What</b> does the term: <b>Unfit,</b> mean? It means <b>an impure</b> priest, who is not completely unfit, <b>as</b> he <b>is fit for communal service</b> in the Temple when the priests or the entire community are impure, and that is why the blood is not disqualified; <b>but</b> if the priest moved the blood to his <b>left</b> hand, which under no circumstances may be used to perform the rite of collecting and carrying the blood, it is <b>no</b> longer valid.",
            "<b>And had</b> the mishna <b>taught us</b> only with regard to moving the blood to his <b>left</b> hand that he should return it to his right hand and present it, one would assume that the reason is <b>that</b> the left hand <b>has validity on Yom Kippur,</b> since the High Priest carries the spoon of incense with his left hand, <b>but</b> if he poured the blood into <b>a non-sacred vessel</b> then it is <b>not</b> valid.",
            "<b>And had</b> the mishna <b>taught us</b> only with regard to <b>a non-sacred vessel</b> that the blood is not disqualified, one could suggest that perhaps it is <b>because</b> the vessels <b>are suitable to be consecrated, but</b> with regard to <b>these,</b> i.e., an unfit individual and the left hand, which have no possibility of becoming fit for service, <b>say</b> that the blood does <b>not</b> remain valid. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> for all of the cases to be mentioned.",
            "§ The Gemara questions the actual <i>halakha</i>: <b>But let</b> the blood <b>be</b> considered <b>rejected</b> when placed in the hand of the unfit individual, the left hand, or the non-sacred vessel. <b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: This is</b> what <b>Rav Yirmeya of Difti says in the name of Rava:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Ḥanan the Egyptian, who does not</b> subscribe to the <i>halakha</i> of <b>rejection,</b> but holds that a sacrifice that was rejected temporarily is not rejected entirely.",
            "This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Ḥanan the Egyptian says:</b> In the event that the scapegoat of Yom Kippur was lost, <b>even</b> if the <b>blood</b> of its partner that is sacrificed to God has already been collected <b>in the cup,</b> the blood is not rejected, but rather <b>he brings</b> another scapegoat as <b>its counterpart, and pairs it with</b> the goat that has already been slaughtered, and the blood is sprinkled.",
            "<b>Rav Ashi says</b> that there is another explanation to the mishna: <b>Anything that is in his power</b> to rectify <b>is not</b> considered <b>rejected,</b> as in these cases where he can simply return the blood to its proper place.",
            "<b>Rav Shaya said:</b> It <b>is reasonable</b> to explain the mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Ashi,</b> as <b>whom have you heard who accepts</b> the reasoning of <b>rejection?</b> It is <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Yoma</i> 62a): <b>And furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> If <b>the blood</b> of the goat sacrificed to God <b>spilled</b> from the cup before it was sprinkled, <b>the scapegoat</b> is left to <b>die.</b> Similarly, if <b>the scapegoat died, the blood</b> of the goat sacrificed to God <b>should be spilled,</b> and two other goats are used. Consequently, Rabbi Yehuda holds that the scapegoat, or in the opposite case, the blood of the goat to be sacrificed to God, is totally rejected.",
            "<b>And</b> yet, <b>we have heard that</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>says: Anything that is in his power</b> to rectify <b>is not rejected.

            "§ The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> A priest <b>would fill one cup with the mixed blood,</b> so <b>that if one of</b> the cups with the collected blood of one of the Paschal offerings <b>were to spill,</b> it would be <b>found that this</b> cup of the mixed blood that was sprinkled <b>would render</b> the sacrifice <b>valid.</b> The Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Yehuda: But</b> the mixed blood <b>was not collected in a vessel.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do</b> the Rabbis <b>know</b> that the blood was not collected in a vessel?

            "This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Blood of exudate</b> is <b>subject to a prohibition,</b> and one who consumes it receives lashes.

            "The Gemara challenges this answer: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Elazar say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda concedes with regard to atonement that</b> presenting blood of exudate <b>does not effect atonement, as it is stated:</b> “For the soul of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls; <b>for it is the blood</b> that makes atonement by reason <b>of the soul”</b> (Leviticus 17:11).",
            "This verse indicates that <b>blood with which the soul leaves</b> the animal, i.e., that spurts immediately upon slaughter, <b>is called blood;</b> but blood <b>with which the soul does not leave</b> the animal, i.e., blood of exudate, <b>is not called blood.</b> If so, even according to Rabbi Yehuda, blood of exudate is unfit for presenting upon the altar, and collecting blood from the floor should therefore be ineffective.",
            "<b>Rather, Rabbi Yehuda</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as he says: Blood does not nullify blood.</b> Therefore, the blood in the cup that is fit for sprinkling on the altar is not nullified by the blood of exudate, and the entire mixture may be sprinkled on the altar.",
            "The Gemara cites the continuation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda said to</b> the Rabbis: <b>According to your statement</b> that the mixed blood on the floor may not be used, <b>why do they plug</b> the drain of <b>the</b> Temple <b>courtyard</b> on Passover eve and not allow the blood to flow out through it?

            "The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> the <b>blood is an interposition</b> between the feet of the priests and the floor of the Temple, and this should invalidate the service.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>Still,</b> does <b>this</b> verse, Deuteronomy 12:27, <b>come to</b> teach <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i>, that if a priest placed the blood with one placement he facilitated atonement?

            "The Gemara answers that the <i>tanna</i> of the earlier <i>baraita</i>, who derives from Deuteronomy 12:27 the <i>halakha</i> that if a priest placed the blood with one placement he facilitated atonement, <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili.</b> Rabbi Yosei HaGelili maintains that the <i>halakha</i> that the blood and sacrificial parts of an animal tithe offering and a Paschal offering must be placed on the altar is derived from the aforementioned verse concerning a firstborn animal: “You shall sprinkle their blood upon the altar and shall burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for an aroma pleasing to the Lord” (Numbers 18:17).",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But does Rabbi Yishmael derive</b> one <i>halakha</i> <b>from this verse and</b> then <b>derive</b> another <i>halakha</i> <b>from this</b> same verse? It was stated earlier that Rabbi Yishmael derives from the verse “And the blood of your offerings shall be poured” that sprinkling is included in pouring, and yet here he derives from that same verse that the blood of an animal tithe offering and that of a Paschal offering must be presented on the altar. The Gemara answers: These are the opinions of <b>two <i>tanna’im</i>,</b> each of whom expressed his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yishmael.</b>",
            "The Gemara raises a question with regard to the disagreement about the interpretation of Numbers 18:17. <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, who interprets the entire</b> verse as referring <b>to a firstborn</b> animal, and according to whom the plural form in the verse is referring to three such firstborns, that of a bull, that of a sheep, and that of a goat, <b>this</b> explains that <b>which is written</b> immediately afterward: <b>“And their meat shall be yours”</b> (Numbers 18:18), in the plural, i.e., the meat of these firstborn animals shall be eaten by the priests.",

If so, <b>what</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“and their meat shall be yours”?</b> The Gemara answers that the plural term “their meat,” is referring not to an animal tithe offering or a Paschal offering, but to different types of firstborns, i.e., <b>both an unblemished</b> animal, whose blood is poured on the altar, <b>and a blemished</b> one, which is not brought as an offering on the altar."

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> who interprets this verse differently, from where does he derive this <i>halakha</i> that a blemished firstborn is given to a priest? The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> the phrase: “As the breast of waving and as the right thigh, <b>it shall be yours”</b> (Numbers 18:18), <b>which is the latter clause</b> of that same verse. The repetition of the phrase “shall be yours” serves to teach that even the meat of a blemished firstborn shall be eaten by the priests.",

The word “they” indicates that only <b>they are sacrificed</b> on the altar, <b>but their substitutes are not sacrificed.</b> In general, if one substitutes a non-sacred animal for one designated as an offering, both the original and the substitute are considered to be consecrated, and they are therefore sacrificed. But if one substitutes a non-sacred animal for a firstborn, an animal tithe offering, or a Paschal offering, the substitute is not sacrificed.",
            "This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Temura</i> 21a): With regard to <b>the substitute of a firstborn and</b> of an animal <b>tithe</b> offering, both <b>they,</b> the substitutes themselves, <b>and their offspring, and the offspring of their offspring, forever,</b> i.e., for all future generations, <b>are as</b> the <b>firstborn and</b> the animal <b>tithe</b> offering, respectively, <b>and</b> therefore <b>they are eaten in their blemished</b> state <b>by the owners;</b> but unlike the firstborn and the animal tithe offering themselves, they are not sacrificed on the altar.",

And as will be explained, if the substitution took place after the sacrifice of the Paschal offering, the animal is sacrificed, as it is considered the substitute of a peace offering, whereas if the substitution occurred before the sacrifice of the Paschal offering, it is not sacrificed, as it is the substitute of a Paschal offering. This indicates that the substitute of a Paschal offering is not sacrificed, just like the substitute of a firstborn is not sacrificed.",
            "<b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, who interprets the entire</b> verse as dealing <b>with a firstborn, from where does he</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> <b>that the substitute of</b> an animal <b>tithe</b> offering <b>and</b> of <b>a Paschal offering are not sacrificed?</b> The Gemara answers: With regard to an animal <b>tithe</b> offering, <b>he derives</b> this by means of a verbal analogy between the terms <b>passing,</b> and <b>passing</b> written <b>with regard to a firstborn.</b> Concerning a firstborn it is stated: “And you shall pass [<i>veha’avarta</i>] to the Lord all that opens the womb” (Exodus 13:12), and concerning an animal tithe it is stated: “Of whatever passes [<i>ya’avor</i>] under the rod” (Leviticus 27:32). From this verbal analogy it may be derived that just as the substitute of a firstborn is not sacrificed, so too, the substitute of an animal tithe offering is not sacrificed.",
            "With regard to the <b>Paschal offering,</b> this <i>halakha</i> is not derived through a verbal analogy, but rather this <i>halakha</i> <b>is explicitly written concerning it.</b> The verse referring to peace offerings states: “If he offers a lamb for his offering” (Leviticus 3:7). The Torah could simply have stated: <b>A lamb,</b> and proceed from there to teach the <i>halakhot</i> of a lamb peace offering. If so, <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “If</b> he offers <b>a lamb”?</b> This serves <b>to include the substitute of a Paschal offering</b> that was substituted <b>after</b> the sacrifice of <b>the Paschal offering,</b> teaching <b>that it is sacrificed as a peace offering,</b> since the Paschal offering has the status of a peace offering after that time. One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even before</b> the sacrifice of <b>the Paschal offering the same</b> should apply, i.e., that the substitute of a Paschal offering is sacrificed as a peace offering. Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the Paschal offering: “It is the sacrifice of the Lord’s Passover” (Exodus 12:27), which indicates that <b>it,</b> the Paschal offering itself, is sacrificed, but its substitute is not sacrificed.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>all those <i>tanna’im</i> who derive a different exposition from this</b> verse: <b>“And the blood of your offerings shall be poured”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:27), <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> that is recorded in the mishna, that with regard to <b>all</b> the offerings <b>whose</b> blood is to be <b>placed on the external altar,</b> in a case <b>where</b> the priest <b>placed</b> the blood on the altar with <b>one placement, he facilitated atonement, from where do they</b> derive this?

            "§ The mishna teaches that Beit Shammai maintain that in the case of <b>a sin offering,</b> which requires four placements, at least <b>two placements</b> are necessary to facilitate atonement, whereas Beit Hillel hold that even in the case of a sin offering one placement suffices. <b>Rav Huna said: What is the reasoning</b> for the opinion <b>of Beit Shammai?</b>",
            "He explains: The verse states: “And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the <b>corners</b> of the altar” (Leviticus 4:25). Subsequently, the verse states: “The priest shall take of its blood with his finger, and put it on the <b>corners</b> of the altar” (Leviticus 4:30), and an additional verse states: “The priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it on the <b>corners</b> of the altar” (Leviticus 4:34). As the mini-mum amount justifying the use of the plural form, i.e., in the word “corners,” is two, one may conclude that <b>there are six</b> references to the corners of the altar <b>here. Four</b> of them are mentioned <b>for a mitzva,</b> meaning that the priest should place the blood on all four corners of the altar <i>ab initio</i>, <b>and</b> the other <b>two</b> are mentioned <b>to invalidate</b> the offering if he did not present the blood on at least two corners.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what is the reasononing for the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel?</b> The Gemara answers: The matter should be understood according to the written consonantal text, i.e., the way in which the words are actually spelled. The word <b>“corners”</b> is written plene, i.e., with a <i>vav</i>, in one of the verses, which means that it must be read in the plural form. In the other two verses, <b>“corners”</b> and <b>“corners”</b> are written deficient, i.e., without a <i>vav</i>, in a way that can be vocalized in the singular form, i.e., as <i>karnat</i>. Therefore, <b>there are four</b> references to corners <b>here. Three</b> of these references are written <b>to</b> indicate the placements of blood are performed only as <b>a mitzva,</b> i.e., they are performed <i>ab initio</i>, and the remaining <b>one</b> is written <b>to</b> indicate that its absence <b>invalidates</b> the offering, i.e., the offering is not valid if the blood was not placed against at least one corner of the altar.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to this explanation of Beit Hillel, why not <b>say</b> that <b>all of them are</b> written <b>for</b> the <b>mitzva</b> and none are to invalidate, i.e., that the blood must be presented on all four corners <i>ab initio</i>, but the offering atones after the fact even if the blood was not presented at all? The Gemara rejects this possibility: <b>We have not found</b> anywhere in the Torah an example of an offering in which <b>atonement</b> can be achieved <b>with no</b> placement of the blood.",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>this is the reason of Beit Hillel: The vocalized text</b> of the Torah, i.e., the way in which the words of the Torah are pronounced based on the tradition of what vowels the words contain, <b>is effective</b> in determining how the verses are to be expounded. <b>And</b> likewise, <b>the consonantal text</b> of the Torah, i.e., the way in which the words are actually written, <b>is</b> also <b>effective</b> in determining how the verses are to be expounded. The Gemara elaborates: <b>The vocalized text is effective in adding one</b> more corner <b>and the consonantal text is effective in subtracting one</b> corner. Consequently, the verse is interpreted as referring to five corners, four of which are necessary for the mitzva <i>ab initio</i>, and one of which is indispensable after the fact.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But if that is so,</b> that this is the proper manner of expounding the verses, consider the case of the phylacteries of the head, about which it is stated: “And <b>for frontlets [<i>totafot</i>]</b> between your eyes” (Exodus 13:16), and: “They shall be <b>for frontlets [<i>totafot</i>]</b> between your eyes” (Deuteronomy 6:8), and subsequently: “They shall be <b>for frontlets [<i>totafot</i>]</b> between your eyes” (Deuteronomy 11:18). The word <i>totafot</i> is written once in plene form, i.e., with a <i>vav</i>, indicating the plural form, and twice in a deficient form, i.e., without a <i>vav</i>, indicating the singular. Accordingly, <b>there are four</b> frontlets <b>here,</b> and from here the Sages derive that the phylacteries of the head consist of four compartments, which together form a cube. Why not say that <b>the vocalized text,</b> read in the plural, <b>is effective,</b> i.e., that it requires six compartments, <b>and</b> likewise, <b>the consonantal text,</b> read in the singular, <b>is effective,</b> i.e., it requires four compartments, and therefore one should be <b>required to prepare five compartments</b> for the phylacteries of the head?",
            "The Gemara answers that Beit Hillel <b>hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says</b> that the requirement to have four compartments in the phylacteries of the head is not derived from the number of times that the word <i>totafot</i> is mentioned, but rather from an exposition of the word <i>totafot</i> itself: <b><i>Tot</i> in</b> the <b>Katpi</b> language means <b>two,</b> and <b><i>pat</i> in</b> the <b>Afriki</b> language means <b>two,</b> for a total of four.",
            "The Gemara raises another objection to this method of exposition: <b>If that is so,</b> consider the case of a <i>sukka</i>, about which it is stated: <b>“In <i>sukkot</i> [<i>basukkot</i>]</b> shall you reside seven days; all that are homeborn in Israel shall reside <b>in <i>sukkot</i> [<i>basukkot</i>].</b> So that your future generations will know that I caused the children of Israel to reside <b>in <i>sukkot</i> [<i>basukkot</i>]</b> when I took them out of the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God” (Leviticus 23:42–43). Two instances of the word <i>basukkot</i> are written in a deficient manner, i.e., without a <i>vav</i>, indicating the singular, and one instance is written in plene form, i.e., with a <i>vav</i>, indicating the plural form. The Sages derived from here that a <i>sukka</i> must have four walls. Why not say that <b>the vocalized text,</b> read in the plural, <b>is effective,</b> requiring six walls, <b>and</b> likewise, <b>the consonantal text,</b> read in the singular, <b>is effective,</b> requiring four walls, and therefore one should be <b>required to build</b> a <i>sukka</i> with <b>five walls?</b>"
        ],
        [
            "The Gemara answers: <b>There, one</b> of the five indicated by the <b>verse is</b> needed <b>entirely for</b> the mitzva <b>itself,</b> i.e., to teach the basic <i>halakha</i> that one must dwell in a <i>sukka</i>. <b>And</b> another <b>one</b> of the five is needed <b>to</b> teach that a <i>sukka</i>, as is indicated by its name, must have <b>a covering [<i>sekhakha</i>].</b> Accordingly, there are three left, alluding to the requirement that a <i>sukka</i> must have three walls. The Gemara adds that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai <b>comes and reduces the</b> size of the <b>third</b> wall, teaching that it need not be complete, <b>and sets</b> its minimum length <b>at</b> only <b>one handbreadth.</b>",
            "The Gemara raises yet another objection: <b>If that is so,</b> that both the vocalized and the consonantal texts are taken into account, consider the case of a woman who gives birth to a female child. Concerning this woman the verse states: “But if she bear a female child, <b>then she shall be impure two weeks [<i>shevu’ayim</i>],</b> as in her menstruation” (Leviticus 12:5). The way that the word is written allows it to be read as <b><i>shivim</i>,</b> seventy. Why not say that <b>the vocalized text</b> of the Torah <b>is effective,</b> teaching us that the woman is ritually impure for fourteen days, <b>and the consonantal text is</b> also <b>effective,</b> teaching us that she is impure for seventy days, and, therefore, <b>she</b> should be <b>required to sit</b> in a state of ritual impurity for <b>forty-two</b> days, which is the halfway point between fourteen and seventy days?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>There it is different,</b> and the consonantal text is disregarded entirely, <b>as it is written: “As in her menstruation,”</b> and a menstruating woman is impure for one week. Evidently, the verse is speaking in terms of weeks, and is not alluding to the number seventy at all.",
            "§ The Gemara further analyzes the opinion of Beit Hillel that even in the case of a sin offering, if the priest placed the blood on the altar with one placement, he facilitated atonement. <b>And a <i>tanna</i> cites</b> proof <b>for this from here,</b> as it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the sin offering brought by a king: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall make atonement</b> for him” (Leviticus 4:26), and with regard to the goat brought as a sin offering by an ordinary person: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall make atonement</b> for him” (Leviticus 4:31), and with regard to the sheep brought as a sin offering by an ordinary person: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall make atonement</b> for him” (Leviticus 4:35). The repetition of this term is <b>due to a logical inference.</b>",
            "<b>As</b> one <b>might</b> have thought to say: <b>Could this not</b> be derived through <b>logical inference</b> as follows: It <b>is stated</b> that <b>blood</b> is placed <b>below</b> the red line, <b>and</b> it <b>is stated</b> that <b>blood</b> is placed <b>above</b> the red line. <b>Just as</b> with regard to the <b>blood concerning</b> which it <b>is stated</b> that it is placed <b>below</b> the red line, <b>when</b> the priest <b>placed</b> it on the altar <b>with one placement he facilitated atonement, so too,</b> with regard to the <b>blood concerning</b> which it <b>is stated</b> that it is placed <b>above</b> the red line, <b>when</b> the priest <b>placed</b> it on the altar <b>with one placement he facilitated atonement.</b>",
            "<b>Or</b> perhaps, <b>go this way,</b> turning away from the previous explanation and toward this explanation: It <b>is stated</b> that <b>blood</b> is presented <b>on</b> the <b>inner</b> altar, i.e., with regard to a sin offering of the community or of the High Priest; the blood of these offerings is sprinkled on the incense altar that is inside the Sanctuary. <b>And</b> it <b>is stated</b> that <b>blood</b> is presented <b>on</b> the <b>external</b> altar, i.e., with regard to the sin offering of an ordinary person, which is offered on the outer altar that is in the courtyard. <b>Just as</b> with regard to the <b>blood concerning</b> which it <b>is stated</b> that it is presented <b>on</b> the <b>inner</b> altar, if the priest <b>omitted one of the placements he has done nothing,</b> i.e., the offering is not valid, <b>so too,</b> with regard to the <b>blood concerning</b> which it <b>is stated</b> that it is presented <b>on</b> the <b>external</b> altar, if the priest <b>omitted one of the placements he has done nothing.</b>",
            "The Gemara analyzes the two possibilities: <b>Let us see to which</b> of the two cases the blood of an animal sin offering is more <b>similar.</b> It can be claimed: We <b>derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to the <b>external</b> altar <b>from</b> a <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to the <b>external</b> altar, <b>but</b> we <b>do not derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to the <b>external</b> altar <b>from</b> a <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to the <b>inner</b> altar. <b>Or, go this way: We derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to <b>a sin offering</b> whose blood is to be placed on the <b>four corners</b> of the altar <b>from</b> a <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to <b>a sin offering</b> whose blood is to be placed on the <b>four corners</b> of the altar. <b>But</b> a sin offering consisting of a bird, <b>which is not a sin offering</b> whose blood is to be placed on the <b>four corners</b> of the altar, <b>cannot serve as proof</b> to the <i>halakha</i> concerning an animal sin offering, whose blood is to be placed on the four corners of the altar.",
            "Since both of the above inferences are reasonable, neither can serve as the source of the <i>halakha</i>. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And</b> the priest <b>shall make atonement,” “And</b> the priest <b>shall make atonement,” “And</b> the priest <b>shall make atonement,”</b> for a total of three times. The verses are interpreted as follows: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall make atonement,” even if he placed only three</b> placements. Subsequently: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall make atonement,” even if he placed only two</b> placements, and then: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall make atonement,” even if he placed only one</b> placement. This interpretation is the source of Beit Hillel’s opinion.",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> each of these verses <b>is necessary for itself,</b> to teach that atonement is achieved for each of the sins through its respective sin offering. <b>Rava said: Bar Adda Mari explained</b> this matter <b>to me: The verse states</b> with regard to each of these sin offerings: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall make atonement…and he shall be forgiven”</b> (Leviticus 4:26, 31, 35). <b>This is atonement</b> and <b>this is forgiveness;</b> they are one and the same. Since it would have sufficed to say: “And he shall be forgiven,” the superfluous mentions of the phrase: “And the priest shall make atonement,” serve to teach that the priest facilitates atonement even if he has not performed all the placements.",
            "The Gemara asks: But even if these phrases are superfluous, do they necessarily indicate that a priest who omitted placements has nevertheless facilitated atonement? Why not <b>say</b> that these phrases serve to teach that if the priest placed all the placements he facilitated atonement even if the placements were placed in the wrong place? And expound the verses as follows: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall make atonement,” even if he placed</b> the blood on the altar with <b>only three</b> placements <b>above,</b> on the corners of the altar, <b>and one below,</b> on the lower portion of the altar; <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall make atonement,” even if he placed</b> the blood with <b>only two</b> placements <b>above and two below; “And</b> the priest <b>shall make atonement,” even if he did not place</b> the blood <b>above</b> at all, <b>but</b> only <b>below.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Adda bar Yitzḥak says: If so,</b> that the priest facilitates atonement even if he placed all the placements below, <b>you have abolished the requirement of four corners</b> that is stated with regard to the sin offering (see, e.g., Leviticus 4:34), as the four corners are on the upper portion of the altar. The Gemara is puzzled by Rav Adda bar Yitzḥak’s claim: <b>But if the Merciful One states</b> that this is so, <b>let</b> this requirement <b>be abolished.</b>",
            "As Rav Adda bar Yitzḥak’s claim was rejected, <b>Rava said</b> there is a different reason why the previous claim cannot be accepted: <b>What is</b> the <b>item that requires three</b> repetitions of “and the priest shall make atonement,” i.e., to what are these verses referring? <b>You must say</b> that <b>these are</b> the <b>corners</b> of the altar. The Torah must teach that the priest facilitates atonement even if he did not place the blood on three of the four corners. But in order for the verses to teach that all four placements can be placed below, the phrase “and the priest shall make atonement” would have to be written four times.",
            "The Gemara asks further: Even so, it is possible to interpret the three repetitions of the phrase “and the priest shall make atonement” as referring to the location of the placements, without abolishing the requirement of corners, as one can <b>say:</b> “And the priest shall make atonement,” even though he placed the blood on the altar with only three placements above and one below; “And the priest shall make atonement,” even though he placed the blood with only two placements above and two below; <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall make atonement,” even though he placed</b> the blood with <b>only one</b> placement <b>above and three below.</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: This entire line of inquiry can be rejected, as <b>we do not find</b> a case involving <b>blood, half of which</b> is placed <b>above</b> the red line <b>and half of which</b> is placed <b>below</b> it. One either places all the blood on the lower half of the altar, as in the case of most offerings, or all of it on the upper half of the altar, as in the case of sin offerings. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is there really <b>no</b> case of that sort? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Yoma</i> 53b): The High Priest took the blood of the bull into the Holy of Holies and <b>sprinkled from</b> the blood <b>one</b> time <b>upward and</b> then <b>seven</b> times <b>downward?</b> Apparently, part of the blood of an offering can be sprinkled upward, toward the upper part of the Ark Cover, and part can be placed downward, toward the lower part of the Ark Cover.",
            "The Gemara rejects this: That is not a case where half the blood is sprinkled upward and half is sprinkled downward.

            "The Gemara asks again: Is there not a case where some of the blood is presented above the red line and some of it is presented below? <b>But there is</b> the <b>remainder</b> of the blood, which is poured on the base of the altar even in the case of a sin offering, the main blood of which is placed on the upper portion of the altar. The Gemara answers: The pouring of the <b>remainder</b> of the blood on the base of the altar <b>is not indispensable</b> for atonement. Blood that is indispensable for atonement is in no instance presented half above the red line and half below it.",

Beit Hillel disagree and say that even in the case of a sin offering one placement suffices after the fact. With regard to this issue, it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: Beit Shammai say</b> that <b>two placements in</b> the case of <b>a sin offering, and one</b> placement <b>in</b> the case of other <b>offerings, they render</b> the offering <b>permitted</b> for eating since these actions facilitate atonement after the fact, despite the fact that blood was not placed on all four corners of the altar.",

            "<b>Rava said to</b> Rav Oshaya: <b>When</b> this question <b>was</b> initially <b>asked,</b> and the Sages stated their opinions concerning the matter, <b>it was asked with regard to the permission</b> to partake of the sin offering.

In this case it is <b>Beit Shammai who are</b> more <b>stringent,</b> as they permit the meat of a sin offering only after two placements have been placed.

If the owner of the offering died before any of the blood was placed on the altar, the blood may not be placed, and the offering is burned as a disqualified offering.

If the priest’s intent renders the offering <i>piggul</i> whether it was during the first, second, or third set of presentations, evidently Rabbi Meir’s ruling must be based on the consideration that one can render an offering <i>piggul</i> during half a permitting factor. According to Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish’s claim that Rabbi Meir’s reason is that anyone who performs an action performs it with his initial intent, the offering shoud be <i>piggul</i> only if the first set of presentations was performed with an improper intention while the rest were performed silently.",
            "<b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Avin says: What are we dealing with here?</b> We are not dealing with a case of a priest who had improper intention in the presentations themselves, where the issue of half a permitting factor is relevent. Rather, we are dealing with a case <b>where</b> he had an improper intention that can <b>render</b> the offering <b><i>piggul</i> during</b> the act of <b>slaughter.</b> In other words, after presenting the blood of the bull inside the Sanctuary, the rest of the blood spilled, and he had to slaughter another bull so that he could continue with the presentations, this time on the Curtain. The reason for Rabbi Meir’s ruling is <b>that</b> the act of slaughter <b>is one permitting factor,</b> and therefore the priest’s improper intent involved an entire service, not half a permitting factor. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, what is the reason for</b> the ruling of <b>the Rabbis?</b>",
            "<b>Rava says: Who are</b> these <b>Rabbis?</b> This <b>is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, as we learned</b> in a mishna (109b): With regard to <b>the handful</b> of a meal offering, <b>and the frankincense, and the incense, and the meal offering of priests, and the meal offering of</b> the <b>anointed priest, and the meal offering</b> brought with the <b>libations</b> that accompany animal offerings, in a case <b>where one sacrificed</b> even <b>an olive-bulk from</b> any <b>one of these,</b> which should be sacrificed on the altar, <b>outside</b> the Temple, he is <b>liable,</b> as the burning of an olive-bulk is considered a proper burning. <b>And Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> him <b>exempt unless he sacrifices the whole of</b> any one of these items outside the Temple. This indicates that according to Rabbi Eliezer even when one performs a proper action he is not liable unless he completes the service. The same should apply to the slaughter of different bulls for different sets of presentations; one should be liable only if he rendered each of them <i>piggul</i>.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: How can you explain Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion with regard to the presentation of the blood in this manner? <b>But doesn’t Rava say: And Rabbi Eliezer concedes with regard to blood</b> that even one who sacrifices part of the blood outside the Temple is liable? <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Yoma</i> 60a) that <b>Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Shimon say:</b> If the blood of the bull or goat of Yom Kippur spilled, even if this occurred in the middle of one of the sets of sprinklings, and the High Priest slaughtered another animal, nevertheless, <b>from the place that he interrupted</b> that particular rite, when the blood spilled, <b>there he resumes</b> performance of that rite. In Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion, each individual sprinkling in each of these rites is an act in and of itself, and therefore the offering can be rendered <i>piggul</i> through any one of them. This is certainly not the opinion of the Rabbis who disagree with Rabbi Meir in the <i>baraita</i>.",
            "<b>Rather, Rava says:</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish would explain that the <i>baraita</i> does not mean that the priest had an improper intention either during the first set of sprinklings or the second or the third.

This indicates that he did not have improper intent during all the sprinklings but only in part of them. The Gemara comments: Indeed, this is <b>difficult,</b> as the wording of the <i>baraita</i> does not suit this interpretation.",
            "§ The Gemara returns to discuss the <i>baraita</i> that addresses the blood presented inside the Sanctuary. <b>The Master said</b> that if the High Priest had an improper intention in one of the sets of presentations, e.g., inside the Holy of Holies, <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> The offering is <b><i>piggul</i> and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for its</b> consumption, despite the fact that he performed the rest of the rite silently.

            "<b>But</b> here, in the case of the bull or goat of Yom Kippur, <b>since he intended</b> to burn the offering beyond its designated time while he was sprinkling the blood <b>inside</b> the Holy of Holies, the sprinkling is <b>not valid,</b> and therefore the High Priest is <b>considered like one who did not sprinkle</b> the blood, as every one of the sprinklings of the blood of an inner sin offering is indispensable.

Since the priest did not use that blood again, the service inside the Holy of Holies was completed, and that permitting factor was performed properly. He then had to slaughter another bull and goat for the other sprinklings inside the Sanctuary, which he again performed with improper intent and again the blood spilled. The same sequence repeated itself in the sprinklings on the inner altar and on the top of the altar. In this manner each permitting factor was performed properly.",
            "<b>Rava said: You</b> may <b>even say</b> that this is a case where there is only <b>one bull and one goat,</b> as the sprinkling <b>effects acceptance with regard to</b> the offering’s status of <b><i>piggul</i>.</b> In other words, even though the High Priest sprinkled the blood inside the Holy of Holies with an improper intention, and thereby disqualified the offering, nevertheless, since he completed the service, he is considered as having sacrificed all the permitting factors with regard to <i>piggul</i>.",
            "§ The <i>baraita</i> mentioned that there are <b>forty-three</b> presentations of the blood of the bull and the goat of Yom Kippur. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> otherwise in a different <i>baraita</i>, that there are <b>forty-seven</b> presentations of that blood? The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> statement, that there are forty-three presentations, <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the one who says</b> that the High Priest <b>mixes</b> the blood of the bull and the goat before placing it <b>on the corners</b> of the inner altar, rather than placing the blood of each one separately. <b>And that</b> statement, that there are forty-seven presentations, <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the one who says</b> that the High Priest <b>does not mix</b> the two types of blood before placing them <b>on the corners,</b> but sprinkles four times from the blood of the bull and another four times from the blood of the goat, and only afterward mixes the blood of the two animals for placement on the top of the altar.",

This serves to <b>exclude</b> the impure <b>flesh</b> of offerings, <b>as its impurity cannot depart from it,</b> since ritually impure flesh cannot be purified. <b>And if it is so</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement is correct, the <b>impurity</b> of flesh <b>can</b> in fact <b>depart from it by means of the fire</b> of the altar.",

It speaks only in general terms about impurity that can or cannot depart from an item. <b>Rather, Rav Pappa says:</b> In that verse <b>we are dealing with the meat of peace offerings, which are not fit for sacrificing,</b> as the meat of a peace offering is eaten rather than being burned on the altar.

            "<b>Ravina says</b> there is a different answer: Even if the impurity of flesh leaves it when it is brought up to the altar, this verse cannot be referring to the impure meat of peace offerings, as the phrase <b>“having his impurity upon him”</b> is referring to <b>one whose impurity departs from him when he is whole;</b> the term “upon him” indicates that he is in a state of wholeness. This serves to <b>exclude</b> sacrificial <b>flesh,</b> which is <b>an item whose impurity does not depart from it when it is whole, but</b> only <b>when it is deficient,</b> i.e., when fire takes hold of it on the altar.",
            "§ The Gemara proceeds to analyze <b>the</b> matter <b>itself.</b> In the <i>baraita</i> the Rabbis attempt to prove that the verse: “But the soul that eats of the meat of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which pertain to the Lord, having his impurity upon him, that soul shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 7:20), is referring to a ritually impure person, and not to impure flesh. The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>“Having his impurity upon him”; the verse speaks of impurity of the body</b> of the person, not the impurity of the flesh of the offering.",
            "The question may be raised: <b>Do you say</b> that it is dealing <b>with impurity of the body? Or is it</b> speaking <b>only of impurity of the flesh,</b> as is suggested by the fact that the term for “meat” [<i>basar</i>] is masculine, matching the masculine pronominal suffix attached to the word “impurity,” whereas the word for “soul” [<i>nefesh</i>] is feminine? The answer is that <b>here it is stated:</b> “Having <b>his impurity</b> upon him,” <b>and there it is stated:</b> “Whoever touches the dead, the body of any man that has died, and does not purify himself, he has defiled the Tabernacle of the Lord; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel, because the water of sprinkling was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be impure, <b>his impurity is</b> yet <b>upon him”</b> (Numbers 19:13). <b>Just as there, the verse is speaking of impurity of the body, so too here, the verse is speaking of impurity of the body.</b>",

In this connection the Gemara notes that <b>Rava said: Any verse that was not explained by Rav Yitzḥak bar Avudimi, and any <i>baraita</i> that was not explained by Rav Ze’eiri, was not explained,</b> as these Sages are the most accomplished interpreters of verses and <i>baraitot</i>, respectively.",

The beginning of that verse: “And when anyone shall touch,” and the end of that verse: “That soul shall be cut off,” are in the feminine form, whereas the middle of the verse: “And eat of the meat,” is in the masculine form, and yet it is clear that the verse is speaking of impurity of the body. The same may be said about the previous verse: <b>Since the verse begins in the feminine</b> form <b>and ends in the feminine</b> form, <b>and the masculine</b> form is used <b>in the middle, the verse</b> must be <b>speaking of impurity of the body,</b> despite the change from the feminine to the masculine.",
            "The Gemara cites the <b><i>baraita</i>,</b> alluded to by Rava, through which the interpretative prowess of Rav Ze’eiri is demonstrated. This <i>baraita</i> also discusses the topic of eating consecrated food while in a state of ritual impurity. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If</b> the <b>lenient are stated, why are</b> the <b>stringent stated; and if</b> the <b>stringent</b> are <b>stated, why</b> are the <b>lenient stated?

            "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> are the <b>lenient, and what</b> are the <b>stringent?</b> It is known that the <i>baraita</i> is discussing the broad topic of eating consecrated food in a state of impurity, but its precise meaning requires elucidation. <b>If we say</b> that the <b>lenient</b> is referring to the consumption of second <b>tithe</b> while one is impure, and the <b>stringent</b> is referring to the partaking of <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> the portion of the produce designated for the priest, in a state of impurity, how can the <i>baraita</i> say that had the Torah stated only the prohibition against eating second tithe <b>I would</b> incorrectly <b>have said</b> that one who partakes of <i>teruma</i> is liable to be punished <b>with death</b> at the hand of Heaven? <b>Now too, this</b> is the <i>halakha</i>; one who partakes of <i>teruma</i> when he is in a state of impurity is indeed liable <b>to</b> be punished with <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven.",
            "<b>And furthermore,</b> is it correct to say: <b>And if</b> the Torah <b>had not stated</b> the stringent case of <i>teruma</i> but only the lenient case of second tithe, and I would learn the <i>halakha</i> in the stringent case from the <i>halakha</i> in the lenient case by way of an <i>a fortiori</i> inference, <b>I would</b> then <b>say</b> that the punishment in the stringent case is that <b>of death</b> at the hand of Heaven? This is impossible, as there is a principle with regard to <i>a fortiori</i> inferences that <b>it is sufficient for the</b> conclusion that <b>emerges from</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference to be like</b> its <b>source.</b> In other words, a <i>halakha</i> derived by means of an <i>a fortiori</i> inference can be no more stringent than the source from which it is derived. In this instance, if an impure person who eats second tithe is flogged for violating a prohibition, then the punishment for partaking of <i>teruma</i> in a state of impurity, were it not stated in the Torah, could be no more severe than that.",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>to what</b> food is this referring? <b>If</b> it is referring to the partaking <b>of <i>teruma</i>,</b> both <b>this</b> one who was rendered impure by the dead <b>and that</b> one who was rendered impure by a creeping animal <b>are</b> liable to be punished <b>with death</b> at the hand of Heaven.

            "The <i>baraita</i> clarifies this derivation: The <i>halakha</i> that the prohibition of <b><i>notar</i></b> applies to all these offerings is <b>derived</b> through a verbal analogy of <b>profanation</b> in the context of <i>notar</i>: “And if anything remains until the third day, it shall be burned in fire…and anyone who eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has profaned the sacred item of the Lord” (Leviticus 19:6–8), and <b>profanation</b> stated in the verse discussing <b>ritual impurity:</b> “And that they do not profane My holy name.” <b>And</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b><i>piggul</i></b> applies to all these offerings is subsequently <b>derived</b> through a verbal analogy of <b>“iniquity”</b> in the context of <i>piggul</i> and <b>“iniquity”</b> stated in the verse discussing <b><i>notar</i>.</b> With regard to <i>piggul</i>, the verse states: “It shall be <i>piggul</i>, and the soul that eats of it shall bear his iniquity” (Leviticus 7:18), and with regard to <i>notar</i>, it is stated in the aforementioned verse: “And anyone who eats it shall bear his iniquity.”",
            "The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>And since</b> the verse <b>eventually includes all items,</b> even meal offerings and the <i>log</i> of oil of a leper, <b>now</b> one can ask: <b>Why does</b> the verse <b>state</b> <i>piggul</i> specifically with regard to <b>peace offerings?</b> The <i>baraita</i> answers: This serves <b>to tell you</b> that the offering must be similar to peace offerings in the following way: <b>Just as peace offerings are notable</b> in <b>that they have permitting factors, either for</b> consumption by <b>a person or for</b> burning on <b>the altar, so too,</b> with regard to <b>any</b> item <b>that has permitting factors, either for a person or for the altar, one is liable for</b> eating <b>it due to</b> violation of the prohibition of <b><i>piggul</i>.</b>",

            "The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that the fact that the verse specifies peace offerings as the standard case of <i>piggul</i> teaches: <b>Just as peace offerings are notable</b> in <b>that they have</b> a permitting factor that is sacrificed <b>on the external altar,</b> i.e., their blood, <b>and one is liable for</b> eating <b>them</b> due to violation of the prohibition of <i>piggul</i>, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>any</b> item <b>that</b> has a permitting factor that <b>is</b> sacrificed <b>on the external altar, one is liable for</b> eating <b>it due to</b> violation of the prohibition of <b><i>piggul</i>.</b> This serves to <b>exclude bulls that are burned and goats that are burned: Since</b> their blood is <b>not</b> presented <b>on the external altar like peace offerings, one is not liable for</b> eating <b>them due to</b> violation of the prohibition of <b><i>piggul</i>.</b>",
            "The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said:</b> Perhaps the <i>halakha</i> of <i>piggul</i> extends only to an offering that is <b>similar to peace offerings: What is this</b> offering that is similar to a peace offering but not included in the category of peace offerings?

            "The Gemara clarifies the refutation: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about peace offerings?</b> They are notable in <b>that they require placing hands</b> on the head of the offering, <b>libations, and waving of the breast and thigh.</b> None of these apply in the case of a firstborn offering.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <i>piggul</i> status applies to a firstborn offering is derived through the hermeneutical principle of a generalization and a detail and a generalization, <b>from</b> the following verse: <b>“And if any be at all eaten</b> of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings on the third day, it shall not be accepted” (Leviticus 7:18). The terms: “And if any” and “be at all eaten” are generalizations, while the words: “The flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offering” constitute a detail. According to the hermeneutical principle of a generalization and a detail and a generalization, in such a case one includes any item that is similar to the detail, and therefore one includes the firstborn offering.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>These two</b> phrases <b>are generalizations that are adjacent to one another,</b> which means that this is not an instance of a generalization and a detail and a generalization, as they are not in that order. <b>Rava said:</b> The hermeneutical principle applies even in this case, <b>as they say in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael: In <b>every place that you find two generalizations that are adjacent to one another, cast</b> the <b>detail</b> that is written afterward <b>between them, and interpret them in</b> the manner of <b>a generalization and a detail</b> and a generalization.

            "<b>Rav Yosef said:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> ruling, that even the <i>log</i> of oil of a leper is included in the prohibition of <i>piggul</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who</b> agrees with the Rabbis that the libations of an animal offering are not permitted by the blood of the offering.

            "The Gemara cites the source for Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the <b><i>log</i> of oil of a leper,</b> one who derives benefit <b>from it</b> is liable for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property if he derives benefit from it at any point after it has been consecrated in a service vessel, <b>until the blood</b> of the leper’s guilt offering <b>is sprinkled.</b> At this stage the oil is permitted to the priests, and therefore the prohibition against misusing property consecrated to the Temple no longer applies to it. Once <b>the blood has been sprinkled, one may not derive benefit</b> from the oil <i>ab initio</i>, by rabbinic law, as it must still be placed on the leper’s right ear, thumb, and big toe. <b>But</b> if one derived benefit from it, he is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misuse.</b>",

            "The <i>baraita</i> clarifies what is included by the term “every” in each of these clauses. The verse states: <b>“Every offering of theirs,”</b> which serves <b>to include</b> the <b><i>log</i> of oil of a leper;</b> it too is given to the priests. The Gemara explains why it is necessary to derive from the verse that the oil is a gift to the priesthood: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that the oil should not be included, as <b>the Merciful One writes</b> in this same verse: <b>“From the fire,” and this</b> <i>log</i> of oil, notwithstanding its status as an offering, <b>is not reserved from the fire.</b> Only an item concerning which part of it is brought to the altar can be said to be reserved from the fire, and none of the oil is brought to the altar. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> by the phrase: “Every offering of theirs,” that the oil goes to the priests.",
            "The phrase: <b>“Every meal offering of theirs,”</b> serves <b>to include</b> the <b><i>omer</i> meal offering,</b> brought as a communal offering on the sixteenth of Nisan, <b>and the meal offering of jealousy,</b> brought by a <i>sota</i>. The Gemara elaborates: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that as the verse states with regard to the consumption of sacrificial food by the priests: <b>“And they shall eat those items with which atonement is achieved”</b> (Exodus 29:33), only those foods that facilitate atonement are given to the priests. <b>And</b> this would exclude the <i>omer</i> meal offering and the meal offering of jealousy, as <b>the <i>omer</i> meal offering comes to permit</b> the consumption of the new crop, <b>and the meal offering of jealousy comes to clarify</b> the <b>transgression</b> of the <i>sota</i>, as part of the ordeal undergone by the woman. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> by the phrase: “Every meal offering of theirs,” that even these meal offerings are eaten by the priests.",
            "The phrase: <b>“And every sin offering of theirs,”</b> serves <b>to include the bird sin offering;</b> its meat too is given to the priests. The Gemara explains: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that this meat should not be eaten at all, as <b>it is</b> an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass,</b> since the bird is killed by pinching its nape (see Leviticus 5:8) rather than by slaughtering, which is the manner of ritual slaughter of non-sacred birds. Therefore, the phrase: “And every sin offering of theirs,” teaches that the bird sin offering is eaten by the priests.",
            "The phrase: <b>“Every guilt offering of theirs,”</b> serves <b>to include the guilt offering of a nazirite</b> who contracted ritual impurity, <b>and the guilt offering of a leper.</b> The Gemara elaborates: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that these should not be given to the priests to eat, as <b>they come to qualify</b> these individuals, rather than to atone. The guilt offering of a nazirite renders him fit to restart his term of naziriteship, and the guilt offering of a leper qualifies him to eat sacrificial food, whereas the verse states: “And they shall eat those items with which atonement is achieved” (Exodus 29:33). Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> by the phrase: “Every guilt offering of theirs,” that these offerings as well are eaten by the priests.",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>It is explicitly written with regard to the guilt offering of a leper</b> that it is consumed by the priests: “For as the sin offering is the priest’s, so is the guilt offering” (Leviticus 14:13). Why, then, is this derivation necessary? <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> means to say that the phrase: “Every guilt offering of theirs,” serves <b>to include the guilt offering of a nazirite,</b> teaching that it is <b>like the guilt offering of a leper,</b> in that both are eaten by the priests.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: With regard to the phrase <b>“which they shall render</b> to Me,” <b>this is</b> referring to an item <b>stolen</b> from <b>a convert.</b> One who robs a convert who then dies with no heirs must give the stolen item and an additional one-fifth to the priests.

            "The <i>baraita</i> also teaches: <b>And</b> gentiles <b>cannot render</b> an animal <b>a substitute.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this?

And you shall eat before the Lord your God, in the place that He shall choose to place His name there, the tithe of your grain” (Deuteronomy 14:22–23).

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But does a matter derived via a juxtaposition again teach via a juxtaposition?</b> There is a principle that in consecrated matters, a <i>halakha</i> derived via a juxtaposition cannot teach another <i>halakha</i> via a juxtaposition. The Gemara answers: This derivation is not relevant exclusively to consecrated matters, as the <b>tithe of grains is non-sacred</b> food.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that when implementing this principle <b>we follow</b> the source that <b>teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i>, i.e., if the matter that teaches the first juxtaposition involves non-sacred items, one can employ two juxtapositions even with regard to deriving the <i>halakha</i> for consecrated matters. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that <b>we follow</b> the matter that <b>is taught</b> the <i>halakha</i>, i.e., the case to which we wish to apply the <i>halakha</i>, and if that case involves offerings one cannot employ two juxtapositions, <b>what can be said?</b>",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the reason why gentiles cannot bring an animal tithe offering is that <b>animal tithe is an obligation for which there is no fixed time, and</b> with regard to any <b>obligation for which there is no fixed time, a Jew can bring</b> it but <b>gentiles cannot bring</b> it. And as stated, substitution is juxtaposed with the animal tithe, and therefore gentiles can also not render an animal a substitute.",

            "The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>And</b> this may be derived via <b>a logical derivation: Just as</b> with regard to <b><i>piggul</i>, which</b> renders one who unwittingly eats it liable to bring <b>a fixed</b> sin offering, <b>and</b> this liability is incurred <b>with one</b> change in his <b>awareness,</b> i.e., it suffices for the sinner to become aware after the fact that he had sinned unwittingly, <b>and</b> it has <b>no permitted</b> exceptions <b>from its general</b> prohibition, as there are no circumstances in which one is permitted to eat <i>piggul</i>, and yet <b>one is liable due to</b> violation of the prohibition against eating <i>piggul</i> <b>only for an item that has permitting factors, either for</b> consumption by <b>a person or for</b> burning on <b>the altar,</b> so too, the same should certainly apply to the more lenient case of ritual impurity.",
            "The Gemara elaborates: <b>Impurity</b> is more lenient than <i>piggul</i>, <b>as</b> it renders the unwitting sinner liable only to bring <b>a sliding-scale offering,</b> which varies according to his financial circumstances: A poor person brings a bird offering or even a meal offering (see Leviticus 5:6–13). <b>And</b> liability is incurred only <b>with two</b> changes in his <b>awareness,</b> i.e., when the sinner was aware of his impurity beforehand, then forgot about it at the time of his sin, and then once again become aware of his impurity. <b>And</b> it has <b>permitted</b> exceptions <b>from its general</b> prohibition with regard to the community, as it is permitted to sacrifice communal offerings in the Temple in a state of impurity. With these leniencies in mind, <b>is it not right that one should be liable</b> due to violation of the prohibition against eating consecrated food while ritually impure <b>only for an item that has permitting factors, either for a person or for the altar.</b>",
            "Therefore, <b>the verse states,</b> with regard to eating consecrated foods in a state of ritual impurity: “That they separate themselves from the sacred items of the children of Israel, <b>which they consecrate to Me,</b> and that they do not profane My holy name” (Leviticus 22:2).

            "<b>Rather, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Approaches [<i>yikrav</i>]”?</b> This term alludes to sacrificing [<i>hakrava</i>], as though the verse has stated: Whoever sacrifices sacred items and eats them.

The term “it is” teaches that the status of the blood remains as it is, i.e., <b>it is before atonement as</b> it is <b>after atonement.</b> As the Gemara will state, there is a principle that once the mitzva involving a consecrated item has been performed, the item is no longer subject to the prohibition of misuse of consecrated property. Accordingly, the term “it is” teaches that <b>just as after atonement,</b> i.e., after the blood has been presented on the altar, it is <b>not subject to</b> the prohibition of misuse of consecrated property, as the mitzva has already been performed, <b>so too, before atonement,</b> i.e., before the blood has been presented on the altar, <b>it is not subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property.",
            "The Gemara asks: But if the term “it is” teaches that the status of the blood remains the same before and after atonement, one can <b>say</b> just the opposite: It is <b>after atonement as</b> it is <b>before atonement.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is there <b>no</b> such case? <b>But there is</b> the mitzva of <b>the removal of the ashes</b> of offerings burned on the altar. Any benefit derived from them between their removal and their required burial constitutes misuse of consecrated property, despite the fact that their mitzva has already been performed.",
            "The Gemara answers: The principle does not apply in that case, <b>because</b> the matter of <b>the removal of the ashes and</b> the matter of the <b>priestly vestments,</b> the four white garments worn by the High Priest on Yom Kippur, are both subject to the <i>halakha</i> that misuse of consecrated property applies to them even after their mitzva has been performed.

            "The Gemara raises a further difficulty: <b>This works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say</b> that the verse: “And he shall take off the linen garments, which he wore when he went into the Sanctuary, <b>and shall leave them there”</b> (Leviticus 16:23), <b>teaches that</b> the four white garments worn by the High Priest on Yom Kippur are not fit for further use, and <b>they require interment.</b>",

            "The Gemara answers: One of those terms serves <b>to exclude</b> the blood <b>from</b> the prohibition of misuse of consecrated property.

            "The Gemara challenges: <b>But let</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>teach</b> first the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the external sin offerings,</b> since those are the offerings to which the verse is referring. The Gemara explains: <b>Since</b> the <b>blood</b> of the Yom Kippur sin offerings <b>enters the innermost sanctum,</b> these offerings are <b>dear to</b> the <i>tanna</i>, and he taught them first.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And where</b> is it <b>written</b> that <b>a burnt offering</b> must be slaughtered in the <b>north</b> of the Temple courtyard? The Gemara answers that with regard to a sheep that is brought as a burnt offering the Torah states: <b>“And he shall slaughter it on the side of the altar northward</b> before the Lord; and Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall dash its blood against the altar round about” (Leviticus 1:11).",
            "The Gemara clarifies: <b>We have found</b> that this verse provides a source that <b>a young sheep</b> burnt offering must be slaughtered in the north. <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>a young bull</b> burnt offering must also be slaughtered in the north? The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states: “And if</b> his offering be <b>of the flock,</b> whether of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt offering, he shall offer it a male without blemish” (Leviticus 1:10). The conjunctive “and” represented by the letter <b><i>vav</i> adds to the previous matter.</b> The previous passage addresses cattle offerings. <b>And let</b> the <b>upper</b> passage, the place of the slaughter of a bull, <b>be learned from</b> the <b>lower</b> passage, the place of slaughtering a sheep.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that <b>we learn</b> <i>halakhot</i> in this manner. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that <b>we do not learn</b> <i>halakhot</i> in this manner, <b>what is there to say?</b>",
            "<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Immediately following the passage in the Torah addressing a guilt offering for misuse of consecrated property, the Torah discusses the <i>halakhot</i> of a provisional guilt offering, brought by one who is uncertain as to whether he committed a sin that requires a sin offering. The verse states: <b>“And if anyone</b> sin, and does any of the commandments which the Lord has commanded not to be done, though he did not know it, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity” (Leviticus 5:17). This serves <b>to render</b> him <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a provisional guilt offering for uncertain misuse</b> of consecrated property; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. And the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt</b> in such a case. The Gemara suggests: <b>What, is it not</b> that <b>they disagree with regard to this:</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Akiva, <b>holds</b> that <b>we learn</b> <i>halakhot</i> of the upper passage from the lower passage, <b>and</b> the other <b>Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that <b>we do not learn</b> <i>halakhot</i> in this manner?",
            "<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> This is not correct, <b>as everyone</b> holds that <b>we learn</b> <i>halakhot</i> of the upper passage from the lower passage. <b>And this is</b> the <b>reason that the Rabbis</b> exempt from bringing an offering one who is uncertain whether he misused consecrated property: They learn a verbal analogy. <b>It is stated here:</b> “And if anyone sin, and does any of the <b>commandments</b> which the Lord has commanded not to be done” (Leviticus 5:17). <b>And it is stated with regard to the sin offering for</b> eating forbidden <b>fat:</b> “And if any one of the common people sin through error, in doing any of the <b>commandments</b> which the Lord has commanded not to be done, and be guilty” (Leviticus 4:27).",
            "The verbal analogy teaches that <b>just as there,</b> the sin offering is brought only for an act <b>that for its intentional</b> violation <b>one is liable</b> to be punished with <b><i>karet</i>, and for its unwitting</b> violation one is liable to bring <b>a sin offering, so too here,</b> one brings a provisional guilt offering only for an act <b>that for its intentional</b> violation <b>one is liable</b> to be punished with <b><i>karet</i>, and for its unwitting</b> violation one is liable to bring <b>a sin offering,</b> which is not the case concerning misuse of consecrated property.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what does <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> derive from this verbal analogy? He learns that <b>just as there</b> the verse obligates one to bring <b>a fixed</b> sin offering, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the provisional guilt offering, one brings it for a case of uncertain transgression of a prohibition for which one would be liable to bring <b>a fixed</b> sin offering, <b>to exclude a sin offering</b> brought for uncertain transgression <b>of</b> the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or sacrificial</b> foods, <b>as</b> the sin offering for that transgression is not fixed, but <b>is a sliding-scale</b> offering. If the sinner is poor he brings a meal offering or a bird offering; if he is rich he brings an animal offering. In a case of uncertainty one does not bring a provisional guilt offering.",
            "<b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis,</b> who derived a different <i>halakha</i> from the verbal analogy, they hold that <b>there is no verbal analogy for half</b> of a matter. Once a provisional guilt offering is compared to a sin offering, it must be completely similar, and both matters are derived from the verbal analogy. The Gemara asks: <b>But Rabbi Akiva also</b> must hold that <b>there is no verbal analogy for half</b> of a matter, so why does he not agree with the derivation of the Rabbis?",
            "The Gemara reconsiders: <b>Yes,</b> this <b>is indeed so. And here they disagree with regard to this: Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that <b>it is written</b> with regard to the provisional guilt offering: <b>“And if anyone</b> sin, and does any of the commandments which the Lord has commanded not to be done, though he did not know it, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity” (Leviticus 5:17). The word “and” represented by the letter <b><i>vav</i> adds to the previous matter.</b> When a phrase begins with the conjunction <i>vav</i>, it is a continuation of the previous matter, and the <i>halakhot</i> of the previous passage can be learned from the subsequent passage. Therefore one brings a provisional guilt offering for uncertain misuse of consecrated property.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to the opinion of <b>the Rabbis also, isn’t it written: “And if anyone</b> sin”? <b>Let us say</b> that <b>they disagree about this: As</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Akiva, <b>holds</b> that a derivation from <b>a juxtaposition is preferable,</b> and derives from the juxtaposition of the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse of consecrated property to the <i>halakhot</i> of a provisional guilt offering that one is liable to bring a provisional guilt offering if he is not certain whether he misused consecrated property. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that a derivation from <b>a verbal analogy is preferable,</b> and therefore derive from a verbal analogy between the passage of misuse of consecrated property and the passage of a sin offering for eating forbidden fat that one is not liable to bring a provisional guilt offering if he is not certain whether he misused consecrated property.",
            "The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> it may be <b>that everyone</b> agrees <b>that</b> a derivation from <b>a juxtaposition is preferable. And the Rabbis would say to you</b> that the reason one is exempt from bringing a provisional guilt offering in a case of uncertain mis-use of consecrated property is that the juxtaposition should be understood in the opposite manner. <b>It is</b> the <b>lower</b> passage <b>that</b> is <b>derived from</b> the <b>upper</b> passage.",
            "The juxtaposition teaches that a provisional <b>guilt offering</b> must be a ram <b>worth</b> a minimum of two <b>silver shekels,</b> as is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the offering brought for misuse of consecrated property. This derivation is needed <b>so that you should not say</b> that a provisional guilt offering, brought for <b>his uncertain</b> transgression, <b>should not be</b> more <b>stringent than</b> the offering one brings in a case of <b>his definite</b> transgression. According to that claim, one would say that <b>just as</b> for <b>his definite</b> transgression one may bring <b>a sin offering worth</b> only <b>one-sixth [<i>danka</i>]</b> of a dinar, <b>so too,</b> for <b>his uncertain</b> transgression one may bring a provisional <b>guilt offering worth</b> only <b>one-sixth</b> of a dinar.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And from where</b> does <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> derive <b>this conclusion?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He derives</b> it <b>from</b> the verse that states: <b>“And this is the law of the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:1), which teaches that there is <b>one law for all of the guilt offerings</b> and they must all be worth at least two shekels, provisional guilt offerings included.",
            "The Gemara asks: This <b>works out well</b> according to <b>one who holds</b> that there is a derivation from the word <b>“law,”</b> but according to the <b>one who does not hold</b> that there is a derivation from the word <b>“law,” from where does he learn</b> that all guilt offerings must have the same minimum value? The Gemara answers: <b>He learns</b> it from a verbal analogy between the term <b>“according to your valuation”</b> stated with regard to a guilt offering for misuse of consecrated property (Leviticus 5:15) and the term <b>“according to your valuation”</b> stated with regard to a provisional guilt offering (Leviticus 5:18) and a guilt offering for robbery (Leviticus 5:25).",

            "The Gemara answers that it is <b>derived</b> from a verbal analogy between the term <b>“with the ram”</b> stated with regard to a guilt offering for mis-use of consecrated property (Leviticus 5:16) and the term <b>“with the ram”</b> stated with regard to the guilt offering for engaging in sexual intercourse with an espoused maidservant (Leviticus 19:22).",
            "§ The Gemara returns to discuss the mishna. <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>a sin offering requires</b> slaughter in the <b>north</b> of the Temple courtyard? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written</b> with regard to an individual sin offering: “And he shall place his hand upon the head of the sin offering, <b>and slaughter the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:29). Just as a burnt offering must be slaughtered in the north of the Temple courtyard, so too, a sin offering must also be slaughtered in the north.",

This repetition teaches that a sin offering is disqualified if it is not slaughtered in the north.",
            "§ Having derived from these verses that all sin offerings are disqualified if they are slaughtered not in the north, the Gemara questions its earlier explanation. <b>Rather, why do I</b> need the term <b>“it”</b> stated with regard to the sin offering of a king in the verse: “And he shall place his hand upon the head of the goat, and slaughter it in the place where they slaughter the burnt offering before the Lord; it is a sin offering” (Leviticus 4:24)?",

He, along with all the other princes of the tribes, brought offerings to inaugurate the altar and the Tabernacle, as recorded in the Torah (Numbers, chapter 7). Although the offerings were classified as sin offerings because they shared some characteristics of sin offerings, they were not brought to atone for any particular sin. Therefore, the term “it” teaches that the offerings of the princes did not require slaughter in the north.",
            "<b>And</b> the reason that it is necessary for the Torah to exclude Nahshon’s sin offering from the requirement of slaughter in the north is because <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the sin offering of a king: <b>“And he shall place his hand upon the head of the goat,</b> and slaughter it in the place where they slaughter the burnt offering before the Lord; it is a sin offering” (Leviticus 4:24).

            "<b>But there is</b> the case of the second <b>tithe, which</b> may be <b>redeemed, whereas</b> food that is <b>purchased with</b> second-<b>tithe</b> redemption <b>money</b> may <b>not</b> be <b>redeemed. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ma’aser Sheni</i> 10:10): With regard to food <b>that was purchased with</b> second-<b>tithe money</b> and <b>that</b> then <b>became ritually impure,</b> this ritually impure food <b>must be redeemed</b> with money, with which one must purchase other food. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The food <b>must be buried.</b> The Gemara infers from the mishna: If the food purchased with the second-tithe money <b>became impure, yes,</b> it may be redeemed, but if it <b>did not become impure,</b> it may <b>not</b> be redeemed. If so, according to Rabbi Yehuda, the <i>halakha</i> that food purchased with second-tithe money must be buried if it becomes impure is more stringent than the <i>halakha</i> for second-tithe produce itself, which may be redeemed if it becomes impure.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> the reason one may not redeem food that was purchased with second-tithe money and that then became ritually impure is not that the <i>halakha</i> is more stringent. Rather, there is a different reason. Since this food was merely purchased with second-tithe money, its <b>sanctity is not</b> as <b>strong</b> as the tithe itself and is unable <b>to grasp its redemption</b> money. Its status as second tithe is weak, and cannot be transferred to a third item. Consequently, if it becomes impure, according to Rabbi Yehuda it cannot be redeemed for money but must be buried, as an item that one is prohibited to derive benefit from.",
            "Mar Zutra asks: <b>But there is</b> the case of <b>a substitution, as</b> the status of <b>an offering does not take effect with regard to a permanently blemished</b> animal, <b>while</b> consecration performed via substitution does <b>take effect</b> with regard to an animal with a permanent blemish. Although the animal cannot be sacrificed as an offering and must be redeemed, even after its redemption it may not be used for labor and its wool may not be used.",
            "The Gemara answers: The sanctity of <b>a substitution comes by virtue of a consecrated</b> animal; therefore it has a stronger sanctity. <b>But</b> the sanctity of <b>a consecrated</b> animal itself <b>comes by virtue of a non-sacred</b> animal, as there was no consecrated animal by which the owner extended the sanctity to this animal.",
            "Mar Zutra asks: But <b>there is</b> the case of <b>a Paschal offering, as it does not require</b> the <b>placing</b> of <b>hands</b> on its head, <b>or</b> wine <b>libations</b> to accompany the offering, <b>or waving of</b> the <b>breast and thigh. While its remainder,</b> an animal that was designated as a Paschal offering but was not sacrificed at the right time, which is then sacrificed as a peace offering, has more stringent <i>halakhot</i>, because it <b>requires</b> the <b>placing</b> of <b>hands</b> on its head, <b>and</b> wine <b>libations</b> to accompany the offering, <b>and waving of</b> the <b>breast and thigh.</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>A Paschal offering on the rest of the days of the year is</b> the same as <b>a peace offering,</b> and the animal is no longer considered to be a Paschal offering. Since it is a peace offering, all the <i>halakhot</i> of a peace offering apply to it, and the fact that it was once designated as a Paschal offering is irrelevant. The conclusion of the Gemara is that there are no cases where a secondary status is more stringent than the corresponding primary status. Therefore, the derivation from the <i>halakha</i> of a sin offering to the <i>halakha</i> of a burnt offering, that the latter should be disqualified if it was not slaughtered in the north or if its blood was not collected in the north, remains.",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> there is a different proof that even after the fact a burnt offering that was not slaughtered in the north is disqualified. <b>The verse states:</b> “And slaughter the sin offering in the place of <b>the burnt offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:29). Since the earlier verse (Leviticus 4:24) already stated: “In the place of the burnt offering,” the repetition in this verse stresses that <b>it shall be in its place,</b> meaning that the offering is disqualified if it is slaughtered anywhere else.",
            "§ The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that a guilt offering,</b> which is an offering of the most sacred order, <b>requires</b> slaughter in the <b>north?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “In the place where they slaughter the burnt offering they shall slaughter the guilt offering,</b> and its blood shall be sprinkled around the altar” (Leviticus 7:2). Since the burnt offering must be slaughtered in the north, the guilt offering must also be slaughtered in the north.",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that the one who <b>collects</b> the blood must <b>himself</b> stand in the north?

            "The Gemara asks: <b>We have found</b> a verse teaching that in order <b>to</b> perform the <b>mitzva</b> in the optimal manner, the slaughtering of the guilt offering is in the north. <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>to disqualify</b> after the fact an offering slaughtered elsewhere, not in the north? The Gemara answers: <b>Another verse is written,</b> referring to a guilt offering, which states: <b>“And he shall slaughter the sheep</b> in the place where they slaughter the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the place of the Sanctuary; for as the sin offering, so is the guilt offering; to the priest, it is most holy” (Leviticus 14:13).

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But does this</b> verse <b>come to</b> teach <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i>? <b>This</b> verse is <b>necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a matter that was included in a general</b> category <b>but left to discuss a new matter,</b> i.e., if a novel aspect or special ruling is taught with regard to a specific case within a broader general category, <b>you may not return it to its general</b> category even for other matters, and this case is understood to have been entirely removed from the general category, <b>until the verse explicitly returns it to its general</b> category.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>How so?</b> The verse states: <b>“And he shall slaughter the sheep in the place where they slaughter the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the place of the Sanctuary; for as the sin offering, so is the guilt offering;</b> to the priest, it is most holy” (Leviticus 14:13). <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state: “As the sin offering, so is the guilt offering,”</b> since the verse had already equated the guilt offering with the sin offering, <b>why</b> does the <b>verse state: “As the sin offering, so is the guilt offering”?</b> What does it serve to teach?",
            "<b>Since the guilt offering of a leper left</b> the general category of guilt offerings <b>to teach a new matter,</b> as there is a <i>halakha</i> unique to the guilt offering of a leper in that blood of the offering is placed <b>on</b> the right <b>thumb of the hand and</b> the right <b>big toe of the foot and</b> the <b>right ear</b> of the leper, one <b>might</b> have thought that this guilt offering <b>does not require placement of blood or</b> the burning of <b>sacrificial portions on the altar,</b> as the <i>halakhot</i> of this guilt offering are unique.",
            "To counter this reasoning, <b>the verse states: “As the sin offering, so is the guilt offering.” Just as the sin offering requires the placement of the blood and</b> the burning of <b>sacrificial portions on the altar, so too, the guilt offering of a leper requires placement of the blood and</b> the burning of <b>sacrificial portions on</b> the <b>altar.</b> Similarly, just as the verse had to teach these two <i>halakhot</i>, so too, the verse had to state: “And he shall slaughter the sheep in the place where they slaughter the sin offering and the burnt offering,” to teach that it requires slaughter in the north. It cannot serve as a source for the general <i>halakha</i> that a guilt offering slaughtered in a place other than in the north is disqualified.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>If so,</b> that the optimal manner to perform the mitzva is to slaughter a guilt offering in the north but failure to do so does not disqualify the offering, <b>let</b> the Torah <b>write</b> the requirement to slaughter in the north <b>in this</b> context, i.e., in the context of the guilt offering of a leper, <b>and not write it in that</b> context, i.e., that of the standard guilt offering. The requirement for slaughter in the north for all other guilt offerings could be derived from the guilt offering of the leper. The repetition of the requirement to slaughter in the north serves to disqualify a guilt offering whose slaughter is not in the north.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>This works out well if we hold</b> that with regard to a matter that <b>left</b> its category <b>to teach a new matter,</b> the following principle applies: That matter itself <b>does not learn</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>from its general</b> category until the Torah explicitly returns it to that category,"

Therefore, when the verse states that it requires slaughter in the north of the Temple courtyard, the phrase is not needed to teach the <i>halakha</i> about the guilt offering of a leper, and it can be used to teach the <i>halakha</i> about guilt offerings in general.",

To prevent this incorrect assumption, the verse had to specifically teach the juxtaposition to a burnt offering.",
            "<b>Mar Zutra, son of Rav Mari, said to Ravina: But let</b> the verse <b>juxtapose</b> the guilt offering of a leper only <b>to a burnt offering and not juxtapose it to a sin offering.</b> The juxtaposition to a sin offering appears superfluous.",

One can ask: <b>For what <i>halakha</i></b> is this offering juxtaposed to that of a peace offering? <b>If</b> it is <b>to</b> teach that the priest must sacrifice <b>the diaphragm with the liver and the two kidneys</b> from the offering, that is <b>written with regard to</b> the offering <b>itself,</b> in the previous verse.

            "It is written <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the verse <b>wants to teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the diaphragm with the liver and the two kidneys,</b> deriving it <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the offering of <b>the bull for an unwitting communal sin,</b> then teaching it <b>to</b> apply it to the <i>halakha</i> of the <b>goats</b> brought as sin offerings for communal <b>idol worship.

The offering for an unwitting communal sin is juxtaposed to the sin offering brought by the High Priest in the verse: “So shall he do with the bull; as he did with the bull of the sin offering, so shall he do with this” (Leviticus 4:20).",
            "<b>For this</b> reason it <b>was necessary</b> for the verse to state: <b>“As it is taken off</b> from the ox” (Leviticus 4:10), so <b>that it is as though it wrote</b> explicitly <b>in</b> the passage discussing the bull for an unwitting communal sin <b>itself.</b> One of the hermeneutical principles applied to understanding verses in the Torah is: If the <i>halakha</i> stated is not required for the matter in which it is written, apply it to another matter. When this principle is employed, the <i>halakha</i> written in one context is viewed as if it were written elsewhere. In this case, as it was not necessary for the verse to write the juxtaposition to a peace offering in the context of the sin offering brought by the High Priest, it is applied to the case of the bull for an unwitting communal sin. <b>And</b> therefore it <b>will not be</b> a case of <b>a matter derived via a juxtaposition</b> that <b>then teaches</b> its <i>halakha</i> <b>via a juxtaposition.</b>",

            "§ Before beginning a lengthy discussion concerning derivations via compounded methodologies of the hermeneutical principles, the Gemara presents <b>a mnemonic</b> for its forthcoming discussion: <b>Juxtaposition, verbal analogy, an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference.",
            "The principle that <b>a matter derived via a juxtaposition cannot then teach</b> its <i>halakha</i> <b>via a juxtaposition</b> is indicated <b>either from</b> the proof <b>of Rava or from</b> the proof <b>of Ravina,</b> both cited earlier.

            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Natan ben Avtolemos says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> if leprosy <b>of garments spreads</b> throughout an entire garment <b>that it is pure?</b> It is derived via a verbal analogy: <b>A bareness within [<i>karaḥat</i>] and a bareness without [<i>gabbaḥat</i>]</b> are <b>stated with regard to</b> leprosy of <b>garments:</b> “And the priest shall look, after that the mark is washed; and behold, if the mark has not changed its color, and the mark has not spread, it is impure; you shall burn it in the fire; it is a fret, whether the bareness be within or without” (Leviticus 13:55); <b>and a bald head [<i>karaḥat</i>] and a bald forehead [<i>gabbaḥat</i>]</b> are <b>stated with regard to</b> leprosy of <b>a person:</b> “But if there be in the bald head, or the bald forehead, a reddish-white plague, it is leprosy breaking out in his bald head, or his bald forehead” (Leviticus 13:42).",
            "<b>Just as there,</b> with regard to a person, if the leprosy <b>spread throughout him</b> entirely he is <b>pure,</b> as the verse states: “Then the priest shall look; and behold, if the leprosy has covered all of his flesh, he shall pronounce the one who has the mark pure; it is all turned white: He is pure” (Leviticus 13:13), <b>so too here</b> with regard to garments, if the leprosy <b>spread throughout the entire</b> garment it is <b>pure.</b>",
            "The Gemara continues its proof: <b>But there,</b> with regard to the head, which serves as the source for this verbal analogy, <b>from where do we</b> derive that if the leprosy spreads throughout the head he is pure? <b>As it is written:</b> “And if the leprosy breaks out on the skin, and the leprosy covers all the skin of the one who has the mark, <b>from his head to his feet,</b> as far as it appears to the priest” (Leviticus 13:12). <b>And</b> the verse thereby <b>juxtaposes</b> leprosy on <b>his head to</b> leprosy on his <b>foot,</b> teaching the following <i>halakha</i>: <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to leprosy of the body and foot, if <b>its entirety turned white,</b> and it <b>spread all over him,</b> he is <b>pure, so too here,</b> in the case of leprosy of the head, if <b>its entirety turned white and it spread over all his</b> head, he is <b>pure.</b> Evidently, a matter derived via a juxtaposition can then teach its <i>halakha</i> to another matter via a verbal analogy.",

            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> it would seem there <b>is a logical inference</b> to counter this logic. <b>It is stated</b> that <b>blood</b> is to be sprinkled <b>above</b> the red line, referring to the blood of an animal sin offering, which is to be sprinkled on the corners on the upper half of the altar, <b>and it is stated</b> that <b>blood</b> is to be sprinkled <b>below</b> the red line, referring to the blood of a bird sin offering, which is to be sprinkled on the lower half of the altar. <b>Just as</b> with regard to the <b>blood</b> about <b>which</b> it <b>is stated</b> that it is to be <b>below</b> the red line, if it is a case <b>where one placed</b> it <b>above</b> the red line, it does <b>not effect atonement,</b> as the Sages derived from the verse: “And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar, and the remainder of the blood shall be squeezed out at the base of the altar; it is a sin offering” (Leviticus 5:9), <b>so too,</b> with regard to the <b>blood,</b> about <b>which</b> it <b>is stated</b> that it is to be <b>above</b> the red line, if it is a case <b>where one placed</b> it <b>below</b> the red line, it does <b>not effect atonement.</b>",

            "Rava continues: <b>Rather,</b> when the <i>baraita</i> states that the blood of the offerings offered inside the Sanctuary are those concerning which the inner altar does not complete the atonement it means that <b>the inner altar does not complete</b> the atonement <b>alone,</b> but <b>rather</b> requires that blood also be sprinkled inside the Sanctuary on the <b>Curtain</b> separating the Sanctuary and Holy of Holies.",

The Gemara answers: The first <i>halakha</i>, connecting the two loaves of <i>Shavuot</i> to the bread accompanying a thanks offering, is not derived via a juxtaposition, but rather via a superfluous word. The term <b>“You shall bring,”</b> written with regard to the two loaves, <b>is extra,</b> and is therefore considered as if it were written explicitly with regard to the leavened bread accompanying the thanks offering.

            "Rabbi Zeira <b>went out, examined</b> the matter, <b>and discovered</b> a mishna that alludes to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Tamid</i> 2:5): The priests <b>selected fine wood of a fig tree from</b> the chamber of firewood, with which <b>to lay out a second arrangement</b> of wood on the altar so that coals from this arrangement could be used <b>for</b> burning the <b>incense.</b> This second arrangement was located <b>opposite</b> the <b>southwest corner</b> of the altar, <b>distanced from</b> the <b>corner northward</b> by <b>four cubits.</b> They would arrange enough wood which, when burned, would produce <b>approximately five <i>se’a</i></b> of <b>coals. And on Shabbat,</b> there was enough wood to produce <b>approximately eight <i>se’a</i></b> of <b>coals, as they would place there the two bowls of frankincense of the shewbread.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the</b> significance of the mishna’s <b>defining</b> the precise location of the arrangement and the fact that this is where the frankincense is burned? The Gemara embarks on a lengthy discussion to answer this question: This mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> who holds that this arrangement of wood and the burning of the frankincense must be in that precise location, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>:"

            "<b>And Rav Sherevya said:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna in <i>Tamid</i>, which holds that the entire altar was located in the northern part of the Temple courtyard? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: Since it is stated: “And you shall set the Basin between the Tent of Meeting</b> and the altar” (Exodus 40:7), and another verse states: <b>“And</b>"

It was placed <b>between the Entrance Hall and the altar, extended slightly toward the south.</b> Therefore, although the Basin was closer to the Sanctuary than the altar was, it did not actually stand between the altar and the Sanctuary.",

            "<b>Alternatively,</b> if Rabbi Yosei HaGelili <b>holds</b> that <b>half of</b> the altar was located <b>in the north</b> section of the Temple courtyard <b>and half of it</b> was located <b>in the south, let him stand</b> the Basin anywhere <b>from</b> where <b>the wall of</b> the <b>Sanctuary</b> begins <b>and southward,</b> so that it is not opposite the entrance to the Sanctuary but <b>between</b> the <b>Entrance Hall and the altar.</b> Since the entrance to the Sanctuary was five cubits wide and stood in the middle of the courtyard, and the altar was thirty-two cubits long, there would have been eleven cubits to both the north and the south of the entrance to the Sanctuary where the Basin could be placed in order to be located between the altar and the Sanctuary without interposing between the altar and the entrance to the Sanctuary.",

They are slaughtered on the ground near the altar. No, <b>rather,</b> the verse indicates that one is able to slaughter the sacrificial animals on account of the altar, i.e., <b>when</b> the altar <b>is complete [<i>shalem</i>], but not when it is lacking,</b> i.e., damaged.

            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav’s opinion, based on a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>all sacrificial</b> animals <b>that were</b> consecrated <b>before the altar was built, and then the altar was</b> subsequently <b>built,</b> the animals are <b>disqualified.</b> The Gemara assumes that this <i>baraita</i> is referring to animals that were consecrated before the building of the altar in the Second Temple. The Gemara responds: In a case where the animals were consecrated before the altar <b>was built,</b> the animals are considered <b>initially deferred,</b> i.e., deferred from the time they were initially consecrated. In this case all agree they are not permanently deferred and they can be sacrificed when the altar is built.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> explain the <i>baraita</i> as follows: If the animals were consecrated <b>before the altar was destroyed</b> in the First Temple, and then the altar was destroyed and rebuilt, the animals are still disqualified.

            "The Gemara emends the <i>baraita</i> yet again: <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where one consecrated the animals <b>before the altar was damaged, and subsequently the altar was damaged.</b> The <i>halakha</i> is that the animals are <b>disqualified.</b> It seems from this <i>baraita</i> that even sacrificial animals that were not yet slaughtered when the altar became damaged are nevertheless permanently disqualified, in contrast to the opinion of Rav. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>But did you not</b> already have to <b>emend</b> the text of the <i>baraita</i>? Emend it differently and <b>say that</b> the case is where the animals <b>were slaughtered</b> before the altar became damaged. Accordingly, there is no proof from this <i>baraita</i> with regard to the deferral of living animals.",
            "Rav said that sacrificial animals that were slaughtered in the Temple courtyard when the altar was in a damaged state are disqualified. The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t Rav Giddel say</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> In a case <b>where</b> the golden <b>altar became uprooted</b> from its location in the Sanctuary, <b>one may burn</b> the <b>incense in its place?</b> Apparently, it is not essential to have the altar in order to sacrifice offerings.",
            "The Gemara answers: It is <b>like that which Rava says</b> (60a): Although Rabbi Yehuda maintains that the entire Temple courtyard is fit for burning the sacrificial portions of offerings, <b>Rabbi Yehuda would concede with regard to</b> the presenting of the <b>blood</b> that it must be performed specifically on the altar. <b>Here too,</b> the Gemara says, <b>Rav concedes with regard to</b> the <b>blood</b> that an altar is required. Consequently, if consecrated offerings were slaughtered when the altar was in a damaged state, since the blood may not be presented, the offering is disqualified.",
            "Having briefly mentioned Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion, the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the context of the statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the inauguration of the Temple in the time of King Solomon: <b>“On that day the king sanctified the middle of the court</b> that was before the House of the Lord; as there he offered the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat of the peace offerings; <b>because the copper altar that was before the Lord was too small to receive</b> the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat of the peace offerings” (I Kings 8:64). <b>The matters</b> in the verse <b>are</b> to be understood <b>as they</b> are <b>written,</b> i.e., that the altar in the Temple was too small to receive all of the offerings that Solomon sacrificed, and Solomon therefore sanctified the Temple courtyard so that it, too, could function as an altar; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Yosei said to him:</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>But isn’t it already stated</b> with regard to the altar that Moses built: <b>“A thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar”</b> (I Kings 3:4), <b>while with regard to the Eternal House,</b> i.e., the Temple, <b>it states: “And Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered to the Lord, two and twenty thousand cattle</b> and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep” (I Kings 8:63)?",
            "<b>And when you arrive at the calculation of burnt offerings and the number of cubits</b> for each altar, <b>this</b> was <b>greater than that,</b> i.e., Solomon sacrificed more offerings per square cubit on Moses’ altar than he did on the altar in the Temple upon its inauguration. Therefore, it is difficult to suggest that the altar in the Temple was not large enough to accommodate the number of offerings that Solomon sacrificed.",
            "Rabbi Yosei presents an alternative understanding of the verse: <b>Rather, what is</b> the meaning of the phrase “because the copper altar…<b>was too small to receive”?</b> It is not referring to the altar built by Solo-mon, but rather to the copper altar built in the time of Moses, which was disqualified from use from the day of the Temple’s inauguration on. Rather than stating outright that the altar became disqualified, the verse employed a euphemism, <b>like a person who says to his friend: So-and-so is a dwarf [<i>nanas</i>], and</b> what he really means to say is that he is <b>disqualified from</b> performing the Temple <b>service.</b> Similarly, rather than stating outright that the altar built in the time of Moses became disqualified, the verse states that it was too small to accommodate the offerings sacrificed in the Temple.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> respond to this claim? <b>Rabbi Yosei is saying well,</b> i.e., his claim is persuasive.

            "§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is</b> the <b><i>karkov</i></b> of the altar? It is the area <b>between</b> one <b>corner and</b> the next <b>corner,</b> which is the <b>cubit-</b>wide <b>place</b> on top of the altar where <b>the priests</b> would <b>walk.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>the priests would walk between</b> one <b>corner and</b> the next <b>corner?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, say:</b> The <i>karkov</i> is the cubit-wide area between one corner and the other, <b>and</b> there was an additional <b>cubit</b> that was <b>the place</b> where <b>the priests</b> would <b>walk.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written:</b> “And he made for the altar a grating of network of brass, <b>under the <i>karkov</i> beneath, reaching halfway up”</b> (Exodus 38:4), which indicates that the <i>karkov</i> was on the side of the altar and not on top of it? The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: There were two</b> entities called <i>karkov</i>. <b>One</b> was a slight protrusion above the midway point of the altar <b>for aesthetic</b> purposes, <b>and one</b> was an indentation on top of the altar <b>for</b> the benefit of <b>the priests,</b> to ensure <b>that they</b> would <b>not slip</b> off the top of the altar.",
            "It was taught in a <i>baraita</i> cited above that <b>the measurement of</b> the altar’s <b>length, and the measurement of its width, and the measurement of its height are not indispensable. Rabbi Mani says:</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>provided that one does not decrease its</b> size so that it is smaller <b>than</b> the <b>altar constructed by Moses.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And how</b> large was the altar constructed by Moses? <b>Rav Yosef says:</b> One <b>cubit.</b> Those in the study hall <b>mocked</b> Rav Yosef, as it is written explicitly: <b>“Five cubits long and five cubits wide; the altar shall be square”</b> (Exodus 27:1).",
            "<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>Perhaps the Master is speaking</b> about <b>the area of the arrangement</b> of wood? Since the corners took up one cubit on each side and there was an additional cubit on each side for the priests to walk, only one cubit was left for the arrangement of wood. Rav Yosef <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>The Master,</b> i.e., Abaye, <b>who is a great man, knows what I</b> mean to <b>say.</b> Rav Yosef <b>read,</b> i.e., applied, the following verse <b>to those</b> who mocked him:"

            "<b>“The children of Keturah”</b> (Genesis 25:4). Although Keturah’s children were children of Abraham, they were not of the same caliber as Isaac. Similarly, Rav Yosef was saying that his other students were not of the caliber of Abaye. Having mentioned this term, the Gemara relates: <b>The sons of Rabbi Tarfon’s sister were sitting</b> silently <b>before Rabbi Tarfon.</b> In an attempt to encourage them to say something, <b>he began and said:</b> The verse states: <b>And Abraham took another wife, and her name was Yoḥani. They said to</b> Rabbi Tarfon: <b>It is written: “Keturah”</b> (Genesis 25:1), not Yoḥani. Rabbi Tarfon <b>read,</b> i.e., said, <b>about them</b> the phrase <b>“the children of Keturah”</b> as they were able to contribute only this small piece of information.",
            "§ <b>Abaye bar Huna says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥama bar Gurya says:</b> With regard to the <b>logs that Moses prepared</b> for the mitzva of burning wood upon the altar, <b>their length</b> was <b>a cubit and their width</b> was <b>a cubit, and their thickness</b> was <b>like</b> that of <b>a leveler,</b> a kind of flat stick used to remove the excess grain <b>heaped</b> on top of a container that holds one <b><i>se’a</i>.</b>",

The seemingly superfluous phrase “that is upon the altar” teaches <b>that the wood should not extend at all beyond</b> the area of <b>the altar</b> designated for the arrangement of wood. Since this area was one square cubit, the logs were exactly one cubit as well.",
            "§ The Gemara discusses the ramp of the altar: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Middot</i> 36a): <b>There was a ramp</b> that was located <b>on the south</b> side <b>of the altar,</b> whose size was <b>a length</b> of <b>thirty-two</b> cubits <b>by a width</b> of <b>sixteen</b> cubits. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived, i.e., from where is it derived that the ramp is on the south side of the altar? <b>Rav Huna said: The verse states: “And he shall slaughter it on the side [<i>yerekh</i>] of the altar northward”</b> (Leviticus 1:11), which teaches <b>that</b> the altar’s <b>thigh [<i>yarekh</i>] should be</b> located <b>in the north, and its face,</b> i.e., the front of the altar where the priests ascend to it, should be <b>in the south.</b> The verse likens the positioning of the altar to a person who is lying down flat, in which case if his legs are to the north, his face is to the south.",
            "The Gemara asks: Why not <b>say</b> that its <b>thigh</b> should be <b>in the north and its face</b> should also be <b>in the north?</b> Perhaps the verse is referring to a person sitting with both his face and feet in the north. <b>Rava said</b> in response: <b>Place the man on his face,</b> i.e., the analogy is to a man who is lying down. <b>Abaye said to him: On the contrary, sit the man straight up</b> so that his face and his legs are facing the same direction.",
            "Rava <b>said</b> back <b>to him: It is written</b> in a verse that the altar must be <b>“square [<i>ravua</i>]”</b> (Exodus 27:1), which indicates lying down or crouching, as it is similar to the term <i>ravutz</i>, meaning crouching. Abaye challenges Rava: <b>But</b> this word is <b>necessary to</b> teach <b>that</b> the altar must be <b>square.</b> Rava responds: <b>Is it written</b> in the verse that the altar must be <b>square [<i>merubba</i>]?</b> The verse specifically uses the form <i>ravua</i> in order to allude to the word <i>ravutz</i>, crouching. Abaye counters: <b>According to your reasoning, is it written</b> in the verse that the altar must be <b><i>ravutz</i>?</b> Rava answers: It <b>is written</b> in the verse that the altar must be <b><i>ravua</i>, which</b> is a term that <b>indicates this,</b> i.e., that the altar must be square, <b>and indicates that,</b> i.e., that its positioning is comparable to that of a person who is lying down.",
            "The Gemara adds: <b>And</b> another <b><i>tanna</i> cites</b> the source for the ramp’s positioning <b>from here, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The verse states with regard to the future altar: <b>“And its steps shall look [<i>penot</i>] toward the east”</b> (Ezekiel 43:17), which indicates that <b>all the turns [<i>pinot</i>] that you turn should be only to the right</b> and you should turn <b>to the east.</b> Only if the ramp is in the south can one turn to the right and be facing eastward.",
            "The Gemara challenges: The verse indicates only that after a person turns he is facing eastward. Why not <b>say</b> that the ramp was located in the north and the priest turns <b>left</b> and faces <b>eastward?</b> The Gemara answers: This possibility should <b>not enter your mind, as Rami bar Yeḥizkiya teaches:</b> A verse describes the <b>sea,</b> i.e., the Basin, <b>that Solomon built,</b> in the following terms: <b>“It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward [<i>ponim</i>] the north, and three looking toward [<i>ponim</i>] the west, and three looking toward [<i>ponim</i>] the south, and three looking toward [<i>ponim</i>] the east”</b> (II Chronicles 4:4). From the order of the directions in which the verse lists the groups of oxen under the Basin, it can be derived that <b>all the turns that you turn should be only to the right</b> and <b>to the east.</b>",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>That</b> verse <b>is necessary to</b> teach <b>its own</b> information describing the Basin. The Gemara explains: <b>If so, why do I</b> need the verse to repeat the term <b><i>ponim</i>, <i>ponim</i>?</b> It must be in order to teach how one turns while performing the sacrificial rite upon the altar, which, in turn, teaches the location of the ramp.",
            "§ <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yosei ben Lakonya asked Rabbi Yosei:</b> Is it so that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai used to say</b> that <b>there is airspace,</b> i.e., a gap, <b>between the ramp and the altar?</b> Rabbi Yosei <b>said to him: And you, don’t you say so</b> as well? <b>But isn’t it already stated: “And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:27)? The verse juxtaposes the flesh of the burnt offering with its blood to teach that <b>just as</b> the <b>blood</b> is presented upon the altar <b>via tossing</b> while the priest stands on the ground next to the altar (see Leviticus 1:5), <b>so too,</b> the <b>flesh</b> of the burnt offering is presented <b>via tossing.</b> In order to fulfill this requirement, the priest stands on the ramp and tosses the flesh over the gap between the ramp and the altar, so that it lands on the arrangement of wood.",
            "Rabbi Shimon ben Yosei ben Lakonya <b>said to him:</b> If the verse simply teaches that the flesh must be tossed onto the arrangement of wood, it does not prove that there must be a gap between the ramp and the altar, <b>as I say</b> that the priest should <b>stand next to</b> the <b>arrangement</b> of wood <b>and toss</b> the flesh onto it.",
            "Rabbi Yosei <b>said to him: When he tosses</b> the flesh, <b>does he toss</b> it <b>onto</b> a part of the <b>arrangement</b> of wood that is <b>burning or does he toss</b> it <b>onto</b> a part of the <b>arrangement</b> of wood <b>that is not burning? You must say</b> that <b>he tosses</b> it <b>onto</b> a part of the <b>arrangement</b> of wood that is <b>burning.</b> And <b>there,</b> according to your suggestion that the priest is standing next to the arrangement of wood, he would have to toss the flesh, <b>because it is impossible</b> to place the flesh directly into the fire without the priest getting burned. It would be unnecessary for the verse to teach that the priest tosses the flesh while standing next to the arrangement. Consequently, when the verse juxtaposed the blood with the flesh, it must be teaching that the flesh must be tossed over a gap between the ramp and the altar.",
            "<b>Rav Pappa says:</b> The requirement that there be a gap between the ramp and the altar can be derived from this verse, because the juxtaposition teaches that the flesh is <b>like blood</b> in the manner in which it is tossed: <b>Just as</b> with regard to the <b>blood</b> there is <b>space</b> on the <b>ground</b> that <b>interposes</b> between the priest and the altar, <b>so too</b> with regard to the <b>flesh,</b> there is <b>space</b> on the <b>ground</b> that <b>interposes</b> between the priest and the altar, i.e., he stands on the ground next to the altar and tosses the flesh onto the altar.",
            "§ The Gemara continues discussing the ramp: <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> There were <b>two small ramps protruding from the</b> main <b>ramp</b> that led to the altar, <b>on which</b> the priests could <b>turn to the base</b> of the altar <b>and to the surrounding ledge</b> of the altar. They were <b>separated from the altar</b> by <b>a hairbreadth, because it is stated: “Roundabout”</b> (Leviticus 1:5), with regard to the altar. This indicates that nothing is attached to the entire perimeter of the altar. <b>And Rabbi Abbahu says</b> there is a different source, as it states: <b>“Square”</b> (Exodus 27:1), and if the ramps would be connected to the altar it would no longer be square.",
            "The Gemara continues: <b>And it was necessary</b> for the verse <b>to write: “Roundabout,” and it was necessary</b> for the verse <b>to write: “Square,” as, had the Merciful One written</b> only: <b>“Roundabout,” I would say that</b> the altar <b>can be circular.</b> Therefore, <b>the Merciful One wrote</b> that the altar must be <b>“square.” And had the Merciful One written</b> only that the altar must be <b>“square [<i>ravua</i>],” I would say that</b> the word <i>ravua</i> simply means rectangular and the altar can be <b>long and narrow.</b> Therefore, <b>the Merciful One wrote</b> the term <b>“roundabout,”</b> which teaches that the altar must not have some sides that are longer than others.",
            "§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Middot</i> 37b): <b>The ramp and the altar</b> together were <b>sixty-two</b> cubits long. The Gemara challenges: The dimensions of <b>these are sixty-four</b> cubits, as the altar and the ramp were each thirty-two cubits long (<i>Middot</i> 36a). The Gemara explains: The thirty-two-cubit measurement of the ramp is explained by a <i>baraita</i> that states: It <b>is found</b> that the ramp of the altar <b>overhung</b> the <b>base</b> of the altar by one <b>cubit and</b> the <b>surrounding ledge</b> by one <b>cubit,</b> resulting in an aggregate length of thirty-two cubits."

The term “from there” indicates that the handful must be taken <b>from a place where the feet of the non-priest</b> who brought the meal offering may <b>stand,</b> i.e., the Temple courtyard, but not the Sanctuary, in direct contradiction to the opinion of Rabbi Elazar.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Ben Beteira says</b> there is a different explanation of the verse. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> the priest <b>removed a handful with</b> his <b>left</b> hand, <b>that he should return</b> the handful to the vessel <b>and</b> then <b>remove</b> another <b>handful with</b> his <b>right</b> hand? <b>The verse states:</b> “And he shall take <b>from there</b> his handful,” indicating that he may take it <b>from the place where he already removed a handful.</b>",

            "The Gemara responds: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a burnt offering?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> it is <b>completely</b> burned upon the altar.

            "The Gemara presents a different answer: <b>Rather, it was necessary</b> for the <i>baraita</i> to teach that the handful may be taken from the meal offering anywhere in the Temple courtyard because it may <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it is written: “And he shall bring it to the altar”</b> (Leviticus 2:8), and then it states: <b>“And he shall take up from there his handful”</b> (Leviticus 6:8), indicating that the handful must be taken from the vessel in which the meal offering was brought near the altar, that the verses also indicate that the handful must be taken in the place where the vessel is brought near the altar.",

            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beteira says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that if gentiles surrounded the entire</b> Temple <b>courtyard</b> and were attacking, making it impossible for the priests to remain there, <b>the priests may enter that area,</b> i.e., the Sanctuary, <b>and eat the offerings of the most sacred order there?

            "The Gemara notes: <b>We learn</b> in this mishna <b>that which the Sages taught</b> explicitly in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a bird sin offering: If the priest <b>pinched its</b> nape <b>in any place on the altar,</b> it is <b>valid.</b> If <b>he sprinkled its blood in any place</b> on the altar, it is <b>valid.</b> If <b>he sprinkled</b> the blood, <b>but did not squeeze out</b> the remaining blood upon the lower part of the wall of the altar, in accordance with the verse: “And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offer-ing upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be squeezed out at the base of the altar” (Leviticus 5:9), it is nevertheless <b>valid, provided that he places</b> some <b>of the blood of the soul</b> anywhere on the altar <b>from the red line and below.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>saying?</b> It first states that the offering is valid no matter where on the altar its blood is sprinkled, and it then states that blood must be placed specifically below the red line. The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> If <b>he pinched its</b> nape <b>in any place on the altar,</b> it is <b>valid.</b> If <b>he squeezed out its blood in any place on the altar,</b> it is <b>valid,</b>"

            "§ The mishna teaches that there were <b>three matters</b> for which the portion of the southwest corner below the red line served as the proper location: The sacrificing of a bird sin offering, and the bringing of the meal offerings near the altar, and pouring the remaining blood. The Gemara cites sources to prove that each of these three matters was performed at the southwest corner: The source with regard to <b>the bird sin offering</b> is <b>that which we said</b> earlier (63b), that it is derived from a comparison to meal offerings.",
            "The source for <b>bringing</b> meal offerings <b>near</b> the altar at the southwest corner is derived from that <b>which is written: “And he shall bring it to the front of the altar.”</b> The source for pouring <b>the remaining blood</b> at the southwest corner of the altar is <b>as it is written: “And all the remaining blood of the bull he shall pour out at the base of the altar”</b> (Leviticus 4:7), which the Gemara derives to be referring to the southwest corner (see 53a).",

The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> the sacrificial rites of a bird burnt offering were ideally supposed to be performed at the southeast corner of the altar? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Because it is the closest</b> of all the corners <b>to the place of the ashes,</b> i.e., the place where the ashes from the altar are placed every morning. The crop and feathers of a bird burnt offering are placed there as well.",
            "The Gemara cites a comment pertaining to the mishna’s statement that when the southeast corner of the altar is too crowded, the sacrificial rites of a bird burnt offering can be performed at the southwest corner: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Come and see how great</b> was <b>the strength of the priests, as you have no</b> parts <b>of birds lighter than the crop and feathers,</b> and there were <b>times when the priest would toss them more than thirty cubits</b> from the southwest corner of the altar to the place of the ashes.",
            "This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Tamid</i> 28b) describing the procedure of separating the ashes: The priest <b>would take a coal pan of silver and ascend to the top of the altar and clear the</b> upper layer of <b>coals to</b> this <b>side and to</b> that <b>side, and,</b> using the coal pan, <b>scoop up</b> coals <b>from</b> among <b>the inner, consumed</b> coals <b>and descend</b> the ramp.

            "The Gemara challenges: The distance from the southwest corner to the location described in that mishna <b>is more than thirty-one cubits.</b> The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>did not consider the space</b> taken up by <b>people,</b> i.e., the priest performing the service, in his calculation.",
            "§ The mishna teaches that <b>everyone who ascends</b> the ramp <b>to the altar</b> ascends via the right side of the ramp, circles the altar until reaching the southwest corner, and descends via the left side of the ramp, with the exception of one ascending in order to perform the wine or water libations, or to sacrifice a bird burnt offering on the southwest corner of the altar. In those cases the priest would ascend directly to the southwest corner. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for these exceptions to the standard practice? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to the <b>libations,</b> the priest would not walk all the way around the altar <b>lest</b> the wine or water <b>absorb</b> the <b>smoke</b> of the altar fire. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>a bird burnt offering</b> he would not walk all the way around <b>lest</b> the bird <b>die from</b> inhaling <b>the smoke.</b>",
            "The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from the following mishna (<i>Tamid</i> 33b): If the High Priest was performing the sacrificial rites of the daily offering, after he would place the limbs on the fire on top of the altar and <b>he would come to circle the altar, from where does he start</b> walking? He starts <b>from</b> the <b>southeast corner,</b> continues to the <b>northeast</b> corner, then to the <b>northwest</b> corner, and finally arrives at the <b>southwest</b> corner. <b>And he is given wine to pour</b> on the altar.

            "<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The two cases are different. <b>Granted,</b> Rabbi Yehoshua’s principle applies to <b>a bird burnt offering that one sacrificed below</b> the red line <b>according to the procedure of a sin offering</b> and <b>for the sake of a sin offering.

            "The Gemara answers: The red <b>heifer is different, as it</b> has the halakhic status of an item <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance</b> rather than for sacrifice on the altar. Therefore, its slaughter cannot teach the <i>halakha</i> concerning an actual offering.",

A <i>tereifa</i> is an animal with a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months. It is derived from this verse that <b>just as</b> having the status of <b>a <i>tereifa</i> does not render permitted</b> any <b>forbidden</b> bird, <b>so too, any</b> type of death <b>that does not render permitted</b> any <b>forbidden</b> bird renders the animal a carcass with regard to ritual impurity.",

            "§ The mishna listed various categories of prohibited animals: <b>An animal that copulated with a person, or an animal that was the object of bestiality,</b> an animal that was set aside for idol worship or one that was worshipped as a deity, an animal that was given as payment to a prostitute or as the price of a dog, or an animal born of a mixture of diverse kinds, or an animal that is a <i>tereifa</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> with regard to <b>all of</b> the other examples in this list, the prohibited animal is <b>not known.</b> In other words, it is physically indistinguishable from the other animals. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>this <i>tereifa</i></b> animal, <b>what are the circumstances? If,</b> due to its physical impairment, it is <b>known to him</b> which animal it is, <b>let him come and take it</b> from there, and all the other animals will be permitted. <b>If it is not known to him, how does he know that</b> a <i>tereifa</i> animal <b>was intermingled</b> with others in the first place?",
            "<b>They say</b> in <b>the school of Rabbi Yannai: What are we dealing with here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> an animal that was <b>pierced by a thorn,</b> which does not render it a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>was intermingled with</b> an animal that was <b>clawed by a wolf,</b> which renders it a <i>tereifa</i>. Since the skin of both animals has been pierced, one cannot identify the <i>tereifa</i>.",
            "<b>Reish Lakish says</b> there is a different answer: The mishna is discussing a case <b>where</b> a healthy animal <b>was intermingled with a fallen</b> animal, i.e., one that has fallen from a great height. A fallen animal is prohibited in case it is a <i>tereifa</i>, despite the fact that it bears no external sign of injury. The Gemara raises a difficulty: With regard to <b>a fallen</b> animal <b>as well, let us examine it</b> and see if it can walk by itself, in which case it is not a <i>tereifa</i>. The Gemara answers: According to the opinion of Reish Lakish, even after an examination of this kind it is still a possible <i>tereifa</i>, which is prohibited to be sacrificed upon the altar, as <b>he holds</b> that if an animal fell and <b>stood</b> up again, <b>it requires</b> a twenty-four-hour waiting <b>period</b> to determine if it is in fact injured. Furthermore, even if it both stood up and <b>walked</b> after the fall, <b>it requires inspection</b> after slaughter to determine whether it was injured by the fall and rendered a <i>tereifa</i>.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yirmeya says</b> there is a third answer: The mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> a healthy animal <b>was intermingled with the offspring of a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> which of course bears no sign of a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>And</b> this <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who says: The offspring of a <i>tereifa</i> may not be sacrificed upon the altar.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains why each of these Sages suggests a different interpretation of the mishna: <b>All of them,</b> i.e., Reish Lakish and Rabbi Yirmeya, <b>do not say</b> that the explanation of the mishna is <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Rabbi Yannai</b> that an animal pierced by a thorn became mixed up with one clawed by a wolf, as they maintain that the difference <b>between</b> an animal <b>pierced by a thorn and</b> one that was <b>clawed by a wolf is known,</b> as <b>this</b> perforation caused by a wolf is <b>elongated, and that</b> perforation caused by a thorn is <b>round.</b>",
            "The Gemara continues: Rabbi Yannai and Rabbi Yirmeya <b>do not say</b> that the explanation of the mishna is <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Reish Lakish,</b> that the mishna is discussing a case where a healthy animal became intermingled with one that has fallen, as <b>they hold</b> that if a fallen animal <b>stood,</b> it <b>does not require</b> a twenty-four-hour waiting <b>period,</b> and if it <b>walked it does not require</b> any further <b>inspection</b> after slaughter at all. Consequently, one can simply examine the animals to see if they can walk, and if they can, they are fit.",
            "Finally, Rabbi Yannai and Reish Lakish <b>do not say</b> that the explana-tion of the mishna is <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Rabbi Yirmeya,</b> that the mishna is discussing a case where a healthy animal became intermingled with the offspring of a <i>tereifa</i>, as they <b>do not</b> want to <b>interpret</b> the mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> because the <i>halakha</i> does not follow his ruling.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: In a case where <b>sacrificial</b> animals were intermingled <b>with</b> other <b>sacrificial</b> animals, if it was an animal of one <b>type</b> of offering <b>with</b> animals of the same <b>type</b> of offering, one should sacrifice this animal for the sake of whoever is its owner and one should sacrifice that animal for the sake of whoever is its owner, and both owners fulfill their obligations. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> each animal <b>requires placing hands</b> on its head, a rite that must be performed by its owner, and in this case the owner is unknown.",
            "<b>Rav Yosef says:</b> The <i>halakha</i> of the mishna is stated <b>with regard to an offering of women,</b> who do not perform the placing of hands.

            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that he places from the blood of each of the offerings <i>ab initio</i>, <b>said?</b> In a case <b>where</b> the offerings <b>were intermingled</b> when they were still <b>alive,</b> before they were sacrificed, and therefore the priest could perform four placements from the blood of each animal separately. <b>But</b> if <b>slaughtered</b> animals <b>were</b> then <b>intermingled,</b> i.e., their blood became mixed together in one container, the priest <b>places four placements from all of them</b> together, only one set of four.",
            "<b>And</b> in any case, <b>if he placed one placement from all of them,</b> he has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation, as the blood of all these offerings is placed on the outer altar, and with regard to all of them one fulfills the obligation after the fact with a single placement. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: One assesses the</b> blood of the <b>placement</b> given from each animal; <b>if there is enough in</b> that blood for a placement of blood <b>for this</b> offering <b>and enough for that</b> one, it is <b>fit, but if not,</b> the offering is <b>disqualified.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains the difficulty: This <i>baraita</i> indicates that if live offerings became intermingled, each is sacrificed for its owner, despite the fact that these offerings are owned by men and therefore require placing of the hands. It is evident that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to offerings of men, as it <b>teaches</b> the case of the offering of <b>an individual</b> adjacent to, and therefore <b>similar to,</b> the case of <b>a communal</b> offering: <b>Just as a communal</b> offering is sacrificed by <b>men, so too,</b> the offering of <b>an individual</b> that is being discussed here also belongs to <b>men.</b> This presents a difficulty to the explanation of Rav Yosef.",

Conversely, <b>here,</b> with regard to one who vows to give the value of a firstborn to the Temple, there are <b>two sanctities,</b> a firstborn offering and the Temple maintenance, <b>but</b> they are both found in <b>one body.</b> In this case, as the sanctity of the Temple maintenance itself is in the firstborn offering, it may be weighed by the <i>litra</i>, because of the profit the Temple will gain.",
            "<b>Rav Yosei bar Avin objects to this: What</b> would be the <i>halakha</i> <b>if one says: Redeem for me,</b> i.e., I wish to redeem, <b>a firstborn</b> offering <b>that he</b> had previously <b>dedicated</b> as the object of his vow <b>to the Temple maintenance?

Similarly, the fact that he dedicated the value of the firstborn offering to the Temple should not negate the prohibition of weighing it by the <i>litra</i>. The Gemara questions this comparison: One cannot raise a difficulty from a case where someone says: <b>Redeem</b> the firstborn offering for me, as <b>the Merciful One states</b> with regard to a firstborn offering: “But the firstborn of a bull, or the firstborn of a sheep, or the firstborn of a goat, <b>you shall not redeem;</b> they are sacred” (Numbers 18:17). But the weighing of the offering by the <i>litra</i> is not prohibited by Torah law.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara suggests a different resolution of Rami bar Ḥama’s dilemma: <b>Rabbi Ami says: Can this</b> priest <b>transfer</b> to the Temple maintenance anything <b>other than that which was transferred to him?</b> In other words, just as the priest who took the vow may not weigh the firstborn by the <i>litra</i> and gain a profit, the same applies to the Temple treasury, the recipient of his vow.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: All offerings <b>can become</b> indistinguishably <b>intermingled</b> with each other, except for a sin offering and a guilt offering. The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>a sin offering and a guilt offering,</b> that they cannot become intermingled?

            "The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>A sin offering and a burnt offering</b> are <b>also</b> like this, as a sin offering is always female while a burnt offering is always male. The Gemara answers that although the standard sin offering is always female, <b>there is</b> the <b>goat</b> of the <b><i>Nasi</i>,</b> which is a male sin offering, and therefore it can become intermingled with a male goat burnt offering. And as to the statement of the mishna that a sin offering cannot become intermingled with a guilt offering despite the male sin offering of the <i>Nasi</i>, that is because <b>this</b> goat has straight <b>hair and that</b> guilt offering comes only from sheep or rams, which have <b>wool,</b> and the wool is curly.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>A Paschal offering and a guilt offering also cannot become intermingled,</b> as <b>this</b> Paschal offering is <b>in its first year, and that</b> guilt offering is <b>in its second year.</b> The Gemara answers that <b>there is the guilt offering of a nazirite and the guilt offering of a leper,</b> which must be in their first year. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that an animal in its first year can become intermingled with an animal in its second year, as <b>there is</b> an animal <b>in its first year that looks like</b> an animal <b>in its second year, and</b> likewise <b>there is</b> an animal <b>in its second year that looks like</b> an animal <b>in its first year.</b>",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> this <i>halakha</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the foods <b>have</b> already <b>become intermingled, what is the reason of the Rabbis</b> for prohibiting one to cook them together? The Gemara answers: This is <b>just as it is</b> in the case of the mishna <b>with regard to a guilt offering and a peace offering</b> that became intermingled, that even after the offerings are intermingled, one may not bring the flesh of the peace offering to the status of unfitness.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Are</b> these two cases <b>comparable?

By contrast, in <b>this</b> case of <i>teruma</i> oil mixed with vegetables of the Sabbatical Year, the situation <b>has no remedy</b> similar to that <b>of</b> having the offerings <b>graze,</b> and therefore if the Rabbis prohibited the mixture the <i>teruma</i> would go to waste.",
            "If one wishes to compare this case of oil and vegetables to an intermingling of sacrificial animals, <b>this is comparable only to</b> the other <i>halakha</i> of the mishna, which addresses <b>a piece</b> of the flesh of an offering of the most sacred order <b>that</b> was intermingled <b>with pieces</b> of the flesh of offerings of lesser sanctity.

            "<b>Ravina objects to this</b> comparison: <b>Are</b> these cases <b>comparable?</b> In the case of the <b>piece</b> of sacrificial flesh <b>that</b> is intermingled <b>with the</b> other <b>pieces, it has no remedy at all,</b> whereas <b>this</b> case of <i>teruma</i> oil <b>has a remedy through squeezing</b> the oil from the vegetables. If so, this case of vegetables is in fact comparable to that of an intermingling of a guilt offering and peace offering, which also have a means of remedy, and for this reason the Rabbis prohibited the mixture.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how would <b>Rav Yosef</b> respond to the claim that the Rabbis prohibit this mixture after the fact because there is a remedy available through squeezing it? The Gemara explains that Rav Yosef would respond that squeezing is not in fact a remedy, as <b>how can one squeeze</b> it? If <b>one squeezes</b> the vegetables <b>a lot,</b> he thereby <b>causes a loss of Sabbatical</b> Year produce; if <b>one squeezes</b> the vegetables <b>a little, ultimately</b> the <i>teruma</i> oil and vegetables of the Sabbatical Year <b>will</b> still <b>be intermingled,</b> as this squeezing will be ineffective. If so, Rav Yosef’s contention that in this case the Rabbis would not have prohibited cooking vegetables of the Sabbatical Year in <i>teruma</i> oil remains valid. Consequently, this must be referring to a case where the vegetables and oil have not yet become mixed, which means that this case does prove that Rabbi Shimon permits one to bring sacrificial animals to the status of unfitness <i>ab initio</i>, not only after the fact, as claimed by Rabba.",
            "Rav Yosef <b>raised an objection to</b> the opinion of Rabba from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Nazir</i> 6:1): How should one whose status as a confirmed leper has not been determined bring his guilt offering and <i>log</i> of oil on the eighth day of his purification? <b>Rabbi Shimon says: On the following day,</b> after his seven days of purification, <b>he brings his guilt offering and his <i>log</i></b> of oil <b>with it, and says</b> the following stipulation: <b>If this</b> offering is one <b>of a leper,</b> i.e., if I am a confirmed leper, <b>this is his,</b> i.e., my, <b>guilt offering and that is his <i>log</i></b> of oil."

            "<b>And if</b> he is <b>not</b> a leper, <b>this</b> animal that is brought for <b>a guilt offering</b> shall be <b>a voluntary peace offering,</b> because their sacrificial rites are equivalent. <b>And that</b> uncertain <b>guilt offering requires slaughter in the north</b> of the Temple courtyard as a guilt offering, <b>and placement</b> of the blood on the right <b>thumb</b> and <b>big toe</b> and right ear of the leper, as described in Leviticus 14:14, <b>and</b> it requires <b>placing hands</b> on the head of the animal, <b>and</b> the accompanying wine <b>libations and waving of</b> the <b>breast and thigh</b> like a peace offering.",

This indicates that Rabbi Shimon permits one to bring sacrificial animals to the status of unfitness even <i>ab initio</i>, not only when the animals became intermingled. The Gemara answers that <b>the remedy of a man is different</b> from the case discussed by Rabba. Since this person has no way of purifying himself from his leprosy other than by bringing the offering, the concern of reducing the time available for its consumption is disregarded.",
            "The Gemara asks a question with regard to the resolution suggested by Rabbi Shimon of bringing the offerings and stating a stipulation. This <b>works out well</b> with regard to the <b>guilt offering,</b> but with regard to the <b><i>log</i></b> of oil <b>what can be said?</b> A <i>log</i> of oil does not accompany a peace offering. The Gemara explains <b>that</b> the individual bringing the offering <b>says:</b> If I am not a leper, then <b>this <i>log</i> shall be a gift</b> to the Temple, as one can dedicate oil to the Temple. The Gemara questions this resolution: <b>But perhaps he is not</b> in fact <b>a leper, and</b> if so, it is <b>required</b> that a priest <b>remove a handful</b> of the donated oil and sacrifice a handful of it on the altar before the rest of the oil may be consumed by the priests, as is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to oil brought as an offering. The Gemara explains that this is referring to a case <b>where</b> the priest already <b>removed a handful.</b>",
            "The Gemara further questions: <b>But perhaps he is</b> in fact <b>a leper, and he requires the placement of seven</b> sprinklings of oil before the Lord (see Leviticus 14:15–16). The Gemara answers <b>that</b> the priest does <b>place</b> these sprinklings.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: How can the priest sprinkle the oil? <b>But it is lacking,</b> as a handful has been removed from the oil, and one sprinkles only from a whole <i>log</i>. The Gemara explains <b>that</b> after the handful is removed the priest <b>brings a little</b> more oil to the container <b>and fills it</b> up to a <i>log</i>. This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nega’im</i> 14:10): In a case where <b>the <i>log</i> lacked</b> a full measure, then <b>if</b> it became lacking <b>before</b> the priest <b>poured</b> from it into his palm in order to place it on the right thumb and big toe of the leper, <b>he shall fill it.</b>",
            "The Gemara poses yet another question: <b>But</b> if he is not a leper, and that <i>log</i> of oil is a gift, that handful removed from the oil <b>requires burning</b> on the altar for the remainder of the oil to be permitted to the priests. The Gemara explains <b>that</b> the priest does in fact <b>burn</b> the handful.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>When</b> does the priest burn the handful? <b>If</b> he does so <b>after the placement of seven</b> sprinklings for the leper’s purification, in such a case the <i>log</i> will be lacking due to the sprinklings. That which remains <b>is</b> akin to the <b>remainder</b> of a meal offering <b>that was lacking between</b> the <b>removal of</b> the <b>handful and</b> the <b>burning, and one may not burn the handful for that</b> remainder. Similar to a gift of oil, in a meal offering a handful is removed from the offering and then sacrificed on the altar.

This teaches that <b>it is</b> only if there is <b>a blemish</b> clearly <b>in them that they shall not be accepted; but</b> if they were sacrificed <b>by means of a mixture they shall be accepted.</b> This exclusion is stated only with regard to blemished animals, not with regard to animals that copulated with people, and consequently the limbs of these animals are not brought up to the altar even if they became intermingled with the limbs of fit offerings.",

            "<b>this</b> statement, that the water of purification is nullified in a majority of water, is <b>his,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yehuda’s, own opinion, whereas <b>that</b> statement, in the <i>baraita</i>, that white wine is not nullified in a majority of water, is <b>his teacher’s</b> ruling, i.e., that of Rabban Gamliel, who is stringent with regard to a mixture of a substance in contact with the same type of substance. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabban Gamliel: Blood does not nullify blood, spittle does not nullify spittle, and urine does not nullify urine.</b>",
            "<b>Rava says</b> there is a different resolution of the apparent contradiction between the mishna that states that water of purification is nullified in a majority of water of a ritual bath and Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion in the <i>baraita</i> with regard to white wine mixed with water: In the mishna, <b>we are dealing with a bucket whose internal</b> surface is <b>ritually pure, and</b> only <b>its external</b> surface is <b>impure.</b> The significance of this is <b>that by</b> Torah <b>law it suffices for</b> the water of the ritual bath to enter the bucket <b>in any amount</b> to purify its external surface, and therefore the water of purification in the bucket does not prevent the purification of the bucket at all.",
            "Rava continues: <b>And it is the Sages who decreed with regard to</b> this case that the internal surface must be purified as well, <b>lest</b> the owner wish to <b>spare</b> the water of purification <b>and not</b> to <b>nullify</b> it from its sanctity. In that case he would wish to avoid allowing water from the ritual bath to enter the vessel, and might immerse it in a manner which would not allow even the full external surface to come in contact with the water. Therefore, the Sages required that one immerse the entire vessel. <b>But once there is a majority</b> of water in the bucket from the ritual bath, he does <b>not need</b> to enable any more water to enter the vessel, as by Torah law it is already pure.",
            "§ <b>Rava says,</b> in summary of these <i>halakhot</i>: <b>The Sages said that</b> the status of an item in a mixture is determined <b>by the taste,</b> i.e., if the taste of one substance is noticeable in a mixture with another substance it is not nullified, <b>and the Sages said</b> that a prohibited item is nullified <b>by the majority, and the Sages</b> also <b>said</b> that the status of an item in a mixture is determined <b>by the appearance,</b> i.e., if the appearance of a substance is recognizable in a mixture it is not nullified. Rava elaborates: With regard to <b>a type</b> of food mixed <b>with</b> food <b>not</b> of <b>its</b> own <b>type,</b> the nullification is determined <b>by the taste.</b> In the case of <b>a type</b> of food mixed <b>with</b> food of <b>its</b> own <b>type,</b> the nullification is determined <b>by the majority.</b> In a case <b>where there is</b> a possibility to determine the status of an item based on <b>appearance,</b> the nullification is <b>by appearance.</b>",
            "§ The Gemara returns to its discussion of the opinion of Reish Lakish that prohibited items, such as <i>piggul</i>, <i>notar</i>, and ritually impure meat, nullify one another. The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> Reish Lakish <b>disagrees</b> with the statement <b>of Rabbi Elazar, as Rabbi Elazar says: Just as</b> items used in the performance of <b>mitzvot do not nullify one another,</b> despite the fact that one is of greater volume than the other or imparts flavor to it, <b>so too,</b> items to which <b>prohibitions</b> apply <b>do not nullify one another.</b>",
            "The Gemara adds: <b>Whom did you hear who says</b> that items used in the performance of <b>mitzvot do not nullify one another? It is Hillel, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>They said about Hillel the Elder that</b> when eating the Paschal offering, <i>matza</i>, and bitter herbs on the first night of Passover, <b>he would wrap them</b> all <b>at once and eat them</b> together, <b>because it is stated</b> with regard to the Paschal offering: <b>“They shall eat it with <i>matzot</i> and bitter herbs”</b> (Numbers 9:11), which indicates that these three foods should be eaten together.

            "§ The Gemara continues its discussion of cases involving a mixture of one substance in contact with the same type of substance, in which according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda in the mishna the prohibited substance is not nullified. <b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Teharot</i> 5:3): In a case where <b>a broken earthenware</b> flask had absorbed the urine <b>of a <i>zav</i> or a <i>zava</i>,</b> whose urine is a primary source of ritual impurity, which imparts impurity to one who carries it, in such a case, if one poured water into this flask to clean it, after the <b>first time and</b> the <b>second</b> time one washed it, it remains <b>ritually impure,</b> but after the <b>third</b> time it is <b>ritually pure,</b> as the impure urine has been expelled from the flask.",

            "<b>Rav Pappa says</b> that there is a different explanation of the dispute: <b>Everyone</b> agrees that the Sages <b>issue</b> a rabbinic <b>decree</b> with regard to the Temple, and therefore in a case where blood fit for presentation was mixed with the blood of unfit offerings Rabbi Eliezer agrees that it should be poured into the Temple courtyard drain, and he deems the blood permitted only if it was mixed with blood of exudate.",
            "Rav Pappa continues: <b>And here they disagree with regard to</b> the question of whether it is <b>common for blood of exudate to be greater</b> in quantity <b>than blood of the soul,</b> i.e., the blood that emerges immediately following the slaughter of the animal.

            "The Gemara comments: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Pappa</b> that Rabbi Eliezer’s lenient ruling applies only to a mixture with blood of exudate, but that he concedes to the first <i>tanna</i> that if blood fit for presentation was mixed with the blood of unfit offerings it is poured down the Temple courtyard drain, <b>this</b> explanation is consistent with <b>that which</b> the mishna <b>teaches:</b> If blood fit for presentation <b>was mixed with the blood of unfit</b> offerings, it <b>shall be poured into the</b> Temple courtyard <b>drain;</b> if blood fit for presentation <b>was mixed with blood of exudate,</b> it <b>shall be poured into the drain.</b> In other words, the fact that the mishna separates these two cases into different clauses makes sense, as Rabbi Eliezer’s ruling applies only to one case.",

            "<b>Rav Ashi states</b> a different explanation: Rabbi Eliezer holds that <b>there is no mixing,</b> and therefore if the priest sprinkles only once there is a concern that he might not have sprinkled any water of purification at all, and therefore he <b>sprinkles two sprinklings.</b>",

The addition of “within” indicates that this sacred place is the Sanctuary, while the term “within” is referring to the Holy of Holies. The Gemara cites a similar example: This is <b>just as it is with regard to a tenant and a hired worker.</b>",
            "<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning <i>teruma</i>: The verse states: “A tenant of a priest or a hired worker shall not eat of the consecrated” (Leviticus 22:10). <b>“A tenant”; this</b> is referring to a Hebrew slave who has been <b>acquired</b> as <b>a permanent acquisition,</b> i.e., one who said he wishes to stay with his master. This slave has his ear pierced and he remains with his master until the Jubilee Year. <b>“A hired worker”; this</b> is referring to a Hebrew slave who has been <b>acquired</b> for <b>an acquisition of</b> six <b>years,</b> the standard period of servitude for a Hebrew slave.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>Let</b> the verse <b>say “tenant” and let it not say “hired worker,” and I</b> would <b>say:</b> If one who is <b>acquired</b> as <b>a permanent acquisition does not partake</b> of his master’s, i.e., the priest’s, <i>teruma</i>, as despite his status as a slave he is not considered his master’s property, is it <b>not all the more so</b> logical that one who is <b>acquired</b> for <b>an acquisition of</b> six <b>years</b> should not be permitted to partake of <i>teruma</i>?",
            "The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>If so,</b> that the verse were stated in this manner, <b>I would say: “A tenant”; this is</b> one who was <b>acquired</b> for <b>an acquisition of</b> six <b>years,</b> as the term itself is ambiguous, <b>but</b> one who was <b>acquired</b> as <b>a permanent acquisition may partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>.

            "<b>Rather, Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The proper time of the removal of the ashes is based on the following: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> it <b>is stated</b> with regard to the burning of the limbs: <b>“All night”</b> (Leviticus 6:2), <b>don’t I know that</b> he may burn a burnt offering <b>until the morning?</b> If so, <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Until the morning”?</b> It means: <b>Add</b> another <b>morning to the morning of</b> the <b>night.</b> Arise before dawn, as that is the time for the removal of the ashes. Nevertheless, there is no specific hour fixed for performing this removal, and one may remove the ashes from the beginning of the night.",
            "<b>Therefore, every day,</b> performing the removal <b>at the rooster’s crow is sufficient. On Yom Kippur, due to</b> the <b>weakness of the High Priest,</b> who must perform the entire Temple service on that day, they would hasten to remove the ashes <b>from midnight. On the Festivals,</b> during <b>which</b> there are <b>many offerings</b> on account of the masses of <b>Jewish people</b> in Jerusalem on those days, who, in order to offer their sacrifices, would <b>arrive early</b> at the Temple, they would remove the ashes beginning <b>from</b> the end of <b>the first watch, as</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> (<i>Yoma</i> 20a): <b>The call of the rooster would not arrive</b> on Festivals <b>until the Temple courtyard was filled with Jews.</b>",

            "<b>And</b> in order to fulfill that which is stated: “And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates” (Exodus 39:25), he <b>brings seventy-two bells,</b> i.e., the outer part of bells, made from gold, <b>that</b> contain <b>inside them seventy-two bell clappers, and he suspends</b> them <b>on</b> the skirts: <b>Thirty-six</b> of each, i.e., pomegranates and bells, <b>on this side</b> of the robe, <b>and thirty-six</b> of each <b>on that side,</b> as the verse states: “A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, upon the skirts of the robe around it” (Exodus 39:26). <b>Rabbi Dosa says in the name of Rabbi Yehuda: There were thirty-six</b> bells suspended around the skirt, <b>eighteen from this side and eighteen from that side.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Inini bar Sason says: Just as</b> there is <b>a disagreement here</b> between <i>tanna’im</i> with regard to the total number of bells suspended around the skirt of the robe of the High Priest, <b>so</b> is there <b>a disagreement</b> between <i>tanna’im</i> <b>with regard to</b> the total number of <b>shades of</b> leprous <b>marks.

            "§ The Gemara cites another statement of this sage: <b>And Rabbi Inini bar Sason says: Why</b> was <b>the passage</b> in the Torah that discusses <b>offerings</b> (Leviticus, chapters 1–7) <b>juxtaposed to the passage</b> that discusses the <b>priestly vestments</b> (Leviticus, chapter 8)? It was juxtaposed <b>to tell you</b> that <b>just as offerings effect atonement, so too, priestly vestments effect atonement.</b>",

The <b>ephod</b> of the High Priest <b>atones for idol worship, as it is stated:</b> “And <b>without ephod or teraphim”</b> (Hosea 3:4), meaning that when there is no ephod, the sin of teraphim, i.e., idol worship, is found. Therefore, it may be inferred that if there is an ephod, there is no sin of idol worship.",

            "The Gemara explains how Ravina bar Sheila interprets the mishna in support of his opinion: <b>Granted, there are no sacrificial portions</b> consumed on the altar <b>from a bird</b> offering, <b>but</b> its <b>blood at least is</b> sprinkled. Why, then, does the mishna mention the blood? <b>Rather, is it not</b> mentioned in order to <b>teach us</b> that the status of the <b>sacrificial portions</b> consumed on the altar from the animal tithe offering and other offerings of lesser sanctity is <b>comparable to</b> the status of <b>its blood?</b>",
            "The Gemara explains the implications of this comparison. <b>Just as its blood</b> referred to in the mishna is blood <b>before</b> its <b>sprinkling</b> on the altar, as afterward it no longer has any sanctity, <b>so too,</b> the <b>sacrificial portions</b> mentioned in the mishna are from <b>before</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood, <b>and</b> the mishna <b>calls them</b> at this stage <b>offerings of the most sacred order.

            "The Gemara attempts to prove the opinion of Ravina bar Sheila. <b>Let us say</b> that the following dispute between <i>amora’im</i> <b>supports his</b> statement: With regard to <b>flesh of offerings of lesser sanctity that left</b> the Temple courtyard <b>before the sprinkling of</b> the <b>blood, Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that it is <b>fit</b> and <b>Reish Lakish says</b> that it is <b>disqualified.</b>",
            "The Gemara clarifies this dispute: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that it is <b>fit, since it will ultimately leave</b> the Temple courtyard, as offerings of lesser sanctity may be eaten anywhere within the walls of Jerusalem. <b>Reish Lakish says</b> that it is <b>unfit,</b> as <b>its time to leave</b> the Temple courtyard <b>has not yet arrived</b> because the flesh cannot be taken out until after the sprinkling of the blood. The Gemara infers that these <i>amora’im</i> <b>disagree only with regard to</b> the <b>flesh</b> of the offering, which will eventually leave the Temple courtyard. <b>But with regard to</b> the <b>sacrificial portions</b> of the offering, which will never leave the courtyard, they do <b>not</b> disagree, as Rabbi Yoḥanan concedes that those portions are disqualified.",
            "The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>The same is true with regard to</b> the <b>sacrificial portions,</b> i.e., these <i>amora’im</i> <b>also disagree</b> in that case, as Rabbi Yoḥanan holds they are fit. <b>And</b> the reason <b>that</b> they <b>disagree</b> explicitly <b>with regard to</b> the <b>flesh is to convey to you the far-reaching nature of</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish, as even</b> with regard to the <b>flesh, which will ultimately leave</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>he says</b> that it is disqualified, because <b>its time to leave</b> the courtyard <b>has not yet arrived.</b>",

            "The Gemara responds: If the <i>baraita</i> is referring to the meal offering of a sinner, why is its precedence to the meal offering of a <i>sota</i> derived from the fact that the meal offering of a sinner comes from wheat, whereas the meal offering of a <i>sota</i> is brought from barley? <b>I</b> could <b>derive</b> the precedence of the meal offering of the sinner <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the meal offering of a sinner <b>effects atonement and</b> the meal offering of a <i>sota</i> <b>does not effect atonement.</b>",

            "§ The mishna states: The sacrifice of <b>the bird sin offering precedes</b> the sacrifice of the bird burnt offering. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara answers: This is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the bird sin offering and the bird burnt offering that a poor sinner sacrifices instead of an animal sin offering. The verse states: <b>“And he shall offer that which is for the sin offering first”</b> (Leviticus 5:8). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> this? <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> this in order <b>to teach that</b> the sin offering <b>is sacrificed first, as</b> it <b>is already stated: “And he shall prepare the second for a burnt offering”</b> (Leviticus 5:10).",
            "<b>Rather, this</b> verse <b>established a paradigm for all sin offerings,</b> teaching <b>that they should precede the burnt offering that comes with them; whether</b> in the case of <b>a bird sin offering</b> taking precedence <b>over a bird burnt offering, whether</b> in the case of <b>an animal sin offering</b> taking precedence <b>over an animal burnt offering, and even</b> with regard to <b>a bird sin offering</b> taking precedence <b>over an animal burnt offering.</b>",
            "The Gemara summarizes: <b>Therefore,</b> the precedence of <b>a bird sin offering over a bird burnt offering</b> is learned <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“And</b> he shall prepare <b>the second</b> for a burnt offering.” The precedence of <b>an animal sin offering over an animal burnt offering</b> is derived <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the Merciful One extends</b> the <i>halakha</i> derived from the sin offering of the Levites (see 89a). Finally, the precedence of <b>a bird sin offering over an animal burnt offering</b> is derived <b>from</b> the principle stated in this <i>baraita</i>, that <b>this</b> verse <b>established a paradigm</b> for all sin offerings, teaching that they should precede the burnt offering that comes with them.",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a further proof from a <i>baraita</i>. The Torah states that a woman who has given birth must bring a sheep as a burnt offering and a bird as a sin offering. If she is poor she may bring two birds: “One for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering” (Leviticus 12:8). <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> In <b>every</b> other <b>instance where</b> a bird offering <b>is exchanged</b> for an animal <b>sin offering,</b> the <b>sin offering precedes</b> the burnt offering. For example, in the case of the sliding scale sin offering brought for entering the Temple while ritually impure, where a poor person brings two birds, one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, the sin offering comes first. <b>But here, in</b> the case of <b>a woman who gave birth,</b> the <b>burnt offering takes precedence,</b> as it takes the place of an animal burnt offering, mentioned first in the verse: “She shall bring a lamb in its first year for a burnt offering, and a pigeon or a dove for a sin offering (Leviticus 12:6).",
            "Furthermore, in <b>every instance where</b> the sin offering <b>comes</b> because <b>of a sin,</b> the <b>sin offering precedes</b> the burnt offering. <b>But here,</b> in the case of a poor woman who gave birth, where the sin offering effects ritual purity rather than atonement, the <b>burnt offering precedes</b> the sin offering. <b>And</b> in <b>every instance where two</b> birds <b>come instead of</b> an animal for <b>a sin offering,</b> the <b>sin offering precedes</b> the burnt offering. <b>But here,</b> in the case of a poor woman who gave birth, the bird burnt offering replaces the animal burnt offering of a rich woman, whereas the bird sin offering is sacrificed even by a rich woman who gave birth. Therefore, in this particular case of a woman who gave birth, the <b>burnt offering precedes</b> the sin offering.",
            "The straightforward reading of this <i>baraita</i> contradicts the statement of the previous <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that a sin offering always precedes a burnt offering. In order to reconcile the two <i>baraitot</i>, <b>Rava said:</b> The fact that <b>the verse mentions</b> the animal burnt offering <b>first</b> is only <b>with regard to reading</b> it, but in practice the sin offering is sacrificed first.",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another <i>baraita</i> which apparently contradicts this principle. When there are different animal offerings to be sacrificed, <b>bulls precede rams, and rams precede sheep,</b> and <b>sheep</b> precede <b>male goats.</b>"

The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> with regard to all these animals the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to gift</b> offerings. The Gemara interprets the <i>baraita</i> in accordance with this explanation: <b>Bulls precede rams, as</b> they require <b>a greater</b> quantity <b>of libations; and likewise rams</b> precede <b>sheep</b> for the same reason. <b>Sheep</b> precede <b>male goats,</b> although their libations are identical, <b>as</b> the portions of the sheep consumed on the altar are <b>greater;</b> the sheep’s <b>tail</b> is burned, whereas the goat’s tail is not.",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i> which seems to contradict the principle that a sin offering always precedes a burnt offering: <b>The bull of</b> the <b>anointed priest,</b> i.e., the High Priest, which he sacrifices if he issues and then acts upon an erroneous halakhic ruling, <b>precedes</b> the <b>bull for an unwitting communal sin,</b> sacrificed if the Sanhedrin issues an erroneous halakhic ruling and the community then acts upon it.

This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though</b> the <b>bull</b> that atones <b>for idol worship</b> is <b>a burnt offering, and</b> the <b>male goats</b> sacrificed as atonement <b>for idol worship</b> are <b>sin offerings.</b> This <i>baraita</i> seems to contradict the statement of the previous <i>baraita</i> that a sin offering always precedes a burnt offering.",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>But</b> you can <b>say</b> that the opposite conclusion is derived <b>from the first clause</b> of that <i>baraita</i>, as at least the first clause supports the principle that sin offerings take precedence: The <b>bull for an unwitting communal sin,</b> which is a sin offering, <b>precedes</b> the <b>bull</b> sacrificed to atone <b>for</b> an unwitting communal sin involving <b>idol worship,</b> which is a burnt offering.",
            "The Gemara dismisses this answer: <b>In any event, with regard to</b> offerings that are both of <b>one species</b> of animal, <b>we did not say</b> there is any doubt <b>that a sin offering takes precedence. When we say</b> there is a contradiction between the rulings of the <i>baraitot</i>, it is <b>with regard to</b> offerings of <b>two species.</b> According to the earlier <i>baraita</i>, even a bird sin offering precedes an animal burnt offering, whereas here <b>we find a burnt offering that precedes a sin offering.</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>They say in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>in the name of Rava bar Mari:</b> The <b>sin offering</b> sacrificed to atone <b>for idol worship is</b> written <b>without an <i>alef</i></b> (see Numbers 15:24). <b>It is written <i>lamed</i>, <i>ḥet</i>, <i>tet</i>, <i>tav</i>.</b> This indicates that it is different from other sin offerings in that it does not precede the burnt offering. <b>Ravina says</b> that the term <b>“according to the ordinance” is written with regard to</b> the offerings sacrificed to atone for idol-worship, in the verse: “The congregation shall offer one young bull…according to the ordinance, and one goat for a sin offering” (Numbers 15:24). This mention of an ordinance indicates that they must be sacrificed in the precise order stated by the verse.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>Now that you have arrived at this</b> explanation, the previous <i>baraita</i> can be explained in a similar manner: <b>Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to the <b>bulls</b> and other offerings <b>of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, there is <b>also</b> no difficulty with regard to the burnt offering sheep taking precedence over the sin offering male goats, as the term <b>“according to their ordinance” is written concerning</b> these offerings as well (see Numbers 29:33).",
            "<b>A dilemma</b> ensuing from the conclusion of the previous discussion <b>was raised before</b> the Sages: If there is <b>a bird sin offering, and an animal burnt offering, and</b> an animal <b>tithe</b> offering to be sacrificed, <b>which of them precedes</b> the others?

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Here,</b> in Babylonia, <b>they explained</b> that the fact that the animal tithe offering is <b>a type of</b> offering that requires <b>slaughtering</b> is of <b>greater</b> importance than the other factors.

It means that circumcision is <b>frequent in</b> terms of the numerous <b>mitzvot</b> commanded with regard to its fulfillment. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>circumcision in relation to</b> the <b>Paschal offering is considered like a frequent</b> obligation, as it is occurs far more often, whereas peace offerings are brought only somewhat more often than sin offerings. In sum, one cannot infer from the mishna that an offering of greater sanctity precedes a frequent offering.",
            "§ An additional <b>dilemma</b> with regard to precedence <b>was raised before</b> the Sages: If the priest had two offerings to sacrifice, <b>a frequent</b> offering <b>and an infrequent</b> offering, <b>and</b> although he should have initially sacrificed the frequent offering <b>he slaughtered the infrequent</b> offering <b>first, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that <b>since</b> he already <b>slaughtered</b> the infrequent offering he also proceeds to <b>sacrifice it? Or perhaps</b> he does not yet sacrifice it but <b>gives</b> it <b>to another</b> priest, <b>who stirs its blood</b> to prevent it from congealing, <b>until</b> he <b>sacrifices</b> the <b>frequent</b> offering; <b>and then</b> he <b>sacrifices the infrequent</b> offering.",
            "<b>Rav Huna from Sura said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an answer from the mishna: If one has <b>a peace offering from yesterday</b> and <b>a sin offering or a guilt offering from today,</b> the peace offering <b>from yesterday precedes</b> the sin offering <b>from today.</b> It can be assumed that the mishna is not discussing a case where none of the offerings have been slaughtered, as the peace offering would not take precedence in this situation. Rather, it is discussing a peace offering from yesterday that was slaughtered but its blood has not yet been presented. One can infer from this that only a peace offering from yesterday takes precedence in this situation, <b>but</b> in the case of a peace offering <b>from today</b> that is <b>similar</b> in other aspects <b>to</b> a peace offering <b>from yesterday,</b> the peace offering does not take precedence.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>And what are the circumstances</b> of this case? This is a situation <b>where</b> one <b>first slaughtered the peace offering</b> from today. In this case the <b>sin offering or guilt offering takes precedence,</b> although the peace offering is already slaughtered, as both of them are of greater sanctity. The same should apply to an infrequent offering that was slaughtered before a frequent offering: The frequent offering is slaughtered before the blood of the infrequent offering is presented.",
            "The Gemara rejects this answer: <b>Perhaps</b> when the mishna makes reference to <b>a peace offering from yesterday and a sin offering or a guilt offering from today,</b> the circumstances should be understood differently. <b>How can you find these</b> other circumstances? The mishna discusses a case <b>where</b> the priest already <b>slaughtered both of them,</b> the peace offering and the sin- or guilt offering, and the blood of both awaits presentation on the altar. <b>But</b> had he <b>not</b> yet <b>slaughtered both of them,</b> but only the peace offering, <b>you</b> can still <b>raise the dilemma</b> of whether the priest should set aside the blood of the peace offering in order to slaughter the sin offering first, due to its greater sanctity.",
            "The Gemara cites another proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the aforementioned <i>baraita</i>: <b>Alternatively,</b> Beit Hillel say: With regard to the order of blessings in <i>kiddush</i>, <b>the blessing on wine</b> is recited <b>frequently and the blessing of the day is not</b> recited <b>frequently, and</b> there is a principle: When <b>a frequent</b> practice <b>and an infrequent</b> practice clash, the <b>frequent</b> practice <b>takes precedence</b> over the infrequent practice. The obligation to recite the blessing of the day is due to the sanctity of Shabbat and applies at the start of Shabbat, before wine is placed on the table. Nevertheless, the blessing on the wine takes precedence due to its frequency. So too, the slaughtering of the frequent offering should take precedence, even if the priest had already commenced the sacrificial rites of the infrequent offering.",
            "The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Here too,</b> with regard to <i>kiddush</i>, the circumstances are different, <b>since</b> wine is available when one recites <i>kiddush</i>, and therefore the obligation of both blessings <b>come</b> together. This means that it is <b>comparable to</b> a situation <b>where one</b> already <b>slaughtered both</b> animals.",
            "The Gemara cites yet another proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>a person prays the afternoon prayer and afterward the additional prayer,</b> despite the fact that the obligation of the additional prayer applies first, which is similar to an offering slaughtered first. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Here too, since the time of the afternoon prayer has</b> now <b>arrived,</b> one is obligated in both prayers, and again this is <b>comparable to</b> a situation <b>where one</b> already <b>slaughtered both</b> animals.",
            "<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ashi, said to Ravina</b> that an answer to this dilemma can be found in a mishna (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 61a): If one <b>slaughtered</b> the Paschal offering <b>before midday</b> it is <b>disqualified, because it is stated in its regard: “In the afternoon”</b> (Exodus 12:6). If he slaughtered it <b>before the daily</b> afternoon <b>offering</b> was slaughtered it is <b>valid,</b> even though the daily offering should be sacrificed first, <b>but</b> someone <b>should stir its blood</b> to prevent it from congealing <b>until</b> he slaughters and <b>sprinkles the blood</b> of the daily offering. Although the infrequent Paschal offering is already slaughtered, the priest first slaughters the frequent daily offering and then sprinkles the blood of the Paschal offering.",
            "The Gemara rejects this proof as well: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> he <b>gave precedence to the daily offering</b> and <b>slaughtered it first,</b> and then slaughtered the Paschal offering before sprinkling the blood of the daily offering. Since the blood of both offerings requires sprinkling on the altar, the blood of the daily offering takes precedence. <b>Rav Aḥa the Elder said to Rav Ashi</b> that the wording of <b>the mishna is also precise, as it teaches: Until the blood of the daily offering is sprinkled, and does not teach: Until he slaughters and sprinkles the blood.</b> This indicates that the daily afternoon offering has already been slaughtered. The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> its wording that this is the meaning of the mishna.",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if the exclusion of bird offerings is derived from this verse, then <b>why do I</b> need the derivation from the verse: <b>“This</b> is the law of the sin offering”? The Gemara answers: <b>If not</b> for the derivation from <b>“this,” I would say</b> that the term <b>“shall eat it”</b> is simply <b>the manner</b> of speech <b>of the verse,</b> so that it does not indicate any exclusion. Therefore, the word “this” <b>teaches us</b> that a sin offering is excluded, and the term “shall eat it,” demonstrates that the excluded sin offering is one that is eaten.",
            "<b>Rabba said</b> that there is a different explanation. Internal sin offerings cannot be excluded from the requirement of laundering sprayed garments, as the verse speaks specifically of internal sin offerings, as <b>the verse states: “It shall be sprinkled”</b> (Leviticus 6:20). <b>The verse is speaking of</b> sin offerings that require <b>sprinklings,</b> and sprinkling is mentioned specifically with regard to internal sin offerings (see Leviticus 4:6), unlike eaten animal sin offerings, with regard to which the Torah uses a term of placing to describe the presenting of its blood (see Leviticus 4:25).",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: Can one say that the passage about laundering applies specifically to internal sin offerings? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in the mishna: <b>Although the verse is speaking only of</b> sin offerings <b>that are eaten,</b> indicating that the passage certainly applies to sin offerings that are eaten? The Gemara answers: The mishna’s statement pertains <b>to the matter of scouring and rinsing</b> copper vessels in which a sin offering was cooked (see Leviticus 6:21), which is relevant only to sin offerings that are eaten. <b>But in the matter of laundering:</b> “You shall launder that on which <b>it shall be sprinkled”</b> (Leviticus 6:20) <b>is written,</b> and the term “it shall be sprinkled” indicates only internal sin offerings. By contrast, eaten sin offerings are included only through the amplification in the verse: “The law of the sin offering” (Leviticus 6:18).",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> that the verses prescribing laundering are primarily discussing internal sin offerings, and eaten sin offerings are included only through a derivation, then with regard to the statement in the mishna: <b>Both</b> the sin offerings <b>that are eaten and the internal</b> sin offerings, is this statement not misleading? Rather, the <i>tanna</i> <b>should have</b> stated: <b>Both the internal</b> sin offerings <b>and</b> the sin offerings <b>that are eaten,</b> first mentioning the offerings most clearly indicated in the verse. The Gemara answers: <b>Teach</b> it as: <b>Both the internal</b> sin offerings <b>and the</b> sin offerings <b>that are eaten.</b>",
            "<b>If so,</b> that the requirement of laundering applies to those sin offerings with regard to which the Torah uses the term sprinkling, the blood of <b>a bird sin offering</b> should require laundering <b>as well,</b> as sprinkling is also mentioned with regard to it (see Leviticus 5:9). The Gemara answers: <b>The Merciful One excludes</b> bird offerings by stating: <b>“This</b> is the law of the sin offering.” The Gemara challenges: <b>If so,</b> that the function of this verse is to be understood as a restriction, <b>an external</b> sin offering <b>also</b> should <b>not</b> require laundering. The Gemara responds: <b>The Merciful One amplified</b> the <i>halakha</i> to include external sin offerings by stating: <b>“The law of.”</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And what did you see</b> that convinced you to exclude bird offerings and include external sin offerings? The Gemara answers: <b>It stands to reason</b> that the eaten <b>animal sin offering should have been included, as</b> the eaten animal sin offering resembles the internal sin offering in several respects: Each is a large <b>animal;</b> each is subject to <b>slaughter on the north</b> side of the courtyard; <b>and</b> the blood of each requires <b>collection in a vessel; and</b> their blood is placed on the <b>corner</b> of the altar; <b>and</b> the blood is placed with a priest’s <b>finger; and</b> the blood is placed on <b>the edge of</b> the corner of the altar; <b>and</b> parts of each are consumed in <b>flames</b> upon the altar. None of these apply to bird sin offerings.",
            "The Gemara raises an objection: <b>On the contrary,</b> the <b>bird sin offering should have been included</b> in the requirement for laundering, <b>as</b> the offering of the blood of the bird sin offering is termed <b>sprinkling,</b> just <b>like it</b> is in the case of the internal sin offering. The Gemara answers: <b>Those</b> features common to internal sin offerings and eaten animal sin offerings <b>are more numerous</b> than the features common to internal sin offerings and bird sin offerings.",
            "§ The Gemara indicated that the blood of the bird sin offering is not received in a vessel, unlike that of animal sin offerings. With regard to this <i>halakha</i>, <b>Rabbi Avin asks:</b> When the blood of an eaten animal sin offering is brought into the Sanctuary in a vessel, this disqualifies it. In the case of <b>a bird sin offering,</b> which is killed by pinching the nape of its neck, <b>whose blood</b> a priest <b>brought inside</b> the Sanctuary <b>in its neck, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is <b>its neck comparable to a service vessel,</b> since it is from its neck that the blood is presented, <b>and</b> therefore it is <b>disqualified</b> if brought into the Sanctuary this way?",
            "<b>Or perhaps</b> is its neck <b>comparable to the neck of</b> a large <b>animal</b> offering, about which <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“Of whose blood</b> is brought into the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 6:23), which teaches that its blood is disqualified when brought inside in a service vessel, <b>but</b> the blood is <b>not</b> disqualified when the animal’s <b>flesh</b> is brought inside. What is the status of the bird’s neck? The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: If, after its nape is pinched, a bird sin offering <b>convulsed and</b> consequently <b>entered inside</b> the Sanctuary <b>and</b> then it <b>returned</b> to the courtyard, it remains <b>valid;</b> its blood may be sprinkled and its meat eaten. It can be inferred that the bird offering remains valid if it has entered on its own, <b>but</b> if a priest has <b>brought it in,</b> it is <b>disqualified</b> because of the blood in its neck.",
            "The Gemara rejects the proof: <b>But according to your reasoning,</b> one might draw a faulty inference from the <i>halakha</i> of a convulsing offering, as follows. <b>With regard to</b> an animal <b>offering of the most sacred order,</b> about <b>which it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If, after being slaughtered appropriately on the north side of the courtyard, the animal <b>convulsed, and</b> consequently it <b>went out to the south</b> side of the courtyard <b>and</b> then <b>returned</b> to the north side, it remains <b>valid;</b> should it be inferred: <b>But</b> if a priest <b>took it out</b> to the south side it becomes <b>disqualified?</b> The sacrifice is certainly not disqualified by being taken to the south side of the courtyard, and the inference is incorrect.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> it must be assumed that <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i>, that of the convulsing animal that moved from the northern side to the southern side, is taught for another purpose. It <b>was necessary for</b> the <i>baraita</i> to teach this <i>halakha</i> in order to establish a contrast with an animal that <b>went out to the outside</b> beyond the courtyard, which is disqualified even if it goes out by itself. <b>Here, too,</b> with regard to the bird sin offering, the <i>halakha</i> of the convulsing animal that moved into the Sanctuary is taught for another purpose. This <i>halakha</i> <b>was necessary for</b> establishing a contrast with a bird offering that <b>went out to the outside</b> beyond the courtyard, which is disqualified even if it goes out by itself. Accordingly, this may not be used to resolve Rabbi Avin’s dilemma.",
            "§ <b>Rabbi Avin asks</b> another question about the blood of a bird offering, which is sprinkled directly from the body of the bird and not collected in a service vessel. With regard to the blood of a large animal, which spills on the floor before it is received in a service vessel, it becomes disqualified for presentation (see 25a), but if it spills after it is received in a vessel, it may be collected from the floor and presented (see 32a). If the blood of a bird offering <b>spilled onto the floor and</b> the priest <b>collected it</b> from the floor in order to sprinkle it, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?",
            "Is it simply that <b>the Merciful One did not require a service vessel</b> for the collection of the bird’s blood, <b>and therefore</b> a priest <b>may collect it</b> from the floor <b>and</b> it remains <b>fit</b> for sprinkling on the altar? <b>Or perhaps the Merciful One rendered a service vessel unfit for</b> sprinkling <b>it</b> in any case, and the blood must be sprinkled directly from the bird’s body, <b>and therefore,</b> if it spills on the floor and the priest <b>collects it,</b> it is <b>unfit</b> for sprinkling.",
            "<b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof, deduced from a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>the blood of a bird sin offering would require laundering</b> if sprayed on a garment. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “This</b> is the law of the sin offering” (Leviticus 6:18), which excludes the bird sin offering. <b>But if it enters your mind</b> that <b>the Merciful One rendered</b> a vessel <b>unfit for</b> sprinkling the blood of a bird, this interpretation is unnecessary. <b>I will deduce</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a bird’s blood does not require laundering <b>because</b> the blood <b>becomes disqualified</b> even by merely passing <b>into the airspace of a vessel.</b> Consequently, the blood is disqualified when coming into the airspace of the garment, which is considered a vessel, and, as disqualified blood, it does not subsequently require laundering.",
            "<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> provides no decisive proof, as even if a bird’s blood is disqualified by passing into the airspace of a vessel, the word “this” must still be interpreted to exclude the blood of a bird sin offering from the requirement of laundering. The interpretation of the verse accounts for cases in which the blood reaches the vessel without first passing into its airspace, as <b>in</b> a case when the priest <b>affixes a vessel to</b> the bird’s <b>neck.</b> Consequently, no resolution can be derived for Rav Avin’s question.",
            "§ The Gemara returns to the primary subject of the mishna, the requirement of laundering garments from the sprayed blood of a sin offering. <b>Levi asked</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: If the blood of an offering <b>sprayed from</b> one <b>garment to</b> another <b>garment, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>By</b> contact with the <b>first garment,</b> is the blood thereby <b>dismissed</b> with regard to the requirement <b>of laundering,</b> such that a subsequent garment would not require laundering? <b>Or perhaps not.</b>",
            "Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: This</b> is an excellent <b>question;</b> and the answer is: The garment <b>requires laundering whichever</b> way <b>you</b> look at it. <b>If</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that with regard to blood that sprayed onto a garment the priest <b>may collect it and</b> it is still <b>fit</b> for presentation on the altar, then <b>this</b> blood is also <b>fit.</b> Consequently, even the second garment must be laundered. <b>And if</b> you say that with regard to blood that sprayed onto a garment if <b>he collects it, it is unfit</b> for presentation, <b>I hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says:</b> If the offering <b>had a period of fitness and</b> then <b>was disqualified, its blood requires laundering.</b> Accordingly, since the blood upon the second garment was initially collected in a service vessel, it too had a period of fitness."
        ],
        [
            "§ In a related matter, <b>Rami bar Ḥama asked of Rav Ḥisda:</b> If the blood of a sin offering <b>sprayed onto a ritually impure garment,</b> so that the blood became impure and unfit for presentation, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does the garment require laundering? <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: From</b> the fact <b>that</b> Rami bar Ḥama <b>asked</b> the question in <b>this</b> manner, with regard to ritually pure blood that sprayed onto an impure garment, and not with regard to blood that was already impure that sprayed onto a garment, <b>conclude from it</b> that he holds that even if the sin offering <b>had a period of fitness and</b> then <b>was disqualified,</b> a garment onto which <b>its blood</b> sprayed <b>does not require laundering.</b>",
            "His question, therefore, is: Does <b>this statement</b> apply only when <b>one</b> event, the spraying of the blood, occurs <b>after the other</b> event, i.e., the disqualification of the blood? <b>But</b> if the spraying and the disqualification occur <b>simultaneously,</b> as in this case, perhaps the principle does <b>not</b> apply, and the garment must be laundered. <b>Or, perhaps</b> there <b>is no difference</b> whether the events occur this way or that way, and even if the offering becomes unfit only as the blood touches the garment, it still does not require laundering? Rav Ḥisda <b>said to</b> Rami bar Ḥama: The matter is subject to <b>the dispute between Rabbi Elazar and the Rabbis, in accordance with</b> the explanation <b>of Rabba, and as Abaye resolves</b> it.",
            "The Gemara elaborates: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> With regard to <b>water of purification, which</b> has been sanctified by the ashes of the red heifer, even if the water is <b>rendered impure</b> it nevertheless performs its function and <b>purifies</b> a person from the ritual impurity imparted by a corpse. This is evident <b>because</b> those performing the rite would <b>sprinkle</b> water of purification even <b>on a menstruating woman</b> who has been rendered impure by a corpse. Although her menstruation impurity renders the water of purification impure when it touches her, it is effective in removing the ritual impurity imparted by a corpse. Rabbi Elazar’s opinion is in opposition to that of the Rabbis.",
            "<b>And</b> concerning this dispute, <b>Rabba says:</b> Although it would seem that the water of purification applied to a menstruating woman does not become impure until it touches her, the case may still provide precedent for all water of purification that has become impure, as follows: <b>Rabbi Elazar stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with the opinion of his teacher Rabbi Akiva, who says</b> that <b>passing a vessel</b> containing water of purification <b>over</b> the <b>place</b> where <b>a ritually impure</b> item is renders the vessel <b>considered as</b> if <b>resting</b> there, so that the water becomes impure. Consequently, just as the water of purification is effective for the menstruating woman although it has become impure when hovering above her, water of purification always remains effective after having contracted ritual impurity.",
            "That is Rabbi Akiva’s opinion, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 10:5): There is a dispute with regard to the case of a ritually pure person who <b>was standing beyond an oven,</b> which stood between him and the wall, <b>and</b> a carcass of <b>a creeping animal,</b> which imparts impurity, was <b>in the oven; and</b> the person <b>stretched out his hand to the window and took the jug [<i>halagin</i>]</b> containing water of purification <b>and passed it over the opening of the oven. Rabbi Akiva deems</b> the water of purification <b>impure,</b> although the jug has merely passed over the oven’s opening and has not come to rest on it, <b>and the Rabbis deem</b> the water <b>pure. And</b> according to Rabba, <b>in this</b> manner <b>do they disagree: That Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that the jug is <b>considered as</b> if <b>resting</b> on the opening of the oven, <b>and the Rabbis hold</b> that the jug is <b>not considered as</b> if <b>resting</b> there.",
            "<b>And Abaye raised an objection to</b> Rabba’s interpretation from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Para</i> 10:6): Although he deems the water of purification impure in the previous case, <b>Rabbi Akiva concedes</b> that <b>in</b> the act of <b>sprinkling,</b> in <b>which</b> the person <b>passed</b> the water of purification <b>over an impure earthenware vessel</b> or <b>over</b> an impure item designated for <b>lying or sitting,</b> the water remains <b>pure.</b> This is so <b>because there is nothing that renders impure</b> all that is in the airspace directly <b>above</b> it, <b>like</b> anything <b>below</b> that touches it, <b>other than an olive-bulk from a corpse and all other</b> items which impart ritual impurity to those items <b>which overlie</b> them, <b>including a stone marked</b> with leprosy. Such a stone also imparts overlying impurity, rendering impure anything under the same roof or, if there is no roof, in the airspace directly above it up to the sky.",
            "<b>Rather, Abaye said: Everyone</b> agrees that a vessel containing water of purification passing over an item that is ritually impure <b>is not considered as</b> if it is <b>resting</b> on it. <b>And here,</b> with regard to the jug being taken over the oven, <b>they disagree about this: Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that <b>we decree</b> that the vessel contracts impurity by rabbinic law, since <b>perhaps</b> a vessel carried above an impure item <b>will</b> come to <b>rest</b> directly on that impure item. <b>And the Rabbis hold: We do not decree</b> that the vessel contracts impurity in such a case. <b>And Rabbi Akiva concedes</b> that <b>in</b> the act of <b>sprinkling,</b> while the water passes over an impure item, <b>once it has set forth</b> into the air, <b>it has set forth.</b> Since the water has left the person’s hand, the person cannot leave it to rest upon an impure item.",
            "The Gemara asks: If so, Rabbi Akiva and the Rabbis would agree that the water of purification does not become impure before touching a menstruating woman. <b>And,</b> if so, then <b>Rabbi Elazar and the Rabbis,</b> who disagree as to whether impure water of purification renders one pure, <b>with regard to what</b> case <b>do they disagree? Abaye said: They disagree with regard to</b> whether one may <b>derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>impurity</b> rendered <b>earlier,</b> before sprinkling the water of purification, <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>impurity</b> rendered <b>at that</b> very <b>moment</b> that the purification occurs, as in the case of the menstruating woman.",
            "One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Elazar, <b>holds:</b> One <b>derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> in this manner, and, therefore, the water effects purification even if the water has become impure first. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that one does <b>not derive</b> this <i>halakha</i>. Therefore, Rav Ḥisda’s answer to Rami bar Hama is that, according to the opinion of Rabbi Elazar, if the impurity occurs in the moment that the sin offering’s blood touches the impure garment, the <i>halakha</i> is the same as it is when the blood has become impure before reaching the garment. In both cases, the garment is exempt from laundering. According to the opinion of the Rabbis, the <i>halakha</i> is not the same in both cases: If the blood becomes impure at the very moment it reaches the garment, laundering is required.",
            "<b>Rava said:</b> The case of sprinkling water of purification upon a menstruating woman has no bearing upon the case of the sprayed garment, <b>as everyone</b> holds that one does <b>not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of impurity incurred earlier from the <i>halakha</i> of impurity incurred at that very moment.",
            "Rava continues: <b>But here,</b> with regard to the precedent of the menstruating woman, <b>they disagree about this: Rabbi Elazar holds</b> that <b>sprinkling</b> the water of purification <b>requires</b> a specific <b>measure</b> of the water, <b>but</b> sprinklings of small quantities <b>combine to</b> constitute <b>sprinklings</b> of the required measure. Therefore, if the initial sprinkling on the woman does not contain a sufficient measure of water, the small quantity of water of purification first becomes impure, but it later combines with the subsequent sprinkling to purify her. Consequently, water of purification that has already become impure may effect purification. <b>But the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>sprinkling</b> of the water <b>does not require a measure.</b> Accordingly, the woman is purified by the initial sprinkling, although the purification water becomes impure at the very moment that it reaches her; and this does not have any bearing on a case in which the purification water is impure before it touches the person upon whom it is sprinkled.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>a disqualified sin offering,</b> a garment on which its blood is sprayed does not require laundering, whether the offering had a moment of qualification when its blood was fit for sprinkling or whether it did not have a moment of qualification. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a garment on which the blood of a sin offering sprayed, the verse states: “And when any <b>of its blood</b> shall be sprinkled on a garment” (Leviticus 6:20), teaching that laundering is required when some <b>of the blood of a fit</b> sin offering is sprayed on the garment, <b>but</b> this is <b>not</b> so in the case <b>of the blood of a disqualified</b> sin offering. <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> If the sin offering <b>had a period of fitness and</b> then <b>was disqualified,</b> a garment onto which <b>its blood</b> sprayed still <b>requires laundering.</b> If it <b>did not have a period of fitness</b> at all <b>and was</b> then <b>disqualified,</b> a garment onto which <b>its blood</b> sprayed <b>does not require laundering.</b>",

What is the reasoning of Rabbi Shimon?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is written</b> in the Torah with regard to laundering the blood of a sin offering: “Every male among the priests may eat <b>it”</b> (Leviticus 6:22), and only it. <b>And it is written</b> earlier in that same section: <b>“Of its blood”</b> (Leviticus 6:20), but not all its blood. Therefore, there are two exclusionary terms; <b>one</b> excludes laundering <b>for</b> the situation <b>where</b> the unfit offering <b>had a period of fitness,</b> and the other excludes a situation in which the offering did not have a period of fitness.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> interpret these verses? From the term “of its blood” he derives that the offering that has no period of fitness is excluded. The exclusion indicated by the word <b>“it”</b> teaches that the requirement for scouring and rinsing a copper vessel in which sacred food was cooked <b>excludes <i>teruma</i>,</b> i.e., scouring and rinsing is not required for a vessel in which <i>teruma</i> was cooked. <b>And</b> rejecting Rabbi Akiva’s understanding, <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as he says: Offerings of lesser sanctity do not require scouring and rinsing</b> as explained on 96b, <b>and all the more so</b> does <b><i>teruma</i></b> not require this. Consequently, Rabbi Shimon does not need a verse to exclude <i>teruma</i>, and he interprets the verse to exclude both a sin offering that had a period of fitness and a sin offering that did not have a period of fitness.",

The ritually impure robe must be brought into the courtyard in this manner <b>because it is stated</b> with regard to the High Priest’s robe: <b>“It shall not be torn”</b> (Exodus 28:32).",

Because of their particular qualities, such garments are useful only when they are larger and are not considered significant items when they measure three by three. Since the High Priest’s robe is a thick garment, why must one bring it into the courtyard only in portions of less than three by three?",
            "The Gemara answers: With regard to the whole robe of the High Priest, which is a garment of particular significance, even the small portions of the robe <b>are significant due to their source</b> garment, and are susceptible to impurity in portions measuring three by three fingerbreadths.",
            "§ The Gemara asks a fundamental question with regard to the procedure for laundering a garment upon which the blood of a sin offering has sprayed: <b>But isn’t</b> it so that laundering <b>requires seven</b> abrasive <b>substances?

            "<b>The Master says</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: If the sin offering was burned due to acute mourning, why was it burned at all? <b>He should have eaten it in the evening.</b> The Gemara comments: Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon <b>say well to</b> Rabbi Neḥemya in posing this difficulty.

If it then touches another food, it imparts to it second-degree impurity. <b>The carcass of a kosher bird, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> transmits impurity to food without being rendered susceptible. Does one <b>count its first and second</b> degrees of impurity when it touches food or drink, treating it like a primary source of impurity? <b>Or</b> perhaps one <b>does not count first and second</b> degrees of impurity, but rather treats it as a food with first-degree impurity, which imparts second-degree impurity?",

And <b>wherever it cannot render a person impure through contact,</b> one <b>does not count its first and second</b> degrees of impu-rity. Since the carcass of a kosher bird does not render a person impure through contact, but only by being swallowed, it is treated as a food with first-degree impurity.",
            "<b>Rabbi Zeira posed a dilemma to Rabbi Ami bar Ḥiyya, and some say to Rabbi Avin bar Kahana</b> concerning <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 8:8): <b>Connections between foods by liquid,</b> i.e., liquids in contact with two foods, a situation that causes the impurity of one food to be transmitted to the other and their sizes to be combined toward the minimum measure for transmitting impurity, are considered <b>a connection for</b> the <b>lenient impurity</b> of foods, <b>but</b> are <b>not</b> considered <b>a connection for impurity severe</b> enough to be transmitted to a human being. If two pieces of animal carcass are connected by a liquid, they do not combine to form the minimum measure for transmitting their impurity to a person, but they can transmit impurity to food.",
            "Rabbi Zeira asks: If these two pieces of animal carcass come in contact with food, does one <b>count its first and second</b> degrees of impurity and treat the pieces as a primary source of impurity, such that the food will impart second-degree impurity to other food? <b>Or</b> does one <b>not count its first and second</b> degrees of impurity, and treat the animal carcass as food with first-degree impurity?",

Since the first part of the verse makes reference to offering up, by inference, the term “you shall do” in the second part must be referring to all the other sacrificial rites. Therefore, <b>the verse has regarded all of</b> the sacrificial rites apart from offering up as <b>one rite</b> with regard to the prohibition against performing them outside the Temple courtyard.",
            "Rabbi Abbahu also said: One who <b>sprinkled</b> the blood of an offering <b>and offered</b> it <b>up</b> outside, in a single lapse of awareness, <b>according to the statement of Rabbi Yishmael</b> is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin offerings. <b>According to the statement of Rabbi Akiva,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin offering.",

But if he slaughtered it outside, thereby rendering it unfit, and then he offered it up outside, he is exempt for the offering up, as he offered up only an item that is unfit, and one is liable only for offering up an item that is fit to be offered up inside the Temple. The Rabbis said to him: According to your reasoning, even in a case where he slaughters it inside and offers it up outside, he should be exempt, since he rendered it unfit the moment that he took it outside the courtyard. Yet, in such a case, he is certainly liable for offering it up. So too, one who slaughters an offering outside and then offers it up outside is liable.",

The Rabbis said to him: According to your logic, even in a case of an impure person who ate what had been pure sacrificial food, once he has touched it, he has thereby rendered it ritually impure.

            "<b>When they disagree</b> is in a case where first the <b>meat is rendered impure and</b> then <b>afterward the</b> person’s <b>body is rendered impure.</b> In general, once an item has become subject to a prohibition, it cannot then become subject to an additional prohibition.

It <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who says</b> (see <i>Temura</i> 22b): A sin offering that was <b>lost during the time of</b> the <b>separation</b> of a substitute, if it is later found and one of them is slaughtered as the person’s sin offering, the other one is <b>put to death.</b> Accordingly, it is actually disqualified from being used as an offering, and one is therefore not liable for offering it up outside.",
            "<b>And this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying</b> by presenting its analogy: <b>The reason</b> that one is exempt from liability for offering up the unused sin offering outside is <b>that</b> it <b>was lost</b> at the time its substitute was separated and therefore it is considered disqualified. <b>But</b> if <b>one separated two sin offerings</b> from the outset <b>as a guarantee,</b> so that even if one is lost he can use the other, then if neither is lost and he sacrifices one of them, the other one is not put to death. Rather, it is left to graze until it becomes blemished, at which point it is sold and the proceeds used to purchase a voluntary burnt offering. It emerges that <b>from the outset, one of these</b> two animals, i.e., the one that was not ultimately sacrificed as his sin offering, <b>is a burnt offering,</b> and therefore if one offers it up outside the courtyard he is liable. The analogy teaches that with regard to blood collected in two cups, if one offers up blood from the unused cup outside, he is exempt only because the blood in that cup is considered disqualified, but he would not be exempt if it was considered a remainder.",

Therefore, a guilt offering left to graze is still considered fit. <b>But</b> in the mishna’s case, just because the animal is left to graze does not necessarily indicate that it itself is fit to be brought, as <b>a sin offering is a female</b> animal, which can never be brought as a burnt offering. Therefore, it should be considered unfit. <b>Rav Ḥiyya from Yostiniyya said:</b> The ruling of the mishna is <b>with regard to the goat of</b> the <b><i>Nasi</i>,</b> which is a male sin offering. Therefore, in a case where it is left to graze it is still considered fit, as it can be brought as a burnt offering.<br/>This chapter discussed two distinct prohibitions: That of slaughtering an offering outside the Temple courtyard and that of offering up an offering by placing it upon an altar outside the Temple courtyard.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>It is not necessary,</b> as follows: <b>It is not necessary</b> for the mishna to teach that in slaughtering a red heifer <b>outside the wall</b> in a location not opposite the entrance, one does not transgress the prohibition against slaughtering outside the Temple courtyard. In that case it is clearly disqualified, <b>as he has distanced it</b> from where it is meant to be slaughtered. <b>But even</b> if one slaughtered it <b>inside the wall</b> of Jerusalem, so <b>that he brings it closer</b> to the Temple, <b>and</b> one might <b>say</b> that <b>it is a valid</b> way of slaughtering the red heifer, Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>teaches us</b> that nevertheless it is disqualified.",

The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Huna said: As the verse states</b> with regard to the offering that was sacrificed after the flood: <b>“And Noah built an altar to the Lord, and took of every pure animal, and of every pure fowl,</b> and offered burnt offerings on the altar” (Genesis 8:20). The Gemara explains: <b>“Animal [<i>behema</i>],”</b> is understood <b>in accordance with its plain meaning,</b> a domesticated animal, and the same is true of fowl; <b>an undomesticated animal [<i>ḥayya</i>]</b> is <b>included in</b> the term <b>“<i>behema</i>”</b> that is stated in the verse."

            "That which was taught in the <i>baraita</i>: All animals were fit to be sacrificed: <b>Males and females, unblemished and blemished</b> animals, pertains to <b>that</b> which <b>the Master said</b> as a principle concerning the <i>halakhot</i> of sacrifices: The requirements that an offering must have <b>unblemished status and</b> that a burnt offering must have <b>male status</b> apply <b>to animal</b> offerings, <b>but</b> the requirements of <b>unblemished status and male status</b> do <b>not</b> apply <b>to birds.</b>",
            "<b>And</b> in the verses that recount Noah’s sacrifices upon exiting the ark, <b>a domesticated animal is juxtaposed with a bird,</b> in the verse: “Of every pure animal, and of every pure fowl” (Genesis 8:20), which teaches that kosher animals had a status identical to that of birds, and could be sacrificed whether male or female, unblemished or blemished.",
            "The Gemara adds: That which was taught in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Unblemished and blemished</b> animals, serves <b>to exclude</b> animals that are <b>lacking a limb, which</b> were <b>not</b> fit for sacrifice. As <b>Rabbi Elazar says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> an animal that is <b>lacking a limb is forbidden to the descendants of Noah,</b> i.e., gentiles, to be used as a sacrifice? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to Noah: <b>“And of every living being of all flesh,</b> two of every sort shall you bring into the ark” (Genesis 6:19). With regard to the phrase: “And of every living being,” which is superfluous, <b>the Torah stated: Bring an animal whose limbs are</b> all <b>living,</b> not one lacking a limb, as that animal is disqualified from sacrifice.",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>But perhaps</b> this phrase: “And of every living being,” serves <b>to exclude an animal with a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>]</b> from being fit as a sacrifice. The Gemara explains: The disqualification of a <i>tereifa</i> <b>is derived from</b> the phrase: <b>“To keep seed alive”</b> (Genesis 7:3), as a <i>tereifa</i> cannot propagate.",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that <b>a <i>tereifa</i> cannot give birth.</b> In this case the disqualification of the <i>tereifa</i> is derived from the verse: “To keep seed alive,” while the disqualification of the animal lacking a limb is derived from the verse: “And of every living being.” <b>But according to the one who says</b> that <b>a <i>tereifa</i> can give birth, what can be said?</b> According to this opinion, a <i>tereifa</i> cannot be excluded by the phrase: “To keep seed alive.” The Gemara explains: <b>Doesn’t the verse state</b> with regard to the animals that were brought by Noah into the ark: “You shall bring into the ark, to keep them alive <b>with you”</b> (Genesis 6:19)? The term “with you” indicates that the verse is stated <b>with regard to</b> animals that are <b>similar to you,</b> not a <i>tereifa</i>.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps Noah himself was a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> If so, one cannot exclude a <i>tereifa</i> from the comparison of animals to Noah. The Gemara answers: <b>It is written about</b> Noah that he was <b>“complete”</b> (Genesis 6:9), which indicates that he was physically whole and unblemished. The Gemara challenges: <b>But perhaps</b> the verse means that <b>his ways were complete,</b> and it is not referring to Noah’s physical attributes. The Gemara explains: <b>It is</b> already <b>written about him</b> that he was <b>“righteous”</b> (Genesis 6:9), which means that his actions were perfect. Consequently, when the verse says that he was also complete, it must be referring to his body.",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>But perhaps</b> the verse means that Noah was <b>complete in his manner,</b> and he was <b>righteous in his</b> good <b>deeds.</b> Accordingly, the verse would not exclude the possibility that Noah himself was a <i>tereifa</i>. The Gemara responds: <b>If it enters your mind</b> to say <b>that Noah himself was a <i>tereifa</i>, would the Merciful One have said to him: Bring in</b> <i>tereifot</i> <b>like you</b> to the ark, but <b>do not bring in whole</b> and perfect animals? It is not reasonable to say that there would be a preference for him to bring <i>tereifot</i>. Rather, Noah was certainly not a <i>tereifa</i>, and the fact that a <i>tereifa</i> is disqualified for sacrifice is derived from “with you.”",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And once we derive</b> the disqualification of a <i>tereifa</i> <b>from</b> the term <b>“with you,” why do I</b> need the phrase <b>“to keep seed alive”?</b> The Gemara answers: If one could derive only from <b>“with you,” you would say</b> that Noah brought the animals to the ark <b>only for</b> the purpose of <b>companionship,</b> and therefore <b>even</b> an animal that is <b>old</b> or <b>even one who is castrated</b> can come into the ark, provided that it is not a <i>tereifa</i>. Therefore, the Merciful One writes: “To keep seed alive,” which <b>teaches us</b> that only animals that can bear offspring were allowed to be brought into the ark.",
            "§ The <i>baraita</i> also teaches that before the Tabernacle was constructed, sacrifices were brought from animals and birds that were <b>kosher, but not</b> from <b>non-kosher</b> species. This is based on the verse that describes what Noah sacrificed when he exited the ark: “And he took of every pure animal and of every pure fowl and offered burnt offerings on the altar” (Genesis 8:20). The Gemara asks: <b>And were there pure and impure</b> species <b>at that time,</b> during the period of Noah? The distinction between pure, i.e., kosher species, and impure, i.e., non-kosher species, was introduced only after the Torah was given (see Leviticus, chapter 11). <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says:</b> The pure animals that Noah took were <b>from those that had not been used in the performance of sin.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>From where did</b> Noah and his sons <b>know</b> which animals had been used in the performance of a sin, in order to prevent them from entering the ark? The Gemara answers that it is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rav Ḥisda. As Rav Ḥisda says:</b> Noah caused all of the animals to <b>pass before the ark. All</b> animals <b>that the ark accepted,</b> i.e., drew in, was <b>known to be pure;</b> if <b>the ark did not accept them,</b> it was <b>known that they</b> were <b>impure.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Abbahu says</b> there is a different explanation as to how Noah knew which animals were pure or impure. <b>The verse states: “And they that went in,</b> went in <b>male and female</b> of all flesh” (Genesis 7:16), which means: Those <b>that went in on their own.</b> Consequently, Noah did not need to distinguish between pure and impure animals, as only the pure ones approached.",
            "§ In describing the sacrificial service before the Tabernacle was constructed, <b>the Master said: And all</b> offerings brought before the construction of the Tabernacle were <b>sacrificed</b> as <b>burnt offerings.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>Burnt offerings, yes,</b> were sacrificed, but <b>peace offerings</b> were <b>not</b> sacrificed. The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> with regard to the offerings that were sacrificed at Mount Sinai at the time of the giving of the Torah, <b>it is written:</b> “And they offered burnt offerings, <b>and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen to the Lord”</b> (Exodus 24:5). This event occurred prior to the construction of the Tabernacle. <b>Rather, say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> means: <b>All</b> offerings <b>sacrificed</b> were either <b>burnt offerings or peace offerings.</b>",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>And isn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>But peace offerings</b> were <b>not</b> sacrificed before the construction of the Tabernacle; <b>rather, only burnt offerings</b> were sacrificed? Clearly, <b>burnt offerings, yes,</b> were sacrificed, but <b>peace offerings</b> were <b>not</b> sacrificed. The Gemara answers that this <i>baraita</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the one who says</b> that <b>peace offerings were not sacrificed</b> by the <b>descendants of Noah. As it was stated</b> that there is a dispute between <b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina</b> with regard to this: <b>One says</b> that <b>the descendants of Noah sacrificed peace offerings, and one says</b> that <b>they did not sacrifice</b> peace offerings.",
            "The Gemara explains the two opinions: <b>What is the reasoning of the one who says</b> that <b>the descendants of Noah sacrificed peace offerings? As it is written: “And Abel, he also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of the fat thereof”</b> (Genesis 4:4). Abel, like all gentiles, is categorized as a descendant of Noah. The verse emphasizes that the fat was sacrificed. The Gemara analyzes: <b>What is an item,</b> i.e., an offering, <b>the fat of which is sacrificed upon the altar, but</b> that <b>is not sacrificed in its entirety upon the altar? You must say: This is the peace offering,</b> the meat of which is consumed.",
            "<b>What is the reasoning of the one who says</b> that <b>they did not sacrifice</b> peace offerings? <b>As it is written: “Awake [<i>uri</i>], O north; and come, south…</b>Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his precious fruits” (Song of Songs 4:16). The Gemara interprets this homiletically: The <b>nation,</b> i.e., the nations of the world, who are the descendants of Noah, <b>whose acts,</b> i.e., sacrifices, are only <b>in the north,</b> i.e., they sacrifice only burnt offerings, which are slaughtered and their blood collected in the north of the Temple courtyard, <b>shall be removed [<i>titna’er</i>], and</b> in its place <b>shall come</b> the Jewish <b>nation, whose acts,</b> i.e., sacrifices, are <b>in the north and in the south,</b> as they sacrifice burnt offerings, whose rites are performed in the north, and peace offerings, whose rites may also be performed in the south, as the entire courtyard is fit for their rites.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And also</b> according to <b>the Master</b> who holds that the descendants of Noah did not sacrifice peace offerings, <b>isn’t it written: “And of the fat thereof,”</b> from which it may be derived that Abel sacrificed a peace offering? The Gemara answers: “The fat thereof,” does not mean that Abel sacrificed only the fats of his offerings; rather, it means that he sacrificed <b>the fattest of them,</b> i.e., the fattest and choicest of his animals.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And also</b> according to <b>the Master</b> who holds that the descendants of Noah did sacrifice peace offerings, <b>isn’t it written: “Awake, O north,”</b> from which it may be derived that the nations of the world do not sacrifice peace offerings? The Gemara answers: In his opinion, <b>that</b> verse <b>is written with regard to the ingathering of the exiles,</b> i.e., the Jewish exiles will come from the north and the south.",
            "With regard to the opinion that the descendants of Noah did not sacrifice peace offerings, the Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “And Moses said: You must also give into our hand sacrifices [<i>zevaḥim</i>] and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God”</b> (Exodus 10:25)? This indicates that sacrifices [<i>zevaḥim</i>], i.e., peace offerings, were sacrificed before the Torah was given. The Gemara answers: In this context, <b>“<i>zevaḥim</i>”</b> is referring to animals to be used <b>for consumption,</b> as the word <i>zevaḥ</i> can also be translated as an animal for slaughter, <b>and “burnt offerings”</b> is referring to animals to be used <b>for sacrifice.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written</b> before the giving of the Torah: <b>“And Yitro, Moses’ father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices [<i>zevaḥim</i>]</b> for God” (Exodus 18:12)? Since the word <i>zevaḥim</i> there is referring to sacrifices, as the verse clearly states that Yitro took them for God, evidently peace offerings were sacrificed before the giving of the Torah. The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>was written</b> with regard to the period <b>after the giving of the Torah,</b> when the Jewish people were permitted to sacrifice peace offerings.",
            "The Gemara notes: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that the episode with <b>Yitro was after the giving of the Torah. But according to the one who says</b> that the episode with <b>Yitro was before the giving of the Torah, what can be said?

            "§ The Gemara notes that the disagreement between <i>amora’im</i> with regard to when Yitro came to Mount Sinai is <b>like</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>:</b> The Torah states with regard to Yitro, before he came to Mount Sinai: <b>“Now Yitro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard</b> of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel His people, how the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt” (Exodus 18:1). <b>What tiding did he hear that he came and converted?

            "<b>Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i says: He heard</b> about <b>the giving of the Torah and came.

            "At that time, <b>all of</b> the kings <b>gathered around Balaam the wicked,</b> who was the greatest gentile prophet, <b>and said to him: What is the tumultuous sound,</b> i.e., the loud noise, <b>that we have heard?

Balaam <b>said to them: “The Lord sits as King forever”</b> (Psalms 29:10), which means that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, already took an oath</b> after the flood <b>never to bring a flood to the world,</b> as it is stated: “And the waters shall no more become a flood” (Genesis 9:15).",
            "The kings <b>said to him: He will not bring a flood of water,</b> as he vowed, <b>but</b> perhaps <b>He will bring a flood of fire,</b> as in the future the Lord will punish the nations with fire, <b>as it is stated: “For by fire will the Lord contend,</b> and by His sword with all flesh; and the slain of the Lord shall be many” (Isaiah 66:16). Balaam <b>said to them: He already took an oath that He will not destroy all flesh</b> in any manner, as it is stated: “To destroy all flesh” (Genesis 9:15).

            "The Gemara offers another explanation of what Yitro heard: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: He heard</b> about <b>the splitting of the Red Sea and came, as it is stated</b> in a similar context with regard to the splitting of the Jordan in the days of Joshua: <b>“And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites,</b> that were beyond the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, that were by the sea, <b>heard</b> how that the Lord had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel, until they were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them anymore, because of the children of Israel” (Joshua 5:1). <b>And even Rahab the prostitute said to Joshua’s messengers: “For we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea</b> before you” (Joshua 2:10).",

            "The Gemara replies that Rahab used this phrase euphemistically, to say that their fear was so great <b>that</b> their male organs <b>were not even</b> able to <b>become erect,</b> as “<i>kama</i>” also means rise. The Gemara asks: <b>And how did</b> Rahab <b>know</b> this? The Gemara replies: <b>As the Master said: You do not have any prince or ruler</b> at that time <b>who did not engage in intercourse with Rahab the prostitute.</b>",
            "The Gemara adds that the Sages <b>said</b> with regard to Rahab: <b>She was ten years old when the Jewish people left Egypt, and she engaged in prostitution all forty years that the Jewish people were in the wilderness.

Rahab first concealed the spies in stalks of flax, and later assisted them in exiting her home by lowering them from the window with a rope (see Joshua 2:6 and 2:15).",
            "§ <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that discussed the sacrifice of offerings before the construction of the Tabernacle: <b>And today gentiles are permitted to do so,</b> i.e., to sacrifice offerings outside the Temple courtyard, despite the fact that this is forbidden for the Jews.

            "This is <b>similar to that</b> incident in <b>which Ifera Hurmiz, the mother of King Shapur</b> of Persia, <b>sent an offering to Rava,</b> with which <b>she sent</b> this message <b>to him: Sacrifice this for me, for the sake of Heaven.</b> Rava <b>said to Rav Safra and to Rav Aḥa bar Huna: Go, take two</b> gentile <b>youths of the same age,</b> i.e., similar to one another, so that the sacrifice will be performed with maximal beauty, <b>and see where the sea</b> currently <b>raises silt [<i>sirton</i>],</b> which is a place that no one has used before. <b>And take new wood and bring out fire from new vessels, and</b> the two youths will <b>sacrifice</b> the offering <b>for her, for the sake of Heaven.</b>",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>Which of</b> the three camps that were present in the wilderness <b>was not</b> present in Shiloh? <b>Rabba said: It stands to reason that the Levite camp was</b> present, but the Israelite camp was not. <b>As, if it enters your mind to say</b> that <b>the Levite camp was not</b> present in Shiloh,"

        [
            "it would consequently be <b>found</b> that both <b><i>zavim</i> and</b> those who are <b>ritually impure</b> from impurity imparted by <b>a corpse are sent out of one camp,</b> i.e., the camp of the Divine Presence, and both are permitted in the Israelite camp. <b>But the Torah said</b> with regard to sending the ritually impure out of the camp: “Outside the camp you shall put them; <b>that they will not defile their camps”</b> (Numbers 5:3).",
            "The use of the plural “camps” indicates: <b>Give</b> a specific <b>camp to this</b> group, i.e., those who are ritually impure from impurity imparted by a corpse, who may enter the Levite camp but are forbidden to enter the camp of the Divine Presence, <b>and</b> give a specific <b>camp to this</b> group, i.e., those who are <i>zavim</i>, who may enter the Israelite camp but are forbidden to enter the camp of the Divine presence or the Levite camp. If there were no Levite camp in Shiloh, it would follow that both a <i>zav</i> and one who is ritually impure from the impurity imparted by a corpse are sent out of only one camp, and there is no distinction between them.",
            "<b>Rava said to him: Rather, what</b> would you say instead? Would you say that <b>the Israelite camp was not</b> present in Shiloh?

            "<b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>actually, all three</b> camps <b>were</b> present in Shiloh, <b>and what</b> is the meaning of that which was taught with regard to Shiloh: <b>There were only two camps?</b> It is <b>with regard to</b> the fact that the Levite camp did not provide <b>refuge</b> to one who unintentionally killed another. The Gemara asks: <b>By inference,</b> does this mean <b>that in the wilderness the Levite camp did provide refuge</b> to those who unintentionally killed others?",
            "The Gemara replies: <b>Yes, and so it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse concerning the cities of refuge. The verse states: “And one who did not lie in wait…<b>and I will appoint for you a place</b> where he may flee” (Exodus 21:13). The phrase “I will appoint for you” teaches that God said to Moses: There will be a place that provides refuge for unintentional murderers even <b>during your lifetime.</b> The term <b>“a place”</b> means that it will be from <b>your place,</b> meaning the Levite camp served as the place that provided refuge in the wilderness. <b>“Where he may flee” teaches that</b> the Jews <b>would exile</b> unintentional murderers <b>in the wilderness</b> as well, before they entered the land. <b>To where did they exile</b> unintentional murderers when they were in the wilderness? They exiled them <b>to the Levite camp,</b> which provided refuge.",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the verse</b> from which the principle is derived that one who was already exiled to a city of refuge and who then killed another person is exiled to another area in that same city? <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, says</b> that the verse: <b>“For in his city of refuge he shall dwell”</b> (Numbers 35:28), indicates that he can be exiled to <b>a city in which he was already admitted,</b> as the verse is referring to it as his city, and he shall continue to reside there.",

            "The Gemara notes that the dispute between the <i>amora’im</i> with regard to the tribe in which the Tabernacle in Shiloh was located is <b>like</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is taught with regard to Moses’ blessing to Benjamin: <b>“He covers him”; this</b> is a reference to the <b>First Temple. “All the day”; this</b> is a reference to the <b>Second Temple. “And He dwells between his shoulders”; this</b> is a reference to <b>the messianic era.</b>",

            "The Gemara determines the number of years from when the Ark was captured by the Philistines and Shiloh was destroyed: <b>And it is written: “And it came to pass, from the day that the Ark abode in Kiriath Jearim that the time was long; for it was twenty years; and all the house of Israel yearned after the Lord”</b> (I Samuel 7:2). The Ark was returned by the Philistines to Kiriath Jearim seven months after it was captured, and it remained there for twenty years, until David brought it to Jerusalem.",
            "The Gemara explains that <b>these twenty years</b> are calculated as follows: <b>Ten years that Samuel reigned alone,</b> from the death of Eli until the coronation of Saul, <b>and</b> one <b>year that Samuel and Saul reigned,</b> i.e., Saul reigned for one year during the lifetime of Samuel, <b>and two</b> years <b>that Saul reigned</b> alone after the death of Samuel. <b>And</b> in addition to these thirteen years, there were the <b>seven</b> years <b>of David’s</b> reign in Hebron, before the years of his reign in Jerusalem."

In the first year that David reigned in Jerusalem he brought the Ark there from Kiriath Jearim. The Ark was therefore in Kiriath Jearim for twenty years. When the thirty-three years of David’s reign in Jerusalem are added to these, there are a total of fifty-three years from the destruction of Shiloh.

            "<b>that one brought inside and</b> subsequently <b>took outside, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does it have the status of a sacrificial item of a public altar? The Gemara clarifies the question: <b>Do we say</b> that <b>once</b> it was <b>brought in the partition</b> has already <b>absorbed it,</b> and all <i>halakhot</i> of sacrificial items of a public altar apply; <b>or perhaps once it returns,</b> i.e., was taken outside again, <b>it returns</b> to its prior status as an offering of a private altar?",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t this</b> issue <b>a disagreement between Rabba and Rav Yosef? As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Me’ila</i> 2a): With regard to <b>offerings of the most sacred order,</b> e.g., a sin offering or a guilt offering, <b>that were slaughtered in the south</b> of the Temple courtyard, and not in the north as dictated by <i>halakha</i>, and are therefore disqualified, one who derives benefit <b>from</b> them is liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, <b>and</b> despite the fact that they should not ascend the altar, <b>if they ascended they shall not descend.</b>",
            "<b>And a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If they <b>did descend</b> the altar, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>ascending</b> again? <b>Rabba says: They shall not ascend, and Rav Yosef says: They shall ascend.</b> Consequently, they disagree with regard to the issue of whether an item that is not fit to be sacrificed in a consecrated area acquires the sanctity of that area even if it is removed from there.",
            "The Gemara responds: The disagreements are not identical, as <b>the dilemma can be raised according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba,</b> and <b>the dilemma can be raised according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yosef.</b> The Gemara elaborates: It is possible to <b>raise the dilemma according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba,</b> as <b>Rabba says</b> his statement: Offerings of the most sacred order that were slaughtered in the south shall not descend if they ascended, <b>only with regard to the altar, as</b> the altar <b>consecrates that which is fit for it,</b> while it <b>does not consecrate that which is not fit for it. But</b> with regard to the <b>partition</b> of the public altar, <b>even though</b> an offering that was consecrated for a private altar <b>is not fit for</b> that altar, the partition nevertheless <b>absorbs</b> the offering and it is sacrificed there. Consequently, all the <i>halakhot</i> of the public altar apply to that offering, even if it is taken outside.",
            "<b>Or perhaps</b> the dilemma of the burnt offering of a private altar can be raised <b>even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yosef. Rav Yosef states</b> his opinion <b>there,</b> that offerings of the most sacred order that were slaughtered in the south of the Temple courtyard and descended the altar shall ascend again, <b>only because</b> the altar and the offering are both located in <b>one place,</b> i.e., the Temple courtyard. <b>But here</b> in Rabbi Zeira’s case, <b>where</b> the private altar and public altar <b>are two</b> separate <b>places,</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of the public altar do <b>not</b> apply if the offering was taken outside the designated location. <b>Or perhaps</b> there <b>is no difference,</b> and the opinions of Rabba and Rav Yosef in one case are identical to their opinions in the other. The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.",
            "The Gemara notes that <b>a matter that is obvious to Rabba on one side,</b> i.e., that these offerings shall not ascend the altar again, <b>and to Rav Yosef on</b> the other <b>side,</b> i.e., that they shall ascend again, <b>was raised as a dilemma by Rabbi Yannai. As Rabbi Yannai raises a dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the limbs of a burnt offering of a private altar that ascended the altar and descended?</b> The Gemara notes: In a case <b>where the fire has not</b> yet <b>taken hold of them, do not raise the dilemma,</b> as they certainly shall not ascend again. <b>When should you raise the dilemma?</b> Raise it in a case <b>where the fire has taken hold of them: What</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.",
            "§ Additionally, with regard to a private altar it <b>was stated:</b> With regard to <b>the slaughter of</b> offerings at <b>night on a private altar, Rav and Shmuel</b> disagree: <b>One says</b> that it is <b>valid, and one says</b> that it is <b>not valid.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>And they disagree with regard to</b> the resolution to a contradiction that was raised <b>by Rabbi Elazar.</b>",
            "<b>As Rabbi Elazar raised a contradiction between</b> two <b>verses: It is written</b> in the context of Saul’s war with the Philistines: “And the people flew upon the spoil and took sheep and cattle and calves and slew them on the ground; and the people ate them with the blood. Then they told Saul, saying: ‘Behold, the people sin against the Lord in that they eat with the blood. <b>And he said: You have dealt treacherously; roll a great stone to me this day”</b> (I Samuel 14:32–33). That stone was made into a private altar upon which offerings could be slaughtered and sacrificed. Evidently, Saul was particular about slaughtering offerings during the day and not at night, despite the fact that it was a private altar and not a public altar.",
            "<b>And</b> immediately thereafter <b>it is written: “And Saul said: Disperse yourselves among the people and say to them: Bring me here every man his ox and every man his sheep, and slay them here and eat and sin not against the Lord in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there”</b> (I Samuel 14:34). This verse states explicitly that the slaughter took place at night and not during the day.",
            "Rav and Shmuel disagree with regard to the resolution of this contradiction: One <b>Sage answers</b> that <b>here,</b> i.e., when the slaughter took place at night, it was <b>of non-sacred</b> animals, while <b>there,</b> i.e., when Saul was particular about slaughtering during the day, it was the slaughter <b>of sacrificial</b> animals. According to this opinion, the sacrificial service was performed only during the day, even on a private altar. <b>And</b> the other <b>Sage answers</b> that both verses are referring to the slaughter of offerings: <b>Here,</b> in the verse that states that Saul was particular about slaughtering during the day, it is referring <b>to the sacrificial</b> animals <b>of a great</b> public <b>altar,</b> while <b>there,</b> in the verse that states that the slaughter took place at night, it is referring <b>to sacrificial</b> animals <b>of a small</b> private <b>altar.</b>",
            "§ It <b>was stated</b> that with regard to <b>the burnt offering of a private altar, Rav says: It does not require flaying and cutting</b> into pieces, which the Torah requires of a burnt offering (see Leviticus 1:6), <b>and Rabbi Yoḥanan says: It does require flaying and cutting</b> into pieces. The Gemara explains: <b>And they disagree with regard to</b> the meaning of a statement <b>of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: The burnt offering that the Jewish people sacrificed in the wilderness,</b> i.e., at Mount Sinai before the establishment of the Tabernacle, <b>did not require flaying and cutting</b> into pieces, <b>because</b> the requirement of <b>flaying and cutting</b> into pieces applied <b>only from the Tent of Meeting and onward,</b> as this <i>halakha</i> was first taught in the Tent of Meeting.",
            "One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>holds</b> that <b>from the Tent of Meeting and onward</b> there is a requirement of flaying and cutting into pieces, and there <b>is no difference</b> whether the offering is brought upon <b>a great</b> public <b>altar, and</b> there <b>is no difference</b> whether it is brought upon <b>a small</b> private <b>altar. And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav, <b>holds</b> that <b>with regard to a great</b> public <b>altar, yes,</b> flaying and cutting are required, but <b>with regard to a small</b> private <b>altar</b> they are <b>not.</b>",
            "<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> What are the <b>matters that are different between a great</b> public <b>altar and a small</b> private <b>altar?</b> The <b>corner</b> of the altar, the <b>ramp,</b> the <b>base</b> of the altar, <b>and</b> the <b>square</b> shape are required <b>in a great</b> public <b>altar, but</b> the <b>corner,</b> the <b>base,</b> the <b>ramp, and</b> the <b>square</b> shape <b>are not</b> required <b>in a small</b> private <b>altar.</b> The <b>Basin and its base</b> are required <b>in a great</b> public <b>altar, but</b> the <b>Basin and its base are not</b> required <b>in a small</b> private <b>altar.</b> The <b>breast and thigh</b> of a peace offering, which are given to a priest, are waved <b>at a great</b> public <b>altar, but</b> the <b>breast and thigh are not</b> waved <b>at a small</b> private <b>altar.</b>",
            "And there are other <b>matters</b> in <b>which a great</b> public <b>altar is identical to a small</b> private <b>altar: Slaughter</b> is required <b>at</b> both <b>a great</b> public <b>altar and a small</b> private altar. <b>Flaying</b> a burnt offering <b>and cutting</b> it into pieces is required <b>at</b> both <b>a great</b> public altar <b>and a small</b> private altar. Sprinkling the <b>blood permits</b> the meat to be eaten, <b>and</b> if at that time the priest thought of eating or sacrificing this offering outside its appropriate time, this <b>renders</b> the offering <b><i>piggul</i></b> both <b>at a great</b> public altar <b>and</b> at <b>a small</b> private altar. Likewise, the <i>halakha</i> that <b>blemishes</b> disqualify an offering <b>and</b> the <i>halakha</i> that there is a limited <b>time</b> for eating offerings are in effect <b>at</b> both <b>a great</b> public altar <b>and a small</b> private altar.",
            "§ Following the detailing of the differences between a communal altar and a private altar, the mishna teaches: <b>But</b> the <i>halakha</i> that portions of the offering <b>left over [<i>notar</i>]</b> beyond the time it is permitted must be burned and that one who eats them incurs <i>karet</i>, <b>and the</b> <i>halakha</i> that intent to sacrifice or partake of the offering beyond its designated <b>time</b> renders the offering <i>piggul</i>, <b>and the</b> prohibition against performing the sacrificial service or eating consecrated meat while <b>ritually impure are equal in this,</b> i.e., a private altar, <b>and that,</b> i.e., a public altar.",
            "With regard to this <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>time,</b> i.e., the <i>halakha</i> that an offering left over beyond its designated time is disqualified, in the case <b>of a small</b> private <b>altar should be made equivalent to</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case <b>of a great</b> public <b>altar? The Torah stated:</b> An offering that was <b>left overnight</b> must <b>be burned, and</b> likewise the Torah stated that <b>an offering that was sacrificed with the intent to consume it after its designated time [<i>piggul</i>]</b> must <b>be burned.</b> Therefore, another parallel may be drawn between them: <b>Just as <i>piggul</i> is disqualified</b> in the case <b>of</b> a private <b>altar, so too,</b> an offering that was <b>left overnight</b> is <b>disqualified</b> in the case <b>of</b> a private <b>altar.</b>",
            "<b>Or go this way,</b> and say that <b>because the Torah stated:</b> An offering that was <b>left overnight must be burned, and</b> likewise, the Torah stated that an offering that <b>leaves</b> the Temple courtyard <b>must be burned,</b> the following conclusion may be drawn: <b>Just as</b> an offering that <b>leaves</b> the Temple courtyard is <b>valid in</b> the case of a private <b>altar</b> because it has no set perimeter, <b>so too,</b> an offering that was <b>left overnight</b> is <b>valid in</b> the case of a private <b>altar,</b> and it may therefore be concluded that the <i>halakha</i> of time does not apply to offerings on a private altar. The Gemara asks: <b>And is it not an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>bird</b> offerings that in the case of a private altar, time should render an offering disqualified?"
        ],
        [
            "<b>If bird</b> offerings, whose <i>halakhot</i> are more lenient in <b>that a blemish does not disqualify them, are</b> nevertheless <b>disqualified by time,</b> then with regard to <b>sacrificial</b> animals <b>of a small</b> private <b>altar, which are disqualified by a blemish, is it not logical that they</b> should be <b>disqualified by time?</b>",
            "The Gemara questions the inference: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about bird</b> offerings? They are notable <b>in that a non-priest is not fit to</b> sacrifice <b>them. Shall you say</b> the same <b>with regard to</b> offerings sacrificed on <b>a small</b> private <b>altar, where a non-priest is fit?</b> No, and consequently they <b>should not be disqualified by time.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings”</b> (Leviticus 7:11), which equates all peace offerings, <b>to render</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>time</b> with regard to <b>a small</b> private <b>altar identical to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>time</b> with regard to <b>a great</b> public <b>altar.</b>"
