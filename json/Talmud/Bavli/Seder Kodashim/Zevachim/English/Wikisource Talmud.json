            "[Mishnah]  ALL SACRIFICES SLAUGHTERED NOT IN THEIR OWN NAME ARE VALID, SAVE THAT THEY DO NOT FREE THEIR OWNERS OF THEIR OBLIGATION, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE PASSOVER-OFFERING AND THE SIN-OFFERING. [THIS HOLDS GOOD OF] A PASSOVER-OFFERING IN ITS PROPER TIME; AND A SIN-OFFERING AT ALL TIMES. ",
            "R. ELIEZER SAID:  ALSO THE GUILT-OFFERING [IS INVALID]. [AND THE LAW HOLDS GOOD OF] A PASSOVER-OFFERING IN ITS PROPER TIME, AND A SIN-OFFERING AND A GUILT-OFFERING AT ALL TIMES.  R. ELIEZER ARGUED:  THE SIN-OFFERING COMES ON ACCOUNT OF SIN, AND THE GUILT-OFFERING COMES ON ACCOUNT OF SIN: AS A SIN-OFFERING [ SLAUGHTERED] NOT IN ITS OWN NAME IS INVALID, SO IS THE GUILT-OFFERING INVALID [SLAUGHTERED] NOT IN ITS OWN NAME.

            "HOW SO?  IF ONE SLAUGHTERED MOST SACRED SACRIFICES UNDER THE DESIGNATION OF LESSER SACRIFICES, THEY ARE INVALID; IF ONE SLAUGHTERED LESSER SACRIFICES UNDER THE DESIGNATION OF MOST SACRED SACRIFICES, THEY ARE VALID.  IF ONE SLAUGHTERED A FIRSTLING OR TITHE IN THE NAME OF A PEACE-OFFERING, IT IS VALID; IF ONE SLAUGHTERED A PEACE-OFFERING IN THE NAME OF A FIRSTLING OR TITHE, IT IS INVALID. ",

            "— He informs us this: they merely do not free their owners of their obligation. yet they retain their [original] sanctity, and no alteration therein is permitted, ",
            "in accordance with Raba's dictum. For Raba said:  If a burnt-offering was slaughtered under a different designation, its blood must not be sprinkled under a different designation.  ",
            "If you wish, I can say [this follows] from reason, and if you wish I can say, from Scripture.  If you wish, I can say [this follows] from reason:  because he made an alteration therein [once], is he to go on making alterations therein?  ",
            "And if you wish, I can say [it follows] from Scripture:  That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt observe and do; according as thou hast vowed a freewill-offering unto the Lord thy God etc.:(Deuteronomy 23:24) is this a freewill-offering"
