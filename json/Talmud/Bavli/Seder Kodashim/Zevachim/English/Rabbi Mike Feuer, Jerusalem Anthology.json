If around, you might think that he must circle it with blood like a thread?  Therefore the verse says  “…and dash the blood upon the altar…” ... How then is it done? Its blood requires two applications in the shape of a Greek Gamma, which constitute four. ",
            "R’ Yishmael said  ‘around’ is said here, and ‘around’ (Vayikra 8:15) is said elsewhere: just as there it means four separate applications, so too here it means four separate applications. ",

It means, rather, that they sat at Ramah and were engaged with the beauty (noiyo) of the world. ",

That he swore to the Lord, he vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob; That I shall not come into the tent of my house, and I shall not go up on the bed that was spread for me. I shall not give sleep to my eyes nor slumber to my pupils, Until I find a place for the Lord, dwellings for the Mighty One of Jacob.
