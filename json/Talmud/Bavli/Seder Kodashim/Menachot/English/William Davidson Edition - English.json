            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> When one brings a meal offering to the Temple, the priest removes a handful from it, places the handful into a service vessel, conveys it to the altar, and burns it. At that point, the remainder is permitted to the priests for consumption and the owner has fulfilled his obligation. In this context, the mishna teaches: <b>All the meal offerings</b> from <b>which a handful was removed not for their sake</b> but for the sake of another meal offering <b>are fit</b> for sacrifice. <b>But</b> these offerings <b>did not satisfy the obligation of the owner,</b> who must therefore bring another offering. This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to all meal offerings <b>except for the meal offering of a sinner and the meal offering of jealousy,</b> which is brought as part of the rite of a woman suspected by her husband of having been unfaithful [<i>sota</i>]. In those cases, if the priest removed the handful not for its own sake, the offering is disqualified.",
            "With regard to <b>the meal offering of a sinner and the meal offering of jealousy</b> from <b>which</b> the priest <b>removed a handful not for their sake,</b> or where <b>he placed</b> a handful from them <b>in a vessel, or conveyed</b> the handful to the altar, <b>or burned</b> the handful on the altar, <b>not for their sake, or for their sake and not for their sake, or not for their sake and for their sake,</b> they <b>are disqualified.</b>",
            "The mishna elaborates: <b>How</b> are these rites performed <b>for their sake and not for their sake?</b> It is in a case where one removed the handful with two intentions: <b>For the sake of the meal offering of a sinner and for the sake of a voluntary meal offering.</b> How are these rites performed <b>not for their sake and for their sake?</b> It is in a case where one removed the handful with two intentions: <b>For the sake of a voluntary meal offering and for the sake of the meal offering of a sinner.</b>",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches: All the meal offerings from which a handful was removed not for their sake but for the sake of another meal offering are fit for sacrifice, but these offerings did not satisfy the obligation of the owner. The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the mishna <b>to teach: But</b> these offerings did not <b>[<i>ella</i></b> <i>shelo</i>] satisfy the obligation of the owner? <b>Let it teach</b> simply: <b>And they did not [<i>velo</i>] satisfy the obligation of the owner.</b> What does the word <i>ella</i> add?",
            "The Gemara responds: By adding this word, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that the only deficiency of these offerings is that <b>they did not satisfy the obligation of the owner; but the meal offering itself</b> is <b>valid and</b> it is still <b>prohibited to deviate</b> from the protocol of its sacrificial process. For example, if a handful was removed from a meal offering not for its own sake, it is prohibited to also burn it not for its own sake. This <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rava, as Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>a burnt offering that one slaughtered not for its own sake,</b> it is still <b>prohibited to sprinkle its blood</b> on the altar <b>not for its own sake.</b>",
            "The Gemara adds: <b>If you wish, propose a logical argument</b> to support this statement; <b>and if you wish, cite a verse</b> as proof. The Gemara elaborates: <b>If you wish, propose a logical argument:</b> Just <b>because one deviated</b> from protocol <b>in its</b> sacrifice once, by removing the handful, could it be that <b>he should continue to deviate</b> from protocol <b>in all</b> the rest of the sacrificial rites? One deviation does not justify additional deviations.",
            "<b>And if you wish, cite a verse: “That which has gone out of your lips you shall observe and do; according to what you have vowed as a gift offering to the Lord your God,</b> that which you have promised with your mouth” (Deuteronomy 23:24). The Gemara analyzes the verse: Is it <b>a gift</b> offering? <b>It is a vow</b> offering. Why does the verse first <b>call it a vow</b> offering <b>and</b> subsequently <b>call it a gift</b> offering? <b>Rather,</b> the verse teaches that <b>if you acted in accordance with how you vowed,</b> i.e., if you sacrificed the offering for its own sake, your obligation to fulfill your <b>vow will be</b> fulfilled; <b>but if</b> you did <b>not</b> act in accordance with your vow, it does not fulfill the obligation incurred by the vow, and <b>will be</b> considered <b>a gift</b> offering."
        ],
        [
            "The Gemara concludes the proof from the verse: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>a gift</b> offering, <b>is it permitted to deviate</b> from <b>its</b> protocol <i>ab initio</i>? Clearly one may not do so. Accordingly, if one of the sacrificial rites of a meal offering was performed for the sake of a different meal offering, it is still prohibited to perform any of its other sacrificial rites improperly.",
            "§ The mishna teaches that all the meal offerings from which a handful was removed not for their sake are fit for sacrifice but they do not fulfill the obligation of the owner. The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: All the meal offerings</b> from <b>which a handful was removed not for their sake are fit</b> for sacrifice <b>and they</b> even <b>satisfy the obligation of the owner.</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: Conversely, consecrated animals that were sacrificed not for their sake do not fulfill the obligation of the owner, <b>as</b> in this regard <b>meal offerings are not similar to slaughtered offerings.</b> The difference is <b>that</b> when <b>one removes a handful</b> from <b>a pan</b> meal offering <b>for the sake of a deep-pan</b> meal offering, <b>its mode of preparation proves</b> that <b>it</b> is in fact <b>for the sake of a pan</b> meal offering, as the two offerings differ in appearance. Similarly, with regard to <b>a dry</b> meal offering, e.g., the meal offering of a sinner, which contains no oil, whose handful is removed <b>for the sake of</b> a meal offering that is <b>mixed</b> with oil, <b>its mode of preparation proves</b> that <b>it</b> is <b>for the sake of a dry</b> meal offering, and one’s improper intent is therefore disregarded.",
            "<b>But with regard to slaughtered offerings it is not so, as</b> there is <b>one</b> manner of <b>slaughter for all</b> offerings, <b>and one</b> manner of <b>sprinkling</b> the blood <b>for all</b> offerings, <b>and one</b> manner of <b>collection</b> of the blood <b>for all</b> offerings. Since the differentiation between slaughtered offerings is established only through intention, one who sacrifices an animal offering not for its own sake does not fulfill the obligation of the owner. Rabbi Shimon apparently disagrees with the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna on two counts: First, he claims that if the handful of a meal offering was removed not for its own sake it satisfies the obligation of the owner, whereas the mishna teaches that the obligation is not fulfilled. Second, Rabbi Shimon does not differentiate between the meal offering of a sinner or the meal offering of jealousy, and the other types of meal offerings.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>This works out well,</b> i.e., the mishna can be explained in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, <b>according to Rav Ashi, who says</b> (3b), in a resolution of two apparently contradictory statements of Rabbi Shimon: <b>Here,</b> where Rabbi Shimon says that the meal offering is fit and fulfills the owner’s obligation, he is referring to a case <b>where</b> one states that he is <b>removing a handful</b> from <b>a pan</b> meal offering <b>for the sake of a deep pan,</b> i.e., he mentions only the vessel, not the type of meal offering. Conversely, <b>there,</b> where Rabbi Shimon says that the meal offering does not satisfy the owner’s obligation, he is referring to a case <b>where</b> one states that he is <b>removing a handful</b> from <b>a pan meal offering for the sake of a deep-pan meal offering.</b>",
            "Accordingly, it can be explained that <b>the mishna is</b> referring to a case where one removes a handful from <b>a meal offering for the sake of</b> another <b>meal offering,</b> which is why it does not satisfy the obligation of the owner. <b>But according to</b> the statements of <b>Rabba and Rava,</b> who resolved that contradiction in a different manner, <b>what can be said?</b>",
            "The Gemara elaborates: <b>And if you would say</b> that the contradiction addressed by Rav Ashi is resolved <b>as Rabba answers,</b> this is problematic. Rabba resolved the contradiction as follows: <b>Here,</b> where Rabbi Shimon says that the meal offering satisfies the owner’s obligation, he is referring <b>to a change of sanctity,</b> i.e., it was sacrificed for the sake of another type of meal offering, whereas <b>there,</b> where Rabbi Shimon says that it does not fulfill the owner’s obligation, he is referring <b>to a change of owner,</b> e.g., the meal offering of Reuven was sacrificed for the sake of Shimon.",
            "The Gemara explains that the reason this is problematic is that if one accepts Rabba’s resolution, how can the mishna be explained in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon? <b>The mishna is</b> clearly discussing the case of <b>a change of sanctity, as it teaches: How</b> are these rites performed <b>for their sake and</b> then <b>not for their sake,</b> whereby the offering does not satisfy the owner’s obligation? It is in a case where one initially removed the handful <b>for the sake of the meal offering of a sinner and</b> then <b>for the sake of a voluntary meal offering.</b> This is a change involving a different type of meal offering.",
            "<b>And alternatively,</b> if you would say that the contradiction addressed by Rav Ashi is resolved <b>as Rava answers,</b> this is equally problematic. Rava resolved the contradiction as follows: <b>Here,</b> where Rabbi Shimon says that the meal offering satisfies the owner’s obligation, he is referring to a case <b>where one removes a handful</b> from <b>a meal offering for the sake of</b> another <b>meal offering,</b> whereas <b>there,</b> where Rabbi Shimon says that it does not satisfy the owner’s obligation, he is referring to a case <b>where one removes a handful</b> from <b>a meal offering for the sake of a slaughtered offering.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains that if one accepts Rava’s resolution, the mishna cannot be in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon: <b>The mishna is</b> discussing a case where one removes a handful from <b>a meal offering for the sake of</b> another <b>meal offering, as it teaches:</b> How are these rites performed <b>not for their sake and for their sake?</b> It is a case where one removed the handful <b>for the sake of a voluntary meal offering</b> and then <b>for the sake of the meal offering of a sinner.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>Rather, according to</b> the resolutions offered by <b>Rabba and Rava, it is clear</b> that <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b>",
            "§ The Gemara cites the <i>baraita</i> that is the basis for the apparent contradiction between the statements of Rabbi Shimon, which was mentioned in the previous discussion: <b>And</b> a Sage <b>raises a contradiction</b> from one statement <b>of Rabbi Shimon and</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi Shimon, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that the verse written concerning the meal offering: <b>“It is most sacred, as the sin offering, and as the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:10), indicates that <b>there are some</b> meal offerings whose <i>halakha</i> is <b>like</b> that of <b>a sin offering, and there are some</b> whose <i>halakha</i> is <b>like</b> that of <b>a guilt offering.</b>",
            "Rabbi Shimon elaborates: The <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the meal offering of a sinner is like</b> that of <b>a sin offering. Therefore,</b> if one <b>removed a handful</b> from <b>it not for its own sake,</b> it is <b>disqualified,</b> just <b>like a sin offering</b> that was slaughtered not for its own sake. Conversely, the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a voluntary meal offering is like</b> that of <b>a guilt offering. Therefore,</b> if one <b>removed a handful</b> from <b>it not for its own sake,</b> it is <b>valid,</b> like a guilt offering that was slaughtered not for its own sake.",
            "Rabbi Shimon adds: <b>And</b> a voluntary meal offering is <b>like a guilt offering</b> in another aspect as well: <b>Just as a guilt offering</b> is <b>valid but it does not effect acceptance,</b> i.e., it does not satisfy the owner’s obligation, <b>so too, a voluntary meal offering</b> is <b>valid but it does not effect acceptance.</b> Rabbi Shimon here apparently contradicts his ruling that all meal offerings from which a handful was removed not for their sake satisfy the obligation of the owner.",
            "<b>Rabba said</b> in resolution of this contradiction: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> where Rabbi Shimon says that the meal offering satisfies the owner’s obligation, he is referring <b>to a change of sanctity,</b> i.e., it was sacrificed for the sake of another type of meal offering, whereas <b>there,</b> where he says that it does not fulfill the owner’s obligation, he is referring <b>to a change of owner,</b> e.g., the meal offering of Reuven was sacrificed for the sake of Shimon.",
            "<b>Abaye said to</b> Rabba: <b>Now</b> consider, the fact <b>that the Merciful One disqualifies</b> a meal offering due to improper <b>intent is</b> derived from the Torah’s <b>comparison</b> of meal offerings to sin offerings and guilt offerings. If so, <b>what</b> difference is there <b>to me</b> if there was <b>a change of sanctity,</b> and <b>what</b> difference is there <b>to me</b> if there was <b>a change of owner?</b> In the case of a guilt offering either of these changes prevents it from satisfying the obligation of the owner.",
            "Rabba <b>said to</b> Abaye: The claim that <b>its mode of preparation proves</b> one’s intent, <b>which Rabbi Shimon states</b> in explanation of why offerings are disqualified through improper intent, <b>is</b> based on <b>logical reasoning, as Rabbi Shimon interprets the reason</b> behind the mitzva <b>in the verse</b> and draws halakhic conclusions based on that interpretation.",
            "Rabba continues: This is significant, as Rabbi Shimon holds that <b>the Merciful One disqualifies</b> improper <b>intent that is not recognizably</b> false, i.e., when the intent is not in clear contradiction to the sacrificial rites performed. The intent to sacrifice an offering for the sake of another owner does not include a change in the sacrificial rites and it therefore disqualifies the offering. <b>The Merciful One does not disqualify</b> improper <b>intent that is recognizably</b> false and contradicts the sacrificial rites performed, e.g., if one removes a handful from a pan meal offering for the sake of a deep-pan meal offering, as the different substance itself indicates that it is a pan meal offering.",
            "The Gemara lists several questions with regard to Rabba’s statement, for which it provides <b>a mnemonic: Burnt offering, burnt offering, pinched and squeezed, bird sin offering, offerings of the most sacred order, offerings of lesser sanctity.</b>",
            "The Gemara first asks: But <b>if that is so,</b> that only intent that is not recognizably false disqualifies an offering, then in the case of <b>a bird burnt offering where one pinched</b> the nape of <b>its</b> neck <b>above</b> the red line that divides the upper and lower halves of the altar <b>for the sake of a bird sin offering,</b> it <b>should effect acceptance</b> according to Rabbi Shimon. The reason is <b>the actions</b> performed <b>on it prove that it is a bird burnt offering. Because if it is</b> in fact <b>a bird sin offering, he would have performed</b> the pinching <b>below</b> the red line while standing beside the altar. Nevertheless, Rabbi Shimon agrees with the ruling of the mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 64b) that this bird offering does not satisfy its owner’s obligation.",
            "The Gemara rejects this: <b>Is that to say</b> that a case of <b>a bird sin offering</b> that is pinched <b>above</b> the red line <b>is not</b> possible? <b>Didn’t the Master say:</b> The <b>pinching</b> of a bird sin offering that is performed <b>in any place on the altar</b> is <b>valid</b> after the fact? Accordingly, there is no discernible difference between the pinching of a bird burnt offering and the pinching of a bird sin offering, so the owner’s obligation is not fulfilled.",
            "The Gemara raises another difficulty: If recognizably false intent does not disqualify an offering, then <b>a bird burnt offering where</b> a priest <b>squeezed its blood above</b> the red line <b>for the sake of a bird sin offering should effect acceptance,</b> as <b>the actions</b> performed <b>on it prove that it is a bird burnt offering. Because if it is</b> in fact <b>a bird sin offering, he would have performed</b> the required act of holding the body of the bird and <b>sprinkling</b> its blood <b>below</b> the red line, instead of squeezing out its blood above that line."
        ],
        [
            "The Gemara responds: This is not considered recognizably false intent, as people might <b>say: Perhaps</b> it is actually a sin offering and he has already sprinkled its blood below the red line. And as for the fact that he squeezed its blood above the red line, they will say: <b>It is the squeezing that follows sprinkling,</b> which may be performed above the red line in the case of a sin offering. <b>As the Master said:</b> If one <b>squeezed the blood of</b> a bird sin offering <b>in any place on the altar,</b> the offering is <b>valid.</b> Since people might erroneously think that this bird is actually a sin offering, this intent is not considered recognizably false, so the offering is disqualified.",
            "The Gemara asks another question: According to Rabba’s resolution, <b>a bird sin offering whose blood</b> a priest <b>sprinkled below</b> the red line <b>for the sake of a bird burnt offering should effect acceptance, as the actions</b> performed <b>on it prove that it is a bird sin offering. Because if it is</b> in fact <b>a bird burnt offering, he would have performed it above</b> the red line, <b>and he would have performed</b> the act of <b>squeezing</b> instead of sprinkling.",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>Indeed,</b> according to Rabbi Shimon such a bird offering effects acceptance and fulfills the obligation of the owner. In fact, bird offerings were not discussed by Rabbi Shimon at all. <b>Rather, he said: Because meal offerings are not similar to slaughtered offerings,</b> which means that they are not similar <b>to slaughtered</b> animal <b>offerings, but</b> he did not say that they are <b>not</b> similar <b>to bird</b> offerings.",
            "The Gemara asks: But if so, then <b>offerings of the most sacred order that one slaughtered in the northern</b> part of the Temple courtyard, which is a requirement that applies only to offerings of the most sacred order, <b>for the sake of offerings of lesser sanctity, should effect acceptance</b> for their owners, as <b>the actions</b> performed <b>on them prove that they are offerings of the most sacred order. Because if</b> they are in fact <b>offerings of lesser sanctity, he would have performed their</b> slaughter <b>in the southern</b> part of the Temple courtyard.",
            "The Gemara answers: The slaughter of an offering in the northern part of the Temple courtyard is not indicative of the type of offering one intends it to be, as one can <b>say that the Merciful One states</b> that offerings of lesser sanctity may be slaughtered <b>even in the southern</b> part of the courtyard. <b>Did</b> He <b>say</b> that these offerings must be slaughtered specifically <b>in the southern</b> part <b>and not in the northern</b> part? This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 55a), that <b>the slaughter of</b> offerings of lesser sanctity may be performed <b>in any place within the</b> Temple <b>courtyard.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: If so, then <b>offerings of lesser sanctity that one slaughtered in the southern</b> part of the Temple courtyard <b>for the sake of offerings of the most sacred order should effect acceptance</b> for their owners, as <b>the actions</b> performed <b>on them prove that they are offerings of lesser sanctity. Because if</b> they are in fact <b>offerings of the most sacred order, he would have performed their</b> slaughter <b>in the northern</b> part of the Temple courtyard.",
            "The Gemara responds: The fact that an offering was slaughtered in the southern part of the Temple courtyard is not a clear indication that it was intended as an offering of lesser sanctity, as people might <b>say: They are</b> in fact <b>offerings of the most sacred order, but</b> the priest <b>transgressed</b> the mitzva to slaughter them in the northern part of the courtyard <b>and slaughtered them in the southern</b> part.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> i.e., if people might suspect an individual of performing the rite of an offering in an improper manner, then if a priest removes a handful from <b>a pan</b> meal offering <b>for the sake of a deep-pan</b> meal offering <b>as well,</b> one who sees <b>that this</b> priest <b>removes a handful for</b> the sake of <b>a deep-pan</b> meal offering might <b>say: This</b> owner <b>took a vow</b> to bring a meal offering <b>in a deep pan, and</b> as for the fact <b>that he brings it in a pan, it is</b> actually the meal offering <b>of a deep pan and</b> the owner <b>transgressed</b> the mitzva to bring it in a deep pan, <b>and brought it in a pan.</b> Why, then, does Rabbi Shimon maintain that such a meal offering satisfies the obligation of its owner?",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>There,</b> where the priest removed the handful from a pan meal offering for the sake of a deep-pan meal offering, <b>even if</b> the owner <b>took a vow</b> to bring a meal offering <b>in a deep pan, when he brings it in a pan it is</b> considered a valid <b>pan</b> meal offering, and therefore the priest’s intention is recognizably false.",
            "This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (102b): <b>One who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring a meal offering prepared <b>in a pan, and he brought</b> it <b>in a deep pan,</b> or if he says: It is incumbent upon me to bring a meal offering prepared <b>in a deep pan, and he brought</b> it <b>in a pan,</b> the meal offering <b>that he brought, he brought,</b> i.e., it is valid and the priest performs the rites of the meal offering that he actually brought, <b>but he did not fulfill</b> the obligation resulting from <b>his vow,</b> and he must bring another meal offering to fulfill that obligation.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> even so, the priest’s improper intent remains indiscernible, as people might think: <b>Perhaps</b> the owner <b>said: This</b> tenth of an ephah of flour is a meal offering that I must <b>bring in a pan, and</b> in spite of this <b>he brought</b> it <b>in a deep pan.</b> Such a meal offering is disqualified and is not considered a valid pan meal offering, <b>as we learned</b> in that same mishna: One who took a vow, saying: <b>This</b> tenth of an ephah of flour is a meal offering that I must <b>bring in a pan, and he brought</b> it <b>in a deep pan,</b> or if he vowed: This tenth of an ephah of flour is a meal offering that I must bring <b>in a deep pan, and he brought</b> it <b>in a pan, it is disqualified,</b> as he did not fulfill his vow. If so, how can Rabbi Shimon say that such a meal offering satisfies the owner’s obligation, when the intent is not recognizably false?",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>According to the Rabbis,</b> i.e., according to the opinion of the mishna just cited, there is <b>indeed</b> a difficulty. But <b>according to Rabbi Shimon</b> there is no difficulty, <b>since</b> with regard to a case where one took a vow, saying: It is incumbent upon me to bring a pan meal offering, and then he brought it in a deep pan, <b>Rabbi Shimon says: He has fulfilled even</b> the obligation resulting from <b>his vow. Evidently, the designation of the vessel</b> for a meal offering <b>is nothing</b> according to Rabbi Shimon, <b>and</b> there <b>is no difference</b> in this regard whether <b>he said: This</b> is for a particular type of meal offering, <b>and there is no difference</b> whether <b>he said:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring a particular meal offering. In both instances the unique actions of each particular meal offering prove its identity, and therefore the owner fulfills his obligation regardless of the priest’s improper intent.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> that in a case where the manner of its preparation proves the identity of an offering the owner fulfills his obligation, then <b>a burnt offering that one slaughtered for the sake of a sin offering should effect acceptance.</b> His actions prove that it is a burnt offering, <b>as this,</b> a burnt offering, is always <b>male, and that,</b> a sin offering, is <b>female.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Since there is</b> one sin offering, <b>the goat of</b> the <b><i>Nasi</i>, which is male, it is unknown</b> whether this animal was a burnt offering or the sin offering of the <i>Nasi</i>, and its gender is not conclusive proof.",
            "The Gemara continues to ask: But in a case where one <b>said:</b> I am hereby slaughtering this animal <b>for the sake of a sin offering of an individual,</b> which is always female, <b>what can be said?</b> Since a male animal cannot be mistaken for such a sin offering, why doesn’t this burnt offering satisfy the obligation of the owner? <b>And furthermore, a sin offering of an individual that one slaughtered for the sake of a burnt offering should effect acceptance, as</b> such <b>a sin offering</b> is always <b>female, and a burnt offering</b> is always <b>male.</b> The Gemara responds: It is difficult to discern whether a lamb is male or female, as its genitals are <b>covered by</b> its <b>tail.</b> Accordingly, its gender is not considered proof of the type of offering being sacrificed.",
            "The Gemara asks: This <b>works out well</b> in a case <b>where one brought a female lamb</b> as his sin offering, as its tail makes it difficult to discern its sex. But in a case where he <b>brought a female goat, what can be said?</b> Its gender is easily recognized, as goats do not have tails that cover their genitals. The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> discerning <b>between males and females is not on people’s minds,</b> i.e., they do not take notice of the offering’s gender and therefore this aspect of an animal is not considered discernible.",
            "The Gemara continues to challenge the opinion of Rabba: <b>A Paschal offering that one slaughtered for the sake of a guilt offering should effect acceptance, as this,</b> the Paschal offering, is <b>in its</b> first <b>year, and that,</b> a guilt offering, is <b>in its second</b> year. The Gemara answers: <b>Since there are</b> two guilt offerings that are brought from lambs in their first year, i.e., <b>the guilt offering of a nazirite</b> (see Numbers 6:12) <b>and the guilt offering of a leper</b> (see Leviticus 14:10), <b>it is not definitively</b> clear <b>to</b> an onlooker what type of offering this lamb is.",

In those instances, Rabbi Shimon maintains that the offerings fulfill the obligations of their respective owners despite the improper intent.",

By contrast, when he states that he is removing a handful from <b>a pan meal offering for the sake of a deep-pan meal offering, he has intent with regard to</b> the type of <b>meal offering, which</b> improper <b>intention does disqualify.</b> Consequently, the owner’s obligation is not fulfilled.",
            "The Gemara questions how Rav Ashi can maintain that this is the reasoning of Rabbi Shimon: <b>But doesn’t the <i>tanna</i>,</b> i.e., Rabbi Shimon, <b>say</b> that his reasoning is <b>that</b> for any particular meal offering, <b>its mode of preparation proves</b> what <b>it</b> is? The Gemara explains that <b>this</b> is what Rabbi Shimon <b>is saying: Even though</b> when he removes a handful from a pan meal offering explicitly for the sake of a deep pan, it is a case where the falseness of the <b>intention is recognizable</b> and the offering <b>should</b> therefore <b>be disqualified,</b> it is nevertheless valid and fulfills the owner’s obligation, as intentions with regard to the vessel are irrelevant.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And what</b> does Rabbi Shimon mean when he says: <b>But with regard to slaughtered offerings it is not so?</b> He means that <b>even though</b> there is <b>one</b> manner of <b>slaughter for all</b> offerings, and <b>one</b> manner of <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood <b>for all</b> offerings, and <b>one</b> manner of <b>collection</b> of the blood <b>for all</b> offerings, i.e., if one performs any of these rites for the sake of a different offering it is not recognizable that his intent is false, and therefore it might have been thought that the owner does fulfill his obligation, nevertheless he <b>has</b> improper <b>intent with regard to</b> an aspect of <b>slaughtering,</b> such as slaughtering a burnt offering for the sake of a peace offering, <b>which</b> improper <b>intention does disqualify.</b>",

Since his intent concerns the meal offering itself, it should disqualify the offering. Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b> When Rabbi Shimon says that such a meal offering fulfills the owner’s obligation he is referring to a case where one removes a handful <b>merely for the sake of mixing,</b> not for the sake of a meal offering mixed with oil.",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>If so,</b> then when one slaughters a burnt offering <b>for the sake of a peace offering as well,</b> one can say that his intent is <b>merely for the sake of peace [<i>shelamim</i>]</b> between himself and God. Why then does Rabbi Shimon say that this burnt offering does not fulfill the obligation of the owner?",
            "The Gemara rejects this challenge: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> the <b>offering itself is called <i>shelamim</i>, as it is written: “Who sacrifices the blood of the peace offering [<i>shelamim</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 7:33), and it is also written: <b>“Who sprinkles the blood of the peace offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:14). <b>Here,</b> by contrast, <b>is a meal offering itself called mixed?</b> It <b>is written: “And every meal offering, mixed with oil”</b> (Leviticus 7:10), indicating that there is a meal offering that <b>is called: Mixed with oil,</b> but <b>it is not simply called: Mixed.</b> One’s intent to sacrifice a dry meal offering for the sake of mixing is therefore not a reference to the offering itself.",
            "§ Three resolutions have been suggested for the apparent contradiction between the statements of Rabbi Shimon in two <i>baraitot</i> concerning whether or not a meal offering whose handful was removed not for its own sake fulfills the obligation of its owner. Rabba’s answer was that there is a difference between intent for another meal offering, in which case the owner fulfills his obligation, as the intent is recognizably improper, and intent for someone else, which is not recognizably improper. The Gemara comments: <b>All</b> the other Sages, i.e., Rava and Rav Ashi, <b>do not say as Rabba</b> did in resolving the contradiction, as they do not accept his reasoning, claiming <b>that on the contrary, the Merciful One disqualifies recognizably</b> false <b>intent.</b>",
            "The Gemara continues: Rava resolved the contradiction by saying that a meal offering from which a handful was removed for the sake of another meal offering effects acceptance for the owner, as the verse states: “And this is the law of the meal offering” (Leviticus 6:7), indicating that there is one law for all meal offerings, whereas a meal offering from which a handful was removed for the sake of an animal offering does not effect acceptance. Rabba and Rav Ashi <b>do not say as Rava</b> did in resolving the contradiction, as the verse that states: <b>“And this is the law</b> of the meal offering,” <b>does not indicate to them</b> that there should be one law for all meal offerings.",
            "The Gemara continues: Rav Ashi resolved the contradiction by saying that when one removes the handful from a meal offering for the sake of a vessel the meal offering effects acceptance for the owner, as intent concerning the vessel itself is inconsequential, whereas when one removes the handful for the sake of another meal offering, the meal offering does not fulfill the owner’s obligation. Rabba and Rava <b>did not say as Rav Ashi</b> did in resolving the contradiction <b>because of the difficulty</b> posed <b>by Rav Aḥa, son of Rava,</b> from a case where one removes the handful of a dry meal offering for the sake of a mixed one. Rabbi Shimon holds that such a meal offering fulfills the owner’s obligation even though his intent concerns the meal offering itself, not the vessel.",
            "The Gemara notes: <b>The matter that is obvious to Rabba in one way,</b> i.e., that with regard to meal offerings recognizably false intention is disregarded, but when the false intention is not recognizable the offering does not fulfill the owner’s obligation, <b>and</b> that is obvious <b>to Rava in the other way,</b> i.e., that in cases of recognizably false intention the offering should not fulfill the owner’s obligation, <b>is a dilemma for Rav Hoshaya.

            "Likewise, Rav Asi <b>did not resolve</b> the dilemma <b>in accordance with</b> the resolution stated by <b>Rava,</b> that the verse “And this is the law of the meal offering” teaches that a meal offering from which a handful was removed for the sake of another meal offering is valid, whereas a meal offering from which a handful was removed for the sake of an animal offering is disqualified.

            "§ The mishna teaches that all meal offerings from which a handful was removed not for their sake but for the sake of another meal offering are fit for sacrifice, <b>except for the meal offering of a sinner and the meal offering of jealousy.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, the meal offering of a sinner</b> is disqualified when a handful is removed from it not for its own sake, as <b>the Merciful One calls it a sin offering,</b> in the verse: <b>“He shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense upon it, for it is a sin offering.</b> And he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful” (Leviticus 5:11–12). This verse indicates that just as a sin offering is disqualified when sacrificed not for its own sake, so too, the meal offering of a sinner is disqualified when a handful is removed from it not for its own sake. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>the meal offering of jealousy, from where do we</b> derive that this is the <i>halakha</i>?",
            "The Gemara answers that this <i>halakha</i> may be derived from a <i>baraita</i>, <b>as a <i>tanna</i> taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Naḥman:</b> With regard to money that was designated for <b>a meal offering of jealousy, its surplus,</b> i.e., the money remaining after the purchase of the meal offering, is used to purchase communal <b>gift</b> offerings.",
            "Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: You are saying well,</b> as <b>it is written with regard to</b> a meal offering of jealousy: <b>“Bringing iniquity to remembrance”</b> (Numbers 5:15), <b>and it is written with regard to a sin offering: “And He has given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation”</b> (Leviticus 10:17). A verbal analogy is drawn between the two uses of the term “iniquity” in these verses. This teaches that <b>just as</b> in the case of <b>a sin offering, its surplus</b> is used to purchase communal <b>gift</b> offerings, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>a meal offering of jealousy, its surplus</b> is used to purchase communal <b>gift</b> offerings. <b>And</b> a meal offering of jealousy is also <b>like a sin offering</b> in another aspect: <b>Just as a sin offering is disqualified</b> when sacrificed <b>not for its own sake, so too, a meal offering of jealousy is disqualified</b> when a handful is removed from it <b>not for its own sake.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of a meal offering of jealousy is derived from a verbal analogy to a sin offering based on the word “iniquity,” then <b>a guilt offering should</b> also <b>be disqualified</b> if it was sacrificed <b>not for its own sake, as</b> a similar verbal analogy may be <b>derived from</b> the verse that states: “The <b>iniquity [<i>avon</i>]</b> of the congregation” (Leviticus 10:17), with regard to <b>a sin offering,</b> and the verse that states: “And shall bear his <b>iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 5:17), in connection with a guilt offering.",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>One derives</b> a verbal analogy based on the word <b>“iniquity” from</b> a verse that likewise uses the term <b>“iniquity,” but one does not derive</b> a verbal analogy based on the term <b>“his iniquity [<i>avono</i>]” from</b> a verse that uses the term <b>“iniquity.”</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What difference is</b> there? <b>Didn’t the school of Rabbi Yishmael teach</b> the following verbal analogy with regard to leprosy of houses? The verse states: <b>“And the priest shall return [<i>veshav</i>]</b> on the seventh day” (Leviticus 14:39), and another verse concerning the priest’s visit seven days later states: <b>“And the priest shall come [<i>uva</i>]</b> and look” (Leviticus 14:44). <b>This returning</b> and <b>this coming</b> have the same meaning, and one can therefore derive by verbal analogy that the <i>halakha</i> that applies if the leprosy had spread at the conclusion of the first week applies if it had spread again by the end of the following week. All the more so should a less pronounced difference of one letter between <i>avon</i> and <i>avono</i> not prevent the teaching of a verbal analogy.",
            "<b>And furthermore, let one derive</b> a verbal analogy through the term <b>“his iniquity”</b> stated with regard to a guilt offering, and the term <b>“his iniquity” from</b> the verse concerning the sin offering brought for the <b>iniquity for hearing the voice,</b> i.e., the sin offering of one who takes a false oath that he does not have any information relevant to a matter when another requests that he testify about it, <b>as it is written: “If he does not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 5:1).",
            "<b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>when the verbal analogy was derived, it was derived</b> only with regard <b>to</b> the <i>halakha</i> that the <b>surplus</b> from the money designated for a meal offering of jealousy is used to purchase communal <b>gift</b> offerings, and not with regard to the <i>halakha</i> that a meal offering of jealousy from which a handful was removed not for its own sake is disqualified.",
            "<b>And if you would say</b> that there is a principle that <b>there is no partial verbal analogy,</b> that principle does not apply in this instance.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if the Merciful One revealed that one cannot derive the <i>halakha</i> of other offerings that were sacrificed not for their sake from a sin offering, then <b>from where do we</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> <b>that the meal offering of a sinner and the meal offering of jealousy are disqualified</b> when a handful is removed from them <b>not for their sake?</b>",
            "The Gemara explains: With regard to <b>a sin offering, what is the reason</b> that it is disqualified when sacrificed not for its own sake? It is <b>because it is written with regard to</b> this offering: <b>“It,”</b> in a verse discussing the sin offering of the <i>Nasi</i>: “It is a sin offering” (Leviticus 4:24). This indicates that a sin offering is valid only when it is sacrificed for its own sake. <b>So too, it is written with regard to them,</b> i.e., the meal offering of a sinner and the meal offering of jealousy: <b>“It.”</b> In the case of the meal offering of a sinner the verse states: “It is a sin offering” (Leviticus 5:11), and with regard to the meal offering of jealousy it is written: “It is a meal offering of jealousy” (Numbers 5:15).",
            "The Gemara challenges: But if so, concerning <b>a guilt offering as well, it is written about</b> this offering: <b>“It,”</b> as the verse states: “It is a guilt offering” (Leviticus 7:5). Accordingly, a guilt offering should likewise be disqualified if it is slaughtered not for its own sake. The Gemara responds: <b>That</b> term <b>“it” is written with regard to</b> the stage <b>after the burning of</b> the <b>sacrificial portions [<i>eimurin</i>]</b> of a guilt offering, which are intended for burning upon the altar.",
            "<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One derives from the word “it” that if the offering was slaughtered not for its own sake it is disqualified only in the case of a sin offering. <b>But</b> concerning <b>a guilt offering, it is stated about</b> this offering: <b>“It</b> is a guilt offering,” <b>only</b> with regard to the stage <b>after the burning of</b> the <b>sacrificial portions.</b> The <i>baraita</i> adds: One cannot derive that if these portions were burned not for the sake of a guilt offering then the offering is disqualified, since the guilt offering <b>itself</b> is <b>valid</b> if <b>its sacrificial portions were not burned</b> upon the altar at all.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>why do I</b> need the word <b>“it”</b> stated with regard to a guilt offering?

            "The Gemara infers: If <b>it was consigned</b> to grazing, <b>yes,</b> it is fit if it was sacrificed as a burnt offering if slaughtered. By inference, if <b>it was not consigned</b> to grazing, it is <b>not</b> fit. What is the reason for this? <b>The verse states: “It</b> is a guilt offering,” indicating that <b>it shall</b> remain <b>as it is,</b> i.e., as a guilt offering, unless it is consigned by the court to another purpose.",
            "§ The mishna teaches that all the meal offerings from which a handful was removed not for their sake are fit for sacrifice but they do not fulfill the owner’s obligation.

            "§ The Gemara analyzes the statement of Rav. <b>The Master said: And so you say with regard to the guilt offering of a nazirite</b> who became ritually impure, <b>and</b> so you say with regard to <b>the guilt offering of a leper, that</b> if one <b>slaughtered</b> these offerings <b>not for their sake, they are disqualified.</b> They are disqualified <b>since</b> their proper sacrifice <b>came to render</b> the nazirite and leper <b>fit, and they did not render</b> them <b>fit.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 2a): <b>All slaughtered offerings that one slaughtered not for their sake are fit, but they did not satisfy the obligation of the owner.</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to all offerings <b>except for the Paschal offering and the sin offering,</b> which are disqualified when slaughtered not for their sake. <b>And if it is so</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the statement of Rav, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>also teach: Except for the guilt offering of a nazirite and the guilt offering of a leper, since they came to render</b> one <b>fit and they did not render</b> one <b>fit.</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Since there</b> are other guilt offerings, i.e., <b>the guilt offering for robbery,</b> which one brings for taking a false oath denying an accusation of robbery, <b>and the guilt offering</b> brought <b>for misuse</b> of consecrated property, <b>that come for atonement,</b> which do not render one fit and are fit for sacrifice if they were slaughtered not for their sake, the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna could <b>not</b> state the <i>halakha</i> with regard to guilt offerings in <b>an absolute</b> manner, and therefore he refrains from mentioning guilt offerings at all.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>the guilt offering of a nazirite and the guilt offering of a leper?</b> Why are they disqualified when slaughtered not for their sake <b>since they came to render fit and they did not render fit?

            "<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said</b> in response: <b>We find that the Torah differentiates between</b> those guilt offerings that <b>atone and</b> those that <b>render fit,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> is more stringent with regard to those that render fit. Rabbi Yirmeya elaborates: With regard to those guilt offerings that <b>atone, there are among them</b> offerings <b>that come after death,</b> i.e., they are sacrificed after the death of their owners, whereas with regard to those that <b>render fit, there are none among them that come after death. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kinnim</i> 2:5): With regard to <b>a woman</b> after childbirth <b>who brought her sin offering</b> for her ritual purification <b>and died, the heirs shall bring her burnt offering,</b>which comes to atone. If she set aside <b>her burnt offering and died, the heirs shall not bring her sin offering,</b> as it comes to render her fit to partake of offerings.",

This is <b>because</b> the coins <b>are all fit for bringing peace offerings,</b>and there is no misuse of consecrated property with regard to funds fit for a peace offering.",
            "The mishna continues: If the nazirite <b>died and he had undesignated funds</b> that he set aside to pay for his nazirite offerings without specifying how much money should be allocated toward each offering, <b>they will be allocated for</b> communal <b>gift</b> offerings.

            "The mishna concludes: With <b>the money for a peace offering, one brings a peace offering with it, and</b> these offerings <b>are eaten for one day,</b> like the peace offering brought by a nazirite, <b>and do not require</b> the <b>loaves</b> that are normally bought with the peace offering of a nazirite.

            "<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said</b> in response: <b>Reish Lakish holds</b> that an offering is <b>not</b> considered one <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived if it is to be brought <b>on that day.</b> Accordingly, since the new crop will be permitted for consumption on the same day that this handful was removed from the <i>omer</i> meal offering, it is already considered fit to be sacrificed upon the altar.",

            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And there is</b> a <i>halakha</i> that applies <b>to meal offerings</b> that does not apply to birds. <b>As meal offerings require</b> placement in a service <b>vessel, and</b> they require <b>waving and bringing,</b> i.e., they must be brought to the corner of the altar prior to removal of the handful. <b>And</b> lastly, <b>there are</b> meal offerings <b>of the community just as</b> there are meal offerings <b>of individuals,</b> e.g., the <i>omer</i> meal offering is a communal meal offering, <b>which is not so with regard to birds.</b> Bird offerings do not require the use of service vessels, they do not require waving or bringing, and there are no communal bird offerings.",

            "The Gemara notes: <b>And this</b> statement <b>of Reish Lakish was not stated explicitly; rather, it was stated by inference,</b> i.e., it is evident from a different statement of Reish Lakish that this is his opinion. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (68b): <b>One may not bring a meal offering, the first fruits, or the meal offering</b> brought with the libations accompanying <b>an animal</b> offering, from the new crop, <b>prior to</b> the sacrifice of <b>the <i>omer</i>.</b> The Gemara interrupts its citation of the mishna to add that the reason is <b>that we require</b> that an offering be <b>“from the well-watered pastures of Israel,”</b> i.e., it must be brought from that which is permitted to the Jewish people, and the new crop has not yet been permitted to them. The mishna concludes: <b>And if he brought</b> these offerings from the new crop they are <b>unfit.</b>",
            "The mishna continues: After the <i>omer</i> but <b>prior to the two loaves one may not bring</b> those offerings from the new crop.

            "<b>And Rav Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that a meal offering that was brought from the new crop before the <i>omer</i> meal offering is disqualified <b>only</b> if it was brought <b>on the fourteenth or on the fifteenth</b> of Nisan. <b>But</b> if it was <b>on the sixteenth,</b> then even <b>if he brought</b> it prior to the <i>omer</i> meal offering, it is <b>valid.</b> He continues: <b>And</b> this statement poses <b>a difficulty for me:</b> Why should meal offerings be valid when sacrificed on the sixteenth if they were sacrificed before the <i>omer</i> meal offering? <b>Let them be</b> considered <b>like</b> offerings <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived. The Gemara comments: <b>Apparently,</b> Reish Lakish <b>holds</b> that <b>the illumination of the eastern</b> horizon <b>permits</b> the new crop.",
            "§ The Gemara previously cited the opinion of Rav that an <i>omer</i> meal offering from which a handful was removed not for its own sake is disqualified. The Gemara also cited the opinion of Reish Lakish that this meal offering is valid but another <i>omer</i> meal offering is necessary to permit the new crop for consumption. <b>And Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>an <i>omer</i> meal offering</b> from <b>which</b> the priest <b>removed a handful not for its own sake,</b> it is <b>valid and its remainder is consumed, and it does not require another <i>omer</i> meal offering to permit it</b> for consumption.

            "Rava elaborates: The condition that improper intent disqualifies only when expressed <b>by one who is fit for the</b> Temple <b>service</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> the intent of <b>a blemished priest,</b> who is disqualified from performing the Temple service. The condition that it disqualifies only when expressed <b>with regard to an item that is fit for the</b> Temple <b>service</b> serves <b>to exclude the <i>omer</i> meal offering, which</b> is generally <b>unfit</b> for the Temple service, <b>as it is a novelty,</b> in that it is brought from barley whereas most meal offerings are brought from wheat. <b>And</b> finally, the condition that it disqualifies only when expressed <b>in a place that is fit for the</b> Temple <b>service</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> sacrificial rites that were performed with improper intent while <b>the altar was damaged.</b> At such a time improper intent does not disqualify an offering, and therefore if the altar is repaired on the same day, the offering may be sacrificed upon the altar.",
            "§ The Gemara discusses the prohibition against sacrificing an item that is prohibited to the Jewish people. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is derived from a passage in the Torah that discusses burnt offerings: “You shall bring your offering from the cattle, even from the herd or from the flock” (Leviticus 1:2), that certain animals are prohibited for sacrifice upon the altar (see <i>Temura</i> 28a). <b>When it states later,</b> in the next verse: “If his offering is a burnt offering <b>of the herd”</b> (Leviticus 1:3), this is difficult, <b>as</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> this, as it was already written earlier. <b>Rather,</b> this serves <b>to exclude an animal with a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>]</b> from being brought as an offering.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> questions the need for this derivation: <b>But could this not</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference? And if a blemished</b> animal, <b>which is permitted to an ordinary person [<i>lehedyot</i>]</b> for consumption, is nevertheless <b>prohibited</b> as an offering <b>for the Most High</b> (see Leviticus 22:19), then certainly with regard to <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, which is forbidden to an ordinary person</b> for consumption (see Exodus 22:30), <b>is it not logical that it is prohibited for the Most High?</b> The <i>baraita</i> responds: <b>Fat [<i>ḥelev</i>] and blood prove</b> that this <i>a fortiori</i> inference is not valid, <b>as they are forbidden to an ordinary person and</b> yet <b>they are permitted for the Most High.</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> rejects this suggestion: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about fat and blood?</b> They are notable <b>in that they come from</b> an item that is <b>generally permitted,</b> i.e., the animal from which they come is itself permitted for consumption. Will <b>you say</b> the same <b>with regard to a <i>tereifa</i>, which is entirely forbidden</b> for eating, <b>and</b> therefore <b>should not be permitted for the Most High?</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> responds: The <b>pinching</b> of bird offerings <b>will prove</b> that one cannot derive by means of an <i>a fortiori</i> inference that a <i>tereifa</i> is disqualified. <b>As</b> a bird killed by the pinching of its nape is also <b>entirely forbidden, and</b> yet although it is <b>forbidden</b> for consumption <b>to an ordinary person,</b> as it is rendered a carcass, it is nevertheless <b>permitted for the Most High,</b> as bird offerings are killed by the pinching of their napes. The verse is therefore necessary to disqualify a <i>tereifa</i>.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> rejects this suggestion as well: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about pinching?</b> It is notable <b>in that its sanctity prohibits it,</b> i.e., only <b>at the time</b> when <b>it</b> becomes <b>sanctified for the altar</b> does <b>it</b> become <b>prohibited</b> for consumption <b>to an ordinary person, which is</b> at the time of <b>its pinching. But before this</b> time it is <b>not</b> yet <b>prohibited to an ordinary person</b> for consumption. This <b>is not the case with regard to a <i>tereifa</i>, as its sanctity does not prohibit it</b> for consumption, since it is always prohibited to eat it. Accordingly, by logical inference alone one can arrive at the conclusion that a <i>tereifa</i> should not be permitted for the Most High.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> concludes with a statement that will soon be explained: <b>And if you have responded,</b> i.e., if you succeeded in rejecting the <i>a fortiori</i> inference, then <b>when</b> the verse <b>states later: “Of the herd”</b> (Leviticus 1:3), <b>as</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> this phrase, it serves <b>to exclude a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> response is alluded to by the statement: <b>If you have responded?</b> The conclusion of the <i>baraita</i> had indicated that the <i>a fortiori</i> inference must be accepted. The Gemara cites several suggestions, for which it provides the following <b>mnemonic: <i>Rekiaḥ</i>, <i>Mar</i>, <i>Adda</i>, <i>Leshisheih</i>.</b> These terms allude to the names of some of the Sages mentioned in the following discussion: Rav; Rabbi Akiva; Rav Aḥa; Mar, son of Ravina; Rav Adda; and Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi.",
            "<b>Rav said</b> that this is the response: The <i>halakha</i> that a <i>tereifa</i> is unfit for sacrifice must be derived from a verse <b>because it may be said</b> that <b>the <i>omer</i> meal offering proves</b> that the <i>halakha</i> concerning a <i>tereifa</i> cannot be derived by the <i>a fortiori</i> inference, <b>as</b> the <i>omer</i> is <b>prohibited</b> for consumption <b>to an ordinary person,</b> since it comes from the new crop, <b>and</b> yet it is <b>permitted</b> as an offering <b>for the Most High.</b> The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about the <i>omer</i> meal offering?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> the <i>omer</i> <b>renders</b> the <b>new</b> crop <b>permitted</b> for consumption, whereas a <i>tereifa</i> does not render anything permitted.",
            "The Gemara responds: Although the <i>omer</i> meal offering generally renders the new crop permitted, the <i>omer</i> brought <b>during a Sabbatical Year</b> does not render the crop permitted, as it is prohibited to plant during the Sabbatical Year, and consequently there is no new crop for the <i>omer</i> offering to permit. The Gemara counters this suggestion: The <i>omer</i> meal offering brought during <b>a Sabbatical Year also</b> renders something permitted, <b>as it permits produce that grew without being purposely planted [<i>sefiḥin</i>] during the Sabbatical Year.</b> The Gemara responds: Nevertheless, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says</b> that <b><i>sefiḥin</i> are prohibited during the Sabbatical Year,</b> the <i>omer</i> meal offering brought during a Sabbatical Year does not render the new crop permitted for consumption, and yet it is permitted for the Most High. A verse is therefore necessary to derive that a <i>tereifa</i> may not be sacrificed.",
            "<b>Rav Aḥa bar Abba said to Rav Ashi: According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva as well, let us refute</b> the statement of Rav, as <b>what</b> is notable <b>about the <i>omer</i> meal offering?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> the <i>omer</i> <b>permits</b> the <b>new</b> crop for consumption <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, where the prohibitions of the Sabbatical Year do not apply.",
            "<b>And even according to the one who says</b> that the consumption of produce from the <b>new</b> crop grown <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael is <b>not</b> prohibited <b>by Torah law,</b> Rav’s statement can be refuted in another manner: What is notable about the <i>omer</i> meal offering? It is notable <b>in that</b> the <i>omer</i> <b>comes to permit a prohibition</b> that applies to a substance <b>that</b> was previously <b>within it,</b> i.e., the burning upon the altar of a handful from the <i>omer</i> meal offering renders the remainder of the meal offering permitted to the priests, whereas a <i>tereifa</i> is entirely forbidden.",
            "<b>Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina:</b> This is not a refutation, as, <b>if that is so,</b> then with regard to <b>a <i>tereifa</i> as well, you should sacrifice</b> it <b>and you will</b> thereby <b>permit a prohibition</b> that applies to a substance <b>that</b> was previously <b>within it,</b> and its meat will become permitted to the priests for consumption. Therefore, a verse is needed to exclude a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Rather,</b> one can <b>refute</b> the statement of Rav <b>like this: What</b> is notable <b>about the <i>omer</i> meal offering?</b> It is notable <b>in that its mitzva is in this</b> manner, i.e., the Torah requires the <i>omer</i> meal offering to be brought from the new crop in order to permit the new crop for consumption.

            "<b>Rather,</b> this permitting the general prohibition found in the context of a <i>tereifa</i> is referring to the <i>halakha</i> that the <b>pinching of a bird sin offering</b> renders it permitted <b>to the priests</b> for consumption despite the fact that it was not slaughtered by cutting its neck with a knife. This claim can be refuted as well, as the <b>priests receive</b> their portion <b>from the table of the Most High,</b> i.e., they may partake of the sin offering only because it was permitted for sacrifice upon the altar. Accordingly, there is no difference between a <i>tereifa</i> due to pinching and a blemished bird, as both were released from their general prohibition in this regard, since both are permitted for sacrifice upon the altar and both are therefore permitted for consumption by the priests. Consequently, the <i>a fortiori</i> inference remains valid, and the verse is unnecessary.",
            "<b>Rather, refute</b> the <i>a fortiori</i> inference <b>like this: What</b> is notable <b>about their common element?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> with regard to both a blemished animal and one born by caesarean section <b>their blemish is noticeable,</b> as a blemished animal is visibly blemished and it is well known when an animal is born by caesarean section. <b>Will you say</b> that they can serve as the source of the <i>halakha</i> <b>of a <i>tereifa</i>, whose blemish is not</b> necessarily <b>noticeable? Due to that</b> reason, <b>the verse:</b> “Of the herd” (Leviticus 1:3), <b>was necessary,</b> to teach that a <i>tereifa</i> is unfit for sacrifice.",
            "§ After trying to prove why a derivation from a verse is necessary, the Gemara questions the very source provided by the <i>baraita</i> on 5b for the disqualification of a <i>tereifa</i>, i.e., the verse: “Of the herd” (Leviticus 1:3). <b>But</b> is the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b> is unfit for sacrifice <b>derived from here?

            "Alternatively, this <i>halakha</i> can be <b>derived from</b> a verse discussing animal tithe offerings: <b>“Whatever passes under the rod,</b> the tenth shall be holy for the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32). This teaches that all animals may be sacrificed as the animal tithe, <b>excluding a <i>tereifa</i>, as it does not pass</b> under the rod on account of its weakness, and the Sages derived from this the <i>halakha</i> that a <i>tereifa</i> is unfit for any type of offering.",
            "The Gemara responds: All of these verses <b>are necessary, because if</b> the disqualification of a <i>tereifa</i> was derived <b>from</b> the verse <b>“the well-watered pastures of Israel,” I would say</b> that this verse serves <b>to exclude</b> a <i>tereifa</i> only in a case <b>where it did not have a period of fitness,</b> e.g., if it was born a <i>tereifa</i> and was therefore never fit for sacrifice. This is <b>similar to</b> the case of <b>the fruit of a tree during the first three years after its planting [<i>orla</i>] and diverse kinds</b> planted <b>in a vineyard,</b> whose disqualification is derived from this verse. <b>But</b> with regard to a <i>tereifa</i> that <b>had a period of fitness,</b> one might <b>say</b> that <b>it should be fit.</b> Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes: “Whatever passes</b> under the rod,” to teach that all animals that do not pass under the rod are unfit for sacrifice, even if they were once fit.",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> i.e., if the mishna is referring to a handful that is lacking, then the statement of the mishna: <b>Ben Beteira says he must return</b> the handful to the vessel with the meal offering <b>and again remove a handful with</b> his <b>right</b> hand, is imprecise, as the mishna <b>should have</b> taught: <b>Ben Beteira says he must return</b> the handful to the vessel with the meal offering <b>and bring</b> flour <b>from within his house and refill</b> the missing amount, <b>and again remove a handful with</b> his <b>right</b> hand.",
            "The Gemara therefore suggests a different answer: <b>When Rav said</b> that the handful is returned to the meal offering, he said this only <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>ben Beteira.</b> The Gemara asks: But isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that this is the opinion of ben Beteira? The Gemara responds: Rav’s statement is necessary <b>lest you say</b> that <b>ben Beteira deems</b> the meal offering <b>fit only</b> when the handful was removed <b>with</b> one’s <b>left</b> hand, <b>but with regard to other disqualifications,</b> he does <b>not</b> deem it fit. Therefore, Rav <b>teaches us</b> that with regard to all of the disqualifications cited in the mishna, ben Beteira holds that the handful is returned to the meal offering whereupon a new handful is removed from it and sacrificed upon the altar.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> in the case of a handful removed with a priest’s <b>left</b> hand that one might have thought that ben Beteira’s opinion applies only in this case? Perhaps the reason is <b>that we find</b> that the Temple service performed with the priest’s left hand is <b>fit on Yom Kippur,</b> i.e., when the High Priest would enter the Holy of Holies holding the vessel containing the incense in his left hand. But with regard to <b>a non-priest as well, we find</b> that the Temple service is <b>fit with regard to slaughter,</b> as an offering may be slaughtered by a non-priest. Why then is it necessary for Rav to teach that the opinion of ben Beteira applies to the case of a non-priest as well?",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>Slaughter is not</b> considered a sacrificial <b>rite,</b> and it is for that reason that a non-priest may slaughter an offering. Accordingly, without the statement of Rav one would not have concluded that ben Beteira holds that a handful removed by a non-priest may be returned, as the Temple service is never fit when performed by a non-priest.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is slaughter really <b>not</b> considered a sacrificial rite? <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Zeira say</b> that <b>Rav says: The slaughter of</b> a red <b>heifer by a non-priest</b> is <b>not valid? And Rav said with regard to this</b> <i>halakha</i>: This is because both the term: <b>“Elazar</b> the priest” (Numbers 19:3), <b>and</b> the term: <b>“Statute”</b> (Numbers 19:2), <b>are written in</b> the Torah’s description of the slaughter of the red heifer. The term “statute” indicates that if one deviates from any of the details of the service as delineated in the verses, the service is not valid. The Gemara answers: The <i>halakhot</i> of the red <b>heifer are different, as</b> the heifer <b>is</b> considered <b>sanctified for</b> the purpose of <b>Temple maintenance,</b> not for sacrifice upon the altar. Accordingly, one cannot derive from the case of the red heifer that the slaughter of an offering is considered a sacrificial rite.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But is it not all the more so?</b> If items <b>sanctified for</b> the purpose of <b>Temple maintenance require</b> that the performance of rites relevant to them be performed by a member of the <b>priesthood,</b> then with regard to items <b>sanctified for</b> sacrifice upon the <b>altar, shouldn’t they</b> certainly <b>require</b> that their rites be performed by a member of the <b>priesthood?

Rather, that requirement is <b>just as it is in</b> the case of examination of the <b>shades of</b> leprous <b>marks, which is</b> obviously <b>not</b> considered a sacrificial <b>rite, and</b> yet the Torah <b>requires</b> that these marks be examined by a member of the <b>priesthood.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: Nevertheless, why was it necessary for Rav to teach that the removal of a handful by a non-priest does not disqualify the meal offering according to ben Beteira? <b>Let us derive</b> it <b>from</b> the fact that there was a period of fitness for rites performed by a non-priest, as before the construction of the Temple it was permitted for non-priests to sacrifice offerings upon a private <b>altar.</b>",
            "<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>we do not derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> of the rites performed in the Temple <b>from</b> those performed on a private <b>altar,</b> one can respond: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived with regard to an item, e.g., the limbs of an offering, <b>that emerged</b> from the Temple courtyard and was thereby rendered unfit for sacrifice upon the altar, <b>that if</b> it nevertheless <b>ascended</b> upon the altar <b>it shall not descend?</b> It is derived from the fact <b>that</b> an item that <b>emerged is valid</b> for sacrifice <b>on</b> a private <b>altar.</b> This indicates that one can learn the <i>halakhot</i> of offerings in the Temple from the <i>halakhot</i> of a private altar.",
            "The Gemara rejects this: The <b><i>tanna</i></b> of that <i>baraita</i> <b>relies on</b> the verse: <b>“This is the law of the burnt offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:2), from which it is derived that any item that ascends upon the altar shall not descend from it, even if it was disqualified. In other words, the verse is the source for the <i>halakha</i> of the <i>baraita</i>, whereas the case of a private altar is cited merely as a support for this ruling.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, the reason</b> it is known that ben Beteira permits the return to the meal offering of a handful removed by a non-priest is <b>that Rav taught us</b> so. Were it <b>not</b> for <b>this, I would say</b> that <b>with regard to other disqualifications,</b> i.e., other than a handful removed with the left hand, <b>ben Beteira invalidates</b> the meal offering. <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> both <b>say: Ben Beteira would deem fit in</b> the case of <b>all the</b> other <b>disqualifications</b> listed in the mishna?",
            "The Gemara continues: <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests; <b>and he shall remove from there</b> his handful” (Leviticus 2:2), that this verse indicates that the removal of a handful from a meal offering may be performed <b>from the place where the feet of the non-priest stand,</b> i.e., anywhere within the Temple courtyard.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Ben Beteira says</b> that the verse should be interpreted as follows: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> one <b>removed a handful with</b> his <b>left</b> hand, <b>that he must return</b> the handful to the vessel with the meal offering <b>and again remove the handful with</b> his <b>right</b> hand? It is derived from that which <b>the verse states: “And he shall remove from there,”</b> indicating that the handful is removed <b>from the place where he already removed</b> it, i.e., the handful is returned to the meal offering and thereupon removed from the same meal offering with the right hand. This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.",
            "The Gemara explains the difficulty from the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And since the verse is written</b> in an <b>unspecified</b> manner, i.e., it does not mention which handfuls are returned, <b>what</b> difference is it <b>to me</b> if the handful was removed with the <b>left</b> hand, <b>and what</b> difference is it <b>to me</b> if it was removed by means of one of <b>the other disqualifications?</b>",
            "The Gemara therefore suggests an alternative explanation: <b>Rather, this</b> is what <b>Rav teaches us:</b> Ben Beteira holds that if one unfit for Temple service <b>removed a handful</b> it may be returned to the meal offering <b>even</b> if <b>he sanctified</b> the handful by placing it in a service vessel. <b>And</b> the statement of Rav serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of these <i>tanna’im</i>: As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Yosei ben Yasiyyan and Rabbi Yehuda the baker said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement</b> of ben Beteira <b>said,</b> i.e., in which case does he rule that the handful may be returned to the meal offering? It is in a case <b>where</b> the unfit individual <b>removed a handful and did not sanctify</b> it by placing it inside a service vessel. <b>But</b> if <b>he sanctified</b> it then <b>he</b> has <b>disqualified</b> it, even according to ben Beteira, and it may not be returned to the meal offering.",
            "<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that Rav teaches the opposite, that if an unfit person merely <b>removed a handful, yes,</b> ben Beteira permits such a handful to be returned to the meal offering from which it was removed, but if he already <b>sanctified</b> the handful by placing it inside a service vessel, it may <b>not</b> be returned. <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this explanation? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>these <i>tanna’im</i>,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yosei ben Yosei ben Yasiyyan and Rabbi Yehuda the baker, <b>and</b> it is <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of the first <i>tanna</i></b> in that <i>baraita</i>, who disagrees with the ruling of Rabbi Yosei ben Yosei ben Yasiyyan and Rabbi Yehuda the baker and maintains that a handful may be returned even after it was sanctified by a service vessel.",
            "<b>Rav Naḥman objects to this: What do these <i>tanna’im</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>hold? If</b> they hold that <b>the removal of a handful by</b> one <b>unfit</b> for Temple service <b>is</b> considered the performance of a sacrificial <b>rite</b> to the extent that it disqualifies the offering, then the meal offering should be disqualified <b>even though he did not perform</b> the stage of the <b>placement</b> of the handful <b>in a vessel.</b> And <b>if</b> they hold that <b>the removal of a handful by an unfit</b> individual <b>is not</b> considered the performance of a <b>rite,</b> then <b>when he performed</b> the stage of <b>its placement in a vessel, what</b> significance <b>was</b> there to this action? He can still return the handful to the meal offering.",
            "<b>Rav Naḥman</b> reconsidered and <b>then said: Actually,</b> those <i>tanna’im</i> hold that the removal of a handful by one unfit for Temple service <b>is</b> considered the performance of a sacrificial <b>rite, but the rite of</b> the handful <b>is not complete until he performs</b> the stage of <b>its placement in a vessel.</b> Consequently, the meal offering is disqualified only after a person unfit for Temple service places the handful inside a service vessel.",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>If so,</b> i.e., if the placement of the handful inside a service vessel completes the rite that begins with the handful’s removal, then <b>even</b> if the handful was removed by an unfit individual who has <b>not</b> yet <b>sanctified</b> it in the service vessel designated for the handful,"
        ],
        [
            "<b>when he returns the handful to its</b> former <b>place</b> in the service vessel that contains the meal offering <b>it should become sanctified,</b> as it is now placed inside a service vessel, <b>and it should</b> therefore <b>become disqualified.</b> It should not matter whether the handful was placed in the vessel designated for it, or back in the same vessel it was taken from.",
            "Concerning this challenge, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: That is to say</b> that <b>service vessels sanctify</b> items placed in them <b>only</b> when they are placed there <b>with</b> specific <b>intent</b> that they be sanctified by that vessel. Since the priest does not return the handful to the vessel containing the meal offering with such intent, the handful is not disqualified, because the rite was not completed.",
            "The Gemara asks: It may be inferred from this statement that if items are placed into service vessels <b>with intent,</b> the service vessels <b>sanctify</b> them. <b>But</b> didn’t <b>Reish Lakish raise a dilemma before Rabbi Yoḥanan: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>service vessels,</b> i.e., do they <b>sanctify disqualified</b> items to the extent that they may be <b>sacrificed</b> upon the altar <b><i>ab initio</i>? And</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him</b> that <b>they do not sanctify</b> the items. The Gemara responds: This is what Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: They do not sanctify</b> the disqualified items that are placed inside them <b>to</b> the extent that they may be <b>sacrificed, but they</b> do <b>sanctify</b> them <b>to</b> the extent <b>that</b> they <b>are disqualified.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Amram says:</b> Even if service vessels sanctify items without specific intent, it is possible to return the handful to the meal offering without the vessel sanctifying the handful, <b>such as</b> in a case <b>where he returned it to a heaped bowl [<i>levisa</i>],</b> i.e., he placed the handful upon the heap of flour in such a manner that the handful did not enter the airspace of the vessel containing the meal offering. Consequently, the handful is not sanctified by the vessel.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if the meal offering was heaped, <b>how</b> was he initially able to <b>remove a handful</b> from it? The handful must initially be removed from within a vessel. <b>Rather,</b> it is possible to return the handful without sanctifying it in a case <b>where he returned it to a full [<i>tefufa</i>] bowl,</b> i.e., it was full to the brim but not heaped. When the priest initially removes a handful from such a vessel, he removes it from inside the vessel, but when it is returned, it does not enter the airspace of the vessel.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But once he removed a handful, he formed a furrow</b> in the surface of the meal offering, and therefore <b>when he returns</b> the handful to its previous place inside the vessel, <b>he is</b> in fact <b>returning it to</b> a spot <b>within the vessel,</b> i.e., the furrow. If so, the handful should be sanctified to the extent that the vessel disqualifies it. The Gemara responds: <b>When he returns it</b> to the vessel containing the meal offering, he does not place it directly in the furrow. Rather, he <b>lays it on the wall of the vessel and moves</b> the vessel, <b>and</b> the handful <b>falls by itself</b> into the furrow. In this manner, <b>it is as though a monkey</b> rather than a person <b>returned</b> the handful to the furrow, and the handful is therefore not sanctified.",
            "§ The Gemara returns to its discussion of the opinion of ben Beteira. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said to Rabbi Zeira: And let</b> one <b>interpret</b> ben Beteira’s ruling as speaking of a case in which the handful is not sanctified by the vessel containing the meal offering, <b>such as where he returned it to a vessel that is resting upon</b> the <b>ground. Rather,</b> the fact that this was not suggested indicates that service vessels sanctify items placed inside them even while resting on the ground. Is it correct to <b>conclude from</b> here that <b>one may remove a handful</b> of a meal offering <b>from</b> a service <b>vessel that</b> is resting <b>upon</b> the <b>ground?</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: You have touched upon a dilemma that was</b> already <b>raised before us, when Rabbi Avimi</b> was <b>learning</b> tractate <b><i>Menaḥot</i></b> in the <b>study hall of Rav Ḥisda.</b>",
            "The Gemara interrupts this statement with a question: <b>And</b> did Rabbi <b>Avimi</b> really <b>learn</b> in the <b>study hall of Rav Ḥisda? But didn’t Rav Ḥisda say: I absorbed many blows [<i>kulfei</i>] from Avimi</b> as a result <b>of that <i>halakha</i>,</b> i.e., Avimi would mock me when I questioned his statements with regard to the sale of orphans’ property by the courts, which were contradictory to the ruling of a particular <i>baraita</i>. Avimi explained to me that if the court <b>comes to announce</b> such a sale on <b>consecutive</b> days, then it is announced for <b>thirty days,</b> in accordance with that <i>baraita</i>. But if it will be announced only on <b>Monday, Thursday, and Monday,</b> then it is announced over the course of <b>sixty days.</b> If so, Rav Ḥisda was in fact the pupil while Rabbi Avimi was his teacher.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Avimi</b> was in fact the teacher, but <b>tractate</b> <i>Menaḥot</i> <b>was uprooted for him,</b> i.e., he forgot it, <b>and</b> Avimi <b>came before</b> his student <b>Rav Ḥisda to</b> help him <b>recall his learning.</b> The Gemara asks: If Rav Ḥisda was in fact Avimi’s student, <b>let</b> Avimi <b>send for him and</b> Rav Ḥisda <b>come to</b> Avimi. The Gemara responds: Avimi <b>thought</b> that <b>this</b> would be <b>more helpful</b> in this <b>matter,</b> i.e., that by exerting the effort to travel to his pupil in order to learn from him, he would better retain his studies.",
            "The Gemara returns to the statement of Rabbi Zeira: <b>Rav Naḥman encountered</b> Avimi upon his return from the study hall of Rav Ḥisda. Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: How</b> does one properly <b>remove a handful</b> from a meal offering? Avimi pointed to a vessel that was resting on the ground and <b>said to him: From this vessel</b> one may properly remove a handful. Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: But may one remove a handful from a vessel that</b> is resting <b>upon</b> the <b>ground?</b> Avimi <b>said to him:</b> When I said that such a vessel may be used, I meant <b>that</b> one <b>priest</b> would first <b>raise it</b> from the ground and then another priest would remove a handful from it.",
            "Rav Naḥman proceeded to ask Avimi another question: <b>How</b> does one properly <b>sanctify the meal offerings?</b> Avimi pointed to a vessel that was resting on the ground and <b>said to him:</b> The priest <b>places it into this vessel.</b> Rav Naḥman again said to him: <b>But can one sanctify</b> a meal offering <b>in a vessel that</b> is resting <b>upon</b> the <b>ground?</b> Avimi <b>said to him:</b> When I said that such a vessel may be used, I meant <b>that</b> another <b>priest</b> would initially <b>raise it</b> from the ground, and only then would the meal offering be placed inside it.",
            "Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Avimi: <b>If so,</b> then <b>you require</b> the involvement of <b>three priests,</b> i.e., one to raise the vessel, one to sanctify the meal offering, and one to remove the handful from the meal offering. Avimi <b>said to him: And let it require</b> even <b>thirteen</b> priests, <b>just as</b> the service of the <b>daily</b> burnt <b>offering</b> required the involvement of thirteen priests. The need for several priests presents no difficulty.",
            "Rav Naḥman <b>raised</b> another <b>objection</b> to the statement of Avimi from a mishna (12a) that discusses the <i>halakha</i> that improper intentions during the service of a meal offering disqualify it. <b>This is the principle:</b> In the case of <b>anyone who removes the handful, or places</b> the handful <b>in the vessel,</b> or <b>who conveys</b> the vessel with the handful to the altar, <b>or who burns</b> the handful on the altar, with the intent <b>to partake of an item whose</b> typical <b>manner</b> is such that one <b>partakes</b> of it, or to burn an item whose typical manner is such that one burns it on the altar, e.g., the handful or the frankincense, outside its designated area, the meal offering is unfit but there is no liability for excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>].",
            "Rav Naḥman explained his objection: All the rites of a meal offering are taught in the mishna, <b>and yet raising</b> the vessel from the ground <b>is not taught.</b> This indicates that there is no requirement to raise a vessel from the ground in order to use it for the service of a meal offering. Avimi responded: The <b><i>tanna</i> cited the order of</b> sacrificial <b>rites,</b> i.e., those rites concerning which improper intentions disqualify a meal offering, <b>but</b> he did <b>not</b> cite <b>the order of the priests,</b> i.e., he did not cite the total number of priests involved in the service.",
            "On the same topic, the Sages <b>raised a dilemma before Rav Sheshet: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the permissibility of <b>removing a handful from a vessel that</b> is resting <b>upon</b> the <b>ground?</b> Is this removal valid? Rav Sheshet <b>said to</b> one of the Sages who raised the dilemma: <b>Go out</b> and <b>see what they do within</b> the Sanctuary when they remove the bowls containing the frankincense that were placed upon the Table of the shewbread in order to burn the frankincense upon the altar. The mishna (99b) states: When the priests would replace the shewbread every Shabbat, <b>four priests</b> would <b>enter</b> the Sanctuary, <b>two</b> with the <b>two arrangements</b> of the new shewbread <b>in their hands and two</b> with the <b>two bowls</b> of frankincense <b>in their hands.

        ],
        [
            "Rav Sheshet notes: The entire process of the replacement of the shewbread is taught in the mishna, <b>and yet</b> the statement: A priest <b>raises the Table</b> above the ground so that the bowls of frankincense can be properly removed from them, <b>is not taught.</b> One can therefore conclude from the mishna that just as the bowls of frankincense are removed from a vessel that is resting upon the ground, i.e., the Table, so too, one may remove a handful of a meal offering from a vessel that is resting upon the ground.",
            "The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Didn’t you</b> already <b>say there,</b> with regard to the mishna that discusses improper intentions expressed during the service of a meal offering (12a), that the <i>tanna</i> <b>cited</b> only <b>the order of</b> sacrificial <b>rites?

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rava</b> really <b>say this,</b> that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the sanctification of a handful is derived from the collection of the blood? <b>But it was stated:</b> With regard to a full measure of <b>a handful that</b> a priest <b>divided</b> and placed <b>in two vessels, Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>it is not sanctified, and Rava says</b> that it is <b>sanctified.

The Gemara responds: <b>Rava retracted that</b> statement and ruled that a handful is not sanctified when divided and placed into two vessels.",
            "The Gemara further discusses the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the collection of the blood. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>blood, from where do we</b> derive <b>that it is not sanctified in halves,</b> i.e., when collected in two vessels?

Even if he subsequently combines the contents of both vessels into a single vessel, the water is not sanctified.",
            "The Gemara continues: <b>And a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>With regard to</b> the collection of <b>blood</b> of a sin offering for the purpose of sprinkling it upon the altar, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Is</b> the ruling with regard to the water of purification <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai, in which case the <i>halakha</i> with regard to blood may not be derived from it, as <b>we do not derive</b> other cases <b>from a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai?",
            "The Gemara explains the other side of the dilemma: <b>Or perhaps, there,</b> in the case of the water of purification, <b>what is the reason</b> that it is not sanctified? It is possible that the reason is <b>that it is written</b> in a verse that is referring to the water initially placed in the vessel: <b>“And dip it in the water”</b> (Numbers 19:18). If this verse is the source of the <i>halakha</i> that the hyssop may be dipped in the water of purification only when there was initially enough water in the vessel for sprinkling, then <b>here too,</b> in the case of the blood of a sin offering, <b>isn’t it written: “And</b> the priest <b>shall dip</b> his finger <b>in the blood”</b> (Leviticus 4:6)?",
            "The Gemara continues: <b>And it was stated</b> with regard to this dilemma: <b>Rabbi Zerika says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Even in</b> the case of the <b>blood, one has not sanctified</b> it if he collected less than a full measure of blood in a single vessel. <b>Rava said</b> that <b>this is also taught in</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to</b> the bull of <b>the anointed priest.</b> The verse states: “And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood” (Leviticus 4:6). From the term <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall dip”</b> it is derived that there must be enough blood inside the vessel in which to dip his finger, <b>and</b> there should <b>not</b> be so little blood that he must resort to <b>wiping</b> his finger along the walls of the vessel.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: Additionally, from the term <b>“in the blood”</b> it is derived <b>that there should initially be in</b> the vessel containing <b>the blood a measure</b> fit for <b>dipping</b> his finger. Furthermore, it is derived from the term <b>“of the blood”</b> that he must sprinkle <b>from the blood of the matter,</b> as will be explained.",
            "<b>And it was necessary</b> for the Merciful One <b>to write: “And</b> the priest <b>shall dip,” and it was necessary</b> for the Merciful One <b>to write: “In the blood,”</b> despite the fact that both terms are referring to the amount of blood that must be in the vessel. <b>Because if the Merciful One had written</b> only: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall dip,” I would say</b> that it is enough if the vessel contains enough blood for even one sprinkling, <b>even though</b> the priest <b>did not initially collect a measure</b> fit for all of the <b>sprinklings, that is,</b> enough with which to <b>sprinkle seven times.</b> Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes: “In the blood.”</b>",

            "The Gemara returns to the last statement of the <i>baraita</i>, that the priest must sprinkle <b>from the blood of the matter.</b> This statement serves <b>to exclude what?

The Gemara notes: This <b>supports</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar, who says</b> that the <b>remainder</b> of blood <b>that</b> remained <b>on</b> the priest’s <b>finger is unfit</b> for sprinkling.",

And if you would say</b> that in this case <b>Rabbi Elazar does not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the <b>matter</b> of a meal offering <b>from</b> that of another <b>matter,</b> that is difficult: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Elazar say: A meal offering</b> from <b>which</b> the priest <b>removed a handful</b> while <b>inside the Sanctuary</b> is <b>valid,</b> despite the fact that the handful should be removed in the Temple courtyard; the reason is <b>that we find</b> a similar case in the Sanctuary, <b>with regard to the removal of</b> the <b>bowls</b> of frankincense from the Table of the shewbread? Just as the bowls permit the shewbread for consumption when removed in the Sanctuary, so too, the handful permits the remainder of the meal offering for consumption. This indicates that Rabbi Elazar does derive the <i>halakha</i> of a meal offering from that of another matter.",
            "The Gemara responds: Rabbi Elazar does <b>derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a meal offering from</b> that of another <b>meal offering;</b> the shewbread is considered a meal offering. But <b>he does not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a meal offering from</b> that of <b>blood.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And does</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of one <b>meal offering from</b> that of another <b>meal offering? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>before</b> the priest <b>detached</b> the arrangement of shewbread and the bowls of frankincense from upon the Table, the <b>bread broke</b> into pieces, <b>the bread</b> is <b>unfit</b> for consumption <b>and</b> the priest <b>does not burn the</b> frankincense contained in the <b>bowls on</b> account of <b>it.</b> If the <b>bread broke after</b> the priest <b>detached it, the bread is unfit but</b> the priest <b>burns the</b> frankincense contained in the <b>bowls on</b> account of <b>it.</b>",
            "The Gemara continues: <b>And Rabbi Elazar says:</b> When the <i>baraita</i> refers to the detachment of the shewbread, it does <b>not</b> mean that the priest <b>actually detached it. Rather,</b> it means that <b>once</b> the <b>time to detach it has arrived, even though he has not</b> yet <b>detached it</b> and has not removed the bowls, <b>it is considered as though he has detached it.</b> Accordingly, if the shewbread broke after that time, the frankincense is burned.",
            "The Gemara explains its question: <b>And</b> if Rabbi Elazar derives the <i>halakha</i> of one meal offering from another, <b>why</b> does he say that frankincense contained in the bowls are burned in a case where the shewbread broke when the time to detach the bread had arrived? <b>It should be like</b> the case of <b>a meal offering that became lacking</b> in its measure <b>before the removal of the handful.</b> Such a handful is not removed and is not sacrificed upon the altar. Likewise, the frankincense was still on the Table when the shewbread broke and should therefore be disqualified.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as there is a difference between these meal offerings. In the case of <b>a meal offering</b> that became lacking before the removal of a handful, <b>its handful was not clearly designated.</b> Consequently, if the meal offering became lacking before a handful was removed, one may no longer remove a handful from it. <b>But</b> in the case of the shewbread and the bowls of frankincense, <b>its handful,</b> i.e., the frankincense, <b>was clearly designated</b> at the time when the frankincense was placed in the bowls, since the frankincense is in a separate container from the bread. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>once</b> the <b>time to detach</b> the bread <b>has arrived, it is considered as though he has detached it.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: But <b>if that is so,</b> then even if the time to detach the shewbread arrived, why is the frankincense burned? <b>It should be like</b> a case where the <b>remainder</b> of a meal offering <b>became lacking between</b> the <b>removal of the handful and</b> the <b>burning</b> upon the altar; the <i>halakha</i> in this case is <b>that</b> one <b>does not burn the handful on</b> account of such a meal offering. The Gemara responds: <b>Isn’t it a dispute</b> among the <i>amora’im</i> (9a) whether or not the handful is burned in such a case? One can say that <b>Rabbi Elazar holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the one who says</b> that if the <b>remainder</b> of a meal offering became <b>lacking between</b> the <b>removal of the handful and</b> the <b>burning,</b> the priest <b>burns the handful on</b> account of such a meal offering.",
            "§ The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself:</b> With regard to the <b>griddle-cake</b> offering <b>of</b> the <b>High Priest, Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>it is not sanctified in halves, and Rabbi Elazar says: Since it is sacrificed in halves,</b> as half of the meal offering is sacrificed in the morning and half in the afternoon, it may likewise be <b>sanctified in halves. Rav Aḥa said: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yoḥanan? The verse states: “A meal offering</b> perpetually, <b>half of it</b> in the morning, and half of it in the evening” (Leviticus 6:13). This means: First <b>bring</b> a whole <b>meal offering, and</b> only <b>afterward divide it</b> into halves.",
            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rabbi Elazar. The mishna teaches (50b): The <b>griddle-cake</b> offering <b>of</b> the <b>High Priest did not come in halves. Rather,</b> the High Priest <b>brings a full tenth</b> of an ephah <b>and</b> then <b>divides it</b> into two. <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to this mishna: <b>If it were stated: A meal offering, half</b> in the morning, and half in the evening, <b>I would say: He brings half of a tenth from his home</b> in the <b>morning and sacrifices</b> it, and another <b>half of a tenth from his home</b> in the <b>evening and sacrifices</b> it. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Half of it in the morning,”</b> indicating that <b>he brings a half from a whole,</b> and he does not bring a half by itself.",
            "The Gemara responds: Rabbi Elazar maintains that the verse requires that a whole meal offering be brought in the morning only <b>for a mitzva,</b> i.e., <i>ab initio</i>. Nevertheless, if half of a tenth was brought in the morning it is valid after the fact. <b>Rav Geviha from Bei Katil said to Rav Ashi: But</b> the term <b>“statute” is written with regard to</b> the griddle-cake offering, as the verse states: “A statute forever” (Leviticus 6:15), and there is a principle that whenever the Torah calls a mitzva a statute, the details of its performance are indispensable. Rav Ashi <b>said to him: It was necessary</b> for the Torah to define this mitzva as a statute <b>only with regard to</b> the requirement that the High Priest <b>bring a full</b> tenth <b>from his home.</b> With regard to its sanctification in a service vessel, it can be sanctified in halves.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> really <b>say this? But it was stated:</b> If one <b>set aside half a tenth</b> of an ephah for any meal offering, <b>and his intention</b> was <b>to add</b> to the half in order to reach a full tenth, <b>Rav says</b> that <b>it is not sanctified,</b> as he did not bring a full tenth, <b>and Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that it is <b>sanctified. And if it is so</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan holds that the griddle-cake offering cannot be sanctified in halves, <b>let him derive from</b> the <b>griddle-cake</b> offering that no meal offering may be sanctified in halves.",
            "<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan does not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of one <b>matter</b> with regard to consecrated items <b>from</b> that of another <b>matter,</b> that is difficult: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: Peace offerings that</b> were <b>slaughtered in the Sanctuary are valid, as it is written: “And slaughter it at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 3:2), i.e., in the courtyard. Rabbi Yoḥanan explains: It is logical <b>that</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>minor</b> area, i.e., the courtyard, <b>should not be more stringent than</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>major</b> area, the Tent of Meeting. Evidently, Rabbi Yoḥanan derives a <i>halakha</i> with regard to the Sanctuary from the Temple courtyard.",
            "The Gemara responds: Rabbi Yoḥanan does in fact derive the <i>halakha</i> of one matter from another, and therefore he learns the <i>halakha</i> with regard to all meal offerings from the griddle-cake offering, that in general they are not sanctified in halves. But a case where one expresses <b>his intention to add</b> to the half measure <b>is different, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “Both of them <b>full</b> of fine flour” (Numbers 7:13). <b>“Full”</b> is a reference <b>only</b> to <b>full</b> measurements; <b>that is to say,</b> the flour <b>is not sanctified until there is a full tenth</b> inside the vessel. <b>And Rabbi Yosei said: When</b> is it the <i>halakha</i> that the flour is sanctified only if a full tenth is inside the vessel? It is <b>at a time when his intention</b> was <b>not</b> initially <b>to add</b> to that which he placed inside the vessel. <b>But at a time when his intention</b> was initially <b>to add, each initial</b> bit of flour is <b>sanctified</b> by the vessel.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And Rav,</b> who holds that standard meal offerings are not sanctified in halves even if one’s initial intention was to add to the half measure, <b>with regard to a griddle-cake</b> offering, <b>in accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>does he hold? If</b> he holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> who says that a griddle-cake offering can be sanctified in halves, then <b>let him derive from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>griddle-cake</b> offerings that all meal offerings may be sanctified in halves.",
            "<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>Rav does not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of one <b>matter from</b> that of another <b>matter,</b> that is difficult: <b>But doesn’t Rav say:</b> A standard <b>meal offering,</b> which is brought with oil and frankincense, <b>is sanctified</b> by a service vessel even <b>without</b> its <b>oil</b> and without its frankincense. It is sanctified without its oil, <b>as we find</b> such a <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to the shewbread,</b> which is sacrificed without oil and is nevertheless sanctified by a service vessel. Similarly, it is sanctified even <b>without</b> its <b>frankincense, as we find</b> such a <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to the meal offering</b> accompanying the <b>libations</b> of an offering, which is sacrificed without frankincense and is nevertheless sanctified by a service vessel.",
            "Finally, a standard meal offering is sanctified by a service vessel even <b>without</b> its <b>oil and without</b> its <b>frankincense, as we find with regard to the meal offering of a sinner,</b> which includes neither of these. This indicates that Rav does derive the <i>halakha</i> of a meal offering from other meal offerings. Rather, <b>perforce,</b> with regard to the griddle-cake offering, <b>Rav holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> that this offering is not sanctified in halves, and it is derived from there that no meal offerings are sanctified in halves.",
            "§ The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: Rav says</b> that <b>a meal offering is sanctified without</b> its <b>oil, and its <i>halakha</i> is not</b> the same <b>as</b> when <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah of flour is <b>lacking, as we find</b> such a <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to the shewbread,</b> which is sacrificed without oil and is nevertheless sanctified by a service vessel. Similarly, it is sanctified even <b>without</b> its <b>frankincense, as we find</b> such a <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to the meal offering</b> accompanying the <b>libations</b> of an offering, which is sacrificed without frankincense and is nevertheless sanctified. Additionally, a meal offering is sanctified even <b>without</b> its <b>oil and without</b> its <b>frankincense, as we find</b> such a <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to the meal offering of a sinner,</b> which lacks both oil and frankincense and is nevertheless sanctified by a service vessel.",
            "Rav continues: <b>And oil and frankincense are</b> each <b>sanctified</b> by service vessels, <b>this</b> substance <b>without that</b> one, <b>and that</b> substance <b>without this</b> one. <b>Oil</b> is sanctified on its own, <b>as we find</b> such a <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to the <i>log</i> of oil of a leper,</b> which is sanctified on its own. <b>Frankincense</b> is sanctified on its own, <b>as we find</b> such a <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to the frankincense that comes in the bowls</b> that are brought with the shewbread; there is no oil in that case and yet the frankincense is sanctified in the bowls. <b>And Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>Neither</b> is <b>this</b> substance <b>sanctified without that, nor is that sanctified without this.</b> Rather, any meal offering that requires oil and frankincense is sanctified by a service vessel only when the flour, oil, and frankincense are all placed in the same vessel at the same time.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina, for what</b> purpose was the vessel that measured <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>anointed,</b> making it possible for it to sanctify items placed inside it? This vessel <b>was fashioned only for measuring flour, and</b> according to Rabbi Ḥanina <b>the flour is not sanctified without oil.</b> What then does this vessel sanctify? The Gemara answers: The vessel was anointed <b>for</b> the purpose of sanctifying the <b>meal offering of a sinner,</b> which contains neither oil nor frankincense.",
            "The Gemara further asks: <b>And for what</b> purpose was the vessel that measured one <b><i>log</i></b> of oil <b>anointed?</b> After all, according to Rabbi Ḥanina oil for a meal offering cannot be sanctified by itself. The Gemara explains: It was anointed <b>for</b> the purpose of sanctifying the <b><i>log</i></b> of oil <b>of a leper,</b> which is not brought as part of a meal offering. This oil is sanctified without flour or frankincense.",
            "The Gemara notes: <b>And Shmuel also holds in accordance with this</b> statement <b>of Rav,</b> that a service vessel sanctifies the flour of a meal offering even without its oil, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 88a): <b>The vessels</b> used for <b>liquids sanctify</b> only <b>the liquids, and the</b> vessels that serve as <b>dry measures sanctify</b> only <b>the dry</b> goods. <b>But the vessels</b> used for <b>liquids do not sanctify the dry</b> goods, <b>and the</b> vessels that serve as <b>dry measures do not sanctify the liquids.</b>",
            "<b>And Shmuel says</b> with regard to this mishna: <b>They taught</b> that vessels used for liquids do not sanctify dry goods <b>only</b> with regard to vessels used as <b>measures. But bowls</b> that are used for collecting and tossing the <b>blood</b> of offerings <b>sanctify the dry goods</b> as well, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the offerings of the princes brought during the inauguration of the Tabernacle: <b>“Both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil for a meal offering”</b> (Numbers 7:13), which indicates that the bowl sanctifies meal offerings, which are dry.",
            "The Gemara continues its proof: And <b>Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina,</b> with regard to this derivation of Shmuel: But the <b>meal offering</b> of the verse <b>is</b> also considered <b>a liquid,</b> as it is mingled with oil. How then can one derive from it the <i>halakha</i> with regard to items that are entirely dry? Ravina <b>said to him:</b> The verse cited by Shmuel <b>is necessary only to</b> teach that <b>the dry</b> part <b>of</b> a meal offering, <b>that is,</b> the <b>frankincense,</b> which invariably does not come into contact with the oil, is sanctified by the bowls as well.",
            "The Gemara concludes its proof with regard to Shmuel’s opinion: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that <b>Shmuel holds</b> that <b>a meal offering is not sanctified</b> by a service vessel <b>until all</b> of its components <b>are</b> together in the vessel, then <b>how can you find</b> a case where the <b>dry</b> parts <b>of</b> a meal offering are by themselves? <b>Is it not</b> correct that when meal offerings are sanctified, <b>all of them are liquids, due to the oil</b> that is mixed with them? <b>Rather, conclude from</b> here that <b>Shmuel holds</b> that <b>this</b> substance may be sanctified <b>without that</b> one.",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead in answer to Rav Aḥa of Difti’s question: <b>A meal offering,</b> even when it is mixed with oil, is, <b>relative to blood, considered as a dry</b> item. Accordingly, one may derive from the verse that the bowls sanctify dry items, and just as a bowl sanctifies a meal offering that contains oil, as it is considered dry in comparison to blood, so too, it sanctifies a meal offering that is entirely dry, i.e., that contains no oil, as claimed by Rav.",
            "§ The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rabbi Elazar says: A meal offering</b> from <b>which</b> the priest <b>removed a handful</b> while <b>inside the Sanctuary</b> is <b>valid,</b> despite the fact that the handful should be removed in the Temple courtyard; the reason is <b>that we find</b> a similar case in the Sanctuary, <b>with regard to the removal of</b> the <b>bowls</b> of frankincense from the Table of the shewbread. Just as the bowls permit the shewbread for consumption, so too, the handful permits the remainder of the meal offering for consumption.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises an objection</b> to this opinion from a <i>baraita</i> discussing the verse: “And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests; <b>and he shall remove from there</b> his handful” (Leviticus 2:2). The verse indicates that the removal of a handful from a meal offering may be performed <b>from the place where the feet of the non-priest</b> may <b>stand,</b> i.e., anywhere within the Temple courtyard.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Ben Beteira,</b> who holds that a handful is not disqualified when removed with the left hand, <b>says</b> that the verse should be interpreted as follows: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> one <b>removed a handful with</b> his <b>left</b> hand, <b>that he must return</b> the handful to the vessel that contains the meal offering <b>and</b> again <b>remove the handful with</b> his <b>right</b> hand? <b>The verse states: “And he shall remove from there.”</b> This indicates that the handful is removed <b>from the place where he already removed</b> it, i.e., the handful is returned to the meal offering and thereupon removed from the same meal offering, this time with his right hand. It is clear from the statement of the first <i>tanna</i> that the handful of a meal offering may be removed only in the place where the feet of a non-priest may stand, but not in the Sanctuary.",
            "<b>Some say</b> that Rabbi Yirmeya <b>raises the objection and he resolves it</b> as well. And <b>some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Ya’akov said to Rabbi Yirmeya bar Taḥlifa: I will explain to you</b> the resolution of this objection: The verse <b>is necessary only to permit the entire</b> Temple <b>courtyard</b> for removing the handful there, not to prohibit the removal of a handful inside the Sanctuary. The reason is <b>that you should not say: Since a burnt offering</b> is <b>an offering of the most sacred order, and a meal offering</b> is likewise <b>an offering of the most sacred order,</b> then <b>just as a burnt offering requires</b> that its slaughter be performed in the <b>northern</b> part of the Temple courtyard, <b>so too, a meal offering requires</b> that the removal of its handful be in the <b>northern</b> part.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to this comparison: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a burnt offering?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> it is more sacred, as it is <b>consumed</b> in its entirety upon the altar. The Gemara responds: The same comparison may be drawn <b>from a sin offering,</b> which is also an offering of the most sacred order and is not sacrificed in its entirety upon the altar, and yet it must be slaughtered in the northern part of the Temple courtyard.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to this comparison as well: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a sin offering?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of a sin offering are more stringent, as its sacrifice <b>atones for</b> those sins whose transgression causes one to be <b>liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i>.</b> The Gemara responds: The comparison may be drawn <b>from a guilt offering,</b> as it too is an offering of the most sacred order, it is not sacrificed in its entirety upon the altar, it does not atone for such sins, and yet it must be slaughtered in the northern part of the Temple courtyard.",
            "The Gemara rejects this suggestion as well: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a guilt offering?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> a guilt offering has a loftier status, as it is one of <b>the types of</b> offerings whose atonement is achieved through their <b>blood,</b> i.e., it is an animal offering. The Gemara adds: Once this claim has been accepted, <b>from all of them as well,</b> i.e., from a burnt offering and sin offering, one cannot draw a comparison to a meal offering either, <b>as</b> they are all of <b>the types of</b> offerings whose atonement is achieved through their <b>blood.</b>",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the verse <b>was necessary</b> in order to permit the removal of a handful anywhere in the Temple courtyard because it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it is written: “And it shall be presented to the priest, and he shall bring it to the altar”</b> (Leviticus 2:8), and it states: <b>“And he shall remove</b> from there his handful” (Leviticus 2:2), one could claim: <b>Just as</b> the <b>bringing</b> of the meal offering is <b>in the southwestern corner</b> of the altar, <b>so too,</b> the <b>removal of the handful</b> must <b>also</b> be performed <b>in the southwestern corner.</b> Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that the removal of the handful may be performed anywhere in the Temple courtyard, but this does not serve to exclude the Sanctuary.",
            "§ The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Peace offerings that</b> were <b>slaughtered in the Sanctuary are valid, as it is stated: “And slaughter it at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 3:2), i.e., in the courtyard. <b>And</b> it is logical that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>minor</b> area, i.e., the courtyard, <b>should not be more stringent than</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the major</b> one, the Tent of Meeting or the Sanctuary.",
            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan from a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that if gentiles surrounded the</b> Temple <b>courtyard</b> and were firing projectiles inside to the point that it became impossible to remain in the courtyard on account of the threat, <b>that the priests enter the Sanctuary and partake of the offerings of the most sacred order and the remainders of</b> the <b>meal offerings</b> while inside the Sanctuary? <b>The verse states:</b>"
        ],
        [
            "“Every meal offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every guilt offering of theirs, which they may render unto Me, shall be most holy for you and for your sons. <b>In the Sanctuary you shall eat them”</b> (Numbers 18:9–10). This indicates that although the mitzva is to consume offerings of the most sacred order in the courtyard, in certain instances the priests may consume these offerings inside the Sanctuary, the most holy place.",
            "The Gemara explains its objection: <b>But</b> according to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>why do I</b> need this <b>verse? Let him say</b> here as well that as the verse states: <b>“In the court of the Tent of Meeting they shall eat it”</b> (Leviticus 6:9), i.e., in the Temple courtyard, it is logical that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>minor</b> area <b>should not be more stringent than</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the major</b> one, i.e., if one may consume a peace offering in the Temple courtyard then all the more so may he consume it in the Sanctuary.",
            "The Gemara explains: Consuming an offering is not the same as slaughtering it. The slaughter of an offering is part of the sacrificial <b>service,</b> and it is not considered disrespectful <b>for a person</b> to <b>serve</b> his master <b>in the place of his master,</b> i.e., within the Sanctuary as well as in the courtyard. Therefore, <b>we say that</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>minor</b> area <b>should not be more stringent than</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the major</b> one. By contrast, with regard to the <b>consumption</b> of an offering, <b>since a person may not eat in the place of his master, the</b> only <b>reason</b> that it is permitted to consume an offering inside the Sanctuary is <b>that</b> it is <b>written</b> in <b>the verse:</b> “In a most holy place you shall eat them.” <b>Had</b> this <b>not</b> been <b>written</b> in <b>the verse</b> explicitly, <b>we</b> would <b>not say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>minor</b> area <b>should not be more stringent than</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the major</b> one.",
            "§ <b>It was stated:</b> If one <b>mixed</b> the oil of a meal offering into <b>it outside the wall of</b> the Temple <b>courtyard, Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that it is <b>disqualified,</b> and <b>Reish Lakish says</b> that it is <b>valid. Reish Lakish says:</b> It is <b>valid, as it is written: “And he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense upon it”</b> (Leviticus 2:1), <b>and then</b> it is written: <b>“And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests; and he shall remove”</b> (Leviticus 2:2).",
            "Reish Lakish explains: The Sages derived from here that <b>from the removal of the handful onward</b> the rites performed with the meal offering are solely <b>a mitzva of</b> the <b>priesthood.</b> Accordingly, the verse <b>taught about pouring and mixing that they are valid</b> when performed <b>by a non-priest. And from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <b>priesthood is not required</b> for the mixing, it may be derived that it <b>is also not required</b> that its performance be <b>inside</b> the walls of the Temple courtyard.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> This meal offering is <b>disqualified, since</b> a meal offering’s <b>performance is in</b> a service <b>vessel.</b> Therefore, <b>granted that</b> the <b>priesthood is not required,</b> yet <b>in any event</b> its performance <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard <b>is required.</b> The Gemara notes that <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> If a meal offering was <b>mixed</b> by a <b>non-priest</b> it is <b>valid.</b> But if it was mixed <b>outside the wall of the</b> Temple <b>courtyard</b> it is <b>disqualified.</b>",

            "The Gemara explains: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>he brings</b> flour <b>from within his home and he fills it,</b> as the <b>removal of the handful establishes it</b> as a meal offering to the extent that it may become disqualified. Before the removal, one may always add flour to the meal offering. <b>Reish Lakish says: He shall not bring</b> flour <b>from within his home and fill it,</b> as <b>the sanctity of</b> the service <b>vessel establishes it</b> as a meal offering.

            "The Gemara cites the dispute in question. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (26a): If, after the handful was removed, <b>the remainder of</b> the meal offering <b>became ritually impure,</b> or if <b>the remainder of</b> the meal offering <b>was burned,</b> or if <b>the remainder of</b> the meal offering <b>was lost, according to the principle of Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who says that with regard to an animal offering the blood is fit for sprinkling even if there is no meat that can be eaten, the meal offering is <b>fit,</b> and the priest burns the handful. <b>But according to the principle of Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> who says that with regard to an animal offering the blood is fit for sprinkling only if there is meat that can be eaten, it is <b>unfit</b> and the priest does not burn the handful, as the handful serves to render the remainder permitted.",
            "<b>The one who disqualifies</b> the remainder of a meal offering that became lacking between the removal of the handful and its burning upon the altar, i.e., Reish Lakish, holds <b>in accordance with</b> the plain meaning of the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua. And the one who deems</b> that remainder <b>fit,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yoḥanan, maintains that when <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says</b> that the remainder is unfit, he says so <b>only there,</b> in a case <b>where nothing remained</b> from the meal offering other than the remainder. Since the handful is intended to render permitted for consumption the remainder of the meal offering, if there is no remainder at all then the handful is not burned. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where there remained</b> a portion of the remainder, Rabbi Yoḥanan maintains that <b>even Rabbi Yehoshua concedes to</b> Rabbi Eliezer that the handful is fit to be burned.",
            "The Gemara cites a proof for Rabbi Yoḥanan: It is clear that this is Rabbi Yehoshua’s opinion, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> With regard to <b>any of the offerings that</b> are mentioned <b>in the Torah from which there remains</b> either <b>an olive-bulk of meat or an olive-bulk of fat,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that the priest <b>sprinkles the blood</b> of that offering and thereby permits either the remaining meat for consumption or the remaining fat for sacrifice upon the altar. But if there remains only <b>half an olive-bulk of meat</b> and <b>half an olive-bulk of fat, he does not sprinkle the blood,</b> as the consumption or burning of anything less than an olive-bulk is not significant enough to warrant the sprinkling of the blood. The volumes of the meat and the fat do not combine to form a whole olive-bulk.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And in</b> the case of <b>a burnt offering, even</b> if there remains only <b>half an olive-bulk of flesh and half an olive-bulk of fat, he sprinkles the blood, because in</b> the case of <b>a burnt offering it is entirely consumed,</b> i.e., as the flesh and fat are both burned upon the altar, there is in fact an olive-bulk of the offering that is designated for burning upon the altar. <b>And with regard to a meal offering, even though it</b> remains <b>entirely intact, he shall not sprinkle.</b>"

        [
            "Parenthetically, the Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the mention of <b>a meal offering doing</b> here, in a <i>baraita</i> that discusses slaughtered offerings? There is no sprinkling in the case of a meal offering. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>a meal offering</b> that accompanies the <b>libations</b> brought with a slaughtered offering.",
            "Rav Pappa elaborates: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since</b> such a meal offering <b>comes with a</b> slaughtered <b>offering, it is considered like</b> the <b>offering itself.</b> Accordingly, if the only part remaining from an offering is the meal offering that is brought with it, perhaps it is considered as though part of the offering itself remains, and therefore the priest may sprinkle the offering’s blood on account of it. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the <i>halakha</i>. In any event, Rabbi Yehoshua states in this <i>baraita</i> that the blood of an offering is sprinkled if a minimum amount remains from it. The same should apply to the remainder of a regular meal offering.",
            "Rabbi Yoḥanan cited this <i>baraita</i> as proof that even according to Rabbi Yehoshua, if a portion of the remainder of a meal offering remains intact then the handful may be burned on account of it. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> concerning <b>the one who disqualifies</b> the handful when the remainder is lacking, i.e., Reish Lakish, how does he explain the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua? The Gemara responds: Reish Lakish would claim that it <b>is different here,</b> in the case of a meal offering, <b>as the verse states: “And the priest shall remove from the meal offering its memorial part, and shall make it smoke upon the altar”</b> (Leviticus 2:9). Since it is clear that the verse is discussing a meal offering, the apparently superfluous mention of <b>“the meal offering”</b> teaches that <b>unless the entire meal offering is</b> intact, the priest <b>shall not burn</b> the handful.",
            "The Gemara continues: <b>And the other</b> <i>amora</i>, Rabbi Yoḥanan, how does he interpret that verse? Rabbi Yoḥanan claims that the phrase <b>“from the meal offering”</b> is referring to <b>a meal offering that was already whole at the time of the removal of</b> its <b>handful,</b> and the verse teaches that <b>he shall burn</b> its handful <b>even though it is currently not whole.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to Reish Lakish</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>before</b> the priest <b>detached</b> the arrangement of shewbread and the bowls of frankincense from upon the Table, the <b>bread broke</b> into pieces, the bread is <b>unfit</b> for consumption <b>and</b> the priest <b>does not burn</b> the frankincense contained in <b>the bowls on</b> account of <b>it. And if</b> the <b>bread broke after</b> the priest <b>detached it, the bread is unfit but</b> the priest <b>burns the</b> frankincense contained in the <b>bowls on</b> account of <b>it. And Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The <i>baraita</i> does <b>not</b> mean that the priest <b>actually detached</b> the shewbread. <b>Rather,</b> it means that <b>once</b> the <b>time to detach it has arrived</b> the frankincense contained in the bowls may be burned, <b>even though he has not</b> yet <b>detached it.</b> Just as the frankincense contained in the bowls is burned despite the broken shewbread, likewise, the handful of a meal offering should be burned even when the remainder is lacking.",
            "Reish Lakish <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan in response: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this? It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who permits the burning of a handful even when the remainder has been entirely destroyed. And I hold in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: I am stating a complete <i>halakha</i> to you,</b> i.e., a <i>baraita</i> of an unspecified opinion, <b>and you say to me</b> that this <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> alone?",
            "Rabbi Yoḥanan added: And furthermore, <b>if</b> the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of only <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> then <b>why</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mention <b>specifically</b> an instance where the bread <b>broke?</b> According to Rabbi Eliezer, <b>even</b> if the bread was <b>burned or lost</b> entirely, <b>he deems</b> the frankincense contained in the bowls <b>fit</b> for burning <b>as well.</b> The Gemara notes: Reish Lakish <b>was silent</b> and did not respond to the objections of Rabbi Yoḥanan.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But why was</b> Reish Lakish <b>silent? Let him say to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan that one cannot cite a proof from a <i>baraita</i> that discusses the shewbread, a communal offering, because offerings of the <b>community are different, since ritual impurity was permitted for them,</b> i.e., communal offerings may be sacrificed even in a state of ritual impurity. Therefore, it <b>was also permitted</b> to sacrifice them when they <b>are lacking. Rav Adda bar Ahava said:</b> The fact <b>that</b> Reish Lakish did not respond in <b>this</b> manner <b>is to say</b> that a meal offering that is <b>lacking</b> in measure <b>is considered like a blemished</b> animal, not merely like an impure offering, <b>and there is no</b> instance of <b>a blemished</b> animal being permitted for use as an offering, even <b>in</b> the case of <b>a communal</b> offering.",
            "The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Pappa</b> was once <b>sitting and saying this <i>halakha</i>,</b> and he noted that Reish Lakish was silent and did not respond to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s objections by differentiating between a communal offering and that of an individual, and that Rav Adda bar Ahava derived from Reish Lakish’s silence that a lack in the measure of a meal offering is tantamount to a blemish. <b>Rav Yosef bar Shemaya said to Rav Pappa: Are we not dealing</b> with a disagreement <b>that</b> exists between <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish</b> even <b>in</b> the case of <b>the <i>omer</i> meal offering, which is a communal</b> offering? <b>And</b> even so, they <b>disagree.</b> Accordingly, Reish Lakish could not have responded to the objections of Rabbi Yoḥanan by distinguishing between a communal and an individual offering, and therefore one cannot derive from his silence that a meal offering lacking in its measure is like a blemished animal.",
            "The Gemara further discusses the disagreement between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish. <b>Rav Malkiyu says</b> that <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>taught:</b> The verse states: “And he shall remove…<b>of its fine flour”</b> (Leviticus 2:2). This indicates <b>that if</b> the meal offering <b>lacks any amount</b> of its flour, it is <b>disqualified</b> and the priest may not remove a handful from it. Similarly, the term: <b>“Of its oil”</b> (Leviticus 2:2), teaches <b>that if</b> the meal offering <b>lacks any amount</b> of its oil, it is <b>disqualified.</b>",
            "<b>And it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that the verse that states: <b>“But that which is left of the meal offering</b> shall be Aaron’s and his sons’” (Leviticus 2:3), teaches that the remainder of the meal offering is given to the priests only if there was initially a whole meal offering, <b>to the exclusion of a meal offering that was lacking, or whose handful was lacking, or from which</b> the priest <b>did not burn any frankincense.</b> In such cases, the meal offering is disqualified and its remainder may not be consumed by the priests.",
            "Rav Malkiyu asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>two verses to</b> disqualify meal offerings that are <b>lacking?</b> Is it <b>not</b> correct to say that <b>one</b> verse is referring <b>to a meal offering that became lacking before the removal of the handful,</b> i.e., that one may not refill it, <b>and one</b> verse is referring <b>to</b> the <b>remainder</b> of a meal offering <b>that became lacking between the removal of the handful and</b> its <b>burning</b> upon the altar, and it teaches that one may not burn a handful on account of such a remainder?",
            "Rav Malkiyu concludes: <b>And</b> if so, then this is <b>a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan in both</b> instances where he disagrees with Reish Lakish, i.e., in the case of a meal offering that became lacking before the removal of the handful, as Rabbi Yoḥanan holds that one may refill it, and in the case of the remainder that became lacking between the removal of the handful and its burning, as he holds that the handful may be burned.",
            "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No; one</b> verse is indeed referring <b>to a meal offering that became lacking before the removal of the handful,</b> but it is not teaching that this meal offering is disqualified. Rather, this verse indicates <b>that if he brings</b> flour <b>from his home and fills it</b> so that the meal offering is no longer lacking, then <b>yes,</b> it is fit, <b>but if</b> he does <b>not</b> bring more flour, it is <b>not</b> fit. <b>And one</b> verse is indeed referring <b>to</b> the <b>remainder</b> of a meal offering <b>that became lacking between the removal of the handful and</b> its <b>burning</b> upon the altar; nevertheless, it does not indicate that the handful may not be burned. Rather, it teaches <b>that even though</b> the priest <b>burns</b> the <b>handful on</b> account of such a remainder, <b>that remainder is prohibited for consumption.</b>",
            "The Gemara continues: This is indeed the appropriate explanation of the verses, <b>as a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: According <b>to the statement of</b> the one <b>who says that</b> in a case where the <b>remainder</b> of a meal offering <b>became lacking between the removal of the handful and</b> its <b>burning</b> upon the altar, the priest <b>burns</b> the <b>handful on</b> account of this remainder, concerning the <b>remainder itself, what</b> is its status <b>with regard to consumption,</b> i.e., may the remainder be eaten?",
            "<b>Ze’eiri said</b> that <b>the verse states: “But that which is left</b> of the meal offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’,” which teaches that the priests may consume the remainder of a meal offering, <b>but not the remainder of the remainder,</b> i.e., if the remainder became lacking before the handful was burned, the remaining part of the remainder may not be consumed. Alternatively, <b>Rabbi Yannai says</b> that <b>“of the meal offering</b> shall be Aaron’s and his sons’” indicates that the priests may consume only the remainder of <b>a meal offering that was previously</b> whole when the handful was burned, not the remainder of the remainder.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: If the priest <b>removed the handful with</b> his <b>left</b> hand the meal offering is unfit. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> that it is derived from <b>that</b> which <b>the verse states: “And the meal offering was presented; and he filled his hand from it”</b> (Leviticus 9:17). Rabbi Zeira explains: <b>This hand, I do not know what it is,</b> i.e., the left hand or the right. <b>When</b> the verse <b>states</b> with regard to the atonement of a leper: <b>“And the priest shall take of the <i>log</i> of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand”</b> (Leviticus 14:15), it mentions the left hand. One can therefore derive that <b>here,</b> where the verse specifies, the priest must use his <b>left</b> hand, whereas in <b>any place where it is stated</b> in a verse <b>“hand”</b> without specification, it is referring <b>only</b> to the <b>right</b> hand.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> how can this conclusion be derived from the verse discussing the atonement of a leper? This verse <b>is necessary for itself,</b> i.e., to teach that the oil must be poured on the priest’s left hand, not his right. The Gemara answers that <b>another</b> mention of the <b>left</b> hand <b>is written</b> in the same passage (see Leviticus 14:16). From this additional mention of the left hand it may be derived that any unspecified reference to a hand is referring to the right hand.",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>But say</b> that according to the hermeneutical principle that one <b>restriction after</b> another <b>restriction</b> serves <b>only to amplify,</b> it should be inferred from the additional specification of the left hand that the oil may be poured onto the priest’s right hand. The Gemara responds: Yet <b>another</b> specification of the <b>left</b> hand <b>is written</b> in that passage (see Leviticus 14:26). Accordingly, the hermeneutical principle that one restriction after another serves only to amplify does not apply. Instead, the verse indicates that <b>here</b> the <b>left</b> hand is required, <b>and there is no other</b> instance where the Torah requires the <b>left</b> hand.",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that <b>on the contrary, just as here</b> the <b>left</b> hand is required, <b>so too generally,</b> the <b>left</b> hand is required <b>as well.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Four</b> mentions of the <b>left</b> hand <b>are written</b> in the passage, <b>two with regard to a poor</b> leper (Leviticus 14:26–27), <b>and two with regard to a wealthy</b> one (Leviticus 14:15–16). Accordingly, three of the specifications serve to indicate that the oil may be poured only onto the left hand, while the additional mention serves to restrict the use of the left hand to the case of a leper alone.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said to Rabbi Zeira:</b> According to your opinion, one interprets homiletically the additional specifications in the passage discussing the purification of a leper. If so, there is another apparently superfluous verse: <b>“Upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the big toe of his right foot”</b> (Leviticus 14:17), <b>which is written with regard to</b> the placement of the <b>oil</b> upon the right thumb and big toe <b>of a wealthy leper.

Since the Torah has already specified that the blood is placed upon the right thumb and big toe (Leviticus 14:14), it is clear that the oil is placed there as well. Similarly, why must the verse specify with regard to a poor leper that the oil is placed on the right thumb and big toe? Isn’t already clear from the verse where the oil must be placed, as it states: “Upon the place of the blood of the guilt offering” (Leviticus 14:28)? The Gemara responds: <b>One</b> specification, stated with regard to a wealthy leper, serves <b>to permit</b> the placement of the oil on the <b>sides</b> of the thumb and sides of the big toe in addition to the nail side of the thumb and big toe, <b>and one,</b> stated with regard to a poor leper, serves <b>to disqualify the sides of sides,</b> i.e., their undersides.",
            "The Gemara inquires with regard to the verse: <b>“Upon the blood of the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 14:17), stated with regard to the purification of a wealthy leper, and the verse: <b>“Upon the place of the blood of the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 14:28), stated with regard to the purification of a poor leper. <b>For what</b> purpose <b>do they come,</b> i.e., why are both verses necessary?",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>These</b> verses <b>are necessary, because if the Merciful One had written</b> only: <b>“Upon the blood of the guilt offering,” I would say:</b> If the blood <b>is</b> still on the right thumb and big toe of the leper, <b>yes,</b> the priest places the oil upon the blood. But if it <b>was wiped</b> from there, he does <b>not</b> place the oil. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes: “Upon the place</b> of the blood of the guilt offering,” indicating that the oil is placed upon the location of the blood, not necessarily upon the blood itself.",
            "<b>And</b> conversely, <b>if the Merciful One had written</b> only: <b>“Upon the place</b> of the blood of the guilt offering,” <b>I would say:</b> The oil is placed on his right thumb and big toe <b>specifically</b> when the blood <b>was wiped</b> from there. <b>But</b> if the blood <b>is</b> still there, I will <b>say</b> that the blood <b>is an interposition</b> between the oil and the thumb or toe. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that the oil is placed <b>“upon the blood of the guilt offering,”</b> and the blood is not considered an interposition.",
            "<b>Rava said: Since it is written</b> that the priest places the oil <b>“upon the blood of the guilt offering,” and: “Upon the place of</b> the blood of <b>the guilt offering,” and it is</b> also <b>written</b> with regard to a wealthy leper (see Leviticus 14:14) and a poor one (see Leviticus 14:25) that the <b>right</b> hand and foot are required <b>for</b> the placement of <b>the blood,</b> as the verses state: <b>“Upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the big toe of his right foot,” and</b> this <b>is</b> also <b>written with regard to</b> the <b>oil of a wealthy leper</b> (see Leviticus 14:17) <b>and a poor</b> one (see Leviticus 14:28), one can ask: <b>Why do I</b> need all of these verses?",
            "<b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The verses that specify that the oil must be placed on the right thumb and big toe do not teach a <i>halakha</i> with regard to a leper, as it is clear that the oil must be placed on the right thumb and big toe, as it states: “Upon the place of the blood of the guilt offering.” Rather, these verses are the source of verbal analogies for other <i>halakhot</i>. When the verse states with regard to a wealthy leper: “Of his right hand” (Leviticus 14:17), this teaches a verbal analogy between the term <b>“hand”</b> written here and <b>“hand”</b> written <b>with regard to the removal of a handful,</b> as the verse states about the removal of a handful: “And he filled his hand from it” (Leviticus 9:17). The verbal analogy teaches that the removal of the handful must also be performed with the right hand.",
            "Similarly, when the verse states: “Of his right foot” (Leviticus 14:17), with regard to a wealthy leper, this teaches a verbal analogy between the term <b>“foot”</b> written here and <b>“foot”</b> written <b>with regard to the ritual through which the <i>yavam</i>, a man whose married brother died childless, frees his brother’s widow, the <i>yevama</i>, of her levirate bonds [<i>ḥalitza</i>],</b> as the verse states with regard to <i>ḥalitza</i>: “And remove his shoe from upon his foot” (Deuteronomy 25:9).

            "Additionally, when the verse states: “Upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed” (Leviticus 14:17), with regard to a wealthy leper, this teaches a verbal analogy between the term <b>“ear”</b> written here and <b>“ear”</b> written <b>with regard to</b> the <b>piercing</b> of a Hebrew slave’s ear with an awl, as the verse states: “And his master shall bore his ear through with an awl” (Exodus 21:6).

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> concerning <b>the other</b> verses that specify the <b>left</b> hand of a poor leper (Leviticus 14:26–27) as well as the <b>right hand and foot of a poor</b> leper (Leviticus 14:25–28), <b>for what</b> purpose do they <b>come?</b> The Gemara responds: These verses come <b>for that which the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Any passage that was stated</b> in the Torah <b>and was</b> then <b>repeated, was repeated only for</b> the sake of <b>a matter that was introduced</b> for the first time <b>in</b> the repeated passage. That is, sometimes the Torah repeats an entire passage just to teach a single new detail. In this case, the verses that discuss the purification of a poor leper were repeated only for the sake of the differences in the offerings between a wealthy leper and a poor one.

            "The Gemara comments: It might <b>enter our mind</b> to say that this means that <b>we require both a finger and</b> the <b>priesthood</b> to be stated together in the verse in order to mandate use of the right hand, e.g., <b>as it is written: “And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger”</b> (Leviticus 4:25). <b>And</b> the fact that this verse is referring to a finger from his right hand <b>is derived from a leper, as it is written: “And the priest shall dip his right finger”</b> (Leviticus 14:16).

One can <b>derive</b> that the handful must be removed with the right hand <b>from</b> the verse’s mention of the <b>priesthood,</b> as it is stated: “And the priest shall remove his handful” (Leviticus 5:12).",
            "The Gemara responds: Both derivations are necessary, <b>one for</b> the removal of the <b>handful</b> from a meal offering, <b>and one for the sanctification of</b> the <b>handful,</b> i.e., placing it into a second service vessel. Both must be performed with the right hand.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Rabbi Shimon, who does not require sanctification of</b> the <b>handful, or according to the one who says that Rabbi Shimon also requires the sanctification of</b> the <b>handful but</b> that <b>he deems</b> the sanctification <b>fit</b> when performed <b>with</b> the <b>left</b> hand (see 26a), <b>why do I</b> need the verbal analogy <b>of Rava</b> between <b>“hand”</b> and <b>“hand”?</b>",
            "<b>If</b> one suggests that it is necessary <b>to</b> indicate that the <b>removal of the handful itself</b> must be performed with the right hand, this cannot be, since this is <b>derived from</b> the verse cited by <b>Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya.

            "Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, elaborates: The verse compares the meal offering to a sin offering and a guilt offering.

            "The Gemara explains: All of the cases are <b>necessary.

Abaye <b>raised an objection to</b> Rava from a <i>baraita</i> discussing the mitzva function of each of the fingers: <b>This</b> small finger is for measuring <b>a span</b> (see Exodus 28:16), i.e., the distance between the thumb and the little finger. <b>This</b> fourth finger is used for <b>removal of a handful</b> from the meal offering, i.e., the measurement of a handful begins from this finger, as the priest removes a handful by folding the middle three fingers over his palm.",

            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>In</b> the case of <b>a pan</b> meal offering <b>and</b> that <b>of a deep-pan</b> meal offering, when the flour was fried before being scooped and was therefore hard, the priest <b>wipes</b> away <b>with his thumb</b> any flour that was overflowing <b>above</b> his handful, <b>and with his little finger</b> he wipes away the flour that was pushing out <b>below.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>This one</b> is the hardest sacrificial rite, <b>and no other?

            "<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> It is <b>obvious to me</b> that the term <b>“his handful”</b> means that the removal of the handful from a meal offering should be performed <i>ab initio</i> <b>in the manner that people</b> usually <b>remove a handful,</b> with their fingertips angled to the side. <b>Rav Pappa raises a dilemma: What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> if the priest <b>removed a handful with his fingertips,</b> i.e., if he placed his hand horizontally over the meal offering and filled his palm with flour by closing his fingers to his palm? Does this disqualify the taking of the handful or not?",

            "<b>Rav Huna said: Even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says</b> that the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood of an offering, which renders its meat permitted for consumption and removes it from being subject to misuse of consecrated property, <b>is effective in</b> removing the meat of an offering that <b>left</b> the Temple courtyard from being subject to misuse of consecrated property despite the fact that such meat is prohibited for consumption, <b>that statement</b> applies only when the meat was disqualified by means of <b>leaving.</b>",
            "Rav Huna explains: The reason is <b>that</b> the meat remains <b>as is, and</b> the <b>disqualification</b> of the meat by means of leaving is <b>on account of something else,</b> i.e., a factor external to the meat itself. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a lack</b> in the measure of the remainder of a meal offering, <b>which is a disqualification</b> on account <b>of itself,</b> the <b>burning</b> of the handful <b>is not effective in</b> removing the remainder from being subject to misuse of consecrated property, nor to establish it as <i>piggul</i>.",

            "<b>Rava said: From where do I say</b> that even remainders that lack a full measure can be rendered <i>piggul</i>?

            "<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>No,</b> one cannot prove from here that the mishna is discussing the case of a remainder that became lacking. The reason for this is: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna of Rabbi Ḥiyya? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 109b): With regard to <b>the handful</b> of flour, <b>and the frankincense, and the incense, and the meal offering of priests</b> (see Leviticus 6:16), <b>and the meal offering of the anointed priest</b> (see Leviticus 6:12–15), <b>and the meal offering</b> that accompanies the <b>libations</b> brought with animal offerings (see Numbers 15:1–16), <b>where one sacrificed an olive-bulk from one of them outside</b> the Temple courtyard, he is <b>liable</b> for sacrificing outside the courtyard. <b>And Rabbi Elazar exempts</b> one from liability <b>until he sacrifices</b> them in their <b>entirety</b> rather than just an olive-bulk from them.",
            "Abaye concludes: <b>Since with regard to the burning of the handful he</b> could <b>not teach: Or</b> burn <b>an olive-bulk of its handful outside</b> the Temple, as according to Rabbi Elazar one is not liable for burning anything less than the full handful and therefore intent to burn only an olive-bulk does not render the offering <i>piggul</i>, <b>with regard to</b> the <b>remainder as well, he did not teach: Or an olive-bulk.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the mishna of Rabbi Ḥiyya is really in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> then <b>this</b> statement: <b>To burn its handful</b> outside the Temple courtyard, <b>should have</b> been phrased: <b>To burn its handful and its frankincense</b> outside the Temple courtyard, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 110a): With regard to <b>the handful and the frankincense,</b> in a case <b>where one sacrificed</b> only <b>one of them outside</b> the Temple courtyard, he is <b>liable. Rabbi Eliezer exempts</b> from liability one who burns only one of them <b>until he sacrifices both of them</b> together.",
            "The Gemara responds: The mishna of Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>is necessary only for the handful of the meal offering of a sinner,</b> which has no frankincense. Since only the burning of the handful permits the remainder of the sinner’s meal offering for consumption, one’s intent to burn it the next day renders the offering <i>piggul</i>. With regard to this meal offering, one is not liable for burning anything less than the full handful, according to Rabbi Elazar, and therefore it does not teach: Or an olive-bulk.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And did the <i>tanna</i> go to all that trouble [<i>ve’ikhpal</i>]</b> just <b>to teach us</b> a <i>halakha</i> that is applicable only in the case of <b>the handful of the meal offering of a sinner?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Yes,</b> he did. <b>And similarly, when Rav Dimi came</b> to Babylonia from Eretz Yisrael, he said that <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> ben Pedat <b>said:</b> When the mishna discusses an instance where one has intent to sacrifice the handful of a meal offering outside, <b>it is</b> referring to the <b>handful of the meal offering of a sinner, and it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar.</b>",
            "<b>Rava then said: That</b> which <b>I said,</b> that the burning of the handful with the intent to consume the remainder the next day is effective in rendering even a remainder that became lacking in measure as <i>piggul</i> and to remove it from being subject to misuse of consecrated property <b>is nothing, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the shewbread: <b>“It is most holy”</b> (Leviticus 24:9). The restrictive term “it” teaches that the shewbread must remain whole, so <b>that if one of</b> the loaves of the shewbread <b>broke</b> and consequently became lacking in measure, then <b>all of its loaves are disqualified,</b> and the burning of the bowls of frankincense do not render them permitted for consumption.",
            "Rava continues: It can be inferred from the <i>baraita</i> that if the loaves remained whole <b>but</b> one of them <b>left</b> the Temple, <b>those that are inside</b> the Temple are still <b>fit.</b> And <b>whom have you heard who says:</b> The <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood <b>is effective in</b> rendering <i>piggul</i> an item that <b>left</b> the Temple? <b>It is Rabbi Akiva.

            "<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: How can you cite a proof from this <i>baraita</i>? <b>Is</b> it <b>taught</b> in this <i>baraita</i>: But if a loaf of shewbread <b>left,</b> those loaves that remain inside are fit? <b>Perhaps</b> all of the loaves are disqualified if even one of them left, and one should infer a different <i>halakha</i> from the <i>baraita</i>, that <b>if</b> one of the loaves <b>became ritually impure, these</b> that remain pure <b>are fit.</b>",
            "Abaye explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for such a distinction? The reason is <b>that the frontplate</b> of the High Priest <b>effects acceptance</b> for ritually impure offerings. <b>But</b> in a case where a loaf of shewbread <b>left,</b> the frontplate does <b>not</b> effect acceptance, and therefore all of the loaves are disqualified, as in a case where one loaf breaks. <b>And</b> if so, the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who says</b> that <b>sprinkling is not effective</b> with regard <b>to</b> an item <b>that left</b> the Temple courtyard.",
            "Abaye continues: <b>And by right</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>should have also taught</b> that if one of the loaves of shewbread <b>left,</b> all the loaves are disqualified. <b>And</b> as for the fact <b>that it teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> specifically with regard to a loaf that <b>broke, this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us: That even</b> if the loaf <b>broke,</b> in <b>which</b> case the loaf <b>is</b> still <b>inside</b> the Temple, <b>burning is not effective</b> with regard <b>to it.

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers from the mishna: <b>The reason that</b> the two halves of an olive-bulk do not join together is because his intent was <b>to partake of</b> half an olive-bulk <b>and to burn</b> half an olive-bulk, which indicates that if his intent was <b>to partake</b> of half an olive-bulk of the remainder <b>and to partake of</b> half an olive-bulk of <b>an item whose</b> typical <b>manner</b> is such that one does <b>not consume</b> it, i.e., the handful, then the halves do <b>join together</b> to the amount of an olive-bulk and disqualify the offering.",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the purpose of the apparently superfluous statement: <b>And you</b> would <b>say the same</b> with regard to the two bowls of frankincense? Is there reason to assume that Rabbi Yosei would hold that the shewbread is rendered <i>piggul</i> in such a case? The Gemara responds that it is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>the reason that Rabbi Yosei</b> holds that there is no <i>piggul</i> <b>in</b> the case of the <b>frankincense</b> is <b>because it is not</b> of the same <b>type as a meal offering. But with regard to</b> the <b>two bowls of frankincense, which are of the same type as each other,</b> one might <b>say</b> that <b>they do render one another <i>piggul</i>.</b> Therefore, Reish Lakish <b>teaches us</b> that in both instances one permitting factor does not render another permitting factor <i>piggul</i>.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And can you say</b> that <b>the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei in</b> the case of the <b>frankincense</b> in the mishna <b>is not due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the frankincense <b>is not</b> of the same <b>type as a meal offering? But isn’t it taught</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna that the Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yosei: In <b>what</b> manner does the frankincense <b>differ from</b> an animal <b>offering,</b> where if one slaughtered it with the intent to sacrifice the portions consumed on the altar the next day it is <i>piggul</i>; and Rabbi Yosei <b>said to</b> the Rabbis: There is a difference, as in <b>the</b> case of an animal <b>offering, its blood, and its flesh, and its portions</b> consumed on the altar are all <b>one</b> entity, <b>but</b> the <b>frankincense is not</b> part <b>of the meal offering?</b> The mishna indicates that according to Rabbi Yosei the reason the meal offering is not <i>piggul</i> is because the frankincense is not of the same type as the meal offering.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>What</b> does Rabbi Yosei mean when he says that the frankincense <b>is not</b> part <b>of the meal offering?</b> He means that <b>it is not</b> part <b>of</b> the <b>preclusion</b> of the <b>meal offering.</b> The Gemara elaborates: This means <b>that</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>not</b> that <b>just as</b> the <b>handful precludes</b> the <b>remainder,</b> i.e., <b>that as long as</b> the <b>handful is not burned</b> the <b>remainder may not be consumed, so too</b> the handful <b>precludes the frankincense</b> from being burned upon the altar. <b>Rather, if</b> the priest <b>wants, he burns this first, and if he wants, he burns that first,</b> i.e., he may burn the frankincense before or after the burning of the handful. Accordingly, the frankincense is an independent permitting factor. For this reason, intent with regard to the frankincense that occurred during the removal of the handful does not render a meal offering <i>piggul</i>.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis,</b> who say that the meal offering is rendered <i>piggul</i> in such a case, what is their opinion? The Gemara responds: They hold that <b>when we say</b> that <b>a permitting factor does not render</b> another <b>permitting factor <i>piggul</i>,</b> this is <b>with regard to</b> the case taught in a mishna (16a) concerning one who <b>slaughtered one of the lambs</b> whose sacrifice permits the consumption of the two loaves meal offering brought on <i>Shavuot</i>, with the intent <b>to partake of the other</b> lamb <b>the next day.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>When you said</b> in the mishna that <b>both</b> permitting factors <b>are fit, this statement</b> applies only <b>where they were not fixed in one vessel. But</b> in a situation <b>where they were fixed in one vessel,</b> as is the case with regard to the handful and the frankincense, they are <b>considered like one</b> unit, and therefore they render one another <i>piggul</i>.",
            "§ With regard to the frankincense, <b>Rabbi Yannai says:</b> The <b>collection</b> of the <b>frankincense</b> from a meal offering, when performed <b>by a non-priest,</b> is <b>not valid</b> and disqualifies the meal offering. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason? Rabbi Yirmeya said:</b> It is <b>because</b> the rite of <b>conveying has touched it,</b> i.e., the collection of the frankincense is considered part of the rite of the conveying of the frankincense to the altar for the purpose of burning. Even if the non-priest simply collected the frankincense and thereafter transferred it to a priest, Rabbi Yannai <b>holds</b> that <b>conveying</b> even <b>without</b> moving one’s <b>leg is called conveying, and</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that the performance of the rite of <b>conveying by a non-priest</b> is <b>not valid.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Mari said: We learn</b> this <i>halakha</i> in the mishna on 12a, which discusses those sacrificial rites of a meal offering during which improper intent renders an offering <i>piggul</i>, <b>as well.</b> The mishna teaches: <b>This is the principle:</b> In the case of <b>anyone who removes the handful, or places</b> the handful <b>in the vessel,</b> or <b>who conveys</b> the vessel with the handful to the altar, or <b>who burns</b> the handful on the altar, with the intent to partake of an item whose typical manner is such that one partakes of it, or to burn an item whose typical manner is such that one burns it on the altar, outside its designated area, the meal offering is unfit but there is no liability for <i>karet</i>. If his intent was to perform any of these actions beyond their designated time, the offering is <i>piggul</i> and one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> on account of it, provided that the permitting factor, i.e., the handful, was sacrificed in accordance with its mitzva.",
            "Rav Mari analyzes the first part of this mishna: <b>Granted,</b> the <b>removal of the handful</b> from a meal offering <b>is</b> the same as, i.e., equivalent to, the <b>slaughter</b> of animal offerings. The <b>conveying</b> of the handful to the altar in order to burn it <b>is also</b> the same as the <b>conveying</b> of the blood of a slaughtered offering to the altar in order to sprinkle it. Similarly, the <b>burning</b> of the handful and frankincense of a meal offering <b>is</b> comparable to the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood of a slaughtered offering upon the altar. <b>But</b> as for <b>placing</b> the handful <b>in the</b> service <b>vessel, what</b> rite <b>is he performing</b> that is comparable to a rite of slaughtered offerings?",
            "<b>If we say</b> that the meal offering is <i>piggul</i> <b>because</b> the placing of the handful into a vessel <b>is comparable to</b> the <b>collection</b> of the blood of a slaughtered offering into a service vessel, one can ask: <b>Are</b> these rites in fact <b>comparable? There,</b> in the case of animal offerings, the blood enters the vessel <b>by itself,</b> whereas <b>here,</b> the priest <b>takes</b> the handful from the meal offering <b>and casts</b> it into the vessel.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> it must be <b>due to</b> the following reason: <b>Since it is not possible</b> to sacrifice the handful <b>without</b> first <b>performing</b> the act of placing it in a vessel, the placement of the handful in a vessel <b>is</b> considered <b>a significant rite,</b> and <b>perforce</b> this factor causes it to be <b>considered like</b> the <b>collection</b> of the blood. <b>Here too,</b> with regard to the collection of the frankincense, <b>since it is not possible</b> to sacrifice the frankincense <b>without</b> first <b>performing</b> the act of collecting it from the vessel, the collection of the frankincense <b>is a significant rite</b> that <b>perforce</b> causes it to be <b>considered like</b> the rite of <b>conveying.</b>",
            "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No,</b> this is not the reason, and one cannot prove from the mishna that the collection of the frankincense from a meal offering performed by a non-priest is not valid. <b>Actually,</b> the reason why intent during the placement of the handful renders the offering <i>piggul</i> is in fact <b>because it is comparable to</b> the <b>collection</b> of the blood of a slaughtered offering. <b>And as for</b> the <b>difficulty you</b> raised, that <b>there</b> the blood enters the vessel <b>by itself,</b> whereas <b>here he takes</b> the handful from the meal offering <b>and casts</b> it into the vessel, this is not a true difficulty.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>Now</b> consider, <b>both of them,</b> i.e., the collection of the blood and the placing of the handful, involve the <b>sanctity of a vessel,</b> in which a service vessel sanctifies a permitting factor to the altar, either the handful or the blood. <b>What</b> difference is it <b>to me</b> if the permitting factor enters the vessel <b>by itself or</b> whether one <b>takes</b> the item <b>and casts</b> it into the vessel?",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>one slaughtered</b> the <b>two lambs</b> that accompany the two meal offering loaves sacrificed on <i>Shavuot</i> with the intent <b>to partake of one of the</b> two <b>loaves the next day,</b> or if <b>one burned</b> the <b>two bowls</b> of frankincense accompanying the shewbread with the intent <b>to partake of one of the arrangements</b> of the shewbread <b>the next day, Rabbi Yosei says: That loaf and that arrangement of which he intended</b> to partake the next day are <b><i>piggul</i> and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> their consumption, <b>and the second</b> loaf and arrangement are <b>unfit, but there is no</b> liability to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> their consumption. <b>And the Rabbis say: This</b> loaf and arrangement <b>and that</b> loaf and arrangement are both <b><i>piggul</i> and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> their consumption.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Huna says: Rabbi Yosei would say,</b> in accordance with his opinion that intent of <i>piggul</i> with regard to one loaf or one arrangement does not render the second loaf or arrangement <i>piggul</i>, that if one <b>had intent of <i>piggul</i> with regard to the right thigh,</b> i.e., he slaughtered an offering with the intent to partake of the right thigh the next day, then <b>the left thigh has not become <i>piggul</i></b> and one is not liable to receive <i>karet</i> for its consumption. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>If you wish, propose a logical argument, and if you wish, cite a verse.</b>",
            "Rav Huna elaborates: <b>If you wish, propose a logical argument:</b> Disqualifying <b>intent is no stronger than an incident of ritual impurity,</b> and <b>if one limb</b> of an offering <b>became impure, did the entire</b> offering then <b>become impure?</b> Accordingly, one limb can be rendered <i>piggul</i> without the other. <b>And if you wish, cite a verse</b> that addresses <i>piggul</i>: <b>“And the soul that eats of it shall bear his iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 7:18). The verse indicates that one who eats specifically <b>“of it,”</b> i.e., from one part, shall bear his iniquity, <b>and not</b> one who eats <b>from the other</b> part of the offering.",
            "<b>Rav Naḥman raised an objection to</b> Rav <b>Huna</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And the Rabbis say</b> that <b>there is never</b> liability to receive <b><i>karet</i></b> for partaking of the two loaves <b>unless one has intent of <i>piggul</i> with regard to an olive-bulk of both of them,</b> i.e., one’s intent renders both loaves <i>piggul</i> only if he slaughters the lambs with the intent to consume an amount equal to an olive-bulk from both loaves combined outside their proper time. One can infer from this that if he had intent <b>with regard to both of them, yes,</b> both loaves are <i>piggul</i>.

            "The Gemara responds: <b>Actually,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s statement is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis.

            "<b>Rava bar Rav Ḥanan said to Abaye: But if Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>is of</b> the opinion that intentions during the performance of <b>an entire permitting factor and</b> concerning <b>half</b> a measure of <b>consumption</b> combine to render an offering <i>piggul</i>, why does he rule that when one slaughters each lamb with the intent to consume half an olive-bulk from one loaf the next day the offering is entirely valid? <b>Let him decree</b> that intentions during <b>half a permitting factor and</b> concerning <b>half</b> a measure of <b>consumption</b> disqualify an offering, <b>due to</b> the fact that intentions during <b>an entire permitting factor and</b> concerning <b>half</b> a measure of <b>consumption</b> render the offering <i>piggul</i>, <b>as</b> one finds in similar instances that <b>Rabbi Yosei decreed and the Rabbis decreed</b> in this manner.",
            "Rava bar Rav Ḥanan elaborates: <b>Rabbi Yosei decreed</b> in such a case, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (13a): With regard to one who removes a handful from the meal offering with the intent to burn its handful on the next day, everyone agrees that the meal offering is <i>piggul</i>. But if his intent was <b>to burn its frankincense</b> on <b>the next day, Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The meal offering is <b>unfit, but</b> partaking of it <b>does not include</b> liability to receive <b><i>karet</i>. And the Rabbis say:</b> It is a case of <b><i>piggul</i> and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> partaking of the meal offering. Since one is not liable to receive <i>karet</i>, Rabbi Yosei evidently disqualifies the meal offering as a rabbinic decree due to concern over a case where his intention was to burn the handful the next day.",
            "<b>And the Rabbis decreed as well, as we learned</b> in a mishna (16a): If one had <b>intent of <i>piggul</i> during</b> the burning of <b>the handful but not during</b> the burning of <b>the frankincense,</b> or if he had such intent <b>during</b> the burning of <b>the frankincense but not during</b> the burning of <b>the handful, Rabbi Meir says:</b> The meal offering is <b><i>piggul</i> and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> its consumption, <b>and the Rabbis say: There is no</b> liability to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> its consumption <b>unless he has intent of <i>piggul</i> during</b> the burning of <b>the entire permitting factor,</b> i.e., both the handful and the frankincense. Since the Rabbis state that there is no liability to receive <i>karet</i>, but they do not rule that the offering is valid, evidently they maintain that the offering is disqualified by rabbinic law, due to concern over a case of <i>piggul</i> intent during the burning of the entire permitting factor.",
            "Abaye <b>said to</b> Rava bar Rav Ḥanan: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? Granted there, Rabbi Yosei decreed</b> that the offering is disqualified in a case of intent involving <b>the handful of frankincense due to</b> the concern of intent involving <b>the handful of the meal offering,</b> as the two cases are similar.",
            "Similarly, <b>the Rabbis decreed</b> that the offering is disqualified in a case of intent involving the <b>handful due to</b> a similar case of intent concerning <b>the handful of the meal offering of a sinner.</b> There is no frankincense in the case of a meal offering of a sinner, and consequently the priest’s intent with regard to the handful alone renders the offering <i>piggul</i>, as it is the sole permitting factor. <b>And</b> the Rabbis also decreed in a case of intent with regard to the <b>frankincense due to</b> a similar case of intent concerning the <b>frankincense that comes in</b> the <b>bowls</b> that accompany the shewbread. Here there is no handful, and consequently intent with regard to the frankincense alone renders the shewbread <i>piggul</i>.",
            "In the case of the two <b>lambs</b> that accompany the two loaves brought on <i>Shavuot</i> <b>as well</b> (16a), the Rabbis rule that if one slaughters one of the lambs with the intent to consume both loaves the next day the offering is disqualified, but one is not liable to receive <i>karet</i> for partaking of it. This is a rabbinic decree in a case of intent during the slaughter of one <b>lamb due to the other lamb,</b> as were one to slaughter both lambs with intent of <i>piggul</i>, the loaves would be rendered <i>piggul</i>, since his intent occurred during the slaughter of the entire permitting factor.",
            "Similarly, when one burns a single <b>bowl</b> of frankincense from those that accompany the shewbread with the intent to consume both arrangements of shewbread the next day, the Rabbis disqualify the shewbread by rabbinic decree <b>due to the other bowl,</b> i.e., due to the concern over <i>piggul</i> intent during the burning of both bowls, as this intent involves the burning of the entire permitting factor.",
            "Abaye concludes: <b>But here,</b> in the case of the <i>baraita</i> where one slaughtered each of the two lambs with the intent to consume half an olive-bulk from a different loaf, <b>is there</b> another instance <b>in general</b> where intent during the performance of a rite concerning <b>half a permitting factor and</b> with regard to <b>half</b> a measure <b>of consumption</b> renders an offering <i>piggul</i>, <b>that</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>will arise and decree</b> that the lambs in this instance are disqualified?",
            "The Gemara notes: <b>So too, it is reasonable that the reasoning of the Rabbis is due to that</b> explanation, i.e., they disqualified the offerings in the aforementioned cases due to the fact that in similar instances the offering is <i>piggul</i>. This is evident from the fact <b>that</b> it <b>is taught</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna (16a): <b>The Rabbis concede to Rabbi Meir in</b> the case of <b>the meal offering of a sinner and the meal offering of jealousy that if one had intent of <i>piggul</i> during</b> the burning of <b>the handful,</b> the meal offering is <b><i>piggul</i> and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> its consumption, <b>as the handful is the</b> sole <b>permitting factor.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains this proof: <b>Why do I</b> need the mishna <b>to teach</b> this last statement <b>at all?</b> Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that these meal offerings are <i>piggul</i>, as <b>is there another permitting factor</b> aside from the handful? <b>Rather, is it not</b> correct to say that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>teaches us, that the reason that</b> the Rabbis disqualified a standard meal offering when only the <b>handful</b> was removed with the intent of <i>piggul</i> is <b>because there is</b> the case of <b>the handful of the meal offering of a sinner, which is similar to it</b> and is rendered <i>piggul</i> due to intent involving the handful alone?",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>one of the</b> two <b>loaves</b> of <i>Shavuot</i> <b>or one of the</b> two <b>arrangements</b> of the shewbread <b>became ritually impure, Rabbi Yehuda says: Both must be taken to the place of burning</b> like any other disqualified offering, <b>as no communal offering is divided.</b> That is, it is either fit in its entirety or unfit in its entirety. <b>And the Rabbis say: The impure one</b> remains <b>in its</b> state of <b>impurity and the pure one shall be eaten.</b>",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis applies only to a case where one loaf became ritually impure <b>before</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood of the lambs, as this is the act that renders the loaves permitted for consumption.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in the case where the loaves become impure <b>before</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood, <b>with regard to what</b> principle <b>do they disagree? Rav Pappa said: They disagree with regard to</b> the <b>frontplate</b> of the High Priest, i.e., whether it <b>effects acceptance</b> only for the impurity of items sacrificed on the altar, or even <b>for</b> the impurity of items that would normally be <b>consumed</b> by the priests."

        [
            "<b>The Rabbis hold</b> that <b>the frontplate effects acceptance for</b> items that are normally <b>consumed</b> by the priests but have become ritually impure. Consequently, the sprinkling of the blood in this case is an entirely valid act that is capable of rendering the remaining pure loaf permitted for consumption. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>the frontplate does not effect acceptance for</b> items that are <b>consumed</b> by the priests and have become impure. Accordingly, the sprinkling of the blood is ineffective in rendering the remaining pure loaf permitted for consumption.",
            "<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Natan, said to Rav Pappa:</b> Can this be the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis? <b>But</b> what about items that normally <b>ascend</b> upon the altar? Even Rabbi Yehuda concedes <b>that the frontplate effects acceptance for</b> impure items <b>that</b> normally <b>ascend</b> the altar, <b>and</b> Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis nevertheless <b>disagree</b> with regard to the remaining item in a case of this kind.",
            "The Gemara provides the source for this claim. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one of the bowls</b> of frankincense accompanying the shewbread, which are meant to be burned upon the altar, <b>became impure, Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that the rites of <b>both of them may be performed in impurity,</b> i.e., the priest may even render the second bowl impure and burn both of them together, <b>as no communal offering is divided,</b> and the mitzva to sacrifice communal offerings overrides the prohibition against rendering them impure. <b>And the Rabbis say: The impure one</b> remains <b>in its</b> state of <b>impurity and the pure one</b> remains <b>in its</b> state of <b>purity.</b> Evidently, their dispute does not depend on whether the frontplate effects acceptance.",
            "<b>And furthermore, Rav Ashi said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an additional proof that the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis does not concern the frontplate, as we learn in a mishna (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 80a) with regard to the consumption of the Paschal offering in a state of impurity, that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even</b> if <b>one tribe is ritually impure and all</b> the rest of <b>the tribes are pure,</b> all the tribes <b>may perform</b> the rite of the Paschal offering <b>in</b> a state of <b>impurity, as no communal offerings are divided.</b> Rav Ashi explains: <b>But here, what</b> relevance <b>is there</b> to the question of whether <b>the frontplate effects acceptance?</b> The frontplate effects acceptance for offerings that have become impure; but it does not render it permitted for one who is ritually impure to sacrifice an offering.",
            "<b>And furthermore, doesn’t Ravina say: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof that the matter of the frontplate cannot be the subject of the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis, as the mishna teaches: If <b>one of the</b> two <b>loaves</b> brought on <i>Shavuot</i> <b>or one of the</b> two <b>arrangements</b> of shewbread <b>became ritually impure, Rabbi Yehuda says: Both must be taken to the place of burning, as no communal offering is divided.

            "The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>And if it is so,</b> i.e., that the dispute between them concerns the frontplate, then Rabbi Yehuda <b>should have</b> said: They are both burned, <b>because the frontplate does not effect acceptance for</b> impure items that are <b>consumed</b> by the priests. <b>Rather, Rabbi Yoḥanan says: It is a settled tradition in the mouth of Rabbi Yehuda that no communal offering is divided,</b> and if one part of an offering becomes impure, the entire offering is disqualified.",

The Gemara notes: Indeed, this poses <b>a difficulty.</b>",
            "§ The Gemara returns to the discussion of the <i>baraita</i> itself. <b>The Master said</b> above: If the priest had intent of <i>piggul</i>, whether in the first set of presentations, whether in the second set, or whether in the third set, <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> The offering is <b><i>piggul</i> and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> its consumption, despite the fact that he performed the rest of the rite silently. The Gemara asks: <b>Now</b> consider, <b>one is not liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> unless all the permitting factors</b> of the offering <b>have been sacrificed,</b> i.e., if the whole service is completed, including the presentation of the blood.",
            "The Gemara provides the source for this claim. <b>As the Master said</b> that the verse states with regard to <i>piggul</i>: <b>“It shall</b> not <b>be accepted”</b> (Leviticus 7:18), which indicates that <b>the acceptance of a disqualified</b> offering is <b>like the acceptance of a valid</b> offering, of which the verse states: “It shall be accepted” (Leviticus 22:27), and <b>just as</b> there is no <b>acceptance of a valid</b> offering <b>unless all</b> its <b>permitting factors have been sacrificed, so too</b> there is no lack of <b>acceptance of a disqualified</b> offering, i.e., it is not rendered <i>piggul</i>, <b>unless all</b> its <b>permitting factors have been sacrificed.</b> That is to say, in the absence of one of its permitting factors it does not become <i>piggul</i>.",
            "Accordingly, the Gemara challenges: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>this</b> case, of the blood of the bull and goat brought on Yom Kippur, <b>since he had intent</b> of <i>piggul</i> <b>with regard to it</b> when he was presenting the blood <b>inside</b> the Holy of Holies, <b>he has disqualified it.</b> If so, <b>when he sprinkles</b> the blood again later <b>in the Sanctuary,</b> on the Curtain and the inner altar, it is as though <b>he is merely sprinkling water,</b> and not the blood of the offering. Consequently, the permitting factors of the offering have not been sacrificed, and therefore the offering should not be rendered <i>piggul</i>.",
            "<b>Rabba said: You find it</b> possible <b>in</b> a case where there were <b>four bulls and four goats,</b> i.e., in a case where after the High Priest presented the blood inside the Holy of Holies with <i>piggul</i> intent, the remaining blood spilled. Consequently, he was required to bring another bull and goat in order to present their blood on the Curtain separating the Sanctuary and Holy of Holies. During that presentation he had intent of <i>piggul</i>, after which the remaining blood spilled, requiring him to bring another bull and goat in order to present their blood on the corners of the golden altar. He again had intent of <i>piggul</i> during that presentation, and then the blood spilled, which meant he had to bring yet another bull and goat in order to present their blood upon the golden altar itself.",
            "<b>Rava said: You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case of only <b>one bull and one goat,</b> and the remaining blood was in fact disqualified. Nevertheless, <b>with regard to rendering</b> an offering <b><i>piggul</i>,</b> the presentations performed with the disqualified blood <b>effect acceptance,</b> as though the entire permitting factor was performed in its proper manner. In other words, even though the High Priest sprinkled the blood inside the Holy of Holies with improper intent, and thereby disqualified the offering, nevertheless, since he completed the service he is considered as having sacrificed all the permitting factors with regard to <i>piggul</i>.",
            "§ The <i>baraita</i> mentioned that there are <b>forty-three</b> presentations of the blood of the bull and the goat sacrificed on Yom Kippur. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> otherwise in a different <i>baraita</i>, which states that there are <b>forty-seven</b> presentations of that blood? The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> statement, that there are forty-three presentations, is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the one who says</b> that the High Priest <b>mixes</b> the blood of the bull and the goat before placing it <b>on the corners</b> of the inner altar, rather than placing the blood of each one separately. <b>And that</b> statement, that there are forty-seven presentations, is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the one who says</b> that the High Priest <b>does not mix</b> the two types of blood before placing them on the corners, but sprinkles four times from the blood of the bull and another four times from the blood of the goat, and only afterward mixes the blood of the two animals for placement on the top of the altar.",
            "The Gemara raises another difficulty: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in yet another <i>baraita</i> that there are <b>forty-eight</b> presentations? The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult.

Concerning this, <b>a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If one <b>had intent of <i>piggul</i> during</b> the <b>conveying</b> of the handful to the altar but not during the conveying of the frankincense, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> one can understand the ruling of <b>Reish Lakish,</b> as the conveying of the handful is only part of the permitting factors, since <b>there is also the conveying of</b> the <b>frankincense.

            "<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>But</b> what about <b>the slaughter of one of the lambs</b> brought with the two loaves on <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>which</b> is <b>a rite that does not permit</b> the offering, as neither the sacrifice of its portions designated for burning upon the altar nor the consumption of the meat of the offering and the two loaves is permitted by this slaughter, <b>and</b> yet the Rabbis <b>disagree</b> with Rabbi Meir in this case?",

            "Rava <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>Do you maintain</b> that the two loaves of <b>bread</b> are already <b>sanctified</b> from when they are <b>in the oven,</b> and require only the sprinkling of the blood to render them permitted for consumption? In fact, <b>the slaughter of the lambs sanctifies</b> the loaves, <b>and</b> an act <b>that comes to sanctify is considered like</b> that which <b>comes to permit.</b> Since the slaughter of the two lambs sanctifies the loaves, the slaughter of each lamb is considered half a permitting factor; the slaughter of each lamb independently cannot render the loaves <i>piggul</i>.",
            "<b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> that discusses the slaughter of the Paschal offering. The first <i>tanna</i> rules that if one slaughtering the Paschal offering intended for it to be consumed by both disqualified individuals, e.g., uncircumcised males, and fit individuals, e.g., circumcised males, the offering is not disqualified. <b><i>Aḥerim</i> say:</b> In a case where one slaughtered a Paschal offering and severed one of the two organs of ritual slaughter with a disqualifying intention, and severed the other organ with a valid intention, then if one’s intent with regard to <b>circumcised</b> males <b>preceded the</b> intent with regard to the <b>uncircumcised</b> males, the offering is <b>valid.</b> But if the intent with regard to the <b>uncircumcised</b> males <b>preceded</b> the intent with regard to the <b>circumcised</b> males, it is <b>disqualified.</b>",

            "The Gemara clarifies the proof: <b>What, is it not</b> correct to say that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to the <b>conveying</b> of the handful <b>for burning</b> upon the altar, in which case it is teaching that intent of <i>piggul</i> with regard to the handful during its conveying renders the offering <i>piggul</i>? The Gemara responds: <b>No;</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to the <b>conveying of</b> the handful before its <b>placement</b> into the service <b>vessel</b> that sanctifies it. Since the frankincense is not placed into a vessel, in this case the conveying of the handful alone is considered the performance of the entire rite.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> why does the <i>baraita</i> state: <b>During the placement</b> of the handful in <b>a vessel or during the conveying?</b> This indicates that it is referring to an act of conveying that occurs after the placement. <b>It should have</b> stated: <b>During the conveying or during the placement</b> of the handful in <b>a vessel.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as one should emend the <i>baraita</i> and <b>teach</b> it in <b>that</b> order, i.e., with the conveying before the placement.",
            "The Gemara raises another objection from the next clause of the same <i>baraita</i>: Once <b>he comes to</b> perform <b>the burning</b> of the handful, there is no liability to receive <i>karet</i> unless he has intent of <i>piggul</i> during the sacrifice of the frankincense as well. The Gemara asks: According to Reish Lakish, the <i>baraita</i> <b>should have</b> stated: Once <b>he comes to</b> perform <b>the conveying</b> and to perform the burning. Reish Lakish maintains that the conveying mentioned previously in the <i>baraita</i> occurs earlier, before its placement into a service vessel, which means that there is another act of conveying. The Gemara responds: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult; since</b> this <b>conveying is for the purpose of burning, it is called burning</b> in the <i>baraita</i>.",

            "§ The Gemara continues its discussion of <i>piggul</i> intent that occurred during the sacrifice of part of a permitting factor.

            "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>From where</b> is this conclusion drawn? <b>Perhaps Rabbi Meir states</b> that one renders an offering <i>piggul</i> on account of <i>piggul</i> intent during the sacrifice of part of the permitting factors <b>only there, where he had intent with regard to its</b> entire <b>measure.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And does Shmuel not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> for all <b>generations from a temporary</b> situation? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 88a): Service <b>vessels</b> used for <b>the liquids sanctify</b> only <b>the liquids</b> placed in them, <b>and</b> service vessels used to <b>measure dry</b> substances <b>sanctify</b> only <b>the dry</b> substances that are placed in them. <b>But</b> service <b>vessels</b> used for <b>the liquids do not sanctify the dry</b> substances placed in them, <b>and</b> service vessels used to <b>measure dry</b> substances <b>do not sanctify the liquids</b> placed in them.",

The sons of Aaron shall sacrifice it before the Lord, in front of the altar” (Leviticus 6:7). From the phrase: <b>“Before the Lord,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that the meal offering must be brought <b>on the western</b> side of the altar, which faces the Sanctuary and is therefore “before the Lord.” Therefore, <b>the verse states: “In front of the altar,”</b> which is its southern side, where the priests ascend the ramp.",

            "He explains: <b>As, when you say</b> to bring the meal offering <b>“before the Lord,”</b> which indicates that it shall be brought <b>on the western</b> side, <b>you have nullified</b> the other part of the verse, which states to bring it <b>“in front of the altar,”</b> which is <b>on the southern</b> side. <b>But when you say</b> to bring the meal offering <b>“in front of the altar”</b> and offer it <b>on the southern</b> side, <b>you have</b> also <b>fulfilled</b> the other part of the verse, which states to bring it <b>“before the Lord.”</b>",

            "Rav Kahana <b>said to</b> the sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya: <b>Did we learn</b> in the mishna that <b>a vessel connects</b> the contents within it? <b>We learned</b> that <b>a vessel joins</b> the contents within it, indicating that it does so in <b>any</b> case, whether or not the contents are in contact with one another.

Are the first two half-tenths rendered impure?",
            "Rav Kahana <b>said to them:</b> Only when an item <b>requires a vessel</b> in order for it to be sanctified, e.g., in the case of the two half-tenths of an ephah of a meal offering, does the <b>vessel join it</b> together. In the case of an item that <b>does not require a vessel,</b> such as this half-tenth that was placed between them, the <b>vessel does not join it.</b>",
            "The sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya then asked: If <b>one who immersed that day inserted his finger between</b> the two half-tenths of the ephah that were placed in the receptacle, without touching either one, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Are the two half-tenths rendered impure? Rav Kahana <b>said to them</b> in response: The <b>only item you have that transmits impurity through its airspace</b> is <b>an earthenware vessel alone.</b>",

Can one <b>remove a handful from this</b> half-tenth of an ephah <b>on</b> behalf of <b>that</b> half-tenth of an ephah? Is the <b>joining</b> of the contents of the vessel effective <b>by Torah law or by rabbinic law?</b> If it is effective by Torah law, then the removal of the handful is valid. If it is effective by rabbinic law, then the removal of the handful was not performed correctly, since it was not taken from the entire tenth of an ephah of the meal offering.",
            "<b>They said to</b> Rav Kahana: <b>We did not hear</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>this</b> case explicitly, but <b>we heard</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a case <b>similar to this.

            "They explain: <b>In any event,</b> the mishna teaches that in a case <b>when he can remove a handful</b> from each meal offering, the meal offerings <b>are fit. Why</b> is this considered a valid removal of the handful? <b>But this</b> part of the meal offering <b>that is intermingled</b> with the other meal offering <b>does not touch</b> the part of the meal offering from which the handful is removed. Evidently, the vessel joins the different parts of the meal offering together, and one can remove the handful from any part of its contents, even if they are not touching.",
            "<b>Rava said:</b> This cannot be inferred from the mishna, as <b>perhaps</b> the ruling of the mishna is stated <b>with regard to</b> a case where the <b>clumps</b> of the meal offering <b>are divided like</b> the teeth of <b>a comb,</b> so that although the handful is removed from a clump of the meal offering that is separate from the clump that is intermingled with the other offering, all parts of the meal offering are still in contact with one another. It may still be that in the case presented by Rav Kahana, where the parts are truly separated from one another, it is possible that one cannot remove the handful from one part on behalf of the other.",
            "The Gemara asks: Since this question was not resolved, <b>what</b> halakhic conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> this matter? <b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And he shall take up from it</b> his handful” (Leviticus 6:8), meaning that he shall take the handful <b>from</b> the meal offering <b>that is connected.</b> This teaches <b>that one shall not bring a tenth</b> of an ephah divided <b>in two vessels and remove the handful</b> from one on behalf of the other. It can therefore be inferred that <b>in</b> the case of <b>one vessel</b> that is <b>similar to two vessels,</b> as the entirety of the meal offering is brought in one vessel although the different parts are not touching, one may <b>remove the handful</b> from one part on behalf of the other part.",
            "<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>Perhaps</b> one could say: <b>What are the circumstances</b> when the <i>baraita</i> states that one may not bring a tenth of an ephah in <b>two vessels?</b> The circumstances are, <b>for example,</b> if one hollowed out the area of a smaller <b><i>kefiza</i></b> measure <b>within</b> the area of a larger <b><i>kav</i></b> measure, so that within the one receptacle there were two cavities divided by a partition that did not reach the top of the receptacle. In this case, <b>even though</b> the two <b>are intermingled on top,</b> above the partition, <b>since the partition of the <i>kefiza</i></b> measure <b>divides</b> them <b>below,</b> they are still separated and not joined together.",

            "<b>Rav Sheshet objects to this: And are you able to reverse</b> the opinions and say that according to Rabbi Eliezer the frontplate does not effect acceptance for the impurity of portions that are to be eaten? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that</b> one who partakes of <b>impure sacrificial meat,</b> i.e., one who partakes of the meat while in a state of ritual impurity, <b>before the sprinkling of the blood</b> takes place, is <b>liable for</b> eating <b>it due to</b> violation of the prohibition against partaking of the meat while <b>ritually impure.</b>",
            "To counter this, <b>the verse states: “Every one that is ritually pure may eat of it”</b> (Leviticus 7:19), and immediately afterward the verse states: <b>“But the soul that eats of the meat of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that belong to the Lord, having his impurity upon him,</b> that soul <b>shall be cut off</b> from his people” (Leviticus 7:20). The juxtaposition of these verses teaches that if one who is impure partakes of <b>that which has become permitted to those who are ritually pure,</b> he is <b>liable for</b> eating <b>it due to</b> violation of the prohibition against partaking of the meat while <b>ritually impure.</b>",
            "<b>But</b> if one who is impure partakes of <b>that which is not permitted to those who are pure,</b> he is <b>not liable for</b> eating <b>it due to</b> violation of the prohibition against partaking of the meat while <b>ritually impure.</b> Since it is not permitted to eat the sacrificial meat before the sprinkling of the blood, one who partakes of it at that point is not liable to receive <i>karet</i> for eating it while ritually impure.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Or</b> perhaps, <b>is</b> the verse teaching <b>only</b> that if one who is impure partakes of that which <b>is eaten by those who are ritually pure,</b> he is <b>liable for</b> eating <b>it due to</b> violation of the prohibition against partaking of the meat while <b>ritually impure; but</b> in a case <b>where</b> he partakes of <b>that which is not eaten by those who are ritually pure,</b> he is <b>not liable for</b> eating <b>it due to</b> violation of the prohibition against partaking of the meat while <b>ritually impure</b> despite the fact that its blood has already been sprinkled? <b>I would</b> then <b>exclude</b> sacrificial meat <b>that</b> was <b>left overnight and</b> meat <b>that leaves</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>which are not</b> permitted to be <b>eaten by those who are ritually pure,</b> and I would derive that one who is impure who partakes of them is not liable for eating them.",
            "Therefore, <b>the verse states: “That belong to the Lord,”</b> which teaches that the verse <b>included</b> leftover meat and meat that leaves the Temple courtyard in the prohibition, and one who partakes of them while impure is liable for partaking of them.",
            "One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I include</b> in the prohibition <b>the</b> meat that was rendered <b><i>piggul</i></b> through one’s intention of consuming it after its designated time <b>and the</b> meat that was rendered <b><i>notar</i>.</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> interjects: <b>Isn’t <i>notar</i></b> identical to meat that was <b>left overnight,</b> and it has already been established that one is liable for partaking of leftover meat while in an impure state? <b>Rather,</b> what is meant is as follows: One might have thought to include in the prohibition <b>even the</b> meats that were rendered <b><i>piggul</i>,</b> just <b>as <i>notar</i></b> is included. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Of the meat of the sacrifice of peace offerings,”</b> and the term “of the meat” <b>excluded</b> one who is impure who partakes of <i>piggul</i>.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>And what did you see to include these,</b> i.e., leftover meat and meat that leaves the courtyard, <b>and to exclude those,</b> i.e., <i>piggul</i>? It answers: <b>After the verse included</b> some offerings <b>and excluded</b> others, <b>you</b> should <b>say</b> the following: <b>I include these,</b> the leftover meat and the meat that leaves the Temple courtyard, <b>as they had a period of fitness</b> after their blood was sprinkled, before they were rendered unfit by being left over or by leaving the Temple courtyard. <b>And I exclude those,</b> <i>piggul</i>, <b>as they never had a period of fitness,</b> as they were already unfit when the blood was sprinkled.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>And if you say</b> that if that is the case, then with regard to sacrificial <b>meat that became impure before the sprinkling of the blood, and</b> one who was impure <b>ate it after the sprinkling of the blood, for what</b> reason is he <b>liable for</b> eating <b>it due to</b> violation of the prohibition against partaking of the meat while <b>ritually impure</b> if it never had a period of fitness? The answer is that he is liable <b>because the frontplate effects acceptance</b> and the sprinkling is valid.",
            "It arises from this <i>baraita</i> that if the offering <b>became impure,</b> then <b>yes,</b> the frontplate effects acceptance; but in the case of sacrificial meat that <b>leaves</b> the Temple courtyard, the frontplate <b>does not</b> effect acceptance, and therefore it was never considered to have a period of fitness.",
            "Rav Sheshet now states his question: <b>Who did you hear who says</b> that the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood is <b>not effective</b> in the case of sacrificial meat that <b>leaves</b> the Temple courtyard? This is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> as seen in tractate <i>Me’ila</i> (6b), <b>and</b> yet although this <i>baraita</i> is then clearly in accordance with his opinion, it <b>teaches that</b> the <b>frontplate effects acceptance for</b> the impurity of the portions of offerings that are to be <b>eaten.</b> Therefore, this too is the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, and the opinions in the <i>baraita</i> cited above should not be reversed.",

            "Rava’s statement accords with the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> With regard to <b>all the offerings in the Torah from which there remains an olive-bulk of meat</b> that is fit to be eaten <b>or an olive-bulk of fat</b> that is fit to be sacrificed on the altar, the priest <b>sprinkles the blood.</b> Similarly, if a part of the remainder can be eaten the handful is still sacrificed, as the status of the remainder relative to the handful corresponds to the status of the meat relative to the blood.",

            "The Gemara questions the last ruling of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is</b> the mention of <b>a meal offering doing</b> here?

The Gemara answers: The <i>halakha</i> that the priest sprinkles the blood in that case is derived from <b>that</b> which <b>is taught</b> at the end of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And with regard to a meal offering, although all of it remains</b> pure, the priest <b>shall not sprinkle</b> the blood.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>?

Rabbi Yoḥanan derived from this verse that the majority of the handful must be consumed by the fire, since the priests are instructed to make the handful smoke, as it is written: “And the priest shall make the memorial part thereof smoke upon the altar” (Leviticus 2:2).",
            "<b>Ravin bar Rav Adda said to Rava: Your students say</b> that <b>Rav Amram said</b> that <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> with regard to <b>items whose</b> usual <b>manner</b> is <b>to be sacrificed at night, for example,</b> the <b>limbs</b> of the burnt offering <b>and</b> the <b>fats [<i>pedarim</i>]</b> of the burnt offering, <b>that</b> the priest <b>may bring them up and burn them after sunset and they are consumed throughout the entire night.</b> This is derived from the verse: “This is the law of the burnt offering: It is that which goes up on its firewood upon the altar all night unto the morning” (Leviticus 6:2).",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: With regard to <b>items whose</b> usual <b>manner is to be sacrificed during the day, for example, the handful</b> of the meal offering, <b>the frankincense, the incense, the meal offering of priests, the meal offering of</b> the <b>anointed priest,</b> i.e., the High Priest, <b>and the meal offering</b> that accompanies the <b>libations,</b> from where is it derived <b>that</b> the priest <b>may bring them up and burn them after sunset?</b>",
            "The Gemara interjects: Why would they be allowed to be burned after sunset? <b>But didn’t you say</b> that these are items <b>whose</b> usual <b>manner is to be sacrificed during the day?</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>Rather,</b> the question of the <i>baraita</i> is as follows: <b>From where</b> is it derived that these items may be brought up and burned concurrent <b>with the setting of the sun,</b> in <b>which</b> case <b>they are consumed throughout the entire night</b> and not during the day? <b>The verse states: “This is the law of the burnt offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:2), which <b>included</b> everything that is sacrificed on the altar.",
            "Ravin bar Rav Adda challenges: <b>But</b> if the handful is brought up and burned concurrent <b>with the setting of the sun, you do not find that the majority of it is consumed by the fire</b> before sunset. How does this <i>baraita</i> accord with Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement that the majority of the handful must be consumed by the fire in order to render permitted the consumption of the remainder by the priests? The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> where the <i>baraita</i> does not require the consumption by fire of the majority of the handful, it is referring only to that which is required in order for the altar <b>to receive</b> the handful, so that it is considered the food of the altar and may continue to burn all night long. <b>There,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan states that in order <b>to render permitted</b> the consumption of the remainder by the priests, the majority of the handful must be consumed by the fire.",
            "The Gemara notes: <b>Rabbi Elazar teaches</b> the <i>baraita</i> the way it was initially presented, as asking how it is known that items that are usually sacrificed during the day may be burned <b>after sunset. And he interprets</b> the <i>baraita</i> as referring <b>to</b> parts of the offering that were <b>dislodged</b> from the fire after sunset, which may be returned to the fire throughout the night. <b>And similarly, when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia he said that <b>Rabbi Yannai said</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> parts that were <b>dislodged</b> from the fire after sunset.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabbi Yannai</b> in fact <b>say this? But doesn’t Rabbi Yannai say:</b> In the case of <b>incense that was dislodged from on top of the altar,</b> the priests <b>may not return even small lumps of it</b> to the fire? <b>And</b> similarly, <b>Rav Ḥanina bar Minyumi from the school of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“That which the fire will consume of the burnt offering on the altar”</b> (Leviticus 6:3). This teaches that if parts <b>of a burnt offering</b> that were partially <b>consumed</b> were dislodged from the external altar <b>you shall return</b> them, <b>but you do not return incense</b> that was partially <b>consumed</b> and was dislodged from the internal altar.

            "<b>Ravina said</b> that it <b>was necessary for</b> the verse to emphasize that these prohibitions apply to <b>priests</b> for the following reason: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since pinching is permitted with regard to</b> priests, therefore an animal <b>carcass or a <i>tereifa</i> should also be permitted</b> for them. A bird sin offering is killed by a priest pinching the nape of its neck. This is not a valid method of slaughter and would generally render a bird or animal an unslaughtered carcass, yet the priests are permitted to partake of the bird sin offering. Consequently, one might think that the prohibitions against eating an animal carcass or a <i>tereifa</i> in general do not apply to priests. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that these prohibitions apply to priests as well.",

            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The verse must be reinterpreted as referring to the bull for an unwitting communal sin, which is brought when the majority of the Jewish people have sinned as a result of following a mistaken ruling of the Sanhedrin. <b>These</b> seven alluded to in the verse are <b>seven tribes who sinned.</b> In such a case, a bull for an unwitting communal sin is brought <b>even though</b> the number of individuals who sinned <b>are not the majority of the congregation.</b> Because the majority of the individuals in the majority of the tribes have sinned, it is considered a sin of the congregation and not sins of many individuals.",
            "Similarly, the word <b>“month [<i>ḥodesh</i>]”</b> is to be interpreted as meaning that a bull for an unwitting communal sin is brought <b>if</b> the court <b>innovated [<i>ḥiddeshu</i>]</b> a new <i>halakha</i> contradicting the Torah, e.g., if <b>they said</b> that eating forbidden <b>fat</b> is <b>permitted.</b> The continuation of the verse: <b>“For every one that errs, and for him that is simple,” teaches that</b> the Sanhedrin is <b>liable</b> to sacrifice the bull for unwitting communal sin <b>only for a matter</b> that was <b>hidden</b> from the Sanhedrin, i.e., about which the Sanhedrin issued a mistaken ruling, and <b>accompanied by unwitting action</b> by the majority of the community, who relied on the mistaken ruling.",

            "The verbal analogy teaches that <b>just as there</b> the requirement that it be done as prescribed is referring to the <b>loaves</b> rather than the sheep, <b>so too here</b> it is referring to the <b>loaves</b> rather than the sheep. Consequently, failure to bring the loaves prevents sacrifice of the sheep, but failure to sacrifice the sheep does not prevent the bringing of the loaves.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how did Rabbi Shimon <b>ben Nannas,</b> who holds that failure to sacrifice the sheep prevents the bringing of the loaves but failure to bring the loaves does not prevent sacrifice of the sheep, derive his ruling? <b>He derived</b> the <i>halakha</i> through a verbal analogy between the verse: <b>“They shall be [<i>yihyu</i>]</b> holy to the Lord for the priest,” and the verse that states, concerning the seven sheep brought as burnt offerings: <b>“They shall be [<i>yihyu</i>]</b> a burnt offering to the Lord” (Leviticus 23:18). <b>Just as there</b> the requirement that it be done as prescribed is referring to the <b>sheep, so too here</b> it is referring to <b>sheep</b> rather than loaves.",

            "On the one hand, one might say that <b>since the loaves are primary</b> and this set of loaves has not yet been waved, <b>it requires waving.

            "§ <b>Abaye said to Rava: What is different</b> about the <b>two sheep</b> brought as peace offerings together with the two loaves of <i>Shavuot</i>, such <b>that their</b> slaughter <b>sanctifies the loaves</b> (see 47a), <b>and</b> according to Rabbi Yoḥanan failure to sacrifice them once they have been slaughtered <b>prevents</b> the bringing of the loaves; <b>and what is different</b> about the <b>seven sheep, the bull, and</b> the two <b>rams</b> brought on <i>Shavuot</i> as an additional offering, such <b>that their</b> slaughter <b>does not sanctify</b> the <b>loaves, and</b> failure to sacrifice them <b>does not prevent</b> the bringing of the loaves?",
            "Rava <b>said to</b> Abaye: The reason for the distinction is <b>because</b> the two sheep and the loaves brought as peace offerings <b>are bound to each other through the waving.</b> This is not so with regard to the additional offerings, which are not waved with the loaves. The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a thanks offering</b> and its loaves, which are not waved together, <b>they are not bound to each other through waving, and</b> nevertheless the slaughter of the animal offering <b>sanctifies</b> the loaves <b>and</b> failure to sacrifice the animal offering <b>prevents</b> the bringing of the loaves. This indicates that the waving is not the critical factor.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the reason for the distinction is that the two sheep brought as peace offerings are <b>comparable to a thanks offering.

            "The Gemara responds: <b>Are</b> the two sheep of <i>Shavuot</i> and the thanks offering really <b>comparable? There,</b> in the case of the thanks offering, <b>there are no other animal offerings</b> brought <b>with it.</b> But <b>here,</b> in the case of the offerings brought on <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>where there are other animal offerings</b> brought <b>with it, let these</b> peace offerings <b>and those</b> additional offerings <b>sanctify</b> the loaves.

            "<b>Rather,</b> the reason for the distinction is that the two sheep brought as peace offerings are <b>comparable to a nazirite’s ram,</b> which is sacrificed as a peace offering when he completes his term of naziriteship, in addition to a lamb that he sacrifices as a burnt offering, a female lamb that he brings then as a sin offering, and the nazirite loaves (see Numbers 6:14–15). <b>Just as</b> in the case of a <b>nazirite’s ram, even though there are other offerings</b> brought with it, nevertheless <b>it is</b> the slaughter of the <b>peace offering that sanctifies</b> the nazirite loaves and <b>not</b> the slaughter of <b>anything else, here too,</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>is no different,</b> and it is specifically the slaughter of the peace offerings that sanctifies the loaves.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And there,</b> in the case of the offerings of the nazirite, <b>from where do we</b> derive that it is specifically the slaughter of the peace offering that sanctifies the loaves?

This verse, which connects the ram and the loaves, <b>teaches that the basket</b> of the nazirite loaves <b>comes</b> as <b>an obligation for the ram,</b> which is a peace offering, <b>and the slaughter of the ram sanctifies</b> the loaves. <b>Therefore,</b> if the slaughter was unfit, e.g., in a case where <b>he slaughtered</b> the ram <b>not for the sake of</b> a peace offering, <b>the loaves were not sanctified.</b>",
            "§ The mishna teaches that according to Rabbi Akiva failure to sacrifice the two sheep brought as peace offerings does not prevent sacrifice of the loaves. Consequently, if there are no sheep, the loaves are sacrificed by themselves.

            "The Gemara challenges: <b>Whichever way you</b> look at it, this is difficult: <b>If</b> the loaves are <b>brought</b> and waved in order <b>to be eaten, let</b> the priests <b>eat them</b> rather than burn them. <b>If</b> they are <b>brought</b> only <b>to be burned, let</b> the priests <b>burn them immediately. Why are they</b> left overnight so that they undergo <b>a decay of form,</b> i.e., become disqualified?",
            "<b>Rabba said: Actually,</b> the loaves are <b>brought</b> and waved in order <b>to be eaten.</b> Nevertheless, the Sages instituted a rabbinic <b>decree</b> that they not be eaten out of concern <b>lest sheep become available to</b> the nation <b>the following year, and they</b> might <b>say: Didn’t we eat the loaves without</b> any accompanying <b>sheep last year [<i>eshtakad</i>]?

But <b>now that there are sheep, it is</b> the sacrifice of <b>the sheep that permits</b> the loaves to be eaten. Since loaves brought without sheep are fit by Torah law and may not be eaten due to rabbinic decree, they may not be burned until they become disqualified by remaining overnight.",
            "<b>Rabba said: From where do I say</b> this, i.e., what is the source for my statement?

            "Rabbi Yehuda added that <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said to</b> ben Bukhri: <b>That is not</b> the case, <b>rather, any priest who does not contribute his</b> half-<b>shekel</b> is considered <b>a sinner,</b> as they are obligated in this mitzva like all other Jews. <b>But the priests</b> who do not contribute the half-shekel <b>interpret this</b> following <b>verse to their own</b> advantage in order to excuse themselves from the mitzva.",
            "The verse states: <b>“And every meal offering of the priest shall be wholly made to smoke; it shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 6:16).

            "Rabba discusses this mishna: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>these two loaves?

            "<b>Rather,</b> is it <b>not</b> referring to a case <b>where</b> the two loaves are <b>brought by themselves,</b> and the mishna <b>teaches</b> that the priests claimed: <b>How</b> can <b>they be eaten?

            "<b>Abaye said to</b> Rabba in response: <b>Actually,</b> the mishna can be interpreted as referring <b>to</b> loaves <b>brought with the animal offering,</b> and therefore it does not prove that when the two loaves are brought by themselves they may be eaten. <b>And as for that which</b> is <b>difficult for you</b> based <b>on</b> the case of <b>a thanks offering and its loaves,</b> the resolution is that the <b>loaves of a thanks offering are not called a meal offering,</b> and therefore even when a priest brings a thanks offering, the loaves may be eaten. By contrast, <b>the two loaves</b> of <i>Shavuot</i> <b>are called a meal offering, as it is stated</b> with regard to the two loaves: “Also in the day of the first fruits, <b>when you bring a new meal offering to the Lord”</b> (Numbers 28:26). Therefore, the priests held that if they would donate half-shekels, the two loaves would not be permitted to be eaten.",
            "<b>Rav Yosef said</b> a different response to Rabba’s proof: <b>Actually,</b> when the two loaves of <i>Shavuot</i> are brought by themselves <b>they come to be burned,</b> i.e., they may not be eaten. <b>And this is the reason that we do not burn them</b> until the following day: It is <b>because one may not burn consecrated</b> items <b>on a Festival.</b>",
            "<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>Is</b> the burning of the two loaves <b>comparable</b> to the burning of other consecrated items, such that the loaves may not be burned right away for this reason? <b>There,</b> in the case of other consecrated items, <b>this is not their mitzva,</b> i.e., they are supposed to be eaten, but if they become disqualified they must be burned. Conversely, <b>here,</b> in the case of the two loaves of <i>Shavuot</i> that are brought by themselves, <b>where this is their mitzva,</b> i.e., they are supposed to be burned, <b>let</b> the priests <b>burn them</b> on the Festival, <b>just as is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case <b>of the bull and the goat of Yom Kippur,</b> which are burned on Yom Kippur despite the fact that it is a Festival.",
            "<b>Rather, Rav Yosef said:</b> The reason the loaves are left overnight is due to a rabbinic <b>decree</b> not to burn them immediately, <b>lest sheep become available to</b> the nation <b>afterward,</b> i.e., later in the day, in which case the loaves could be waved with them and then eaten. <b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: That <b>works out well</b> for the <b>entire time</b> period when <b>they</b> may be <b>sacrificed,</b> i.e., until the afternoon daily offering is sacrificed. But <b>after that, let them burn</b> the loaves immediately and not wait until the next day. Rav Yosef replied: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase in the <i>baraita</i> <b>that teaches</b> that the loaves must be left until <b>their form decays?</b> It means that they must be left until <b>the form of their sacrifice</b> has passed, i.e., until after the time when the sheep could be sacrificed.",
            "<b>Rava said</b> that there is a different response to Rabba’s proof: When the two loaves of <i>Shavuot</i> are brought by themselves, by Torah law <b>they come to be eaten, but</b> due to rabbinic <b>decree</b> they are not eaten and are left overnight until they are disqualified. The reason for the decree is <b>due to</b> that <b>which Rabba</b> said, i.e., due to the concern that the following year sheep will be available and nevertheless the nation will bring the two loaves without sheep. <b>But</b> the proof that by Torah law the loaves may be eaten is <b>not from</b> Rabba’s line of <b>reasoning,</b> i.e., from the mishna in <i>Shekalim</i>; <b>rather,</b> it is <b>from a verse.</b>",
            "<b>And Rava said</b> by way of explanation: <b>From where do I state</b> this <i>halakha</i>?

Since the sprinkling of the blood was not valid, the meat, which would have become permitted for the priests to eat, retains the status of “the sacred items of the Lord,” and the prohibition against misuse of consecrated property still applies.",

            "§ The Gemara continues its discussion of the sheep of <i>Shavuot</i>. <b>When Rav Yitzḥak came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia he reported traditions that he learned in Eretz Yisrael, and <b>he taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a case of the two <b>sheep</b> of <b><i>Shavuot</i> where one slaughtered them not in accordance with their mitzva,</b> e.g., he slaughtered them for the sake of a different offering, they are <b>disqualified; and</b> they should be left overnight until <b>their form decays</b> and they attain the status of leftover sacrificial meat, <b>and</b> then <b>they are brought out to the place</b> designated <b>for burning.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Naḥman said</b> to Rav Yitzḥak: The <b>Master,</b> i.e., Rav Yitzḥak, <b>who compares</b> the sheep of <i>Shavuot</i> <b>to a sin offering</b> because they are juxtaposed in a verse (see Leviticus 23:19), <b>teaches:</b> The sheep are <b>disqualified,</b> like a sin offering that was slaughtered not for its own sake. By contrast, the <b><i>tanna</i> of the school of Levi, who derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>an obligatory peace offering,</b> e.g., the two sheep of <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a voluntary peace offering, teaches</b> that the two sheep remain <b>valid</b> offerings, just as a voluntary peace offering remains valid even if it is slaughtered for the sake of a different offering.",
            "<b>As Levi teaches: And</b> with regard to the <b>other peace offerings of a nazirite that one slaughtered not in accordance with their mitzva,</b> they are <b>valid</b> offerings like voluntary peace offerings, <b>but they do not satisfy the obligation of the owner</b> to bring the required nazirite peace offerings. <b>And</b> these offerings <b>are eaten for</b> only <b>one day and one night,</b> in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> concerning the peace offerings of nazirite, and not for two days and one night like voluntary peace offerings. They <b>require neither bread nor</b> the <b>foreleg,</b> unlike the required peace offering of a nazirite.",
            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rav Yitzḥak from that which was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case where one is obligated to sacrifice as <b>a guilt offering</b> an animal <b>in its</b> first <b>year,</b> which the Torah calls a lamb, <b>and</b> instead he <b>brought</b> an animal <b>in its second</b> year, which is considered a ram; or if he is obligated to sacrifice as a guilt offering an animal <b>in its second</b> year <b>and he brought</b> an animal <b>in its</b> first <b>year;</b> the offerings are <b>disqualified.</b> They are to be left overnight until <b>their form decays, and are brought out to the place</b> designated for <b>burning.</b>",
            "<b>But</b> in the case of <b>the burnt offering of a nazirite,</b> i.e., the lamb that is sacrificed when he completes his naziriteship; <b>or the burnt offering of a woman after childbirth,</b> i.e., the lamb she sacrifices on the forty-first day after giving birth to a son or on the eighty-first day after giving birth to a daughter; <b>or the burnt offering of a leper,</b> i.e., the lamb that is sacrificed after he is purified; in all of these cases if the animals <b>were in their second year</b> instead, <b>and one slaughtered them,</b> the offerings are <b>valid.</b>",

This demonstrates that the <i>halakhot</i> of obligatory burnt offerings are derived from those of voluntary burnt offerings, despite the fact that the burnt offering of a nazirite is juxtaposed to the sin offering of a nazirite (see Numbers 6:14) and the burnt offering of a leper is juxtaposed to the sin offering of a leper (see Leviticus 14:19). Similarly, the <i>halakha</i> pertaining to the sheep of <i>Shavuot</i>, which are obligatory peace offerings, should be derived from the <i>halakha</i> pertaining to voluntary peace offerings, and not from the <i>halakha</i> pertaining to a sin offering as Rav Yitzḥak holds.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>This <i>tanna</i>,</b> who taught this <i>baraita</i>, <b>is</b> the <b><i>tanna</i> of the school of Levi</b> cited earlier, who holds that if one slaughters a sheep of <i>Shavuot</i> not for its own sake, it is nevertheless valid.",

            "<b>Rabbi Zeira raises an objection</b> to Rabba’s opinion that erroneous uprooting of the status of an offering does not constitute uprooting. A <i>baraita</i> teaches that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: All meal offerings</b> from which <b>the handful was removed not for their sake are</b> entirely <b>valid, and have</b> even <b>satisfied the obligation of the owner,</b> unlike animal offerings slaughtered not for their sake, which do not satisfy the obligation of the owner.",

            "<b>Rav Naḥman said to</b> the <i>tanna</i>: <b>Granted,</b> the half that was not sacrificed by the <b>first</b> High Priest should be left overnight before it is burned, because it was initially <b>fit for sacrifice</b> before the first High Priest died. <b>But</b> with regard to the half that was not sacrificed by the <b>second</b> High Priest, <b>why</b> must <b>it</b> be left overnight so that its <b>form decays?</b> It was <b>brought to be lost from the outset,</b> i.e., when the full tenth of an ephah was brought it was known that only half would be sacrificed and half would be lost. Consequently, it is unnecessary to leave it overnight before burning it.",
            "Rav Naḥman continued: <b>Who is</b> the one <b>who said</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>to you? It was the <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabba bar Avuh, who says:</b> All disqualified offerings, <b>even <i>piggul</i>,</b> which is disqualified by Torah law, <b>require decay of form</b> before they are burned.",
            "<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> can be understood <b>even</b> if <b>you say</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> who disagree with Rabba bar Avuh and hold that <i>piggul</i> does not require decay of form.

            "§ The Gemara cites that which <b>was stated</b> further about the griddle-cake offering: <b>How are the griddle-cake</b> offerings of <b>the High Priest prepared?</b> The verse seems to prescribe a variety of methods of preparation: “On a griddle it shall be made with oil; when it is soaked, you shall bring it in; and baked pieces [<i>tufinei</i>] of the meal offering shall you sacrifice for a pleasing aroma to the Lord” (Leviticus 6:14). <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> says that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that it is prepared in the following manner: The individual preparing it <b>bakes it</b> in an oven <b>and afterward he fries it</b> in a pan. <b>Rabbi Asi</b> says that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says</b> that it is prepared in the following manner: The individual preparing it <b>fries it</b> in a pan <b>and afterward he bakes</b> it in an oven.",
            "<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: It stands to reason in accordance with my</b> opinion because the verse states: “And baked pieces [<i>tufinei</i>] of the meal offering.” The word for <b>baked pieces [<i>tufinei</i>]</b> should be understood as meaning that <b>they shall be baked</b> when they are still <b>beautiful [<i>te’afena na’a</i>],</b> i.e., before being fried. <b>Rabbi Asi said: It stands to reason in accordance with my</b> opinion because the word <i>tufinei</i> should be understood as meaning that <b>they shall be baked</b> when they are already <b>partially cooked [<i>te’afena na</i>],</b> i.e., after being fried.",
            "This dispute between the <i>amora’im</i> is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i></b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The word for baked pieces [<i>tufinei</i>] should be understood as meaning that <b>they shall be baked</b> when they are already <b>partially cooked [<i>te’afena na</i>]. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> It should be understood as meaning that <b>they shall be baked</b> when they are still <b>beautiful [<i>te’afena na’a</i>]. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The word <i>tufinei</i> is plural, indicating that the pieces <b>should be baked extensively,</b> i.e., more than once. Consequently, Rabbi Yosei <b>accepts</b> the opinion that the pieces should be baked when they are already <b>partially cooked, and he</b> also <b>accepts</b> the opinion that they should be baked when they are <b>beautiful.</b> Therefore the offering should first be baked, then fried, then baked again.",
            "§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (96a): Concerning the twelve loaves of <b>the High Priest’s griddle-cake</b> offering, of which six are sacrificed in the morning and six in the evening, <b>their kneading, and forming of their</b> loaves, <b>and their baking are</b> performed <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>and</b> all labors involved in those actions <b>override Shabbat.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter,</b> i.e., that these actions override Shabbat, derived? <b>Rav Huna said:</b> The verse says <b><i>tufinei</i>,</b> meaning that when it is already <b>baked it must</b> still <b>be beautiful [<i>te’afena na’a</i>]. And if</b> one would <b>bake it yesterday,</b> on the eve of Shabbat, <b>it</b> would become <b>swollen [<i>inshefa</i>]</b> and no longer beautiful. <b>Rav Yosef objects to this:</b> If the purpose of baking them on Shabbat is to ensure they remain fresh, <b>say that</b> the loaves should be baked before Shabbat and <b>covered with greens</b> to preserve them.",
            "The Gemara cites another explanation of why the preparation of these loaves overrides Shabbat. A Sage from <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> The verse states: “On a griddle it <b>shall be made</b> with oil” (Leviticus 6:14), which teaches that it shall be made under all circumstances, <b>even on Shabbat.</b> Similarly, this phrase <b>“shall be made”</b> teaches that it should be made <b>even in</b> a state of <b>ritual impurity.</b>",
            "<b>Abaye said</b> that there is a different explanation: The <b>verse states: “Fine flour for a meal offering perpetually”</b> (Leviticus 6:13);"
        ],
        [
            "this teaches that the <i>halakha</i> of the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest <b>is like</b> that of <b>the meal offering</b> that is a component <b>of the daily offerings.</b> The daily offerings override Shabbat, as the verse says: “This is the burnt offering of every Shabbat, beside the continual burnt offering, and the drink offering thereof” (Numbers 28:10). Therefore, preparing the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest likewise overrides Shabbat.",
            "<b>Rava said</b> that the basis for it overriding Shabbat is the fact that the verse states: <b>“On a griddle”</b> (Leviticus 6:14), which <b>teaches that</b> the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest <b>requires a vessel.</b> Therefore, <b>if he had baked it the previous day</b> rather than on Shabbat, it would be <b>disqualified by</b> being <b>left overnight,</b> since the loaves had already been consecrated in a service vessel. It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava: “On a griddle” teaches that</b> the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest <b>requires a vessel.</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: The continuation of the verse states: “It shall be made <b>with the oil.”</b> The fact that the verse makes reference to “the oil” rather than just oil indicates that one is supposed <b>to add</b> extra <b>oil to it,</b> but <b>I do not know how much</b> oil to add.",
            "Therefore <b>I</b> must <b>deduce</b> as follows: <b>It is stated here,</b> concerning the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest: <b>“Oil,” and it is stated there, with regard to the meal offering</b> brought with the <b>libations</b> that accompany animal offerings: “A tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a <i>hin</i> of beaten <b>oil”</b> (Exodus 29:40). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the meal offering brought with the libations, the amount of oil required is <b>three <i>log</i> per tenth</b> of an ephah of flour; <b>so too here,</b> in the case of the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest, one brings <b>three <i>log</i></b> of oil <b>per tenth</b> of an ephah of flour.",
            "<b>Or</b> perhaps, <b>go this way: It is stated here,</b> concerning the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest: <b>“Oil,” and it is stated with regard to</b> the <b>voluntary meal offering:</b> “And when anyone brings a meal offering to the Lord, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour <b>oil</b> upon it” (Leviticus 2:1). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the voluntary meal offering, one brings <b>one <i>log</i></b> of oil for each tenth of an ephah of flour (see 88a); <b>so too here,</b> one brings <b>one <i>log</i></b> of oil for each tenth of an ephah of flour.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> analyzes these two possibilities: <b>Let us see to which</b> case <b>it is</b> more <b>similar,</b> i.e., which is a better comparison to the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest.

            "The <i>baraita</i> continues its determination of how much oil is brought with the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest. <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says:</b> “This is the offering of Aaron…the tenth part of an ephah of <b>fine flour for a meal offering perpetually [<i>tamid</i>],</b> half of it in the morning, and half of it in the evening” (Leviticus 6:13).

In this light, the Gemara inquires: This <b><i>siur</i>,</b> mentioned by Rav Ḥisda in his suggested interpretation of the verse, is in accordance <b>with whose</b> opinion? <b>If</b> he is referring to <i>siur</i> as defined <b>by Rabbi Meir,</b> then <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> Rav Ḥisda’s objection does not arise, as Rabbi Yehuda maintains this <b>is full-fledged <i>matza</i>.</b> And <b>if</b> Rav Ḥisda is referring to <i>siur</i> as defined <b>by Rabbi Yehuda,</b> then <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir</b> Rav Ḥisda’s objection does not arise either, as Rabbi Meir holds that it <b>is full-fledged leavened bread.</b>",
            "Furthermore, <b>if</b> Rav Ḥisda is referring to <i>siur</i> as defined <b>by Rabbi Meir,</b> then even <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir</b> himself the objection does not arise. The reason is that <b>from</b> the fact that Rabbi Meir rules <b>that</b> one who eats this <i>siur</i> on Passover <b>is flogged for it,</b> this indicates that <b>it is</b> deemed <b>full-fledged leavened bread. Rather,</b> Rav Ḥisda’s objection arises with regard to leavening dough as defined <b>by Rabbi Yehuda, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who maintains that this dough is not considered full-fledged leavened bread.",
            "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak</b> also <b>objects to</b> Rabbi Ami’s explanation: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that the verse can be interpreted as follows: <b>“It shall not be baked as leavened bread,” but</b> one may bring a meal offering that has been <b>boiled,</b> as this is not leavened bread; although it is also not <i>matza</i>. The Gemara asks: This <b>boiled</b> dough, <b>what is it?</b> It is <b>poached [<i>revikha</i>],</b> as described in the verse: “In a pan it shall be made of oil, when it is soaked [<i>murbekhet</i>]” (Leviticus 6:14). If so, there is no need to derive the <i>halakha</i> of boiled dough from the verse: “It shall not be baked as leavened bread.” <b>If</b> it is a meal offering that must be <b>poached, it is</b> explicitly <b>written with regard to it</b> that it must be <b>poached.

            "The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that the verse: “It shall not be baked as leavened bread,” indicates that with regard to a meal offering <b>about which it is written</b> explicitly that it must be <b>poached,</b> it is a <b>mitzva that</b> it be <b>poached, and</b> with regard to a meal offering <b>about which it is not written</b> that it must be <b>poached,</b> the one who brings the offering can decide: <b>If he wants, let him bring</b> it <b>poached,</b> and <b>if he wants, let him bring</b> it as <b><i>matza</i>.</b> Accordingly, Rabbi Ami’s proof from the verse is inconclusive.",
            "<b>Ravina</b> also <b>objects to</b> Rabbi Ami’s explanation: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that the verse: <b>“It shall not be baked as leavened bread,”</b> serves <b>to determine</b> that this <b>man</b> who brings a meal offering as leavened bread <b>is</b> liable <b>for</b> violating <b>a mere prohibition, but</b> the meal offering itself is <b>not invalid.</b>",
            "All these objections indicate that the verse: “It shall not be baked as leavened bread,” can be interpreted in ways other than that suggested by Rabbi Ami. Accordingly, the Gemara asks: <b>Rather, from where do we</b> derive that all meal offerings not brought as <i>matza</i> are not valid? The Gemara answers: We derive it <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> discussing a verse concerning meal offerings: “It shall be of <b><i>matza</i>”</b> (Leviticus 2:5): One <b>might</b> have thought that it is only <b>a mitzva</b> <i>ab initio</i> for a meal offering to be of <i>matza</i>.

            "Rabbi Ami <b>said to</b> Rabbi Perida: The <i>halakha</i> of meal offerings is not derived from Passover, as <b>it is written in</b> the context of a meal offering <b>itself: “It shall be [<i>tehiye</i>] of <i>matza</i>”</b> (Leviticus 2:5), which can be read as meaning: <b>Preserve [<i>haḥaye</i>]</b> <i>matza</i>, i.e., preserve the <i>matza</i> as it is, and do not let it become leavened.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t you</b> already <b>derive</b> from the term “it shall be” that the requirement that a meal offering must be made as <i>matza</i> <b>is indispensable?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> that this term serves to teach only one <i>halakha</i>, <b>let the verse write: It is <i>matza</i>.

            "§ The Gemara relates an incident that involves the aforementioned Rabbi Perida. <b>The Sages said to Rabbi Perida:</b> The Sage <b>Rabbi Ezra,</b> who is of especially fine lineage, <b>a grandson of Rabbi Avtolus, who</b> in turn <b>is a</b> tenth-generation descendant <b>of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, who is a</b> tenth-generation descendant <b>of Ezra</b> the Scribe, <b>is standing</b> and waiting <b>at the gate</b> of the house and seeks entry.

And <b>if he is</b> both <b>a man of Torah</b> study <b>and a man of lineage,</b> he is also <b>worthy</b> of entry. <b>But if</b> he is <b>a man of lineage and not a man of Torah,</b> better for <b>fire to devour him</b> than for him to enter my house. In this case, his lineage is to his detriment, as it highlights his failure to become a Sage like his ancestors. The Sages <b>said to</b> Rabbi Perida: Rabbi Ezra <b>is a man of Torah</b> study. Rabbi Perida <b>said to them:</b> If so, <b>let him enter and come.</b>",
            "When Rabbi Ezra entered his house, Rabbi Perida <b>saw that</b> Rabbi Ezra’s <b>mind was troubled</b> with embarrassment at having to wait outside. Therefore, Rabbi Perida taught a homily to comfort Rabbi Ezra. <b>He began and said</b> an interpretation of the verse: <b>“I have said to the Lord: You are my Lord; I have no good but in You [<i>tovati bal alekha</i>]”</b> (Psalms 16:2). Rabbi Perida interpreted: <b>The congregation of Israel said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, give me credit, as I made Your</b> Name <b>known in the world,</b> as indicated by the phrase: “You are my Lord.”",
            "God <b>said to</b> the congregation of Israel: <b>I give no credit to you [<i>tovati bal alekha</i>].</b> God explained: <b>I give credit only to</b> the three Patriarchs, <b>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who</b> were the <b>first who made My</b> Name <b>known in the world, as it is stated: “As for the holy that are in the earth, they are the excellent [<i>ve’addirei</i>] in whom is all My delight”</b> (Psalms 16:3).

In this manner Rabbi Perida alluded to the importance of the ancestors of the Jewish people, including Ezra the Scribe, from whom Rabbi Ezra was descended.",
            "<b>When</b> Rabbi Ezra <b>heard</b> Rabbi Perida <b>say</b> the word: <b>Excellent [<i>addir</i>],</b> he too <b>began</b> a homily, one that plays with different forms of this term, <b>and said: Let the <i>Addir</i> come and exact punishment for the <i>addirim</i> from the <i>addirim</i> in the <i>addirim</i>.</b>",
            "Rabbi Ezra explained this statement: With regard to <i>Addir</i> in the phrase: <b>Let the <i>Addir</i> come, this is the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is written: “The Lord on high is mighty [<i>addir</i>]”</b> (Psalms 93:4).

When you do evil, then you rejoice. The Lord called your name a leafy olive tree, fair with goodly fruit; with the sound of a great tumult He has kindled fire upon it, and its branches are broken” (Jeremiah 11:15–16). <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: At the time when the</b> First <b>Temple was destroyed, the Holy One, Blessed be He, found Abraham standing in the Temple.

            "The verse in Jeremiah compares the Jewish people to an olive tree: “The Lord called your name a leafy olive tree.” <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: Why were the Jewish people likened to an olive tree?</b> It is <b>to tell you</b> that <b>just as the leaves of an olive tree never fall off, neither in the summer nor in the rainy season, so too, the Jewish people will never be nullified, neither in this world nor in the World-to-Come.

Rabbi Yehuda maintains that one brings the leaven from another, aged, dough. The Rabbis subsequently questioned Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion, claiming that according to his ruling the measure of the meal offering would be lacking or would be greater than required.

            "<b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> If the <b>leavening dough</b> that was brought from elsewhere is <b>stiff,</b> as its flour was mixed with a small amount of water, and it is relatively small in volume, when this stiff leaven is measured with the fine flour, the amount of fine flour for the meal offering <b>is found</b> to be <b>greater</b> than <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah when <b>the measuring</b> vessel is filled. This is because it will be necessary to add more flour to make up for the small volume of leavening dough. Conversely, if the leavening dough is <b>soft,</b> i.e., its flour was mixed with a larger amount of water, its volume will be larger than it should be, which will mean that the measuring vessel will be filled with less fine flour than normal, and the amount of flour <b>is found</b> to be <b>lacking.</b>",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty with the interpretation of Rav Ḥisda: Why does it matter if the leavening dough is stiff or soft? <b>Ultimately, when</b> the one preparing the meal offering <b>measures</b> the leaven brought from elsewhere together with the fine flour used for the meal offering, <b>he measures</b> and reaches the requisite amount <b>of a tenth</b> of an ephah, as the measure is full either way.",
            "<b>Rabba and Rav Yosef both say:</b> In order to achieve the appropriate measure it is necessary to know how much flour the substance contained before water was added and it became dough.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> even according to the opinion of Rabbis, who hold that Rabbi Yehuda’s method may not be used because the amount might be lacking or be greater than it should be, <b>let him take a little</b> fine flour <b>from</b> the tenth of an ephah after it has been measured and found to be the requisite amount, <b>and leaven it</b> thoroughly <b>outside</b> the rest of the dough, <b>and</b> afterward <b>bring it and knead it together with</b> the rest of the dough. In this way it is possible to bring leaven from the outside and to be certain that the meal offering contains exactly the correct measure.

            "§ On the previous <i>amud</i> the Gemara cited the opinion of Rabba and Rav Yosef that measuring the flour in the leavening dough must be performed before water is added.

Therefore, it is very difficult to remove precisely a handful, as when the priest takes a handful with his thumb and little finger, a large amount of flour is apt to fall out. <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi says:</b> The removal of the handful in the case of the meal offering of a sinner is no more difficult than its removal in other meal offerings. The reason is that although the Torah prohibited the addition of oil to <b>the meal offering of a sinner,</b> nevertheless the priest <b>may knead it in water, and</b> it is <b>fit</b> to be offered.",
            "The Gemara analyzes this dispute. <b>Let us say</b> that these <i>amora’im</i> <b>disagree about this: As</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi, <b>holds that one measures</b> meal offerings <b>as they are,</b> in their current state, after they have been mixed into a dough. Therefore it is permitted to perform the removal of the handful after water has been added, at which point it is not a particularly difficult rite to perform. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Ila, <b>holds that one measures</b> meal offerings <b>as they were</b> before they were mixed with water, when they were still flour. Therefore, if one were to add water before measuring he might add too much, which would cause the dough to be too soft and the measure of the offering too large, or conversely, if he were to add too little water the dough would be stiff and too small in volume. Either way, the handful will not contain the correct amount of flour, and therefore no water may be added.",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> as <b>everyone</b> agrees that <b>one measures</b> meal offerings <b>as they</b> currently <b>are.

It means <b>dry of oil,</b> but one may add water. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Ila, <b>holds</b> that the meal offering of a sinner must be <b>dry of all substances,</b> i.e., it may not contain even water.",
            "§ The question concerning whether a meal offering is to be measured in its current, mixed state or as it was before it was mixed relates to a fundamental issue that also arises in other areas of <i>halakha</i>. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Okatzin</i> 2:8): <b>Meat of a calf that swelled</b> due to cooking, as the volume of calf flesh increases when it is cooked in water, <b>or meat of an old</b> animal <b>that shrank</b> due to cooking, which is what happens to meat of this type, are to be <b>measured as they are</b> in order to determine if they are the volume of an egg-bulk, in which case they can contract ritual impurity and transfer impurity of food to other items.",
            "The Sages disagree as to the meaning of: Measured as they are. <b>Rav, Rabbi Ḥiyya, and Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> all <b>say</b> that it means the items are to be <b>measured as they are</b> currently, after having been cooked. <b>Shmuel, Rabbi Shimon bar Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and Reish Lakish</b> all <b>say</b> it means they are to be <b>measured according to</b> their volume <b>as they are,</b> before having been cooked. In other words, even if the meat of a calf is the volume of an egg-bulk after it was cooked, if it was less than this before cooking it cannot contract ritual impurity. Conversely, even if the meat of an old animal was less than an egg-bulk after cooking, if it was an egg-bulk before it was cooked it can contract ritual impurity.",
            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Shmuel, Rabbi Shimon bar Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, and Reish Lakish from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>meat of a calf that</b> came into contact with a source of ritual impurity but that <b>was not of</b> a volume equivalent <b>to</b> the minimum <b>measure</b> for contracting impurity, i.e., an egg-bulk, if it was then cooked, <b>and</b> as a result it <b>swelled</b> until <b>it stood at</b> the requisite <b>measure</b> for ritual impurity, this meat is <b>pure with regard to the past, but</b> can become <b>impure</b> and render other items impure <b>from here on.</b> In other words, the previous contact with a source of impurity did not render the meat impure, as it was of insufficient volume at the time. This indicates that the status of an item with regard to ritual impurity depends on its volume at the current moment.",
            "The Gemara answers: It is possible that by Torah law this meat is in fact not susceptible to ritual impurity even from here on, as the <i>halakha</i> defines it by its volume prior to cooking. Nevertheless, the <i>baraita</i> teaches that it is impure <b>by rabbinic law.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so, say the latter clause</b> of that <i>baraita</i>: <b>And similarly,</b> the same principle applies <b>to an offering that was sacrificed with the intent to consume it after its designated time [<i>piggul</i>], and similarly with regard to</b> food <b>left over from an offering after the time allotted for its consumption [<i>notar</i>].</b> The Gemara analyzes this statement: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is discussing <i>halakhot</i> that apply <b>by Torah law, this is</b> why the cases of <b><i>piggul</i> and <i>notar</i> are</b> included in the <i>baraita</i>, as they also apply by Torah law. <b>But if you say</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> in the <i>baraita</i> apply <b>by rabbinic law, are there <i>piggul</i> and <i>notar</i> by rabbinic law?</b>",

If so, how can the fresh figs be considered proper <i>teruma</i> and tithes in this case?",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, what</b> will you claim; that one measures foods <b>as they were</b> initially? If so, <b>say the latter clause</b> of that same <i>baraita</i>: One may separate tithes from <b>dried figs for</b> fresh <b>figs</b> only <b>by measure</b> of volume, i.e., dried figs that are one-tenth of the volume of the fresh figs.

            "Therefore, this <i>baraita</i> cannot serve as proof for either opinion. Since the two statements of the <i>baraita</i> appear contradictory, it must be that this <i>baraita</i> is actually not discussing tithes, which must be separated according to a precise measure. <b>Rather, here we are dealing with standard <i>teruma</i>.</b> By Torah law there is no fixed measure for standard <i>teruma</i>; a single kernel of grain exempts the entire crop. The Sages established a range of measures: One-fortieth for a generous gift, one-fiftieth for an average gift, and one-sixtieth for a miserly gift. Accordingly, one who wishes to give generously should give slightly more than the exact measure. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> is speaking of one who wishes to separate <i>teruma</i> <b>generously, and</b> in <b>the latter clause,</b> where he also gives more than necessary, <b>it</b> is also referring to one who wishes to separate his <i>teruma</i> <b>generously.</b>",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>If so, say the last clause: Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, said: Father,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yosei, <b>would set aside ten dried figs that</b> were <b>in a vessel for ninety</b> fresh figs <b>that</b> were <b>in a basket. And if</b> this <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>standard <i>teruma</i>,</b> then with regard to this mention of <b>ten</b> dried figs, <b>what is its purpose?</b> This proportion was greater by orders of magnitude than even the amount of a generous gift established by the Sages.",
            "<b>Rather, here we are dealing with <i>teruma</i> of the tithe,</b> which the Levite separates from his tithe and gives to a priest.

            "The Gemara explains the first suggestion: <b>It,</b> the goat sin offering of a king, is slaughtered <b>in the north, but</b> the <b>goat</b> offered by <b>Nahshon,</b> prince of the tribe of Judah, was <b>not</b> slaughtered <b>in the north</b> of the Tabernacle. He, along with all the other princes of the tribes, brought offerings to inaugurate the altar and the Tabernacle, as recorded in the Torah (see Numbers, chapter 7). The sin offerings brought at this time were unique because they were not brought to atone for any sin. The term “it” teaches that even though they had some characteristics of a sin offering, the offerings of the princes did not require slaughter in the north.",

The verse could have stated: Upon its head. The reason it adds “of the goat” is <b>to include</b> the <b>goat</b> brought as a sin offering by <b>Nahshon in</b> the requirement of <b>placing hands</b> on the head of an offering.

            "<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> there is a different version of this discussion: <b>Rava says: Even</b> if the fig-bulk of the meat that was fully roasted on only one side was distributed <b>over two or three</b> separate <b>spots,</b> he is liable for cooking on Shabbat. <b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: We learn</b> this <i>halakha</i> in the mishna <b>as well: One who drills</b> a hole of <b>any</b> size is <b>liable. What are the circumstances? If we say</b> that the hole is <b>in one spot</b> alone, why is he liable? <b>For what</b> purpose is a hole <b>of any size fit</b> to be used? <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to one who drills holes <b>in two or three</b> different <b>spots,</b> and the reason he is liable is <b>that</b> these holes <b>are fit to</b> be <b>joined?</b> Similarly, in the case discussed by Rava, one is liable for the cooking of the meat in a few different spots which can join together. The Gemara answers: <b>No; actually</b> the mishna is referring to one who drills <b>in</b> only <b>one spot,</b> as one can say <b>that it is fit as an entrance for</b> the placement of the tooth of <b>a key.</b>",
            "§ The Gemara returns to discussing the prohibition against leavening a meal offering. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Concerning the deep-pan meal offering, the verse states: “No meal offering that you shall bring to the Lord shall be made with leaven; for any leaven, and any honey, you shall not burn any of it as an offering made by fire to the Lord” (Leviticus 2:11). The term “meal offering” is apparently superfluous, and therefore the <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>If</b> the verse <b>had stated</b> only: <b>Nothing that you shall bring to the Lord shall be made with leaven, I would say: I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the <b>handful</b> removed from the meal offering for burning on the altar <b>alone</b> is included <b>in</b> the prohibition: <b>“Shall not be made with leaven,”</b> as only the handful is burned on the altar.",
            "<b>From where</b> is it derived that one is liable for the leavening of <b>a meal offering</b> whose handful has not yet been removed? <b>The verse states: “Meal offering,”</b> to teach that the prohibition includes a meal offering before the removal of its handful. The Gemara asks: Since this verse is stated in the context of the deep-pan meal offering, <b>from where</b> is it derived that one is liable for leavening the <b>other meal offerings,</b> which are not mentioned in this passage? Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> the inclusive phrase: <b>“No meal offering,”</b> to apply this <i>halakha</i> to other meal offerings.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues to expound the verse. The phrase: <b>“That you shall bring to the Lord,”</b> indicates that this prohibition applies only to <b>a fit</b> meal offering, <b>but not</b> to a <b>disqualified</b> meal offering, e.g., a meal offering that was taken outside the Temple or that was rendered ritually impure. <b>From here</b> the Sages <b>stated</b> that <b>one who leavens a fit</b> meal offering is <b>liable</b> to receive lashes, <b>but</b> one who leavens <b>a disqualified meal offering</b> is <b>exempt.</b>",
            "With regard to the ruling that the prohibition against leavening does not apply to a disqualified meal offering, <b>Rav Pappa raises a dilemma:</b> If one <b>leavened</b> a meal offering when it was fit, <b>and</b> subsequently someone removed the meal offering and it <b>emerged</b> from the Temple courtyard and was thereby disqualified, <b>and he again leavened it, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is he liable for the second leavening as well? The Gemara explains the possibilities: Does one say that <b>since</b> it <b>emerged it is disqualified in</b> accordance with the status of a sacred item that <b>emerges</b> from its permitted area, <b>and</b> therefore <b>when he again leavens it he is not liable for it due to</b> the prohibition against <b>leavening</b> a meal offering <b>after</b> one who already <b>leavened</b> it?",
            "<b>Or perhaps, since</b> one already <b>leavened</b> the meal offering, from this point forward the <b>disqualification</b> of a sacred item that <b>emerges</b> from its permitted area <b>is ineffective with regard to</b> removing it from the prohibition against leavening, as the prohibition against emerging from the Temple itself applies only to a fit meal offering. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>when he again leavens it he is liable for it due to</b> the prohibition against <b>leavening</b> a meal offering <b>after one who</b> already <b>leavened</b> it. No answer was found, and the Gemara states that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.",
            "<b>Rav Mari raises</b> another <b>dilemma</b> concerning the leavening of a meal offering. If a priest <b>leavened</b> a meal offering while standing <b>at the top of the altar, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara clarifies the possibilities: <b>The Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: “No meal offering <b>that you shall bring</b> to the Lord shall be made with leaven” (Leviticus 2:11), which indicates that this prohibition applies only to a meal offering that has not yet been brought to the Lord, i.e., to the altar. <b>And</b> therefore, as <b>this</b> meal offering <b>has</b> already been <b>brought</b> to the top of the altar, even though it has not yet been burned, perhaps it is not included in the prohibition.",
            "<b>Or perhaps</b> any offering whose <b>burning has not yet</b> been performed <b>is considered like</b> one whose <b>action</b> of sacrifice <b>has not yet</b> been performed, despite the fact that it has already been brought to the top of the altar. If so, this meal offering is included in the prohibition against leavening. No answer was found, and the Gemara states that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And now that</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>derives from</b> the phrase: <b>“No meal offering,”</b> that the prohibition includes even a meal offering before the removal of its handful, <b>why do I</b> need the phrase: <b>“That you shall bring,”</b> in the same verse? The Gemara answers: <b>It is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“That you shall bring,”</b> in order <b>to include the meal offering</b> brought with the <b>libations</b> that accompany certain animal offerings such as burnt offerings, peace offerings, and the sin offerings and guilt offerings of a leper <b>in</b> the prohibition against <b>leavening.</b> Unlike the standard meal offerings, from which a handful is removed, these are entirely burned upon the altar, and the additional derivation is necessary to include them in the prohibition against <b>leavening.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> This phrase serves <b>to include the shewbread in</b> the prohibition against <b>leavening.</b>",
            "The Gemara clarifies these opinions: With regard to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, the Gemara asks: How is it possible to leaven <b>the meal offering</b> brought with <b>libations?</b> This type of meal offering is kneaded only with olive oil, which <b>is</b> a type of <b>fruit juice,</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>and</b> there is a principle that <b>fruit juices do not leaven</b> dough. <b>Reish Lakish says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili would say:</b> Even though the oil of <b>the meal offering</b> brought with <b>libations</b> is plentiful, sometimes one might also <b>knead</b> a meal offering <b>with</b> some <b>water,</b> if he considers it necessary to add it, <b>and</b> it is <b>fit.</b> If so, it is possible for this meal offering to leaven due to the water, and therefore the verse: “That you shall bring,” teaches that the prohibition against leavening also applies to this type of meal offering.",
            "The Gemara asks: With regard to Rabbi Akiva’s opinion, the vessel into which a tenth of an ephah of flour for baking the <b>shewbread is</b> placed in <b>is a measuring</b> vessel for <b>dry</b> items, <b>and we have heard that Rabbi Akiva said:</b> The <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>dry</b> items were <b>not consecrated</b> as service vessels. This means the shewbread becomes consecrated only when it is placed on the Table in the Sanctuary, after it has been baked. If so, at this stage, the prohibition against leavening is not relevant.",
            "In answer to this question, the Gemara states that <b>Rabbi Reuven sent</b> a letter from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, in which he cited a statement <b>in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: This is the</b> correct <b>version [<i>hetze’ah</i>] of</b> this <b><i>baraita</i>, and</b> one should <b>reverse</b> the names of the Sages in it: The phrase <b>“that you shall bring”</b> serves <b>to include the shewbread in</b> the prohibition against <b>leavening;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> This phrase serves <b>to include the meal offering</b> brought with <b>libations in</b> the prohibition against <b>leavening.</b> Consequently, there is no contradiction between Rabbi Akiva’s statement here and his statement with regard to measuring vessels for dry items.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who holds that Rabbi Yosei HaGelili is the one who maintains that the measuring vessels for dry items were consecrated, <b>follows [<i>ve’azda</i>] his</b> line of <b>reasoning</b> stated elsewhere. <b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Rabbi Yosei HaGelili and one of the students of Rabbi Yishmael</b> both <b>said the same thing. And who is</b> that student of Rabbi Yishmael? It is <b>Rabbi Yoshiya.</b>",
            "<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the consecration of the Tabernacle and its vessels before their inauguration: “And it came to pass on the day that Moses had made an end of setting up the Tabernacle, and had anointed it and sanctified it, and all its vessels, and the altar and all its vessels, <b>and had anointed them and sanctified them”</b> (Numbers 7:1). <b>Rabbi Yoshiya says:</b> The <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>liquid</b> items, e.g., oil, and wine for libations, were <b>anointed</b> and thereby consecrated <b>both on</b> the <b>inside and on</b> the <b>outside.</b> The <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>dry</b> items, such as the flour for meal offerings, <b>were anointed</b> and consecrated only <b>on</b> the <b>inside, but were not anointed on</b> the <b>outside.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Yonatan says:</b> The <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>liquid</b> items <b>were anointed on</b> the <b>inside and were not anointed on</b> the <b>outside,</b> whereas the <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>dry</b> items <b>were not anointed at all.</b> Rabbi Yonatan cites a proof for his opinion: <b>You can know</b> that the measuring vessels for dry items were not consecrated at all, <b>because</b> it is taught that these vessels <b>do not consecrate</b> items placed inside them. <b>As it is written: “You shall bring out of your dwellings two wave-loaves of two tenth-parts of a ephah. They shall be of fine flour; they shall be baked with leaven, for first produce to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 23:17). <b>When</b> are <b>they</b> considered consecrated <b>to the Lord?</b> Only <b>after they are baked</b> with leaven. This demonstrates that when the flour is placed into the tenth of an ephah measuring vessel the meal offering is not yet consecrated.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do</b> Rabbi Yoshiya and Rabbi Yonatan <b>disagree?</b> They disagree <b>with regard to</b> the interpretation of the word “them” in the phrase: “And sanctified <b>them”</b> (Numbers 7:1). Both <i>tanna’im</i> agree that the term “them” serves to exclude something from the anointing and consecration, but they disagree over what is excluded. <b>Rabbi Yoshiya maintains</b> that <b>“them”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> the consecration of the <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>dry</b> items on the <b>outside,</b> i.e., only the inside of the vessels is consecrated. <b>And Rabbi Yonatan maintains</b> that the <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>dry</b> items <b>are non-sacred,</b> i.e., not consecrated at all, <b>and</b> therefore <b>it is not necessary</b> for the <b>verse to exclude</b> them. <b>Where it was necessary</b> for the <b>verse to exclude</b> something, it was with regard to <b>measuring</b> vessels used for <b>liquid</b> items, to teach that they are consecrated only on the inside but not <b>on</b> the <b>outside.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: Since the dispute between Rabbi Yoshiya and Rabbi Yonatan concerns the <i>halakha</i> of measuring vessels for dry items, <b>let</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>say also,</b> as he did with regard to Rabbi Yosei HaGelili and Rabbi Yoshiya: <b>Rabbi Akiva and one of the students of Rabbi Yishmael</b> both <b>said the same thing, and who is</b> that student? <b>Rabbi Yonatan.</b> The Gemara explains: Rabbi Yoḥanan did not say this <b>due to</b> the fact that their opinions <b>are not the same with regard to measuring</b> vessels used for <b>liquid</b> items: Rabbi Akiva maintains that these vessels are consecrated both on the inside and on the outside, whereas Rabbi Yonatan rules that they are consecrated only on the inside.",
            "<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye:</b> How can it be suggested, according to the opinion that the measuring vessels for dry items were not consecrated, that the shewbread is consecrated only when it is placed on the Table? <b>But</b> before that <b>there is</b> the stage in which the dough is placed into the <b>receptacle [<i>bisa</i>]</b> in which it is kneaded.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> with regard to <b>that which Rabbi Yonatan said to</b> Rabbi Yoshiya as proof of his opinion, that <b>you can know</b> that it is so, <b>as</b> it is taught that these vessels <b>do not consecrate</b> items placed inside them, <b>let</b> Rabbi Yoshiya <b>say to him</b> in refutation of his claim: This is referring to a case <b>where he measured</b> the flour for the two loaves <b>in</b> a vessel used for measuring <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah, but it was a vessel <b>that</b> was <b>non-sacred,</b> and it is for this reason that the loaves are not consecrated.",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared?

            "The Gemara elaborates. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> he is <b>liable, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: After the verse: “As any leaven and any honey, you shall not burn any of it as an offering made by fire to the Lord,” the next verse states: “As an offering of first fruits you may bring them to the Lord, but they shall not come up to <b>the altar</b> for a pleasing aroma” (Leviticus 2:12). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies to an item that is brought on the <b>altar. From where</b> is it derived that the same applies if it is brought to the <b>ramp</b> of the altar? <b>The verse states: “But they shall not come up to the altar</b> for a pleasing aroma,” to be accepted, and the ramp is the means to ascend to the altar.",
            "<b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that one who brings up parts to the ramp is <b>exempt?

            "The Gemara explains: The term <b>“them”</b> indicates that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to those offerings that come from leaven or honey and which are called: “An offering of first produce.” This category consists of first fruits, which are brought from dates and other sweet fruit and which are called: “The choicest first fruits of your land” (Exodus 23:19), and the two loaves, which are leaven and are the first meal offerings brought from the new crop each year. In other words, it is with regard to <b>this</b> category <b>that</b> the verse <b>amplifies for you</b> the <i>halakha</i> that the <b>ramp</b> of the altar is considered <b>like</b> the <b>altar</b> itself. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>other items,</b> e.g., the meat of sin offerings and guilt offerings, the ramp of the altar is <b>not</b> treated like the altar itself."

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And what does Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who maintains that the prohibition against bringing leftover portions up to the ramp applies to all of the items listed in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>do with this</b> term: <b>“Them,”</b> in the verse: “As an offering of first produce you may bring them” (Leviticus 2:12), from which Rabbi Elazar learns that only first fruits and the two loaves are included in the prohibition?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>He requires it for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>an individual may donate and bring</b> to the Temple <b>a gift</b> offering <b>similar to those</b> two loaves brought by the community, <b>and</b> in support <b>I</b> will <b>read with regard to</b> this offering the verse that deals with other gift offerings: <b>“That which has gone out of your lips you shall observe and do;</b> according to what you have vowed freely to the Lord your God, even that which you have promised with your mouth” (Deuteronomy 23:24), which would mean that the offering is consecrated and he must bring it as he declared.",
            "Therefore, <b>the verse states: “As an offering of first produce you may bring.”</b> The phrase: “You may bring,” is written in the plural, meaning that it is addressed to the community.

            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that only <b>an individual may not bring</b> two loaves as a gift offering, <b>as</b> an individual <b>does not bring his obligatory</b> offering in a manner <b>similar to those</b> two loaves, i.e., perhaps specifically an individual, who never has an obligatory offering of two loaves, may not bring two loaves as a gift offering. <b>But</b> the <b>community shall bring</b> two loaves as a gift offering, <b>as</b> the community <b>does bring its obligatory</b> offering in a manner <b>similar to those</b> two loaves.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And may the two loaves not be sacrificed</b> as communal <b>gift</b> offerings? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “As any leaven, and any honey, you shall not burn any of it” (Leviticus 2:11): <b>If it is stated: “Any leaven,” why is it stated: “Any honey”?

The <i>baraita</i> answers: Both of these terms had to be stated, <b>because there is</b> a <i>halakha</i> that applies <b>to leaven that is not</b> applicable <b>to honey, and there is</b> another <i>halakha</i> that applies <b>to honey that is not</b> applicable <b>to leaven.</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> explains: In the case of <b>leaven,</b> although it may not be sacrificed on the altar, <b>its general</b> prohibition <b>was permitted</b> in certain circumstances <b>in the Temple,</b> as the two loaves and the bread of the thanks offering, i.e., the four loaves of the thanks offering that were eaten by the priests, are leavened bread.

            "There is a <i>halakha</i> that applies to honey but not to leaven, as the prohibition concerning <b>honey is permitted</b> in the case <b>of the remainder of meal offerings,</b> meaning that the priests may eat their portion of meal offerings with honey, whereas the prohibition concerning <b>leaven is not permitted</b> in the case <b>of the remainder of meal offerings,</b> since one may not leaven this remainder. The <i>baraita</i> summarizes: <b>Due to</b> the fact <b>that there is</b> a <i>halakha</i> that applies <b>to leaven that is not</b> applicable <b>to honey, and there is</b> a <i>halakha</i> that applies <b>to honey that is not</b> applicable <b>to leaven, it was necessary</b> for the verse <b>to state: “Any leaven,” and it was</b> also <b>necessary</b> for it <b>to state: “Any honey.”</b>",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> in the case of <b>first fruits also,</b> the fruits should be considered part of the offering that was brought with them. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bikkurim</i> 3:5): As for <b>the fledglings that</b> were placed <b>on top of the baskets</b> that contained the first fruits brought to the Temple, <b>they would</b> sacrifice these as <b>burnt offerings, and the baskets</b> themselves <b>that were in the possession</b> of those bringing the first fruits would <b>be given to the priests.</b> Accordingly, with regard to honey as well, its general prohibition was permitted in certain circumstances, as these first fruits containing honey are included with the sacrifice of burnt offerings. The Gemara answers: <b>These</b> fledglings <b>came</b> only <b>to decorate</b> the <b>first fruits,</b> despite the fact that they were later sacrificed as burnt offerings. Bringing the fledglings is not obligatory, and therefore cannot be considered part of the same offering as first fruits.",

            "§ The Gemara returns to the discussion about the prohibition against sacrificing leaven. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When the Torah states with regard to <b>leaven: Do not burn</b> it (see Leviticus 2:11), <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that one who burns <b>all of it</b> is liable, as will be explained. <b>From where</b> is it derived that one who burns only <b>part of it</b> is also included in the prohibition? <b>The verse states: “Any [<i>kol</i>]</b> leaven,” which serves to include such a case. The <i>baraita</i> adds: This <i>halakha</i> has been derived only with regard to leaven in a pure state; <b>from where</b> is it derived that the same applies to one who sacrifices it in <b>its mixed state,</b> i.e., mixed with another substance? <b>The verse states</b> the additional expression: <b>“As [<i>ki</i>] any</b> leaven.”",
            "The Gemara analyzes this <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is it saying?</b> What is the meaning of the term: All of it, and the term: Part of it? <b>Abaye said: This</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> When the verse states about <b>leaven: Do not burn</b> it, <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this prohibition applies to <b>an olive-bulk</b> of leaven. <b>From where</b> is it derived that this prohibition applies if it is only <b>half an olive-bulk? The verse states: “Any</b> leaven.” Furthermore, <b>from where</b> is it derived that one is liable not only for leaven by itself, but also for leaven in <b>its mixed state? The verse states: “As any</b> leaven.”",
            "<b>Rava said</b> that there is a different interpretation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>This</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> When the verse states about <b>leaven: Do not burn</b> it, <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this prohibition applies to the entire <b>handful</b> that is removed from the meal offering. <b>From where</b> is it derived that this prohibition applies to <b>half</b> of the <b>handful? The verse states: “Any</b> leaven.” Furthermore, <b>from where</b> is it derived that one is liable not only for leaven by itself, but also for <b>its mixed state? The verse states: “As any</b> leaven.”",
            "The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>what</b> principle <b>do</b> Abaye and Rava <b>disagree?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Abaye holds: There is</b> such an entity as <b>a handful</b> that is <b>less than</b> the volume of <b>two olives.</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>And</b> Abaye consequently maintains that <b>there is</b> such a matter as a halakhically significant <b>burning</b> of a handful even if it is <b>less than</b> the volume of <b>an olive-bulk.</b> It follows that the phrase “any leaven” teaches that if one sacrificed less than an olive-bulk of a handful that was leaven, he is liable.",
            "<b>And Rava says: There is no</b> such entity as <b>a handful</b> that is <b>less than</b> the size of <b>two olives,</b> and consequently the mitzva not to burn leaven is referring initially to a full handful of two olive-bulks. <b>And</b> Rava holds that <b>there is no</b> such matter as a halakhically significant <b>burning</b> of a handful if it is <b>less than</b> the volume of <b>an olive-bulk.</b> Therefore, one cannot derive from the phrase “as any leaven” that one can be liable for sacrificing leaven of less than one olive-bulk. Instead, the phrase must be referring to a case where half the handful is leaven.",
            "§ The Gemara discusses another dispute between Abaye and Rava on this topic: <b>It was stated:</b> With regard to <b>one who offers up</b> a mixture made <b>of leaven and of honey on the altar, Rava says:</b> He is flogged with four sets of lashes for this act, as the verse: “As any leaven and any honey, you shall not burn any of it as an offering made by fire to the Lord” (Leviticus 2:11), includes four separate prohibitions. He <b>is flogged</b> one set <b>due to</b> the prohibition against sacrificing <b>leaven, and he is flogged</b> a second set <b>due to</b> the prohibition against sacrificing <b>honey,</b> and <b>he is flogged</b> a third set <b>due to</b> the prohibition against sacrificing <b>mixtures of leaven, and</b> he is flogged a fourth set <b>due to</b> the prohibition against sacrificing <b>mixtures of honey.</b>",
            "<b>Abaye says: One is not flogged for a general prohibition,</b> i.e., a single mitzva in the Torah that includes many different prohibited acts. Since all these actions are covered by the prohibition: “You shall not burn,” it is considered a general prohibition, for which one is not flogged.",
            "The Gemara cites a dispute between the Sages with regard to the opinion of Abaye. <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that Abaye concedes that <b>in any event</b> the offender is <b>flogged</b> with <b>one</b> set of lashes for sacrificing leaven, and he is also flogged a second set of lashes for sacrificing honey, as these are not considered general prohibitions. Since the phrase: “You shall not burn,” is referring to both leaven and honey, it is as though it were written: You shall not burn leaven; you shall not burn honey.",
            "<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that Abaye maintains that the offender <b>is not even flogged</b> with <b>one</b> set of lashes, <b>as the prohibition</b> he transgressed <b>is not specific</b> to one matter, <b>like the prohibition against muzzling.</b> The principle that one is liable to be flogged for violating a prohibition is derived from the juxtaposition of the mitzva: “You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain” (Deuteronomy 25:4), with the verses that mention lashes. It is inferred from this juxtaposition that one is not liable to be flogged for violating prohibitions whose circumstances are not similar to that of muzzling, e.g., a general prohibition that is not referring to one specific action."

            "The mishna elaborates: <b>And these</b> are the meal offerings that <b>require</b> both <b>oil and frankincense: The fine-flour meal offering,</b> as it is stated: “And he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon” (Leviticus 2:1); <b>the</b> meal offering prepared in <b>a pan</b> (see Leviticus 2:5–6); <b>the</b> meal offering prepared in <b>a deep pan</b> (see Leviticus 2:7–10); <b>and the</b> meal offering baked in an oven, which can be brought in the form of <b>loaves or</b> in the form of <b>wafers</b> (see Leviticus 2:4).",

With regard to the meal offering brought by a <i>sota</i>, it is similarly written: “He shall pour no oil upon it, nor give frankincense upon it, for it is a meal offering of jealousy, a meal offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance” (Numbers 5:15).",

            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution of this dilemma from the mishna: <b>And</b> if one placed <b>frankincense</b> upon the meal offering <b>he should gather</b> and remove <b>it,</b> and it is then valid. This indicates that the status of the meal offering depends on whether or not the frankincense can be gathered up. Since ground frankincense cannot be gathered and removed from the flour, the meal offering should be disqualified.",
            "The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Perhaps</b> there are two reasons for this <i>halakha</i> but only one of them is explicitly stated in the mishna, as the <i>tanna</i> <b>states one</b> reason <b>and</b> adds <b>another. One</b> reason is <b>that</b> the Torah did not disqualify a meal offering upon which an improper item was placed, if that item <b>is not absorbed</b> in the flour. <b>And another</b> reason the meal offering is not disqualified by frankincense is that one can <b>gather</b> up the frankincense and restore the meal offering to its former state.",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof, as the aforementioned <i>baraita</i> states: <b>I render</b> it <b>valid</b> with the addition <b>of frankincense, as</b> it is <b>possible to gather</b> the frankincense and remove it from the meal offering. This also indicates that the reason the meal offering is valid is that the frankincense can be gathered up, and since ground frankincense cannot be gathered up the meal offering should be disqualified. The Gemara answers: This is no proof, as <b>here too</b> one can say that the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>states one</b> reason <b>and</b> adds <b>another.</b> The justification he states, that the frankincense can be gathered up, may be in addition to the reason that only a substance that is absorbed by the meal offering disqualifies it.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> Rabba bar Rav Huna’s dilemma? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a meal offering of a sinner or a meal offering of jealousy</b> brought by a <i>sota</i> <b>upon which one placed frankincense,</b> he should <b>gather up the frankincense and</b> the meal offering is <b>valid. And if, before he gathered its frankincense,</b> the priest performing the service <b>had intent</b> to sacrifice <b>its</b> handful or eat its remainder <b>either beyond its</b> designated <b>time or outside its</b> designated <b>area,</b> the offering is <b>disqualified, but there is no</b> liability for <b><i>karet</i>,</b> unlike the usual case of an offering that was sacrificed with the intent to consume it after its designated time [<i>piggul</i>]. This is because at the time the priest had the improper intent the meal offering was not valid, as it had frankincense upon it at that time.",
            "<b>And if after he gathered its frankincense</b> the priest <b>has intent</b> to sacrifice <b>its</b> handful or to eat its remainder <b>outside its</b> designated <b>area,</b> the offering is <b>disqualified, but there is no</b> liability for <b><i>karet</i>.</b> But if he had intent to sacrifice its handful or to eat its remainder <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time,</b> it is <b><i>piggul</i>, and</b> one who eats it <b>is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for it.</b> This <i>baraita</i> indicates that until the frankincense is removed from the meal offering, the meal offering is disqualified. This proves that the reason a meal offering upon which frankincense has been placed is valid is due to the ability to remove the frankincense, and not because it is not absorbed. This resolves Rabba bar Rav Huna’s dilemma: If ground frankincense is placed on the meal offering of a sinner, the meal offering is disqualified.",
            "§ The <i>baraita</i> teaches that if the priest had improper intent while there was frankincense on the meal offering, the meal offering is disqualified. The Gemara challenges: <b>But let</b> this meal offering of a sinner that has frankincense on it <b>be</b> like a meal offering on which oil had been poured from <b>a cruse.</b> Such a meal offering is disqualified. <b>Why</b> is it stated that the improper <b>intent disqualifies</b> the meal offering in the case where there is frankincense on it? <b>It is</b> already <b>rejected</b> from its consecrated state by the presence of the frankincense, and therefore the improper intent should have no effect.",
            "<b>Abaye says:</b> Even though the meal offering is disqualified while there is frankincense on it, nevertheless <b>the Merciful One calls it “a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 5:11) even in that state, and therefore the improper intent has an effect with regard to it. <b>Rava said</b> there is a different explanation: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? It is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Ḥanan the Egyptian, who does not</b> subscribe to the <i>halakha</i> of <b>rejection,</b> but holds that a sacrifice that was rejected temporarily is not rejected entirely.",
            "This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Ḥanan the Egyptian says:</b> In the event that the scapegoat of Yom Kippur was lost, <b>even</b> if the <b>blood</b> of its counterpart that is sacrificed to God has already been slaughtered and its blood has been collected <b>in the cup,</b> the blood is not rejected, but rather <b>one brings</b> another scapegoat as <b>its counterpart and pairs it with</b> the goat that has already been slaughtered, and the blood is sprinkled.",
            "<b>Rav Ashi said</b> that there is a different answer: <b>Any</b> matter <b>that is within one’s power</b> to remedy <b>is not</b> deemed <b>rejected.</b> In this case, since one can gather up the frankincense from the meal offering it is not rejected as an offering, and therefore the priest’s improper intention is significant.",
            "<b>Rav Adda says: It stands to reason</b> that the correct explanation is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Ashi, as whom did you hear who accepts</b> the principle of <b>rejected</b> offerings? <b>It is Rabbi Yehuda, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Yoma</i> 62a): <b>And Rabbi Yehuda also says:</b> If <b>the blood</b> of the goat sacrificed to God was <b>spilled</b> before it was sprinkled, <b>the scapegoat,</b> its counterpart, is left <b>to die.</b> Similarly, <b>if the scapegoat dies, the blood</b> of the goat sacrificed to God <b>should be spilled.</b> In either case, two other goats must be brought and lots drawn again. This indicates that according to Rabbi Yehuda, when one of the goats dies, the remaining one is rejected.",
            "<b>And yet</b> concerning a case <b>where it is in one’s power</b> to remedy the situation, it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> After the Paschal offerings were slaughtered in the courtyard, before the floor was rinsed a priest <b>would fill a cup with the blood</b> of the many offerings brought that day <b>that was</b> now <b>mixed</b> together on the floor, and <b>sprinkle it with a single sprinkling against the base</b> of the altar, i.e., against its north and west sides, where there was a base, as is required for the Paschal offering. This was done in case the blood of one of the offerings had been spilled. The offering would be rendered valid, as some of its blood was now sprinkled on the altar. This indicates that even if the blood of an offering was spilled onto the floor, since a priest has the power to remedy this problem the offering is not rejected.",
            "§ The Gemara continues to discuss the placement of oil upon the meal offering of a sinner or the meal offering of jealousy brought by a <i>sota</i>. <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one <b>placed any amount</b> of <b>oil on top of an olive-bulk</b> of <b>a meal offering</b> of a sinner, he has thereby <b>disqualified</b> the meal offering. The Gemara inquires: <b>What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? The verse states: <b>“He shall place</b> no oil upon it” (Leviticus 5:11). This indicates an act of <b>placing</b> that has no minimum amount, and therefore one is liable for <b>any</b> amount of oil. When the verse states <b>“upon it,”</b> this teaches that a meal offering is disqualified by the oil <b>only if it has</b> the requisite <b>measure</b> of an olive-bulk.",
            "<b>And Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one <b>placed an olive-bulk of frankincense on top of any amount</b> of <b>a meal offering,</b> he has thereby <b>disqualified</b> the meal offering. <b>What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? <b>It is written: “Neither shall he give</b> any frankincense upon it” (Leviticus 5:11), which indicates that frankincense disqualifies the meal offering <b>only if there is</b> at least an amount that constitutes <b>giving,</b> which is an olive-bulk. When the verse states <b>“upon it,”</b>"
        ],
        [
            "this <b>is one amplificatory expression after another,</b> one in the context of the oil and the other in the context of the frankincense. And there is a principle that <b>one amplificatory expression after another</b> serves <b>only to restrict.</b> Consequently, the placement of frankincense on any amount of a meal offering of a sinner disqualifies the meal offering.",
            "<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> there is a different version of the discussion: <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raises a dilemma:</b> If one <b>placed oil</b> of <b>any amount on top of an olive-bulk</b> of <b>a meal offering</b> of a sinner, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara clarifies: Since the Torah states with regard to oil: “He shall place no oil upon it,” whereas with regard to frankincense it states: “Neither shall he give any frankincense upon it,” <b>do we require</b> that the <b>placing</b> of the oil must be <b>like</b> the <b>giving</b> of the frankincense, which must be an olive-bulk, <b>or not?</b> No answer was found, and therefore the Gemara states that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: If one <b>placed oil on the remainder of</b> a meal offering of a sinner or a meal offering of jealousy brought by a <i>sota</i>, he does not violate a prohibition. Concerning this, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When the verse states: <b>“He shall place no oil upon it, neither shall he give</b> any frankincense upon it,” one <b>might</b> have thought that this separation into two distinct prohibitions applies only <b>where two priests</b> perform these actions, one of whom places oil on the meal offering while the other puts frankincense. Perhaps in this case each of them is separately liable to receive lashes, but if one priest put both oil and frankincense on a meal offering, one might have thought he receives only one set of lashes.",
            "Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Upon it,”</b> with regard to both the oil and the frankincense, which indicates that <b>the verse is speaking of</b> the <b>meal offering itself, and</b> it is <b>not</b> referring <b>to</b> the <b>priest</b> who performs the service. Since both prohibited actions can be performed on the same meal offering, an individual who does both is liable to receive two sets of lashes.",
            "Furthermore, one <b>might</b> have thought this verse means <b>one may not</b> even <b>place a vessel</b> containing oil or frankincense <b>on top of a vessel</b> that contains the meal offering, <b>and</b> that <b>if one placed</b> such a vessel on the meal offering <b>he</b> has thereby <b>disqualified</b> it. Therefore, <b>the verse states “upon it,”</b> which indicates that <b>the verse is speaking about</b> the <b>meal offering itself.</b> One may not place oil or frankincense on the meal offering itself, but it is not prohibited to place a vessel containing oil or frankincense upon a vessel that contains the meal offering.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>There are</b> four categories of meal offerings: Those that <b>require bringing near,</b> a rite that requires the priests to carry the offering in their hands and bring it near the southwest corner of the altar, <b>but do not require waving;</b> those that require both <b>bringing near and waving;</b> those that require <b>waving but not bringing near;</b> and those that require <b>neither waving nor bringing near.</b>",
            "The mishna elaborates: <b>And these</b> are the meal offerings that <b>require bringing near but do not require waving: The fine-flour meal offering; the</b> meal offering prepared in <b>a pan; the</b> meal offering prepared in <b>a deep pan; the</b> meal offering baked in an oven, which can be brought in the form of <b>loaves or</b> in the form of <b>wafers; the meal offering of priests; the meal offering of the anointed priest; the meal offering of gentiles; a meal offering</b> brought <b>by women; and the meal offering of a sinner.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Shimon says: The meal offering of priests and the meal offering of the anointed priest do not require bringing</b> of the meal offering <b>near</b> to the altar, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that there is no removal of a handful in their</b> sacrifice, <b>and</b> there is a principle that with regard to <b>any</b> meal offering <b>where there is no removal of a handful in their</b> sacrifice, <b>there is</b> also <b>no bringing near.</b>",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Pappa stated</b> a principle with regard to all the <i>mishnayot</i> in tractate <i>Menaḥot</i>: <b>Anywhere that we learned</b> in a mishna that one brings a meal offering, <b>we learned</b> that one must bring <b>ten</b> items of the same type, either loaves or wafers. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rav Pappa <b>teaching us?</b>",
            "The Gemara explains: This statement of Rav Pappa serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon, who says:</b> One who takes a vow to bring a meal offering baked in an oven must bring ten items.

            "§ The mishna teaches that the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Shimon disagree about whether the meal offering of priests and the meal offering of the anointed priest require the ritual of bringing near. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara answers: <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A verse discussing the meal offering prepared in the pan states: “And you shall bring the meal offering that is made of these to the Lord, and it shall be drawn near to the priest, and he shall bring it near to the altar” (Leviticus 2:8). <b>If</b> the verse <b>had stated</b> only: <b>And you shall bring that which is made of these to the Lord and it shall be drawn near to the priest and he shall bring it near</b> to the altar, omitting the words: The meal offering, <b>I would say: I have</b> derived <b>only that</b> the <b>handful</b> that is sacrificed on the altar <b>alone requires bringing near.</b>",
            "<b>From where</b> is it derived that this <i>halakha</i> applies to the entire <b>meal offering?

            "The <i>baraita</i> raises a difficulty: Why is a verse necessary to teach that the requirement of bringing near applies to the meal offering of a sinner? <b>But</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> capable of being derived by <b>logical inference.</b> The <i>baraita</i> elaborates: The procedure of bringing a meal offering <b>is stated here,</b> in the context of the meal offering of a sinner,"

            "The <i>baraita</i> rejects this claim: One cannot derive the <i>halakha</i> of the meal offering of a sinner from the meal offering brought by a <i>sota</i>, as there is another requirement that applies to the meal offering brought by a <i>sota</i> but not to the meal offering of a sinner: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about the meal offering</b> brought by <b>a <i>sota</i>?</b> It is notable <b>in that it requires waving,</b> whereas the meal offering of a sinner does not.

He maintains that this is not a valid refutation, as <b>on the contrary, this</b> <i>omer</i> meal offering is <b>more common</b> than the meal offering brought by a <i>sota</i> and the meal offering of a sinner. The <i>omer</i> meal offering is definitely brought once a year, whereas in the case of <b>these</b> offerings, <b>there</b> may be <b>times when you do not find it at all,</b> if no poor sinners come forward and no women are accused of adultery by their husbands.",
            "The Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Or</b> perhaps when the verse <b>states: “And you shall bring,”</b> this does <b>not</b> serve to teach about the requirement of bringing near <b>but rather</b> is written for a different reason: To indicate <b>that an individual</b> Jew <b>may donate and bring a different</b> kind of <b>meal offering,</b> one made from barley, <b>apart from these</b> five meal offerings, all made from wheat, <b>which</b> the verse mentions <b>with regard to this matter</b> (see Leviticus 2:1–13).

Rabbi Yosei ben HaMeshullam explains: This verse teaches that the requirement to wave the lambs together with the loaves applies only to the two lambs sacrificed as communal peace offerings on <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>to exclude</b> the <b>seven</b> other lambs, brought as burnt offerings, which are not to be waved with the loaves.",
            "<b>Ḥanina ben Ḥakhinai says</b> there is a different answer: The priest <b>places the two loaves between the thighs of</b> the two <b>lambs and waves</b> them. <b>And</b> in this manner <b>it is found</b> that he <b>realizes</b> the meaning of both of <b>these two verses,</b> as the <b>bread is on top of the lambs and</b> the <b>lambs</b> are also <b>on top of the bread.

            "The verses juxtapose the meal offering baked in an oven to the meal offering prepared on the pan and the meal offering prepared in the deep pan, and similarly to the meal offering brought as a gift, alluded to by the phrase: “Mixed with oil,” and to the meal offering of a sinner, which is called: “Dry.” This teaches that <b>just as</b> the term: <b>“And every”</b> (Leviticus 7:10), <b>stated below</b> with regard to those meal offerings, is referring to <b>two different types</b> of meal offering, <b>so too,</b> the term: <b>“And every”</b> (Leviticus 7:9), <b>stated above,</b> with regard to the two forms of meal offering baked in an oven, is referring to <b>two different types</b> of meal offering, and therefore one may not bring part as loaves and part as wafers.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who maintains that loaves and wafers are two different types of meal offerings baked in an oven, respond to Rabbi Shimon’s proof? After all, <b>Rabbi Shimon is saying well</b> when he points out that the verse mentions “offering” only once. The Gemara explains: Rabbi Yehuda could have <b>said to you: Since it is written: “With oil,”</b> and: <b>“With oil,”</b> in the verse: “It shall be unleavened loaves of fine flour mixed with oil, or unleavened wafers spread with oil” (Leviticus 2:4), it is considered <b>as though it is written “offering”</b> and <b>“offering,”</b> and therefore these are deemed two different types of meal offering.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> respond to this claim? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Shimon maintains that the repetition of the term “with oil” teaches a different <i>halakha</i>. <b>If it were not written “with oil,”</b> and again <b>“with oil,” I would say</b> that a meal offering baked in an oven must be <b>specifically</b> brought <b>half</b> as <b>loaves and half</b> as <b>wafers, and</b> if he wanted to bring only <b>loaves alone or wafers alone,</b> I would <b>say</b> that he may <b>not</b> bring a meal offering in this manner. The repetition of the term “with oil” <b>teaches us</b> that a meal offering baked in an oven can comprise ten loaves, or ten wafers, or a combination of both types.",
            "The Gemara further inquires: The <i>baraita</i> states that Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, holds that loaves and wafers are two different types of meal offerings. The opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, is</b> the same as that of <b>his father,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, whose opinion is also mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>. Why is it necessary to cite Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion separately? The Gemara explains: It is necessary to cite the opinion of Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Yehuda, because there is a practical difference <b>between</b> his ruling and that of his father; <b>as, if</b> someone transgressed and <b>performed</b> the sacrifice of a meal offering baked in an oven by bringing a mixture of loaves and wafers, according to Rabbi Yehuda the offering is valid after the fact, whereas Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Yehuda deems it not valid even after the fact.",

There are three verses written with regard to <i>teruma</i> that contain the term “your grain.” They are: “You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain” (Deuteronomy 12:17); “And you shall eat before the Lord your God…the tithe of your grain” (Deuteronomy 12:17); and “The first fruits of your grain…you shall give him” (Deuteronomy 18:4).

            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> then <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> should be subject to the same rabbinic decree <b>as well,</b> to prevent someone from circumventing their obligation to separate <i>ḥalla</i> by temporarily selling their dough to a gentile who will knead it and return it to them.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Here,</b> when the verse permits the new crop only after the sacrifice of the <i>omer</i> offering, it is referring to the period <b>when the Temple is standing.

            "The Gemara questions the claim that the purpose of waiting until the sacrifice of the <i>omer</i> is only in order to fulfill the mitzva in the most optimal fashion.

If the <i>omer</i> is from wheat, then the two loaves offering would not be the first offering of the first fruit, as the <i>omer</i> offering of Passover precedes it.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial growth is nullified by the subsequent growth, which would mean that the obligation of <i>teruma</i> and tithes applies to the entire plant by Torah law. Consequently, this obligation can be fulfilled by separating <i>teruma</i> and tithes from the initial growth of the plant. This would be similar to Rabba’s dilemma with regard to an ear of grain that is replanted.",

            "<b>And</b> furthermore, Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, who said</b> that the <b>reaping of</b> barley for <b>the <i>omer</i></b> offering <b>is a mitzva. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shevi’it</i> 1:4) that <b>Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> The verse: “In plowing time and in harvest you shall rest” (Exodus 34:21), is not referring to the prohibition against farming the land during the Sabbatical Year, as one might have thought. Rather, it is referring to the prohibition against performing labor on Shabbat. And the reason that the verse mentions these two particular forms of labor is to teach that <b>just as</b> the <b>plowing</b> that is prohibited on Shabbat is an otherwise <b>voluntary</b> act, as plowing is never required by the Torah, <b>so too,</b> the <b>harvesting</b> that is prohibited on Shabbat <b>is voluntary.</b> Therefore, <b>the harvesting of the <i>omer</i> is excluded</b> from the prohibition, <b>as it is a mitzva.</b> Consequently, the barley for the <i>omer</i> is harvested on the sixteenth of Nisan, even if it occurs on Shabbat.",
            "Rabbi Yoḥanan explains why Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael: <b>And</b> Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, reached his opinion by the following reasoning: <b>If it enters your mind</b> to say that barley for the <i>omer</i> offering that is <b>reaped not</b> in accordance with the procedure dictated by <b>its mitzva</b> is nevertheless <b>fit, why</b> would it <b>override Shabbat? Let one reap it on Shabbat eve. Rather, from</b> the fact that the reaping <b>overrides Shabbat, learn from</b> here that if it <b>was reaped not</b> in accordance with <b>its mitzva,</b> it is <b>unfit.</b>",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>Isn’t Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi also a <b>student of Rabbi Shimon,</b> who was a student of Rabbi Akiva? Since Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi was a student of Rabbi Shimon, and by extension of Rabbi Akiva, he should accept Rabbi Akiva’s principle that any prohibited labor that can be performed on Shabbat eve does not override Shabbat. If so, as Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds that if the <i>omer</i> was not performed at night it should be done by day, why does its harvest override Shabbat? Let it be harvested on Shabbat eve.",
            "The Gemara cites a proof for its claim that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi was a student of Rabbi Shimon. <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: When we would study Torah with Rabbi Shimon in Tekoa, we would carry to him oil and a towel [<i>aluntit</i>] from the courtyard to the roof and from the roof into an enclosure</b> similar to a courtyard, <b>and from</b> one <b>enclosure to another enclosure, until we reached the spring in which we would bathe,</b> without passing through a public domain.",
            "The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi concedes that reaping barley for the <i>omer</i> offering overrides Shabbat, in accordance with Rabbi Akiva. But this is not because it is unfit if reaped at an improper time. Rather, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds in accordance with the other</b> opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon said: Come and see how dear is a mitzva</b> performed <b>in its</b> proper <b>time. As burning the fats and limbs is valid all night,</b> and therefore it is possible to wait until the conclusion of Shabbat and burn them at night, <b>but</b> nevertheless <b>one would not wait with them until nightfall;</b> rather, one burns them immediately, even on Shabbat. Likewise, when it comes to the reaping of the <i>omer</i>, although it is fit if reaped during the previous day, reaping at night still overrides Shabbat because a mitzva is dear when performed in its proper time."
        ],
        [
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, not know</b> of this? He must have known of his father’s statement that a mitzva performed at its proper time overrides Shabbat. If so, his ruling that reaping at an improper time is unfit cannot be proven from the fact that reaping the <i>omer</i> overrides Shabbat, as claimed earlier.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> it must be that Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, was aware of that principle, and nevertheless he maintains that the requirement to perform a mitzva at its optimal time does not apply to the case of the reaping of the <i>omer</i>. This is because <b>there,</b> in the case of the burning of the fats and limbs, it <b>is different, as the slaughter</b> of the animal already <b>overrode Shabbat.</b> Therefore, it is dear to perform the burning of its fats and limbs at the proper time, even on Shabbat. One cannot apply this reasoning to the reaping of the <i>omer</i>, as there is no prior labor performed on Shabbat before the reaping. Consequently, the reason it may be performed on Shabbat must be that it would be unfit if reaped any other time.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>according to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, he should agree that the case of the burning of the sacrifice’s fats and limbs is different from the <i>omer</i>, since <b>also</b> there, <b>the slaughter</b> of the animal already <b>overrode Shabbat.</b> Therefore, the Gemara gives a new explanation: <b>Rather, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b> that in fact the <b>reaping of the <i>omer</i></b> crop <b>does not override Shabbat,</b> in contrast to the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael. For this reason Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s ruling that the <i>omer</i> is fit if reaped at an improper time does not conflict with the principle of his teacher, Rabbi Akiva, that any prohibited labor that can be performed on Shabbat eve does not override Shabbat.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>not</b> maintain that the reaping of the <i>omer</i> overrides Shabbat? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (63b) in response to Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion that when the sixteenth of Nisan occurred during the week, five <i>se’a</i> of barley were reaped, and when it occurred on Shabbat only three <i>se’a</i> were reaped: <b>And the Rabbis say: Both on Shabbat and</b> during the <b>week,</b> the <i>omer</i> offering <b>would come from three</b> <i>se’a</i>? In any case, according to both opinions, the <i>omer</i> was reaped on Shabbat. The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> mishna <b>is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty from the latter clause of that mishna. Rabbi Ḥanina, the deputy High Priest, says: On Shabbat the barley was reaped by an individual, with one sickle and one basket into which the barley was placed, whereas during the week it was reaped by three people, with three baskets and three sickles. <b>And the Rabbis say: Both on Shabbat and</b> during the <b>week</b> it is reaped <b>by three</b> people, <b>with three baskets and three sickles.</b> According to both opinions the <i>omer</i> was reaped on Shabbat. The Gemara again responds: <b>That</b> clause of the mishna <b>is</b> also <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.",
            "The Gemara raises another difficulty from a mishna (65a) that describes the series of questions posed by the court emissary who reaps the grain to those assembled to witness the process: <b>And</b> if the sixteenth of Nisan occurs <b>on Shabbat,</b> the court emissary <b>says to</b> those assembled: Shall I cut the sheaves on <b>this Shabbat?</b> The assembly says in response: Yes. The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> clause of mishna <b>is</b> also <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty from the mishna (71a): If the <i>omer</i> <b>was reaped during the day,</b> it is <b>fit, and</b> it <b>overrides Shabbat.</b> Now, <b>whom did you hear who said: If the <i>omer</i> was reaped during the day,</b> it is <b>fit?</b> It is <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>And</b> yet <b>it is taught</b> in the mishna: <b>And it overrides Shabbat. What, is it not</b> referring to <b>reaping?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is referring <b>to</b> the <b>sacrifice</b> of the <i>omer</i> offering.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But with regard to reaping,</b> does it <b>not</b> override Shabbat, according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi? <b>As, isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi said the following <i>halakha</i> based upon the verse: <b>“And Moses declared the appointed times of the Lord</b> to the children of Israel” (Leviticus 23:44): <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> this phrase? This phrase is necessary <b>because we</b> had <b>learned only that the daily offering and the Paschal offering</b> override Shabbat and ritual impurity, <b>as it is stated concerning them: “In its appointed time”</b> (see Numbers 9:2, 28:2), from which it is derived that each of them must be sacrificed <b>in its appointed time and even on Shabbat; in its appointed time and even in ritual impurity.</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: With regard to <b>the rest of the communal offerings, from where</b> is it derived that they likewise override Shabbat and ritual impurity? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to additional offerings that are brought on the Festivals: <b>“These you shall sacrifice to the Lord in your appointed times”</b> (Numbers 29:39).",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>to include</b> in this <i>halakha</i> the <b><i>omer</i> and</b> the lambs that are <b>sacrificed with it, the two loaves</b> sacrificed on <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>and</b> the communal peace offerings that are <b>sacrificed with them? The verse states: “And Moses declared the appointed times of the Lord</b> to the children of Israel,” after it lists Shabbat and the Festivals. This indicates that <b>the verse established one time for all of them.</b> All of these days are considered appointed times, and their offerings are not deferred.",
            "The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>With regard to what</b> ritual does the <i>baraita</i> state that these offerings override Shabbat? <b>If we say for</b> actual <b>sacrifice,</b> this cannot be correct, as <b>are the two loaves fit for sacrifice?</b> The two loaves are not sacrificed on the altar at all. Rather, they are waved and later eaten by priests.",
            "The Gemara concludes its interpretation of the <i>baraita</i>, which leads to the question about the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the two loaves override Shabbat with regard <b>to grinding and sifting. And</b> if so, <b>similarly, with regard to the <i>omer</i></b> offering, it overrides Shabbat <b>with regard to</b> the process of <b>reaping</b> the grains. <b>And</b> as the <i>baraita</i> is the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, evidently he maintains that the reaping of the <i>omer</i> <b>overrides Sh abbat.</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> one must say that the <i>baraita</i> is not referring to comparable cases. As far as the <b><i>omer</i></b> is concerned, it overrides Shabbat only <b>with regard to</b> its actual <b>sacrifice, but</b> when it comes to the <b>two loaves,</b> it overrides Shabbat <b>with regard to</b> its <b>baking. And</b> the reason why the two loaves must be baked on Shabbat is because <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b> that the <b>oven consecrates</b> that which is baked inside it. Therefore, <b>if</b> one were to <b>bake from the previous day,</b> on the eve of <i>Shavuot</i>, he would effectively be <b>disqualifying it</b> from being brought on <i>Shavuot</i> day, as it would be disqualified by being <b>left overnight.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi really <b>hold</b> that the <b>oven consecrates</b> that which is baked inside it? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The communal peace offering of two <b>lambs</b> that accompanies the two loaves sacrificed on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> <b>consecrate the loaves</b> that accompany them <b>only by</b> means of their <b>slaughter. How so?</b> If <b>one slaughtered</b> the lambs <b>for their</b> own <b>sake,</b> i.e., as lambs for <i>Shavuot</i> in the appropriate manner, <b>and</b> the priest <b>sprinkled their blood for their</b> own <b>sake, the loaves are consecrated.</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: But if <b>one slaughtered them not for their</b> own <b>sake, and</b> the priest <b>sprinkled their blood not for their</b> own <b>sake, the loaves are not consecrated,</b> as the factors indispensable in rendering the offering fit were not properly performed. If <b>one slaughtered them for their</b> own <b>sake and he sprinkled their blood not for their</b> own <b>sake,</b> the fact that the lambs were properly slaughtered renders the loaves partially consecrated. Therefore, <b>the loaves are consecrated</b> to the extent that they cannot be redeemed, <b>but they are not consecrated</b> to the extent that they may be eaten. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.",
            "<b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: Actually, the loaves are consecrated only when one slaughters</b> the offerings <b>for their</b> own <b>sake and sprinkles their blood for their</b> own <b>sake,</b> i.e., only if both factors indispensable in rendering the offering fit were properly performed. Apparently, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds that it is the slaughter of the lambs that consecrates the loaves, not baking the loaves in the oven.",
            "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says:</b> Actually, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi does hold that the oven consecrates the loaves. What the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying</b> when it uses the categories of consecrated and not consecrated with regard to the slaughter of the lambs is that either the two loaves <b>are fixed</b> as <i>Shavuot</i> meal offerings and cannot be used for any other offering, <b>or</b> they <b>are not fixed</b> as <i>Shavuot</i> meal offerings. In other words, if the lambs were slaughtered and the blood sprinkled in the proper manner, one cannot change the designation of the loaves, whereas if they were not slaughtered and their blood was not sprinkled properly, one can change their designation. If the lambs were slaughtered properly but their blood was sprinkled improperly, the status of the loaves is subject to a dispute. This has nothing to do with when the loaves are consecrated.",

            "<b>I</b> therefore <b>derive</b> this from a verbal analogy: It <b>is stated here,</b> in the passage of the loaves describing the thanks offering: <b>“<i>Teruma</i>,” and</b> it <b>is stated with regard to <i>teruma</i> of the tithe:</b> “Then you shall set apart from it <b>a <i>teruma</i></b> for the Lord, even a tithe of the tithe” (Numbers 18:26). <b>Just as below,</b> with regard to <i>teruma</i> of the tithe, <b>one</b> out of every <b>ten</b> is separated as <i>teruma</i>, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the loaves of the thanks offering, <b>one</b> out <b>of</b> every <b>ten</b> loaves is separated as <i>teruma</i>.",
            "<b>Or</b> perhaps, <b>go this way</b> and derive the measure from a different verbal analogy: It <b>is stated here: “<i>Teruma</i>,” and</b> it <b>is stated with regard to first fruits: “<i>Teruma</i>”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:17). <b>Just as below,</b> with regard to first fruits, <b>it has no measure, so too here,</b> say that <b>it has no measure.</b>",

            "Since both of these comparisons are equally plausible, <b>the verse states</b> concerning the two loaves: <b>“You shall bring out of your dwellings two loaves of waving”</b> (Leviticus 23:17). <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state: “You shall bring,” what,</b> then, is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “You shall bring”?</b> This indicates <b>that whatever,</b> i.e., any meal offering, <b>you bring from a different place,</b> it must <b>be like this,</b> i.e., the two loaves.

            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>We have learned</b> that there are <b>ten</b> tenths of an ephah of flour <b>for the</b> loaves of <b>leavened bread</b> accompanying the thanks offering. <b>From where</b> is it derived that there are <b>ten</b> tenths of an ephah <b>for the</b> thirty loaves of <b><i>matza</i>?

            "By mentioning all the loaves of unleavened bread in one verse and the loaves of leavened bread in the subsequent verse, it is indicated that one must <b>bring</b> the <b><i>matza</i></b> in a measure <b>corresponding to</b> the measure of the loaves of <b>leavened bread.

            "The Gemara responds: The sacrificial portions of the sin offering must be sacrificed from that which is joined together, <b>in accordance with</b> that <b>which Rav Ḥisda</b> says that <b>Avimi says, as Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Avimi says:</b> The priest <b>may not cut up the meat</b> of the offering <b>before taking</b> from it <b>the sacrificial portions</b> that are to be burned upon the altar.",

            "The Gemara challenges: <b>And let us derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <i>teruma</i> of the loaves of the thanks offering <b>from <i>teruma</i> of <i>ḥalla</i>,</b> i.e., the portion of dough given to the priest, as the verse refers to it as a <i>teruma</i> (see Numbers 15:19–20).

            "§ <b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b><i>teruma</i> of the loaves of the thanks offering,</b> is a non-priest who intentionally partakes <b>of it liable</b> to receive <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven, as is the <i>halakha</i> concerning a non-priest who intentionally consumes <i>teruma</i> of the tithe? <b>And</b> similarly, is a non-priest who unwittingly partakes of <i>teruma</i> of the loaves of the thanks offering liable to pay the value of what he consumed as well as an additional <b>one-fifth</b> of that value, as is the <i>halakha</i> concerning a non-priest who partakes of <i>teruma</i> of the tithe unwittingly (see Leviticus 22:9, 14)? <b>Or is one not</b> liable to receive <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven <b>or</b> to pay an additional <b>one-fifth for their</b> consumption?",
            "Rava elaborates: <b>Since</b> <i>teruma</i> of the loaves of the thanks offering <b>is compared to <i>teruma</i> of the tithe,</b> perhaps <b>it is considered like <i>teruma</i> of the tithe,</b> and the same penalties are incurred. <b>Or perhaps,</b> since the verse uses restrictive terms with regard to <i>teruma</i> of the tithe, as the verse states of one who intentionally partakes of it: “They shall die <b>due to it”</b> (Leviticus 22:9), and the verse states with regard to one who unwittingly partakes of it: “Then he shall put <b>its fifth-part</b> unto it” (Leviticus 22:14), <b>the Merciful One restricted</b> this <i>halakha</i> specifically to the case of <i>teruma</i> of the tithe.",
            "Rava raises another dilemma based on the comparison of <i>teruma</i> of the loaves of the thanks offering and <i>teruma</i> of the tithe: Does <i>teruma</i> of the loaves of the thanks offering that fell into non-sacred produce <b>render the mixture</b> forbidden, as is the <i>halakha</i> concerning <i>teruma</i> of the tithe? <b>Or</b> does the comparison of <i>teruma</i> of the loaves to <i>teruma</i> of the tithe apply only with regard to the proper measure, and it <b>does not render the mixture</b> forbidden?

The Gemara responds: The <i>halakha</i> that the loaves of leavened bread consist of ten loaves made from ten tenths of an ephah is not derived solely by comparison to the two loaves; rather, <b>it is</b> derived <b>from itself,</b> as the <i>halakha</i> that there are ten loaves is stated in the verse concerning the thanks offering, <b>and</b> from <b>another matter, and any</b> <i>halakha</i> derived <b>from itself and</b> from <b>another matter is not</b> considered <b>a comparison.</b> Consequently, the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <i>matza</i> loaves may be derived from it.",

            "This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 63a) with regard to the slaughtering of the Paschal offering: <b>One who slaughters the Paschal offering with leavened bread</b> still in his possession <b>transgresses a prohibition,</b> as the verse states: “You shall not sacrifice the blood of My offering with [<i>al</i>] leavened bread; neither shall the offering of the festival of Passover be left until the morning” (Exodus 34:25). <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even</b> one who slaughters <b>the daily</b> afternoon <b>offering</b> on Passover eve with leavened bread in his possession transgresses the prohibition. <b>And Reish Lakish says: Actually, one is not liable unless</b> the leavened bread <b>is</b> in the possession <b>of the one who slaughters</b> the offering, <b>or the one who sprinkles</b> its blood, <b>or one of the members of the group,</b> and the leavened bread is <b>with</b> that person <b>in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard.

            "The Gemara replies: It is <b>necessary</b> to state the dispute concerning both matters. <b>As, if</b> their disagreement <b>were stated</b> only <b>with regard to that</b> matter of the Paschal offering, one might think that only <b>with regard to that</b> matter <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that one is liable even if the leavened bread is not inside the Temple courtyard, <b>since wherever there is</b> leavened bread, its owner <b>stands in</b> violation of <b>the prohibition</b> against owning leavened bread at that time. <b>But with regard to the matter of the consecration of</b> the <b>loaves</b> of the thanks offering, one could <b>say</b> that <b>he concedes to Reish Lakish that if</b> the loaves are <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard when the thanks offering is slaughtered, they are <b>consecrated,</b> but if they are <b>outside,</b> they are <b>not consecrated.</b>",
            "<b>And if</b> their disagreement <b>were stated</b> only <b>with regard to this</b> matter of the loaves of the thanks offering, one might think that only <b>with regard to this</b> matter <b>Reish Lakish says</b> that the loaves are consecrated only if they were within the walls of the Temple courtyard. <b>But with regard to that</b> matter of the Paschal offering, one could <b>say</b> that <b>he concedes to Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> that one is liable for slaughtering the Paschal offering while in possession of leavened bread even if it was not with him inside the Temple courtyard, as wherever there is leavened bread, its owner stands in violation of the prohibition against owning leavened bread at that time. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to state the dispute concerning both matters.",
            "The Gemara notes: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> In the case of <b>one who slaughters the thanks offering inside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>and</b> at that time <b>its loaves were outside the walls of Beit Pagei, the loaves were not consecrated.</b>",
            "§ The mishna teaches: If <b>he slaughtered</b> the thanks offering <b>before the surface of the loaves formed a crust in the oven,</b> the loaves were not consecrated.

            "The Gemara seeks to clarify: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As the Sages taught:</b> The verse states with regard to the loaves accompanying the thanks offering: <b>“With cakes of leavened bread he shall present his offering with the sacrifice</b> of his peace offerings for thanks” (Leviticus 7:13). This <b>teaches that the loaves are not consecrated unless the surface</b> of the loaves <b>formed a crust in the oven,</b> as only then can they be considered “cakes of leavened bread.” The phrase <b>“he shall present his offering with the sacrifice” teaches that the loaves are consecrated only upon the slaughtering of the offering.</b> The phrase <b>“the sacrifice</b> of his peace offerings <b>for thanks” teaches that if one slaughtered</b> the offering <b>not for its sake, the loaves were not consecrated.</b>",
            "§ On a similar note, <b>the Sages taught:</b> One <b>fulfills</b> the obligation to eat <i>matza</i> on Passover <b>with half-done,</b> i.e., not fully baked, <b><i>matza</i>, and with <i>matza</i> made in a stewpot [<i>ilpas</i>]</b> rather than baked in an oven. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> constitutes <b>half-done <i>matza</i>?

Here,</b> with regard to <i>matza</i>, the term <b>“bread” is written</b> (Deuteronomy 16:3), <b>and here,</b> with regard to the loaves of the thanks offering, the term <b>“bread” is written.</b>",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>Lest you say</b> that since <b>the Merciful One states</b> with regard to the loaves of the thanks offering: “And of it he shall present <b>one</b> out of each offering for a gift unto the Lord” (Leviticus 7:14), this indicates <b>that one may not take sliced</b> bread for the thanks offering, <b>and this</b> half-done bread <b>is considered like one that is sliced,</b> as it will break apart upon being lifted, and it should consequently be disqualified for the bread of the thanks offering, therefore Rava <b>teaches us</b> that once it is baked to that point, it is considered as one loaf and it is valid for the thanks offering.",

            "The Gemara responds: <b>That is also what</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>is saying: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said in a case <b>where there was</b> another <b>offering</b> that was <b>slaughtered at the same time. But if there is not</b> another <b>offering</b> that was <b>slaughtered at the same time,</b> the libations <b>are</b> immediately <b>considered as if they were disqualified by</b> being <b>left overnight, and</b> they are <b>disqualified.</b>",
            "The Gemara explained above that the mishna is also in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, and that he holds in accordance with the opinion of his father that any blood that stands fit to be sprinkled is considered as if it has been sprinkled. The Gemara also explained that the mishna allows for the sacrifice of the libations with another offering because the court tacitly stipulates that the libations should be brought with another offering if the first offering becomes disqualified. In light of this, the Gemara asks: <b>But does Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar,</b> i.e., the father of Rabbi Elazar, <b>accept</b> the principle that <b>the court tacitly stipulates concerning</b> the libations?",
            "<b>But didn’t Rav Idi bar Avin say</b> that <b>Rav Amram said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> With regard to animals that were designated as <b>daily offerings</b> but <b>that</b> in the end <b>were not needed for</b> use by <b>the public,</b> and have inherent sanctity, how shall they be redeemed? <b>According to the statement of Rabbi Shimon, they may not be redeemed</b> as long as they are <b>unblemished,</b> since they retain the status of offerings. But <b>according to the statement of the Rabbis, they may be redeemed</b> even when they are <b>unblemished,</b> as the court initially stipulates that if they are not needed they will not assume the status of an offering. Since Rabbi Shimon disagrees with the Rabbis, it may be inferred that according to Rabbi Shimon, one does not say that the court tacitly stipulates concerning the offerings.",
            "The Gemara responds: In general, Rabbi Shimon holds that the court stipulates concerning them. And <b>it is different there,</b> in the case of the daily offerings, <b>because they have</b> an alternative <b>arrangement through</b> which their total loss may be avoided, as they may be left in the field to <b>graze</b> until they develop a blemish, at which point they may be sold. Since there is no arrangement for the libations save for sacrificing them with another offering, even Rabbi Shimon holds that the court stipulates concerning them.",

            "§ With regard to the offspring, substitute, and replacement of a thanks offering, the Gemara relates: <b>Rav Ḥanina sent</b> a letter from Eretz Yisrael to the Sages in Babylonia containing the following statement <b>in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> The mishna <b>taught</b> that the offspring, replacement, and substitute do not require loaves <b>only</b> in a case where they were sacrificed <b>after</b> the owner achieved <b>atonement,</b> i.e., where the initial thanks offering was already sacrificed with its loaves; <b>but</b> if they were sacrificed <b>before</b> he achieved <b>atonement, they require loaves.</b>",

        [
            "<b>Rather,</b> perhaps Rabbi Yoḥanan was referring not to the replacement for an obligatory thanks offering, but <b>to the replacement for a voluntary thanks offering.</b> This too is difficult, because <b>whether</b> the initial thanks offering was found <b>before</b> the owner achieved <b>atonement</b> with the replacement <b>or after</b> he achieved <b>atonement,</b> both offerings <b>require loaves,</b> as the owner <b>is</b> considered one who <b>increases thanks offerings.</b> That is, since he was not required to bring a replacement for the offering, if he brings another offering it is considered an additional voluntary offering, and a voluntary thanks offering requires loaves.",

            "The Gemara challenges: <b>But in a case like this</b> involving <b>a thanks offering,</b> the animal <b>does not require loaves.</b> Therefore, if Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds that in such a case the sin offering is placed in the field to graze, then Shmuel cannot hold in accordance with his opinion, since according to Shmuel, in circumstances where a sin offering would be left to graze, a thanks offering in the same circumstances would require loaves. <b>Rather, Shmuel holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who said:</b> There are <b>five sin offerings</b> that are left to <b>die;</b> one is a sin offering that was lost and found before its replacement was sacrificed, and another is the case where a sin offering was separated as a guarantee.",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> it cannot be that Shmuel holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, since <b>Rabbi Shimon does not hold</b> that there are <b>any</b> circumstances in which a sin offering is placed in the field to <b>graze.</b> Accordingly, if Shmuel holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, how can he say: And in any situation in which a sin offering would be placed in the field to graze until it develops a blemish, if that same situation occurs with a thanks offering, it requires loaves?",

According to Rabbi Yoḥanan, the offspring of an obligatory thanks offering requires loaves if it is sacrificed before its mother.

The juxtaposition of the words “thanks offering” and “loaves” indicates that the loaves are themselves called a thanks offering. Therefore, one who separated money for a thanks offering may use that money for the loaves as well. The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>If that is so, the opposite</b> should <b>also</b> be the <i>halakha</i>, i.e., the thanks offering is called loaves, and it should therefore be permitted to use the money remaining from the loaves for the thanks offering. The Gemara rejects this: <b>The loaves are called a thanks offering,</b> but <b>the thanks offering is not called loaves.</b>",

An additional mnemonic is provided for recalling the topics of these questions: <b><i>Ḥalash</i>,</b> a contraction of <i>ḥullin</i>, i.e., non-sacred items, and <i>shelamim</i>, peace offerings; <b>leftover; substitute; outside; Ḥizkiyya; separated a sin offering; for a guarantee.</b>",
            "<b><i>Lemedin</i>,</b> i.e., Levi, <b>said before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: <b>But</b> why is there no remedy in this case? <b>Let him bring loaves</b> for the thanks offering <b>and let him say: If this</b> animal <b>that is extant</b> from the intermingled pair <b>is the thanks offering,</b> then <b>these are its loaves,</b> and they will be consumed as the loaves of the thanks offering.

            "The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Yirmeya was sitting before Rabbi Zeira, and he was sitting and saying:</b> The mishna <b>taught only</b> that the loaves may not be brought <b>from second-tithe wheat</b> itself, <b>but he may bring</b> the loaves <b>from wheat purchased from second-tithe money.</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: My teacher,</b> do <b>you say so?

You derive it from the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a peace offering.</b> A thanks offering is a type of peace offering, as the verse states: “And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanks” (Leviticus 7:15), and a peace offering may be brought from second-tithe money."

        [
            "<b>And</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a peace offering</b> may be brought from second-tithe money is derived by a verbal analogy between <b>“there”</b> and <b>“there” from</b> the verse discussing second <b>tithe.</b> The verse states with regard to a peace offering: “And you shall sacrifice peace offerings and you shall eat there” (Deuteronomy 27:7), and the verse states with regard to second tithe: “And you shall eat before the Lord your God, in the place that He shall choose to cause His name to dwell there” (Deuteronomy 14:23). <b>And from this</b> it may be concluded: <b>Just as peace offerings are not themselves</b> brought from second <b>tithe,</b> as they are not produce, <b>so too</b> with regard to the loaves of <b>a thanks offering, they are not themselves</b> brought from second <b>tithe.

            "Now <b>I will say my reasoning</b> for why one may not prepare the loaves of a thanks offering with wheat that was purchased with second-tithe money: <b>From where do I derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a thanks offering</b> may be brought from second-tithe money? I derive it <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a peace offering.

            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Ma’aser Sheni</i> 1:4): Ideally, one should use second-tithe money to purchase peace offerings. If one purchases a peace offering with second-tithe money, only the flesh of the animal is consecrated, while its hide is non-sacred.

            "<b>Rav Ḥisda said: Actually,</b> the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir</b> that only one of two measuring vessels that held a tenth of an ephah was such that it held its measure when heaped. <b>And what</b> does the mishna means when it states: <b>All measuring vessels [<i>kol middot</i>]</b> in the Temple were heaped? It means that that <b>all measurements [<i>kol medidot</i>]</b> performed with that measuring vessel were done when its contents were heaped above its rim.",
            "§ The mishna discusses the status of overflows: The first <i>tanna</i> states simply that with regard to <b>measuring vessels for liquids, their overflows are sacred,</b> but with regard to measuring vessels for dry substances, their overflows are non-sacred. Rabbi Akiva explains that this distinction is a function of whether the measuring vessel is itself sacred. Rabbi Yosei explains it is function of whether the overflow had initially been inside the vessel. The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> matter <b>do</b> these three <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree?</b>",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that the <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>liquid</b> items, e.g., wine for libations and oil, were <b>anointed</b> and thereby consecrated <b>both on</b> the <b>inside and on</b> the <b>outside.</b> Therefore, the overflow is consecrated as it comes in contact with the outside of the vessel’s walls. The <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>dry</b> items, such as the flour for meal offerings, <b>were anointed</b> and consecrated only <b>on</b> the <b>inside, but were not anointed on</b> the <b>outside.</b> Therefore, the overflow is not consecrated when it comes into contact with the outside of the vessel’s walls.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Akiva,</b> who states the difference is due to whether the vessel is sacred or non-sacred, <b>holds</b> that the <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>liquid</b> items <b>were anointed on</b> the <b>inside and were not anointed on</b> the <b>outside,</b> whereas the <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>dry</b> items <b>were not anointed at all,</b> and they remained non-sacred and so could not consecrate the overflow.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that <b>this and that,</b> i.e., both types of measuring vessels, <b>were anointed</b> only <b>on the inside but were not anointed on the outside, and</b> so <b>here, this is the reason</b> behind whether the overflow was sacred: <b>As</b> the overflow <b>of liquid</b> was originally inside the vessel and <b>was</b> then <b>displaced, and it comes from the inside of the vessel,</b> it is therefore consecrated. <b>But the</b> overflow of <b>a dry</b> substance <b>was not</b> originally inside the vessel and then <b>displaced,</b> and so it is never consecrated.",
            "The Gemara questions this explanation of Rabbi Yosei’s opinion: <b>But</b> even <b>if</b> the overflow <b>was</b> previously inside the vessel and then <b>displaced, what of it? A person intends</b> to consecrate only <b>that which he requires,</b> and so even if the overflow had been inside the vessel it would not have been consecrated.",
            "<b>Rav Dimi bar Shishna said in the name of Rav: That is to say</b> that <b>service vessels consecrate</b> their contents even <b>without</b> the <b>intent</b> of the person using them. <b>Ravina said: Actually, I will say to you</b> that <b>service vessels consecrate</b> their contents <b>only with</b> the <b>intent</b> of the person using them, and by Torah law the overflows are not sacred. <b>But</b> the Sages issued <b>a decree</b> to regard them as sacred, <b>lest</b> people <b>say</b> that <b>one may transfer</b> a substance that has been consecrated <b>in a service vessel to non-sacred</b> status.",
            "<b>Rabbi Zeira raised an objection</b> to this explanation from a mishna (100a): Each Shabbat, new shewbread and bowls of frankincense were arranged on the Table in the Sanctuary. They remained there until the following Shabbat, at which point the frankincense was burned, thereby permitting the shewbread to be eaten. If the priest <b>arranged the bread and the bowls</b> of frankincense on the Table <b>after Shabbat,</b> during the week, <b>and</b> then <b>he burned the</b> frankincense in the <b>bowls on</b> the <b>Shabbat</b> at the end of that week, the bread is <b>disqualified,</b> as it had not been on the Table for a full seven days from one Shabbat to the next. <b>How</b> then <b>should one proceed</b> to prevent the disqualification? <b>He should leave</b> the bread on the Table <b>until the following Shabbat, as even if it remained on the Table for many days,</b> there is <b>nothing</b> wrong <b>with that,</b> provided that it is there for at least seven days. The frankincense may then be burned and it will permit the bread to be eaten.",
            "Rabbi Zeira explains his objection: <b>But why</b> is it permitted to leave the bread on the Table for more than seven days? <b>There too, let us say</b> that the Sages issued <b>a decree</b> disqualifying the bread <b>lest</b> people <b>say</b> that <b>one can store</b> sacred items <b>in a service vessel</b> overnight and that will prevent them becoming disqualified. Evidently, the Sages did not issue such decrees, and it follows that also with regard to using the measuring vessels they did not issue a decree.",
            "The Gemara rejects this claim: <b>Are you raising a contradiction</b> between a rite performed <b>inside</b> the Sanctuary, i.e., the arrangement of the shewbread, <b>and</b> a rite performed <b>outside</b> the Sanctuary, i.e., using the measuring vessels? Since in the case of a rite performed <b>inside</b> the Sanctuary <b>not everyone is aware</b> of what is happening, there is no concern that people will misinterpret what is going on and so there is no need to issue a decree concerning it. In the case of a rite performed <b>outside</b> the Sanctuary <b>everyone is aware</b> of what is happening, and there is a need to issue a decree to prevent people from drawing mistaken conclusions.",
            "§ The Gemara continues to discuss the overflow of measures. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Shekalim</i> 10b): <b>The surplus libations</b> were sold and the proceeds used <b>to</b> purchase <b>supplementary</b> offerings <b>of the altar [<i>keitz hamizbe’aḥ</i>].</b>",

            "<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef says:</b> It means <b>the overflows of measuring vessels.

The reason for this <i>halakha</i> is <b>that the</b> Temple <b>treasury is at an advantage.</b> In the latter case, the merchant ends up providing the Temple with a greater quantity of flour than had initially been intended. Consequently, the Temple has more flour than it requires. The extra amount is referred to as surplus libations, and it is sold in order to purchase supplementary offerings.",
            "The Gemara comments: It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef,</b> and it <b>is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b>",
            "The Gemara elaborates: It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef: These overflows of measuring vessels, what would be done with them?</b> They are gathered, and <b>if there is another offering</b> to be sacrificed that day, the priests <b>sacrifice</b> this liquid <b>with it</b> as part of its libations. <b>And if</b> there is no other offering that day, and instead the overflows <b>were left overnight</b> without being sacrificed, <b>they are disqualified by being left overnight.

            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>All offerings,</b> whether <b>communal or individual, require libations,</b> i.e., a meal offering and a wine libation, <b>except for the firstborn</b> offering, <b>the</b> animal <b>tithe</b> offering, <b>the Paschal offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering,</b> with which libations are not brought. <b>But</b> the exception to this exception is <b>that</b> the <b>sin offering of a leper and his guilt offering</b> do <b>require libations.</b>",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> that derives each of the rulings of the mishna from the verses that state the requirement to accompany animal offerings with the sacrifice of libations. The Torah states: “And you will make a fire offering to the Lord, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice, in fulfillment of a vow clearly uttered, or as a gift, or on your Festivals, to make a pleasing aroma to the Lord, of the herd or of the flock. And he who brings his offering to the Lord shall sacrifice a meal offering of a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a quarter-<i>hin</i> of oil; and wine for a libation, a quarter-<i>hin</i>, you shall make it with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice, for the one lamb” (Numbers 15:2–5). The Torah then proceeds to detail the quantities of flour, oil, and wine for a ram and a bull.",
            "The verse states: <b>“And you will make a fire offering to the Lord.”</b> Accordingly, one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>any</b> offering <b>that is raised up</b> on the altar <b>as a fire offering shall require</b> that <b>libations</b> be brought with it, <b>even a meal offering. The verse</b> then <b>states: “A burnt offering,”</b> which teaches that the requirement of libations applies only to animal burnt offerings, but not to meal offerings. If so, <b>from where</b> is it derived that <b>a peace offering</b> requires libations? <b>The verse states: “A sacrifice.” From where</b> is it derived that <b>a thanks offering</b> requires libations? <b>The verse states: “Or a sacrifice.”</b> The superfluous word “or” serves to include thanks offerings.",
            "One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I</b> should <b>include even the firstborn</b> offering, <b>the</b> animal <b>tithe</b> offering, <b>the Paschal offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering.</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states: “In fulfillment of a vow clearly uttered, or as a gift.”</b> This teaches that an offering that <b>comes in</b> fulfillment of <b>a vow or</b> as <b>a gift</b> offering <b>requires libations,</b> whereas each of these offerings, <b>which do not come in</b> fulfillment of <b>a vow or</b> as <b>a gift</b> offering but only as obligatory offerings, do <b>not require libations.</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: It has been <b>derived,</b> then, that one should <b>exclude these</b> offerings from the requirement of libations, as they are obligatory. Perhaps then <b>I will</b> likewise <b>exclude</b> the <b>obligatory</b> offerings <b>that come on account of the pilgrimage Festival,</b> which are sacrificed <b>on the pilgrimage Festival, and what are these?

To counter this, <b>the verse states: “Or on your Festivals,”</b> which indicates that <b>any</b> offering <b>that comes on your Festivals,</b> even if it is obligatory, <b>requires libations.</b>",
            "It has been <b>derived,</b> then, that one should <b>include</b> even <b>these</b> Festival offerings, despite the fact that they are obligatory.

            "Now, the requirement to bring libations with <b>a young bull was</b> already included <b>in the general</b> requirement to bring libations with any fire offering, as stated in the beginning of that passage; <b>and why,</b> then, <b>was it singled out</b> and mentioned explicitly? This is in order <b>to equate</b> all other offerings <b>to it,</b> teaching that the requirement of libations applies only to offerings similar to a young bull: <b>Just as a young bull is distinct</b> in that it <b>can come in</b> fulfillment of <b>a vow or</b> as <b>a gift</b> offering, <b>so too, any</b> offering that <b>comes in</b> fulfillment of <b>a vow or</b> as <b>a gift</b> offering requires libations.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: The verses at the beginning of the passage state: <b>“To make a pleasing aroma to the Lord, of the herd or of the flock.” What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> this? <b>Since</b> in the previous verse <b>it is stated: “A burnt offering,” I</b> would <b>derive</b> that all types of burnt offerings require libations, and <b>even a bird</b> sacrificed as a <b>burnt offering is indicated.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Of the herd or of the flock,”</b> which limits the requirement to offerings of animals such as sheep or cattle, but not to bird offerings; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yoshiya.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Yonatan says: This</b> verse <b>is unnecessary, as</b> the verse <b>states: “A sacrifice,” and a bird</b> offering <b>is not</b> referred to as <b>a sacrifice.

This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yonatan, why do I</b> need an independent <b>verse</b> to teach that one who takes a vow to bring a burnt offering does not have to bring both types? <b>Didn’t</b> Rabbi Yonatan himself <b>say</b> an exegetical principle that whenever the Torah mentions two details together with regard to a <i>halakha</i>, it is presumed that the <i>halakha</i> is fulfilled even when only one of the details is realized, <b>unless the verse specifies</b> that both details are required by writing the word: <b>Together,</b> in the verse? Accordingly, when the verse states: “Of the herd or of the flock,” the intention is that either one is sufficient, and there should be no need for an independent verse to teach this.",
            "The Gemara answers: Despite his principle, an independent verse <b>was necessary</b> to teach this, as it might <b>enter your mind to say:</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>Since</b> in Leviticus 1:2 <b>it is written: “And of the flock,”</b> and not merely: Of the flock, <b>it is as though</b> the word: <b>Together, was written</b> in the verse. Therefore, the verse in Numbers 15, which does state: “Or of the flock,” is necessary to teach that this is not the case.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And according</b> to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoshiya, who said</b> that <b>even though it is not</b> explicitly <b>written</b> in the verse: <b>Together, it is as though it is written: Together,</b> i.e., it is presumed that the <i>halakha</i> is fulfilled only when both details are realized, <b>a verse should be required.</b> Yet, in the <i>baraita</i>, Rabbi Yoshiya expounds the phrase “of the herd or of the flock” to teach a different <i>halakha</i>. From where, then, does he derive that one who takes a vow to bring a burnt offering does not need to bring both types of animals?",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>Isn’t it written: “If his offering is a burnt offering of the herd”</b> (Leviticus 1:3), and then in a separate verse it states: <b>“And if his offering is of the flock”</b> (Leviticus 1:9)? The fact that these possibilities are presented in two disjointed verses is an explicit indication that the burnt offering can be brought from even just one of these animals. Therefore, even Rabbi Yoshiya concedes that there is no reason to presume a burnt offering must be brought from both types there.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Yonatan, why does he require a verse at all? The Gemara explains: It <b>was necessary</b> to have a verse to teach this, because otherwise it might <b>enter your mind to say: These statements,</b> i.e., the verses that indicate it is sufficient to bring just one type of animal, concern a case <b>where one specifies</b> in his vow that he intends to bring just one animal, and the verses indicate that it is valid to bring just one. <b>But</b> if one vowed <b>without specification,</b> one might say: <b>Let him bring</b> burnt offerings <b>from both of them.</b> Therefore the phrase “of the herd or of the flock” <b>teaches us</b> that even in that case, it is sufficient to bring just one type of animal.",
            "§ The Gemara continues to analyze the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: From where is it derived that a peace offering requires libations? The verse states: “A sacrifice.” <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>a thanks offering</b> requires libations? <b>The verse states: “Or a sacrifice.”</b> The superfluous word “or” includes thanks offerings. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>a thanks offering is not</b> referred to as <b>a sacrifice?</b> It certainly is. Why, then, is it only included through the word “or”? The Gemara answers: An independent inclusion <b>was necessary,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say: Since</b> in any event <b>there is bread</b> brought <b>together with</b> the thanks offering, <b>it should not require libations.</b>",
            "The Gemara raises a question concerning this explanation: <b>But</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> a thanks offering <b>different from a nazirite’s ram, as there is bread</b> brought <b>together with it</b> also, <b>and</b> yet <b>it requires libations?</b> The verse states with regard to the ram of a nazirite: “And one unblemished ram for a peace offering, and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil, and their meal offering, and their libations” (Numbers 6:13–15).",
            "The Gemara answers: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that one should differentiate between the thanks offering and a nazirite’s ram as <b>there,</b> together with the nazirite’s ram, he brings only <b>two types</b> of bread, i.e., loaves and wafers, whereas, <b>here,</b> together with the thanks offering, one brings <b>four types</b> of bread. Therefore, one might have concluded that since there are many types of loaves it does not require libations. For that reason it is necessary to have an independent derivation that <b>teaches us</b> that it does require libations.",
            "The Gemara analyzes another one of the derivations of the <i>baraita</i>. The verse states: And you will make a fire offering to the Lord, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice, in fulfillment of a vow clearly uttered, or as a gift.” This teaches that an offering that comes in fulfillment of a vow or as a gift offering requires libations. The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> if that is the <i>halakha</i>, then <b>let the Merciful One write</b> only: <b>“In fulfillment of a vow clearly uttered, or as a gift,” and it would be unnecessary</b> to write: <b>“A burnt offering,”</b> as a burnt offering is a type of offering that can be brought as a vow or gift offering.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>Had the Merciful One not written “a burnt offering,” I would say</b> that the verse should be expounded as follows: <b>“And you will make a fire offering to the Lord”</b> is <b>a generalization,</b> indicating that all offerings require libations. But then it states: <b>“In fulfillment of a vow clearly uttered, or as a gift,”</b> which is <b>a detail,</b> indicating that the requirement applies only to offerings brought in fulfillment of a vow or as a gift. But with <b>“to</b> make <b>a pleasing aroma</b> to the Lord” <b>it then generalized.</b> If so, this is <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization,</b> and according to the principles of exegesis <b>you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail: Just as the detail is explicit</b> in referring to an offering <b>that does not come</b> to atone <b>for a sin,</b> but comes to fulfill a vow or as a gift, <b>so too any</b> offering <b>that does not come</b> to atone <b>for a sin</b> requires libations.",
            "Accordingly, <b>I</b> would <b>exclude a sin offering and a guilt offering</b> from the requirement to have libations, <b>as they come</b> to atone <b>for a sin,</b> and <b>I</b> would <b>include the firstborn</b> offering, <b>the</b> animal <b>tithe</b> offering, <b>and the Paschal offering, as they do not come</b> to atone <b>for a sin.</b> In order to preclude the possibility of expounding the verses in this way, <b>the verse states: “Burnt offering,”</b> as an additional detail, which serves to further exclude offerings that are brought only in fulfillment of an obligation.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Now that it is written: “Burnt offering,” what do you include through</b> the <b>generalization and detail</b> and generalization in this verse? The Gemara explains: <b>Just as the detail</b> of a burnt offering <b>is explicit</b> in referring to an offering <b>that one had not always been obligated</b> to bring, as it is referring to a burnt offering brought in fulfillment of a vow, which one became obligated to bring only once the vow was taken, <b>so too, any</b> offering <b>that one had not always been obligated</b> to bring requires libations.",
            "This serves <b>to include</b> in the requirement for libations the <b>offspring of consecrated</b> animals, e.g., of a female peace offering; <b>and substitutes of</b> consecrated animals, i.e., a non-sacred animal with regard to which one stated that it should be a substitute for a consecrated animal, in which case the result is that both animals are consecrated and must be sacrificed; <b>and a burnt offering that comes from</b> the proceeds of having sold <b>surpluses</b> of items donated to the Temple that were not needed.",
            "<b>And</b> this also serves to include <b>a guilt offering</b> whose owner either died or achieved atonement through sacrificing another animal and <b>which was</b> therefore <b>consigned to grazing</b> until it developed a blemish, at which point it should be sold and the proceeds used to purchase supplementary offerings for the altar. If instead, the guilt offering itself was sacrificed as a burnt offering, it is valid. In such a case, the offering requires libations. <b>And</b> this also serves to include <b>all offerings that were slaughtered not for their own sake.</b> Such offerings were brought to fulfill the owner’s obligation. Since they were not sacrificed for the sake of that purpose, the owner does not fulfill his obligation, but nevertheless the offerings are valid. In such a case, these offerings also require libations.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And now that you have said</b> that the word <b>“or”</b> in the phrase “or a sacrifice” is necessary <b>for the derivation</b> that teaches that the thanks offering requires libations, I can similarly ask <b>why do I</b> need the word “or” in the phrase <b>“in fulfillment of a vow clearly uttered or as a gift,” to separate</b> between <b>them?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>It was necessary</b> to write “or” in that phrase, as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>until one brings</b> both <b>a vow</b> offering <b>and a gift</b> offering together <b>they do not require libations.</b> The word “or” <b>teaches us</b> otherwise, <b>that</b> even <b>if one brings a vow</b> offering <b>by itself it requires libations, and if one brings a gift</b> offering <b>by itself he must bring libations.</b>",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>This works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoshiya,</b> as he holds that whenever the Torah does not explicitly separate between two details stated with regard to a <i>halakha</i>, it is presumed that the <i>halakha</i> is fulfilled only when both details are realized. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yonatan,</b> who holds that in general it is presumed that either detail is sufficient, <b>why do I</b> need the word “or”? The Gemara explains: Were it not for this word, it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that although the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>if one brings a vow</b> offering <b>by itself</b> it <b>requires libations,</b> and if <b>one brings a gift</b> offering <b>by itself</b> it <b>requires libations,</b> nevertheless, if <b>one brings</b> both <b>a vow</b> offering <b>and a gift</b> offering together, <b>it would be sufficient</b> to <b>bring libations for</b> just <b>one</b> of them. Therefore, the word “or” <b>teaches us</b> that libations are required for each offering.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the word “or” in the phrase <b>“or on your Festivals”?</b> The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>this matter,</b> that even when two offerings are brought together libations are required for each of them, applies only when they are distinct both in the type of offering and in the nature of the obligation to bring them, such as <b>where one brings a burnt offering in</b> fulfillment of <b>a vow and a peace offering as a gift</b> offering, <b>or vice versa.</b>",
            "<b>But where one brings a burnt offering and a peace offering</b> both <b>in</b> fulfillment of <b>a vow,</b> or <b>alternatively, a burnt offering and a peace offering</b> both <b>as gift</b> offerings, one might have said that since in the former case both offerings are of <b>a single type of</b> commitment, i.e., <b>a vow, and</b> in the latter case both are of <b>a single type of</b> commitment, i.e., <b>a gift</b> offering, therefore <b>it would be sufficient</b> to <b>bring libations for</b> just <b>one</b> of them. Consequently, the word “or” in the phrase <b>“or on your Festivals” teaches us</b> that even if they are distinct only in the type of offering, libations are required for each offering.",
            "The Gemara continues its analysis: <b>Why do I</b> need the word “or” in the verse: <b>“And when you prepare a young bull for a burnt offering or for a sacrifice”</b> (Numbers 15:9)? The Gemara explains: It <b>was necessary,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>this matter,</b> that when two offerings are brought together libations are required for each of them, applies only when the two offerings are distinct in the type of offering, such as <b>where one brings a burnt offering and a peace offering</b> both <b>in</b> fulfillment of <b>a vow,</b> or <b>alternatively, a burnt offering and a peace offering</b> both <b>as a gift</b> offering.",
            "<b>But where one brings two burnt offerings, one in</b> fulfillment of <b>a vow and one as a gift</b> offering, or <b>alternatively, two peace offerings, one in</b> fulfillment of <b>a vow and one as a gift</b> offering, <b>I would say</b> that since in the former case both offerings are of <b>a single type of</b> offering, i.e., <b>a peace offering, and</b> in the latter case both offerings are of <b>a single type of</b> offering, i.e., <b>a burnt offering,</b> therefore <b>it would be sufficient</b> to <b>bring libations for</b> just <b>one</b> of them. Consequently, the word “or” <b>teaches us</b> that even if they are distinct only in the nature of the commitment to bring them, libations are required for each offering.",
            "The Gemara continues: <b>Why do I</b> need the word “or” in the verse: <b>“In fulfillment of a vow clearly uttered or for peace offerings”</b> (Numbers 15:8)? The Gemara answers: It was necessary, as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>this matter,</b> that when two offerings are brought together libations are required for each of them, applies only where two offerings are distinct from each other either in the nature of the commitment to bring them or in the type of offering, such as <b>where one brings two burnt offerings, one in</b> fulfillment of <b>a vow and one as a gift</b> offering, or <b>alternatively, two peace offerings, one in</b> fulfillment of <b>a vow and one as a gift</b> offering.",
            "<b>But where one brings two burnt offerings,</b> both <b>in</b> fulfillment of <b>a vow, or two burnt offerings,</b> both <b>as a gift</b> offering, or <b>alternatively, two peace offerings,</b> both <b>in</b> fulfillment of <b>a vow, or two peace offerings,</b> both <b>as a gift</b> offering, I might have said with regard to the first of these cases that since both offerings are of <b>a single type of</b> offering, i.e., <b>a burnt offering, and</b> of <b>a single type of</b> commitment, i.e., <b>a vow,</b> and likewise with regard to the other cases, therefore, <b>it would be sufficient</b> to <b>bring libations for</b> just <b>one</b> of them. Consequently, the word “or” <b>teaches us</b> that even if the offerings are not distinct from each other at all, libations are nevertheless required for each one.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> teaches that according to Rabbi Yonatan, the word “or” in the phrase “of the herd or of the flock” teaches that one who takes a vow to bring a burnt offering fulfills his obligation even if he brings only one animal, either from the herd or from the flock. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Yoshiya, why do I</b> need the word “or” in <b>this</b> phrase <b>“of the herd or of the flock”?</b> Although the <i>baraita</i> explains that he expounds the phrase to teach that one does not bring libations with a bird offering, it does not explain what he derives from the word “or.”",
            "The Gemara explains: The word “or” is necessary, as otherwise it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>this matter,</b> that when two offerings are brought together libations are required for each of them, applies only <b>where</b> one brings <b>two kinds</b> of animals, i.e., one from the flock and one from the herd; <b>but where</b> both animals are of <b>a single kind, it would be sufficient for him</b> to bring <b>libations for</b> just <b>one</b> of them. Therefore, the word “or” <b>teaches us</b> that even if the offerings are of the same kind of animal, libations are nevertheless required for each one.",
            "Later in the passage concerning libations it states: “So shall be done for each young bull, or for each ram, or for each of the lambs, or of the goats. According to the number that you may prepare, <b>so you shall do for each one</b> according to their number” (Numbers 15:11–12). The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need this verse? The Gemara explains: It is necessary, as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>this matter,</b> that when two offerings are brought together libations are required for each of them, applies only <b>where</b> the offerings were consecrated <b>one after the other. But</b> if they were consecrated <b>at the same time, it would be sufficient for him</b> to bring <b>libations for</b> just <b>one</b> of them. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that in all cases, one must bring separate libations for each animal.",
            "§ The mishna teaches that in general sin offerings and guilt offerings do not require libations. <b>But</b> the exception is <b>that the sin offering of a leper and his guilt offering require libations.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? They are derived from a verse, <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning the following verse, which details the offerings a leper is required to bring as part of his purification process: “And on the eighth day he shall take two unblemished male lambs, and one unblemished female lamb in its year, <b>and three-tenths of fine flour for a meal offering,</b> mixed with oil, and one <i>log</i> of oil” (Leviticus 14:10). The <i>baraita</i> explains: It is <b>with regard to a meal offering that comes with</b> an animal <b>offering</b> that <b>the verse speaks,</b> and so it is stating that each of the three offerings mentioned requires libations.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Do you say</b> that it is <b>with regard to a meal offering that comes with</b> an animal <b>offering</b> that the verse speaks? <b>Or</b> perhaps it is <b>only with regard to a meal offering that comes by itself. When</b> the verse <b>states,</b> in the continuation of that passage: <b>“And the priest shall sacrifice the burnt offering and the meal offering”</b> (Leviticus 14:20), which demonstrates that the meal offering accompanies the burnt offering, <b>you must say</b> that in the earlier verse as well it is <b>with regard to a meal offering that comes with</b> an animal <b>offering that the verse speaks.</b>",
            "<b>But still, I do not know whether</b> this meal offering <b>requires</b> wine <b>libations or whether</b> it does <b>not.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And wine for pouring a libation, a quarter-<i>hin</i>, you shall prepare with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice, for the one lamb”</b> (Numbers 15:5). The verse is expounded as referring to each of the leper’s offerings: “The <b>burnt offering”; this</b> is referring to the <b>burnt offering of a leper.</b> “The <b>sacrifice”; this</b> is referring to the <b>sin offering of a leper.</b> And as for the word “or” in the phrase <b>“or for the sacrifice,” this</b> is referring to the <b>guilt offering of a leper.</b>",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>And let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>derive both</b> the sin offering and the guilt offering <b>from</b> the word <b>“sacrifice”</b> alone, without relating to the word “or.”"
        ],
        [
            "This would be just <b>as the Master said</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning a nazirite: A nazirite who completes his term of naziriteship is required to shave his hair and bring various offerings. With regard to the shaved hair, the verse states: “And he shall take the hair of his nazirite head, and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace offerings” (Numbers 6:18). The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>From where</b> is it derived that if, instead of putting his hair on the fire under the peace offering, he puts it on the fire under his <b>sin offering or</b> under his <b>guilt offering,</b> he still fulfills the obligation? <b>The verse states:</b> “The <b>sacrifice,”</b> which serves to include these two offerings. Evidently, the term “sacrifice” refers both to a sin offering and to a guilt offering. Why does the <i>baraita</i> concerning a leper derive a guilt offering only from the word “or”?",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>This matter,</b> that both a sin offering and a guilt offering can be derived from the same term, applies only <b>where they are both</b> brought <b>together,</b> for the same purpose, as in the case of a nazirite. Both offerings serve to render him fit, in the case of a pure nazirite to partake of wine and cut his hair, and in the case of an impure nazirite to begin counting his term of naziriteship again. <b>But</b> in the case of a leper, <b>where</b> his <b>guilt offering</b> serves <b>to render</b> him <b>fit</b> to return to the camp <b>and</b> his <b>sin offering</b> serves <b>to atone</b> for the sin that was the cause of his leprosy, since they come for different purposes, <b>we need two verses,</b> i.e., sources, to teach about the two of them.",
            "The Gemara once again questions the derivations in the <i>baraita</i>: “The <b>sacrifice”; this</b> is referring to the <b>sin offering of a leper.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does the <i>baraita</i> know this? <b>I could say</b> instead that <b>this</b> is referring the <b>sin offering and guilt offering of a nazirite.</b> The sin offering is brought by a nazirite who completes his term of naziriteship, and the guilt offering is brought by a nazirite who became ritually impure. Accordingly, only those offerings of a nazirite would require libations, but not the burnt offering of a leper.",
            "The Gemara rejects this possibility. This should <b>not enter your mind, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In describing the offerings a nazirite brings upon the completion of his term of naziriteship, the verse states: “And he shall sacrifice his offering to the Lord, one unblemished male lamb in its year as a burnt offering, and one unblemished female lamb in its year as a sin offering, and one unblemished ram as peace offerings…<b>and their meal offering, and their libations”</b> (Numbers 6:14–15). The <i>baraita</i> explains that it is <b>with regard to his burnt offering and his peace offering,</b> mentioned earlier in that passage, <b>that the verse speaks,</b> and so it is only those nazirite offerings that require libations.",
            "<b>Do you say</b> that the verse speaks <b>with regard to his burnt offering and his peace offering? Or</b> perhaps the verse speaks <b>even with regard to</b> the <b>sin offering</b> that a nazirite brings if he becomes ritually impure? To preclude the possibility of explaining the verse in that way, <b>the verse states</b> in the subsequent verses: <b>“And he shall make the ram a sacrifice of a peace offering</b> to the Lord, with the basket of unleavened bread; <b>and</b> the priest shall offer <b>its meal offering and its libations”</b> (Numbers 6:16–17).",
            "Now, this <b>ram</b> offering <b>was</b> already <b>included</b> with all other peace offerings, which all require libations. <b>Why,</b> then, was it <b>singled out</b> in this verse with an independent statement teaching that it requires libations? It was in order <b>to equate</b> all other offerings <b>to it,</b> teaching that the requirement of libations applies only to offerings similar to it. <b>Just as a ram is distinct</b> in that it <b>can come in</b> fulfillment of <b>a vow or</b> as <b>a gift</b> offering, <b>so too, any</b> offering that <b>can come in</b> fulfillment of <b>a vow or</b> as <b>a gift</b> offering requires libations. This excludes the sin offering and guilt offering of a nazirite, as they cannot be brought as vow offerings or gift offerings.",
            "The Gemara questions another of the derivations in the <i>baraita</i>: “The <b>burnt offering”; this</b> is referring to the <b>burnt offering of a leper.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does the <i>baraita</i> know this? <b>I could say</b> instead that <b>this</b> is referring the <b>burnt offering of a woman who gave birth</b> (see Leviticus 12:6), and if so, there would be no source to require libations for the burnt offering of a leper.",
            "<b>Abaye said:</b> The requirement to bring libations with the <b>burnt offering of a woman who gave birth is derived from the end of</b> that <b>verse,</b> so the term “the burnt offering,” mentioned just before it, remains available to include the burnt offering of a leper in the requirement for libations.",
            "This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And wine for pouring libations, a quarter-<i>hin</i>, you shall prepare with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice, for the one lamb” (Numbers 15:5). <b>Rabbi Natan says: “For</b> the one <b>lamb”; this</b> is referring to the <b>burnt offering of a woman who gave birth</b> and includes that offering in the requirement for libations. <b>“The one”; this</b> is referring to the <b>eleventh</b> animal <b>of</b> the animal <b>tithe, which is sacrificed</b> as <b>a peace offering.</b> In order to tithe his animals, the owner counts them one by one, and every tenth animal is consecrated as an animal tithe offering. If, when counting, he accidently counts the tenth animal as the ninth and the eleventh as the tenth, both are consecrated, the former as the animal tithe and the latter as a peace offering.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> comments: It is necessary to have an independent derivation to teach that the eleventh animal requires libations, <b>because we do not find</b> another <i>halakha</i> like <b>this in the entire Torah,</b> in <b>which the ancillary</b> case <b>is more stringent than the principal</b> case. In this case, the animal tithe offering itself does not require libations.",
            "The Gemara presents another answer. <b>Rava says:</b> The verse is expounded to be referring to three different offerings and includes them in the requirement to bring libations. It is reasonable that these three offerings all share an association with each other. <b>What is</b> the only <b>matter</b> in which three offerings are brought <b>that</b> would <b>necessitate three inclusions</b> to teach that each of them require libations? <b>You must say</b> that <b>this</b> is the offerings of <b>a leper,</b> who brings three different offerings.",
            "§ It is further stated in the passage concerning libations: “Or <b>for a ram,</b> you shall prepare a meal offering of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour, mixed with one-third of a <i>hin</i> of oil” (Numbers 15:6–7). The details of the meal offering brought with a ram are also mentioned elsewhere: “And two-tenths of fine flour for a meal offering, mixed with oil, for the one ram” (Numbers 28:12); therefore, the Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the verse here to state this? <b>Rav Sheshet says:</b> This verse serves <b>to include</b> in the requirement for libations <b>the ram of Aaron,</b> i.e., the ram of the High Priest that he sacrifices as a burnt offering on Yom Kippur.",
            "The Gemara challenges: But the requirement to bring libations with <b>the ram of Aaron</b> should be <b>derived from</b> the term: <b>“On your Festivals”</b> (Numbers 15:3), as the <i>baraita</i> derived from that term that all obligatory offerings of Festivals require libations. The Gemara resolves this challenge: It is necessary to have an independent derivation for the ram of Aaron, as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>this matter,</b> that obligatory offerings of Festivals require libations, applies only to <b>communal</b> offerings, <b>but not</b> to offerings <b>of an individual,</b> such as the ram of Aaron.",
            "The Gemara questions this: <b>But</b> why would one think that because the ram of Aaron is an offering of an individual it would not require libations? In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> it <b>different from</b> the <b>burnt offering of a woman who gave birth,</b> which is also brought by an individual and yet it requires libations?",
            "The Gemara explains: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>this matter,</b> i.e., the conclusion drawn from the <i>halakha</i> of the burnt offering of a woman who gave birth that even offerings of an individual require libations, applies only to an offering <b>that does not have a fixed time</b> when it must be sacrificed; <b>but</b> with regard to an offering <b>that has a fixed time</b> when it must be sacrificed, <b>I</b> might <b>say</b> that it does <b>not</b> require libations. Accordingly, it is necessary to have an independent derivation that <b>teaches us</b> that the ram of Aaron requires libations.",
            "The Gemara continues to expound the verse cited: <b>Why do I</b> need the word “or” in the phrase <b>“or for a ram”?</b> The Gemara explains: It serves <b>to include</b> the sacrifice of <b>a <i>palges</i></b> in the requirement to bring libations. When referring to sheep, the Torah speaks only of lambs and rams. A sheep during its first twelve months is called a lamb, and one older than thirteen months is called a ram. A <i>palges</i> is a sheep in its thirteenth month and is never explicitly mentioned by the Torah. It is therefore necessary to have an independent derivation to teach that if one is sacrificed, libations must be brought with it.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>This works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, who said</b> that a <i>palges</i> <b>is</b> considered an independent <b>entity,</b> i.e., it is not regarded as a lamb or a ram, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 1:3): One who is obligated to sacrifice a lamb or a ram and <b>sacrificed</b> a <i>palges</i> <b>should bring with it the libations</b> that are required when bringing <b>a ram, but</b> nevertheless its sacrifice <b>is not considered</b> a fulfillment of <b>his</b> obligation to bring <b>an offering</b> of a ram or a lamb. <b>And,</b> commenting on this mishna, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that the requirement to bring libations in this case is derived from the phrase <b>“or for a ram,”</b> which serves <b>to include</b> the sacrifice of <b>a <i>palges</i>.</b>",
            "<b>But</b> the need for an independent derivation is difficult <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>bar Padda; as he said</b> that in the mishna’s case, the individual <b>brings</b> the libations of a ram <b>but stipulates</b> concerning them that if a <i>palges</i> is a ram, then all of the libations should be regarded as its libations, and if a <i>palges</i> is a lamb, then the quantity of those libations required for a lamb should be regarded as its libations and the rest should be regarded as a gift offering, <b>because</b> he holds that a <i>palges</i> is either a lamb or a ram but that it <b>is uncertain</b> to us which it is. According to bar Padda, one can ask: <b>Is it necessary</b> to have <b>a verse to include an uncertain</b> case? Although it is not known how to categorize a <i>palges</i>, it is included either in the category of a sheep or a ram, and its libations are therefore detailed in the verse.",
            "The Gemara concludes: <b>Certainly, according to</b> the opinion of <b>bar Padda,</b> this matter is <b>difficult.</b>",
            "§ The Gemara discusses another verse in the passage about libations: <b>“So it shall be done for the one bull, or for the one ram, or for the kid of the lambs or of the goats”</b> (Numbers 15:11). Ostensibly, this verse states nothing beyond that which has already been explained in the beginning of that passage, which delineates the requirement of libations for each type of animal offering. The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “For the one bull”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Since we have found the verse differentiates between the libations of a ram and the libations of a lamb,</b> even though they are both sheep, one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>we</b> should likewise <b>differentiate between the libations of a bull,</b> which is in its second year, <b>and the libations of a calf,</b> which is still in its first year. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “For the one bull,”</b> teaching that there is one <i>halakha</i> for all bulls, including calves, i.e., the same requirement applies to them.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “For the one ram”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Since we have found the verse differentiates</b> with regard to sheep <b>between the libations of</b> a lamb <b>in</b> its first <b>year and the libations of</b> a ram <b>in</b> its <b>second</b> year, one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>we</b> should further <b>differentiate</b> with regard to rams themselves <b>between the libations of</b> a ram <b>in</b> its <b>second</b> year <b>and the libations of</b> a ram <b>in</b> its <b>third</b> year. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “For the one ram,”</b> teaching that there is one <i>halakha</i> for all rams.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “For the kid of the lambs”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Since we have found that the verse differentiates</b> with regard to male sheep <b>between the libations of a male lamb and the libations of a ram,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>we</b> should further <b>differentiate between the libations of a female lamb and the libations of a ewe.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “For the kid of the lambs.”</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “Or of the goats”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Since we have found that the verse differentiates</b> with regard to sheep <b>between the libations of a male lamb and the libations of a ram,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>we</b> should further <b>differentiate between the libations of a kid and the libations of</b> an older <b>goat.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Or of the goats.”</b>",
            "§ Having mentioned the libations of a ewe, the Gemara relates that <b>Rav Pappa said: Rava tested us</b> by asking the following question:"
        ],
        [
            "<b>How much</b> wine is used for the <b>libations of a ewe? And I resolved</b> this question <b>from</b> that which is stated in <b>a mishna</b> (<i>Shekalim</i> 14b): Generally, the wine for libations would be procured from the supplies of the Temple. One bringing an offering would pay the Temple treasurer for the quantity of wine required, and then the treasurer would give him a token as a receipt indicating what had been paid for. The individual would then proceed to the official appointed over the Temple’s supplies to collect the wine he had paid for. If the token had the word: <b>Kid,</b> it could be <b>used</b> to collect wine for <b>libations for sheep,</b> whether <b>large or small, male or female, except for those of rams.</b> Evidently, the same quantity is required for the libations of ewes as for lambs.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> For <b>all communal offerings there is no</b> mitzva of <b>placing hands</b> on the head of the offering, <b>except for the bull that comes</b> to atone <b>for</b> a community-wide violation of <b>any</b> one <b>of the mitzvot</b> that was perpetrated due to an erroneous ruling of the Sanhedrin, where the judges of the Sanhedrin are required to place their hands upon its head (see Leviticus 4:13–21); <b>and the scapegoat</b> brought on Yom Kippur, upon which the High Priest places his hands (see Leviticus, chapter 16). <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Also</b> in the case of the <b>goat</b> that comes to atone for a community-wide perpetration of <b>idol worship</b> that occurred due to an erroneous ruling of the Sanhedrin, the judges of the Sanhedrin are required to place their hands upon its head (see Numbers 15:22–26).",
            "<b>All offerings of an individual require placing hands, except for the firstborn</b> offering, <b>the</b> animal <b>tithe</b> offering, <b>and the Paschal offering.</b>",
            "The mitzva of placing hands is performed by the owner of the offering. The mishna adds: <b>And</b> if the owner died, then <b>the heir</b> is regarded as the offering’s owner and so he <b>places</b> his <b>hands</b> on the offering <b>and brings</b> the accompanying <b>libations. And</b> furthermore, <b>he can substitute</b> a non-sacred animal for it. Although it is prohibited to perform an act of substitution, if the owner of an offering does this, his attempt is successful to the extent that the non-sacred animal is thereby consecrated, even though the original offering also remains sacred.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: For <b>all communal offerings there is no</b> mitzva of <b>placing hands, except for the bull that comes</b> to atone <b>for</b> a community-wide violation of <b>any</b> one <b>of the mitzvot, and</b> the <b>goats</b> that come to atone <b>for</b> a community-wide violation of the prohibition <b>of idol worship;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon.

            "The Gemara interrupts the citation of the <i>baraita</i> with a question: Why does Rabbi Yehuda search for an additional case?

            "The Gemara elaborates on the dispute. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said: And</b> Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Yehuda, who disagree as to whether the High Priest achieves atonement through the scapegoat, each <b>follow</b> their standard line of <b>reasoning.</b>",
            "This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: At the end of the passage delineating the Yom Kippur Temple service, the verse states: “He shall bring atonement upon the sanctum of the sacred, and upon the Tent of Meeting and the altar he shall effect atonement; and upon the priests and upon all the people, shall he bring atonement” (Leviticus 16:33). <b>“He shall bring atonement upon the sanctum of the sacred”; this</b> is referring to <b>the innermost sanctum,</b> i.e., the Holy of Holies. <b>“And upon the Tent of Meeting”; this</b> is referring to the <b>Sanctuary.</b> “And the <b>altar”;</b> this is understood <b>in accordance with its plain meaning. “He shall effect atonement”; this</b> is referring to the Temple <b>courtyards.</b> “And upon the <b>priests”;</b> this is understood <b>in accordance with its plain meaning.</b> “And <b>upon all the people”; these are the Israelites. “Shall he bring atonement”; this</b> is referring to <b>the Levites.</b>",
            "<b>All of them are equated with regard to</b> the fact that they are all atoned for through <b>one atonement,</b> i.e., <b>that they are atoned for by the scapegoat</b> for all transgressions other than the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods.

As it is stated</b> with regard to blood: “For the soul of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you upon the altar to effect atonement for your souls, <b>for it is the blood of the soul that effects atonement”</b> (Leviticus 17:11). <b>Rather,</b> the verse serves <b>to say to you that if one treated placing hands</b> as though it were <b>a non-essential mitzva</b> and therefore neglected to perform it, then <b>the verse ascribes him</b> blame <b>as though he did not effect atonement; but</b> nevertheless, in actuality, the offering <b>atones</b> for his sin and he does not need to bring another offering.",
            "<b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to waving in this way:</b> “He shall take one male lamb as a guilt offering <b>to be waved to effect atonement</b> for him” (Leviticus 14:21). The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>Does waving</b> the offering <b>effect atonement? Isn’t atonement</b> effected <b>only through</b> the presentation of <b>the blood?

            "§ The mishna further states that that placing hands is performed by leaning <b>on the head</b> of the offering. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The phrase “his hand upon the head” is mentioned three times in Leviticus, chapter 3. Each mention is expounded to exclude the possibility of performing the rite on a different part of the animal’s body. Placing hands is performed with <b>“his hand upon the head”</b> (Leviticus 3:2), <b>but not</b> with <b>his hand on the neck</b> of the animal; with <b>“his hand upon the head”</b> (Leviticus 3:8), <b>but not</b> with <b>his hand on the back</b> of the animal; with <b>“his hand upon the head”</b> (Leviticus 3:13), <b>but not</b> with <b>his hand on the breast</b> of the animal.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>all these</b> three exclusions? The Gemara explains that all three mentions <b>are necessary,</b> as <b>had the Merciful One written</b> only <b>one</b> exclusion, <b>I would say</b> that it serves <b>to exclude</b> only the animal’s <b>neck, as it is not level with the head of</b> the animal. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>its back, which is level with its head,</b> one might <b>say</b> that it is <b>not</b> precluded and that one can fulfill the requirement by placing one’s hands there. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to have an independent source to exclude the animal’s back.",
            "<b>And had</b> the Torah <b>taught us</b> only <b>these two</b> <i>halakhot</i>, one would have excluded only the neck and the back, <b>as</b> those parts are <b>not included in</b> the <b>waving</b> of the offering, i.e., they are not waved. <b>But</b> with regard to the animal’s <b>breast, which is included in the waving</b> of the offering, one might say that it is <b>not</b> precluded and that one can fulfill the requirement by placing one’s hands there. Therefore, the third mention is <b>necessary</b> to teach that placing hands cannot be performed even on the animal’s breast.",
            "<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If one placed <b>his hand on the sides</b> of the animal’s head, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>; does one fulfill the requirement of placing hands by doing so? The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Abba Bira’a, son of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, says</b> that the verse: “And he shall place <b>his hand upon the head of</b> the burnt offering” (Leviticus 1:4), indicates that it must be done with his hand <b>on</b> the top of <b>its head and not</b> with <b>his hand on the sides</b> of its head.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma:</b> If one’s hands were wrapped in <b>a cloth, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> as <b>to</b> whether the cloth is regarded as <b>an interposition</b> between his hands and the animal such that it invalidates the rite? The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from a <i>baraita</i>, which states: The rite is valid <b>provided that there is no item that interposes between him and the offering.</b>",
            "§ The mishna adds that the placing of hands is performed <b>with two hands.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Reish Lakish said: As the verse states</b> with regard to the Yom Kippur service: <b>“And Aaron shall place both his hands [<i>yadav</i>]</b> upon the head of the live goat” (Leviticus 16:21). The word <i>yadav</i>, meaning: His hands, is written without a second <i>yod</i>, and so if read without vowels it reads as: <b>His hand. But it is</b> also <b>written “both,”</b> which makes clear that the intention is that he must use both of his hands. <b>This established a paradigm</b> that in <b>any place where it is stated</b> in the Torah: <b>His hand, there are here two</b> hands, <b>unless the verse</b> explicitly <b>specifies</b> that there is only <b>one.</b>",
            "The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Elazar went and stated this <i>halakha</i> in the study hall, but he did not say it in the name of Reish Lakish. Reish Lakish heard</b> about this <b>and became angry.</b> He <b>said to</b> Rabbi Elazar: <b>If it enters your mind</b> that <b>wherever it is written: His hand,</b> the meaning is that <b>there are</b> actually <b>two</b> hands, then <b>why do I</b> ever need the Torah <b>to write: His hands, his hands,</b> i.e., <i>yadav</i> in the plural, which it does on numerous occasions?",
            "Reish Lakish <b>raised objections against him</b> from <b>twenty-four</b> occasions where the Torah writes: <b>His hands,</b> for example: <b>“His own hands [<i>yadav</i>] shall bring</b> the offerings of the Lord” (Leviticus 7:30); <b>“his hands [<i>yadav</i>] shall contend for him,</b> and You shall be a help against his adversaries” (Deuteronomy 33:7); <b>“Guiding his hands [<i>yadav</i>] wittingly,</b> for Manasseh was the firstborn” (Genesis 48:14). Rabbi Elazar <b>was silent,</b> as he had no response.",
            "<b>After</b> Reish Lakish had <b>calmed down, he said to</b> Rabbi Elazar: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>you did not say to me</b> the following: When I established that paradigm, <b>I was speaking</b> only about the term: <b>His hands [<i>yadav</i>], with regard to placing hands.</b> But with regard to other <i>halakhot</i>, when the Torah says “his hand” the reference is to just one hand, and so when referring to two hands it must say “his hands.”",
            "The Gemara asks: But <b>also with regard to placing hands it is written,</b> concerning Moses’ ordination of Joshua: <b>“And he placed his hands [<i>yadav</i>] upon him</b> and gave him a charge” (Numbers 27:23), using the plural “his hands” [<i>yadav</i>] instead of: His hand [<i>yado</i>]. The Gemara clarifies that Reish Lakish meant that one could say: When I established that paradigm, <b>I was speaking</b> only about the term: His hands [<i>yadav</i>], <b>with regard to placing hands</b> on <b>an animal</b> offering. But in all other cases, if the intention is that there were two hands, the plural must be used.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: <b>And in the</b> same <b>location</b> in the Temple <b>that one places hands, one slaughters</b> the animal. <b>And immediately following</b> the rite of <b>placing hands,</b> the <b>slaughter</b> is performed. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the mishna <b>saying?</b> The mishna appears to state two distinct rulings. But if so, the first statement is superfluous, because if the slaughter immediately follows the placing of hands, then it is obvious that the animal is slaughtered without changing its location. The Gemara explains that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: In the</b> same <b>location</b> in the Temple <b>that one places hands one slaughters</b> the animal, <b>because immediately following</b> the rite of <b>placing hands,</b> the <b>slaughter</b> is performed. There are not two distinct rulings; rather, the second statement is the explanation of the first.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There is an aspect of greater <b>stringency with regard to placing hands than</b> there is <b>with regard to waving, and</b> there is an aspect of greater stringency <b>with regard to waving than</b> there is <b>with regard to placing hands.</b> The stringency with regard to placing hands is <b>that</b> if several people are partners in bringing an offering, <b>one</b> of them <b>waves</b> the offering <b>on behalf of all the</b> other <b>partners, but one cannot</b> fulfill the requirement of placing hands if he alone <b>places hands on behalf of all the</b> other <b>partners;</b> rather, each member must place hands himself. <b>The stringency with regard to waving</b> is <b>that waving is practiced in</b> the cases of both <b>offerings of an individual,</b> e.g., peace offerings, where the breast and thigh and sacrificial portions are waved, <b>and in</b> the cases of <b>communal offerings,</b> e.g., the two lambs sacrificed on <i>Shavuot</i>, which are waved together with the two loaves;"

            "It is necessary for the verse to teach this, <b>as</b> one <b>might</b> have thought: <b>Could it not</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference</b> that only one partner needs to place his hands on the offering? The inference is as follows: <b>If</b> the requirement of <b>waving, which was amplified to apply</b> also <b>to slaughtered</b> animals, nevertheless <b>was limited with regard to</b> an offering jointly owned by a number of <b>partners,</b> as only one of them waves on behalf of all of them, then with regard to the requirement of <b>placing hands, which was not amplified to apply</b> also <b>to slaughtered</b> animals, <b>is it not logical that it was</b> also <b>limited with regard to</b> an offering jointly owned by <b>partners,</b> and it is sufficient for one partner to place his hands on behalf of the others? To counter this inference, <b>the verse states: “His offering,” to include each of the owners of an offering in</b> the requirement of <b>placing hands.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> one could suggest the opposite inference and conclude that the requirement of <b>waving should be amplified with regard to partners, through</b> the following <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If</b> the requirement of <b>placing hands, which was not amplified to apply</b> also <b>to slaughtered</b> animals, <b>was amplified with regard to</b> an offering jointly owned by <b>partners,</b> requiring each partner to perform it himself, then with regard to the requirement of <b>waving, which was amplified to apply</b> also <b>to slaughtered</b> animals, <b>is it not logical that it was</b> also <b>amplified with regard to</b> an offering jointly owned by <b>partners,</b> requiring each partner to perform it himself?",
            "The Gemara rejects this: This inference cannot be correct, <b>because</b> it is obvious that only one of the partners needs to perform the waving. <b>It is not possible</b> to have all of them perform it, <b>as how would it be done?</b> If one says: <b>Let all of</b> the partners <b>wave together,</b> with each one placing his hands under those of another, that is difficult: There <b>would be</b> an invalidating <b>interposition</b> between the offering and hands of the partners who are not directly holding onto the offering. And if one says: <b>Let</b> one partner <b>wave, and then</b> the next one <b>will wave,</b> and so on, that would also be invalid, as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah that one must perform <b>a waving,</b> using a singular noun, which indicates that one waving, <b>but not</b> multiple <b>wavings,</b> should be performed.",
            "§ The mishna states that placing hands is not performed upon a slaughtered offering. The Gemara questions this: <b>And is there no</b> instance of <b>placing hands</b> performed <b>on slaughtered</b> animals? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Tamid</i> 33b): <b>When the High Priest</b> would <b>want to sacrifice</b> the daily offering, as it is his right to be the one to sacrifice it whenever he wishes to, <b>he would ascend the ramp</b> to the top of the altar, <b>and the deputy [<i>segan</i>]</b> High Priest would also ascend <b>to the right</b> of the High Priest.

            "Then <b>the second</b> priest <b>would hold out the two forelegs to the first</b> priest, and the first priest would <b>give them to the High Priest,</b> who would <b>place</b> his <b>hands upon them and</b> then <b>throw them</b> onto the fire.

            "This mishna apparently demonstrates an instance of placing hands performed upon a slaughtered animal. In resolution of this difficulty, <b>Abaye said:</b> In the mishna <b>there,</b> the placing of hands is not in fulfillment of the requirement to do so to an offering; rather, it is done merely <b>due to the eminence of the High Priest,</b> so that his sacrifice of the limbs of an offering is more distinguished than when performed by ordinary priests.",

            "The Gemara explains their respective reasons: <b>The one who says</b> the shewbread <b>is disqualified</b> derives his opinion from a verse, <b>as it is written:</b> “Then the Tent of Meeting shall journey with the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camps; <b>as they encamp, so shall they journey,</b> every man in his place, by their banners” (Numbers 2:17). The verse juxtaposes the encampments with the journeys, indicating that <b>just as when</b> the Tabernacle is <b>encamped</b> the shewbread is <b>disqualified when</b> it <b>leaves</b> the Tabernacle courtyard, <b>so too, when</b> the Tabernacle <b>journeys</b> the shewbread is <b>disqualified when</b> it <b>leaves</b> the courtyard.",
            "<b>According to the one who says</b> the shewbread <b>is not disqualified</b> during the journeys, this is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written: “Then the Tent of Meeting shall journey,”</b> indicating that <b>even though it has journeyed it is</b> still considered <b>the Tent of Meeting,</b> and therefore the shewbread is not disqualified.",

The Gemara replies that according to this opinion, the juxtaposition of the encampments with the journeys is interpreted <b>in the other direction: Just as when</b> the Tabernacle is <b>encamped, if</b> one <b>does not take</b> the shewbread <b>out</b> of the courtyard <b>it is not disqualified, so too, when</b> the Tabernacle <b>journeys, if</b> one <b>does not take</b> the shewbread <b>out</b> of the courtyard <b>it is not disqualified.</b>",

            "The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement is <b>in accordance with the</b> opinion of the <b>one who said</b> the Table’s <b>frame was</b> not above the Table’s surface but <b>below</b> it, and therefore it did not add any height to the arrangements on the Table. <b>And</b> furthermore, even <b>according to the one who said</b> the Table’s <b>frame was above</b> the Table’s surface, it did not add to the height of the arrangements.

The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yosei: The Table’s <b>frame was below</b> the Table’s surface, and therefore the panels were required to support the loaves.",
            "§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: According to the statement of the one who says</b> that the Table’s <b>frame was below</b> the Table’s surface, the surface was merely a flat board. It is a halakhic principle with regard to wooden utensils that only rounded utensils are susceptible to ritual impurity, but not flat utensils. It is known that the shewbread Table was susceptible to impurity. One may therefore infer from this that a flat <b>board is susceptible to impurity,</b> provided <b>that</b> it <b>can be turned over</b> and used on both sides. This is because the wide surface of the board renders it functionally similar to a concave receptacle.",
            "Rabbi Yoḥanan continues: <b>According to the statement of the one who says</b> that the Table’s <b>frame was above</b> the Table’s surface, the Table served as a receptacle.

            "The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? The verse states with regard to items that are rendered impure by the carcasses of creeping animals: “And anything upon which any of them fall when they are dead shall be impure, whether it is any vessel of wood, or cloth, or leather, or sack” (Leviticus 11:32). The verse juxtaposes wooden vessels with sacks, indicating that <b>we require</b> a wooden vessel to be <b>similar to a sack</b> in order to be susceptible to ritual impurity. <b>Just as a sack is carried</b> both when it is <b>full and</b> when it is <b>empty, so too, any</b> wooden vessel that is <b>carried</b> both <b>full and empty</b> is susceptible to impurity.

The term “the <b>pure</b> Table” teaches <b>by inference that there is</b> a case where the Table becomes <b>impure,</b> and therefore the Torah states that the Table must be pure when the shewbread is set upon it. This conclusion is difficult, as the principle that a wooden vessel designated to rest in a fixed place is not susceptible to impurity indicates that the Table should not be susceptible to impurity.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the verse <b>teaches that</b> the priests would <b>lift</b> the Table with its shewbread <b>to display the shewbread to the pilgrims</b> standing in the Temple courtyard, <b>and</b> a priest would <b>say to them: See</b> how <b>beloved you</b> are <b>before,</b> i.e., in the eyes of, <b>the Omnipresent,</b> Who constantly performs a miracle with regard to the shewbread.

If <b>an area of their</b> surface large enough for <b>placing cups</b> there <b>was left</b> unbroken or uncovered with marble they remain <b>susceptible to impurity.

            "One can infer from the mishna that if one <b>left</b> part of the surface area of the table without covering it with marble, <b>yes,</b> it remains susceptible to impurity. But if <b>he did not leave</b> part of the table without covering it with marble it is <b>not</b> susceptible to impurity. Evidently, the status of a vessel is determined according to the material of its external covering and not according to its main material. Consequently, since the shewbread Table was covered with gold it should have the status of a metal vessel, which is susceptible to ritual impurity even if it is designated to rest in a fixed place.",
            "<b>And if you would say</b> the case of the shewbread Table is different, as <b>here,</b> with regard to the marble-covered table, the mishna is referring <b>to a permanent covering</b> that is fixed to the table with nails, whereas <b>there,</b> in the case of the shewbread Table, the discussion is referring <b>to a covering that is not permanent,</b> as the gold was not attached to the shewbread Table with nails, this explanation is difficult. <b>But didn’t Reish Lakish raise a dilemma to Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> Is the mishna that discusses the marble-covered table referring only <b>to a permanent covering, or</b> even <b>to a covering that is not permanent?</b> Is it referring only to a case <b>where</b> one <b>covered</b>"

It is therefore not necessary to derive that the Table is susceptible to impurity due to the fact that it is not designated to rest in a fixed place.",
            "The Gemara suggests another explanation: <b>And if you would say</b> that the <b>acacia wood</b> from which the shewbread Table is fashioned is different, as it is <b>an important,</b> valuable type of wood <b>and</b> therefore the Table’s status as a wooden vessel <b>is not negated</b> by the fact that it was covered with gold, there would still be a difficulty. <b>This</b> explanation <b>works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish, who said:</b> The mishna <b>taught</b> that the status of a wooden vessel is determined according to the material of its covering <b>only with regard to vessels</b> made <b>of</b> medium-grade <b><i>akhsalgos</i></b> wood, <b>which come from overseas, but vessels</b> made <b>of</b> expensive <b><i>masmas</i></b> wood <b>are important, and</b> therefore their status as wooden vessels <b>is not negated</b> by the covering.

            "§ The mishna describes the shewbread Table (96a): <b>There were four panels of gold there,</b> which split up at their upper ends, above the Table, and there were twenty-eight rods that rested upon the panels. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Ketina said: The verse states</b> with regard to the Table: <b>“And you shall make its dishes and its pans, <i>uksotav umnakkiyyotav</i>,</b> with which it shall be covered; of pure gold you shall make them” (Exodus 25:29).",
            "Rav Ketina interprets the verse: <b>“Its dishes,” these are</b> the <b>molds</b> in which the loaves are kneaded, baked, and placed after baking (see 94a). <b>“Its pans,” these are</b> the <b>bowls</b> for the frankincense that is placed on the Table with the shewbread. <b>“<i>Kesotav</i>,” these are</b> the four <b>panels</b> of gold. <b>“<i>Umnakkiyyotav</i>,” these are</b> the <b>rods,</b> which rest on the notches in the panels and bear the loaves, one on top of the other. <b>“With which it shall be covered,”</b> this indicates <b>that the bread is covered by</b> the rods.",
            "<b>Rava raises an objection</b> to this interpretation, which indicates that the rods are required by Torah law: The mishna states: <b>Neither the arranging of the rods</b> for the new shewbread, <b>nor their removal</b> from the arrangement of the old shewbread, <b>overrides Shabbat. And if it enters your mind</b> to say the rods are required <b>by Torah</b> law, <b>why does</b> their arrangement <b>not override Shabbat?</b>",
            "<b>Rava then said: That which I said,</b> that one can infer from the mishna that the rods are not required by Torah law, <b>is not correct, as we learned</b> in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Akiva stated a principle: Any labor that can be performed on Shabbat eve does not override Shabbat. And these</b> actions, arranging and removing the rods, <b>can also</b> be performed in a manner <b>that does not</b> require <b>overriding Shabbat for them,</b> as the rods can be removed before Shabbat, and the rods can be arranged for the new loaves once Shabbat has ended.",
            "Rava explains why the rods can be arranged after Shabbat: <b>What is the reason</b> that the rods are required? They are necessary in order to create a gap between the loaves, so that the <b>bread does not become moldy. In</b> such a short time <b>period as this,</b> from when the new loaves are placed on the Table on Shabbat until the arrangement of the rods after Shabbat, the loaves will <b>not become moldy.</b>",
            "This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the removal and arrangement of the rods: <b>How</b> does the priest proceed? <b>He enters</b> the Sanctuary <b>on Shabbat eve and removes</b> the rods from between the loaves. <b>And he places them</b> in the space of two handbreadths between the two arrangements, <b>along the length of</b> the <b>Table. And</b> at <b>the conclusion of Shabbat he enters</b> the Sanctuary again. <b>He raises the ends of a loaf</b> of the shewbread <b>and inserts a rod underneath it, and again raises the ends of a loaf and inserts a rod underneath it.</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues to describe the placement of the rods: Each arrangement contains six loaves.

            "§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Kelim</i> 17:10) that <b>Rabbi Meir says: All</b> the <b>cubits that were</b> mentioned <b>with regard to the Temple</b> were <b>medium</b> cubits, consisting of six handbreadths, <b>except</b> in the case <b>of</b> the following items: <b>The golden altar,</b> which was one cubit long and one cubit wide; each protruding <b>corner</b> of the external altar, which were one cubit long, one cubit wide, and one cubit high; <b>the surrounding ledge</b> of the external altar, which was five cubits high and one cubit wide; <b>and the base</b> of the altar, which was one cubit high and one cubit wide.

            "The Gemara explains the difficulty: According to the previous calculation, the surrounding ledge was only three handbreadths above the halfway mark.

            "<b>Rather,</b> the verse must be interpreted differently: <b>“The bottom shall be a cubit,”</b> this is referring <b>to the height of</b> the base. <b>“The breadth a cubit,”</b> this is referring to the width of the surrounding ledge, where the wall of the altar is <b>inset</b> by one cubit. <b>“Its border by its edge round about</b> shall be the one span,”"

        [
            "this is referring to the measurements of the corners of the altar, concerning which there <b>is no difference</b> with regard to <b>this,</b> their height, <b>and</b> there <b>is no difference</b> with regard to <b>that,</b> their width, as both are measured with a cubit of five handbreadths.",
            "Accordingly, <b>how many</b> handbreadths <b>is</b> the height of the <b>altar?</b> It is <b>fifty-eight</b> handbreadths high, as only eight of its cubits are of six handbreadths, while two cubits, those of the base and of the corners, are of five handbreadths. <b>How many</b> handbreadths <b>is</b> the height of <b>half of</b> the <b>altar?</b> It is <b>twenty-nine</b> handbreadths. <b>How many</b> handbreadths <b>is</b> the height <b>from</b> the top of the <b>corners</b> of the altar <b>until</b> the <b>surrounding ledge?</b> It is <b>twenty-three</b> handbreadths, as the corners of the altar are five handbreadths high, and the upper section of the altar is three cubits of six handbreadths.",
            "Therefore, <b>how many</b> handbreadths is the surrounding ledge <b>short of half</b> the height <b>of</b> the <b>altar?</b> It is <b>six</b> handbreadths above the halfway mark. <b>And</b> this correlates with that which <b>we learned</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: And <b>if</b> the priest <b>performed</b> the squeezing <b>below his feet, even</b> one <b>cubit</b> beneath the ledge, it is <b>valid.</b> According to this calculation, one cubit below the surrounding ledge is still part of the upper section of the altar.",
            "The Gemara adds that the language of the verse <b>is also precise.</b> The verse indicates that although it is referring to the height of the base, it is referring to the width of the surrounding ledge, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the base: <b>“The bottom shall be a cubit,”</b> whereas with regard to the ledge it is written: <b>“And the breadth a cubit.”</b> Since the verse mentions the breadth only with regard to the surrounding ledge one can infer that the previous term is referring not to the width but to the height. The Gemara concludes: One may <b>conclude from</b> the language of the verse that this is the correct interpretation.",
            "§ The Gemara (97a) cited a dispute between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda. According to Rabbi Meir all the cubits mentioned with regard to the Temple were medium cubits, except for the measurements of the golden altar, the corners of the external altar, its surrounding ledge, and its base. The Gemara asks: <b>And how many</b> handbreadths is <b>a medium cubit? Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is <b>six handbreadths. Rabbi Yosei bar Avin says: We learn</b> in a mishna (96a), <b>as well: Rabbi Meir says: The Table, its length is twelve</b> handbreadths <b>and its width is six</b> handbreadths. Since the Torah states that the length of the Table was two cubits and its width one cubit (see Exodus 25:23), this indicates that the cubit is six handbreadths.",
            "The Gemara asks: May one derive <b>from the fact</b> that the cubit of six handbreadths is referred to as a medium cubit <b>that there is a cubit that is larger than</b> the medium cubit? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> there is a larger cubit, <b>and</b> so <b>we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 17:9): <b>There were two</b> rods for measuring <b>cubits in</b> the chamber of <b>Shushan the capital,</b> which was located above the eastern gate of the Temple Mount, <b>one in the northeast corner and one in the southeast corner.</b> The one <b>that was in the northeast corner was longer than</b> the cubit used <b>by Moses</b> in the building of the Tabernacle, which was of six handbreadths, by <b>half a fingerbreadth,</b> and the one <b>that was in the southeast corner was longer than</b> the other one by another <b>half a fingerbreadth.</b> One therefore <b>finds it longer than Moses’</b> cubit by a full <b>fingerbreadth.</b>",
            "The mishna continues: <b>And why did</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that there should be two measures of a cubit, <b>one large and one small?</b> It was <b>so that the artisans</b> who were working in the Temple <b>would take</b> payment according the amount of work they did, as measured <b>by the small</b> cubit, <b>and return</b> it to the Temple through their work, as measured <b>by the large</b> cubit, <b>so they would not come to misuse consecrated property.</b> If they would accept any payment that they did not deserve, they would be misusing consecrated property.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And why do I</b> need <b>two</b> large cubits? The Gemara answers: <b>One,</b> the shorter of the two, was used <b>to</b> measure <b>silver and gold.</b> Since silver and gold were valuable, the difference between the two measurements was set at only half a fingerbreadth, so that the artisans would not suffer too great a loss. <b>And</b> the other <b>one,</b> which was longer than Moses’ cubit by a full fingerbreadth, was used <b>in</b> the <b>construction</b> of wood and stone structures.",
            "§ The Gemara discusses the depiction of Shushan the capital: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Middot</i> 1:3): One of the five gates of the Temple Mount was <b>the eastern gate upon</b> which <b>Shushan the capital</b> was <b>depicted.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that Shushan the capital was depicted on a gate of the Temple Mount?",
            "There is a dispute with regard to this matter between <b>Rav Ḥisda and Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi. One said</b> that Shushan was depicted <b>so that</b> those who passed through the gate <b>would know from where</b> it was that <b>they had come</b> back to Jerusalem. The Jews returned once Persia had conquered Babylonia, and therefore they should give thanks to the Persian Empire for releasing them from exile. <b>And one said</b> that it was depicted <b>so that the fear of</b> the Persian <b>Empire would be upon them,</b> to prevent them from rebelling.",
            "The Gemara continues to discuss giving a king his due: <b>Rabbi Yannai says:</b> The <b>fear of kingship should always be upon you,</b> even when the king does not deserve it, <b>as it is stated</b> that Moses said to Pharaoh, when he warned him about the forthcoming plague of the firstborn: <b>“And all these, your servants, shall come down to me, and bow down to me, saying:</b> Get out, you and all the people who follow you, and after that I will go out” (Exodus 11:8). Although ultimately Pharaoh would himself come to Moses, Moses mentioned only that Pharaoh’s servants would come to him, <b>whereas he did not say</b> this <b>to</b> Pharaoh <b>about</b> Pharaoh <b>himself,</b> because of giving a king his due.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> this principle may be derived <b>from here, as it is stated: “And the hand of the Lord was on Elijah, and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel”</b> (I Kings 18:46). Despite Ahab’s wickedness, Elijah acted in this manner out of respect for the king.",
            "§ The Gemara cites another dispute between Rav Ḥisda and Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi: With regard to the fruit trees that in the future will grow on either side of a river that will emerge from the Temple, the verse states: “And by the river upon its bank, on this side and on that side, shall grow every tree for food, whose leaf shall not wither, neither shall its fruit fail. It shall bring forth new fruit every month, because its waters issue out of the Sanctuary, and its fruit shall be for food, <b>and its leaf for healing [<i>litrufa</i>]”</b> (Ezekiel 47:12). The Gemara interprets the term “<i>litrufa</i>” as a contraction of <i>lehatir peh</i>, meaning: To unlock the mouth, and there is a dispute between <b>Rav Ḥisda and Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi</b> with regard to the meaning of this term.",
            "<b>One said</b> the leaf shall serve <b>to unlock</b> the <b>mouth that is above,</b> i.e., in the person’s head. The leaves will unlock the mouths of the mute and they will be capable of speech. <b>And one said</b> the leaf shall serve <b>to unlock</b> the <b>mouth that is below,</b> i.e., the womb, enabling barren women to give birth. <b>It was</b> likewise <b>stated</b> that <b>Ḥizkiyya says:</b> The leaf shall serve <b>to unlock</b> the <b>mouth of the mute,</b> whereas <b>bar Kappara says:</b> It shall serve <b>to unlock</b> the <b>mouth,</b> i.e., the womb, <b>of the barren</b> women.",

And you shall set them in two arrangements, six in an arrangement, upon the pure Table before the Lord” (Leviticus 24:5–6). <b>The Sages taught: Had</b> the Torah <b>stated: “And you shall take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes from it…And you shall set them in two arrangements,” but</b> had it <b>not stated</b> the continuation <b>“six</b> in an arrangement,” <b>I would have said</b> there may be <b>one</b> arrangement <b>of four</b> loaves <b>and one of eight</b> loaves, i.e., the arrangements do not have to be of equal size. <b>Therefore, it is stated: “Six</b> in an arrangement.”",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And had</b> the Torah <b>stated: “Two arrangements, six in an arrangement,” but</b> had it <b>not stated: “Twelve</b> cakes,” <b>I would have said</b> that the total number of loaves may be more than twelve, and the phrase “six in an arrangement” teaches that one may bring another arrangement of six loaves in addition to the two mentioned in the verse, so that there are <b>three</b> arrangements <b>of six</b> loaves <b>each.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Do you maintain</b> that the <b>Table of Moses resided together with</b> the other ten tables, i.e., parallel to them? It was <b>not</b> so. The Table of Moses was situated to the west of the other tables, in the space corresponding to the space between the two rows of tables, and its width should not be added to the width of the two rows of Solomon’s tables. All the tables were therefore situated in the north of the Sanctuary.

            "§ Having mentioned the principle that one does not downgrade in matters of sanctity, the Gemara cites a related issue. The verse states: “At that time the Lord said to me: Hew for yourself two tablets of stone like the first…And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, <b>which you broke, and you shall put them in the Ark”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:1–2). <b>Rav Yosef teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i>: This verse <b>teaches that</b> both <b>the tablets</b> of the Covenant <b>and</b> the <b>pieces of</b> the broken <b>tablets are placed in the Ark.</b> One should learn <b>from here that with regard to a Torah scholar who has forgotten his</b> Torah <b>knowledge due to</b> circumstances <b>beyond his control,</b> e.g., illness, <b>one may not behave toward him</b> in <b>a degrading manner.</b> Although the first tablets were broken it is prohibited to treat them with disrespect, due to their sanctity.

            "The Gemara notes <b>a mnemonic</b> for the following three statements of Reish Lakish, which are all related to the concept stated by Rav Yosef: One who <b>caused dereliction</b> of the study of Torah for the sake of a mitzva, a Torah scholar who <b>sinned, and</b> a Torah scholar who <b>forgot</b> his studies.",

The word “<i>asher</i>” is an allusion to the fact that that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Moses: Your strength is true [<i>yishar koḥakha</i>]</b> in <b>that you broke</b> the tablets, as the breaking of the first tablets led to the foundation of the Torah through the giving of the second tablets.",

Once the priests are permitted to partake of the offering it is no longer categorized as consecrated property.",
            "Rabbi Yehoshua clarifies: <b>And what is</b> a disqualified offering that had <b>a time</b> that it was <b>permitted for</b> consumption <b>by the priests?</b> Examples of such a situation are as follows: <b>When,</b> after the blood was sprinkled, the meat of the offering <b>was left overnight; or when</b> the meat of an offering <b>became ritually impure; or when</b> an offering <b>left</b> the Temple courtyard. One is not liable for misuse in these cases, since the meat of these offerings became permitted to the priests once the blood was sprinkled and only subsequently was it disqualified.",

For that reason it was not subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse of consecrated property.",
            "The Gemara again challenges Rav Ashi’s opinion: <b>But</b> according to this, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a case where the whole offering, including the blood, was <b>actually left overnight?</b> Is <b>that indeed</b> a case where one is liable for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property, as the priests never had a time when it was permitted to consume the meat?

They indicate that the critical factor is whether the meat had a time that it was potentially permitted, even if it was ultimately disqualified.",
            "Instead, the mishna <b>should have</b> stated: With regard to <b>any</b> offering <b>that has,</b> in actuality, <b>a time</b> that it is <b>permitted for</b> consumption <b>by the priests,</b> one is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misusing it.

            "It must be that Rav Ashi concedes that the mishna in <i>Me’ila</i> should be understood to include the case where both the blood and the meat were leftover, and that under such circumstances one is not liable for misuse of the offering due to the fact that once the blood could have been sprinkled, the offering is already considered permitted to the priests. Rav Ashi nevertheless claims that this mishna does not pose a difficulty to his understanding of Rabbi Shimon’s opinion with regard to an offering’s status as susceptible to the impurity of food. <b>Rather, Rav Ashi says: Are you raising a contradiction between</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property and the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>ritual impurity?</b>",
            "These cannot be compared, as liability for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property is <b>due to the sanctity or lack of sanctity</b> of an item, i.e., on whether it is classified as fully reserved for God. Therefore, <b>after the sanctity</b> of the offering <b>has lapsed,</b> which occurs when the blood is ready to be sprinkled, as at that point it is already regarded as permitted to the priests, <b>how</b> can it <b>return</b> and <b>be inured in it?</b>",
            "But with regard to <b>impurity,</b> the offering’s susceptibility to the impurity of food <b>is due to</b> whether it is considered <b>food or not</b> considered <b>food.</b> Therefore, in <b>any</b> case <b>where if</b> he <b>wants</b> to <b>sprinkle</b> the blood he <b>could sprinkle it,</b> it is only in sprinkling the blood that he <b>grants</b> the meat the status of <b>food, and</b> then it <b>is susceptible to the ritual impurity of food.</b> But in a case <b>where if</b> he <b>wants</b> to <b>sprinkle</b> the blood he <b>cannot sprinkle it</b> for some reason, and the offering is subsequently disqualified, he <b>does not grant it</b> the status of <b>food,</b> since it never became permitted to eat <b>and</b> it therefore <b>is not susceptible to the impurity of food.</b>",
            "The Gemara <b>raises</b> another <b>objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Karetot</i> 23b) to Rav Ashi’s opinion that with regard to susceptibility to the impurity of food, blood that is ready to be sprinkled is not considered as if it were sprinkled: With regard to <b>one who brings a provisional guilt offering</b> to be sacrificed, because he is uncertain as to whether he committed a sin that requires a sin offering (see Leviticus 5:17–19), <b>and</b> later <b>it becomes known</b> to him <b>that he has not sinned,</b> the status of the offering is as follows: <b>If it became known to him</b> that he had not sinned <b>before</b> the offering <b>was slaughtered,</b> the consecrated ram <b>should go out and graze in the flock</b> as a non-sacred animal, as the consecration was performed in error.

            "If <b>the blood was</b> already <b>sprinkled</b> on the altar when it became known to him that he had not sinned, <b>the meat</b> of the offering <b>is eaten</b> by the priests in the normal manner. <b>And Rabbi Yosei says: Even</b> if he discovered that he had not sinned while <b>the blood</b> was still <b>in the cup,</b> it is <b>sprinkled</b> on the altar <b>and the meat is eaten.</b>",

            "The Gemara responds: <b>When Reish Lakish raises the dilemma,</b> it is with regard to the status of the dry mass of the meal offering <b>by Torah law,</b> as consecrated items are burned only when rendered impure by Torah law. <b>When we said</b> that leftover meat and the meat of the red heifer are susceptible to the impurity of food, we were inquiring about the status of the leftover meat and of the red heifer <b>by rabbinic law,</b> and therefore nothing can be derived from the dilemma raised by Reish Lakish.",

As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nazir</i> 9a): If one says: <b>I am hereby a nazirite from dried figs and from</b> pressed <b>figs,</b> which is a contradictory statement, as figs are not prohibited to a nazirite, <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> He is a full-fledged <b>nazirite,</b> as one attends only to the first statement, i.e., I am hereby a nazirite, and the second part is discounted. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> The second part of his statement is not discounted, and therefore <b>he is not a nazirite,</b> as he did not accept naziriteship upon himself.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the mishna here is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel.</b> It is referring <b>to</b> one who, upon being informed that such a vow is not effective, <b>says: Had I known that</b> one <b>cannot vow</b> in <b>this</b> manner to bring barley for a meal offering, <b>I would not have vowed</b> in <b>this</b> manner <b>but rather</b> in <b>that</b> manner, by vowing to bring wheat instead.",
            "§ The Gemara cites another disagreement between Ḥizkiyya and Rabbi Yoḥanan about the mishna: <b>Ḥizkiyya says</b> that the Sages <b>taught</b> in the mishna <b>only</b> that <b>where he says:</b> It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a meal offering from barley,</b> he can bring a meal offering from wheat instead, <b>but</b> if he <b>says:</b> It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a meal offering from lentils,</b> the vow is <b>not</b> valid.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Now, Ḥizkiyya said</b> that <b>his tradition</b> of interpreting the mishna is that it is <b>in accordance with whose</b> opinion? It is <b>in accordance with Beit Shammai’s</b> opinion, <b>and Beit Shammai’s</b> ruling is <b>due to</b> the principle that one should <b>attend</b> only to <b>the first statement.</b> If so, <b>what</b> is the difference <b>to me</b> whether he vowed to bring a meal offering <b>from barley</b> or <b>from lentils?</b> In either case, that principle should require him to bring a meal offering from wheat. The Gemara answers: Ḥizkiyya <b>retracted his</b> initial explanation that the mishna is in accordance with Beit Shammai, and subscribes to the explanation of Rabbi Yoḥanan.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>he retracted</b> his explanation? <b>Rava said: The mishna</b> posed <b>a difficulty for him: Why does</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>specifically teach</b> this <i>halakha</i> using the example of <b>a meal offering from barley? Let it teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> using the example of a meal offering <b>from lentils,</b> which is a greater novelty.",
            "<b>Rather, learn from</b> it that the reason the vow takes effect <b>is because</b> one may <b>err.

But <b>with regard to lentils,</b> one would <b>not err</b> in thinking that one may bring a meal offering from them. Therefore, one can presume that by saying: Lentils, he intended to negate his initial statement.",

It is <b>because</b> the mishna <b>does not teach</b> using the example of one who vowed to bring a meal offering <b>from lentils,</b> which would have been a greater novelty.",
            "Rabbi Yoḥanan questions this reasoning: <b>Perhaps</b> the mishna <b>is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>It is not necessary.

The Gemara points out: With regard to <b>a meal offering,</b> it is <b>also written</b> in the plural: <b>“Your meal offerings [<i>leminḥoteikhem</i>].” Rather,</b> the reason that one may not bring a meal offering as a partnership is <b>because it is written:</b> “And when <b>an individual</b> brings a meal offering” (Leviticus 2:1), indicating that only one individual may offer it, but not two together.",

            "The Gemara relates to the problem that arises from this stipulation, as treating an offering as two different types of offerings due to a stipulation can cause a situation where an offering is unduly disqualified. In the case of an offering that is sacrificed as both a peace offering and a guilt offering, if its meat is not eaten by dawn of the following day, it is disqualified, even though it might be a peace offering, which can be eaten for another day.

            "The Gemara explains why here it would nevertheless be permitted to make the stipulation <i>ab initio</i>: Nevertheless, <b>this statement</b> that one may stipulate with regard to an offering only after the fact applies only <b>to a peace offering, as</b> sacrificing it as a guilt offering <b>reduces its</b> allotted time for <b>eating, which</b> may bring <b>sacrificial</b> meat <b>to the status of disqualification.

            "The Sages explained: <b>The Rabbis hold</b> by the principle: <b>Infer from it, and</b> again <b>from it.</b> The Gemara explains the application of this principle: <b>Just as a meal offering is contributed, so too oil is contributed,</b> as inferred from the verse addressing the meal offering. <b>And</b> again one infers <b>from</b> this source: <b>Just as a meal offering</b> requires <b>a <i>log</i></b> of oil, <b>so too here,</b> an offering of oil alone must be <b>a <i>log</i> of oil.</b>",

The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t you say in the first clause,</b> i.e., in the previous mishna (107b), that if one said: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a bull with</b> the value of <b>one hundred dinars</b> as a burnt offering or peace offering, <b>and he brought two</b> bulls <b>with</b> a combined value of <b>one hundred dinars,</b> he <b>has not fulfilled</b> his obligation? If so, why does the mishna here teach that one may bring two bulls with the redemption money of one bull?",
            "The Gemara answers that these two cases are not comparable. The previous mishna was referring to a case where one vowed to bring a bull worth one hundred dinars, without referring to a specific bull. Therefore, he is obligated to fulfill the specific conditions of his vow. By contrast, this mishna is referring to a case where one said: <b>This bull</b> is hereby a burnt offering, <b>and</b> therefore, if the bull <b>becomes blemished</b> and disqualified as an offering the <i>halakha</i> <b>is different.</b> Since he was only ever obligated to sacrifice this bull, and is no longer able to sacrifice it, he is no longer obligated by his vow, and may bring any number of offerings with its value.",
            "The mishna teaches that if one says: <b>These two bulls are</b> hereby <b>a burnt offering, and they became blemished,</b> if <b>he wishes he may bring with</b> the <b>money</b> of <b>their</b> redemption <b>one</b> bull. <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>deems</b> this <b>prohibited,</b> and holds that he must bring two bulls. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi deems it prohibited to bring only one bull?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Because it is</b> similar to a case where one vowed to bring <b>a large</b> bull <b>and he brought a small</b> bull, in which case he has not fulfilled his vow. Similarly, in this case, he vowed to bring two bulls and brought only one. <b>And although</b> he is not actually obligated to bring two bulls, as the bulls that he consecrated <b>became blemished</b> and he needs only to bring an offering with their redemption money, nevertheless <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>does not permit</b> bringing two bulls instead of one <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>let</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>disagree in the first clause</b> of the mishna <b>as well,</b> which states that if one consecrated a specific bull as a burnt offering and it subsequently became blemished, he may purchase two bulls with its redemption money. There, too, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi should prohibit bringing two bulls <i>ab initio</i>, as it is similar to a case where one vowed to bring a small bull and brought a large one, in which case Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi also holds that he has not fulfilled his obligation.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>disagrees with</b> this <b>entire matter,</b> both in the first and latter clauses of the mishna; <b>but he waited until the Rabbis had completed their statement, and then disagreed with them</b> with regard to both cases.",
            "<b>Know</b> that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi disagrees with the statement of the Rabbis in the first clause of the mishna as well, <b>as</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> that if one said: <b>This ram is</b> hereby <b>a burnt offering, and it became blemished,</b> if <b>he wishes he may bring a lamb with its</b> redemption <b>money.</b> In a case where one said: <b>This lamb is</b> hereby <b>a burnt offering, and it became blemished,</b> if <b>he wishes he may bring a ram with its</b> redemption <b>money. And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>deems</b> it <b>prohibited</b> for one to bring one type of animal with the redemption money of another type of animal, even if he wishes to bring a ram with the redemption money of a lamb. Evidently, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi disagrees with the Rabbis even in a case where one consecrated a small animal and wishes to bring a large animal with its redemption money. <b>Conclude from it</b> that he also disagrees in a case where one vowed to bring a certain animal which subsequently became blemished; the person may not bring two animals with the redemption money.",
            "§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: According to the Rabbis, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to one who wishes to use the redemption money <b>from</b> an animal of one <b>species</b> which became blemished <b>to</b> purchase a different <b>species</b> of animal? For example, if one vowed to bring a bull which subsequently became blemished, may he bring rams with its value instead?",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: If one said: <b>This bull is</b> hereby <b>a burnt offering, and it became blemished, he may not bring a ram with its</b> redemption <b>money,</b> as a ram is not worth as much as a bull. <b>But he may bring two rams with its</b> redemption <b>money,</b> if together they are equal in value to the bull. <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>deems</b> this <b>prohibited,</b> the reason being that one must bring two meal offerings to accompany his two rams. These meal offerings must be brought in two vessels, <b>because there is no mixing</b> permitted. Accordingly, bringing two offerings runs counter to the person’s vow, which involved bringing only one meal offering. <b>Conclude from</b> this <i>baraita</i> that according to the Rabbis it is permitted to use the redemption money from one species of animal to purchase a different species.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> if the Rabbis deem it permitted to bring a different species of animal, <b>why</b> does the <i>baraita</i> <b>specifically</b> state that one may bring <b>two</b> rams in place of a bull? The same <i>halakha</i> would apply <b>even</b> for <b>one</b> ram, <b>as</b> although one ram is smaller than one bull, <b>in</b> a case where the animal <b>became blemished, according to the Rabbis, there is no difference whether</b> one brings <b>a large</b> animal <b>or a small</b> animal. If one vowed to bring a ram he may bring a lamb instead, so why not a ram in place of a bull?",
            "The Gemara answers: There are <b>two <i>tanna’im</i>, and</b> they disagree <b>with regard to</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis.</b> The <i>tanna</i> of the mishna holds that the Rabbis deem it permitted to bring a small animal in place of a large animal that became blemished. The <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> holds that the Rabbis do not deem it permitted to bring a small animal in place of a large animal.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>deems</b> it <b>prohibited</b> to bring two rams with the redemption money of a bull, <b>because there is no mixing.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> that he deems it prohibited is <b>because there is no mixing. But</b> had there <b>been mixing,</b> then according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi it would be <b>permitted.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that if one said: <b>This ram is</b> hereby <b>a burnt offering, and it became blemished,</b> if <b>he wishes he may bring a lamb with its</b> redemption <b>money.</b> If one said: <b>This lamb is</b> hereby <b>a burnt offering, and it became blemished, he may bring a ram with its</b> redemption <b>money. And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>deems</b> it <b>prohibited</b> for one to bring one type of animal with the redemption money of another type of animal. Evidently, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi prohibits any kind of divergence from the animal that was consecrated, regardless of whether mixing is permitted.",
            "The Gemara answers: There are <b>two <i>tanna’im</i>, and</b> they disagree <b>with regard to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. The <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> holds that Rabbi Yehuda deems it prohibited to switch to a different type of animal only if it affects the accompanying meal offering, whereas the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna holds that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi deems any kind of change prohibited.",
            "The Gemara cites the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i>: All of the cases in the mishna and <i>baraita</i> are referring to a case where the animal became blemished; <b>and with regard to pure</b> animals, i.e., those that are not blemished, if one vowed to bring <b>a calf and brought a bull</b> instead, or he vowed to bring <b>a lamb and brought a ram</b> instead, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation. The Gemara explains that the <b>unattributed</b> last clause of the <i>baraita</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi would disagree in this case as well.",
            "§ The mishna teaches that if one vows to bring a certain bull as a burnt offering, and it became blemished, if <b>he wishes, he may bring two</b> bulls <b>with its</b> redemption <b>money. Rabbi Menashya bar Zevid says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case <b>where one said: This bull is</b> hereby <b>a burnt offering. But</b> if he <b>said: This bull</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring as <b>a burnt offering,</b> his responsibility for it in a case where it became blemished <b>is fixed,</b> and he must bring one bull with its redemption money, not two.",
            "The Gemara challenges Rav’s opinion: <b>But perhaps</b> when <b>he said:</b> This bull is incumbent upon me, he meant: It is incumbent <b>upon me to bring it</b> as an offering, but he did not intend to accept responsibility in case it becomes blemished.",
            "<b>Rather, if it was stated</b> that there is a case where one is responsible if the animal becomes blemished, <b>it was stated as follows: Rabbi Menashya bar Zevid says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case <b>where one said: This bull is</b> hereby <b>a burnt offering, or he said: This bull</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring as <b>a burnt offering. But</b> if <b>he said: This bull and its value</b> are incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring as <b>a burnt offering,</b> his responsibility for it in a case where it becomes blemished <b>is fixed,</b> and he must bring one bull with its redemption money, and not two.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who says: One of my lambs is consecrated, or: One of my bulls is consecrated, and he has two</b> lambs or bulls, <b>the larger of them is consecrated.</b> If he has <b>three</b> lambs or bulls, <b>the middle-sized</b> animal <b>among them is consecrated.</b> If one says: <b>I specified</b> the lamb or bull that is to be consecrated <b>but I do not know what</b> animal <b>I specified</b> in my vow, <b>or</b> he says <b>that: My father said to me</b> before his death that he consecrated one of the lambs or the bulls, <b>but I do not know what</b> animal he consecrated, <b>the largest of them is consecrated.</b>",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The first clause of the mishna teaches that if one says: One of my lambs is consecrated, and he has two lambs, the larger one is consecrated. The Gemara infers: <b>Apparently, one who consecrates, consecrates generously.</b> But <b>say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: If he has three lambs, <b>the middle-sized</b> animal <b>among them is consecrated. Apparently, one who consecrates, consecrates sparingly.</b> How can this contradiction be resolved?",
            "<b>Shmuel said:</b> The presumption is that one who consecrates, consecrates generously. When the latter clause of the mishna states that the middle-sized animal is consecrated, it does not mean that only the middle-sized animal is consecrated. Rather, the larger animal is consecrated, and additionally <b>we are concerned,</b> i.e., we must take in consideration the possibility, <b>that the</b> middle-sized animal is consecrated, as <b>compared to</b> consecrating <b>the small</b> animal, consecrating the middle-sized animal <b>is generous.</b> Therefore, the vow could have been referring to either the large animal or the middle-sized animal.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>How should he act?</b> He consecrated only one of them, and it is uncertain which animal should be sacrificed. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Rav said: He should wait until</b> the middle-sized animal <b>becomes blemished and</b> then <b>desacralize it</b> by transferring its sanctity <b>onto the large</b> animal, which is then sacrificed on the altar.",
            "§ The mishna teaches that if one had three lambs or bulls, the middle-sized animal is consecrated. <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that the middle-sized animal is consecrated <b>only when he said: One of my bulls is</b> hereby <b>consecrated. But</b> if <b>he said: A bull</b> from <b>among my bulls is</b> hereby <b>consecrated,</b> only <b>the largest of them is consecrated.</b> It is as if <b>he said: The</b> most valuable <b>bull</b> from <b>among my bulls [<i>tora betorai</i>]</b> is consecrated.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rav Huna say</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya said in the name of Ulla: One who says to another: I am selling you a house</b> from <b>among my houses, can show him an loft [<i>aliyya</i>],</b> since he did not specify which house he is selling? Is this <b>not because</b> the loft is the <b>worst</b> of his houses? If so, when one says: A bull from among my bulls is hereby consecrated, he is presumably referring to the least valuable of his bulls. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> Ulla did not say that the seller gives the purchaser a loft, but rather <b>the best [<i>me’ula</i>] of</b> his <b>houses.</b>",
            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the statement of Rabba bar Avuh from a <i>baraita</i>: If one said: <b>A bull</b> from <b>among my bulls is consecrated, or similarly</b> if <b>a consecrated bull became mixed with other</b> non-consecrated bulls, <b>the largest of them is consecrated, and all of the</b> other bulls <b>must be sold</b> to people who vowed to bring burnt offerings, <b>for the purpose of</b> bringing them as <b>burnt offerings,</b> since it is uncertain which one of them was consecrated, <b>and the payment for them is non-sacred.</b> Evidently, if one says: I hereby consecrate a bull from among my bulls, all of his bulls have uncertain consecrated status.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Interpret</b> this as referring only <b>to a consecrated bull that became mixed with others.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>But doesn’t</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>say: And similarly,</b> indicating that this <i>halakha</i> applies to both cases? The Gemara answers: <b>Interpret</b> it as referring <b>to</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>the largest</b> of the bulls is consecrated. That <i>halakha</i> does apply to both cases, but the <i>halakha</i> that the rest of the bulls have uncertain consecrated status applies only to the latter case.",
            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the statement of Rabba bar Avuh from a <i>baraita</i>: If one says to another: <b>I am selling you a house</b> from <b>among my houses, and</b> one of the houses subsequently <b>fell, he can show him</b> the <b>fallen</b> house, and say to him: This is the one I sold you. Similarly, if one says to another: <b>I sell you a slave</b> from <b>among my slaves, and</b> one of the slaves <b>dies, he can show him</b> the <b>dead</b> slave and say: This is the slave I sold you."
        ],
        [
            "<b>But</b> according to the opinion of Rabba bar Avuh, <b>why</b> can the seller automatically give the purchaser the fallen house or the dead slave? <b>Let him see which</b> house <b>fell,</b> or <b>which</b> slave <b>died,</b> as according to Rabba bar Avuh, the sale should apply to the house or slave that was the most valuable at the time of the sale.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Are you saying</b> that the statement of Rabba bar Avuh applies in the case of <b>a purchaser? A purchaser is different, as</b> there is a principle in the <i>halakhot</i> of commerce that in a case involving a dispute between the seller and the purchaser, <b>the owner of the document</b> of sale, i.e., the purchaser, <b>is at a disadvantage,</b> as a document is always interpreted as narrowly as possible. Therefore, the seller can claim that he has sold the buyer the fallen house or the dead slave.",
            "The Gemara adds: <b>Now that you have arrived at this</b> explanation, the objection posed earlier to the statement of Rabba bar Avuh from the statement of Ulla can be rejected easily. Ulla said that if one says to another: I am selling you a house from among my houses, since he did not specify which house he is selling, he can show him an attic [<i>aliyya</i>]. Although this was explained above as referring not to a loft but to the best [<i>me’ula</i>] of his houses, now <b>you</b> may <b>even say</b> that it is referring to <b>a loft, which is the worst</b> of his houses, due to the principle that <b>the owner of the document is at a disadvantage.</b>",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One who says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt offering, must sacrifice it in the Temple</b> in Jerusalem. <b>And if he sacrificed it in the temple of Onias</b> in Egypt, <b>he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. One who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt offering that I will sacrifice in the temple of Onias, must sacrifice it in the Temple</b> in Jerusalem, <b>but if he sacrificed it in the temple of Onias, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that if one says: It is incumbent upon me to bring a burnt offering that I will sacrifice in the temple of Onias, <b>it is not</b> consecrated as <b>a burnt offering;</b> such a statement does not consecrate the animal at all.",

If one says: <b>I am hereby a nazirite</b> provided <b>that I will shave in the temple of Onias, he must shave in the Temple</b> in Jerusalem; <b>but if he shaved in the temple of Onias, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that one who says: I am hereby a nazirite provided that I will shave in the temple of Onias, <b>is not a nazirite</b> at all, as his vow does not take effect.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that one who says: It is incumbent upon me to bring a burnt offering that I will sacrifice in the temple of Onias, and sacrifices it in the temple of Onias, has fulfilled his obligation. The Gemara asks: How has he <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation? By sacrificing it in the temple of Onias, <b>hasn’t he</b> merely <b>killed it</b> without sacrificing it properly?",
            "<b>Rav Hamnuna says:</b> The mishna does not mean that he has fulfilled his vow to bring an offering. Rather, <b>he is rendered like one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt offering on the condition that I will not be responsible for it</b> if I kill it beforehand. When the mishna says that he has fulfilled his obligation it simply means that if the animal he consecrated is no longer alive, he does not have to bring another animal in its place.",
            "<b>Rava said to</b> Rav Hamnuna: <b>If that is so,</b> what about <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna, <b>which teaches</b> that if one says: <b>I am hereby a nazirite</b> provided <b>that I will shave in the temple of Onias, he must shave in the Temple</b> in Jerusalem, <b>but if he shaved in the temple of Onias, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation? In this case do you <b>also</b> maintain <b>that he is rendered like one who says: I am hereby a nazirite on the condition that I will not be responsible for</b> bringing <b>its offerings</b> if I kill them beforehand? Such a condition cannot exempt <b>a nazirite</b> from bringing his offerings, because <b>as long as he does not bring his offerings, he is not fit</b> to conclude his term of naziriteship and is still bound by all of the restrictions of a nazirite.",
            "<b>Rather, Rava said</b> there is a different explanation: The animal was never consecrated at all, as <b>this person intended</b> merely <b>to</b> bring the animal as <b>a gift [<i>doron</i>],</b> but not to consecrate it as an offering. He presumably lives closer to the temple of Onias than to the Temple in Jerusalem, and must have <b>said</b> to himself: <b>If it is sufficient</b> to sacrifice this animal <b>in the temple of Onias, I</b> am prepared to <b>exert</b> myself and bring it. But if it is necessary to do <b>more</b> than that, i.e., to bring it to Jerusalem, <b>I am not able to afflict myself.</b> The mishna teaches that although the person never intended to bring the offering to Jerusalem, ideally, he should sacrifice the animal properly, in the Temple in Jerusalem. If he did not bring it there, but sacrificed it in the temple of Onias, he has fulfilled his obligation, and is not required to bring any other offering in its place.",
            "This is the explanation of the latter clause of the mishna <b>as well:</b> If one said that he would be <b>a nazirite</b> provided that he will shave in the temple of Onias, <b>this man</b> did not intend to accept upon himself the halakhic status of naziriteship. Rather, he merely <b>intends to practice abstinence</b> by not drinking wine, along with observing the other restrictions of a nazirite. Therefore, <b>he said</b> to himself: <b>If it is sufficient</b> to shave <b>in the temple of Onias, I</b> am prepared to <b>exert</b> myself and do so. But if it is necessary to do <b>more</b> than that, i.e., to go to Jerusalem to shave and bring the required offerings, <b>I am not able to afflict myself.</b> The mishna teaches that ideally, he should go to the Temple in Jerusalem to shave and bring all his offerings. If he shaved and brought his offerings in the temple of Onias, he has fulfilled his vow and has no further obligation.",
            "<b>And Rav Hamnuna</b> could have <b>said to you</b> in response to Rava’s challenge: With regard to the case of one who vowed to become <b>a nazirite</b> on the condition that he would shave and bring his offerings in the temple of Onias, the interpretation of the mishna is <b>as you said.</b> But with regard to one who vows to bring <b>a burnt offering</b> in the temple of Onias, his intent is as I explained, and it is as if <b>he says:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt offering on the condition that I will not be responsible for it</b> if I kill it beforehand.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan also</b> holds in accordance with <b>that which Rav Hamnuna</b> said, <b>as Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that if one says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt offering</b> on the condition <b>that I will sacrifice it in the temple of Onias, and he sacrificed it in Eretz Yisrael</b> but not in the Temple, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation, <b>but</b> his actions <b>are</b> also <b>punishable by excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>]</b> because he sacrificed an offering outside of the Temple. This is in accordance with the opinion of Rav Hamnuna that the animal is consecrated.",
            "<b>This</b> explanation of Rav Hamnuna and Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt offering</b> on the condition <b>that I will sacrifice it in the wilderness</b> of Sinai, thinking that the wilderness of Sinai still has sanctity since the Tabernacle had been located there, <b>and he sacrificed it on</b> the east <b>bank of the Jordan, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation, <b>but</b> his actions <b>are</b> also <b>punishable by <i>karet</i></b> because he sacrificed an offering outside of the Temple.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The priests who served in the temple of Onias may not serve in the Temple in Jerusalem; and needless to say,</b> if they served <b>for something else,</b> a euphemism for idolatry, they are disqualified from service in the Temple. <b>As it is stated: “Nevertheless the priests of the private altars did not come up to the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem, but they did eat <i>matza</i> among their brethren”</b> (II Kings 23:9). The halakhic status of <b>these</b> priests is <b>like</b> that of <b>blemished</b> priests in that <b>they receive a share</b> in the distribution of the meat of the offerings <b>and partake</b> of that meat, <b>but they do not sacrifice</b> offerings or perform any of the sacrificial rites.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>a priest who slaughtered</b> an offering <b>for idol worship</b> and who subsequently repented and came to the Temple in Jerusalem to serve, <b>his offering is</b> acceptable and considered to be <b>an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord.",
            "<b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi says: What is the verse</b> from which it is derived? The verse states: <b>“Because they served them before their idols and became a stumbling block of iniquity unto the house of Israel, therefore I have lifted up My hand against them, says the Lord God, and they shall bear their iniquity”</b> (Ezekiel 44:12). <b>And it is written afterward: “And they shall not come near to Me, to serve Me in the priestly role”</b> (Ezekiel 44:13). This indicates that <b>if</b> a priest <b>performed a service</b> for an idol that is considered a sacrificial rite in the Temple, he <b>is</b> disqualified from serving in the Temple, but the <b>slaughter</b> of an offering <b>is not</b> considered <b>service,</b> as it is not considered a sacrificial rite in the Temple and can be performed in the Temple even by a non-priest.",
            "<b>It was stated:</b> If a priest <b>unwittingly</b> performed the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood of an idolatrous offering and then repented and came to serve in the Temple, <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>his offering</b> is accepted and <b>is an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord. <b>Rav Sheshet says: His offering is not a pleasing aroma</b> to the Lord, as he is not fit to serve in the Temple.",
            "<b>Rav Sheshet said: From where do I say</b> that if a priest sprinkled blood unwittingly for idol worship he cannot serve in the Temple? <b>As it is written: “And they became a stumbling block of iniquity unto the house of Israel.” What, is it not</b> referring to one who served in idol worship <b>either</b> as <b>a stumbling block or</b> as <b>an iniquity?</b> Accordingly, neither may perform the service in the Temple. <b>And</b> the term <b>“stumbling block”</b> is a reference to one who sins <b>unwittingly, and</b> the term <b>“iniquity”</b> is a reference to <b>an intentional</b> sinner. Therefore, even one who unwittingly served in idol worship may not subsequently serve in the Temple.",
            "<b>And Rav Naḥman</b> interprets the verse to mean <b>a stumbling block of iniquity,</b> i.e., only one who serves in idol worship intentionally is disqualified from serving in the Temple, but not one who serves in idol worship unwittingly.",
            "<b>Rav Naḥman said: From where do I say</b> that if a priest sprinkled the blood of an idolatrous offering unwittingly his subsequent offering in the Temple is accepted? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to one who unwittingly committed idolatry: “And if one person sin through error, then he shall offer a she-goat in its first year for a sin offering. <b>And the priest shall effect atonement for the soul that errs unwittingly, when he sins unwittingly,</b> before the Lord, to effect atonement for him; and he shall be forgiven” (Numbers 15:27–28). The phrase: “For the soul that errs unwittingly” <b>teaches that a priest</b> who sins unwittingly <b>may receive atonement</b> by sacrificing his sin offering <b>on his own.</b>",
            "Rav Naḥman clarifies: <b>In what</b> manner did this priest commit idolatry? <b>If we say</b> he sinned <b>through slaughtering</b> an idolatrous offering, <b>why</b> does the verse indicate <b>specifically</b> that a priest who slaughtered an idolatrous offering <b>unwittingly</b> can bring his own sin offering? This is obvious, as <b>even</b> one who did so <b>intentionally</b> may serve in the Temple after repentance. <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to a priest who committed idolatry <b>by sprinkling</b> the blood of an idolatrous offering? Accordingly, if he did so unwittingly his subsequent service in the Temple is valid, but if he did so intentionally, he is disqualified from serving in the Temple.",
            "<b>And</b> how does <b>Rav Sheshet</b> interpret that <i>baraita</i>? He could have <b>said to you: Actually,</b> the verse is referring to a case <b>where</b> the priest sinned <b>through slaughtering</b> an idolatrous offering. <b>And</b> although Rav Yehuda said that a priest who slaughtered an idolatrous offering may serve in the Temple after repentance, that statement applies only to one who slaughtered an idolatrous offering unwittingly. But if he did so <b>intentionally,</b> the priest is disqualified from serving in the Temple. Rav Yehuda’s reasoning is that slaughter is not a sacrificial rite in the Temple; but <b>does</b> one who slaughters an idolatrous offering intentionally <b>not become a servant of idol worship?</b>",
            "<b>And</b> Rav Naḥman and Rav Sheshet <b>follow their</b> respective lines of <b>reasoning, as it was stated</b> that if a priest acted <b>intentionally in</b> the <b>slaughter</b> of an idolatrous offering and subsequently repented, <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>his offering</b> in the Temple <b>is an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord, i.e., it is not disqualified, <b>and Rav Sheshet says</b> that <b>his offering</b> in the Temple <b>is not an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord, i.e., it is disqualified.",
            "<b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>his offering is an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord, <b>because he did not perform service</b> for an idol that is considered a sacrificial rite in the Temple. And <b>Rav Sheshet says</b> that <b>his offering is not an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord,"

            "as by slaughtering the idolatrous offering intentionally <b>he became a servant of idol worship.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Naḥman said: From where do I say</b> that even a priest who intentionally slaughters an idolatrous offering is nevertheless fit to serve in the Temple if he repents? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a priest who served</b> in <b>idol worship and repented, his offering</b> in the Temple <b>is an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord and is acceptable.",
            "Rav Naḥman clarifies: <b>In what</b> manner did he serve in idol worship? <b>If we say</b> that he served in idol worship <b>unwittingly, what</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mean when it says: <b>And repented? He is already repentant,</b> as he never intended to sin in the first place. <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>of intentional</b> idol worship. <b>And if</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to sprinkling</b> the blood of an idolatrous offering, <b>when he repents, what of it? Hasn’t he performed</b> idolatrous <b>service,</b> thereby disqualifying himself from serving in the Temple in any event? <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring <b>to</b> the <b>slaughter</b> of an idolatrous offering? Evidently, even if the priest slaughtered it intentionally, once he repents he is fit to serve in the Temple.",
            "<b>And</b> as for <b>Rav Sheshet, he</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that <b>actually</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to unwitting</b> slaughter. <b>And this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: If</b> the priest <b>is repentant from the outset, as when he served</b> in idol worship <b>he served unwittingly,</b> then <b>his offering is an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord and is acceptable. <b>But if not,</b> i.e., he slaughtered an idolatrous offering intentionally, <b>his</b> subsequent <b>offering</b> in the Temple is <b>not an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord.",
            "§ The Gemara lists other similar disagreements between Rav Naḥman and Rav Sheshet. In a case where a priest <b>bowed to</b> an object of <b>idol worship, Rav Naḥman says:</b> If he subsequently repents and serves in the Temple, <b>his offering is an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord. <b>And Rav Sheshet says: His offering is not an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord. In a case where a priest <b>acknowledges</b> an object of <b>idol worship</b> as a divinity, <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> If he subsequently repents and serves in the Temple, <b>his offering is an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord. <b>And Rav Sheshet says: His offering is not an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord.",
            "Having listed four similar disputes between Rav Naḥman and Rav Sheshet, namely, with regard to a priest who unwittingly sprinkled the blood of an idolatrous offering, a priest who intentionally slaughtered an idolatrous offering, a priest who bowed to an idol, and a priest who acknowledged an idol as a divinity, the Gemara explains: <b>And</b> it was <b>necessary</b> to teach the dispute with regard to all four cases. <b>As, had</b> the Sages <b>taught us</b> only <b>this first</b> case, where a priest sprinkles the blood of an idolatrous offering unwittingly, one might have thought that only <b>in that</b> case <b>Rav Sheshet says</b> that the priest’s subsequent service in the Temple is disqualified, <b>because he performed a service for</b> idolatry that is considered a sacrificial rite in the Temple. <b>But</b> in a case where the priest merely performed <b>slaughter, since he did not perform a service for</b> idolatry that is a sacrificial rite in the Temple, there is room to <b>say</b> that Rav Sheshet <b>concedes to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman.</b>",
            "<b>And had</b> the Sages <b>taught us</b> only the dispute with regard to a priest intentionally performing <b>slaughter</b> for an idolatrous offering, one might have thought that Rav Sheshet says that the priest’s subsequent service in the Temple is disqualified <b>because he performed</b> a sacrificial <b>rite for</b> idolatry. <b>But</b> if he merely <b>bowed</b> to the idol, <b>since he did not perform</b> a sacrificial <b>rite for</b> idolatry, there is room to <b>say</b> that Rav Sheshet does <b>not</b> disqualify the priest’s subsequent service in the Temple. Therefore, it was <b>necessary</b> to teach this case as well.",
            "<b>And had</b> the Sages <b>taught us</b> only the case of a priest <b>bowing</b> to an idol, one might have thought that in this case Rav Sheshet says that the priest’s subsequent service in the Temple is disqualified <b>because he performed an action for</b> idolatry. <b>But</b> if he only <b>acknowledged</b> the idol as a divinity, <b>which is mere speech,</b> there is room to <b>say</b> that Rav Sheshet does <b>not</b> disqualify the priest’s subsequent service in the Temple. The Gemara concludes: Therefore, it was <b>necessary</b> to teach this case as well.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: <b>And needless to say,</b> if priests served for <b>something else,</b> a euphemism for idolatry, they are disqualified from service in the Temple. The Gemara comments: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that it says: Needless to say,</b> if they served for <b>something else, by inference, the temple of Onias is not</b> a temple of <b>idol worship,</b> but rather a temple devoted to the worship of God.",
            "<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>like the one who says</b> that <b>the temple of Onias is not</b> a temple of <b>idol worship. As it is taught:</b> During <b>the year in which Shimon HaTzaddik died, he said to</b> his associates: <b>This year, he will die,</b> euphemistically referring to himself. <b>They said to him: From where do you know?</b>",
            "Shimon HaTzaddik <b>said to them:</b> In previous years, <b>every Yom Kippur,</b> upon entering the Holy of Holies, I had a prophetic vision in which <b>I would be met by an old man</b> who was <b>dressed in white, and</b> his head was <b>wrapped in white, and he would enter</b> the Holy of Holies <b>with me, and he would leave with me.</b> But <b>this year, I was met by an old man</b> who was <b>dressed in black, and</b> his head was <b>wrapped in black, and he entered</b> the Holy of Holies <b>with me, but he did not leave with me.</b> Shimon HaTzaddik understood this to be a sign that his death was impending.",
            "Indeed, <b>after the pilgrimage festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>he was ill for seven days and died. And his fellow priests refrained from reciting the</b> Priestly <b>Benediction with the</b> ineffable <b>name</b> of God.",
            "<b>At the time of his death, he said to</b> the Sages: <b>Onias, my son, will serve</b> as High Priest <b>in my stead. Shimi,</b> Onias’ <b>brother, became jealous</b> of him, <b>as</b> Shimi <b>was two and a half years older than</b> Onias. Shimi <b>said to</b> Onias treacherously: <b>Come and I will teach you the order of the service</b> of the High Priest. Shimi <b>dressed</b> Onias <b>in a tunic [<i>be’unkeli</i>] and girded him with a ribbon [<i>betziltzul</i>]</b> as a belt, i.e., not in the vestments of the High Priest, and <b>stood him next to the altar.</b> Shimi <b>said to his fellow priests: Look what this</b> man <b>vowed and fulfilled for his beloved,</b> that he had said to her: <b>On the day that I serve in the High Priesthood I will wear your tunic and gird your ribbon.</b>",
            "<b>The fellow priests of</b> Onias <b>wanted to kill him</b> because he had disgraced the Temple service with his garments. Onias <b>ran</b> away <b>from them and they ran after him. He went to Alexandria in Egypt and built an altar there, and sacrificed</b> offerings <b>upon it for the sake of idol worship. When the Sages heard of the matter they said: If this</b> person, Shimi, <b>who did not enter</b> the position of High Priest, acted with <b>such</b> jealousy, <b>all the more so</b> will <b>one who enters</b> a prestigious position rebel if that position is taken away from him. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> According to Rabbi Meir, the temple of Onias was built for idol worship.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yehuda said to him:</b> The <b>incident was not like this. Rather, Onias did not accept</b> the position of High Priest <b>because his brother Shimi was two and a half years older than him,</b> so Shimi was appointed as High Priest. <b>And even so,</b> even though Onias himself offered the position to Shimi, <b>Onias was jealous of his brother Shimi.</b> Onias <b>said to</b> Shimi: <b>Come and I will teach you the order of the service</b> of the High Priest. <b>And</b> Onias <b>dressed</b> Shimi <b>in a tunic and girded him in a ribbon and stood him next to the altar.</b> Onias <b>said to his fellow priests: Look what this</b> man, Shimi, <b>vowed and fulfilled for his beloved,</b> that he had said to her: <b>On the day that I serve in the High Priesthood I will wear your tunic and gird your ribbon.</b>",
            "<b>His fellow priests wanted to kill</b> Shimi. Shimi then <b>told them the entire incident,</b> that he had been tricked by his brother Onias, so the priests <b>wanted to kill Onias.</b> Onias <b>ran</b> away <b>from them, and they ran after him.</b> Onias <b>ran to the palace of the king, and they ran after him. Anyone who saw him would say: This is him, this is him,</b> and he was not able to escape unnoticed. Onias <b>went to Alexandria in Egypt and built an altar there, and sacrificed</b> offerings <b>upon it for the sake of Heaven. As it is stated: “In that day shall there be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at its border, to the Lord”</b> (Isaiah 19:19). According to Rabbi Yehuda, the temple of Onias was dedicated to the worship of God.",
            "<b>And when the Sages heard of the matter they said: If this one,</b> Onias, <b>who fled from</b> the position of High Priest and offered it to his brother, still was overcome with <b>such</b> jealousy to the point where he tried to have Shimi killed, <b>all the more so</b> will <b>one who wants to enter</b> a prestigious position be jealous of the one who already has that position.",
            "§ As a corollary to the statement of the Sages with regard to one who is jealous and wants the position of another, <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Peraḥya said: Initially,</b> in response to <b>anyone who would say</b> to me: <b>Ascend to</b> the position of <i>Nasi</i>, <b>I would tie him up and place him in front of a lion</b> out of anger for his suggestion. <b>Now</b> that I have become the <i>Nasi</i>, in response to <b>anyone who tells me to leave</b> the position, <b>I</b> would <b>throw a kettle [<i>kumkum</i>] of boiling</b> water <b>at him</b> out of anger at his suggestion.",
            "It is human nature that after one ascends to a prestigious position he does not wish to lose it. <b>As</b> evidence of this principle, <b>Saul</b> initially <b>fled from</b> the kingship, as he did not wish to be king, as stated in the verse: “When they sought him he could not be found…Behold he has hidden himself among the baggage” (I Samuel 10:21–22). <b>But when he ascended</b> to the kingship <b>he tried to kill David,</b> who he thought was trying to usurp his authority (see I Samuel, chapters 18–27).",
            "§ <b>Mar Kashisha, son of Rav Ḥisda, said to Abaye: What does Rabbi Meir do with this verse of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> Since Rabbi Meir holds that the temple of Onias was dedicated to idol worship, how does he explain the verse in Isaiah?",
            "Abaye answered Mar Kashisha and said that Rabbi Meir uses this verse <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>After the downfall of Sennacherib,</b> the king of Assyria who besieged Jerusalem (see II Kings, chapters 18–19), King <b>Hezekiah emerged</b> from Jerusalem <b>and found the</b> gentile <b>princes</b> Sennacherib had brought with him from his other conquests, <b>sitting in carriages [<i>bikronot</i>] of gold. He made them vow that they would not worship idols,</b> and they fulfilled their vow, <b>as it is stated</b> in Isaiah’s prophecy about Egypt: <b>“In that day there shall be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>and swear to the Lord of hosts;</b> one shall be called the city of destruction” (Isaiah 19:18). <b>They went to Alexandria in Egypt and built an altar and sacrificed</b> offerings <b>upon it for the sake of Heaven, as it is stated</b> in the following verse: <b>“In that day shall there be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt,</b> and a pillar at its border, to the Lord” (Isaiah 19:19).",
            "The verse states: <b>“One shall be called the city of destruction”</b> (Isaiah 19:18). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the verse: <b>“One shall be called the city of destruction”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As Rav Yosef translates</b> into Aramaic: Concerning <b>the City of the Sun, which will be destroyed in the future, it will be said that it is one of them. And from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> in the phrase: <b>“The city of destruction [<i>heres</i>],” the term</b> <i>heres</i> <b>is</b> referring <b>to the sun? As it is written: “Who commands the sun [<i>ḥeres</i>], and it does not rise;</b> and seals up the stars” (Job 9:7).",
            "§ After mentioning the Jewish community in Egypt, the Gemara discusses Jewish communities in other locations. The verse states: “Fear not, for I am with you; I will bring your seed from the east and gather you from the west; I will say to the north: Give up, and to the south: Keep not back, <b>bring My sons from far, and My daughters from the end of the earth”</b> (Isaiah 43:5–6). What is the meaning of <b>“bring My sons from far”? Rav Huna says: These are the exiles of Babylonia, whose minds are calm, like sons,</b> and who can therefore focus properly on Torah study and mitzvot. What is the meaning of <b>“and My daughters from the end of the earth”? These are the exiles of other countries, whose minds are unsettled, like daughters.</b>",
            "§ <b>Rabbi Abba bar Rav Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda says, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The gentiles living <b>from Tyre to Carthage recognize the Jewish people,</b> their religion, <b>and their Father in Heaven. But</b> those living <b>to the west of Tyre and to the east of Carthage recognize neither the Jewish people nor their Father in Heaven.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Shimi bar Ḥiyya raised an objection to</b> the statement of <b>Rav</b> from the verse: <b>“From the rising of the sun until it sets, My name is great among the nations; and in every place offerings are presented to My name, and a pure meal offering;</b> for My name is great among the nations, says the Lord of hosts” (Malachi 1:11). This indicates that God’s name is known across the entire world, even to the west of Tyre and the east of Carthage. Rav <b>said to him: Shimi,</b> is it <b>you</b> who is raising such an objection? The verse does not mean that they recognize God and worship him. Rather, it means <b>that</b> although they worship idols, <b>they call Him the God of gods.</b>",
            "§ The verse states: “And <b>in every place offerings are presented to My name,</b> and a pure meal offering; for My name is great among the nations, says the Lord of hosts.” Does it <b>enter your mind</b> to say that it is permitted to sacrifice offerings <b>in every place?</b> Rather, <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: These are Torah scholars, who engage in Torah</b> study <b>in every place.</b> God says: <b>I ascribe them</b> credit <b>as though they burn and present</b> offerings <b>to My name.</b>",
            "Furthermore, when the verse states: <b>“And a pure meal offering,” this</b> is referring to <b>one who studies Torah in purity,</b> i.e., one who first <b>marries a woman and afterward studies Torah.</b> Since he is married, he is not disturbed by sinful thoughts.",
            "The Gemara cites another verse that praises Torah scholars. <b>“A Song of Ascents, Behold, bless the Lord, all you servants of the Lord, who stand in the House of the Lord at night”</b> (Psalms 134:1). <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>“at night,”</b> given that the Temple service is not performed at night and all the offerings must be sacrificed during the daytime? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: These are Torah scholars, who engage in Torah</b> study <b>at night. The verse ascribes them</b> credit <b>as though they engage in the</b> Temple <b>service.</b>",
            "§ The Gemara cites another verse that is interpreted in a similar vein. King Solomon said to Hiram of Tyre: “Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of the Lord my God, to dedicate it to Him, and to burn before Him incense of sweet spices, and for the continual shewbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the <i>Shabbatot</i>, and on the New Moons, and on the Festivals of the Lord our God. <b>This is an ordinance forever for Israel”</b> (II Chronicles 2:3). Since the Temple was eventually destroyed, what did Solomon mean when he said that it is “an ordinance forever”? <b>Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says: This</b> is referring to the <b>altar</b> that remains <b>built</b> in Heaven even after the earthly Temple was destroyed, <b>and</b> the angel <b>Michael, the great minister, stands and sacrifices an offering upon it.</b>",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that there is an alternative explanation of the verse: <b>These are Torah scholars, who engage in</b> studying <b>the <i>halakhot</i> of</b> the Temple <b>service. The verse ascribes them</b> credit <b>as though the Temple was built in their days</b> and they are serving in it.",
            "§ The Gemara cites similar interpretations of verses: <b>Reish Lakish said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “This is the law [<i>torah</i>] of the burnt offering, of the meal offering, and of the sin offering, and of the guilt offering,</b> and of the consecration offering, and of the sacrifice of peace offerings” (Leviticus 7:37)? This teaches that <b>anyone who engages in Torah</b> study is considered <b>as though he sacrificed a burnt offering, a meal offering, a sin offering, and a guilt offering.</b>",
            "<b>Rava said</b> an objection to this interpretation: <b>This</b> verse states: <b>“Of the burnt offering, of the meal offering.”</b> If the interpretation of Reish Lakish is correct, the verse <b>should have</b> written: <b>“Burnt offering and meal offering.” Rather, Rava says</b> that the correct interpretation of this verse is: <b>Anyone who engages in Torah</b> study <b>need not</b> bring <b>a burnt offering, nor a sin offering, nor a meal offering, nor a guilt offering.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “This is the law of the sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:18), <b>and: “This is the law of the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:1)? These verses teach that <b>anyone who engages in</b> studying <b>the law of the sin offering</b> is ascribed credit <b>as though he sacrificed a sin offering, and anyone who engages in</b> studying <b>the law of a guilt offering</b> is ascribed credit <b>as though he sacrificed a guilt offering.</b>",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>It is stated with regard to an animal burnt offering: “A fire offering, an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 1:9), <b>and with regard to a bird burnt offering: “A fire offering, an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 1:17), <b>and with regard to a meal offering: “A fire offering, an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 2:2). The repetitive language employed concerning all of these different offerings is <b>to say to you</b> that <b>one who brings a substantial</b> offering <b>and one who brings a meager</b> offering have equal merit, <b>provided that he directs his heart toward Heaven.</b>",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Zeira said: What is the verse</b> from which this principle is derived? <b>“Sweet is the sleep of a laboring man, whether he consumes little or much”</b>(Ecclesiastes 5:11).The verse is interpreted as referring to one who brings an offering, and teaches that one who brings a substantial offering and one who brings a meager offering can be equally assured that their offering will be accepted.",
            "<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said</b> that the source is <b>from here: “When goods increase, those who consume them increase; and what advantage is there to the owner,</b> except seeing them with his eyes?” (Ecclesiastes 5:10). One who brings a substantial offering, who thereby increases the number of priests who partake of it, does not have more merit than one who brings a meager offering. Rather, the offering that God desires is one where He recognizes, i.e., “seeing them with His eyes,” that its owner has the proper intent.",
            "The Gemara addresses the expression “an aroma pleasing to the Lord” stated in the verses mentioned in the mishna. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Azzai says: Come and see what is written in the portion of offerings: As</b> in these verses, the divine names <b><i>El</i> and <i>Elohim</i> are not stated, but</b> only <b>“the Lord.”</b> This is <b>so</b> as <b>not to give a claim to a litigant to argue.</b> Only one name of God is used in conjunction with all the various offerings, to prevent heretics from claiming that different offerings are brought to different gods.",
            "<b>And it is stated with regard to a large bull</b> offering: <b>“A fire offering, an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 1:9), <b>and with regard to a small bird</b> offering: <b>“A fire offering, an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 1:17), <b>and with regard to a meal offering: “A fire offering, an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 1:9). The repetitive language employed concerning all of these different offerings is <b>to say to you</b> that <b>one who brings a substantial</b> offering <b>and one who brings a meager</b> offering have equal merit, <b>provided that he directs his heart toward Heaven.</b>",
            "<b>And lest you say</b> that God <b>needs</b> these offerings <b>for consumption,</b> in which case a larger offering would be preferable to a smaller one, <b>the verse states: “If I were hungry, I would not tell you; for the world is Mine, and everything within it”</b> (Psalms 50:12). <b>And it is stated: “For every beast of the forest is Mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills.

Similarly, it is stated in the following verse: <b>“Do I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?”</b> (Psalms 50:13).",
            "<b>I did not say to you: Sacrifice</b> offerings to me, <b>so that you will say: I will do His will,</b> i.e., fulfill His needs, <b>and He will do my will. You are not sacrificing to</b> fulfill <b>My will,</b> i.e., My needs, <b>but you are sacrificing to</b> fulfill <b>your will,</b> i.e., your needs, in order to achieve atonement for your sins by observing My mitzvot, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And when you sacrifice an offering of peace offerings to the Lord, <b>you shall sacrifice it so that you may be accepted”</b> (Leviticus 19:5).",
            "<b>Alternatively,</b> the verse: “And when you sacrifice an offering of peace offerings to the Lord, <b>you shall sacrifice it so that you may be accepted [<i>lirtzonkhem</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 19:5), can be interpreted differently: <b>Sacrifice willingly [<i>lirtzonkhem</i>]; sacrifice intentionally.</b>",
            "This is <b>as Shmuel asked Rav Huna: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to one who acts unawares</b> in the case <b>of consecrated</b> items, i.e., if one slaughtered an offering without intending to perform the act of slaughter at all, but rather appeared like one occupied with other matters, <b>that</b> the offering <b>is disqualified?</b> Rav Huna said to Shmuel: It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “And he shall slaughter the young bull</b> before the Lord” (Leviticus 1:5), teaching that the mitzva is not performed properly <b>unless the slaughter is for the sake of a young bull,</b> i.e., with the knowledge that he is performing an act of slaughter.",
            "Shmuel <b>said to</b> Rav Huna: <b>We have this</b> as an established <i>halakha</i> already, that it is a mitzva to slaughter the offering for the sake of a bull, but <b>from where</b> is it derived that this requirement is <b>indispensable?</b> Rav Huna <b>said to him</b> that the verse states: <b>“With your will you shall slaughter it”</b> (Leviticus 19:5), i.e., <b>sacrifice intentionally,</b> in the form of a purposeful action.",
