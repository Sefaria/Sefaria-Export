            "THE PRIESTLY NOVITIATES USED TO PLACE EACH ONE HIS PILLOW ON THE GROUND.  THEY DID NOT SLEEP IN THEIR SACRED GARMENTS, BUT THEY USED TO TAKE THEM OFF [AND FOLD THEM] AND PLACE THEM UNDER THEIR HEADS AND COVER THEMSELVES WITH THEIR OWN ORDINARY CLOTHES.  IF AN ACCIDENT HAPPENED TO ONE OF THEM, HE USED TO GO OUT AND TAKE HIS WAY"
