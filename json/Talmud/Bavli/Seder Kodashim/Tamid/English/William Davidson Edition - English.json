            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The priests</b> would <b>keep watch in three places in the Temple</b> courtyard, in honor of the Temple, like guards in royal courtyards: <b>In the Chamber of Avtinas,</b> which is the Chamber where the incense was prepared, <b>and</b> on the two sides of the northern section of the courtyard: <b>In the Chamber of the Spark,</b> where there was a small, perpetual fire, from which the fire of the altar would be lit if it went out; <b>and in the Chamber of the Hearth,</b> where there was also a fire, by which the priests would warm themselves when it was cold. <b>In the Chamber of Avtinas and in the Chamber of the Spark there were upper stories,</b> and <b>the young</b> priests, who were not yet eligible to serve in the Temple, would <b>keep watch there.</b>",
            "In <b>the Chamber of the Hearth,</b> there was no upper story, as its ceiling was round like <b>a cupola. And it was a large hall, surrounded</b> by <b>rows of stone</b> that protruded from the walls and that served as benches. <b>The elders of the patrilineal</b> priestly <b>family</b> that would serve in the Temple the following day would <b>sleep there, and the keys to the</b> Temple <b>courtyard</b> were <b>in their possession.</b>",
            "The <b>young men of the priesthood,</b> who were old enough to serve in the Temple, would also sleep in the Chamber of the Hearth. They would not sleep on benches, but instead <b>each</b> of the priests would sleep with <b>his garment on the ground.</b> Furthermore, <b>they would not sleep</b> dressed <b>in the sacred vestments; rather, they would remove</b> them and fold them up. <b>And</b> then <b>they</b> would <b>place</b> their vestments on the floor <b>beneath their heads, and cover themselves with their own</b> non-sacred <b>garments.</b> If <b>a seminal emission befell one of</b> the priests, rendering him ritually impure and unfit for service, <b>he would leave</b> the Chamber of the Hearth, <b>and he would walk</b>"

He would walk through the passage <b>until he reached the Chamber of Immersion. And there was a fire</b> burning <b>there</b> to warm the priests after they had immersed, <b>and</b> also <b>a bathroom of honor,</b> so that the priests could urinate before immersion. <b>This was</b> the manifestation of <b>its honor:</b> If one <b>found</b> the door <b>closed,</b> he would <b>know that there was a person there,</b> and he would wait for him to exit before entering. If one found the door <b>open, it was known that there was no person there,</b> and he could enter. In this manner, the one using it was afforded privacy.",
            "After the priest <b>descended and immersed</b> in the ritual bath, he <b>ascended and dried himself</b> with a towel, <b>and warmed himself opposite the fire.

Since the purification process of one who immerses is not complete until sunset, by rabbinic law he could not remain in the Temple during the daytime.",
            "The mishna describes the commencement of the daily service in the Temple: Among the members of the priestly family who are to serve in the Temple that day, <b>whoever wants to remove</b> the ashes <b>from the altar rises early and immerses</b> himself in a ritual bath, as required of anyone who enters the Temple courtyard. He must immerse <b>before the appointed</b> priest <b>arrives,</b> as the appointed priest oversees the lottery that determines which priests perform the various rites of the Temple service, and the first of those lotteries determines who will be charged with the removal of the ashes. <b>And at what time does the appointed</b> priest <b>arrive?

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that the priests would keep watch in three locations in the Temple. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Abaye said</b> that they are derived from a verse, as <b>the verse states: “And those that were to camp before the Tabernacle eastward, before the Tent of Meeting toward the sunrise, were Moses and Aaron and his sons, keeping the watch of the Sanctuary, for the watch of the children of Israel,</b> and the non-priest who came near was to be put to death” (Numbers 3:38).",
            "The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>Yes, we have found</b> in this verse <b>that in general</b> the Torah <b>requires a watch</b> to be kept. Furthermore, the verse indicates that it is the <b>priests and Levites</b> who are required to perform the <b>watch,</b> as it states the precedent of Moses, who was a Levite, and Aaron, who was a priest. <b>But the mishna</b> (<i>Middot</i> 1:1) <b>teaches: The priests</b> would <b>keep watch in three places in the Temple</b> courtyard…<b>and the Levites in twenty-one places.</b> According to the mishna, the priests and Levites kept watch in different locations, <b>whereas</b> in the <b>verse</b> the <b>priests and</b> the <b>Levites are written together,</b> indicating that they kept watch in the same places.",
            "The Sages <b>say</b> that <b>this</b> is what the verse <b>is saying: “And those that were to camp before the Tabernacle eastward, before the Tent of Meeting toward the sunrise, were Moses,”</b> indicating that the Levites keep watch. <b>And then</b> the verse states with regard to the separate watch kept by the priests: <b>“Aaron and his sons, keeping the watch of the Sanctuary.”</b> Furthermore, the verse indicates that <b>Aaron</b> keeps watch <b>in one place, and his sons</b> keep watch <b>in two</b> other <b>places,</b> from which it is derived that the priests keep watch in three different places.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is it derived that the verse should be interpreted in this manner? This is derived <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it is written: “And those that were to</b> camp…were Moses,” <b>and it is written</b> separately: “Aaron and his sons, <b>keeping the watch.”</b> This indicates that those <b>who</b> were to <b>camp</b> and thereby keep watch <b>are discrete, and</b> those <b>keeping the watch are discrete,</b> i.e., they perform different watches in separate places.",
            "The Gemara objects: One can <b>say</b> that <b>all of</b> the priests keep watch <b>in one place</b> that is <b>discrete</b> from the watches of the Levites, but not in three separate places. The Gemara explains: That possibility should <b>not enter your mind,</b> as the verse juxtaposes the watches of Moses and Aaron. This indicates that <b>just as Moses</b> keeps watch <b>in one place discretely, so too, Aaron and his sons</b> each keep watch <b>in one place discretely,</b> and they do not keep watch together.",
            "<b>Rav Ashi said</b> that the <i>halakha</i> that the priests keep watch in three places is derived <b>from the end of the verse,</b> which states: “Moses and Aaron and his sons, <b>keeping [<i>shomerim</i>] the watch [<i>mishmeret</i>]</b> of the Sanctuary, <b>for the watch [<i>lemishmeret</i>]</b> of the children of Israel.” The verse uses three terms from the root <i>shin</i>, <i>mem</i>, <i>reish</i>, which means to watch, indicating that there should be three separate watches."

            "§ The mishna teaches that <b>the Chamber of Avtinas and the Chamber of the Spark</b> were upper stories. Concerning this, <b>a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>Were</b> these halls <b>actual upper stories? Or perhaps they were</b> merely very <b>tall,</b> built upon pillars, and therefore were <b>like upper stories.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna that discusses the seven gates to the Temple courtyard (<i>Middot</i> 1:5): There were three gates <b>that were in the north,</b> and the first of these was the <b>Gate of the Spark.</b> It <b>was like a portico [<i>akhsadra</i>], and</b> there was <b>an upper story built atop it,</b> where the honor guard stood, <b>with the priests watching from above,</b> in the upper story; <b>and the Levites</b> would keep watch <b>from below. And</b> the hall <b>had an entrance toward the non-sacred</b> area of the Temple Mount. This mishna indicates that the Chamber of the Spark was an actual upper story.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> that the priests and Levites kept watch on different stories, derived? This is derived from a verse, <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states that God said to Aaron: “And your brethren also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, you shall bring near with you, <b>that they may accompany you and serve you”</b> (Numbers 18:2). <b>The verse is speaking of</b> the Levites accompanying Aaron in <b>your,</b> i.e., Aaron’s, <b>service</b> of keeping watch in the Temple, which is the only service performed by both priests and Levites. Since the verse speaks of the watch of the Levites only as an accompaniment to the watch of the priests, the Levites do not keep watch from above like the priests, but only from below.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>Do you say</b> that <b>the verse speaks of</b> the Levites’ accompanying the priests in <b>your service,</b> of the priests keeping watch, <b>or</b> is it <b>only</b> stating that the Levites should accompany the priests <b>through their</b> own <b>service</b> of bearing the sacred vessels? The <i>baraita</i> explains that <b>when</b> the verse <b>states: “And they shall accompany you, and they shall keep</b> the watch of the Tent of Meeting” (Numbers 18:4), this is referring to keeping watch <b>of all</b> the Temple’s <b>vessels and all its service,</b> and consequently <b>their</b> own <b>service</b> of bearing the sacred vessels <b>is</b> already <b>stated. How,</b> then, <b>do I realize</b> the meaning of the previous verse: <b>“That they may accompany you and serve you”</b> (Numbers 18:2)? <b>The verse is speaking of</b> the Levites accompanying the priests in <b>your service,</b> of the priests keeping watch in the Temple. <b>How so?</b> The <b>priests keep watch from above, and</b> the <b>Levites</b> accompany them <b>from below.</b>",
            "§ With regard to the third place in which the priests would keep watch, the mishna states: In <b>the Chamber of the Hearth</b> the ceiling was round like a <b>cupola, and it was a large hall.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But was there</b> only <b>one watchman in the Chamber of the Hearth? And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a mishna (<i>Middot</i> 1:7): <b>The Chamber of the Hearth had two gates; one,</b> on the north side, was <b>open to the rampart, and one,</b> on the south side, was <b>open to the courtyard. Rabbi Yehuda said: This</b> gate <b>that was open to the courtyard had a small wicket</b> in the door of the gate, <b>through which</b> the priests would <b>enter</b> in order <b>to examine the courtyard</b> and ensure that everything was in order. The Chamber of the Hearth had two gates, and therefore there should have been two watchmen there. <b>Abaye said: Since</b> the two gates <b>stood next to each other,</b> i.e., directly opposite one another, it <b>was sufficient for them</b> to be watched <b>by one watchman,</b> who could <b>look here and look there.</b>",
            "§ The mishna teaches that the Chamber of the Hearth was <b>surrounded</b> by <b>rows of stone</b> that protruded from the walls and that served as benches. The Gemara asks: <b>What are</b> these <b>rows</b> of stone? They are rows of <b>chiseled stones by which</b> the priests <b>ascend to</b> another row of <b>stone,</b> where they could lie down. The Gemara asks: <b>And would they split</b> the <b>stones</b> in the process of building the Temple? <b>But isn’t it written: “For the Temple, when it was being built,</b> was built <b>of whole stone</b> made ready at the quarry; and there was neither hammer nor ax nor any tool of iron heard in the Temple, while it was being built” (I Kings 6:7)?",
            "<b>Abaye said:</b> It was prohibited to use iron implements to cut the stones only inside the Temple area. In this case it was permitted to have chiseled stones, <b>as</b> the builders <b>prepared</b> the stones in another location. <b>And</b> the builders <b>initially brought small stones and large stones</b> with which to build the Temple, <b>as it is written:</b> “And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, <b>stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits”</b> (I Kings 7:10). Accordingly, the larger stones were used for the lower tier, while the smaller stones were for the higher tier, forming protruding benches upon which the priests could sleep.",
            "The mishna teaches that <b>the elders of the patrilineal family</b> that would serve in the Temple the following day would <b>sleep there,</b> on the rows of stone. The Gemara asks: <b>But why</b> did the priests sleep on the stones? <b>Let them bring beds</b> into the Chamber of the Hearth. <b>Abaye said:</b> It is <b>not proper conduct to bring beds into the Temple.</b>",
            "The mishna further teaches that with regard to the <b>young men of the priesthood, each</b> of them would sleep with <b>his garment on the ground.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> is it that <b>there,</b> in the earlier mishna, the <i>tanna</i> <b>calls them young</b> [<b><i>rovim</i></b>] priests, whereas <b>here,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>calls them</b>"

        [
            "the <b>young men of the priesthood [<i>pirḥei khehunna</i>]?</b> Is there a distinction between these different terms? The Sages <b>say: Yes,</b> there is a distinction. <b>There,</b> with regard to the priests who keep watch in the Chamber of Avtinas and in the Chamber of the Spark, the mishna is referring to priests <b>who have not reached</b> the age at which they are eligible <b>to perform</b> the Temple <b>service,</b> and therefore the <i>tanna</i> <b>calls them young</b> priests. The older priests would not keep watch, as they preferred to perform the Temple service. <b>Here,</b> with regard to the priests who sleep in the Chamber of the Hearth in order to be ready to perform the morning rites, the mishna is referring to priests <b>who have reached</b> the age at which <b>they</b> are eligible <b>to perform</b> the Temple <b>service,</b> and consequently the <i>tanna</i> <b>calls them</b> the <b>young men</b> of the priesthood.",
            "§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Middot</i> 1:1): <b>The priests</b> would <b>keep watch in three places in the Temple</b> courtyard: <b>In the Chamber of Avtinas, and in the Chamber of the Spark, and in the Chamber of the Hearth.</b>",
            "<b>And the Levites</b> would keep watch <b>in twenty-one places,</b> as follows: <b>Five upon</b> the <b>five gates of the Temple Mount; four upon</b> the <b>four corners of</b> the Temple Mount, <b>within</b> the wall surrounding the Temple Mount; <b>five upon</b> the <b>five gates of</b> the Temple <b>courtyard, and four upon</b> the <b>four corners of</b> the Temple courtyard <b>outside</b> the courtyard wall, surrounding the Temple courtyard. <b>One</b> watch is observed <b>in the Chamber of the Offering,</b> where animals that had been checked for blemishes were held in readiness for sacrifice; <b>one</b> watch is kept <b>in the Chamber of the Curtain,</b> where the Curtain separating the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies was woven; <b>and</b> finally, <b>one</b> watch is kept <b>behind the Chamber of the Ark Cover,</b> in the area between the Holy of Holies and the western wall of the Temple Mount.",
            "With regard to these twenty-one places where the Levites keep watch, the Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Yehuda of Sura said, and some say</b> that <b>it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>:</b> This is derived <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the Levites assigned by David to serve as gatekeepers upon the future construction of the Temple: <b>Eastward were six Levites, northward four Levites, southward four Levites, and for the <i>Asuppim</i> two and two. For the <i>Parbar</i> westward, four at the causeway, and two at the <i>Parbar</i></b> (see I Chronicles 26:17–18).",
            "The Sages <b>say</b> that if these verses are the source for the twenty-one places in which the Levites keep watch, that is difficult, as <b>these</b> watches enumerated in the verse <b>are twenty-four</b> in total. <b>Abaye said: This</b> is what the verse <b>is saying: “For the <i>Asuppim</i></b> two,” and they are always only <b>two.</b> It is not uncommon for a verse to repeat a word for emphasis in this manner, especially at the end of a verse.",
            "The Gemara objects: Even if two locations are removed from the list, according to the verse <b>there are still twenty-two</b> watches, rather than twenty-one. The Gemara explains: <b>That</b> watch, <b>which</b> was situated at the <b><i>Parbar</i>, was</b> composed of only <b>one</b> watchman, <b>and</b> as for <b>the other</b> Levite mentioned in the verse, <b>it was</b> merely to serve <b>as company that he went and sat with</b> the watchman, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <i>Parbar</i> <b>was situated on the outer</b> side and was isolated from the other watches.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term <b>“at the <i>Parbar</i> [<i>laParbar</i>]”</b> (I Chronicles 26:18)? <b>Rabba bar Rav Sheila said:</b> This term is a contraction of two Aramaic words, and it is <b>like one who says: Toward the outside [<i>kelapei bar</i>].</b>",
            "The Gemara presents an alternative answer to the question with regard to the verse: <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>actually</b> there are <b>twenty-four</b> watches, and the verse may be interpreted literally <b>as it is written. Three of them</b> are the watches kept <b>by</b> the <b>priests, and</b> the remaining <b>twenty-one</b> are the watches kept <b>by</b> the <b>Levites.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written here</b> in the verse that all twenty-four watches are kept by the <b>Levites?</b> The Gemara answers: This interpretation is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: In twenty-four places</b> in the Bible the <b>priests are called Levites, and this is one of them: “But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok,</b> that kept the charge of My Sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from Me, they shall come near to Me to serve Me” (Ezekiel 44:15).",
            "The mishna (<i>Middot</i> 1:1) teaches that <b>five</b> watches are kept <b>upon</b> the <b>five gates of the Temple Mount, and four</b> watches are kept <b>upon</b> the <b>four corners of</b> the Temple Mount <b>within</b> the Temple Mount wall. <b>Five</b> watches are kept <b>upon</b> the <b>five gates of</b> the Temple <b>courtyard, and four</b> are kept <b>upon</b> the <b>four corners of</b> the Temple courtyard <b>outside</b> the courtyard wall, on the Temple Mount. The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> with regard to <b>the Temple Mount that we perform</b> the watch <b>within</b> the walls, <b>and what is different</b> with regard to the Temple <b>courtyard that we perform</b> the watch <b>outside</b> its walls?",
            "The Sages <b>say:</b> With regard to the watches on <b>the Temple Mount, if</b> the watchman <b>tires and wants</b> to <b>sit</b> down, <b>he may sit</b> down, as it is permitted to sit on the Temple Mount.

            "<b>The Master said</b> above that <b>five</b> watches are kept <b>upon</b> the <b>five gates of</b> the Temple <b>courtyard.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But was it</b> only <b>five gates that were</b> constructed <b>in the</b> walls of <b>the</b> Temple <b>courtyard? And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a mishna (<i>Middot</i> 1:4): <b>There were seven gates in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard: Three in the north, and three in the south, and one in the east.</b>",
            "<b>Abaye said:</b> Although there were seven gates, <b>two of them,</b> the gate to the Chamber of the Spark and the gate to the Chamber of the Hearth, <b>did not require a watch</b> of the Levites, as the priests kept watch there. <b>Rava said:</b> The number of gates <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There must be no fewer than thirteen treasurers and seven trustees</b> appointed over the Temple administration. <b>Rabbi Natan says: There must be no fewer than thirteen treasurers, corresponding to</b> the <b>thirteen gates.

            "§ The mishna (25b) teaches that the priests <b>would not sleep</b> dressed <b>in the sacred vestments;</b> rather, they would remove them and place them beneath their heads. The Gemara infers from here that <b>it is</b> only <b>sleep that is not</b> permitted while a priest is dressed in the sacred vestments, lest he pass wind during his sleep. <b>But</b> with regard to wearing such vestments while the priests are awake and engaged in various activities, e.g., <b>walking, they may walk</b> about dressed in the vestments, even when they do not need to wear them for the Temple service. <b>You may</b> therefore <b>conclude from</b> the mishna that <b>it is permitted to derive benefit from priestly vestments.</b>",
            "The Sages <b>say</b> that this inference is incorrect. <b>The same is true</b> of walking, <b>as even walking</b> while wearing the vestments <b>is not</b> permitted, <b>and</b> the reason <b>that</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> specifically that the priests <b>would not sleep</b> dressed in the vestments is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>wanted to teach the latter clause: Rather, they</b> would <b>remove</b> them <b>and fold</b> them, <b>and</b> then <b>they</b> would <b>place them beneath their heads.</b> Since the latter clause is referring specifically to sleeping, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> in <b>the former clause as well</b> that the priests <b>would not sleep</b> dressed in the vestments.",
            "The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> according to this interpretation, the mishna <b>itself is difficult,</b> as the mishna states: <b>And they</b> would <b>place</b> the priestly vestments <b>beneath their heads,</b> as a cushion. One may <b>conclude from</b> this statement that <b>it is permitted to derive benefit from priestly vestments.</b> The Gemara rejects this interpretation: <b>Say</b> that the mishna means that they would place the vestments <b>next to their heads,</b> not literally beneath them.",
            "<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> One may <b>conclude from</b> this interpretation of the mishna that if one places <b>phylacteries by the side</b> of his head while he sleeps, <b>they are</b> in <b>a permitted</b> place. <b>And we are not concerned</b> that <b>perhaps he will roll over</b> in his sleep <b>and fall upon them,</b> which would degrade the phylacteries.",
            "The Gemara comments: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> to say <b>that</b> the mishna permits the vestments to be placed only <b>next to their heads. As, if you say</b> that the mishna permits the vestments to be placed literally <b>beneath their heads,</b> this is difficult. <b>Granted that it is permitted to derive benefit from them,</b> but one <b>could derive</b> that it is prohibited to sleep upon them <b>due to the prohibition of diverse kinds</b> of wool and linen. The priestly vestments contain both wool and linen, which is a prohibited mixture in every other context. The Torah specifically permits the priests to wear them while they are performing the Temple service, but this does not extend to using the vestments as a cushion while sleeping."

            "The Gemara explains the difficulty: If one maintains that the mishna permits the priests to place the vestments beneath their heads, <b>this works out well according to the one who said</b> that <b>the belt of the High Priest is not the same as the belt of an ordinary priest.</b> Although the belt of the High Priest was made of both wool and linen, the belt of ordinary priests, like the rest of their vestments, were made entirely of linen and did not contain diverse kinds. <b>But according to the one who said</b> that <b>the belt of an ordinary priest is the same as the belt of the High Priest, what is there to say?</b> Since the belt contained diverse kinds, how could the mishna possibly permit the priests to sleep upon their vestments?",
            "<b>And if you would say</b> that with regard to <b>diverse kinds it is</b> only <b>placing</b> the garment <b>upon</b> oneself <b>or wearing</b> it <b>that is prohibited, but</b> as for <b>spreading</b> it <b>beneath you,</b> it is <b>permitted,</b> this explanation is difficult. <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“Neither shall there come upon you</b> a garment of diverse kinds” (Leviticus 19:19). One should infer as follows: <b>But you may spread</b> a garment of diverse kinds <b>beneath you,</b> in order to lie upon it. The <i>baraita</i> continues: This is the <i>halakha</i> by Torah law, <b>but the Sages said</b> that <b>it is prohibited to do so, lest a single fiber wrap</b> itself <b>upon his flesh,</b> which would cause him to be in transgression of the Torah prohibition. Accordingly, the priests should not be permitted to place vestments made of diverse kinds beneath their heads.",
            "<b>And if you would say</b> that the priests could place the vestments beneath their heads in such a manner <b>that something separates</b> between their flesh and the vestments, as the fibers could not wrap themselves upon their flesh, such conduct would still be prohibited. <b>Doesn’t Rabbi Shimon say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul says in the name of the holy community in Jerusalem: Even</b> if there are <b>ten mattresses</b> piled <b>one atop the other and</b> a garment of <b>diverse kinds</b> is placed <b>beneath</b> all of <b>them, it is prohibited to sleep upon them?</b> This is because the rabbinic decree applies equally to all cases, irrespective of whether the concern that motivated the decree exists. <b>Rather,</b> one may <b>conclude from</b> here that the mishna permits the vestments to be placed only <b>next to their heads.</b>",
            "The Gemara suggests alternative solutions: <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the mishna does permit the priests to place the vestments beneath their heads, as it is referring <b>to those</b> vestments <b>that do not contain diverse kinds. Rav Ashi says:</b> The mishna permits the priests to place even the belt that contains diverse kinds beneath their heads. This is because the <b>priestly vestments,</b> and specifically the belt, <b>are stiff,</b> and therefore it is not prohibited to lie on them. <b>As Rav Huna, son of Rabbi Yehoshua, said: This stiff felt [<i>namta</i>],</b> which is manufactured <b>in</b> the city of <b>Neresh</b> and is made of diverse kinds, <b>is permitted.</b> The prohibition of diverse kinds applies only to items that are similar to garments, which one derives pleasure from wearing. A stiff garment does not provide warmth, and is therefore not included in this prohibition.",
            "The Gemara returns to discuss the earlier dilemma, of whether it is permitted to derive benefit from priestly vestments. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the <b>priestly vestments,</b> the act of <b>one who leaves</b> the Temple dressed <b>in them</b> and goes out <b>to the country,</b> i.e., outside the Temple, is <b>prohibited. But in the Temple, both at the time of</b> the Temple <b>service and not at the time of</b> the <b>service,</b> wearing the vestments is <b>permitted, as it is permitted to derive benefit from the priestly vestments.</b> The Gemara concludes: One may <b>conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that it is permitted to derive benefit from the priestly vestments.",
            "According to the <i>baraita</i>, the priestly vestments may not be worn outside the Temple.

            "The <i>baraita</i> relates that Shimon HaTzaddik went to greet Alexander the Macedonian wearing the priestly vestments. The Gemara in <i>Yoma</i> cites the complete <i>baraita</i>, <b>up to</b> the Gemara’s explanation as to why Shimon HaTzaddik wore the priestly vestments outside the Temple: <b>If you wish, say</b> that Shimon HaTzaddik did not wear consecrated priestly vestments. Rather, he wore garments that were <b>fit to be priestly vestments,</b> i.e., they were made of the same material and design.",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that he did in fact wear consecrated priestly vestments. Although this is usually prohibited, in this instance it was permitted due to the principle: <b>“It is time to act for the Lord; they have nullified Your Torah”</b> (Psalms 119:126). In times of great need, such as when one seeks to prevent the destruction of the Temple, it is permitted to violate the <i>halakha</i> for the sake of Heaven, and the actions of Shimon HaTzaddik indeed averted the destruction.",

As the count progressed, a priest could calculate the result and surreptitiously extend his thumb and an additional finger. Since there is separation between the thumb and the forefinger it might appear as though they belonged to two different priests, and in this manner one could cause the lottery to conclude with a different priest.",

And Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces, and the head, and the fat, in order <b>upon the wood that is on the fire</b> which is upon the altar” (Leviticus 1:7–8).

The phrase “two by day” indicates that the lamb must be slaughtered <b>opposite</b> the light of <b>the day.</b> Since Eretz Yisrael is north of the equator, the sun is always in the southern part of the sky.

            "The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>How so,</b> i.e., how can this principle be applied to both the morning and the afternoon offerings?

            "<b>But the Sages say: This</b> distance <b>and that</b> distance <b>are equal, as it is stated: “For as the heaven is high above the earth,</b> so great is His kindness toward them that fear Him. <b>As far as the east is from the west,</b> so far has He removed our transgressions from us” (Psalms 103:11–12). The verses compare the extent of God’s kindness and His removal of transgressions to vast expanses. <b>And if one of the</b> distances <b>is greater</b> than the other, <b>let</b> the verse <b>write</b> that <b>both of</b> God’s enumerated attributes are <b>like</b> the measure <b>that is greater.
