            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Everyone takes</b> vows of <b>valuation</b> and is thereby obligated to donate to the Temple treasury the value fixed by the Torah (see Leviticus 27:3–7) for the age and sex of the person valuated. <b>And</b> similarly, everyone <b>is valuated,</b> and therefore one who vowed to donate his fixed value is obligated to pay. Likewise, everyone <b>vows</b> to donate to the Temple treasury the assessment of a person, based on his market value to be sold as a slave, and is thereby obligated to pay; <b>and</b> everyone is the object of <b>a vow</b> if others vowed to donate his assessment. This includes <b>priests, Levites and Israelites, women, and</b> Canaanite <b>slaves.</b>",
            "<b>A <i>tumtum</i>,</b> whose sexual organs are concealed, <b>and a hermaphrodite [<i>androginos</i>], vow, and</b> are the object of <b>a vow, and take</b> vows of <b>valuation, but they are not valuated.</b> Consequently, if one says, with regard to a <i>tumtum</i>: The valuation of so-and-so is incumbent upon me to donate to the Temple treasury, he is not obligated to pay anything, <b>as only a definite male or a definite female are valuated.</b>",
            "<b>A deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor</b> are the object of <b>a vow and are valuated, but neither vow</b> to donate the assessment of a person <b>nor take</b> a vow of <b>valuation, because they lack the</b> presumed <b>mental competence</b> to make a commitment.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the mishna’s statement: <b>Everyone [<i>hakol</i>] takes</b> vows of <b>valuation?</b> When a principle is stated in a mishna, it serves to include a particular case that it does not mention explicitly in its <i>halakha</i>. Which case is included by the broad statement here? The Gemara answers: The mishna teaches it <b>to add a discriminating</b> minor <b>on</b> the <b>brink of adulthood [<i>mufla samukh le’ish</i>],</b> i.e., during the year before a minor reaches majority.",
            "The Gemara similarly asks: <b>What is added</b> by the statement: And everyone <b>is valuated?</b> The Gemara answers: The mishna serves <b>to add a repulsive</b> man <b>and one afflicted with boils,</b> who have no market value.",
            "The Gemara explains why this addition is necessary: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that as <b>it is written</b> in the verse: <b>“A vow</b> of persons to the Lord, <b>according to your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:2), which juxtaposes one who is valuated to one who is the object of a vow, <b>anyone who is</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>assessments,</b> i.e., if he vows to pay his assessment he must pay it to the Temple, <b>is</b> also included <b>in</b> the category of <b>valuations. But anyone who is not</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>assessments is not</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>valuations.</b> Since these people, a repulsive man and one afflicted with boils, are not subject to assessment, as they have no market value, perhaps they are also not subject to valuation.",
            "Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that these too are subject to valuation, as the same verse also states: <b>“Persons [<i>nefashot</i>],”</b> indicating anyone who has <b>any amount</b> of life [<i>nefesh</i>] is subject to valuation.",
            "The Gemara further asks: <b>What is added</b> by the mishna’s statement: Everyone <b>vows</b> to donate the assessment of a person? The Gemara answers: Actually, this statement is not necessary, but it is mentioned because the continuation: And everyone is the object of <b>a vow, was necessary.</b>",
            "The Gemara inquires: <b>What,</b> then, <b>is added</b> by the clause: And everyone is the object of <b>a vow? If</b> one were to suggest that this serves <b>to add a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite,</b> that cannot be correct, as they <b>are explicitly taught</b> in the mishna itself. <b>And if</b> one were to suggest that it serves <b>to add a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor,</b> they too <b>are explicitly taught</b> in the mishna.",
            "And <b>if</b> you say that this clause serves <b>to add</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a child who is <b>less than a month old,</b> who is not subject to valuation, is nevertheless subject to assessment, this too <b>is explicitly taught</b> in a mishna (5a). And <b>if</b> one were to say that it serves <b>to add a gentile,</b> that <b>is</b> also <b>explicitly taught</b> in a mishna (5b). The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the phrase: And everyone is the object of a vow, is mentioned in the mishna in order <b>to add</b> a child who is <b>less than a month old, and</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> this <i>halakha</i> in general terms <b>and then explains</b> it in detail later.",
            "§ The Gemara inquires about similar general expressions that appear in other <i>mishnayot</i>. <b>What is added</b> by the mishna (<i>Menaḥot</i> 93a): <b>Everyone</b> who brings an offering <b>places hands</b> on the head of the animal? The Gemara answers: This clause serves <b>to add</b> that <b>an heir</b> places hands on the offering of the deceased, <b>and</b> the mishna is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> that an heir does not place his hands on an offering he inherited.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the ruling of the mishna (<i>Temura</i> 2a): <b>Everyone substitutes</b> a non-sacred animal for a consecrated animal? The Gemara answers: Here too, the mishna serves <b>to add</b> that <b>an heir</b> substitutes a non-sacred animal for his father’s consecrated animal, i.e., the non-sacred animal also becomes sanctified. <b>And</b> this mishna is also <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> as he maintains that an heir cannot substitute a non-sacred animal for the consecrated animal he inherited.",
            "The Gemara cites the source for these two opinions of Rabbi Yehuda. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>An heir places hands</b> on his father’s offering, and <b>an heir can effect substitution</b> for an offering inherited from his father. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: An heir does not place hands</b> and <b>an heir cannot effect substitution.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> With regard to placing of hands, he expounds the term: <b>“His offering”</b> (Leviticus 3:2), as teaching that one places his hands only on his own offering, <b>but not</b> on <b>his father’s offering. And</b> with regard to the ruling that an heir cannot effect substitution, Rabbi Yehuda <b>derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the initial stage of consecration,</b> i.e., substitution, in which a previously non-sacred animal is consecrated, <b>from the final stage of consecration,</b> the act of placing hands, which is performed upon an already-consecrated animal immediately before it is slaughtered: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>the final stage of consecration, an heir does not place hands, so too,</b> with regard to <b>the initial stage of consecration, an heir cannot effect substitution.</b>",
            "<b>And</b> from where do <b>the Rabbis</b> derive their opinion? The verse states: “If <b>he shall substitute [<i>hamer yamir</i>]</b> animal for animal” (Leviticus 27:10), with the doubled form of <i>hamer yamir</i> serving <b>to include the heir</b> as one capable of effecting substitution. <b>And</b> the Rabbis <b>derive the final stage of consecration,</b> i.e., the placing of hands, <b>from the initial stage of consecration,</b> i.e., substitution: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>the initial stage of consecration an heir can effect substitution, so too,</b> with regard to <b>the final stage of consecration, an heir can place hands.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis, what do they do with this</b> term: <b>“His offering,”</b> from which Rabbi Yehuda derives that an heir does not place his hands? The Gemara explains how the Rabbis expound each mention of the term, which appears three times (Leviticus 3:2, 7, 12). One instance of <b>“his offering”</b> teaches that one places hands only on one’s own offering, <b>but not</b> on the <b>offering of a gentile.</b> Another instance of <b>“his offering”</b> teaches that one places hands only on one’s own offering, <b>but not</b> on the <b>offering of another</b> person. The third instance of <b>“his offering”</b> serves <b>to include all</b> the <b>owners of</b> a jointly owned <b>offering in</b> the requirement of <b>placing hands,</b> i.e., they are all required to place their hands on the offering.",
            "The Gemara clarifies: <b>And</b> how does Rabbi Yehuda respond to this claim? The Gemara explains that <b>Rabbi Yehuda does not hold</b> that one of the mentions serves <b>to include all owners</b> of a jointly owned <b>offering in</b> the requirement of <b>placing hands.</b> Rather, one of the owners places his hands on the offering on behalf of the entire group. Consequently, he is left with one spare mention of “his offering,” from which he derives that an heir does not place his hands. The Gemara adds: <b>Alternatively,</b> one can say that Rabbi Yehuda <b>holds</b> that one of the mentions serves to include owners of a jointly owned offering,"
        ],
        [
            "but he maintains that the exclusion of <b>a gentile and</b> the exclusion of the offering of <b>another</b> person from the requirement of placing hands are <b>derived from</b> the same <b>one</b> mention of “his offering” in the <b>verse.</b> This <b>leaves two</b> mentions of “his offering” <b>for</b> Rabbi Yehuda. <b>One</b> he expounds to teach that he places hands on <b>“his offering,” but not</b> on <b>his father’s offering</b> that he inherited, <b>and the other</b> mention remains <b>to include all</b> the <b>owners of</b> a jointly owned <b>offering in</b> the requirement of <b>placing hands.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Yehuda, what does he do</b> with the use of the doubled form <b>in this</b> verse: “If <b>he shall substitute [<i>hamer yamir</i>]”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He requires it to include a woman</b> among those who can effect substitution. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Since the entire matter</b> of substitution <b>is stated</b> in the Torah <b>only in the masculine form, what</b> is the reason that <b>we ultimately</b> come <b>to include a woman? The verse states: “And if he shall substitute [<i>hamer yamir</i>],”</b> using a doubled form.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis,</b> from where do they learn that a woman can perform substitution? The Gemara answers: They derive it <b>from</b> the extra “and” in the phrase: <b>“And if</b> he shall substitute” (Leviticus 27:10). <b>But Rabbi Yehuda does not expound</b> the extra “and” in the term <b>“and if”</b> at all.",
            "§ The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the statement of the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b><i>sukka</i>?</b> The Gemara answers: This serves <b>to add a minor who does not need his mother</b> when he awakes in the middle of the night. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Sukka</i> 28a): <b>A minor who does not need his mother is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b><i>sukka</i>.</b>",
            "The Gemara further asks: <b>What is added</b> by the ruling of the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b><i>lulav</i>?</b> The Gemara answers: This clause serves <b>to add a minor who knows</b> how <b>to wave</b> the <i>lulav</i>. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Sukka</i> 42a): <b>A minor who knows</b> how <b>to wave</b> the <i>lulav</i> <b>is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b><i>lulav</i>.</b>",
            "The Gemara continues to ask similar questions: <b>What is added</b> by the statement of a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>ritual fringes?</b> The Gemara explains that this serves <b>to add a minor who knows</b> how <b>to wrap himself</b> in a garment. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A minor who knows</b> how <b>to wrap himself</b> in a garment <b>is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>ritual fringes.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the ruling of a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>phylacteries?</b> The Gemara answers that it serves <b>to add a minor who knows</b> how <b>to preserve</b> the sanctity of <b>phylacteries</b> by maintaining a state of bodily cleanliness. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a minor who knows</b> how <b>to preserve</b> the sanctity of <b>phylacteries</b> in a state of cleanliness, <b>his father purchases phylacteries for him.</b>",
            "§ The Gemara further inquires: <b>What is added</b> by the statement of the mishna (<i>Ḥagiga</i> 2a): <b>Everyone is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>appearance,</b> i.e., the obligation to appear in the Temple and to sacrifice an offering on the three pilgrimage Festivals. The Gemara answers: The mishna serves <b>to add one who is a half-slave half-freeman,</b> e.g., a Canaanite slave who was owned jointly, and only one of his owners freed him.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Ravina, who said: One who is half-slave half-freeman is exempt from the</b> mitzva of <b>appearance</b> in the Temple, that clause serves <b>to add</b> one who was <b>lame on</b> the <b>first day</b> of the Festival and was unable to travel, and was therefore exempt at the time, <b>but</b> who <b>was healed on</b> the <b>second day</b> of the Festival. This man is obligated to appear in the Temple before the end of the Festival.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that <b>all</b> seven days of a Festival <b>rectify one another,</b> i.e., the obligation to appear applies equally to all days of the Festival, not just the first. Consequently, one who was exempt on the first day is nevertheless obligated on the second day. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that the main obligation is on the first day and that <b>all</b> the remaining days merely <b>rectify the first</b> day, a person who was lame on the first day of the Festival remains exempt throughout the rest of the Festival. If so, <b>what</b> does the statement of the mishna in <i>Ḥagiga</i> 2a serve <b>to add?</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: It serves <b>to add</b> one who is <b>blind in one of his eyes,</b> and teaches that he is obligated to appear in the Temple, whereas one who is entirely blind is exempt. The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> this ruling is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>,</b> Rabbi Yehuda.",
            "<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Yoḥanan ben Dahavai says in the name of Rabbi Yehuda:</b> One who is <b>blind in one of his eyes is exempt from the</b> mitzva of <b>appearance, as it is stated:</b> “Three times in the year all your males shall appear [<i>yera’eh</i>] before the Lord God” (Exodus 23:17). According to the way in which the verse is written, without vocalization, it can be read as <b><i>yireh</i>,</b> meaning: <b>Shall see,</b> instead of <b><i>yera’eh</i>,</b> meaning: <b>Shall appear.</b> This teaches that <b>in the</b> same <b>manner that one comes to see, so he comes to appear,</b> i.e., to be seen: <b>Just as</b> the usual way <b>to see</b> is <b>with both of one’s eyes, so too,</b> the obligation <b>to appear</b> applies only to one who comes <b>with</b> the sight of <b>both his eyes.</b> This is one possible explanation for what is added by the general statement of the mishna in <i>Ḥagiga</i> 2a, according to Ravina.",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Actually,</b> that statement serves <b>to include one who is half-slave and half-freeman. And</b> with regard to <b>what was difficult</b> for you <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of Ravina,</b> that he exempts such a person from the obligation of appearance, it is <b>not difficult: Here</b> the ruling is <b>in</b> accordance with <b>the initial</b> version of the <b>mishna,</b> whereas <b>there</b> it is <b>in</b> accordance with <b>the ultimate</b> version of the <b>mishna.</b>",
            "<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 88a): <b>One who is half-slave and half-freeman serves his master one day,</b> as he is half a slave, <b>and</b> works for <b>himself one day,</b> since he is half free. This is <b>the statement of Beit Hillel.</b>",
            "<b>Beit Shammai said to them: You have</b> thereby <b>remedied</b> the situation of <b>his master,</b> who fully derives benefit from all his rights to the slave, <b>but you have not remedied his own</b> situation. How so? <b>He cannot marry a maidservant,</b> as half of him is free, and a free Jew may not marry a Canaanite maidservant. <b>He is</b> also <b>unable</b> to marry <b>a free woman,</b> as half of him is still a slave, and a Jewish woman may not marry a Canaanite slave. And if you say <b>he should be idle,</b> i.e., refrain from marrying, <b>but isn’t it</b> true that <b>the world was created only for procreation, as it is stated:</b> “For so said the Lord that created the heavens…Who formed the earth and made it, He established it. <b>He did not create it to be a waste; He formed it to be inhabited”</b> (Isaiah 45:18)?",
            "<b>Rather, for the betterment of the world,</b> i.e., so that the slave will be able to engage in procreation, the court <b>forces his master to make him a freeman</b> by emancipating the half that he owns. <b>And</b> the slave <b>writes a bill to</b> his master accepting responsibility to pay <b>half his value</b> to him over time, as currently he has no property with which to redeem himself. <b>And Beit Hillel</b> ultimately <b>retracted</b> their opinion, <b>to rule in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai</b> that a half-slave must be emancipated. The ruling of the mishna that a half-slave must appear in the Temple is in accordance with this opinion, which holds that the master must free him. Ravina’s statement that he is not obligated to appear in the Temple is in accordance with the initial mishna, according to which Beit Hillel held that the master is not forced to free the half-slave.",
            "§ The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the statement of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone is obligated to sound the shofar?</b> The Gemara answers: This serves <b>to add a minor who reached</b> the age of <b>training</b> in mitzvot. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Rosh HaShana</i> 32b): <b>One</b> need <b>not prevent minors from sounding</b> the shofar <b>on</b> the <b>festival</b> of Rosh HaShana, despite the fact that they are not obligated in mitzvot.",
            "The Gemara asks: With regard to the ruling of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>reading</b> the <b>Megilla,</b> the Scroll of Esther, and the statement of the mishna (<i>Megilla</i> 19b): <b>Everyone is fit to read the Megilla,</b> these serve <b>to add</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>what?</b> The Gemara answers: They serve <b>to add women, and</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the ruling of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone is obligated to form a <i>zimmun</i></b> and recite Grace after Meals as a group?

            "The Gemara further inquires: <b>What is added</b> by the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone is included in a <i>zimmun</i>?</b> This serves <b>to add a minor who knows to Whom</b> one <b>recites a blessing. As Rav Naḥman says:</b> A minor who <b>knows to Whom</b> one <b>recites a blessing is included in a <i>zimmun</i>.</b>",
            "§ The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the clause in the mishna (<i>Zavim</i> 2:1): <b>Everyone becomes impure by</b> means of <b>a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>ziva</i>]?</b> This serves <b>to add</b> that even <b>a day-old baby</b> who has such a discharge becomes impure. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It would have been sufficient for the verse to state: <b>A man. Why</b> does <b>the verse state:</b> “When <b>any man</b> has an issue out of his flesh, his issue is impure” (Leviticus 15:2)? This serves <b>to include a day-old baby</b> who has such a discharge, to teach <b>that</b> even <b>he becomes impure as</b> one who experiences <b><i>ziva</i>.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says</b> that this amplification <b>is not necessary,</b> as the verse <b>states: “And of them that have an issue, whether it be a male or a female”</b> (Leviticus 15:33). <b>“A male”</b> includes <b>anyone who is male, whether a small child or an adult; “a female”</b> includes <b>anyone who is female, whether a small child or an adult. If so, why</b> does <b>the verse state: “Any man”? The Torah spoke in the language of men,</b> i.e., this is a normal way to phrase the sentence, and therefore one should not derive a <i>halakha</i> from the extra word.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone becomes impure with impurity</b> imparted by <b>a corpse?</b> The <i>baraita</i> teaches it <b>to add a minor.</b> The Gemara elaborates: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that since the verse states: “But the <b>man that shall be impure and shall not purify himself”</b> (Numbers 19:20), one should derive from here that <b>a man,</b> i.e., an adult, <b>yes,</b> he becomes impure, but <b>a minor</b> does <b>not.</b> Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> in the context of purification with purification water from impurity imparted by a corpse: “And sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, <b>and upon the persons that were there”</b> (Numbers 19:18). This indicates that all persons who were there became impure, regardless of age.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>what</b> does the term “the <b>man”</b> serve <b>to exclude?</b> The Gemara answers: It serves <b>to exclude a minor from excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>],</b> which is mentioned in that verse: “That soul shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly, because he has defiled the Sanctuary of the Lord” (Numbers 19:20). In other words, the term “the man” serves to teach that if a minor becomes impure and then enters the Temple, he is not liable to receive <i>karet</i>.",
            "The Gemara further asks: <b>What is added</b> by the ruling of the mishna (<i>Nega’im</i> 3:1): <b>Everyone becomes impure by</b> means of <b>leprous marks?</b> The Gemara answers: This serves <b>to add a minor.</b> As it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that since <b>it is written</b> in the verse: “He is <b>a leprous man,</b> he is impure” (Leviticus 13:44), this is teaching that <b>a man,</b> i.e., an adult, <b>yes,</b> he does become impure, but <b>a minor</b> does <b>not.</b> Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that a minor becomes impure by means of leprous marks.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say that</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>indeed so,</b> that a minor does not become impure by means of leprous marks?

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> in that case, <b>why do I</b> need the term: “He is a leprous <b>man”</b> (Leviticus 13:44)? The Gemara answers: It comes <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: From the phrase “he is a leprous <b>man” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> a leprous <b>man.

            "<b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states:</b> “A leprous <b>man”?</b> This is referring <b>to the matter of</b> the leper rending his clothes and letting his hair grow wild, which is stated in the verse <b>below:</b> “His clothes shall be rent, and the hair of his head shall go loose” (Leviticus 13:45). The verse therefore teaches that <b>a man</b> who is a leper <b>lets</b> his hair <b>grow and rends</b> his garments, <b>but a woman</b> who is a leper <b>does not let</b> her hair <b>grow and</b> does not <b>rend</b> her garments.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the ruling of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone may inspect leprous marks</b> in order to declare them pure or impure, and the clause of another <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone is fit to inspect leprous marks</b> in order to declare them pure or impure. The Gemara answers: These statements serve <b>to add</b> a priest who <b>is not expert in</b> distinguishing between <b>them,</b> the different types of leprous marks, <b>and in</b> identifying <b>their names.</b>",

            "The Gemara further asks: <b>What is added</b> by the statement of the mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 110b): <b>Everyone</b> can force others <b>to ascend to Eretz Yisrael,</b> i.e., one can compel his family and household to immigrate to Eretz Yisrael?"

The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who teaches slaves explicitly</b> in the mishna, <b>what</b> does this phrase serve <b>to add?</b> The Gemara answers that it serves <b>to add</b> the case of one who wishes to compel his family to move <b>from a pleasant residence</b> outside of Eretz Yisrael <b>to a noxious residence</b> in Eretz Yisrael.",

            "§ The Gemara discusses several other cases where a mishna or <i>baraita</i> states that everyone is obligated in a particular mitzva.

If these</b> people <b>are not obligated</b> to perform the mitzva, then <b>who is obligated</b> to perform it?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary for</b> the <i>halakha</i> to mention that <b>priests</b> are obligated to fulfill this mitzva, as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it is written: “In <i>sukkot</i> shall you reside</b> seven days” (Leviticus 23:42), one can argue as follows: <b>The Master said</b> that this teaches: <b>Reside seven days as you dwell</b> in your permanent home: <b>Just as</b> in the case of <b>dwelling,</b> a <b>man and his wife</b> typically reside together, <b>so too,</b> the mitzva of <b><i>sukka</i></b> must be performed by <b>a man and his wife</b> residing together. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>these priests, since they are</b> occupied <b>with</b> the Temple <b>service</b> during the Festival and are not free to dwell in the <i>sukka</i> together with their wives, perhaps they <b>should not be obligated</b> in the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>.",
            "Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so, as <b>although</b> priests are <b>exempt at the time of</b> the Temple <b>service, when it is not the time of</b> Temple <b>service they are obligated, just as is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to travelers. As the Master said</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Travelers</b> who are on the move <b>during the day are exempt from</b> the mitzva of <b><i>sukka</i> during the day but are obligated at night,</b> as they are not traveling at that time.",

            "The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary for</b> the <i>baraita</i> to mention that <b>priests</b> are obligated to fulfill this mitzva, as <b>it may enter your mind to say</b> as follows: <b>Since it is written: “You shall not wear diverse kinds,</b> wool and linen together. <b>You shall prepare yourself twisted cords</b> upon the four corners of your covering” (Deuteronomy 22:11–12), <b>it is</b> only <b>one who is not permitted to wear diverse kinds who is obligated in the mitzva of ritual fringes.

            "Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us that</b> the absence of one of the two types of phylacteries <b>do not prevent</b> fulfillment of the mitzva with <b>the other.

            "The Gemara answers by citing a <i>halakha</i> that the Sages <b>taught:</b> The <b>hair of</b> the High Priest <b>was visible between the frontplate and the mitre.</b> The frontplate was set on the forehead, below the hairline, while the mitre was set above it. In <b>that</b> space <b>there</b> the High Priest <b>would don</b> his <b>phylacteries.</b> Consequently, the phylacteries did not interpose between the mitre and the High Priest’s head.",

            "<b>But</b> with regard to <b>these priests</b> it is different, <b>since they are obligated to sound all year</b> long, as they sound trumpets when they sacrifice the offerings in the Temple on other Festivals, <b>as it is written: “And you shall sound the trumpets over your burnt offerings,</b> and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings” (Numbers 10:10), you might therefore <b>say</b> that <b>they should not be obligated</b> to sound the shofar on Rosh HaShana. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> teaches that even priests are obligated to fulfill this mitzva. The Gemara questions this comparison: <b>Are</b> these cases <b>comparable?

            "Rather, <b>it was necessary</b> to say that priests are obligated to fulfill this mitzva for a different reason.

            "§ The Gemara cites another similar <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone is obligated in the reading of the Megilla</b> including <b>priests, Levites, and Israelites.</b> The Gemara asks as before: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary to</b> teach that they <b>cancel their service</b> in the Temple and come to hear the reading of the Megilla, <b>and</b> this is <b>in accordance</b> with <b>that</b> which <b>Rav Yehuda</b> says that <b>Shmuel says.

            "§ The Gemara applies the same line of questioning to the mishna here: <b>Everyone takes</b> vows of <b>valuation…priests, Levites, and Israelites.</b> Isn’t that <b>obvious?

            "Rabbi Yehuda added that <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said to</b> ben Bukhri: <b>That is not</b> the case; <b>rather, any priest who does not contribute his</b> half-<b>shekel</b> is considered <b>a sinner,</b> as they are obligated in this mitzva like all other Jews. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>the priests</b> who do not contribute the half-shekel, in order to excuse themselves from the mitzva they <b>interpret this verse to their own</b> advantage: <b>“And every meal offering of the priest shall be wholly made to smoke; it shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 6:16).",
            "Those priests claim as follows: <b>Since</b> the <b><i>omer</i></b> offering, the measure of barley brought as a communal offering on the sixteenth of Nisan, <b>and the two loaves,</b> i.e., the public offering of two loaves from the new wheat, brought on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>and the shewbread</b> placed on the Table in the Sanctuary each Shabbat, which are all meal offerings, <b>are ours,</b> i.e., if we would contribute half-shekels we would have partial ownership of these communal offerings, as they are purchased with the half-shekels, <b>how</b> then <b>can they be eaten?</b> They would be regarded as priests’ meal offerings, which must be wholly burnt, in accordance with the aforementioned verse.",
            "The Gemara clarifies: <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>ben Bukhri, as well,</b> why is a priest who contributes a half-shekel not considered a sinner? <b>Since he is not obligated to bring</b> the half-shekel <b><i>ab initio</i>, when he brings</b> the half-shekel <b>he is also a sinner, since he is</b> causing the <b>bringing</b> of <b>a non-sacred</b> item <b>into the</b> Temple <b>courtyard.</b> The Gemara answers <b>that</b> the priest <b>brings and transfers</b> the half-shekel as a consecrated gift <b>to the community,</b> so it is considered part of the communal funds.",
            "The Gemara explains the relevance of ben Bukhri’s opinion to the question of the priests’ status with respect to valuations. According to ben Bukhri, who exempts the priests from contributing the half-shekel, <b>it might enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it is written: “And all your valuations shall be according to the shekel of the Sanctuary”</b> (Leviticus 27:25), perhaps this juxtaposition teaches that <b>anyone who is</b> included <b>in</b> the obligation to contribute half-<b>shekels is</b> included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>valuations.

In other words, a poor person, who gives according to his means rather than the amount prescribed in the Torah, does not fulfill his obligation unless he gives at least a shekel, which is a <i>sela</i> coin.",
            "<b>Rather, Abaye said:</b> It <b>was necessary</b> for the mishna to teach that priests are included in the <i>halakha</i> of valuation, as <b>it might enter your mind to say: Since it is written</b> with regard to a firstborn: <b>“And their redemption money, from a month old you shall redeem them, shall be, according to your valuation,</b> five shekels of silver” (Numbers 18:16), one might have said that <b>anyone</b> included <b>in</b> the mitzva of <b>redemption of the</b> firstborn <b>son is</b> included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>valuations; but</b> with regard to <b>these priests, since they are not</b> included <b>in</b> the mitzva of <b>redemption of the</b> firstborn <b>son,</b> they <b>are</b> also <b>not</b> included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>valuations.</b> Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that priests are also included in the <i>halakha</i> of valuations.",
            "<b>Rava said to</b> Abaye: <b>If that is so,</b> that one can expound the term “according to your valuation” in this manner, one could expound similarly <b>with regard to</b> the <b>ram of</b> the <b>guilt offering</b> brought by one who robs and then takes a false oath. <b>As it is written</b> with regard to that offering: <b>“And he shall bring his guilt offering to the Lord, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 5:25).

            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: This <i>halakha</i>, that a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite are not included in valuation, is derived from the term: <b>“The male”</b> (Leviticus 27:3). The definite article teaches that this <i>halakha</i> applies specifically to <b>a male, and not</b> to <b>a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite <b>should not be</b> valuated <b>by</b> the <b>valuation of a man, but</b> they <b>should be</b> valuated <b>by</b> the <b>valuation of a woman.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Then your valuation shall be for the male…and if it be a female”</b> (Leviticus 27:3–4). This teaches that valuation applies only to <b>a definite male</b> or <b>a definite female, but not</b> to <b>a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite,</b> who are categorized as neither male nor female.",
            "§ <b>The Master said</b> above in the beginning of the <i>baraita</i> that the verse: “When a man shall clearly utter a vow of persons to the Lord, <b>according to your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:2), serves <b>to include an unspecified valuation.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b>an unspecified valuation?</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who says:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>an unspecified valuation,</b> without specifying any particular person, <b>gives</b> the amount <b>of the smallest of the valuations. And how much is the smallest of the valuations?</b> It is <b>three shekels,</b> which is the valuation of a female who is younger than five years old (Leviticus 27:6).",
            "The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>And</b> why not <b>say</b> that one who does not specify a person should give <b>fifty</b> shekels, which is the largest of the valuations, that of a male between the ages of twenty and sixty (Leviticus 27:3)? The <i>baraita</i> answers: This ruling is based on the principle that if <b>you grasped a lot you did not grasp</b> anything, but if <b>you grasped a little, you grasped</b> something. In other words, if one can derive two sums from the verses, one should choose the smaller number, as it is included within the larger number and is therefore considered certain.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>And</b> why not <b>say</b> that smallest of the valuations is one <b>shekel, as it is written: “And all your valuations shall be according to the shekel of the Sanctuary”</b> (Leviticus 27:25)? The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>is written with regard to affordability.</b> If one vows to donate the valuation of a person to the Temple treasury but does not have sufficient funds to fulfill his vow, he must pay at least a shekel.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> since the payment of three shekels can be derived from the principle of grasping the lesser amount, <b>why do I</b> need <b>the verse</b> “according to your valuation”? <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> The verse is required <b>to teach that</b> unlike other valuations, where a person who cannot afford the set amount can fulfill his obligation with one shekel, in the case of an unspecified valuation even a poor person’s obligation <b>is not determined by affordability,</b> and he must give at least three shekels. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The Gemara answers: It is because it is <b>considered as though</b> he <b>explicitly</b> vowed that he is obligated to pay three shekels. The principle of affordability applies only to the valuations fixed by the Torah.",
            "<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says</b> the opposite: The term “according to your valuation” actually teaches that even an unspecified valuation is <b>determined based on affordability,</b> and a poor person fulfills his obligation by giving one shekel. The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b> Why would one think that this case differs from any other valuation? The Gemara answers that the verse is necessary <b>lest you say</b> that one who obligates himself in an unspecified valuation is <b>considered as though</b> he <b>articulated</b> that he is obligated to pay three shekels, and may not pay less. Therefore, this verse <b>teaches us</b> that an unspecified valuation is also subject to affordability, like other valuations.",
            "§ It is further stated in the <i>baraita</i> cited above: <b>Alternatively,</b> the term <b>“according to your valuation”</b> teaches that <b>one gives the valuation of his entire</b> self <b>and does not give the valuation of</b> the <b>value of limbs.</b> If one vows that he will give the valuation of a limb, he is not obligated to give anything. The Gemara asks: <b>But you have</b> already <b>derived</b> from <b>this</b> term: “According to your valuation,” the <i>halakha</i> of <b>an unspecified valuation.</b> How can you then derive another <i>halakha</i> from the same source? The Gemara answers: <b>Read into</b> this term two sources, as it could have merely written: <b>“Valuation,”</b> and instead it wrote: <b>“According to your valuation.”</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> adds: One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I</b> should <b>exclude</b> even the valuation of <b>an item upon which the soul is dependent,</b> without which one will die, e.g., the head. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Persons [<i>nefashot</i>],”</b> which teaches that if one valuated a limb upon which the soul [<i>nefesh</i>] is dependent, he is obligated to give the valuation of his entire self. In addition, we derive from <b>“persons”</b> that one is obligated to pay only the valuation of a live person, <b>and not</b> the valuation of <b>the dead.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But you have</b> already <b>derived</b> from <b>this</b> term: “Persons [<i>nefashot</i>],” that one who valuates a limb upon which the soul [<i>nefesh</i>] is dependent is obligated to give the valuation of his entire self. The Gemara answers: <b>Read into</b> the verse two derivations, as it could have merely written: <b>Person,</b> and instead it wrote: <b>Persons.</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: Perhaps <b>I should exclude</b> only <b>the dead</b> from valuation, as they no longer possess life [<i>nefesh</i>], <b>but I should not exclude a moribund</b> person, as he is still alive. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Then he shall be set</b> before the priest, <b>and</b> the priest <b>shall value</b> him” (Leviticus 27:8). This teaches that anyone included in the category of setting, i.e., who can stand, is included in the <i>halakha</i> of valuation. But one who is on his deathbed is not included in the <i>halakha</i> of valuation.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so, let me also derive</b> that the <b>dead</b> are not subject to valuation <b>from</b> the same verse: <b>“Then he shall be set</b> before the priest, <b>and</b> the priest <b>shall value</b> him,” as the dead cannot stand. Why do I need to derive this <i>halakha</i> from the fact that the verse wrote: “Persons,” instead of person? The Gemara answers that <b>so too,</b> this is correct, i.e., the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the dead is derived from that same verse. <b>But</b> if that is the case, <b>why do I</b> need the derivation based on the difference between <b>person</b> and <b>“persons”?</b> The Gemara answers that this teaches a different <i>halakha</i>, <b>as we are about to state below,</b> i.e., to add a repulsive man and one afflicted with boils.",
            "The Gemara continues its review of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Alternatively,</b> as the verse states: <b>“Persons,”</b> in the plural, it is expounded as follows. Were the verse to have written only: A person, <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this applies to <b>one</b> person who <b>valuated one</b> person. <b>From where</b> is it derived that even if <b>one</b> person <b>valuated a hundred</b> people, this is also an effective evaluation? Thefore, <b>the verse states: “Persons,”</b> in the plural.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Alternatively,</b> one can expound the plural form of <b>“persons”</b> as follows: Were the verse to have written only: A person, one might have said that <b>I can</b> derive <b>only</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>a man who valuates</b> anyone, <b>whether a man or a woman,</b> as the section begins: “When a man clearly utters a vow” (Leviticus 27:2). <b>From where</b> is it derived that the <i>halakha</i> of valuations also applies to <b>a woman who valuated a man, or a woman who valuated a woman? The</b> same <b>verse states:</b> “Vow of <b>persons</b> to the Lord, according to your valuation” (Leviticus 27:2), to include women.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Alternatively,</b> the word <b>“persons”</b> serves <b>to add a repulsive</b> man <b>and one afflicted with boils.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But you have</b> already <b>derived</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>these</b> cases, i.e., one who valuated a hundred men or a woman who valuated, from “persons.” How, then, can you derive the <i>halakha</i> of a repulsive man and one afflicted with boils from this same word?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>These do not require</b> another <b>verse. What is the reason?</b> Each of these <i>halakhot</i> <b>is equivalent</b> to the others, i.e., each derivation from the word: Person, is equally valid. It teaches that one may valuate a limb that is vital to a person, that both men and women may take a vow of valuation, and that one may vow to give the valuation of multiple people. There is no reason to prefer one of these derivations over the others. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>all of them are derived</b> from the word: Person. <b>When the verse,</b> i.e., the plural term “persons,” <b>is required,</b> it <b>is required</b> only <b>to</b> include <b>a repulsive man and one afflicted with boils.</b>",
            "§ The <i>baraita</i> also teaches that the phrase: <b>“Then your valuation shall be”</b> (Leviticus 27:2), serves <b>to include a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>assessments,</b> despite the fact that they are not included in the <i>halakha</i> of valuations. The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>a verse</b> to include them in the <i>halakha</i> of <b>assessments?</b> Even <b>let</b> this <b>be</b> considered <b>only</b> like the <b>assessment of a tree; were</b> one to <b>say: The assessment of</b> that <b>tree</b> is incumbent upon me, <b>is he not</b> obligated to <b>give</b> its assessment?",
            "<b>Rava said:</b> The verse serves <b>to say that</b> a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite are <b>assessed by</b> the <b>significance</b> of the body part that one specified.

Therefore, the verse teaches that although a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite are not included in valuations, they are nevertheless included in the <i>halakha</i> of being assessed by the significance of the body part in question.",
            "<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>And is it true</b> that one who <b>is not</b> included <b>in valuations is</b> nevertheless <b>assessed by</b> the <b>significance</b> of the body part that he specifies? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that if one says: The <b>head of this slave</b> is <b>consecrated property, he and the Temple</b> treasury are <b>partners in</b> the entire slave. Similarly, if one says to another: The <b>head of</b> this <b>slave</b> is <b>sold to you,</b> they <b>appraise</b> the slave and split the value <b>between them.</b> Likewise, if one says: The <b>head of this donkey</b> is <b>consecrated property, he and the Temple</b> treasury are <b>partners in</b> the donkey.

            "Abaye explains the difficulty that arises from this <i>baraita</i>: <b>But isn’t</b> it the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a donkey and a cow</b> are <b>not</b> included <b>in valuations, and</b> therefore are <b>not assessed by</b> the <b>significance</b> of the body part that is mentioned?

Here we follow the paradigm of valuation, whose payment is also used for Temple maintenance.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>In what</b> manner <b>did you interpret</b> the <i>baraita</i> that discusses consecrating the head of a slave?

Why, then, isn’t the entire animal consecrated?",
            "Rava responds: <b>Rather,</b> both <i>baraitot</i> are referring to items consecrated for the altar, and even so it is <b>not difficult.

            "Rava responds: It is <b>not difficult.

            "Rava responded: <b>We raised</b> this <b>dilemma</b> and entertained the possibility that the entire animal might be sanctified to the altar only <b>in</b> a case where the animal is <b>unblemished,</b> and is therefore fit to be used as an offering.

This extra fraction beyond twenty-nine and a half days is compounded month after month and year after year, and as a result, eventually <b>there is an</b> additional <b>day</b> that must be added to the calendar every three years due to <b>the</b> accumulation of <b>hours, and</b> an additional <b>day</b> that must be added every <b>thirty years</b> due to a further accumulation of the extra parts of an hour. The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> these days do <b>not</b> appear on the calendar <b>every year,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>did not account</b> for them.",
            "§ The Gemara returns to the dispute between Rav Huna and Ulla over the interpretation of the mishna. <b>And Shmuel also holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna,</b> that it is permitted to establish eight full months in a year, <b>as Shmuel says: The year</b> in <b>a lunar</b> calendar has <b>no less than 352 days, and no more than 356 days.</b>",

Does the term “burnt offerings” include <b>both an obligatory burnt offering and a voluntary burnt offering, or perhaps the Merciful One is saying</b> that the trumpets and song must accompany <b>the burnt offerings of the entire Jewish people,</b> i.e., they must be burnt offerings that are an obligation of the people?",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a verse: <b>“And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar, and when the burnt offering began, the song of the Lord began also, and the trumpets, together with the instruments of David king of Israel</b>…And Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises unto the Lord” (II Chronicles 29:27–30). The Gemara analyzes the description of this service: <b>This song, what was its purpose?

Why did Hezekiah need to issue a specific command that they should accompany this offering with song? <b>Rather, is it not</b> the case <b>that</b> this song served to accompany <b>the voluntary burnt offering</b> that Hezekiah brought on that day?",
            "<b>Rav Yosef said: No,</b> that day was a New Moon, and <b>it was the</b> additional <b>burnt offering of the New Moon,</b> an obligatory burnt offering, that was accompanied by the song.

Accordingly, Ezra came to Eretz Yisrael six years after the beginning of the construction of the Temple. It was at that time that the counting of the Sabbatical and Jubilee cycles began.

If the one undergoing purification <b>was a wealthy</b> leper, the one who took the vow <b>brings the offering of a wealthy</b> leper, which is two male sheep, a ewe, and three-tenths of a ephah of fine flour (see Leviticus 14:10).",
            "<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: I say: Even with regard to valuations</b> it is <b>so.</b> He explains: <b>For what</b> reason <b>does a destitute person who valuated a wealthy person give</b> the <b>valuation</b> in accordance with the means <b>of a destitute person?</b> It is due to the fact <b>that the wealthy person is not obligated</b> to pay <b>anything,</b> as the debt was generated by the destitute person who vowed to donate the valuation of a wealthy individual. <b>But</b> in a case similar to that of the offerings of a leper, in the case of <b>a wealthy person who said:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>my valuation, and a destitute person heard</b> him <b>and said:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>that which he said,</b> the destitute person <b>gives the valuation of a wealthy person.</b>",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that affordability is determined in accordance with the means of the one taking the vow. The Gemara asks: The <i>halakha</i> of <b>affordability is</b> written in the Torah <b>with regard to</b> the case of <b>one who valuates,</b> i.e., one who says he will give the Temple treasury the set sum assigned to a particular individual’s age and sex. Why, then, is the mishna referring to affordability in the context of one pledging another’s worth by taking a vow, in which the obligation is calculated individually rather than by predetermined assigned values? The Gemara answers: The mishna employs the language of the verse, which uses the word “vow,” <b>as it is written: “According to the means of him who vowed shall the priest valuate him”</b> (Leviticus 27:8).",
            "Similarly, the Gemara asks: Is the mishna’s wording accurate when it states that the sum of the obligation based on <b>the years</b> of age is <b>in accordance with</b> the age of <b>the subject of the vow?</b> The mishna should state that the sum based on years is determined <b>in accordance with</b> the age of <b>the subject of the valuation,</b> not the vow. The Gemara answers: Although it is discussing valuations, <b>since</b> the mishna uses the term vow <b>when</b> it <b>says: Affordability</b> is determined <b>in accordance with</b> the means of the <b>one taking the vow,</b> the mishna <b>also</b> deploys the same term when it <b>says:</b> The sum of the obligation based on <b>the years</b> of age is <b>in accordance with</b> the age of <b>the subject of the vow.</b>",
            "The mishna further teaches: <b>Affordability</b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the <b>one taking the vow; how</b> so? <b>A destitute person who valuated a wealthy person gives</b> the <b>valuation</b> in accordance with the means of the <b>destitute person.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason? As the verse states: “According to the means of him who vowed,”</b> which teaches that <b>the Merciful One renders</b> the matter <b>dependent on the one who vows,</b> not upon the subject of the vow.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: <b>But with regard to offerings that is not so, as</b> in the case of one <b>who</b> vowed and <b>said:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to provide <b>the offering of this leper,</b> if the one undergoing purification <b>was a destitute leper,</b> the one who vowed <b>brings the offering of a destitute</b> leper. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is this the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though</b> it was <b>a wealthy person who takes the vow</b> to provide the offerings <b>for him?</b> But <b>the Merciful One states: “And if he is poor,</b> and his means do not suffice, then he shall take one sheep” (Leviticus 14:21). This indicates that the specified offering is only for the poor, <b>and</b> in this instance the one taking the vow <b>is not poor.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said:</b> The mishna is referring specifically to a case <b>where it was a poor person who was taking the vow</b> to provide the offerings <b>for</b> the leper. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> what is the basis for this ruling? <b>Perhaps the Merciful One had compassion on him,</b> i.e., the leper, and <b>not on the one taking the vow</b> to provide the offerings <b>for him. As isn’t it written:</b> “And if <b>he</b> is poor”? If so, the leniency that a destitute leper brings less expensive offerings should apply only to an actual leper, and not to one who vows to bring the leper’s offerings, even if he too is poor.",
            "<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said:</b> The next clause in the verse: <b>“And his means do not suffice,”</b> serves <b>to include</b> the <b>one taking the vow</b> to provide the offering, i.e., if he too is poor he provides the offering mandated for a destitute leper.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty with the answer of Rabbi Yitzḥak: <b>But</b> according to this answer, when <b>a wealthy person takes the vow</b> to provide the offering <b>for him, so too,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that he brings</b> the offering of the leper brought <b>in</b> a situation of <b>wealth.</b>",
            "<b>If so, what</b> is the meaning of the mishna’s statement that valuations are determined based on the means of the one making the commitment, <b>but with regard to offerings, that is not so?</b> This clause seems to indicate that unlike the previous ruling, where a wealthy person who valuated a destitute individual gives the valuation in accordance with the means of a wealthy person, here it all depends on the means of the one undergoing purification. Therefore, in this case a wealthy person brings the offerings of one who is destitute, contrary to the statement of Rabbi Yitzḥak."

        [
            "The Gemara explains: The mishna states two different principles with regard to one who vows to provide the offering of a leper on behalf of another. <b>One</b> principle applies <b>to a destitute leper for whom</b> another <b>destitute person takes a vow</b> to provide his offering. In that case, he provides the offering of the destitute. <b>And</b> the <b>one</b> other principle, i.e., the statement that the <i>halakha</i> is different in the case of offerings, serves <b>to exclude</b> the case of <b>a wealthy leper for whom a destitute person takes a vow</b> to provide his offering. In that situation, although the one who took the vow is destitute, he must provide the offering of a wealthy person.",
            "The Gemara explains why this last ruling is necessary. It might <b>enter your mind to say: Since</b> the destitute <b>were included</b> in the verse: “And his means do not suffice,” with regard to the leniency which allows them to bring the offering of the destitute when taking vows to provide for destitute lepers, they should likewise <b>be included</b> in this leniency when providing for all lepers, even wealthy ones. Consequently, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this leniency does not apply when the lepers are wealthy.",
            "Similarly, it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Since we find with regard to valuations</b> that <b>a destitute person who valuated a wealthy person gives</b> the <b>valuation</b> in accordance with the means of <b>a destitute person,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that in <b>this</b> case, where one takes a vow to provide the offering of a wealthy leper, the <i>halakha</i> <b>is also so.</b> Consequently, <b>the verse states: “And if he is poor,”</b> from which it is derived that the offering of the destitute leper is brought only when the leper himself is destitute.",

            "The Gemara explains: The verse serves <b>to exclude</b> the case of <b>a destitute leper for whom a wealthy person takes a vow.</b> In that case, it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: We follow the obligation of the</b> original <b>person</b> specified as the subject of the vow, therefore the wealthy person brings only the offering of the destitute leper. Consequently, the exclusion from the verse: “And if he is poor,” <b>teaches us</b> that in this case he brings the offering of a wealthy individual, not that of the destitute leper.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If when one took a vow of valuation <b>he was destitute and he became wealthy,</b> or if <b>he was wealthy and became destitute, he gives the valuation</b> in accordance with the means of <b>a wealthy person.

            "<b>But with regard to</b> the <b>offerings</b> of a leper <b>that is not so,</b> as the offerings that one brings are determined by his status at the time he brings them. <b>Even</b> if it is common knowledge that <b>his father died and left him</b> an inheritance of <b>ten thousand</b> dinars, <b>or</b> that <b>his ship is at sea and</b> merchandise valued at <b>ten thousand</b> dinars <b>is coming into his</b> possession, <b>the Temple</b> treasury <b>has no</b> share <b>in it.</b> His payment is determined solely by his present situation.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches: If he was <b>destitute</b> when he took the oath <b>and he became wealthy,</b> he gives the valuation appropriate for a wealthy individual. The Gemara explains that this is derived from the verse: “According to <b>the means of him who vowed</b> shall the priest valuate him” (Leviticus 27:8), and in this case he had the means of a wealthy individual when he was ready to give the donation. The mishna further teaches that one who was <b>wealthy and became destitute</b> also gives the valuation as though he was wealthy. The Gemara explains that this is derived from the beginning of the same verse: <b>“According to [<i>al pi</i>] the means</b> of him who vowed shall the priest valuate him.” The phrase <i>al pi</i> serves to emphasize the moment when the person uttered the vow with his mouth [<i>peh</i>], and at that moment he was wealthy.",
            "§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even</b> if one made a valuation when he was <b>destitute and he became wealthy and again became destitute, he gives</b> the <b>valuation</b> according to the means of <b>a wealthy person.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda? The verse states: “But if he is too poor for your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:8). The word order serves to emphasize “he,” which indicates that he is considered poor <b>only if he</b> remains <b>in his</b> state of <b>poverty from his beginning until his end</b> of involvement with the vow.",
            "The Gemara objects: <b>If that is so,</b> then when the verse similarly states with regard to a destitute leper: <b>“And if he is poor”</b> (Leviticus 14:21), <b>so too,</b> Rabbi Yehuda should maintain that he is considered poor <b>only if he is in his</b> state of <b>poverty from his beginning until his end</b> of bringing the leper’s offering, but if he was wealthy in between he should be obligated to bring the offering of a wealthy individual, even if he is now poor.",
            "<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>indeed,</b> this is the <i>halakha</i>, <b>but didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Nega’im</i> 14:11): With regard to <b>a leper who brought his offerings</b> when he was <b>destitute, and</b> subsequently <b>became wealthy,</b> or he brought his offerings when he was <b>wealthy and</b> then <b>became destitute, everything follows</b> the <b>sin offering</b> that the leper brings.

            "<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Everything,</b> i.e., the sin offering and the burnt offering, <b>follows</b> his status at the time the leper’s <b>guilt offering</b> is brought. <b>And</b> it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: Everything follows</b> the offering of the <b>birds,</b> which are brought by the leper seven days earlier as part of his purification process.

            "The Gemara explains: It <b>was stated with regard to this</b> dispute that <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: And</b> all <b>three of these</b> <i>tanna’im</i> <b>derived</b> their opinions <b>from one verse,</b> which deals with the destitute leper: “This is the law of him in whom is the mark of leprosy, <b>whose means do not suffice for that which pertains to his purification”</b> (Leviticus 14:32). <b>Rabbi Shimon holds:</b> The individual’s status depends on <b>an item that atones,</b> and <b>what is it?</b> The <b>sin offering.</b>",

If so, in the particular case of a leper bringing his own offerings, it is a Torah edict that one does not need to be destitute throughout the entire process, which is why, with regard to one who takes a vow to bring the offerings of a leper, Rabbi Yehuda does not derive from the verse: “And if he is poor,” that he is considered poor only if he is in a state of poverty from the beginning, i.e., when he takes the vow, until the end, i.e., when he fulfills it.",

In other words, just as the assessment of a pearl is determined by the pearl’s location in a village of the poor rather than by the potential price of the pearl in the city market, so too, the valuation of a person is determined at the time of the valuation. <b>And</b> similarly, the comparison teaches that the court is required <b>to assess</b> the value of the limb <b>by its significance,</b> i.e., in the case of a limb that is vital to one’s survival, the valuation of the limb is equivalent to the valuation of the whole person.",
            "One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>we should compare valuations to assessments</b> in <b>that</b> the one pledging must <b>give</b> a person’s valuation not corresponding to his value at the time of the pledge but <b>in accordance with</b> his value at <b>the time of giving,</b> as is the case with regard to vows of assessments. To counter this suggestion <b>the verse states: “According to your valuation it shall stand”</b> (Leviticus 27:17), which teaches that the one making the valuation <b>gives</b> his donation <b>only</b> according to the valuation of the person <b>at the time of the valuation,</b> as stated in the mishna.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The Torah provides three age categories that determine the amount of the valuation: From the age of one month until age five, from age five until age twenty, and from age twenty until age sixty. For anyone less than one month old there is no valuation. The halakhic status of the <b>thirtieth day</b> is <b>like</b> that of the period <b>preceding</b> thirty days, and therefore the one who took the vow is exempt.

This verse is understood as follows: The mark reaches from <b>his head, but his head is not included;</b> it reaches to <b>his feet, but his feet are not included.</b> Therefore, one might have thought the prohibition against consuming leaven on the festival of Passover likewise does not apply to the endpoints mentioned in the verse.",
            "Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “You shall eat unleavened bread, <b>until the twenty-first day of the month in the evening”</b> (Exodus 12:18).

If so, <b>why do I</b> need <b>this</b> mention of five years <b>as well:</b> “And if it is <b>from five years old until twenty years old,</b> then your valuation shall be for the male twenty shekels” (Leviticus 27:5)? <b>Therefore,</b> with regard to the fifth year, as both verses mention that year, <b>the</b> verses <b>offset each other.</b> Consequently, even according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi the verbal analogy is necessary.",

The plural form of both “years” and “crops” indicates that the number of years does not necessarily correspond to the quantity of crops. Consequently, there are <b>times when a person</b> might <b>eat three</b> yields of <b>crops in two years.</b> If one purchased a field at the end of the calendar year when its yield had not yet been harvested, and he harvested that yield and subsequently grew and harvested two more crops before the completion of two whole years from the sale, he would have eaten three yields in less than two years.

            "The Gemara states: The <i>halakha</i> that the <b>six years</b> stated <b>with regard to a Hebrew slave</b> is calculated by whole years, not calendar years, is derived from the fact <b>that it is written: “Six years he shall work; and in the seventh</b> he shall go out free for nothing” (Exodus 21:2). The word “and” in the phrase: “And in the seventh,” teaches that <b>sometimes</b> it turns out <b>that he shall also work</b> in the seventh calendar year, if six full years have not passed from when he was sold.

            "<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>Are these</b> two assessments <b>comparable?

            "§ The Gemara relates that there was <b>a certain man who sold his property and</b> later when he <b>divorced his wife</b> he had no property with which to pay the marriage contract. The wife therefore sought to collect payment from the buyers. <b>Rav Yosef, son of Rava, sent</b> the case <b>before Rav Pappa:</b> When a wife’s marriage contract is paid by <b>a guarantor, we learned</b> in the mishna that the husband vows that benefit from her is forbidden to him. Similarly, when she collects her marriage contract from <b>consecrated</b> property, <b>we learned</b> in the mishna that the husband takes such a vow. <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> when she collects payment from <b>a buyer?</b> Rav Pappa <b>said to him: Should the <i>tanna</i> have continued reckoning</b> cases <b>like a peddler,</b> who announces all his wares? Obviously, the <i>halakha</i> is the same in the case of a buyer, as the identical reasoning applies despite the fact that the <i>tanna</i> neglected to mention this case.",
            "The Sages <b>of Neharde’a say: That</b> which <b>we learned</b> in the mishna <b>we learned,</b> and <b>that</b> which <b>we did not learn</b> in the mishna <b>we did not learn,</b> i.e., the husband does not need to make the vow when the payment of the marriage contract is collected from buyers. <b>Rav Mesharshiyya said: What is the reasoning of</b> the Sages <b>of Neharde’a? Granted,</b> when the payment of the marriage contract is collected from <b>consecrated</b> property the husband must make the vow <b>due to</b> the importance of maintaining the <b>profit of the Temple</b> treasury. In the case of <b>a guarantor as well,</b> the husband must make the vow, as the guarantor <b>performed a mitzva and</b> the woman <b>did not lose anything,</b> i.e., the guarantor received nothing from the wife, and he nevertheless accepted responsibility for the payment of the marriage contract. The husband therefore vows in order that others should not be discouraged from performing this mitzva.",
            "<b>But</b> in the case of <b>a buyer, since he knows that each and every</b> married man <b>has upon him</b> the potential obligation to pay <b>a marriage contract, why should he go and purchase</b> a field from the husband when there is a lien on it due to the marriage contract? Since <b>it is he who caused himself to lose</b> out, it is unreasonable to prevent the husband from remarrying his wife merely for the benefit of the buyer.",

Which priestly watch receives the property? <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Ami says in the name of Ḥulfana: One gives it to the watch that leaves</b> the service of the Temple on that Shabbat.",

At this time, all debts and land purchases are abrogated, and consecrated fields that were not redeemed become the property of the priests. Accordingly, if Rosh HaShana occurs on a Shabbat, the priestly watch that ends their service receives the fields, as the priestly watches rotate only in the morning.",
            "The Gemara questions the terminology of the <i>baraita</i>: Why does the <i>baraita</i> state: Except that? This statement indicates that the Sabbatical Year and the Jubilee Year abrogate simultaneously despite the fact that the Jubilee Year abrogates at its beginning. <b>On the contrary,</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>is due to that</b> very reason, i.e., they abrogate simultaneously because the Jubilee Year abrogates at its beginning and the Sabbatical Year at its end. The Gemara explains that in fact one should <b>say</b> the <i>baraita</i> as follows: They abrogate at the same time, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that the Jubilee</b> Year abrogates at its beginning and the Sabbatical Year at its end.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> it is clear that the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year abrogates <b>at its end, as it is written: “At the end of every seven years you shall make a release”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:1). <b>But</b> does the <b>Jubilee</b> Year abrogate <b>at its</b> very <b>beginning?

            "The Gemara responds: The verse <b>is necessary for him for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that discusses the case of one who consecrated his ancestral field and failed to redeem it. This field becomes the possession of the priests at the Jubilee Year. The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> at its end: <b>“As a field dedicated; its possession shall be to the priest”?</b> The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to a priest who consecrated his dedicated field,</b> i.e., a field that was dedicated by an Israelite and was given to him and he then consecrated it, and then the Jubilee Year arrived, <b>that he may not say: Since</b> a field that was consecrated by its owners and was not redeemed <b>goes out</b> of the owner’s possession and passes <b>to</b> the possession of <b>the priests at the Jubilee</b> Year, <b>and</b> this field that I consecrated <b>is</b> already <b>in my possession, it is</b> therefore <b>mine.</b>",

Therefore, <b>the verse states,</b> with regard to an ancestral field that one consecrated: <b>“As a field dedicated; its possession shall be to the priest,”</b> which teaches that this priest does not acquire the field.",

By selling him to a gentile, one prevents him from fulfilling the mitzvot, and by selling him to one who dwells outside of Eretz Yisrael, one prevents him from fulfilling the mitzva of dwelling in Eretz Yisrael. The Sages therefore decreed that the Jewish master must write the slave a bill of manumission after the sale, so that if he runs away from his gentile master, he would not reenter servitude under the Jewish master.",
            "Rav Anan continues: With regard to <b>one</b> of these <i>halakhot</i>, Shmuel said that <b>the sale is retracted</b> and the money is refunded, <b>and</b> with regard to <b>one</b> of them, he said that <b>the sale is not retracted</b> and the buyer loses his money. <b>But I do not know</b> in <b>which of</b> the cases the sale is retracted and in which case it is not.",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> the <i>tanna</i> who maintains <b>the other</b> opinion, that the initial consecration of Eretz Yisrael is eternal, how does he interpret the verse in Nehemiah?

            "The Gemara adds: <b>And this is</b> the reason <b>that the verse criticizes Joshua</b> for not praying for the removal of this inclination himself.
