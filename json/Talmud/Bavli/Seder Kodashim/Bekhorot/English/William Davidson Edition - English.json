            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who purchases the fetus of a donkey that belongs to a gentile, and one who sells</b> the fetus of his donkey <b>to</b> a gentile <b>although he is not permitted</b> to sell a large animal to a gentile, and <b>one who enters into a partnership with</b> a gentile in ownership of a donkey or its fetus, <b>and one who receives</b> a donkey <b>from</b> a gentile in order to care for it in exchange for partnership in its offspring, <b>and one who gives</b> his donkey <b>to</b> a gentile <b>in receivership,</b> in all of these cases the donkeys are <b>exempt from the</b> obligations of <b>firstborn status,</b> i.e., they do not have firstborn status and are not redeemed, <b>as it is stated:</b> “I sanctified to Me all the firstborn <b>in Israel,</b> both man and animal” (Numbers 3:13), indicating that the mitzva is incumbent upon the Jewish people, <b>but not upon others.</b> If the firstborn belongs even partially to a gentile, it does not have firstborn status.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>all these</b> examples in the mishna to demonstrate the principle that a firstborn donkey must belong exclusively to a Jew for the obligations of firstborn status to apply?",
            "The Gemara explains: All of these examples <b>are necessary. As, had</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> that a donkey is exempt from the obligations of firstborn status only in the case where a Jew <b>purchases</b> a fetus from a gentile, <b>I would say</b> that this is <b>because</b> the Jew <b>brings it to</b> a state of <b>sanctity</b> in that it will not be worked on Shabbat. <b>But</b> in the case where a Jew <b>sells</b> the fetus of his donkey to a gentile, <b>where he abrogates</b> its state of <b>sanctity,</b> I would <b>say</b> that the Sages <b>should penalize him [<i>likneseih</i>]</b> for his actions by rendering the fetus subject to the obligations of firstborn status. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that it is exempt from these obligations.",
            "<b>And why do I</b> need the mishna to state the case of <b>one who enters into a partnership with</b> a gentile? The case is necessary <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda, who says:</b> An animal owned in <b>partnership</b> with <b>a gentile is obligated,</b> i.e., subject to accounting its offspring <b>a firstborn.</b> Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us that</b> it <b>is exempt from</b> its offspring being counted <b>a firstborn.</b>",
            "<b>And why do I</b> need the mishna to state that the fetus does not have firstborn status in the case of <b>one who receives</b> a donkey from a gentile in exchange for partnership in its offspring? This <i>halakha</i> is already included in the previous one. The Gemara answers: It is <b>because</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>wants to teach</b> in the parallel case of: <b>And one who gives</b> his donkey <b>to</b> a gentile <b>in receivership,</b> that its offspring does not have firstborn status.",
            "<b>And why do I</b> need the case of <b>one who gives</b> his donkey <b>to</b> a gentile <b>in receivership</b> to be stated? It <b>was necessary,</b> because it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since the primary animal belongs to the Jew,</b> the Sages <b>should penalize him</b> by treating the offspring as a firstborn and requiring it to be redeemed, <b>lest</b> this case <b>be confused with another</b> case of an <b>animal</b> that the Jew puts in the care of a gentile where the gentile does not own rights to the offspring, and the offspring is counted a firstborn. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that he is not penalized.",
            "§ The Gemara cites a discussion where the mishna is used as a proof: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Avoda Zara</i> 14b) with regard to the prohibition against selling large livestock to a gentile due to concern that it will be worked on Shabbat: <b>Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> the sale <b>of a damaged</b> animal <b>permitted</b> because it is incapable of performing labor, <b>and ben Beteira deems</b> the sale <b>of a horse</b> for riding <b>permitted,</b> because riding a horse on Shabbat is not prohibited by Torah law.",
            "<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: With regard to <b>a fetus, what</b> would <b>Rabbi Yehuda say to me</b> about selling it to a gentile? Is the <b>reason that Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> selling the animal <b>permitted there because</b> it is <b>damaged</b> and it cannot work, <b>and a fetus is also damaged</b> in the sense that it cannot work? <b>Or, perhaps</b> it is permitted to sell <b>a damaged</b> animal because <b>that is not its natural</b> state; it is defective and is therefore not included in the prohibition against selling large livestock. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a fetus, since that is its natural</b> state, and it will become capable of working after growing up, perhaps it <b>is not</b> considered <b>damaged,</b> as it is not defective.",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to the dilemma from the mishna: <b>And one who sells</b> the fetus of his donkey <b>to</b> a gentile, his donkey is exempt from the obligations of firstborn status, <b>although</b> the owner <b>is not permitted</b> to do so. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda does not disagree</b> and claim that he may sell it. Apparently, Rabbi Yehuda agrees that it is prohibited to sell the fetus of one’s animal to a gentile.",
            "The Gemara rejects the resolution: <b>And according to your reasoning,</b> concerning the other cases in the mishna, namely, <b>one who enters into a partnership with</b> a gentile, <b>and one who receives</b> a donkey <b>from</b> a gentile in exchange for partnership in its offspring, <b>and one who gives</b> his donkey <b>to</b> a gentile <b>in receivership,</b> with regard to <b>which</b> the mishna <b>does not teach</b> that Rabbi Yehuda disagrees, <b>so too</b> does this indicate <b>that he does not disagree</b> with the ruling in the mishna in these cases? That is impossible, as Rabbi Yehuda holds that an animal subject to a partnership between a Jew and gentile is subject to accounting its offspring a firstborn, as is evident from a <i>baraita</i> that will soon be cited.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> clearly Rabbi Yehuda <b>does disagree, but</b> the mishna <b>does not teach</b> his opinion. <b>Here too,</b> with regard to selling the fetus, <b>he disagrees, but</b> the mishna <b>does not teach</b> his opinion.",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that in the case of <b>one who receives an animal from a gentile</b> in order to care for it and receives some of the offspring in exchange for his work, <b>and it gave birth</b> to a firstborn, <b>they assess its value, and</b> the Jew <b>gives half of its value to the priest</b> to redeem his portion, which is sanctified by the firstborn status. <b>And</b> in the case of <b>one who gives</b> the gentile an animal <b>in receivership even though he is not permitted</b> to do so, the Sages <b>penalize him</b> by requiring that he purchase the gentile’s portion of the animal for <b>up to ten</b> times <b>its value, and he gives all of its value to the priest.</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>What, is it not</b> referring <b>to the fetus</b> when the <i>baraita</i> states that he is not permitted to sell it? The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> it is referring <b>to the animal</b> itself that he may not sell to the gentile, and that is why he is penalized.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach:</b> The Sages penalize him up to ten times <b>its value [<i>damav</i>],</b> in masculine form, indicating that it is referring to the fetus and not the mother? The Gemara responds: <b>Teach</b> the following wording in the <i>baraita</i>: The Sages penalize him up to ten times <b>its value [<i>dameha</i>],</b> in feminine form. The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t it teach: He gives all of its value to the priest? And if</b> it is referring to <b>the animal</b> and not the firstborn, <b>what is the relevance of</b> the priest? The Gemara answers: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the Jew <b>gave</b> the gentile <b>a pregnant animal to fatten it</b> in order to divide the profits as well as the offspring. <b>Since we penalize him for</b> selling <b>the animal</b> in a prohibited manner, <b>we penalize him with regard to the fetus</b> as well.",
            "<b>Rav Ashi says: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> the sale to a gentile of <b>a damaged</b> animal <b>permitted, because it is incapable of being cured.</b> This statement indicates that if it is <b>capable of being cured,</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>deems</b> its sale <b>prohibited. And a fetus</b> is <b>also similar to</b> one who is <b>able to be cured,</b> as it ultimately will be capable of working. <b>Learn from it</b> that Rabbi Yehuda deems the sale of a fetus to a gentile prohibited.",
            "<b>And there are those who teach</b> this discussion as referring <b>to</b> the statement in <b>the mishna:</b> With regard to <b>one who sells</b> the fetus of his donkey <b>to</b> a gentile, <b>although he is not permitted</b> to sell a large animal to a gentile, it is exempt from the obligations of firstborn status. The discussion then proceeded as follows: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Avoda Zara</i> 14b): <b>Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> the sale <b>of a damaged</b> animal <b>permitted</b> because it is incapable of performing labor. The <i>halakha</i> is presumably the same with regard to a fetus, which is also not capable of performing labor.",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> as it is permitted to sell <b>a damaged</b> animal because <b>that is not its natural</b> state; it is defective and is therefore not included in the prohibition against selling large livestock.

            "§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages concerning the prohibition against selling large livestock to a gentile: In the case of a Jew who <b>sold an animal</b> to a gentile only with regard to rights <b>to its fetuses,</b> but retained ownership of the animal itself, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> concerning the permissibility of the sale? The Gemara clarifies: <b>Let the dilemma be raised according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who permits the sale of a damaged animal, and <b>let the dilemma be raised according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who dispute that ruling.",
            "The Gemara elaborates: <b>Let the dilemma be raised according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> as follows: Perhaps <b>Rabbi Yehuda permits only</b> the sale <b>of a damaged</b> animal, <b>as</b> people <b>will not come to confuse</b> this animal with a healthy animal, which is prohibited for sale to a gentile, as they are visibly different. <b>But</b> in the case of one who sells <b>an unblemished</b> animal with regard to the rights to its fetuses, <b>which</b> people may <b>come to confuse</b> with the case of selling the animal entirely and consider that sale permitted as well, Rabbi Yehuda <b>deems</b> the sale <b>prohibited.</b>",
            "<b>Or perhaps</b> Rabbi Yehuda would claim that in the case of <b>a damaged</b> animal, <b>which is separated from him</b> in its entirety in the sale, the sale is permitted, <b>and all the more so</b> with regard to the sale of <b>an unblemished</b> animal with regard to the rights to its fetuses, <b>where</b> the animal <b>is not</b> entirely <b>separated from him,</b> as he did not sell the actual animal, the sale is permitted.",
            "Likewise, <b>the dilemma can be raised according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis:</b> Perhaps <b>the Rabbis deemed</b> the sale <b>prohibited only in</b> a case of <b>a damaged</b> animal, <b>as</b> the animal <b>is separated from him. But</b> in the case of <b>an unblemished</b> animal that is sold only with regard to the fetuses, <b>where it is not separated from him,</b> and there is no concern that people will mistakenly sell the entire animal to a gentile, <b>they deem</b> the sale <b>permitted.</b>",
            "<b>Or perhaps</b> the Rabbis would claim that in the case of <b>a damaged</b> animal, <b>which</b> people <b>will not come to confuse</b> with the case of an unblemished animal, the Rabbis <b>deem</b> the sale <b>prohibited, and all the more so</b> they would prohibit selling <b>an unblemished</b> animal with regard to the rights to its fetuses, <b>which</b> people may <b>come to confuse</b> with the case of selling an unblemished animal in its entirety.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And is the reason of</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis due to that</b> concern that people may confuse the sale of a damaged animal with the sale of an unblemished animal in its entirety? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Yehuda: But</b> why do you hold that is it permitted to sell a damaged animal? <b>Don’t they breed it with</b> another animal, <b>and it gives birth</b> to offspring, which will then be owned by a gentile? <b>Apparently,</b> the reason the Rabbis prohibit the sale <b>is due to</b> the animal’s <b>fetuses.</b> If so, they should prohibit selling large livestock to a gentile with regard to the fetuses as well.",
            "The Gemara answers: This is not truly the Rabbis’ opinion. Rather, <b>this is what they were saying to</b> Rabbi Yehuda: <b>Our reason</b> for prohibiting the sale of a damaged animal is <b>because</b> people might <b>come to confuse</b> this case <b>with</b> the sale of an unblemished <b>animal. But you, what is the reason</b> that <b>you permit</b> selling a damaged animal? It is <b>because</b> the animal is <b>incapable of being cured,</b> and you therefore consider it <b>similar to one who sold</b> an animal explicitly <b>for slaughter,</b> which is permitted.",
            "<b>But</b> actually it is not similar to that case, as <b>don’t they breed</b> a damaged animal <b>with</b> another animal, <b>and it gives birth? And since they breed it and it gives birth,</b> the gentile will <b>delay</b> its slaughter. Others may then mistakenly believe that selling large livestock for purposes other than slaughter is permitted.",
            "<b>And</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>said to</b> the Rabbis in response: <b>When</b> a damaged animal actually <b>gives birth,</b> I will concern myself with this possibility. Practically, this concern may be disregarded, <b>as</b> such an animal <b>cannot breed with a male.</b> In any event, no proof may be brought from this <i>baraita</i> concerning the opinion of the Rabbis concerning selling an animal with regard to the rights to its fetuses.",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the mishna, where it states: <b>And</b> in the case of <b>one who gives</b> his donkey <b>to</b> a gentile <b>in receivership,</b> meaning that he divides the offspring with him in exchange for caring for the animal, the donkey is exempt from the obligations of firstborn status. This case is identical to that of selling an animal with regard to the rights to its fetuses, <b>and</b> the mishna <b>does not teach: Although he is not permitted</b> to do so. Apparently such a sale is permitted.",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>But according to your reasoning,</b> with regard to that which the mishna states: <b>One who enters into a partnership with</b> a gentile, <b>where it</b> also <b>does not teach:</b> Although he is not permitted to do so, <b>so too,</b> should it be derived <b>that</b> it is <b>permitted</b> to enter into such a partnership? <b>But doesn’t Shmuel’s father say: It is prohibited for a person to enter</b> into <b>a partnership with a gentile lest</b> their joint ventures lead them to quarrel and his gentile partner <b>will be obligated to take an oath to him and he will take an oath in the name of his</b> object of <b>idol worship; and the Torah states: “Neither let it be heard out of your mouth”</b> (Exodus 23:13), which includes causing a gentile to take an oath in the name of an idol.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> that <b>a sale</b> to a gentile is not permitted, <b>and the same is true for</b> the case of <b>a partnership.

The Gemara answers <b>that</b> the <b>primary</b> prohibition <b>is</b> that of <b>selling</b> the animal to a gentile.",
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to the dilemma of whether selling an animal to a gentile with regard to the rights to its fetuses is permitted from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that in the case of <b>one who receives an animal from a gentile</b> to care for and receives a portion of the offspring in exchange for his work, <b>and it gave birth</b> to a firstborn, <b>they assess its value, and</b> the Jew <b>gives half of its value to the priest</b> to redeem his portion, which is considered to have the sanctity of a firstborn. <b>And</b> in the case of <b>one who gives</b> the gentile an animal <b>in receivership even though he is not permitted</b> to do so, the Sages <b>penalize him</b> by requiring that he purchase the gentile’s portion of the animal for <b>up to ten</b> times <b>its value, and he gives all of its value to the priest.</b>",
            "<b>And the Rabbis say: As long as the ownership of the gentile is involved,</b> in that he possesses at least partial ownership of the mother or the fetus, the animal <b>is exempt from</b> its offspring being counted <b>a firstborn.</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>What, is</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>not</b> referring <b>to the animal</b> when it prohibits giving it in receivership? If so, the <i>baraita</i> prohibits giving it to the gentile in exchange for half the rights to future fetuses, and certainly giving the gentile rights to all the future fetuses would be forbidden. The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> it is referring <b>to</b> a case of an existing <b>fetus,</b> as the animal is pregnant, and therefore it is prohibited to sell it. It is permitted to sell to a gentile an animal that is not yet pregnant, for the rights to the fetuses alone.",
            "The Gemara comments: The language of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is also precise, as</b> it <b>teaches:</b> The Sages penalize him up to ten times <b>its value [<i>damav</i>],</b> in masculine form, indicating that it is referring to the fetus and not the mother. The Gemara affirms: <b>Learn from it</b> that this is correct, and it cannot be proven from the <i>baraita</i> that it is forbidden to sell rights to a future fetus to a gentile.",
            "The Gemara comments that the language of the <i>baraita</i>: The Sages penalize him up to ten times its value, <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish, as Reish Lakish says:</b> In the case of <b>one who sells large livestock to a gentile,</b> the Sages <b>penalize him,</b> requiring him to repurchase it from the gentile for <b>up to ten times its value.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: Does the phrase: For up to ten times its value, mean <b>specifically</b> this amount and no more, <b>or</b> does it <b>not</b> mean <b>specifically</b> this amount?

The Gemara responds: <b>A slave is different, as each day</b> that he works for the gentile, the gentile <b>restricts him from</b> performing <b>mitzvot.</b> Therefore, one who sells a slave is penalized more severely than one who sells his animal to a gentile.",

            "The Gemara responds: The penalties in these two cases are not the same, as in a case of <b>a sale,</b> the animal is entirely <b>separated from</b> the Jew, while in the case of <b>receivership,</b> it is <b>not</b> entirely <b>separated from him,</b> as the animal still belongs to the Jew. Therefore, the penalty in this case is not as severe.",

The Gemara responds: <b>A slave is different, since</b> the Sages already penalized the owner in that the slave <b>does not return to him.</b> Since the slave will be emancipated once the master redeems him, it may be that the Sages would not penalize him to such a great extent.",
            "The Gemara challenges: Rather, <b>what is the reason</b> that he is penalized in the case of an <b>animal</b> more so than in the case of a slave? Is it <b>because</b> of the fact <b>that it returns to him?</b> If so, <b>he should be penalized</b> only <b>one additional</b> amount. If the difference is that an animal returns to its owners and a slave does not, then the difference in penalties should be reflective of this, and he should have to purchase the animal for no more than eleven times its value. <b>Rather,</b> the Gemara offers a different distinction: The sale of <b>a slave</b> is <b>an uncommon matter, and the Sages did not issue a decree with regard to an uncommon matter.</b> Therefore, one cannot compare the penalty in the case of selling a slave to the penalty in the case of selling an animal.",
            "§ A previously cited <i>baraita</i> (2b) states that if one receives an animal from a gentile to care for and receives a portion of the offspring in exchange, Rabbi Yehuda holds that the Jew’s portion is sanctified with firstborn status. <b>And the Rabbis say</b> that <b>as long as the ownership of the gentile</b> is involved, i.e., he owns a portion of the firstborn animal, it does not have firstborn status. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said: And both of them interpreted</b> the same <b>one verse</b> in accordance with their opinions.

            "The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> an eye as large as that of a calf is considered a blemish <b>because</b> the animal <b>is one that has a limb that is too large [<i>sarua</i>],</b> which is listed in the Torah as one of the blemished animals (see Leviticus 22:23).

            "The reason for the latter <i>halakha</i> is that <b>it is with regard to a person that it is written: “Any man from the offspring of Aaron”</b> (Leviticus 22:4), which indicates <b>that we require a man who is equal to the seed of Aaron,</b> i.e., he has an ordinary appearance like other priests; <b>but</b> with regard to <b>an animal,</b> if <b>both</b> eyes <b>are big</b> or <b>both</b> eyes <b>are small, it is also not a blemish.</b>",
            "Accordingly, if <b>one</b> of the animal’s eyes <b>is big or one is small, what is the reason</b> that it is considered a blemish? <b>If</b> it is <b>due to</b> the <b>deviation</b> in appearance, meaning it does not look like a sheep, then <b>even</b> if <b>both</b> eyes <b>are big</b> or <b>both are small</b> it should be considered a blemish. <b>Rather, is it not because it is</b> an animal <b>with a limb that is too large?</b>",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>No, actually I will say to you</b> that the reason an animal with one big eye and one small eye is considered blemished is <b>because</b> of its <b>deviation,</b> as <b>a deviation is</b> considered <b>a blemish. And</b> as for <b>that which is difficult for you,</b> that if it is due to an anomalous appearance then <b>even</b> if <b>both are big</b> or <b>both are small</b> it should be considered a blemish, <b>there</b> it is not considered a deviation. This is because a particularly healthy animal has large eyes, while a particularly weak animal has small eyes. Therefore, only an animal with one large eye and with one small eye is considered to be blemished, as <b>if</b> the large eye <b>is due to extreme health both should have been healthy,</b> and <b>if</b> the small eye <b>is due to extreme weakness both should have been weak.</b>",
            "§ In connection with the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis whether an animal owned in partnership with a gentile has firstborn status, the Gemara relates the following incident: There was <b>a certain female convert whose</b> gentile <b>brothers would give her animals to fatten</b> and would then divide the profits with her. <b>She came before Rava</b> to ask whether firstborn status applies to the firstborn of these animals. Rava <b>said to her: There is no one who is concerned with this</b> ruling <b>of Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> an animal owned in <b>partnership</b> with <b>a gentile is obligated,</b> i.e., subject to counting its first offspring <b>a firstborn.</b>",

            "§ Rav Safra (4a) referred to the fact that the sanctity of the firstborn donkeys of the Israelites was abrogated by the lambs of the Levites. The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> this abrogation was accomplished <b>with a lamb? Rav Ḥisda says:</b> The word <b>“silver” is stated</b> with regard to the redemption of a woman’s firstborn son <b>for</b> later <b>generations</b> in the verse: “And their redemption money…shall be, according to your valuation, five shekels of silver” (Numbers 18:16). <b>And</b> in addition, the word <b>“lamb” is stated</b> with regard to the redemption of a firstborn donkey <b>for</b> later <b>generations</b> in the verse: “And every firstborn donkey you shall redeem with a lamb” (Exodus 13:13).",

            "The Gemara rejects the comparison: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about silver?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> it is also used for redemption in other cases, as <b>one can redeem consecrated property and second-tithe</b> produce <b>with it,</b> which is not the <i>halakha</i> with regard to lambs.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> it can be derived from the fact that <b>the verse states: “Yet you shall redeem the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of non-kosher animals you shall redeem”</b> (Numbers 18:15).

            "§ The Gemara resumes its discussion of the procedure for the redemption of the firstborn donkeys in the wilderness: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says</b> that <b>one lamb of a Levite</b> in the wilderness <b>rendered several firstborn donkeys of the Israelites exempt</b> from the obligations of firstborn status. <b>Abaye says: Know</b> that this is so, <b>as the verse enumerates the surplus of</b> firstborn <b>humans</b> when it says that there were 273 more firstborn Israelites than Levites who needed to be redeemed with silver (see Numbers 3:46); <b>but</b> the verse <b>does not enumerate</b> any <b>surplus of</b> Israelite <b>animals.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is this proven? <b>Perhaps</b> the Israelites <b>did not have many animals,</b> and their firstborn donkeys did not outnumber the lambs of the Levites.

            "The Gemara challenges: <b>Perhaps even so,</b> the number of <b>ordinary</b> animals <b>of the Levites</b> that were not firstborn <b>corresponded to</b> the number of <b>firstborn</b> animals belonging to <b>the Israelites.</b> The Gemara explains that <b>the verse states:</b> “Take the Levites in exchange for all the firstborn among the children of Israel, <b>and the animal of [<i>behemat</i>] the Levites in exchange for their animals [<i>behemtam</i>]”</b> (Numbers 3:45).

            "The Gemara explains the reason for each opinion: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that the <b>firstborn</b> that were born <b>in the wilderness were sanctified, since the Merciful One states they should be sanctified, as it is written</b> prior to the Jews leaving Egypt: <b>“Sanctify to Me all the firstborn”</b> (Exodus 13:2).",

            "The Gemara comments: <b>This too stands to reason, as if you do not say so, is</b> an infant <b>in its</b> first <b>year capable of performing the</b> sacrificial <b>service?</b> Since the Tabernacle was established only a year after the Jewish people left Egypt, clearly the firstborn who performed the sacrificial service at that time were born in Egypt.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And he who asked it, why did he ask it?</b> Isn’t it obvious that the firstborn born in Egypt performed the sacrificial service in the first years of the Tabernacle?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>This was his difficulty: Granted, if you say that the sanctity of</b> the firstborn <b>did not cease</b> from the time that the mitzva of: “Sanctify to Me all the firstborn” (Exodus 13:2), was given in Egypt, and those born in the wilderness were also sanctified, then with regard to <b>these</b> firstborn <b>who</b> were <b>originally</b> in Egypt, <b>their sanctity also did not lapse.</b> Therefore, they could perform the sacrificial service in the first years of the Tabernacle. <b>But if you say that the sanctity of</b> the firstborn <b>ceased</b> and the firstborn born in the wilderness were not sanctified, then with regard to <b>these</b> firstborn <b>that</b> were <b>originally</b> born in Egypt, <b>their sanctity also lapsed.</b>",
            "<b>And the other</b> <i>amora</i>, Reish Lakish, responded: No proof may be derived from here, as those <b>who were sanctified</b> in Egypt <b>were sanctified</b> and did not then lose their sanctity in the wilderness, while those <b>who were not sanctified</b> in Egypt <b>were not sanctified</b> in the wilderness.",
            "Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>raised an objection to</b> the opinion of Reish Lakish from a <i>baraita</i>: On <b>the same day that the Tabernacle was established,</b> many types of offerings <b>were sacrificed by the Jewish people,</b> including <b>vow</b> offerings <b>and gift</b> offerings, <b>sin offerings and guilt offerings,</b> kosher <b>firstborn</b> animal offerings <b>and</b> animal <b>tithe</b> offerings.

            "§ With regard to the abrogation of the sanctity of the firstborn in the wilderness by the Levites, the Gemara relates that <b>Kontrokos the officer asked Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai: In</b> the <b>individual</b> count <b>of</b> each family of <b>Levites you find</b> that there were <b>22,300</b> (see Numbers 3:22–34).

            "Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <b>said to him:</b> The total sum includes only those Levites who redeemed the Israelite firstborn. <b>Those</b> additional <b>three hundred</b> Levites <b>were</b> themselves <b>firstborns, and a firstborn</b> Levite <b>cannot abrogate</b> the sanctity of <b>a firstborn</b> Israelite. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason? Abaye says:</b> It <b>is sufficient for</b> a Levite <b>firstborn to abrogate his own</b> firstborn <b>sanctity.</b>",
            "<b>Additionally,</b> Kontrokos <b>asked</b> Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai: <b>With regard to the collection of silver</b> by Moses for the Tabernacle, <b>you find</b> that the total amount is <b>201 talents and eleven <i>maneh</i>, as it is written</b> that they amassed: <b>“A <i>beka</i> a head, that is, half a shekel, of the shekel of the Sanctuary</b>…for 603,550 men” (Exodus 38:26), which totals 301,775 shekels.

            "Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <b>said to him: Moses, our teacher, was a trustworthy treasurer and was expert in accounting, but a <i>maneh</i> of the Sanctuary,</b> which was used to measure the one hundred talents used for the sockets, <b>was double</b> the value of a standard <i>maneh</i>, i.e., fifty shekels instead of twenty-five shekels. Therefore, the one hundred talents given by Moses were equivalent to the two hundred talents that he collected from the Jewish people.",
            "<b>Rav Aḥai discusses it: What posed a difficulty for</b> Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai that forced him to offer this answer? Was it the verse: <b>“And the hundred talents of silver were for casting</b> the sockets of the Sanctuary” (Exodus 38:27)? If so, one can explain that <b>these</b> one hundred talents were designated <b>for casting</b> the sockets, <b>and the other</b> one hundred talents that are not mentioned here were placed in <b>the treasury.</b> The Gemara answers that <b>another verse is written</b> that discusses the total sum collected, and only one hundred talents are mentioned: <b>“And the silver of those that were numbered of the congregation was a hundred talents”</b> (Exodus 38:25).",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>that which</b> Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <b>said to</b> Kontrokos, that <b>a <i>maneh</i> of the Sanctuary was double</b> the value of a standard <i>maneh</i>, <b>from where does he</b> derive this?",
            "<b>If we say</b> that it is derived <b>from</b> the verse <b>itself</b> that Kontrokos mentioned (Exodus 38:27), then the derivation would be <b>as</b> follows: In addition to the one hundred talents, additional silver coins are mentioned <b>here</b> that equal <b>seventy-one <i>maneh</i>,</b> as it is stated: <b>“And of the 1,775 shekels he made hooks for the pillars”</b> (Exodus 38:28), which is equal to one talent, or sixty <i>maneh</i>, plus an additional eleven <i>maneh</i>, <b>and the verse counted them only</b> using the value <b>of small coins,</b> i.e., shekels, and not in talents. <b>And if it is so</b> that a <i>maneh</i> of the Sanctuary was of equal value to a common <i>maneh</i>, then the verse <b>should have</b> expressed this value using larger coins, writing: <b>101 talents and eleven <i>maneh</i>.</b>",
            "<b>Rather, since the verse counts</b> this value <b>only</b> using the value <b>of small coins, learn from it</b> that <b>a <i>maneh</i> of the Sanctuary was double</b> the value of a standard <i>maneh</i> and equaled fifty shekels. Therefore, the 1,775 shekels mentioned are worth only 35½ <i>maneh</i>, which is less than a full talent, or sixty <i>maneh</i>.",
            "The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>But perhaps</b> the total amount of shekels does equal the amount of a talent, but the verse <b>calculates the general</b> amounts, i.e., the hundreds of talents, <b>in talents,</b> and the verse <b>does not calculate the details,</b> i.e., any amount less than one hundred talents, <b>in talents,</b> but in shekels.",
            "<b>Rather, the principle</b> that a <i>maneh</i> of the Sanctuary is double the value of a common <i>maneh</i> is derived <b>from here: “And the brass of the offering was seventy talents and 2,400 shekels”</b> (Exodus 38:29). The Gemara explains: Aside from the seventy talents mentioned, <b>there are</b> an additional <b>ninety-six <i>maneh</i> here,</b> which is equivalent to one talent and an additional thirty-six <i>maneh</i>, <b>and the verse counts them only</b> using the value <b>of small coins. Learn from it</b> that <b>a <i>maneh</i> of the Sanctuary was double</b> the amount of a standard <i>maneh</i>, and that is why the number of shekels mentioned did not equal a full talent.",
            "The Gemara rejects this proof as well: <b>But perhaps</b> the verse is referring to a standard <i>maneh</i>, and the verse <b>calculates a large unit,</b> i.e., tens of talents, <b>in talents,</b> while the verse <b>does not calculate a small unit,</b> i.e., any amount less than ten talents, <b>in talents.</b>",
            "<b>Rather, Rav Ḥisda says</b> the claim that a <i>maneh</i> of the Sanctuary was double the size of a standard <i>maneh</i> is derived <b>from here: “And the shekel shall be twenty <i>gera</i>; twenty shekels, twenty-five shekels, ten, and five shekels, shall be your <i>maneh</i>”</b> (Ezekiel 45:12). In this verse, Ezekiel defines the various weights used in the Temple and states that each silver shekel consists of twenty <i>gera</i>. In addition, the combination of twenty, twenty-five, ten, and five shekels yields a total sum of sixty shekels, which is the value of a <i>maneh</i>. A <i>maneh</i>, in turn, is equivalent to one hundred dinars."

        [
            "<b>But</b> each shekel consists of four dinars, and therefore sixty shekels <b>is</b> equivalent to <b>two hundred and forty</b> dinars, not a <i>maneh</i>, which is generally worth one hundred dinars. <b>Rather, learn from</b> this verse a number of matters: First, learn that the <b><i>maneh</i> of the Sanctuary</b> to which Ezekiel was referring <b>was a <i>maneh</i></b> that was <b>double</b> its standard value. Therefore, it was worth fifty shekels, which is equivalent to two hundred dinars.",
            "<b>And</b> furthermore, as Ezekiel stated that the <i>maneh</i> will be sixty dinars, not fifty, <b>learn from it</b> that a community may <b>increase measures, but they may not increase</b> them by <b>more than one-sixth.

Therefore, adding one-fifth of the original fifty shekels, which is ten shekels, to the total equals sixty shekels.

            "§ The Gemara returns to discussing the redemption of firstborn donkeys: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: I asked Rabbi Eliezer in the great study hall:</b> In <b>what</b> way <b>are firstborn donkeys different from firstborn horses and camels,</b> i.e., other non-kosher animals, which are not redeemed?

The Gemara comments that this answer is <b>like</b> one side of a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>: Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that <b>its</b> actual <b>name</b> was <b>Rephidim. Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> This moniker is an allusion to the fact <b>that</b> the Jewish people <b>became lax [<i>rippu</i>] with regard to the statements of the Torah</b> in Rephidim, <b>and so it says: “The fathers look not back to their children because of feebleness [<i>rifyon</i>] of hands”</b> (Jeremiah 47:3).",
            "<b>And furthermore, I</b> also <b>asked him</b> the following question: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>the term “Shittim”</b> in the verse: “And Israel dwelled in Shittim” (Numbers 25:1)? <b>And he said to me</b> that <b>Shittim</b> was <b>its name.</b> The Gemara comments that this answer is <b>like</b> one side of a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>: Rabbi Eliezer says: Shittim</b> is <b>the</b> actual <b>name of</b> the place. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> This moniker is an allusion to the fact <b>that they were engaged in matters of nonsense [<i>shetut</i>],</b> i.e., prostitution and idol worship (see Numbers, chapter 25).",
            "The same <i>tanna’im</i> also dispute the meaning of another verse discussing that incident. With regard to the verse: <b>“And they called [<i>vatikrena</i>] the people to the offerings of their gods”</b> (Numbers 25:2), <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Naked women encountered them,</b> which is how they were convinced to engage in idol worship. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says that they all became those who experienced seminal emissions [<i>kerayyin</i>]</b> resulting from the lust they experienced.",

Therefore, the phrase “the firstborn of an ox” is interpreted as teaching <b>that it must be an ox and its firstborn</b> must be <b>an ox</b> in order for firstborn status to apply. Likewise, the phrase <b>“the firstborn of a lamb”</b> teaches <b>that it must be a lamb and its firstborn a lamb,</b> and not another animal.

            "One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> if the offspring <b>has some of the characteristics</b> of the mother it should still be exempt, as it does not entirely resemble the mother.

Therefore, Rabbi Yehuda holds that deriving benefit from a firstborn donkey is forbidden.",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> this contradicts Rabbi Yehuda’s ruling with regard to second-<b>tithe</b> produce, concerning <b>which the Torah was particular about its</b> being redeemed only <b>with a minted coin, and we learned</b> in a mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If one betrothed a woman with second-tithe produce, if he did so <b>intentionally, he has betrothed</b> her. Apparently, he maintains that deriving benefit from second-tithe produce is not prohibited prior to redemption.",
            "The Gemara answers: That is not proof, as according to Rabbi Yehuda, if a man betrothed a woman <b>with a firstborn donkey, she is also betrothed.

She is therefore betrothed with the benefit of that future consumption.",
            "<b>Here too,</b> where one betroths a woman with a firstborn donkey, the betrothal is effective despite the fact that it is prohibited to derive benefit from the animal.

The Gemara answers that <b>Ulla says: Do you have an item whereby its redemption,</b> i.e., the item with which it is redeemed, <b>is permitted, but</b> the item itself <b>is forbidden?</b> Here too, since the lamb that is given to the priest is permitted, the donkey that it redeems should have been permitted as well prior to the redemption.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is there <b>not</b> such a case? <b>But isn’t</b> there the case of selling produce from the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year? <b>As its redemption,</b> i.e., the money received in exchange for the produce, <b>is permitted.

The verse continues: <b>“Nor shear the firstborn of your flock,” but you may shear</b> a firstborn animal that is <b>yours and</b> that is also <b>that of others.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> the verse should be interpreted as follows: <b>“You shall do no work with the firstborn of your ox,” but you may do work with</b> a woman’s <b>firstborn son,</b> as no prohibition exists with regard to deriving benefit from the labor of a firstborn boy even before he is redeemed. <b>“Nor shear the firstborn of your flock,” but you may shear a firstborn donkey,</b> as deriving benefit from it is permitted. Rabbi Yehuda, who does not interpret the verse in this manner, holds that it is prohibited to shear and derive benefit from a firstborn donkey as well.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon, that is</b> the reason <b>that two verses,</b> i.e., phrases, <b>are written,</b> one that excludes a woman’s firstborn son from the prohibition against deriving benefit and another that excludes a firstborn donkey. <b>But according to Rabbi Yehuda, why do I</b> need <b>two verses to exclude</b> a firstborn animal that is <b>yours and</b> that is also <b>that of others,</b> i.e., owned jointly by a Jew and a gentile, from the prohibition against deriving benefit from the firstborn? <b>And furthermore, according to Rabbi Yehuda, shall we say</b> that deriving benefit from a woman’s <b>firstborn son</b> should <b>also be forbidden,</b> since it was not excluded by any verse?",
            "<b>Rather, everyone</b> agrees that the term <b>“your ox” comes to exclude</b> a woman’s <b>firstborn son,</b> from whom it is permitted to derive benefit. <b>When they disagree,</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> the term <b>“your flock.” As Rabbi Yehuda</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as he says</b> that an animal that is owned in <b>partnership</b> with <b>a gentile is obligated in a firstborn,</b> i.e., subject to the requirement that its owner count its offspring as a firstborn, <b>and</b> therefore <b>the verse was necessary to permit shearing and</b> using the animal for <b>labor.</b>",
            "<b>And Rabbi Shimon holds</b> that an animal owned in <b>partnership</b> with <b>a gentile</b> is <b>exempt from</b> its offspring being counted <b>a firstborn, and</b> therefore <b>with regard to shearing and labor, no verse was necessary.</b> Rather, <b>the verse was necessary to</b> exclude the case of <b>a firstborn donkey</b> from the prohibition against shearing and working the firstborn animal.",

            "The Gemara clarifies: <b>According to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon you should not raise the dilemma, since he says</b> that prior to the redemption it is <b>permitted</b> for the owner <b>to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from the firstborn donkey by using it for labor or renting it out. Therefore, it is <b>the property of the owner,</b> and giving a lamb to the priest does not change this status. <b>When you raise the dilemma,</b> it should be <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that it is <b>prohibited to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from the firstborn donkey prior to its redemption. If so, it does not belong to the owner initially, and only redeeming the donkey with the lamb allows him to take possession of it.",

            "<b>Rav Naḥman said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who steals the firstborn donkey of another</b> before it is redeemed and he is then caught, <b>he pays the payment of double</b> the principal <b>to the owner</b> (see Exodus 22:3). <b>And even though</b> the owner <b>does not have</b> rights to the donkey <b>now, he does have</b> rights to it <b>afterward,</b> i.e., after the redemption.",
            "The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Whose</b> opinion does this follow? <b>If we say</b> that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, why does</b> the owner <b>not have</b> rights to it <b>now?</b> Rabbi Shimon holds that it is permitted to derive benefit from a firstborn donkey even before its redemption. <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who deems it prohibited to derive benefit from a firstborn donkey prior to its redemption.",
            "<b>And if it enters your mind</b> that <b>we compare it to consecrated</b> property, then why must the thief pay double the principal?

Evidently, a firstborn donkey does not have the status of consecrated property, and if another person redeemed it, it still belongs to the owner. The Gemara concludes: <b>And nothing more</b> remains to be said about this issue, as this is a clear proof.",
            "§ The mishna states that if a person owned two donkeys, and <b>one had</b> previously <b>given birth and one had not</b> previously <b>given birth,</b> and they gave birth to a male and a female, and it is not clear which donkey gave birth to the male and which to the female, he designates one lamb as redemption due to the uncertainty, as perhaps the one that had not previously given birth was the one that gave birth to the male. The mishna also states that this lamb is tithed with the other non-sacred animals. With regard to this point, the Gemara states that <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In what case did</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that this lamb <b>enters the pen in order to be tithed?</b>",
            "<b>You cannot say</b> that this is referring to a case <b>where</b> the lamb had already <b>entered the possession of a priest, as we learned</b> in a mishna (55b): An animal <b>that was purchased</b> by a person <b>or that was given to him as a present is exempt from animal tithe,</b> and this lamb was given as a present to the priest. <b>Rather,</b> it is referring <b>to an Israelite who has ten donkeys in his house</b> whose <b>firstborn</b> status is <b>uncertain, who designates ten lambs for them</b> in order to redeem them due to the uncertainty, <b>and he tithes</b> those lambs as well, <b>and they are his.</b>",
            "The Gemara comments that this <i>baraita</i> <b>supports</b> the statement <b>of Rav Naḥman, as Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says: An Israelite who has</b> in his house <b>ten donkeys</b> whose <b>firstborn</b> status is <b>uncertain designates ten lambs</b> to redeem them, <b>and tithes</b> the lambs, separating one as a tithe, <b>and they</b> all <b>belong to him,</b> as a priest cannot prove that he is entitled to any of the ten.",

            "Therefore, his grandson, who inherits these donkeys and is an Israelite, <b>designates ten lambs for them and tithes them and they are his,</b> as if his grandfather had designated the lambs himself and bequeathed them to him.",

            "The Gemara comments that both rulings of Rav Naḥman, i.e., the one concerning firstborn donkeys and the one concerning untithed produce, are <b>necessary. Because had he taught us</b> only <b>the first</b> case, i.e., that of the firstborn donkeys, one could claim that perhaps only in that case the Israelite grandson may keep the lambs; it is considered as if his grandfather who was a priest designated the lambs and acquired them <b>because</b> they <b>stand separated.</b> An act of separation would have been unnecessary, as the priest could have simply declared that his own lambs were serving to redeem the donkeys.",
            "<b>But here,</b> with regard to the untithed produce, one must separate the <i>teruma</i> and declare it as such in order for the priest to acquire it. Therefore, perhaps <b>gifts</b> to which members of the priesthood are entitled <b>that were not separated are</b> treated <b>as if they were not separated,</b> even if they were already in the possession of a priest.

            "The mishna continues: <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Everyone agrees</b> that one is obligated <b>to separate</b> <i>teruma</i> and tithes from the produce that the gentile returned to him. <b>When they disagree</b> it is <b>with regard to giving it to the priest</b> following the separation. <b>The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that the gentile <b>certainly exchanged</b> the produce, <b>and</b> therefore the owner <b>needs to give</b> the <i>teruma</i> <b>to the priest.

            "Rav Yosef responded: <b>No, it must be buried like</b> a woman’s <b>firstborn son.</b> There is a mitzva to bury a woman’s firstborn son if he dies, and due to the comparison of the verse, the same applies to a firstborn donkey.

Rather, <b>from</b> the fact that in <b>the first clause, pulling does not effect acquisition,</b> in <b>the latter clause too, pulling does not effect acquisition. But since the first clause taught</b> the word: <b>Pulled,</b> in order to teach that this method is ineffective, <b>the latter clause also taught</b> the word: <b>Pulled,</b> despite the fact that its mention is unnecessary.",
            "<b>Ravina said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is discussing a case where it was agreed that the transaction would be subject to Jewish law. <b>From</b> the fact that in <b>the latter clause, pulling effects acquisition,</b> in <b>the first clause too, pulling effects acquisition. And</b> as for the difficulty with regard to <b>the first clause,</b> which states that the Jew may return the item even though he already pulled it, <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: If</b> the buyer <b>did not give</b> the money to the gentile <b>and</b> also <b>did not pull</b> the item, <b>he returns</b> the item to the seller. The Gemara adds: <b>What</b> does the term: <b>Returns,</b> mean in this context? It means that the Jew <b>returns,</b> i.e., reneges, <b>on</b> his <b>verbal</b> commitment. In other words, he is not required to complete the purchase despite the fact he initially agreed to do so.",
            "The Gemara elaborates: It was necessary for the <i>tanna</i> to teach this explicitly, as <b>he holds:</b> Reneging on <b>a verbal</b> commitment that was unaccompanied by an act of acquisition <b>constitutes an act of bad faith</b> between two parties. <b>And</b> he holds that <b>this statement</b> applies only to a case where <b>a Jew</b> purchases an item <b>from</b> another <b>Jew, as they</b> are assumed to <b>uphold their verbal</b> commitments. <b>But</b> in a case of <b>a Jew</b> who purchases an item <b>from gentiles, as they</b> are <b>not</b> assumed <b>to uphold their verbal</b> commitments, reneging on one’s word does <b>not</b> constitute an act of bad faith between the parties, since neither party relies upon the commitment of the other in the first place."

The <i>baraita</i> answers that <b>the verse states: “However,</b> as you eat the gazelle and the hart.” The term “however” <b>differentiates,</b> i.e., it serves to limit the analogy between these animals to the mitzvot of the firstborn and the gifts, and not forbidden fat.",

            "<b>Rav Pappa said</b> another question <b>to Abaye: If</b> one accepts the analogy between disqualified consecrated animals and the animals mentioned in the verse, then one can claim as follows: <b>Just as</b> the prohibition against slaughtering an animal <b>itself and its offspring</b> on the same day <b>does not apply to a gazelle and a hart, so too,</b> the prohibition against slaughtering an animal <b>itself and its offspring</b> should <b>not apply to disqualified consecrated</b> animals.

And if</b> you are comparing them <b>to sacrificial</b> animals, the prohibition against slaughtering an animal <b>itself and its offspring</b> also <b>applies to them.</b> Since all domesticated animals are subject to the prohibition against slaughtering a mother and its offspring, one cannot derive the exclusion of disqualified consecrated animals from this verse.",

And</b> if you are comparing them <b>to sacrificial</b> animals, <b>their fat is</b> also <b>forbidden.</b> Since the prohibition of fat also applies to both consecrated and non-sacred animals, by the same reasoning there is no need for the verse to teach that the prohibition of fat applies. Nevertheless, the <i>baraita</i> derives this <i>halakha</i> from the word “however.”",
            "<b>Rather, didn’t you say</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>“However,” but not their fat?

Instead, both exclusions are derived equally from the word “however,” which serves to differentiate disqualified consecrated animals from the gazelle and the hart both with regard to forbidden fat and with regard to the prohibition against slaughtering a mother and its offspring. Interpreting the exclusion in this manner means that disqualified consecrated animals are at least comparable to sacrificial animals in that they are excluded from the mitzva of the firstborn and the priestly gifts. Had the exclusion been interpreted with regard to the mitzva of the firstborn and the priestly gifts, disqualified consecrated animals would not be comparable to any type of animal.",

            "The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> in that case, <b>let the Merciful One write: Its fat,</b> instead of “its blood.” The Gemara explains: <b>If the Merciful One had written fat, I would say: The juxtaposition</b> between disqualified consecrated animals and a gazelle and a hart <b>is effective</b> with regard to fat, <b>and the verse</b> itself <b>is</b> also <b>effective,</b> i.e., it can be derived from the juxtaposition and the verse together that the prohibition of fat applies to disqualified consecrated animals to a certain extent, but not fully.",
            "The Gemara elaborates: <b>The juxtaposition is effective in</b> that it <b>excludes</b> one who eats the fat of consecrated animals <b>from</b> the punishment of <b>excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>].</b> The reason is <b>that when</b> the Merciful One <b>writes “<i>karet</i>,” it is written with regard to one who eats the fat of a domesticated animal, as it is stated: “For anyone who eats the fat of the domesticated animal…</b>even the soul that eats it shall be excised from his people” (Leviticus 7:25).

            "The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter,</b> that the offspring of a sacrificial animal is imbued with inherent sanctity, derived? It is derived from a verse, <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And if his offering be a sacrifice of peace offerings: If he sacrifice of the cattle, whether male or female, he shall sacrifice it without blemish before the Lord” (Leviticus 3:1), that the words “male” and “female” are extraneous, as the term “cattle” includes both. Consequently, <b>“male”</b> serves <b>to include the offspring</b> of a peace offering; <b>“or female”</b> serves <b>to include the</b> female animal that is designated as <b>a substitute</b> for a peace offering.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And I have</b> derived this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> with regard to <b>the offspring of unblemished</b> animals <b>and the substitute of unblemished</b> animals. <b>From where</b> do I derive that the same <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>the offspring of blemished</b> animals <b>and the substitute of blemished</b> animals? <b>When</b> the verse <b>states: “Whether male,”</b> this serves <b>to include the offspring of blemished</b> animals, in a case where its consecration preceded its blemish, and when the verse states: <b>“Or female,”</b> it serves <b>to include the substitute of blemished</b> animals.",
            "The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>those offspring that</b> were born <b>after their</b> mother’s <b>redemption, what will be with them,</b> since they can be neither sacrificed nor redeemed? Before providing an answer, the Gemara notes: If they were born <b>before their</b> mother’s <b>redemption,</b> the Sages <b>disagree with regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i>. <b>There is one who says: They are</b> entirely <b>consecrated,</b> to the extent that they may <b>be sacrificed, and there is one who says: They are consecrated to graze</b> until a blemish befalls them so that they can be redeemed, but they may not be sacrificed.",
            "The Gemara returns to the previous inquiry: With regard to those <b>that</b> were born <b>after their</b> mother’s <b>redemption, what will be with them? Rav Huna says: One gathers them into a chamber, and they die</b> of starvation. The reason is <b>that what</b> are we <b>to do? Shall we sacrifice them?</b> They cannot be sacrificed, as <b>they received</b> their status <b>from</b> the <b>deferred sanctity</b> of the redeemed mother, and are therefore unfit for the altar. <b>Shall we redeem them?</b> They cannot be redeemed, as their sanctity <b>is not strong</b> enough <b>to be transferable</b> to money for <b>their redemption.</b>",
            "<b>They said in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina:</b> Immediately <b>before their redemption, one dedicates them for the sake of the same offering</b> for which their mother was consecrated.

            "<b>Ravina raised a dilemma before Rav Sheshet:</b> According to Rabbi Ḥanina, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the following matter: <b>Can one dedicate</b> the unborn offspring <b>as any offering he desires?</b> Rav Sheshet <b>said to him: He may not dedicate them</b> as any offering other than that for which the mother was consecrated. Ravina asked: <b>What is the reason?</b> Rav Sheshet <b>said to him:</b> It is <b>derived</b> by a verbal analogy between the phrase: <b>“Within</b> all <b>your gates”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:15), and: <b>“Within your gates”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:22), written <b>with regard to a firstborn.

            "The Gemara notes: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Sheshet: Sacrificial</b> animals <b>whose permanent blemish preceded their consecration and</b> that <b>were redeemed, are obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>a firstborn, and</b> obligated <b>in the gifts.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>How can you find</b> a situation that includes both of these inferences?

            "<b>Rav Huna</b> could have <b>said to you:</b> The inferences upon which the refutation is based are false.

            "It is stated: <b>And one who slaughters them outside</b> the Temple courtyard is <b>exempt</b> from <i>karet</i>. The Gemara notes: <b>Rav Huna taught</b> this as: One who slaughters them outside the Temple courtyard <b>is liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i>, <b>and he interprets it</b> as referring to a case involving an animal with a minor blemish, such as <b>on the cornea of the eye.

Since an animal with a minor blemish is potentially suitable for sacrifice, one who slaughters it outside the Temple courtyard is liable to receive <i>karet</i>.",
            "The Gemara continues analyzing the <i>baraita</i>, which teaches: <b>Whether before its redemption or after its redemption,</b> an animal whose consecration preceded its blemish <b>renders</b> an animal that was <b>a substitute</b> for it sacred. <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says: And its substitute</b> that was imbued with sanctity <b>after its redemption</b> must <b>die.

The Gemara explains the question: <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Temura</i> 21a): With regard to <b>the substitute of a firstborn and</b> of an animal <b>tithe</b> offering, both <b>they,</b> the substitutes themselves, <b>and their offspring, and the offspring of their offspring, forever,</b> i.e., for all future generations, <b>are like</b> the <b>firstborn and</b> the animal <b>tithe</b> offering, respectively, <b>and</b> therefore <b>they are eaten in their blemished</b> state <b>by the owners.</b> Why is the blemished substitute of a firstborn or an animal tithe permitted whereas the substitute of a disqualified consecrated animal remains forbidden?",
            "<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Amram: <b>This one bears its mother’s name and that one bears its mother’s name,</b> i.e., each substitute is subject to the same <i>halakha</i> as the animal for which it was substituted. <b>This</b> animal <b>is entirely called a substitute of a firstborn or</b> an animal <b>tithe</b> offering: <b>Just as a firstborn and</b> an animal <b>tithe</b> offering <b>are eaten in their blemished</b> state <b>by the owners, so too, their substitute is eaten</b> even when it is blemished.",

            "The Gemara raises a further objection: The <i>halakha</i> of <b>a substitute for a guilt offering is also a <i>halakha</i> learned</b> as a tradition, as stated in the principle: <b>In any</b> case <b>where a sin offering</b> is left to <b>die, a guilt offering</b> is left to <b>graze.</b> Since the substitute of a sin offering is left to die, it is established by tradition that the substitute of a guilt offering is left to graze, and therefore no verse is required to teach this <i>halakha</i>.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> the verse is <b>actually</b> the source for a <i>halakha</i> that applies to the <b>five sin offerings</b> left to <b>die.

            "Abaye <b>raised an objection to</b> the opinion of Rabbi Yirmeya from a mishna (<i>Para</i> 9:7): If the <b>ashes</b> of a red heifer, which impart ritual impurity to the priests involved in its ritual and are <b>fit</b> for sprinkling on someone impure with impurity imparted by a corpse, <b>became intermingled with</b> regular <b>burned ashes, we follow the majority</b> in order <b>to</b> determine whether or not the mixture is <b>impure. And</b> therefore, <b>if</b> the <b>majority is</b> composed of the regular <b>burned ashes,</b> the mixture does <b>not impart impurity.</b> Abaye explains the objection: <b>And if you say</b> nullified <b>impurity is considered like an item that is</b> nevertheless present in the mixture and can be revived, then <b>although</b> the mixture <b>does not impart impurity through</b> physical <b>contact</b> as it is assumed that one touches the majority, <b>let it impart impurity through carrying</b> due to the ashes of the red heifer.",
            "Rav Dimi responded: In fact, <b>it was stated with regard to that</b> mishna that <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> The mixture is <b>pure</b> in the sense that it does not <b>impart impurity through contact, but it</b> does <b>impart impurity through carrying.</b>",
            "Abaye responded: <b>But doesn’t Rav Ḥisda say:</b> If meat from an animal carcass, which imparts ritual impurity, was mixed with the meat of a slaughtered animal, the meat from the <b>carcass is nullified by</b> the meat of the <b>slaughtered animal</b> in the event that the ritually pure meat constitutes a majority. The reason is <b>that it is impossible for a carcass to become a slaughtered</b> animal, i.e., a ritually slaughtered animal can never have the status of a carcass with regard to impurity. Abaye explains the difficulty: <b>Granted that it does not impart impurity through contact,</b> but if the impurity is considered present to some extent <b>let</b> the mixture <b>impart impurity through carrying.</b>",
            "Rav Dimi <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>You learned</b> the mishna <b>according to</b> the interpretation of <b>Rav Ḥisda,</b> but <b>we learned it according to</b> the interpretation of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> as <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches:</b> With regard to meat from <b>an animal carcass and</b> meat from <b>a slaughtered</b> animal, <b>one nullifies the other,</b> depending on the majority. <b>And it was stated with regard to this</b> ruling that <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> If the majority is from a slaughtered animal the mixture is <b>pure</b> in the sense that it does not <b>impart impurity through contact, but it</b> does <b>impart impurity through carrying.</b>",
            "Abaye raised another difficulty: <b>And that which we learned</b> in our mishna contradicts your opinion, as <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says:</b> In the case of <b>a large animal that expelled a mass of</b> congealed <b>blood, that</b> mass <b>must be buried, and</b> the animal <b>is exempt from</b> having any future offspring counted <b>a firstborn. And Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches</b> with regard to this ruling: That mass <b>does not impart</b> ritual <b>impurity,</b> neither <b>through</b> physical <b>contact nor through carrying.</b> But <b>why?</b> If Rav Dimi is correct, then <b>granted it does not impart impurity through contact,</b> but <b>let it</b> nevertheless <b>impart impurity through carrying.</b> Rav Dimi <b>was silent</b> in response.",
            "The Gemara asks: Why was Rav Dimi silent? <b>Perhaps</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>is different here, as it is decayed impurity,</b> since an animal carcass that has rotted does not impart impurity at all. The Gemara comments: <b>This works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>bar Padda, who says:</b> An item with <b>severe</b> ritual <b>impurity,</b> such as that of a nonviable newborn, imparts impurity to substances <b>until</b> it is rotted to the degree that it is no longer fit to be consumed <b>by a gentile</b> who observes certain mitzvot [<i>ger toshav</i>], who is permitted to consume it; <b>but</b> an item with <b>light impurity,</b> which transmits impurity only by contact, imparts impurity to substances <b>until</b> it is no longer fit to be eaten <b>by a dog.</b> And as <b>this</b> congealed mass is <b>not fit</b> to be eaten <b>by a <i>ger</i></b> <i>toshav</i> it does not impart impurity. <b>But according to Rabbi Yoḥanan, who says:</b>"

        [
            "Both <b>this one and that one,</b> i.e., items of both forms of impurity, impart impurity <b>until</b> they are no longer fit to be eaten <b>by a dog,</b> it poses a difficulty to the opinion of Rabbi Yirmeya, as <b>this</b> mass <b>is fit for a dog.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, it is <b>difficult.</b>",
            "The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Bar Padda says:</b> An item with <b>severe</b> ritual <b>impurity</b> imparts impurity to substances <b>until</b> it is no longer fit to be eaten <b>by a <i>ger</i></b> <i>toshav</i>, <b>but</b> an item with <b>light impurity</b> imparts impurity to substances <b>until</b> it is no longer fit to be eaten <b>by a dog. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> Both <b>this one and that one</b> impart impurity <b>until</b> they are no longer fit to be eaten <b>by a dog.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason for</b> the ruling of <b>bar Padda? As it is written: “You shall not eat of any animal carcass;</b> you may give it <b>to the <i>ger</i></b> who is within your gates” (Deuteronomy 14:21). Bar Padda understands from this verse that an item which is <b>fit for a <i>ger</i></b> <i>toshav</i> <b>is called an animal carcass, and that which is not fit for a <i>ger</i></b> <i>toshav</i> <b>is not called an animal carcass.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the other</b> Sage, Rabbi Yoḥanan, how does he interpret that verse? He maintains that it serves <b>to exclude</b> a carcass <b>that was decayed from the outset,</b> e.g., if the flesh started to decompose while the animal was still alive, due to severe injury. But if the carcass was initially edible and later decayed, it continues to impart ritual impurity provided it is fit for a dog. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the other</b> Sage, bar Padda, how does he respond to this claim? <b>A verse is not necessary to exclude</b> such a case where the carcass <b>was decayed from the outset,</b> as <b>it is merely</b> like <b>dust</b> and obviously does not impart impurity.",
            "<b>We learned</b> in our mishna that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> In the case of <b>a large animal that expelled a mass of</b> congealed <b>blood, that</b> mass <b>must be buried, and</b> the animal <b>is exempt from</b> having any future offspring counted a <b>firstborn. And Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches:</b> That mass of congealed blood <b>does not impart</b> ritual <b>impurity, neither through</b> physical <b>contact nor through carrying. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is <b>due to</b> the halakhic <b>nullification</b> of a forbidden substance <b>in a majority</b> of permitted substances that the Sages <b>touched upon it,</b> in order to exclude it from impurity through contact or carrying.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> did Rabbi Yoḥanan say this <i>halakha</i> is <b>due specifically</b> to the <b>nullification</b> of a substance in a mixture <b>by</b> the <b>majority</b> of the mixture? Let one <b>derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> from the fact <b>that</b> the mass <b>is not fit</b> for consumption <b>at all,</b> and it never was. The Gemara explains: <b>This too</b> was <b>initially fit by virtue of its mother,</b> i.e., if one had slaughtered the mother before the embryo was discharged it would have been edible as part of the mother.",
            "<b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Makhshirin</i> 6:3) that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says: Ritually pure brine,</b> taken from an <i>am ha’aretz</i>, <b>into which any amount</b> of <b>water fell</b> is rendered <b>impure.

The Gemara asks: <b>But why do I</b> need to say they are suspected of mixing precisely <b>half</b> a portion of water? <b>Even</b> if they mix in <b>less than half,</b> the brine will <b>also</b> be rendered impure upon contact with the added water, as <b>that</b> small <b>amount</b> combined with slightly less than half a portion of water <b>constitutes half</b> the mixture, <b>and half</b> a mixture <b>is not nullified</b> by the other half.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> instead that an <i>am ha’aretz</i> is suspected of mixing in water <b>until</b> it constitutes slightly less than <b>half</b> the mixture. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>The impurity</b> of foods belonging to an <b><i>am ha’aretz</i></b> applies <b>by rabbinic law</b> and <b>the impurity of liquids</b> also applies <b>by rabbinic law.</b> Accordingly, the impurity of the brine in this case is due to two separate rabbinic decrees. <b>Where the majority</b> is water <b>the Sages decreed</b> the brine is impure, but in a case <b>where half</b> the mixture is pure fish brine <b>and half</b> is water <b>the Sages did not decree</b> that the brine is impure.",

            "It is derived from a verse, <b>as Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says that the verse states: “You shall eat it before the Lord your God, year by year [<i>shana beshana</i>]</b> in the place that the Lord shall choose, you and your household” (Deuteronomy 15:20). The phrase “<i>shana beshana</i>,” which can also be translated as: A year in a year, indicates that the verse is referring to one year that enters another year. <b>Which</b> type of <b>year enters another</b> year? <b>You must say</b> that this is speaking of the <b>year of the firstborn</b> animal, which enters the following calendar year, since if the animal is born in the middle of the year, its first year includes part of the subsequent calendar year.",
            "<b>The school of Rav taught</b> that there is a different <i>halakha</i> derived from the phrase <b>“year by year.”</b> This phrase indicates that it may be eaten on <b>one day of this year and one day of that</b> next <b>year.</b> The verse thereby <b>taught with regard to</b> an unblemished <b>firstborn</b> animal, which is sacrificed in the Temple, <b>that it is eaten for two days and one night,</b> like a peace offering.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> does <b>the school of Rav</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> that a firstborn must be eaten within its own year and that its year is not calculated according to the calendar year? <b>They derive it from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of other <b>sacrificial</b> animals, whose age is counted from their birth rather than by the calendar year. <b>And</b> with regard to the other <b>sacrificial</b> animals <b>themselves, from where do we</b> derive that their age is counted from their birth? <b>Rav Aḥa bar Yaakov says</b> that <b>the verse states:</b> “And when the days of her purification are fulfilled, for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring <b>a lamb in its first year</b> for a burnt offering, and a pigeon or a dove for a sin offering, to the door of the Tent of Meeting, to the priest” (Leviticus 12:6). This description of the lamb is referring to <b>its</b> own <b>year, and not a year of the counting of the world.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And Rav, from where does he</b> derive that a firstborn <b>is eaten for two days and one night?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> a verse in which Moses spoke to Aaron and his sons with regard to eating the firstborn: <b>“And their flesh shall be yours, as the breast of waving and as the right thigh, it shall be yours”</b> (Numbers 18:18). <b>The verse</b> thereby <b>juxtaposed</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the firstborn <b>with the breast and thigh of a peace offering. Just as there,</b> it may be eaten for <b>two days and one night,</b> as stated explicitly in a verse (see Leviticus 7:16), <b>so too here,</b> a firstborn may be eaten for <b>two days and one night.</b>"

            "<b>And the other</b> ones, i.e., the Sages from the school of Rav, why don’t they derive the <i>halakha</i> that a firstborn is eaten for two days and one night from that verse?

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And the other</b> one, Rav Yehuda, citing Rav, how does he respond to this? <b>The verse states:</b> “And their flesh shall be yours, as the breast of waving and as the right thigh, <b>it shall be yours”</b> (Numbers 18:18). <b>The verse adds another</b> mention of a form of the term <b>being</b> in the second phrase: “It shall be yours,” to teach <b>that</b> the priest has an additional day to eat <b>a firstborn</b> animal, i.e., that it is compared to the breast and thigh of a peace offering, not to that of a thanks offering.",

This indicates that such a firstborn may be eaten for up to thirty days beyond the first twelve months.",
            "According to this version of the discussion, the Gemara <b>raises an objection:</b> It is taught in a <i>baraita</i> that if the animal <b>developed a blemish on the fifteenth day within its year,</b> i.e., fifteen days before the end of its year, <b>one completes for it fifteen days after its year.</b> This indicates that with regard to <b>completing</b> a total of thirty days from the time the animal developed the blemish, <b>yes,</b> the owner may continue to maintain the animal in such a case.

In such a case the verbal analogy cannot be refuted by logic, whereas if neither phrase is free one can refute the analogy if there is a significant difference between the two cases. <b>As, if</b> these terms are <b>not free,</b> the verbal analogy <b>can be refuted: What</b> is notable <b>about dedications,</b> in contrast to the animal tithe offering?

In sum, the Gemara is suggesting that due to the term “And you shall cause to pass,” there is a verbal analogy between the animal tithe offering and the firstborn offering, from which it is derived that the animal tithe offering may not be redeemed.

            "§ <b>Rav Ashi says</b> that the prohibition against selling the animal tithe offering is not derived from dedications, but rather from the case of the animal tithe offering itself. The phrase <b>“It may not be redeemed,”</b> written <b>with regard to</b> the animal <b>tithe</b> offering, is to be understood as meaning: <b>It may not be sold.

            "Rav Ashi elaborates: <b>When</b> does the animal tithe offering <b>render</b> a non-sacred animal for which it is exchanged consecrated as <b>a substitute?</b> Only <b>when</b> the animal tithe offering is <b>alive.</b> Similarly, <b>when may</b> the animal tithe offering <b>not be redeemed</b> by its owner?

Certainly he agrees with that <i>halakha</i>. <b>Evidently, since there is a benefit</b> that accrues <b>to</b> the <b>Temple</b> treasury, the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>deems this permitted.</b> As it was taught (31b), the meat of disqualified consecrated animals may be treated in this manner despite the fact that it retains a measure of sanctity. The reason is that if the owner knows that it is permitted for him to perform this more lucrative action, he is likely to spend more money to redeem the animal in the first place, which benefits the Temple treasury. By the same logic, why doesn’t Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, permit the more lucrative action of skinning the animal from its feet?",
            "The Gemara cites several resolutions. <b>Rav Mari, son of Rav Kahana, said</b> that <b>the benefit gained to the hide</b> by skinning it whole is offset by the <b>detriment</b> caused <b>to the flesh.</b> Part of the animal’s flesh is severed from the carcass during the skinning process, thereby lowering its value. <b>In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they say in the name of Ravina</b> that skinning a disqualified consecrated animal from its feet is prohibited <b>because it appears as though</b> he is <b>performing work with sacrificial</b> animals, which is prohibited.",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Meir, what does he do with this</b> verse: <b>“It shall be perfect to be accepted”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse serves <b>to exclude</b> only an animal that was <b>blemished from the outset,</b> i.e., an animal that was born with a blemish. In such a case, there is no prohibition against causing an additional blemish in it.

            "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: There is no need to exclude an animal that was <b>blemished from the outset,</b> as <b>it is merely like a palm tree,</b> i.e., it can never attain the status of an animal consecrated as an offering.

            "§ The mishna teaches that one who slits the ear of a firstborn offering is prohibited indefinitely from slaughtering the animal on account of that blemish. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma before Rabbi Zeira:</b> In the case of <b>one who slits the ear of a firstborn</b> offering <b>and</b> subsequently <b>dies, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to penalizing his son after</b> the father’s death? Does the penalty prohibiting consumption of the firstborn offering extend to the son?",
            "The Gemara compares this dilemma to two similar cases. <b>If you say</b> the <i>halakha</i> should be derived from the case of <b>one who sells his</b> Canaanite <b>slave to gentiles and</b> the seller subsequently <b>dies,</b> where the Sages <b>penalized his son after</b> the father’s death and required him to redeem the slave, this is not a direct parallel. The Gemara explains: It is possible that the penalty is extended to the son only there, <b>as each day</b> that the slave is in the servitude of the gentile master, that master <b>prevents</b> the slave <b>from</b> performing <b>mitzvot.</b> A Canaanite slave is obligated to perform the same mitzvot as a Jewish woman, and he is unable to fulfill the mitzvot when in the possession of a gentile. Since this reason does not apply in a case of a firstborn offering, the case of the Canaanite slave cannot be cited as a source to resolve this dilemma.",
            "And <b>if you say</b> the <i>halakha</i> should be derived from the case of <b>one who planned</b> from the outset to perform <b>his labor on the</b> intermediate days of <b>a Festival,</b> by placing himself in a situation in which the labor should in theory be permitted, i.e., that a significant monetary loss would otherwise be incurred, that comparison is also inaccurate. The Gemara elaborates: In such a case the Sages penalized him by deeming it prohibited for him to perform the labor and by removing his rights to any of the finished products, but if <b>he died</b> before the start of the Festival, <b>they did not penalize his son after</b> the father’s death. This case is not a direct parallel either, as it is possible that it is only there that the penalty is not extended to the son, <b>since</b> the father <b>did not</b> yet <b>perform a prohibited act,</b> as he did not carry out any action on the Festival before he died.",
            "If so, <b>here,</b> in the case of mutilating the ear of a firstborn offering, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Should one say that <b>the Sages penalized</b> only <b>him,</b> i.e., the father, <b>and he is no longer</b> alive? <b>Or perhaps the Sages imposed</b> the <b>penalty upon his property,</b> i.e., that no benefit may be derived from the animal, <b>and that</b> animal still <b>exists</b> in the possession of his heirs.",
            "Rabbi Zeira <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya: <b>You learned</b> the resolution to your dilemma in a mishna (<i>Shevi’it</i> 4:2). <b>A field whose thorns were removed during the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>may be sown at the conclusion of the Sabbatical</b> Year, as removing thorns is not full-fledged labor that renders the field prohibited. But if <b>it had been improved</b> with fertilizer, or if <b>it had been enclosed</b> so that the animals inside would fertilize it with their manure, <b>it may not be sown at the conclusion of the Sabbatical</b> Year, as both these acts cause significant improvements to the field.

But <b>we learn</b> this in a mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 22a): With regard to <b>a woman who said: I was a married woman and</b> now <b>I am a divorcée, she is deemed credible</b> and permitted to remarry, <b>as the mouth that prohibited</b> her by establishing that she was married <b>is the mouth that permitted</b> her by establishing that she was divorced.",
            "The Gemara answers: Rabbi Ile’a’s statement is necessary, <b>lest you say it is</b> only <b>there,</b> in the case of the mishna, that the woman’s testimony is accepted, <b>as, if she wants</b> to remarry illegally, <b>she</b> does <b>not</b> need to <b>say</b> anything at all about previously being married. <b>But here,</b> with regard to the firstborn animal, it is different, <b>as,</b> if the priest wishes to eat the meat of the animal, <b>it not sufficient</b> for him <b>not to</b> bring the animal to an expert, i.e., he has no recourse other than to <b>say</b> that it is a firstborn animal which has a blemish requiring examination, <b>as</b> he cannot determine on his own whether this blemish permanently disqualifies the firstborn animal from sacrifice, and <b>he would not eat sacrificial</b> meat <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard, which is punishable by <i>karet</i>.",
            "Since the priest must admit that this is a firstborn animal, <b>I</b> might <b>say</b> that <b>this is not</b> a case of: <b>The mouth that prohibited</b> it is the mouth that permitted it, and therefore the priest is not deemed credible. To dispel this possibility, Rabbi Ile’a <b>teaches us</b> that he is deemed credible, <b>because if it due to that</b> reason, that the priest is suspected of causing the blemish, <b>he would have caused a blemish that</b> is <b>obvious to all.</b> In such a case, he would violate a mere prohibition, not one that is punishable by <i>karet</i>, since he would not be eating sacrificial meat outside the Temple courtyard, as the animal is blemished.",
            "<b>Mar bar Rav Ashi objects to this: What is different</b> between this case and <b>that</b> incident involving <b>a certain man who rented a donkey to another?</b> The owner <b>said to</b> the renter: <b>Look, do not go on the path of Nehar Pekod, where there is water</b> and the donkey is likely to drown. Instead, <b>go on the path of Neresh, where there is no water.</b> The renter <b>went on the path of Nehar Pekod and the donkey died. When he came</b> back, <b>he said:</b> Yes, <b>I went on the path of Nehar Pekod, but there was no water</b> there, and therefore the donkey’s death was caused by other factors.",
            "<b>And Rava said:</b> The renter’s claim is accepted, due to the reasoning of: <b>Why would he lie</b> and state this claim? In other words, <b>if</b> this man <b>wanted</b> to lie, <b>he</b> could have <b>told</b> the donkey’s owner: <b>I went on the path of Neresh,</b> as the owner instructed. <b>And Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>We do not say</b> the principle of: <b>Why would he lie, in a place</b> where there are <b>witnesses.</b> Since witnesses can be summoned to establish conclusively whether there was water along the path of Nehar Pekod, the reasoning that the renter could have stated a different claim is not employed. Similarly, the priest’s contention that the blemish occurred inadvertently should not be deemed credible, as it is known that priests are suspected of causing blemishes.",
            "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> with regard to the path of Nehar Pekod, <b>there is certainly water there, but</b> here, the possibility <b>that</b> the priest <b>caused a blemish in</b> the firstborn animal <b>is</b> only <b>a concern, and in a place of</b> mere <b>concern we</b> do <b>say</b> the reasoning of: <b>Why would he lie?</b> The Gemara relates that <b>Ravina was sitting and saying this <i>halakha</i></b> of Rabbi Ile’a <b>anonymously.

            "The Gemara rejects the claim that the mishna’s ruling is based on the principle that people do not lie about a matter that is likely to be revealed: Perhaps <b>there,</b> in the case of the mishna, the reason the priest’s claim is accepted is that <b>he</b> would <b>not eat sacrificial</b> meat <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard. If an expert had not permitted the meat, the priest would not eat it. <b>But here,</b> in Rav’s case, where the priest claims an Israelite gave him an already blemished animal, <b>since</b> priests <b>are suspected</b> of causing blemishes and claiming that it was inadvertent, <b>they are</b> also <b>suspected</b> of causing a blemish and claiming it was given to them in that state by an Israelite.",
            "<b>Rav Sheizevi raises an objection</b> to Rav’s ruling from a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 4:5): In the case of <b>one who says to someone who is not trusted with regard to tithe: Purchase</b> produce <b>for me from someone who is trusted</b> with regard to tithes, i.e., one who does not purchase produce from an ignoramus, who generally does not separate tithes; <b>or</b> if he says: Purchase produce for me <b>from someone who tithes,</b> i.e., even from one who purchases produce from an ignoramus but is careful to set aside tithes upon purchasing the produce, the agent <b>is not deemed credible</b> to claim that he fulfilled the condition of the one who appointed him.

            "<b>as he has</b> the easy option <b>of extricating himself</b> from the accusation that he did not fulfill the condition of the one who appointed him, by claiming that in his opinion the individual from whom he purchased the produce was to be trusted. Since the issue of the third party’s trustworthiness is subjective, the agent is not afraid to lie.",
            "The Gemara suggests: The <b>latter clause</b> of this mishna <b>certainly supports</b> the ruling of Rav, that people do not lie with regard to any matter that will be revealed. How so? The latter clause states that if the one instructed the agent to purchase produce specifically <b>from so-and-so,</b> who is reliable with regard to tithes, then <b>this</b> agent <b>is deemed credible</b> to claim that he adhered to the instructions. Since the one who appointed him mentioned a specific individual, the agent is not suspected of lying, as that individual can be subsequently questioned.",
            "The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>There,</b> in the mishna, <b>since</b> the agent <b>has a claimant, he is afraid</b> to lie. In other words, since the one who appointed him specified an individual, the agent presumes that he intends to verify the matter, and therefore he will not risk lying. By contrast, in Rav’s case, since it was the priest who volunteered the information that a specific Israelite gave him an already blemished firstborn animal, he is not concerned that the examiner might seek out the Israelite to confirm the actual facts.",
            "Upon hearing Rav Yehuda’s statement in the name of Rav, <b>Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba said: From where does Yehuda</b> know <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i>? Actually, <b>I taught this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>to Giddul</b> in Rav’s name <b>and Giddul,</b> in turn, <b>taught it to</b> Rabbi Yehuda. <b>But</b> Giddul corrupted my statement, as <b>this is how I said it to him: An Israelite is deemed credible to say: I gave this firstborn</b> animal <b>to a priest with its blemish</b> already inflicted upon it, and it may be slaughtered and eaten.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>An Israelite?</b> It is <b>obvious</b> that he is deemed credible to issue this claim, as he has no use for the firstborn animal. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> this ruling is <b>necessary,</b> as it is referring <b>to</b> an animal that was <b>young</b> when the Israelite gave it to the priest <b>and it grew older</b> by the time of his testimony. This ruling is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that as the animal grew older in the interim, perhaps the Israelite <b>does not recognize it</b> and mistakenly assumes that it was the animal he gave the priest, when in fact it is a different firstborn animal upon which the priest intentionally caused a blemish. Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the Israelite is trusted to recognize the animal he gave the priest.",
            "The Gemara notes: <b>In Sura, they teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>in accordance with the latter version,</b> as stated by Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba, that an Israelite is deemed credible to testify. <b>In Pumbedita,</b> they teach the <i>halakha</i> <b>in accordance with the first version,</b> as taught by Rav Yehuda, citing Rav, that even a priest is deemed credible if he claims that an Israelite gave him an already blemished firstborn animal. The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with even the first version.</b>",
            "In this regard, the Gemara relates that <b>Rafram,</b> who resided <b>in Pumbedita, had a firstborn</b> animal <b>and he gave it to a priest</b> in <b>an unblemished</b> state. The priest <b>went and caused a blemish in it. One day,</b> Rafram <b>had an affliction in his eyes,</b> which rendered it difficult for him to open them.

The priest <b>said to him: An Israelite gave me this firstborn</b> animal <b>with its blemish</b> upon it. Rafram <b>forced his eyes open</b> and <b>saw</b> the animal and <b>recognized it [<i>bashkerei</i>]</b> as the one he himself had given the priest.

            "The Gemara notes: <b>And even so,</b> Rafram <b>was unconcerned by the matter</b> of the priest’s attempted chicanery, as he maintained that it is only <b>this</b> priest <b>who is impudent,</b> but <b>all other</b> priests <b>are not impudent.</b> This scenario did not cause Rafram to discredit any other priest’s claim that he received a blemished firstborn animal from an Israelite, as this was an exceptional case. This priest demonstrated extreme impudence by bringing it to be examined by Rafram himself, and therefore one cannot draw conclusions about the behavior of other priests from this incident.",
            "§ The Gemara relates that there was <b>a certain</b> firstborn animal, <b>one</b> of whose eyes <b>was larger than the other, whose</b> owner <b>came before Rav Ashi</b> to have it deemed fit for slaughter on account of its blemish. Uncertain as to who brought the animal for examination, Rav Ashi <b>said: For what should we be concerned with regard to this</b> animal? In a case of such a blemish, <b>whether it is a priest</b> who brought it for examination, or <b>whether it is an Israelite,</b> there is no concern that the blemish might have been intentionally caused, as <b>this is</b> clearly <b>a firstborn</b> animal <b>whose blemish</b> was already <b>with it</b> naturally.",
            "<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: But perhaps it is an Israelite</b> who brought the firstborn animal, <b>and Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>one may not examine the firstborn</b> animal <b>of an Israelite unless a priest is</b> present <b>with him</b> in order to receive the animal if it is established as fit for slaughter. Rav Yehuda is concerned that if the Israelite’s firstborn animal is deemed fit for slaughter when no priest is present, the Israelite might improperly use the animal for his own purposes. If so, how can you, Rav Ashi, say that there is no problem if this animal was brought by an Israelite?",
            "Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> Ravina in response: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> where the presence of a priest is required, it is referring to a case where the halakhic status of the blemish has yet to be determined. Now, <b>granted</b> an Israelite <b>will not</b> risk <b>eating sacrificial</b> meat <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard, as that incurs a penalty of <i>karet</i>, and he therefore would have the blemish’s status determined by an expert. But <b>he is suspected with regard to the property of a priest.</b> Although the Israelite will have the status of the animal confirmed before risking a prohibition that entails <i>karet</i>, he might steal the firstborn offering if it is established as fit for consumption.",
            "Conversely, <b>here,</b> in the case of the animal that had one eye larger than the other, <b>since</b> even an Israelite <b>knows that this is a clear-cut blemish</b> and the animal is clearly fit for slaughter, <b>what is the reason he brought</b> the animal <b>before the Sages</b> for examination? He brought it <b>out of respect for the Sage.</b> Now, if this Israelite <b>does not neglect the respect due a Sage,</b> would <b>he commit a transgression</b> and steal the possession of the priest?

            "The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> it is referring <b>to ritual impurity</b> that is <b>by Torah law,</b> then <b>indeed</b> a vessel that is purified through rinsing can be become impure even through its outside. But <b>here we are dealing with</b> the <b>ritual impurity of liquids,</b> i.e., liquids that became impure and subsequently touched the vessel, which becomes impure only <b>by rabbinic law.

            "The Gemara explains the reason: <b>By Torah law, food does not transmit impurity</b> to <b>a vessel, and a liquid does not transmit impurity</b> to <b>a vessel. And it was the Sages who decreed</b> that an impure liquid transmits impurity to a vessel, <b>because</b> of the concern that people will be lenient with regard to <b>the liquid of a <i>zav</i> and a <i>zava</i>,</b> such as their urine or saliva, which are a primary source of impurity and impart impurity to vessels.",
            "<b>Therefore, the Sages deemed</b> the impurity of a vessel that is purified though rinsing whose outside became impure through liquid to be <b>like the impurity of an earthenware vessel,</b> and if its exterior became impure, its interior remains pure. <b>But the Sages did not deem</b> its impurity <b>like the impurity of itself,</b> i.e., a vessel that is purified through rinsing, <b>by Torah law,</b> that if its exterior became impure, the vessel becomes impure in its entirety.",
            "The reason for this is that through this ruling <b>the Sages employed an indicator</b> that it is impure only by rabbinic law <b>so that</b> people <b>will not burn <i>teruma</i> and consecrated</b> items <b>due to</b> having come into contact with <b>those</b> vessels, as by Torah law they are ritually pure and it is prohibited to burn them. The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> that this is the case under discussion, then with regard to a vessel that is purified through rinsing that <b>has no receptacle as well,</b> the Sages <b>should employ an indicator.</b> They should rule that the inside remains pure so that <i>teruma</i> and consecrated items will not be burned after coming in contact with it. Why then did Ḥizkiyya, the father of Ikkesh, testify that if its outside became impure, its inside becomes impure as well?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> the Sages <b>employed an indicator with regard to</b> vessels that are purified through rinsing that <b>have a receptacle,</b> it is thereby <b>known</b> that the impurity of a vessel <b>that does not have a receptacle</b> that comes in contact with an impure liquid is <b>by rabbinic law.</b> Therefore, no one will burn <i>teruma</i> and consecrated items that came in contact with it.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And with regard to a vessel</b> that is purified through <b>rinsing, is it susceptible to ritual impurity by Torah law,</b> so that the Sages found it necessary to decree that the exterior is susceptible to impurity of liquids? After all, in order for a vessel to be susceptible to impurity <b>it is required</b> to be <b>similar to a sack,</b> which is mentioned with regard to ritual impurity (see Leviticus 11:32): <b>Just as a sack is carried</b> both <b>full and empty, so too, any</b> object must be capable of being <b>carried</b> both <b>full and empty</b> in order to become ritually impure. This excludes a vessel that has no receptacle and cannot be carried full.",
            "The Gemara answers that it is referring <b>to these</b> vessels <b>that are suited for</b> sitting and are susceptible to ritual impurity imparted by <b>treading,</b> i.e., the ritual impurity imparted by a <i>zav</i>, <i>zava</i>, or a menstruating woman who sits or lies down on an item, even though it lacks a receptacle. The Gemara challenges: <b>If so,</b> with regard to <b>an earthenware</b> vessel that has no inside, the Rabbis should <b>also</b> decree that it is susceptible to the impurity of liquids if it is fit for sitting. The Gemara answers: <b>There is no</b> ritual impurity imparted by <b>treading with regard to earthenware vessels.</b>",
            "§ The Gemara returns to the matter of an incomplete skull. According to the opinion of Beit Shammai, if the skull is missing a piece of bone the size of a drilled hole, it does not impart impurity. According to Shmuel, Beit Hillel holds that it must be missing a piece the size of a <i>sela</i> coin. If so, there would be no disagreement between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, as it was taught with regard to a window that imparts ritual impurity that a drilled hole is the same size as a <i>sela</i> coin. The Gemara now offers an additional answer: <b>Rav Pappa says</b> that it was with regard to <b>a large drill</b> that <b>we learned</b> that the minimum size of a window that imparts impurity equals the size of a <i>sela</i> coin.",
            "The Gemara comments that <b>by inference, the unspecified drill</b> mentioned in the statement of Beit Shammai with regard to an incomplete skull is <b>also smaller than the size of a <i>sela</i></b> coin mentioned by Beit Hillel.

By using the term “the bull,” the verse indicates that the <b>bull</b> must be at the time of collection of the blood as <b>it already was</b> before slaughter, without a blemish. <b>Rather, here,</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, it is referring to a case <b>where it lacked</b> a kidney <b>before the collection</b> of the blood, whereas <b>there,</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, it is dealing with a case <b>where it lacked</b> a kidney only <b>after the collection</b> of the blood.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> if the animal lacked a kidney <b>after</b> the <b>collection</b> of the blood but <b>before</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood, <b>is it permitted</b> to be sacrificed upon the altar? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states with regard to the Paschal offering: <b>“Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male in its year”</b> (Exodus 12:5), indicating <b>that it shall be unblemished</b> and <b>in its</b> first <b>year at the time of slaughter?</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And from where</b> is it derived that it must also be unblemished at the time <b>of</b> the <b>collection</b> of the blood, <b>and</b> at the time of <b>conveying</b> its blood to the altar, <b>and</b> at the time of the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood? <b>The verse states: “Shall be,”</b> emphasizing <b>that all</b> actions that <b>are</b> performed upon <b>it shall be</b> performed only when it is <b>unblemished and in its</b> first <b>year.</b> This teaches that the offering must be unblemished even at the time of the sprinkling of its blood.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Interpret</b> this <i>baraita</i> as teaching that only the requirement that the animal must be <b>in its</b> first <b>year</b> is necessary at the time of sprinkling. Nevertheless, it need not be unblemished at this stage. The Gemara adds: <b>So, too, it is reasonable</b> that this is the correct interpretation, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> With regard to <b>all offerings in the Torah</b> that were slaughtered and their blood was collected, <b>from which there remains</b> either <b>an olive-bulk of flesh or an olive-bulk of fat,</b> the priest <b>sprinkles the blood</b> of that offering. <b>Learn from</b> this <i>baraita</i> that even if most of the offering is lacking, it is not disqualified after the collection of the blood.",
            "The Gemara asks with regard to the interpretation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>But is there anything where at the time of</b> its <b>slaughter</b> the animal <b>is in its</b> first <b>year but at the time of</b> the <b>collection</b> of the blood <b>and conveying</b> it to the altar it <b>is in its second year? Rava says: That is to say</b> that <b>hours disqualify</b> in the case <b>of sacrificial</b> animals, i.e., one measures the age of the offering from the exact time of its birth. Therefore, if the animal reaches its second year between the time when it is slaughtered and the collection of its blood it is disqualified.",
            "§ The Gemara returns to the previous discussion of whether the lack of an internal organ disqualifies an offering from being sacrificed. <b>Let us say</b> that this matter is <b>the subject of</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is taught in a <i>baraita</i> discussing the verse that provides a list of animals disqualified from the altar: <b>“And that whose stones are bruised, or crushed, or torn, or cut</b> you shall not sacrifice to the Lord” (Leviticus 22:24). <b>All</b> of these blemishes <b>are</b> found <b>in the</b> animal’s <b>testicles;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: Does Rabbi Yehuda mean that these blemishes are only <b>in the testicles and not in the penis?</b> There too these should be considered blemishes, as the penis is more exposed and visible than the testicles. Rather, <b>say</b> that all of them <b>also</b> apply <b>to the testicles;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: All of them are</b> considered blemishes only when found <b>on the penis. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The blemishes of <b>“bruised, or crushed”</b> apply <b>also to the testicles, while</b> with regard to the blemishes of <b>“torn or cut,” on the penis, yes,</b> these are considered a blemish, but <b>on the testicles</b> they are <b>not</b> considered a blemish.",
            "The Gemara explains the relevance of the dispute to the matter at hand: <b>What, is it not</b> that these <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree about this: That</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that <b>the lack of</b> an <b>internal</b> limb <b>is called a lack.</b> Therefore, in cases where the testicles are damaged they are considered lacking, disqualifying the animal, despite the fact that the blemish is not exposed. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, <b>holds</b> that the lack of an internal limb <b>is not called a lack.</b>",
            "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>And can you understand</b> the <i>baraita</i> in this manner? If so, <b>what does Rabbi Yosei hold? If he holds</b> that <b>the lack</b> of <b>an internal</b> limb <b>is called a lack,</b> then <b>even “torn or cut”</b> should be considered a lack, despite the fact that these blemishes are not visible. <b>And if he holds</b> that a lack of an internal limb <b>is not called a lack,</b> then <b>even “bruised, or crushed,”</b> should <b>not</b> be considered a lack, as they are not exposed.",
            "<b>Rather, here they disagree with regard to exposed blemishes. Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>“bruised or crushed”</b> testicles <b>are</b> considered <b>blemished, as</b> the testicles noticeably <b>shrink</b> due to the crushing. Likewise, testicles that are <b>“torn or cut” are</b> considered <b>blemished, as</b> the testicles appear to be <b>hanging,</b> i.e., dangling, to such an extent that they do not appear to be attached in the usual manner. <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov holds</b> that testicles that are <b>“bruised or crushed” are not</b> considered noticeable <b>blemishes, as initially,</b> before they become damaged, <b>there are times that</b> the testicles <b>also shrink.</b> Furthermore, testicles that are <b>“torn or cut” are not</b> considered <b>blemished</b> either, <b>as initially,</b> prior to being torn or cut, <b>there are times that</b> the testicles <b>also hang.</b>",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that <b>“bruised or crushed”</b> testicles <b>are</b> considered <b>blemished, as they are no</b> longer <b>present</b> in their normal state, but are entirely broken. But he maintains that <b>“torn or cut”</b> testicles <b>are not</b> considered <b>blemished, as they are</b> still <b>present</b> in the pouch, despite the fact that they no longer function.",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna details additional blemishes that enable the slaughter of firstborn animals: If <b>the pouch [<i>hazoven</i>]</b> in which the genitals of the firstborn are concealed, or if <b>the genitalia of a female sacrificial</b> animal, <b>were damaged</b> and lacking; if <b>the tail was damaged from the tailbone, but not</b> if it was damaged <b>from the joint,</b> i.e., one of the joints between the vertebrae, because it heals; <b>or</b> in a case <b>where the end of the tail is split,</b> i.e., <b>the skin and the flesh were removed and the bone remained</b> exposed; <b>or</b> in a case <b>where there is a full fingerbreadth of flesh between one joint and another joint;</b> these are all blemishes.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the case where the pouch in which the genitals of the firstborn are concealed was damaged, <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> This applies only if the pouch <b>was damaged, but not</b> in a case where it <b>was removed.</b> Furthermore, it is a blemish only if <b>the pouch</b> was damaged, <b>but not</b> if <b>the male</b> sex organ was damaged. The Gemara notes that <b>this</b> opinion <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is a blemish only if the pouch <b>was damaged, but not</b> if it <b>was removed,</b> and only if <b>the pouch</b> was damaged, <b>but not the male</b> sex organ. <b>Rabbi Yosei ben HaMeshullam says: An incident</b> occurred <b>involving one</b> animal <b>in Inbal, where a wolf removed</b> its pouch <b>and it</b> later <b>returned to its strength,</b> i.e., it grew again.",
            "§ The mishna stated: If <b>the tail was damaged from the tailbone…</b>or in a case where there is a full fingerbreadth of flesh between one joint and another joint. A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught:</b> The <b>fingerbreadth</b> of <b>which</b> the Sages <b>spoke</b> is <b>one-fourth of a handbreadth of any</b> average <b>person.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> is this stated? <b>Rabba says:</b> It is stated <b>with regard to <i>tekhelet</i>,</b> i.e., ritual fringes. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How many strings does one place</b> on a garment?<b>Beit Shammai say: Four</b> strings are inserted into the hole in the garment so that there are eight strings hanging down altogether, <b>and Beit Hillel say: Three</b> strings are inserted into the hole so that six are hanging down.",

            "The mishna continues: <b>And why did</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that there should be two measures of a cubit, <b>one large and one small?</b> It was <b>so that the artisans</b> who were working in the Temple <b>would take</b> payment according the amount of work they did, as measured <b>by the small</b> cubit, <b>and return</b> it to the Temple through their work, as measured <b>by the large</b> cubit, <b>so they would not come to misuse consecrated property.</b> If they would accept any payment that they did not deserve, they would be misusing consecrated property. It was with regard to the fingerbreadth mentioned in this mishna that the <i>baraita</i> cited above teaches that it is one-fourth of a handbreadth of any average person.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>two</b> large cubits? The Gemara answers: <b>One,</b> the shorter of the two, was used <b>to</b> measure <b>silver and gold.</b> Since silver and gold were valuable, the difference between the two measurements was set at only half a fingerbreadth, so that the artisans would not suffer too great a loss. <b>And</b> the other <b>one,</b> which was longer than Moses’ cubit by a full fingerbreadth, was used <b>in</b> the <b>construction</b> of wood and stone structures.",
            "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak, and some say Rav Huna bar Natan,</b> said: This <i>baraita</i>, which states that a fingerbreadth is one-fourth of a handbreadth of any average person, is referring <b>to that which we learned</b> in the mishna here with regard to the blemishes of a firstborn animal: In a case <b>where there is a full fingerbreadth of flesh between one joint and another joint.</b> That measure of a full fingerbreadth is one-fourth of a handbreadth.",

The Gemara answers that this is referring to a case where the incident was known <b>on the basis</b> of the testimony <b>of one witness or on the basis of the owner.</b> Therefore, the animal is not killed, as there are not two witnesses to the event, but the testimony is sufficient to disqualify the animal as a sacrifice.",

The Gemara challenges this explanation: The same should apply <b>even</b> in a case <b>where they did not divide</b> the property: <b>Let</b> the priest <b>go to this</b> son <b>and he will reject him, and let him go to that</b> son <b>and he</b> too <b>will reject him.</b>",

For this reason it <b>is necessary</b> for Rabbi Yoḥanan to teach both cases.",
            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> against the opinion that there is retroactive designation of the animals: <b>And similarly</b> in the case of two <b>partners who divided</b> their common property, and <b>one took ten</b> lambs <b>and</b> the other <b>one took nine</b> lambs <b>and a dog,</b> sacrificing any of the ten lambs taken <b>in exchange for the dog is prohibited.</b> This is because they are considered “the price of a dog,” as it states in the Torah (Deuteronomy 23:19), since they were given in exchange for it.

As a result, there are plenty of non-sacred animals ready to be sold, for food or offerings, to those on their way to Jerusalem.",
            "<b>And even though we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>Until the</b> time designated for <b>gathering arrives,</b> it is <b>permitted to sell and slaughter</b> the animals, which means that there is no obligation to keep the animals until those dates and there is no concern that the owners will sell the animals before tithing them. This is because a person <b>prefers to perform a mitzva with his money,</b> by separating the animal tithe, <b>and</b> only <b>afterward sell or eat</b> those animals.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And why does</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>call</b> the time designated for gathering animal tithe <b><i>goren</i>,</b> which literally means threshing floor? The Gemara explains that it is due to the fact <b>that</b> the arrival of this time <b>renders</b> the halakhic status of new animals like that of <b>untithed produce</b> gathered <b>on a threshing floor,</b> as from the time that produce is gathered on the threshing floor one becomes obligated to tithe it. Likewise, from this stage onward it is prohibited to slaughter the new animals until they have been tithed.",
            "The mishna states that according to Rabbi Akiva the times for tithing animals are adjacent to Passover, <i>Shavuot</i>, and <i>Sukkot</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>And how much is adjacent [<i>peras</i>]? Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, explained</b> that the term <b>adjacent</b> means <b>not less than fifteen days.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is this <b>inferred? Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that the term <b><i>peros</i></b> means <b>half.</b> The Gemara inquires: <b>Half of what?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Half of</b> the time during which one must learn <b>the <i>halakhot</i> of Passover,</b> and this is <b>like that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One asks</b> about <b>and teaches the <i>halakhot</i> of Passover</b> for <b>thirty days before Passover. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> One begins studying those <i>halakhot</i> <b>two weeks</b> before the Festival.",
            "§ The mishna states that <b>ben Azzai says</b> the times are <b>on the twenty-ninth of Adar, on the first of Sivan,</b> and on the twenty-ninth of Av. The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do Rabbi Akiva,</b> who says fifteen days before Passover, <b>and ben Azzai,</b> who refers to the twenty-ninth of Adar, <b>disagree?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that the month of <b>Adar that</b> immediately <b>precedes Nisan is sometimes a full</b> month of thirty days <b>and sometimes a defective</b> month of only twenty-nine days. Therefore, <b>sometimes</b> the fifteenth day before Passover <b>occurs on the thirtieth</b> of Adar <b>and sometimes it occurs on the twenty-ninth</b> of Adar. <b>Due to that</b> reason Rabbi Akiva <b>does not fix a time</b> by date, but simply states fifteen days before Passover. <b>And ben Azzai holds</b> that the <b>Adar that</b> immediately <b>precedes Nisan is always defective. Therefore, he fixes a time</b> in the calendar that the animals must be tithed, which is <b>on the twenty-ninth of Adar.</b>",
            "With regard to the fact that ben Azzai does not require fifteen days before <i>Shavuot</i> but maintains that the animals must be tithed on <b>the first of Sivan,</b> the reason is that <b>since</b> there are <b>not</b> so <b>many</b> animals born between the previous time of tithing and this one, <b>if you say that</b> the owner <b>should tithe earlier,</b> then <b>before the pilgrimage Festival arrives</b> all the animals will already be gone, their sales having been <b>completed.</b> If so, there will be no animals remaining for those coming to Jerusalem for <i>Shavuot</i>.",
            "The mishna teaches that ben Azzai says the last gathering time is <b>on the twenty-ninth of Av,</b> rather than fifteen days before <i>Sukkot</i>. The Gemara notes that <b>ben Azzai</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he said: The</b> animals born <b>in Elul are tithed by themselves,</b> because it is uncertain whether the new year for animal tithes begins on the first of Tishrei or the first of Elul. Consequently, he sets the time for animal tithe before the beginning of Elul to avoid the possibility of tithing animals born in one year with animals born in the next year.",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> if so, <b>let</b> him require that <b>one tithe</b> the animals <b>on the thirtieth day</b> of Av, which is the last day before Elul begins. The Gemara explains: <b>Sometimes</b> the month <b>of Av is defective,</b> i.e., it has only twenty-nine days, and therefore the thirtieth day after the start of Av is the first day of Elul. <b>And we are required to implement a distinction between the new</b> animals born in Elul <b>and the old</b> animals born in Av, which is considered to be the previous year.",
            "§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say</b> that the times are <b>on the first of Nisan, on the first of Sivan,</b> and on the twenty-ninth of Elul. The Gemara explains with regard to the first date: <b>On the first of Nisan,</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, who says</b> one begins studying and teaching the <i>halakhot</i> of Passover <b>two weeks</b> before the Festival. And Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon hold that the second time for animal tithe is <b>on the first of Sivan,</b> and this is <b>as we said</b> with regard to the opinion of ben Azzai, so that there will be enough animals born since the previous time.",
            "Finally, they hold that the third time for animal tithe is <b>on the twenty-ninth of Elul,</b> since <b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon</b> conform <b>to their</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as they say: On the first of Tishrei</b> is the <b>new year for animal tithe.</b> All animals born prior to that date belong to the previous year for tithe and are tithed as a single unit, whereas those born after that date belong to the next year for tithe, and therefore there is a distinction drawn between the new animals and the old.",
            "§ The mishna teaches: <b>And why did</b> Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon <b>say the twenty-ninth of Elul and</b> why <b>did they not say the first of Tishrei?</b> It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the first of Tishrei <b>is</b> the <b>festival</b> of Rosh HaShana and one cannot tithe on a Festival; consequently, they brought it earlier, to the twenty-ninth of Elul. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But let</b> the mishna <b>derive it</b> from the fact <b>that we require a distinction between the new</b> animals born in Tishrei <b>and the old</b> animals born in Elul, which is considered to be the previous year.",
            "The Gemara answers: The mishna <b>states one</b> reason <b>and</b> adds <b>another. One</b> reason is <b>that we require a distinction between the new</b> animals <b>and the old</b> animals. <b>And another</b> reason is <b>because it is</b> the <b>festival</b> of Rosh HaShana <b>and one cannot tithe on a Festival, due to the <i>sakreta</i>,</b> a lead-based red paint for marking every tenth animal, as explained on 58b. It is prohibited to apply paint on a Festival.",
            "§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> The beginning of <b>the new year for animal tithe is on the first of Elul. Ben Azzai says:</b> The animals born in Elul are tithed by themselves, due to the uncertainty as to whether the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir or in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon. The Gemara notes that <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>ben Azzai said: Since these</b> Rabbis, Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon, <b>say this,</b> that the first of Tishrei is the beginning of the new year for animal tithe, <b>and those,</b> i.e., Rabbi Meir, <b>say that</b> the first of Elul is the beginning of the new year for animal tithe, <b>the</b> animals born in <b>Elul are tithed by themselves.</b>",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But let</b> ben Azzai <b>see whose opinion</b> is more <b>reasonable,</b> and decide accordingly. <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>it is not possible</b> for him <b>to establish their reasoning,</b> that is difficult: <b>But it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>ben Azzai says: All the Sages of Israel appear to me</b> to be as unimpressive in their intellect <b>as garlic peel, except for this bald</b> one, i.e., Rabbi Akiva.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that ben Azzai was unable to establish their reasoning in this particular case, as <b>they said</b> their opinions <b>by tradition, from</b> a chain of transmission stretching back to <b>Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi,</b> the last of the prophets. Each Sage claimed his tradition concerning their ruling was the correct one. Since this dispute is based on tradition, it cannot be resolved by logical reasoning.",
            "<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In what manner</b> did <b>ben Azzai say</b> that animals born in <b>Elul are tithed by themselves?</b> For example, if <b>five</b> animals <b>were born in Av and five</b> were born <b>in Elul, they do not combine</b> to make ten animals that require tithing. Likewise, if <b>five</b> were born <b>in Elul and five in Tishrei, they do not combine.</b> But if <b>five</b> were born <b>in Tishrei and five</b> were born <b>in</b> the following <b>Av, they do combine.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: This is <b>obvious;</b> what is the novelty of the ruling of the <i>baraita</i>? The Gemara answers: This ruling is necessary <b>lest you say</b> that <b>just as years separate</b> between animals that may be tithed together, so too, the designated times for <b>gathering</b> and tithing the animals <b>separate</b> between those animals born before and after each one of them. If so, animals born in Tishrei and those born in the following Av would not combine. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that these designated times do not prevent animals born before and after them from being tithed together.",

It is because <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be sacred to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32), from which it is derived that <b>a definite tenth</b> must be tithed, <b>and not an uncertain tenth,</b> i.e., an animal that is not definitely the tenth. If the first of Elul is the new year, then the five born in Tishrei would have combined with the five of Elul and are exempt. Therefore, the obligation in this case is uncertain.",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Abba Elazar ben Gomel.

            "Abba Elazar ben Gomel explains: <b>Just as standard <i>teruma</i> is taken by estimate,</b> as there is no requirement for the amount separated to be measured precisely, <b>and</b> it can be taken <b>by thought,</b> as one is not required to physically separate it before consuming the remaining produce,"

It is <b>not difficult: This</b> ruling, of the <i>tanna</i> <b>who taught</b> that both animals must be left to <b>graze</b> until they develop a blemish, <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say: One may not bring sacrificial</b> animals <b>to a situation</b> where the time in which they may be eaten is decreased, thereby increasing <b>the</b> likelihood of <b>disqualification.</b> If both animals were to be sacrificed they would have to be eaten in accordance with the stringencies of both the animal tithe offering and the peace offering. They would have to be eaten within two days, like a peace offering, while the breast and the thigh would be given to the priests, as in the case of an animal tithe offering. Since only priests may eat those portions it is possible that they would be unable to eat them within the permitted time, and the remaining meat would become disqualified."

            "<b>And</b> the ruling of <b>this</b> <i>tanna</i>, <b>who teaches:</b> Both animals must <b>be sacrificed, is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who says</b> that <b>one may bring sacrificial</b> animals <b>to a situation</b> where <b>the</b> likelihood of <b>disqualification</b> is increased.",
            "<b>And</b> the ruling of <b>this</b> <i>tanna</i>, <b>who teaches:</b> Both animals <b>must die, is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says:</b> When the owner makes <b>a mistake</b> in designating animal <b>tithe,</b> e.g., if one designates the ninth animal as the tenth, the designated animal has the status of <b>a substitute</b> animal. And <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>a substitute for</b> an animal <b>tithe must</b> be left to <b>die.</b> Since it is uncertain which animal is the eleventh, both are left to die.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Yehuda hold</b> that <b>a substitute for</b> an animal <b>tithe must die? But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: The Sages <b>said in the name of Rabbi Meir,</b> in response to the statement of Rabbi Yehuda: The eleventh animal is not considered a substitute for the animal tithe, since <b>if it were a substitute it would not be sacrificed,</b> as the substitute for an animal tithe is not sacrificed?<b>By inference, Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that the eleventh animal is <b>sacrificed,</b> and not put to death, despite the fact that it has the status of a substitute animal.",
            "The Gemara continues: <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>Rabbi Meir is saying</b> his statement according <b>to what he</b> himself <b>holds,</b> and therefore nothing can be inferred from his comment with regard to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, that cannot be so; <b>but isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The difference between</b> the <b>eleventh</b> animal mistakenly designated as animal tithe <b>and a peace offering is only that this,</b> the peace offering, <b>renders</b> a substitute <b>sanctified to</b> the extent that it can <b>be sacrificed, but that,</b> the eleventh animal mistakenly designated as animal tithe, does <b>not render</b> its substitute <b>sanctified to be sacrificed;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> The Gemara infers: <b>It is</b> stated only that the eleventh animal mistakenly designated as tithe <b>does not render</b> its substitute <b>sanctified</b> with enough sanctity <b>to be sacrificed,</b> which indicates the eleventh animal <b>itself is sacrificed</b> and not put to death.",
            "<b>And furthermore,</b> there is a source that indicates that Rabbi Yehuda holds that a mistakenly designated animal tithe is sacrificed, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in the <i>Sifra</i>: “And if his offering be a sacrifice of peace offerings: <b>If</b> he sacrifice <b>of the herd,</b> whether male or female, he shall sacrifice it without blemish before the Lord” (Leviticus 3:1). This serves <b>to include</b> the <b>eleventh</b> animal mistakenly designated as tithe; it must be sacrificed <b>as a peace offering.</b>",
            "One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I include even the ninth</b> animal mistakenly designated as the tithe. <b>You say</b> in rejection of this suggestion: <b>But does consecration sanctify</b> a substitute <b>before</b> the original animal is sanctified, <b>or</b> does it <b>sanctify</b> only <b>after</b> the original animal is sanctified? <b>You must say</b> that it <b>sanctifies</b> only <b>after</b> the original animal is sanctified. If so, only the eleventh animal is sacrificed as a peace offering, but not the ninth.",
            "And <b>who is</b> the author of the <b>unattributed</b> statement in the <b><i>Sifra</i>?</b> It is <b>Rabbi Yehuda. And</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is teaching</b> that the verse: “If he sacrifice <b>of the herd,</b> whether male or female, he shall sacrifice it without blemish before the Lord,” serves <b>to include</b> the <b>eleventh</b> animal mistakenly designated as tithe, i.e., to teach that it must be sacrificed <b>as a peace offering.</b> Evidently, Rabbi Yehuda does not hold that the eleventh animal mistakenly designated as tithe must die.",
            "If so, in accordance with whose opinion is the <i>baraita</i> that rules that in a case where two animals emerged together as the tenth, and the owner called them both the tenth, they must both die? It cannot be in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda. <b>Rather, Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi Abba, interpreted</b> that <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rabbi Yoḥanan: We are dealing with</b> animal <b>tithe in the present</b> time, <b>and</b> the animals must die <b>due to</b> concern that <b>a mishap</b> might occur, as one might shear them or put them to work, or eat them before they develop a blemish.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so, why</b> is the <i>baraita</i> referring <b>specifically</b> to a case where <b>two</b> animals left the pen at the same time? The same would hold true <b>even</b> with regard to <b>one</b> animal designated as tithe, as it cannot be sacrificed nowadays. The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> <b>is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>It is not necessary. It is not necessary</b> to teach that in a case where <b>one</b> animal was designated as tithe it must die, <b>as there is no</b> major financial <b>loss. But</b> in a case where <b>two</b> animals were designated as tithe, <b>since the loss is great</b> one might think <b>he should leave them until they develop a blemish, and</b> then <b>eat them.</b> Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that even in a case where two animals were designated as tithe, both must die.",
            "It <b>was stated:</b> In the case of <b>one who says to his agent: Go and separate</b> animal <b>tithe on my</b> behalf, <b>Rav Pappi says in the name of Rava:</b> If he <b>called the ninth</b> animal the <b>tenth, it is sanctified</b> and may not be eaten until it has developed a blemish. The owner is not particular about this error, as the animal is not rendered entirely prohibited. <b>But</b> if he designated the <b>eleventh</b> animal as the <b>tenth it is not sanctified</b> as a peace offering, as the owner would not tolerate losing the animal entirely. <b>And Rav Pappa</b> disagrees and <b>says: Even</b> if the agent <b>called the ninth</b> animal the <b>tenth it is not sanctified, as</b> the owner who sent him can <b>say to him: I sent you to</b> act for <b>my benefit and not to my detriment.</b> The authority to serve as an agent does not extend to a case where he acts to the detriment of the one who designated him.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> manner <b>is</b> the case of animal tithe <b>different from that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 4:4): With regard to <b>one who says to his agent: Go and separate</b> <i>teruma</i>, the agent <b>separates</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>in accordance with the intention of the homeowner.</b> He must separate the amount that he assumes the owner would want to give, as there is no fixed measure that one must set aside as <i>teruma</i>. A generous person gives as much as one-fortieth of his produce as <i>teruma</i>, while a stingy person can give one-sixtieth.",
            "The mishna continues: <b>If he does not know the intention of</b> the <b>homeowner he separates an intermediate</b> measure, i.e., <b>one-fiftieth</b> of the produce. If <b>he subtracted ten</b> from the denominator and separated one-fortieth of the produce, <b>or added ten</b> to the denominator and separated one-sixtieth, <b>his <i>teruma</i></b> is considered <b><i>teruma</i>.</b> In this case too, the owner should also be able to say he did not send the agent to act to his detriment, and therefore the act of separating <i>teruma</i> should not take effect.",
            "The Sages <b>say</b> in answer: <b>There,</b> with regard to <i>teruma</i>, <b>since there are</b> those <b>who separate <i>teruma</i> generously and there are</b> those <b>who separate <i>teruma</i> sparingly,</b> the agent can <b>say: I estimated that you</b> were one <b>such as this,</b> i.e., either generous or stingy. But <b>here,</b> with regard to animal tithe, <b>it is a mistake,</b> and therefore the owner can <b>say: I did not want you to make a mistake.</b>"
