            "R.’ Akiva said  ‘I once asked R’ Gamliel and R’ Yehoshua in the meat market of Emmaus where they had gone to buy an animal for the wedding feast of R’ Gamliel's son: It is written, “And the sun rose for him...” (Bereshit 32:32) Did the sun rise only for him? Did it not rise for whole world? ",
            "R’ Yitzchak said  ‘The sun which had set for his sake, rose for his sake, as it is written “And Yaakov left Beersheva, and he went to Haran.” (Bereshit 28:10) And it is further written “And he arrived at the place…” (Bereshit 28:11) When he reached Haran he said to himself,  ‘Is it possible that I passed the place where my fathers prayed and I did not pray?’  He immediately resolved to return, and the earth contracted and he immediately arrived at the place. ",
            "After he prayed he wanted to return to Haran, but the Holy One said  ‘This righteous man has come to my lodging, shall he leave without a night's rest?’  Immediately the sun set. ",
            "It is written “…and he took of the stones of the place…” (Bereshit 28:11) but it is also written “…and he took the stone…” (Bereshit 28:18)  R’ Yitzchak said  ‘This teaches that all the stones gathered together into one place and each one said: let the righteous one rest his head on me!’  A Tanna taught:  they all merged into one. ",
            "“And he dreamed, and behold! a ladder set up on the ground…” (Bereshit 28:12) A Tanna taught:  What was the width of the ladder? Eight thousand parasangs, as it is written “…and behold, angels of God were ascending and descending upon it.” (ibid.) At least two were ascending and two descending, and when they met each other on the ladder there were four;",
            "and about an angel it is written “His body was like tarshish…” (Daniel 10:6) and we have a tradition that the Tarshish is two thousand parasangs long. ",
            "A Tanna taught:  They ascended to look at the image above and descended to look at the image below. ... They wished to hurt him, when “And behold, the Lord was standing over him…” (Bereshit 28:13) R’ Shimon ben Lakish said  ‘were it not expressly stated in the Scripture, we would not dare to say it. God is made to appear like a man who holds his hand over his son. ",
            "“…the land upon which you are lying to you I will give it and to your seed.” (ibid.) What is the greatness of this?  R’ Yitzchak said  ‘this teaches that the Holy One folded up the whole of the land of Israel and put it under our father Yaakov, in order that it be easily conquered by his descendants."
