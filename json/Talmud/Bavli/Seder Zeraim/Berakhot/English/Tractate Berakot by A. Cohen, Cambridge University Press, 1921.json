            " but the Sages say:  Until midnight. ",
            "Rabban Gamaliel says:  Until the rise of dawn. ",
            "It once happened that his sons returned from a feast [after midnight] and said to him,  \"We have not read the Shema' !\"  He told them,  \"If the dawn has not yet risen, you are still under the obligation of reading it.  And not only in this connection do they so decide; but wherever the Sages use the expression 'Until midnight,' the obligation continues until the rise of dawn.\"",
            " The duty of burning the fat and parts of the animal continues until the rise of dawn. Likewise with all offerings which have to be eaten the same day [they are sacrificed], the duty continues until the rise of dawn. If so, why do the Sages say \"Until midnight\"?  In order to keep a man far from transgression. ",
            "GEMARA  What authority has the Tanna [that the Shema' is to be read at all] that he raises the question: From what time?",
            "Further, on what ground does he first deal with the evening ?  Let him first deal with [the Shema'] of the morning ! ",
            "The Tanna bases his authority on Scripture ; for it is written, \"When thou liest down and when thou risest up\" (Deut. vi. 7).  His statement in the Mishnah is to be understood thus :  When is the time for reading the Shema' which is to be recited when lying down? From the time the priests enter [the Temple] to partake of their Terumah. ",
            "Or if thou wilt,  I can say that he derives [his reason for commencing with the evening] from the account of the Creation ; for it is written : \"It was evening and it was morning, one day\" (Gen, i. 5). ",
            "If this be so, in the sequel where he teaches : In the morning [the reading of the Shema'] is preceded by two benedictions and followed by one; in the evening it is preceded by two and followed by two, let him likewise treat of the evening first !",
            " The Tanna commenced with the evening and then treats of the morning; but while on the subject of the morning, he explains matters connected with the morning, and afterwards explains matters connected with the evening. ",
            "The teacher stated :  From the time the priests enter [the Temple] to partake of their Terumah.  Yes, but when do the priests partake of their Terumah ? From the time the stars appear.  Then let him explicitly teach : \"From the time of the appearance of the stars\" !",
            " He wishes to tell us something incidentally : When do the priests partake of their Terumah ? From the time the stars appear. He thereby informs us  that [the omission of] the sin-offering does not prevent [the priest from partaking of the Terumah].  This is in agreement with the teaching :  \"When the sun is down and it is clean\" (Lev. xxii. 7) — i.e. the setting of the sun prevents him from partaking of the Terumah, but not [his failure to bring] his sin-offering. ",
            "How is it to be known, however, that the phrase \"When the sun is down\" means the [complete] setting of the sun, and the phrase \"It is clean\" means the day is clean? "

        [
            "Perhaps the former signifies the setting of its light, and the latter the man shall be clean !",
            " Rabbah b. Rab Shela answered :  In that case the text should have read weyithar ; what means wetaher? The day is clean [of light];  as people commonly say, \"When the sun has set, the day is cleansed.\" ",
            "In the West, this explanation of Rabbah b. Rab Shela had not been heard by them, and they raised the question:  The phrase \"When the sun is down\" means the [complete] setting of the sun, and the phrase \"It is clean\" means the day is clean ; but perhaps the former signifies the setting of its light, and the latter the man shall be clean ! ",
            "They then solved it from a Baraita ; for it is taught in a Baraita : The sign for the matter is the appearance of the stars.  Conclude from this that the [complete] setting of the sun is intended ; and what means \"It is clean\" ? The day is clean. ",
            "The teacher stated :  From the time the priests enter [the Temple] to partake of their Terumah.  Against this I quote:  From what time may the Shema' be read in the evening ?  From the time when the poor man goes home to eat his bread with salt, until such time as he usually stands up to leave his meal ! ",
            "The latter part of this passage is certainly at variance with our Mishnah ;  but is it to be said that the first part is also at variance with it ? ",
            "No ; the poor man and the priest have the one standard of time. ",
            "I quote the following against our Mishnah :  From what time may we begin to read the Shema' in the evening?  From the time that people go home to eat their bread on the Sabbath-eve. These are the words of R. Meir ;  but the Sages say :  From the time the priests are entitled to partake of their Terumah. A sign for the matter is the appearance of the stars,  and although there is no proof of this, yet is there some indication ; as it is said, \"So we wrought in the work : and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared\" (Neh. iv. 15), and it continues \"That in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labour in the day\" (ibid. v. 16).",

            "The thought has occurred to thee that the poor man and people generally have the same standard of time.  Shouldest thou, however, maintain that the poor man and the priest have the same standard of time, then the opinion of the Sages and R. Meir would be identical !",
            " Is it then to be concluded  that the poor man and the priest have each a different standard of time ?  No ; the poor man and the priest have the same standard of time, but the poor man and people generally have a different standard. ",
            "The poor man and the priest have the same standard of time !  Against this I quote :  From what time do we begin to read the Shema' in the evening ?  From the time that the day becomes hallowed on the Sabbath-eve. These are the words of R. Eliezer.  R. Joshua says :  From the time the priests become ritually clean to partake of their Terumah.  R. Meir says:  From the time the priests bathe so as to be able to partake of their Terumah.  (R. Judah asked him,  \"But do not the priests bathe while it is yet day ?\")  R. Hannina says :  From the time the poor man goes home to eat his bread with salt.  R. Ahai (another version : R. Aha) says :  From the time when the majority of people go home to have their evening repast. ",
            "Shouldest thou maintain that the poor man and the priest have the same standard of time, then R. Hannina and R. Joshua hold the same opinion ! ",
            "Must it not therefore be concluded  that each of them has a different standard ? Yes, draw that conclusion. ",
            "Which of the two is later?  It is more probable that the poor man is later ; for shouldest thou maintain that he is earlier, then R. Hannina and R. Eliezer would hold the same opinion ! Must it not therefore be concluded that the poor man is later? Yes, draw that conclusion. ",
            "The teacher stated above :  \"R. Judah asked him,  'But do not the priests bathe while it is yet day?'\"",
            " R. Judah's question to R. Meir is a forcible one ! ",
            "But R. Meir answered him thus :  Dost thou think that I agree with thy opinion of \"twilight\" ?  I agree with R, Jose's opinion.  For R. Jose said :  The twilight is like a flicker of the eye ;  the night comes on and the day passes without anyone being able to perceive it.  "

            " R. Meir has contradicted himself!  There are two Tannaim in the sense of R. Meir.",
            " R. Eliezer has contradicted himself ! ",
            "There are two Tannaim in the sense of R. Eliezer.  Or if thou wilt,  I can say that the first part of the Mishnaic statement is not R. Eliezer's. ",
            "Until the end of the first watch.  What is R. Eliezer's view ?",
            " If he holds that the night is divided into three watches, let him say explicitly [in the Mishnah] \"until the end of the fourth hour.\"  If, on the other hand, he holds that the night is divided into four watches, let him say explicitly \"until the end of the third hour.\" ",
            "His opinion is certainly that there are three watches in the night ; but his intention is to inform us  that there are watches in heaven as on earth. For there is a teaching :  R. Eliezer says :  There are three watches in the night, and at each watch, the Holy One, blessed be He, sits enthroned and roars like a lion ; as it is said,  \"The Lord doth roar from on high, and utter His voice from His holy habitation ; He doth mightily roar because of His fold \" (Jer. xxv. 30).  A sign for the matter [of the three earthly night-watches] is : ",
            "at the first watch, the ass brays ; at the second, dogs bark ; and at the third, the babe sucks at the breast of its mother and a woman converses with her husband. ",
            "Of what is R. Eliezer thinking ?  If he is thinking of the commencement of the watches, what need is there for a sign of the beginning of the first watch,  since it is dusk ?  Should he be thinking of the end of the watches, what need is there for a sign of the end of the last watch,  since it is day ? ",
            "Nay,  he must be thinking of the end of the first watch, the beginning of the last watch, and the middle of the central watch.  Or if thou wilt, I can say that in every case he is thinking of the end of the watches ; and shouldest thou urge  that a sign of the end of the last watch is unnecessary,",
            "and ask what is its purpose ? It is for the reading of the Shema' on the part of one who sleeps in a dark room and does not know when is the time for reading the Shema'. Therefore, when the woman converses with her husband and the child sucks at the breast of its mother, let him get up and read it. ",
            "R. Isaac b. Samuel said in the name of Rab:  The night is divided into three watches, and at each watch the Holy One, blessed be He, sits enthroned, roars like a lion and exclaims,  \"Alas for My children, for whose iniquities I destroyed My house, burnt My Temple, and exiled them among the nations of the world ! \" ",
            "There is a teaching : R. Jose said :  Once I was journeying by the way, and I entered one of the ruins of Jerusalem to pray.  Elijah — may he be remembered for good ! — came, waited at the entrance for me, and stayed until I had concluded my prayer.  After I had finished my prayer he said to me,  \" Peace be to thee, my master.\"  I responded, \"Peace be to thee, my master and teacher.\"  Then he said to me,  \"My son, why didst thou enter this ruin ?\"  I answered,  \"To pray.\"  He said to me,  \"Thou shouldest have prayed by the roadside.\"  I said,  \"I feared lest passers-by interrupt me.\"  Then said he to me,  \" Thou shouldest have offered an abbreviated prayer.\"",
            " On that occasion I learnt three things from him :  first, one should not enter ruins ; second, it is permissible to pray by the roadside ; third, one who prays by the roadside should offer an abbreviated prayer. ",
            "Then he said to me,  \"My son, what sound didst thou hear in that ruin ?\"  I answered,  \"I heard a Bat Kol moaning like a dove, crying,  'Alas for My children for whose iniquities I destroyed My house, burnt My Temple, and exiled them  among the nations ! '\"  He said to me,  \"By thy life and the life of thy head, not only at this hour does it so cry, but thrice daily it exclaims thus.  Moreover, whenever the Children of Israel enter their  Synagogues and Houses of Study and respond 'Let His great Name be blessed,' the Holy One, blessed be He, shakes His head and exclaims,  'Happy the King Who is so praised in His house ! Alas for the Father Who has banished His children ! And alas for the children who have been banished from their Father's table ! '\" ",
            "Our Rabbis have taught : For three reasons one should not enter ruins :  on account of suspicion, of falling fabric and evil spirits.  [Why mention] on account of suspicion, since thou canst derive [a sufficient reason] from the danger of falling fabric ? "
        ],
        [
            " They might be new ruins. ",

            " In such places where evil spirits resort  there is occasion for fear. Or if thou wilt, I can say that even in the case of a person alone and new ruins situated in a wild place there is no ground for suspicion, because a woman does not frequent such a spot ; but the fear of evil spirits remains. ",
            "Our Rabbis have taught :  The night is divided into four watches. These are the words of Rabbi.  R. Nathan says :  Three. ",
            "What is R. Nathan's reason ?  Because it is written, \"So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outermost part of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch \" (Judges vii 19). Hence he teaches that  there cannot be a \"middle watch\" unless one precedes and follows. ",
            "How does Rabbi explain the phrase \"middle watch\" ?  He takes it to mean one of the middle watches. ",
            "What reply does R. Nathan make to this? He asks,  Does Scripture state \"one of the two middle watches\"?  No; the \"middle watch\" is explicitly mentioned. ",
            "What is Rabbi's reason [for declaring there are four watches] ?  R. Zerika stated that R. Ammi said in the name of R. Joshua b. Levi :  One verse states, \"At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto Thee because of Thy righteous ordinances\" (Ps. cxix. 62) and another verse states,  \"Mine eyes forestalled the night-watches\" (ibid. 5:148). How is this?  There must be four watches in the night. ",
            "How does R. Nathan answer this argument?  He agrees with the opinion of R. Joshua ; for there is a Mishnaic teaching :  R. Joshua says :  Until the third hour [in the day may the morning Shema' be read], for so is the custom of kings to rise at the third hour.  Six hours of the night and two of the day make two watches. ",
            "Rab Ashe said:  A watch and a half are also referred to as \"watches.\" ",
            "R. Zerika also stated that R. Ammi said in the name of R. Joshua b. Levi :  In the presence of the dead, we should only speak of matters relating to the dead. ",

            "How David rose at midnight !  He rose at eventide ;  as it is written,  \"I arose early beneshef and cried\" (Ps. cxix. 147). Whence is it learnt that neshef means evening ? Because it is written, \"In the twilight [beneshef], in the evening of the day, in the blackness of night and the darkness\" (Prov. vii. 9). ",
            "R. Osha'ya said in the name of R. Aha : Thus declared David,  \"Midnight never passed me by in my sleep.\"",
            " R. Zera said :  Until midnight  David used to slumber like a horse,  but from thence he grew strong like a lion.  Rab Ashe said :  Until midnight he was occupied with words of Torah, but from thence with psalms and praises. ",
            "Neshef means evening !  Lo, it means the morning ; for it is written,  \"And David smote them from the neshef even unto the evening ['ereb] of the next day\" (I Sam. xxx. 17). Is this not to be understood to mean from the morning unto the evening? ",
            "No, from evening unto evening.",
            " If so, the text should have read \"from the neshef unto the neshef\" or \"from the 'ereb unto the 'ereb\" ! ",
            "But, says Raba,  there are two occasions in the day called neshef; there is the neshef of the night followed by day, and the neshef of the day followed by night. ",
            "Did David know when it was [exactly] midnight,  since even Moses our teacher was not certain ; as it is written, \"About mid-night will I go out into the midst of Egypt\" (Exod. xi. 4) ? What means \"about midnight\" ? ",
            "Are we to suppose that the Holy One, blessed be He, used the phrase \"about midnight\" to Moses ?  Can there be any doubt in the mind of God ?  Nay ; God told him \"At midnight\"; but Moses came and said  \"about midnight.\" Hence it is to be understood that Moses was in doubt, but David did know it !",

Simeon Hasida :  There was a harp hanging above David's bed, and when the time of midnight arrived a North wind came and blew upon it, so that it produced melody. He used immediately to rise and occupy himself with Torah until the break of dawn.  At the rise of dawn, the wise men of Israel entered his presence and said to him,  \"Our lord, the king, thy people Israel are in need of sustenance.\"  He answered them,  \"Go, let each sustain himself from the other.\"  They said to him,  \"A handful cannot  satisfy a lion, nor can a pit be filled with its own clods.\"  He said to them,  \"Go, stretch forth your hands with the army.\" ",

            " \"Ahitophel \" was the counsellor, for thus it is stated, \"Now the counsel of Ahitophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man inquired of the word of God\" (2 Sam. xvi. 23). "

Why were the members of the Sanhedrin called Kereti and Peleti ?  They were called Kereti because they were concise [koretim] with their words, and Peleti because they were \"distinguished\" [muflaim] with their words.  After them came \"the captain of the king's host, Joab.\"",
            "Rab Isaac b. Adda (another version : Rab Isaac b. Rab Iddi) said :  What Scriptural authority is there for the story of David's harp? \"Awake, my glory ; awake, psaltery and harp; I will awake the dawn\" (Ps. lvii. 9). ",
            "R. Zera said :  Moses certainly knew [the exact time of midnight], and David also knew it. ",

            "David prayed, \"Keep my soul, for I am godly\" (Ps. Ixxxvi. 2). [R.] Levi and R. Isaac differ in their interpretation.  One explains :  Thus spake David before the Holy One, blessed be He,  \"Lord of the Universe, am I not godly,  seeing that all the kings of the East and West sleep unto the third hour of the day, but as for me, 'At midnight I rise to give thanks unto Thee' (Ps. cxix. 62)?\" ",

R. Joshua b. Levi, however, thinks that  the analogy is to be drawn between \"lying down\" and \"rising up\" in this sense : as with \"rising up\" the reading of the Shema' is nearer to his contact with the bed, so with \"lying down\" the reading of the Shema' must be nearer to his contact with the bed.

            " R. Judah prohibits a man to marry one outraged or seduced by his father.  Rab Giddel asked in the name of Rab :  What is R. Judah 's reason? Because it is written,  \"A man shall not take his father's wife and shall not uncover his father's skirt\" (Deut. xxiii. 1) — i.e. the skirt which his father had seen shall he not uncover. But how do we know that this refers to one outraged by his father ? ",

Levi who says :  Whoever teaches his son Torah, the Scriptures ascribe it to him as though he had received it from Mount Horeb ; as it is said,  \"Thou shalt make them known unto thy children and thy children's children\" (Deut. iv. 9) and it continues,  \"The day that thou stoodest before the Lord thy God in Horeb\" (ibid. v. 10).

            " Only in the case of a roan with a running issue who has experienced emission does R. Judah grant exemption, because he was not originally under the obligation to bathe ; but [it may be argued] a man who is merely a Ba'al Keri he does compel [to have immersion].",

Judah even exempts a mere Ba'al Keri,  and the point of variance [between him and the Rabbis] is the man with a running issue who experienced emission, to show thee the extreme view taken by the Rabbis, I then quote the latter part of the Mishnaic teaching :  \"A woman who during intercourse experiences the menstrual flow requires immersion.\" ",
            "For whom does he mention this ?  If it is supposed for the Rabbis, it is surely obvious ; since if a man with a running issue who experiences emission and originally was not under the necessity of bathing is compelled by the Rabbis to have immersion, how much more so a woman who experiences the menstrual flow during intercourse and originally was under the necessity of bathing !

For lo, there is a teaching :  A Ba'al Keri who has no water in which to bathe should read the Shema', but without the benediction before and after ; and he eats his meal with Grace after but not before, but he meditates [upon the Grace before meals] in his heart without uttering it with his lips. These are the words of R. Meir ;  but R. Judah says :  He should utter them both!",

Joshua answered him,  \"Do, then, the Ammonites and Moabites still inherit their lands?  Did not Sennacherib, king of Assyria, long ago come up and confuse all the nationalities ?

            "According to him who teaches \"the vineyard of the fourth year\" it is quite right if he argues by analogy of expression ; for there is a teaching :  Rabbi says : It is stated here,  \"That it may yield unto you more richly the increase thereof\" (Lev. xix. 25), and it is stated elsewhere,  \"the increase of the vineyard\" (Deut. xxii. 9) — as in the latter passage \"increase\" refers to the vineyard, so also in the former passage it refers to the vineyard ; and there thus remains over one hillul to be interpreted as meaning that a benediction is required [when partaking of fruits]. ",
            "But if he does not resort to this argument from analogy, whence does he derive the necessity for a benediction ?  And even if he resort to this method of reasoning, we find that a benediction is required after eating ; but whence is it that a benediction is necessary before eating ? ",
            "This is no difficulty ; for we can use a fortiori reasoning —  if he is to bless God when he is satisfied, how much more so when he is hungry ! We find this in connection with ",
            "[the produce of] the vineyard; whence is it [that a benediction is required with] other species ?",
            " It can be derived from the instance of the vineyard — as the vineyard, a thing that is enjoyed, requires a benediction, so also everything which is enjoyed requires a benediction. ",
            "But it is possible to object :  Why [is a benediction required with the fruit of] the vineyard ? Because there is the obligation of the gleanings.",
            " Let, then, the instance of corn show [whether this point is material] !  But why [is a benediction required when partaking of food made from] corn ? Because there is the obligation of Hallah.",
            " Then let the instance of the vineyard show [whether this point is material]!  The argument has therefore to be reinstated,  because the feature of the first case is not like that of the second and vice versa ; but the factor common to both is that each is something which is enjoyed and consequently requires a benediction. Hence everything which is enjoyed requires a benediction. ",
            "How is this the factor common to them both? [That they are both brought upon] the altar is likewise a common factor !  Then the olive must also be included because it likewise has this factor of [being brought to] the altar !",
            " Does, then, the olive need inclusion because of the factor of the altar ?  Behold, the expression kerem \"vineyard\" is explicitly written in connection therewith ; for it is stated,  \"And he burnt up the shocks and the standing corn, and also the olive-yards\" (Judges xv. 5) !  Rab Pappa answered :  It is called \"a kerem of olives\" but not kerem without qualification.",
            " Nevertheless the difficulty remains,  \"How is this the factor common to them both ? [That they are both brought upon] the altar is likewise a common factor.\"  One can, however, derive [the necessity for a benediction] from \"the seven species\" — as \"the seven species\" are things enjoyed and require a benediction, so everything that is enjoyed requires a benediction. ",
            "But why do \"the seven species\" [require a benediction]? Because they are under the obligation of first-fruits.  And further,  it is right [that a benediction is necessary] after partaking of them, but whence is it [that a benediction is necessary] before partaking of them ?",
            " That is no difficulty ; because it can be derived by a fortiori reasoning —  if he says a benediction when satisfied, how much more so when hungry ! According to him",
            " who teaches \"the planting of the fourth year\" it is quite right [that a benediction is required] for everything that is planted;  but whence [does he derive the necessity for a benediction] for things not planted, like meat, eggs, fish? It is, however, a generally held opinion that  a man is forbidden to enjoy anything of this world without a benediction. ",
            "Our Rabbis have taught :  A man is forbidden to enjoy anything of this world without a benediction, and whoever does so commits sacrilege.  What is the remedy ? Let him go to a Sage. ",

R. Levi asked :  t is written, \"The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof,\" and it is written, \"The heavens are the heavens of the Lord, but the earth hath He given to the children of men\" (ibid. cxv. 16) !

Since it is written,  \"This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth [but thou shalt meditate therein day and night]\" (Josh. i. 8), it is possible to think that these words [are to be understood] as they are written;  therefore there is a teaching to say,  \"And thou shalt gather in thy corn,\" ie. conduct at the same time a worldly occupation. These are the words of R. Ishmael. ",

But  when Israel perform the will of the All-present, their work is done by others; as it is said,  \"And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks,\" etc. (Is. Ixi. 5) ;  and at the time when Israel perform not the will of the All-present, their work has to be done by themselves ; as it is said,  \"And thou shalt gather in thy corn.\"  Not that alone, but the work of others will be done by them ; as it is said,  \"And thou shalt serve thine enemy\" etc. (Deut. xxviii. 48).

It is like a cooked dish in so far as there is a benediction before and after partaking thereof.  But it is unlike a cooked dish; for over a cooked dish one says at first \"...Who createst various kinds of foods,\" and in the end one benediction which is an abstract of three.

            "On another occasion, he was passing through the market-place of Mahoza when a wild camel attacked him, and the wall was cleft for him and he went through it. ",
            "Whenever he came to 'Arabot he said the benediction  \"Blessed... Who hast wrought for me a miracle in 'Arabot and with the camel\" ; and whenever he came to the market-place of Mahoza he said,  \"Blessed... Who hast wrought for me a miracle with the camel and in 'Arabot.\"  They answer :  In the case of a miracle wrought on behalf of the many, everybody is obliged to utter the benediction; but in the case of a miracle wrought on behalf of an individual, only he is obliged to say it. Our Rabbis have taught :  He who beholds the fords of the [Red] Sea, or the fords of the Jordan, or the fords of the valleys of Arnon, or the hail-stones in the descent of Bet Horon, or the stone which Og, king of Bashan, sought to cast upon Israel, or the stone upon which Moses sat when Joshua fought against Amalek, or [the pillar of salt of] Lot's wife, or the wall of Jericho which was swallowed up in its place — over all these one must give thanks and praise before the All-present.  It is quite right with the fords of the [Red] Sea ; for it is written,",
            " \"And the children of Israel went into the midst of the Sea upon the dry ground\" (Exod. xiv. 22).",
            " [It is quite right with] the fords of the Jordan; for it is written,  \"And the priests that bare the ark of [the covenant of] the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan, while all Israel passed over on dry ground, until all the nation were passed clean over the Jordan\" (Josh. iii. 17).  But the fords of the valleys of Arnon — whence is it [that a benediction is necessary]?  For it is written,",
            " \"Wherefore it is said in the book of the Wars of the Lord, Et and Heb in the rear and the valleys of Arnon\" etc. (Num. xxi. 14).  It has been taught :  \"Et and Heb in the rear\" were two lepers who journeyed in the rear of the camp. When the Israelites were to pass through [the valleys of Arnon], the Amorites came  "

        [
            "and made caves for themselves in which they hid, saying,  \"When the Israelites pass here we will kill them.\" But they knew not that the Ark was journeying before Israel and was lowering the rocks in front of them ;  so when the Ark reached [the spot where the Amorites were in hiding], the rocks clave together, killing them, and their blood descended into the valleys of Arnon.  When Et and Heb came and saw blood issuing from between the rocks, they went and told the Israelites and uttered a song. That is what is written,  \"And he poured out the valleys that incline toward the seat of Ar and lean upon the border of Moab\" (ibid. v. 15). ",
            "\"Hail-stones\" abne elgabish. What are abne elgabish ?",
            " It has been taught :  They are stones which remained suspended [in the air] for the sake of a man and descended for the sake of a man.  They remained suspended for the sake of a man, viz.: Moses; for it is written,  \"Now the man Moses was very meek\" (Num. xii. 3), and it is written,  \"And the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain poured not upon the earth\" (Exod. ix, 33).  They descended for the sake of a man, viz. Joshua ; for it is written,  \"Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is spirit\" (Num. xxvii. 18), and it is written,  \"And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth-horon, that the Lord cast down great stones\" (Josh. x. 11). ",
            "\"The stone which Og, king of Bashan, sought to cast upon Israel.\" A tradition has been handed down in this connection :  Og said,  \"What is the extent of Israel's camp ? Three Parsah. I will go and uproot a mountain of the size of three Parsah, and cast it upon them so that I will kill them.\"  He went and uprooted a mountain of the size of three Parsah and carried it upon his head ; but the Holy One, blessed be He, sent ants which bored a hole through it so that it sank about his neck. ",
            "As he sought to draw it off, his teeth were extended on both sides, so that it was impossible to extricate himself. That is what is written,  \"Thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked\" (Ps. iii. 8) ;  and it is in accord with the statement of R. Simeon b. Lakish who said:  What means that which is written, \"Thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked\"? Read not \"Thou hast broken\" [shibbarta] but \"Thou hast prolonged\" [shirbabta]. ",
            "What was the height of Moses? Ten cubits. He took an axe ten cubits long, jumped to a height of ten cubits and struck Og on his ankle and killed him. ",
            "\"The stone upon which Moses sat\"; for it is written,  \"But Moses' hands were heavy ; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon\" (Exod. xvii. 12). [Had not Moses a cushion or bolster upon which to sit ? But thus spake Moses : Since Israel are now enduring hardship, I too will endure hardship with them.] ",

            " It is quite right with all these miracles ; but that of Lot's wife was a punishment !  [On beholding it] one should say \"Blessed be the true Judge.\"",
            " But it mentions above thanksgiving and praise !  It has been taught :  For Lot and his wife we say two benedictions — for his wife one says,  \"Blessed be the true Judge\" ; and for Lot one says,  \"Blessed... Who rememberest the righteous.\"  R. Johanan said :  Even at the time of His wrath, the Holy One, blessed be He, remembers the righteous ; as it is said,  \"And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the Plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow\" (Gen. xix. 29).

            "\"And the wall of Jericho which was swallowed up.\"  And the wall of Jericho which was swallowed up !  Lo, it fell !  As it is said,  \"And it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the horn, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat\" (Josh. vi. 20).  Since its breadth and height were equal, it must in consequence have been swallowed up [in the earth]. ",

They mounted up to the heaven, they went down to the deeps...  They reeled to and fro, and staggered like a drunken man...  They cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and He brought them out of their distresses.  He made the storm a calm...  Then were they glad because they were quiet...  Let them give thanks unto the Lord for His mercy, and for His wonderful works to the children of men\" (Ps. cvii. 23-31). ",
            "\"They who journey in the desert\" — whence have we this ? For it is written,  \"They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way ; they found no city of habitation...Then they cried unto the Lord... and He led them by a straight way... Let them give thanks unto the Lord for His mercy\" (ibid. vv. 4-8). ",
            "\"The invalid who recovers\" — whence have we this? For it is written,  \"Crazed because of the way of their transgression, and afflicted because of their iniquities, their soul abhorred all manner of food... They cried unto the Lord in their trouble... He sent His word and healed them...Let them give thanks unto the Lord for His mercy\" (Ps. cvii. 17—21).",
            " \"The prisoner who has been set free\" — whence have we this?  For it is written,  \"Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death... because they rebelled against the words of God... Therefore He humbled their heart with travail...  They cried unto the Lord in their trouble...  He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death...  Let them give thanks unto the Lord for His mercy\" (ibid. vv. 10-15). ",
            "What benediction should he utter?  Rab Judah said,  \"Blessed ...Who bestowest lovingkindnesses.\"  Abbai said :  It is necessary for him to offer his thanksgiving in the presence of ten ; for it is written,  \"Let them exalt Him in the assembly of the people\" etc. (ibid. 5:32).

Isaac said:  Three things cause the sins of a man to be remembered ; viz.  [passing under] a wall threatening to fall, calculating on prayer and surrendering one's case against a man to Heaven ! ",
            "There is no contradiction ; the latter refers to where one calculates [on the prolongation of his prayer], the other to where he does not calculate upon it. So how should one act ? He makes many supplications. ",
            "\"He who prolongs his stay at table\" — perhaps a poor man will come and he will give him [some food] ; for it is written, \"The altar of wood three cubits high... and he said unto me, This is the table that is before the Lord\" (Ezek. 41:22). He opens with \"altar\" and concludes with \"table\"!  R. Johanan and R. Eleazar both say :  So long as the Temple was in existence, the altar used to atone for Israel, but now a man's table atones for him.",
            "\"He who prolongs his stay in the privy\" — is that a virtue? Lo, there is a teaching : Ten things cause a man piles :  Eating the leaves of reeds, the leaves of the vine, the sprouts of the vine, the palate of an animal, the backbone of a fish, salted fish which has not been sufficiently cooked, to drink the lees of wine, to wipe oneself [after evacuation] with lime, potters' clay, or pebbles with which another has wiped himself ; and some add :  Also unduly to strain oneself in the privy !",
            "There is no contradiction ; the latter refers to one who stays and strains, the other to one who stays long but does not strain.",
            "It is like the incident where a certain matron said to R. Judah b. R. El'ai,  \"Thy face is like that of pig-rearers and usurers.\"  He replied,  \"On my faith !  Both [occupations] are forbidden me ; but there are twenty-four privies from my lodging-place to the House of Study, and whenever I go there I test myself in all of them.\" ",
            "Rab Judah also said : Three things shorten a man's days and years :  To be given a Scroll of the Torah from which to read [a portion in the Synagogue] and decline to read ; to be handed the cup of benediction to say Grace and decline ; and to give oneself an air of superiority. ",
            "\"To be given a Scroll of the Torah from which to read and decline to read\" — for it is written, \"For that is thy life and the length of thy days\" (Deut. 30:20). \"To be handed the cup of benediction to say Grace and decline\" — for it is written, \"I will bless them that bless thee\" (Gen. 12:3).  \"To give oneself an air of superiority\" — for R. Hamma b. R. Hannina said :  Why did Joseph die before his brothers? Because he gave himself superior airs. ",
            "Rab Judah also said in the name of Rab : For three things it is necessary to offer supplication : A good king, a good year, and a good dream.  \"A good king\" — for it is written, \"The king's heart is in the hand of the Lord as the water-courses\" (Prov. xxi. 1).  \"A good year\" — for it is written, \"The eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year\" (Deut. 11:12). \"A good dream\" — for it is written, \"Wherefore cause Thou me to dream and make me to live\" (Is. 38:16).

Isaac said : \"We must not appoint a leader over the Community without first consulting them ; as it is said, \"See, the Lord hath called by name Besalel, the son of Uri\" (ibid. xxxv. 30). The Holy One, blessed be He, asked Moses, \"Is Besalel acceptable to thee?\" He replied,  \"Lord of the universe, if he is acceptable to Thee, how much more so to me!\"  He said to him, \"Nevertheless, go and tell the people.\"  He went and asked Israel, \"Is Besalel acceptable to you?\"  They answered, \"If he is acceptable to the Holy One, blessed be He, and to thee, how much more so to us ! \" ",
            "R. Samuel b. Nahmani said in the name of R. Jonathan : He was called Basalel because of his wisdom :  for at the time that the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, \"Go, tell Besalel, 'Make for Me a tabernacle, an ark and vessels',\" Moses went and inverted the order, saying to him,  \"Make an ark and vessels and a tabernacle.\" He replied,  \"Moses, our teacher, it is the way of the world for a man to build a house and afterwards furnish it ; but thou sayest, 'Make for Me an ark, vessels and a tabernacle'!  Where shall I place the vessels which I make?  Perhaps thus spake the Holy One, blessed be He, unto thee,  'Make a tabernacle, an ark and vessels'.\" Moses replied, \"Perhaps thou wert in the shadow of God and thou knowest this.\" ",

Rab Hisda also said :  When a dream is bad, the pain it causes is sufficient [to prevent its fulfilment], and when the dream is good, the joy it brings is sufficient.  Rab Joseph said :  As for a good dream, even in my own case, its cheerfulness frustrates it [so that it is not realised]. Rab Hisda also said :  A bad dream is worse than scourging ; as it is said, \"God hath so made it that men should fear before Him\" (Eccles. 3:14), and Rabbah b. Bar Hannah said in the name of R.

I am Thine and my dreams are Thine ; a dream have I dreamed and I know not what it is. Whether I dreamed concerning myself, or my fellows dreamed concerning me, or I dreamed concerning others, if they be good dreams, strengthen and fortify them [and may they be fulfilled] like the dreams of Joseph ; but if they require to be remedied, heal them as the waters of Marah [were healed] by the hands of Moses our teacher, as Miriam [was healed] from her leprosy, as Hezekiah from his illness, and like the waters of Jericho [sweetened] by the hands of Elisha. And as Thou didst turn the curse of the wicked Balaam into a blessing, so do Thou turn all my dreams for me into good.\" He should conclude [his prayer] simultaneously with the Kohanim, so that the Congregation responds \"Amen.\"  But if not, let him say the following:  \"Thou majestic One in the heights, Who abidest in might, Thou art peace and Thy name is peace.

To Raba he said :  Thy wife will die, and thy sons and daughters will come under the control of another wife. For Raba said in the name of R. Jeremiah b.

He said to him :  I dreamt that my house collapsed and everybody came to take each a brick. He replied :  Thy teachings will be scattered throughout the world.  He said to him :  I dreamt that my head was split open and my brains fell out. He replied :  The stuffing will fall out of thy bolster.  He said to him :  I dreamt that I was made to read the Hallel of Egypt. He replied :  Many miracles will happen to thee. [Once Bar Hedja] went with Raba on a boat; he said [to himself] ",
            "\"Why should I accompany a man to whom miracles will happen?\"  As he descended [from the boat] a book of his fell. Raba found it and saw written therein,  \"All dreams follow the mouth [of the interpreter].\"  He exclaimed, \"Thou rascal !  It rested with thee [whether my dreams were auspicious or not], and thou didst cause me all this pain.  I forgive thee everything except [what thou didst say about] the daughter of Rab Hisda.

            "Bar Hedja said, \"What can I do ?  There is a tradition that  the curse of a wise man, even when undeserved, comes to pass ; and how much more so that of Raba who has justification for uttering a curse!\" He said [to himself]  \"I will go into exile; for a teacher has said,  'Exile atones for sins'.\"",
            " He went into exile amoug the Romans, and sat down at the door of the king's treasury.  The wardrobe-keeper had a dream and said to him :  I dreamt that a needle entered my finger. Bar Hedja said,  \"Give me a Zuz\" ;  but he refused, so he gave him no reply.  Then the wardrobe-keeper said :  I dreamt that decay seized two of my fingers. He said,  \"Give me a Zuz\" ;  but he refused and received no answer.  He said to him :  I dreamt that decay seized my whole hand. He replied :  Decay has seized all the [king's] silken garments.  The king's household heard of this and they brought the wardrobe-keeper to put him to death.  He said to the king,  \"Why me?  Take him who knew but spoke not.\"  They took Bar Hedja, and he said to him,  \"Because of the Zuz [which I refused thee], destruction has come upon the king's silken garments.\" "

The Rabbis say :  He treads upon the firmament ; as it is said, \"He giveth a noise, as they that tread grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth\" (Jer. xxv. 30).  Rab Aha b.

The Rabbis say :  The clouds pouring water one into the other; as it is said, \"At the sound of His giving a multitude of waters in the heavens\" (Jer. x. 13).  Rab Aha b. Jacob said :  It is a mighty lightning-flash which strikes against a cloud and the latter is shattered into hail-stones.  Rab Ashe said :  The clouds are hollow and a blast of wind comes and blows across their mouths, so it is like a blast across the mouth of a jar.  The most probable view is that of Rab Aha b. Jacob, that the lightning strikes, the clouds are made to rumble and rain descends. ",

Levi :  Who sees the rainbow should prostrate himself upon his face; as it is said, \"As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud...and when I saw it, I fell upon my face\" (Ezek. i. 28). In the West they curse one who acts thus, because it has the appearance as though he worships the rainbow ;  but he should certainly pronounce a benediction.  What is the benediction ? \"Blessed. ..Who remembrest the Covenant.\"  It has been taught in a Baraita : R. Ishmael, the son of R. Johanan b. Baroka says:  [The benediction is, \"Blessed...] Who art faithful with Thy Covenant and fulfillest Thy word.\"  Rab Pappa said:  Let us therefore say both : \"Blessed ...
