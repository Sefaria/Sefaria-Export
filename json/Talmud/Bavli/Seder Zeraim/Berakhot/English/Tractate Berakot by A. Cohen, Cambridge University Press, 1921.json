            "From what time may the Shema' be read in the evening?  From the time the priests enter [the Temple] to partake of their Terumah, until the end of the first watch. These are the words of R. Eliezer;", 
            " but the Sages say:  Until midnight. ", 
            "Rabban Gamaliel says:  Until the rise of dawn. ", 
            "It once happened that his sons returned from a feast [after midnight] and said to him,  \"We have not read the Shema' !\"  He told them,  \"If the dawn has not yet risen, you are still under the obligation of reading it.  And not only in this connection do they so decide; but wherever the Sages use the expression 'Until midnight,' the obligation continues until the rise of dawn.\"", 
            " The duty of burning the fat and parts of the animal continues until the rise of dawn. Likewise with all offerings which have to be eaten the same day [they are sacrificed], the duty continues until the rise of dawn. If so, why do the Sages say \"Until midnight\"?  In order to keep a man far from transgression. ", 
            "GEMARA  What authority has the Tanna [that the Shema' is to be read at all] that he raises the question: From what time?", 
            "Further, on what ground does he first deal with the evening ?  Let him first deal with [the Shema'] of the morning ! ", 
            "The Tanna bases his authority on Scripture ; for it is written, \"When thou liest down and when thou risest up\" (Deut. vi. 7).  His statement in the Mishnah is to be understood thus :  When is the time for reading the Shema' which is to be recited when lying down? From the time the priests enter [the Temple] to partake of their Terumah. ", 
            "Or if thou wilt,  I can say that he derives [his reason for commencing with the evening] from the account of the Creation ; for it is written : \"It was evening and it was morning, one day\" (Gen, i. 5). ", 
            "If this be so, in the sequel where he teaches : In the morning [the reading of the Shema'] is preceded by two benedictions and followed by one; in the evening it is preceded by two and followed by two, let him likewise treat of the evening first !", 
            " The Tanna commenced with the evening and then treats of the morning; but while on the subject of the morning, he explains matters connected with the morning, and afterwards explains matters connected with the evening. ", 
            "The teacher stated :  From the time the priests enter [the Temple] to partake of their Terumah.  Yes, but when do the priests partake of their Terumah ? From the time the stars appear.  Then let him explicitly teach : \"From the time of the appearance of the stars\" !", 
            " He wishes to tell us something incidentally : When do the priests partake of their Terumah ? From the time the stars appear. He thereby informs us  that [the omission of] the sin-offering does not prevent [the priest from partaking of the Terumah].  This is in agreement with the teaching :  \"When the sun is down and it is clean\" (Lev. xxii. 7) — i.e. the setting of the sun prevents him from partaking of the Terumah, but not [his failure to bring] his sin-offering. ", 
            "How is it to be known, however, that the phrase \"When the sun is down\" means the [complete] setting of the sun, and the phrase \"It is clean\" means the day is clean? "
        ], 
        [
            "Perhaps the former signifies the setting of its light, and the latter the man shall be clean !", 
            " Rabbah b. Rab Shela answered :  In that case the text should have read weyithar ; what means wetaher? The day is clean [of light];  as people commonly say, \"When the sun has set, the day is cleansed.\" ", 
            "In the West, this explanation of Rabbah b. Rab Shela had not been heard by them, and they raised the question:  The phrase \"When the sun is down\" means the [complete] setting of the sun, and the phrase \"It is clean\" means the day is clean ; but perhaps the former signifies the setting of its light, and the latter the man shall be clean ! ", 
            "They then solved it from a Baraita ; for it is taught in a Baraita : The sign for the matter is the appearance of the stars.  Conclude from this that the [complete] setting of the sun is intended ; and what means \"It is clean\" ? The day is clean. ", 
            "The teacher stated :  From the time the priests enter [the Temple] to partake of their Terumah.  Against this I quote:  From what time may the Shema' be read in the evening ?  From the time when the poor man goes home to eat his bread with salt, until such time as he usually stands up to leave his meal ! ", 
            "The latter part of this passage is certainly at variance with our Mishnah ;  but is it to be said that the first part is also at variance with it ? ", 
            "No ; the poor man and the priest have the one standard of time. ", 
            "I quote the following against our Mishnah :  From what time may we begin to read the Shema' in the evening?  From the time that people go home to eat their bread on the Sabbath-eve. These are the words of R. Meir ;  but the Sages say :  From the time the priests are entitled to partake of their Terumah. A sign for the matter is the appearance of the stars,  and although there is no proof of this, yet is there some indication ; as it is said, \"So we wrought in the work : and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared\" (Neh. iv. 15), and it continues \"That in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labour in the day\" (ibid. v. 16).", 
            "What is the meaning of this latter verse? ", 
            "Shouldest thou say that immediately the sun set it was reckoned to be night, but they worked late and started early — come and hear :  \"That in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labour in the day.\" ", 
            "The thought has occurred to thee that the poor man and people generally have the same standard of time.  Shouldest thou, however, maintain that the poor man and the priest have the same standard of time, then the opinion of the Sages and R. Meir would be identical !", 
            " Is it then to be concluded  that the poor man and the priest have each a different standard of time ?  No ; the poor man and the priest have the same standard of time, but the poor man and people generally have a different standard. ", 
            "The poor man and the priest have the same standard of time !  Against this I quote :  From what time do we begin to read the Shema' in the evening ?  From the time that the day becomes hallowed on the Sabbath-eve. These are the words of R. Eliezer.  R. Joshua says :  From the time the priests become ritually clean to partake of their Terumah.  R. Meir says:  From the time the priests bathe so as to be able to partake of their Terumah.  (R. Judah asked him,  \"But do not the priests bathe while it is yet day ?\")  R. Hannina says :  From the time the poor man goes home to eat his bread with salt.  R. Ahai (another version : R. Aha) says :  From the time when the majority of people go home to have their evening repast. ", 
            "Shouldest thou maintain that the poor man and the priest have the same standard of time, then R. Hannina and R. Joshua hold the same opinion ! ", 
            "Must it not therefore be concluded  that each of them has a different standard ? Yes, draw that conclusion. ", 
            "Which of the two is later?  It is more probable that the poor man is later ; for shouldest thou maintain that he is earlier, then R. Hannina and R. Eliezer would hold the same opinion ! Must it not therefore be concluded that the poor man is later? Yes, draw that conclusion. ", 
            "The teacher stated above :  \"R. Judah asked him,  'But do not the priests bathe while it is yet day?'\"", 
            " R. Judah's question to R. Meir is a forcible one ! ", 
            "But R. Meir answered him thus :  Dost thou think that I agree with thy opinion of \"twilight\" ?  I agree with R, Jose's opinion.  For R. Jose said :  The twilight is like a flicker of the eye ;  the night comes on and the day passes without anyone being able to perceive it.  "

            " R. Meir has contradicted himself!  There are two Tannaim in the sense of R. Meir.", 
            " R. Eliezer has contradicted himself ! ", 
            "There are two Tannaim in the sense of R. Eliezer.  Or if thou wilt,  I can say that the first part of the Mishnaic statement is not R. Eliezer's. ", 
            "Until the end of the first watch.  What is R. Eliezer's view ?", 
            " If he holds that the night is divided into three watches, let him say explicitly [in the Mishnah] \"until the end of the fourth hour.\"  If, on the other hand, he holds that the night is divided into four watches, let him say explicitly \"until the end of the third hour.\" ", 
            "His opinion is certainly that there are three watches in the night ; but his intention is to inform us  that there are watches in heaven as on earth. For there is a teaching :  R. Eliezer says :  There are three watches in the night, and at each watch, the Holy One, blessed be He, sits enthroned and roars like a lion ; as it is said,  \"The Lord doth roar from on high, and utter His voice from His holy habitation ; He doth mightily roar because of His fold \" (Jer. xxv. 30).  A sign for the matter [of the three earthly night-watches] is : ", 
            "at the first watch, the ass brays ; at the second, dogs bark ; and at the third, the babe sucks at the breast of its mother and a woman converses with her husband. ", 
            "Of what is R. Eliezer thinking ?  If he is thinking of the commencement of the watches, what need is there for a sign of the beginning of the first watch,  since it is dusk ?  Should he be thinking of the end of the watches, what need is there for a sign of the end of the last watch,  since it is day ? ", 
            "Nay,  he must be thinking of the end of the first watch, the beginning of the last watch, and the middle of the central watch.  Or if thou wilt, I can say that in every case he is thinking of the end of the watches ; and shouldest thou urge  that a sign of the end of the last watch is unnecessary,", 
            "and ask what is its purpose ? It is for the reading of the Shema' on the part of one who sleeps in a dark room and does not know when is the time for reading the Shema'. Therefore, when the woman converses with her husband and the child sucks at the breast of its mother, let him get up and read it. ", 
            "R. Isaac b. Samuel said in the name of Rab:  The night is divided into three watches, and at each watch the Holy One, blessed be He, sits enthroned, roars like a lion and exclaims,  \"Alas for My children, for whose iniquities I destroyed My house, burnt My Temple, and exiled them among the nations of the world ! \" ", 
            "There is a teaching : R. Jose said :  Once I was journeying by the way, and I entered one of the ruins of Jerusalem to pray.  Elijah — may he be remembered for good ! — came, waited at the entrance for me, and stayed until I had concluded my prayer.  After I had finished my prayer he said to me,  \" Peace be to thee, my master.\"  I responded, \"Peace be to thee, my master and teacher.\"  Then he said to me,  \"My son, why didst thou enter this ruin ?\"  I answered,  \"To pray.\"  He said to me,  \"Thou shouldest have prayed by the roadside.\"  I said,  \"I feared lest passers-by interrupt me.\"  Then said he to me,  \" Thou shouldest have offered an abbreviated prayer.\"", 
            " On that occasion I learnt three things from him :  first, one should not enter ruins ; second, it is permissible to pray by the roadside ; third, one who prays by the roadside should offer an abbreviated prayer. ", 
            "Then he said to me,  \"My son, what sound didst thou hear in that ruin ?\"  I answered,  \"I heard a Bat Kol moaning like a dove, crying,  'Alas for My children for whose iniquities I destroyed My house, burnt My Temple, and exiled them  among the nations ! '\"  He said to me,  \"By thy life and the life of thy head, not only at this hour does it so cry, but thrice daily it exclaims thus.  Moreover, whenever the Children of Israel enter their  Synagogues and Houses of Study and respond 'Let His great Name be blessed,' the Holy One, blessed be He, shakes His head and exclaims,  'Happy the King Who is so praised in His house ! Alas for the Father Who has banished His children ! And alas for the children who have been banished from their Father's table ! '\" ", 
            "Our Rabbis have taught : For three reasons one should not enter ruins :  on account of suspicion, of falling fabric and evil spirits.  [Why mention] on account of suspicion, since thou canst derive [a sufficient reason] from the danger of falling fabric ? "
        ], 
        [
            " They might be new ruins. ", 
            "Then derive it from the danger of evil spirits ! ",

            " [Why mention] on account of falling fabric, since thou canst derive [a sufficient reason] from the grounds of suspicion and evil spirits ? ",

            " Is there no fear of evil spirits also when there are two men ?", 
            " In such places where evil spirits resort  there is occasion for fear. Or if thou wilt, I can say that even in the case of a person alone and new ruins situated in a wild place there is no ground for suspicion, because a woman does not frequent such a spot ; but the fear of evil spirits remains. ", 
            "Our Rabbis have taught :  The night is divided into four watches. These are the words of Rabbi.  R. Nathan says :  Three. ", 
            "What is R. Nathan's reason ?  Because it is written, \"So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outermost part of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch \" (Judges vii 19). Hence he teaches that  there cannot be a \"middle watch\" unless one precedes and follows. ", 
            "How does Rabbi explain the phrase \"middle watch\" ?  He takes it to mean one of the middle watches. ", 
            "What reply does R. Nathan make to this? He asks,  Does Scripture state \"one of the two middle watches\"?  No; the \"middle watch\" is explicitly mentioned. ", 
            "What is Rabbi's reason [for declaring there are four watches] ?  R. Zerika stated that R. Ammi said in the name of R. Joshua b. Levi :  One verse states, \"At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto Thee because of Thy righteous ordinances\" (Ps. cxix. 62) and another verse states,  \"Mine eyes forestalled the night-watches\" (ibid. 5:148). How is this?  There must be four watches in the night. ", 
            "How does R. Nathan answer this argument?  He agrees with the opinion of R. Joshua ; for there is a Mishnaic teaching :  R. Joshua says :  Until the third hour [in the day may the morning Shema' be read], for so is the custom of kings to rise at the third hour.  Six hours of the night and two of the day make two watches. ", 
            "Rab Ashe said:  A watch and a half are also referred to as \"watches.\" ", 
            "R. Zerika also stated that R. Ammi said in the name of R. Joshua b. Levi :  In the presence of the dead, we should only speak of matters relating to the dead. ", 
            "R. Abba b. Kahana said :  This applies only to words of Torah ; but as for worldly matters we can have no objection. ", 
            "Another version is : R. Abba b. Kahana said :  This applies even to words of Torah ; how much more so to worldly matters ! ", 
            "How David rose at midnight !  He rose at eventide ;  as it is written,  \"I arose early beneshef and cried\" (Ps. cxix. 147). Whence is it learnt that neshef means evening ? Because it is written, \"In the twilight [beneshef], in the evening of the day, in the blackness of night and the darkness\" (Prov. vii. 9). ", 
            "R. Osha'ya said in the name of R. Aha : Thus declared David,  \"Midnight never passed me by in my sleep.\"", 
            " R. Zera said :  Until midnight  David used to slumber like a horse,  but from thence he grew strong like a lion.  Rab Ashe said :  Until midnight he was occupied with words of Torah, but from thence with psalms and praises. ", 
            "Neshef means evening !  Lo, it means the morning ; for it is written,  \"And David smote them from the neshef even unto the evening ['ereb] of the next day\" (I Sam. xxx. 17). Is this not to be understood to mean from the morning unto the evening? ", 
            "No, from evening unto evening.", 
            " If so, the text should have read \"from the neshef unto the neshef\" or \"from the 'ereb unto the 'ereb\" ! ", 
            "But, says Raba,  there are two occasions in the day called neshef; there is the neshef of the night followed by day, and the neshef of the day followed by night. ", 
            "Did David know when it was [exactly] midnight,  since even Moses our teacher was not certain ; as it is written, \"About mid-night will I go out into the midst of Egypt\" (Exod. xi. 4) ? What means \"about midnight\" ? ", 
            "Are we to suppose that the Holy One, blessed be He, used the phrase \"about midnight\" to Moses ?  Can there be any doubt in the mind of God ?  Nay ; God told him \"At midnight\"; but Moses came and said  \"about midnight.\" Hence it is to be understood that Moses was in doubt, but David did know it !", 
            " He had a sign. For R. Hannah b. Bizna said in the name of R. Simeon Hasida :  There was a harp hanging above David's bed, and when the time of midnight arrived a North wind came and blew upon it, so that it produced melody. He used immediately to rise and occupy himself with Torah until the break of dawn.  At the rise of dawn, the wise men of Israel entered his presence and said to him,  \"Our lord, the king, thy people Israel are in need of sustenance.\"  He answered them,  \"Go, let each sustain himself from the other.\"  They said to him,  \"A handful cannot  satisfy a lion, nor can a pit be filled with its own clods.\"  He said to them,  \"Go, stretch forth your hands with the army.\" ",

            " \"Ahitophel \" was the counsellor, for thus it is stated, \"Now the counsel of Ahitophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man inquired of the word of God\" (2 Sam. xvi. 23). "

            " \"And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites\" (2 Sam. xx. 23).    Why were the members of the Sanhedrin called Kereti and Peleti ?  They were called Kereti because they were concise [koretim] with their words, and Peleti because they were \"distinguished\" [muflaim] with their words.  After them came \"the captain of the king's host, Joab.\"", 
            "Rab Isaac b. Adda (another version : Rab Isaac b. Rab Iddi) said :  What Scriptural authority is there for the story of David's harp? \"Awake, my glory ; awake, psaltery and harp; I will awake the dawn\" (Ps. lvii. 9). ", 
            "R. Zera said :  Moses certainly knew [the exact time of midnight], and David also knew it. ", 
            "Since David knew it, why did he require a harp ?  In order that he may be aroused from his sleep. ", 
            "And since Moses knew it, what object had he in saying \"About mid-night\" ?  Moses thought  that perhaps Pharaoh's astrologers would err and say, \"Moses is a liar.\"  For a teacher has said :  Teach thy tongue to say, \"I do not know,\" lest thou be led to falsehoods and be apprehended.

            "David prayed, \"Keep my soul, for I am godly\" (Ps. Ixxxvi. 2). [R.] Levi and R. Isaac differ in their interpretation.  One explains :  Thus spake David before the Holy One, blessed be He,  \"Lord of the Universe, am I not godly,  seeing that all the kings of the East and West sleep unto the third hour of the day, but as for me, 'At midnight I rise to give thanks unto Thee' (Ps. cxix. 62)?\" ", 
            "The other explains :  Thus spake David before the Holy One, blessed be He,  \"Lord of the Universe, am I not godly,  seeing that all the kings of the East and West sit in companies in all their pomp, whereas my hands are stained with the blood of a foetus or with the placenta in order to pronounce a woman clean to her husband ?  Moreover,  whatever I do I discuss with my teacher Mephibosheth, saying to him,  'Mephibosheth, my teacher,  have I decided well ?  Have I convicted correctly  or acquitted correctly ?  Did I rightly pronounce clean  or rightly pronounce unclean?'  And I was not ashamed [so to do].\" ",

            "It has been taught:  His name was not Mephibosheth but Ishbosheth. Why, then, was he called Mephibosheth?  Because he used to put David to shame on questions of Halakah.  On that account David merited that Chileab should issue from him;",

For behold it is written, \"If I had not [lule'] believed to look upon the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living\" (Ps. xxvii. 13); and it has been taught in the name of R. Jose :  Why are there dots over the word lule'?

Rather should a man come from the field in the evening and enter a Synagogue ; if he is accustomed to read [the Scriptures], let him read; if he is accustomed to study, let him study.

            "an analogy is here to be drawn between \"lying down\" and \"rising up\" in this sense: as with \"rising up\" the order is the reading of the Shema' and then the Tefillah, so also with \"lying down\" the order is the reading of the Shema' and then the Tefillah.  R. Joshua b. Levi, however, thinks that  the analogy is to be drawn between \"lying down\" and \"rising up\" in this sense : as with \"rising up\" the reading of the Shema' is nearer to his contact with the bed, so with \"lying down\" the reading of the Shema' must be nearer to his contact with the bed.

More even than that, he will see his desire on his enemies; as it is said,  \"As for his enemies, he puffeth at them\" (ibid.)!",

(Hab. i. 13). Does, then, the wicked swallow up the righteous?  And lo, it is written,  \"The Lord will not leave him in his hand\" (Ps. xxxvii. 33) and  \"There shall no mischief befall the righteous\" (Prov. xii. 21)!  Nay;  \"the wicked swalloweth up the man that is more righteous than he,\"  but a perfectly righteous man he doth not swallow up. ",

Hanok, because he made light of the washing of the hands ;  and when he died the Bet Din sent and placed a large stone upon his coffin,  to teach  that whoever is excommunicated and dies under the ban, the Bet Din stones his coffin.

            "R. Judah declares : He says Grace before and after.  That is to say that R. Judah is of the opinion that a Ba'al Keri is permitted to study Torah.  But lo, R. Joshua b. Levi has said :  Whence is it that a Ba'al Keri is forbidden to study Torah? As it is said,  \"Thou shalt make them known unto thy children and thy children's children\" (Deut. iv. 9)  and it continues,  \"The day that thou stoodest before the Lord thy God in Horeb\" (ibid. v. 10) — as those who were Ba'al Keri were forbidden [in the assembly at Horeb], so are they forbidden [to occupy themselves with Torah].

Judah does not draw deductions from juxtaposition, but Rab Joseph has said :  Even one who does not draw deductions from juxtaposition in any other part of the Torah does so in the Book of Deuteronomy;  and R. Judah who does not draw deductions from juxtaposition in any other part of the Torah does so in the Book of Deuteronomy. ", 
            "How do we know that he does not use this method in any other part of the Torah ? For there is a teaching : Ben 'Azzai said :  It is stated, \"Thou shalt not suffer a sorceress to live\" (Exod. xxii. 17) and it continues,  \"Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death\" (ibid. v. 18);  [the Rabbis] connect the two laws to infer that as the one who lieth with a beast is put to death by stoning, so also is the sorceress put to death by stoning.", 
            " R. Judah said to him :  Because the two matters are in juxtaposition, shall we inflict stoning upon the person [condemned for sorcery] !  [No;] but  they that divine by a ghost or a familiar spirit come under the category of sorcerers; and why are they particularised? To draw an analogy and teach thee  that as these are punished by stoning, so also is the sorceress. ", 
            "How do we know that R. Judah does draw deductions from juxta-position in the Book of Deuteronomy? For there is a teaching: R. Eliezer says :  A man may marry one outraged or seduced by his father, or one outraged or seduced by his son.", 
            " R. Judah prohibits a man to marry one outraged or seduced by his father.  Rab Giddel asked in the name of Rab :  What is R. Judah 's reason? Because it is written,  \"A man shall not take his father's wife and shall not uncover his father's skirt\" (Deut. xxiii. 1) — i.e. the skirt which his father had seen shall he not uncover. But how do we know that this refers to one outraged by his father ? ", 
            "Because it is written in the preceding verse,  \"The man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel's father fifty shekels of silver\" (ibid. xxii. 29). ", 
            "They said :  Yes, in the Book of Deuteronomy R. Judah does use this method of deduction;  but the consecutive verses [quoted above] are required for another teaching of R. Joshua b. Levi who says :  Whoever teaches his son Torah, the Scriptures ascribe it to him as though he had received it from Mount Horeb ; as it is said,  \"Thou shalt make them known unto thy children and thy children's children\" (Deut. iv. 9) and it continues,  \"The day that thou stoodest before the Lord thy God in Horeb\" (ibid. v. 10).

            "There is a Mishnaic teaching :  A man with a running issue who has experienced emission, a menstruous woman from whom the semen has escaped and a woman who during intercourse experiences the menstrual flow require immersion ;  but R. Judah exempts them therefrom.", 
            " Only in the case of a roan with a running issue who has experienced emission does R. Judah grant exemption, because he was not originally under the obligation to bathe ; but [it may be argued] a man who is merely a Ba'al Keri he does compel [to have immersion].", 
            " And shouldest thou say that in fact R. Judah even exempts a mere Ba'al Keri,  and the point of variance [between him and the Rabbis] is the man with a running issue who experienced emission, to show thee the extreme view taken by the Rabbis, I then quote the latter part of the Mishnaic teaching :  \"A woman who during intercourse experiences the menstrual flow requires immersion.\" ", 
            "For whom does he mention this ?  If it is supposed for the Rabbis, it is surely obvious ; since if a man with a running issue who experiences emission and originally was not under the necessity of bathing is compelled by the Rabbis to have immersion, how much more so a woman who experiences the menstrual flow during intercourse and originally was under the necessity of bathing !  Must it not be for R. Judah ?  But the statement is intended to apply to this case exclusively, viz. : "
        ], 
        [
            "a woman who experienced the menstrual flow during intercourse does not require immersion ; but a mere Ba'al Keri he does place under the obligation.  Do not read He says Grace but He meditates. ", 
            "But does R. Judah hold that meditation [is sufficient] ?  For lo, there is a teaching :  A Ba'al Keri who has no water in which to bathe should read the Shema', but without the benediction before and after ; and he eats his meal with Grace after but not before, but he meditates [upon the Grace before meals] in his heart without uttering it with his lips. These are the words of R. Meir ;  but R. Judah says :  He should utter them both!", 
            " Rab Nahman b. Isaac said :  R. Judah treats the Grace before and after meals like the Halakot of Derek Eres; ",

            " Hence [the Rabbis] said :  Men with a running issue, lepers and those who have had intercourse with menstruous women are permitted to read the Pentateuch, the Prophets and the Hagiographa, to study Mishnah, Midrash, Talmud, Halakot and Aggadot ; but those who are Ba'al Keri are forbidden.", 
            " R. Jose says :  The Ba'al Keri may study what is familiar to him, but he must not expound the Mishnah.  R. Jonathan b. Joseph says :  He may expound the Mishnah but not the Talmud.  R. Nathan b. Abishalom says :  Also the Talmud may he expound, but he must not pronounce the name of God when it occurs.  R. Johanan the Sandal-maker, disciple of R.'Akiba, said in the name of R.'Akiba :  Such a man should not enter upon study at all. Another version of this statement is :  Such a man should not enter a House of Study at all.  R. Judah says :  He may study the Halakot of Derek Eres. ",

Judah, who had experienced emission, was walking by the river,  and his disciples said to him,  \"Master, teach us a chapter of the Halakot of Derek Eres.\"  He descended into the water, bathed, and then taught them.  They said to him,  \"Hast thou not taught us. Master,  that such an one may study the Halakot of Derek Eres?\"  He replied,  \"Although I am lenient by permitting others, I take a stricter view with myself.\" ",

He said to him :  My son, open thy mouth and let thy words issue forth clearly,  because words of Torah cannot contract defilement; as it is said, \"Is not My word like a fire? saith the Lord\" (Jer. xxiii 29) — as fire does not contract defilement, so also words of Torah do not contract defilement.

He is wise, so if anyone puts difficult questions to him, he will be able to reply to him ; and he is rich, so if it be necessary for someone to attend at the palace of the Emperor, he will be qualified to do so ; and he is of the tenth generation from Ezra, so he possesses ancestral merit and Rabban Gamaliel will not be able to worry him on that score.\"  They attended upon R.

There was not a Halakah which had been left in a state of uncertainty in the House of Study which was not then made clear.  Even Rabban Gamaliel did not absent himself from the House of Study.

Joshua,  \"But has it not been said,  'An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of the Lord '?\" (Deut. xxiii. 4).  R. Joshua answered him,  \"Do, then, the Ammonites and Moabites still inherit their lands?  Did not Sennacherib, king of Assyria, long ago come up and confuse all the nationalities ? As it is said,  'I have removed the bounds of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures, and have brought down as one mighty the inhabitants' (Is. 10:13) ; and whoever issues [from a mixed body] issues from the majority.\" ", 
            "Rabban Gamaliel said to him,  \"But has it not been said, 'Afterward I will bring back the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith the Lord' (Jer. xlix. 6) ? and therefore they have returned !\" ",

            "Rabban Gamaliel thereupon said,  \"Since it is so, I will go and conciliate R. Joshua.\"  When he arrived at the latter's house, he noticed that the walls of his house were blackened,  and said to him,  \"From the walls of thy house it can be recognised that thou art a charcoal-burner.\"  R. Joshua replied,  \"Woe to the generation whose leader thou art, for thou knowest not the struggle of the disciples to support and feed themselves!\" ", 
            "He said to him,  \"I beg thy pardon; forgive me.\"  He took no notice of him.  \"Do it out of regard for my father!\"  He made peace with him. ",

On descending he said to them,  \"Go, the fever has left him.\"  They said to him,  \"Art thou a prophet?\"  He replied,  \"'I am no prophet nor a prophet's son' (Amos vii. 14) ; but so is my tradition :  If my prayer is fluent in my mouth, I know that he is accepted ; but if not, I know that he is rejected.\"  They sat down and wrote and noted the time.  When they came to Rabban Gamaliel, he said to them,  \"By the Temple-service!  You have neither understated nor overstated [the time]. But thus it happened ; at that very hour the fever left him, and he asked us for water to drink.\" ", 
            "It also happened with R. Hannina b. Dosa that he went to Torah with Rabban Johanan b. Zakkai. The son of Rabban Johanan b. Zakkai fell ill,  and he said to him,  \"Hannina, my son ! Pray on his behalf that he may live\"  R. Hannina laid his head between his knees, and prayed on his behalf, and he recovered.  Rabban Johanan b. Zakkai said,  \"Were Ben Zakkai to press his head between his knees all the day long, no notice would be taken of him.\"  His wife said to him,  \"Is, then, Hannina greater than thou?\"  He replied,  \"No; he is like a slave before the King, and I like a nobleman before the King.\" ", 
            "R. Hiyya b. Abba also said in the name of R Johanan :  A man should not pray except in a room which has windows ; as it is said,  \"Now his windows were open in his upper chamber towards Jerusalem\" (Dan. vi. 11). Rab Kahana said : ", 
            "I consider him impertinent who prays in a valley.",

            "MISHNAH What benediction do we say over fruit ? Over the fruit of trees, one says,  \"[Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe] Who Createst the fruit of the tree,\" except over wine ; for over wine ons says,  \"...Who createst the fruit of the vine.\"  Over the fruits of the earth one says :  \"... Who createst the fruit of the ground,\" except over bread; for over bread one says,  \"...Who bringest forth bread from the earth.\"  Over vegetables one says,  \"... Who createst the fruit of the ground\" ; but R. Judah declares :  \"... Who createst divers kinds of herbs.\" ", 
            "GEMARA  Whence is this derived ?  For our Rabbis have taught:  \"The fruit thereof shall be holy, for giving praise [hillulim] unto the Lord\" (Lev. xix. 24) — this teaches that they require a benediction before and after partaking of them. Hence said R. 'Akiba :  A man is forbidden to taste anything without previously saying a benediction. But is the phrase \"holy for giving praise\" intended to teach that ?", 
            " Surely it is required [to teach as follows :] First,  that the All-merciful declares [the owner] must redeem it and then eat it ; and second,  only those things which require \"a song of praise\" require redemption, but if they do not require \"a song of praise,\" redemption is unnecessary ! This is according to the statement of R. Samuel b. Nahmani in the name of R. Jonathan who said :  [not translated] Whence is it that we say \"a song of praise\" only over wine ? As it is said, \"And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine which cheereth God and man?\" (Judges ix. 13). If it cheereth man, how does it cheer God ?  Hence it is to be inferred that we have \"a song of praise\" only over wine. ", 
            "It is quite right according to him who teaches \"the planting of the fourth year\"; but according to him who teaches \"the vineyard of the fourth year\" what is there to say?  For it has been reported :  R. Hiyya and R. Simeon b. Rabbi [differ] ; one teaches  \"The vineyard of the fourth year,\" the other teaches  \"The planting of the fourth year.\" ", 
            "According to him who teaches \"the vineyard of the fourth year\" it is quite right if he argues by analogy of expression ; for there is a teaching :  Rabbi says : It is stated here,  \"That it may yield unto you more richly the increase thereof\" (Lev. xix. 25), and it is stated elsewhere,  \"the increase of the vineyard\" (Deut. xxii. 9) — as in the latter passage \"increase\" refers to the vineyard, so also in the former passage it refers to the vineyard ; and there thus remains over one hillul to be interpreted as meaning that a benediction is required [when partaking of fruits]. ", 
            "But if he does not resort to this argument from analogy, whence does he derive the necessity for a benediction ?  And even if he resort to this method of reasoning, we find that a benediction is required after eating ; but whence is it that a benediction is necessary before eating ? ", 
            "This is no difficulty ; for we can use a fortiori reasoning —  if he is to bless God when he is satisfied, how much more so when he is hungry ! We find this in connection with ", 
            "[the produce of] the vineyard; whence is it [that a benediction is required with] other species ?", 
            " It can be derived from the instance of the vineyard — as the vineyard, a thing that is enjoyed, requires a benediction, so also everything which is enjoyed requires a benediction. ", 
            "But it is possible to object :  Why [is a benediction required with the fruit of] the vineyard ? Because there is the obligation of the gleanings.", 
            " Let, then, the instance of corn show [whether this point is material] !  But why [is a benediction required when partaking of food made from] corn ? Because there is the obligation of Hallah.", 
            " Then let the instance of the vineyard show [whether this point is material]!  The argument has therefore to be reinstated,  because the feature of the first case is not like that of the second and vice versa ; but the factor common to both is that each is something which is enjoyed and consequently requires a benediction. Hence everything which is enjoyed requires a benediction. ", 
            "How is this the factor common to them both? [That they are both brought upon] the altar is likewise a common factor !  Then the olive must also be included because it likewise has this factor of [being brought to] the altar !", 
            " Does, then, the olive need inclusion because of the factor of the altar ?  Behold, the expression kerem \"vineyard\" is explicitly written in connection therewith ; for it is stated,  \"And he burnt up the shocks and the standing corn, and also the olive-yards\" (Judges xv. 5) !  Rab Pappa answered :  It is called \"a kerem of olives\" but not kerem without qualification.", 
            " Nevertheless the difficulty remains,  \"How is this the factor common to them both ? [That they are both brought upon] the altar is likewise a common factor.\"  One can, however, derive [the necessity for a benediction] from \"the seven species\" — as \"the seven species\" are things enjoyed and require a benediction, so everything that is enjoyed requires a benediction. ", 
            "But why do \"the seven species\" [require a benediction]? Because they are under the obligation of first-fruits.  And further,  it is right [that a benediction is necessary] after partaking of them, but whence is it [that a benediction is necessary] before partaking of them ?", 
            " That is no difficulty ; because it can be derived by a fortiori reasoning —  if he says a benediction when satisfied, how much more so when hungry ! According to him", 
            " who teaches \"the planting of the fourth year\" it is quite right [that a benediction is required] for everything that is planted;  but whence [does he derive the necessity for a benediction] for things not planted, like meat, eggs, fish? It is, however, a generally held opinion that  a man is forbidden to enjoy anything of this world without a benediction. ",

Isaac in the name of R. Johanan :  Over olive-oil we pronounce the benediction \"...Who createst the fruit of the tree\" ! ",

Meir has declared : From the statement of Scripture,  \"Ye shall deem it an uncircumcision with its fruit\" (Lev. xix. 23), do I not know that a food-bearing tree is intended ?  Why, then, is there a teaching to tell us \"trees for food\" (ibid.)? To include a tree whose wood and fruit taste alike. And which is that? Pepper ; to teach thee that pepper is subject to 'Orlah, and to teach thee that the Land of Israel lacks nothing ; as it is said,  \"A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it\" (Deut. viii. 9)!",

Rab Judah maintained [that the benediction should be]  \"...By Whose word all things exist,\" being of the opinion that the honey is the principal ingredient ;  whereas Rab Kahana maintained it is \"...Who createst various kinds of foods,\" holding that the flour is the principal ingredient.

Another reason is :  The benediction over the wine is constant but that over the day is not constant,  and when we have that which is constant and not constant, the former takes precedence.  The Halakah is in agreement with Bet Hillel. ", 
            "Why is this other reason necessary ?  Shouldest thou say that there [Bet Shammai offer] two reasons but here [Bet Hillel offer] only one, therefore here also we have two reasons.  \"The benediction over the wine is constant but that over the day is not constant, and when we have that which is constant and not constant, the former takes precedence.

Judah said :  Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel do not differ that the benediction over food comes first and Habdalah afterwards ; in what do they differ ?  About light and spices — Bet Shammai declare :  Light and afterwards spices, whereas Bet Hillel declare :  Spices and afterwards light. ",

Who hast uprooted idolatry from our land.\" ",

            " For rain and good tidings he says,  \"Blessed... Who art good and dispensest good.\"  For bad tidings he says,  \"Blessed be the true Judge.\"  He who has built a new house or bought new vessels says,  \"Blessed... Who hast kept us in life, hast preserved us and enabled us to reach this season,\"  One says the benediction for a calamity apart from any attendant good, and for good fortune apart from any attendant evil ;", 
            "but he who supplicates concerning that which is past utters a vain prayer.  If his wife is pregnant and he says,  \"May it be Thy will that my wife bear a son,\" behold that is a vain prayer.  If he were on the way, and hearing a cry of lamentation in the city, exclaims,  \"May it be Thy will that it be not within my house,\" behold that is a vain prayer. ", 
            "He who enters a town should offer prayer twice, once on entering and once on leaving.  Ben 'Azzai says :  Four times, twice on entering and twice on leaving. He gives thanks for what is past and supplicates for what is yet to be. ",

R. Nathan says :  [This means,] They have made void Thy law, because it is time for the Lord to work.  GEMARA Whence have we this? ",

            " Lo, there was the man who was journeying by 'Eber Jamina when a lion attacked him, and a miracle was wrought for him and he was rescued.  He came before Raba who told him :  Whenever thou reachest that spot, say \"Blessed... Who hast wrought a miracle for me in this place.\"  And Mar b.

Who hast wrought for me a miracle in 'Arabot and with the camel\" ; and whenever he came to the market-place of Mahoza he said,  \"Blessed... Who hast wrought for me a miracle with the camel and in 'Arabot.\"  They answer :  In the case of a miracle wrought on behalf of the many, everybody is obliged to utter the benediction; but in the case of a miracle wrought on behalf of an individual, only he is obliged to say it. Our Rabbis have taught :  He who beholds the fords of the [Red] Sea, or the fords of the Jordan, or the fords of the valleys of Arnon, or the hail-stones in the descent of Bet Horon, or the stone which Og, king of Bashan, sought to cast upon Israel, or the stone upon which Moses sat when Joshua fought against Amalek, or [the pillar of salt of] Lot's wife, or the wall of Jericho which was swallowed up in its place — over all these one must give thanks and praise before the All-present.  It is quite right with the fords of the [Red] Sea ; for it is written,",

But the fords of the valleys of Arnon — whence is it [that a benediction is necessary]?  For it is written,",

When Et and Heb came and saw blood issuing from between the rocks, they went and told the Israelites and uttered a song. That is what is written,  \"And he poured out the valleys that incline toward the seat of Ar and lean upon the border of Moab\" (ibid. v. 15). ", 
            "\"Hail-stones\" abne elgabish. What are abne elgabish ?", 
            " It has been taught :  They are stones which remained suspended [in the air] for the sake of a man and descended for the sake of a man.  They remained suspended for the sake of a man, viz.: Moses; for it is written,  \"Now the man Moses was very meek\" (Num. xii. 3), and it is written,  \"And the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain poured not upon the earth\" (Exod. ix, 33).  They descended for the sake of a man, viz. Joshua ; for it is written,  \"Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is spirit\" (Num. xxvii. 18), and it is written,  \"And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth-horon, that the Lord cast down great stones\" (Josh. x. 11).

I will go and uproot a mountain of the size of three Parsah, and cast it upon them so that I will kill them.\"  He went and uprooted a mountain of the size of three Parsah and carried it upon his head ; but the Holy One, blessed be He, sent ants which bored a hole through it so that it sank about his neck. ", 
            "As he sought to draw it off, his teeth were extended on both sides, so that it was impossible to extricate himself. That is what is written,  \"Thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked\" (Ps. iii. 8) ;  and it is in accord with the statement of R. Simeon b. Lakish who said:  What means that which is written, \"Thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked\"? Read not \"Thou hast broken\" [shibbarta] but \"Thou hast prolonged\" [shirbabta]. ",

It has been taught :  For Lot and his wife we say two benedictions — for his wife one says,  \"Blessed be the true Judge\" ; and for Lot one says,  \"Blessed... Who rememberest the righteous.\"  R. Johanan said :  Even at the time of His wrath, the Holy One, blessed be He, remembers the righteous ; as it is said,  \"And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the Plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow\" (Gen. xix. 29). ", 
            "\"And the wall of Jericho which was swallowed up.\"  And the wall of Jericho which was swallowed up !  Lo, it fell !  As it is said,  \"And it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the horn, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat\" (Josh. vi. 20).  Since its breadth and height were equal, it must in consequence have been swallowed up [in the earth]. ",

They mounted up to the heaven, they went down to the deeps...  They reeled to and fro, and staggered like a drunken man...  They cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and He brought them out of their distresses.  He made the storm a calm...  Then were they glad because they were quiet...  Let them give thanks unto the Lord for His mercy, and for His wonderful works to the children of men\" (Ps. cvii. 23-31). ", 
            "\"They who journey in the desert\" — whence have we this ? For it is written,  \"They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way ; they found no city of habitation...Then they cried unto the Lord... and He led them by a straight way... Let them give thanks unto the Lord for His mercy\" (ibid. vv. 4-8). ", 
            "\"The invalid who recovers\" — whence have we this? For it is written,  \"Crazed because of the way of their transgression, and afflicted because of their iniquities, their soul abhorred all manner of food... They cried unto the Lord in their trouble... He sent His word and healed them...Let them give thanks unto the Lord for His mercy\" (Ps. cvii. 17—21).", 
            " \"The prisoner who has been set free\" — whence have we this?  For it is written,  \"Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death... because they rebelled against the words of God... Therefore He humbled their heart with travail...  They cried unto the Lord in their trouble...  He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death...  Let them give thanks unto the Lord for His mercy\" (ibid. vv. 10-15). ",

Rab Judah said,  \"Blessed ...Who bestowest lovingkindnesses.\"  Abbai said :  It is necessary for him to offer his thanksgiving in the presence of ten ; for it is written,  \"Let them exalt Him in the assembly of the people\" etc. (ibid. 5:32).  Mar Zotra said :  Two of them must be Rabbis ; as it is said,  \"And praise Him in the seat of the elders\" (ibid.).",

            "\"He who prolongs his stay at table\" — perhaps a poor man will come and he will give him [some food] ; for it is written, \"The altar of wood three cubits high... and he said unto me, This is the table that is before the Lord\" (Ezek. 41:22). He opens with \"altar\" and concludes with \"table\"!  R. Johanan and R. Eleazar both say :  So long as the Temple was in existence, the altar used to atone for Israel, but now a man's table atones for him.", 
            "\"He who prolongs his stay in the privy\" — is that a virtue? Lo, there is a teaching : Ten things cause a man piles :  Eating the leaves of reeds, the leaves of the vine, the sprouts of the vine, the palate of an animal, the backbone of a fish, salted fish which has not been sufficiently cooked, to drink the lees of wine, to wipe oneself [after evacuation] with lime, potters' clay, or pebbles with which another has wiped himself ; and some add :  Also unduly to strain oneself in the privy !", 
            "There is no contradiction ; the latter refers to one who stays and strains, the other to one who stays long but does not strain.", 
            "It is like the incident where a certain matron said to R. Judah b. R. El'ai,  \"Thy face is like that of pig-rearers and usurers.\"  He replied,  \"On my faith !  Both [occupations] are forbidden me ; but there are twenty-four privies from my lodging-place to the House of Study, and whenever I go there I test myself in all of them.\" ", 
            "Rab Judah also said : Three things shorten a man's days and years :  To be given a Scroll of the Torah from which to read [a portion in the Synagogue] and decline to read ; to be handed the cup of benediction to say Grace and decline ; and to give oneself an air of superiority. ",

Hamma b. R. Hannina said :  Why did Joseph die before his brothers? Because he gave himself superior airs. ", 
            "Rab Judah also said in the name of Rab : For three things it is necessary to offer supplication : A good king, a good year, and a good dream.  \"A good king\" — for it is written, \"The king's heart is in the hand of the Lord as the water-courses\" (Prov. xxi. 1).  \"A good year\" — for it is written, \"The eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year\" (Deut. 11:12). \"A good dream\" — for it is written, \"Wherefore cause Thou me to dream and make me to live\" (Is. 38:16).

Johanan said :  There are three things which the Holy One, blessed be He, Himself proclaims, viz. :  famine, plenty and a good leader.  \"Famine\" — for it is written, \"The Lord hath called for a famine\" (II Kings 8:1). \"Plenty\" — for it is written, \"I will call for the corn and will increase it\" (Ezek. 36:29). \"A good leader\" — for it is written, \"And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, See I have called by name Besalel, the son of Uri\" etc. (Exod. 31:1 f.).

Isaac said : \"We must not appoint a leader over the Community without first consulting them ; as it is said, \"See, the Lord hath called by name Besalel, the son of Uri\" (ibid. xxxv. 30).

            "R. Samuel b. Nahmani said in the name of R. Jonathan : He was called Basalel because of his wisdom :  for at the time that the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, \"Go, tell Besalel, 'Make for Me a tabernacle, an ark and vessels',\" Moses went and inverted the order, saying to him,  \"Make an ark and vessels and a tabernacle.\" He replied,  \"Moses, our teacher, it is the way of the world for a man to build a house and afterwards furnish it ; but thou sayest, 'Make for Me an ark, vessels and a tabernacle'!  Where shall I place the vessels which I make?

Rab Hisda also said :  When a dream is bad, the pain it causes is sufficient [to prevent its fulfilment], and when the dream is good, the joy it brings is sufficient.  Rab Joseph said :  As for a good dream, even in my own case, its cheerfulness frustrates it [so that it is not realised].

            "Amemar, Mar Zotra and Rab Ashe were sitting together; they said:  Let each one of us relate something which the others have not heard.  One of them commenced and said :  He who has seen a dream and knows not what he has seen, let him stand before the Kohanim at the time that they spread their hands [to pronounce the priestly benediction] and utter the following :  \"Lord of the universe ! I am Thine and my dreams are Thine ; a dream have I dreamed and I know not what it is. Whether I dreamed concerning myself, or my fellows dreamed concerning me, or I dreamed concerning others, if they be good dreams, strengthen and fortify them [and may they be fulfilled] like the dreams of Joseph ; but if they require to be remedied, heal them as the waters of Marah [were healed] by the hands of Moses our teacher, as Miriam [was healed] from her leprosy, as Hezekiah from his illness, and like the waters of Jericho [sweetened] by the hands of Elisha. And as Thou didst turn the curse of the wicked Balaam into a blessing, so do Thou turn all my dreams for me into good.\" He should conclude [his prayer] simultaneously with the Kohanim, so that the Congregation responds \"Amen.\"  But if not, let him say the following:  \"Thou majestic One in the heights, Who abidest in might, Thou art peace and Thy name is peace. May it be Thy will to grant us peace.\" ", 
            "The next commenced and said :  He who enters a town and is afraid of the Evil Eye, let him take his right thumb in his left hand and his left thumb in his right hand and say the following:  \"I, A the son of B, come from the seed of Joseph against whom the Evil Eye had no power ; as it is said, 'Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine by a fountain' (Gen. xlix. 22). Read not 'ale 'ayin 'by a fountain' but 'ole 'ayin 'overcoming the [Evil] Eye'.\"  R. Jose b. R. Hannina said : It may be derived from the verse :  \"And let them grow [weyidgu] into a multitude in the midst of the earth\" (ibid, xlviii. 16) ; i.e. as the fishes [dagim] in the sea are covered by the water and the Evil Eye cannot have power over them, in similar manner the Evil Eye has no power over the seed of Joseph.  Should he, however, be afraid of his own Evil Eye, let him gaze upon the wing of his left nostril. ", 
            "The third of them commenced and said :  He who is ill should not disclose the fact on the first day so as not to cause himself bad luck, but after that he may disclose it.  As when Raba fell ill, on the first day he did not disclose it, but after that be said to his attendant, \"Go, announce that  Raba is ill.  Let him who loves me pray on my behalf, and let him that hates me rejoice over my plight ; for it is written, 'Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thy heart be glad when he stumbleth ; lest the Lord see it and it displease Him, and He turn away His wrath from him' (Prov. xxiv. 17 f.).\" ",

Or if thou wilt I can say from this passage, \"That thou mayest know the thoughts of thy heart\" (ibid. v. 30).

To Raba he said :  The words \"the firstling of an ass\" (Exod. xiii. 13) have been erased from thy Tefillin.  Raba said to him :  I have myself seen that the words are there.

He said,  \"Give me a Zuz\" ;  but he refused and received no answer.  He said to him :  I dreamt that decay seized my whole hand. He replied :  Decay has seized all the [king's] silken garments.  The king's household heard of this and they brought the wardrobe-keeper to put him to death.  He said to the king,  \"Why me?

Also said R. Johanan:  The Holy One, blessed be He, will restore them to habitation ; as it is said, 'A Song of Ascents. They that trust in the Lord are as Mount Zion' (Ps. cxxv. 1) — just as the Holy One, blessed be He, will restore Mount Zion to habitation, so will He restore the houses of the righteous to habitation.\"  He perceived that his mind was still not at rest, so he said to him,  \"It is enough for the slave to be like his master.\" ",

There is a tradition that it never passes through the constellation of Orion, for if it did the world would he destroyed.  But we see that it does pass through !  It is its brightness that passes through, and so it seems as though it does actually pass through.  Rab Huna b. Rab Joshua said ;  It is the Veil [ Vilon] which is rent and rolled up, so that the light of the heaven [Rekia'] appears.

Rab Kattina was journeying by the way, and when he reached the entrance of the house of a necromancer a rumbling noise broke forth.  He said,  \"Does the necromancer know what this rumbling is?\"  The latter called to him,  \"Kattina, Kattina ! Why should I not know?  When the Holy One, blessed be He, remembers His children who dwell in misery among the nations of the world.

R. Nathan says :  The rumbling is due to His sighing; as it is said, \"I will satisfy My fury upon them, and I will be eased\" (ibid. v. 13).  The Rabbis say :  He treads upon the firmament ; as it is said, \"He giveth a noise, as they that tread grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth\" (Jer. xxv. 30).  Rab Aha b.

The Rabbis say :  The clouds pouring water one into the other; as it is said, \"At the sound of His giving a multitude of waters in the heavens\" (Jer. x. 13).  Rab Aha b. Jacob said :  It is a mighty lightning-flash which strikes against a cloud and the latter is shattered into hail-stones.  Rab Ashe said :  The clouds are hollow and a blast of wind comes and blows across their mouths, so it is like a blast across the mouth of a jar.  The most probable view is that of Rab Aha b. Jacob, that the lightning strikes, the clouds are made to rumble and rain descends. ",

Rab Pappa said to Abbai : But there is a proverbial expression,  \"If on opening the door [in the morning] there is rain, set down thy sack, O ass-driver, and lie on it\"!

Levi :  Thunder was only created to break the pride of the heart ; as it is said, \"God hath so made it that men should fear before Him\" (Eccles. iii. 14).  Also said R. Alexander in the nanie of R.Joshua b. Levi :  Who sees the rainbow should prostrate himself upon his face; as it is said, \"As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud...and when I saw it, I fell upon my face\" (Ezek. i. 28). In the West they curse one who acts thus, because it has the appearance as though he worships the rainbow ;  but he should certainly pronounce a benediction.

Baroka says:  [The benediction is, \"Blessed...] Who art faithful with Thy Covenant and fulfillest Thy word.\"  Rab Pappa said:  Let us therefore say both : \"Blessed ...

            "R. Eliezer, the son of R. Jose of Galilee, began [to speak] in honour of the hospitality and expounded :  \"And the Lord blessed Obed-Edom and all his house...because of the Ark of God\" (II Sam. vi. llf.). Can we not use here an a fortiori argument?  If the Ark which neither ate nor drank, but which Obed-Edom swept and besprinkled, brought him a blessing, how much more so one who entertains a disciple of the wise, giving him to eat and drink, and allowing him to enjoy his possessions !", 
            " What was the blessing wherewith He blessed him ?  R. Judah b. Zebida said :  It refers to Hamot and her eight daughters-in-law who each bore six children at one birth ;  "
        ], 
        [
            "as it is said, \"Peullethai the eighth son\" (I Chron. xxvi. 5), and it is written \"For God blessed him\" (ibid.), \"All these were the sons of Obed-Edom, they and their sons and their brethren, able men in strength for the service ; threescore and two of Obed-Edom\" (ibid. v. 8)[3]. ", 
            "R. Abin the Levite[4] said :  Whoever forces fate[5], fate will force him; but whoever yields to fate, fate yields to him. So was it with Rabbah and Rab Joseph ;", 
            " for Rab Joseph [was nicknamed] \"Sinai[6]\" and Rabbah \"the uprooter of mountains[7]. \"The time needed them[8]; so [the electors] sent [a message] there[9],  \"Of 'Sinai' and 'the uprooter of mountains,' which should be given preference?\"  They returned answer,  \"'Sinai' should be preferred, because all stand in need of an owner of wheat[10].\"  Nevertheless Rab Joseph did not accept the offer, because the Chaldeans[11] told him,  \"Thou wilt reign only two years[12].\"", 
            " Rabbah ruled two and twenty years[13], and then Rab Joseph two and a half; ", 
            "but all the years that Rabbah ruled he never called a cupper to his house[14]. ", 
            "R. Abin the Levite also said :  What means that which is written, \"The Lord answer thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob set thee up on high\" (Ps. xx. 2)? The God of Jacob, but not the God of Abraham and Isaac ! From this we learn that the owner of a beam should go in with the heaviest part of it[1]. ", 
            "R. Abin the Levite also said :  Whoever partakes of a meal at which a disciple of the wise is present is as though he partakes of the lustre of the Shekinah; as it is said, \"And Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God\" (Exod. xviii. 12).  Did they eat before God?  Was it not before Moses that they ate? ", 
            "But it means to tell thee that  whoever partakes of a meal at which a disciple of the wise is present is as though he partakes of the lustre of the Shekinah. ", 
            "R. Abin the Levite also said :  One who takes leave of his friend should not say to him, \"Go in peace\" but \"Go to peace\";  because in the case of Jethro who said to Moses \"Go to peace\" (Exod. iv. 18), the latter advanced and prospered ; but in the case of David who said to Absalom \"Go in peace\" (II Sam. xv. 9), the latter went and was hanged. ", 
            "R. Abin the Levite also said :  One who takes leave of the dead should not say to him, \"Go to peace\" but \"Go in peace\" ; as it is said, \"But thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace\" (Gen. xv. 15). ", 
            "R. Levi b. Hiyya said[2]:  He who goes out from the Synagogue and enters the House of Study to occupy himself with Torah is worthy to receive the presence of the Shekinah; as it is said, \"They go from strength to strength, every one of them appeareth before God in Zion\" (Ph. Ixxxiv. 8). ", 
            "R. Hiyya b. Ashe said in the name of Rab[3] :  The disciples of the wise have rest neither in this world nor in the world to come; as it is said, \"They go from strength to strength, every one of them appeareth before God in Zion.\" ", 
            "R. Eleazar said in the name of R. Hannina:  The disciples of the wise increase peace in the world; as it is said, \"And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord ; and great shall be the peace of thy children\" (Is. liv. 13). Read not banayik \"thy children\" but bonayik \"thy builders[1]\"", 
            " \"Great peace have they that love Thy law; and there is no stumbling for them\" (Ps. cxix. 165). \"Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces\" (ibid, cxxii. 7). \"For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee\" (ibid. v. 8). \"For the sake of the house of the Lord our God, I will seek thy good\" (ibid. v. 9). \"The Lord will give strength unto His people ; the Lord will bless His people with peace\" (ibid. xxix. 11)[2] ",
