            "The beginning of tractate <i>Berakhot</i>, the first tractate in the first of the six orders of Mishna, opens with a discussion of the recitation of <i>Shema</i>, as the recitation of <i>Shema</i> encompasses an acceptance of the yoke of Heaven and of the mitzvot, and as such, forms the basis for all subsequent teachings. The Mishna opens with the laws regarding the appropriate time to recite <i>Shema</i>: <br><br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>From when,</b> that is, from what time, does <b>one recite <i>Shema</i> in the evening? From the time when the priests enter to partake of their <i>teruma.</i></b> Until when does the time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> extend? <b>Until the end of the first watch.</b> The term used in the Torah (Deuteronomy 6:7) to indicate the time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> is <i>beshokhbekha</i>, when you lie down, which refers to the time in which individuals go to sleep. Therefore, the time for the recitation of <i>Shema</i> is the first portion of the night, when individuals typically prepare for sleep. <b>That is the statement of Rabbi Eliezer.</b>",
            "<b>The Rabbis say:</b> The time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> is <b>until midnight.</b>",
            "<b>Rabban Gamliel says:</b> One may recite <i>Shema</i> <b>until dawn,</b> indicating that <i>beshokhbekha</i> is to be understood as a reference to the entire time people sleep in their beds, the whole night.",
            "The mishna relates that Rabban Gamliel practiced in accordance with his ruling. There was an <b>incident</b> where Rabban Gamliel’s <b>sons returned</b> very late <b>from a wedding hall. They said to him,</b> as they had been preoccupied with celebrating with the groom and bride: <b>We did not recite <i>Shema.</i> He said to them: If the dawn has not</b> yet <b>arrived, you are obligated to recite</b> <i>Shema</i>. Since Rabban Gamliel’s opinion disagreed with that of the Rabbis, he explained to his sons that the Rabbis actually agree with him, <b>and</b> that it is <b>not only</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of the recitation of <i>Shema</i>, <b>but rather, wherever the Sages say until midnight, the mitzva</b> may be performed <b>until dawn.</b>",
            "Rabban Gamliel cites several cases in support of his claim, such as <b>the burning of fats and limbs</b> on the altar. Due to the quantity of offerings each day, the priests were often unable to complete the burning of all of the fats and limbs, so they continued to be burned into the night, as it is written: “This is the law of the burnt offering: The burnt offering shall remain upon the pyre on the altar all night until morning, while the fire on the altar burns it” (Leviticus 6:2). <b>And,</b> with regard to <b>all</b> sacrifices, such as the sin-offerings and the guilt-offerings <b>that are eaten for one day</b> and night; although the Sages state that they may be eaten only until midnight, by Torah law they may be eaten <b>until dawn.</b> This is in accordance with the verse: “On the day on which it is offered must you eat. Do not leave it until the morning” (Leviticus 7:15). <b>If so, why did the Sages say</b> that they may be eaten only <b>until midnight?</b> This is <b>in order to distance a person from transgression,</b> as if one believes that he has until dawn to perform the mitzva, he might be negligent and postpone it until the opportunity to perform the mitzva has passed.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Mishna opens with the laws concerning the appropriate time to recite <i>Shema</i> with the question: From when does one recite <i>Shema</i> in the evening? With regard to this question, the Gemara asks: <b>On the basis of what</b> prior knowledge <b>does</b> the <b><i>tanna</i></b> of our mishna ask: <b>From when?</b> It would seem from his question that the obligation to recite <i>Shema</i> in the evening was already established, and that the <i>tanna</i> seeks only to clarify details that relate to it. But our mishna is the very first mishna in the Talmud.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And furthermore, what distinguishes the evening</b> <i>Shema</i>, that it was taught <b>first? Let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach</b> regarding the recitation of <b>the morning</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>first.</b> Since most mitzvot apply during the day, the <i>tanna</i> should discuss the morning <i>Shema</i> before discussing the evening <i>Shema</i>, just as the daily morning offering is discussed before the evening offering (<i>Tosefot HaRosh</i>).",
            "The Gemara offers a single response to both questions: <b>The <i>tanna</i> bases himself on the verse as it is written:</b> “You will talk of them when you sit in your home, and when you walk along the way, <b>when you lie down, and when you arise”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:7). By teaching the laws of the evening <i>Shema</i> first, the <i>tanna</i> has established that the teachings of the Oral Torah correspond to that which is taught in the Written Torah. <b>And</b> based on the Written Torah, <b>the <i>tanna</i> teaches</b> the oral law: <b>When is the time for the recitation of <i>Shema</i> of lying down</b> as commanded in the Torah? <b>From when the priests enter to partake of their <i>teruma</i>.</b> Just as the Written Torah begins with the evening <i>Shema</i>, so too must the Oral Torah.",
            "However, there is another possible explanation for why the mishna opens with the evening <i>Shema</i> rather than with the morning <i>Shema</i>. <b>If you wish,</b> you could <b>say</b> instead that the <i>tanna</i> <b>derives</b> the precedence of the evening <i>Shema</i> <b>from the</b> order of the <b>creation of the world. As it is written</b> in the story of creation: <b>“And there was evening, and there was morning, one day”</b> (Genesis 1:5). According to this verse, day begins with the evening and not the morning. For both of these reasons it was appropriate to open the discussion of the laws of the recitation of <i>Shema</i> with the evening <i>Shema</i>.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> why does the <b>latter clause</b> of the mishna, which appears later in the chapter, <b>teach: In the morning one recites two</b> blessings <b>before</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>and one</b> blessing <b>afterward, and in the evening one recites two</b> blessings <b>before</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>and two afterward?</b> Based upon the above reasoning, the mishna <b>should have taught</b> the blessing recited before and after the <b>evening</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>first.</b>",
            "The Gemara answers: Indeed, the <b><i>tanna</i> began</b> by discussing the laws regarding the recitation of <b>the evening</b> <i>Shema</i>, <b>and then taught</b> the laws regarding the recitation of <b>the morning</b> <i>Shema</i>. <b>Once</b> he <b>was already dealing with the morning</b> <i>Shema</i>, <b>he explained the matters of the morning</b> <i>Shema</i>, <b>and then explained the matters of the evening</b> <i>Shema</i>.",
            "The Gemara proceeds to clarify the rest of the mishna. <b>The Master said</b> in the mishna that the beginning of the period when one recites <i>Shema</i> in the evening is <b>when the priests enter to partake of their <i>teruma</i>.</b> However, this does not specify a definitive time. <b>When do the priests enter to partake of their <i>teruma</i>? From the time of the emergence of the stars.</b> If that is the case, then <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach</b> that the time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> is <b>from the time of the emergence of the stars.</b>",
            "The Gemara responds: Indeed it would have been simpler to say that the time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> begins with the emergence of the stars, but the particular expression used by the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> another <b>matter in passing: When do priests partake of their <i>teruma</i>? From the time of the emergence of the stars. And</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> a new <i>halakha</i> parenthetically: failure to bring an <b>atonement</b> offering <b>does not prevent</b> a priest from eating <i>teruma</i>. In cases where an impure priest is required to immerse himself in a ritual bath and bring an atonement offering, even if he already immersed himself, he is not completely ritually pure until he brings the atonement offering. Nevertheless, he is still permitted to partake of <i>teruma</i>. Taught in passing in our mishna, this is articulated fully in a <i>baraita</i>, based on a close reading of the biblical passages. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the laws of ritual impurity, it is said: “One who touches it remains impure until evening. He should not eat of the consecrated items and he must wash his flesh with water. And the sun sets and it is purified. Afterwards, he may eat from the <i>teruma</i>, for it is his bread” (Leviticus 22:6–7). From the passage: <b>“And the sun sets and it is purified,”</b> that the absence of <b>the setting of his sun prevents him from partaking of <i>teruma</i>, but</b> failure to bring <b>the atonement</b> offering <b>does not prevent him from partaking of <i>teruma</i>,</b> may be inferred.",
            "The Gemara discusses the proof offered in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> do we know <b>that the</b> phrase: <b>“And the sun sets”</b> refers to <b>the</b> complete <b>setting of the sun,</b> and therefore, <b>“and it is purified”</b> refers to the fact that <b>the day is pure,</b> i.e., and the sun sets and it is purified is one phrase meaning that the sun will set, the air will clear, and the stars will emerge (Rav Hai Gaon)?"
        ],
        [
            "<b>Perhaps</b> the expression: “And the sun sets and it is purified” refers to the very beginning of sunset, <b>the setting of</b> the sun’s <b>light.</b> According to that explanation, <b>what does</b> the expression <b>and it is purified mean?</b> It means that <b>the person will become purified.</b> After immersing, he will wait until the beginning of sunset, and only then will he be able to eat of his <i>teruma</i> (<i>Tosafot</i>).",
            "<b>Rabba bar Rav Sheila said: If so,</b> that: And it is purified, means that the priest goes and purifies himself, then <b>let the verse say</b> unambiguously: <b>And he will become purified.</b> Since the Torah does not employ that language, the conclusion is: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the expression: <b>And it is purified?</b> It means <b>the day is pure,</b> no residue of day remains, <b>as people say</b> colloquially: <b>The sun has set and the day is purified.</b>",
            "<b>In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they did not hear this</b> explanation given <b>by Rabba bar Rav Sheila. They raised the dilemma: Does the expression: And the sun sets, refer to the</b> actual <b>setting of the sun, and does: And it is purified, mean the day clears away? Or perhaps it refers to the setting of its light</b> at sunset, in which case <b>what is</b> the meaning of: <b>And it is purified?</b> It refers to <b>the purification of the person.</b> In other words, in Eretz Yisrael, they attempted to clarify the <i>halakha</i> based on the biblical passage, but were unable to do so.",
            "<b>Ultimately they resolved</b> this dilemma <b>from a <i>baraita</i>. It was taught in a baraita</b> that the time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> corresponds to the time when priests are permitted to eat of their <i>teruma</i>, <b>a sign for which is the emergence of the stars.</b> Therefore, <b>derive from here</b> that “and the sun sets” refers to <b>the complete sunset, and the expression “and it is purified”</b> means <b>the day clears away,</b> as the Sages in Babylonia concluded.",
            "In our mishna, <b>the Master said:</b> The beginning of the time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> is: <b>From the time when the priests enter to partake of their <i>teruma</i>.</b> The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> to this opinion from a <i>baraita</i> that states that the time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> is: <b>From when a poor person enters to eat his bread with salt until he rises from his meal.</b>",
            "The Gemara begins its analysis by clarifying whether there is an actual contradiction here, or whether different expressions are being employed to describe the same time. <b>The latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, which established that the time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> ends when a poor person rises from his meal, <b>certainly disagrees with our mishna.</b> Since the poor person clearly does not continue eating until the end of the first watch, this <i>baraita</i> certainly contradicts our mishna. With regard to <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, however, which establishes the beginning of the time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i>, <b>shall we say that it disagrees with our mishna?</b>",
            "The Gemara immediately rejects this idea: <b>No,</b> the time when <b>the poor person</b> eats <b>and</b> the time when <b>the priest</b> is purified and permitted to partake of his <i>teruma</i> <b>are one</b> and the same <b>time.</b>",
            "The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>From when does one begin to recite</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>in the evening? From the time when people enter to eat their bread on Shabbat eve.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> As they do in our mishna, <b>the Rabbis say: From the time when the priests are eligible to partake of their <i>teruma</i>, a sign for which is the emergence of the stars. And although there is no</b> explicit <b>proof</b> that the emergence of the stars is when one may begin to recite the evening <i>Shema</i>, <b>there is an allusion</b> in the book of Nehemiah to the fact that the emergence of the stars is generally considered the beginning of the night. As <b>it is stated</b> with regard to the building of the walls of Jerusalem: <b>“And we perform the work, and half of them grasp their spears from dawn until the emergence of the stars”</b> (Nehemiah 4:15). <b>And it says: “That in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labor in the day”</b> (Nehemiah 4:16). From here we ascertain that the day ends with the emergence of the stars.",
            "Even before analyzing these sources, the Gemara seeks to clarify a confusing element in the <i>Tosefta</i>. In their biblical proof, the Rabbis do not suffice with one verse, but rather they say: And it says…and they cite an additional verse. <b>What</b> is added by this use of: <b>And it says?</b> It seems superfluous, as the entire proof appears in the first verse.",
            "The Gemara answers that the first verse was not sufficient. <b>As, if you say that night begins when the sun sets, but</b> the workers <b>stayed late and arrived early;</b> i.e., due to the importance of their task they worked even into the night. In anticipation of this objection, the second verse was cited to teach: <b>Come and hear,</b> as it is stated: <b>“That in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labor in the day,”</b> the time between dawn and the emergence of the stars is explicitly referred to as “day,” proving that night begins with the emergence of the stars.",
            "In analyzing the three opinions regarding the beginning of the period for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i>, the Gemara begins with the supposition: <b>It might enter your mind</b> to say that the time when the <b>poor person</b> typically eats his meal and the time when ordinary <b>people</b> eat their Shabbat evening meal <b>are one</b> and the same <b>time,</b> since in both cases those eating would seek to begin their meals as early as possible, as, for different reasons, they are unable to kindle additional lights to illuminate their meal. And, <b>if you say</b> that the time of <b>the poor person’s</b> meal <b>and</b> the time when <b>the priest</b> is purified and permitted to partake of his <i>teruma</i> <b>are one</b> and the same <b>time,</b> then the opinion of <b>the Rabbis is</b> identical to that of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b> What is their disagreement?",
            "<b>Rather,</b> what we said previously must be rejected, and instead <b>learn from this</b> that there is <b>a separate time</b> for the <b>poor person and a separate time</b> for the <b>priest.</b> However, this conclusion is based on the assumption that the time of the poor person and the time of people are the same. That too can be rejected with the assertion that, <b>no,</b> the time of the <b>poor person and the priest are one</b> and the same <b>time,</b> and the time of <b>the poor person and people are not the same.</b> Accordingly, the opinion expressed by the <i>tanna</i> in our <i>baraita</i> is identical to that of the other <i>tanna’im</i>, and only Rabbi Meir disagrees with them.",
            "<b>And is the time of the poor person and the priest the same?</b> The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> to this approach from another <i>baraita</i>, in which other opinions regarding the time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> are cited: <b>From when does one begin to recite</b> the <b>evening</b> <i>Shema</i>? <br><b>From the time when the day becomes sanctified on the eve of Shabbat, this is the statement of Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who established an earlier time for <i>Shema</i>. <br><b>Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> like our mishna, <b>says: From the time when the priests are eligible to partake of their <i>teruma</i>.</b> <br><b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> The time for the recitation of <i>Shema</i> begins before the priests were purified, <b>from when the priests immerse themselves in order to partake of their <i>teruma</i>.</b> <br><b>Rabbi Yehuda said to</b> Rabbi Meir: How is it possible that the time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> corresponds to the time of the priests’ immersion? <b>Do the priests not immerse themselves during the day,</b> so that with nightfall and the onset of a new day they will be purified? If so, how can that time be called night? <br><b>Rabbi Ḥanina says</b> that the time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> begins <b>when the poor person enters to eat his bread with salt.</b> <br>But <b>Rabbi Aḥai, and some say Rabbi Aḥa, says: From the time when most people enter to recline</b> at their meal during the week.",
            "The preceding was the text of the <i>baraita</i>. Returning to our question, <b>if you say</b> that <b>the time of the poor person and the priest are one</b> and the same <b>time,</b> then the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina is</b> identical to that of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua.</b> However, the fact that they are cited together indicates that they are not, in fact, the same.",
            "<b>Rather, must</b> one <b>not conclude from this the time for</b> the <b>poor person is separate and the time for</b> the <b>priest is separate?</b> Since no objection is raised, the Gemara concedes: Indeed, <b>conclude from this.</b>",
            "Having established that the time of the poor person and that of the priest are different, the Gemara seeks to determine: <b>which one is later?</b> The Gemara suggests that <b>it is reasonable</b> to conclude that <b>the</b> time of the <b>poor person is later. As if you say</b> that <b>the poor person is earlier,</b> it would be impossible to establish a time earlier than that established by Rabbi Yehoshua, unless we hold that night begins with sunset, in which case the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina is</b> identical to that of <b>Rabbi Eliezer. Rather, must</b> one <b>not conclude from this that the poor person is later?</b> The Gemara notes: Indeed, <b>conclude from this.</b>",
            "We learned that <b>the Master said</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> according to Rabbi Meir begins with the time of the immersion of the priests. Regarding this, <b>Rabbi Yehuda said</b> to Rabbi Meir: <b>Do the priests not immerse themselves during the day?</b>",
            "The Gemara notes: <b>What Rabbi Yehuda said to Rabbi Meir seems correct,</b> and how can Rabbi Meir respond? Rabbi Meir’s response is connected to the fundamental dispute over when night begins. After sunset, a period begins which is neither day nor night. The <i>tanna’im</i> disagree over the precise duration of this period known as twilight [<i>bein hashemashot</i>]. Rabbi Yehuda holds that twilight extends a full hour after sunset. Rabbi Neḥemya agrees in principle, though he disagrees over the specifics. Rabbi Yosei maintains that twilight is very brief, and occurs immediately before the emergence of the stars, which marks the beginning of the night. Regarding Rabbi Meir’s argument, Rabbi Yehuda asks that since the priests immerse themselves before twilight, they have a long wait until nightfall; clearly their immersion takes place while it is still day.",
            "The Gemara answers that <b>Rabbi Meir said</b> to Rabbi Yehuda <b>as follows</b>: <b>Do you maintain that I am speaking of your</b> definition of <b>twilight? I am speaking of Rabbi Yosei’s</b> definition of <b>twilight, as Rabbi Yosei said: Twilight is like the blink of an eye;</b> night <b>begins and</b> day <b>ends and</b> the time between them is so brief, <b>it is impossible to quantify.</b> According to this opinion, the priests immerse themselves just before the emergence of the stars, when it is already considered night."
        ],
        [
            "The previous baraita cited Rabbi Meir’s opinion that the time for the recitation of <i>Shema</i> begins when the priests immerse before partaking of their <i>teruma</i>. In the <i>Tosefta</i>, it was taught that Rabbi Meir holds that one begins to recite <i>Shema</i> from when people enter to eat their meal on Shabbat eve. One opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir</b> seems to <b>contradict</b> another opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir</b>. The Gemara responds: <b>Two <i>tanna’im</i>,</b> students of Rabbi Meir, expressed different opinions <b>in accordance with Rabbi Meir’s</b> opinion.",
            "So too, the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer</b> cited in the mishna <b>contradicts</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer</b> cited in the <i>baraita</i>. In the mishna, Rabbi Eliezer holds that the time for the recitation of <i>Shema</i> begins with the emergence of the stars: From the time when the priests enter to partake of their <i>teruma</i>, while in the <i>baraita</i>, he states that the time for the recitation of <i>Shema</i> begins when the day becomes sanctified on the eve of Shabbat.",
            "The Gemara responds: There are two possible resolutions to the apparent contradiction in Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion. Either <b>two</b> <i>tanna’im</i> expressed different opinions <b>in accordance with Rabbi Eliezer’s</b> opinion, <b>or if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna, according to which we begin to recite <i>Shema</i> when the priests enter to partake of their <i>teruma</i>, <b>is not</b> actually <b>Rabbi Eliezer’s</b> opinion. Only the second half of the statement: Until the end of the first watch, was stated by Rabbi Eliezer.",
            "In the mishna, we learned that Rabbi Eliezer establishes that one may recite the evening <i>Shema</i> <b>until the end of the first watch.</b> These watches are mentioned in the Bible as segments of the night, but it must be established: Into precisely how many segments is the night divided, three or four? Moreover, why does Rabbi Eliezer employ such inexact parameters rather than a more precise definition of time (<i>Tosefot HaRosh</i>)?",
            "<b>What does Rabbi Eliezer</b> actually <b>hold? If he holds that the night consists of three watches, let him say</b> explicitly that one recites the evening <i>Shema</i> <b>until the fourth hour. If he holds that the night consists of four watches, let him say</b> explicitly <b>until the third hour.</b>",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>Actually,</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>holds that the night consists of three watches,</b> and he employs this particular language of watches <b>in order to teach us: There are watches in heaven and there are watches on earth;</b> just as our night is divided into watches, so too is the night in the upper worlds. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The night consists of three watches, and over each and every watch, the Holy One, Blessed be He, sits and roars like a lion</b> in pain over the destruction of the Temple. This imagery is derived from a reference in the Bible, <b>as it is stated: “The Lord roars [<i>yishag</i>] from on high, from His holy dwelling He makes His voice heard. He roars mightily</b> [<b><i>shaog yishag</i></b>] <b>over His dwelling place,</b> He cries out like those who tread grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth” (Jeremiah 25:30). The three instances of the root <i>shin-alef-gimmel</i> in this verse correspond to the three watches of the night.",
            "<b>And signs of</b> the transition between each of <b>these</b> watches in the upper world can be sensed in this world: In <b>the first watch, the donkey brays;</b> in <b>the second, dogs bark;</b> and in <b>the third</b> people begin to rise, <b>a baby nurses from its mother’s breast and a wife converses with her husband.</b>",
            "With regard to these earthly manifestations of the three heavenly watches as established in the <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara asks: <b>What did Rabbi Eliezer enumerate? If</b> he <b>enumerated the beginning of the watch, why do I need a sign for the beginning of the first watch? It is</b> when <b>evening</b> begins; an additional sign is superfluous. <b>If he enumerated the end of the watches, why do I need a sign for the end of the last watch? It is</b> when <b>day</b> begins; an additional sign is similarly superfluous.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, he enumerated</b> the signs for <b>the end of the first watch and the beginning of the last watch,</b> both of which require a sign, as well as <b>the middle of the middle</b> watch. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>He enumerated the ends of all</b> of the watches. <b>And if you say</b> that a sign indicating the end of the <b>final</b> watch <b>is unnecessary</b> because it is day, nevertheless, that sign is useful.",
            "<b>What is the practical ramification</b> of this sign? It is relevant <b>to one who recites</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>while lying in a dark house,</b> who cannot see the dawn and <b>who does not know when the time for reciting <i>Shema</i></b> arrives. That person is provided with a sign that <b>when a woman speaks with her husband and a baby nurses from its mother’s breast,</b> the final watch of the night has ended and <b>he must rise and recite</b> <i>Shema</i>.",
            "<b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Shmuel said in the name of Rav: The night consists of three watches, and over each and every watch the Holy One, Blessed be He sits and roars like a lion,</b> because the Temple service was connected to the changing of these watches (<i>Tosefot HaRosh</i>), <b>and says: “Woe to Me, that due to their sins I destroyed My house, burned My Temple and exiled them among the nations of the world.”</b>",
            "Incidental to the mention of the elevated significance of the night watches, the Gemara cites a related story: <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei said: I was once walking along the road when I entered</b> the <b>ruins</b> of an old, abandoned building <b>among the ruins of Jerusalem</b> in order <b>to pray.</b> I noticed that <b>Elijah, of blessed memory, came and guarded the entrance for me and waited at the entrance until I finished my prayer. When I finished praying</b> and exited the ruin, Elijah <b>said to me,</b> deferentially as one would address a Rabbi: <b>Greetings to you, my Rabbi. I answered him: Greetings to you, my Rabbi, my teacher. And</b> Elijah <b>said to me: My son, why did you enter this ruin? I said to him:</b> In order <b>to pray. And</b> Elijah <b>said to me: You should have prayed on the road. And I said to him:</b> I was unable to pray along the road, because <b>I was afraid that I might be interrupted by travelers</b> and would be unable to focus. Elijah <b>said to me: You should have recited the abbreviated prayer</b> instituted for just such circumstances.",
            "Rabbi Yosei concluded: <b>At that time,</b> from that brief exchange, <b>I learned from him, three things: I learned that one may not enter a ruin; and I learned</b> that one need not enter a building to pray, but <b>he may pray along the road; and I learned that one who prays along the road recites an abbreviated prayer</b> so that he may maintain his focus.",
            "<b>And</b> after this introduction, Elijah <b>said to me: What voice did you hear in that ruin?</b> <br><b>I responded: I heard a Heavenly voice,</b> like an echo of that roar of the Holy One, Blessed be He (Maharsha), <b>cooing like a dove and saying: Woe to the children, due to whose sins I destroyed My house, burned My Temple, and exiled them among the nations.</b><br><b>And</b> Elijah <b>said to me:</b> By <b>your life and by your head, not only</b> did that voice <b>cry out in that moment, but it cries out three times each and every day. Moreover,</b> any time that God’s greatness is evoked, such as <b>when Israel enters synagogues and study halls and answers</b> in the <i>kaddish</i> prayer, <b>May His great name be blessed, the Holy One, Blessed be He, shakes His head and says: Happy is the king who is thus praised in his house.</b> When the Temple stood, this praise was recited there, but now: <b>How</b> great is the pain of <b>the father who exiled his children, and woe to the children who were exiled from their father’s table,</b> as their pain only adds to that of their father (Rabbi Shem Tov ibn Shaprut).",
            "<b>The Sages taught, for three reasons one may not enter a ruin: Because of suspicion</b> of prostitution, <b>because</b> the ruin is liable to <b>collapse,</b> and <b>because of demons.</b> Three separate reasons seem extraneous, so the Gemara asks: Why was the reason <b>because of suspicion</b> necessary? <b>Let this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>be derived because of collapse.</b>"

            "The Gemara answers: This <i>halakha</i> applies even <b>in</b> the case of a <b>new,</b> sturdy ruin, where there is no danger of collapse. Therefore, the reason because of suspicion is cited in order to warn one not to enter a new ruin as well.",
            "The Gemara continues to object: <b>And let this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>be derived because of demons?</b> The Gemara answers: Demons are only a threat to individuals, so because of demons would not apply to a case <b>where two</b> people enter a ruin together.",
            "The Gemara objects: But <b>if there are two</b> people entering a ruin together, then <b>there is no suspicion either.</b> There is no prohibition against two men to be alone with a woman as, in that case, there is no suspicion of untoward behavior. Consequently, if two men enter a ruin together, there is no room for suspicion. The Gemara answers: If <b>two individuals</b> known to be <b>immoral</b> enter together, there is suspicion even though there are two of them.",

            "The Gemara responds: There are times when this reason is necessary, e.g., when <b>two upstanding individuals</b> enter a ruin together. Although there is neither concern of suspicion nor of demons, there remains concern lest the ruin collapse.",

            "The Gemara points out, however, that <b>if there are two people, there is also no</b> concern of <b>demons.</b> As such, the question remains: In what case can demons be the sole cause not to enter a ruin?",
            "The Gemara responds: Generally speaking, two individuals need not be concerned about demons; but, if they are <b>in their place,</b> i.e., a place known to be haunted by demons (see Isaiah 13:21), <b>we are concerned</b> about demons even with two people. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Actually,</b> this refers <b>to</b> the case of <b>an individual</b> entering <b>a new ruin located in a field.

            "<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>The night is comprised of four watches;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> The night is comprised of <b>three</b> watches.",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>What is Rabbi Natan’s reasoning? As it is written: “And Gideon, and the one hundred men who were with him, came to the edge of camp at the beginning of the middle watch”</b> (Judges 7:19). <b>It was taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>Middle means nothing other than</b> that <b>there is one before it and one after it.</b> From the fact that the verse refers to a middle watch, the fact that the night is comprised of three watches may be inferred.",

            "<b>What is Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s <b>reasoning?

Taken together, these verses indicate that their author, King David, rose at midnight, two watches before dawn, in order to study Torah. <b>How is it</b> possible to reconcile these two verses? Only if <b>there are four watches in the night</b> does one who rises two watches before dawn rise at midnight.",
            "<b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Natan</b> reconcile these two verses?

            "<b>Rav Ashi said</b> that the verses can be reconciled in accordance with Rabbi Natan’s opinion in another way: <b>One and one-half watches are still called watches</b> in plural. Therefore King David could rise at midnight yet maintain that he “forestalls the watches.”",
            "Following this discussion, another <i>halakha</i> that <b>Rabbi Zerika said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ami said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said</b> is cited: <b>Before the dead, one may speak only of matters relating to the dead,</b> as speaking of other matters appears to be contemptuous of the deceased, underscoring that he is unable to talk while those around him can. Therefore, one must remain fully engaged in matters relating to him.",
            "Two traditions exist with regard to the details of this <i>halakha</i> in the name of Rabbi Abba bar Kahana. According to one version, <b>Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said:</b> This <i>halakha</i> <b>was only said with regard to matters of Torah.</b> Speaking of <b>other matters, however, is not</b> prohibited, since no contempt is expressed for the deceased by the fact that he is unable to speak of such topics.",
            "<b>Others say</b> another version of this <i>halakha</i> in the name of Rabbi Abba bar Kahana: This <i>halakha</i> <b>was said even with regard to matters of Torah, and all the more so with regard to other matters.</b> If one must refrain from speaking of matters of Torah, regarding which one is commanded to speak, and limit himself to matters concerning the deceased, all the more so should he refrain from speaking of other matters, regarding which one is not commanded to speak.",
            "Incidental to the Gemara’s mention of King David, other sources are cited that describe his actions. Regarding that which was cited above, that he would rise in the middle of the night in order to serve his Creator, the Gemara asks: <b>Did David rise at midnight? He rose in the evening. As it is written: “I rose with the <i>neshef</i> and cried,</b> I hoped for Your word” (Psalms 119:147). <b>And how</b> do we know <b>that this <i>neshef</i> is the evening? As it is written: “In the <i>neshef</i>, in the evening of the day, in the blackness of night and the darkness”</b> (Proverbs 7:9). Apparently, King David did indeed rise when it was still evening.",
            "The Gemara suggests several ways to resolve this contradiction. <b>Rabbi Oshaya said</b> that <b>Rabbi Aḥa said: David said as follows: Midnight never passed me by in my sleep.</b> Sometimes I fulfilled the verse, “I rose with the <i>neshef</i> and cried,” but I always, at least, fulfilled the verse, “At midnight I rise to give thanks for Your righteous laws.”",
            "<b>Rabbi Zeira said: Until midnight,</b> David <b>would doze like a horse,</b> as a horse dozes, but never sleeps deeply. <b>From</b> midnight <b>on, he would gain the strength of a lion.

            "To this point, the discussion has been based on the assumption that <i>neshef</i> means evening. The Gemara asks: <b>Does <i>neshef</i></b> really <b>mean evening? Doesn’t <i>neshef</i> mean morning? As it is written: “And David slew them from the <i>neshef</i> until the evening of the next day”</b> (I Samuel 30:17). <b>Doesn’t</b> this verse mean <b>from the morning until the night,</b> in which case <i>neshef</i> must mean morning?",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> this verse means that David slew them <b>from</b> one <b>evening until</b> the next <b>evening.</b>",
            "The Gemara rejects this response: <b>If so, let</b> the verse <b>be written: From the <i>neshef</i> until the <i>neshef</i>, or from the evening until the evening.</b> Why would the verse employ two different terms for a single concept?",
            "<b>Rather, Rava said: There are two</b> times referred to as <b><i>neshef</i>,</b> and the word can refer to either evening or morning. <i>Neshef</i> must be understood in accordance with its Aramaic root: <b>The night moves</b> past <b>[</b><i>neshaf</i> ] <b>and the day arrives, and the day moves</b> past [<i>neshaf</i> ] <b>and the night arrives.</b>",
            "When King David said: At midnight I rise, the assumption is that he rose precisely at midnight. The Gemara asks: <b>Did David know</b> exactly <b>when it was midnight?

How do we know this about Moses? <b>As it is written</b> that he said to Pharaoh: “Thus said the Lord: <b>About midnight, I will go out into the midst of Egypt”</b> (Exodus 11:4).

            "The Gemara clarifies: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the expression: <b>About midnight?</b> Did Moses say it or did God say it? <b>If we say</b> that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, Himself, said: About midnight, to</b> Moses, <b>is there doubt before</b> God in <b>heaven?

Moses, the greatest of all the prophets, was uncertain, and <b>David knew?</b>",
            "The Gemara offers several answers to this question: <br><b>David had a sign</b> indicating when <b>it was midnight.</b> As <b>Rav Aḥa bar Bizna said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon Ḥasida said: A lyre hung over David’s bed, and once midnight arrived, the northern</b> midnight <b>wind would come and</b> cause <b>the lyre to play on its own.</b> David <b>would immediately rise</b> from his bed <b>and study Torah until the first rays of dawn.</b> <br><b>Once dawn</b> arrived, <b>the Sages of Israel entered</b> to advise <b>him</b> with regard to the various concerns of the nation and the economy. <b>They said to him: Our master, the king, your nation requires sustenance.</b> <br><b>He said: Go and sustain one another,</b> provide each other with whatever is lacking. <br>The Sages of Israel <b>responded to him</b> with a parable: <b>A single handful</b> of food <b>does not satisfy a lion, and a pit</b> will <b>not</b> be <b>filled</b> merely <b>from</b> the rain that falls directly into <b>its mouth,</b> but other water must be piped in (<i>ge’onim</i>). So too, the nation cannot sustain itself using its own resources. <br>King David <b>told them: Go and take up arms with the troops</b> in battle in order to expand our borders and provide our people with the opportunity to earn a livelihood.",
            "The Sages <b>immediately seek advice from Ahitophel</b> to determine whether or not it was appropriate to go to war at that time and how they should conduct themselves, <b>and they consult the Sanhedrin</b> in order to receive the requisite license to wage a war under those circumstances (<i>Tosefot HaRosh</i>). <b>And they ask the <i>Urim VeTummim</i></b> whether or not they should go to war, and whether or not they would be successful.",

            "The Gemara further explores King David’s character. It is said: “A prayer <b>of David…Keep my soul, for I am pious”</b> (Psalms 86:1–2). Levi and Rabbi Yitzḥak debated the meaning of this verse and how David’s piety is manifest in the fact that he went beyond his fundamental obligations. <b>One said:</b> David’s declaration of piety referred to his awakening during the night to pray, and <b>so said David before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, am I not pious? As all of the kings of the East and the West sleep until the third hour</b> of the day, <b>but</b> although I am a king like them, <b>“At midnight I rise to give thanks”</b> (Psalms 119:62).",
            "<b>And the other</b> Sage said: <b>David said the following before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, am I not pious? For all of the kings of the East and the West sit in groups</b> befitting <b>their honored</b> status, but I sit as a judge who issues rulings for the people. Women come with questions of ritual impurity and <b>my hands become soiled with</b> their <b>blood</b> as I labor to determine whether or not it is blood of impurity and she has menstruating woman status, <b>and</b> with <b>a fetus that miscarried</b> at a stage of development before it was clear whether or not it is considered a birth, <b>and</b> with <b>placenta,</b> which women sometimes discharge unrelated to the birth of a child (see Leviticus 15:19–30 with regard to blood, and 12:1–8 with regard to miscarriage and placenta). King David went to all this trouble <b>in order to render a woman ritually pure</b> and consequently permitted <b>to her husband.</b> If, after examination, a Sage declares the woman ritually pure, she is permitted to be with her husband, which leads to increased love and affection, and ultimately to procreation (Rabbi Yoshiyahu Pinto). <b>And not only</b> do I engage in activity considered to be beneath the station of a king, <b>but I consult my teacher, Mefivoshet,</b> son of King Saul’s son, Jonathan, with regard to <b>everything that I do.

            "<b>Rav Yehoshua, son of Rav Idi, said: What verse</b> alludes to this? <b>“And I speak Your testimonies before kings and I will not be ashamed”</b> (Psalms 119:46). This verse alludes both to David’s commitment to Torah, in contrast to the kings of the East and the West, as well as to the fact that he was not ashamed to discuss matters of Torah with Mefivoshet, a descendant of kings. David was not afraid to have his mistakes corrected by Mefivoshet.",
            "<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i> from a tannaitic tradition: <b>His name was not Mefivoshet, but rather Ish Boshet was his name. Why was</b> Ish Boshet <b>referred to as Mefivoshet? Because he would embarrass [<i>mevayesh</i>] David in matters of <i>halakha</i></b>. According to this approach, Mefivoshet is an abbreviation of <i>boshet panim</i>, embarrassment. <b>Because</b> David was not embarrassed to admit his errors, <b>he merited that Kilav,</b> who, according to tradition, was exceedingly wise, <b>would descend from him.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: His name was not Kilav; rather, his name was Daniel,</b> as it appears in a different list of David’s descendants. <b>Why was he called Kilav? Because he would embarrass [<i>makhlim</i>] Mefivoshet,</b> the teacher or authority figure [av] <b>in matters of <i>halakha.</i></b>",
            "<b>In his</b> book of <b>wisdom, Solomon said</b> about this wise son: <b>“My son, if your heart is wise, my heart will be glad, even mine”</b> (Proverbs 23:15), as David enjoyed witnessing his son Kilav develop into a Torah luminary to the extent that Kilav was able to respond to Mefivoshet. <b>And</b> Solomon <b>says</b> about Kilav: <b>“Be wise, my son, and make my heart glad, that I may respond to those who taunt me”</b> (Proverbs 27:11).",
            "With regard to David’s statement, “Keep my soul, for I am pious,” the Gemara asks: <b>Did David call himself pious? Isn’t it written: “If I had not [<i>luleh</i></b>] <b>believed to look upon the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living”</b> (Psalms 27:13). The dots that appear over the word <i>luleh</i> in the text indicate doubt and uncertainty of his piety, and whether he was deserving of a place in the land of the living (see <i>Avot DeRabbi Natan</i> 34). <b>In the name of Rabbi Yosei, it was taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>Why</b> do <b>dots</b> appear <b>over the word <i>luleh</i>,</b> as if there are some reservations? Because <b>David said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe. I</b> have every <b>confidence in You that You grant an excellent reward to the righteous in the World-to-Come</b> since God’s ultimate goodness is manifest in the land of eternal life, <b>but</b> I still harbor uncertainty with regard to myself, and <b>I do not know whether or not I</b> definitely <b>have a portion among them.</b> In any case, apparently David was uncertain whether or not he deserved to receive a portion of God’s reward for the righteous; how, then, could he characterize himself as pious?",
            "The Gemara responds: His concern does not prove anything, as King David knew that he was pious. He was simply concerned <b>lest a transgression</b> that he might commit in the future <b>will cause</b> him to lose his opportunity to look upon the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.",
            "The Gemara cites a proof that there is room for one to fear lest he commit a transgression in the future <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi, as Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi raised a contradiction</b> between two verses. <b>It is written</b> that God told Jacob in his vision of the ladder: <b>“Behold, I am with you and I guard you wherever you go”</b> (Genesis 28:15), yet when Jacob returned to Canaan and realized that Esau was coming to greet him, <b>it is written: “And Jacob became very afraid,</b> and he was pained” (Genesis 32:8). Why did Jacob not rely on God’s promise? Jacob had concerns and <b>said</b> to himself: <b>Lest a transgression</b> that I might have committed after God made His promise to me <b>will cause</b> God to revoke His promise of protection.",
            "Apparently, at times, transgression does cause God’s promise to go unfulfilled, <b>as it was taught</b> explicitly in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the ostensibly redundant language in a verse in the Song of the Sea: <b>“Until Your people will cross, Lord, until the people You have acquired will cross.</b> You bring them in and plant them in the mountain of Your inheritance, the place, Lord, which You made for Your dwelling” (Exodus 15:16–17).",
            "The Gemara interprets homiletically that <b>until Your people will cross</b> refers to the <b>first entry</b> into Eretz Yisrael during the time of Joshua, while <b>until the people You have acquired pass over</b> refers to the <b>second entry</b> following the exile in Babylonia. <b>Based on</b> the juxtaposition of these two entries in this single verse, <b>the Sages said: Israel was worthy of having a miracle performed on its</b> behalf <b>in the time of Ezra</b> the scribe, just <b>as</b> one <b>was performed on their</b> behalf <b>in the time of Joshua bin Nun. However, transgression caused</b> the absence of a miracle.",
            "The Gemara returns to explain what we learned in the mishna: <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> is <b>until midnight.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>do they hold</b> in explaining the verse: “When you lie down”? <b>If</b> they explain this verse <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who says that “when you lie down” is the time when people customarily go to sleep, then <b>let</b> the Rabbis also <b>say</b> that the time for the recitation of <i>Shema</i> extends, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> until the end of the first watch."

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the Rabbis <b>hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel,</b> and the fact <b>that they say until midnight is</b> in order <b>to distance a person from transgression. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, <b>the Rabbis created a “fence” for their pronouncements</b> with regard to the recitation of <i>Shema</i> <b>in order to prevent</b> a situation where <b>a person comes home from the field in the evening,</b> tired from his day’s work, and knowing that he is permitted to recite <i>Shema</i> until dawn <b>says</b> to himself: <b>I will go home, eat a little, drink a little, sleep a little and then I will recite</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>and recite</b> the evening prayer. In the meantime, <b>he is overcome by sleep and ends up sleeping all night. However,</b> since one is concerned lest he fall asleep and fail to wake up before midnight in order to recite <i>Shema</i> at the appropriate time, <b>he will come from the field in the evening, enter the synagogue,</b> and until it is time to pray, he will immerse himself in Torah. <b>If he is accustomed to reading the Bible, he reads. If he is accustomed to learning</b> <i>mishnayot</i>, a more advanced level of study, <b>he learns. And</b> then <b>he recites</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>and prays</b> as he should. When he arrives home, <b>he eats his meal</b> with a contented heart <b>and recites a blessing.</b>",
            "The <i>baraita</i> concludes with a warning: <b>Anyone who transgresses the pronouncements of the Sages is liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty.",
            "This is a startling conclusion. <b>What is different in all</b> other <b>places that it is not taught that one is liable</b> to receive <b>the death penalty and what is different here that it is taught that he is liable to</b> receive the <b>death penalty?</b> There is no unique stringency apparent in the rabbinic restriction on the recitation of <i>Shema</i>.",
            "The Gemara offers two answers, explaining that the conclusion of the <i>baraita</i> essentially stems not from the magnitude of the transgression, but rather from concern that the “fence” created around this particular mitzva may be neglected. <b>If you wish, say</b> that one returning from work is quite anxious to go to sleep, and due to the risk that he will be <b>overcome by sleep,</b> he must be particularly vigilant in the recitation of <i>Shema</i>. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that strong language is employed here in order <b>to exclude</b> the opinion of <b>he who says that</b> although the morning prayer and the afternoon prayer are mandatory, <b>the evening prayer is optional.</b> Therefore, <b>it teaches us</b> that the evening prayer <b>is mandatory,</b> and anyone who transgresses the pronouncement of the Sages in this regard is liable to receive the death penalty.",
            "In this <i>baraita</i>, <b>the Master said</b> that when one returns from work in the evening, he enters the synagogue, <b>recites <i>Shema</i>, and prays.</b> From this <i>baraita</i>, we see that at night, just as during the day, one first recites <i>Shema</i> and then prays. This <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Who</b> is assured <b>of</b> a place in <b>the World-to-Come? It is</b> one <b>who juxtaposes</b> the blessing of <b>redemption,</b> recited after <i>Shema</i>, <b>to the evening prayer. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: The prayers were instituted</b> to be recited <b>between</b> the two recitations of <i>Shema</i>. According to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, one recites the morning <i>Shema</i>, then recites all of the prayers and only after the recitation of the evening prayer does he recite the evening <i>Shema</i>.",
            "Although the practical difference between these two positions is clear, the Gemara seeks to determine: <b>With regard to what do they disagree?</b> What is the basis of their argument?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that they disagree over the interpretation of <b>a verse; if you wish, say</b> instead that they disagree on a point of <b>logic.</b>",
            "<b>If you say</b> that they disagree on a point of <b>logic,</b> then the argument relates to the redemption recited after <i>Shema</i>, whose focus is the exodus from Egypt, the first redemption. The question is whether that redemption began at night, which would render it appropriate to juxtapose redemption to the blessing of the evening prayers as well, in prayer for immediate redemption. Or, perhaps, the redemption from Egypt only began during the day.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan holds: Redemption occurred in the evening as well;</b> however, <b>the full-fledged redemption was only in the morning.</b> Since the redemption began in the evening, it is appropriate to juxtapose the blessing of redemption to the daily evening prayer. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi,</b> on the other hand, <b>holds: Since</b> full-fledged redemption <b>only occurred in the morning,</b> and the redemption of the previous evening <b>was not a full-fledged redemption,</b> there is no need to juxtapose the blessing of redemption to the evening prayer.",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi is not a difference over a point of logic, but over the interpretation of <b>a verse.

            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan holds:</b> The verse <b>juxtaposes lying down and rising.

And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi maintains:</b> The verse <b>juxtaposes lying down and rising</b> in a different sense. <b>Just as when one rises,</b> he recites <i>Shema</i> <b>adjacent to</b> rising from <b>his bed,</b> as the verse, when you rise, means when one awakens, <b>so too when one lies down, he recites</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>adjacent to</b> lying down in <b>his bed.</b> Therefore, the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> should be performed as close as possible to the moment when one actually lies down.",
            "According to Rabbi Yoḥanan, it is a mitzva to recite <i>Shema</i> before the evening prayer. <b>Mar, son of Ravina, raises an objection</b> from a mishna: How can one do that? We learn in a later mishna: <b>In the evening, one recites two</b> blessings <b>prior to</b> the recitation of <i>Shema</i> <b>and two</b> blessings <b>afterward. And if you say</b> that <b>one must juxtapose</b> redemption to prayer, <b>doesn’t he fail to juxtapose redemption to prayer, as he must recite: Help us lie down [<i>hashkivenu</i>],</b> the blessing recited after the blessing of redemption, which constitutes an interruption between redemption and prayer?",
            "<b>They say</b> in response: <b>Since the Sages instituted</b> the practice of reciting: <b>Help us lie down, it is considered one extended blessing of redemption,</b> and therefore does not constitute an interruption. <b>As if you fail to say</b> that the sections added by the Sages are considered no less significant than the original prayers, <b>then can one juxtapose redemption to prayer</b> even <b>in the morning? Didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: Before</b> every prayer <b>one recites</b> the verse: <b>“Lord, open my lips, that my mouth may declare Your glory”</b> (Psalms 51:17) as a prelude to prayer? <b>Afterward, one recites</b> the verse: <b>“May the words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart be acceptable before You”</b> (Psalms 19:15). Doesn’t the verse: Lord, open my lips, constitute an interruption between redemption and prayer?",
            "<b>Rather, there, since the Sages instituted</b> that one must <b>recite: Lord, open my lips, it is considered as an extended prayer</b> and not as an interruption. <b>Here, too,</b> with regard to the evening prayer, <b>since the Sages instituted to recite</b> the blessing <b>Help us lie down, it is considered as one extended</b> blessing of <b>redemption.</b>",
            "Tangential to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement that one who juxtaposes redemption and prayer is assured of a place in the World-to-Come, a similar statement is cited. <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Rabbi Avina said: Anyone who recites: “A Psalm of David”</b> (Psalms 145) <b>three times every day is assured of</b> a place in <b>the World-to-Come.</b>",
            "This statement extolling the significance of this particular chapter of Psalms, usually referred to as <i>ashrei</i> because its recitation is preceded by recitation of the verse, “Happy [<i>ashrei</i>] are those who dwell in Your House, they praise You Selah” (Psalms 84:5), raises the question: <b>What is the reason</b> that such significance is ascribed to this particular chapter?",
            "<b>If you say that it is because it is arranged alphabetically,</b> then <b>let us say: “Happy are they who are upright in the way”</b> (Psalms 119) <b>where</b> the alphabetical arrangement <b>appears eight times</b>.",

            "<b>Rather,</b> the reason why <i>tehilla leDavid</i> is accorded preference <b>is because it contains both</b> an alphabetic acrostic as well as mention of God’s provision of sustenance to all creation.",
            "Additionally, with regard to this psalm, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Why is there no</b> verse beginning with the letter <b><i>nun</i> in <i>ashrei</i>?

Since the verse from Daniel refers to Michael as “one,” which aggadic midrash interprets as “the unique one,” so, too, “one of the seraphs” described in Isaiah must also refer to the unique one, Michael.",
            "This discussion in the Gemara concludes with a <i>Tosefta</i> that arrives at a hierarchy of angels based on the number of flights required by each to arrive at his destination. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>Michael,</b> as stated above, <b>in one</b> flight; <b>Gabriel, in two</b> flights; <b>Elijah</b> the Prophet, <b>in four</b> flights; <b>and the Angel of Death, in eight</b> flights. <b>During a time of plague,</b> however, when the Angel of Death seems ubiquitous, he arrives everywhere <b>in one</b> flight.",

            "Incidental to the verse, “Tremble, and do not sin,” the Gemara mentions that <b>Rabbi Levi bar Ḥama said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: One should always incite his good inclination against his evil inclination,</b> i.e., that one must constantly struggle so that his evil inclination does not lead him to transgression, <b>as it is stated: \"Tremble, and do not sin.\"</b><br><b>If</b> one succeeds and <b>subdues</b> his evil inclination, <b>excellent,</b> but <b>if</b> he does <b>not</b> succeed in subduing it, he should <b>study Torah,</b> as alluded to in <b>the verse: “Say to your heart.”</b> <br><b>If</b> he <b>subdues</b> his evil inclination, <b>excellent; if not, he should recite <i>Shema</i>,</b> which contains the acceptance of the yoke of God, and the concept of reward and punishment, <b>as it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“Upon your bed,”</b> which alludes to <i>Shema</i>, where it says: “When you lie down.” <br><b>If</b> he <b>subdues</b> his evil inclination, <b>excellent; if not, he should remind himself of the day of death,</b> whose silence is alluded to in the continuation of <b>the verse: “And be still, Selah.”</b>",

            "The Gemara continues its treatment of the recitation of <i>Shema</i> upon one’s bed. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Anyone who recites <i>Shema</i> on his bed, it is as if he holds a double-edged sword,</b> guarding him from all evil, <b>as it is stated: “High praises of God in their mouths, and a double-edged sword in their hands”</b> (Psalms 149:6).

The word <b>good</b> means <b>nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “For I have given you a good portion, My Torah, do not abandon it”</b> (Proverbs 4:2). The verse should be understood: “I have been silent from the study of Torah, and my pain was strong.”",
            "With regard to the verse: “For I have given you a good portion,” <b>Rabbi Zeira, and some say Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa, said: Come and see how the characteristics of the Holy One, Blessed be He, are unlike the characteristics of flesh and blood.

            "Previously, the Gemara discussed suffering that results from one’s transgressions. The Gemara shifts the focus and discusses suffering that does not result from one’s transgressions and the suffering of the righteous. <b>Rava, and some say Rav Ḥisda, said: If a person sees that suffering has befallen him, he should examine his actions.</b> Generally, suffering comes about as punishment for one’s transgressions, <b>as it is stated: “We will search and examine our ways, and return to God”</b> (Lamentations 3:40). <b>If he examined</b> his ways and <b>found no</b> transgression for which that suffering is appropriate, <b>he may attribute</b> his suffering <b>to dereliction</b> in the study <b>of Torah.</b> God punishes an individual for dereliction in the study of Torah in order to emphasize the gravity of the issue, <b>as it is stated: “Happy is the man whom You punish, Lord, and teach out of Your law”</b> (Psalms 94:12). This verse teaches us that his suffering will cause him to return to Your law.",
            "<b>And if he did attribute</b> his suffering to dereliction in the study of Torah, <b>and did not find</b> this to be so, <b>he may be confident that these are afflictions of love, as it is stated: “For whom the Lord loves, He rebukes,</b> as does a father the son in whom he delights” (Proverbs 3:12).",
            "So too, <b>Rava said</b> that <b>Rav Seḥora said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said: Anyone in whom the Holy One, Blessed be He, delights, He oppresses him with suffering, as it is stated: “Yet in whom the Lord delights, He oppresses him with disease;</b> to see if his soul would offer itself in guilt, that he might see his children, lengthen his days, and that the desire of the Lord might prosper by his hand” (Isaiah 53:10). This verse illustrates that in whomever God delights, he afflicts with illness.",
            "I <b>might</b> have thought that God delights in him even <b>if he does not accept</b> his suffering <b>with love. Therefore the verse teaches: “If his soul would offer itself in guilt.” Just as a guilt-offering is brought knowingly,</b> as it is one of the sacrifices offered willingly, without coercion, <b>so too</b> his <b>suffering</b> must be accepted <b>knowingly.</b>",
            "<b>And if one accepts</b> that suffering with love, <b>what is his reward?</b> As the second part of the verse states: <b>“That he might see his children, lengthen his days.” Moreover,</b> in addition to these earthly rewards, <b>his</b> Torah <b>study will endure</b> and his Torah study will be successful, <b>as it is stated: “The purpose of the Lord,”</b> the Torah, the revelation of God’s will, <b>“might prosper by his hand.”</b>",

If</b> you are weeping <b>because</b> you lack <b>sustenance</b> and are unable to earn a livelihood, as Rabbi Elazar was, indeed, quite poor, <b>not every person merits</b> to eat off of <b>two tables,</b> one of wealth and one of Torah, so you need not bemoan the fact that you are not wealthy. <b>If</b> you are crying <b>over children</b> who have died, <b>this is the bone of my tenth son,</b> and suffering of that kind afflicts great people, and they are afflictions of love.",
            "Rabbi Elazar <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>I am</b> not <b>crying</b> over my misfortune, but rather, <b>over this beauty</b> of yours <b>that will decompose in the earth,</b> as Rabbi Yoḥanan’s beauty caused him to consider human mortality. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to him: Over this, it is certainly</b> appropriate <b>to weep.

            "<b>Meanwhile,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: Is your suffering dear to you?</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>said to him:</b> I welcome <b>neither</b> this suffering <b>nor its reward.</b> Upon hearing this, Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: Give me your hand.</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>gave him his hand, and</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>stood him up</b> and restored him to health.",
            "The Gemara relates another story regarding acknowledgement of the justice of divine punishment: <b>Four hundred barrels of Rav Huna’s wine fermented</b> and turned into vinegar, causing him great financial loss. <br><b>Rav Yehuda, the brother of Rav Sala the Pious, along with the Sages, and some say Rav Adda bar Ahava, along with the Sages, entered to visit him, and said: The Master should examine his actions,</b> as perhaps he committed a transgression for which he is being punished. <br>Rav Huna <b>said to them: Am I suspect in your eyes?</b> Have I committed a transgression on account of which you advise me to examine my behavior? <br><b>They said to him: Is the Holy One, Blessed be He, suspect that He exacts punishment without justice?</b> Your loss was certainly just, and you must examine your conduct to find out why. The Sages were aware of a flaw in Rav Huna’s conduct, to which they alluded (<i>Tosafot</i>).",
            "Rav Huna <b>said to them: If someone has heard something</b> improper that I have done, <b>let him say so.

            "Rav Huna <b>said to</b> them: <b>Does</b> this tenant farmer <b>leave me anything from</b> the produce that he grows on my property? <b>He steals it all.</b> Consequently, in denying him his share of the grapevines I am simply recouping that which was stolen from me by this tenant farmer.",

Although he did not violate a prohibition per se, it is still a form of theft, and one who is held to a higher standard than others will be punished for it. <br><b>He said to them: I accept upon myself to give</b> my tenant farmer his portion in the future. <br>Thereupon, as a result of Rav Huna’s repentance, God restored his loss. <b>Some say his vinegar turned back into wine, and some say that the price of vinegar rose and it was sold at the price of wine.</b>",
            "The Gemara returns to the topic of prayer. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the <i>tanna</i> <b>Abba Binyamin</b> would <b>say: All of my life I have taken great pains with regard to two things: That my prayer should be before my bed and that my bed should be placed north to south.</b> Abba Binyamin’s statement requires explanation. With regard to his statement: <b>That my prayer should be before my bed,</b> the Gemara asks, <b>what does before my bed</b> mean? <b>If you say</b> that it <b>literally</b> means that he would stand <b>before his bed</b> and pray, it is difficult, as <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said, and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> said: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one who prays should have nothing separating between him and the wall? As it is stated: “And Hezekiah turned to face the wall and prayed”</b> (Isaiah 38:2), in order to facilitate his concentration during prayer. That being said, why would Abba Binyamin pray before his bed? Rather, <b>do not say</b> that <b>before my bed</b> refers to where he stood during prayer, but <b>rather, say</b> that he prayed <b>adjacent to</b> the time that he would retire to <b>bed;</b> he was careful to recite <i>Shema</i> and recite the evening prayer just before going to sleep (Rabbeinu Ḥananel).",
            "Abba Binyamin’s statement: <b>And my bed should be placed north to south</b> was in deference to the Divine Presence, which rests between east and west, the direction of the Temple; as the Holy of Holies was to the west, while the main entrance was to the east. Therefore, the Sages were careful not to perform actions inconsistent with that sanctity while facing east to west; and, therefore, Abba Binyamin was careful not to sleep in a bed that faced east to west.",
            "In praise of that stringency, the Sages added that <b>Rabbi Ḥama said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: One who places his bed facing north to south will</b> be rewarded with <b>male children, as it is stated: “And whose belly You fill with Your treasure [<i>utzfunekha</i>], who have sons in plenty</b> and leave their abundance to their babies” (Psalms 17:14). This verse indicates that one who sets his bed facing north will be rewarded with sons in plenty, as north [<i>tzafon</i>] is etymologically similar to Your treasure [<i>tzfunekha</i>].",
            "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Moreover, his wife will not miscarry.</b> From where do we derive this? <b>It is written here: “And whose belly You fill [<i>temaleh</i>] with Your treasure,” and it is written there,</b> concerning Rebecca’s pregnancy: <b>“And her time to give birth was fulfilled [<i>vayimle’u</i>] and there were twins in her belly”</b> (Genesis 25:24), consequently: You fill with Your treasure refers to a pregnancy that proceeds without complication.",
            "Another of Abba Binyamin’s statements with regard to the laws of prayer <b>was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Abba Binyamin says: If two</b> people <b>enter</b> a synagogue outside of the city <b>in order to pray, and one began praying before</b> the other <b>and did not wait for the other</b> person to complete his prayer, <b>and left</b> him alone in the synagogue, <b>his prayer is thrown back in his face.</b> Because he left the other person alone and caused him to be distracted during his prayer, his own prayer is thrown back in his face, <b>as it is stated: “You who throw your soul in your face, for your sake will the earth be forsaken?</b> The Rock will be moved from its place” (Job 18:4). This verse indicates that one who left the other person alone effectively causes his soul, as prayer is the outpouring of the soul before God, to be thrown in his face. God says to that person: For your sake, do you think because you left, the earth will be forsaken, that God will leave the world and the prayer of the other person will go unheard?",
            "<b>Not only that, but it causes the Divine Presence to remove itself from Israel, as it is stated</b> in the continuation of the verse: <b>“The Rock will be moved from its place.”</b> The rock, God, is forced to remove His presence. <b>And Rock means nothing other than the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “Of the Rock that gave birth to you, you have been unmindful,</b> and you have forgotten God Who bore you” (Deuteronomy 32:18).",
            "<b>And if he waits for him</b> in the synagogue, what is his reward? Is his reward proportionate to the punishment received by one who failed to do so?"
        ],
        [
            "In terms of this reward, <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina said:</b> One who waits in the synagogue for the other to finish his prayer <b>merits the following blessings, as it is stated: “If only you had listened to My mitzvot then your peace would be as a river, and your righteousness as the waves of the sea. Your seed would be as the sand, and the offspring of your body</b> like the grains thereof; his name would be neither cut off nor destroyed from before Me” (Isaiah 48:18–19). The explanation of this passage is based on the etymological similarity between the word mitzva and the word <i>tzevet</i>, which means group. If he keeps the other person company and does not abandon him after his prayer, all of the blessings that appear later in the verse will be fulfilled in him (<i>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yona</i>).",
            "In another <i>baraita</i> <b>it was taught</b> that <b>Abba Binyamin says: If the eye was given permission to see, no creature would be able to withstand the</b> abundance and ubiquity of the <b>demons</b> and continue to live unaffected by them.",
            "Similarly, <b>Abaye said: They are more numerous than we</b> are <b>and they stand over us like mounds of earth surrounding a pit.</b>",

            "Summarizing the effects of the demons, <b>Rava said:</b> <br><b>The crowding at the <i>kalla</i>,</b> the gatherings for Torah study during Elul and Adar, <b>is from</b> the demons;<br><b>those knees that are fatigued</b> even though one did not exert himself <b>is from</b> the demons; <br><b>those clothes of the Sages that wear out,</b> despite the fact that they do not engage in physical labor, <b>is from friction</b> with the demons; <br><b>those feet that are in pain is from</b> the demons.",
            "<b>One who seeks to know</b> that the demons exist <b>should place fine ashes around his bed, and in the morning</b> the demons’ footprints <b>appear like chickens’ footprints,</b> in the ash. <b>One who seeks to see them should take the afterbirth of a firstborn female black cat, born to a firstborn female black cat, burn it in the fire, grind it and place it in his eyes, and he will see them.</b> He must then <b>place</b> the ashes <b>in an iron tube sealed with an iron seal [<i>gushpanka</i>] lest the demons steal it from him, and</b> then <b>seal the opening</b> so <b>he will not be harmed.

            "<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Abba Binyamin said: One’s prayer is only</b> fully <b>heard in a synagogue, as it is stated</b> with regard to King Solomon’s prayer in the Temple: “Yet have You turned toward the prayer of Your servant and to his supplication, Lord my God, <b>to listen to the song and the prayer</b> which Your servant prays before You on this day” (I Kings 8:28). The following verse concludes: “To hear the prayer Your servant directs toward this place” (I Kings 8:29). We see that one’s prayer is heard specifically in the Temple, of which the synagogue is a microcosm (Rav Yoshiyahu Pinto). It may be inferred that <b>in a place of song,</b> a synagogue where God’s praises are sung, <b>there prayer should be.</b>",
            "In explaining Abba Binyamin’s statement, <b>Ravin bar Rav Adda said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the Holy One, Blessed be He, is located in a synagogue?

            "The Gemara asks: <b>Since</b> the Divine Presence rests <b>even</b> upon <b>one</b> who engages in Torah study, <b>was it necessary</b> to say that the Divine Presence rests upon <b>two</b> who study Torah together?

            "Rav Huna already explained the beginning of the verse, “The wicked walk round about.” The Gemara explains the end of the verse: “When vileness is exalted among the sons of men.” <b>One of the Sages said to Rav Beivai bar Abaye, and some say Rav Beivai</b> said to <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak: What is</b> the meaning of: <b>“When vileness is exalted among the sons of men”?</b>",

            "In passing, the Gemara explains why it was necessary for Elijah to repeat, “answer me, Lord, answer me”: The first <b>answer me</b> was the request <b>that fire descend from the heavens, while</b> the second <b>answer me</b> was the request <b>that</b> Israel should accept complete faith in God and <b>not say that</b> the fire descending from the heavens <b>was an act of sorcery.</b>",

            "<b>What is his reward if he causes</b> the groom <b>to rejoice? <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> He is privileged</b> to acquire <b>the Torah, which was given with five voices, as it is stated: “And it was on the third day, when it was morning, there were sounds [<i>kolot</i>], and lightning and a thick cloud upon the mountain, and the voice of the <i>shofar</i>”</b> (Exodus 19:16). The plural <i>kolot</i> indicates at least two sounds, while “the voice of the shofar” is one more. The passage continues: <b>“And when the voice of the <i>shofar</i></b> grew louder and louder, Moses spoke <b>and God answered him by a voice”</b> (Exodus 19:19).

            "Esau was not only angry over Isaac’s blessing, but he was angry about another matter as well, <b>as it is written: “And he said, ‘Is he not rightly named Jacob, for he has supplanted me twice?</b> He took my birthright, and behold, now he has taken my blessing’” (Genesis 27:36). Despite having sold his birthright, he refused to relinquish it.",
            "<b>While my son,</b> Reuben, <b>even though Joseph took his birthright from him by force, as it is written:</b> “And the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, for he was the firstborn; <b>but, since he defiled his father’s bed, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph,</b> son of Israel” (I Chronicles 5:1). <b>Nevertheless, he was not jealous of him, as it is written</b> when Joseph’s brothers sought to kill him: <b>“And Reuben heard and he saved him from their hands,</b> saying ‘Let us not take his life’” (Genesis 37:21).",
            "Continuing on the topic of names, the Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the name <b>Ruth? Rabbi Yoḥanan said: That she had the privilege that David, who inundated the Holy One, Blessed be He, with songs and praises, would descend from her.</b> The name Ruth [<i>Rut</i>] is etymologically similar in Hebrew to the word inundate [<i>riva</i>].",
            "Regarding the basic assumption that these homiletic interpretations of names are allusions to one’s future, the Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that the name affects</b> one’s life? <b>Rabbi Eliezer said</b> that <b>the verse says: “Go, see the works of the Lord, who has made desolations [<i>shamot</i>] upon the earth”</b> (Psalms 46:9). <b>Do not read</b> the word as <b><i>shamot</i>, rather</b> as <b><i>shemot</i>, names.</b> The names given to people are, therefore, “the works of the Lord upon the earth.”",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> other aggadic statements <b>in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai:</b> The existence of <b>wayward</b> children <b>in a person’s home is more troublesome than the war of Gog and Magog,</b> the ultimate war, the climax of the travails of Messianic times. <b>As it is stated: “A Psalm of David, when he fled from his son, Absalom”</b> (Psalms 3:1). <b>And it is written thereafter: “Lord, how numerous are my enemies, many have risen against me”</b> (Psalms 3:2). <b>While concerning the war of Gog and Magog,</b> which is alluded to in the second chapter of Psalms, <b>it is written: “Why are the nations in an uproar? And why do the peoples speak for naught?</b> The kings of the earth stand up and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against His anointed…He that sits in heaven laughs, the Lord mocks them” (Psalms 2:1–4). <b>Yet</b> in this chapter describing the war of Gog and Magog <b>“how numerous are my enemies” is not written,</b> as it is not as difficult as raising a wayward son like Absalom.",
            "Regarding the opening phrase of the psalm, which serves as its title, the Gemara wonders: It is said: <b>“A Psalm of David, when fleeing his son, Absalom.” A Psalm of David? It should have</b> said: <b>A lament of David.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Avishalom said a parable: To what is this similar?</b> It is similar <b>to a person about whom a promissory note was issued</b> stating that he must repay a debt to the lender. <b>Before he repaid it,</b> he <b>was despondent,</b> worried how he will manage to repay the debt. <b>After he repaid it, he was glad.</b>",
            "<b>So too</b> was the case with <b>David. When the Holy One, Blessed be He, told him,</b> through Natan the prophet, after the incident with Bathsheba, <b>“Behold, I will raise up evil against you from your house”</b> (II Samuel 12:11), David <b>was despondent. He said: Perhaps</b> it will be <b>a slave or a <i>mamzer</i></b> who will rise up in my house, a person of such lowly status, who <b>will have no pity on me. But once</b> David <b>saw that Absalom was the one</b> through whom the prophecy was to be fulfilled, <b>he rejoiced,</b> as he was certain that Absalom would show him mercy. <b>That is why</b> David <b>said a psalm,</b> not a lament, thanking God for punishing him in the least severe manner possible.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: One is permitted to provoke the wicked in this world.</b> Though the ways of the wicked prosper, one is still permitted to provoke them and need not fear (Maharsha), <b>as it is stated: “Those who abandon the Torah will praise wickedness, and the keepers of the Torah will fight them”</b> (Proverbs 28:4).",
            "<b>That</b> statement <b>was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita,</i> as <b>Rabbi Dostai, son of Rabbi Matun, says: One is permitted to provoke the wicked in this world, as it is stated: “Those who abandon the Torah will praise wickedness,</b> and the keepers of the Torah will fight them.” <b>And if someone whispered to you, saying,</b> on the contrary, <b>isn’t it</b> also <b>written: “Do not compete with evil-doers, and do not envy the unjust”</b> (Psalms 37:1), meaning that one should avoid provoking the wicked, <b>say to him:</b> Only <b>one whose heart strikes him</b> with pangs of conscience over sins that he committed <b>says this. Rather,</b> the true meaning of the verse is: <b>Do not compete with evil-doers, to be like the evil-doers, and do not envy the unjust to be like the unjust.</b>",
            "The Gemara cites proof from another verse. <b>And it says: “One shall not envy the unjust, but be in fear of the Lord all the day”</b> (Proverbs 23:17). In this context, to envy means to seek to emulate the unjust.",
            "From these verses in Psalms and Proverbs, it would seem that one is encouraged to provoke the wicked. The Gemara asks: <b>Is this so? Didn’t Rabbi Yitzḥak say: If you see a wicked person upon whom the hour is smiling, do not provoke him.</b> As long as he is enjoying good fortune, there is no point in confronting him. <b>As it is stated: “His ways prosper at all times;</b> Your judgments are far beyond him; as for his adversaries, he snorts at them” (Psalms 10:5). The verse teaches us that the ways of the wicked will always succeed. <b>And not only that, but he emerges victorious in judgment, as it is stated: “Your judgments are far beyond him,”</b> meaning that even when he is brought to justice, it does not affect him. <b>And not only that, but he witnesses his enemies’</b> downfall, <b>as it is stated: “As for all his adversaries, he snorts at them.”</b>",
            "To resolve this contradiction with regard to whether or not one may provoke the wicked, the Gemara offers several explanations: <b>This is not difficult,</b> as it can be understood that <b>this,</b> which says that one may not provoke the wicked, is referring <b>to his</b> personal <b>matters, while that,</b> which says that it is a mitzva to confront them, is referring <b>to matters of Heaven.</b>",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead <b>that this,</b> which says not to confront the wicked <b>and that,</b> which says to confront the wicked, are both referring <b>to matters of Heaven, and,</b> nevertheless, <b>it is not difficult. This,</b> which says that one may not provoke the wicked, is referring <b>to a wicked person upon whom the hour is smiling,</b> who is enjoying good fortune. <b>While that,</b> which says that it is a mitzva to confront them, is referring <b>to a wicked person upon whom the hour is not smiling.</b>",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead <b>that this,</b> which says not to confront <b>and that,</b> which says to confront, are both referring <b>to a wicked person upon whom the hour is smiling,</b> but the question of whether one is permitted to confront him depends on who is confronting him. <b>And</b> nevertheless, this is <b>not difficult. This,</b> which says that it is a mitzva to confront them, is referring <b>to a completely righteous person, while this,</b> which says that one may not confront the wicked, is referring <b>to one who is not completely righteous, as Rav Huna said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “Why do You look on those who deal treacherously and hold Your peace? When the wicked swallows the man more righteous than he?”</b> (Habakkuk 1:13). This verse is difficult to understand. <b>Do the wicked swallow the righteous? Isn’t it written:</b> “The wicked looks to the righteous and seeks to kill him; <b>the Lord will not leave him in his hand,</b> nor allow him to be condemned when he is judged” (Psalms 37:32–33), <b>and it is written: “No mischief shall befall the righteous”</b> (Proverbs 12:21)? <b>Rather,</b> in light of these verses, the verse: “The wicked swallows the man more righteous than he” means: <b>The</b> man who is <b>more righteous than he,</b> but not completely righteous, <b>he swallows. The completely righteous he does not swallow.</b>",
            "<b>And if you wish, say:</b> In general, the wicked cannot swallow the righteous, but <b>when the hour is smiling upon him, it is different.</b> When the wicked are enjoying good fortune, even the righteous can be harmed (<i>Birkat Hashem</i>).",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai:</b> Setting a fixed place for prayer is so important that <b>one who sets a fixed place for his prayer, his enemies fall beneath him, as it is said: “And I will appoint a place for My nation, Israel, and I will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place.”</b> Through setting aside a place for prayer, they will merit to <b>“be disturbed no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them anymore, as in the beginning”</b> (II Samuel 7:10).",
            "This verse, cited by the Gemara, leads to an additional point. <b>Rav Huna raised a contradiction:</b> In the book of Samuel, in this verse it is written<b>: “To afflict them,”</b> while in the parallel verse in I Chronicles (17:9) it is written<b>: “To destroy them.”</b>",
            "The Gemara resolves this contradiction: The enemies of Israel intend first <b>to afflict them, and, ultimately,</b> to <b>destroy them</b> entirely.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: Service of Torah is greater than its study,</b> i.e., serving a Torah scholar and spending time in his company is greater than learning Torah from him. Torah study is one component of a Torah life, but one who serves a Torah scholar learns about every aspect of life from his actions. This is derived from the verse that speaks in praise of Elisha, <b>as it is stated: “Here is Elisha son of Shafat, who poured water over Elijah’s hands”</b> (II Kings 3:11). The verse <b>does not say</b> that <b>he learned</b> from Elijah, <b>rather</b> that <b>he poured</b> water, which <b>teaches</b> that <b>the service of Torah</b> represented by Elisha pouring water over Elijah’s hands <b>is greater than its study.</b>",
            "As a prelude to another of the statements by Rabbi Yoḥanan in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai, the Gemara relates the following incident. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said to Rav Naḥman: Why did the Master not come to the synagogue to pray?</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: I was</b> weak and <b>unable</b> to come. Rabbi Yitzḥak <b>said to him: Let the Master gather ten</b> individuals, a prayer quorum, at your home <b>and pray.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: It is difficult for me</b> to impose upon the members of the community to come to my home to pray with me (<i>Sefer Mitzvot Gadol</i>). Rabbi Yitzḥak suggested another option: <b>The Master should tell the congregation</b> to send a <b>messenger when the congregation is praying to come and inform the Master</b> so you may pray at the same time.",
            "Rav Naḥman saw that Rabbi Yitzḥak was struggling to find a way for him to engage in communal prayer. <b>He asked: What is</b> the reason for <b>all this</b> fuss? Rabbi Yitzḥak <b>said to him: As Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai:</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “But as for me, let my prayer be unto You, Lord, in a time of favor;</b> O God, in the abundance of Your mercy, answer me with the truth of Your salvation” (Psalms 69:14)? It appears that the individual is praying that his prayers will coincide with a special time of Divine favor. <b>When is a time of favor?</b> It is <b>at the time when the congregation is praying.</b> It is beneficial to pray together with the congregation, for God does not fail to respond to the entreaties of the congregation.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said that</b> the unique quality of communal prayer is derived <b>from here: “Thus said the Lord, in a time of acceptance I have answered you and on a day of salvation I have aided you”</b> (Isaiah 49:8).",
            "<b>Rabbi Aḥa, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said</b> that it is derived <b>from here: “Behold, God is mighty, He despises no one”</b> (Job 36:5). He adopts an alternative reading of the verse: “Behold, God will not despise” the prayer of “the mighty,” i.e., the community. <b>And it is written: “He has redeemed my soul in peace so that none came upon me; for there were many with me.</b> God shall hear and answer them…” (Psalms 55:19–20). This verse teaches that the prayer was answered because there were many with me when it was offered.",
            "<b>That</b> last proof <b>was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Natan says: From where do we know that the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not despise the prayer of the masses? As it is stated: “Behold, God does not despise the mighty,” and it is written: “He has redeemed my soul in peace so that none came upon me;</b> for there were many with me.” Rabbi Natan interprets this not as David speaking about himself, but as God speaking to Israel. <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, says: Anyone who engages in Torah</b> study, which is called peace in the verse: “All its ways are peace” (Proverbs 3:17); <b>and in acts of kindness, and prays with the congregation, I ascribe to him</b> credit <b>as if he redeemed Me and My children from among the nations of the world.</b>",
            "Continuing to extol communal prayer, <b>Reish Lakish said: One who has a synagogue</b> nearby <b>in his city but does not enter to pray there is called an evil neighbor, as it is stated: “Thus said the Lord: As for all My evil neighbors who touch My inheritance which I have caused My people Israel to inherit,</b> behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck the house of Judah up from among them” (Jeremiah 12:14). One who only touches, but does not enter the place of prayer, My inheritance, is considered an evil neighbor. <b>And furthermore,</b> he is punished in that <b>he causes himself and his children</b> to go into <b>exile, as it is stated: “Behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck the house of Judah up from among them.”</b>",
            "The Gemara relates that when the Sages <b>told Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> that <b>there are elders in Babylonia, he was confounded and said: It is written: “So that your days will be lengthened and the days of your children upon the land</b> the Lord swore to your forefathers to give to them like the days of heaven on the earth” (Deuteronomy 11:21); lengthened in Eretz Yisrael <b>but not outside of the Land.</b> Why then, do the residents of Babylonia live long lives? <b>When they told him</b> that the people in Babylonia <b>go early</b> in the morning <b>and go late</b> in the evening <b>to the synagogue, he said: That is what was effective for them</b> in extending their lives.",
            "<b>As Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said to his sons: Go early and go late and enter the synagogue, so that your lives will be extended.</b> And <b>Rabbi Aḥa, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said:</b> Upon <b>what verse</b> is this based?

            "Based on this verse, <b>Rav Ḥisda said: A person should always enter two doorways into the synagogue.</b> This statement is unclear. Immediately, the Gemara asks: <b>Does it enter your mind</b> that Rav Ḥisda meant that one should enter <b>two doorways</b> literally? What if a synagogue only has a single doorway? Rather, emend his statement and <b>say</b> that Rav Ḥisda meant that <b>one should enter a distance of two doorways</b> into the synagogue <b>and then pray.</b> In entering a distance of two doorways, one fulfills the verse: Guarding at My door posts, in the plural.",
            "Having mentioned the verse, “For whoso finds Me finds life,” the Gemara seeks to clarify its meaning. It is said, <b>“For this, let every pious man pray to You in the time of finding,</b> that the overflowing waters may not reach him” (Psalms 32:6). With regard to the phrase, the time of finding, <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: The time of finding</b> refers to the time one must find <b>a wife,</b> that one should pray to find a suitable woman to marry. <b>As it is said: “He who finds [<i>matza</i>] a wife finds [<i>matza</i>] good</b> and obtains favor from the Lord” (Proverbs 18:22).",
            "<b>In Eretz Yisrael,</b> the custom was that <b>when a man married a woman, they would ask him: <i>Matza</i> or <i>motzeh</i>?</b> In other words, they would ask the groom whether the appropriate passage for his wife is the above verse from Proverbs that begins with the word <b><i>matza</i>, as it is written: “He who finds a wife finds good and obtains favor from the Lord”</b> or whether the more appropriate verse is the one beginning with the word <b><i>motzeh</i>, as it is written: “And I find [<i>motzeh</i>] the woman more bitter than death”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:26).",
            "<b>Rabbi Natan says: The time of finding</b> refers to the time of finding <b>Torah, as it is stated</b> in a verse referring to Torah: <b>“He who finds Me finds life.”</b> The Torah is the object most sought.",
            "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: The time of finding</b> refers to <b>death.</b> One should pray that when death comes, he will leave the world peacefully, <b>as it is stated: “Issues [<i>totzaot</i>] of death”</b> (Psalms 68:21). Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak’s statement is based on the etymological similarity between <i>totzaot</i> and <i>matza</i>, finding.",
            "<b>It was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Nine hundred and three types of death were created in the world, as it is stated: “Issues [<i>totzaot</i>] of death,” and that,</b> 903, <b>is the numerical value [<i>gimatriya</i>] of <i>totzaot</i></b>. The Gemara explains that <b>the most difficult of</b> all these types of death <b>is croup [<i>askara</i>],</b> while <b>the easiest is</b> the <b>kiss</b> of death. <b>Croup is like a thorn</b> entangled <b>in a wool fleece, which, when pulled out backwards,</b> tears the wool. <b>Some say that</b> croup <b>is like ropes at the entrance to the esophagus,</b> which would be nearly impossible to insert and excruciating to remove. The <b>kiss</b> of death <b>is like drawing a hair from milk.</b> One should pray that he does not die a painful death.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The time of finding</b> refers to a respectful <b>burial,</b> for which one should pray. Supporting Rabbi Yoḥanan’s interpretation, <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: What</b> is the <b>verse</b> that teaches that the time of finding refers to burial? <b>“Who rejoice in exultation and are glad when they can find a grave”</b> (Job 3:22), as there are situations in which one is relieved when his body finds a grave in which to rest. <b>Rabba bar Rav Sheila said, that is the</b> meaning of the <b>folk saying: A person should even pray for mercy until the final shovelful</b> of dirt <b>is thrown</b> upon his grave.",
            "<b>Mar Zutra said: The time of finding</b> refers to finding <b>a lavatory.</b> As most places did not have a sewage system, one was forced to relieve himself outside the city. Because of this unpleasantness, finding a suitable location was called by Mar Zutra, the time of finding. <b>In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they say: This</b> explanation <b>of Mar Zutra is preferable to all of them,</b> as the term <i>motza</i> is explicitly associated in the Bible (see II Kings 10:27) with the lavatory (Rabbi Abraham Moshe Horovitz).",
            "Returning to the tractate’s central topic, <b>Rava said to Rafram bar Pappa: Let the Master say to us some of those outstanding statements that you said in the name of Rav Ḥisda with regard to matters of the synagogue.</b>",
            "Rafram <b>said to him, Rav Ḥisda said as follows: What is</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“The Lord loves the gates of Zion [<i>Tziyyon</i>] more than all the dwellings of Jacob”</b> (Psalms 87:2)? This means that <b>the Lord loves the gates distinguished [<i>metzuyanim</i>] through</b> the study of <i>halakha</i> as they are the gates of Zion, the outstanding gates, <b>more than the synagogues and study halls.</b> Although those places are the most outstanding of the dwellings of Jacob, they are not engaged in the study of <i>halakha</i>.",
            "<b>And this</b> concept, that <i>halakha</i> is the most sublime pursuit, is expressed in that which <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ami said in the name of Ulla: Since the day the Temple,</b> where the Divine Presence rested in this world, <b>was destroyed, the Holy One, Blessed be He, has only</b> one place <b>in His world</b> where he reveals His presence exclusively; <b>only the four cubits</b> where the study <b>of <i>halakha</i></b> is undertaken<b>.</b>",
            "This statement has practical ramifications. <b>Abaye said: At first I studied in the house and prayed in the synagogue. Once I heard what Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ami said in the name of Ulla: Since the day the Temple was destroyed, the Holy One, Blessed be He, has only</b> one place <b>in His world, only the four cubits of <i>halakha</i> alone,</b> from which I understood the significance of the four cubits of <i>halakha</i>, and <b>I pray only where I study.</b>",
            "Similarly, the Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi, despite</b> the fact <b>that they had thirteen synagogues in Tiberias, they would only pray between the pillars where they studied.</b>",
            "<b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ami said in the name of Ulla: One who benefits from his hard labor is greater than a God-fearing</b> person, i.e., one who is so enthralled by his fear of God that he sits idly by and does not work. <b>As with regard to a God-fearing</b> person, <b>it is written: “Happy is the man who fears the Lord,</b> who greatly desires His mitzvot” (Psalms 112:1), <b>while with regard to one who benefits from his hard work, it is written: “By the labor of your hands you will live; you are happy and it is good for you”</b> (Psalms 128:2). The Gemara explains this verse to mean that <b>you are happy in this world, and it is good for you in the World-to-Come. And regarding a God-fearing</b> person, happy is the man, is written about him but <b>and it is good for you, is not written about him.</b>",
            "<b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ami said in the name of Ulla: One should always live in the place where his teacher</b> lives; thereby he will avoid sin. <b>For as long as Shimi ben Gera,</b> who according to tradition was a great Torah scholar and teacher of Solomon (see <i>Gittin</i> 59a), <b>was alive, Solomon did not marry Pharaoh’s daughter.</b> Immediately after the Bible relates the death of Shimi (I Kings, end of ch. 2), Solomon’s marriage to Pharaoh’s daughter is recorded (beginning of ch. 3).",

            "The Gemara answers: <b>This is not difficult. This,</b> which says that one should live where his teacher lives, is referring to a case <b>where he is acquiescent to</b> his teacher and will heed his teaching and instruction. <b>While this</b> <i>baraita</i>, which says that one should not live where his teacher lives, is referring to a case <b>where he is not acquiescent to him</b> and that will lead them to quarrel.",
            "The Gemara again returns to the topic of the synagogue. <b>Rav Huna bar Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rabbi Menaḥem said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ami said: What is</b> the practical halakhic meaning of <b>that which is written: “They who forsake the Lord will perish”</b> (Isaiah 1:28)? <b>This</b> verse <b>refers to one who abandons the Torah</b> scroll when it was taken out to be read <b>and leaves</b> the synagogue, as it appears that he is fleeing from God.",

            "<b>And</b> Rava also advised: <b>Do not sit on the bed of an Aramean woman, and do not pass by a synagogue when the community is praying.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Some say: Do not sit on the bed of an Aramean woman</b> means <b>one should not go to sleep without reciting <i>Shema,</i></b> as by doing so, it is tantamount to sleeping in the bed of a non-Jew, as his conduct is unbecoming a Jew. <b>Others say:</b> This means that <b>one should not marry a woman who converted,</b> and it is better to marry a woman who was born Jewish. <b>And some say:</b> It <b>literally</b> means that one should not sit on the bed of <b>an Aramean,</b> i.e., a non-Jewish <b>woman.</b>",

            "The Gemara explains that <b>this is what Rabban Gamliel said to his sons: Even according to the Rabbis, who say</b> that the mitzva may be performed only <b>until midnight,</b> the biblical obligation to perform <b>the mitzva</b> continues <b>until dawn, and that which they say</b> that it may only be recited <b>until midnight</b> is <b>in order to distance a person from transgression.</b>",

            "The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> to this conclusion based on a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The mitzvot of the recitation of the evening <i>Shema,</i></b> the recitation of <b><i>hallel</i> on the nights of Passover</b> accompanying the sacrifice of the Paschal lamb, <b>as well as eating the Paschal lamb,</b> may all be performed <b>until dawn.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Yosef said: This is not difficult</b> as these two sources reflect two conflicting opinions. <b>This,</b> our mishna, <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya. While this,</b> the <i>baraita</i>, <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse discussing the mitzva to eat the Paschal lamb: <b>“And they shall eat of the meat on that night;</b> roasted over fire and <i>matzot</i> with bitter herbs shall they eat it” (Exodus 12:8); <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says: Here it is stated: “On that night,”</b> from which we cannot determine when night ends. The same expression is encountered later in the same chapter: <b>“And I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night</b> and I will strike every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from person to animal” (Exodus 12:12). We know when the firstborns were struck down based on the verse “Thus said the Lord: At about midnight, I will go out into the midst of Egypt and every firstborn in Egypt shall die” (Exodus 11:4–5). Therefore, <b>just as</b> in the verse <b>below,</b> the striking of the firstborns took place <b>until midnight,</b> as stated explicitly in the verse, <b>so too</b> in the verse <b>here,</b> the mitzva to eat the Paschal lamb continues <b>until midnight.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Akiva said to him: Was it not already said,</b> “Thus you shall eat it, with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, your staffs in your hands and you will eat it <b>in haste</b> for it is the Paschal offering for the Lord” (Exodus 12:11)? Therefore the Paschal lamb may be eaten <b>until the time of haste.</b> Since the time of haste is when Israel left Egypt, and it is said, “You will not leave, every man from his house, until the morning,” then the Paschal lamb may be eaten until dawn. <b>If that is so, why does the verse state: On</b> that <b>night?</b>",
            "The Gemara explains that the phrase on that night is necessary because without it I <b>might</b> have thought that the Paschal lamb <b>is eaten during the day, like</b> all other <b>sacrifices,</b> which must all be slaughtered and eaten during the day. Therefore, <b>the verse states: On</b> that <b>night,</b> to underscore that this particular sacrifice <b>is eaten at night and not during the day.</b> <br>Essentially, the difference between these two opinions revolves around which word they deemed significant. Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya considered the word night as the key word, while Rabbi Akiva considered the word haste as the key word. The Gemara begins to analyze their statements.",
            "<b>Granted, according to Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, who has</b> the tradition of <b>a verbal analogy</b> between the phrase, on that night, with regard to the eating of the Paschal lamb and the phrase, on that night, with regard to the striking of the firstborn in Egypt, <b>it was necessary</b> for the verse <b>to write “that”</b> in order to indicate that these times are parallel. <b>However, according to Rabbi Akiva,</b> who has no such tradition, <b>what does he do with “that”?</b> Why is it necessary to emphasize on that night?",
            "The Gemara answers: On that night <b>comes to exclude another night,</b> as one might otherwise have concluded that the Paschal lamb may be eaten for two nights. <b>It would have entered your mind to say: Since the Paschal lamb</b> falls into the category of <b>sacrifices of lesser sanctity, and peace-offerings are</b> also <b>sacrifices of lesser sanctity, just as peace-offerings may be eaten for two days and one night,</b> i.e., the day that they are sacrificed through the following day, as we learned in the Torah, <b>so too the Paschal lamb may be eaten for two nights instead of two days.</b> In other words, one might otherwise mistakenly conclude from its parallel to peace-offerings, that the Paschal lamb <b>is to be eaten for two nights and the day</b> between them. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> specifically <b>on that night,</b> i.e., <b>on that night it is eaten, and it is not eaten on another night.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: If so, from where does <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya</b> derive that the Paschal lamb cannot be eaten for two nights?",
            "The Gemara answers: Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya <b>derives</b> this conclusion <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“It should not remain until the morning”</b> (Exodus 12:10). If one is prohibited from leaving over any part of the sacrifice until the morning, he is certainly prohibited from leaving it over until the following night. Therefore, it is unnecessary to cite an additional source to teach that the Paschal lamb may only be eaten on the first night.",

According to Rabbi Akiva, <b>if</b> it was derived <b>from</b> the verse: “It should not remain until the morning,” <b>I would have said: What</b> is the meaning of <b>morning?</b> It means the <b>second morning,</b> as the Torah does not specify until which morning the Paschal lamb may not be left; until the first morning or the second morning. Therefore, the Torah needed to write on that night and no other.",
            "<b>And</b> what would <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> ben Azarya respond?

            "Concerning the tannaitic dispute between Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya regarding until when the Paschal lamb may be eaten, the Gemara remarks: The dispute between <b>these <i>tanna’im</i> is parallel to</b> the dispute between <b>those <i>tanna’im</i>,</b> who disagree over the same issue. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“There you will offer the Paschal lamb, in the evening when the sun sets at the time when you left the land of Egypt”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:6). Upon closer examination, it seems that this verse mentions three distinct times: In the evening, refers to the afternoon until sunset; when the sun sets, refers to the time of sunset itself; and the time when you left the land of Egypt refers to, as explained in Exodus, the early hours of the morning. Therefore it seems that these times parallel the different stages of the mitzva of the Paschal lamb, and it is regarding these details that the <i>tanna’im</i> disagree.",

            "The Gemara cites an alternative explanation of the dispute between Rabbi Elazer ben Azarya and Rabbi Akiva. <b>Rabbi Abba said: Everyone agrees that when</b> the children of <b>Israel were redeemed from Egypt</b> were given permission to leave, <b>they were redeemed only in the evening, as it is stated:</b> “In the spring <b>the Lord, your God, took you out from Egypt at night”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:1). <b>And when they</b> actually <b>left, they left only during the day, as it is stated:</b> “On the fifteenth of the first month, <b>on the day after the</b> offering of the <b>Paschal lamb, the children of Israel went out with a high hand</b> before the eyes of Egypt” (Numbers 33:3), indicating that they actually went out during the day.",
            "However, <b>with regard to what did they disagree?</b> They disagreed <b>with regard to the time of haste,</b> as it is written: “You will eat it in haste for it is the Paschal offering for the Lord” (Exodus 12:11). <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya held: What is</b> the meaning of <b>haste?</b> It is <b>the haste of the Egyptians</b> at midnight, as they hurried to the houses of the people of Israel to send them away, in fear of the plague of the firstborn.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Akiva held: What is</b> the meaning of <b>haste?</b> It is <b>the haste of Israel</b> in the morning, as they rushed to leave Egypt.",

            "In explaining passages from Psalms, the Gemara relates another instance of a response to the question of a heretic: <b>A certain heretic said to Rabbi Abbahu, it is written: “A Psalm of David, when he fled from his son, Absalom”</b> (Psalms 3:1), <b>and</b> similarly <b>it is said:</b> “To the chief musician, <i>al tashḥet</i>, <b>a <i>mikhtam</i> of David when fleeing from Saul into the cave”</b> (Psalms 57:1). <b>Which event was first?

            "Regarding the juxtaposition of verses, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From where</b> in the Bible is it derived that one may draw homiletical inferences from the <b>juxtaposition</b> of verses? <b>As it is said:</b> “The works of His hands in truth and justice, all His commandments are sure. <b>Adjoined forever and ever, made in truth and uprightness”</b> (Psalms 111:7–8). Conclude from here that it is appropriate to draw inferences from the juxtaposition of God’s commandments. Accordingly, David’s fleeing from Absalom is situated where it is in order to juxtapose it to the next chapter, which mentions the war of Gog and Magog; the second chapter of Psalms opens: “Why are the nations in an uproar?”",
            "<b>Why was the chapter of Absalom juxtaposed with the chapter of Gog and Magog?</b> They are juxtaposed <b>so</b> that <b>if a person should say to you,</b> expressing doubt with regard to the prophecy of the war of Gog and Magog “against the Lord and against His anointed”: <b>Is there a slave who rebels against his master?</b> Is there someone capable of rebelling against God? <b>You too say to him: Is there a son who rebels against his father</b> and severs the relationship with the one who brought him into the world and raised him? <b>Yet,</b> nevertheless, <b>there was</b> such a son, Absalom, and <b>so too there</b> can <b>be</b> a situation where people will seek to rebel against God.",

            "The Gemara asks: To <b>what</b> specific action was he referring when he said: <b>“And what was good in your sight I did”?</b> Various opinions are offered: Mentioning Hezekiah’s merits, <b>Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav that he juxtaposed redemption and prayer</b> at sunrise instead of sleeping late, as was the custom of most kings (<i>Iyyun Ya’akov</i>). <b>Rabbi Levi said: He suppressed the Book of Remedies</b> upon which everyone relied.",
            "<b>The Sages taught: King Hezekiah performed six</b> innovative <b>actions. With regard to three</b> the Sages <b>agreed with him, and with regard to three they did not agree with him.</b>",
            "<b>With regard to three</b> actions the Sages <b>agreed with him:</b> <br><b>He suppressed the Book of Remedies, and they agreed with him.</b> <br><b>He ground the copper snake</b> through which miracles were performed for Israel (Numbers 21:9), destroying it because it had been used in idol worship (II Kings 18:4), <b>and they agreed with him.</b> <br><b>He dragged the bones of his</b> evil <b>father,</b> King Ahaz, <b>on a bed of ropes;</b> meaning he did not accord his father a funeral fit for a king (II Chronicles 28:27), <b>and they agreed with him.</b>",
            "Yet, <b>with regard to three</b> other innovations, the Sages of his generation <b>did not agree with him:</b> <br><b>He stopped up the waters of the Gihon,</b> the Pool of Siloam, diverting its water into the city by means of a tunnel (II Chronicles 32:30), <b>and they did not agree with him.</b> <br><b>He cut off the doors of the Sanctuary and sent them to the king of Assyria</b> (II Kings 18:16), <b>and they did not agree with him.</b> <br><b>He intercalated Nisan in Nisan,</b> creating a leap year by adding an extra month during the month of Nisan. That intercalation must be performed before the end of Adar (II Chronicles 30:2).",
            "With regard to his intercalation of Nisan, the Gemara asks: <b>Did Hezekiah not</b> accept the <i>halakha</i>: <b>“This month will be for you the first of the months;</b> it shall be the first for you of the months of the year” (Exodus 12:2)? By inference, <b>this</b> first month <b>is Nisan, and no other</b> month <b>is Nisan.</b> How could Hezekiah add an additional Nisan in violation of Torah law?",
            "The Gemara answers that the scenario was different. <b>Rather, Hezekiah erred with regard to</b> the halakhic opinion ascribed in later generations to <b>Shmuel,</b> as <b>Shmuel said: One may not intercalate the year on the thirtieth day of Adar, since it is fit to establish it</b> as the New Moon of <b>Nisan.</b> On the thirtieth day of each month, those who witnessed the new moon would come and testify before the court, which, based on their testimony, would declare that day the first day of the next month. Therefore, one may not declare a leap year on the thirtieth day of Adar, as it could potentially become the first of Nisan. Therefore, the Sages of Hezekiah’s generation did not agree with his decision to intercalate the year on the thirtieth of Adar. Hezekiah <b>held</b> that <b>we do not say: Since</b> that day <b>is fit to establish it</b> as the New Moon is reason enough to refrain from intercalation of the year.",
            "Stemming from the analysis of Hezekiah’s prayer, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Yosei ben Zimra: Anyone who bases</b> his prayer or request <b>upon his own merit,</b> when God answers his prayer, <b>it is based upon the merit of others. And anyone who</b> modestly <b>bases</b> his prayer or request <b>upon the merit of others,</b> when God answers his prayer, <b>it is based upon his own merit.</b>",
            "The Gemara cites proof from Moses. When he prayed to God for forgiveness after the incident of the Golden Calf, <b>he based</b> his request <b>upon the merit of others, as it is stated: “Remember Abraham, Isaac and Israel your servants,</b> to whom You swore upon Yourself, and told them: I will increase your descendants like the stars of the heavens, and all of this land of which I have spoken, I will give to your descendants and they will inherit it forever” (Exodus 32:13). Yet when this story is related, God’s forgiveness of Israel <b>is based upon Moses’ own merit, as it is stated: “And He said He would destroy them, had Moses, His chosen, not stood before Him in the breach to turn back His destructive fury, lest He should destroy them”</b> (Psalms 106:23).",
            "<b>Hezekiah,</b> however, <b>based</b> his request <b>upon his own merit, as it is written: “Please, remember that I walked before You”</b> (Isaiah 38:3).

            "The Gemara answers, <b>Beit Shammai</b> could <b>have said to you: If so</b> that the verse means only to denote the time for the recitation of <i>Shema</i>, as claimed by Beit Hillel, <b>then let the verse say: “In the morning and in the evening.” What</b> is the meaning of the ambiguous formulation: <b>“When you lie down, and when you rise”?</b> It must mean that <b>at the time of lying down</b> one must recite <i>Shema</i> while <b>actually lying down, and at the time of arising</b> one must recite <i>Shema</i> while <b>actually risen.</b>",

            "The Gemara answers: Beit Shammai <b>need this</b> verse in order to derive other <i>halakhot</i>, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> which interpreted this verse that the obligation to recite <i>Shema</i> applies <b>when you sit in your home, to the exclusion of one who is engaged in</b> performance of <b>a mitzva,</b> who is exempt from the recitation of <i>Shema</i>; <b>and when you walk along the way, to the exclusion of a groom,</b> who is also exempt from the recitation of <i>Shema</i>.

            "The Gemara clarifies the meaning of this <i>baraita</i>, and asks: <b>From where may it be inferred</b> that the verse, when you walk along the way, exempts a groom from the obligation to recite <i>Shema</i>?",
            "<b>Rav Pappa said</b> that we learn: <b>Like the way; just as</b> the journey along a specific <b>way</b> described in the verse <b>is voluntary</b> and involves no mitzva, <b>so too all</b> of those who are obligated to recite <i>Shema</i> are engaged in <b>voluntary</b> activities.

            "However, <b>Rav Yosef said: One who acts in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai has done nothing</b> and must repeat <i>Shema</i> in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel, <b>as we learned</b> in the mishna with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of a <i>sukka</i>: <b>One who had his head and most of his</b> body <b>in the <i>sukka</i>, and his table</b> upon which he was eating <b>inside the house, Beit Shammai invalidate</b> his action, as he is liable to be drawn after the table and end up eating outside the <i>sukka</i>. <b>And Beit Hillel validate</b> his action, since his head and most of his body remain inside the <i>sukka</i>.",
            "<b>Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai</b> as a proof: <b>There was an incident where the elders of Beit Shammai and the elders of Beit Hillel went</b> on <i>Sukkot</i> <b>to visit Rabbi Yoḥanan ben HaḤoranit. They found him with his head and most of his</b> body <b>in the <i>sukka</i> and his table inside the house and they said nothing to him.</b> In other words, even Beit Shammai did not object.",
            "Beit Shammai <b>said to them: And</b> is there <b>proof from there?</b> That is not what happened, rather <b>they said to him</b> explicitly: <b>If you have been</b> accustomed to <b>act in this manner, you have never in your life fulfilled the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>.</b> We see that Beit Shammai held that anyone who did not act in accordance with their opinion, did not fulfill his obligation at all. Similarly, since Beit Hillel’s opinion was accepted as <i>halakha</i>, anyone who acts in accordance with the opinion of Beit Shammai fails to fulfill his obligation.",
            "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak stated</b> an even more extreme opinion: <b>One who acted in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai</b> has acted so egregiously that he <b>is liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty, <b>as we learned</b> in our mishna that <b>Rabbi Tarfon said</b> to his colleagues: Once, <b>I was coming on the road</b> when I stopped and <b>reclined to recite</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai.</b> Yet in so doing, <b>I endangered myself due to the highwaymen</b> who accost travelers. The Sages <b>said to him: You deserved</b> to be in a position where you were <b>liable</b> to pay <b>with your life, as you transgressed the statement of Beit Hillel.</b>",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> From the laws of the recitation of <i>Shema</i> itself, the mishna proceeds to discuss the blessings recited in conjunction with <i>Shema</i>. Here, the order is established: <b>In</b> the <b>morning</b> when reciting <i>Shema</i>, <b>one recites two blessings beforehand,</b> the first on the radiant lights and the second the blessing on the love of Torah, <b>and one thereafter,</b> which begins with: True and Firm [<i>emet veyatziv</i>]. <b>And in the evening one recites two blessings beforehand,</b> on the radiant lights and on the love of God, <b>and two thereafter,</b> the blessing of redemption: True and Faithful [<i>emet ve’emuna</i>], and the blessing: Help us lie down. With regard to the blessing: True and Faithful, <b>whether</b> one recites it in its <b>long</b> formula <b>and whether</b> one recites it in its <b>short</b> formula, he fulfills his obligation (<i>Tosafot</i>).",
            "However, the general principle is: <b>Where</b> the Sages <b>said</b> to recite <b>a long</b> blessing, <b>one may not shorten it,</b> and so too, wherever they said to recite <b>a short</b> blessing, <b>one may not lengthen it.</b> Where the Sages said that a blessing <b>must conclude</b> with a second blessing at the end, <b>he may not fail to conclude</b> with that blessing. Similarly, if the Sages said that a blessing must <b>not conclude</b> with a second blessing, <b>one may not conclude</b> with a blessing.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara begins by determining the formula of the two blessings preceding the morning <i>Shema</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>What blessing does one recite?</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Ya’akov said in the name of Rabbi Oshaya:</b> The blessing focuses on the verse:"
        ],
        [
            "<b>“Who forms light and creates darkness,</b> Who makes peace and creates evil, I am the Lord Who does all these things” (Isaiah 45:7).",
            "With regard to this formula of the blessing, the Gemara asks: <b>Let him say</b> the following formula instead: <b>Who forms light and creates brightness,</b> so as not to mention darkness, which has negative connotations.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>We say</b> the blessing <b>as</b> the verse <b>is written</b> in the Bible and do not alter the formula that appears in the verse.",
            "The Gemara strongly objects: <b>But if so,</b> what about the continuation of the verse: <b>“Who makes peace and creates evil”? Do we say</b> this blessing <b>as it is written</b> in the Bible? <b>Rather, it is written evil and we euphemistically recite</b> the blessing <b>all things</b> to avoid mention of evil. <b>Here, too, let us euphemistically say brightness</b> instead of darkness.",
            "<b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The reason we recite: “Who creates darkness” is <b>in order to mention the attribute of day at night and the attribute of night during the day,</b> and thereby unify day and night as different parts of a single entity.",
            "The Gemara continues and asks: <b>Granted, the attribute of night</b> is mentioned <b>during the day, as we say: Who forms light and creates darkness, but where do you find the attribute of day</b> mentioned <b>at night?</b> In the blessing over the radiant lights recited at night there is no mention of “Who forms light.”",
            "<b>Abaye said:</b> Nevertheless, the attribute of day is mentioned at night in the words: <b>Rolling away light before the darkness and darkness before the light.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And what is</b> the formula of <b>the other</b> blessing recited before <i>Shema</i>? <b>Rav Yehuda said in the name of Shmuel: An abounding love [<i>ahava rabba</i>]. And Rabbi Elazar instructed his son, Rabbi Pedat,</b> to <b>also</b> say: <b>An abounding love.</b>",
            "<b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One does not recite: An eternal love [<i>ahavat olam</i>]; rather,</b> one recites: <b>An abounding love. And the Rabbis say</b> that one recites: <b>An eternal love, and so it says: “And an eternal love I have loved you, therefore I have drawn you with kindness”</b> (Jeremiah 31:2).",
            "The blessing: An abounding love, is about God’s love for us and includes praise for His giving us the Torah. Therefore, <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: One who arose to study, until he recites <i>Shema</i> he must recite a</b> special <b>blessing</b> over the Torah. <b>If he</b> already <b>recited <i>Shema</i> he need not recite</b> that <b>blessing, as he has exempted</b> himself <b>by</b> reciting the blessing of: <b>An abounding love,</b> which includes the components of the blessing over the Torah.",
            "Having mentioned the blessing recited over Torah, the Gemara focuses on a dispute over what constitutes Torah in terms of requiring a blessing. <b>Rav Huna said: For</b> the study of <b>Bible, one must recite a blessing,</b> as it is the word of God, <b>and for</b> halakhic <b>midrash,</b> the derivation of <i>halakhot</i> from verses, <b>one need not recite a blessing.</b>",
            "<b>And Rabbi Elazar said: For Bible and midrash,</b> which includes <i>halakhot</i> derived from verses themselves, <b>one must recite a blessing; for Mishna,</b> which is only comprised of halakhic rulings issued by the Sages, <b>one need not recite a blessing.</b>",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even for Mishna,</b> which includes final, binding halakhic rulings, <b>one must recite a blessing as well, but for Talmud,</b> which comprises a study of the Mishna and the rationales for its rulings, <b>one need not recite a blessing.</b>",
            "<b>And Rava said: Even for Talmud,</b> which is the means to analyze the significance of the <i>halakhot</i>, and is the only form of Torah study that leads one to its true meaning, <b>one must recite a blessing.</b>",
            "This statement is supported by the practical <i>halakha</i> derived from observation of Rav’s practice. His student, <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi, said: Many times I stood before Rav to study our chapter in the <i>Sifra</i>,</b> also known as <i>Torat Kohanim</i>, the halakhic midrash on Leviticus, <b>of the school of Rav,</b> and I saw that Rav <b>would first wash his hands,</b> then <b>recite a blessing,</b> and only then <b>he would teach us our chapter.</b> This demonstrates that even before their study of <i>Torat Kohanim</i>, which, due to Rav’s explanation of the reasons behind the <i>halakhot</i>, was the equivalent of studying Talmud, one must recite a blessing.",
            "The Gemara clarifies: <b>What</b> formula of <b>blessings does he recite?</b> There is a dispute over the formula of the blessings as well. <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The formula of this blessing is like the standard formula for blessings recited over other mitzvot: Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, <b>Who sanctified us with his mitzvot and commanded us to engage in matters of Torah.</b>",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan concludes</b> the blessing by adding <b>the following: Lord our God, make the words of Your Torah sweet in our mouths and in the mouths of Your people, the house of Israel, so that we and our descendants and the descendants of Your people, the house of Israel, may be those who know Your name and engage in Your Torah. Blessed are You, Lord, Who teaches Torah to His people Israel.</b>",
            "<b>And Rav Hamnuna said</b> an additional formula: <b>Who has chosen us from all the peoples and given us His Torah. Blessed are You, Lord, Giver of the Torah.</b> With regard to this formula, <b>Rav Hamnuna said: This</b> concise blessing <b>is the most outstanding of all the blessings</b> over the Torah, as it combines thanks to God for giving us the Torah as well as acclaim for the Torah and for Israel.",
            "Since several formulas for the blessing over Torah were suggested, each with its own distinct advantage, the Gemara concludes: <b>Therefore, let us recite them all</b> as blessings over the Torah.",
            "The Gemara returns to dealing with the blessings that accompany <i>Shema</i>, and describes the practice in the Temple. <b>We learned there,</b> in a mishna in tractate <i>Tamid</i>: In the morning <b>the</b> deputy High Priest <b>appointed</b> to oversee activity in the Temple, <b>said to</b> the priests who were members of the priestly watch [<i>mishmar</i>] on duty that week: <b>Recite a single blessing.</b> The members of the priestly watch <b>recited a blessing, and read the Ten Commandments, <i>Shema</i>, <i>VeHaya im Shamoa</i> and <i>VaYomer</i>,</b> the standard recitation of <i>Shema</i>. Additionally, <b>they blessed the people</b> with <b>three blessings.</b> These blessings were: <b>True and Firm,</b> the blessing of redemption recited after <i>Shema</i>; <b><i>Avoda</i>,</b> service, the special blessing recited over God’s acceptance of the sacrifices with favor, similar to the blessing of Temple Service recited in the <i>Amida</i> prayer; <b>and the priestly benediction,</b> recited in the form of a prayer without the outstretched hands that usually accompany that blessing (<i>Tosafot</i>). <b>And on Shabbat one blessing is added to</b> bless <b>the outgoing priestly watch,</b> as the watch serving in the Temple was replaced on Shabbat.",
            "Certain details in this mishna are not sufficiently clear. First, <b>what is the single blessing</b> that the deputy High Priest instructed the guards to recite? The Gemara relates: It is <b>like</b> the incident <b>where Rabbi Abba and Rabbi Yosei bar Abba happened to</b> visit <b>a certain</b> unnamed <b>place,</b> and the people there <b>asked them: What is the single blessing</b> mentioned in the mishna? They <b>did not have</b> an answer <b>readily available.</b> So <b>they came and asked Rav Mattana, and he</b> too <b>did not have</b> an answer <b>readily available. They came and asked Rav Yehuda,</b> and <b>he told them: Shmuel said as follows: An abounding love</b> is the single blessing recited by the priestly watch.",
            "<b>Rabbi Zerika said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ami said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said</b> a different answer: This single blessing is: <b>Who creates light.</b> That was how Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish’s statement was received in Babylonia, yet <b>when Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said</b> that this <i>halakha</i> was not a direct quote of a statement by Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish. <b>That which Rabbi Zerika said was not stated explicitly</b> by Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, but <b>rather it was inferred from</b> another statement. <b>As Rabbi Zerika said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ami said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said:</b> From the expression: Recite a single blessing, in the mishna in tractate <i>Tamid</i>, <b>it follows</b> that failure to recite one of the <b>blessings</b> recited before <i>Shema</i> <b>does not prevent</b> one from reciting the <b>other.</b> This means that if only one of the blessings was recited, the obligation to recite that blessing was fulfilled, as the two blessings are not mutually dependent.",
            "The conclusion was drawn from Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish’s statement that he held that the single blessing recited was: Who creates light. The considerations that led the Sages to that conclusion were: <b>Granted, if you say that they would recite: Who creates light,</b> then the conclusion of Reish Lakish, that failure to recite one of the <b>blessings</b> recited before <i>Shema</i> <b>does not prevent one</b> from reciting the <b>other,</b> is understandable, as they recited: Who creates light, <b>and did not recite: An abounding love,</b> and they nonetheless fulfilled their obligation."
        ],
        [
            "<b>However, if you say that they</b> would omit: Who creates light, and <b>would recite: An abounding love,</b> on <b>what</b> basis would you conclude that failure to recite one of the <b>blessings</b> recited before <i>Shema</i> <b>does not prevent</b> one from reciting the <b>other?</b> In that case, one could offer another reason why only a single blessing is recited. <b>Perhaps</b> the fact <b>that they did not recite: Who creates light was because the time for the recitation of: Who creates light, had not yet arrived,</b> as the sun had yet to rise. The blessings of the priestly watch are recited in the early morning hours, long before sunrise. <b>However,</b> afterward, <b>when the time</b> to recite: <b>Who creates light arrived, they would recite it.</b> From the conclusion drawn by Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, that failure to recite one of the blessings recited before <b><i>Shema</i></b> does not prevent one from reciting the other, it is clear that the blessing recited by the members of the priestly watch was: Who creates light.",
            "As this deductive reasoning seems coherent and convincing, the Gemara asks: <b>And if</b> this <i>halakha</i> is <b>based on inference,</b> and not on an explicit statement, <b>what</b> of it? There seems to be no other way to interpret Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish’s statement.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> this conclusion <b>were based on an inference,</b> one could say that <b>actually they recited: An abounding love, and when the time</b> to recite: <b>Who creates light arrived, they would recite it.</b> In that case, <b>what</b> is the meaning of: Failure to recite one of the <b>blessings</b> recited before <i>Shema</i> <b>does not prevent</b> one from reciting the <b>other?</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish meant that failure to recite <b>the</b> correct <b>order of the blessings</b> does not prevent one from fulfilling his obligation. Even if one recites: An abounding love before: Who creates light, he fulfills his obligation. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish did not refer to a case where only one of the blessings was recited. Consequently, one cannot infer from his statement his opinion regarding the identity of the single blessing.",
            "The Gemara related above that the priests in the Temple <b>read the Ten Commandments,</b> along with the sections of <b><i>Shema</i>, <i>VeHaya im Shamoa</i>, <i>VaYomer</i>, True and Firm, <i>Avoda,</i> and the priestly benediction.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Even in the outlying areas,</b> outside the Temple, <b>they sought to recite</b> the Ten Commandments <b>in this manner</b> every day, as they are the basis of the Torah (Rambam), <b>but they had already abolished</b> recitation of the Ten Commandments <b>due to the grievance of the heretics,</b> who argued that the entire Torah, with the exception of the Ten Commandments, did not emanate from God (Jerusalem Talmud). If the Ten Commandments were recited daily, that would lend credence to their claim, so their recitation was expunged from the daily prayers.",
            "<b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Natan says: In the outlying areas, they sought to recite</b> the Ten Commandments <b>in this manner, but they had already abolished</b> their recitation <b>due to the grievance of the heretics.</b>",
            "The Gemara relates that several Sages sought to reinstitute recitation of the Ten Commandments, as <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana thought to institute this in</b> the city of <b>Sura,</b> but <b>Rav Ḥisda said to him: They already abolished them due to the grievance of the heretics.</b>",
            "So too, <b>Ameimar thought to institute this in</b> the city of <b>Neharde’a. Rav Ashi,</b> the most prominent of the Sages in that generation, <b>said to him: They already abolished them due to the grievance of the heretics.</b>",
            "We learned in a mishna in tractate <i>Tamid</i> that <b>on Shabbat a single blessing is added to</b> bless <b>the outgoing priestly watch.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> that <b>single blessing?

            "We learned in the mishna: <b>Where</b> the Sages <b>said</b> to recite <b>a long</b> blessing, one may not shorten it, and vice-versa. The Gemara proceeds to address a particular problem arising from conclusions drawn from this mishna. Before addressing the primary problem, however, a simpler, secondary issue is raised: <b>Obviously, in a case where one took a cup of wine in his hand and thought it was beer, and began reciting the blessing thinking it was beer,</b> i.e., he intended to recite the appropriate blessing on beer: By Whose word all things came to be, <b>and</b> upon realizing that it was wine, <b>he concluded</b> the blessing <b>with that</b> which is recited over <b>wine:</b> Who creates the fruit of the vine, <b>he fulfilled</b> his obligation. In that case, <b>even had he recited: By Whose word all things came to be,</b> as he originally intended, <b>he</b> would have <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>If one</b> recited the general blessing: <b>By Whose word all things came to be, over all</b> food items, <b>he fulfilled</b> his obligation after the fact, even if <i>ab initio</i> another blessing was instituted to recite before eating that food. Therefore, if he reconsidered and concluded the blessing with the ending of the blessing over wine, he fulfilled his obligation.",
            "<b>However in a case where one took a cup of beer in his hand and thought it was wine, and began reciting the blessing thinking it was wine,</b> meaning he intended to recite: Who creates the fruit of the vine, <b>and</b> upon realizing that it was beer <b>he concluded</b> the blessing <b>with that</b> which is recited over <b>beer:</b> By Whose word all things came to be, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>?",
            "Ostensibly, this blessing is comprised of two sections. The first section, during which he intended to recite: Who creates the fruit of the vine, cannot fulfill his obligation as it is an inappropriate blessing to recite over beer. However, in the second section he recited: By Whose word all things came to be, the appropriate blessing. The dilemma, then, is: <b>Do we follow the essence</b> of the blessing, the first section, <b>or do we follow the conclusion</b> of the blessing?",
            "<b>Come and hear</b> a proof from what was taught in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a similar case: If, in <b>the morning prayer</b>, one <b>began</b> the blessings prior to the recitation of <i>Shema</i> appropriately <b>with: Who creates light, and concluded with</b> the formula of the evening prayer: <b>Who brings on evenings, he did not fulfill</b> his obligation. However, if one did the opposite, and <b>commenced with: Who brings on evenings, and concluded with: Who creates light, he fulfilled</b> his obligation.",
            "Similarly, if, in <b>the evening prayer</b>, <b>one commenced</b> the recitation of <i>Shema</i> <b>with: Who brings on evenings and concluded with: Who creates light, he did not fulfill</b> his obligation. If <b>one commenced with: Who creates light and concluded with: Who brings on evenings, he fulfilled</b> his obligation.",
            "The <i>baraita</i> summarizes that <b>the general principle is: Everything follows the conclusion</b> of the blessing. Based on this principle, the question with regard to a blessing recited over food and drink posed above can be resolved.",
            "This proof is rejected: <b>There,</b> in the case of the blessing recited over the radiant lights, <b>it is different, as one recites: Blessed</b>…Who <b>forms the radiant lights,</b> and similarly, in the evening one recites: Blessed…Who brings on evenings. Since these are long blessings that conclude with a second blessing summarizing their content, one could assert that everything follows the conclusion. However, in the case of short blessings, such as: By Whose word all things came to be, or: Who creates the fruit of the vine, ostensibly, if there is a problem with the first part of the blessing, the entire blessing is nullified.",
            "The distinction between the blessing recited over the radiant lights and the blessings recited over food and drink stems from the assumption that the conclusion: Blessed…Who fashions the radiant lights, is a complete, independent blessing. However, this is not necessarily so. <b>This works out well according to Rav, who said: Any blessing that does not include mention of God’s name is not</b> considered <b>a blessing,</b> and since: Who creates light, includes God’s name, it constitutes a complete, independent blessing. <b>However, according to Rabbi Yoḥanan, who said: Any blessing that does not include mention of</b> God’s <b>sovereignty,</b> i.e., our God, King of the universe, <b>is not</b> considered <b>a blessing, what can be said</b> to distinguish between the conclusion of the blessings over food and drink and the blessing over the radiant lights? Since the conclusion: Who creates light, does not mention God’s sovereignty, it does not constitute a complete, independent blessing.",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan also holds that the blessing over the radiant lights is a complete blessing. <b>Since Rabba bar Ulla said:</b> Who creates darkness, is mentioned during the day and: Rolling away the light before the darkness, is mentioned at night <b>in order to mention the attribute of day at night and the attribute of night in the day,</b> the beginning of the blessing in which God’s sovereignty is mentioned day and night is appropriate to both day and night, and <b>when one recites the blessing</b> with God’s name <b>and</b> mentions God’s <b>sovereignty at the beginning of the blessing,</b> it refers <b>to both</b> day and night. Therefore, no proof can be cited from the blessing over the radiant lights to the blessings recited over food and drink.",
            "The Gemara attempts to cite an additional proof: <b>Come and hear</b> another solution based on what we learned <b>in the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> cited above: <b>The general principle is: Everything follows the conclusion</b> of the blessing. <b>What does</b> the phrase: The general principle is, come <b>to include</b> beyond the detailed example cited in the <i>baraita</i>? <b>Does it not come to include</b> the case <b>that we stated,</b> that both in the case of a long blessing and the case of a short blessing, the conclusion of the blessing is the determining factor?",
            "The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> the principle is cited <b>to include</b> a case of <b>bread and dates.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of the dilemma with regard to the blessings on these food items? <b>If you say that</b> it is a case <b>where one ate bread and thought that he ate dates, and commenced</b> reciting the blessing <b>thinking it was dates;</b> then, upon realizing that it was bread, <b>he concluded</b> the blessing <b>with that</b> which is recited <b>over bread, isn’t that our dilemma,</b> as this case is identical to the one involving wine and beer?",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>No; this</b> general principle <b>is</b> only <b>necessary</b> to teach a special <b>case</b>, <b>where one ate dates and thought that he ate bread, and commenced</b> reciting the blessing <b>thinking they were bread.</b> Upon realizing that they were dates, <b>he concluded</b> the blessing <b>with that</b> which is recited <b>over dates.</b> In that case <b>he fulfilled</b> his obligation, as <b>even had he concluded</b> the blessing <b>with that</b> which is recited <b>over bread, he</b> would have <b>fulfilled his obligation.</b>",
            "<b>What is the reason</b> that had he concluded with the blessing recited over bread he would have fulfilled his obligation to recite a blessing over dates? This is <b>because dates also provide</b> a person <b>sustenance.</b> While <i>ab initio</i> one should not recite the blessing for bread over dates, after the fact, if one did so, he fulfilled his obligation. It is with regard to this particular situation that the <i>baraita</i> established the principle: Everything follows the conclusion of the blessing.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the conclusion that was reached <b>about this</b> <i>halakha</i>?",
            "Here, too, opinions differ: <b>Rav Yosef said</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Elazar: There is no need to change the standard formula: <b>The holy God and: King Who loves righteousness and justice.

            "<b>And Rabba bar Ḥinnana Sava said in the name of Rav: Anyone who can ask for mercy on behalf of another, and does not ask is called a sinner, as it is stated</b> following Samuel’s rebuke of the people: <b>“As for me, far be it from me that I should transgress against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you,</b> but I will teach you the good and the right way” (I Samuel 12:23). Had Samuel refrained from prayer, he would have committed a sin.",
            "<b>Rava said: If</b> the one in need of mercy <b>is a Torah scholar,</b> it is insufficient to merely pray on his behalf. Rather, <b>one must make himself ill</b> worrying <b>about him.</b>",
            "The Gemara seeks to clarify the source of this <i>halakha</i>. <b>What is the reason</b> that one must make oneself ill over a Torah scholar in need of mercy? <b>If you say</b> that it is <b>because</b> of what Saul said to his men, <b>as it is written: “And there is none of you that is ill over me or tells unto me”</b> (I Samuel 22:8), meaning that because Saul was a Torah scholar, it would have been appropriate for people to make themselves ill worrying about him; this is not an absolute proof. <b>Perhaps a king is different,</b> and excessive worry is appropriate in that case. Rather, proof that one must make oneself ill over a Torah scholar in need for mercy is <b>from here:</b> When David speaks of his enemies, Doeg and Ahitophel, who were Torah scholars, he says: <b>“But for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth,</b> I afflicted my soul with fasting” (Psalms 35:13). One must be concerned to the extent that he dresses in sackcloth and fasts for the recovery of a Torah scholar.",
            "<b>And Rabba bar Ḥinnana Sava said in the name of Rav: One who commits an act of transgression and is ashamed of it, all of his transgressions are forgiven.</b> Shame is a sign that one truly despises his transgressions and that shame has the power to atone for his actions (Rabbi Yoshiyahu Pinto), <b>as it is stated: “In order that you remember, and be embarrassed, and never open your mouth anymore, because of your shame, when I have forgiven you for all that you have done, said the Lord, God”</b> (Ezekiel 16:63).",
            "However this proof is rejected: <b>Perhaps a community is different,</b> as a community is forgiven more easily than an individual. <b>Rather,</b> proof that an individual ashamed of his actions is forgiven for his transgressions is cited <b>from here,</b> when King Saul consulted Samuel by means of a necromancer before his final war with the Philistines: <b>“And Samuel said to Saul, why have you angered me to bring me up?

            "The reason for this is <b>because he killed</b> all the residents of <b>Nov, the city of priests,</b> and because of this transgression Saul was ashamed to consult the <i>Urim VeTummim</i>, which was accomplished by means of a priest.",
            "The Gemara concludes: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that Saul was pardoned by</b> God in <b>the heavens</b> for his transgressions? <b>As it is stated: “And Samuel said to Saul: Tomorrow you and your sons will be with me”</b> (I Samuel 28:19). <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: With me</b> does not only mean that they will die, but also means, in a statement that contains an aspect of consolation, that they will be <b>in my company</b> among the righteous in heaven, as Saul was pardoned for his transgressions.",
            "<b>And the Rabbis say</b> that proof that Saul was pardoned is derived <b>from here,</b> from what the Gibeonites said to David: “Let seven men of his sons be given to us <b>and we will hang them up unto the Lord in the Giva of Saul, the chosen of the Lord”</b> (II Samuel 21:6). Certainly the Gibeonites, who were furious at Saul, would not refer to him as the chosen of the Lord.

            "On this, the Gemara asks: <b>And</b> if it is important to include this as part of <i>Shema</i> because of this single verse, then <b>let us say this verse and nothing more.</b>",
            "The Gemara rejects this: It is impossible to do this, as <b>they learned</b> through tradition that <b>any portion that Moses, our teacher, divided, we</b> too <b>divide</b> and read separately. However, a portion <b>that Moses, our teacher, did not divide, we do not divide</b> and read separately. And, as stated above, the Sages did not wish to institute the recitation of the entire portion of Balak to avoid placing an encumbrance on the congregation.",
            "The Gemara continues: <b>Why was the portion of ritual fringes established</b> as part of the recitation of <i>Shema</i> when its content is unrelated to that of the preceding portions?",
            "<b>Rabbi Yehuda bar Ḥaviva said:</b> The portion of ritual fringes was added <b>because it includes five elements</b> including the primary reason for its inclusion, the exodus from Egypt (<i>Melo HaRo’im</i>): <b>The mitzva of ritual fringes,</b> mention of <b>the exodus from Egypt,</b> the acceptance of <b>the yoke of mitzvot,</b> admonition against <b>the opinions of the heretics,</b> admonition against <b>thoughts of</b> the <b>transgressions</b> of licentiousness, <b>and</b> admonition against <b>thoughts of idolatry.</b>",
            "The Gemara clarifies: <b>Granted, these three are mentioned explicitly: The yoke of mitzvot</b> is mentioned in the portion of ritual fringes, <b>as it is written: “And you shall look upon them and remember all the mitzvot of the Lord</b> and you shall do them” (Numbers 15:39). <b>Ritual fringes</b> are mentioned explicitly, <b>as it is written: “And they will make for themselves ritual fringes”</b> (Numbers 15:38). <b>The exodus from Egypt</b> is also mentioned explicitly, <b>as it is written:</b> “I am the Lord, your God, <b>who took you out</b> from the Land of Egypt” (Numbers 15:41). <b>But where do we</b> derive the other elements mentioned above: Admonition against <b>the opinions of the heretics,</b> admonition against <b>thoughts of transgressions</b> of licentiousness, <b>and</b> admonition against <b>thoughts of idolatry?</b>",
            "In response, the Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> where these elements were derived from allusions in the verse, “You shall stray neither after your hearts nor after your eyes, after which you would lust” (Numbers 15:39). <b>As it was taught: “After your hearts” refers to</b> following opinions <b>of heresy</b> that may arise in one’s heart. The Gemara offers a proof, <b>as it is stated: “The fool said in his heart: ‘There is no God’;</b> they have been corrupt, they have acted abominably; there is none who does good” (Psalms 14:1). The phrase: <b>“After your eyes,”</b> in <b>this</b> verse refers to following <b>thoughts of transgressions</b> of licentiousness, that a person might see and desire, <b>as it is stated: “And Samson said to his father, ‘That one take for me, for she is upright in my eyes’”</b> (Judges 14:3). The passage: <b>“You shall stray after”</b> refers to promiscuity, which in the parlance of the prophets is a metaphor for <b>idol worship, as it is stated:</b> “The children of Israel again <b>went astray after the Be’alim”</b> (Judges 8:33).",
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> It is a mitzva by Torah law to mention the exodus from Egypt at night, but some held that this mitzva was, like phylacteries or ritual fringes, fulfilled only during the day and not at night. For this reason it was decided: <b>The exodus from Egypt is mentioned at night,</b> adjacent to the recitation of <i>Shema</i>. <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya said: I am approximately seventy years old, and</b> although I have long held this opinion, <b>I was never privileged</b> to prevail (<i>Me’iri</i>) and prove that there is a biblical obligation to fulfill the accepted custom (Ra’avad) and have <b>the exodus from Egypt mentioned at night, until Ben Zoma interpreted it homiletically</b> and proved it obligatory.",
            "Ben Zoma derived it <b>as it is stated: “That you may remember the day you went out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:3). <b>The days of your life,</b> refers to daytime alone; however, the addition of the word all, as it is stated: <b>All the days of your life,</b> comes to add nights as well.",
            "<b>And the Rabbis,</b> who posit that there is no biblical obligation to mention the exodus from Egypt at night, explain the word, all, differently and <b>say: The days of your life,</b> refers to the days in <b>this world, all</b> is added <b>to include the days of the Messiah.</b>",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The fundamental dispute between Ben Zoma and the Sages appears in the mishna, and the <i>baraita</i> cites its continuation. Disputing the position of the Sages that: All the days of your life, refers to both this world and the days of the Messiah, <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Ben Zoma said to the Sages: And is the exodus from Egypt mentioned in the days of the Messiah?

            "Having mentioned the changing of Jacob’s name, the Gemara addresses the changing of the names of Abraham and Sarah. What is the meaning of changing Abram’s name to Abraham? As it is stated: <b>“Abram is Abraham”</b> (I Chronicles 1:27).",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>Initially he became a father,</b> a minister, and prominent person, only <b>to Aram,</b> so he was called Abram, father [av] of Aram, <b>and ultimately</b> with God’s blessing <b>he became the father of the entire world,</b> so he was called Abraham, father of the masses [<i>av hamon</i>], as it is stated: “I have made you the father of a multitude of nations” (Genesis 17:5).",

            "The Gemara explains: <b>Initially she was a princess</b> only <b>to her nation:</b> My princess [<i>Sarai</i>], <b>but ultimately she became Sarah,</b> a general term indicating that she was princess <b>for the entire world.</b>",
            "Also, with regard to Abraham’s name, <b>bar Kappara taught: Anyone who calls Abraham Abram transgresses a positive mitzva, as it is stated: “And your name will be Abraham”</b> (Genesis 17:5).

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if we consider these obligatory statements, then <b>from here</b> we must infer that <b>one who calls Sarah Sarai also</b> transgresses a positive or negative mitzva.",
            "The Gemara answers: <b>There</b> in the case of Sarah, it is not a general mitzva, rather <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Abraham</b> alone: “And God said to Abraham, <b>your wife Sarai, you shall not call her name Sarai; rather, Sarah is her name”</b> (Genesis 17:15). In contrast, this is stated regarding Abraham in general terms: “Your name shall no longer be called Abram.”",

            "The Gemara answers: <b>It is different there, as the verse reverts back</b> and God Himself refers to Jacob as Jacob, <b>as it is written</b> before his descent to Egypt: <b>“And God said to Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob,</b> and he said, ‘Here I am’” (Genesis 46:2).",

            "<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> There is a distinction between greeting someone and responding to his greeting. <b>In the middle</b> of each paragraph, one may <b>greet</b> another <b>due to fear and respond due to respect.

            "<b>And Rabbi Yosei</b> agrees with the principle derived by the first <i>tanna</i> from the word <i>Shema</i>; however Rabbi Yosei holds: <b>Derive two</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>from</b> the word <i>Shema</i>; first, one may recite <i>Shema</i> in any language, and second, one must recite it in a manner audible to his own ears.",
            "<b>We learned there</b> in a mishna regarding the laws of separating tithes: <b>A deaf person who can speak but cannot hear may not separate <i>teruma</i></b> <i>ab initio</i>, because he must recite a blessing over the separation of <i>teruma</i> and he is unable to hear the blessing. <b>But</b> after the fact, <b>if he did separate it, his <i>teruma</i> is</b> valid <b><i>teruma</i>.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Who is</b> this <b><i>tanna</i></b> who holds that if <b>a deaf person who can speak but cannot hear</b> separates <i>teruma</i>, <b>it is</b> considered <i>teruma</i> <b>after the fact,</b> but <b><i>ab initio</i></b> he may <b>not</b> do so?",

            "<b>What is</b> the source for <b>one who speaks</b> disparagingly <b>after the biers of Torah scholars? As we learned</b> in the mishna: Akavya ben Mahalalel <b>would say:</b> In the case of a woman whose husband suspects her of adultery, who was warned by her husband not to seclude herself with another man and she did not listen (see Numbers 5), the court <b>does not administer</b> the bitter water potion of a <i>sota</i> to <b>a convert or an emancipated</b> maidservant. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The court <b>administers</b> the bitter water potion to them. <b>And</b> the Rabbis <b>said to him</b> as proof: <b>There is the story of Kharkemit, an emancipated maidservant in Jerusalem, and Shemaya and Avtalyon administered her</b> the bitter waters.

And</b> in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> with regard to one who dies while under a ban of ostracism, the court <b>stoned his coffin.</b> Apparently, one who deprecates a deceased Torah scholar is sentenced to ostracism.",
            "And <b>what is</b> the source for <b>one who demeans</b> the ritual of <b>washing of the hands? We learned</b> later in the same mishna: <b>Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> That story related with regard to the ostracism of Akavya ben Mahalalel is completely untrue; <b>God forbid that Akavya ben Mahalalel was ostracized, as the Temple courtyard is not closed on any Jew,</b> meaning that even when all of Israel made the pilgrimage to Jerusalem, when each of the three groups that gathered to offer the Paschal lamb filled the courtyard, leading the Temple administration to close the courtyard, there was no one there as perfect <b>in wisdom, purity and fear of sin as Akavya ben Mahalalel. Rather, whom did they excommunicate? Elazar ben Ḥanokh,</b> because he <b>doubted</b> and demeaned the rabbinic ordinance of <b>washing of the hands. And when he died, the court sent</b> instructions <b>and they placed a large rock upon his coffin</b> in order <b>to teach you that one who is ostracized and dies in</b> a state of <b>ostracism, the court stones his coffin,</b> as if symbolically stoning him. Apparently, one who makes light of the ritual of washing of the hands is sentenced to ostracism.",
            "<b>What is</b> the source for the third case, <b>one who is arrogant vis-à-vis Heaven?</b> The mishna relates that Ḥoni HaMe’aggel, the circle-drawer, drew a circle and stood inside it, and said that he would not leave the circle until it rained, and he went so far as to make demands in terms of the manner in which he wanted the rain to fall. After it rained, <b>Shimon ben Shataḥ,</b> the <i>Nasi</i> of the Sanhedrin, relayed to <b>Ḥoni HaMe’aggel:</b> Actually, <b>you should be ostracized</b> for what you said, <b>and if you were not Ḥoni, I would have decreed ostracism upon you, but what can I do? You nag God and He does your bidding, like a son who nags his father and</b> his father <b>does his bidding</b> without reprimand. After all, the rain fell as you requested. <b>About you, the verse states: “Your father and mother will be glad and she who bore you will rejoice”</b> (Proverbs 23:25). Apparently, one who is arrogant vis-à-vis Heaven would ordinarily merit excommunication.",
            "The Gemara challenges this: <b>And are there no more</b> cases of excommunication or threats of excommunication? <b>Surely there are</b> additional cases like the one in the <i>baraita</i> <b>taught by Rav Yosef:</b> It is told that <b>Theodosius of Rome,</b> leader of the Jewish community there, <b>instituted the custom for the Roman</b> Jews <b>to eat whole kids,</b> young goats roasted with their entrails over their heads, as was the custom when roasting the Paschal lamb, <b>on the eve of Passover,</b> as they did in the Temple. <b>Shimon ben Shataḥ sent</b> a message <b>to him: If you were not Theodosius,</b> an important person, <b>I would have decreed ostracism upon you, as</b> it appears as if <b>you are feeding Israel consecrated food,</b> which may only be eaten in and around the Temple itself, <b>outside</b> the Temple.",

He holds that, although the fragments of the oven were pieced together, it is not considered an intact vessel but, rather, as a collection of fragments, and a broken earthenware vessel cannot become ritually impure. <b>And the Rabbis deem it ritually impure.</b> Since the oven continues to serve its original function, it is still considered a single entity and a whole vessel despite the sand put between the pieces. <b>And this is</b> called <b>the oven of <i>akhnai</i>, snake.</b>",

            "<b>Rabbi Abba explained</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a path that passes <b>through an area where there is uncertainty with regard to the location of a grave or a corpse</b> [<b><i>beit haperas</i>].</b> For example, with regard to a field in which there is a grave that was plowed and no longer intact, the entire field is deemed impure due to concern that the plow scattered bones throughout the field. The field is impure only <b>by rabbinic law</b> but not according to Torah law. Since it is only prohibited by rabbinic law, one is permitted to walk through the field to show the mourner respect.",
            "The Gemara cites proof that the legal status of a <i>beit haperas</i> is unlike the legal status of impurity by Torah law: <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: One</b> who passes through <b>a <i>beit haperas</i> may blow</b> on the dust before taking each step, so that if there is a bone beneath the dust, he will expose it, avoid it, <b>and walk.</b> One may not rely on that method of examination with regard to impurity by Torah law. <b>And Rav Yehuda bar Ashi said in the name of Rav: A <i>beit haperas</i> that has been trodden</b> underfoot, creating a path, <b>is pure,</b> and one no longer need be concerned about bones. Clearly, the entire prohibition is a stringency decreed by the Sages.",
            "The Gemara cites additional proof with regard to the extent to which human dignity overrides mitzvot in the Torah. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as Rabbi Elazar bar Tzadok</b> the priest <b>said:</b> I and my fellow priests <b>would jump over coffins of the deceased</b> in order to hurry <b>towards kings of Israel</b> to greet them. <b>And they did not say</b> this <b>only towards kings of Israel, but</b> they said this <b>even towards kings of the nations of the world, so that if one will be privileged</b> to witness the redemption of Israel, <b>he will distinguish between kings of Israel and kings of the nations of the world.</b> The priest violated the Torah prohibition to become ritually impure through contact with the dead, in order to show respect for a king. And <b>why</b> is this? <b>Let us say</b> here too: <b>“There is neither wisdom, nor understanding, nor counsel against the Lord.”</b>",
            "The Gemara responds to this challenge by saying that it must be understood <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rava, as Rava said: By Torah law, a tent</b> over a corpse, <b>as long as there is a handbreadth of space</b> between the corpse and the tent over it, <b>constitutes a barrier before</b> the spread of <b>impurity</b> and nothing above the tent can become ritually impure due to impurity imparted by the corpse. <b>And when there is not a handbreadth of space</b> between the corpse and the tent over it, the tent <b>does not constitute a barrier before</b> the spread of <b>impurity</b> and the “pressed” ritual impurity, can reach the heavens.",
            "<b>Most coffins have a handbreadth of space.</b> Consequently, their impurity does not spread above the coffin.

All rabbinic decrees are predicated on the mitzva in the Torah to heed the judges in each generation and to never stray from their words.

Why then did the mishna need to mention it specifically?",
            "The Gemara replies: <b>Lest you say: Since</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>includes</b> the acceptance of the yoke of <b>the kingdom of Heaven,</b> perhaps women are obligated in its recitation despite the fact that it is a time-bound, positive mitzva.

And</b> similarly: <b>The blessing before</b> partaking of <b>food</b> from <b>the blessing over the Torah</b> by means of an <b><i>a fortiori</i> inference: Torah, which requires no</b> blessing <b>afterward</b> by Torah law, <b>requires</b> a blessing <b>beforehand; food, which requires</b> a blessing <b>afterward, is it not right that it requires</b> a blessing <b>beforehand?</b>",
            "The Gemara notes: The logic of this <i>a fortiori</i> inference <b>can be refuted: What</b> is true with regard <b>to food, where one derives pleasure</b> from eating, is not true with regard to matters which offer no bodily pleasure. Therefore, the blessing over the Torah cannot be derived from the blessing over food. <b>And</b> similarly: <b>What</b> is true with regard to <b>Torah, that</b> provides <b>eternal life</b> to those who engage in its study, is not true with regard to matters that do not provide eternal life. Therefore, the blessing before partaking of food cannot be derived from the blessing over the Torah. <b>Furthermore, we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>Over food,</b> one who is impure due to a seminal emission <b>recites a blessing afterward, but does not recite a blessing beforehand.</b> The mishna does not derive the blessing recited before a meal from the blessing recited over Torah. Consequently, this is a <b>conclusive refutation</b> of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement.",
            "<b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> One who is <b>uncertain whether he recited <i>Shema</i> or whether he did not recite</b> it <b>does not recite it again.</b> However, one who is <b>uncertain whether he recited: True and Firm [<i>emet veyatziv</i>],</b> the blessing that follows <i>Shema</i> in the morning, <b>must recite <i>emet veyatziv</i> again. What is the reason</b> for this? In his opinion, the obligation to recite <b><i>Shema</i></b> is only <b>by rabbinic law.</b> His ruling follows the principle that in cases of uncertainty involving rabbinic law, the ruling is lenient and he need not repeat it. However, since <b><i>emet veyatziv</i></b> is primarily a commemoration of the exodus from Egypt, it is a mitzva <b>by Torah law,</b> and, in cases of uncertainty involving Torah law, the ruling is stringent and he must repeat it.",
            "<b>Rav Yosef raises an objection:</b> How can you say that the obligation to recite <i>Shema</i> is only by rabbinic law when it is explicitly written: “And you shall recite them to your children and speak of them when you sit in your home and when you walk by the way, <b>when you lie down and when you rise”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:7)? <b>Abaye said to him: That</b> verse <b>was written with regard to matters of Torah.</b> One need not interpret the verse in the conventional manner, as obligating the recitation of <i>Shema</i>, but rather as referring to the general obligation to study Torah.",
            "From here, the Gemara attempts to resolve this issue by citing proof from the mishna. <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>One who experienced a seminal emission</b> may <b>contemplate</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>in his heart, but neither recites the blessings preceding</b> <i>Shema</i>, <b>nor the blessings thereafter. Over food</b> which, after partaking, one is obligated by Torah law to recite a blessing, <b>one recites a blessing thereafter, but not beforehand.</b>",
            "<b>And if it would enter your mind</b> that the obligation to recite <b><i>emet veyatziv</i> is by Torah law, let him recite the blessing after</b> <i>Shema</i>. Since he does not recite the blessing, apparently, he is exempt.",
            "The Gemara refutes this: <b>What is the reason that he recites</b> <i>emet veyatziv</i>? <b>If</b> it is <b>because</b> it deals primarily with <b>the exodus from Egypt, wasn’t it</b> already <b>mentioned in the recitation of <i>Shema</i>,</b> in the portion of the ritual fringes?",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>And let him say this,</b> <i>emet veyatziv</i>, <b>and he will not need</b> to recite <b>that,</b> <i>Shema</i>.

            "<b>And Rabbi Elazar said</b> a different opinion: One who is <b>uncertain whether he recited <i>Shema</i></b> or <b>whether he did not recite</b> <i>Shema,</i> <b>must recite <i>Shema</i> again.</b> According to his opinion, there is a mitzva by Torah law to recite <i>Shema</i>. However, if one is <b>uncertain whether he prayed or whether he did not pray, he does not pray again,</b> as the obligation to pray is by rabbinic law. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> He must pray again; <b>if only a person would pray throughout the entire day.</b>",

            "The Gemara rejects this: <b>How can you compare</b> the two cases? <b>There,</b> on Shabbat, <b>the individual is one who is obligated</b> and should actually recite all eighteen blessings, <b>and it is the Sages who did not impose upon him in deference to Shabbat</b> and instituted an abridged formula. <b>But here, didn’t he</b> already <b>pray?</b> Therefore he can stop, even in the middle of a blessing.",

            "The Gemara notes: This concept is identical to Shmuel’s previous statement regarding one who already prayed that he need not pray again. Nevertheless, both statements are <b>necessary.

            "The Gemara clarifies: <b>With regard to what do they disagree?</b> The basis for their dispute is that one <b>Sage,</b> Rav Huna, <b>holds: An individual</b> is permitted to <b>recite <i>kedusha</i></b> on his own, so he need not insist on reciting it along with the prayer leader; <b>and</b> the other <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, <b>holds</b> that <b>an individual may not recite <i>kedusha</i></b> alone, and, therefore he is required to complete his prayer before the communal prayer leader reaches <i>kedusha</i>.",
            "<b>Similarly, Rav Adda bar Ahava stated,</b> in accordance with the second opinion: <b>From where is it derived that an individual may not recite <i>kedusha</i></b> alone? <b>As it is stated: “And I shall be hallowed among the children of Israel”</b> (Leviticus 22:32), <b>any expression of sanctity may not be</b> recited in a quorum of <b>fewer than ten</b> men.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>How is this inferred</b> from that verse?

            "We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> with regard to one who experiences a seminal emission; <b>he recites a blessing beforehand and afterward</b> in both the case of <i>Shema</i> and in the case of food. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that Rabbi Yehuda holds that one who experienced a seminal emission is permitted</b> to engage <b>in matters of Torah?

This juxtaposition teaches us that <b>just as below,</b> at the revelation at Mount Sinai, <b>those who experienced a seminal emission were prohibited</b> and were commanded to refrain from relations with their wives and immerse themselves, <b>so too here,</b> throughout the generations, <b>those who experience a seminal emission are prohibited</b> from engaging in Torah study.",
            "<b>And if you say that Rabbi Yehuda does not derive homiletic interpretations from juxtaposed</b> verses, <b>didn’t Rav Yosef</b> already say: <b>Even one who does not derive homiletic interpretations from juxtaposed</b> verses throughout <b>the entire Torah,</b> nevertheless, <b>derives</b> them <b>in Deuteronomy [<i>Mishne Torah</i>], as Rabbi Yehuda does not derive homiletic interpretations from juxtaposed</b> verses <b>throughout the entire Torah and he does derive them in <i>Mishne Torah</i>.</b>",
            "<b>And from where do we derive</b> that Rabbi Yehuda <b>does not derive homiletic interpretations</b> from juxtaposed verses <b>throughout the entire Torah? As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the punishment of a sorceress, <b>ben Azzai says: It is stated: “You shall not allow a sorceress to live”</b> (Exodus 22:17), although the manner of her execution is not specified, <b>and it is stated: “Whoever lies with a beast shall surely be put to death”</b> (Exodus 22:18). The fact that the Torah <b>juxtaposed this matter to that</b> was <b>to say: Just as one who lies with a beast</b> is executed <b>by stoning</b> (see Leviticus 20), <b>so too a sorceress</b> is executed <b>by stoning.</b>",
            "With regard to this proof <b>Rabbi Yehuda said to him: And does</b> the fact <b>that</b> the Torah <b>juxtaposed this matter to that warrant taking</b> this person <b>out to be stoned?</b> Should he be sentenced to the most severe of the death penalties on that basis <b>Rather,</b> the source is: <b>Mediums and wizards were included among all sorcerers.

In order to <b>draw an analogy to them and say to you: Just as a medium and a wizard</b> are executed <b>by stoning, so too is a sorceress</b> executed <b>by stoning.</b>",
            "<b>And from where do we derive</b> that Rabbi Yehuda <b>derives homiletic interpretations</b> from juxtaposed verses <b>in <i>Mishne Torah</i>?

The last expression, “and shall not uncover his father’s skirt,” implies that: <b>A skirt that has been seen by his father,</b> i.e., any woman who has had sexual relations with his father, <b>may not be uncovered</b> by his son, i.e., his son may not marry her.",

            "At any rate, we see that in Deuteronomy, Rabbi Yehuda derives homiletic interpretations from juxtaposed verses.

As it is stated: “And you shall impart them to your children and your children’s children”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:9) <b>after which it is written: “The day that you stood before the Lord your God at Horeb.”</b> Therefore, Rabbi Yehuda cannot derive from that same juxtaposition a prohibition banning one who experienced a seminal emission from engaging in matters of Torah.",
            "<b>We learned</b> in a mishna that <b>a <i>zav</i> who experienced a seminal emission, and a menstruating woman who discharged semen, and a woman who engaged in intercourse</b> with her husband <b>and she saw</b> menstrual <b>blood,</b> all of whom are ritually impure for at least seven days due to the severity of their impurity, nevertheless <b>require ritual immersion</b> in order to purify themselves from the impurity of the seminal emission before they may engage in matters of Torah. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda exempts</b> them from immersion.",
            "However, <b>Rabbi Yehuda only exempted</b> from immersion in the case <b>of a <i>zav</i> who experienced a seminal emission, who was unfit to immerse himself from the outset,</b> as even after immersion he would remain impure with the seven-day impurity of the <i>zav</i>. <b>But,</b> in the case of <b>one who experienced a seminal emission alone,</b> with no concurrent impurity, even Rabbi Yehuda <b>requires</b> immersion before he may engage in Torah matters.",

            "The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>And does Rabbi Yehuda maintain that</b> there is validity to <b>contemplating</b> in his heart? <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who experienced a seminal emission and who has no water to immerse</b> and purify himself <b>recites <i>Shema</i> and neither recites the blessings</b> of <i>Shema</i> <b>beforehand nor thereafter?

            "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> Rabbi Yehuda’s statement in the mishna should be interpreted in another way. <b>Rabbi Yehuda rendered</b> the blessings <b>like <i>Hilkhot Derekh Eretz</i>,</b> which according to some Sages were not considered to be in the same category as all other matters of Torah and therefore, one is permitted to engage in their study even after having experienced a seminal emission.",
            "<b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written: <b>“And you shall impart them to your children and your children’s children”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:9), <b>and it is written thereafter: “The day that you stood before the Lord your God at Horeb”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:10). <b>Just as below,</b> the Revelation at Sinai was <b>in reverence, fear, quaking, and trembling, so too here,</b> in every generation, Torah must be studied with a sense of <b>reverence, fear, quaking, and trembling.</b>",

The reason for this distinction is that the cases of severe impurity are caused by ailment or other circumstances beyond his control and, as a result, they do not necessarily preclude a sense of reverence and awe as he studies Torah. This, however, is not the case with regard to impurity resulting from a seminal emission, which usually comes about due to frivolity and a lack of reverence and awe. Therefore, it is inappropriate for one who experiences a seminal emission to engage in matters of in Torah.",

            "The Gemara explains the rationale behind the two versions of this incident. <b>The</b> Sage <b>who taught</b> that ben Azzai <b>taught</b> the law openly in the market held that the leniency was <b>due to</b> concern that the <i>halakhot</i> requiring ritual immersion would promote <b>dereliction</b> in the study <b>of Torah.</b> The ruling of Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira eases the way for an individual who experienced a seminal emission to study Torah. This was <b>also due to</b> concern that the <i>halakhot</i> requiring ritual immersion would promote <b>the suspension of procreation,</b> as one might abstain from marital relations to avoid the immersion required thereafter. <b>And the</b> Sage, <b>who taught</b> that ben Azzai only <b>whispered</b> this <i>halakha</i> to his students, held that he did so <b>in order that Torah scholars would not be with their wives like roosters.</b> If the purification process was that simple, Torah scholars would engage in sexual activity constantly, which would distract them from their studies.",
            "With regard to this ritual immersion, <b>Rabbi Yannai said: I heard that there are those who are lenient with regard to it and I have heard that there are those who are stringent with regard to it.</b> The <i>halakha</i> in this matter was never conclusively established <b>and anyone who</b> accepts <b>upon himself to be stringent with regard to it, they prolong for him his days and years.</b>",
            "The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: What is the essence of those who immerse themselves in the morning?</b> The Gemara retorts: How can one ask <b>what is their essence? Isn’t he</b> the one <b>who said</b> that <b>one who experiences a seminal emission is prohibited from</b> engaging in <b>matters of Torah</b> and is required to immerse himself in the morning? Rather, <b>this is</b> what <b>he</b> meant to <b>say: What is the essence of</b> immersion in a ritual bath of <b>forty <i>se’a</i></b> of water when <b>it is possible</b> to purify oneself <b>with nine <i>kav</i>?</b> Furthermore, <b>what is the essence of immersion</b> when <b>it is</b> also <b>possible</b> to purify oneself by <b>pouring</b> water?",
            "Regarding this, <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: They established a massive fence</b> protecting one from sinning with their decree that one must immerse himself in forty <i>se’a</i> of water. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident involving one who solicited a woman to</b> commit <b>a sinful act. She said to him: Good-for-nothing. Do you have forty <i>se’a</i> in which to immerse</b> and purify <b>yourself</b> afterwards? He <b>immediately desisted.</b> The obligation to immerse oneself caused individuals to refrain from transgression.",
            "<b>Rav Huna said to the Sages: Gentlemen, why do you disdain this immersion? If it is because</b> it is difficult for you to immerse in the <b>cold</b> waters of the ritual bath, <b>it is possible</b> to purify oneself by immersing oneself in the heated <b>bathhouses,</b> which are unfit for immersion for other forms of ritual impurity but are fit for immersion in this case.",
            "<b>Rabbi Ḥisda said to him: Is there ritual immersion in hot water?</b> Rav Huna <b>said to him:</b> Indeed, doubts with regard to the fitness of baths have been raised, and <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava holds in accordance with your</b> opinion. Nevertheless, I remain convinced that it is permitted.",
            "The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Zeira was sitting in a tub of water in the bathhouse. He said to his attendant: Go and get nine <i>kav</i></b> of water <b>and pour</b> it <b>over me</b> so that I may purify myself from the impurity caused by a seminal emission. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said to him: Why does my master</b> require <b>all of this? Aren’t you seated in</b> at least nine <i>kav</i> of water in the tub. <b>He said to him:</b> The law of nine <i>kav</i> <b>parallels</b> the law of <b>forty <i>se’a</i>,</b> in that their <i>halakhot</i> are exclusive. <b>Just as forty <i>se’a</i></b> can only purify an individual through <b>immersion and not through pouring, so too nine <i>kav</i></b> can only purify one who experienced a seminal emission <b>through pouring and not through immersion.</b>",
            "The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Naḥman prepared a jug</b> with a capacity <b>of nine <i>kav</i></b> so that his students could pour water over themselves and become pure. <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said: Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yehuda Gelostera said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> that one who experienced a seminal emission can be purified by pouring nine <i>kav</i> <b>was only taught for a sick person</b> who experienced the emission <b>involuntarily. However, a sick person</b> who experienced a <b>normal</b> seminal emission in the course of marital relations, is required to immerse himself in <b>forty <i>se’a</i>.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Yosef said:</b> In that case, <b>Rav Naḥman’s jug is broken,</b> meaning it is no longer of any use, as few people fall into the category of sick people who experienced seminal emissions.

            "Up to now, discussion has focused on various problems pertaining to the laws of immersion as they concern one whose impurity is due to seminal emission. The Gemara asks: <b>Since all</b> of the <b><i>amora’im</i> and <i>tanna’im</i> disagree with regard to</b> the decree of <b>Ezra, let us examine how Ezra instituted</b> this ordinance, as this is not an uncommon circumstance and we can see how they conducted themselves.",

            "<b>It was taught in another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who was standing in prayer and he saw feces before him must walk forward until he has placed it four cubits behind him.</b> The Gemara challenges this: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> that it is sufficient if he distances himself four cubits <b>to the side?</b> The Gemara resolves this contradiction: <b>This is not difficult,</b> as <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> which taught that it must be four cubits behind him, is referring to a case <b>where it is possible</b> for him to advance that distance, <b>while that</b> <i>baraita</i> which taught that he may distance himself four cubits to the side, is referring to a case <b>where it is not possible</b> to advance four cubits, in which case he must at least step to the side.",
            "The Gemara cites another <i>halakha</i>: <b>One who was praying and</b> later <b>found feces in the place</b> where he prayed, <b>Rabba said: Although he committed a transgression</b> in his failure to examine that venue to determine if it was worthy of prayer (<i>Tosafot</i>), <b>his prayer is a</b> valid <b>prayer</b> and he fulfilled his obligation. <b>Rava strongly objects to his</b> statement: <b>Isn’t</b> it stated: <b>“The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination,</b> the more so as he offers it in depravity” (Proverbs 21:27), from which we derive that a mitzva performed inappropriately is no mitzva at all?

            "The Gemara <b>raised an objection</b> based on the second part of the <i>baraita</i>, where it was taught: <b>Matters which I permitted you</b> to do <b>here, I prohibited you</b> from doing <b>there.</b> In other words, there are matters that were permitted in a regular bathroom and not in a makeshift bathroom. <b>What, is it not</b> referring to <b>phylacteries? Granted, if you say</b> that the prohibition against urinating while wearing phylacteries is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel,</b> then we would understand the <i>baraita</i> as follows: Matters which <b>I permitted you</b> to do <b>here,</b> to hold phylacteries in a regular bathroom, <b>I have prohibited you</b> from doing <b>there,</b> in the <b>makeshift bathroom. But if you hold</b> that this <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai, they did not permit anything</b> in a regular bathroom. What, then, is the meaning of matters which I permitted you to do here?",
            "This challenge is rejected by the Gemara, which explains: <b>When that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught</b> it was not in reference to phylacteries, but <b>with regard to the matter of one handbreadth and two handbreadths.</b> As is <b>it was taught in one</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>When one relieves himself, he</b> must maintain modesty and <b>bare a single handbreadth</b> of his flesh <b>behind him and two handbreadths before him. And it was taught in another</b> <i>baraita</i>: One may only bare <b>a single handbreadth behind him and nothing before him.</b>",
            "<b>What, are not</b> both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> one referring to <b>a male, and</b> the apparent contradiction between the two <i>baraitot</i> <b>is not difficult,</b> as <b>here</b> the <i>baraita</i> that states that one may bare a handbreadth behind him and nothing before him is referring to <b>defecation, while here,</b> the other <i>baraita</i> that states that one may bare a handbreadth behind him and two handbreadths before him is referring to <b>urination.</b> Accordingly, despite the fact that one may bare two handbreadths before him when urinating in a makeshift bathroom, matters that I have permitted you to do here, one may bare nothing before him when defecating in an established bathroom, I have prohibited you from doing there.",
            "The Gemara rejects this explanation: <b>And how can you understand</b> it that way? <b>If</b> that <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>urination, why do I </b>need<b> to</b> bare <b>one handbreadth behind him? Rather,</b> both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are referring to <b>defecation, and</b> the apparent contradiction between the two <i>baraitot</i> is<b> not difficult.

",
            "The Gemara challenges this: <b>If so, then that which is taught with regard to</b> this <i>halakha</i> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>This is an <i>a fortiori</i> </b>inference<b> for which there is no refutation,</b> meaning that even though logically it would seem correct to be stricter in the case of defecating in a regular bathroom than in the case of urinating in a makeshift bathroom, that is not the ruling, is difficult. According to the distinction suggested above, <b>what</b> is the meaning of: <b>for which there is no refutation? That is the nature of the matter;</b> men and women need to uncover themselves differently.",
            "<b>Rather, </b>is it <b>not</b> so that the <i>baraita</i> that states: Matters which I permitted you to do here, I prohibited you from doing there, is referring to <b>phylacteries,</b> and the <i>a fortiori</i> inference that cannot be refuted is similarly referring to phylacteries. <b>And the refutation of</b> that which <b>Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet </b>says, that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Beit Shammai, is indeed <b>a conclusive refutation. </b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Nevertheless, it</b> remains <b>difficult: Now,</b> holding phylacteries in his hand when he defecates in a <b>regular bathroom is permitted, all the more so</b> that it is permitted when he urinates in <b>a makeshift bathroom.</b>",
            "The Gemara explains: <b>It says as follows:</b> When defecating in <b>a regular bathroom, where</b> one sits <b>there are no drops</b> of urine on one’s clothes or shoes, he need not dirty his hands to clean his garment, and therefore one is <b>permitted</b> to hold phylacteries in his hand. However, in <b>a makeshift bathroom, where</b> one stands, and <b>there are</b> ricocheting <b>drops</b> which he may touch with his hand, <b>it is prohibited.</b>",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>If so, then why</b> was it referred to as an <i>a fortiori</i> inference that <b>“cannot be refuted”?</b> This seems <b>an excellent refutation</b> that explains the distinction.",
            "The Gemara explains that <b>it says as follows: Derive this matter based on the reason</b> mentioned above that due to different circumstances the ruling is different. <b>Do not derive it by means of an <i>a fortiori</i> inference, as</b> if you were <b>to derive it by means of an <i>a fortiori</i> inference, it would</b> certainly <b>be an <i>a fortiori</i> inference that cannot be rebutted.</b>",

That way he spares himself the unpleasantness of being forced to leave in the middle of the meal.",
            "On this same subject, <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: One who partakes of a regular meal removes his phylacteries and then enters,</b> as it is inappropriate to partake in a meal where there is frivolity while wearing phylacteries. <b>And</b> this statement <b>disputes</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Ḥiyya, as Rabbi Ḥiyya said:</b> During a formal meal <b>one places</b> his phylacteries <b>on his table, and it is admirable for him</b> to do <b>so</b> in order that they will be available to don immediately if he so desires.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And until when</b> in the meal must he refrain from wearing phylacteries? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Until the time of the recitation of the blessing</b> of Grace after Meals.",

However, if <b>he bundled</b> phylacteries <b>in it, if he designated</b> the cloth for that particular use, <b>it is prohibited</b> to bundle money in it, but <b>if he did not designate it, no,</b> it is not prohibited.",
            "<b>Rav Yosef, son of Rav Neḥunya, raised a dilemma before Rav Yehuda: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i>; may <b>a man place his phylacteries</b> in his bed, <b>under his head</b> while he sleeps?

            "<b>Rather, what</b> is the alternative?

            "Practically speaking, this means that, according to Rabbi Yehuda, it is permissible to recite the morning prayer until the end of the fourth hour. In support of this <b>Rav Naḥman said: We, too, learned</b> this in a mishna:",
            "<b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava testified</b> about <b>five matters of</b> <i>halakha</i>: <br>When an orphan girl, who was married off by her mother or brother before reaching the age of majority, reaches the age of majority, she may refuse to continue living with her husband and thereby retroactively annul their marriage. Normally, marriage refusals are discouraged. However, in specific instances where it is clear that if the marriage were to remain in effect it would engender problems related to levirate marriage and <i>ḥalitza</i>, Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava testified that <b>one may persuade the minor girl to refuse</b> to continue living with her husband, thereby resolving the complications involved in this case.<br><b>And</b> he testified <b>that one may</b> allow <b>a woman</b> who, after hearing of her husband’s death, seeks to remarry, <b>to marry based on</b> the testimony of <b>one witness,</b> as opposed to the two witnesses required for other testimonies of the Torah. <br><b>And</b> he testified <b>about a rooster that was stoned</b> to death <b>in Jerusalem for killing a person,</b> in order to teach that the Torah law (Exodus 21:28) which requires the stoning of an ox that killed a person, applies to other animals as well. <br><b>And</b> he testified <b>about forty-day-old wine that was</b> used for <b>libation on the altar.</b> <br><b>And</b> he testified <b>about</b> the <b>daily morning offering that was sacrificed at four hours</b> of the day.",

            "<b>And about</b> the <b>daily morning offering that was sacrificed at four hours.</b> Based on this, the Gemara attempts to identify <b>the <i>tanna</i> who taught that which we learned</b> in the mishna about the manna that fell for the children of Israel in the desert: “And they gathered it morning by morning, each according to what he eats, <b>and when the sun grew hot it melted”</b> (Exodus 16:21); that took place <b>four hours</b> into the day.",
            "The <i>baraita </i>continues: Do <b>you say</b> that the time when the sun grew hot was <b>at four hours, or</b> perhaps <b>it was only at six hours</b> of the day? <b>When</b> the verse <b>says: “In the heat of the day”</b> (Genesis 18:1), <b>six hours is</b> already <b>mentioned</b> in the Torah as the heat of the day. <b>How, then, do I establish</b> the verse: <b>“And when the sun grew hot it melted”?</b> This must refer to an earlier time, <b>at four hours.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> of this mishna?

            "The Gemara responds: <b>That was an error,</b> as Rav Dimi did not intend to begin Shabbat early. It was a cloudy day and he mistakenly thought that the sun had set and that was why he prayed. Consequently, even though he prayed, the Shabbat prayer did not obligate him to conduct himself in accordance with the sanctity of Shabbat and he was allowed to perform labor even after his prayer.",

            "Establishing a different indicator to determine when he has bowed sufficiently, <b>Ulla said:</b> Until <b>he can see a small coin [<i>issar</i>],</b> on the ground before him <b>opposite his heart</b> (Rav Hai Gaon). <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said:</b> There is room for leniency; <b>once he moves his head</b> forward, <b>he need not</b> bow any further. <b>Rava said: But that</b> applies only if <b>he is exerting himself</b> when doing so, <b>and he appears like one who is bowing.</b> However, if he is able, he should bow further.",

            "<b>Rabbi Levi said: According to Rabbi Hillel, son of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani,</b> who said that the eighteen blessings correspond to the eighteen mentions of God’s name that King David said in the psalm, the nineteenth blessing <b>corresponds to</b> a reference to God in that psalm, where a name other than the tetragrammaton was used: <b>“The God of glory thunders” (</b>Psalms 29:3). <b>According to Rav Yosef,</b> who said that the eighteen blessings correspond to the eighteen mentions of God’s name in <i>Shema</i>, the additional blessing <b>corresponds to</b> the word <b>one that is in <i>Shema</i>.</b> Although it is not the tetragrammaton, it expresses the essence of faith in God. <b>According to</b> what <b>Rabbi Tanḥum</b> said that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said,</b> that the eighteen blessings correspond to the eighteen vertebrae in the spine, the additional blessing <b>corresponds to the small vertebra that is</b> at the bottom <b>of the spine.</b>",

            "The Gemara answers: The case of <b>Shmuel HaKatan is different, as he began</b> reciting the blessing of the heretics and while reciting it he became confused and forgot the end of the blessing.

            "The Gemara points out that both Rav Huna and Rav Ḥisda based their positions on the prayers of Moses. <b>The one who said: So that his mind will be in a pleading</b> mode <b>[<i>titḥonen</i>], as it is written: “And I pleaded [<i>va’etḥanan</i>] before the Lord”</b> (Deuteronomy 3:23). <b>And the one who said: So that his mind will be in a beseeching</b> mode <b>[<i>titḥolel</i>] as it is written: “And Moses besought [<i>vayeḥal</i>] the Lord”</b> (Exodus 32:11).",
            "The Gemara resumes the above discussion with regard to omission of the mention of the New Moon in the <i>Amida</i> prayer. <b>Rav Anan said</b> that <b>Rav said: One who erred and did not mention the New Moon in the evening prayer, we do not require him to return</b> to the beginning of the prayer and repeat it, <b>because the court only sanctifies the new month by day,</b> and the prayer of the New Moon, which parallels the court’s sanctification of the new month, belongs in the daytime prayer.",
            "<b>Ameimar said: Rav’s statement is reasonable in a full month,</b> i.e., a month in which there are two potential days of the New Moon, the thirtieth day of the previous month and the first day of the new month. If one neglected to mention the New Moon on the night of the thirtieth, we do not require him to return to the beginning of the prayer and repeat it, because he can mention it the next night, which is the night of the first of the new month, which is the primary day of the New Moon. <b>But in a short month</b> of twenty-nine days, followed by one day of the New Moon, <b>we require him to return</b> to the beginning of the prayer and repeat it, even in the evening prayer.",
            "<b>Rav Ashi said to Ameimar: Since Rav states a reason</b> for his statement, <b>what</b> difference <b>is</b> there <b>to me</b> if the month is <b>short, and what</b> difference <b>is</b> there <b>to me</b> if it is <b>full? Rather, there is no difference.</b> Rav based his opinion on the parallel drawn between the sanctification of the month and the mention of the New Moon in the <i>Amida</i> prayer; the sanctification of the month is not relevant at night.",

            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One</b> may <b>only stand</b> and begin to pray <b>from</b> an approach of <b>gravity</b> and submission. There is a tradition that <b>the early</b> generations of <b>pious</b> men <b>would wait one hour,</b> in order to reach the solemn frame of mind appropriate for prayer, <b>and</b> then <b>pray, so that they would focus their hearts toward their Father in Heaven.</b> Standing in prayer is standing before God and, as such, <b>even</b> if <b>the king greets him, he should not respond to him; and even if a snake is wrapped on his heel, he should not interrupt</b> his prayer.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> We learned in the mishna that prayer should be undertaken in an atmosphere of gravity. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? Rabbi Elazar said: They are derived from the verses describing the prayer of Hannah, mother of Samuel, <b>as the verse states: “And she felt bitterness of soul,</b> and she prayed to the Lord and she wept and wept” (I Samuel 1:10).",
            "The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>From what</b> does that conclusion ensue? <b>Perhaps Hannah is different, as</b> her <b>heart was extremely embittered,</b> her prayer was embittered as well. This does not prove that everyone must pray in that frame of mind.",
            "<b>Rather, Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said,</b> it can be proved <b>from here,</b> as David said: <b>“But as for me, by Your abundant loving-kindness I will enter Your house, at Your Holy Temple I will bow in reverence for You”</b> (Psalms 5:8). Entering into prayer like entering the Holy Temple must be performed reverentially.",
            "The Gemara rejects this proof as well: <b>From what</b> does that conclusion ensue? <b>Perhaps David is different, as he would excessively afflict himself in prayer</b> in order to atone for his transgression with Bathsheba. Consequently, his cannot serve as a paradigm for proper conduct in prayer. <b>Rather, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said,</b> it can be derived <b>from here,</b> from this verse that David said, not about his own worship, but about worship of God in general: “Give, unto the Lord, the honor of His name, <b>bow to the Lord in the beauty of holiness [<i>behadrat kodesh</i>]”</b> (Psalms 29:2). <b>Do not read: In the beauty of [<i>behadrat</i>]</b> holiness. <b>Rather</b> read: <b>In trembling of [<i>beḥerdat</i>]</b> holiness; one must enter into prayer from an atmosphere of gravity engendered by sanctity.",
            "The Gemara rejects this too: <b>From what</b> does that conclusion ensue? <b>Perhaps, actually I would say to you</b> that it should be read as it is written: <b>Specifically, “in the beauty,”</b> and it means that one should pray in beautiful clothing, <b>as</b> in the case <b>of Rav Yehuda who would adorn himself and then pray.</b> Rav Yehuda believed that one who comes before the King must wear his most beautiful clothing. The Gemara has yet to find a source for the <i>halakha</i> that one must approach prayer from an atmosphere of gravity. <b>Rather, Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> it can be derived <b>from here,</b> from this verse: <b>“Serve the Lord in fear and rejoice with trembling”</b> (Psalms 2:11).",
            "Having cited this verse from Psalms, the Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>rejoice with trembling? Rav Adda bar Mattana said</b> that <b>Rabba said:</b> One may not experience unbridled joy; even <b>where there is rejoicing, there should be trembling.</b>",

            "In a similar vein, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: One is forbidden to fill his mouth with mirth in this world,</b> as long as we are in exile (<i>ge’onim</i>), <b>as it is stated:</b> “When the Lord returns the captivity of Zion we will be as dreamers” (Psalms 126:1).

            "We learned in the mishna that it is appropriate to stand and begin to pray from an atmosphere of gravity.

            "<b>And</b> the Gemara asks: <b>What is an example</b> of a <b>conclusive <i>halakha</i>?</b>",
            "The Gemara offers several examples: <b>Abaye said:</b> One <b>like this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>of Rabbi Zeira,</b> as <b>Rabbi Zeira said: The daughters of Israel were stringent with themselves;</b> to the extent <b>that even if they see a drop of blood corresponding to</b> the size of <b>a mustard</b> seed <b>she sits seven clean</b> days <b>for it.</b> By Torah law, a woman who witnesses the emission of blood during the eleven days following her fixed menstrual period is not considered a menstruating woman; rather she immerses herself and is purified the next day. However, the women of Israel accepted the stringency upon themselves that if they see any blood whatsoever, they act as it if were the blood of a <i>zava</i>, which obligates her to count seven more clean days before becoming ritually pure (see Leviticus 15:25).",
            "Citing an additional example of a conclusive <i>halakha</i>, <b>Rava said:</b> One <b>like this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>of Rav Hoshaya, as Rav Hoshaya said: A person may employ artifice</b> to circumvent obligations incumbent <b>upon</b> him in dealing with <b>his grain and bring it into</b> the courtyard <b>in its chaff so that his animal will eat</b> from it, <b>and</b> the grain <b>is exempt</b> from <b>tithes.</b> <i>Halakha</i> dictates that one is obligated to tithe grain that has been threshed and piled, regardless of the ultimate purpose for which the grain was intended. By Torah law, one is exempt from tithing grain that was not threshed and is therefore still in its chaff. By rabbinic law, one is prohibited from eating this grain in the framework of a meal. Feeding animals is permitted without first tithing that grain.",
            "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead yet another example of a conclusive <i>halakha</i>, which is the recommended prelude to prayer.

In so doing, <b>one misuses</b> property consecrated to the Temple, and as in any other case of misusing Temple property, if he did so unwittingly, he is liable to bring a guilt-offering.",
            "It is related that <b>the Sages acted in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>our mishna</b> and rose to pray from an atmosphere of gravity; <b>Rav Ashi acted in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the <i>baraita</i></b> and preceded his prayer with a conclusive <i>halakha</i>.",
            "On the topic of proper preparation for prayer, <b>the Sages taught: One may neither stand to pray from</b> an atmosphere of <b>sorrow nor from</b> an atmosphere of <b>laziness, nor from</b> an atmosphere of <b>laughter, nor from</b> an atmosphere of <b>conversation, nor from</b> an atmosphere of <b>frivolity, nor from</b> an atmosphere of <b>purposeless matters.

            "With regard to one’s intent during prayer, <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: This was the custom of Rabbi Akiva, when he would pray with the congregation he would shorten</b> his prayer <b>and go up, due to</b> his desire to avoid being an <b>encumbrance on the congregation</b> by making them wait for him to finish his prayer. <b>But when he prayed by himself</b> he would extend his prayers to an extent that <b>a person would leave</b> Rabbi Akiva alone <b>in one corner</b> of the study hall <b>and</b> later <b>find him</b> still praying <b>in another corner.

            "Many <i>halakhot</i> are derived from evoking the prayers of biblical characters. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: One should always pray in a house with windows, as it is stated</b> regarding Daniel: “And when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went to his house. In his attic <b>there were open windows</b> facing Jerusalem, and three times a day he knelt upon his knees and prayed and gave thanks before his God, just as he had done before” (Daniel 6:11).",
            "In the <i>Tosefta</i>, additional <i>halakhot</i> were derived from Daniel’s prayer. I <b>might have</b> thought <b>that one could pray</b> as many times as he wishes <b>throughout the entire day; it has already been articulated by Daniel,</b> with regard to whom it is stated: <b>“And three times</b> a day he knelt upon his knees and prayed.” This teaches that there are fixed prayers.",
            "<b>I might have thought that this</b> practice of fixed prayer <b>began</b> only <b>when he came to</b> the Babylonian <b>exile; it was stated:</b> “Just <b>as he had done before.”</b>",

            "Daniel does not describe how these three prayers are distributed during the day.

            "Furthermore, <b>I might have</b> thought <b>that one may make his voice heard in his</b> <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer; it has already been articulated by Hannah</b> in her prayer, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And Hannah spoke in her heart, only her lips moved <b>and her voice could not be heard”</b> (I Samuel 1:13).",
            "<i>Halakhot</i> regarding the order of the prayers were also learned from the prayers of biblical characters.

In this verse, <b>song is prayer</b> in the sense of thanks and praise, and <b>prayer is</b> one’s <b>request</b> of his personal needs. Therefore, one who is praying <b>does not speak matters of request after</b> he began to recite <b><i>emet veyatziv</i></b> prior to the <i>Amida</i> prayer, which is the essence of prayer. Rather, he begins with praise in the first three blessings of the <i>Amida</i> prayer, and only thereafter does he include requests for his needs. <b>But after the</b> <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer</b> there is no limit. If he desires to recite <b>even the equivalent of the order of the confession of Yom Kippur,</b> he may <b>recite</b> it.",
            "This <b>was also stated</b> by an <i>amora</i>; <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said</b> that <b>Rav said: Although</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>one requests his</b> personal <b>needs in</b> the blessing: <b>Who listens to prayer,</b> that is with regard to one who wishes to do so as part of the <i>Amida</i> prayer. <b>If he comes</b> to add <b>and recite</b> additional requests <b>after</b> completing <b>his</b> <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer, even</b> if his personal requests are <b>the equivalent of the order of the confession of Yom Kippur,</b> he may <b>recite</b> them.",

Regarding the words: “No, my master,” <b>Ulla, and some say Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said</b> that <b>she said to him,</b> in an allusion: <b>With regard to this matter, you are not a master, and the Divine Spirit does not rest upon you, as you</b> falsely <b>suspect me of this.</b>",

            "With regard to Hannah’s explanation that <b>“I have drunk neither wine nor liquor,” Rabbi Elazar said: From here</b> the <i>halakha</i> is derived <b>that one who is suspected of something of which he is not</b> guilty cannot suffice merely with the personal knowledge of his innocence, but <b>must inform</b> the one who suspects him that he is innocent and clear himself of suspicion.",
            "<b>“Do not take your maidservant as a wicked woman [<i>bat beliya’al</i>]</b> for out of the abundance of my complaint and anger have I spoken until now” (I Samuel 1:16). <b>Rabbi Elazar said: From here</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>that when a drunk person prays it is as if he engaged in idol worship</b> is derived as <b>it is written here</b> that Hannah, suspected of praying while drunk, defends herself and says: “Do not take your maidservant <b>as a <i>bat beliya’al</i>”;</b> and <b>it is written there,</b> with regard to a city that has been instigated to engage in idol worship: <b>“<i>Benei beliya’al</i> have gone out from your midst</b> and have lured the inhabitants of their city, saying let us go and serve other gods which we have not known” (Deuteronomy 13:14). By means of this verbal analogy it is derived: <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of the idolatrous city, the term <i>beliya’al</i> indicates <b>idol worship, so too here,</b> in the case of one who prays drunk, <i>beliya’al</i> indicates <b>idol worship.</b>",
            "The verse continues: <b>“And Eli answered and said: May you go in peace”</b> (I Samuel 1:17). <b>Rabbi Elazar said: From here</b> the <i>halakha</i> is derived <b>that one who suspects another of something that he has not</b> done, <b>he must appease him.

            "As for the double language in the verse, <b>“if you will look upon [<i>im ra’o tireh</i>],” Rabbi Elazar said: Hannah said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, if You will look upon [<i>ra’o</i></b>] me now, <b>fine, and if not,</b> in any case <b>You will see</b> [<b><i>tireh</i></b>].",
            "What was Hannah threatening? She said: <b>I will go and seclude myself</b> with another man <b>before Elkana, my husband.

            "In the oath/prayer uttered by Hannah, she refers to herself as “Your servant” [<i>amatekha</i>] three times: <b>“The affliction of Your maidservant…</b>and <b>not forget Your maidservant and will give Your maidservant”</b> (I Samuel 1:11).",
            "<b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: Why</b> are <b>these three maidservants [<i>amatot</i>]</b> cited in the verse?

            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>“an offspring of men”?

            "The Gemara relates: <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said</b> in explanation: Hannah prayed that her son would not be conspicuous among men; <b>neither too tall nor too short; neither too small nor too fat; neither too white nor too red; neither too smart nor too stupid.</b>",
            "When Hannah came to the Temple with her son Samuel, she told Eli: “My lord, as your soul lives, my lord, <b>I am the woman who stood here with you</b> to pray to the Lord” (I Samuel 1:26). <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: From here</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>that it is forbidden to sit within four cubits of</b> one who is <b>praying</b> is derived.

            "Additionally, Hannah’s emphasis in speaking to Eli, <b>“for this youth I prayed”</b> (I Samuel 1:27), indicates that she came to protect him from danger. As <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Samuel was</b> one who <b>taught <i>halakha</i> in the presence of his teacher.</b> Hannah wanted to pray that he not be punished by death at the hand of Heaven for his transgression, <b>as it is stated: “And they slaughtered the cow and they brought the youth to Eli”</b> (I Samuel 1:25). This verse is puzzling. <b>Because they slaughtered the cow,</b> therefore, <b>they brought the youth to Eli?</b> What does one have to do with the next?",
            "<b>Rather,</b> this is what happened: <b>Eli said to</b> those who brought the offering: <b>Call a priest; he will come and slaughter</b> the offering. <b>Samuel saw them looking for a priest to slaughter</b> the animal. <b>He said to them: Why do you</b> need <b>to look for a priest to slaughter</b> it? <b>Slaughter</b> of an offering performed <b>by a non-priest is valid.

            "The Gemara continues to deal with Hannah’s prayer. It is said: <b>“And Hannah spoke on her heart.”</b> Several interpretations are offered to explain her use of the phrase “on her heart” instead of the common phrase to her heart (Maharsha). <b>Rabbi Elazar said in the name of Rabbi Yosei ben Zimra:</b> Hannah spoke to God <b>concerning matters of her heart. She said before Him: Master of the Universe,</b> of <b>all</b> the organs <b>You created in a woman, You have not created one in vain.</b> Every organ fulfills its purpose; <b>eyes to see, ears to hear, a nose to smell, a mouth to speak, hands with which to perform labor, feet with which to walk, breasts with which to nurse.</b> If so, <b>these breasts that You placed upon my heart, to what</b> purpose did You place them?

            "Tangentially, the Gemara also cites an additional statement that <b>Rabbi Elazar said in the name of Rabbi Yosei ben Zimra: Anyone who sits</b> in observance of a <b>fast on Shabbat,</b> his merit is great and <b>they tear up</b> and repeal <b>his sentence of seventy years;</b> because everyone is enjoying himself and a feast is prepared, it is more difficult to fast on Shabbat than on any other day. <b>Nevertheless, they then hold him accountable</b> for failing to fulfill <b>the <i>halakha</i> of delight of Shabbat</b>.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is his remedy</b> to atone and avoid punishment? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: He must sit</b> in observance of another <b>fast</b> on a weekday to atone <b>for the fast</b> on Shabbat.",

            "The Gemara cites other statements in praise of prayer: <b>Rabbi Ḥanin said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Anyone who prolongs his prayer is</b> assured that <b>his prayer does not return unanswered;</b> it will surely be accepted. <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>From Moses our teacher, as it is stated</b> that Moses said: “So I fell down before the Lord the forty days and forty nights that I fell down; <b>and I prayed to the Lord”</b> (Deuteronomy 9:26–27), <b>and it is written thereafter: “And the Lord heard me that time as well,</b> the Lord would not destroy you” (Deuteronomy 10:10).",
            "The Gemara raises an objection: <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Anyone who prolongs his prayer and expects it to be answered, will ultimately come to heartache,</b> as it will not be answered. <b>As it is stated: “Hope deferred makes the heart sick”</b> (Proverbs 13:12). <b>And what is the remedy</b> for one afflicted with that illness? He should <b>engage in Torah</b> study, <b>as it is stated: “But desire fulfilled is the tree of life”</b> (Proverbs 13:12), <b>and tree of life is nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “It is a tree of life to those who hold fast to it,</b> and those who support it are joyous” (Proverbs 3:18). This is <b>not difficult. This,</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba’s statement that one will suffer heartache refers to one <b>who prolongs</b> his prayer <b>and expects it to be answered; that,</b> Rabbi Ḥanin’s statement that one who prolongs his prayer is praiseworthy refers to <b>one who prolongs his prayer and</b> does <b>not expect it to be answered.</b>",
            "On a similar note, <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: A person who prayed and saw that he was not answered</b> should <b>pray again, as it is stated: “Hope in the Lord, strengthen yourself, let your heart take courage, and hope in the Lord”</b> (Psalms 27:14). One should turn to God with hope, and if necessary turn to God again with hope.",
            "Connected to the emphasis on the need to bolster one’s effort in prayer, the Gemara notes that <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Four</b> things <b>require bolstering,</b> constant effort to improve, <b>and they are: Torah, good deeds, prayer, and occupation.</b>",
            "For each of these, a biblical proof is cited: <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>Torah and good deeds</b> require bolstering? <b>As it is stated</b> in the instruction to Joshua: <b>“Only be strong and be extremely courageous, observe and do all of the Torah</b> that Moses My servant commanded you; do not deviate to the right or to the left, that you may succeed wherever you go” (Joshua 1:7). In this verse, observe refers to Torah study and do refers to good deeds (Maharsha); the apparently repetitive language is not extraneous. The Gemara derives: <b>Be strong in Torah and be courageous in good deeds.</b>",
            "<b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>prayer</b> requires bolstering? <b>As it is said: “Hope in the Lord, strengthen yourself, let your heart take courage, and hope in the Lord.”</b>",

            "The Gemara cites a midrash on the following verse from Isaiah, relating to the sin of the Golden Calf and Moses’ supplication for forgiveness: <b>“But Zion said: The Lord has forsaken me and the Lord has forgotten me.</b> Can a woman forget her suckling baby, that she would not have compassion for the child of her womb? These may forget, but you I will not forget” (Isaiah 49:14–15). The Gemara seeks to clarify: <b>Forsaken is the same as forgotten.</b> They are synonymous; why repeat the same idea twice? <b>Reish Lakish said: The community of Israel said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe,</b> even when <b>a man marries</b> a second <b>wife after his first wife, he</b> certainly <b>recalls the deeds of his first</b> wife.

            "The verse goes on to say: <b>“Can a woman forget her suckling baby,</b> that she would not have compassion for the child of her womb?

            "The Gemara continues: <b>Doesn’t Rabbi Akiva dispute</b> his opinion? He holds that <i>havdala</i> is recited as an independent fourth blessing, in which case there is a dispute.",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>Is that to say that throughout the entire year we act in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> in this matter, <b>so that now,</b> on a Festival that occurs directly after Shabbat, <b>we will stand and act in accordance with</b> his opinion? <b>What is the reason that throughout the whole, entire year, we do not act in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva?

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> Our mishna cited three instances where the communal prayer leader is silenced. The Gemara clarifies: <b>Granted,</b> they silence one who repeats: <b>We give thanks, we give thanks, as it appears like</b> he is acknowledging and praying to <b>two authorities. And</b> granted that <b>they also silence</b> one who says: <b>May Your name be mentioned with the good,</b> as <b>clearly</b> he is thanking God only <b>for the good and not for the bad, and we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>One is required to bless</b> God <b>for the bad just as he blesses</b> Him <b>for the good. However,</b> in the case of one who recites: Just as <b>Your mercy is extended to a bird’s nest, why</b> do they silence him?",

            "The Gemara explains: <b>And Rabba too</b> held in accordance with this mishna but merely acted this way because <b>he wanted to hone Abaye’s</b> intellect. Rabba did not make his statement to praise the scholar, but simply to test his nephew, Abaye, and to encourage him to articulate what he knows about that mishna.",

Reciting a litany of praise does not enhance God’s honor.",
            "Tangentially, the Gemara cites an additional statement by Rabbi Ḥanina concerning principles of faith. <b>And Rabbi Ḥanina said: Everything is in the hands of Heaven, except for fear of Heaven.</b> Man has free will to serve God or not, <b>as it is stated: “And now Israel, what does the Lord your God ask of you other than to fear</b> the Lord your God, to walk in all of His ways, to love Him and to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul” (Deuteronomy 10:12). The Lord asks man to perform these matters because ultimately, the choice is in his hands.",

The Lord values and treasures fear of Heaven over all else.",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>Indeed, for Moses</b> fear of Heaven <b>is a minor matter.

However, one who is asked for just a <b>small</b> vessel and he does not have one, <b>it seems to him like a large vessel.</b> Therefore, Moses could say: What does the Lord your God ask of you other than to fear, because in his eyes it was a minor matter.",

            "The Gemara answers: <b>This is not difficult; this</b> case, where although it is reprehensible when one repeats <i>Shema</i>, they do not silence him, is referring to <b>one who recites and repeats each individual word</b> as he says it.

            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> This mishna and the next one deal with the communal prayer leader. <b>(If one says: “May the good bless You,” this is a path of heresy.)

            "In order to prevent the prayer leader from erring in his prayer, it was said that <b>one who passes before the ark should not respond amen after the</b> blessing of the <b>priests, because of</b> potential <b>confusion.</b> Since the mishna is describing a situation in which he was praying without a prayer book, responding amen would interrupt the order of the prayer and potentially lead him to begin a different blessing. For this reason, even <b>if there is no priest other than</b> the communal prayer leader, <b>he does not lift his hands</b> to bless the people, lest he become confused. <b>And,</b> however, <b>if he is certain that he can lift his hands and resume his prayer</b> without becoming confused, <b>he is permitted</b> to recite the blessing.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that one who replaces a communal prayer leader who erred in the middle of the <i>Amida</i> prayer should not refuse when approached. The Gemara cites the general <i>halakha</i> with regard to proper conduct when one is approached to serve as prayer leader. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One who is approached <b>to pass before the ark</b> to serve as prayer leader, for the sake of propriety <b>should refuse,</b> to avoid creating the impression that he is too eager. <b>And if he does not refuse,</b> but jumps at the opportunity, <b>he is like cooked food without salt,</b> which is to say that he acts in bad taste. <b>However, if he refuses too much</b> this is similarly inappropriate, as <b>he is like cooked food that was ruined by</b> too much <b>salt.</b> So <b>how should he act?</b> The appropriate conduct when approached to serve as communal prayer leader is as follows: When approached <b>the first time, one should refuse; the second</b> time, one should <b>vacillate</b> like a wick that has just begun to catch a flame but is not yet burning; and <b>the third</b> time, <b>he should stretch his legs and descend</b> before the ark.",
            "On this note, the Gemara cites that which <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There are <b>three</b> things that <b>are harmful in excess but are beneficial when used sparingly.</b> They are: <b>Leavening</b> in dough, <b>salt</b> in a cooked dish <b>and refusal</b> for the sake of propriety.",
            "The mishna states that when one replaces the communal prayer leader, he commences from the beginning of the blessing in which the former had erred. However that is not universally true, as <b>Rav Huna said:</b> One who <b>erred in</b> any of <b>the first three</b> blessings <b>he must return to the beginning</b> of the <i>Amida</i> prayer because the first three blessing comprise a single entity. Likewise, if one <b>erred in</b> any of <b>the</b> thirteen <b>middle</b> blessings, <b>he returns to</b> the blessing of: <b>You grace</b> humanity, the first of the middle blessings. If one erred <b>in</b> any of the three <b>final</b> blessings, <b>he must return to the</b> blessing of <b>Temple service,</b> which is the first of the final blessings.",

            "<b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: All the prophets only prophesied</b> with regard to the change in world order in the end of days <b>with regard to the days of the Messiah. However, with regard to the World-to-Come,</b> which exists on a higher level, it is stated: <b>“No eye has seen it, God, aside from You.”</b>",
            "<b>And</b> the Gemara notes that this statement <b>disagrees with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel, as Shmuel said: The only</b> difference <b>between this world and the days of the Messiah is</b> with regard to <b>servitude to</b> foreign <b>kingdoms alone.</b> While in the days of the Messiah, Israel will be independent and free from enslavement to foreign powers, the world order will remain otherwise unchanged, <b>as it is stated: “For the poor shall not cease from the land”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:11), which indicates that the ways of the world are set and unchanging.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: All of the prophets only prophesied</b> their prophecies of consolation <b>with regard to penitents but with regard to the full-fledged righteous</b> it is stated: <b>“No eye has seen it, God, aside from You.”</b>",
            "<b>And</b> the Gemara notes that <b>this</b> statement <b>disagrees with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Abbahu</b> who holds that penitents are superior to the righteous. <b>As Rabbi Abbahu said: In the place where penitents stand, even the full-fledged righteous do not stand, as it is stated: “Peace, peace upon him who is far and him who is near.”</b> Peace and greeting is extended first to <b>him who is far,</b> the penitent, <b>and</b> only <b>thereafter</b> is peace extended to <b>him who is near,</b> the full-fledged righteous.",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> could have <b>said to you: What is</b> the meaning of <b>him who is far?</b> This refers to the full-fledged righteous <b>who was distant from an act of transgression from the outset,</b> and to whom peace is extended first. <b>What is</b> meant by <b>him who is near?</b> This refers to the penitent <b>who was close to an act of transgression but has now distanced</b> himself <b>from it,</b> and to whom peace is extended only after it has been extended to him who has been righteous from the outset.",
            "Earlier, Rabbi Yoḥanan said that there is a reward referred to in the verse: “No eye has seen it.” The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> this reward about which it is said: <b>“No eye has seen it”? Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: That is the wine that has been preserved in its grapes since the six days of creation</b> and which no eye has ever seen. <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: That is Eden, which no creature’s eye has</b> ever <b>surveyed.</b>",
            "<b>Lest you will say: Where was Adam the first</b> man? Wasn’t he there and didn’t he survey Eden? The Gemara responds: Adam was only <b>in the Garden</b> of Eden, not in Eden itself.",
            "<b>And lest you will say: It is</b> the <b>Garden and it is Eden;</b> two names describing the same place. That is not the case, as <b>the verse states: “And a river went out from Eden to water the Garden”</b> (Genesis 2:10). Obviously, the <b>Garden</b> exists <b>on its own and Eden</b> exists <b>on its own.</b>",
            "Having mentioned Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa in our mishna, the Gemara proceeds to further praise the efficacy of his prayer: <b>The Sages taught:</b> There was <b>an incident where Rabban Gamliel’s son fell ill.</b> Rabban Gamliel <b>dispatched two scholars to Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa to pray for mercy</b> and healing <b>on his behalf. When</b> Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa <b>saw them</b> approaching, <b>he went up to the attic</b> on the roof of his house <b>and prayed for mercy on his behalf. Upon his descent, he said to</b> the messengers: You may <b>go</b> and return to Rabban Gamliel, <b>as the fever has already left</b> his son and he has been healed. The messengers <b>asked him:</b> How do you know? <b>Are you a prophet? He replied to them: I am neither a prophet nor son of a prophet</b> (see Amos 7:14), <b>but I have received</b> a tradition with regard to <b>this</b> indication: <b>If my prayer is fluent in my mouth</b> as I recite it and there are no errors, <b>I know that</b> my prayer <b>is accepted. And if not, I know that</b> my prayer <b>is rejected.</b> The Gemara relates that these messengers <b>sat and wrote and approximated that</b> precise <b>moment</b> when Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa told them this. <b>When they came before Rabban Gamliel</b> and related all that had happened and showed him what they had written, Rabban Gamliel <b>said to them:</b> I swear <b>by the Temple service</b> that in the time you wrote <b>you were neither earlier or later; rather, this is how the event</b> transpired: Precisely at that moment <b>his fever broke and he asked us for water to drink.</b>",
            "<b>And</b> there was <b>another incident</b> involving <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa, who went to study Torah before Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakkai, and Rabbi Yoḥanan’s son fell ill. He said to him: Ḥanina, my son, pray for mercy on behalf of</b> my son <b>so that he will live. Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa placed his head between his knees</b> in order to meditate <b>and prayed for mercy upon his behalf, and</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakkai’s son <b>lived.

His wife said to him: And is Ḥanina greater than you? He replied to her: No, but</b> his prayer is better received than my own because <b>he is like a servant before the King,</b> and as such he is able to enter before the King and make various requests at all times. <b>I,</b> on the other hand, <b>am like a minister before the King,</b> and I can enter only when invited and can make requests only with regard to especially significant matters.",
            "<b>And</b> on the topic of prayer, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One may only pray in a house with windows,</b> as then he can see the heavens and focus his heart, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to Daniel’s prayer: “In his attic <b>there were open windows</b> facing Jerusalem” (Daniel 6:11).",
            "With regard to the appropriate place to pray, <b>Rav Kahana said: I consider impudent one who prays in a field.</b>",
            "Employing parallel language, <b>Rav Kahana also said: I consider impudent one who specifies his transgression, as it is stated: “Happy is he whose iniquity is forgiven, whose transgression is covered over”</b> (Psalms 32:1); one who conceals his transgressions indicates that he is ashamed of them, and due to his shame he will be forgiven.",

            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> This mishna discusses the blessings recited over various foods. <b>How does one recite a blessing over fruits? Over</b> different <b>fruits</b> that grow on a <b>tree one recites: Who creates fruit of the tree, with the exception of wine.</b> Although wine is produced from fruit of the tree, due to its significance, its blessing differs from other fruits of the tree. <b>Over wine one recites: Who creates fruit of the vine. Over fruits</b> that grow from <b>the earth, one recites: Who creates fruit of the ground, with the exception of bread.</b> Bread, too, is significant and its blessing differs from other fruits of the ground, <b>as over bread one recites: Who brings forth bread from the earth. Over</b> herbs and leafy <b>vegetables one recites: Who creates fruit of the ground. Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that there is room to distinguish between fruits that grow from the earth, herbs, and leafy vegetables. Although they are all fruit of the ground, since they have different qualities, the blessing on the latter is: <b>Who creates various kinds of herbs.</b>",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> Concerning the fundamental basis for blessings, the Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> the obligation to recite a blessing before eating, derived? The Gemara answers: <b>As the Sages taught</b> in the <i>Sifra</i>: With regard to saplings, it is stated that in their fourth year their fruit will be: <b>“…sanctified for praises before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 19:24). This verse <b>teaches</b> that <b>they require</b> praise of God in the form of a <b>blessing</b> both <b>beforehand and thereafter,</b> as the verse says praises in the plural. <b>From here, Rabbi Akiva said: A person is forbidden to taste anything before he recites a blessing,</b> as without reciting praise over food, it has the status of a consecrated item, from which one is forbidden to derive pleasure.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> did <b>this</b> verse: <b>“Sanctified for praises,” come for that</b> purpose? <b>This</b> verse <b>is necessary</b> to derive other matters. <b>One</b> being <b>that the Merciful One said: Redeem it and then eat it.</b> This midrash interprets <i>hillul</i>, praise, as <i>ḥillul</i>, redemption. <b>And the other</b> matter derived from this verse is: <b>An object which</b> is offered upon the altar and <b>requires a song</b> of praise when it is offered, as is the case with the libation of wine, <b>requires redemption. And that which does not require a song</b> of praise, all other fruits, <b>does not require redemption. And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion that <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said, as Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: From where</b> is it derived that <b>one only recites a song</b> of praise in the Temple <b>over the</b> libation of <b>wine</b> on the altar? <b>As it is stated: “And the vine replied: Should I leave my wine, which gladdens God and man,</b> and go and wave above the trees?” (Judges 9:13). <b>If</b> wine <b>gladdens people, in what</b> way <b>does it gladden God?</b> Rather, derive <b>from here that one only recites a song</b> of praise <b>over wine,</b> as wine gladdens God when offered as part of the service in the Temple.In any case, other <i>halakhot</i> have been derived from this verse. From where, then, is the requirement to recite blessings derived?",
            "Indeed, <b>this</b> works out <b>well according to the one who taught,</b> as a rule: <b>A fourth-year sapling</b> in the <i>mishnayot</i> dealing with the prohibition to eat fruits produced during the first three years of a tree’s existence and the sanctity of the fruit produced in its fourth year; as, in his opinion, fourth-year fruits that grow on all trees must be redeemed. <b>However, according to the one who taught,</b> as a rule: <b>A fourth-year grapevine, what can be said?</b> Indeed, he derives the <i>halakha</i> that only wine that is accompanied by a song of praise requires redemption, from the interpretation of <i>hillul</i> as <i>ḥillul</i>. <b>As it was stated: Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>one taught</b> these <i>mishnayot</i> using the term: <b>A fourth-year grapevine, and one taught</b> using the term: <b>A fourth-year sapling.</b>",
            "<b>And according to the one who taught: A fourth year grapevine, this</b> works out <b>well if he derives</b> this matter <b>from a verbal analogy [<i>gezera shava</i>],</b> and therefore need not derive this <i>halakha</i> from the term <i>hillulim</i>. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: It is stated here</b> with regard to the laws of the prohibition of fruit for the tree’s first three years: “But in the fifth year you may eat its fruit, <b>so that it may increase your produce [<i>tevuato</i>];</b> I am the Lord your God” (Leviticus 19:25). <b>And it is stated below,</b> with regard to the laws of diverse kinds: “You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed, lest the growth of the seed that you have sown be forfeited <b>with the produce [<i>utevuat</i>] of the vineyard”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:9). Based on a verbal analogy, it can be derived: <b>Just as below,</b> with regard to the laws of diverse kinds, the produce is that which grows in <b>vineyards; so too, here,</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of the fruits of a sapling, the produce is that which grows in <b>vineyards.</b> Consequently, according to the one who holds this verbal analogy, <b>one extra <i>hillul</i></b> remains from which to derive <b>the blessing.</b> Since he derives that the laws of fourth-year saplings apply only to grapes from the verbal analogy, he can derive the requirement to recite blessings before partaking of food from the word <i>hillulim</i>.",
            "<b>And if he does not derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> by means of <b>a verbal analogy,</b> he must derive this <i>halakha</i> from the term <i>hillulim</i>, in which case, <b>from where does he derive</b> the mitzva <b>to recite a blessing</b> before partaking of food? <b>And even if he derives</b> this <i>halakha</i> by means of <b>a verbal analogy, we found</b> a source for the obligation to recite a blessing <b>after</b> eating, similar to the obligation stated in the verse: “And you will eat and be satisfied and then you shall bless.” However, <b>from where</b> is it derived that there is an obligation to recite a blessing <b>beforehand?</b> From one <i>hillul</i>, the fundamental <i>halakha</i> of redemption of fourth-year saplings is derived.",
            "The Gemara answers this: This is <b>not difficult, as it</b> may be <b>derived by means of an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: If when he is satiated,</b> after eating, <b>he</b> is obligated to <b>recite a blessing</b> over food, <b>when he is hungry,</b> before eating, <b>all the more so</b> that he is obligated to recite a blessing over food.",
            "The Gemara comments: In that way, <b>we found</b> a source for the obligation to recite a blessing over the produce of <b>vineyards,</b> but <b>from where</b> is it derived with regard to <b>other types of</b> produce?",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>It is derived</b> by means of the hermeneutic principle: What do we find, <b>from</b> the produce of a <b>vineyard: Just as</b> the fruit of the <b>vineyard is an item</b> from <b>which one derives benefit and it requires a blessing, so too, any item</b> from <b>which one derives benefit, requires a blessing.</b>",
            "The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>This</b> derivation <b>can be refuted,</b> as a vineyard is unique: <b>What</b> is unique about a <b>vineyard, that it is obligated in</b> the mitzva requiring to give <b>small, incomplete clusters of grapes [<i>olelot</i>]</b> to the poor? That is a stringency that does not apply to other fruits. Perhaps the blessing is also a stringency that applies only to grapes.",
            "The Gemara answers: In that case, <b>standing grain can prove</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of <i>olelot</i> is not a factor in the obligation to recite a blessing. One is obligated by Torah law to recite a blessing after eating bread, even though the <i>halakha</i> of <i>olelot</i> does not apply to grain. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>What</b> is unique about <b>ripe grain, that it is obligated in</b> the mitzva of separating <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> from the dough? That is a stringency that does not apply to other foods. Perhaps the blessing is also a stringency that applies only to grain.",
            "The Gemara responds: In that regard, <b>vineyards can prove</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of <i>ḥalla</i> is not a factor in the obligation to recite a blessing. In summary: <b>And the derivation has reverted</b> to its starting point. However, at this point the <i>halakha</i> is derived from a combination of the two sources: <b>The aspect of this is not like the aspect of that, and the aspect of that is not like the aspect of this; the common denominator is:</b> Both are <b>items</b> from <b>which one derives benefit and</b> each <b>requires a blessing.</b> A general principle may be derived: <b>So too, any item</b> from <b>which one derives benefit, requires a blessing.</b>",
            "Again, the Gemara objects: <b>What</b> is unique about <b>the common denominator</b> between grapes and grain that prevents utilizing it as a paradigm for other food items? Grapes and grain <b>have an aspect</b> of being offered upon the <b>altar,</b> and perhaps that is the reason that they require blessings. Based on that reasoning, although all other food items cannot be derived from the common denominator, <b>an olive may also be derived as it too has an aspect</b> of being offered upon the <b>altar,</b> as olive oil is one of the components of a meal offering.",
            "The Gemara questions this point: <b>Is an olive derived from</b> the fact that it <b>has an aspect</b> of being offered upon the <b>altar? Isn’t it written explicitly with regard to</b> the olive <b>listed</b> that the orchard in which it grows is called <b><i>kerem</i>; as it is written: “And burnt up from the shocks and the standing grain and the olive yards [<i>kerem zayit</i>]”</b> (Judges 15:5)? Just as the orchard in which grapes grow is called <i>kerem</i>, and grapes require a blessing, the olive also grows in a <i>kerem</i> and should require a blessing. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> Nevertheless, an analogy may not be drawn between the two; where the olive grows <b>is called <i>kerem zayit</i>, it is not called <i>kerem</i> unmodified,</b> which is a term reserved for grapevines.",
            "The Gemara returns to the issue at hand, noting that <b>in any case, it is difficult: What</b> is unique about <b>the common denominator</b> between grapes and grain? That they <b>possess an aspect</b> of being offered upon the <b>altar. Rather, it is derived from</b> the obligation to recite a blessing <b>upon the seven species.</b> After the verse speaks of the seven species, it states: “And you will eat and be satisfied and then you shall bless.” This is a paradigm for all other foods, that they too require a blessing: <b>Just as the seven species are items</b> from <b>which one derives benefit and require a blessing, any item</b> from <b>which one derives benefit, requires a blessing.</b>",
            "Again, the Gemara rejects this: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about the seven species? That one is obligated in</b> the mitzva <b>of first fruits.</b> However, other produce with regard to which one is not obligated in the mitzva of first fruits, from where is it derived that they require a blessing? <b>Furthermore,</b> even if the seven species can serve as a paradigm, <b>this</b> works out <b>well</b> with regard to the blessing <b>thereafter;</b> but <b>from where</b> is the obligation to recite a blessing <b>beforehand</b> derived?",
            "The Gemara responds to the question: This is <b>not difficult, as it</b> may be <b>derived by means of an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: If when he is satiated,</b> after eating, <b>he</b> is obligated to <b>recite a blessing</b> over food, <b>when he is hungry,</b> before eating, <b>all the more so</b> he is obligated to recite a blessing over food.",
            "In any case, this is not an absolute proof. Furthermore, even <b>according to the one who taught: A fourth-year sapling</b> in all the relevant <i>mishnayot</i>, <b>it</b> works out <b>well</b> with regard to <b>everything that can be planted,</b> that one is obligated to recite a blessing. However, with regard to <b>items that cannot be planted, such as meat, eggs, and fish, from where does he</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> that one is obligated to recite a blessing? <b>Rather,</b> all previous attempts at deriving this <i>halakha</i> are rejected. The fundamental obligation to recite a blessing over food is founded on <b>reason: One is forbidden to derive benefit from this world without a blessing.</b>",
            "<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>One is forbidden to derive benefit from this world,</b> which is the property of God, <b>without</b> reciting <b>a blessing</b> beforehand. <b>And anyone who derives benefit from this world without a blessing,</b> it is as if he is guilty of <b>misuse</b> of a consecrated object. The Gemara adds: <b>What is his remedy? He should go to a Sage.</b>",
            "The Gemara is puzzled: <b>He should go to a Sage; what will he do to him?</b> How can the Sage help after <b>he has already violated a prohibition? Rather, Rava said,</b> this is how it should be understood: <b>He should go to a Sage initially,</b> in his youth, <b>and</b> the Sage <b>will teach him blessings, so that he will not come to</b> be guilty of this type of <b>misuse</b> of a consecrated object in the future.",
            "Similarly, <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: One who derives benefit from this world without a blessing, it is as if he enjoyed objects consecrated to the heavens, as it is stated: “The earth and all it contains is the Lord’s,</b> the world and all those who live in it” (Psalms 24:1). Rabbi Levi expressed this concept differently. <b>Rabbi Levi raised a contradiction: It is written: “The earth and all it contains is the Lord’s,” and it is written</b> elsewhere: <b>“The heavens are the Lord’s and the earth He has given over to mankind”</b> (Psalms 115:16).

The phrase, <b>his father, refers to none other than God, as it is stated: “Is He not your Father Who created you,</b> Who made you and established you” (Deuteronomy 32:6). The phrase <b>his mother refers to none other than the community of Israel, as it is stated: “Hear, my son, the discipline of your father, and do not forsake the Torah of your mother”</b> (Proverbs 1:8).

Similarly, reciting a formula parallel to the blessing on wine: Who creates the fruit of the vine, is inappropriate as the grapes themselves are the fruit that was created, as opposed to oil which was not.",
            "The Gemara challenges: Nevertheless, it is still possible to formulate a blessing, <b>as we may recite the blessing: Who creates fruit of the olive tree,</b> which would be parallel to the blessing recited over wine. <b>Rather, Mar Zutra offered</b> a different rationale: The reason that no separate blessing was established over oil is because, as opposed to <b>wine</b> that <b>nourishes, oil does not nourish.</b>",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And oil does not nourish? Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: <b>One who vows that nourishment</b> is forbidden to him <b>is permitted</b> to eat <b>water and salt,</b> as they are not considered nourishment. <b>And we discussed this</b> <i>halakha</i>: By inference, <b>water and salt are not considered nourishment, but all</b> other edible <b>items are considered nourishment.</b>",
            "<b>Let us say that this is a conclusive refutation of Rav and Shmuel, who said: One only recites: Who creates various kinds of nourishment, over the five species</b> of grain <b>alone,</b> as they alone are considered nourishing. <b>And Rav Huna said</b> as a solution that this mishna referred to a case <b>where</b> he vows <b>and says: Anything that nourishes</b> is prohibited <b>to me.</b> That formula includes anything that is at all nourishing and therefore only water and salt are excluded. Olive oil is not excluded.",
            "<b>Apparently, oil nourishes. Rather,</b> there is another distinction between wine and oil: <b>Wine satisfies, oil does not satisfy.</b> Wine not only nourishes, but it is also filling. The Gemara asks: <b>And does wine satisfy? Wouldn’t Rava drink wine all</b> day on <b>the eve of Passover in order to stimulate his heart,</b> i.e., whet his appetite <b>so that he might eat more <i>matza</i></b> at the seder? Wine does not satisfy, it whets the appetite. The Gemara answers: <b>A lot</b> of wine <b>stimulates, a little satisfies.</b>",
            "Again, the Gemara asks: <b>Does</b> wine <b>satisfy at all? Isn’t it written: “Wine gladdens the heart of man,</b> making the face brighter than oil, <b>and bread fills man’s heart”</b> (Psalms 104:15); <b>bread is that which satisfies, wine does not satisfy. Rather,</b> this verse is not a proof; <b>wine has two</b> advantages, <b>it satisfies and gladdens. Bread,</b> however, <b>satisfies but does not gladden.</b>",
            "Since wine possesses all of these virtues, the Gemara asks: <b>If so, let us recite</b> the <b>three blessings</b> of Grace after Meals <b>over it</b> after drinking, just as we do after eating bread. The Gemara answers: <b>People do not base their meals on</b> wine.",
            "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said to Rava: If one based his meal on it, what is the</b> ruling? Must he recite the Grace after Meals as he does after bread? He replied: <b>When Elijah comes and says whether</b> or not <b>it can serve as the basis</b> for a meal, this will be resolved. <b>Nevertheless, now,</b> until then, <b>his intention is</b> rendered <b>irrelevant by</b> the opinions of <b>all other men</b> and he is not required to recite the complete Grace after Meals.",
            "Previously, the Gemara cited the <i>halakha</i> that one recites the blessing: Who creates fruit of the tree, over olive oil. The Gemara discusses <b>the matter itself.

Apparently, one who drinks oil derives no benefit and it even causes him damage.",
            "<b>Rather,</b> it is referring to a case where <b>he eats</b> the oil <b>by</b> dipping <b>bread</b> into it. <b>If so,</b> the <b>bread is primary and</b> the oil <b>secondary, and we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>This is the principle: Any</b> food <b>that is primary, and</b> is eaten <b>with</b> food that is <b>secondary, one recites a blessing over the primary</b> food, and that blessing <b>exempts the secondary</b> from the requirement to recite a blessing before eating it. A blessing need only be recited over the bread, not over the oil. <b>Rather,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where he is drinking it by means of an <i>anigeron</i>, as Rabba bar Shmuel said: <i>Anigeron</i></b> is <b>water</b> in which a <b>beet</b> was boiled, <b><i>ansigeron</i></b> is <b>the water</b>"

            "The Gemara reconciles: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> With <b>one who has a sore throat,</b> which he is treating with oil. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who has a sore throat should not, <i>ab initio</i>, gargle oil on Shabbat</b> for medicinal purposes, as doing so would violate the decree prohibiting the use of medicine on Shabbat. <b>However, he may,</b> even <i>ab initio</i>, <b>add a large amount of oil to the <i>anigeron</i> and swallow it.</b> Since it is common practice to swallow oil either alone or with a secondary ingredient like <i>anigeron</i> for medicinal purposes, in this case one recites: Who creates fruit of the tree.",
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>This is obvious</b> that one must recite a blessing. The Gemara responds: <b>Lest you say: Since he intends</b> to use it <b>for medicinal</b> purposes, <b>let him not recite a blessing over it at all,</b> as one does not recite a blessing before taking medicine. Therefore, <b>it teaches us</b> that, <b>since he derived pleasure from it, he must recite a blessing</b> over it.",
            "The Gemara clarifies: If one was eating plain <b>wheat flour,</b> what blessing would he recite? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that one recites: <b>Who creates fruit of the ground, and Rav Naḥman said</b> that one recites: <b>By Whose word all things came to be.</b>",
            "<b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman: Do not disagree with Rav Yehuda, as Rabbi Yoḥanan and Shmuel hold in accordance with his</b> opinion, even though they addressed another topic. <b>As Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said, and so too Rabbi Yitzḥak said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One recites the blessing: Who creates fruit of the tree, over olive oil.

            "The Gemara responds: <b>Is it comparable?

Wheat flour, on the other hand, is used to bake bread, so the flour is a raw material for which neither the blessing over wheat nor the blessing over bread is appropriate. Only the blessing: By Whose word all things came to be is appropriate.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>When it has</b> a potential for <b>additional enhancement, one does not recite: Who creates fruit of the ground; rather</b> one recites: By Whose word <b>all things</b> came to be? <b>Didn’t Rabbi Zeira say</b> that <b>Rav Mattana said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Over a raw gourd and over barley flour, one recites the blessing: By Whose word all things came to be.

            "This argument is rejected: <b>No,</b> one <b>also</b> recites: <b>By Whose word all things came to be,</b> over <b>wheat</b> flour.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Then let</b> the Sages <b>teach us</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies <b>with regard to wheat</b> flour, <b>and all the more so regarding barley</b> flour as well.",
            "The Gemara responds: It was necessary to teach us that one must recite a blessing even before eating barley flour. <b>Had</b> the Sages <b>taught us</b> this <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>wheat, I would have said: This applies</b> only with regard to <b>wheat</b> flour, <b>but</b> over <b>barley</b> flour, <b>let one not recite a blessing at all.</b> Therefore, <b>it teaches us</b> that one recites a blessing over barley flour.",

            "Another dispute over the appropriate blessing is with regard to the <b>heart of palm [<i>kura</i>],</b> which is a thin membrane covering young palm branches that was often eaten. <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that one should recite: <b>Who creates fruit of the ground.</b> And <b>Shmuel,</b> Rav Yehuda’s teacher, <b>said</b> that one should recite: <b>By Whose word all things came to be.</b>",

            "In response to this, the Gemara asks: <b>And whenever people do not plant with that</b> result <b>in mind, one does not recite a blessing over it?</b> What of the <b>caper-bush that people plant with their fruit in mind, and we learned</b> in a mishna <b>that with regard to the parts of the caper-bush [<i>nitzpa</i>], over the leaves and young fronds, one recites: Who creates fruit of the ground, and over the berries and buds he recites: Who creates fruit of the tree.</b> This indicates that even over leaves and various other parts of the tree that are secondary to the fruit, the blessing is: Who creates fruit of the ground, and not: By Whose word all things came to be.",
            "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that there is still a difference: <b>Caper-bushes, people plant</b> them <b>with</b> their <b>leaves in mind; palm trees, people do not plant</b> them <b>with</b> the <b>heart of palm in mind.</b> Therefore, no proof may be brought from the <i>halakha</i> in the case of the caper-bush to the <i>halakha</i> in the case of the of the palm.

            "Incidental to this discussion, the Gemara cites an additional <i>halakha</i> concerning the caper-bush. <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: A caper-bush during the first three years of its growth [<i>orla</i>] outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, when its fruits are prohibited by rabbinic and not Torah law, <b>one throws out the berries,</b> the primary fruit, <b>but eats the buds.</b> The Gemara raises the question: <b>Is that to say that the berries are fruit</b> of the caper, <b>and the bud is not fruit?

            "The Gemara responds: Rav’s <b>statement is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, as we learned</b> in a mishna that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: A caper-bush is tithed from</b> its component parts, <b>its young fronds, berries and buds,</b> as all these are considered its fruit. <b>And Rabbi Akiva says: Only the berries alone are tithed, because it</b> alone <b>is</b> considered <b>fruit.</b> It was in accordance with this opinion, that Rav prohibited only the eating of the berries during the caper-bush’s years of <i>orla</i>.",
            "The Gemara asks: If this is the case, why did Rav issue what seemed to be an independent ruling regarding <i>orla</i>? <b>He should have</b> simply <b>said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> from which we could have drawn a practical halakhic conclusion regarding <i>orla</i> as well.

            "On this topic, the Gemara relates: <b>Ravina found Mar bar Rav Ashi throwing away the berries and eating the buds</b> of an <i>orla</i> caper-bush.

            "Before dealing with the problem posed by Ravina to Mar bar Rav Ashi, the Gemara notes an internal contradiction in this mishna. <b>This</b> mishna <b>itself is problematic: You said that Beit Shammai say: A caper-bush is</b> considered <b>a diverse kind in a vineyard; apparently,</b> they hold that <b>it is a type of vegetable</b> bush, <b>and then you taught: These and those,</b> Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, <b>agree</b> that the caper-bush is <b>obligated in</b> the prohibition of <b><i>orla</i>; apparently, it is a type of tree.</b>",

            "The Gemara approaches this matter from a different perspective: <b>Let us derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> that buds are included in the prohibition of <i>orla</i> from the fact that the bud <b>serves as protection for the fruit, and the Torah says:</b> “When you enter the land and plant any tree for food <b>you shall regard its fruit [<i>et piryo</i>] as <i>orla</i>”</b> (Leviticus 19:23), and <b><i>et piryo</i></b> is interpreted to mean <b>that which is secondary to the fruit.

            "<b>Rava said: Where do we say</b> that a section of the plant <b>becomes protection for the fruit?</b> That is specifically <b>when it exists both when</b> the fruit <b>is detached</b> from the tree <b>and when it is</b> still <b>connected</b> to the tree. However, <b>here, it exists when</b> the fruit <b>is connected</b> to the tree, <b>but when it is detached it does not,</b> and since the protection falls off of the fruit when it is picked, it is no longer considered protection.",
            "<b>Abaye raised a challenge</b> based on what we learned with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity: <b>The crown of a pomegranate joins</b> together with the pomegranate as a unified entity with regard to calculating the requisite size in order to become ritually impure. <b>And its flower,</b> however, <b>does not join</b> together with the pomegranate in that calculation. <b>From</b> the fact <b>that it says</b> that <b>the pomegranate’s flower does not join, consequently</b> the flower is secondary to the fruit and <b>is not</b> considered <b>food. And we learned</b> in a mishna regarding the laws of <i>orla</i>: <b>The rinds of a pomegranate and its flower, nutshells, and pits</b> of all kinds, <b>are</b> all <b>obligated in</b> the prohibition of <b><i>orla</i>.</b> This indicates that the criteria dictating what is considered protection of a fruit and what is considered the fruit itself with regard to ritual impurity, are not the same criteria used with regard to <i>orla</i>, as is illustrated by the case of the pomegranate flower. Therefore, even if the buds are not regarded as protecting the fruit with regard to ritual impurity, they may still be considered fruit with regard to <i>orla</i>.",
            "<b>Rather, Rava said</b> another explanation: <b>Where do we say</b> that a section of the plant <b>becomes protection for the fruit? Where it exists when the fruit is ripe. This bud does not exist when the fruit is ripe,</b> because it falls off beforehand.",
            "The Gemara challenges this explanation as well: <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rav Naḥman say</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said: Those <i>orla</i> date coverings are prohibited, because they became protection for the fruit. And when do</b> these coverings serve as <b>protection for the fruit? When the fruit is still young; and he,</b> nevertheless, <b>calls them protection for the fruit.</b> This indicates that in order to be considered protection for the fruit it need not remain until the fruit is fully ripened. The question remains: Why are the buds not accorded the same status as the berries of the caper-bush?",
            "The Gemara explains that <b>Rav Naḥman held</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, as we learned</b> in a mishna that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: The grape-bud,</b> i.e., a cluster of grapes in its earliest stage, immediately after the flowers dropped from the vine, <b>is prohibited</b> due to <i>orla</i>, <b>because it is</b> already considered <b>a fruit.</b> According to this opinion, even the date coverings that exist in the earliest stage of the ripening process are nevertheless considered protection for the fruit and prohibited due to <i>orla</i>. <b>The Rabbis disagree with him,</b> explaining that fruit at that stage is not considered fruit; and, therefore, the date coverings and caper-bush buds are not considered protection for the fruit and are not prohibited due to <i>orla</i>.",
            "<b>Rav Shimi of Neharde’a strongly objects to this</b> <i>halakha</i>: <b>Do the Rabbis disagree with</b> the opinion of Rabbi Yosei <b>with regard to</b> the fruits <b>of all other trees</b> besides grapes, that even in the very first stage of ripening, they are considered fruit? <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: With regard to fruit, which grows during the Sabbatical year, the Torah says: “And the Shabbat of the land shall be to you for eating” (Leviticus 25:6). The Sages inferred, for eating, and not for loss. Because one is prohibited from discarding fruit grown during the Sabbatical year, the question is raised: <b>From when may one no</b> longer <b>cut trees during the Sabbatical year</b> as he thereby damages the fruit? <b>Beit Shammai say: All trees, from when</b> the blossoms fall off and <b>fruit</b> begins to <b>emerge</b> in its earliest stage. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> There is a distinction between different types of trees. <b>Carob trees</b> may not be cut <b>from when they</b> form <b>chains</b> of carobs, <b>vines</b> may not be cut <b><i>misheyegaru</i>,</b> explained below, <b>olives from when they blossom, and all other trees from when</b> fruit <b>emerges.</b>",
            "<b>And Rav Asi said:</b> <i>Sheyegaru</i> in our mishna is to be understood: <b>It is an unripe grape, it is a grape kernel, it is a white bean.</b> Before this is even explained, the Gemara expresses its astonishment: <b>Does it enter your mind</b> that the grape is, at any stage, <b>a white bean? Rather, say: Its size,</b> that of an unripe grape, is equivalent to the size <b>of a white bean.</b> In any case, <b>whom did you hear that said: An unripe grape, yes,</b> is considered fruit, while <b>a grape-bud, no,</b> is not considered fruit? Wasn’t it <b>the Rabbis</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yosei, <b>and it is taught</b> that, according to these Sages, one is forbidden to cut <b>all other trees from when</b> fruit <b>emerges.</b> This indicates that even they agree that from the very beginning of the ripening process, the fruit is forbidden due to <i>orla</i>. The question remains: Why are the buds permitted?",
            "<b>Rather, Rava said</b> a different explanation: <b>Where do we say</b> that a section of the plant <b>becomes protection for the fruit? Where if you remove the protection, the fruit dies. Here,</b> in the case of the caper-bush, <b>when you remove</b> the bud, <b>the fruit does not die.</b>",
            "In fact, <b>there was an incident and they removed the flower of a pomegranate, and the pomegranate withered. And they removed the flower of the fruit of a caper-bush and the fruit of the caper-bush survived.</b> Therefore, buds are not considered protection for the fruit.",
            "The Gemara concludes: <b>The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Mar bar Rav Ashi, who discarded the berries and ate the buds.

            "The question arose with regard to the blessing over <b>peppers. Rav Sheshet said:</b> One who eats peppers must recite: <b>By Whose word all things came to be.

            "<b>The Gemara raised an objection</b> to this based on what was taught in a <i>baraita</i>, that regarding the verse: “When you enter the land and plant any tree for food you shall regard its fruit as <i>orla</i>” (Leviticus 19:23), <b>Rabbi Meir would say: By inference from that which is stated: “You shall regard its fruit as <i>orla</i>,” don’t I know that it is</b> referring to <b>a tree</b> that produces <b>food?

Even after the tree is felled, the land remains intact. Similarly, with regard to blessings, the <i>halakha</i> maintains that fruit of the tree is considered to be fruit of the ground, as well.",
            "We learned in the mishna: One who recited: Who creates fruit of the tree, <b>over fruits of the earth,</b> did not fulfill his obligation. The Gemara asks: <b>That is obvious,</b> as fruits of the earth do not fall under the rubric of trees. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> This ruling in the mishna <b>is only necessary according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who <b>said</b> in another context that <b>wheat is a type of tree, as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The tree from which Adam, the first</b> man, <b>ate, Rabbi Meir says: It was a vine, as nothing brings wailing</b> and trouble <b>upon man</b> even today <b>other than wine,</b> as <b>it is stated</b> with regard to Noah: <b>“And he drank from the wine and became drunk”</b> (Genesis 9:21). <b>Rabbi Neḥemya says: It was a fig</b> tree, <b>as with the object with which they were corrupted</b> and sinned <b>they were rehabilitated, as it is stated: “And they sewed together fig leaves</b> and made for themselves loincloths” (Genesis 3:7).

            "The halakhic measure determined by <b>vines</b> is <b>the quantity of a quarter <i>log</i> of wine for a Nazirite</b> and not the wine equivalent of a quarter <i>log</i> of water, which is a slightly different measure. <b>Figs</b> serve as the basis for the measure of <b>a dried fig-bulk,</b> typically the smallest unit of food for which someone will be held liable <b>for carrying out on Shabbat</b> from one domain to another. <b>Pomegranates</b> teach us a particular measurement as well, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>All</b> ritually impure wooden <b>utensils belonging to</b> ordinary <b>homeowners</b> become pure through breaking the utensil,"

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the basic mitzva of <i>zimmun</i>, the Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived<b>,</b> that after a meal in which three diners participated, a <i>zimmun</i> must be recited? <b>Rav Asi said: As the verse states: “Praise God with me, and we will exalt His name together”</b> (Psalms 34:4), i.e., the one reciting the blessing turns to at least two others to praise God together. <b>Rabbi Abbahu said:</b> The source of the mitzva of <i>zimmun</i> is derived <b>from</b> the verse <b>here: “When I call the Name of the Lord, give</b> [plural] <b>praise to our God”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:3).",

The Gemara responds: In that case, <b>two were required</b> to complete the quorum; Rabbi Eliezer <b>freed one and fulfilled his obligation with</b> another <b>one,</b> who completed the quorum of ten without being freed.",
            "With regard to this incident, the Gemara asks: <b>How did he do that? Didn’t Rav Yehuda say: Anyone who frees his</b> Canaanite <b>slave violates a positive mitzva, as it is stated</b> with regard to Canaanite slaves: “You will keep them as an inheritance for your children after you, to hold as a possession; <b>they will serve as bondsmen for you forever”</b> (Leviticus 25:46)? How, then, could Rabbi Eliezer have freed his slave? The Gemara answers: The case of <b>a mitzva is different.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>It is a mitzva that comes through a transgression,</b> and a mitzva fulfilled in that manner is inherently flawed. The Gemara responds: <b>A mitzva</b> that benefits <b>the many is different,</b> and one may free his slave for that purpose.",
            "In praise of a quorum of ten, the Gemara states that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: One should always rise early</b> to go <b>to the synagogue in order to have the privilege and be counted among the first ten</b> to complete the quorum, <b>as even if one hundred</b> people <b>arrive after him, he receives the reward of them all,</b> as they are all joining that initial quorum. The Gemara is perplexed: <b>Does it enter your mind</b> that he receives <b>the reward of them all?</b> Why should he take away their reward? <b>Rather,</b> emend the statement and <b>say: He receives a reward equivalent to</b> the reward of <b>them all.</b>",
            "With regard to the laws of joining a quorum, <b>Rav Huna said: Nine plus an ark</b> in which the Torah scrolls are stored <b>join</b> to form a quorum of ten. <b>Rav Naḥman said to him: Is an ark a man,</b> that it may be counted in the quorum of ten? <b>Rather, Rav Huna said: Nine who appear like ten may join together.</b> There was disagreement over this: <b>Some said this</b> <i>halakha</i> as follows: Nine appear like ten <b>when they are gathered. And some said this</b> <i>halakha</i> as follows: Nine appear like ten <b>when they are scattered,</b> the disagreement being which formation creates the impression of a greater number of individuals.",

            "On the topic of the blessings of Grace after Meals, the Gemara adds that <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>the order of Grace after Meals is as follows: The first blessing is the blessing of: Who feeds</b> all; <b>the second is the blessing of the land; the third is: Who builds Jerusalem; and the fourth is: Who is good and does good.

The Gemara explains: <b>And you shall bless, that is the blessing of: Who feeds</b> all. <b>The Lord, your God, that is the <i>zimmun</i> blessing</b> in which God’s name is invoked. <b>For the land, that is the blessing of the land; good, that is</b> the blessing: <b>Who builds Jerusalem, and it also says: “This good mountain and Lebanon”</b> (Deuteronomy 3:25), which is interpreted homiletically as referring to Jerusalem and the Temple. <b>That He gave you, that is: Who is good and does good.</b> However, <b>I only have</b> a Torah source for blessings <b>after</b> eating, i.e., Grace after Meals. <b>From where</b> is it derived that one is obligated to recite blessings <b>before</b> eating? <b>You said</b> that it can be derived through <b>an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: When one is satisfied, he</b> is obligated to <b>recite a blessing</b> and thank God for food; <b>when he is hungry, all the more so</b> that he should recite a blessing to offer thanks for the food he will eat.",
            "<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: It is not necessary</b> to interpret the verse this way; rather, it should be understood in a slightly different manner, as follows: <b>“And you shall eat and be satisfied, and you shall bless,” that is the blessing of: Who feeds</b> all; <b>however, the <i>zimmun</i> blessing is derived</b> from the verse: <b>“Praise God with me</b> and we will exalt His name together” (Psalms 34:3).

            "<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> That source for the obligation to recite a blessing beforehand <b>is not necessary, as it says: “And He will bless your bread and your water”</b> (Exodus 23:25); <b>do not read: And He will bless [<i>uveirakh</i>], rather: And you will bless [<i>uvareikh</i>].

With regard to what did they disagree?</b> With regard to the blessings recited in the middle of <i>havdala</i>, the blessings <b>over the light and over the spices. Beit Shammai say: Light and spices thereafter; and Beit Hillel say: Spices and light thereafter.</b> Therefore, the <i>baraita</i>, where it is taught that the blessing over the candle precedes the blessing over the spices, must be according to Beit Shammai and it says that wine precedes <i>havdala</i>.",
            "The Gemara presents another challenge: <b>And from where</b> do you ascertain <b>that this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai in accordance with</b> the interpretation of <b>Rabbi Yehuda? Perhaps it is</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel in accordance with</b> the interpretation of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b>",
            "The Gemara responds: <b>It cannot enter your mind</b> that this <i>baraita</i> is the opinion of Beit Hillel in accordance with the interpretation of Rabbi Meir. <b>As it was taught here in the mishna,</b> which like all unattributed <i>mishnayot</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir: <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> One recites the blessing over the <b>candle,</b> then the Grace after <b>Meals</b> blessing, then the blessing over the <b>spices,</b> and finally the blessing of <b><i>havdala</i>. And Beit Hillel say:</b> The order is <b>candle, spices,</b> Grace after <b>Meals, and <i>havdala</i>. And there, in the <i>baraita</i>, it was taught: And if he has only one cup</b> of wine, <b>he leaves it for after the</b> last Shabbat <b>meal and arranges all</b> of the blessings: Grace after Meals, the blessings of <i>havdala</i>, and the blessing over wine <b>together thereafter.</b> According to the <i>baraita</i>, all of the blessings follow Grace after Meals. Since the <i>baraita</i> and the mishna do not correspond, <b>conclude from here</b> that the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai, in accordance with</b> the interpretation of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>",
            "<b>And, nevertheless,</b> after the Gemara has proven that the <i>baraita</i> corresponds to the opinion of Beit Shammai as interpreted by Rabbi Yehuda, the contradiction between Beit Shammai’s statement in the <i>baraita</i> and their statement in the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>is difficult.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Beit Shammai hold</b> that <b>the arrival of the day</b> of Shabbat or a Festival <b>is different from the departure of the day.</b> As with regard to <b>the arrival of the day, the more that we can advance it, the better;</b> with regard to <b>the departure of the day, the more we postpone it, the better, so that</b> Shabbat <b>should not be like a burden to us.</b> Consequently, although Beit Shammai situate <i>kiddush</i> before the blessing over the wine, they agree that one should recite <i>havdala</i> after the blessing over the wine.",
            "The above discussion referred to Beit Shammai’s opinion with regard to Grace after Meals recited over a cup of wine. The Gemara poses the question: <b>And do Beit Shammai hold</b> that <b>Grace after Meals requires a cup</b> of wine? <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>Wine came before</b> the diners <b>after the meal; if only that cup</b> of wine <b>is there, Beit Shammai say: One recites a blessing over the wine and recites a blessing over the food,</b> Grace after Meals, <b>thereafter. What? Is it not that he recites a blessing over</b> the wine <b>and drinks it,</b> leaving Grace after Meals without wine? The Gemara rejects this: <b>No.</b> The mishna means that <b>he recites a blessing over</b> the cup of wine <b>and leaves it</b> to drink from it after Grace after Meals.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Didn’t the Master say</b> that <b>one who recites a blessing is required to taste?</b> The Gemara answers: Indeed, this refers to a case <b>where he tasted it.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Didn’t the Master say</b> that one who <b>tasted</b> the cup of wine <b>disqualified it</b> and it is no longer suitable to be used for a cup of blessing? The Gemara answers: This does not refer to a case where he drank the wine; but rather, where <b>he tasted it with his hand</b> or poured a bit into another cup and drank from it.",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Didn’t the Master say: A cup of blessing requires</b> a minimum <b>measure</b> of wine? By drinking the wine, <b>doesn’t he diminish</b> the cup <b>from</b> containing <b>its</b> minimum <b>measure?</b> The Gemara answers: This refers to a case where <b>the cup contained more than the</b> required <b>measure</b> of wine.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> explicitly: <b>If he has only one cup</b> of wine? If there is more than the required measure of wine, he does not have only one cup. The Gemara responds: Indeed, <b>there are not two</b> cups, <b>but</b> there is <b>more than one.</b>",
            "The Gemara raises another difficulty: <b>Didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya teach</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Beit Shammai say: He recites a blessing over the wine and drinks it, and recites Grace after Meals thereafter?</b> Evidently, according to Beit Shammai, wine is not required for Grace after Meals. <b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>two <i>tanna’im</i></b> hold <b>in accordance with Beit Shammai</b> and differ with regard to their opinion.",
            "We learned in our mishna that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagree over whether the washing of the hands or mixing water with the wine takes precedence. <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> One washes his hands and mixes water with the wine in the cup thereafter, and Beit Hillel say: One mixes water with the wine in the cup and only washes his hands thereafter.",
            "<b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>Tosefta</i> where this issue is discussed in greater detail: <b>Beit Shammai say: One washes</b> his <b>hands and mixes water</b> with the wine <b>in the cup thereafter, as if you say</b> that <b>one mixes water</b> with the wine <b>in the cup first,</b> his hands will remain ritually impure, as the Sages <b>decreed</b> that unwashed hands have second degree ritual impurity status as if they touched something rendered ritually impure by a creeping animal. Consequently, there is room for concern that <b>the liquid that</b> inevitably drips <b>on the outside of the cup might become ritually impure due to his hands, and</b> those liquids <b>will in turn render the cup ritually impure.</b> Consequently, Beit Shammai said that the hands must be washed first in order to prevent that result.",

            "The Gemara explains: <b>Beit Shammai hold: It is prohibited to use a vessel the outer side of which has been rendered ritually impure by liquids.</b> This prohibition stems from <b>a decree</b> of the Sages, due to concern <b>for drips</b> of liquid that would fall from inside the vessel to its outer side, as those drips themselves would be rendered ritually impure by virtue of their contact with the outer side of the vessel. <b>And</b> Beit Shammai hold that <b>there is no</b> reason to <b>issue a decree</b> due to the concern of Beit Hillel <b>lest the liquid on one’s hands will be rendered ritually impure by the cup, as</b> Beit Shammai hold that the use of a vessel of that kind is prohibited.",
            "<b>And Beit Hillel hold: One is permitted to use a vessel the outer side of which has been rendered ritually impure by liquid,</b> as they <b>say: Drips are uncommon,</b> and decrees are not issued on the basis of an uncommon case.

            "<b>Alternatively,</b> Beit Hillel hold that one mixes the water with the wine in the cup and then washes his hands due to the principle: <b>Immediately</b> after <b>the washing of the hands</b> comes <b>the meal.</b> Therefore, he mixes the water and wine in the cup, then he washes his hands, and then he immediately proceeds to the meal.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the point of Beit Hillel adding: <b>Alternatively?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai as follows:</b> Even <b>according to you, who said</b> that <b>it is prohibited to use a vessel the outer side of which is ritually impure as we issued a decree due to</b> concern for <b>drips, even so,</b> our opinion <b>is preferable</b> to yours, <b>as</b> our opinion adheres to the principle: <b>Immediately</b> after <b>the washing of the hands</b> comes <b>the meal.</b>",

            "The Sages also <b>instituted that one should greet another in the name</b> of God, i.e., one should mention God’s name in his greeting, <b>as it is stated: “And presently Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the harvesters, The Lord is with you, and they said to him, May the Lord bless you”</b> (Ruth 2:4). <b>And it says:</b> “And the angel of God appeared to him <b>and said to him, God is with you, mighty man of valor”</b> (Judges 6:12). <b>And it says: “And despise not your mother when she is old”</b> (Proverbs 23:22), i.e., one must not neglect customs which he inherits. <b>And</b> lest you say that mentioning God’s name is prohibited, <b>it says: “It is time to work for the Lord; they have made void Your Torah”</b> (Psalms 119:126), i.e., it is occasionally necessary to negate biblical precepts in order to perform God’s will, and greeting another is certainly God’s will. <b>Rabbi Natan says</b> another interpretation of the verse: <b>“Make void Your Torah” because “it is the time to work for the Lord,”</b> i.e., occasionally it is necessary to negate biblical precepts in order to bolster the Torah.",
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the obligation to recite a blessing for a miracle, the Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The verse states: “And Jethro said: Blessed be the Lord, Who delivered</b> you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh; Who delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians” (Exodus 18:10); a blessing is recited for a miracle.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>For a miracle</b> that occurs for the <b>multitudes we recite a blessing,</b> but <b>for a miracle</b> that befalls <b>an individual</b> person <b>we do not recite a blessing?

            "<b>It is taught</b> in the midrash: They are the <b>stones that</b> remained <b>suspended</b> in the air and did not fall <b>because of [<i>al gav</i>] a man [<i>ish</i>] and they fell down because of [<i>al gav</i>] a man [<i>ish</i>].</b> The Gemara explains: <b>They</b> remained <b>suspended because of a man; that is Moses,</b> whom the verse refers to as a man, <b>as it is written: “And the man Moses was very modest”</b> (Numbers 12:3), <b>and it is written:</b> “And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread forth his hands unto the Lord; <b>the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth”</b> (Exodus 9:33).

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> the <i>baraita</i> teaches that for all of these one must give <b>thanks and</b> offer <b>praise?</b> The Gemara answers: The language of the <i>baraita</i> should be emended <b>and teach: Over Lot and his wife one recites two blessings.

            "The Gemara elaborates: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>seafarers</b> are required to thank God? <br><b>As it is written: “They who go down to the sea in ships,</b> who do business in great waters; <b>they see the works of the Lord”</b> (Psalms 107:23–24). <br><b>And it says: “For He commands and raises the stormy wind</b> which lifts up the waves thereof. <br><b>They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths:</b> their soul is melted because of trouble” (Psalms 107:25–26). <br><b>And it says: “They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man,</b> and are at their wits’ end.” <br><b>And it says</b> immediately thereafter: <b>“Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and He brings them out of their distress”</b> (Psalms 107:28).<br><b>And it says: “He makes the storm calm,</b> so the waves thereof are still” (Psalms 107:29), <br><b>and it says: “Then are they glad because they be quiet;</b> so He brings them unto their desired haven” (Psalms 107:30), <br><b>and it says: “They are grateful to God for His loving-kindness and His wonders for mankind”</b> (Psalms 107:31).",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>those who walk in the desert</b> are required to thank God?

            "That <b>one who was ill and recovered</b> must offer thanks is derived, <b>as it is written:</b> <br><b>“Fools, because of their transgression and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.</b><br><b>Their soul abhors all manner of food</b> and they draw near unto the gates of death” (Psalms 107:17–18), <br>and: <b>“Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble,</b> and He saves them from their distress” (Psalms 107:19), <br>and then: <b>“He sent His word and healed them,</b> and delivered them from their destructions” (Psalms 107:20). <br>After they are healed: <b>“They are grateful to God for His goodness”</b> (Psalms 107:21).",

            "As for the virtue of <b>prolonging one’s</b> mealtime at the <b>table,</b> which Rav Yehuda mentioned, the Gemara explains: <b>Perhaps a poor person will come</b> during the meal and the host will be in a position to <b>give him</b> food immediately, without forcing the poor person to wait. The Sages elsewhere praised a person who acts appropriately at a meal, <b>as it is written: “The altar, three cubits high</b> and the length thereof, two cubits, was of wood, and so the corners thereof; the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were also of wood” (Ezekiel 41:22), <b>and it is written</b> in the continuation of that verse: <b>“And he said unto me: This is the table that is before the Lord.”</b> The language of this verse is difficult, as it <b>begins with the altar and concludes with the table.</b> Rather, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar both say: As long as the Temple stood, the altar atoned for Israel’s</b> transgressions. <b>Now</b> that it is destroyed, <b>a person’s table atones for his</b> transgressions.",

            "On a similar note, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, only grants wisdom to one who</b> already <b>possesses wisdom, as it is stated: “He gives wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to they who know understanding”</b> (Daniel 2:21). <b>Rav Taḥalifa, from the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>heard</b> this <b>and repeated it before Rabbi Abbahu.</b> Rabbi Abbahu <b>said to him: You learned</b> proof for this idea <b>from there; we learn it from here: As it is written</b> in praise of the builders of the Tabernacle: <b>“And in the hearts of all who are wise-hearted I have placed wisdom”</b> (Exodus 31:6).",
            "Related to what was stated above, that one should pray for a good dream, the Gemara cites additional maxims concerning dreams and their interpretation. <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> One should see <b>any dream, and not a fast.</b> In other words, any dream is preferable to a dream during a fast. <b>And Rav Ḥisda said: A dream not interpreted is like a letter not read.</b> As long as it is not interpreted it cannot be fulfilled; the interpretation of a dream creates its meaning. <b>And Rav Ḥisda said: A good dream is not entirely fulfilled and a bad dream is not entirely fulfilled. And Rav Ḥisda said: A bad dream is preferable to a good dream,</b> as a bad dream causes one to feel remorse and to repent. <b>And Rav Ḥisda said: A bad dream, his sadness is enough for him; a good dream, his joy is enough for him.</b> This means that the sadness or joy engendered by the dream renders the actual fulfillment of the dream superfluous. Similarly, <b>Rav Yosef said: Even for me, the joy of a good dream negates it.</b> Even Rav Yosef, who was blind and ill, derived such pleasure from a good dream that it was never actually realized. <b>And Rav Ḥisda said: A bad dream is worse than lashes, as it is stated: “God has so made it, that men should fear before Him”</b> (Ecclesiastes 3:14), <b>and Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: That is a bad dream</b> that causes man to fear.",
            "With regard to the verse: <b>“The prophet that has a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that has My word, let him speak My word faithfully. What has the straw to do with the grain? says the Lord”</b> (Jeremiah 23:28), the Gemara asks: <b>What do straw and grain have to do with a dream? Rather, Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon bar Yoḥai: Just as it is impossible for the grain</b> to grow <b>without straw, so too it is impossible to dream without idle matters.</b> Even a dream that will be fulfilled in the future contains some element of nonsense.",
            "On a similar note, <b>Rabbi Berekhya said: Even though part of a dream is fulfilled, all of it is not fulfilled. From where do we</b> derive this? <b>From</b> the story of <b>Joseph’s</b> dream, <b>as it is written:</b> “And he said: Behold, I have dreamed yet a dream: <b>and, behold, the sun and the moon</b>"
        ],
        [
            "and eleven stars bowed down to me” (Genesis 37:9), <b>and at that time his mother was no longer</b> alive. According to the interpretation of the dream, the moon symbolizes Joseph’s mother. Even this dream that was ultimately fulfilled contained an element that was not fulfilled.",
            "From the same source, <b>Rabbi Levi said: One should always anticipate</b> fulfillment of a <b>good dream up to twenty-two years</b> after the dream. <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>From Joseph, as it is written</b> in the story of Joseph’s dream: <b>“These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old,</b> was feeding the flock with his brethren” (Genesis 37:2); <b>and it is written: “And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh</b> King of Egypt” (Genesis 41:46). <b>From seventeen to thirty how many</b> years <b>are they? Thirteen; and</b> add <b>seven years of plenty and two of famine;</b> the total is <b>twenty-two</b> and only then was the dream fulfilled when his brothers came and bowed down to him.",
            "<b>Rav Huna said: A good person is not shown a good dream and a wicked person is not shown a bad dream;</b> rather, a good person is punished for his relatively few transgressions with bad dreams and a wicked person is rewarded for his relatively few merits with good dreams.",
            "<b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>All of</b> King <b>David’s life he never saw a good dream, and all of Ahitophel’s life he never saw a bad dream.</b>",
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Is it not written: “No evil shall befall you,</b> neither shall any plague come near your tent” (Psalms 91:10)? <b>And Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said</b> in explanation of that verse: This means <b>that you will be frightened neither by bad dreams nor by evil thoughts. Neither shall any plague come near your tent,</b> means <b>that you will never find your wife</b> with the <b>uncertain</b> status of a <b>menstruating woman when you return from a journey.</b> This proves that it is impossible that a righteous person will experience bad dreams throughout his life. <b>Rather,</b> one might say that <b>he does not see</b> bad dreams; <b>others see</b> bad dreams about him.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And when he does not see</b> a dream, <b>is</b> that <b>a virtue? Didn’t Rabbi Zeira say: Anyone who sleeps seven days without a dream is called evil,</b> as it indicates that God does not wish to appear to him even in that indirect manner. Allusion to this is, <b>as it is stated: “And he that has it shall lie satisfied [<i>vesave’a</i>], he shall not be visited with evil”</b> (Proverbs 19:23). The Sages said: <b>Do not read</b> it as <b>satisfied [<i>vesave’a</i>], rather</b> read it as <b>seven [<i>vesheva</i>],</b> which is an allusion to the fact that one who sleeps seven times and does not experience a dream is considered evil. <b>Rather,</b> one must say that David saw dreams <b>and the</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>says as follows:</b> David certainly <b>saw</b> dreams, <b>but he did not understand what he saw.</b>",

            "The Gemara elaborates: <b>Three transformations:</b><br><b>“You transformed my mourning into dancing;</b><br><b>You loosed my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness”</b> (Psalms 30:12);<br><b>“Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old together;</b><br><b>for I will transform their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow”</b> (Jeremiah 31:12);<br>and: <b>“Nevertheless the Lord your God would not hearken unto Balaam;</b><br><b>but the Lord your God transformed the curse into a blessing unto you”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:6).",
            "<b>And three redemptions, as it is written:</b><br><b>“He has redeemed my soul in peace so that none came near me;</b> for they were many that strove with me” (Psalms 55:19);<br><b>“The redeemed of the Lord shall return,</b> and come with singing unto Zion, and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads;<br>they shall obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away” (Isaiah 35:10);<br>and: <b>“The people said to Saul: Shall Jonathan die, who has wrought this great salvation</b> in Israel?<br>So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not” (I Samuel 14:45).",

            "<b>Another began and said: One who enters a city and fears the evil eye</b> should <b>hold the thumb [<i>zekafa</i>] of his right hand in his left hand and the thumb of his left hand in his right hand and recite the following: I, so-and-so son of so-and-so, come from the descendants of Joseph,</b> over whom <b>the evil eye has no dominion, as it is stated: “Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine by a fountain [<i>alei ayin</i>];</b> its branches run over the wall” (Genesis 49:22). <b>Do not read</b> it as <b><i>alei ayin</i>; but rather,</b> read it as <b><i>olei ayin</i>, who rise above the eye</b> and the evil eye has no dominion over him. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said:</b> Derive it <b>from here,</b> from what is stated in Jacob’s blessing of Joseph’s sons: <b>“And let them grow like fish into a multitude in the midst of the earth”</b> (Genesis 48:16): <b>Just as fish in the sea are covered by water and the evil eye has no dominion over them</b> as they cannot be seen, <b>so too the offspring of Joseph, the evil eye has no dominion over them.

            "The Gemara continues dealing with interpretations of the details of dreams: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: One who sees a well in a dream sees peace, as it is said: “And Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and found there a well of living water”</b> (Genesis 26:19), and ultimately there was peace. <b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> One who sees a well in his dream it is a symbol that <b>he has found Torah,</b> as the well symbolizes Torah. <b>As it is stated</b> with regard to the Torah: <b>“For whoever finds me finds life”</b> (Proverbs 8:35), <b>and it is written here: “A well of living water,”</b> and we see that a well is linked to Torah as both are associated with life. <b>Rava said:</b> The well in the dream symbolizes <b>actual life.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Ḥanan said: There are three</b> items seen in dreams that are indications of <b>peace: A river, a bird and a pot.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>A river, as it is written: “I will extend peace to her like a river”</b> (Isaiah 66:12); <b>a bird, as it is written: “As birds hovering, so will the Lord of hosts protect Jerusalem”</b> (Isaiah 31:5); and <b>a pot, as it is written: “Lord, You will establish [<i>tishpot</i>] peace for us”</b> (Isaiah 26:12). Peace is likened to a pot which is placed [<i>shafat</i>] on the fire. <b>And Rabbi Ḥanina said: We learned</b> that a pot in a dream is a sign of peace <b>with regard to a pot that does not have meat in it,</b> as a pot that has meat in it symbolizes calamity, as it is stated: <b>“Yea, they chop them in pieces, as that which is in the pot, and as flesh within the cauldron”</b> (Micah 3:3).",
            "Since rivers, birds, and pots have ambiguous connotations, it is recommended that someone who sees them in a dream recite a verse that interprets the dream positively. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> One who sees something in a dream that may be interpreted ambiguously should quickly recite an appropriate verse suggestive of a positive interpretation. For example, <b>one who sees a river in a dream</b> should <b>rise early</b> and <b>recite: “I will extend peace to her like a river,” before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“For distress will come in like a river”</b> (Isaiah 59:19). <b>One who sees a bird in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “As birds hovering, so will the Lord of hosts protect Jerusalem,” before a different verse,</b> with a negative connotation, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“As a bird that wanders from her nest,</b> so is a man that wanders from his place” (Proverbs 27:8). <b>One who sees a pot in a dream</b> should <b>rise early and recite: “Lord, You will establish peace for us,” before a different verse,</b> which concludes with a wrathful prophecy, <b>can precede it</b> in becoming reality: <b>“Set on the pot, set it on”</b> (Ezekiel 24:3).",

            "The Gemara relates that <b>Ulla and Rav Ḥisda were once walking along the road when they came upon the doorway of the house of Rav Ḥana bar Ḥanilai. Rav Ḥisda groaned and sighed. Ulla asked him: Why are you sighing? Didn’t Rav say: Sighing breaks half of one’s body? As it is stated: “Sigh, therefore, you son of man; with the breaking of your loins”</b> (Ezekiel 21:11); sighing breaks a person down to his loins. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that sighing breaks <b>even</b> one’s <b>entire body, as it is stated: “And it shall be, when they say unto you: Why are you sighing? That you shall say: Because of the tidings, for it comes; and every heart shall melt,</b> and all hands shall be slack, and every spirit shall be faint, and all knees shall drip with water” (Ezekiel 21:12).",
            "Rav Ḥisda <b>said to</b> Ulla: <b>How can I not sigh?</b> We see <b>this house where there were sixty cooks during the day and sixty cooks at night who would cook for anyone in need, and</b> Rav Ḥana <b>never removed his hand from his pocket</b> because he <b>thought: Perhaps a well-born poor person</b> might <b>come and</b> in the time that passed <b>until he put his hand in his pocket</b> to give him charity, the poor person <b>would be embarrassed.

            "Ulla <b>said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: You have nothing about which to sigh, as <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said as follows: From the day that the Temple was destroyed a decree was issued upon the houses of the righteous that they would be destroyed, as it is stated: “In mine ears said the Lord of hosts: Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant”</b> (Isaiah 5:9). <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> In the <b>future,</b> in the end of days, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, will restore them to their</b> original locations and their <b>inhabited state, as it is stated: “A Song of Ascents of David.

From this verse one may infer that <b>just as in the future the Holy One, Blessed be He, will restore Mount Zion to its inhabited state, so too, in the future the Holy One, Blessed be He, will restore the houses of the righteous to their inhabited state,</b> so you have no reason to sigh. <b>Seeing that he was still not satisfied,</b> Ulla <b>said to him: It is enough for a servant to be like his master.</b> Since God leaves His home, the Holy Temple, in ruins, one should not be distraught over the destruction of the houses of the righteous.",

            "The Gemara continues to discuss the obligation to recite a blessing over unusual phenomena. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: One who sees spotted people recites: Blessed…Who makes creatures different.</b> The Gemara <b>raises a challenge: One who saw a person with</b> unusually <b>black skin, a person with</b> unusually <b>red skin, a person with</b> unusually <b>white skin [<i>lavkan</i>], an</b> unusually <b>tall and thin person, a dwarf, or one with warts [<i>darnikos</i>]recites: Blessed…Who makes creatures different.</b> However, one who sees <b>an amputee, a blind person, a flat-headed person, a lame person, one afflicted with boils, or spotted people recites: Blessed…the true Judge,</b> not: Who makes creatures different.",
            "The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This,</b> where Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says to recite: Who makes creatures different, refers to a case where the individual was spotted <b>from</b> when he was <b>in his mother’s womb,</b> since birth. While <b>this,</b> where one recites: The true Judge, refers to a case where the individual only became spotted <b>after he was born.</b> The Gemara remarks: The language of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is also precise</b> as it draws a parallel to other cases, as <b>it taught</b> that a spotted person is <b>similar to an amputee,</b> which, in general, is a handicap incurred after birth. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>conclude from this.</b>",

            "We learned in the mishna that <b>over <i>zikin</i>,</b> one recites: Whose strength and power fill the world. The Gemara asks: <b>What are <i>zikin</i>? Shmuel said: A comet. Shmuel also said: The paths of the sky are as clear to me as the paths</b> of my city, <b>Neharde’a, except for comets, that I do not know what they are.

The Gemara rejects this: <b>The aura</b> of the comet <b>passes</b> Orion <b>and it appears as though</b> the comet itself <b>passes. Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said</b> a different answer: It is merely that <b><i>vilon</i>,</b> one of the firmaments, <b>rips and furls and the light of</b> the next <b>firmament is seen,</b> and this appears like a comet. <b>Rav Ashi said</b> another explanation: It is not a comet that passes Orion, but <b>a star that is uprooted from one side of Orion, and another</b> star, <b>from the other side</b> of Orion, <b>sees it and gets startled</b> and shudders, <b>and appears as if it is passing.</b>",
            "On the subject of stars, the Gemara notes that <b>Shmuel raised a contradiction</b> between the implications of two verses with regard to constellations. On the one hand <b>it is written: “Who makes Ursa Major, Orion, and Pleiades,</b> and the chambers of the south” (Job 9:9); Orion precedes Pleiades. <b>And</b> on the other hand <b>it is written: “He Who makes Pleiades and Orion”</b> (Amos 5:8); Pleiades precedes Orion. <b>So how</b> is this reconciled? The Gemara replies: <b>Were it not for Orion’s heat, the universe could not exist because of the cold of Pleiades;</b> and conversely, <b>were it not for the cold of Pleiades, the universe could not exist because of the heat of Orion.</b>",
            "<b>And we learned</b> a tradition that <b>if the tail of</b> the constellation <b>Scorpio</b> did <b>not</b> rest <b>in the River of Fire, anyone stung by a scorpion would not survive. And that is what the All-Merciful said to Job</b> of the relationship between heat and cold among the stars: <b>“Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades or loosen the bands of Orion?”</b> (Job 38:31); God alternates intensifying the power of different constellations in order to raise or lower the temperature.",
            "With regard to Pleiades, the Gemara asks: <b>What is Pleiades [<i>Kima</i>]?</b> Why is it called by that name? <b>Shmuel said:</b> Because it is <b>approximately a hundred [<i>keme’a</i>] stars</b>, as that is the number of stars in that constellation; <b>some say that</b> they are <b>concentrated and some say that</b> they are <b>dispersed.</b>",
            "With regard to the verse: “Who makes Ursa Major, Orion, and Pleiades” (Job 9:9), the Gemara asks: <b>What is Ursa Major [<i>Ash</i>]? Rav Yehuda said:</b> It is the star called <b><i>Yota</i>.</b> This name was unfamiliar as well, so the Gemara asks: <b>What is <i>Yota</i>?</b> There is disagreement; <b>some say</b> that <i>Yota</i> is the group of stars comprising the <b>tail of Aries, while others say</b> that <i>Yota</i> belongs to <b>the head of Taurus.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>And it stands to reason in accordance with the</b> opinion of the <b>one who said</b> that <i>Yota</i> is the group of stars comprising the <b>tail of Aries, as it is written: “Or can you guide Ursa</b> Major <b>with her sons?”</b> (Job 38:32); <b>apparently it was incomplete and</b> the tail <b>appears</b>"

        [
            "<b>as if it was appended</b> onto it. The Gemara explains: <b>And</b> the fact <b>that</b> Ursa Major <b>follows</b> Pleiades, it is as if Ursa Major <b>is saying</b> to Pleiades: <b>Give me</b> back <b>my children,</b> my two stars. As it is related: <b>When the Holy One, Blessed be He, sought to bring a flood into the world, He took two stars from Pleiades and brought the flood upon the world. And</b> afterward, <b>when He wished to fill</b> the void, <b>He took two stars from Ursa Major and filled</b> the void with them. Consequently, the constellation of Ursa Major attempts to persuade Pleiades, seeking to get its stars back.",
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And return it,</b> why did the Holy One, Blessed be He, not restore the original two stars to Pleiades? The Gemara answers: <b>A pit cannot be filled by its own earth;</b> when a pit is excavated, the earth that was excavated from it is insufficient to refill it. <b>Alternatively,</b> one could say that <b>a prosecutor cannot become an advocate;</b> since these stars caused the flood it is not appropriate that they facilitate the end of the flood.",
            "The Gemara argues: <b>Then</b> God should have <b>created two other</b> new <b>stars</b> for Pleiades. The Gemara responds: <b>“There is nothing new under the sun”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:9). <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> In the <b>future, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will restore</b> those same stars <b>to</b> Ursa Major, <b>as it is stated: “Or can you guide [<i>tanḥem</i>] Ursa</b> Major <b>with her sons?”</b> (Job 38:32), which is interpreted homiletically in the sense of consolation [<i>tanḥumim</i>] apparently due to the restoration of those stars.",
            "<b>And</b> we learned in the mishna that <b>over <i>zeva’ot</i></b> one recites the blessing: Whose strength and power fill the world. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> are <b><i>zeva’ot</i>?

He said: Does this necromancer know what is this earthquake?</b> The necromancer <b>raised his voice</b> and said: <b>Ketina, Ketina, why would I not know?</b> Certainly this earthquake occurred because <b>when the Holy One, Blessed be He, remembers His children who are suffering among the nations of the world, He sheds two tears into the great sea.

            "<b>Rav Ketina said: The necromancer is a liar and his statements are lies. If so, it would necessitate an earthquake</b> followed by another <b>earthquake,</b> one for each tear. The Gemara remarks: <b>That is not so,</b> as it indeed <b>causes an earthquake</b> followed by another <b>earthquake; and the fact</b> that Rav Ketina <b>did not admit that</b> the necromancer was correct was <b>so that everyone would not mistakenly follow him.</b>",
            "<b>Rav Ketina also stated his own</b> explanation for the earthquake: Because God <b>claps His hands</b> together in anger, <b>as it is stated: “I will also smite My hands together and I will satisfy My fury;</b> I, the Lord, have spoken it” (Ezekiel 21:22). <b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> The earthquake is caused because God <b>sighs</b> over the dire straits in which Israel finds itself, <b>as it is stated:</b> “Thus shall My anger spend itself, <b>and I will satisfy My fury upon them, and I will be eased”</b> (Ezekiel 5:13). <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> An earthquake is caused when God <b>kicks the firmament,</b> causing a rumbling, <b>as it is stated:</b> “The Lord roars from on high, from His holy dwelling He makes His voice heard. He roars mightily over His dwelling place, <b>He cries out like those who tread grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth”</b> (Jeremiah 25:30). <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> An earthquake is caused when God <b>forces His feet beneath the throne of glory</b> and the world quakes, <b>as it is stated: “The heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool”</b> (Isaiah 66:1).",
            "We <b>also</b> learned in the mishna that <b>over thunder</b> one recites: Whose strength and power fill the world. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> causes <b>thunder? Shmuel said:</b> When the <b>clouds</b> located <b>in the curvature</b> of the firmament collide with the firmament itself, they produce this sound, <b>as it is stated: “The voice of Your thunder was in the whirlwind; the lightning lighted up the world; the earth trembled and shook”</b> (Psalms 77:19). <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> Thunder is the sound of <b>clouds pouring water into one another, as it is stated: “At the sound of His giving a multitude of waters in the heavens”</b> (Jeremiah 10:13). <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> Thunder is caused by <b>a powerful lightning bolt that flashes in the cloud and shatters the hailstones. Rav Ashi said:</b> Because the <b>clouds are hollow, and</b> when <b>the wind comes and blows across their mouths,</b> it sounds like <b>wind blowing in the mouth of a jug.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>And it stands to reason in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov; as lightning flashes, the clouds rumble, and the rain comes.</b>",
            "We <b>also</b> learned in the mishna <b>that over wind</b> one recites the blessing: Whose strength and power fill the world. The Gemara asks: <b>What are</b> these <b>winds? Abaye said:</b> These are <b>gale force winds. Abaye said: We learned</b> through tradition <b>that there are no gale force winds at night.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Don’t we see that there are</b> gale force winds at night? The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> gale force wind that blows at night does not begin blowing at night; rather, it <b>begins</b> blowing <b>during the day. And Abaye said: We learned</b> through tradition <b>that a gale force wind does not last two hours, to fulfill that which is stated: “Trouble shall not rise up a second time”</b> (Nahum 1:9). The Gemara asks: <b>Don’t we see that it does last</b> longer than two hours? The Gemara answers: Actually, it does not last longer than two hours. The fact that we sense that it does last longer is due to cases where it does not blow uninterruptedly, but <b>it</b> briefly <b>stops in between.</b>",
            "We <b>also</b> learned in the mishna that <b>over lightning one recites: Blessed…Whose strength and power fill the world.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> this <b>lightning?

            "The Gemara asks: <b>What practical difference</b> is there in the knowledge that they are signs of trouble? The Gemara answers: So that we may <b>pray for God’s mercy,</b> that they cause us no harm. The Gemara remarks that <b>this only applies</b> when these phenomena appear <b>at night. In the morning, however, they are insignificant.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said: Morning clouds</b> dissipate immediately so they <b>have no substance, as it is written: “For your goodness is as a morning cloud,</b> and as the dew that early passes away” (Hosea 6:4).

Apparently morning clouds indicate that there will be rain all day. The Gemara responds: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this,</b> that suggests that there will be considerable rain, refers to a case where the sky is <b>covered with thick clouds,</b> while <b>this</b> opinion, where Rabbi Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said that morning clouds have no substance and will not produce much rain, refers to a case where the sky is <b>covered with flimsy clouds</b> which will certainly pass.",
            "<b>Rabbi Alexandri said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Thunder was created only</b> to impose fear and <b>straighten the crookedness of the heart, as it is stated: “And God has so made it, that men should fear before Him”</b> (Ecclesiastes 3:14). <b>And Rabbi Alexandri said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: One who sees a rainbow in a cloud must fall upon his face, as it is stated: “As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud</b> in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. <b>And when I saw it, I fell upon my face”</b> (Ezekiel 1:28). The colors of the rainbow symbolize the glory of God and one may not stare at them.

With regard to the use of the term, <b>to cover</b> his feet, <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> This <b>teaches that,</b> even there, <b>he covered himself</b> with his garment <b>like a <i>sukka</i>.</b>",

            "As for David’s statement to Saul: <b>“If it be the Lord that has incited you against me, let Him accept an offering”</b> (I Samuel 26:19), <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to David: Do you call Me an inciter?</b> In retribution, <b>I will cause you to fail in a matter that even schoolchildren know, as it is written: “When you take the sum of the children of Israel, according to their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul</b> unto the Lord, when you number them; that there be no plague among them, when you number them” (Exodus 30:12). <b>Immediately</b> after God said this to David, <b>“Satan stood up against Israel</b> and incited David to number Israel” (I Chronicles 21:1). Moreover, <b>it is written:</b> “And again the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, <b>and He incited David against them, saying: Go, number Israel and Judea”</b> (II Samuel 24:1).

            "The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> did the Sages of Eretz Yisrael go <b>to that extent</b> to stop Ḥanina? The Gemara answers: <b>Because it is stated: “For out of Zion shall go forth the Torah, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem”</b> (Isaiah 2:3).",
            "The Gemara considers the details of this event: <b>Granted,</b> Ḥanina would rule an item <b>pure and</b> the Sages from Eretz Yisrael would rule it <b>impure;</b> they ruled <b>stringently.

The Gemara explains: <b>They held</b> that they must do so in this case, <b>so that people would not be drawn after him;</b> due to the exigencies of the time they overturned his rulings.",
            "<b>The Sages taught: When our Rabbis,</b> the Sages of the Mishna, <b>entered the vineyard,</b> the academy, <b>in Yavne, Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Yosei, Rabbi Neḥemya, and Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, were there</b> presiding over the Sages. <b>They all began</b> to speak <b>in honor of</b> their <b>hosts,</b> the local population hosting them and their students as guests, <b>and they taught.</b>",
            "<b>Rabbi Yehuda, head of the speakers in every place, opened</b> his speech <b>in honor of Torah, and taught:</b> It is stated: <b>“Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp,</b> far off from the camp; and he called it the Tent of Meeting. And it came to pass, that every seeker of God went out unto the Tent of Meeting, which was outside the camp” (Exodus 33:7). He said: <b>Isn’t this an <i>a fortiori</i> inference?

            "The Gemara continues: It is stated: <b>“And the Lord spoke unto Moses, face to face”</b> (Exodus 33:11). <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Moses: Moses, you and I will show cheerful faces in</b> the study of <b><i>halakha</i></b> to those who come to study. <b>Some say</b> that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, told Moses: Just as I showed you a cheerful face, so too you will show Israel a cheerful face and restore the tent to its place</b> in the camp.",
            "It is said: <b>“And he would return into the camp;</b> but his minister, Joshua bin-Nun, a young man, departed not out of the Tent” (Exodus 33:11). <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, told Moses: Now,</b> they will say: <b>The Master,</b> God, <b>is angry and</b> the <b>student,</b> Moses, is also <b>angry, and what will happen to Israel?</b> Rather, you must restore the tent to its place among the people. <b>If you restore the tent to its place, fine; and if not, Joshua bin-Nun, your student,</b> will <b>serve</b> as Israel’s leader <b>in your place.</b>",
            "<b>And that is what is written: “And he would return into the camp;</b> but his minister, Joshua bin-Nun, a young man, departed not out of the Tent.” <b>Rava said: Nevertheless,</b> though Moses obeyed and restored the tent, <b>the statement</b> written with regard to the role of Joshua <b>was not uttered for naught.</b> Joshua bin-Nun remained as deputy to Moses, and ultimately served in his place, as it is stated: <b>“But his minister, Joshua bin-Nun, a young man, departed not out of the Tent.”</b>",
            "<b>And Rabbi Yehuda again began</b> to speak <b>in honor of Torah and taught:</b> When Moses took leave of Israel on his last day in this world, he said: <b>“Keep silence [<i>hasket</i>] and hear, Israel; this day you have become a people</b> unto the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 27:9). This is surprising: <b>Was the Torah given to Israel on that day?

            "The Gemara interprets the word <b><i>hasket</i></b> in this verse homiletically, as an acronym of the words <i>as</i>, make, and <i>kat</i>, group. <b>Form [<i>asu</i>] many groups [<i>kitot</i>] and study Torah, for the Torah is only acquired</b> through study <b>in a group.</b> This is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina; as Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “A sword is upon the boasters [<i>habaddim</i>], and they shall become fools [<i>noalu</i>]”</b> (Jeremiah 50:36)?

            "With regard to the beginning of the verse: For the churning of milk brings forth curd; <b>in whom do you find the cream of Torah? With one who spits out the milk that he nursed from his mother’s breasts over it;</b> one who struggles with all his might to study Torah.",
            "With regard to: <b>And the wringing of the nose brings forth blood, any student whose rabbi is angry [<i>af</i>] with him the first time and he is silent</b> and does not react, <b>will merit</b> to be able <b>to distinguish between blood that is ritually impure and blood that is ritually pure.</b>",
