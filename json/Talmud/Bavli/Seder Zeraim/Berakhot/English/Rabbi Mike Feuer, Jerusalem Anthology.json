His wife, Beruriah, exclaimed, \"What are you thinking?  Is it because it is written, \"'Let sinners cease out of the earth\"? (Tehillim 104:35) But is it written hoteim (sinners)?  It is written hata'im (sins)! ",
            "Look also at the end of the verse,  'And let the wicked be no more' — i.e. when 'sins will cease,' then 'the wicked will be no more.'  You should rather pray that they repent and be wicked no longer.\" ",
