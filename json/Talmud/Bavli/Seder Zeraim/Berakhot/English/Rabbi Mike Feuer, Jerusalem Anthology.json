            "There were some lawless men living in the neighborhood of R' Meir, and they used to bother him greatly. Once R' Meir prayed that they should die.  His wife, Beruriah, exclaimed, \"What are you thinking?  Is it because it is written, \"'Let sinners cease out of the earth\"? (Tehillim 104:35) But is it written hoteim (sinners)?  It is written hata'im (sins)! ", 
            "Look also at the end of the verse,  'And let the wicked be no more' — i.e. when 'sins will cease,' then 'the wicked will be no more.'  You should rather pray that they repent and be wicked no longer.\" ", 
            "R' Meir prayed on their behalf and they repented. ", 
            "A heretic said to Beruriah :  It is written, \"Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear\" (Yeshayau 54:1). Should a woman sing because she did not bear? ", 
            "She answered him,  \"Fool,  look at the end of the verse ;  for it is written, 'For more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, says the Lord.' ", 
            "But what does it mean, 'barren woman, you that did not bear?' Sing, O Knesset Yisrael, who are like a barren woman that has not borne children for Gehinnom — like you.\""

The Holy One said,  \"Can I forget the burnt-offerings ('olot) of rams and the firstborn of animals which you offered to Me in the wilderness?\"  She said before Him,  \"Master of the World! Since there is no forgetting before the throne of Your glory, perhaps You will not forget the incident of the Golden Calf!\"  He replied,  \"even 'these' will forget (be forgotten)\" (ibid.). ",
