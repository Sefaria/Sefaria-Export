            "Introduction to Avodah Zarah<br>“Avodah Zarah” is the Hebrew word for idolatry.  It literally means “foreign worship”.  Tractate Avodah Zarah discusses the prohibition of Jews using objects that non-Jews may have used while worshipping idols.  The central idea is that once an object has been used in idol worship the object is forbidden to be used by Jews.  There are many passages in the Torah which strictly forbid Jews from worshipping idols and enjoin them to destroy any of the objects used in idol worship (see for instance Exodus 23:24, 32-33; 34:12-16; Deuteronomy 7:1-5, 25-26; 12:1-3).  The Rabbis went further in these prohibitions and created an entire system of law meant to keep Jews away from non-Jews and their idolatrous practices. Throughout Jewish history these laws aided in preserving the distinct identity of the Jewish people.  However, they also were a primary cause in anti-Semitism, with non-Jews frequently scorning Jews for their separatist practices.<br>Rabbi Menahem Meiri, a Talmudic commentator who lived in Provence in the 14th century recognized that Christianity and Islam were not the same as the pagan religions that existed in the time of the Mishnah and the Talmud.  Christianity and Islam are both monotheistic religions with systems of law and many shared values with Judaism.  He therefore stated that most of the laws regarding non-Jews do not apply to the members of these religions. Other Rabbis disagreed with Rabbi Menahem Meiri. Even the Meiri often insisted that the Jews had to continue to distance themselves from non-Jews, based on Talmudic law.<br>Whether or not we agree with Rabbi Menahem Meiri or with his detractors, while learning this tractate I think we should keep in mind the vast differences between the circumstances in which we live and in which the rabbis lived.  The Rabbis were surrounded by a hostile culture from which they wanted to keep as great of a distance as possible.  Often times they were creating a “straw” non-Jew, one whose behavior does not reflect how non-Jews actually acted. This is often a strategy adopted by a group that wishes to differentiate itself from other groups.<br>In today’s world our surrounding culture is thankfully much more respectful of Jewish differences. We do, and should, celebrate and learn from our contacts with people from all cultures, and certainly, I believe we should be respectful of the customs, practices and beliefs that differentiate Jews from non-Jews. However, we should also keep in mind that the ultimate goal of the Rabbis was to preserve Jewish identity and religion. The problem of how we accomplish this today when most of these laws are no longer observed and contact between Jews and non-Jews is great, is probably the greatest problem that modern Jews face.",
            "Exodus 23:13 states, “Make no mention of the names of other gods; they shall not be heard on your lips.”  From the last part of this verse, “they shall not be heard on your lips” the Rabbis created a midrash that a Jew should avoid giving a non-Jew a reason to bring a sacrifice or libation to his foreign god.  Therefore, during the three days preceding pagan holidays, Jews should avoid any business transactions with non-Jews, lest the non-Jew thank his god for this transaction.  According to the first opinion in the mishnah, this prohibition works in both directions.  It is forbidden for Jews to sell, lend or repay non-Jews and likewise it is forbidden to buy, borrow or receive repayment from them.  According to this opinion, all of these transactions may potentially cause the non-Jew to celebrate and therefore should be avoided.  Rabbi Judah dissents with regards to receiving repayment from non-Jews.  Since repaying a debt causes sorrow to a person, it is permitted to receive repayment during this time, since the non-Jew will not thank his god after having done so.  The Rabbis respond to Rabbi Judah that repaying a debt can indeed be a cause of celebration, even if the immediate parting with the money is depressing.  Therefore it too is prohibited three days preceding a holiday.<br>We should note that although this mishnah seems to be of a restrictive nature, it does indeed allow business transactions at any time that is not three days before their festivals.  In other words, by forbidding the conduct of business on certain days the mishnah tacitly permits conducting business with non-Jews on other days.  This was of course an economic necessity; even before the modern “global economy” no people could survive without conducting business with other peoples.",
            "Introduction<br>The tractate opens with a lexigraphical discussion of the word I have translated “festival”—איד, whether it is spelled with an aleph or an ayin. While today Ashkenazim and Sephardim do not distinguish in pronouncing these letters, originally they were pronounced differently. Jews of Yemenite descent still pronounce the ayin as a guttural letter, closer to the Arabic sound of “gh.” This is why Aza in Hebrew became Gaza or Amora (and in Sodom and Amora) became Gemorra.",
            "Rav and Shmuel disagree as to the exact word that appears in the Mishnah which I have rendered “festivals.”",
            "To support both readings in the Mishnah, the Talmud quotes verses that use both words. We should note that the words have different meanings and neither means “festivals.” Most scholars do not think that the rabbinic word is actually related to the biblical Hebrew. Rather, it comes from a different origin altogether (and is related to the word Ides, as in “the Ides of March.) The sugya presents midrash on the biblical word—it connects two words that sound the same but originally had different meanings.",
            "The one who related the word to Deuteronomy, where it is found with an aleph, chose that verse because there the word has the connotation of calamity. It is as if he says that the festivals of the idolaters are actually calamities.",
            "The reading of the word with an ayin connects it to the verse in Isaiah. There it means testimony brought before God. This reading is preferable because the testimony brought before God is what will bring about their calamity.",
            "The problem is that the verse from Isaiah does not refer to idolaters. The word “testimonies/witnesses” refers to Israelites.",
            "Huna son of R. Joshua finds another verse that uses the word “edehem” with an aleph and clearly refers to idolaters.",
            "Introduction<br>This section begins a long aggadah in which the nations come in front of God at the end of days and God judges them for their failings. In a sense, the aggadah’s purpose is to explain why the Torah was given to Israel and not to the other nations.",
            "At the end of days God will invite all of the nations to come forward and justify themselves in front of Him for having observed the Torah.",
            "At first all of the nations come in front of God all mixed in together. But then they separate such that each comes one at a time. As we shall see, each kingdom will come in front of God, one at a time."
        ],
        [
            "The Talmud corrects a small misunderstanding in the previous text. God could not have been confused as to which nation is which. God is, after all, all-knowing. Rather, God separated them out for their own good. This would make it easier for them to understand God’s words, which as we shall see, were directed at individual nations.",
            "Introduction<br>Rome is the first to enter in front of God.",
            "The first kingdom to enter is Rome, for they were the most powerful nation in the world, certainly at the time of the rabbis.",
            "This section answers why the most important party comes in for judgement first. It follows the pattern of the king standing trial before the community does. This is either due to the respect owed to the king or to allow the king to stand trial before God’s full anger is aroused.",
            "The Kingdom of Rome was certainly known for being great and wealthy builders in the ancient world. They come in front of God and claim to have done so all for the sake of Israel. They worked so that Israel could study Torah.",
            "The Holy Blessed One will say in reply: “You foolish ones in the world, all that which you have done, you have only done to satisfy your own desires. You have established marketplaces to place prostitutes in them; baths, to delight yourself in them; silver and gold, that is mine, as it is said: “Mine is the silver and Mine is the gold, says the Lord of Hosts” (Haggai 2:8).  Are there any among you who have been declaring this? As it is said, “Who among you declares this? (Isaiah 43:9). And “this” is nothing but Torah, as it is said: “And this is the Torah which Moses set before the children of Israel” (Deuteronomy 4:44).  They will then depart crushed in spirit.<br>God denies all of their claims as to having done anything for Israel. All they did, they did for themselves. The verses in Isaiah 43:9 which began the derashah continues with the phrase, “Who among you declares this?” and “this” is interpreted as referring to Torah. Thus only a nation that actually occupies itself with Torah will be justified.",
            "Introduction<br>Persia enters next.",
            "The Persians come in next. This is based on the verse from Daniel that says that the second nation is similar to a bear and R. Joseph identifies the verse as referring to the Persians. As an aside, after reading this, I feel that I may have a bit of bear in me.",
            "Like the Romans, the Persians also claim that they have been busy building the world so that Israel can be free to occupy themselves with Torah.",
            "The Persians claims are rejected in the same manner in which the claims of the Romans were.",
            "The Persians thought they stood a better chance than the Romans because they built the Temple (under the direction of Cyrus and Darius, who let the Israelites return to Israel) whereas the Romans destroyed it.",
            "The aggadah assumes that at this point every nation comes forth before God, and each nation’s claim fails. The other nations thought they had a chance because at least they did not impress Israel.",
            "The aggadah mentions Rome and Persia as the most important because their reign, according to rabbinic thought, will last until the end of days. I’m not sure history bore this out. Christianity inherited Rome, but the Vatican does not really “reign” all that much anymore. There are still Persians but not really much of an empire left. Still, these world powers had great influence on world history.",
            "Introduction<br>The aggadah about all of the nations coming in front of God on judgment day continues. ",
            "The nations respond to God by saying that they were not even offered the Torah. This claim gets to the heart of a theological problem—how could the nations be judged for not keeping the Torah when it was never given to them. This in essence leads to a counter-midrash. The nations were offered the Torah but none accepted it. This is one answer to that problem. However, within our sugya, we now have two contradictory answers. Were they offered the Torah and did not observe it? Or was it never offered to them?",
            "The Talmud adjusts their claim against God. God forced the Israelites to accept the Torah. But he did not force the nations. Had he forced them, they would have accepted it. So how can he judge them?",
            "The Talmud now continues interpreting the next part of the verse from Isaiah, “Let us continue the happenings of old.” God responds to the nations that they did not keep even the commandments that they did receive, the seven Noahide laws. Having seen that collectively they did not keep them, God says that henceforth even if they do observe these commandments, they will not receive their reward for them. This is a very interesting claim. I think the idea is that if one does not regularly observe certain moral precepts, one does not receive reward for happenstance observance of them. Reward entails a commitment to a particular act, to make a habit out of it. Now I know that there are contradictory texts out there. But to me, this is what this text is hinting at. "
        ],
        [
            "Introduction<br>Yesterday’s section concluded with the statement that even if the nations of the world observe the Noahide commandments, they still do not receive a reward for doing so. Today’s section begins with a critique of that view. ",
            "R. Meir uses the fact that the verse uses the word, “a man,” by that implying any man, to teach that non-Jews receive reward for the Torah they study and the mitzvot they perform. We should note that this sugya is a great example of the multi-vocality of the Talmud. Within a few lines of text we have two diametrically opposed positions. The Talmud will harmonize these views but this does not negate the fact that both are allowed room to exist.",
            "The resolution is that non-Jews who perform commandments do receive a reward, albeit not one as great as Israel who is commanded to perform the mitzvot.",
            "We now return to the main thread of the aggadah—the dialogue between God and the nations of the world. I think we can see this claim coming a mile away. Why are the non-Jews punished for not observing the Torah? Do they Jews do such a good job? One need not read far into the Bible to find Jews committing sins rampantly. God attempts to find witnesses to testify that Israel does observe the Torah. Stay tuned—the drama continues tomorrow!",
            "Introduction<br>At the end of yesterday’s section, God said that the heavens and the earth would testify that Israel has observed the Torah. Today’s section begins with the response of the nations. ",
            "All of these sources and derashot prove that the existence of heaven and earth depend on Israel performing the commandments. This makes them partial witnesses, who are not likely to testify that Israel did not perform the commandments. The notion that the world depends on the performance of the commandments is one found throughout rabbinic literature. The mitzvoth have cosmic importance. ",
            "God responds that non-Jews themselves can testify that Israelites did not sin. The aggadah now lists some well-known non-Jews throughout history who interacted with various Israelites who did not sin. Most of these are probably familiar episodes. Bildad, Zophar and Eliphaz are the friends of Job who urge him to curse God. Job does not. (Elihu son of Barachel is also a friend of Job, but according to another section of the Talmud, he was Jewish). This brings us back to the verse from Isaiah 43:9 which is the backbone of the entire derashah.",
            "The nations now plead before God, asking God for in essence a second chance. God responds with a famous statement, that even has echoes in the Gospels. However, God does offer them an easy mitzvah to keep. Stay tuned for tomorrow where we see if the nations can keep the mitzvah of sukkah! ",
            "Introduction<br>At the end of yesterday’s section, God offers the nations the opportunity to fulfill the mitzvah of the sukkah, even though the end of days is already here. Today’s section asks whether mitzvoth can be fulfilled at the end of days. Or is it too late then.",
            "How can God offer a mitzvah to the nations to perform in the world to come? According to a very common Jewish idea, the mitzvoth are to be performed in the here and now, today. The end of days is when people will be rewarded for their performance, but by that point it is too late to actually perform them. ",
            "God wanted to give the nations a second chance. This is God after all—He makes up the rules!",
            "Sukkah is an easy commandment because it does not cause any financial loss. This is different from something like peah (leaving the corners of your field for the poor) which obviously does cause a financial loss.",
            "The non-Jews go out and make sukkot, but God causes it to be so hot that they tear them down immediately. There is a pun being made on this verse—the last word is “עבות “which is also used in Psalms 118:27, which is connected in rabbinic thought with Sukkot.",
            "If God wanted to give the non-Jews a chance to keep the mitzvot, why did he make it so hot for them in the sukkah? The answer is that Jews also have end up sitting in the sukkah when it is quite hot. I can testify to this myself—it can get quite toasty in the sukkah when Sukkot falls early in the season. The next problem is that Jews do not have to sit in the sukkah if its boiling hot and makes them uncomfortable. So why blame the non-Jews for leaving the sukkah in the same situation? The answer is that while Jews need not sit in the sukkah when it’s hot, they should not kick it when they go out."

The underlying idea is that non-Jews should convert purely out of love, without any ulterior motive such as justification in the eyes of God or power/money. To be sure that this is so, non-Jews are not accepted as converts during times when it seems that they may have ulterior motives While the Jewish community will not accept these converts, they will simply begin to act as Jews, in an attempt to save themselves at the time of the Messiah.

Torah is “truth”—there is no hiding what one has done. It is absolute, without any mercy. But “judgment” can involve a measure of mercy.

This is in order to prevent one from accidentally transgressing the prohibition of slaughtering a mother and her young on the same day. But again, the requirement is for one day.

In this view, backsliding is an unforgivable sin.<br>Judah says that if they go back to their previous way of acting with regard to secret matters, then we can no longer trust them. They are in essence acting one way in the public sphere and in another way in private. Such a person has lost all semblance of trustworthiness.

Minyomi is not pleased that the sages from Palestine respond in each instance to Nahum the Mede, a sage from the region of Babylonia/Medea, with “let the matter be suppressed and left unsaid.” Abaye responds by saying that there is one case in which we do follow his ruling—one should make a special request for one’s needs while reciting the “who hears prayer” blessing, which is part of the daily Amidah.",

            "Kalenda, from which the English word calendar derives, refers to the first day of the month, and especially to the first day of the year.  Saturnalia was a popular Roman holiday on the 17th of December, dedicated to the god, Saturn.  Kratesis, which was on the first of August, commemorated the day that Augustus conquered Alexandria in Egypt.  Note that I have used the names of these holidays as Albeck states that they should be read.  Medieval scribes often did not know what these holidays were or what their names were and different forms of the words can be found in other versions of the mishnah.<br>The anniversary of the accession of the king to the throne is also considered to be a day of celebration full of idolatrous practices.<br>The final two days of idolatrous celebration are personal:  one’s birthday and the anniversary of the death of a close relative.  On these days non-Jews would make idolatrous celebrations.  Interestingly, Jews did not traditionally celebrate birthdays because it was seen to be a non-Jewish custom.",
            "The opinion in the previous section was that of Rabbi Meir, who held that pagans commemorate the anniversaries of all deaths.  The rabbis disagree with Rabbi Meir and hold that only deaths where the body and clothes were burned on a funeral pyre are celebrated by idolatrous acts.  If the body was not burned on the pyre then the day is not accompanied by idolatry and it is therefore permitted to conduct business with the non-Jew three days before.",
            "As was previously stated it is forbidden to conduct business with non-Jews during the three days before the personal holidays mentioned in section two.  Here the mishnah lists pagan holidays that Jews can conduct business during the three days before and are only forbidden from doing so on the holiday itself.  These include the day that the non-Jew shaves his beard and lock of hair, which refers to a lock of hair grown at the back of one’s head and is shaved once a year; the day of return from a long trip by sea; the day that one is released from prison and the day in which one marries off one’s son and makes him a celebratory feast.",

Note that the mnemonic makes sense only if you remember the Mishnah. The odd thing about the Mishnah is that it lists the second holiday first.",
            "This is an etymological story of the origins of Kalenda and Saturnalia. Some scholars also point to this story as the origin of why we light candles on Hannukah. Holidays around the winter solstice are often associated with fire, as a way of noting the beginning of the days getting longer, or to at least bring light to the darkest days of the year (in the northern hemisphere). There is also a sense here of cultural expropriation—your holidays were originally our holiday (in a sense) and you corrupted them. While there is of course a negative side to this phenomenon, the supremacist ideology it espouses, it also seems to me quite natural.",

If the world was created in Tishrei, then Adam had never seen a long day, so we can understand why he was afraid. But if it was created in Nisan, then he’d already seen short days which grew longer and then began to grow shorter. Couldn’t he have figured out what was going on?<br>The (somewhat weak) answer is that he had not yet seen such short days.",

Don’t most bulls have them? Is there any reason to note that the bull has these features? The midrash reads this as a bull whose horns were created before its hooves. Now there can only have been one such bull in all of history—the first bull. And who else could have sacrificed the first bull—Adam. So Adam must be saying this verse. And why would Adam offer thanksgiving—because the sun went away and the came back again. It’s actually quite a remarkable piece of exegetical thinking.",

Why not say that he has transgressed only if he actually eats of the sacrifice? Rava reads this out of the verse, which says “and he will call you.” But I think that there is more than a midrash at work here. There is a deeper statement—even if the Jew does not actually transgress, the fact that he lives in an idolatrous environment, in a place where idolaters will be inviting him to participate in their celebratory meals, is already a ticket to transgression.",

And when can we assume that it is safe?

The Greeks concede to this argument and Rome and the Israelites win.",

Around the year 10 B.C.E. the sages made two famous decrees concerning impurity. The first is that anyone who walks anywhere outside of Israel becomes ritually impure. The second is that glass vessels are susceptible to impurity. The Torah does not list glass as a substance susceptible to impurity. The third is that around the year 30 B.C.E. the Sanhedrin, the ruling body in Israel, moved from its special chamber in the Temple to another area called “Hanut” which was also on the Temple Mount.",

But this change was not because of Roman persecution. It was because of Jewish corruption. There were so many Jewish murderers at that point that the courts could no longer properly try them. To avoid having to exile so many murderers, the court chose to go into a sort of “mini-exile.” For once their place of judgment had changed, they could no longer adjudicate capital crimes.",

Abraham was 52 years old when he began doing this. If he was born exactly 500 years before the Torah was given, then from the date he began proselytizing until the intended arrival of the messianic age there are 448 years!<br>I think there is also something meaningful in the notion that “Torah” begins not with the “Torah” but with human beings reaching out to other human beings to teach them.",

If the tree “has a root” it has parts that are inedible when the young shoots are edible. These young shoots are considered “fruit” and they are subject the laws of the sabbatical year.

This is similar yet somewhat different from the issue which the mishnah discussed previously, selling potentially idolatrous objects to the non-Jew.  In both cases it is forbidden to sell something to a non-Jew.  However, in this case, Jews are not enjoined to prevent non-Jews from working on the Sabbath.  Rather Jews are prohibited from putting Sabbath observant animals into the position where they will have to break the Sabbath.  In other words this prohibition concerns the animal and not the non-Jew himself.<br>Not all animals are used for work.  Small animals, such as sheep and goats are not used for work.  Therefore in a place where it is customary to sell them to non-Jews it is permitted to do so.  In other places it was customary not to sell even small animals to non-Jews, lest the Jew become confused and sell them large animals, which is prohibited in all places.<br>It is forbidden in all places to sell large animals, such as oxen and horses, to non-Jews since they will be used to perform work on the Sabbath.  This prohibition includes calves and foals, even though they do not usually perform work.<br>Rabbi Judah allows one to sell injured animals to non-Jews since they are clearly being purchased for their meat and not in order to do work.<br>Ben Bateira allows the sale of a horse since horses are used for riding, which is not considered by the Rabbis to be work.  Pulling plows, a work performed by oxen is considered work.",
            "The first clause of the mishnah implies that it is not actually prohibited to sell small animals to idolaters. But there is another mishnah that would prohibit selling any animal to them whatsoever, out of fear that they would have carnal relations with it.",
            "Rav would say that the two prohibitions go together. If it is a place where it is forbidden to sell them an animal, then it is also forbidden to let them be alone with an animal. But in places where it is permitted to sell, it also permitted to let them alone with the animal."
        ],
        [
            "Elazar would say that it is always permitted to sell them an animal. Once they buy the animal, they will not engage in bestiality with it because this could cause the animal to become sterile. In other words, idolaters will have sex with animals, but not at cost to their own property.",
            "According to this tradition, Rav actually agrees with R. Elazar. Thus all tannaim agree that once that once an animal is sold to the idolater, we need not be concerned that he will have relations with it.",
            "Introduction<br>The mishnah prohibits selling large cattle to idolaters. The question is why?",
            "There are several issues that may arise with selling a large animal to an idolater, but none of them seem to really make sense. We already said that idolaters do not engage in bestiality with their own animals, so that’s not a concern (phew!). Second, we might be concerned that they would make the animal work on Shabbat. But only animals owned by Jews must rest on Shabbat. Not animals owned by non-Jews. So what is the problem?",
            "Theoretically, the prohibition of selling them a large animal may be because this could lead to loaning or renting them an animal. In such a case the Jew owns the animal and therefore there is a problem with the animal doing work.<br>But, halakhically speaking, when a person borrows or rents an animal he owns it (this is so he will be responsible for damages that happen to the animal). Therefore, the problem returns. Why shouldn’t a Jew sell his animal to an idolater?",
            "Rami son of R. Yeba explains that this entire prohibition is because the Jewish owner might actually own the animal right when Shabbat begins. During the process of selling the animal, the Jew might give the owner a few moments to “try the animal out.” And then the animal would hear the owner’s voice and while carrying a load walk a bit. This is prohibited because one is not allowed to make his animal work on Shabbat—carrying is work. Lest this scenario occur, the rabbis prohibited selling to idolaters large animals that can carry a load.",
            "Shisha argues that renting something to an idolater does not mean that the idolater has acquired the place. For if that were true, then it should be permitted to rent a dwelling house to an idolater. Even if he brings his idols into there, the house is his!",
            "The answer is that when it comes to renting your house to an idolater, the rules are stricter due to the verse quoted. The Torah does not need to prohibit bringing an abomination into one’s own home—obviously that is prohibited. What it prohibits is to even allow a pagan to bring an idol into a home rented to him by a Jew. Thus renters do “own” what they are renting. Nevertheless, it is still prohibited to rent living quarters to an idolater (in the land of Israel).",
            "Introduction<br>In yesterday’s sugya we learned that when one rents something he technically owns it. Obviously this does not mean that he does not have to give it back. What it means is that while the object is being rented, it technically belongs to him.",
            "A priest may feed his animal terumah (as long as it is animal food) but an Israelite may not. If an Israelite rents a cow from the priest he may feed it terumah—renting does not constitute acquisition so the priest still owns it. Similarly, if a priest rents a cow from a priest, he may not feed it terumah. Again, renting does not constitute acquisition.",
            "We now have more reasons as to why it is prohibited to sell a large animal to an idolater. This might lead one to rent or lend an animal or it might to letting the idolater try out the animal on erev Shabbat. Since the Jew still owns the animal, when it works on Shabbat the Jew is violating Shabbat.",
            "Adda finds a way of allowing a Jew to sell an animal to an idolater. As long as he uses an agent, all of the concerns we might have are removed. Even if the agent lets the idolater try it out on erev Shabbat, the animal will not come to the unfamiliar voice of the agent. And the agent will not lend or rent the animal out because it is not his. Furthermore, he would fear that the idolater would find a fault in the animal and then not buy it.",

            "Rabbah points out that the cases are not the same. One is not commanded to make sure that one’s cattle rests on the Sabbatical year. It is a prohibition that falls on the person, not on the cattle. But when it comes to Shabbat, one is commanded not to let one’s cattle work on Shabbat. Therefore, Rabbah argues, a Jew cannot sell his animal to an idolater.",
            "Abaye points out that what Rabbah says is not true. Just because one is commanded to make sure that no forbidden work is done with one’s possession does not mean that he cannot sell it to someone who will not observe the commandment. Bet Hillel allows one to sell a field for plowing to a person who might plow it because there is a chance that they will not plow it.",

Sometimes one is not commanded concerning one’s objects and nevertheless one still cannot sell them to those who will use them to break a commandment. Such is the case with regard to selling plowing instruments during the sabbatical year.",
            "Ashi says that what really matters is whether we can make a reasonable assumption that the item sold will be used to transgress a commandment. It is reasonable to assume that one might decide to slaughter a cow instead of using it for work. This would not be reasonable when it comes to a donkey. It is unlikely that one will use plowing instruments for anything else. Therefore they cannot be sold to one who does not observe the laws of the sabbatical year.<br>We should note how R. Ashi reverts to simple reason to support R. Huna’s actions. Rabbah on the other hand wanted to find an authoritative source.

The baraita shows that Samaritans are not suspected of bestiality, nor are they suspected of a few other crimes. But nevertheless, there is a custom not to sell them small animals. And when it comes to large animals, the law is always stricter, as we saw in the Mishnah. Abaye thinks it is prohibited to sell large animals to Samaritans because they would sell it to idolaters. So how can Rabbah sell an animal to a Jew known to sell to idolaters?",

            "You might think that a Samaritan will definitely not do teshuvah and stop selling weapons to non-Jews, but a Jew known to sell weapons (or other contraband) to non-Jews might stop doing so, and therefore it is permitted to sell weapons to non-Jews known to sell to idolaters. But there is yet another source in which R. Nahman explicitly states that any item that may not be sold to an idolater, may also not be sold to a Jew suspected of selling to an idolater. This is a clear rejection of Rabbah.",

After all, food is necessary to fend off death. And indeed, this is what Rav holds. If it would be possible to avoid selling food to them, then one should, according to Rav.

Jews were selling material to non-Jews that could be used as a weapon. R. Ashi explains that such material is sold to Persians who protect the Jews.<br>This sugya has some interesting ramifications for the question as to whether or not it is permitted to sell weapons. One way of reading the sugya is that it is prohibited to sell weapons only to those who might use them against Jews. Jews (Israel) can sell weapons freely to others who fight each other. But the sugya might possibly be read more expansively as prohibiting selling weapons to anyone who would use them offensively.",

Thus a non-Jew may come to hold on to them. Another Jew would then see the non-Jew in possession of the animal and come to believe that it is permitted to sell animals to non-Jews.<br>Judah responds that maimed female animals cannot be bred.

First of all, they are weapons. Second of all, they are considered large animals.",

The second bribe they paid was to allow them to give them a dead ox, which obviously cannot be sacrificed. Now, since they already bribed the Romans that the ox should be presented the day after their festival, what does it matter whether the ox is dead or alive?

This is based on a pun on the verb. “Mezimmah” which I have translated as “foresight” but be read as “from licentiousness.” Thus the verse could be rendered, “you will be protected from licentiousness.”"

Hanina only studied Torah and did not occupy himself with “gemilut hasadim.”<br>The Talmud adds in here a general accusation against a person who only studies Torah and does not occupy himself with “gemilut hasadim.” One who only studies Torah is akin to one who has no God.

Meir still runs away to Babylonia. There are two suggestions as to why he runs away. The first is due to the incident described above. The second is due to “the incident about Beruria.” This is not explained anywhere in the Talmud. Rashi adds the following legend. Beruriah made light of the Talmudic assertion that women are “light-minded.” To vindicate the Talmudic maxim, Rabbi Meir sent one of his students to seduce her. Though she initially resisted the student’s advances, she eventually acceded to them. When she realized what she had done she committed suicide out of shame.<br>I should emphasize that this legend is not in the Talmud itself; it is found only in the commentary of Rashi. It is likely that someone (I do not imagine Rashi himself) made this up as a mirror image of Beruriah’s sister. Beruriah is known elsewhere for being learned in matters of Torah. Someone may have invented this text as a way of deterring women from studying Torah. Such study, in the eyes of the author of the legend, will lead to women taking Talmudic learning lightly, for the tradition itself deprecates women. This will eventually lead them to become sexually licentious. Whereas Beruriah’s sister, who does not seem to be learned, cannot be seduced, Beruriah, the learned one, is seduced. Whereas Beruriah’s sister escapes both shame and death, Beruriah is shamed and as a result takes her own life. Note that this is not a case of martyrdom—the martyr does not take his own life.<br>The tale has strong misogynist tones and probably was composed by a man who wanted to offer women a cautionary tale—do not become learned like Beruriah.",

Why couldn’t we have learned one case from the other?<br>The first point they make is that if we knew only of the first dispute we might have thought that R. Meir prohibits selling the tree before it is felled, because the non-Jew would not lose out by leaving the tree in the ground. But when it comes to the grain, if the grain is ripe, it must be harvested immediately. Therefore, R. Meir might agree that the Jew can sell it unharvested. The baraita teaches us that R. Meir still disagrees.",

Meir that he shouldn’t sell it unharvested to the non-Jew, for the non-Jew will hold on to the land for a long time. That is why the baraita tells us that R. Judah still allows one to leave it in the soil.",

But if he sells an animal on condition that it be slaughtered, he will have little leverage. The non-Jew might hold on to it for a long period of time, and perhaps work the animal on Shabbat.

This is true of houses and even truer with regard to fields, for with fields there is the added problem of tithes. Once a Jew sells his field to a non-Jew the field’s produce is not liable for tithing. In this way, the sale reduces the holiness of the field. In Syria, which is adjacent to Israel and was conquered by David but is not considered fully a part of Israel, we can be slightly more lenient. Houses may be rented to non-Jews, but fields still may not, because the produce grown in Syria is still subject to tithes. Outside of the land, a Jew may sell houses, but he still may not sell fields, lest by habit he come to sell fields in the land of Israel as well.\n"

            "In all of these cases, Rabbi Yose is slightly more lenient. Inside of Israel he allows the renting of houses, but not fields. In Syria he allows the sale of houses and the renting of fields and outside of the land, both may be sold. Note that he is still consistent in that the rules are stricter with fields than with houses. The major difference is that he does not rule more strictly in cases that should be permitted (such as selling fields outside of the land) but were forbidden by Rabbi Meir lest one come to sell something that really should not be sold.",
            "Although in the previous mishnah we learned that in certain places it is permitted to let a house to an idolater (in Syria according to Rabbi Meir, and in the land of Israel according to Rabbi Yose), this permission is not granted if the idolater is renting the house as a residence. Since the idolater will bring his idols into the house, this would violate the prohibition of allowing idols into one’s home. The idolater may only rent the house from the Jew to use for storage or other non-residential usage. [The Jerusalem Talmud rules that outside of the land of Israel it is permitted to sell or let houses to idolaters even for the purpose of residence. Although in this case too the idolater will bring idols into the house and seemingly thereby cause the Jew to violate the commandment in Deut. 7:26, the essential meaning of the verse is that it is forbidden for a Jew to bring idols into his own house. The halacha is more strict inside the land of Israel and in bordering areas because it is incumbent upon Jews to cleanse the land of idol worship.]",

There are two reasons not to sell them a field—1) It gives them a foothold in the land; 2) The produce becomes exempt from tithes. But there are also two reasons not to sell them a house—1) It gives them a foothold in the land; 2) The house becomes exempt from a mezuzah. So why is it more obvious with regard to a field than a house. R. Mesharsheya answers that there is no obligation for houses in Israel to have mezuzot. The obligation falls on the person, not on the house. ",

In principle, this should be permitted because this is not the land of Israel. But it is prohibited lest someone come to sell them houses in Israel itself. But the prohibition does not extend to letting them houses, because the prohibition of renting a house in Israel is itself only a safeguard against selling them houses. There is a principle that we do not make a decree not to do something lest someone do something else that is only prohibited by a decree and not by a principle. ",

The resolution is that this mishnah considers Syria to be part of Israel even though it was only conquered by an individual (David). Thus the rules concerning selling them land could apply in principle. When it comes to renting them a field, the rabbis ruled strictly because there are two problems (giving them a foothold and tithes), but renting a house, where there is only one problem (giving them a foothold), is permitted.

Of course there is no way of empirically testing such a statement. But it is nevertheless an interesting conception of Torah—Torah changes the essential inner being of a person.

Did they watch every cow just in case it would have a red heifer? R. Kahana offers a solution—pass a red cup (of wine?) in front of her while he was mating. This would magically create a red heifer!

The answer is that even two non-red hairs on the entire animal disqualify it. While it is evidently easy to produce a mostly red heifer, an exclusively red heifer is difficulty. So now comes the final and obvious difficulty—why do we need non-Jews to produce the red heifer. If all you need is the red cup trick, then we could just make our own red heifer? The answer is that the trick only works with certain breeds of cows, and evidently those breeds are possessed by the non-Jews.

If it were considered to be an integral part of the animal, it would have been prohibited. Since it is not forbidden in this case then by comparison the rennet used to make cheese should not make the cheese forbidden to Jews, even though it comes from an animal that was improperly slaughtered.<br> At this point the mishnah offers an aside. The statement that the rennet of a whole burnt offering may be consumed by a priest was only Rabbi Ishmael’s opinion. The Rabbis did not agree with him.

The only difference in the Hebrew is the vocalization; the consonants are exactly the same. Rabbi Ishmael responds that he vocalizes it to be a masculine pronoun. In other words the speaker is feminine and she is speaking to a male. Rabbi Joshua points out that this is surely wrong for the word “your ointments” is masculine. Although this word too can be vocalized to be feminine, the fact that the end of the verse refers to maidens loving him proves that the one being spoken to is male.<br>Scholars have attempted to connect the meaning of this section with the previous topic of cheese. The “masculine” version of the verse gives priority to the written Torah, which would prohibit cheese only if it uses non-kosher ingredients, such as nevelah. R. Joshua is arguing that if cheese is prohibited, it must be prohibited on these grounds. The feminine version of the verse prioritizes the oral Torah, that created by the rabbis. Thus R.

Thus if all glazed vessels used with hametz are prohibited on Pesah, so too are glazed vessels used with idolatrous wine. ",

The second “minority” is that the cheese may be made from animals besides calves. Thus only some of the cheese is made from calves, and only a minority of calves are slaughtered for idolatry.

The dung of an ox that has been sentenced to be stoned (for murder) evidently has value, despite the fact that one may not derive benefit from the ox. In contrast, the dung of an animal used for idolatry does not have value. Therefore, this act of betrothal is invalid.",

Therefore, there dung is something he wanted and it has value. But when it comes to an ox sentenced to be stoned, the owner certainly does not care that they be fattened. Therefore, this dung is unwanted and has no value.",

When it comes to idolatrous objects (things that are proscribed), the word used is “anything.” One may not benefit from anything that comes from idolatry. But when it comes to the ox, the word is “flesh.” One may not derive benefit from its flesh, but one may derive benefit from other parts of the ox.",

Ishmael that he should not ask too many questions about the prohibition of Gentile cheese, for this cheese was a new prohibition of the rabbis.

Originally R. Joshua thought that Gentile cheese was prohibited because they used rennet from nevelah animals. But then R. Joshua realized that rennet does not have the status of the animal from which it comes. Rennet from a sacrificial animal can be swallowed (if the priest has an iron stomach). At this stage, R. Joshua allowed cheese curdled with rennet but not cheese curdled with stomach lining (real flesh). Thus the mishnah in Hullin does not reflect R.

Rather the Sages prohibited a Jew from eating non-Jewish bread or oil in order to prevent Jews from socializing with non-Jews.

Not eating Gentile bread was simply a means of keeping Jews away from non-Jews. It is not like wine, which is sometimes used in idolatrous ceremonies, nor is it like cheese, that might have non-kosher ingredients. It would be more like beer (yum!) which is also prohibited only because of fraternization. From the early medieval period, Ashkenazi Jews were not strict about this prohibition.

In private this was not prohibited, until the rabbis came along and prohibited it there as well.",

            "The two rabbis here attribute the prohibition of sex with a non-Jewish woman to the Hasmoneans, who lived about 150 years before Shammai and Hillel. These rabbis use some strong rhetoric with regard to this prohibition, making it akin to several grave sins. The difference between the two is only with regard to the last one. R. Dimi says it is as if she is married. Ravin says it is as if she is a “zonah” which technically is a woman prohibited to a priest.",
            "The Talmud resolves the difficulty by saying that originally only intercourse was prohibited. Shammai and Hillel prohibited being alone with a non-Jewish woman, for they feared that this would lead to intercourse. Note that there are extensive rules preventing for the most part Jewish men and women from being alone in the same room.",

This occurred in the wake of the David and Bathsheba affair.<br>The Talmud answers that the prohibition of seclusion with a Jewish woman is indeed from David’s time. However, it was not yet prohibited for a Jewish man to be secluded with a non-Jewish woman. This was prohibited by Shammai and Hillel’s students.",

It also talks about sex with very young girls, and while I do not believe that the rabbis approved of this, the text does not condemn it.",
            "The rabbis feared not only intercourse between Jewish men and non-Jewish women, but also between Jewish men and non-Jewish men. They therefore decreed that non-Jewish male children convey ritual impurity. They seem to have thought that this was a way to keep the boys from playing together.",

The decision was the latter."

Just that it is physically possible. I know that this is not a pleasant thing to hear. But it is what the text is referring to]. The girl defiles as if she had genital discharge at the age at which she could potentially have sex.<br>The Talmud perceives this to be obvious. Of course, the rules are the same. After all, if she can have sex, then she could be defiled by the male seminal discharge, and this is possible at the age of three.<br>They answer with what seems a bit of a strange answer. A boy at the age of 9 is not only physically capable of having sex, he can convince a girl to have sex with him (not the boys I know). Whereas a girl at the age of three does not even know what sex is. She could not and would not persuade others to have sex. She might be able to have sex, but she certainly cannot initiate it. Therefore I might not have taught this analogy, and thus Ravina needed to assert it.",

Therefore if he dies at night, she is not divorced.",

Judah Nesia’ says that in this case the date proves that his intent is for the divorce to go into effect  retroactively once the sun comes out. It is like saying, “From today if I die.” So even if he dies at night, she is divorced. The other rabbis hold that that this is like saying “when the sun comes out.” So if he dies at night, the divorce never went into effect.<br>People may be wondering what all this hullabaloo is about—after all, she is either a widow or a divorcee.

One who comes into contact with such a person is not defiled. The rabbis added that he too is defiled, but then Yose b. Yoezer came and restored the law to the more lenient, biblical law. That is why they called him a “permitter.”",

The verse that says he shall be impure, which means seven days, refers to a person who touches another person who is still in contact with the dead body. And the verse that says that he is only impure until evening refers to one who is no longer in contact with a dead body.",

Yoezer said that made him seem overly lenient—he stated that cases of doubtful impurity in the public domain should be ruled leniently.",

We take these suspicions seriously only when she may have been defiled (had adultery) in the private domain. So too when it comes to doubtful cases of defilement, they are ruled impure only the potential contact occurred in the private domain. Thus we have here the same problem we had before. Yose b.

Cooked food is “civilized” and therefore sharing it is sharing “civilization.” Uncooked food is different and therefore there is no problem for a Jew to eat uncooked food given to her by a non-Jew. As we shall see, the rabbis were relatively lenient with this rule, seeming to observe it in a very technical sense. My assumption is that they were lenient because they did not really worry that eating cooked food together would be sufficient to lead to assimilation.",

The role of fire in creating civilization is something that both evolutionary biologists and anthropologists have noted. It is likely that one of the major shifts in primate evolution occurred when human beings (homo something or other) learned to cook their meat. This allowed them to digest far more calories, which allowed their brains to grow and for them to evolve in very different directions from other primates. No other animal has the ability to manipulate fire and most animals fear fire (think of Shere Khan from Jungle Book). Thus manipulation of fire is quintessentially human. Once food has been cooked by fire it is out of the animal realm and in the civilized realm.",

In cases like this, where the intention was not to cook but to clear some unwanted thing away, the cooked food should not be prohibited. ",

But if the food was not yet cooked, then if the non-Jew does turn it over on the coals then the food is prohibited. This contradicts what Shmuel said before.<br>The resolution is that R. Yohanan was referring to a case where the non-Jew essentially began the cooking process by putting the pot in the oven. The Jew only put the food into the pot.

My impression is that amoraic rabbis inherited a series of prohibitions that were created during a period in which there was a real fear of assimilation. Many of these prohibitions seem likely to have been created as early as the Second Temple period, when Hellenism was at its height. By amoraic times Jewish identity had more fully coalesced and those Jews who remained within the fold were not threatened by eating food cooked by non-Jews.

It is probably significant that this story occurs in this particular location. The Exilarch was the political leader of the community and as such would have had the most contact with non-Jews.

Indeed, the laws of conversion were probably patterned after these laws. So if a woman who grew up as an am ha’aretz married a haver (pretty remarkable in and of itself) she must accept upon herself these responsibilities. So too with a slave joining a haver’s household. The trust her husband has does not accrue to her immediately.<br>But if a woman marries out—meaning she marries an am ha’aretz, R. Meir says that she maintains her reliability as haver. R. Judah says she does not. Since she grew up as a haver, she never had to accept this responsibility on herself. But now she does. R. Shimon b. Elazar cleverly illustrates how a woman can move from being married to a haver, considered an honorable, trustworthy person, can lose her level of piety by being married to a tax collector, a position considered somewhat disgraceful in rabbinic society, associated with robbery and violence.",

Earlier on daf 38b, Hezekiah held that if we know there was wine used to preserve certain foods then the food is prohibited in benefit and not just for consumption. Thus the words “behold these are prohibited” exclude such foods. But R. Yohanan said that if the wine was only used as a preservative, a Jew may derive benefit from the food.

If the Jew is watching over the non-Jew we have no such concern and the milk is therefore permitted. Mixing foreign substances with honey would spoil the honey. Therefore we can assume that the non-Jew did not put anything into the honey and it is permitted. Even though some grape juice may be dripping from the cluster of grapes, we are not concerned that the non-Jew used this juice in idol worship and it would be forbidden. The mishnah also notes that the liquid that comes out of grapes is not the type of liquid which makes a food susceptible to impurities.  As we have learned before (Eduyoth 4:6) food cannot become impure until it is made wet by seven types of liquids.  Grape juice is not one of them. Preserved foods into which it is not customary to put wine or vinegar are permitted. If one can see that the fish in the brine is actually herring, it is permitted, unlike the minced fish which was discussed above. In the previous mishnah we learned that it was forbidden to eat pieces of the asa foetida, since the same knife used to cut this plant might have been used to cut non-kosher food. In this mishnah we learn that since they don’t cut the leaves of the as foetida with this type of knife, it is permitted. Olives that have been rolled out into cakes are permitted, since no wine is used in them. According to Rabbi Yose, if the olives have become so soft that the pits fall out, wine might have been put on them to soften them.  Therefore, they are forbidden. Some types of locusts are kosher. When a seller sells them, he brings them from his storehouse and puts them in a small basket, onto which he mixes a little wine.  Due to the addition of this wine, locusts that come from this basket are forbidden.  The locusts that come from the storehouse are permitted since the wine has not yet been put upon them.<br>The mishnah points out that the same is true with regards to terumah.  If a kohen sells locusts from the little basket, we must suspect that he has dripped wine on them, and that the wine might be terumah, which is strictly forbidden to non-priests.  If, however, the locusts come from storage, we can be sure that there is no terumah-wine mixed in with them.",

Although he cannot see him while sitting, the fact that he can see him some time, will cause the non-Jew, who knows that the Jew will not drink from milk from forbidden animals, will not take the milk from there.",

The first is that there is something really not kosher in it (like pig fat). But this would be bad for the honey and cause it to go rancid. The second is that it was cooked by a non-Jew. But this prohibition does not apply to honey since honey can be eaten raw. Third is the possibility that the non-Jew cooked it in his own vessels, which had been used with forbidden food. But this is not prohibited because the taste from the non-Jew’s vessel is considered “a worsening flavor” and in such cases the substance is permitted. Thus there is no reason to be concerned about honey bought from a non-Jew.",

While originally Hillel said that they were not susceptible, he eventually agreed with Shammai that they are.",

The doubt is over whether it is still there. And again, a doubt does seem to set aside a certainty."

But if one does, this does not count as “trespass,” illegal use of Temple property because we cannot be sure that the nest came from that tree.<br>But if the tree was an idol, then one can use the nest.

This helps explain the whole baraita better. If the tree has been dedicated to the Temple, then he should not use the nest lest the twigs might have come from the tree. But it does not count as “trespass” because the twigs did not certainly come from that tree. But if the twigs did certainly come from that tree, then using them should certainly count as trespass.",

One could say that the twigs came from the same tree that was dedicated but that the branches grew after the tree had been dedicated. This baraita might hold that while one should not use such twigs, if one does this does not constitute “trespass.” But if the twigs come from that same tree, then they would also come from the asherah tree and this would prove that an idol that broke on its own accord may be used. In the case of the asherah tree, it would not matter when they grew. They should always be prohibited.",

He is knocking the next off only to get the birds, not the sticks.",

Fascinatingly, there was a statue in this synagogue, certainly something that the rabbis would not have been comfortable with. Rabbis attended this synagogue, but it does not seem that they were leaders of it, nor were they consulted on questions of behavior there.

The fact that the Israelites worshipped it does not turn it into an idol, because a person cannot cause something that belongs to another person to become prohibited.

Indeed, anywhere a Jew turned his head, he probably saw a statue, often a statue of a god or goddess.

In this mishnah Rabban Gamaliel shows a remarkable degree of flexibility and accommodation to this situation.<br>The story begins with Proklos, the son of Plosphos (this may be the word for philosopher) pointing out that the Torah forbids Rabban Gamaliel’s being in Aphrodite’s bathhouse. Rabban Gamaliel responds that it is not appropriate to respond in the bathhouse. When they leave the bathhouse Rabban Gamaliel answers Proklos’s question. The bathhouse was not made for Aphrodite. Rather it was made for the public use and Aphrodite was  merely placed there as adornment. As such, Rabban Gamaliel’s presence in the bathhouse is not a form of worship to Aphrodite, as it would be in her temple. Furthermore, people do not say that the bathhouse was made to adorn Aphrodite. Rather she is ancillary to the bathhouse and it is the central structure.<br>Rabban Gamaliel further points out that if this sculpture of Aphrodite were truly considered to be a goddess, people would not walk naked in front of her, or have seminal emissions or urinate. Such actions are signs of disrespect, which would not be appropriate in front of a goddess.

He knows that one should not talk Torah in a place in which naked people are found, even if he does not utter the words in Hebrew. But this is not sufficient for the Talmud. They think that even saying this in the bathhouse is not permitted. Thus a tanna teaches that Rabban Gamaliel responded only when he had already left the bathhouse.",
            "There is an argument here over whether urinating in front of the statue is really a sign that people do not treat the statue with sanctity. According to R. Oshaia, it is not. After all, Rava pointed out that people defecate in front of the Peor statue and this seems to be a sign of honor, not disrespect. Thus Rabban Gamaliels’ answer was deceptive.",

But Aphrodite is not worshipped in this way, and therefore one who urinates in front of her has disrespected the idol and thereby annulled it.",

But Abaye points out that it is permitted to enter the domain of an idol in order to take a bath, or a stroll in the garden. The prohibition is only to provide direct benefit to the idolatry. Thus Rabban Gamaliel did not need to say that he didn’t enter her domain.<br>But Abaye himself points out that this answer is not actually deceptive. Rabban Gamaliel is a very important person, a real macher. His mere entrance into someone’s domain is considered providing a benefit. So if Rabban Gamaliel had entered Aphrodite’s domain, it would have been a problem. But he did not. She entered his.",
            "R. Shimi b. Hiyya locates a different way in which Rabban Gamaliel’s answer was deceptive. Urinating on an idol is not considered annulment, according to the mishnah. Thus the fact that people urinate it does not mean that he can derive benefit from it.<br>But R. Shimi b. Hiyya explains that one person urinating on the idol may not be considered annulment. Later, when he calms down, he will make peace with his idol. But people urinate in front of the idol all the time. Thus it is annulled.",
            "Rabbah b. Ulla has yet another answer as to how Rabban Gamaliel’s response may have been deceptive. Rabban Gamaliel claims that people do not say that the bathhouse was made for Aphrodite. But, Rabbah points out, even if they did say this, it still would not cause the bathhouse too become prohibited because items cannot be dedicated to idol worship. Even if they are, they are still permitted.<br>But Rabbah b. Ulla says that the remark was not actually deceptive. While we would not consider the bathhouse to have been dedicated to idolatry, it still would have been prohibited as an ornament for idolatry. Thus Rabban Gamaliel needed to point out that it is not prohibited because the idol adorns it; not the other way around."

However, that which is upon these “worshipped” mountains and hills is forbidden. This principle is learned from Deut. 7:25 which uses the word “that is on them”.

In both cases, the idolaters who worship them must, at least theoretically, be executed by sword. This accords with the teaching in Sanhedrin, that Noahides are prohibited from worshipping idols, and that their punishment is death by sword. We should note that nowhere do we find the rabbis advocating that anyone actually go out and kill idolaters. These laws were clearly theoretical.",

Sheshet argues that the analogy the baraita draws between the mountains and the vegetation seems to imply that just as the mountain was not created to be worshipped, so too the vegetation was not created to be worshipped.

Yehudah who holds that trees that were not planted for idolatry but were then worshipped are prohibited. This view was the topic of some intense discussion in last week’s sugya.",

While we know that while attached to the mountain such boulders are not prohibited, the issue is whether they become prohibited if they become detached from the mountain.<br>The way I see it, the rabbis interest in this issue is not a result of some realistic issue. It is probably not the case that boulders were actually worshipped. Rather the Talmud is asking, in its talmudic manner, what makes something susceptible to becoming prohibited. Does it have to have been changed from its natural form, and if so, how much?",

The first project is to figure out the reasoning for each side.<br>The opinion that permits compares the boulders to the mountain. Neither is something that a human has produced through his own labor. Therefore, just as the mountain is permitted, so too are the boulders that become detached from it. For something to be an idol, a person has to have made it, or at least shaped it. [We might note that the same is true for impurity. Raw material is not susceptible to impurity. There is some but not total overlap between the rules governing idolatry and those governing impurity].",

Neither are considered to be in their original state and yet both remain permitted even if worshipped. So too the boulder, even though it has been changed by being detached from the mountain, it still remains permitted.",

The question is whether the setting up of the egg in an upright position is an integral part of his action in order for it to be prohibited. At first we think it is and that for a natural object like an egg to become prohibited it must first have had some manual labor performed with it. Hizkiyah’s question was whether setting up the egg counts as manual labor. Clearly if he had not erected it, it would not be prohibited.<br>By implication, Hizkiyah would say that boulders that became separate on their own from the mountain are permitted because no manual labor has been performed.",
            "The Talmud changes the assumption as to what Hizkiyah was asking. Hizkiyah would hold that if the person worshipped the egg it is forbidden even if he did not perform any labor with it. The circumstance was one in which he did not worship the egg. The question is whether the very act of setting it up makes it prohibited.",
            "There is a dispute over whether an idol made by an Israelite becomes prohibited immediately or only after it has been worshipped. But for either party, Hizkiyah’s question should be obvious. If it becomes prohibited immediately, then setting it up should make it prohibited. If it does not become prohibited until it is worshipped then there is no question that the egg is permitted. So, Hizkiyah, what are you asking about?",
            "The case that Hizkiyah asked is similar to the case of the brick that was discussed by R. Judah. A Jew set up a brick to worship it but a non-Jew worshipped it. This is sufficient for it to be prohibited. Even though the non-Jew does not own the brick, since the Jew set it up to be worshipped, the non-Jew’s worship of it causes it to be considered an idol. This is certainly true of a brick which is noticeable when set-up. The Jew demonstratively showed that he wanted the brick to be worshipped. But when it comes to the egg, setting it up is not so noticeable, so maybe it does not become prohibited when the non-Jew worships it. Hizkiyah’s question is not answered.<br>For the record, I thought about changing this translation, but decided not to.",

However, the wages of a harlot, if detached from the ground may be used for secular purposes. But an idolatrous object is prohibited even for secular use when it is detached. This makes it more stringent. Therefore, we should also be  stringent when it is attached to the ground and not allow it to be used in divine worship. The rocks should be prohibited.",

But this reading is wrong because that verse has another use. It does not come to prohibit buying sacrifices with the hire of a harlot when those wages came in the form of attached property. Rather it either exclude the red heifer from the prohibition or includes beaten plates of gold. So R. Huna is arguing that not only can the stones be used to build the altar, the wages of a harlot could also be used in divine worship, if they are attached to the ground.

For a full interpretation of this mishnah see my commentary in Mishnah Yomit on Pesahim 6:2.",

The concept of “disqualification” is that once an object has been disqualified it cannot go back and become qualified again. If we apply this concept to the lulav, then since the lulav could not have been used when the tree was still an asherah, it cannot be used later when the tree is no longer an asherah.",

The blood of a wild animal (deer) or bird that has been slaughtered must be covered. If one covered it up and then it became uncovered, since he has fulfilled the mitzvah, he need not do it over again. If the wind covered it, and then again uncovered it, he must cover it. But if the wind covered it and it remains covered, he need not perform mitzvah.<br>The Talmud then analyzes the concept behind this last law. If the wind covered it then the mitzvah was fulfilled. So why should it matter if the wind again uncovers it. Once the mitzvah has been fulfilled, it should not need to be fulfilled again.

Since it would lead to a leniency R. Papa did not invoke it. But maybe he would invoke the principle in the case of the lulav, for there it would lead to a stringency—once the tree was worshipped its branches cannot be used, even if the tree was annulled as an idol. Or maybe he would never invoke the principle, no matter the results.<br>Since we don’t know whether R. Papa did invoke the principle to lead to a stringency, the question had to be asked.

From here the mishnah learns that just as creeping things transmit impurity, so too do idolatrous objects. The type of impurity that a creeping thing imparts is contact impurity. It does to impart impurity to one who carries it (without touching it). Contact impurity is a lesser type of impurity than carrying impurity.<br>Rabbi Akiva learns the impurity of idolatrous objects from Isaiah 30:22, which explicitly compares idolatrous objects to menstruating women, both being impure and imparting impurity to others. A menstruating woman imparts impurity both through contact and through carrying. So too, according to Rabbi Akiva, do idolatrous objects. In other words Rabbi Akiva holds that the impurity of idolatrous objects is more serious than that of the creeping thing.",
            "The mishnah states that if his wall falls down, he should rebuild it four cubits within his own property. This way he is not building a wall for the shrine. But the problem is that this extra four cubits will now, de facto, become the property of the shrine.<br>The solution, the Talmud suggests (somewhat grotesquely) is that he use it to make a toilet. The idolatrous Temple will not get much benefit out of it. But then there is the problem of modesty. A person should not go to the bathroom where everyone can see him.<br>The Talmud offers two solutions. 1) The toilet will be for children, who do not need to be modest when they relieve themselves. 2) Instead of using the place for a toilet, he could put up a fence of thorns and shrubs. This will stop the idolatrous place from using that area and he will still not be providing a good wall for an idolatrous shrine.",

            "If the shrine was created from the beginning to be idolatrous, it is totally prohibited from Jewish usage. If the building originally existed for other, non-idolatrous, purposes, and then was somehow modified to be idolatrous, the Jew needs to remove the renovations before it is permitted to use the building. In other words, the earlier structure is permitted and only the new parts that were created for idolatry are forbidden. If the idol was only brought into the house, the house is not actually “idolatrous.” The idol may be taken out and the house is permitted.",
            "The Talmud analyzes the underpinnings of Rav’s statement that if a person worships a house, he turns it into an idol that is now prohibited to Jews. A house consists of pieces that were once detached from the ground and now are attached. Things attached to the ground cannot become prohibited if they are worshipped. So it seems like Rav says although the house is currently attached, since its parts were once attached, it is still prohibited.",
            "The problem the Talmud has is that the Mishnah says that if he built the house for idolatry it is prohibited. By implication, if he built it and then worshipped it, it is not prohibited. In such a case, since it is already attached to the ground, it does not become prohibited.<br>The resolution is that the house becomes prohibited whether he built it for idolatry and then worshipped it or if he worshipped it but did not build it for idolatry. In either case, the house becomes prohibited.",
            "To Rav there really should be four clauses in the mishnah: one where he built the house for idolatry, and another where he built it for other purposes and only later worshipped it. So why are there only three?<br>The answer is that when it comes to annulling the house as an idol, it does not matter whether it was built for idolatry or only worshipped after it was already built, the tanna of the Mishnah included both categories in one clause.",
            "Ami refers to the second clause in the mishnah. For it to become prohibited he must plaster or cement inside the stone itself, not merely on its outside. It seems that what he is trying to say is that for something to be considered an idol, it must be an idol “on the inside.” Almost the same way we treat human beings—our identity is formed more by our inside, than by our external features.",
            "The Talmud raises a difficulty on R. Ami. In the mishnah, stones seem to be analogous with the house. Since when it comes to the house, the plastering was on the outside and yet it was prohibited, so too when it comes to the stones. Even though the plastering is on the outside, the stones should be prohibited.<br>The solution is that when it comes to the house, there is plastering on the inside too, between the bricks.<br>The problem with this solution is that the Mishnah might be dealing with a case where the house was first plastered to be a regular house, and then was again plastered for it to be an idolatrous shrine. Such a house would be prohibited even though the plastering was on the outside.",
            "Ami was not referring to the forming of the stone but to its annulment. What he said was that even if the person had put the plaster or tile in the stone, if he removes it the stone goes back to being permitted (it is annulled). We might have thought that since the plaster was in the stone, it was like making the stone for idolatrous purposes, so R. Ami teaches us that it is not."

The disagreement is only over whether the part that grew before it was worshipped is also prohibited. So why then say that Shmuel agrees only with R. Yose b. Judah?<br>The essence of this section is really a discussion of the dispute between R. Yose b. Judah and the sages. Do the sages hold that even the new growth is prohibited (like Shmuel impl ies)?Does R. Yose b. Judah hold that the whole tree is prohibited?",

According to the first opinion in the mishnah an asherah has idols underneath it, but it itself is not worshipped. According to Rabbi Shimon the tree itself is an idolatrous object. The mishnah now tells a story that happened in Sidon, where there was a suspicion that idolaters were worshipping a certain tree. Underneath the tree was a heap of stones. Rabbi Shimon instructed the other rabbis to examine the heap of stones and when they did they found an image. From here Rabbi Shimon concluded that the tree itself was not worshipped, but rather the image underneath the tree. Therefore the tree was permitted for Jews to use.",

The disagreement is over a case where there is an idol underneath the tree. The rabbis say that this too is an asherah and it is prohibited.",

Rav says that if we see idolatrous priests sitting under a tree and not eating its fruits we can assume that they worship the tree. Otherwise they would eat the fruit. Shmuel says that even if they are going to use the dates to make beer, if they say that the dates are for the “House of Nitzrafei,” the tree is prohibited. This seems to have been some place of idolatry. The word is probably Persian. It appears in one other place in the Talmud (Shabbat 116a, where we learn that neither Rav nor Shmuel would go there.

However, sitting in its shade alone will not cause him to be made impure, because he did not actually sit underneath the tree. He is not allowed to pass under the asherah, and if he does he is impure. ",

The answer is that the mishnah teaches that he may not sit even in the “shade of its shade.” This is the shade that goes beyond the height of the tree.<br>The Talmud has now distinguished between the “shade” and the “shade of its shade.” We would think that the rule is stricter with regard to the shade. So if it is forbidden to sit in the “shade of its shade” then one who sits in the “shade” should be impure, like one who walks under the tree according to the mishnah.<br>The Talmud rejects that—even sitting in the shade that corresponds to the height of the tree does not defile. The Mishnah teaches that while sitting in the shade does not defile, it is still prohibited to sit in the shade of its shade.",

The innovation is that this is true even if he sits in the shade of the tree’s height.<br>But now this implies that he may sit in the shade of its shade.<br>The answer is that it is always forbidden to sit in any form of shade. The innovation of the mishnah is that even if he sits in the shade of the height of the tree, he is still pure. To summarize the two versions, which are complementary, not alternatives: According to version 1, we needed the first clause to teach us that he may not sit in the shade of its shade. According to version 2, we needed the second clause to teach that even if he sits in the shade of its height, he is still pure.",

This is located in the juxtaposition of idol worship and “sacrifices for the dead.”<br>We should note the notion that idolatry ritually defiles is not found in the Bible. It seems to be the invention of the rabbis.",

If there was no other way around, then why should he hurry past? It is permissible to walk under the tree. And if there was another way around, then he should not go underneath it at all! The answer is that there was no other road. While a normal person may pass underneath without concern, a rabbi of great eminence such as R. Sheshet should do all he can to avoid it.

Yose to again contradict himself.<br>So a better way to resolve the issue is to say that the rabbis don’t contradict themselves because as the value of the foliage as manure goes up, its value as shade goes down. So there is no net gain and therefore the rabbis are not strict.<br>This is compared with an animal which is disqualified from being a sacrificed. The animal should be sold and the profits given to the Temple. The rabbis wanted to make sure that the maximum profits go to the Temple. While skinning the animal whole would increase the value of the hide, it would decrease the value of the flesh. Therefore, it is forbidden to skin the animal whole. So too here—when the foliage falls its value as manure is offset by its loss as shade.",

Yose, one can use the young shoot to plant a new tree, but one may not plant the nut, because the nut is fruit. However, ex post facto, R. Yose agrees that if one plants a nut, the fruit that grows eventually from the tree may be used. This is because the tree that grows is a case of “this one and that one causes.” The tree grows from the nut, but the nutrients of the ground and water also cause to the tree to grow.

The problem is that the Talmud cites another case involving idolatry. These cases are also “this and that are causes.” The manure fertilizes the field, but so does the dirt that is already there.

Eliezer, the status of the dough follows whatever the last piece of leaven was, because this is the leaven that causes fermentation. Abaye adds that if the forbidden leaven was left in there, then in all cases the dough is prohibited. Thus R. Eliezer seems to hold that in cases with two causes, one permitted and one prohibited, the result is prohibited. The rabbis would be lenient.

Abaye’s explanation allows us to pair R. Eliezer and the sages dispute with the two baraitot concerning the field fertilized with idolatry or cow fed with idolatry. But the simple reading of R. Eliezer is that the ruling depends on which substance is put in last. If the permitted leaven was put in last, R. Eliezer may permit the dough even though the forbidden dough was still present. In other words, R. Eliezer may not hold that in all cases of two causes the result is prohibited. He may hold that the principle is that we simply follow whatever was put in last.",

This mishnah teaches that the forbidden status of the tree remains in the pieces of the tree that are separated from it.<br>If one used this wood to heat a new oven, the oven must be destroyed.  Since the first heating of an oven helps shape and finish the oven, the oven itself was built through the aid of an idolatrous object, and it itself is therefore forbidden.  However, if the oven was old, one merely needs to let the oven cool before using it again.  In such a case the heat produced by the burning of the asherah wood is forbidden but not the oven itself.",

Furthermore, if that loaf should be mixed in with other loaves, they are all forbidden, since each one may be the loaf which was made in the oven heated by the asherah wood.  We should note that in some other cases mixtures of prohibited and permissible goods can be fixed.  For instance if one pound of terumah flour should be mixed in with 100 pounds of terumah flour, one may take out one pound of terumah and give it to the kohen, even though that one pound is not the same pound that fell in.  Through this process the remainder becomes permitted to anyone to eat.  Our mishnah is especially stringent with idolatrous items.<br>Rabbi Eliezer does make an attempt to remedy the situation without causing the loss of the bread.  If he baked a loaf using asherah wood to heat his oven, he may throw the value of the wood into the Dead Sea, thereby nullifying any benefit he received from that wood.  Afterwards the loaf may be eaten by a Jew.  The Sages disagree.  According to their opinion there is no way to redeem something that was made by using an idolatrous item.",

Eliezer was lenient because by the time the loaf was cooked the wood had been burned in the oven. Since the prohibited substance is destroyed, there is room to be lenient and he can destroy the amount of value equivalent to that loaf and the other loaves are permitted. But with the shuttle that was taken from the tree, when the clothes are done the shuttle remains. So we might have thought that in that case he agrees with the rabbis, there is nothing that can be done besides destroy all of the clothes (a large loss).

This mishnah teaches that removing a piece of an asherah tree is a sign that it is no longer being worshipped.  Evidently the asherah was not used by the pagan for anything but idol worship.  If the pagan does make even the most minimal use of the tree, such as using its leaf, it loses its status as an asherah.  The only exception to this case is if he removes something from the tree for its own sake.  In other words, if he smoothed the tree to make it look better, it is still an asherah and it is still forbidden.  If he did so in order to get a branch, he has annulled its status as an asherah and it is permitted.",

Are they permitted since they are no longer part of the tree?<br>While amoraim dispute the issue, the baraita says that if an idolater smoothed off the pieces, they are permitted in either case.

If we think the difficulty is in figuring out why one can treat the tree on the Sabbatical year but not on the festival, this is not a difficulty. The Torah prohibits certain types of agricultural work but there is no prohibition of exertion. Taking care of the tree is not one of those forbidden labors. But on the festival it is prohibited to do all sorts of activities that require exertion. This would include taking care of the tree. So this should not be a difficulty at all.",

On both these occasions we may not prune, but we may smear oil on the place of pruning both during the festival and during the Sabbatical year.",
            "The Talmud now suggests that the difficulty is why placing manure is permitted while pruning is prohibited. But this too can be easily explained. It is permitted to preserve a tree during hol hamoed and the sabbatical year. One need not let the tree die and evidently placing manure on cuts in the tree is meant to prevent them from dying. But pruning strengthens the tree and is therefore prohibited.",
            "The next possible difficulty is that our baraita that permits placing manure on the tree during the Sabbatical year contradicts another baraita that allows this only during the time leading up to the Sabbatical year. During the Sabbatical year itself, it is forbidden.",
            "This difficulty also may be solved. There may be two different kinds of placing manure on the branch—one is to strengthen the tree, and this is prohibited. The other is to preserve the tree and is permitted.",
            "Again, the Talmud tries to claim that our baraita, which allows smearing oil on the tree, contradicts another baraita which allows smearing oil on unripe figs but only before the Sabbatical year, not on the Sabbatical year itself. But again, this is not really a difficulty. In our case the oil is being smeared on the tree to preserve it after it was pruned. Again, preserving the tree is permitted. But smearing oil on unripe figs is to fatten them up and it is prohibited.",
            "Finally we get an answer as to what the difficulty is. It is forbidden to place manure on the tree on the festival while it is permitted to smear oil. But both actions are for preserving the tree—so why is one permitted and the other forbidden?",

Breaking the stick is like slaughtering an animal, and throwing the stick is like sprinkling the blood.<br>Rava explains the difference.

            "Rava determined that the defect of which R. Abahu was speaking was a missing limb. This is because he compares the prohibition of sacrificing for idolatry with the rules governing sacrifices for the sons of Noah. The sons of Noah is a term used to refer to non-Jews who observe (at least) seven main laws, one of which is the prohibition of idolatry. The rules of sacrifice governing them are not as strict as those for Jews, and they may sacrifice animals with blemishes in their eyes. But they may not sacrifice those with missing limbs. Therefore, for the person worshiping an idol to be exempt, the blemish must be of the more serious kind, it must be missing a limb.",
            "Elazar used the phrase “of every living thing” to derive the law that a Noahide cannot sacrifice an animal missing a limb. We know that Noah sacrificed animals when he left the ark. Therefore we can assume that God told him to bring on the ark animals that could be sacrificed. But elsewhere those same words are used to exclude a “trefa,” a term used to refer to animal that has a wound that will cause it die in a defined period of time.<br>The Talmud then resolves the difficulty by saying that the exclusion of a trefa from being permitted for sacrifice comes from the words “to keep seed alive.” The animals that Noah brought on the ark had to be able to procreate, and the assumption here is that trefot cannot procreate.",
            "Some rabbis hold that a trefa can bear offspring, and thus could not be excluded by the words “to keep seed alive.” So then we would need the verse “from every living thing” to exclude a trefa from being eligible for sacrifice, and we would not have a verse for excluding animals missing a limb.<br>The Talmud now suggests that the source for the exclusion of trefot is the words “with you”—the animal must be like Noah, who we suppose for now was “whole” and not a “trefa.”",

At first the Talmud argues that we can learn that he was whole from one of the adjectives used to describe him, “without blemish” or “righteous.” The problem is that those adjectives may refer to his character qualities and not his bodily ones.<br>The Talmud resolves the difficulty by noting that if we assume that the phrase “with you” means “animals like you” it makes no sense for God to tell Noah to take only blemished animals onto the ark. Thus the phrase “like you” must mean that Noah was physically unblemished. We now have a source to exclude trefot, and the words “of every living thing” can be used to exclude animals missing a limb.",
            "The word “with you” excludes the trefa. So then why does the Torah also have to use the phrase, “to keep seed alive.” This teaches that the animals must be able to procreate. They cannot be so old that they can no longer procreate nor can they be castrated. The purpose of bringing them on the ark was not so that they could keep Noah company (a cute thought, to be sure). The purpose was clearly for them to repopulate the world after the flood. Thus while the word does not mean that Noah could not bring a trefa, but it does mean that the animals he brought on board had to be fertile.",

This is because there is an “extra” verse that implies that one is liable for worshipping idols even if it is not in their “usual” way. Deuteronomy 12:30 is read as teaching that one is liable for worshipping idols by doing so in the way that the nations (the goyim) serve their God. This would be the idol’s “usual” way. So then what more do we learn from Leviticus 17:7? We learn that a Jew is liable even if he worships the idol in a way that is not usual to the idol.",
            "The Talmud brings up the problem that Leviticus 17:7 is already used in a different midrash. To understand this midrash I think it is important to see the full verses:<br>(3) If anyone of the house of Israel slaughters an ox or sheep or goat in the camp, or does so outside the camp,<br>(4) And does not bring it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting to present it as an offering to the LORD, before the LORD’s Tabernacle, bloodguilt shall be imputed to that man: he has shed blood; that man shall be cut off from among his people.<br>(5) This is in order that the Israelites may bring the sacrifices which they have been making in the open field—that they may bring them before the LORD, to the priest, at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, and offer them as sacrifices of well-being to the LORD.”<br>There is some repetition here, particularly between verses four and five. To solve this, the midrash suggests that they refer to different historical settings. The first two verses deal with a period in Jewish history where private altars were prohibited, once the Tabernacle was set up. Thus verse four says that he must bring his offerings to the Tent of Meeting. The verse establishes the punishment for not doing so and a verse in Deuteronomy states the warning. These verses deal with a period in which the animal was dedicated and actually sacrificed when it was prohibited to offer outside of the central sanctuary, after the Tabernacle was erected."

            "The verses that follow, from verse 5 and onwards, refer to a case where the person dedicated the animal when it was still permitted to offer animals on private altars, but then sacrificed it after the Tabernacle had already been erected, when private altars were prohibited. Although the animal was permitted as a sacrifice when it was dedicated, it was forbidden to sacrifice it. And even though he offered it on an altar, Scripture treats this as if the altar was irrelevant. It is like sacrificing in an open field.",
            "This is the end of the midrashic baraita. Leviticus 17:7 is the negative commandment against sacrificing on a private altar. There is a lighter penalty in the case where he dedicated before it was prohibited to sacrifice on private altars—it is only a negative commandment. This is unlike dedicating and sacrificing when private altars are prohibited which is punishable by karet, as the verse explicitly states.<br>In any case, this concludes the long difficulty. This verse is used here as the negative commandment for slaughtering on a private altar. So how can R. Elazar use it to prove that one who worships an idol in a way not usual to that idol is liable?",

Since this is not typical Mercurius worship, it is permitted for Jews to use these items.<br>However, if anything that is normally sacrificed is found next to a Mercurius, these items are forbidden to Jews.  Since these items are generally used in idol worship, and evidently also in the worship of Mercurius, they are forbidden if they are found in proximity to the idol.",

Silver and gold are obviously decorative, but for the wood and stone to be prohibited they too must be decorative.<br>Below the Talmud will ask how this proves the halakhah in the mishnah. After all, the list of items in the first half could also be decorative. It seems to me that R. Oshaia’s midrash here originally proved a halakhah that was different from that found in the mishnah.",

The verse that says “with them” implies that anything that is with them is prohibited, so too anything that is “on them” should also be prohibited, even if it is not decorative. In other words, why use the analogy to create a leniency, why not use the opposite analogy to create a stringency?<br>The answer is that if that was the case, we would not even need the verse “on them.” We could derive the full halakhah from the other verse. The mere existence of a second verse implies that one must be a limitation on the other.",
            " The problem with R. Oshaia’s statement is that it does not really explain the mishnah. The mishnah said that a coin, garment or vessel found near the idol are permitted. But surely these all can be decorative! The Talmud answers that these are permitted if they are not placed in a decorative fashion on or near the idol. But, by implication, if they were placed in a decorative fashion, they would be prohibited.<br>The need to limit the mishnah shows that R. Oshaia was probably not explaining the mishnah. The mishnah prohibits items that might have been offered to the idol and permits those that are not considered offerings. In contrast, R. Oshaia prohibits decorative items and permits non-decorative ones. It seems that the Talmudic editors used a statement with one concern to explain a statement that had a different concern.",

Both of these idols are, according to the rabbis, worshipped in an unusual way.

Secondly, if the garden or bathhouse was jointly owned by the shrine a private individual, one could always use them, and even pay for their use.  Even though some of the money may go to the shrine, the Jew can consider the payment as going to the individual partner.<br>We should note that Maimonides explains that “to the advantage of” does not mean paying money as we explained above, but rather giving verbal recognition to the owners.  If the bathhouse or garden is jointly owned, one may give verbal advantage to the owners, and even to the idolatrous priests, however, according to Maimonides, one may not pay for the use.",

The reason is that we can safely assume that the non-Jew will worship the idol, and it was certainly made for idolatrous purposes.  However, an idol made by a Jew is only forbidden for Jewish use once it has been worshipped.  The reason is that we cannot be sure that the Jew will worship the idol.  It potentially could be used for decorative, non-idolatrous purposes.",

Vessels and idols are not the same thing. The Talmud defends this analogy with another midrash—gods (idols) are compared to vessels—neither become prohibited until they are worshipped or used in a worship service.",
            "Why doesn’t R. Akiva make this comparison between vessels and idols? He says that the word את interrupts the connection between vessels and idols. So while vessels may be prohibited only once they have been used, idols made by idolaters can be prohibited immediately, which is his position as we saw in the mishnah.",
            "Introduction<br>Last week’s daf ended by beginning to explain the baraita about when an idol becomes prohibited. I am copying that baraita again for ease of reference:<br>The idol of an idolater is not prohibited until it is worshipped; but if it belonged to an Israelite it is prohibited immediately, the words of R. Yishmael;<br>But R. Akiva says the opposite: The idol of an idolater is prohibited immediately; but if it belonged to an Israelite it is not prohibited until it is worshipped.",
            "Last week we saw a midrash which explained why R. Ishmael holds that the idol of an idolater is prohibited only once it is worshipped. But what about the second half of his statement—that an idol made by a Jew is prohibited immediately.<br>The Talmud seems to think that this is just common sense. Below we will examine the other possibilities as to when this idol becomes prohibited. It’s not really common sense but rather process of elimination.",
            "Since we know (from elsewhere) that an idol made by a Jew must be disposed of (it requires geniza) we cannot say that it may be permitted.",
            "The verse referring to the making of the golden calf proves that as soon as the Jews made the calf they were considered sinners, even before they had worshipped it.",
            "The verse from Deuteronomy 9 about the golden calf might say only that the person is guilty of sin, not that the idol is prohibited. The Talmud then brings another verse to show that a Jew is cursed for making an idol before he even worships it. But this too does not seem to prove that the idol is prohibited immediately, only that the person who makes it is cursed.<br>To finally solve the issue, the Talmud quotes the next word of the verse—the idol is an abomination as soon as it is made. It need not be worshipped.<br>Akiva, who holds that an idol made by a Jew is not prohibited until it is worshipped, would hold that the idol itself is not an abomination. But making it leads to the abomination of worshipping it.",
            "Akiva derives the idea that idols made by idolaters become prohibited immediately from a verse that calls them “graven images.” They are prohibited as soon as they are made.",
            "1. Ishmael would use this verse for a different derashah. The word for graven is “pesilei” and the word for disqualify is “posel.” So R. Ishmael makes a wordplay—how do we know that a non-Jew can annul or disqualify an idol? From the wordplay on this verse.",
            "In its totality the verse reads, “You shall consign the images of their gods to the fire; you shall not covet the silver and gold on them and keep it for yourselves.” Clearly one is not supposed to keep the silver and gold for oneself. But Shmuel makes a midrash on the verse, reading the second half in isolation, and concluding that sometimes one can keep the silver and gold for oneself. When the idolater makes the idol it becomes prohibited and “you shall not covet it.” But when he annuls it, it is permitted and “you shall keep it for yourselves.”",
            "Introduction<br>The Talmud continues to try to figure out the sources for R. Akiva’s position that an idol made by a Jew does not become prohibited until it is worshipped.",
            "Rav Judah uses a verse from Deuteronomy 27 to prove that R. Akiva holds that idols made by Jews are not prohibited until they are actually worshipped.",
            "Yishmael would use the same verse to prove a different rule. An idol made by an Israelite can never be annulled. It must be buried or in some other way removed from sight. “He places it in secret” alludes not to the Jew’s worship of the idol (which is the original meaning of the verse), but to the mandate to remove it from sight.",
            "Akiva derives the rule about removing idolatry belonging to an Israelite from a different verse. The Torah seems to make a puzzling comparison between an asherah tree and the altar. R. Hisda learns from here that just as the stones of the altar (when it needs to be replaced) must be removed (they must be placed in the geniza), so too idols made by a Jew must also be removed. Interestingly we see that a geniza is word used for both the holiest of objects, the altar, and the most profane of objects, an idol. Both are things that we are supposed to not make use of, at least not in our regular lives.",
            "Yishmael would use this verse as did R. Shimon b. Lakish, who based his midrash on the juxtaposition of the verses in Deuteronomy 16. Appointing an unworthy judge is like planting an idolatrous tree. Appointing such a judge in a place where there are sages is like planting such a tree next to the altar itself.<br>We can see here that some later sages seem to understand idolatry as synonymous with corruption and lawlessness. This is an understanding of what is wrong with idolatry that may have resonated more with sages who lived in a world where idolatry had lost some of its muster. It certainly appealed very strongly to post-Talmudic sages.",
            "A vessel used in idol worship was broken and someone (we’ll discuss who later on) welded it to repair it. Does the very act of welding it cause it to become prohibited? In other words, when does this simple vessel become something considered part of idolatrous service and therefore prohibited?",
            "The Talmud now analyzes whose idols these vessels were used in serving. If the idols belonged to an idolater, then there is no question that they are not prohibited until they are actually used. This is because everyone holds that accessories used in idolatrous worship are not inherently prohibited just by being made. Take for instance an incense pan. Such an accessory is not prohibited until it is actually worshipped.",
            "We now raise the possibility that the idol belonged to a Jew. But the question cannot be according to R. Akiva, for R. Akiva holds that even the idol is not prohibited until it is worshipped. Obviously an accessory is not prohibited until it is used.",
            "The Talmud finally arrives at what the question really is. R. Yishmael holds that an idol made by an Israelite is prohibited immediately. So if we derive the rule regarding this accessory from the idol itself, it too should be prohibited immediately. Alternatively, we might say that it is like accessories to idols owned by non-Jews. Just as those accessories are prohibited only once they are used, so too this accessory is prohibited only once it is used.",
            "Why does R. Hamnuna ask about a vessel that was repaired? Why not ask about a vessel made to be used in idol worship? The answer is that he is really referencing the idea that comes up in a mishnah (Kelim 11:1). Metal vessels are subject to impurity. If they are broken they become pure but if they are repaired they automatically resume their previous impurity. This mishnah refers to normal types of impurity, those found in the Torah (such as contact with the dead, a sheretz or a person with skin disease). But does the same apply to the rabbinic impurity accorded to idols? Does the vessel, previously used in idol worship, immediately become prohibited when it is repaired? ",
            "If R. Hamnuna was asking about rabbinic impurity, why did he ask about this specific form, impurity that comes from an idol? Why not ask about other forms of impurity considered to be of only rabbinic status such as the impurity conveyed to vessels by liquids?<br>The answer is that R. Hamnuna was asking a question and a follow-up question. 1) Does rabbinic impurity return when a metal vessel is repaired, the way that biblical impurity does? 2) If we answer that it does not, is the impurity that the rabbis accord to idols the same as other rabbinic forms of impurity? Or is the rule more stringent here because of the severity with which idolatry is treated.<br>After all that work trying to figure out what R. Hamnuna was asking, there is no answer. I bet you could have seen that one coming a mile away.",
            "Introduction<br>Yesterday’s section brought up the issue of the impurity of vessels used in idol worship. Today the Talmud discusses the impurity of foods offered to idols.",
            "When the non-Jew annuls his idol, do the foods offered to it become pure or do they retain their impurity?",
            "Yohanan did not need to ask about vessels. Since they can be purified in the mikveh, they are also purified when the idol is annulled. But food cannot be purified in a mikveh. So does it become pure when the idol is annulled?",
            "If the food is itself worshipped, for instance idolaters bow down to a four-pack of really good beer (hmm, now why would I think of that), there is no question that when the food is annulled as an idol, it becomes pure."
        ],
        [
            "The question is only about foods offered to an idol. R. Giddel said that things offered to an idol can never be annulled. Therefore, this food will definitely always remain prohibited. And thus if it is prohibited, we might say that since it cannot be annulled, it also cannot be purified. Or we might say that since its use is prohibited by the Torah, it cannot be annulled. But its impurity is only of rabbinic status, and therefore maybe it could become pure.<br>The question, alas, remains unanswered. I think by now you are getting the point with these questions. They are theoretical discussions about annulling idolatry, the purity and impurity of idolatry, and the difference between idols themselves and things used in their worship. They are not answered because this is theoretical halakhah, not practical rulings. The various aspects of the question are far more important than any possible answer.",
            "Introduction<br>Today’s section refers to the Temple of Onias. This was a Temple built in Leontopolis Egypt. It served the Jews of Alexandria but did not replace the Temple. The rabbis viewed it, as you might expect, as illegitimate.",
            "Yose b. Shaul does not consider the Temple of Onias to be a place of idolatry, but nevertheless, it is still prohibited for priests to serve there. Any priest who did so may not serve in the Temple in Jerusalem. The question R. Yose is asking is whether this applies to the vessels as well. Or were only the priests penalized because they decided to serve in this Temple?",
            "Alas, Rabbi knows the answer, but does not remember how to prove it.",
            "Both sages here refer to a verse from II Chronicles about the vessels that were defiled by the wicked King Ahaz. To both sages, this situation is parallel to the situation of vessels used in the Temple of Onias. The question is what did these people do with the vessels? According to R. Yose, they immersed them in a mikveh and then used them again. The same could be done with the vessels in the Temple of Onias. In contrast, according to Rabbi, they removed them and replaced them. Thus the vessels used in the Temple of Onias cannot be used in Jerusalem.",
            "Rabbi’s opinion might be supported by a tradition that the Hasmoneans (the Maccabees) stored away (put in a geniza) the stones from the altar which the Greeks had defiled through idolatry.   ",
            "Papa finds a verse that says the Hasmoneans had no choice but to hide away the stones, for the verses from Deuteronomy would not allow them to do anything else.<br>In contrast, there is no verse to prove that the vessels used in the Temple of Onias are prohibited.",
            "The Talmud asks why they could not just break the stones and then make personal use out of them. We can understand that they could not use them in the Temple service. But this does not mean that they are prohibited from personal use. The same thing occurred with coins after the Temple was destroyed. People feared that any such coin came from the gold and silver stolen from the Temple. But then they found a verse that said that once robbers (Greeks/Romans and other idolaters) enter the Temple, the objects in the Temple become “profane” and therefore permitted in personal use. So why not say the same thing about the altar?",
            "The Talmud now explains why the coins could be put to personal use but the altar-stones cannot. The coins belonged to the Temple and were holy. But they were not used to worship God. Therefore they can be put to personal use. But the altar-stones were used in the Temple worship. Therefore, it would not be right to use them for personal needs.",
            "Introduction<br>Today’s section begins with a mishnah that deals with annulling idols.",
            "One who is engaged in idolatry can annul an idol that belongs to him and one that belongs to others. However, a Jew cannot annul the idol of an idolater.<br>If one annuls an idol, all of the things that go with the idol, for instances the plates used to make offerings to it, are also annulled.  Since these things are ancillary to the main idol, they are affected by its change of status.  However, if one annuls the things that pertain to the idol, without specifically annulling the idol, the idol is still forbidden.",
            "According to the Mishnah, which was taught by Rabbi when he was older, a non-Jew can annul the idol of another idolater, but not of a Jew. But when he was younger, Rabbi said that an idolater could annul even an idol made by a Jew.<br>Hillel explains that an idol fully owned by a non-Jew must be set aside, as we learned earlier from this verse. However, if the idol is owned jointly by a Jew and non-Jew it can, according to Rabbi in his youth, be annulled by the non-Jew.",
            "When he was younger, Rabbi thought that since the idol was owned jointly by the Jew and non-Jew, the Jew was worshipping it on account of the sanctity ascribed to it by the non-Jew. When the non-Jew annulled it, the Jew would no longer accord it any sanctity and therefore it is permitted.",
            "When he got older, perhaps more cynical, he believed that the Jew worshipped the idol on his own account. Therefore, the idolater’s annulment would not be effective and the idol would remain prohibited.",
            "The Talmud now offers a different context for R. Hillel’s statement. Obviously, a Jew cannot annul the idol of a non-Jew. Why would the Mishnah need to state this? The answer is that the idol was owned jointly by both parties. The Mishnah teaches that while the Jew cannot annul the part owned by the non-Jew (this is obvious) the non-Jew can still annul his own part in the joint ownership."
        ],
        [
            "This is yet another setting for R. Hillel’s statement. R. Shimon b. Menasya holds that an idol belonging to an Israelite can never be annulled. R. Hillel adds that this is so even if he owns it jointly with a non-Jew. The Jew worships on the idol on his own account and even if the idolater annuls it, the idol is still prohibited.",
            "In order to annul an idol, the idolater must treat the idol with enough disrespect that we can be confident that the idol is no longer considered to be holy by the non-Jew. Note, that the issue is not a physical issue. The mishnah is not asking the question, does this still look like an idol.  Rather the issue is psychological. At what point can an outside observer assume that the owner of the idol no longer is relating to it as a god, but rather as merely a physical item devoid of religious meaning.<br>The first way for the owner to annul the idol is to somehow physically damage it.  If he cuts off one of its appendages, this is sufficient physical damage for it to be annulled.  Furthermore, if he defaces, meaning he distorts the facial features of the idol, it is annulled, even if he has not diminished the material used to make the idol.",
            "Acting in a disgraceful way in front of the idol does not annul it.",
            "If a non-Jew sells or uses the idol as a pledge, according to Rabbi [Judah the Prince] he has annulled the idol.  Since he treated it in a profane matter, and did something that one would not do to a divine idol, he must no longer be considering it to be an idol.  The other Sages disagree with Rabbi.",
            "As I basically explained above, since he defaced the idol it is annulled, even though he didn’t actually break anything off of it.",
            "The verse here describes an idolater who curses his king and god, and then looks upward to the true God. Nevertheless, he immediately looks down to the earth, which Hezekiah reads as continuing his idolatry.

            "The amoraim discuss a case where the idol was sold to a smelter. According to one opinion, the tannaim disagree if it was sold to an idolatrous smelter. One tanna hold that since the smelter is idolatrous, he might use the metal to make another idol. But if he sold it to an Israelite, the Israelite will surely melt it down for another purpose, and thus this is annulment. While the other tanna holds that even selling it to an idolater is considered annulment.<br>The other amora thinks that the tannaim disagree when sold to an Israelite smelter.",
            "Above we said that according to one amora, the tannaim disagree over a case where the idol was sold to an Israelite smelter. The question is whether according to this amoraic opinion the tannaim also disagree over a case where it was sold to an idolatrous smelter. Or do they agree that when he sells it to an idolatrous smelter, it is not annulled.<br>To answer this, the Talmud looks at a baraita. In this baraita Rabbi says that his opinion is correct if the idolater sells it to one who plans on destroying the idol, but that the sages’ opinion is correct when he sells it to one who will worship it, which here is interpreted to be an idolatrous smelter. Rabbi’s words imply that there is a dispute in both cases. In other words, although Rabbi says that his colleagues’ opinion seems correct, he still disagrees.",
            "We now reinterpret the baraita. Rabbi does not say that his colleagues simply agree with him about a case where it was sold to be destroyed. They never differed in the first place. The only disagreement is whether it is annulled when it was sold to another idolater.",
            "The baraita discusses a Jew who buys scrap metal from a non-Jew and finds an idol in there. This is a case of selling the idol to be destroyed. The baraita itself says that if he only took it into his possession, he can return the idol and simply not pay for it. But if he also paid for it, he cannot get his money back.<br>But this baraita makes sense only if the sages in the mishanh also disagree when he sold it to a Jew to be destroyed. This baraita would follow the opinion of the rabbis. But if all agree that when he sold it to a Jew it was annulled, then why shouldn’t the Jew just keep it under all circumstances?",
            "If he sold the metal thinking that it was scrap metal, then he has not annulled it. He did not even know he was selling an idol, so how could he have annulled it. The rabbis and Rabbi Judah Hanasi disagree only in a case where he knew he was selling an idol to a Jewish smelter who would certainly destroy it.",
            "In all of these scenarios, the owner hopes to recover his idol and therefore has not annulled it in his heart.<br>According to the rabbis, when the Canaanites fled when Joshua was conquering the land they intended to return. Therefore, they were not really abandoning their idols."

        [
            "The Talmud now explains why we needed all four of these cases.<br>Clearly he is not annulling the idol by using it as collateral. This is not like selling the idol where he will not receive it in return. But if an avalanche fell on it, we might have thought that since he did not clear the rocks away, he has annulled it. Therefore, the baraita needs to teach that he has not.",
            "We might have thought that when it came to the avalanche he did not annul it because he knows where it is. All he has to do is clear the rocks and get it. But when it comes to the robbers, he does not know where it is, so we might have thought that in this case he did annul it.",
            "Finally, when the idol is stolen he might still assume that whoever stole it would either worship it, or sell it to someone who would. Therefore he did not annul it. But if he abandoned it, we might have thought that he annulled it.<br>Therefore we need all of these cases to learn that in none of them do we consider him to have annulled the idol.",

            "The problem is that the Canaanites whom Joshua dispossessed did not return. The Talmud explains that the baraita means that they had the intent to return. The fact that they did not return is not relevant, only their intent is. We should note that this comparison is probably made so that the rabbis can understand why the Jews had to destroy these idols. After all, if they were abandoned, then they were annulled. The answer is that the Canaanites planned on returning.",
            "The baraita above could have just said that if the idolaters intend to return, it is prohibited. Why mention the war waged by Joshua? The Talmud will now say that the baraita does so in order to teach something else. The issue is a case where an Israelite set up something to be worshipped, but an idolater worshipped it. Although generally a person cannot make something prohibited when it is not his, in this case he does. We will now see that this is derived from the conquest of the land. The baraita teaches us that the laws of idolatry can be learned from what occurred during this period.",
            "The Talmud makes a fascinating analogy. The Torah says that when the Israelites conquer the land, they must burn the asherim trees. But why should the fact that the idolaters worshipped these these trees make them prohibited? These trees belong to Israel because God promised the land to Israel, and if so, how could the idolaters have made them prohibited. And if we were to say that the verse refers to trees planted before God’s promise, then the Israelites would not have to destroy the trees—annulment would have been sufficient (an idol worshipped by a Jew must be destroyed, but one worshipped by a non-Jew may be annulled). The answer is that when the Israelites worshipped the Golden Calf they revealed their idolatrous proclivities. Therefore, when idolaters worshipped these trees, they were only fulfilling the Israelites’ will and this gives them the ability to make something that does not belong to them prohibited. The same is true with the brick. Since the Jew set it up to be worshipped, he reveals that he has idolatrous proclivities and the non-Jew can prohibit it by worshipping it.",
            "The Talmud points out that just because Israelites worshipped the Golden Calf it does not prove that they also wanted their trees to be worshipped as asherim.<br>The answer is that we know from their words “these are your gods” that the Israelites were willing to accept many gods, including the trees.",
            "After the Golden Calf, Israel repented. Therefore, any asherim created after this point should not be prohibited. They belong to the Israelites because God gave Israel the land, and Israel no longer wants them worshipped.<br>The problem is that there would be no way of knowing which asherim were worshipped only after the incident of the Golden Calf and which were worshipped before. Therefore they all must be burned.",

            "If an idolater abandoned his idol in time of peace the idol is permitted since we can assume that the idolater has no intention of returning to worship the idol. For instance if Maximus the idolater decides to move from Jaffa to Caesarea and he leaves his idols behind, he has shown that he doesn’t intend to worship them anymore.  However, if Maximus the idolater flees his home during a war and in distress leaves his idols behind, he may intend to return and worship them when the war is over.  Therefore they are not considered to be annulled.",

Theoretically when God dispersed them, they were leaving in a time of war and therefore the idols in this Temple should remain prohibited, as we learned in the Mishnah. But since they have had time (thousands of years) to return and reclaim the idols, and yet have not done so, it is as if they have annulled them.<br>I’m not sure what this Temple of Nimrod actually was—did it exist in the time of the rabbis? Perhaps it was some sort of idolatrous Temple that lay in ruins that looked really old. The rabbis might have assumed that it came from the time of Nimrod.",

            "The baraita is raised as a contradiction to the previous baraita. The baraita rules that any animal that was worshipped, even if it was worshipped “under compulsion,” is prohibited. At first the Talmud tries to explain that “under compulsion” refers to one who took his friend’s animal and worshipped it. This would mean it contradicts the first baraita. But Rami b. Hama explains that it simply refers to one forced to worship an animal, not an animal that was stolen and worshipped.",
            "Zera points out that the baraita cannot rule an animal prohibited if it was worshipped under duress. The Torah always exempts one who acts under duress, as we learn in the case of the violated girl. This should extend to the animal as well.<br>Rava resolves it by noting a progression of verses. Theoretically, idolatry is always prohibited, even under the threat of death. On the other hand, the Torah exempts one who acts under duress. Finally, the Torah also prohibits desecrating God’s name. To resolve all of these seeming contradictions Rava says that one situation refers to something done in private and the other to a public act. In private, a person should worship idolatry rather than die. But in public, at least when it comes to idolatry, a person should be willing to die rather than transgress.<br>We should note that there is a some blurring here in topic between the status of the animal that was worshipped and the issue of whether a person should allow himself to be killed rather than transgress. Rava seems to be talking about the latter, whereas the sugya is talking about the former. To resolve this we’d have to equate the two. If a person worships idols under duress in private, the animal is not prohibited because the person did not sin. But if the person worships idols in public under duress, just as he should not have transgressed, so too the animal is prohibited.",

While most people probably worshipped the idols under duress, it is possible that someone worshipped them willingly.

The answer is that idolatry and Sabbatical year produce are two special cases, and only in them does the second exchanged object become prohibited. Whenever we have two verses that teach the same rule about two different cases, we don’t apply that rule elsewhere. The idea is that if the Torah wanted the rule to apply across the board it would have taught it once. By teaching it twice, the implication is that the rule applies there and nowhere else.

The basic answer given is that God doesn’t destroy things which are necessary for the existence of the world.  If He were to destroy the sun, moon and stars our universe would not be able to function.  The pagans then ask why God doesn’t destroy the things that are worshipped and that are not necessary, such as idols.  The answer is that if he were to do so, this would seemingly demonstrate the power of those things that were not destroyed.  By doing so God would actually increase the number of idolaters in the world.<br>An interesting question with regards to this mishnah is whom are these idolaters supposed to be representing?  Are these Greek philosophers?  According to the Rambam (Maimonides) Greek philosophy does not believe in the influence that inanimate objects such as stars and planets can have on human lives.  The Rambam, who was heavily influenced by Greek philosophy, and in his book “The Guide of the Perplexed” applied philosophical principles to Torah, claims that these pagan beliefs are believed by the masses, but not by “true philosophers” who understood the unity of God.  He even claims that there are Jewish sages who believe that the stars and planets hold such a power over our lives, but that it is nevertheless forbidden by the Torah to worship them.

When Israel takes another god by worshipping idols, it is akin to a man taking a second and inferior wife. The first wife will be scornful of the second wife because she fails to understand why her husband took this woman, when she, the first wife, was superior. But if the second wife was superior, the first wife would not be scornful. She would understand why her husband took a second wife (I would not try this out at home).

God, according to Rav, allows idolatry to be effective, at least at times, so that idolaters should believe in the efficacy of idolatry, and thereby lose their portion in the world to come.<br>This is a fascinating argument, one that in a sense acknowledges the efficacy of idolatry, and that it is even sanctioned by God.

I of course realize the sensitivity of this halakhah—it seems to be treating non-Jews as inherently defiling.<br>We should note that this is not the only food made by Gentiles that Jews may not eat—we’ve already seen bread, oil, cheese and cooked foods on this list. There are two differences though: 1) the prohibition of wine is not only to keep Jews from intermingling with non-Jews, it is also a result of the fact that wine was a major component of idolatrous ritual; 2) as a result, wine that has been touched by a non-Jew is prohibited to a higher degree than the other foods. A Jew may not even derive benefit from it.<br>For Jews living in the middle ages these laws were exceedingly difficult to observe, and yet, for the most part, they continued to observe them. There are some excellent articles and books by Professor Haym Soloveitchik on this subject.

In other words, while we might suspect that non-Jews offer up libations with wine, they will not do so with grapes that are not yet fully pressed, nor will they do so with grape juice.  Only when the juice has descended into the vat where it will ferment into wine is it considered yen nesek.<br>When the wine does descend from the winepress into the vat, the wine which is in the vat is prohibited.

If a Jew helps him to do so, the Jew is helping to make produce grown in the land of Israel impure. The reason that treading on the grapes is permitted is that as soon as the non-Jew touches them, they are already impure.\n"

The first topic is causing impurity to ordinary produce (non-terumah). If a non-Jew touches grapes after they have been harvested, he causes them to become impure. Note that this has nothing to do with yayin nesekh. A Jew may eat impure food. But there was originally a custom to try to avoid causing produce in the land of Israel to become impure. This seems to have been an extra measure of holiness. Therefore, one should not glean grapes with a non-Jew, nor work with produce with an impure Israelite, for this would be assisting a transgressor.",

But if he did put the wicker basket back in, all of the wine, even that in the press, becomes prohibited. This is because the wicker basket contains some prohibited wine which then mixes in with the permitted wine in the press, causing it all to become prohibited.",

The answer is through a concept called “nitzok” which I have translated as a “poured stream.” This means that when there is an upper vessel flowing into a lower vessel, although in reality liquid only flows downward, we consider the contents of the upper vessel to have the same status as the contents of the lower one. The contents of the lower vat flow upward to the wicker basket and make this liquid prohibited as well. Then this liquid contaminates that in the wine press, if he puts the basket back.<br>Note that the contents are not considered as contaminating the liquid in the wine press. The commentators explain that this is because this is two stages removed, and while some might say that the status goes up one stage, to the wicker basket, all agree that it does not go up to the press.<br>The Talmud notes that if we read R. Huna this way, then we have decided that “a poured stream serves as a connective.” This is a debated issue that appears later on in the next chapter and the Talmud does not think that R. Huna necessarily holds that it is.",

            "The person who asks the boy this question asks two follow-up questions. First of all, when the idolater touches the liquid, does he not render it yayin nesekh? This very question shows a shift from the mishnaic law to the amoraic law. According to the mishnah, the liquid in the press is not considered “wine” and is therefore not subject to the laws of libated wine. Idolaters libate wine, not unfermented grape juice. There is thus no problem with their having contact with the latter.<br>In contrast, according to the amoraim (or at least some of them) all liquid is subject to these laws. Therefore, according to the boy, we must make sure he does not libate any wine by tying up his hands. This is, of course, an absurd resolution and effectively makes it impossible to the Jew to tread with the idolater.<br>But the idolater’s feet will still touch the wine, protests the questioner. Again, we can see here that the understanding of the status of the liquid in the press has changed. Furthermore, it seems that the questioner understands the non-Jews to be defiling the wine in a way similar to the rules of impurity, and not the rules of yayin nesekh. Defiling is done through contact and it does not matter whether this contact is by hand or foot. The boy rejects this concept and answers that wine touched by feet does not count as yayin nesekh.<br>It is interesting that the Talmud attributes this discourse to a six year old boy. I’m not familiar with other such cases in the Talmud (there may be some, but I just do not know of them). Perhaps the idea is that Avodah Zarah is such an important tractate, that even six year olds should know it. In a world saturated with idolatry, where assimilation was such a huge threat (perhaps even more than in our day), this tractate was especially important.",

Natan and the other sages (later assumed to be R. Shimon) argue about a case where an idolater measured the amount of wine in a vat with his arm or leg. Clearly in such a case the idolater did not intend to libate the wine. Nevertheless, R. Natan says that if he touched it with his hand, it is prohibited to derive any benefit from the wine. The sages say it may be sold, but they agree that it may not be drunk.<br>The problem is that even if Shmuel holds like R. Natan, it is prohibited only if he touched it with his hand.

His touch too was by definition accidental.<br>Rav explains that in that case as well he said that it is forbidden for the Jew to drink the wine.

This section is not directly related to the issue at hand.",

This is the opposite of what R. Nahman said. For he said they render wine yayin nesekh until they forget the nature of idolater.<br>There are two competing notions in this section as to what it is about the non-Jew that causes his touch to prohibit wine. According to the baraita it is his ethnicity. Once his ethnicity is changed by conversion, he no longer renders wine yayin nesekh, no matter what is actual belief or practice is. According to R. Nahman it is his belief, his religion, that matters. If he still worships idols, the fact that he has circumcised and immersed is irrelevant.",

However, we know that this was not a “conversion” by choice. It is the only type of forced conversion that is possible in Judaism. These slaves, who had previously served in a pagan home, will still be accustomed to blessing their gods every time they drink wine.

R. Huna responds that Rava himself said that such shaking does not make the wine yayin nesekh. Rava responds that he agrees that the wine that was actually shaken is yayin nesekh.

Nahman responds that it is forbidden to even use such wine. Rava then responds by claiming that R. Nahman said that such shaking does not make yayin nesekh. R.

The problem is that the second half of this baraita uses the word “it may be sold” to rule that while it is prohibited to drink the wine, it is not prohibited to sell the wine. Thus, when the first half states “it is prohibited” the implication is that is prohibited to even sell the wine.<br>As far as the difference between the first half of the baraita and the second half, the rule seems to be that if the non-Jew knew it was wine, we must be concerned that he libated it, even if this is very unlikely.

The idolater has not touched the wine, he has only poured it in order to mix it.<br>Yohanan responds by criticizing R. Asi for his choice of verbs. Mesakho is the biblical verb, whereas the rabbis use the word “mezago” with the zayin replacing the samekh. There are many cases in which the language the rabbis use is not identical to the biblical language. Hebrew had after all been developing for thousands of years. These two roots are actually quite close, clearly related one to the other.<br>In any case, R. Yohanan answers that while such wine is not strictly prohibited, it is advisable that Jews avoid this situation. This is like a nazirite going into a vineyard.

First of all, Botzrah is not Betzer. Betzer is mentioned in Deuteronomy 4:43 and is part of Israel. Since it’s not part of Israel, the people there do not need to tithe.

Yohanan holds that it is prohibited, he must be the one who held that boulders detached from the ground are prohibited.<br>The Talmud again refines the case—the water worshiped here was not detached simply by a wave.

Yohanan would say yes, but this does not mean that he is the one that holds that the boulders are permitted.",

            "According to the mishnah, if the non-Jew throws something in to the vat in anger, the wine remains fit. By implication, if he throws it in not in anger, it becomes nesekh. But when it comes to the zav, it does not matter what his motivation is when throwing something into the vat—it always remains pure. So the analogy does not hold up so well. "

            "R. Ashi says that in the mishnah the cask was not thrown into the vat from afar. It was rolled in and the non-Jew still had contact with it when it touched the wine. This, if it were done not in anger, would make the wine nesekh, just as it would make the wine impure if done by a zav. Thus there is a similarity between the rules governing the case of yayin nesekh and the case of the zav.",
            "Introduction<br>The mishnah discusses wine owned by a non-Jew but produced by a Jew with the intent that the non-Jew will be able to sell it to the Jews, without it having the status of yayin nesekh.",
            "If a Jew were to prepare wine belonging to a non-Jew and then leave it on the non-Jew’s property we need to know whether or not the non-Jew had contact with the wine and thereby made it into yen nesekh. If the house was open to the public domain and there were both Jews and non-Jews living in the city, the wine is permitted. The reason is that the non-Jew will fear that if he touches the wine a Jew passing by might see him and tell the other Jews, in which case they won’t buy the wine from him. This non-Jew from the outset wanted to sell to non-Jews therefore he won’t perform any act that might cause him to lose his ability to sell the wine. However, if there are only non-Jews in the city, the non-Jew does not fear that they will see him and report him to the Jews. Since in this case he is not afraid to touch the wine, the wine must be guarded to make sure that it doesn’t become yayin nesekh. If it is not guarded the law is strict and it is forbidden.<br>This guardian need not sit and guard the wine 24 hours a day. It is sufficient for him to come in and out occasionally. As long as the non-Jew does not know when he will come in and out, the non-Jew will be too afraid to touch the wine for fear that he will be caught. This is similar to the way that Jewish kashruth supervisors work today. They are not present in restaurants at all times. It is enough for the restaurant owner to know that they might show up at any time for him to be afraid to break the rules of kashruth. The words of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar are not easy to explain. The Talmud will try to interpret them.",
            "In this case the non-Jew has already written out a receipt that he has received the money for the wine. Even if he preemptively wrote the receipt before he received the money, in this case the non-Jew will assumedly not touch the wine. If the Jew really has paid the money then it simply belongs to the Jew, and the non-Jew will not touch wine that doesn’t belong to him. If the Jew has not really paid the money, the non-Jew will not touch it for if he does, the Jew will not pay him.",
            "However, if the non-Jew demonstrates that he doesn’t consider the wine to really belong to the Jew until he pays the money, then we cannot assume that he has not touched it. Since the non-Jew still considers himself the owner, he may allow himself to take some of the wine, even though the Jew made it in order to subsequently pay for the wine. The mishnah relates that this case actually happened in Bet Shean.",

If there is a rubbish-heap then people could stand on it and peer into the person’s house (I know this is strange). They might also be able to see in when they climb up a date-palm.",
            "If the top of the date-palm is cut off then there would seem to be no reason for anyone to climb to the top. For this reason, one rabbi permits the wine. But another rabbi prohibits, thinking that the Jew might climb the tree to look for a lost animal.",

If there is another Jew living in the courtyard, then he will not do so, out of fear that the Jew will report him to his fellow tribesman. If the Jew has the key and seal, then he will not be able to enter without breaking the lock and seal.

If there are no Jews living in the courtyard, then the non-Jew is even more likely to go taste what is, after all, his own wine. R. Meir rules that the wine is kosher if the Jew holds the key. The other rabbis require at least a supervisor who goes in at regular intervals. We shall analyze this below.",

Yohanan allow such wine without a Jew even having possession of the key and seal if the sages rule that the wine is prohibited without a guard? Would R. Yohanan rule against the sages?",

According to the first tanna, the wine is permitted if the Jew holds the key. No Jew needs to be living in the courtyard. The sages say that a guard needs either to be  there permanently or at least to be coming in at regular times. Without some sort of supervision, the fact that the Jew holds the key is not sufficient.",

But should it be in a city where only non-Jews reside it is prohibited unless [an Jew] sits and guard.<br>There is no need for the guard to sit and watch [the whole time]; even if he keeps going out and coming in it is permitted.

He might say to his fellow, “If you don’t tell the Jew that I opened the wine kept in your domain, I won’t tell on you in in a similar situation.” But R.

            "The opening mishnah of the fifth chapter discusses a non-Jew who hires a Jew to work with him in the transportation of yayin nesekh.",
            "A Jew is not allowed to assist a non-Jew in the preparation or even the transportation of yayin nesekh, wine which may eventually be used in libations. If he does so, and collects a wage for this specific type of work, the wage is prohibited, meaning that he cannot use the money. Since this person performed a forbidden act for profit, the Rabbis penalize him and forbid him to use his wages. However, if he was hired to do another type of work, for instance bring jugs of olive oil, and while working the non-Jew said to him to also bring a cask of yayin nesekh, his wages are permitted. Since the Jew was not hired to work with specifically with the forbidden wine and the wages he receives are for his other work, the wages are permitted. [If the Jew was told from the outset that part of his work involved yayin nesekh, the wages would be forbidden.]",
            "This section teaches a similar ruling with regard to a donkey driver. If the non-Jew hires a Jew’s donkey to bring yayin nesekh, the wages which the Jew receives are forbidden. However, if the non-Jew hires the donkey to ride on it the wages are permitted, even if the non-Jew brings his yayin nesekh on the donkey. Although in both cases the Jew’s donkey is helping carry the forbidden wine, since in the second case he is not receiving wages specifically for carrying the wine, the wages are permitted.",
            "Introduction<br>The Talmud tries to determine why wages earned from working with yayin nesekh are prohibited.",
            "It is forbidden to derive any benefit from yayin nesekh. We might have thought that since this is so, wages derived from it are also prohibited. But this is not true with regard to other substances from which one cannot derive benefit, such as orlah (produce during its first three years) and seeds planted in a vineyard. While it is prohibited to derive benefit from such produce, if one did use it to betroth a woman, she is betrothed. This implies that there is value to these things even though they are prohibited.",
            "The second possibility for why the wages are prohibited is that the prohibited nature of yayin nesekh is transferred to the proceeds from its sale. So when the worker is paid for working with yayin nesekh, it would be as if he is selling yayin nesekh. The problem is that this is not true with regard to Sabbatical year produce. If such produce is sold, the proceeds have the same status as the produce itself. Nevertheless, if one tells a worker to go work in a field during the Sabbatical year, his wages are permitted as long as he does not specifically state “here is a dinar…” Thus the fact that the proceeds of the sale of a forbidden object become forbidden does not mean that wages earned working with that object are also prohibited.",
            "R. Yohanan says that there is no purely technical rationale behind the mishnah’s law. Rather it is simply a penalty the rabbis meted out for those who work in the production of yayin nesekh. R. Yohanan also mentions a penalty for donkey drivers. Tomorrow’s section will clarify what this refers to.",
            "Introduction<br>At the end of yesterday’s section R. Yohanan mentioned a penalty placed on donkey drivers.<br>Today the Talmud explains that this refer to. As we will see, Rava mentions it at the very end.",
            "The penalty placed on the donkey-drivers is for doing work with Sabbatical year produce.<br>The Talmud will now we explain what the baraita means.",
            "What does it mean when the baraita states that their wages are treated like Sabbatical year produce? It cannot mean that the employer pays them with Sabbatical year produce because one is not allowed to pay debts with such produce.",
            "The second possibility is that his wages have the holiness of Sabbatical year produce, meaning that certain restrictions apply to them. But this too does not accord with tannaitic law. One can pay a worker to gather vegetables during the Sabbatical year as long as he does not specify that he is doing so for “this dinar.”",
            "Abaye says that the baraita does indeed mean that the workers are paid in sabbatical year produce. As to the objection that sabbatical year produce cannot be used to pay debts, Abaye says that they find a permitted way to give it to him. He draws an analogy with second tithe, which also may not be used to pay a debt. One cannot say to his fellow that if he helps bring the second tithe to Jerusalem, where it must be consumed, he will share it with him. But he can say that when they bring it to Jerusalem, they will eat and drink together. So too with regard to Sabbatical year produce, he can give it as a gift to his worker. "

So why is the same not true for the wages of an average workman working with Sabbatical year produce? Because his wages are low. Donkey-drivers, on the other hand, have much higher wages, and therefore the rabbis penalized them.<br>There is one last question though—the mishnah we have been learning says that the rabbis penalized laborers who work with yayin nesekh. But we just said that since workers’ wages are low they are not penalized! The answer is that since the laws of yayin nesekh are more stringent, the rabbis penalized them as well.",

This is not a distinction we read about often, but does exist in some realms of halakhah. It might be that the Talmud just brings this up to remind us that the law is just as strict with regard to ordinary wine as it is with regard to libated wine.",
            "Ordinary wine is as prohibited as yayin nesekh. The only difference is with regard to the laws of impurity, where wine known to be libated has a higher degree of impurity. The question is how do we deal with its status in a third category—the wages earned working with it?",
            "As we can see, wages earned while working with ordinary wine is just as prohibited. The Talmud asks why R. Hisday told him to burn it and bury it. This is extraordinarily strict to make sure that people don’t accidentally come to use the wheat and that he not benefit from it as manure.",
            "Why burn it and then bury it? Why not just bury it? This is what is done with the articles used in execution. As an aside it is interesting that the rabbis say that anything used to kill a human being can never again be used. It seems that there is some inherent disgrace, or perhaps even pollution accorded to these instruments. Not only should they not be glorified, essentially they must be destroyed.",
            "When it comes to the instruments buried with the executed people, everyone will know that these items are prohibited and will not come to dig them up. But with the individual burying the wheat that he gained through renting out his ship, people might think he is burying it just to hide it because he stole it. Then they will come to steal it, which seems fitting since they suspect him of being a thief. To prevent this, it must be burned.<br>As an aside, it seems far more likely that people would come to try to steal the sword for it is more valuable. But rabbis never executed anyone so this source is not so “realistic.” Burying the sword is a symbolic act, not meant simply to prevent others from benefiting from it. On the other hand, the story of the wheat seems to be more realistic.",
            "Introduction<br>Since the Talmud spoke about the laws of Sabbatical year produce, there now appears a story about the subject.",
            "During the Sabbatical year the people of the house of R. Yannai would borrow produce from poor people (who can collect freely from the fields) before such produce needed to be removed from one’s home. They would pay the poor people back after the Sabbatical year, when produce can be sold. The question is—does this count as engaging in trade with Sabbatical year produce. R. Yohanan says it does not since by the time they compensated them, the original produce no longer existed. This seems to be a sort of legal fiction to circumvent the laws of the Sabbatical year, and also to benefit the poor.",
            "The Talmud analogizes the above case with the prohibition of using an animal paid to a prostitute as a sacrifice (see Deuteronomy 23:19). As we shall see below, if he has sex with her and then gives her the animal, the animal may be used. By giving it to her after the sex, the animal is considered a gift and not payment.",
            "The Talmud now analyzes the baraita. If he did not have intercourse with her, then obviously the animal is not prohibited. It was not a payment because nothing happened.",

But if she sacrifices it before they have sex, the sacrifice is valid. Our sugya asks what the rule is if she dedicates it before having sex. Can it be offered even after they have sex?",
            "As a rule of thumb when one dedicates something to the Temple, words have the same power that actually transferring possession does in ordinary cases. For instance, if I say that my animal belongs to the Temple it actually belongs to the Temple, whereas if I say it belongs to another person I have done nothing. So if the prostitute dedicates the animal before sex, perhaps it is no longer hers at the time of intercourse in which case it is not considered a payment for sex. On other hand, the animal is in existence at the time they have intercourse so perhaps it is considered a payment.",
            "On the previous page R. Elazar said the offering is permitted if she first offered it. By implication it is not permitted if she only dedicated it. So this should solve our question. For the animal to be permitted as a sacrifice she must first offer it, not merely dedicate it.",
            "The Talmud says that really the question was asked about R. Elazar’s statement itself. Was R. Elazar being specific—the animal is a valid sacrifice only if it was actually sacrificed. Or perhaps he only said “offered” because he was sure that in that case it was valid. But in the case where it was only dedicated he was not so sure. No answer to this one—sorry folks. I know you really wanted to know.",
            "Introduction<br>The Talmud continues to discuss the case of the animal used to pay a prostitute. I should note that the interest in this topic is not because of the particular case at hand. Rather, the rabbis are interested in these sources because they help illustrate the laws of acquisition.",

Yitzchak resolves them by saying it depends on how he makes his statement to her. If he specifies beforehand that this lamb will be her payment, then it is prohibited. But if he does not specify which lamb then when he had sex with her, that lamb was not designated as payment. The lamb can therefore be used as a sacrifice.",
            "For an object to be acquired, the person acquiring it must draw it towards themselves. A declaration is not sufficient to transfer ownership. So just because he says “for this lamb” does not mean that the lamb belongs to her, in which case it should be permitted. <br>The answer is that this prostitute was not a Jew. Jews, according to the Talmud, acquire by taking physical possession. Gentiles can, according to this passage, acquire even through a verbal transaction.",
            "One can acquire objects by their being on one’s property. Therefore, if he says “this lamb” and they are on her property, it is hers and it will be forbidden.",
            "If the lamb is already on her property, then he gave it to her before intercourse and it should be prohibited in any case. This is not a case of giving after intercourse which is what we were discussing.<br>The Talmud adjusts the situation. He gave it to her only as a pledge if he were not to bring payment. If he brings payment, then the lamb will never have lest his possession. But if he does not bring payment, then it will turn out that the lamb becomes hers, but only after intercourse.<br>Tomorrow’s passage will continue to discuss this case.

Therefore, as soon as the shopkeeper gives the food to the workers, the employer incurs a debt to the shop-keeper and it is as if he is simply buying forbidden food straight from the shop-keeper. This is not like the case of the House of Yannai for they have no set relationship with the people they are borrowing from.",

Hisdah was correct then instead of the distinction taught in the baraita itself, between a case where the employer gave them the dinar first and a case where he paid them back after they had bought the food, the distinction should have been drawn with regard to the shop-keeper’s relationship with the employer. If the shop-keeper regularly extends credit to the employer it is forbidden, but if he does not, it is permitted.",
            "The Talmud now notes that even if the shopkeeper does not regularly extend credit, the employer owes him the money as soon as he gives the food to the workers. This is like the case discussed by Rava. Reuven tells Shimon to give Levi a maneh, and all of Reuven’s property will be subject to pay back Shimon. The minute that Shimon pays Levi, Reuven is liable to pay back Shimon. This is like the case of a guarantor who is liable to pay back a debt even though he did not receive any benefit. So too in the case at hand the employer (analogous to Reuven) must pay the debt back to the shopkeeper (analogous to Shimon).",

            "The rabbis who heard this baraita originally thought that it follows even R. Akiva. R. Akiva is more strict when it comes to the laws of mixed seeds. It is not only forbidden to plant them, or weed them, it is also forbidden to preserve them. Nevertheless, R. Akiva would allow one to uproot them for that is reducing improper things.",
            "The Talmud provides the midrashic support for R. Akiva’s reasoning. Rashi says that the midrash that allows R. Akiva to prohibit preserving mixed seeds is from the earlier clause which actually prohibits one from mixing different breeds of animals. In any case, the conclusion is that one may uproot the mixed seeds, even according to R. Akiva.",
            "The Talmud now says that the baraita is the opinion of the rabbis. This would mean that R. Akiva would rule even more strictly, prohibiting even uprooting the plants.<br>The problem is that if the baraita is the rabbis, why would it specific that uprooting is permitted, for according to the rabbis one may even aid in preserving the mixed seeds. In other words, by saying that uprooting is prohibited, it implies that preserving them is permitted, and this is R. Akiva’s opinion.",

Therefore, uprooting would be permitted but preserving would be prohibited. But if he was getting paid, even preserving would be permitted.",

But then we could apply the same thinking to R. Akiva. R. Akiva allows a Jew to work for free. But all would agree that if he is being paid, he may uproot the mixed seeds or break the jugs of yayin nesekh. The baraita is now back to being a support for R. Nahman allowing the Jew to be hired to break jugs of yayin nesekh.",

            "Nahman says that such proceeds are permitted and proves this from a story of some non-Jews who come to convert in front of Rabbah b. Abbahu. The rabbi tells them to first sell of their possessions and then convert. Assumedly, their possessions include idols. So if they sell them first, then they can keep the proceeds. This proves that the proceeds of a sale of an idol by an idolater are permitted.",
            "The Talmud rejects this case as proof. These idolaters were intending to convert and therefore we can assume that they annulled their idols before selling them. But in a normal case, where the idolater is not converting, perhaps the proceeds would still be prohibited.",
            "This baraita proves that the proceeds of the sale of an idol by an idolater are permitted. However the baraita does prohibit them under certain circumstances. Tomorrow’s section will clarify what these circumstances are.",
            "Introduction<br>Today’s section explains a baraita from yesterday. The baraita reads:<br> If an Israelite has a claim for a maneh against an idolater and the latter sold an idol and brought him the proceeds or yayin nesekh and brought him the proceeds, [the money] is permitted; but if [the idolater] said, “Wait until I sell an idol and I will bring you the proceeds or yayin nesekh and I will bring you the proceeds,” it is prohibited.<br>  Today’s section clarifies why in the first case the deal is permitted and the second it is not.",
            "The difference between the first half and the second half of the baraita, according to R. Sheshet, is that in the second half, when the idolater says, “wait until I sell the idol/yayin nesekh and bring you the proceeds” the Jew wants the forbidden object to continue to exist until it is sold.  Therefore the proceeds are prohibited.",
            "The Talmud raises a difficulty on R. Sheshet from the case of a convert and a non-Jew who inherit from their father who has not converted. The convert cannot take possession of the idolatrous objects or the yayin nesekh. But he can make a deal with his brother—his brother will take the idolatrous, prohibited things, and he can take the items permitted to Jews. This is so even though the Jew would seem to want the idolatrous things to continue to exist so that his brother can inherit them. Thus, even though the Jew wants the idolatrous things to be preserved, as long as he does not actually own them, there is no problem.",
            "This baraita refers to an idol that can be broken into pieces and still retain its value. Therefore, the Jew does not care if it is preserved. But the baraita from yesterday refers to an idol that cannot be broken up and therefore since the Jew would want it to be preserved, it is prohibited.",
            "How can wine be broken into pieces? If it is in jugs then the Jew wants those jugs to continue to be preserved.<br>The answer is that the wine is preserved in hadrianic earthenware—these are potsherds soaked in wine. When people would travel they would bring them and put them in water to give the water flavor.",
            "Still, the Jew does in a sense care that they should be preserved—he doesn’t want them to be stolen or lost. This is another difficulty against R. Sheshet. Again, the baraita about the convert and his idolatrous brother seems to prove that just because the Jew wants the idol to be preserved does not make it prohibited.",
            "The difficulty is finally resolved by noting that inheritance is different. The rabbis allowed the convert to divide the inheritance in this manner because otherwise they feared that he would revert to being an idolater. After all, the loss of inheritance could be a major blow to his finances. But in a regular case of partnership, such a division is prohibited. The original baraita was not a case of a convert and therefore, since the Jew wants the idolatrous object to be preserved, it is prohibited."

            "The ger toshav is a non-Jew who has accepted upon himself not to worship idols (he may have accepted other commandments, but clearly this is one of them). So can he annul idols? On the one hand, the act of annulment seems to only work for one who actually worships the idols. A Jew cannot “annul” an idol, only a non-Jew can. On the other hand, tribally he is “one of them” so maybe the fact that he is part of the world that does, generally, worship idols, he can annul the idol.<br> At the heart of this question seems to be the question of what constitutes a person’s identity—his beliefs and practices, or his ethnic background?",
            "According to R. Nahman, the ger toshav cannot annul idols since he does not worship them.",
            "The baraita says that only a non-Jew can annul an idol, but that he can annul idols belonging to his fellow and it also says that he can do so whether he worships it or not. These two phrases cannot be synonymous for if they are, the baraita would seem to be repetitive. Therefore, the Talmud interprets the phrase “he does not worship it” to refer to a ger toshav, who, it seems, can annul an idol.",
            "The Talmud rejects this understanding and gives a simpler meaning of the baraita. The first clause refers to a case where both idolaters worship the same god, and the second refers to those who worship different gods. One who worships Peor can annul the idol of one who worships Mercurius, because both are idolaters. But a ger toshav cannot annul idols because he does not worship them.",
            "Introduction<br>The Talmud continues to discuss whether a ger toshav can annul idols. The first citation is a long baraita in which sages argue who exactly a ger toshav is. I should note that I do not believe the rabbis really knew people who considered themselves a “ger toshav.” Rather, the issue seems to be both exegetical—who is the “ger toshav” referred to in the Torah, and philosophical—what is the status of a person who does not convert but does keep some of the commandments.",
            "There are a lot of opinions here as to what exactly constitutes a ger toshav. I will focus on the opinion of “others.” Basically, this person keeps the Jewish laws, he just does not want to eat kosher meat. Perhaps the issue here is that fully keeping kosher, especially only eating meat slaughtered in a kosher manner, would separate himself from other people and while he believes in the commandments, he does not want to cut himself off socially from others. This might also be why we can leave him alone with wine—he does not himself make wine into yayin nesekh because he is not an idolater. But since he will have other non-Jews around him for social reasons, if we leave wine with him for a long time by depositing it, it becomes prohibited. In other words, this person believes like a Jew, mostly acts like a Jew, but wants to maintain the tribe of “non-Jew.” I think this has interesting implications as to what it means to be a Jew.",
            "Nahman b. Yitzchak says that the ger toshav is considered a non-Jew with regard to the issue of the eruv. An eruv is a meal shared by all members of a courtyard and allows them to carry from the house into the courtyard. But in order for this to work all members of the courtyard must participate in the eruv. A Jew who forgot to participate in the eruv may symbolically transfer or renounce his ownership, but not an apostate Jew, who does not keep Shabbat. However, if a non-Jew lives there in the courtyard, the Jews must formally rent his place. Thus the ger toshav is considered like a non-Jew with regard to the eruv. He does not “live” with the Jews. However, he may not annul idols because he does not worship them. His “religion” is like that of the Jews.",

The ger toshav has twelve months in which to convert. If he does not convert within this time period, he is considered to be a heretic and one certainly should not give him a gift. We can assume that Avidarna was not circumcised.",

In other words, once a non-Jew accepts not to worship idols and to be circumcised, changing his mind is basically impossible. Accepting these things has essentially made him a Jew and there is no going back. But one can become a ger toshav and never want to fully convert. Avidarna never accepted upon himself to circumcise and therefore he need not do so.",

If one hires a donkey driver to transport him somewhere, what may he bring without specifying and what can the donkey driver bring. The hirer may bring his clothes, a jar with drink and food sufficient for the whole journey. The donkey-driver can bring food for his donkey and his own food but only enough for the day. From here we can see that when one hires a donkey, it can be assumed that he is bringing his wine. Carrying the wine is part of the deal. Therefore, it would seem that the Jew is being paid for transporting wine. But the mishnah assumes that the Jew is not being paid for this. He is only being paid for carrying the non-Jew and therefore it is permitted.",

The mishnah mentions a story of a person who carried figs and yayin nesekh on a ship. When one of the casks of wine broke on the figs he asked the Sages if the figs were still permissible, and they permitted them.  Since the wine does not improve the flavor of the figs, the person has not derived benefit from the wine and therefore the figs are permitted.  This general rule, that the wine causes the food to be forbidden only if it imparts a good flavor, is stated specifically in the next lines of the mishnah.

Shimon would say that we should not look at it this way. The two doughs together helped improve at the beginning and the two doughs together made it worse at the end.

If creeping things such as a mouse are disgusting and the only reason the Torah had to prohibit eating them was to teach that even if they impart a bad taste the mixture is prohibited, then why should a dead creeping thing defile only when moist. When moist the dead mouse is disgusting and obviously it should be impure. If R. Sheshet’s reasoning is correct, then it should defile even when moist. And the same goes for semen—since it is disgusting when moist, it should defile even when dry.  ",

If this is true, we would have to prohibit the beer.<br>I should conclude that as many of you know, I am a great beer lover and have dabbled in home brewing.

This is a sensible system but hard to follow—who wants to taste the mouse beer or vinegar. Therefore, to solve the problem, they come up with set ratios. The latest voice in the Talmud gives the same ratio to everything—60 to 1. In Hebrew this is called “batel beshishim” and is a very important concept in halakhah.",

There are two opinions in the mishnah about how long this period of time must be. According to the first opinion, the non-Jew must have enough time to make a hole in the stopper of the jug (the stopper was made and sealed with clay), and then fill the hole back in, and the new seal to dry, so that the Jew will not be able to tell that it was opened when he returns.  If the Jew did not tell the non-Jew that he would be away for this period of time, the wine is permitted.  The second opinion is that of Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel.  He assumes that if the non-Jew merely makes a hole in the stopper and then reseals it, the Jew will see the damage.  The only way the non-Jew will avoid getting caught is if he removes the whole stopper, and then closes the jug with a new stopper and then the sealing on this new stopper dries.  If the Jew does not stay away for the period of time it takes to do all of this, the wine is permitted.",

If you leave your guest with a bottle on a table it is acceptable for him to drink from the bottle.  It is much less acceptable for him to go behind the bar and take out his own drink.<br> If, however, the Jew told the non-Jew that he could mix some wine with water (this is how wine was always drunk during the time of the mishnah), then of course we must assume that the non-Jew will take also what is on the side-table.  Although he did not specifically tell him to take from the wine on the side-table, it is as if he had done so.  It is like someone today saying, “help yourself” to his friend sitting at his bar.  Therefore all of the wine is forbidden.<br> If the Jew leaves the non-Jew with open casks of wine in the house, they are forbidden.

According to the first opinion, if the Jew is away for as long as the non-Jew would need “to bore a hole [in a jar], stop it up and [the sealing clay] to become dry” the wine is prohibited. Rabban Shimon b. Gamaliel is more lenient and provides a longer time: “[a length of time] sufficient for him to open a cask, put a new stopper on and [the new stopper] to become dry.” Today’s sugya discusses this topic.",

Gamaliel is concerned only if the Jew is absent long enough for the non-Jew to make a new stopper.<br> But this makes sense only with a clay stopper. With the lime stopper one could not detect it on the outside because the lime can be smoothed out and made to look as if it was not tampered with. Thus Rabban Shimon b. Gamaliel assumes that the rabbis state their opinion in the case of the clay stopper.",

If they were referring to a clay stopper, then the stopping could be seen on the inside or outside. This is what he said in the baraita.

Since the stopping can only be seen on the inside, the Jew might not turn the stopper over to see if it had been tampered with. Knowing this, the non-Jew might bore a hole and drink some wine.

Shimon b. Gamaliel again stating his opinion. To teach you that this is not the case, Rava says that the halakhah follows R. Shimon b. Gamaliel because the anonymous mishnah follows him.",
            "The Talmud here offers a rare remark on current practice. Theoretically, the rulings have consistently followed the lenient opinions among the tannaim. We are not concerned with a hole being bored in a jar nor are we concerned that seals will be forged. And yet, Jews do not leave wine in the hands of unsupervised non-Jews. Why not? The answer is that we fear that the non-Jew will use the bunghole to extract some wine. Rashi says that this is a small hole put in the side of the jar to let some smell out. Perhaps, Jews fear, the non-Jew will slightly widen the hole and take some wine out.",

What he did not know is that R. Yitzchak taught a way that a Jew could indeed pick up a purse and carry it four cubits at a time and thus save it from the marketplace. The purse referred to here is probably not just a random one, but rather a purse that the Jew was carrying when Shabbat began. If there is no alternative but to just toss it, the Jew can carry it four cubits at a time to get it home. But this is only allowed for one’s own purse/wallet.",

In our case with the wine, it is unclear whether gentile thieves entered the house at all, for the thieves may have been Jews. This is like R.

Furthermore, if you take it into your possession you must pay me for it, even if you don’t like the book (you will like both of my books, do not worry).<br> Our sugya talks about whether non-Jews acquire in the same way.

So why would this be a problem—the non-Jew would be paying for regular wine. Perhaps, the Talmud suggests, that Rav holds that liquid being poured counts as a connective. If so, then when the beginning of the flow hits the bottom, the entire stream becomes nesekh, and then the wine would become nesekh while still in the Jew’s possession. Note—the Talmud does not think that flow serves as a connective. This is why this is a difficulty.",

When one pours from one vessel into another, and the poured liquid never touches both vessels at the same time, there is no contamination from the lower vessel into the higher vessel.

The wine in the funnel is not “connected” to the yayin nesekh below. It is the same wine. As many of you know, I dabble in homebrewing. Whenever I fill up a bottle, I use a filling tube. The beer from the bottom always flows up onto the part of the tube that’s in the bottle. If you want to fill up a bottom container with a funnel, this is what will happen. ",

The Talmud has to therefore say that the baraita refers to a case where he cuts off the flow from the top to the bottom before it reaches the bottom container. This would seem to be a recipe for mess.",

We could deduce that what is in between is permitted, leading to the conclusion that flow is not a connecting link.<br> In the end, nothing can be learned from this mishnah concerning the concept of flow. [I might add that clearly the simple reading of the mishnah is that downward flow is not a connecting link. The Talmud does not seem to want to prove this quite yet].",

Sheshet says that the baraita refers to a case where a non-Jew is doing the pouring. Thus he invents a new category that is not found in tannaitic sources—wine poured by a non-Jew is considered nesekh.",

This is considered to be a rabbinic decree, an add-on if you will to the main prohibition of yayin nesekh. Since it is an add-on, the rabbis can shape it the way they want. So the rule is that if the gentile pours the wine, what comes out is prohibited but what is inside is permitted. This, by the way, is why in kosher restaurants non-Jews do not pour wine for the customers. What comes out of the bottle is prohibited, even though the non-Jew never touched it.",

            "Some rabbis wonder if the wine is prohibited because of the principle of flow. The wine would pour out onto the non-Jew’s hand, and since one part of the wine is nesekh, the entire barrel is nesekh. Rava explains that his reason to prohibit the wine is not simply flow. It is that the siphon is like a hole at the bottom of the barrel, and even without pouring, the wine will flow through the siphon.",
            "The instrument referred to here is a multiple straw which allows many people to drink at the same time. As long as the Jew is drinking, he will not be drinking the backwash of the nonJew. But if the non-Jew stops while the Jew is still drinking, some backwash may go in, and the Jew might drink wine that is considered nesekh. I’m putting a picture in here of people in modern Uganda drinking beer through a straw. This instrument is very common in the ancient and modern world for beer drinking. It would allow many people to share the beer and for the beer to be filtered. Traditional beer would have been full of a large amount of sediment.",

This is a case of a species becoming mixed with its own species. But if the prohibited wine falls into water, it must give taste to the water for the mixture to become prohibited. Rabin addresses a case where water and nesekh fall into a vat of wine. In such a case, we can ignore the permitted wine, and not see this is as a case of yayin nesekh falling into permitted wine. Rather, we look at it as if the nesekh fell into the water. If there is enough water to annul the taste of the small amount of nesekh (and there probably is) then the entire vat remains permitted.",

If a person separates one grain of wheat from a pile of wheat and declares it to be terumah, the entire pile permitted. So too one grain of wheat can make the entire pile prohibited. In other words, one grain has significance, both to make a pile of grain (or any type of terumah, such as a vat of wine) permitted, so too it has the power to make an entire pile prohibited, if one prohibited grain falls in.<br> Finally, the Talmud cites another baraita that supports the idea that tevel prohibits a mixture in the smallest amount only when it is of the same species.

The mishnah that begins this section discusses a Jew who buys a wine press from a non-Jew. Since the non-Jew used wine, which is yen nesekh, in the pitch in the wine press, the mishnah must teach Jews how to make the wine press “kosher”. Note that these laws are still relevant to Jews who observe kashrut and need to “make kosher” various vessels or even an entire kitchen.",

Furthermore, stone wine presses do not require much pitch to seal them. Therefore, all the Jew must do is scour the wine press to rid it of any traces of the previous owner’s wine. If the wine press was made of wood, Rabbi [Judah Hanasi] holds that it also may be scoured. However, the Sages hold that he must also peel off all of the pitch. Since wood is more absorbent than stone, and since wood wine presses require more pitch, he must be even more diligent in cleaning before it becomes usable. If the wine press is of earthenware, the Jew may never use it. Since earthenware is very absorbent, there is no way to rid it of the yen nesekh.",
            "Rava emphasizes that scouring is necessary only when the non-Jew covered the winepress with pitch. If he tread grapes without lining the winepress with pitch, the winepress does not need to be scoured. We might have thought that it is always necessary, therefore Rava had to recite his teaching.",

Hiyya and wants to essentially kasher a winepress that he probably bought from a non-Jew. R. Hiyya sends out his nephew to makes sure the kashering process is done well, for otherwise people will complain about R. Hiyya in the Bet Midrash. Rav says that smooth parts of the winepress can be koshered by scouring for they absorbed less of the wine that had fermented in there earlier. But the part that had a crack must be treated more stringently. The outer layer of the press must be scraped down. This is still a principle in koshering things like pots, pans, knives, etc. If the surface is smooth, it is less likely to have absorbed taste.",

Therefore, only they are impure. Whereas the olives are not clusters and will not stop the flow of the oil.",
            "The rabbis rule according to the lenient viewpoint—only the cluster and all that around it is impure.",
            "Introduction<br>This mishnah discusses how a Jew can make usable cooking utensils that were purchased from a non-Jew. Since the non-Jew surely used these utensils to cook unkosher products, the utensils must be “kashered.”",
            "The general principle in this mishnah is quite simple: the way that a utensil was normally used is the way that it is made usable by the Jew. A utensil that was used generally with cold foods may be washed off and it is kosher. Since it was used with cold, it did not absorb the unkosher food and therefore it need only be cleaned with water. If a utensil had been used with hot boiling liquids, such as a soup pot, it absorbed more than the utensil used with cold. Therefore it must be dipped in boiling water to remove the unkosher elements that it has absorbed. Utensils that had been used directly on the fire, such as the spit and the grill, become even more absorbent. The only way to kasher them is to make them white hot. A knife is a special case: it must be polished so that the outside layer of the knife is actually removed. This is because the knife, which is pressed with force into foods, tends to become more absorbent, even though it is not used directly on the fire. Remember that the knives in those days were not made of the hard stainless steel of which our knives are made.",
            "The Talmud adds that in addition to “kashering” all of these vessels need to be immersed in a mikveh.",
            "Rava derives this requirement from the additional word “וטהר” found at the end of the verse. This word is extraneous, so Rava uses it as the source for the requirement of immersing vessels bought from non-Jews.",
            "Bar Kapara derives the halakhah that vessels bought from a Gentile must be immersed in the mikveh from the use of the word “the waters of lustration” which literally translates as “the waters of the menstruant (niddah). Just as a menstruant must immerse in a mikveh, so too must these vessels be immersed in the mikveh.",
            "The Talmud now explains why we need both Rava and Bar Kapara’s midrash. Don’t they teach the same thing? If we only had the midrash on “it shall be clean” I would not have known that the immersion needs to be in a mikveh. The cleansing could have been accomplished by pouring water over the person. Thus we need the verse that compares the method of immersion for vessels to that needed by a niddah. And if we only had the verse that mentions the mikveh (“waters of lustration”) I might have thought that the purity laws of immersing Gentile vessels are the same as those for a niddah—they are not pure until the sun sets. Therefore, the other verse is necessary to teach that the vessels are immediately pure even before the sun sets.",
            "Introduction<br> Today’s section continues to discuss immersing vessels owned by non-Jews.",
            "R. Nahman says that even new vessels, those never used and therefore that have not absorbed the taste of any prohibited food, must be immersed. He derives this from the fact that immersion is required even if the vessels were first kashered by fire (which is mentioned in the biblical passage). Such cleansing will utterly rid the vessel of any taste and make it like new. Nevertheless, it must be immersed. From here we can conclude that all vessels bought from non-Jews must be immersed.",
            "If even vessels that have no residue of taste in them must be immersed, then why not say that even scissors need to be immersed? R. Nahman answered that the only types of vessels mentioned in the biblical passage are those used in connection with meals. Shearing scissors are not included.",
            "In the biblical passage from which these laws are derived, the Israelites had acquired title to the utensils (they took them as booty in war). Possession means that they must be immersed. But if one borrows the vessels, they need not be immersed.<br>  We should note that there is something a bit strange in this law. If the requirement has to do with purity or with kashrut, then what should it matter if the vessel was bought or borrowed?",
            "R. Yohanan explains that only metal utensils were mentioned in the passage and therefore only they must be immersed. Those made of earth and dung need not.",
            "Glassware can be repaired, and was indeed repaired, in a world in which glassware was very expensive, and is thus like metal. Just as metal utensils must be immersed, so must glassware.",
            "Glazed utensils before they are glazed are basically just earthenware and earthenware vessels need not be immersed. But by the end, they are like glass and glass vessels must be immersed. So there is a dispute as to whether they need immersion like glass utensils, or not like earthenware. The rule is that they do.",

            "The Talmud asks whether Jews have to immerse a vessel if the non-Jew gave it to them as a pledge, which would ostensibly be returned to the non-Jew upon termination of the loan. Mar bar R. Ashi, one of the last amoraim, teaches that indeed his father did immerse such a vessel. However, he is not sure if this is because a vessel taken as a pledge is considered to be the property of the creditor (this is a question frequently asked in the Talmud). If this was true, then taking a pledge is just like buying. Or perhaps in this particular case R. Ashi assumed that the non-Jew was not going to take it back but in other cases, where the non-Jew might take it back, it would not be considered as belonging to the creditor and therefore the Jew would not have to immerse it.",

They all need to be immersed, and depending on how they were used, this is how they need to be kashered. Note that many of these rules will be familiar to anyone who ever kashered anything for Pesah.",
            "There is a dispute if the Jew uses the vessel before it was kashered. According to one opinion, the contents cooked or prepared in the vessel are prohibited. This accords with the opinion that if a forbidden element imparts a worsened flavor the food is permitted. The non-Jew’s vessel will emit the flavor embedded in the vessel but this flavor is old and will not improve the taste of the dish. Nevertheless, this opinion holds, the forbidden element causes a prohibition.<br> According to the other opinion, the food is permitted because he holds that if the forbidden element imparts a worsened flavor, the dish is permitted.",
            "The Talmud asks—if one opinion holds that when it imparts a worsened flavor the food is permitted, how did the Torah ever prohibit vessels used by non-Jews. The answer is that this prohibition only applies to vessels used that very day—in this case, the taste imparted is not considered to be a worsening flavor."

            "Introduction<br> The last daf of Avodah Zarah (!) continues to deal with kashering vessels.",
            "R. Amram points out that there are contradictory tannaitic sources—one says that the spit and the grill must be heated up until they are white hot, while the other says that it is sufficient to boil them.",
            "R. Sheshet points out that vessels used by Gentiles absorbed prohibited substances and therefore require a more thorough form of kashering. But vessels used in sacrificial worship absorbed permitted substances.<br> Tomorrow’s sugya will continue this subject.",
            "Introduction<br> In yesterday’s sugya R. Sheshet explained that vessels belonging to a Gentile must be kashered by heating them up until they are white hot. But since Temple vessels had absorbed permitted substances, they need be kashered only by boiling. Today’s sugya raises a difficulty on R. Sheshet.",
            "While it is true that permitted substances were cooked in the Temple vessels, when they discharge taste, that taste is from a substance that is now prohibited. The taste has been in the walls of the vessels for several days and sacrifices become strictly prohibited after one or two days. Thus in both cases, the substance cooked in one of these vessels would have the taste of a prohibited substance.",
            "Rava explains that the word “boiling” does not mean what it seems. Rather, it means rinsing and washing, two verbs used in the context of cleaning holy utensils in Leviticus 6:21.",
            "Abaye rejects Rava’s resolution because rinsing and washing are done with cold water, not hot. He resolves the difficulty by saying that in both cases, both scalding and heating until white hot are required. This is a case of each mishnah providing only partial information.",
            "Introduction<br> Today’s sugya continues to try to resolve the contradiction between the mishnah that required making Gentile vessels white hot in order to kasher them and the mishnah that said that vessels used with sacrifices could be kashered by boiling. Abaye said that each mishnah provides part of the information and that each method of kashering was valid in either case. In today’s sugya, Rava offers his dissent and then tries to resolve the difficulty in a different way.",
            "Rava says that if we thought each mishnah testifies about the other, then two forms of kashering should have appeared in one context and one in the other. This would make it clearer that both are always valid. But one form in each context gives the impression of a difference between them.",
            "Rava explains that with holy vessels there is actually never a case where the taste would sit in the vessel for two days and thereby become “remnant” which is prohibited. If, for instance, a sacrifice is boiled in a vessel on Sunday, it does not become prohibited till Tuesday. But if the vessel is used on Monday, then it removes the taste of Sunday’s sacrifice. And thus there is never any time in which the taste becomes prohibited.",
            "Rava’s resolution above works well if we’re only concerned about shelamim, which can be eaten for two days. But a sin-offering (a hatat) can only be eaten for one day. So the taste of yesterday’s sin-offering is already prohibited when the vessel is used to cook today, making it prohibited.",
            "The Talmud explains that it is not necessary to kasher the vessel by making it white hot in the following circumstance. He cooks hatat today and then, on the same day, he also cooks a shelamim. This will get rid of the taste of the hatat. He then can cook in it hatat tomorrow, and then the taste of that hatat and yesterday’s shelamim will become remnant at the same time, the next day. Then he again cooks in it shelamim on that same day, thereby purging it of the taste of that day’s hatat. As long as one keeps repeating this process, kashering will not be necessary.",
            "If kashering is not necessary, then why should even scalding be necessary. Essentially, as long as one performs this process, one could continuously cook without kashering. This difficulty stands. Tomorrow the final resolution to this thorny problem will be offered.",

            "R. Ashi offers the final resolution to the problem, which goes back to the first resolution. The pan in which sacrifices was cooked only needs scalding and not being made white hot. Although when it emits taste, that taste is also forbidden, like yayin nesekh, the taste is just taste. It is not visible. Since the taste is not visible, and when it absorbed the taste the taste was permitted, what it emits is less prohibited. Note that it still requires kashering, just a lesser form.",
            "Introduction<br> Today’s sugya explains how one kashers by making white hot and how one kashers by boiling.",
            "The amoraim here explain how the two major forms of kashering are performed.How does one kasher a large pot, one that cannot be boiled inside a larger pot? One makes a rim of dough around its edges and then builds it up so that the water basically boils over. The rim will get hot water splashed on it. This is sufficient to kasher it, for just as the rim absorbed taste by having the forbidden substance splash on it, so it can emit taste in the same way."

            "The knife that has been kashered can only be used with cold food. Using it with hot food would cause it to emit the taste that it absorbed from the prohibited food.",

Bati is not too happy that he is not being treated like a non-Jew. The king responds that he does not know if Bati b. Tobi really is observant. And in a highly humorous end to the masekhet, the king says to him, “I remember what you did last night.” Too bad we’ll never know what naught Bati did last night. And come on, can you think of a better way to end Masechet Avodah Zarah then with a non-Jewish king kashering a knife and telling another Jew he is not observant enough?",
            "That’s it folks. We finished another masekhet, another wild ride through the complicated, topsy-turvy, free-thinking, beautiful minds of Hazal, our rabbis of blessed memory. I’m hoping you found this Tractate as fascinating as I did. Discussions about how Jews can preserve their identity in a world full of people whose identity they do not share. When can Jews trust non-Jews, and when can they not? When can they use their things, and when can they not? What foods of theirs can they eat and what can they drink (not wine, that’s for sure)? It was a relevant tractate then and much of it is still relevant now. I hope you have time to review some of your learning and most importantly, I hope you continue with us onto our fifth masekhet—Kiddushin!"
