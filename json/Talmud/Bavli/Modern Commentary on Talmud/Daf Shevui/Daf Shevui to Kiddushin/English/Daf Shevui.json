            "Introduction<br>Congratulations on starting a new Masechet!<br>The first mishnah of Kiddushin teaches how a woman is “acquired” in marriage and how she “acquires” herself, that is to say, how she becomes free to marry another man.  The mishnah also teaches how a “yevamah” is “acquired.”  A “yevamah” is a woman whose husband has died without any children.  According to the Torah she must either marry her husband’s brother or perform halitzah, the release from the obligation to her brother-in-law. ",
            "A man can betroth his wife in any one of three ways.  The first is by giving her a small amount of money and saying to her “Behold you are betrothed to me with this money.”  Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel debate how much money is needed to effect betrothal.  What is crucial is that both a denar and a perutah are small amounts of money; a perutah is almost valueless.  These are not representative of a woman’s true value, which is clearly much greater.  Rather they are symbolic, especially in Bet Hillel’s opinion.  To this day, nearly all betrothals are effected through money.  Since the Middle Ages and perhaps earlier, Jews have used rings to effect betrothal.  This custom was originally a Christian custom.  In the Talmud rings are never used.<br>The second way is for the husband to write her a document in which it is stated, “Behold you are betrothed to me.”  This document is not to be confused with a ketubah, although some scholars posit that they are both derived from common origins and that originally they were written together.<br>  The thirds means of betrothal is sexual relations.  This act must be done with the intent of betrothal.  No one holds that casual intercourse can effect betrothal. The thornier problem is whether or not sexual relations between a couple “living together” can effect betrothal.  Most modern halakhists rule that it does not, although there are some who hold that couples who live together with the intent to form a familial type of unit do require a get in order to separate.",
            "A woman becomes halakhically separated from her husband either by divorce or by death.  Without one of the two, any relations that she has with another man will be considered adultery.",
            "The dead husband’s brother-in-law “acquires” his brother’s widow through sexual intercourse.  The yevamah is not acquired by money, as a woman would be in cases of normal betrothal.<br>The yevamah is free to marry another man if she performs halitzah with the yavam.  Alternatively, if the yavam dies (in a situation where there is only one yavam) she also may marry anyone she so chooses.  Note that once she is married she is considered a normal wife, and she “acquires” herself through the death of her husband or through divorce.",
            "Introduction<br>The first couple of pages of Kiddushin are intensely interested in the particulars of the language of the Mishnah, and not in its content. Since the Geonic period (the period that immediately followed the Talmudic period), rabbis have known that these few pages were late additions to the Talmud, from a period they labeled “the savoraic period.” There is little historical information about this period. ",
            "The Talmud asks why our mishnah uses the language of “acquisition” whereas other mishnayot use the language of “betrothal (mekadesh)” In other words, why not teach here “a woman is betrothed?”",
            "The word “acquisition” is used because the law that betrothal can be effected with money is derived from the use of the word “taking” in two contexts—betrothal and the transfer of money when Abraham buys the field from Ephron. Since buying something is called an “acquisition” (two prooftexts are cited), taking a woman in betrothal is called, at least by this mishnah, “acquisition.”"
        ],
        [
            "Now that the Talmud explained why our mishnah uses the language of “acquisition” it must explain why the rest of the tractate uses the language of “betroth” with in Hebrew is “lekadesh,” from the word for holy.<br>The answer is that the Mishnah opens with biblical language—acquisition. But then it moves on to rabbinic language, “mekadesh” (kiddushin). The meaning of this peculiar rabbinic term is that when a woman is betrothed, she becomes prohibited to all other man, just as “hekdesh,” holy property, is prohibited to all.<br>It is worth noting that the rabbis were cognizant that their Hebrew vocabulary, and indeed, much of the basics of their language, differed radically from that found in the Torah.",
            "Introduction<br>The Talmud continues to discuss why the Mishnah states “a woman is acquired.” ",
            "The second chapter opens with “a man betroths.” So why not open the first chapter with “a man acquires” instead of the passive, “a woman is acquired”?<br>The answer is to preserve the parallel with the end of the mishnah—“a woman acquires herself.” ",
            "The first clause still could have read “a man acquires” and thn the latter clause could have read “and transfers ownership.” In other words, both could have been in the active, with the man as the subject, and not the passive with the woman.<br>The answer is that when it comes to the husband dying, the husband is not causing her to acquire herself. The husband’s death is “from Heaven.” Therefore, the second half could not have taught, “and transfers ownership.”",
            "The use of the woman as the subject, albeit a passive one, indicates that a woman cannot be married against her will. Unlike any other “acquisition” where the consent of the acquired is not necessary, when it comes to marriage, the acquired party, the woman, must consent.",
            "Introduction<br>The Talmud now begins to examine why the Mishnah uses the feminine form of the word for three (shalosh), and not the masculine form (sheloshah). ",
            "The mishnah uses the feminine form of “shalosh (three)” because it uses the word “derekh (way)” which is also feminine, as we can see from Exodus 18:20.",
            "A different mishnah, concerning a “zav,” a man with unnatural genital discharge, uses the masculine form of the number seven, because the word “derekh” is masculine. I think you can anticipate the difficulty on its way!",
            "The Talmud first explains why some verses use “derekh” in a feminine form and why some use it in a masculine form. The word for Torah is feminine, as proven from a verse in Psalms. Therefore, the word for derekh is feminine. The word was used in masculine form in the context of war because men wage war, women do not.<br>I should note that this is not the type of explanation that would be acceptable to linguists. Just because the name for a document is in one gender, does not mean that the gender of words in that document should shift to that gender. Nor should context affect gender.",
            "The Talmud offers a similar resolution with regard to the mishnah’s use of both feminine and masculine forms.  When the context is women, the feminine is used. When the context is men, the masculine is used.",
            "Introduction<br>Now the Talmud asks why the mishnah uses the word “ways” instead of “things.” ",
            "The Talmud asks why the mishnah uses the word “derekh” which means “way” and not “devar” which would mean thing. The answer is that intercourse is a “way” not a thing.",
            "“Intercourse” is a “way” not a thing. But the other two means to affect betrothal—money and document are things. And it would not make sense for the mishnah to use the word “way” that is appropriate for only one out of the three means listed in the mishnah.<br>The resolution is that money and deed are really given to the woman as a prelude to intercourse. Therefore, they are in a sense subservient to intercourse and the word “ways” is used, not “things.”",
            "Introduction<br>A parable by R. Shimon as to why the Torah says a man takes a woman and not a woman is taken by a man. ",
            "The Talmud here quotes a statement by R. Shimon in order to explain something about the mishnah. To Rashi, the quote explains why the language of the mishnah uses the word “ways” and not “things.” But we should note that R. Shimon himself is explaining a verse in the Torah and not the mishnah. This is a case where a statement made in one context is being used to explain something else. To me it is not so clear that the Talmud uses R. Shimon’s statement to explain why “ways” is used and not “things.”",
            "The allusion here is to the story of the Garden of Eden. Men seek out women because the first woman was taken from a man.<br>I realize that this is a gendered way of viewing the world. But it certainly seems true of R. Shimon’s time, and probably is still relatively true in our world. The percentage of marriage proposals in which the man asks the woman is still probably very high. Would be interesting to think of what R. Shimon would say about changing gender roles in our society. Is this midrash essentially his way of saying men are genetically disposed to be the pursuers? Or would he say that gender roles can change? ",
            "Introduction<br>The Talmud now asks why other mishnayot use the word “ways” instead of “things” just as it asked and answered above concerning the first mishnah of this masekhet. ",
            "The mishnah about zavim (people with unnatural genital discharge) use the word “ways” instead of “things.” The Talmud explains that this is because it is an excessive “way” that leads one to have these types of problems.",
            "The mishnah uses the word “ways” in comparing an etrog to trees or vegetables because the “way” of an etrog is to grow like a vegetable. Just as vegetables grow on “all waters”, so too do etrogs. This means that in addition to rainwater, they also need irrigation. Their tithing year follows their point of harvesting. For other types of fruits the tithing year follows when they first appear on the branch of the tree.  "
        ],
        [
            "Introduction<br>The Talmud continues to ask why the word “way” is used and not the word “thing.” ",
            "A “koy” is some sort of animal (we do not know what type) that is somewhat similar to a wild beast and somewhat similar to a domesticated animal, each of which have different rules (for instance with regard to eating certain parts or with regard to covering the blood). Why does the Mishnah use the word “ways” and not “things”?",
            "This is another mishnah that uses the word “ways” instead of “things.” But the Talmud has sort of run out of particular answers for each of them and now will search for a broader explanation. ",
            "The Talmud now offers a different resolution for why “ways” and not “things” is used. If two issues are different, the word “ways” is used. But if they are the same then “things” is used. This is proven by R. Eliezer who uses the word “things” when saying that the etrog is the same as trees for all matters.",
            "Introduction<br>This section is substantially different from what we learned before. Here the Talmud is interested in why the mishnah has to use the word “three.” Why not just say, “a woman is acquired through money, a document and intercourse.” This is a frequent trope of the anonymous voice in the Talmud. The author of these sections tries to derive extra meaning from unnecessary words in the Mishnah just as earlier rabbis tried to derive meaning from words they perceived to be extra in the Torah. ",
            "The number in the first clause, concerning how a woman is acquired comes to exclude the huppah. A woman who enters the huppah but has not been acquired through money, documents or intercourse, is not married to her husband.<br>I should note that “huppah” in the Talmud is not what huppah is today. It is not entirely clear what this word means, but it seems closer to an actual room that the husband brings the woman into. Perhaps this originally was the room in which they would live. Today our “huppot” are symbolic. ",
            "R. Huna says that betrothal can be done through huppah. We will return to this statement later so I am not going to dig deeper now. If so, then what does the number in the mishnah exclude?<br>The Talmud answers that it excludes betrothal through “a symbolic exchange.” Today we do this with a handkerchief or some other small object. The idea is that one person has an object and he symbolically transfers it to the other person and in exchange the person who symbolically receiving the hanky transfers something to the other person. This is also called “kinyan.” It is a convenient way to exchange either abstract goods or goods that are not present at the time of exchange.<br>We might have thought that since some of the laws of betrothal are derived from the verses in which Abraham buys a field from Ephron, and a field can be acquired through a symbolic exchange, so too betrothal can be enacted through a symbolic exchange. The mishnah, by using the word “three” teaches that it cannot. ",
            "Symbolic exchange can be done with anything, even something not worth a perutah. But betrothal, as we learn in the Mishnah, can only be done with at least the value of a perutah. That is why betrothal cannot be done through symbolic exchange. "
        ],
        [
            "Introduction<br>The mishnah also uses a number in the second clause, “and she acquires herself in two ways.” What does this number come to exclude?",
            "The number in the second clause teaches that a married woman does not leave her marriage through “halitzah.” “Halitzah” is the release from levirate marriage, the obligation of a woman whose husband died without children to marry her husband’s brother. This woman, called the “yevamah,” is released through halitzah. We could have made a “kal vehomer” (all the more so) argument. If halitzah works to release a yevamah (a woman awaiting levirate marriage) but a divorce document, a get, does not work, then halitzah should all the more so work to release a married woman. The mishnah teaches that it does not. Halitzah is only for a woman awaiting levirate marriage.  ",
            "The Torah requires a document for divorce. Halitzah, which is a ritual performed through the removal of the husband’s shoe, is not valid.",
            "Introduction<br>Today’s section begins to interpret the mishnah—from where is it derived that a woman is betrothed through money. However, this passage is not really from Kiddushin. It was originally composed in connection with a  mishnah from Ketubot 46b according to which when a father betroths his daughter, he receives the money. ",
            "There are two questions that will be answered. 1) How do we know that betrothal can be effected through money? 2) How do we know that it goes to the father. Note that it goes to the father only if she is a minor or a young girl. Once she has hit majority age, the money is hers. The Talmud defines majority age as 12 ½.",
            "The Talmud now begins to ask how we know that the father receives the money through which she is betrothed. Rav Judah answers with a midrash of a verse concerning a young girl who is sold into slavery. When this girl reaches a certain age, the master or his son is to marry her. If he does not, he must send her free, without the usual money used to redeem a slave. The Torah emphasizes this—“she goes out for nothing, without money.” The repetition allows Rav Judah to offer a midrash—there is no money when a girl leaves her master’s domain in this case. But in another similar case, when a girl leaves her father’s domain by being betrothed, there is money. And who receives the money—her father. ",
            "R. Judah’s midrash successfully proved that there is money when the girl leaves her father’s domain. But how do we know the father receives it? Maybe the girl who is being betrothed should receive it?<br>The answer is that if the father has the right to betroth her, i.e. to decide to whom she is betrothed, then shouldn’t he be the one to receive the money. ",
            "Above we said that since a father decides whom his daughter marries, he should receive the betrothal money. But a na’arah, a girl between the ages of 12 to 12.5 can decide herself to whom she is betrothed. So she should be able to receive her betrothal money, not her father.  But we know that the father does receive the money. So again the question is asked, how do we know this?",
            "The Talmud now answers with a verse taken from the context of the annulment of vows. The verse implies, to the Talmud, that all financial advantage that comes to her in her youth, while a na’arah, go to her father. This would include the money used for her betrothal. ",
            "Introduction<br>Yesterday’s section concluded by positing that the biblical source for the idea that a father receives the betrothal money of his na’arah (between 12 and 12.5) daughter is the verse in Numbers 30 according to which all of the financial advantages accrued to a young girl go to her father. In today’s section the same law is learned from another verse, raising the question of which verse is the actual source. ",
            "The work that a daughter produces, her earnings, belongs to her father. Rav deduces this from the fact that a man may sell his daughter to be a maidservant. But if the verse from Numbers teaches that all of the financial advantages of a daughter go to her husband, why does Rav need to prove that a daughter’s handiwork goes to her father from that verse?    ",
            "The Talmud now admits that the verse from Numbers does not have broader implications. It refers only to the annulment of vows and not to a father’s right to his daughter’s betrothal money. And should we suggest that just as a father has a right to annul his daughter’s vows, so too he has right to his daughter’s betrothal money, this must be rejected for one cannot derive laws regarding monetary matters from the laws of vows. ",
            "The Talmud suggests that we derive the fact that the father receives the betrothal money from the fact, learned earlier in Ketubot, that he receives any fines owed to her, such as those for rape and seduction. However, the laws of fines differ from the laws of monetary payments and therefore there is a rule that the latter cannot be derived from the former. ",
            "If a na’arah is raped/seduced the payments for the shame and blemish go to her father (we learned this earlier in Ketubot). But this cannot be a source for the father’s receiving the betrothal money because there is a difference with shame and blemish. The meaning of “since the father is involved” is not entirely clear. I believe that the words could mean that when she is shamed or blemished, the father also suffers. In any case, we still have no source for how we know that the father receives the betrothal money.",
            "The resolution of how we know that the father receives the money goes back to the original source—the fact that when the daughter sold into slavery goes free, the master does not receive a payment. Had there been a payment, the master would have received it. Thus, logically, in the case of betrothal, where there is a payment, the money goes to the father, who is akin to the master."
        ],
        [
            "The problem is that the comparison between the two “going outs” is not precise. When the maidservant goes free, she becomes completely free. Her master retains no control. But betrothal is only a partial transfer of authority. Her father still retains some authority over her and will continue to do so until she enters the huppah. So how can the two be compared?",
            "The answer is that in one respect, even though still living in her father’s house, the father has lost control over her at betrothal—he no longer has the right to unilaterally annul her vows. Once betrothed, the father and husband jointly annul her vows.",
            "Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section, Exodus 21:11 was used as the basis for kiddushin being performed with money. Today’s section notes that this verse was used for another purpose. This is a consistent question asked by the “stam hatalmud” the anonymous voice of the Talmud. While tannaim did not seem to have any problem learning two laws or more from one verse, the late Babylonian rabbis who composed the Talmud did. ",
            "This other midrash is more directly related to the verses of the Torah. The Torah specifies that a girl bought as a slave at a young age “goes out” if the master does not do certain things on her behalf (like marry her, or marry her off to his son). But there would seem to be the need for a time-limit. The rabbis invent such a time limit, and apply it here and elsewhere. A “ketanah” is a girl under 12. A girl between 12 and 12 ½ is called a “na’arah” and after that she becomes a “bogeret.” This midrash teaches that if the master has not done these things before she hits 12, she goes out free and need not pay any money for her manumission.",
            "Ravina reads meaning into the letter “yod” found in the word “eyn.” The appearance of the letter “yod” allows two halakhot to be learned from this verse. This is of course an unusual derashah to say the least. Tannaim do not derive meaning from verses in this way. Even among late amoraim, which Ravina is, this is a strange derashah, which the Talmud will immediately notice. ",
            "The midrash here teaches that if a daughter of a priest who is married to a non-priest and then the non-priest died had any offspring, even grandchildren or illegitimate offspring (such as mamzerim) she no longer may eat priestly food such as terumah. The midrash uses the letter “yod” in “eyn” as if the word was written “ayen” which means to “search.” Her lineage must be examined to see if she has any offspring. The reason this midrash is cited is to prove that derashot (rabbinic exegesis) may be based on the letter yod. ",
            "This very derashah undermines what the Talmud perceives to be a rule of exegesis—no word may be interpreted twice. The word “eyn” was used to derive that both grandchildren and illegitimate offspring disqualify her from eating terumah. To resolve the difficulty, the Talmud says that the first derashah, concerning grandchildren, was not needed. Grandchildren are treated like children (usually treated much better than children, I might add). The derashah was needed to teach that illegitimate children also prevent her from eating terumah.",
            "The Talmud now shows that sometimes the Torah writes words that have an “ey” sound without the letter you. The word “me’eyn” does not have a yod, but “eyn” does. This, to the tanna, legitimates making exegetical conclusions from what it perceives to be an extraneous letter.<br>I should note that such derashot are never made in tannaitic literature. Tannaitic exegesis is based on units that have independent meaning, words, phrases, etc. Not on single letters such as this. This type of “hyper-exegesis” is found in the later stages of the Talmud. This is an issue that I will address in a forthcoming third volume of Reconstructing the Talmud.",
            "Introduction<br>The Talmud has now brought in derashot showing that a na’arah’s betrothal money and her handiwork all go to her father. The Talmud asks why we could not have learned one of these laws from the other. Again, the underlying notion is that the Torah should never be at all superfluous. ",
            "If the Torah had written only that her kiddushin money goes to her father, I might have thought that her income from work goes to her since she earned it. It does not—it goes to her father. ",
            "I might have thought that her earnings go to her father because in return for her giving him her earnings she is provided for. But her kiddushin money is a different story—she would not be giving it to her father in return for something. Therefore, I might have thought that it is hers. It is not. As we learned, all financial gain that comes from the young daughter goes to her father.",
            "Introduction<br>Earlier we read a derashah that discusses when a young girl sold into slavery goes free. This sugya discusses that derashah. ",
            "The derashah states that a girl sold into slavery goes free at na’arut (age 12) and at bagrut (12.5). This is obviously superfluous—all the Torah needed to say is that she goes free at na’arut, and then she’ll already be free by bagrut.",
            "Rabbah explains that if we only had one word, we would assume she goes free at bagrut. We need both words to teach that she goes free at na’arut.",
            "The same phenomenon occurs with Leviticus 22:10 which teaches that a “toshav and sakhir” who are part of a priest’s household may not eat terumah. What do these words mean, the rabbis ask? Toshav refers to a Hebrew slave acquired for perpetuity (meaning he was acquired for six years and then did not want to go free. He remains a slave until the Jubilee). And a sakhir is one acquired only for six years. Here too we can ask that if the one acquired for a longer time does not eat terumah, obviously one who is acquired for a lesser period does not eat. After all, he is less owned by the non-Jew. But if only one word had been stated, we would have said that it refers to one acquired for the shorter period—he does not eat terumah. But one acquired for perpetuity does eat terumah. Therefore, I need both words.",
            "Abaye says that the two cases are not similar. When it comes to the toshav and sakhir, these are two different people, and sometimes the Torah writes out a law that could be learned from a “kal vehomer” argument—an “all the more so” type of argument. Therefore, they are not really superfluous.",
            "But here, Abaye continues, there is no reason for the Torah to write both, because if she goes free at na’arut, she’s not even there at bagrut. She’s one person so the verse is truly superfluous.  ",
            "Abaye points out that not all girls who reach majority age will actually go through “na’arut.” “Na’arut” is more than just hitting 12. It is hitting 12 and developing signs of puberty. A girl can become a bogeret at the age of 20 without ever hitting puberty. Such a girl is called an “aylonit” (we learned the term in Ketubot—it is sometimes translated as barren, but women can hit puberty and be barren. Still an aylonit is by definition barren). If only one word had been taught I might have thought that only a bogeret who had hit puberty would go free. Therefore, the second word teaches that a na’arah goes free, and a bogeret who never becomes a na’arah also goes free (although only at a later age).",
            "Introduction<br>Today’s section continues to discuss the midrash about when a girl sold into slavery goes free. We had said before that this midrash teaches that she goes free at the age of bagrut even without having reached puberty, an ayloni (this is considered to be 20 by Rashi). She also goes free at na’arut, which means she reached puberty and is at least 12 years old. ",
            "Mar bar Rav Ashi points out that we could have learned that a girl who is a bogeret goes out from her master’s authority by a kal vehomer argument. A girl who becomes 12 and has hit puberty goes free from her master but, if she is living in her father’s domain, is not free from his authority. But a bogeret, one who reaches majority age, goes free even from her father’s domain. All the more so she would go free from the domain of her master. So why do we need a midrash to teach us what we would already know. Obviously any type of bogeret, whether she is an aylonit (a woman who does not hit puberty) or not, goes free.",
            "The argument here is getting more complex. We might have thought that a girl who will never reach na’arut, meaning she will never hit puberty could not be sold. After all, if she goes free at na’arut then maybe if she will never be a na’arah, meaning she is an aylonit who will never hit puberty, then she could not have been sold in the first place. Therefore, we have a verse that says (midrashically) that an aylonit goes out of slavery at bagrut (age 20). This teaches us that she can be sold in the first place.",
            "Above, Mar bar R. Ashi argued that the verse cannot be interpreted to say something that we could have learned through logic, through a kal vehomer argument (“all the more so”). But we earlier said that the Torah does write laws (ones usually drawn out by midrash) that could be learned through a kal vehomer. So why is this a difficulty?<br>The answer is that we would always prefer to read a verse such that its law could not be learned logically. But we do admit that at times the Torah does write a law that could be learned logically."
        ],
        [
            "Introduction<br>Today’s sugya brings in another source in the Torah for the halakhah that a woman can be betrothed through money.

If we can, then we do not need to learn this from a verse.<br>The first argument is to prove the case from the Hebrew maidservant. A master may acquire a Hebrew maidservant with money by buying her from her father. But intercourse is not a means of acquisition. Therefore, since intercourse is a means of betrothal (acquisition) of a wife, all the more so money should be as well. ",

Therefore, we might think that just as she does not leave the marriage through money, so too she does not enter the marriage through money.

There is no denying that the system of marriage in the time of the Talmud was not egalitarian. However, it is still interesting to note that the Talmud does not seem to think it is inherently wrong for the woman to acquire the man, that men are not “acquirable” or any such broader message. We could read this section as saying that betrothal by the man is simply following the literal reading of the verse. I don’t know if this offers much solace for those bothered by the patriarchy, but I still think it is interesting to think about.",

The sugya is very similar to yesterday’s, so I would advise looking there for reference.<br>I should note that this is a strange halakhah. According to its literal application, a man would have intercourse with a woman, she would now be betrothed to him and they would not be allowed to again have intercourse until marriage proper, which could be a long time away. There does not seem to be any evidence that betrothal was actually ever performed through in this manner and it is indeed counterintuitive. In my opinion, it is a remnant of an earlier understanding of these “three means by which a woman is acquired” according to which all three are customary—betrothal through money, a marriage document and then physical consummation. But rabbinic tradition reads the mishnah differently—each means alone serves to enact betrothal.",

Thus a wife who is acquired through money should also be acquired through intercourse. ",

But again, we have a difficulty—why do I need a verse to prove something that I can deduce from logic? ",
            "As he did in yesterday’s sugya, R. Ashi explains why the logical argument is not sufficient. The argument that a wife can be betrothed through intercourse had been made by analogy with a yevamah who can also be acquired through intercourse. But the yevamah is already connected to her yavam, the brother-in-law, by virtue of her marriage to her (now dead) husband. She does not really need “betrothal”—all she needs is “marriage.” But a regular woman getting married is not at all connected to her husband. Therefore, we might have thought that intercourse would not be an effective means to betroth her. Thus we do need a Scriptural verse to prove it. "

Leah gets nothing, Levi loses nothing and yet, through the comparison with the guarantor and the Canaanite slave, Leah is betrothed to Levi. From the guarantor we learn that a person can give a guarantee without acquiring anything. And from the slave we learn that a person can acquire without giving anything.

From two totally different cases, the guarantor and the slave, he derives two highly abstract principles, and then applies them to the case of betrothal.",
            "Introduction<br>Today’s section continues with Rava’s discussions of pushing the limits of betrothal law. ",
            "R. Papa rules that the woman may give the money to the man and say that she will become betrothed to him. Note that some commentators say that the man must also say back “Behold you are betrothed to me.” But this is not necessarily the meaning of the text.<br>It might be argued that this is a glimpse of a more egalitarian version of betrothal. The woman gives the money and makes the declaration. I am not sure if this is what motivates these amoraim, but it certainly might be possible.",
            "According to a mishnah we will learn later in the tractate, one can acquire money along with a transaction of real estate. So if I buy a piece of land, I can acquire things with it, without a special act. But the opposite is not true—I cannot acquire land by acquiring movables. The case brought above, to R. Ashi, is a case of the woman transferring money to the man, and through this money, transferring herself, and she counts as real estate. Thus it would be a breach of mishnaic halakhah.<br>Hazakah is the rule of possession. We will learn about this more later in the masechet.      ",
            "Mar Zutra points out that the woman was not saying “you will acquire me [in betrothal] along with this money.” This would indeed not work. The mechanism of betrothal is that she is deriving benefit. If he is an important man, she might derive benefit from the very fact that he receives a present from him. Thus this is a quid pro quo—she receives benefit and she gives herself in betrothal. Note that Mar Zutra is willing to abstract the notion of “benefit” in order to allow this form of betrothal to work.",
            "This refers back to what Rava taught in yesterday’s section. All of the strange ways that Rava said betrothal can work, can also work for selling a field.",
            "The Talmud now asks why we need to know that these roundabout means of acquisition work for both betrothal and sales.<br>If we had said that they work for betrothal, it might have been because the Talmud assumes that women would prefer to be married to unmarried. Thus we might have said that a woman allows herself to be betrothed even though she receives no benefit. But when it comes to selling a field, I would have said that this is not true. The seller must receive benefit for the sale to be valid. Therefore, Rava says that the same is true with regard to selling.<br>Resh Lakish’s statement appears several times in the Talmud and has, on occasion, been used to assume that a woman would prefer a bad marriage over no marriage. However, this is not necessarily the original meaning. It might just mean that she prefers to be married in general, but not if the marriage is bad. ",
            "A person can just give away his property—I can waive my rights to my property. Therefore, it seems obvious that a person could transfer his property without receiving any benefit. But kiddushin does require a transfer of money, otherwise it cannot happen. Therefore, Rava had to tell us that a woman can actually, in a roundabout way, be betrothed without receiving any money.",
            "Introduction<br>More theoretical musings by Rava on kiddushin. ",
            "Rava introduces this paradoxical statement, whereby a formula of “be betrothed to half of me” is effective, but “half you be betrothed to me” is not. The rest of the sugya will explore why one works but the other does not.",
            "Abaye points out that if we are reading “halves” into the verse then neither formula should work. The Torah refers to whole men and women.",
            "Rava responds that while half a man cannot marry a woman, a man can marry two women. Saying, “you are married to half of me” is akin to the man pointing out that he might want to marry another woman. Since this is possible (although not the most romantic way to pop the question) it is effective as a betrothal formula. But a woman cannot be married to two men, so he cannot say to her “half you be betrothed to me.” ",
            " Mar Zutra points out that when it comes to dedicating an animal, if one dedicates a limb, at least a limb that the life depends on (such as the head), the whole animal is considered dedicated. So too this should work with a woman—if he says “half of you is betrothed to me” the kiddushin should spread to the whole woman and she would be fully betrothed to him.",
            "The difference between the two is that with the animal, it is property. If the man wants he can dedicate his entire animal and no one can stop him. But with the woman, we need her consent to be betrothed and she consented only to be half-betrothed. So we cannot compare the case of betrothal to dedicating an animal.",
            "The better comparison is when someone else owns half the animal. In such a case, one partner cannot dedicate the animal because it is not all his. So too a man cannot betroth half a woman.<br>The Talmud talks out some of the halakhic rules relevant to the case of the animal. If he then goes back and purchases the second half of the animal, and dedicates the second half, then it is all dedicated. However, since it was not fit for sacrifice when half dedicated, it cannot actually be sacrificed. If someone tries to substitute another animal for it, that animal becomes holy, and the original animal remains holy. In other words, this is a fully dedicated animal that cannot be sacrificed.",
            "The Talmud learns three halakhot relevant to sacrifices and things dedicated to the Temple. The concept discussed here is called “defferal” or “dichui.” Once something has become invalid as a sacrifice, it can never return to becoming valid. This applies to live animals—so we learn from the half-dedicated animal. 2) It can be “deferred” even from the outset, as soon as it is fit. Others say (elsewhere) that in order for a sacrifice to be permanently deferred, it must first be fit for a sacrifice. This animal which was only half-dedicated, never was fit to be offered. 3)  Deferral applies even if only the value of the animal was dedicated, like this one half of whose value was dedicated."

That would be a false acquisition<br>The issue is if he tells her what it is worth and his assessment turns out to be correct.

Joseph, at the moment of betrothal she is uncertain. She is agreeing to something whose value she can’t know. Therefore, her agreement to be betrothed is not really a full agreement.

            "Rabbah argued earlier that the goods being used for kiddushin do not need to be of definite value. So how does he read this baraita, such that it does not prove R. Joseph’s rule? He reads it as excluding “exchange” as a means to acquire a slave (or to betroth). “Exchange” is the symbolic act whereby one person symbolically acquires something of insignificant value and thereby gives the other person something of significant value. This was often done with a handkerchief. Sometimes today it is done with a pen. The two most common occasions on which one would see this is with the signing of the ketubah and with selling chametz.",

Above, we rejected this interpretation because the same is true of money—it too must be worth a perutah. So why specify “produce and utensils”? The answer is that we might actually have thought that goods worth less than a perutah can be used for kiddushin because they can be used immediately. For instance, if you need an eraser, it might be worth more to you than a perutah, even if you would not pay a perutah for an eraser at the store. Therefore, the baraita needs to teach us that a slave cannot be bought for less than a perutah. But according to Rabbah, the goods need not have a definite value.",

If the object is not worth five selas, then saying it is worth that much does not change reality. Rather, it must actually be worth that amount.

For if the first case was “a maneh” and still she is not betrothed until he gives her the complete maneh, then obviously if he says “this maneh” she is not betrothed until he gives her the complete maneh.",
            "The last piece of logic from above does not prove that the first clause must deal with “this maneh.” For it could be that the first clause refers to “a maneh” and yet the second clause still teaches “this maneh” to make sure that you interpret the first clause in the opposite way. In other words, do not say that the second clause is obvious. Say that the second clause teaches you how to interpret the first clause.<br>The conclusion here is that the resolution of the difficulty on R. Elazar stands but is not proven through logic. R. Elazar can interpret the baraita so that it does not contradict him, but the baraita does not need to be interpreted in that way.  ",

Through a midrash the rabbis learn that a creditor has legal title to the pledge he takes. The Torah considers it righteous for a creditor to return a pledge to a poor person. If the pledge did not belong to the creditor, then how is this righteous? Thus the creditor is considered as the owner of the pledge. This does not mean that he need not return it to the debtor when the debt is paid back. It just means that while it is in his possession it belongs to him. If he wants, he could even use it to betroth a woman. But a man cannot betroth a woman by giving her a pledge on a debt that he himself owes her. In other words he can give it to her as a creditor possessing a pledge, but not as a debtor promising to give her money.<br>We should note that this is difficult. After all, if a creditor owns a pledge, then why is she not betrothed when he gives her his own pledge?

            "R. Papa first explains the reasoning of his disputants. A get must be written for the woman’s sake, with that particular woman in mind. But it need not be written with her consent. After all, she can be divorced against her will. So too when it comes to marriage, the document must be written for her sake, but not necessarily with her consent.",
            "R. Papa also compares the divorce document with the betrothal document. When it comes to divorce, the one giving something must consent—the man is giving her herself, so too when it comes to betrothal, the giver, this time the woman giving herself in marriage, must consent to the writing of the document.",
            "This baraita seems to state explicitly that both the man and woman must consent to the writing of the documents of marriage and betrothal.",
            "The Talmud reinterprets the baraita such that it refers to “deeds of stipulation.” These are deeds written at the time of betrothal in which the fathers of the groom and bride promise to endow their children with gifts. Once the betrothal occurs, the fathers owe this money even if a more formal act of acquisition (kinyan) has not occurred. However, a document is not written out without their consent. It might be that they prefer to keep this a verbal obligation. We should note that there is a bit of a paradox here—the Talmud calls them “deeds of stipulation” but then says that they need not be written down.",

After all, the verse uses two verbs—“take” and “has intercourse.” R. Yohanan’s midrash teaches more effectively that intercourse alone is sufficient to create a bond of betrothal.",
            "R. Abba b. Mammel raises a difficulty on the notion that we might think that for betrothal to occur, there needs to acquisition by money and intercourse. According to the Torah, a betrothed virgin who commits adultery is sentenced to death by stoning. But if both betrothal by money and intercourse were necessary for betrothal, then there would be no such thing as a betrothed virgin. She would either be betrothed and not a virgin, or not betrothed at all. ",
            "The rabbis try to answer the objection. It is possible that the betrothal was done through “unnatural (anal) intercourse.” This, with money, would be enough to betroth her. But then she would still be a virgin such that if she committed adultery, she would be sentenced to death by stoning. In other words, unnatural intercourse counts as intercourse, but leaves her as a virgin (yes, this beginning to sound Clintonesque). While this scenario is completely unlikely, it is not, according to these rabbis, impossible.",

Therefore, if she has unnatural intercourse as a means of betrothal, she is not considered a virgin.

If ten men have sex with her, all unnaturally, they are all considered to be having adultery with a betrothed virgin and all are executed by stoning. Rabbi disagrees.

Such an act does not need to be accompanied by intercourse for it to be an effective means of betrothal.<br>Just to track where we are in the argument: we have now successfully explained why R. Yohanan needed another verse to prove that betrothal can be done through intercourse. Without that verse we might have thought that betrothal through intercourse can only be done when first preceded by betrothal through money. Now we know that each means of betrothal can be done independently.   ",
            "R. Yohanan did not use the verse used by Rabbi to prove that intercourse is a means of betrothal. So what does he do with that verse? He uses it to learn that a wife may be betrothed (acquired) through intercourse. But intercourse is not a means to acquire a female slave. The Talmud will now explain why we might have thought that it is.  ",
            "A yevamah, a woman awaiting levirate marriage, is “acquired” through intercourse when the yavam has relations with her. But she is not acquired through money, as a wife is in regular marriage. So if the yevamah, can be acquired through intercourse, I might have thought that the same is true of the Hebrew slave woman, for she can be acquired even through money.",
            "The Talmud pushes back against this argument. I might have thought that a yevamah could be acquired through intercourse because she is already connected to the yavam through her marriage to his now deceased brother. But I would not have thought such a thing about a slave woman who does not have a prior connection to the owner.",
            "The Talmud now invents another reason we would have thought that a female Hebrew slave could be acquired by intercourse. In the verses about such a slave the owner is described as taking another wife. We might have thought that just as this wife is acquired by intercourse, so is the slave. That is why we learn that she is not.<br>As an aside, while it is clear that this slave is not acquired by intercourse, we should note that in the verses the distinction between the slave and a wife is not so clear. It seems that he acquires her so that she might someday become his or his son’s wife. Such an institution did not exist in rabbinic times. And as I’ve said, these discussions are extremely theoretical.",
            "Introduction<br>Today’s section is a direct continuation of yesterday’s. Rabbi [Yehudah Hanasi] now needs to explain from where he derives the halakhah that a Hebrew female slave cannot be acquired through intercourse. From this point on, we’ll continue with a lot more midrashim. ",
            "Rabbi uses the extra word “her” which the verse could have skipped to derive both laws—a woman is betrothed through intercourse but a Hebrew female slave is not.",
            "Rava uses this same verse for yet another halakhah. For kiddushin to be valid, they must be able to be followed by legal intercourse. This is a case which we will learn later in the tractate in which a man married one of two sisters but does not know which one. He cannot have sex with either of them because either of them might be his sister’s wife. Therefore, the kiddushin are not valid.<br>But now we return to our midrashic question—how can Rava learn all three things from one verse.  ",
            "Rava learns another halakhah from the fact that the verse states “and” and not “or.” The betrothal (“when a man takes a woman”) must be inextricably connected with the legality of having intercourse.",
            "Now we have to ask the other question---how does Rabbi use the verse that R. Yohanan used to prove that betrothal can be done through intercourse?<br>He uses it to prove that if the husband has unnatural intercourse with her, she is now considered a non-virgin. But if another man has unnatural intercourse with her, she is still considered a virgin.",

I’m not sure every detail here is so crucial (I know, this is heresy). The overall picture is that every sage must give a midrash for every unusual phrase or word. And no one can use the same verse twice. That’s an ideology held to by the anonymous voice of the Talmud consistently throughout the entire work. But it’s not an ideology shared by the named sages themselves.",
            "Introduction<br>Today’s section contains two halakhic questions concerning kiddushin performed through intercourse. ",
            "If betrothal is done through intercourse, then is the betrothal completed as soon as intercourse begins, or when it is completed (by the man)?<br>The Talmud drums up two ramifications to this question, both seem to be quite unusual. First of all, what happens if while they’re having intercourse, she accepts kiddushin from another man? Dramatic, for sure! Second, can a high priest, who must marry a virgin, betroth her through intercourse? If the beginning of intercourse acquires her, then no problem. But if the end of intercourse acquires her, then no go. She would already be a non-virgin by the time he acquires her.  ",
            "Amemar answers that when men have intercourse (yes, he’s referring to men, not truly “all”), they are intending to “finish” intercourse. Starting intercourse is not really what they want. Therefore, the “acquisition” is not complete until he is finished.<br>I’m sure you’re noticing how male-focused the Talmud is. It was written by men, after all, over 1500 years ago. I’m not sure men knew very much about female sexual pleasure, and besides that, in this case, to them it would not be relevant, for betrothal is the acquisition of a wife, not a wife’s acquisition of a husband.",
            "In normal cases of marriage, a man betroths a woman with money or goods, they wait a while, then when she moves into his home, they have intercourse. Intercourse is what defines marriage. But the Talmud relates to it as a means of betrothal as well. So then, does intercourse effect only betrothal, in which case they would have to have intercourse again in order for marriage to be effected? Or does intercourse effect marriage?<br>There are three ramifications to this question, three important distinctions between a betrothed woman and a married woman. 1) A man inherits from his married wife, but not his fiancée; 2) If he is a priest, he is allowed to defile himself for her, but only if they are married; 3) If they are married, he alone annuls her vows. But if they are betrothed, either she or her father can annul her vows.<br>The rest of this daf will deal with this question. So stay tuned!",
            "Introduction<br>In today’s section Abaye tries to answer the question of whether intercourse causes betrothal or marriage. ",
            "Abaye brings proof from a mishnah in the fourth chapter of Ketubot that even if kiddushin is done through intercourse, there are still two stages of marriage. First she is betrothed, and then the husband has certain rights (and responsibilities). Then she is married and he gains more rights and responsibilities. This intercourse creates betrothal, not marriage. ",
            "The Talmud rejects the proof. There are two stages if she is betrothed by either money or deed. But if she is betrothed through intercourse then she might be immediately considered a married woman.",
            "Introduction<br>Here Rava tries to bring proof that intercourse effects betrothal, not marriage.<br>The baraita that he cites refers to sex with very young girls. I will reiterate what I have said before. Talking about things that are possible is not the same as condoning such activities. While the rabbis (and all ancient people) had different notions of childhood, they did not condone sex with young girls. Rabbis talk about things that are possible, actions have legal significance, without stating their moral opinion about such subjects. This is simply the nature of this literature. I, as I usually do when it comes to such passages, will talk about them in a clinical manner, in the same way I might talk about murder without condemning murder, assuming the reader knows that I, and the text I’m interpreting are not supportive of murder. I hope that my reader knows enough to realize that I do not condone sex with girls close to the age of three.",
            "The baraita basically teaches that intercourse with a girl over three years old “counts.” What this means is that it renders her a non-virgin (as we learned in Ketubot). The baraita now enumerates a number of ramifications. First of all, she can (not should, but can) be betrothed by intercourse. If she has already been married before this age, and her husband dies, the yavam can acquire her through intercourse. If betrothed, adultery with her is punishable by death (to the man, not her). If she menstruates she defiles as does a menstruant. If she is married to a priest, she may eat terumah. Incest with her is also punishable by death (again, for the male not her).. And if she has intercourse with someone prohibited to her, she may no longer marry a priest.<br>The issue at stake here is that first the baraita says that she is betrothed, and then its states that she is married. Like Abaye did yesterday, Rava reads this as two stages, even if betrothal is done through intercourse. Thus intercourse creates betrothal, not marriage. \n"

            "Introduction<br>Today’s daf continues to discuss whether betrothal through intercourse creates betrothal or full marriage. The source cited is a critical argument between two sages over whether a woman betrothed to a Kohen can eat terumah. This is a source I analyze in depth in a forthcoming book (Reconstructing the Talmud: Volume 2). I believe that the issue at hand is how strong Jewish, rabbinic-style betrothal is. If betrothal is “strong” then a woman betrothed to a priest may eat terumah, which is strictly reserved for members of the kohen’s family. A weaker form of betrothal might prohibit this and not allow her to eat terumah until she enters her home. For comparison’s sake, in our society betrothal is relatively weak. A couple who gets engage does not need a divorce to split up. They are not, as far as I know, considered a unit in the eyes of the law. ",

Batera who was residing in Netzivin (currently in Syria) complaining that  the latter was allowing girls betrothed to priests to eat terumah. If we can read into this, we can see that R. Judah seems to espouse a strong form of betrothal, whereas Yohanan b. Bag Bag, an obscure sage, vehemently disagrees with such a notion. While rabbinic literature is full of disputes, it is quite rare for one sage to write a letter to another sage at such a great distance, with what clearly can be read as an attack.",
            "R. Judah b. Batera argues that if a Caananite slave woman can eat terumah after being purchased by a Kohen, even though if the priest has intercourse with her it would not allow her to eat terumah, all the more so an Israelite girl betrothed to a priest through money should also be allowed to eat terumah. After all, intercourse with her would also allow her to eat terumah. The simple meaning of this is that it refers to intercourse as part of marriage. However, the Talmud will try to read this as proof that betrothal through intercourse is sufficient to cause marriage.     ",
            "The Talmud clarifies that in order for Ben Batera’s argument to make sense both the intercourse and the giving of the money must have been the only act performed, not accompanied by huppah. After all, after entering the huppah all agree that she eats terumah.",
            "The Talmud argues that according to Ben Batera intercourse as a means of betrothal creates a bond of marriage. That is why it is obvious to him that a woman eats terumah after intercourse with a Kohen. But if he held that intercourse only creates betrothal, then how could he be so sure that after betrothal through intercourse she eats terumah, but not after betrothal through money.<br>The argument based on this baraita will continue with tomorrow’s section....",

Yitzchak tweaks Ben Batera’s argument such that when he refers to intercourse, he refers to intercourse that follows huppah (in other words marriage) whereas when he refers to betrothal through money, he refers to kiddushin and not huppah. This allows him to hold that intercourse creates a bond of betrothal and not marriage. [Note that this is probably the simple reading of the source—when Ben Batera referred to intercourse, he was referring to the intercourse that typically follows huppah].",

A Canaanite slave acquired through money eats terumah as soon as she is acquired because there are no steps left to fully acquiring her.

The issue is whether the rabbis prohibited it. Ben Bag Bag accuses Ben Batera of not being concerned about a “simpon” which is a way of annulling a sale or contract. If the husband can annul the betrothal then it would turn out that she was never betrothed to the Kohen. If she eats terumah before huppah and then the betrothal is annulled it, retroactively it would turn out that she ate terumah as an Israelite.",

Ben Batera then admits that the sages do not allow a betrothed girl to eat terumah because of Ulla’s concern that she will feed terumah to her relatives. "

        [
            "Ben Bag Bag must now explain why a slave can eat terumah immediately and we’re not concerned about nullification of the sale, whereas a betrothed girl cannot. The answer is that there is no way that the sale of a slave could be annulled by “simpon.” If the flaw is internal or hidden, then the owner should not care about it, because the slave is bought only for work. If the flaw is visible outside of the clothes, then the purchaser accepted the flaw when he bought the slave. If the slave turns out to be a thief or gambler, the sale cannot be annulled. And if the slave turns out to be an armed robber or condemned to die, the sale cannot be invalidated because the purchaser should have known about this before he bought the slave.   ",
            "Both Ben Bag Bag and Ben Batera agree that a woman does not eat terumah until she enters the huppah, so what is it that they’re arguing about? In other words, what is the practical difference between the two reasons why a woman does not eat terumah until she enters the huppah—for fear that she will give the terumah to her family (Ben Batera), or fear that the betrothal will be annulled (Ben Bag Bag)? There are two such differences. First of all, if the husband accepts all of his wife’s defects, then Ben Bag Bag would say that she can eat terumah immediately. But Ben Batera would say she cannot lest she give the terumah to her family members. The other difference is a case where the father delivered his daughter to the husband’s agents or even if the father’s agents have gone with the husband’s agents. In both of these cases the marriage could still be annulled, so Ben Bag Bag would not allow her to eat terumah. But she is no longer with her family, so there is no fear that she will give to her family.",
            "Introduction<br>This week’s daf begins to address the dispute between Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel in the Mishnah. According to Bet Shammai a woman cannot be betrothed for less than a dinar. Bet Hillel says a perutah, a lesser sum.",
            "According to R. Zera, Bet Shammai requires a dinar for betrothal because they assume that a woman would not allow herself to be betrothed for a lesser amount.",

We might assume that they would not agree to be betrothed for less than a heap (a tarkav is a measure of weight) of dinars. And then, if such a woman did accept a dinar as kiddushin, we would have to say that she is not betrothed due to our assumption. But this seems a strange, and incorrect thing to say. Would Bet Shammai really say such a thing? ",
            "R. Zera responds that in his opinion, Bet Shammai requires a dinar only if the woman does not knowingly accept the betrothal. For instance, he betroths her at night and she does not see the coin he gives her. Or he betroths her through an agent. However, if she wants to accept less than a dinar, she does have a right to do so.<br>Note that while this lowers the amount of kiddushin, it gives the woman greater agency. She can get betrothed, even according to Bet Shammai, for whatever amount she wants, as long as we are sure she agrees to it. ",
            "R. Joseph gives a different reason for Bet Shammai. A dinar is a silver coin of Tyrian coinage (from Tyre, no relation to Tyrion, the diminutive Game of Thrones hero). Such coinage was considered to be the standard coinage in the Roman Empire, at least according to rabbinic thinking. [Reality was a bit more complicated, but there is some truth to there being a standard coinage and local coins]. Since the money for betrothal is mentioned in the Torah, it must be in Tyrian coinage. Local coinage can be used for obligations not found in the Torah. The Talmud will continue to explore this statement below.",

Reuven claims that Shimon owes him something and Shimon admits that he owes him some of what Reuven claims but not the whole amount. Shimon now must take an oath that he does not owe him the rest. For this to happen, Reuven’s claim must be for at least two ma’ahs and Shimon must deny at least a perutah. But why two ma’ahs? Why not one? After all, a dinar would seem to be the minimum amount for any money mentioned in the Torah and as the Talmud shows, the source of this oath is from a verse (it is derived midrashically from there)."

Just as the claim must be for “utensils,” i.e. a minimum of two, so too must the claim of money be for at least two coins. These coins must have value, like utensils. So it cannot be for two perutot, which have minimal value.<br>Thus this source does not disprove the rule that any money mentioned in the Torah must be Tyrian coins.",

The fact that second tithe is mentioned in the Torah implies that the minimum amount should be a dinar. And nevertheless, there is a mishnah that refers to a sela of copper coins, which is a lesser amount.<br>The Talmud resolves that this is a special case—the Torah states “the money” and not just “money” to teach that even a lesser amount would be valid as second tithe. ",

But again, we have a verse which means that the minimum amount should be a silver dinar. Yet the halakhah allows less than a silver dinar.<br>The Talmud resolves that this is compared with tithes due to the use of the word “the money.” Just as “the money” with regard to tithes meant that the amount could be less than a dinar, so too with dedicated property.",

Assi would rule according to Bet Shammai who mandates a dinar? This seems to the Talmud to be an impossible supposition.",
            "To solve the difficulty, the Talmud makes a small tweak in the statement attributed to R. Assi. R. Assi was only referring to numbers whose penalty or amount is fixed in the Torah. These include the penalty for accidentally killing a slave, the penalty for rape, seduction and defamation of a virgin, and the redemption of a first born. These amounts must be paid in the higher Tyrian coinage. But just because something is derived from the Torah does not mean that the payment must be in Tyrian coinage. Finally, other amounts mandated by rabbinic law can be paid in the lesser coinage.",

            "R. Assi needed to teach us the second half of his statement, that if the amount is not set by the Torah, it is reckoned in provincial currency, which in rabbinic literature means is considered 1/8 the value of Tyrian currency.<br>We might have not known this because of a baraita with regard to personal injury. The baraita refers to the payment for embarrassing another person. One who boxes another person’s ears must pay a sela. Now normally a sela is worth four zuz (dinar). This would be according to a Tyrian standard and would seem to indicate that the Tyrian standard was used even if the amount is not set in the Torah. However, in light of R. Assi we can interpret this as a lower value, only half a zuz, 1/8 the value of a Tyrian sela. To back this up, the Talmud claims that people do call half a zuz an “istira” an Aramaic word which here seems to be equivalent to the Hebrew word “sela.”",
            "Introduction<br>The sugya continues to try to understand why Bet Shammai rules that a woman cannot be betrothed for less than a dinar. ",
            "R. Shimon b. Lakish says that Bet Shammai derives the rule that a woman is betrothed for a minimum of a dinar from a rule that Hizkiyah stated with regard to the redemption of a slave girl. The Torah says that the girl (or someone else on her behalf) can continue to reduce from the money through which she was purchased. If she was acquired for a dinar, then this could be reduced to a perutah, essentially buying her back. But if she was acquired through a perutah, there is no more money that could be reduced.",
            "Perhaps the notion of deducting is not mandated. He could buy her for whatever amount her father would agree to. She only deducts if there is enough to deduct from."
        ],
        [
            "The Talmud rejects the above notion, positing that like designation, deducting from the sale money must be possible for the sale to be invalid. “Designation” refers to the idea that the owner would marry the girl off to his son. If this is not possible, for instance the son is prohibited to her, then the sale is not valid.<br>I should reemphasize—by rabbinic times such institutions such as selling daughters into slavery did not exist. They are there in the Torah, and therefore rabbis interpret them, but they did not practice them in their real lives. ",
            "As stated above, Beth Shammai derives the laws of betrothal from the laws of the female slave. This is the conclusion of Resh Lakish’s statement.",
            "Although a perutah cannot be used, why does the amount have to go all the way up to a dinar. Why not some amount in-between? The answer is that once a perutah was excluded, they went to the next highest coin.",
            "This is the conclusion of the sugya about why Bet Shammai demands a dinar. Less than a dinar is simply too cheap. It’s treating Jewish women as if they were “hefker,” ownerless property that no one cares about.<br>While this is a more pleasant saying than comparing betrothal to slave acquisition, we should acknowledge that a dinar is still a very low amount of money.",
            "Introduction<br>Today’s sugya begins to discuss Bet Hillel’s opinion, that kiddushin can be performed with a perutah",
            "R. Yosef thought that the perutah that Bet Hillel said was any small coin, no matter how small. But Abaye reminds him that the mishnah actually gives a minimum amount—according to the mishnah, the perutah must weigh an eighth of an Italian issar.",
            "We might have thought that the absolute value of the issar is an antiquated number. According to this line of thought, a perutah is whatever people call it in their time the smallest coin. It would be of indeterminate size. Countering this, Abaye cites a dispute between several amoraim as to the weight of a perutah. Some say it is an eighth of an Italian issar, others say it is a sixth. But all hold that it must have some determined weight.",
            "R. Yosef cites a source in response to Abaye. According to this source, there are more than 2000 perutot in a sela. Now a sela is 4 dinars, and each dinar is 24 issarim. So a dinar equals 192 perutot, and a sela is 768 and two selas is 1536 perutot.<br>Thus a perutah cannot weigh 1/6 or 1/8 of an issar.",
            "An old man corrects the baraita so that there are close to two thousand perutot in two selas, not more. While 1536 is not exactly close to 2000, it has gone past 1500 so we can call it close to 2000. Thus R. Yosef is refuted and a perutah does have an official amount. Below we will explain the dispute over whether it is 1/6 or 1/8 of an issar.",

The only ones he mentions in common with the first opinion are the perutah and the ma’ah. So the math is a bit trickier.

They were actually not arguing at all about the value of the perutah, only referring to different evaluations with regard to the copper issar. When the copper issar was worth more, there would be 24 to the zuz (dinar). In such a case, the perutah referred to need be worth only 1/8 of an issar. But if the issar has been devalued such that it stood at 32 to a dinar, then the perutah must be worth 1/6 of an issar.  But the value of a perutah vis a vis the dinar stays the same—1/192.",

For we are concerned that maybe the item is worth a perutah elsewhere. Essentially what Shmuel is saying is that objects do not have absolute worth. A date might be worth very little in a place where dates are abundant (a kor, a large measure of volume, of dates sells for a dinar). But take one date it to a place where they are not abundant, and its value will go way up.",

Evidently, this woman has tried to become betrothed to another man, assuming that the first marriage was not executed properly because the item was not of value. If R. Hisda starts to be concerned that the item might have been worth a perutah, then the second marriage will turn out to be illegitimate. So R.

Any woman who has had sex with someone prohibited to her cannot marry a Kohen, even if the sex was not willing]. Since they testify that they were taken captive, they are also believed to say that they were not raped (the principle of “the mouth that prohibits is the same mouth that permits”). This is so even though there are witnesses sitting right outside that say that she was taken captive. The principle is clear—the words of witnesses are taken into account only if they actually testify. We are not “concerned” that there might be witnesses elsewhere.",

This is true even though the myrtle branch is probably not worth a perutah, because, as Shmuel taught, we are concerned lest the object is worth a perutah somewhere else.<br>However, he is also to be lashed for Rav said that it is immodest to betroth a woman in the marketplace. This begins a list of actions that are technically legal but should not be done. Betrothal can, according to the mishnah, be performed through intercourse. But Rav does not allow it and punishes one who does so. Shiddukhin are akin to modern betrothal—a non-legal commitment to marry made by the two families. While a man can betroth a woman without arranging it with her parents, Rav would punish one who does so. Annulling a divorce before the get arrives in the woman’s hand is possible. But since it creates so many potential problems, namely the woman might think she is divorced when she is not, Rav punishes one who does so.<br>The next two have to do with respect for rabbinic authority.

There are two situations in the baraita:<br> 1) He says he is giving her the money as a deposit and then changes his mind and say it is kiddushin money. If she accepts the money, she is betrothed, even if she does not say yes. This is because she knows it is kiddushin before she accepts it.<br>2) He gives her the money as a deposit and then says it is kiddushin. If she accepts the proposal, she is betrothed.

Since she did not know what it was before she accepted it, she needs to have an active affirmation of her acceptance.<br>This is how Rava learns that silence after accepting the money is not legally significant. On the other hand, silence before receiving the money is legally significant. The very act of taking the money from the husband counts as kiddushin. "

Rava ruled that she is not betrothed because silence after accepting the money is not legally significant. As a source, Rava cited a baraita in which a man gave a woman a deposit and then, after she accepted the money as a deposit, he said “Be betrothed to me.” If she is silent, she is not betrothed. <br>In today’s section, some amoraim say that the two situations are not analogous.

But in the case Rava adjudicated, the man gave her the mat as kiddushin. Had she not wanted it, she should have thrown it back at him. Silence, therefore, should be akin to acceptance and she is betrothed.",

Today one encounters this usually when the husband transfers the ketubah to the woman. It is also done when selling hametz. With symbolic exchange one does not really acquire the valuable item with the valueless item. Rather, one symbolically uses the valueless item to acquire the valuable one.",

This statement was made in reference to Rav’s statement that if a judge does not know how to enact a divorce or a betrothal, other judges should stay far away from him. R. Assi adds that judges who adjudicate marital matters without knowing how to do so are more harmful to the world than even the generation of the flood, a generation so wicked they were utterly destroyed. The prooftext he brings is from a verse in Hosea, which refers to adultery.<br>R. Joseph interprets this in reference to those who bring forth illegitimate children through adultery. Improper adjudication of matters of divorce and betrothal can also cause illegitimate children to be born. This “adds sins to sins” for not only was the original intercourse sinful, these children will be mamzerim and when they marry into Israel, this too will be in sin (according to rabbinic understanding).<br>R. Assi posits that this sin is worse than the sin of the generation of the flood for in the verse in Hosea even the fish die, whereas in the flood they did not. ",
            "The verse from Hosea refers to more than just adultery. It also refers to other sins. So perhaps the world is not destroyed unless people commit all of these sins. How does R. Assi know that improper adjudication of marital law which causes unintentional adultery is alone sufficient to cause the destruction of the world?<br>A verse from Jeremiah implies that the world is destroyed from false oaths alone. This was the first sin mentioned in the verse. So if the world is destroyed for this sin alone, then the sins in the rest of the verse, including causing adultery, are also sufficient for the world to be destroyed.     ",
            "Had the conjunctive “and” been used, then we would have read the verse that all of the sins need to be committed for the world to be destroyed. But since there is no conjunctive, the rabbis can read the verse as if one sin alone is sufficient.  "

According to Rav Judah this is so only if she already set the sacrifice aside. If she did not, her heirs do not need to bring it.<br>From here we can see that the mere fact that she is obligated to bring the offering is not enough to make her heirs obligated. Debt obligation, thus, is not from the Torah such that it should pass from one generation to the other.",

            "The same dispute between Shmuel and R. Yohanan exists elsewhere. The case here is where one’s father (or someone else from whom one inherits) incurs a debt without a written contract. According to Rav and Shmuel, the heirs cannot collect. They hold, therefore, that debt is not “from the Torah” such that it can be bequeathed to an inheritor. In contrast, Resh Lakish and R. Yohanan hold that the heirs can collect the debt. Thus debt must be from the Torah.<br>The question the Talmud asks is why we need two cases to illustrate the same principle. Once we know the principle that debt is or is not from the Torah shouldn’t we be able to figure out the particulars?",

Therefore, we need to learn that they do not. Debt is never bequeathed.  ",

On the other hand, if a purchaser buys land from someone not knowing that the seller had some debt because the debt was incurred by a verbal contract, he need not pay off the debt.

It rejects a kal vehomer argument that would argue that designation also works to make it holy.

            "Introduction<br>Today’s section begins a new mishnah, one concerned with the acquisition and release of slaves. There are different rules for Hebrew slaves than there are for “Canaanite” slaves—non-Jewish slaves.  One of the major differences is that all of the biblical verses which discuss a slave’s going free after a certain period of time are considered by the rabbis as referring to Hebrew slaves.  This includes Exodus 21:1-11; Leviticus 25:39-44, 47-55; Deuteronomy 15:12-18.  Leviticus 25:44-46 refers to Canaanite slaves.  Non-Jewish slaves are called “Canaanite” after Genesis 9:25, “Cursed be Canaan; the lowest of slaves shall he be to his brothers.”  The major difference between the two is that a Hebrew slave goes free automatically after a certain number of years of servitude, whereas a Canaanite slaves works in perpetuity.  We should note that the practice of owning Hebrew slaves was probably non-existent, or at least almost non-existent, in the mishnaic/talmudic periods.  However, Jews did own non-Jewish slaves.  Slavery was a common feature of the Greco-Roman world.  The halakhah in general mandates relatively liberal treatment of the slave, but it did not forbid slavery.  ",
            "<b>Section one:</b> There are two possibilities for how an Israelite can legally be sold as a slave. First of all, he may sell himself into slavery in order to pay off his debts.  In such a case he may be sold to a Jew or to a Gentile.  The second possibility is that the court may sell him in order to make compensation for something he sold.  The mishnah teaches that in these cases the sale must be done either through money or through a sale document.<br><b>Section two:</b>  The slave goes free after six years of servitude, as is taught in the beginning of chapter 21 of Exodus.  If the Jubilee year, which occurs once every fifty year, happens before he serves out his six years, then he goes free earlier (see Leviticus 25:40).  If the slave somehow earns enough money to pay back the original sale price, he has the right to do so at any time.  For instance if he was sold for 600 denar, and he would have worked for six years, each year is worth 100 denar, and depending upon when he wants to buy himself back, he pays back 100 denar per year left of work.  The master cannot refuse to allow the slave to buy himself back.  In this way, the Hebrew slave is more like an indentured servant than truly a slave.<br><b>Section three:</b>  The sale of female Hebrew slaves is even more restricted.  According to halakhah there is no such thing as a female adult Hebrew slave.  She can only be sold as a minor and when she shows physical signs of reaching maturity (pubic hair) she becomes free automatically, without having to pay back her sale price.  In addition, she can also become free in any of the ways that a male Hebrew slave becomes free.  It seems that the institute of minor female slaves was probably a way for the father to marry off his daughter without paying a dowry.  While this practice seems cruel to us, it may have been a better option for the daughter than some alternatives.<br><b>Section four:</b>  In Exodus 21:5-6 we learn that a slave who does not wish to regain his freedom must have his ear pierced and then he may work indefinitely for his master.  The piercing causes him to be acquired to his master for a period beyond the normal period of servitude.  However, he does not work forever and his master’s inheritors do not inherit him.  Rather he goes free either at his master’s death or at the Jubilee year, whichever comes first.  At this point, even if he wishes to remain a slave he has no such choice.  ",
            "Leviticus refers to the money the slave was purchased for. Thus it is clear that a slave is purchased through money.",
            "The verse in Leviticus refers to a Jew sold to a non-Jew. A non-Jew according to halakhah always acquires objects through money, and not through any other means. But a Jew can acquire through other means (such as taking possession or a document). So how do we know that a Jew acquires slaves through money?<br>This is learned from a verse referring to the female slave. If a female slave acquires money she deducts the value of the time served from her purchase money and buys back her own freedom. Thus she was clearly acquired for money.     ",
            "The verse from Exodus referred only to a female Hebrew slave. But we can extend the same law to a male Hebrew slave through the comparison made in Deuteronomy. Both can be acquired through money.",
            "The verse in Deuteronomy referred to a Jewish slave sold by the court to pay back a debt incurred by stealing. Since the money needs to be recovered it is obvious that he is acquired through money. But what about a Jew who sells himself into slavery? This is learned from the repetition of the word “sakhir” This word, which means “hired laborer,” is used in both Leviticus (one who sells himself) and Deuteronomy (one who is sold by the court). Therefore, the same rules apply to both.",

            "Introduction<br>Yesterday we heard of a dispute about whether one can derive laws from comparing one use of the word “sakhir” with the other—some do and some don’t. Today’s sugya discusses who does not derive laws from the repetition of the word. ",
            "The baraita here contains a dispute about the laws governing a Hebrew slave. There are two possibilities as to how a Jew could be sold into slavery—he could sell himself into slavery to recover a debt or the court. The rabbis read Leviticus 25:40 as referring to a Jew who sells himself and Deuteronomy 15:18 as a case where the court sells him. Deuteronomy limits the term of servitude to six years, it provides an opportunity to extend the servitude by having a hole bored in his ear and it mandates the owner provide him with a gift upon release. Exodus 21, parallel to Deuteronomy, also allows the master to give him a Canaanite slave-woman as a wife. Leviticus does not contain any of these provisions. To the tanna kamma (the first opinion) this means that the rules governing these two situations are different. To R. Elazar the same rules govern both. ",
            "Abaye claims that both parties are willing to derive halakhah by comparing the word “sakhir.” This will mean that for other matters, ones not discussed in this baraita, all rabbis will use this midrashic technique. However, for these particular matters the tanna kamma reads the verse in Deuteronomy as excluding one who sold himself into slavery. He, the one who is sold by the court, receives all of these benefits, but not the one who sold himself into slavery. In other words, the reason for the dispute is not that the rabbis refuse in principle to apply the laws  Deuteronomy to the situation referred to in Leviticus. Rather, the dispute is over how to read the verse in Deuteronomy.",

But, the rabbis argue, this cannot refer to either a slave sold into slavery by the court or one who sells himself into slavery, because both of these types of slaves are already referred to (according to rabbinic interpretation) in the passage later in Leviticus 25 that refers directly to slaves. Therefore, this passage must refer to a slave whose ear has been bored, meaning he served his six year period and then chose to remain. He too goes free at the Jubilee.",

Thus it is clear why we need the Torah to teach that he goes free at the Jubilee. The harder question is why does the Torah state that he serves forever? What wrong supposition would I have without this word? The answer is that we might have thought that after having his ear bored, the slave serves another six years, but no more. Just as he served six years before, so he serves six years after. That is why the Torah teaches “forever” which in light of Leviticus means that he serves only until the Jubilee.",

This proves that Rabbi does not learn from the repetition of the word “sakhir” for the word “sakhir” is used in both the context of a Jew sold to Gentiles and a Jew sold to other Jews.

In normal cases a minor cannot marry a woman because he cannot betroth her—betrothal requires “awareness” which he is considered to lack. But this yavam need not “acquire” his wife—she is connected to him by Torah law because the Torah mandates she be married to the brother-in-law. When he has intercourse with her, he now becomes a “minor” husband. We might have thought that his wife is subject to the laws of adultery, therefore the baraita needs to teach us that she is not.

By implication, he cannot designate her unless there is time left in her service for her to work the value of a perutah. R. Yose son of R. Yehudah reads the Torah as if it says that the master betroths (designates) her with the value of the work she has left to perform. Forgiving her from having to do the work is the kiddushin money.

Yehudah said that the original sale was not the money for kiddushin. When the master designates her, he must give her kiddushin money or forgive her a perutah’s worth of work.

The master gives money and the daughter owes the master a certain amount of work. She herself is the collateral, held by the master until she completes the work. And then when he betroths her, he forgives her at least a perutah’s worth of work. So he is essentially forgiving a loan and returning the collateral.

She is betrothed to the first, for the baraita considers his betrothal as having begun “now.” The question is—what does this have to do with the slave designation? And with whose opinion does this accord?",

This is not like the case of betrothal that begins at two different times.<br>Rather, the parable is similar to the ruling of the rabbis. The betrothal begins with the sale but is only completed when he designates her. So too this man’s betrothal begins when he gives her the kiddushin and is only completed at the end of thirty days. If another man tries to betroth her in-between, she is not betrothed. ",
            "We might have thought that since the master, when buying the slave, did not say that his betrothal was beginning at this point, this is not analogous to the case of “from now and after thirty days,” therefore the baraita needed to teach us that it is.",

Therefore, if the father betroths her to someone else, she is betrothed. While this is a betrayal of the master, it is effective. The sages say that the master can designate her, even if the father tried to betroth her to someone else. They hold that the sale essentially was an act of betrothal.<br>The baraita draws a parable to a man who betroths a woman after thirty days.

This category would primarily include a mamzer.<br>The baraita argues that we should not need this word, that it is logical that he should be able to sell her to those unfit to her. After all, a father can betroth his daughter to those unfit to her (he should not do so, but he has the legal ability). And if something is logical, then we do not need a verse to teach it.<br>To counter this, the baraita argues that a father has rights with regards to betrothing his daughter that he does not have with regard to selling her. He can betroth her when she is a na’arah, a young girl, but he can only sell her when she is a minor. Thus we might have thought that he can betroth her to a mamzer, but not sell her to one.

But this argument is easily debunked. He can sell her to those unfit for her, because even though designation would be prohibited, it would still be possible. But we might have thought that he cannot sell her to relatives because these relatives could not designate her.

            "R. Aha son of Rava argues that one cannot derive the laws regarding redeeming a consecrated field from the laws governing redeeming half of a house in a walled city. The latter may not be redeemed in halves because he has less power in general—it must be redeemed within a year. But one who consecrates a field can redeem it until the Jubilee. So maybe he should be able to redeem it in halves. This is the opposite of what the baraita at the end of last week’s daf stated.",
            "Consecrating an ancestral field is both similar and different to the case of selling an ancestral field and selling a house in a walled city. Since there is something different from both, we cannot use either one to prove that one cannot borrow and redeem or redeem half of a consecrated ancestral field. But together, the commonality can be used to prove that just as in the other two cases one cannot borrow and redeem or redeem half, so too one cannot borrow and redeem or redeem half of a consecrated ancestral field.<br>We should note that this is a common midrashic technique—it is easier to learn one unknown from two knowns then from one known. ",
            "To refute the above argument, we would need to find a feature common to the two known cases (selling an ancestral field, selling a house in walled city) that is not shared by the unknown (consecrating an ancestral field). And this is exactly what Mar Zutra does. The first two have an impaired power, in that they cannot be redeemed in the second year—the one who sells an ancestral field cannot redeem it during the first two years, whereas the one who sells a walled house cannot redeem it after the first year. But one who consecrates an ancestral field can redeem it during the second year. So maybe he can also borrow and redeem or redeem it in halves.",
            "Ravina brings in yet another case to compare, one that is further removed from the issue of selling/consecrating ancestral lands. A Hebrew slave sold to a non-Jew may be redeemed in the second year, and yet he cannot borrow and redeem or redeem half. This is a law we learned earlier on the last daf. So too we could say about the one who consecrates an ancestral field. Just because he can redeem in the second year, does not mean that he redeem half or borrow and redeem.",
            "Introduction<br>Our sugya is about whether a house sold in a walled city can be redeemed by relatives.<br>Again, I am quoting here the relevant verses from Leviticus 25:29-30:<br>If a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, it may be redeemed until a year has elapsed since its sale; the redemption period shall be a year.<br>If it is not redeemed before a full year has elapsed, the house in the walled city shall pass to the purchaser beyond reclaim throughout the ages; it shall not be released in the jubilee.",
            "In last week’s daf we learned that a like an ancestral field, a house in a walled city cannot be half redeemed. Leviticus 25:25 explicitly says that the ancestral field can be redeemed by relatives. So the question is does the comparison of the two carry over for that issue as well. Or does it only teach that neither can be redeemed in halves.",
            "The midrash reads Leviticus 25:24 as teaching that relatives may redeem houses and Hebrew slaves. The assumption is that this refers to a house in a walled city.<br>The Talmud then rejects this and posits that it refers to a house sold in a village that does not have a wall. ",
            "The Torah seems to explicitly say that houses in open villages are not classed as houses in walled cities, and thus can be redeemed by relatives. So why would need a midrash to teach this.",
            "The Talmud responds that the similarity between houses in a walled city and open fields is that relatives have an obligation to redeem both of them (as long as they have the ability to do so). This accords with R. Eliezer, who holds that whenever relatives can redeem land or houses sold by their family, they must do so. R. Joshua holds that it is an option, not an obligation.<br> This allows us to restore R. Sheshet’s answer—relatives may not redeem houses in walled cities.     ",
            "Leviticus 25:24 uses the word “in all.” This inclusive phrase should mean that even houses in walled cities and not just even house in villages can be redeemed by relatives. But to R. Sheshet, who held that they can’t, what does “in all” come to include? After all, we already know that houses in villages can be redeemed by relatives. ",
            "Abaye raises another difficulty against R. Sheshet who held that houses in walled cities cannot be redeemed by relatives.<br>A midrash reads the repetition of the word “he shall redeem him” as indicating that all cases of redemption have the same “order of redemption” that appears in connection with a Hebrew slave sold to a Gentile—first the brother should redeem him, next the uncle or some other relative and if not, then anyone else. So too, Abaye argues, when it comes to houses in walled cities or Hebrew slaves sold to Jews. ",
            "The Talmud resolves Abaye’s difficulty by saying that the midrash refers only to houses in villages and ancestral fields.<br>But again, there is a problem, same as above. We have a verse that explicitly teaches that houses in villages have the same rule as ancestral fields. So why would we need a midrash to teach that. ",
            "The Talmud solves this by referring to a statement made in another context—that the nearest relative has the first obligation to redeem the house in the village. That is what this midrash teaches. But neither midrash need be read as teaching that houses in walled cities can be redeemed by relatives. ",
            "Introduction<br>Yesterday’s section concluded with the statement of R. Nahman b. Yitzchak, that the closer a relative is, the more he takes precedence in the obligation to redeem a field, a slave or a house. Today’s section examines where he made this statement.<br>Note that the structure and content of this section is very similar to yesterday’s. So my comments here will be a bit briefer.  ",
            "The Talmud shifts to the question of whether a Hebrew slave sold to an Israelite, and not a Gentile, can be redeemed. Rabbi clearly holds that he cannot, but what about the rabbis. The rabbis could employ either of two midrashic techniques. They could expound on the use of the word “sakhir” and say that the laws referring to being sold to a non-Jew apply to the case of a slave sold to a Jew. Or they could read the word “may redeem him” exclusively—relatives may redeem “him,” the one sold to a non-Jew. But they may not redeem the one sold to a Jew. ",
            "Again, the Talmud invokes a term read as inclusive—“in all.” This is read as teaching that Hebrew slaves can be redeemed by relatives. The initial assumption is that this refers even to Hebrew slaves sold to other Jews. But then the Talmud rejects this and says it refers only to slaves sold to non-Jews. ",
            "The Torah explicitly states that a Hebrew slave may be redeemed by a relative. So why would we need a special midrash to teach this elsewhere? <br>The answer is that the verse “in all” comes to add that redeeming a Hebrew slave sold to a non-Jew is obligatory, even according to R. Joshua who holds that redeeming land is optional. We have now rejected the first answer to the question as to whether Hebrew slaves sold to Jews may be redeemed. We need another source to find an answer."

        [
            "This section is nearly identical to that found in the end of yesterday’s section.<br>The repetition of “he shall redeem him” is read as teaching that all redemptions are the same, and by this the Talmud tries to extend it to the ability of relatives to redeem Hebrew slaves sold to Israelites. <br>The Talmud then rejects that and claims that the verse refers only to the redemption of houses in villages and ancestral fields. But then, again, the difficulty is raised that it is explicitly stated that these may be redeemed by relatives. So what then does the midrash “in all” come to include.<br>R. Nahman b. Yitzchak reads this midrash as teaching that the nearest relative comes first. So again, we arrive at the conclusion that according to the rabbis while Hebrew slaves sold to non-Jews, fields and houses in villages may be redeemed by relatives, Jews sold to other Jews may not. They will need to either redeem themselves or complete their six year term.",

Evidently, a hole in the earlobe was considered a blemish while a hole in the upper part of the ear, on the cartilage was not. The reason to avoid “blemishing” the slave was that if he was a priest, he would not be able to return to serving as a priest with a permanent blemish. Thus the rabbis say that when boring, we must take into consideration his status after the Jubilee when he is no longer a priest. ",

Rabbi uses a midrashic technique that focuses on sequences of generalizations and specifications.

From the definitive article “the” Rava derives that the prohibition applies only to the most important part of the thigh. So too here we can derive that the article implies only the most important of awls—the great awl. ",

It is clearly a problematic law for it allows a man to essentially take a woman against her will.

Therefore, since priests also have this inclination, they too are allowed to have relations with the captive woman. But the second time, after she converts, is disputed. Rav says that since the first act was permitted, she stays permitted to him. Shmuel says that she is a convert and since priests cannot marry converts, a priest cannot marry this woman.",

This is not something that can be done in peace time.<br>2)\tThe rule applies even if she is already married to a non-Jewish man.<br>3)\tThe reason that the Torah calls her beautiful is that it realizes the evil inclination of men. The Torah preferred to the lesser evil of basically forced marriage to what would basically be rape. This is a concession, not an ideal<br>4)\tWhile the Torah calls her beautiful, the law applies to any woman the man desires.<br>5)\tThe soldier can only take one such wife, not two.<br>6)\tHe must marry her (after the first intercourse).<br>7)\tHe cannot take two women, one for him and one for a family member.<br>8)\tHe cannot have sex with her there on the battlefield.

But the problem is that the children were not sold. Only the father was. So why state that they go free? To solve this problem R. Shimon rules that the master is responsible for the upkeep of the children while the father is a slave. Once the slave goes free, the master is no longer responsible for them.

However, they disagree over whether or not the slave may purchase himself back.  According to Rabbi Meir a Canaanite slave can never own property.  Any property which he would acquire would automatically become the property of his owner, since the owner owns the slave.  Therefore, only other people may purchase the slave’s freedom.

This is possible if other people give the slave money with the condition that the owner not take possession of that money.  According to the Sages either he or others may purchase his freedom.  Similarly, they disagree about the document.  The master can write out a manumission document, give it to another person beside the slave and thereby free the slave.  Note that the Sages could have stated that “a slave is acquired by documents or money through his own agency or the agency of others.”  This would have been a clearer and slightly briefer statement of the sages’ intent.  Instead, the mishnah phrases their statement as the opposite of Rabbi Meir’s statement in order to retain the parallelism.    ",

The first possibility is that the slave has not consented to be set free. But this should not work for R. Meir holds that it is not to the slave’s advantage to go free. And we also know that a person cannot cause disadvantage to another without his consent. Therefore this cannot refer to a case where the slave has not consented to be set free. ",

We might have thought that a slave can acquire himself through a deed even through his own agency, and not exclusively through his own agency. The innovation here would be that his freedom and his ability to acquire arrive at the same moment, such that at the same moment he is set free, he is also able to acquire the document. The problem is that there is a baraita in which R. Meir explicitly states that a slave acquires himself by document only through his own agency, not if the document is accepted by others.<br>Thus we now no longer have an acceptable situation for the Mishnah. If the slave did not consent, then why can others set him free by paying for his freedom? And if he did consent, then why can’t others accept a document of manumission on his behalf?",

The slave goes free when his master receives the money. It is not that others are causing him disadvantage. But if the slave goes free by document he goes free when the others accept the document. Therefore, they are causing him detriment, and one may not cause detriment to another without his consent.",
            "Introduction<br>Today’s section continues to deal with who accepts the money and document when a Canaanite slave goes free. ",
            "According to the rabbis, a Canaanite slave can buy his own freedom but others cannot buy his freedom. But why not? After all, even if this is done without his knowledge, the rabbis still hold that it is to the slave’s advantage to go free, and one can cause an advantage to a person without his knowledge. So why can’t they accept the money to set him free?",
            "We might have thought, as we tried to propose in yesterday’s section, that when it says that he may free himself it means “even through his own agency,” and then say that what this teaches us is that his right to acquire money and his freedom come simultaneously. Thus he can acquire the money to use to buy himself free. But the problem is that the end of this clause in the mishnah teaches that when it comes to the document, the slave can become free by a document accepted by others, but not by one that he himself accepts. The problem is that we hold that his freedom and his ability to accept a document also come simultaneously. This means that he should be able to accept his own deed of emancipation.",
            "If we try to solve this last problem by positing that the slave can be redeemed even when others accept the document on his behalf, and also when he accepts the document, and that this mishnah teaches that it is to the slave’s advantage to go free (and thus others can receive his document), then we encounter the problem that both clauses say the same thing. So why teach them as independent clauses?",

            "Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section we learned that R. Shimon be Elazar holds that if the slave goes free by a document of emancipation, it must be accepted by others. The slave cannot accept it himself. Here Rabbah explains why. ",
            "R. Shimon b. Elazar derives his law by connecting the word “lah” (to her) found in Leviticus 19:20 in the context of a female slave going free with the word “lah” in the context of divorce in Deuteronomy 24:3. When it comes to divorce, the woman must take the get into a domain that is hers (this would include her hand). The husband can also put in onto property that belongs to her. But it must leave his property. So too, when it comes to a slave going free, the slave must take the domain into property that does not belong to the master. This would preclude accepting the deed of emancipation himself.",
            "Introduction<br>Rabbah continues to discuss the opinion of R. Shimon b. Elazar who holds that a Caananite slave cannot receive his own deed of emancipation.",
            "In yesterday’s section we saw that R. Shimon b. Elazar derives the laws of a slave going free from the case of a woman being divorced. So now we have to ask whether a slave, like a woman being a divorced, can appoint an agent to receive his deed of emancipation.<br>Rabbah asks the question, and then answers it himself. Like a woman, he can."
        ],
        [
            "Elsewhere R. Huna son of R. Joshua says that priests serving in the Temple are agents of God and not agents of the people whose sacrifices they are offering. They cannot be our agents because an agent should not be able to do something that the person sending him cannot do himself. But now we do have a case of an agent being able to do something that the person himself cannot do. A slave’s agent can accept the slave’s deed of manumission, whereas the slave himself cannot.<br>Thus we have a difficulty on R. Huna.",
            "The Talmud rejects the difficulty on R. Huna. An Israelite can never offer sacrifices himself. The laws of sacrificing in the Temple simply do not apply to him. However, a slave can accept a deed of manumission, just not his own. Thus these laws do apply to him, and therefore, he can appoint an agent to receive his own deed of manumission.",
            "Introduction<br>According to the sages, a slave can redeem himself by means of money that he himself gives the master, but the money must come from others. R. Meir says that the others must give the money. ",
            "The Talmud presents a possible explanation of the dispute in the mishnah. R. Meir would hold that a slave cannot acquire property independent of his master (nor a wife independent of her husband). The second the money goes into his hand, it belongs to his master. Therefore, the slave cannot give the money to free himself. The other rabbis say that a slave can acquire money separate from his master. So if others give him money to redeem himself, he can take the money and redeem himself.",
            "According to Rabbah, in general everyone holds that anything a slave acquires, his master automatically acquires as well. The dispute in the mishnah is only in a case where someone gives the slave money on condition that the master not have any rights to it. R. Meir says that this condition does not work, whereas the rabbis hold that it does. Therefore, R. Meir holds that there is no way for the slave to buy his own freedom, whereas the rabbis would hold that as long as others gave him the money and said, “on condition that your master has no right to it,” the slave may use that money to free himself.",
            "R. Elazar says that the third party cannot really say “on condition that your master has no right to it.” All would agree that such a condition does not prevent the master from gaining rights to the money acquired by the slave. R. Meir and the rabbis rather disagree about a case where the third party says “on condition that with it you go free.” To R. Meir this still does not work and the master acquires it immediately. The other rabbis hold that this works because the third party did not transfer ownership of the maneh to the slave—he only gave it to the slave for the slave to free himself. Since the slave has not come into possession of the maneh, he is able to use it become emancipated.",
            "Introduction<br>Today’s section contrasts the opinions of R. Meir and the sages with what appear to be contradictory opinions found elsewhere. At the end of last week we read of the following dispute:<br>What are we dealing with here? For instance a stranger gave him a maneh, saying: “On condition that with it you go free.”<br>R. Meir holds: When he says to him, “Acquire [it,]” the slave acquires it and so does his master; and when he says to him, “on condition [etc.],” he says nothing.<br>Whereas the Rabbis hold: He did not give transfer ownership of it [even] to him [the slave], since he said to him, “On condition that with it you go free",
            "Second tithe produce is usually redeemed, the money is brought to Jerusalem and used there to buy food products. The issue here is a woman redeeming her husband’s second tithe. When one redeems one’s own second tithe, one is liable to pay an added fifth. But when redeems someone else’s second tithe, one need not add the fifth.<br>According to the first opinion, that of the sages, the woman essentially is like her husband, and therefore she must add the fifth. According to R. Meir she need not add the extra fifth.  \n"
        ],
        [
            "If the money and the tithe are her husband’s then all would agree that she is her husband’s agent and must add the fifth. And if it is her money (inherited), then all should agree that she is exempt from the tithe.<br>Therefore, the Talmud suggests that it must be a case where someone gives her money on condition that she use it to redeem the tithe. The rabbis hold that this money is automatically her husband’s and therefore, she is his agent and must add the fifth. R. Meir says it is not automatically her husband’s and therefore she need not add the fifth.<br>These opinions are opposite of those we saw above, and thus both seem to be contradictory. ",
            "Abaye says that we should reverse the opinions.<br>But, as usually happens, Rava finds a way not to reverse the opinions. The case is one of tithe which she inherits from her father’s estate. According to R. Meir, second tithe is holy, and therefore her husband does not acquire it. When she redeems the produce, she is redeeming her own tithe.<br>The other rabbis hold that second tithe is not holy.

This seems to prove that the movables (in this case the deed) need not be on the land, for the seller has transferred ownership of the field and through it he has transferred the document as well.<br>The Talmud rejects this as proof—the deed is like the land. It is not a different type of movable, like sheep or barrels. The deed is not transferred by being connected to the land—it simply is part of the transaction of the land.",

This implies that this deed is considered like other movables. It is acquired through acquisition of the land.<br> And that folks ends our discussion of this issue. Movables may be acquired together with land even if the movables are not on that piece of land.<br>I should note that in the middle ages a technique developed whereby a person could transfer movables based on the idea that every Jew owns “four cubits of land in Israel.” I would give you (temporarily) my four cubits of land and with that I could also give you my movables, even if the movables were far way. This facilitated the transfer of movables without one actually having to own land, let alone put the movables on the land.",

This seems to prove that one can give the land to one person and the movables to another.",

It might have been rented only for the tithe, in which case it was, in a sense, rented to the poor, those who also received the tithes.<br>Alternatively, R. Akiva may be considered like the poor because he is the charity collector. Thus R. Gamaliel was giving to R. Akiva, and not to the poor.

The clause reads:<br>And it obligates the property which provides security, to take an oath concerning them.<br>In Mishnah Shevuoth 6:5 we learned that people do not take oaths over land.  For instance, if Reuven claims that Shimon owes him land, and Shimon admits to part of the claim, he need not swear that he does not owe him the rest, as he would were Reuven to claim that Shimon owes him money or animals.  However, if Shimon needs to take an oath over movable property and land, since he must take an oath over the movable property he must also take an oath over the land.  This could happen if Reuven claims that Shimon owes him a piece of land and a 100 sheep.  If Shimon admits that half of the land is Reuven’s and half of the sheep, he must take an oath over both the land and the sheep which he claims not to owe.  ",
            "At the basis of the mishnah in Kiddushin is the idea of “the extension of the oath,” gilgul shevuah in Hebrew. The idea is that if you are liable for an oath for one thing but not for another, since you must take the oath on one item, I can also impose on you an oath for the other thing as well.<br>Ulla claims that this idea comes from the repetition of the word “amen” when the sotah woman, suspected of adultery, responds to the oath administered to her. The second “amen” is an oath that she did not commit adultery with any other man. The Talmud will explore this and eventually show that one of these oaths is what we would call an “extension of an oath.”    ",

            "The husband cannot make his betrothed wife take an oath. But if he is making his married wife take an oath, he can at the same time make her take an oath that she did not have relations with another man while betrothed. This is the biblical proof of the technique of “extension of an oath.”",
            "Introduction<br>Last week we concluded by learning about “oath extensions” (Hebrew, גלגול שבועה). The idea is that if a person can legally make someone take an oath about X, he can also make him take an oath about Y, even though he cannot alone make him take an oath on Y. This was learned from the case of the Sotah.<br>Sotah is what is called a “prohibition” which loosely refers to laws that are really between God and humanity (Shabbat, kashrut, purity etc). The question is can oaths be extended in the realm of monetary law as well. ",
            "To make the woman drink the Sotah waters and take the oath, two witnesses are needed. But a claimant needs only one witness to make someone take an oath that they do not owe money.

            "How do we know that a person can make another take an oath by extension even if he is not certain about that he owes him money? The answer is by comparison with the sotah oaths. The sotah oath is by its very nature a case of uncertainty. We do not know if the woman committed adultery or not. Nevertheless, she can be forced to take an oath and an oath by extension. So too in cases that occur outside the Temple—one can force another to take an oath by extension even in cases of uncertainty.",

This is not a good example, therefore, of an oath being overextended. It is a simple extension of an oath from one issue of money to another.",

So what new halakhah are we learning here?<br>The answer is that were it not for this statement, I would have thought that oath extensions work for land, because people sell land secretly. The purpose of the oath is to uncover the truth, truth that would not have been otherwise unknown. So one might need to make the other take an oath over land. But if a person sells himself into slavery, everyone would know that he had done so. Therefore, we would not need to make him take an oath over such a matter. This is why the Talmud says oath extensions can even go this far. Even though it seems very unlikely that B is actually A’s Hebrew slave (had this been true we would know of it), A can still make him take an oath that he is not.",

If Reuven and Shimon exchange an ox for a cow, when Reuven takes physical possession of Shimon’s cow, Shimon becomes owner of the ox, even if Shimon doesn’t take physical possession.  The implication would be that if the ox dies or is stolen, Shimon is out of luck for it is his ox that died or was stolen.  Alternatively, if the oxen market rises dramatically Shimon wins out.  For better or for worse, in an exchange once one party takes possession of one of the objects being exchanged, the other party automatically owns the other object.",

This would mean that if I give you money for your cow, then I have acquired your cow and neither of us can renege. The problem with this is that we have learned that money cannot be used to acquire objects.",
            "Rav Judah explains the mishnah—for an item to be used as barter it must be something that does not have a value that can be expressed in its own terms. For instance, I could say a Hershey Bar is worth four Hershey kisses or two Goldenberg’s chews (I really loved those). But I cannot say how much a Hershey bar is worth in terms of Hershey bars. But a coin’s value is expressed on its own terms—a dollar is worth a dollar. Therefore, coins cannot be used in barter."

        [

The first part of the mishnah refers to coin, which can be used as barter, and the second half refers to produce (or what we could call edible products) which can also be used for barter. Note that prior to this we would not have thought that produce can be used for barter. If I want to trade you my Hershey bars for you Reeses cups, you would not take possession of the Hershey bars until you took them into your possession. But if it can be used as barter, then you would possess them as soon as I took the peanut butter cups.",

We should note that this is a new problem, not related to the previous one. How can R. Nahman even understand the mishnah which does seem to say that produce and animals and not just vessels can be used for barter.",
            "This is an entire reinterpretation of the mishnah such that the mishnah does not teach that produce or animals can effect barter. My explanation follows Rashi. The beginning of the mishnah states that money can sometimes be used to acquire through barter, even though the money was given as such and not as a form of barter. If Reuven sold Shimon an ox for a man, and Shimon drew the animal to him, he is now liable to give the maneh to Reuven. Reuven now says “Give me the cow instead of the money.” Shimon says yes. If Shimon says, “I am giving you this cow in place of the money” Reuven acquires the cow without having to pull it towards himself. We have now avoided the problem of produce effecting barter.  ",
            "Generally speaking money cannot acquire—so why did this mishnah allow money to acquire (in this limited circumstance)? The answer is that from the Torah, money can acquire. The rabbis decreed that money does not acquire goods lest someone sell some wheat, take the money and then tell the other person that his wheat was burned. In other words, the law that money does not acquire was created for the protection of the buyer. ",

The problem is that if he holds like R. Nahman that produce cannot effect barter, how can he understand the mishnah? So in the end, you have to say that he holds like R. Sheshet, who holds that produce can effect barter. So he can interpret the mishnah in the following manner quoted from above: “And produce too can effect a barter. How so? If one barters the meat of ox for a cow, or the meat of donkey for an ox, as soon as one party takes possession, the other assumes liability for what is given in exchange.”",

We might have thought that he could stop working because he’ll just continue working later, and he is not cheating his employer of his paid time. The Talmud says that even this is not allowed because it takes up time in which he could be completing the project. I think there is an important message in this piece, one that is very hard to observe these days, with all of the distractions in our lives.

Why do we need all three?<br>The first would not be sufficient to teach that women are subject to all civil law because women did not engage in commerce as did men.<br>The second, about civil law, would not be sufficient to teach that if an animal kills a woman the owner must pay a ransom because women are not obligated in all commandments, as are men. (I know, this is a bit of an ugly one. But I do think it is a faithful representation of what happens when you exempt people from commandments. You might start to think that there life is less worthy than those fully commanded. This seems to be what might have happened to at least one strand of rabbinic thought).<br>If all we had was the third rule we might have thought that in that case, men and women were equated because it is a matter of life.

Only men lay their hands upon the sacrifice. When women bring the sacrifice, no one lays their hands.<br><b>Waving:</b>  After the animal is slaughtered parts of it are waved jointly by the priest and by the male owner of the sacrifice (see Lev. 7:30).  If a woman brought the sacrifice the priest waves it by himself.<br><b>Presenting [the meal-offering]:</b>  When a person brings a meal-offering (a minhah), they present it to the priest. The priest then takes it and presents it to the altar (Lev. 6:7).  Only male priests present the minhah—daughters of priests do not.<br><b>Taking the handful:</b>  With a minhah offering, the priest takes a handful of the offering (Lev. 2:2).  Again, only male priests perform this rite.<br>Burning [the fat]:  See Lev 3:5.<br><b>Pinching off [the neck of bird sacrifices]: </b> See Lev 1:15.<br><b>Sprinkling and receiving [the blood]:</b>  See Lev 5:9.<br><b>Except the meal-offering of a Sotah and a female nazirite, where they [themselves] wave the offering:</b>  The Sotah waves a minhah offering and the nazirite waves the leg of the animal she/he brings, a bread-offering and a wafer (see Sotah 3:1 and Nazir 6:9).   In each case the woman and the priest would jointly wave the offering. ",

Therefore it is a paradigm for all mitzvoth—any mitzvah that is a personal duty is obligatory no matter where one lives.<br>I might add that this sugya prevents a limiting of Judaism to those living in the Land, a notion that might have been catastrophic for the history of Judaism.

Yishmael is therefore lenient—he would rule that the prohibition of new produce is practiced only in the land. If R. Elazar disagrees, that means that he holds that new produce is prohibited everywhere.<br>Within the baraita, R. Akiva argues that “settlement” is not a sign that the mitzvah is observed only in the land. After all, in Leviticus 23:3, the word is used in reference to Shabbat, and Shabbat is observed everywhere.

Yishmael, whenever the Torah uses the word “entrance (ביאה)” we apply the rule that the mitzvah takes effect only after possession and settling down.

And if the Torah had not used these verses in connection with the king, I would have thought that the law to appoint a king is immediately effective since a king is needed to conquer the Land. ",

            "Introduction<br>The Talmud continues to discuss which mitzvoth apply both inside and outside the Land of Israel. The dispute here is really over how to we determine which mitzvoth are obligatory outside the Land of Israel—can a commandment connected to the ground, such as mixed kinds of seeds or fruit during its first three years of growth, be obligatory outside of Israel? ",
            "R. Shimon b. Yohai uses the prohibition of new produce, which applies both inside and outside the land, as a precedent to prove that kilayim (mixed kinds) and orlah (fruit during the first three years of a tree’s growth) are observed even outside of Israel. The prohibition of new produce is lenient in three ways: 1) It applies only to grain that grew before the omer was offered; 2) it is prohibited only to eat it. Other forms of benefit, such as selling it, are permitted; 3) once the omer sacrifice is offered on the 16th of Nissan, it becomes permitted. Nevertheless, this mitzvah is observed even outside the Land. Kilayim has none of these leniencies, and therefore it too should be observed even outside the Land. Orlah has one of these leniencies—it applies only to fruit that grows during the first three years. But it does not have either of the other leniencies, and so it too should apply outside the Land.",
            "R. Elazar son of R. Shimon says that if the Israelites were commanded to observe the mitzvah before they entered the Land, meaning that the obligation is not connected to the Land, then the mitzvah is observed both inside and outside the Land. But if the mitzvah is connected to the Land, then it is observed only within the Land. The two exceptions are release of monetary debts and the obligation to free slaves at the Jubilee year. While the latter is definitely connected to the Land, the Talmud below will question whether release of monetary debts is connected to the Land. "

            "Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section R. Elazar b. R. Shimon stated that all mitzvoth that are connected to the land are observed only in the Land with two exceptions. One of those exceptions is the commandment to release debts at the sabbatical year. But this is a personal obligation, not connected to the Land. So why state that it is an exception? It would seem to simply follow the rule.   ",
            "The reason that the R. Elazar had to state that the release from debt is observed outside of the Land is that there is some connection between this mitzvah and the land, since Rabbi connected it to the release of the land (the prohibition of working the land during the sabbatical year). Rabbi says that as long as the mitzvah of letting the land rest is observed, the mitzvah of release from debt is observed in all places. In other words, release of debt is observed outside the Land even though it is tied to the Land.",
            "The Talmud now asks indeed why we don’t read the verse another way—not with regard to time, but with regard to place. This would mean that the mitzvah to release debt applies only inside the Land.<br>The Talmud reads the verse as implying that the mitzvah does apply in all places.<br>Thus in the end, the release of debts is practiced in all places, but only if the mitzvah to release the land (not work the land) is practiced in the land. Today both of these mitzvoth are still observed, but their status is considered derabanan, of rabbinic origin.",

            "While freeing of slaves is a personal obligation, it still needs to be listed as an exception to the rule that mitzvoth tied to the Land are practiced only in the Land. First of all, the verse states “throughout the Land,” which might give the impression that it is observed only in the Land. Second, its observance outside the Land is dependent on its observance inside the Land. For both of these reasons, R. Elazar b. R. Shimon listed it as an exception to the general rule.",

Rashi explains that this means that the observance of this prohibition was dictated by the sages who lived outside the Land. R. Yohanan gives it a higher status—it is an oral tradition that goes all the way back to Moses at Sinai.",
            "Ulla argued that outside the Land, orlah is a halakhah given to Moses at Sinai, a relatively high status, whereas kilayim is only a simple rabbinic prohibition. This helps us make sense of why the rules governing orlah are stricter than those governing kilayim. Outside of Israel, a Jew may buy orlah and kilayim from a Gentile, but with regard to the former, he cannot see him gather the fruit, whereas with the latter, the only prohibition is for the Jew to gather the kilayim vegetables himself.  He can see the Gentile gather them.",

            "R. Yohanan vehemently disagrees with the scholars of Pumbedita. He instructs R. Yehudah, the founder of the school of Pumbedita, to hide the law that doubtful orlah is permitted outside of Israel, he tells him to destroy certain orlah and that doubtful orlah must be hidden. He concludes with a strong exhortation, condemning those who say that there is no prohibition of orlah outside of Israel. The line from the book of Michah about casting a “line by lot” refers to receiving an inheritance. Those who say that there is no law of orlah outside of Israel will not take part in any future inheritance of the land.",

That’s why he said “also.” Assuming that R. Elazar is the same sage as “R. Elazar the Great,” then how can he say above that there is no prohibition of orlah outside the Land?<br>To resolve the problem the Talmud now erases the word “also.” To R. Elazar only the prohibition of “new produce” is observed outside the land—not kilayim and orlah.",

            "R. Yohanan rules that the prohibition of orlah outside the Land is a halakhah to Moses at Sinai. This is a status almost akin to the status of prohibited by the Torah. But R. Zera raises a difficulty on this position. Doubtful orlah is permitted outside the Land. This would seem to mean the prohibition of certain orlah is lower than that of a “halakhah of Moses from Sinai.” R. Assi responds by including the distinction between doubtful and certain orlah into the halakhah of Moses from Sinai. In other words, when the halakhah was given to Moses, it reflected the same halakhah found in the baraita.  ",
            "In this second statement by R. Assi in the name of R. Yohanan, the sage claims that kilayim is prohibited by the Torah outside of Israel. He expresses this by referring to the punishment for the transgression—a normal way for the rabbis to express the level of a prohibition. If the prohibition is considered to be from the Torah, then it is theoretically punished by lashes.<br>This again contradicts the baraita we saw earlier, which stated that kilayim outside of Israel is only a rabbinic prohibition.<br>The answer is that there are several different types of kilayim. One is the prohibition of planting seeds in a vineyard (Deuteronomy 22:9). This prohibition is only “derabanan”",
            "Introduction<br>This is the last passage about the obligation of kilayim outside of the Land.",

            "This time they see another Jew sowing seeds in a vineyard, and again one rabbi wants to ban the man. But again, the other rabbi refuses, this time explaining that his fellow does not know that one is not liable for sowing seeds in a vineyard unless he throws down the different seeds in the same act. We should maybe detect here a note of one rabbi rebuking another for trying to punish someone without being 100 percent sure that he is deserving of the punishment.",
            "The rules of mixed seeds in a vineyard are stringent inside the Land—one may not derive any benefit from them. Therefore, outside the Land the rule is also stringent. But the rules regarding planting mixed seeds are lenient inside the Land—one may not eat the plants that grow, but one may derive benefit from them. Therefore, this rule is not observed outside the Land.",
            "R. Joseph now retracts his statement that outside of the Land one may plant mixed seeds. The basis for this retraction is the actions of Rav, a Babylonian amora, who seems to plant the garden of the rabbinic academy in rows in order to prevent the mixture of the seeds. ",
            "Abaye rejects R. Joseph’s reading of why Rav planted the garden in rows. If he had planted it in the way that gardens were to be planted in order to avoid the mixing of the seeds (four sides of a square, each with a different species and one row of another species in the middle), then we could be sure that he was doing so in order to avoid the problem of kilayim. But since this is not what Rav did, we can offer other assessments of his motivation. He might have done so either because this makes the garden look nicer or to save the attendant, the one harvesting the vegetables, the trouble of having to search for what he was looking for."

Obviously, this mishnah is expressing an ideal which often does not match reality.  The problem of good people not being rewarded, or the problem of an omnipotent God in control of a random and often cruel world is called “theodicy” and was recognized well by the rabbis.  There are many other answers in rabbinic literature to the problem of theodicy, including an extreme statement such as “there is no reward in this world.”   Our mishnah persists with what I perceive to be a very optimistic outlook.  Despite all of the evidence to the contrary the world in which we live is ordered and good.  It is a reward in which the righteous receive reward and the wicked are punished.<br>Another issue worth pointing out, is that the language used here of “merits” is a metaphor.

The idea that a 12 1/2 year old girl became totally independent of her father was probably as strange of an idea in the mishnaic period as it would be today.   ",
            "While one may use an agent to betroth a woman, it is a greater mitzvah to betroth on one’s own, without an intermediary. This is illustrated by two sages who would prepare their own food on Shabbat, even though it could have been done by others.    ",

While one who betroths a woman in that matter is betrothed (i.e. the betrothal is legally effective), the act is still prohibited. The problem with the act is that a man must see his wife before he marries her, otherwise he might see her and decide he does not want to be married to her. Seems like a reasonable request to me.

However, it is not forbidden for her to be betrothed through her agent. The (highly gendered) assumption is that a woman would prefer to be married to anyone rather than remain unmarried. Therefore there is less of a risk that she will see something unseeming in him and not want to be married. ",
            "The mishnah states that a man may marry off his daughter when she is a na’arah (has reached the age of puberty, but is not yet an adult). From here the Talmud concludes that he may not marry her off when she is minor, until she is old enough to say that she wants a certain man. While we have a tough time imagining a 12 year old girl making such a statement, it seems that in their society this was not so outlandish. ",

            "The rabbis use the verb “send her” in the verse concerning divorce to prove that one may appoint an agent. The “simple” meaning of this verse is that the man sends his wife out of his house. The first level of midrash is based on the choice of verb—“veshilah.” Since this is the same word used for an agent, the midrash takes it as a hint that a man may appoint an agent. The second level of the midrash is based on the “heh” at the end of the verb. In its literal meaning, the heh means “her” as in “he sends her.” But read another way, it could mean “she sends” which alludes to her ability to appoint an agent. Finally, the word is also used to derive the idea that an agent can appoint another agent. This final halakhah would allow for agents to pass their agency along, rather than travel long distances. ",
            "The Talmud now wants to know how we know that agency works not only in divorce, but also in betrothal. This cannot be derived directly from divorce because divorce differs in that a woman can be divorced against her will. She cannot, however, be married against her will. ",
            "The sequence of verbs in the verse about divorce is read as implying that the same means of contracting divorce can be used to contract marriage. Thus just as an agent may be used for divorce, one may be used for marriage.<br>Note that since the verse implies that marriage and divorce are to be treated the same, this is not considered deriving the rule from divorce, which we stated above cannot be done.

We might have thought that since a non-Jew can separate terumah from his own produce (i.e. the terumah is considered terumah, even though he was not obligated to do so) he can also serve as an agent for a Jew.

To be believed they must take an oath that they indeed gave the money to the creditor (the person to whom they were sent to give the money). If the creditor then takes an oath that he has not received the money, the sender will have to repay him the money. In short, do not send out agents if you do not trust them.",

Yehudah holds that only her father can receive the get. And if she is so young (or mentally incapacitated) that she cannot hold on to her get, then she cannot be divorced.    ",

Yohanan say that when it comes to divorce, either she or her father can accept the get, whereas when it comes to betrothal, since it removes her from her father’s domain, only he can accept it, not her? The issue hinges on whether the act brings her into her father’s domain (either can accept) or takes her out of her father’s domain (only the girl can accept). ",

Had he said “be betrothed” only once, we could have added up the value of all the dates. Rabbah identifies this position with R. Shimon who holds that when one takes a false oath to multiple people he is liable for each false oath only if he reiterates the word “oath.”     ",

Judah does not require him to say “oath” to each person. We can see easily that R. Judah actually disagrees with R. Shimon on this very issue. So our whole mishnah cannot be R. Judah, and if the second half is not R. Judah, the first half cannot be his opinion. ",

            "R. Shimon is the tanna who holds that separate phrases make the act separate acts. If one uses the word “oath” to each person to whom he owes an oath, and it turns out each was false, then he is liable for each oath. But if he makes one collective oath, he is only liable once.",
            "Introduction<br>The Talmud continues with interpreting the next line of the mishnah. ",

It cannot refer to the first clause where he said, “Be betrothed to me with this one, be betrothed to me with this one,” because she is not eating the dates. She could even put them down and as long as one of the dates is worth a perutah, she is betrothed. ",

            "If the first date is worth a perutah, and he keeps giving her dates, the betrothal is not complete until he gives her the last date. The rabbis view the first dates as a loan, because were he to retract his offer, she would have to give the date back. By the time she is betrothed, this date is gone and he is saying to her—if you become betrothed to me, you do not need to give me the loan back. But then this is betrothal through forgiving a loan, and this is not a valid form of kiddushin. R. Yohanan is indeed puzzled by the conundrum and offers a colorful statement to express it. ",
            "Rav and Shmuel return to saying that the last clause refers to the first clause of the mishnah, where he says “Be betrothed to me with this one, be betrothed to me with this one.” If she puts the dates down it is obvious that she is not betrothed unless one is worth a perutah because she has not yet derived any benefit from them. But if she is eating them, and deriving immediate benefit, I might have thought that even if no date is worth a perutah, she has agreed to be taken in marriage. Therefore, the mishnah teaches that this is not so. A woman never agrees to be betrothed for less than a perutah. ",
            "R. Ammi says that it can refer to the last clause of the mishnah as long as we read it as saying that the last date he gives her has to be worth a perutah. This last date is not a loan, it is the date on which she must agree to be betrothed. This date, and not the earlier dates, must be worth a perutah. ",
            "Rava derives three halakhic lessons from R. Ammi’s statement. First of all, kiddushin cannot be performed by forgiving a debt, as was stated above. Second, if one forgives a debt and at the same time gives the woman a perutah, she is thinking about the perutah and is betrothed. This is what happened in this situation. The first dates were a loan which he is now forgiving. And the last date is worth a perutah. Third, if she in the end does not want to be betrothed, she must return the money, which here refers to the first dates.    "

            "Hallah, a portion of one’s dough given to a priest, is supposed to be separated from the dough and not from flour. If one separates it as flour, it is not hallah and if he gives it to the priest, the priest must return it. We do not assume that the man knew that he should not separate dough from flour and that he gave it as a gift to the priest.  This is a difficulty on Shmuel who said that we do make such an assumption when it comes to kiddushin.",
            "Shmuel resolves the difficulty by noting that this situation could lead to a problem. The priest might have some flour of his own that he wants to knead and bake. If this flour alone is less than five quarters of a kav, it is not liable for hallah. When he adds this flour in, he will think he need not separate hallah because this extra flour already had the mandatory hallah removed. Now when he eats the bread, he will be eating tevel, produce that has not had the appropriate gifts removed.",
            "How could the priest make such a mistake—he should know that one does not separate hallah from flour? The answer is that people know that one should not separate hallah from flour, but they might err in the reasoning. They might think that its because giving the priest dough is easier for the priest. And if the priest is okay with receiving it as flour, then the hallah separation is valid. But this is not true—this separation is not valid at all.<br>So the difficulty on Shmuel is resolved—if the priest keeps this flour, a problem might occur. But no problem will occur if the woman keeps the kiddushin money.",

            "Why not say that the hallah separated from flour belongs to the priest, but the dough still has to have terumah removed from it before the dough can be eaten. This would be the like the case of one who separates terumah from a perforated pot for produce in an unperforated pot. The produce in the unperforated pot must still be tithed, but that which was set aside is terumah and belongs to the priest.    ",
            "The first answer is that when there are two pots or other type of container, the person will understand that the unperforated pot still needs terumah to be separated. The other pot cannot be used. But if we say that the priest gets to keep the hallah separated from flour, people will not think that more hallah needs to be separated from the dough before it can be eaten. This is a case of one container. ",
            "The second solution is that the hallah must be returned to the owner not because the priest will make a mistake but because the owner will. The priest will know that that which he receives is not hallah. But the owner will not know that he still has to take out hallah. Therefore, we say it is not hallah.    ",
            "This is the same resolution that we saw yesterday. The man will think that since the priest accepted it, it is a valid separation of hallah and he will not separate more hallah from his dough.",
            "Introduction<br>Today’s section continues to ask why the priest cannot keep the hallah given to him. Even though it’s not a valid separation of hallah, why must he give it back? As we will again see, in other cases, even though the separation is not valid, the priest may keep the terumah given to him. ",
            "This is essentially the same difficulty raised yesterday. The Talmud resolves it again—with two pots, the Israelite will understand that he must separate terumah again, even if we let the priest keep what he was given. But with one pot (i.e. the case of the hallah) the Israelite will think that he has separated hallah and he will eat the dough without separating again, which is considered eating tevel, untithed produce. To let him know that his dough may not be eaten until hallah is removed, the priest must return the hallah he was given.   ",
            "The Talmud cites a source that refers to “one pot” and still the priest can keep the terumah even though the Israelite must separate terumah again. This contradicts what we said before about the Israelite not listening and again separating terumah if it is a case of one pot. In such cases, we should say that what he separated is not terumah otherwise he will come to think that he need not separate again.   ",
            "In the case of separating terumah from bad produce to exempt good produce, this separation is valid terumah. The other produce can be eaten without separating more terumah, and the terumah he separated is real terumah. However, to prevent people from doing this, the rabbis made him separate terumah again. Thus in one container, even if the person does not separate terumah again, he will not be eating tevel (untithed produce).

The question is not—did the woman receive something of absolute value. The question is, does she feel that she has received something of value such that her acceptance of it shows that she is accepting kiddushin.

Elazar says that the essential act is transfer of the document to the woman, and that signees are necessary only as a backup. Since this document is valid, it may be used for kiddushin.

At the end of his work, she owes him money and he forgives the debt. This is not a valid form of kiddushin. R. Meir would say that the debt is incurred only at the end, when he actually performs the betrothal. There is no loan here, only him converting the money she now owes him into betrothal.

According to the first opinion, since the facts as he stated them are incorrect, the betrothal is ineffective. This is true even if he deceived her to her own advantage. For instance, he said that he was giving her a cup of wine and it turned out to be a cup of honey, which is more valuable than wine.  According to the first opinion, we don’t reason that a woman who would agree to be betrothed to a certain man with a cup of wine would also agree to such a betrothal if done with a cup of honey, since she could always sell the honey to buy wine.  Rather, the betrothal statement must be accurate.<br>Rabbi Shimon disagrees.  He holds that if the deception is clearly to her advantage, the betrothal is valid.  Therefore, if he says that the cup was honey and it turned out to be wine (cheaper) she is not betrothed.  But if he told her that the cup was wine and it turned out to be honey, she is betrothed. ",
            "The statement “be betrothed to me with this cup” could be read in three different ways—with both the cup and its contents, with just the cup, or with the contents. The Talmud resolves the three baraitot by saying they refer to different contents. If there is water in the cup, he means to betroth her with the cup and not its contents. If there is wine, he is betrothing her with the contents and not the cup, because she could drink the wine and give the cup back. If there is brine in the cup, then she needs the cup, so he is betrothing her with both. [Another interpretation of this last word is oil].",
            "Introduction<br>Today’s sugya begins to deal with R. Shimon’s opinion, that if he deceived her and ended up giving her something of greater value, she is betrothed. ",
            "Why not say that even if he deceives her by giving her gold when he said he was giving her silver, she is not betrothed, because maybe she would have preferred silver. After all, evidently some people prefer vinegar over wine (like when you’re making a salad, or you’re a recovering alcoholic, although I don’t think they had salads or alcoholics back then).   ",
            "Abaye completely changes the situation. The husband wanted to give her a silver denar, but his agent gave her a gold denar. The first tanna in the mishnah holds that the husband did not want to betroth her with a gold denar, so she is not betrothed. R. Shimon says that the husband did not really care what coin was used for betrothal, so she is betrothed.",

She told her agent that the man was going to betroth her with a silver denar, and he gave her a gold denar. The first tanna holds that the woman specified silver denar because that is what she was expecting. R. Shimon holds that the woman was only stating a coin and does not really care what he does betrothal with. As far as the language “it was found,” the Talmud explains that initially the coin was wrapped up in a cloth when given to her.  ",

In today’s sugya, Abaye notes that there are several tannaitic statements that could be interpreted using this rubric. ",
            "The first tanna who holds that one was merely indicating a place was R. Shimon from yesterday’s source about kiddushin.<br> The second source is about divorce documents, and it deals with the difference between plain gets, whose witnesses sign inside the document, and tied gets, whose witnesses sign on the outside of the document, after it has been tied.

Even if he says that he was a Levite and it turns out he is a priest, a more prestigious lineage, she is not betrothed. R. Shimon does not disagree in this case. From here we can conclude that he only disagrees if the deception was with money. If the deception was with lineage, i.e. he has better lineage than he stated, she is not betrothed.<br> A “natin” is a category similar to a mamzer, both of whom have very limited marital prospects.",

Having such a daughter seems to be some sort of a monetary advantage. According to Ulla and R. Ashi, R. Shimon should disagree—if he deceives her and in reality has a monetary advantage, she is betrothed. But he does not disagree. This indicates that just because R. Shimon does not express his disagreement, does not mean that he does not disagree. R. Shimon, according to Mar bar R. Ashi, would hold that if he deceives her to her advantage, she is betrothed, even in the case of  a deception involving lineage. ",

Shimon disagrees with regard to the first clause, it assumes that the same dispute can be applied to the second clause. However, when the issue is one of lineage, if he disagrees then it should have taught his disagreement. The fact that it does not implies that R. Shimon agrees that if the deception was with regard to lineage, she is not betrothed.   ",

Thus we have here the two main forms of Oral Torah—Midrash, which are laws connected to verses, and halakhot, laws taught independent of verses.

So while theoretically he could have said “I intentionally sent him to take sacred property” people do not want to say that they would intentionally commit a sin.<br>However, he could have said “I remembered” that the property was holy after I sent him to get it. Since he could have said this and thereby exempted himself for a sacrifice, but did not say this, he did not need to say “I was thinking [that it was not holy].” Nevertheless, we still do not believe him.

In such a case we can assume that the husband wanted the betrothal to be performed in that specific place.<br>However, if the husband merely tells the agent where to find the woman, the husband does not necessarily care if she is really somewhere else.

He does not want the agent to betroth her in a place where people might say bad things about him.<br>But when it comes to divorce, he would not care if people like him or not, therefore he might not care where the agent delivers the get.

Such vows would certainly disrupt the normal functioning of a marriage.  If he betroths her on the specific condition that she is not subject to any vows, and after betrothal it is found out that she is subject to vows, she is not betrothed.  Since the betrothal was made under false pretenses it is invalid and she does not need a get to remarry, nor does she receive her ketubah.  However, if he did not make such a condition, and then later finds out that she is subject to vows, the marriage is valid. Nevertheless, since she should have told him that she had vows, he may divorce her without paying her the ketubah.  In other words, the marriage was not exactly made under a false assumption and therefore she needs a get in order to remarry, but she still was dishonest with him and therefore she loses the ketubah.

            "The same rule concerning a woman subject to vows is also true with regard to a woman who has physical defects.  If he specifically stipulated that she not have any physical defects (assumedly ones that he could not detect when she was clothed), and she does, the betrothal is invalid.  If he did not make a stipulation, the betrothal is valid but he may divorce her without paying the ketubah.<br>With regard to physical defects, it is essential for us to know what physical defects are significant enough that they invalidate the betrothal or allow the husband to divorce her without paying the ketubah.  The answer is that any defect that disqualifies a priest from serving at the altar (see Lev 21:17), also disqualifies a woman.  These defects are listed in the seventh chapter of tractate Bekhorot.

After all, he clearly intended to betroth her and she clearly agreed.

            "One can dedicate not just whole grains, but even half grains. One can say “let half of each grain be the tithe.” So this is how we understand what happened in the case of the person who made double the amount tithe. He didn’t make 2/10 of the produce tithe—rather he made ½ of each grain of 2/10 of the produce tithe. The remainder of the produce is tithed, but the tithe itself is ruined because we can’t tell which half of each piece of grain is tithe.   ",
            "Abaye now cites the example of cattle tithes. The cattle tithe is performed by letting animals out of a pen, counting them, and every tenth becoming the tithe. If two come out at the same time and the owner calls both “tenth” then one is the tithe and one is not but we do not know which is which. But animals cannot be partially tithed. Yet nevertheless, although one cannot call both the tenth and the eleventh animal tithe consecutively, when one calls them both tenth at the same time, the statement takes effect. ",
            "Cattle tithe is different because an animal can be considered tithe even if one makes a mistake in counting. Just as in the mishnah cited here, animals that are not the tenth can be considered tithe, so too in Rava’s example of the tenth and eleventh coming out of the pen together, both can be considered tithes. But kiddushin cannot be done accidentally, and therefore, if the kiddushin cannot be done one after the other, they also cannot be done simultaneously. ",

If he clearly states that he only intends for forty to be sanctified, then they are sanctified, although we would not know which are sacred and which are not. If it sounds like he is trying to make all eighty sacred, then the statement definitely does not work because whatever cannot be done consecutively cannot be done simultaneously. The only issue is whether when he simply states that all 80 are being sacrificed we assume that he was taking responsibility that if some loaves were ruined, others would be sacred in its place, or whether he intended to actually dedicate eighty loaves.

This is the situation here. If the man was married to both sisters, he could not have sex with either because each is his wife’s sister.<br>The Talmud explains that Rava was explaining it according to the verse used by Rami b. Hama to explain the mishnah (see end of daf Nun). Rava said that the verse Rami b.

So too here, since the sisters do not acquire the betrothal money, neither would the non-sisters.<br>Rather, he must have said, “one of you [is betrothed to me].” The sisters are not betrothed because this is “kiddushin that cannot be followed by intercourse” since he could not have sex with either one of them.<br>This discussion continues tomorrow.

Rava has now resolved the mishnah with his opinion. Kiddushin that cannot be followed by intercourse, like marrying one of two sisters without knowing which he married, are not valid kiddushin.

Since this is a bit complicated, I am quoting my full commentary from Mishnah Yomit:<br>If he dies, both sisters become liable for yibbum or halitzah to his brothers. If he has one brother, that brother cannot have yibbum with either because it is forbidden to have relations with the sister of a woman with whom you are liable to have yibbum (z’kukah).  In other words, if he were to have yibbum with one of them, it could be that the other was the one who was really betrothed.  Therefore, he must perform halitzah for both.<br>If there are two brothers, the first brother performs halitzah for one of the women and then the second brother can have yibbum with the other sister.  The first brother should do halitzah because if he were to have yibbum he might be having relations with the sister who was not betrothed, and therefore he is having relations with the sister of his z’kukah (as in the above situation).  However, after the first brother has halitzah with one of the sisters, there can be no problem for the second brother to have yibbum with the second sister.  If she is the one who was betrothed to the dead brother, then he has yibbum with her, which is perfectly okay.  If the other woman was the one betrothed, she has already had halitzah, and her ties to the brother are severed.  Therefore, this woman is not the sister of his z’kukah.<br>If both brothers have yibbum with the two sisters, the court does not force them to separate, even though the first brother should have performed halitzah.  Although the brother who first performed yibbum may have originally had yibbum with the sister of his z’kukah, since her sister has now had yibbum, her ties to the other brother have been severed and neither brother is currently married to the sister of his z’kukah.",
            "Introduction<br>The Talmud continues to discuss betrothal that cannot be followed by intercourse. ",
            "Each husband cannot have relations with either woman because she might be the sister of the one he betrothed. So if kiddushin that cannot be followed by betrothal is not kiddushin, then why is either woman betrothed? This is a difficulty against Rava.",
            "Again, the Talmud resolves the difficulty by saying that at the point of kiddushin each man and each woman knew who was betrothing whom. The kiddushin were valid at that point. Then they were mixed up. ",
            "As with yesterday’s section, the Talmud asks why we need this mishnah. The answer is that it is there to teach the continuation of the same mishnah (Yevamot 2:7). The following is my commentary from Mishnah Yomit:<br>If Reuven and George (non-brothers) die, and each has only one brother (Shimon and Bill), Shimon must perform halitzah with both women and Bill must perform halitzah with both women.  Neither can have yibbum with either woman because each woman might be the sister of the woman with whom he is truly liable to have yibbum, the z’kukah (because we don’t know who betrothed whom).<br>If Reuven has two brothers, Shimon and Levi and George still only has Bill as a brother, Bill must have halitzah with both Rachel and Leah.  With regard to Shimon and Levi, one brother must have halitzah with both women but the other brother can have yibbum.  This rule was explained in the above mishnah quoted in the previous section.  The second brother can have yibbum with either women because if she was truly the woman who Reuven betrothed, then yibbum is proper.  If Reuven betrothed the other sister, then the sister with whom this brother now has yibbum is no longer the sister of his z’kukah, because this other sister has already received halitzah from his other brother.<br>If both brothers preemptivelymarry both sisters, they are not forced to have a divorce.  Certainly the second marriage is okay, and even the first marriage was only problematic in the beginning, before the second sister had yibbum.  Even though the woman whom he married may have once been the sister of his z’kukah, after she has had yibbum the other sister is no longer a z’kukah.<br> With regard to the last example, the Talmud emphasizes that one brother must first performe halitzah and then the other can perform yibbum. But if one brother performs yibbum first he may be marrying someone else’s yevamah, and until someone performs halitzah with her, she may not be remarried."

In such cases the object which was misappropriated loses its sacred status and the person who misappropriated the property owes the Temple the value of the object plus one-fifth and must bring a guilt offering.

However, if he unwittingly uses the sanctified property this is considered “me’ilah”—improper use of sacred property. In such cases the object which was misappropriated loses its sacred status and the person who misappropriated the property owes the Temple the value of the object plus one-fifth and must bring a guilt offering.

            "This mishnah is from Peah 7:6. The following is my explanation from Mishnah Yomit:<br>For the first three years’ of a vine’s growth, its grapes are “orlah” and cannot be eaten.  In the fourth year of its growth, they are like second tithe and must either be eaten in Jerusalem or redeemed and brought to Jerusalem where the proceeds are to be used to buy food.  Our mishnah deals with these laws and in the second half of the mishnah it deals with the impact that these laws have on some of the agricultural gifts.<br><b>Section one:</b>  According to Bet Shammai when one redeems the grapes of a fourth year vineyard, that is one takes money and transfers the holiness of the grapes onto the money and brings the money to Jerusalem, one does not need to add a fifth of the value, as one does for second tithe.  With regard to second tithe Leviticus 27:31 states, “If anyone wishes to redeem any of his tithes, he must add one-fifth to them.”  This, according to Bet Shammai, was stated only with regard to tithes and not with regard to the fourth-year vineyard.  Bet Shammai also holds that another rule concerning tithes does not apply.  Deuteronomy 14:28 states, “At the end of three years you shall bring out the full tithe of your yield of that year.” This means that at the end of three years one must get rid of all of the tithes within one’s household and give them to whomever they rightfully belong.  According to Bet Shammai one does not have to get rid of the wine made of fourth year grapes.  In short, Bet Shammai says that while there is some similarity between fourth year grapes and second tithe, they are not similar in all aspects.<br>Bet Hillel says that all of the laws of second tithe apply to fourth year grapes.  Therefore, when one redeems them he must add a fifth and they must be removed at the end of three years.<br><b>Section two:</b>  The laws of peret (fallen grapes) and defective clusters (olelot) do not apply to tithes.  Since Bet Shammai does not hold that the laws of tithes apply to the fourth year grapes, they therefore hold that the laws of peret and defective clusters do apply.  The poor people would take their peret and olelot, redeem them, and bring the money to Jerusalem, just as the owner does with his own grapes/wine.<br>Bet Hillel, on the other hand, holds that the poor do not receive the peret and the olelot because the agricultural gifts of the poor do not apply to tithes. Rather the owners take all of the grapes and bring them to the winepress, make wine and then either bring the wine to Jerusalem or redeem the wine and bring the money to Jerusalem.  ",
            "The fact that Bet Hillel does not obligate one to separate gifts for the poor from fourth year wine means that they do not hold that it is holy. Therefore, they must agree with R. Meir. Fourth year wine and second tithe are both holy. ",

            "The earlier verse only stated that the flesh may not be eaten. How do we know that one may not derive benefit from the flesh by selling it to non-Jews or feeding it to dogs, actions generally permitted when it comes to nevelah?<br>The Talmud reads this from the word “naki” which I have translated here as “clear.” The simple meaning of this word is that the owner of the ox is not guilty. But this, to the rabbis, is obvious. How could we possibly consider the owner to be guilty of murder when it was his ox that did the deed? Therefore, the rabbis read the word as “clear” from his property. He does not even retain the value of the ox carcass.   ",

We could say that the verses prohibit deriving benefit from the ox only when it is stoned and that the extra “it shall not be eaten” comes to teach that it is prohibited even to derive benefit from the ox’s flesh. The verse that says that it is stoned would not be enough to know that it is prohibited to derive benefit from it.

Therefore when the baraita says that the flesh is prohibited even if it was slaughtered in a kosher manner would hold true even if slaughtered with a stone.<br>We should note that in reality, the Torah says nothing about how slaughtering of non-sacrificial animals is supposed to be done. This is an interesting topic, but this is not the place to go into it. ",

Akiva, who seems to be his student, or at least his successor, succeeds in coming up with a derashah even for this verse.<br>We should note that we never find the word “et” being interpreted in actual tannaitic sources.

For instance, if someone’s maternal grandfather is a priest, he is not a priest because the priesthood is not inherited through his mother.  In such a case he will inherit from his grandfather, if his mother inherits from her father and then dies.  The non-priest cannot eat the terumah which he inherits, but he can sell it.  He could also use it for betrothal and then the woman can sell it.  He would have to tell her that it is terumah, because terumah is less valuable than regular food.<br><b>Tithes:</b>  These are given to the Levite, who may use them for betrothal.  An Israelite can use them for betrothal in the same way described above.<br><b>Priestly gifts:</b>  This refers to parts of non-sacred animals given to priests (see Deuteronomy 18:3).  The priest can use them as betrothal money and if they come into the hands of an Israelite, he too can use them.<br><b>The water and ash of purification:</b>  To purify someone who came into contact with a dead body, they would burn the red heifer and put its ash into water.<br>I should note that I have explained that an Israelite cannot betroth with terumot or tithes that he separates from his own produce.  Such gifts must be given for free directly to a priest or Levite.  However, it is possible to explain that the mishnah is referring to the tithes or terumot that an Israelite himself separates from his produce.  The Israelite has the benefit of being able to give such gifts to whichever priest or Levite he so desires.  This benefit is worth money—for it will make the priest or Levite look favorably upon him.  It is with this benefit that he is betrothing the woman.  She now has the benefit of giving the terumot or tithes to anyone she wishes.  While this may be a small benefit, remember, it only takes a perutah. However, as we shall see, the Talmud does not like this interpretation. ",

Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi says that it does, therefore, the thief has to pay back the entire value of what he stole because he could have given only one grain as terumah. R. Yose b. R. Yehudah holds that the person must give the real amount of terumah. Therefore, the thief pays back hullin. The right to give the terumah to whomever he wants is not considered money. ",

Of course, we can be sure that Reuven will not be happy with Shimon and Shimon has acted shamefully with his friend (sounds like a movie plot).  Nevertheless, this fact is not of legal significance.

When Shimon betroths her within thirty days, she is betrothed to Shimon, because Reuven’s betrothal has not yet begun. When the thirty days are up, Reuven’s betrothal does not “kick-in”, because she is already fully betrothed to Shimon.  The mishnah expresses the fact that she is fully betrothed to Shimon by stating that if she is an Israelite’s daughter and therefore prohibited to eat terumah, she is now fully betrothed to Shimon and if he is a priest she may eat terumah.  Were she not fully betrothed, the mishnah would not say that she can eat terumah.",

Alternatively, she may begin to be betrothed now but not fully betrothed until thirty days.  In any case, if Shimon comes along and betroths her within the thirty days, his kiddushin are also doubtfully valid.  If Reuven’s betrothal has begun, then she is betrothed to Reuven and Shimon’s act is irrelevant; but if Reuven’s betrothal has not begun, then she would be betrothed to Shimon.  Alternatively, if Reuven’s betrothal has begun but not been completed, she may be betrothed to both of them at the same time.  In such a situation she would be forbidden to both and require a get from both (see Gittin 7:3).  If she was the daughter of a priest and one of them was an Israelite, she would no longer eat terumah lest her marriage to that man was valid.  Similarly, if she is the daughter of an Israelite and one of the men was a priest she would not eat terumah lest her marriage to that man was not valid. In other words, we act stringently and she doesn’t get to eat terumah no matter what the case. Again, this is the mishnah’s way of saying that she is doubtfully married to both men and not fully married to either. ",

He is supposed to betroth a woman for his son, but then decides he’s going to betroth her for himself. The Talmud asks how Rabin could do such a thing. His excuse is that the men giving the woman away in betrothal (the brother, the father?) did not want to give her to the son, they wanted the father. And he was afraid that if he went back to his son and told him about what was happening, the girl would meanwhile be given to another.<br>Sounds like a good story to me.",

But what if no one else comes and betroths her during these thirty days?<br>Rav and Shmuel both say she is betrothed even though the money has been used up.

Papa’s statement concerning liquids that make food susceptible to impurity. Food is not susceptible to impurity until it comes into contact with a liquid. The person does not have to put this liquid on the food because the verse is read “if it be put.” However, the verse is written as if it says, “If one put.” So the susceptibility to purity depends on whether the person would want the liquid on the food. If he would, then it is susceptible to impurity. Here we can see that in the realm of impurity, thoughts count like action.",

To remedy the situation she must have halitzah (in case she is not divorced) but can’t do yibbum (in case she was divorced). This accords well with Rav. And Shmuel could say that this baraita holds like the Rabbis whereas he holds like Rabbi according to whom the divorce is valid for he holds that it is a stipulation.<br>But according to R. Yohanan who holds that these statements imply “partial” application, this statement should not work at all for there can be no “partial” divorce. There is a rule that the divorce must completely sever the ties between husband and wife. If so, she should be able to have yibbum for she is a widow not a divorcee.",

            "Abaye notes that we cannot so easily combine the effects of divorce with the effects of death. Divorce causes her to be exempt from yibbum whereas death makes her liable for yibbum. Thus we need another way for R. Yohanan to read the baraita according to which she must undergo halitzah and not yibbum. ",
            "Abaye says that in principle R. Yohanan would hold that if he says “From today and when I die” this would not be a valid get and she could have yibbum (because she would be a widow).

Again, in this case there is no real doubt to R. Yohanan that this is not a valid divorce. It is only a rabbinic prohibition that she should have halitzah and not yibbum lest people allow the woman divorced by a man who said “from today if I die” who most certainly may not have yibbum.",

Potentially, the only way for the betrothal to become invalid would be for him to die before he gives her the money. In such a case she would not be considered his widow and she would not be liable for yibbum. Therefore, this is not a particularly good way of performing betrothal, especially for the woman. ",

Judah that she is betrothed only when he gives her the money since the woman might be ashamed to ask the money. In that case, R. Huna might agree that since we’re not sure she’ll get the money, she is not betrothed until she gets it.

Tje only dispute is about whether she can give the money to the heirs.

For instance, if I want to say that I will come to your house if you give me chocolate cake (and I would), I must say, “I will come to your house if you give me chocolate cake, and I will not come to your house if you don’t give me chocolate cake.”  Otherwise the stipulation is not legally binding, and even if you give me chocolate cake, I am not legally bound to come to your house (but I would never do such a thing).<br>Rabbi Meir derives this principle from Moses’s words to the children of Gad and Reuben, as we shall explain below.",
            "The children of Gad and Reuven did not want to inherit on the west side of the Jordan river; they wished to remain on the east side, in a place good for their cattle.  Moses responded to them that if they cross to help fight in the conquering of Canaan, then they may inherit on the east side of the Jordan.  He also added that if they did not cross and fight with the rest of Israel, then they would only be able to inherit in Canaan.  From the fact that Moses “doubled” his stipulation, Rabbi Meir derives that all stipulations must be doubled.<br>  Rabbi Hanina ben Gamaliel responds that Moses had to state the second half of his statement.  Had he not done so, he might have implied that if they didn’t fight for Canaan they wouldn’t even get an inheritance in Canaan.  Since the second half is a necessary statement, we cannot learn that stipulations that don’t need a “negative” side do not need to be doubled.<br>The mishnah ends with Rabbi Hanina ben Gamaliel’s response to Rabbi Meir.  Had Rabbi Meir responded he might have said that it is obvious that the children of Gad and Reuven would inherit in the land of Canaan, since all of the tribes inherited there irregardless of their participation in the conquest.  Since the second half of his stipulation was unnecessary, we can learn that the only reason Moses added it in was because all stipulations must be thusly doubled.",

            "According to R. Meir, had the doubling of the stipulation not come to teach that all stipulations need to be doubled, the verse could have simply stated “they shall have possession among you.” The extra words “in the land of Canaan” come to teach that all stipulations need to be doubled."

            "R. Meir responds that we would not have thought that for the words “among you” imply anywhere you live. This leaves the words “in the land of Canaan” extraneous and therefore available for a midrash.   ",
            "R. Hanina b. Gamaliel uses a parable to explain his reasoning. Sometimes the extra stipulation is necessary to let the person know what happens if he does not fulfill the conditions. ",
            "The Talmud critiques the comparison. In the mishnah, the doubling is necessary to teach that if they don’t fulfill the condition, they will not receive any inheritance, neither in Canaan or in Gilad. Here, in the parable, the doubling is effective only in respect of the rest of the estate. He would have received that portion of the field in any case, whether he fulfilled the condition or not. This implies that without the doubling the tribes would have inherited in the Gilad even without the double formulation.",
            "The Talmud resolves that the mishnah and baraita are two stages of the dialogue. In the mishnah R. Hanina b. Gamaliel holds that if the double formulation was not used, the two and ½ tribes would not have received any inheritance, even in the land of Gilad. But after the response of R. Meir, R. Hanina b. Gamaliel admits that without the double formulation they would have received a portion in Gilad. The double formulation comes to teach that if they don’t fulfill the condition, they would have received a portion in Gilad, as in the parable.",

            "God when speaking to Cain uses a double formulation. This accords well with R. Meir. R. Hanina b. Gamaliel would say that without the double formulation we might have thought that if Cain does not act well he would be neither rewarded nor punished. The double formulation teaches us that if he sins, he will be punished (sin crouches at the door, always reminds me of my dog wanting to go for a walk). ",
            "When Abraham instructs his servant to bring a wife for his son, he uses a double formulation: “Thus shall you be freed from my adjuration: if, when you come to my kindred, they refuse you—only then shall you be freed from my adjuration.” This makes sense for R. Meir, but again, why, according to R. Hanina b. Gamaliel is a double formulation needed?<br>The answer is that if Abraham had only instructed the servant to take a wife for his son (v. 38) we might have thought that if she was willing to go but her family did not want to send her, he should bring her against her family’s will. Hence, Abraham had to stress that she was not to come against her family’s will. ",

But literally translated it could be read as if you will eat the sword? What!!! Rava explains that the sword here is harsh food. Coarse bread, coarse salt and onions. We should note that this is not far off from what most people probably ate most of the time. One would hope for soft bread, but people ate a lot of bread back then. "

Meir can indeed read a double formulation into the verse.<br>But now we have the opposite difficulty—if the verse is a double formulation, then it is a difficulty against R. Hanina. Again, the Talmud resolves by noting that the verse needed to teach that she is totally free if she did not sleep with another man. Otherwise, we might have thought that she is guilty of a violation since, according to rabbinic interpretation, to become a sotah she had to have been isolated with another man. ",

The question is whether the betrothal can become valid at a later point without its being performed again. ",

He could always say that he thought something was true and it turned out to be untrue and there would be no way of falsifying his claim.  ",
            "The general principle in this section and in the next is that if the betrothal is invalid now, it cannot become valid later on through an act performed now.  There are five things that prevent the betrothal from being possible at this point.<br>1)\tEither the man or woman is not Jewish.<br>2)\tEither the man or woman is a slave.<br>3)\tThe woman is married.<br>4)\tThe man is married to the woman’s sister.<br>5)\tThe woman is awaiting halitzah (release from levirate marriage).<br>In all of these cases, the betrothal cannot currently occur.

Again, the mishnah rules that his kiddushin are invalid.<br>The last section of the mishnah is an addition to the mishnah (meaning it is missing in mishnaic manuscripts).  It is clause from the Talmud that somehow crept in and it changes the meaning of the mishnah, for here we have an example where kiddushin that could not currently occur can be currently contracted.  According to this clause, as long as it is already recognized that the woman is pregnant, the betrothal is valid and if a girl is born she is betrothed to that man.  In order to make this clause match the remainder of the mishnah, the Rambam explains that he must betroth her again when she is born.",

Terumah cannot be separated from detached produce in order to exempt produce still attached to the ground. R. Assi then asks what if someone takes some detached produce and declares that the terumah he is separating will count as terumah for the attached produce when the attached produce becomes detached from the ground. R. Yohanan says that this works. Since he can detach the produce from the ground, we treat it as if it was already detached.",

After all, he has the power to do so.<br>The Talmud rejects this (you probably won’t like the answer). Slaves are not considered to have the ability to consent. They are like animals.

Oshaia did not know the answer to this, but it would seem that since he can’t marry her against her will after he divorces her, even if she consents now, the second kiddushin would not be valid.<br>The Talmud answers that maybe in this case her consent could carry over to the second kiddushin.

Such fodder will definitely ripen because it receives its water naturally. But fodder in an artificially irrigated field might not ripen if no one waters it. Therefore, it cannot be separated. R. Yosef says it does not matter. In either case, the terumah may be separated even before the produce has ripened. ",

While our sympathies will of course lie with the simple reading of the verse, rabbis did not oppose slavery (I’m not sure if anyone in the ancient world did). As such, it did not make sense to them that a slave could simply run away and thereby become free. Therefore, Rabbi limits the law to a particular type of slave. One that was bought under the condition that he be set free. But how does this happen? R. Nahman b. Yitzchak explains that the master wrote that when he buys the slave, the slave will be freed from this moment and on. Thus the slave can acquire himself even before the buyer buys him.

The other baraitot hold that the obligation is incurred only at the end of the labor, when they are worth a perutah.   ",

In the baraita, the man stated “in payment for.” Clearly the work was the betrothal money. Our mishnah teaches “on condition.” This teaches that “on condition” is an external stipulation; it is not the mechanism through which betrothal is contracted.

The assumption is that when the man said “on condition that my father consents” he really meant to say, “on condition that my father does not disapprove.”  Since after his death the father cannot disapprove, the betrothal is valid.  If the son dies, the mishnah finds a convenient way for the woman to avoid the need for yibbum (levirate marriage to her husband’s brother).  The court would instruct the father to state that he did not approve of the marriage and he would thereby annul the betrothal.  If the betrothal was annulled, the woman would not be liable for yibbum. ",

There is different reasoning for this issue than there is for the issue of allowing her to marry someone who says she was betrothed to him. It is not that we believe her more than we believe the father. The issue is that we fear she is colluding, as we learned in yesterday’s section.  ",

Hisda, the Talmud notes, follows his own opinion that fathers can be believed in some matters, but not in others. In order to be liable for a forbidden sexual act a boy must be nine years and a day and the girl three years. [I should emphasize, the boy or girl in this case is not the one liable—the one who sleeps with them is. Thus if an adult married woman has sex with a nine year old boy, she is an adulteress. If an adult male has sex with a three year old betrothed girl, he is an adulterer. The adult is punished, not the child.] The father is believed if the issue is unwitting adultery. This would cause the adult to be liable for a sacrifice. The father is not believed to have the adult punished physically. Here we can see that in certain cases there is some inconsistency. A person can be believed to have certain consequences, but not others.  ",
            "The baraita accords with R. Hisda, in that a father is believed in some matters but not in others. If the father says that the child is old enough to take a vow, or to dedicate or sanctify something to the Temple, or to say that the value of something will go to the Temple, the father is believed. The age required for a person to be able to legally dedicate something is thirteen for a boy, twelve for a girl. But a father is not believed to say that a child is this age, if the consequence will be the punishment of the child.<br>In all of these cases we can see the rabbis’ famous leniency when it comes to punishments. A witness (the father) might be believed, but the credence the court lends him only extends to non-punishment types of consequences, mostly economic consequences. There needs to be greater evidence before someone can be punished. "

            "Introduction<br>The main topic discussed in this mishnah is when a man is believed with regard to statements he makes that impact his children’s personal status.  The general rule is that a man is believed to say that he has done something which he currently has the legal ability to do.  We shall see examples of this in the mishnah. ",
            "As we have learned already, a man has the legal right to betroth his daughter before she reaches majority age.  He also has the legal right to accept a get on behalf of his married daughter as long as she has not reached majority age.  If the daughter about whom this father is testifying is now a minor, he is believed to say that he betrothed her, or that he betrothed her and then accepted her get, since he currently has the power to perform either activity.  The ramification of his being believed to state that he accepted her get, is that she will be disqualified from subsequently marrying a priest.",
            "If she is now an adult (past 12 1/2 years old), he is no longer believed if he makes these statements, since he no longer has the legal right to either accept betrothal or a get on her behalf.  We should note that this limits the power of the father over his daughter.  Once she is past a relatively young age, he has no legal right to make decisions regarding her kiddushin, nor can he make any statement which would severely impact her status.",
            "A woman who was taken captive is forbidden from subsequently marrying a priest (see Ketubot 2:5).  This is because it is assumed that her non-Jewish captors had sexual relations with her and a woman who has had intercourse with a non-Jew is forbidden from marrying a priest.  The father is not believed if he states that his daughter was taken captive, no matter how old she is when he offers such testimony.  A father does not have the legal right to give his daughter in marriage to a non-Jew and therefore he doesn’t have any special right to testify about this having happened in order to thereby prohibit her to a kohen.  Note that when she is a minor the father does have another means by which to prohibit his daughter to the priesthood; he can testify that he betrothed her and then accepted her divorce. Nevertheless, he does not have the right to testify that she was taken captive.",
            "The Talmud explains, as I explained above, that the father is believed when he has the power to marry her off, but not when he does not, when she is of majority age. Similarly, he is not believed in the last clause because he does not himself have the power to disqualify her to the priesthood, neither when she is a minor or an adult. ",
            "The Talmud argues—a father does have the power to disqualify his minor daughter by marrying her off to a halal. A halal is the son of a priest who married a woman prohibited to him. According to many rabbis, a woman who has relations with a halal can no longer marry a Kohen. In other words, a father does have the power to disqualify his daughter to the priesthood.<br>The answer is that our mishnah holds like R. Dostai, an Israelite woman “purifies” the lineage of a halal. Her child will be fit to marry a priest (although the boys are not priests themselves). She herself is also still eligible to marry a priest, should her current husband die. Thus a father does not have the power to disqualify his daughter to the priesthood. ",
            "Introduction<br>Today’s section continues to ask how we can be so sure that a father does not have the possibility of marrying his daughter off to someone who would disqualify her from subsequently marrying a priest. To recall, this was the explanation for why the father is not believed to say that she was taken captive, but was believed to say that he married his daughter off and then accepted her divorce.  ",
            "An Israelite woman who has sex with a mamzer is disqualified from marrying a priest. So the father could give her in marriage to a mamzer and thereby disqualify her from the priesthood.<br>The Talmud answers that the mishnah accords with R. Akiva who holds that marriage cannot be contracted between two people prohibited by a negative commandment such as that which prohibits a mamzer from marrying an Israelite woman. Most other tannaim hold that while it is prohibited for a mamzer to marry an Israelite, should the marriage occur, it is valid.     ",
            "Another difficulty—perhaps the father could marry off his widowed daughter to a high priest, and according to R. Simai, R. Akiva would say that in this case the marriage is valid but that she, and her child, are disqualified from marrying priests. ",
            "The Talmud resolves that our mishnah accords with R. Yeshvav, according to whom R. Akiva says that all forbidden marriages, even that of a widow to a high priest create mamzerim. Thus the father cannot marry her off to anyone prohibited to her, because such marriages are not valid.    ",
            "It is unclear whether R. Yeshvav means to say that even if a man marries a woman who is prohibited by a positive commandment, (such as the prohibition of marrying an Egyptian or Edomite for the first three generation) the child is a mamzer, then our problem is solved. But if all he meant to say is that a widow married to a high priest is a mamzer, then it is still possible for the father to disqualify his daughter by marrying her to someone prohibited by a positive commandment. Such a marriage would be valid and yet she would be disqualified from the priesthood. ",
            "R. Ashi now raises a difficulty against the whole interpretation of the mishnah—that a father is believed when he says something happened that he has the power to make happen. A father generally does have the power to betroth his daughter while a minor, but not to divorce her. Furthermore, while he has the power to betroth her, he might not have the power to betroth to a specific man. The other man can always say no, after all. Thus we need another reason why the father is believed or not believed.    ",
            "R. Ashi uses a verse to prove that a father has the right to prohibit a daughter by making a statement concerning her marriage. The words “I gave my daughter to a man” would prohibit her to everyone. After all, we would not know who married her. The word “this” frees her to be with that man (and after his death or divorce, with any other). This is all accomplished by a mere statement.<br>However, the father does not have any power to forbid his daughter to the priesthood by declaring that she was taken captive. Therefore, he is not believed.",
            "This mishnah discusses a man who offers testimony which will impact his wife’s subjectivity to the laws of yibbum.  By stating that he has sons he is exempting her from yibbum.  He is believed because if all he wanted to do was exempt her from yibbum he could divorce her.  However, he is not believed to state that he has brothers, thereby obligating her for yibbum.  Unless we know that he has brothers, he (or others) would have to bring evidence to make his wife subject to yibbum.  ",
            "The mishnah seems to accord with Rabbi. A husband is believed to make a statement that would permit his wife to remarry without having to undergo yibbum or halitzah (either I have sons or I have no brothers). But he is not permitted to prohibit her, such that she would require yibbum or halitzah (I have no sons, or I have brothers). R. Nathan says he is believed in either case.  ",
            "Rava said that R. Natan believes him in the baraita because he is retracting a statement at the time of his death. However, in other cases, such as that in the mishnah, where he simply makes a statement, R. Natan would not believe him.  ",
            "Abaye points out that Rava’s statement does not make sense. If he is believed in the case of the baraita where he contradicts his previous words, all the more so he should be believed in the case of the mishnah, where is not contradicting any previous statement.  ",
            "Abaye tries to harmonize the mishnah with the baraita by contextualizing both. The mishnah refers to a case where the husband is not presumed to have brothers or sons. He can make a statement such as “I have sons” because that will not make her liable for yibbum. But he cannot change the presumption to make her liable for yibbum by saying “I have brothers.” ",
            "The baraita refers to a situation where we thought he had brothers but not sons (making her liable for yibbum). If he is lying in order to exempt her from yibbum, we could ask why he would tell such a lie. He could, after all, just divorce her right before his death and thereby exempt her. Therefore, he is believed to exempt her from yibbum. <br>Rabbi [Judah Hanasi] would hold that when he said he has no brothers at the time of his kiddushin, he is totally believed, because why would he lie. This overrides the presumption that he had no sons, and now exempts her from yibbum. He will then not be believed later to contradict his words by saying that he does have brothers. <br>Rabbi Natan says that “why would I lie” is considered like a presumption and one presumption cannot cancel out another. So he was not believed to say he had no brothers at the time of his kiddushin. At the time of kiddushin we maintain that he has brothers and no sons and he cannot later contradict himself at the time of his death by saying either that he has no brothers or that he has sons. "

            "This section connects back to the previous mishnah as well as to the next section.  If a father states that he betrothed one of his daughters, but does not remember which one he betrothed, all of his minor daughters are in a state of possible betrothal, since he has the legal right to betroth any of them.  None of them can marry until the matter is clarified.  However, the girls who are of majority age are not doubtfully betrothed since the father has no legal right to betroth them.",
            "The father says he has given in betrothal his “eldest daughter” to a man, and he has forgotten who that man is, and the question is who his “eldest daughter” is?  Once we figure out whom the eldest daughter is that daughter will be forbidden to marry any other man, and his other daughters will be permitted.  Again, the man has two sets of daughters; one set is a group of “seniors” in that they are all older than the other set which are “juniors.”  According to Rabbi Meir, any daughter who has a younger sister may be called the “eldest daughter” since she is older than another daughter.  The only daughter who cannot possibly be called the “eldest daughter” is the youngest daughter of the youngest set.<br>Rabbi Yose rules that only the eldest daughter of the seniors is called the “eldest daughter” and therefore only she is prohibited.",
            "This section is basically the same as the previous section, except that in this section the father claims that he gave his “youngest daughter” in betrothal.  The opinions of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yose are consistent with those above.",
            "Introduction<br>Today’s section begins to explain the mishnah. ",
            "When a man says “I betrothed my daughter” without specifying which, he cannot be referring to his daughter who is a bogeret, but he can be referring to his minor daughter. But this implies that all of his minor daughters are impacted by his statement, even though, if he has more than one, this is a case of “kiddushin that cannot be followed by intercourse” because any one girl could be his wife’s sister. Thus we could learn that in such cases the kiddushin is at least doubtfully valid—each minor daughter is doubtfully betrothed. To recall, this was a major topic discussed earlier in the tractate and thus we do not want this mishnah to answer the question.<br>The Talmud answers that there was only one minor. Thus there is no doubt that she is the one who is betrothed. ",
            "The mishnah did not mean that there was more than one bogeret, such that by implication there would also be more than one minor daughter. It only meant “bogrot” in general, meaning any daughter who fits into that category. ",
            "A father cannot marry off his daughter once she is a bogeret, a girl of majority age. So this mishnah is too obvious—obviously the bogeret cannot be the girl who is betrothed.<br>To make the mishnah less obvious (and therefore not extraneous) the Talmud suggests that this was a case where the bogeret appointed her father to accept her kiddushin on her behalf. The mishnah rules that if the father does not remember which girl he betrothed, we can assume that he did not betroth the bogeret. The assumption is that since if he marries off his younger daughters, he would receive the betrothal money, he must have married off one of them and not the older daughter who appointed him as an agent. ",
            "Even if the bogeret says that the father can keep the kiddushin money, we still assume he married off the younger daughter because marrying her off is his responsibility, whereas marrying off the bogeret is not his responsibility.",
            "Introduction<br>Our sugya asks about what seems to be some repetitiveness in the mishnah. The second clause seems to be a repetition of the second clause. For ease of reference, I am copying here the entire mishnah:<br>1)\tIf one has two groups of daughters by two wives, and he declares, “I have given in betrothal my eldest daughter, but I do not know whether the eldest of the seniors or the eldest of the juniors, or the youngest of the seniors who is older than the eldest of the juniors,” all are forbidden [to marry other men], except the youngest of the juniors, the words of Rabbi Meir.<br> a)\tRabbi Yose says: they are all permitted, except the eldest of the seniors.<br> 2)\t“I have betrothed my youngest daughter, but I do not know whether the youngest of the juniors or the youngest of the seniors, or the eldest of the juniors who is younger than the youngest of the seniors,” they are all forbidden, except the eldest of the seniors, the words of Rabbi Meir.<br> a)\tRabbi Yose says: they are all permitted, except the youngest of the juniors.",
            "According to this logic, a father prefers to call his daughters “elder.” So if we had learned only the first clause, we might have thought that R. Meir disagrees with R. Yose only in this case and says that eldest could refer to any except the youngest. But if he says “youngest” we might have thought that he agrees with R. Yose and that this term can only refer to the youngest. Therefore, we need the second clause.    ",
            "If we did not have the first clause I might have thought that R. Yose disagrees only in this case. Youngest can only refer to the youngest daughter of all. But in the first case, I might have thought that he agrees with R. Meir, that “eldest” could refer to any except the very youngest.<br>Therefore, we need both disputes to let you know that they dispute in both cases. ",
            "In our mishnah R. Meir seems to say that people will make statements that cause doubts to arise. Such is the man who says “I have given in betrothal my eldest daughter, but I do not know whether the eldest of the seniors or the eldest of the juniors, or the youngest of the seniors who is older than the eldest of the juniors.” R. Yose says that there is no doubt that this statement refers to the oldest daughter. A person does not make a statement that cause a doubt to arise. Therefore we interpret his statement in accordance.<br>But in another mishnah from Nedarim the two tannaim disagree over the meaning of “Until pene’ Pesah.” R. Meir seems to be certain of this statement’s meaning—it means before Pesah begins. But R. Yose seems to think it is doubtful—maybe it means until Pesah is over in which case his vow is effective until Pesah is over.   ",
            "R. Hanina b. Avdimi solves the problem by reversing the positions in the baraita about the vows. Now R. Meir is the one who holds that a person does enter themselves into doubt. “Untile before” could mean “until it ends.” R. Yose says that a person does not enter themselves into doubt.  ",
            "Abaye limits the dispute to the case referred to in the mishnah—two groups of daughters from two wives. But if a man has only one wife (poor guy or lucky guy, guess that depends on your perspective) then “elder” and “younger” are taken literally. A middle daughter would not be called “elder” or “younger” but “middle.”",
            "If the middle one is not called “elder” or “younger” then the middle one of the second group could not be called elder. So why shouldn’t she be permitted to marry?   "
        ],
        [
            "The Talmud solves the problem by saying that the younger group of daughters consists of only two. There is no middle daughter, for had there been one, we would have had no doubt about her being called “eldest.” And this is evident by the fact that a middle daughter is not mentioned in the mishnah.  ",
            "The problem is that if there is a middle daughter in the first group, the older daughters, she too is part of the doubtful group, for she is older than the second group of daughters. But the mishnah does not teach her? So maybe the fact that a daughter does not appear in the mishnah does not matter, and there might be a middle daughter in the second group.  ",
            "The Talmud rejects the difficulty. In the first half of the statement, the youngest daughter of the first group is mentioned. Any girl older than her is part of the doubt, for all of these girls are older than those in the second set. However, when it comes to the second group, the mishnah mentions only the oldest. Had there been a doubt about any daughter younger than her, then the mishnah should have mentioned her. ",

Yose still dispute over the meaning of the father’s statement.<br>Rava responds that these are two separate disputes. This is not a general dispute (as we thought above) over whether a person enters himself into doubt. Rather it is a dispute over the particular meanings of words—does “until pene Pesah” mean until Pesah arrives or until Pesah is over. The dispute over the meaning of eldest/youngest is a separate dispute.",

However, the woman denies that this man betrothed her.  Hence she is not prohibited to his relatives.",

Here the husband claims that he betrothed a woman and she responds that he didn’t betroth her but rather he betrothed her daughter (again, one can imagine a Hollywood scenario lurking behind this mishnah!).  As above, he is prohibited to her relatives because he claims that he betrothed her.  The mother (the senior woman) is not prohibited to his relatives, because she claims that she is not betrothed to that man.  The man is not prohibited to the daughter’s relatives because he denies having betrothed her.  The daughter is also permitted to his relatives, since she didn’t claim that she was betrothed to him, but rather the mother did.  A mother does not have the legal ability to give her daughter in betrothal and hence, unlike a father who does have such a legal ability, she is not believed to say that she has done so.  ",

He can always betroth another one. So we would not believe him and therefore she is permitted to marry his relatives. But the consequences for a woman to say “I was betrothed to a certain man” are greater, for now she cannot marry anyone. Therefore, we might have believed her and said that he is prohibited to her relatives. We would assume based on her word that they indeed are betrothed. Therefore, we need to say that she too is not believed vis a vis other people.  ",

Why does it need to teach us that if the mother says the daughter was betrothed to this man, the mother is not believed vis a vis the daughter?<br>The answer is that the rabbis did give the mother the power to betroth the daughter when the father is no longer alive. So we might have thought that the mother is believed and creates a prohibition for her daughter. Therefore, the mishnah teaches that she is not.",

However, there might be consequences to one witness (I can just hear my parents say—“This is not a punishment, it’s a consequence).&lt;bר&gt;According to Abaye the witness is believed and the woman is now prohibited to her husband.

To Abaye “if you believe him” means that if the blind person believes that the messenger is trustworthy, then he must divorce her.<br>[Very interesting to read of a blind person organizing his mishnayot. There were blind sages, which might have even been advantageous for them. The Torah that they learned was all oral].   ",

This allows us to read it as if the word says “shalem” and not “shalom.” The verse can now be read as if it says that the descendants of Aaron are given the covenant only if they are “whole” meaning not blemished. If they are blemished, all of their earlier sacrifices are rendered invalid.    ",
            "Introduction<br>This section contains Abaye’s proof that one witness is believed in sexual matters.<br>The story that Abaye cites is a famous aggadah about the origins of the antagonism between the Pharisees and a Jewish king, here King Yannai. There is even a parallel to the story in Josephus (Antiquities 13.288-300) although many of the details are different. This, along with other passages, serves scholars as proof that although the rabbis did not read Josephus’s works (which were all written in Greek) there are stories that were transmitted orally and adopted by both Josephus and the rabbis. Many scholars have discussed this passage, and there is even an entire book on Josephus and the Rabbis (in Hebrew). ",
            "Alexander Yannai (or Yannaeus) was the second Hasmonean king and ruled from 103-76 B.C.E. The story begins with him returning to Jerusalem to celebrate a military victory, and acting with proper fashion in front of the sages. ",
            "The evil man, Elazar, wants to bring a conflict between Yannai and the Pharisees, who are imagined by this story to be the leaders of the Jewish people. He wants Yannai to do something with the “tzitz” the frontlet that the high priests would wear. ",
            "Elazar’s instigation has its proper effect. The sages do not think that Yannai should be high priest. There seem to be two reasons for this. First of all, one should not be priest and king. This is too much power in the hands of one individual. Second of all, if Yannai’s mother was taken captive, then she is not fit to marry a priest, nor are her children priests. While this charge could not be substantiated, the sages still depart in anger.    ",
            "Elazar now urges Yannai to crush the sages/Pharisees. Yannai is hesitant. Without the sages, what would happen to the Torah? Elazar cynically responds that we do not need the sages. The Torah is there, anyone who wants can come and learn it. ",
            "A much later amora interpolates into the story that Yannai’s response is heretical for it assumes that the Torah is limited to the Written Torah. The Oral Torah requires the sages, and if Yannai destroys them, it will be lost.   ",
            "The story’s end seems to be, at least partially, an explanation as to why we know of so few sages from an early period. After all, if the Oral Torah was given on Sinai, then we should have rabbis from a much earlier period. One explanation, the one given in our story, is that there was a break in the transmission of Oral Torah, and that all of the sages were massacred. Shimon b. Shetach restored the Torah to where it was, and thus our Torah is legitimate. But still, there was a break.  ",
            "Abaye now explains how this story is proof that one witness is believed. This seems to be puzzling—after all, according to the story there was no evidence that Yannai’s mother was taken captive.<br>Evidently all agree, there were two witnesses that said Yannai’s mother was not taken captive. So how many witnesses said that she was taken captive? If there were two, then why were the latter believed to say she was not taken captive, maybe the former should have been believed. This would at least be enough to cast a doubt on his lineage.<br> Therefore, there must have been one witness who said she was taken captive. The one witness was not believed because two contradicted him. But if two did not contradict him, then the one would have been believed.<br> Thus one witness is believed in sexual matters (this is a sexual matter, because the issue is the possibility that she was raped). ",
            "Rava says that this is not simply a case of contradicting witnesses. The second witnesses refute the very possibility of the first witnesses knowing that Yannai’s mother was taken captive. For instance they say that the first witnesses were elsewhere when they say they saw the event. This is called “hazamah” which is a special category in which the second witnesses are believed. Thus we do not need to say that there was only one witness.    ",
            "R. Yitzchak says that when the Jews saw that Yannai’s mother was going to be taken captive, they sent a female slave to take her place (reminds me of the movie Dave). Thus Yannai’s mother was not really taken captive and therefore Yannai can remain the high priest.",

The baraita refers to a reservoir (a small one it seems) that had been used as a mikveh but then turned out not to have enough water in it. Can we assume that when people or things which had been immersed in it were immersed, the mikveh was already lacking? R. Tarfon rules leniently—that which was immersed in it is assumed to be pure. R. Akiva rules stringently—everything is impure.   "

            "R. Tarfon and R. Akiva now muster other comparisons—the case of a priest who was serving in the Temple and discovered to be unfit either because his mother was not fit to marry a priest or because he has a blemish. If it was discovered that his mother was not fit because she was a divorcee or a halutzah, then his earlier service is not disqualified. But if it is discovered that he has a blemish, his earlier service is unfit.",
            "R. Akiva now argues that the case of the mikveh is more similar to the case of a priest who is discovered to have a blemish. In both cases, the disqualification can be attested to by one witness, whereas a divorce or halitzah must be attested to by two witnesses. Furthermore, the disqualification of a mikveh or that of a priest with a blemish is inherent in the mikveh or the priest. There is something physically different between a mikveh with enough water and one without enough water.<br>But when it comes to the disqualification of a priest whose mother is a divorcee is due to the mother, not the priest.<br>R. Tarfon admits the superiority of R. Akiva’s argument. What a modest guy! And that R. Akiva sure is smart!",
            "Rava now shows how he can prove that in sexual matters, two witnesses are always necessary. It is not sufficient to have one witness plus the silence of the accused. In the case of the blemish, where one witness is sufficient, it must be that the priest himself does not protest. Otherwise, one witness would not be believed. By analogy, in the case of the woman being a divorcee, there must be two witnesses, even if the priest is silent. The priest would not be disqualified if there was one witness and he was silent. This is proof for Rava.",
            "Abaye argues back that both cases deal with a situation in which the priest argues that he is not blemished. So why is the witness believed? Because the witness could tell the priest to take off his clothing and prove his point. And indeed, this is how Abaye would interpret the last clause. The unfitness of a blemished priest is provable by his own body.<br> Now when it comes to two witnesses who testify that the mother is a divorcee or halutzah, they are necessary because the priest contradicts them. But if one came, he would be believed, so long as the priest does not contradict him. Thus Abaye can maintain his opinion that one witness is believed in cases of sexual matters as long as the accused does not contradict. ",

How do we know this? Why is the different from the case of a priest who is discovered to have a blemish?<br>R. Yehudah derives this from the verse that says that the seed of a priest is valid forever, even if he was discovered to be disqualified. However, the priest will not be able to continue serving at the Temple. Henceforth, he is disqualified.   ",

            "R. Yannai cites another verse. Clearly one cannot go to a priest who is not there in “those days.” Therefore, it must refer to a priest who is no longer a priest because his line has been discovered to be non-sacred—his mother was discovered to be a divorcee.

            "Introduction<br>This mishnah begins discussing a subject which will be covered throughout the remainder of Kiddushin:  lineage.  We have already encountered throughout Seder Nashim many different genealogical statuses:  priests, Levites, Israelites, converts, mamzerim, natinim and more.  Our mishnah discusses how these lineages are transmitted from generation to generation, namely the issue of whom the child’s lineage follows, that of the father or that of the mother.  We should note that lineage was probably the most important factor in choosing a spouse in the ancient Jewish world and probably was a key factor in the entire ancient world.  Indeed until the modern period many matches between young men and women were made based on lineage.  Lineage largely determined a person’s social standing.  It is sometimes hard to relate to this value for those of us living in 20-21st century America, a country where societal standing is perhaps less based on lineage than almost any nation throughout history.<br>The final clause of our mishnah contains the famous principle of “matrilineal descent”—the “Jewishness” of the child follows the mother and not the father.  This principle is surprising since ancient Jewish society was clearly patriarchal.  Men were almost always the heads of their households, the woman would typically leave her family to enter the man’s house, men had custody and overall responsibility for their children etc.  Furthermore, it seems quite clear that the Bible operates on the principle of “patrilineal descent.”  Throughout the Tanakh men marry women of foreign descent and the women assimilate into their husband’s culture and homes (or notoriously fail to assimilate).  The same is true of Second Temple literature such as the later books of the Bible, Josephus and Philo.  How the matrilineal principle came to dominate rabbinic halakhah and literature is a mystery.  There are a few places in rabbinic literature with a hint of a patrilineal principle, but there are few of them and they are usually rejected.  A good discussion of these issues can be found in Shaye Cohen’s excellent book, The Beginnings of Jewishness.",

Therefore, the child of a mamzer or a mamzeret is a mamzer(et).  Furthermore, if the marriage is prohibited but neither parent is “flawed” (such as a mamzer or a natin), a female child from such a marriage is disqualified from subsequently marrying a priest.  For instance the daughter of a priest and divorcee cannot marry a priest.",
            "If the marriage is invalid, but the woman could be betrothed to other men, the child is a mamzer.  The example given is incest.",

            "Introduction<br>The Talmud continues to discuss the explanation of “beloved” and “hated” in the verse about a man married to two wives. The rabbis who disagree with R. Akiva and hold that kiddushin are effective with women prohibited by a negative commandment explain this verse as referring to such women. But why—why not explain the verse as referring to women prohibited by positive commandments? In other words, why do they hold like they do and not like R. Akiva? ",
            "The rabbis don’t interpret the two wives as being prohibited by positive commandments because this would not fit the verse. If both are Egyptian (a positive commandment prohibition) then both are hated. If one is Egyptian and one a Jew, then both need to be from the same nation. And if the verse refers to the prohibition of a non-virgin to a High Priest, well the verse says “man” not “priest.”",
            "R. Akiva, who reads the verse as referring either to a non-virgin married to a high priest or an Egyptian married to a Jew is forced to just read the verse in a difficult manner. Sometimes there is nothing else you can do, even if you’re R. Akiva. ",

            "When leaving to sacrifice Isaac, Abraham tells his servants “stay here with the donkey.” There really is no reason for Abraham to add in “with the donkey.” These are extraneous words so the rabbis see this as an opportunity for midrash. They play on the word “עם” and read it as “am.” Essentially, Abraham says, “Stay here, you people like a donkey.” Just as a Jew cannot marry a donkey (although some have married an ass [couldn’t help it]), so a Jew cannot marry a slave woman. The kiddushin would be invalid.<br>Yes, this is not the piece of Talmud you want to be shouting about in the streets. But it does represent the way people in the ancient world most likely thought—slaves do not have marriage or genealogical lineage in the same way that free people do.",

        [
            "The Talmud now explains how we know that kiddushin is invalid with a non-Jewish woman and that her offspring is not Jewish. First of all, the Torah says “Do not marry them.”<br>As to the second question, the verse warns that if a non-Jewish man marries a Jewish woman, the son will be turned away from God. Thus the child of a Jewish woman is called “your son” meaning an Israelite. By deduction, we can conclude that the child of a Gentile woman is not your son.<br>Note that all of these explanations are clearly “derashot”—interpretations of the verse meant to accord with known halakhah. As I said in my intro to the mishnah, in the Torah there is little doubt that genealogy goes through the father. None of these verses actually means that it goes through the mother. This is the rabbis reading their own halakhah into these verses. Indeed, later in this passage, the Talmud will basically admit that.   ",
            "Since the Jewish woman cannot have kiddushin with this man, because he is not Jewish, but she can have it with other men, if they are Jewish, this case should fit into the category of the mishnah that says the child of such a union is a mamzer. This would mean that the child of a non-Jewish man and a Jewish woman is a mamzer, and would not be allowed to marry an Israelite.<br>The Talmud rejects this—this child is not “fit” which means she cannot marry a Kohen. This is because there was a transgression in the union. But she/he is not considered a mamzer. She/he is Jewish and can marry an Israelite.",
            "Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section the Talmud used the verse “Do not marry them” as a proof for the rule that a Jew cannot have kiddushin with a non-Jew. But today’s section asks whether that is a sufficient prooftext.",

The answer is found in the next verse—kiddushin are invalid with any non-Jew because they may turn your son away. <br>[The assumption here seems to be that the problem with intermarriage is not purely genealogical. It is social/educational/religious. Intermarriage will lead to foreign worship.]  ",
            "There is a debate in the Talmud over whether one searches for the reason behind mitzvoth. According to R. Shimon, one does. The prohibition of intermarriage is lest the non-Jewish partner turn the offspring to idol worship. Thus it applies to any non-Jew, not just the seven nations.<br>But the other rabbis do not interpret the reasons of Scripture. And therefore the verse “Do not marry them” applies only to the seven nations.<br> They, instead, find another verse to derive the rule that kiddushin with non-Jews is invalid. According to rabbinic interpretation, the Torah allows one to marry a captive woman only after she has converted. From here they derive that kiddushin with her before she converts is invalid. ",
            "Introduction<br>The verse about the captive woman was sufficient to teach that kiddushin are invalid with a non-Jewish woman. But we still need a source that her children have her status—they are not Jews. ",

Why have a specific midrash when we have a general one?<br>The answer is that the verse from Exodus can be used for another midrash. A master tries to free a female slave but tells her that her future children will be his. According to R. Yose the Galilean, this does not work. Once she goes free, her kids are hers. However, the sages say the offspring belong to the master even after the mother is freed.<br>The verse quoted seems like it should explain the position of the rabbis. And in some ways perhaps it does—the children belong to the master even if the wife does not.<br> But Rava does not read it that way. He reads it as referring back to R. Yose the Galilean.

            "Rabbi Tarfon uses the rules in the previous mishnah to find a means by which a mamzer can have a child that is not a mamzer.  A mamzer is allowed to marry a slave woman, even though a non-mamzer cannot. If the mamzer owns the slave woman, then he owns the child.  If he frees the child the child loses his mamzer status and becomes a regular Israelite.<br> Rabbi Eliezer, however, holds that such a “trick” does not work. The status of the child is “slave mamzer.” When his father/master frees him, he is no longer a slave but he is still a mamzer.   ",
            "The question about R. Tarfon is—is his rule something that one can do, meaning he was giving advice, or was it a case of if a mamzer married a slave, then the mamzer can be purified? Is one allowed ab initio to have a child with a slave woman in order to purify one’s line? Or is this only a case of ex post facto—he had a child with a slave woman against the rules but now his lineage is rid of the stigma?<br>In the baraita the sages say to R. Tarfon that he has found a way to purify male mamzerim but not female mamzerim. This seems to reflect that R. Tarfon’s rule was only ex post facto, for if it were ab initio permitted to do so, he would have said that a mamzeret can also marry a male slave and when the child is freed, the child’s lineage would be non-mamzer.<br>The problem is that male slaves have no lineage. Meaning that according to halakhah, their children are not even considered theirs. Thus there is no solution for a mamzeret.    ",
            "R. Simlai seems to have advice he could give his host on how to purify the lineage of his children. This implies that R. Tarfon was giving an ab initio rule—a way for mamzerim to purify their lines intentionally. Not just a way to purify them if they did something unintentionally and against the rules.  ",
            "Even if the rule was only ex post facto, R. Simlai could have found a way to purify his host’s line. First the host would have to steal something and then be sold in order to recover the debt. Then he could marry a Canaanite slave and if his master frees the children, they would no longer be mamzerim. Yes, you do have a case here where the Talmud imagines a rabbi advising someone to steal. ",
            "The problem is that by R. Simlai’s time, there was no such thing as a Hebrew slave. That practice was not observed already by mishnaic times. So the only advice R. Simlai could have given him was to have a child with a slave woman (this is prohibited) and then free the slave. This means that R. Tarfon’s rule is ab initio. He would allow one to have a child with a slave woman in order to get rid of the stigma on his lineage.<br>And indeed the halakhah follows R. Tarfon. Thus there is actually a way for mamzerim to remove the stigma from their lineage. However, it is a drastic one, one that could not be observed in a time in which slavery has been outlawed. ",

We might have thought that in such a case the lineage follows the father’s house and the child is not a mamzer. They read the word “of his” as excluding such a person from entering the community of Israelites. He does not follow his father’s lineage.    ",
            "R. Eliezer responds that once we’ve made one exception and said that although we usually follow the father, if the mother is a mamzeret the child is also a mamzeret, so too we can make an exception about the verse concerning who is a slave. Although the child of a female slave is a slave, this does not mean that he is not also a mamzer.    ",
            "The other rabbis do not think that non-Jewish slaves can be traced after their father, just like it is impossible to determine the father of an animal.

            "Introduction<br>This mishnah introduces a concept that was very important in marital law in the mishnaic/talmudic times and continued to be a prominent factor in the choice of spouse throughout Jewish history:  genealogical class.  In Hebrew this is called:  yichus. There are some genealogical “classes” who may not marry each other (Israelites and mamzerim, priests and converts).  As I have stated before, in our modern society it is hard to grasp the importance of such categories in the ancient world.  Until recently it was believed that a person is qualitatively reflected in their class; belonging to a social/religious class is an integral part of one’s identity.  However, we should realize that in rabbinic halakhah class structure is only legally relevant to choice of marriage, and occasionally to positions of leadership.  When it comes to other elements of society, Jews seem to have mingled relatively freely.  The rabbis recognized well that a person’s integrity, wisdom and virtue did not depend upon his social class.  Nevertheless, it was an important criterion in choosing a spouse.",
            "The mishnah attributes the separation of the Israelites into ten genealogical classes to the return to Zion from the Babylonian exile in the time of Ezra and Nehemiah.  It is clear from the book of Ezra that genealogical lineage was an important issue to the authors of the book and to the leaders of that time period.  Ezra demands that the men send away their foreign born wives.  In the lists of returning exiles lineages are listed and there are verses which show that priests who couldn’t demonstrate their lineage were denied their priestly rights.  In other words, although this mishnah may contain what is basically a legend, in may be based on some historical recollections.<br>According to the mishnah, which is probably legend, lineage was so important to Ezra that when he gathered up the exiles and brought them back to the land of Israel, he separated them into classes.  When they returned to Israel, each person would therefore know their proper status.<br>Most of the classes mentioned in this mishnah should be familiar by now.  Natinim are descendants of Temple slaves, and are actually mentioned in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah (see for instance Ezra 8:20 and Nehemiah 7:62).  Halalim are the children of disqualified priests.  Hushlings and foundlings will be explained in tomorrow’s mishnah.",
            "Here the mishnah lists who may marry whom.  Subsequent mishnayot will clarify some of these statements.  For now we should note that converts can marry Israelites and can marry mamzerim.  Other sages hold that converts may not marry mamzerim. There is also some debate over whether certain types of converts may even marry priests.    ",
            "A shtuki or a hushling is a kid who knows who his mother is, but doesn’t know who his father is.  The word “shtuki” comes from the word for silence.  When you ask the kid who his father is he is quiet because he doesn’t know.<br>An asufi or a foundling is a kid found in the streets who doesn’t know who his parents are.  The word “asufi” comes from the word to be gathered, because he is gathered in from the streets.<br>Abba Shaul would call the shtuki a b’duki (a checked one).  The different name reflects a different halakhic position. According to Abba Shaul the child’s mother is believed to testify that the father is so-and-so. This is according to Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer in Ketubot 1:8-9.",

But as someone who rides his bike quite a bit around the hills of Jerusalem, I can tell you it’s not flat either. And Jerusalem is pretty high up there, although in reality Hebron is even higher. ",

            "The mishnah uses the word Babylon to allude to what Ezra, the leader of the Jewish people in exile, did before he moved to Israel. He made the Jewish community like “sifted flour.” This is taken to mean that he sifted out the best lineages in Israel and left them to run the Babylonian Jewish community. The poorer lineages moved with him to Eretz Yisrael. According to Rashi, he had to do this because he was not leaving behind any sages in Babylonia who could help in the future determine people’s lineage.<br> While there may be some historical truth in this, at least insofar as the leaders of the Jewish community in Babylonia probably stayed behind, the idea that Babylonian lineage is better than that in Eretz Yisrael is a Babylonian claim that would bolster their leadership during a time of competition with the center in Eretz Yisrael. We shall see this theme quite frequently in this chapter. It is also one I dealt with in my newest book, Reconstructing the Talmud, volume 2.  ",

Rava reads the mishnah as saying, “he forced them to go” which means that he did sort them into proper lineage before they went. The Talmud continues this discussion. ",
            "Rav Yehudah said that the lineage of most countries is dough in comparison with Israel, meaning it is all muddled. But Israel’s lineage is more muddled than Babylonia. This works well with Abaye who said that they went up to Israel voluntarily and that Ezra did not sort their lineages out before they went up. There was no oversight as to who could marry whom. But to Rava who said that Ezra forced them to go, Ezra sorted their lineage out. So why is Israel like dough in comparison to Babylonia?<br>The answer is that while that generation knew its lineage, subsequent ones did not. ",
            "According to Abaye, after leaving for Eretz Yisrael, Moshe still had to clarify people’s lineages, as we see in the verse. But according to Rava, he should have sorted them all out from the beginning.<br>The answer is that Ezra was careful to sort out those unfit to marry into Israel. He knew who the mamzerim and netinim were. But he did not know who were priests, Levites and Israelites. He was less cautious with these groups because they can all marry each other. Therefore, he had to figure this out at a later stage. ",

The Tirshata, understood to be Nehemiah, allowed these disqualified priests to continue to eat the same food they ate while in the Diaspora. This is “sacred food eaten outside of Jerusalem,” namely terumah but not sacrifices. This proves that one is not removed from one’s presumed status without proof. Thus “presumptive status (hazakah)” is great.",
            "Introduction<br>Yesterday’s section discussed disqualified priests who could eat terumah but whose lineage was still not that of full priests. Today’s section discusses the problem that would ensue from such an arrangement. It also discusses what type of terumah they were allowed to eat. ",

But this could cause a problem if their eating terumah was evidence that they are proper priests and therefore can marry into priestly lineage and their children would be priests. So how could Ezra allow them to eat terumah?<br>The answer is that in this case, since their presumptive status was weakened and they could not eat sacrifices, everyone would know that the lineage of these priests is flawed. Thus they could eat terumah and their problematic lineage still be known.<br>[As an aside, this and many other passages, assumed that priests would marry daughters of other priests. The “lineage” referred to here would fit into that situation. However, according to halakhah, priests, Levites and Israelites can intermarry.]  ",
            "If the priests cannot ascend to the lineage of fully valid priests, then how does this source show us that “presumptive status is great”? On the contrary, it would seem that presumptive status is not so great.<br> The answer is that in Babylonia they ate terumah whose status is derabanan. Now back in Israel, they are eating terumah whose status is biblical. This is to show you how strong presumptive status is.   ",
            "Alternatively, we could correct the rule about promoting from terumah to lineage. These priests were eating only rabbinic terumah, even in the land of Israel [this would be terumah from produce not biblically liable for terumah]. And we do not promote from this type of terumah to lineage. ",
            "According to this second reading of what these priests did, the greatness of presumptive status is expressed in the fact that now back in Eretz Yisrael, where biblical terumah does exist, the rabbis still let them eat rabbinic terumah. They were not strict lest by eating rabbinic terumah they come to eat biblical terumah. In contrast, in Babylonia, there was no biblical terumah, so there would have been no reason to be strict. ",

            "The Talmud now offers a new explanation of the Tarshita’s words. He did not prohibit only sacrifices. He prohibited anything that is called “holy.” And in Leviticus 22:10 terumah is called holy. Thus, these priests could not eat biblical terumah, but they could eat rabbinic terumah. "

His response is to threaten them even more—if you don’t back off I’ll let you know even more information as to who is valid and who is not. <br>The people back off, but their stones cause a stoppage in the river.

Jews, by virtue of being born Jewish, have a special relationship with God. As problematic as this sounds to our ears, the rabbis believed that Jews are God’s chosen people and as such have special responsibilities as to how they act in the world.

In my opinion, the simple reading is that R. Helbo has a very negative, blood-related (perhaps racist, if you want), view of conversion. Converts, whose lineage is not Jewish, defile, in a sense the pure blood of Jews, and while Judaism is open to conversion, this is not something that should be celebrated.<br>However, we should note that throughout history there have been more positive takes on this statement, and some more ambivalent ones. A positive take is that converts, by their dedication to Judaism, and their choice to join, make Jews look bad, for Jews are often lax in their observance.

This is a good representation on the two views of mamzerim we will see throughout these sugyot. Is it desirable that improper marriages, poor lineages, etc. should be weeded out?
