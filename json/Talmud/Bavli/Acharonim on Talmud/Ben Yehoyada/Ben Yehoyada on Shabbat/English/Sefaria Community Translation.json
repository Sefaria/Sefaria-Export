            "<b>May my portion be among those who complete Hallel every day:</b> In the Gemara, it is explained as [meaning] the verses of praise (<i>pesukei dezimra</i>). But this is difficult. Certainly everyone is careful about saying this every day!?! So it appears to me, with the help of the Heavens, that his saying, \"those who complete Hallel,\" is about the verse, \"Let every soul praise the Lord\" (Psalms 153:6), which is the end of Hallel every day, since we say it after all the verses of praise. And this verse tells a person that for each and every breath, \"Praise the Lord in thought; and this should not move away from your heart.\" (Bereishit Rabbah 14:9). And fortunate is the one who fulfills what this verse, which is the end of the Hallel, states - that he should truly praise God, may He be blessed, in his thought for each and every breath. "
