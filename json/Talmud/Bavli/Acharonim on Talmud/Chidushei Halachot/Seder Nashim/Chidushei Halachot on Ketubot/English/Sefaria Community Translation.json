            "Tosafot on Ketubot 2a:1 says \"בתולה is not taught with a <i>hei</i>... since in that case the mishnah would have to say <i>ha-ʿeved ha-ʿivri</i> (the Hebrew slave) which is not in construct form...\" If it were in construct form it would mean 'the slave of a Hebrew,' but it is not in construct form, since it is about a slave who <b>is</b> a Hebrew. And if it was written <i>ha-ʿeved ʿivri</i> its meaning would be in construct form, so an additional <i>hei</i> has to be added to make <i>ha-ʿivri</i> so as to be understood that it is not in construct form. \"And it is not the way of...\" as was taught."
