            "<b>The reason corresponds to the bulls of the festival, etc.:</b> This requires study. For Beit Shammai certainly did not argue about [the concept,] that which we elevate in sanctity, since we learn it from a verse, like Rashi explained. And there is certainly a reason [why this is not the case] with the bulls of the festival, as we say - because they correspond to the seventy idolatrous nations, that they should gradually decrease. But it can be said (answered) that there is a reason here as well. It is according to that which the Beit Yosef and the Re'em said in the first solution: That there was also a miracle on the first night, because [the oil] was divided into eight parts from the beginning. [Hence] it comes out that the oil was gradually decreasing from one night to the next. And this is what Beit Shammai meant [with,] \"corresponding to the bulls of the festival.\" Because there is a reason [to decrease], we do not need to be concerned about that which we [otherwise] elevate in sanctity, etc. Here too, there is a reason. And it is simple to understand.",
            "<b>What is Channukah, etc.:</b> And the Ran explained, \"Meaning to say, they rested on the 25th (<i>chanu be kah</i>), etc.\" See there. But it is a little difficult - how is resting relevant here? As work is permitted on [Channukah], and they only made it a holiday for Hallel and to thank [God]. And it appears that it can be explained [as follows]: That it is called Channukah, based on the dedication of (<i>channukat</i>) the altar - as we say in the chapter [entitled] Rabbi Yishmael, that the Hasmonean dynasty stored away the stones of the altar that the idolatrous people had defiled. So they needed to build a new altar. And that is why it is called Channukah. But here, \"What is Channukah,\" only [means], for which miracle did they fix it - to light lamps on it. [This approach works] also according to the midrash, Bereishit Rabbah - that the work of [building] the tabernacle] was completed on the 25th of Kislev but they did not dedicate it until Rosh Chodesh Nissan, upon which the forefathers were born. So the Holy One, blessed be He, payed [the 25th of Kislev] back in the days of Matatyahu, etc. This is also like that which I wrote - that He payed it back to be the day of the dedication of the altar, through Matatyahu, since the idolatrous people had defiled the old altar.",
            "<b>They defiled all the oils:</b> And it was impossible to arrange pure oil for eight days, since they were impure from contact with the dead - as the Beit Yosef and the Re'em wrote in his explanations of the Semag. And see there in the Re'em, how the gentiles were rendering [the oil] impure. He also wrote there - that since they were all impure from contact with the dead, how did they light the [Temple] candelabrum, as behold [they would] render the oil impure when they light it? And he answered that they lit it with simple wooden vessels (which do not transmit impurity). To here [are his words]. But this is not sufficient. For even so, since they were all impure from contact with the dead, how did the one lighting enter the Temple when he was impure? Hence it appears that they were not all impure from being in contact with the dead. Rather is was from some [other] reason that they did not have pure oil. And it was, like the Ran wrote, that they had oil at a distance of four days, etc. See there. And with that, that which the Re'em asked - how did they light the candelabrum when impure, etc., see there - is also resolved. As now since they were not all impure from contact with the dead, they were able to make a new candelabrum. And the Re'em wrote according to his approach - that they were all impure from contact with the dead - [that] it can be said (answered) that they made a candelabrum of wood, as it is taught in the chapter [entitled] Kol HaTzlamim, \"Rabbi Yose said, 'We may not fashion a candelabrum of wood, in the manner that the Hasmonean dynasty fashioned.'\" See there. But I don't know what he fixed with this. As the candelabrum was rendered impure by touching [it] when it was made, even if it is from wood. As behold, the candelabrum had a receptacle (which makes even wood susceptible to impurity). And even Rabbi Yose only said that it was wood because the Hasmonean dynasty was poor then. But it is [still] possible to answer, according to his approach, that the wooden menorah had already been made by someone in another place, and it was not rendered impure there; and they took it with simple wooden vessels and carried it to the Temple. And it must be said that that man who already made it like the form of the candelabrum, [violated] a prohibition when he made it, even [if] it was from wood, according to Rabbi Yose - [according to whom] wood is also forbidden, from the inclusion of a verse. And be precise and you will find it simple.  "

            "<b>That day was Shabbat eve, and Hillel was washing, etc.:</b> He did all of this quickly at the time he was annoying him, so that [Hillel] would not have time then to answer him. And therefore he also passed the entrance to his house and did not enter his house - so that [Hillel] would come out to greet him - perhaps he would annoy him more with this. And also that which he said, \"Who here is Hillel, etc.,\" as if he did not recognize him, whereas he was Nassi of Israel, famous and recognized by all - it was to annoy him with these things, to consider him lowly, since he wasn't recognized.",
            "<b>Why are the heads, etc. He said to him, \"My son, a question, etc.\":</b> There is a question about this. Since this question was not about the words of the Torah, but rather words in general - even if Hillel was a humble one, he should not have answered these questions. It is as Shlomo said (Proverbs 26:4), \"Do not answer a fool in accord with his folly!\" So it appears that it can be said about this that, due to his humility, Hillel did not think that this one was simply coming to annoy him with these questions, but that he was rather hinting to him with questions that related to the words of the Torah. And with these three questions, his intention was about those three bad traits - which are a haughty spirit, an evil eye and a broad appetite - which are mentioned with the students of Bilaam (Avot 5:19). Such that what he asked, \"Why are the heads, etc.,\" was intended about the bad trait of a haughty spirit - based on that which is written at the end of the chapter [entitled] Hayashen (Sukkah 29b), \"On account of four matters, the property of homeowners is confiscated by the state treasury, etc. For a haughty spirit.\" And Rashi explains, \"It is because they lord it over and act proudly [towards] their brothers, etc.\" See there. And that which he said is [that] in Babylonia, there are heads - the wealthy - that are oval (<i>segulgalim</i>), such that the cycle (<i>she hagalgal</i>) came to them to remove their properties. Why - for which sin? And he answered him about this, by way of hinting, \"Because they do not have clever midwives\" - meaning, for the sin of not being clever; which is that a haughty spirit overcame them. For anyone who is boastful is a fool. And this bad trait exists in Babylonia, as we say in the chapter [entitled]  Zeh Borer (Sanhedrin 24a), \"Flattery and haughtiness of spirit descended to Babylonia.\" And that is what brought their heads to be (<i>segulgalim</i>), such that their properties were removed from them, like that which is in the chapter [entitled] Hayashen. Then he said, \"Why are the eyes of the residents of Tadmor, etc.\" Hillel thought that his intention was about the second bad trait of an evil eye - according to that which is written in the chapter [entitled] Chelek, \"The generation of the flood became haughty only due to the eyeball, etc.\" And that is as Rashi explains [there], \"Since they would raise their eyes and follow their eyes to adultery.\" To here are his [words]. And in several places, it referred to sexual immorality by the name, eye; and it is like it is written about Shimshon (Sotah 1:8), \"he went after his eyes.\" And this is what he was saying - that in Tarmod, the people were bad with this trait, meaning with <i>terutot</i> eyes, meaning they are bad, like the explanation of Rashi. Or also (another explanation): It is like Rashi explained in other places - <i>terutot</i> is like round - so it is like it is said in the chapter [entitled] Chelek, \"The eyeball, etc.\" So he answered him, \"Because they live among the sands\" - based on that which it says at the end of the first chapter of Yevamot (16b:3), \"[the disqualification of] Tarmod is due to the servants of Shlomo.\" And that is [the meaning of], \"because they live among the sands (<i>cholot</i>)\": It is from the expression, <i>chol</i> (mundane), since [Tarmod] has no holiness or fences [from] sexual immorality, like there are among Israelites that are pedigreed. ",
            "<b>Why are Africans' feet, etc.:</b> Hillel thought that his intention was about the third bad trait, which is a broad appetite to amass much money. And their wide feet are because we say - according to that which is written (Deuteronomy 11:6), \"and all existing-things that were under their feet\" - that it is money which puts a person up on his feet. So he answered, \"Because they live in marshlands (<i>bitzaei mayim</i>): He hinted that it was based on their living among gentiles who love bribery  (<i>betza</i>) and money. For the Africans are from the Children of Canaan, who left the Land of Israel, as it is found at the beginning of the chapter [entitled] Chelek. And we have found that they said in [the chapter entitled] Arvei Pesachim (Pesachim 113b) that Canaan commanded his children, \"Love theft and bribery.\" And be precise and you will find it simple.",
            "<b>But I am afraid lest you get angry, etc.:</b> He gave him something about which it would be fitting to get angry; maybe he would annoy him with it: \"If it is you, may there not be many like you, etc.\" - as if he did not recognize him already. And that which he said, \"Because I lost, etc.,\" is meaning to say, that this is why I say, may there not be many like you in Israel, regarding humility. As a person should not be so greatly humble. But [Hillel]  said to him, \"Be vigilant of your spirit. etc.,\" meaning to say that you have erred in your words, to say that you lost four hundred zuz. Rather \"Hillel's [humility] is worthy of having you lose four hundred zuz and another four hundred.\" And that is the four hundred zuz that you lost, which you would have won, had you annoyed me; and also the four hundred that you lost from your pocket, for not having annoyed me. And it is easy to understand.",
            "<b>On the first day, he said to him, \"<i>Alef, bet, gimmel, dalet</i>,\" etc.:</b> For behold there is certainly a reason for the order of the letters, from <i>alef</i> to <i>tav</i> - such as regarding [their] number and for other things. And hence he said to him, \"But yesterday you did not tell me that\" the order of the letters was like this. And if so, I don't know which is the main order. So [Hillel] said to him, that since you \"perforce relied on me,\" to inform you which order is the main one, \"rely upon my words regarding the Oral [Torah] as well, etc.\" And it is easy to understand.",
            "<b>On one foot, etc.:</b> It appears that what he intended  was also according to Hillel's answer, meaning that he should teach him how the whole Torah could have one foot and foundation. And it said that Shammai \"pushed him away with the builder’s cubit,\" whereas earlier it only said that he scolded him with reprimand. And that is because here he is hinting to him that just like it is impossible for a building to stand on one foundation, so too is the Torah too broad in its commandments; and it is impossible to give it [only] one foundation. And likewise did he hint to him below with the builder’s cubit - concerning, \"on condition that you install me as High Priest\" - that the Torah does not stand only on the foundation of the priesthood. And it says that Hillel taught him, \"That which is hateful to you [...] etc.\" And it should be investigated - granted he said it to him in the [Aramaic] language, since that was their language then in Jerusalem -  why did he regardless change [it from the Biblical formulation] to say it with a negative expression, \"That which is hateful, etc.\" As he should have said the [Aramaic] for the expression in Scripture, \"<i>Outerachem lechavrach kevatach</i> (and you shall love your fellow as yourself), like the  Targum Onkelos. And it can be said (answered) that he understood the verse to only be speaking about something in this fashion, with a negative commandment. As it is written about, \"You shall not take revenge or bear a grudge\"; so \"and you shall love your fellow, etc.\" is referring to it - that you should not do him any evil from all that which is hateful to you. However, \"and you shall love your fellow as yourself,\" is not talking about doing him good. It is like we say (Bava Metzia 62a), \"Your life comes before the life of your fellow.\" And the words of Targum Onkelos also show this, see there. And it is easy to understand.",
            "<b>With regard to whom is the verse speaking, etc.:</b> But Hillel could not have said this from the beginning, since he would not have accepted upon himself to convert. However it is [still] somewhat difficult - behold we do not accept converts [whose motivation is] for the sake of the table of kings or for marriage! And this one is no better, since he converted himself for the sake of the priesthood, so that he would wear glorious clothes! So it must be said (the answer is) that, that which it said, \"He came before Hillel, he converted him,\" is not precise. Rather he did not convert him until after this, when [the convert] knew that a convert is forbidden for the priesthood. And earlier, it was not saying that he [actually] converted him, but rather that he accepted upon himself to convert. And 'from not for its [own] sake, comes for its sake.' And it should not be asked - if so, how did he teach him Torah before he converted? Behold we say in the chapter [entitled] Arba Mitot, that an idolater who studies Torah is liable for death! As it can be said (answered) that here, since he came to convert, it is permissible to study Torah. ",
            "<b>Am I at all worthy to be High Priest, etc.:</b> This means to say that you should have pushed me away with that at the beginning, so that I would not convert; and not with anger and the builder’s cubit"

So we need to say that Rabbi Yehudah certainly also concedes [this], as it is written in the discussion there; since the Holy One, blessed be He, answers them, \"What you made, you made for our own need, etc.\" - as it is found there, and like Rabbi Shimon says here. For Rabbi Yehudah did not say that they established marketplaces, etc. only for the sake of Israel, etc. - as it is written there, that this is what the nations of the world will say in the future. Rather Rabbi Yehudah concealed his words, out of fear from the government. So he [only] said, \"How pleasant, etc. they established marketplaces, etc.\" However we can find well to say that [he agreed] that they made them for their own need, like the answer of the Holy One, blessed be He, from there.

But it appears more likely to explain [it] according to that which is said in the chapter [entitled] Lulav VeAravah (Sukkah 45b) - that Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai said, \"I have seen the spiritually prominent, and they are few. And if they are two, I and my son, etc.\" And it concludes there that it is [referring to] those who may enter without permission, see there.",
            "<b>One is corresponding to, \"Remember [the Shabbat],\" and one is corresponding to, \"Observe [the Shabbat],\" etc.:</b> As even though, \"Remember\" and \"Observe\" were said in one statement (simultaneously) - as we say in the chapter [entitled] Shevuot Shtayim (Shevuot 20b) - they are nevertheless two words: \"Remember\" is a positive [commandment] and \"Observe\" is a negative [commandment], as is explained in the words of the Ramban. And we have already written at length about this in the chapter [entitled] Shevuot Shtayim, see there. And from this reason of one corresponding to \"Remember\" and one corresponding to \"Observe,\" it is also customary to [use] two candles for the candle of Shabbat. And just like we merit wise sons with the candles - as it said earlier - so too are myrtles for righteous sons, since they are called myrtles.   ",

As it is from them that there can be deficiency. See the commentary of Rashi here. But on the Pentateuch (Rashi on Genesis 33:18), he added [to this], and these are his [words]: He was whole in his body, since he was healed from his limp. And he was whole in his money, since he was not lacking anything [on account of his giving] all of the tribute [to Esav]. And he was whole in his Torah, since he did not forget his study in the house of Lavan. To here are his [words]. And that is that a miracle transpired for Yaakov in all three of these wholenesses.",
            "<b>And he encamped before (<i>vayichan et pnei</i>), etc. He established a currency for them, etc.:</b> It appears that they expounded this because it was already written, \"And Yaakov came whole to the city of Shechem,\" which implies that he came to the city; but afterwards it is written, \"and he encamped before the city,\" which implies that he had not yet come [previously]. And in Bereishit Rabbah, they expounded from this that he entered [the city] with the last rays of the sun and fixed its boundaries while it was still day, etc.; see there. But here it expounded from it that he graced the countenance (<i>chinen et hapanim</i>) of the city. For one - the currency (literally, coinage), since it is the practice to make a form and face of the city on a coin. And likewise, for one, with the marketplaces; and for one, with the bathhouses with which he graced the countenance of the city. But Rashi explained that he expounded: <i>Vayiken</i>, which is an expression of establishing (<i>tikkun</i>). To here are his [words].

And that is what is written at the giving of the Torah (Exodus 19:6), \"And you shall be for Me a kingdom of priests, etc.\" - which is the crown of the monarchy and the crown of the priesthood. But because they accorded precedence to, \"we will do,\" over \"we will hear - that is that they accepted the two sections of the Torah: The first is the positive commandments of the Torah, which is \"we will do\"; and the second is the negative commandments of the Torah, which is \"we will hear, and they accorded precedence to the positive commandments before the hearing of the negative commandments - they also merited these two crowns, meaning that of the monarchy and that of the priesthood. And each angel of the 600,000 carried two crowns, one in his right hand corresponding to the priesthood, which is the trait of kindness; and another one in his left hand, being the crown of the monarchy representing the trait of [strict] justice. And in this pattern - corresponding to \"we will do,\" which are the positive commandments, is the representation of the trait of mercy; and \"we will hear,\" which are the negative commandments, is the representation of the trait of [strict] justice. And it said [that] when they sinned with the calf and transgressed the positive commandment of, \"I am\" (Exodus 20:2), and the negative commandment of \"You shall not have\" (Exodus 20:3) - which they heard from the mouth of Omnipotent, as we say in Tractate Makkot - 1,200,000 angels of destruction descended and removed from them the two crowns, which were of the monarchy and of the priesthood, which were given in the merit that they said, \"we will do and we will hear,\" which are the positive commandments and the negative commandments; as the angel of death then had dominion over them, as we say in the first chapter of Tractate Avodah Zarah, from that which it is written (Psalms 82:7), \"But you shall die like a man.\" And that which they removed them is when Israel was exiled for the sin of the calf, as it is written (Exodus 32:34), \"but on the day when I take account, etc.\" And we say in the chapter [entitled] Chelek, that it was in the time of the destruction [of the Temple], as it is stated (Ezekiel 9:1), \"Approach, you men in charge of the city, etc.\" And then the monarchy and the priesthood was cut off from them. As it is written (in a poem of R. Shlomo Ibn Gabirol), \"Two olive trees have been cut\"; and it is written (Ezekiel 21:31), \"Remove the turban and lift off the crown\" - which are the monarchy and the priesthood, as is explained in the first chapter of Gittin. And it brings it from its being written (Exodus 33:6), \"And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from Mount Horeb\" - which is the time of the Temple, since the Mountain of God is called Horeb. And Rabbi Chama explains it; that \"at Horeb they put [them] on and at Horeb they removed [them], etc.\" But Horeb is only explicit concerning the removal, as it is written, \"And they stripped themselves, etc. from Mount Horeb,\" with this intention - that the removal of the two crowns, which are that of the priesthood and that of the monarchy, would be at Horeb, meaning at the time of the destruction. For, \"but on the day when I take account, etc.\" was fulfilled then - as I wrote earlier. And He doubled the angels of destruction - 1,200,000 - because the Jews had the monarchy and the priesthood removed in the destructions of both [Temples], 600,00o in each destruction. And he said, \"And Moses merited all of them\" - meaning to say that these two crowns, which are that of the monarchy and of the priesthood, are certainly dependent upon the crown of Torah. For you do not have anyone greater than Moshe in Torah, which is called by his name. And that is why he merited monarchy, as he was a king; and he merited priesthood during the seven days of inauguration as is explained in Tractate Zevachim. And that which it is juxtaposed to, \"And Moses would take the tent\" (Exodus 33:7)\" - that is the 'tent of Torah.' And that is why he merited the two other crowns and they did not remove them from him. And it said [that] also once these two crowns are removed from Israel at the time of the destruction; in the future, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will return them to them, and they will not be removed from them forever, as it is stated (Isaiah 35:10), \"And the redeemed of the Lord, etc.\" That is that in the further redemption that will be through the Holy One, blessed be He - and not through an angel, as were the redemptions of this world, as it is stated about them (Isaiah 63:9), \"and the angel of His Presence delivered them\" - then the 'joy upon their heads,' meaning the two crowns, will be 'forever' and ever.",
            "<b>Who revealed to my children this secret that the ministering angels, etc.:</b> As this is a secret thing. For the angel is completely spiritual and has no other mind but to do His will, blessed by He, may He be blessed; and he is prepared as if he did [it already]. This is not the case with man: He is attached to a body and a spirit that also has the mind of the evil inclination. So he is not prepared to do the will of his Father in heaven, since the evil inclination incites him [to do] evil.  But this secret was revealed to the Jewish people at the giving of the Torah, such that they were single-minded to be prepared to do the will of their Father in heaven, as is it is written (Deuteronomy 5:26),   \"Who would give that this heart (lit., hearts) of theirs would etc.\" Meaning that their two hearts - which are their two inclinations - would have one mind, like these angels who are prepared to do [His will] before hearing [it]. And it is easy to understand. ",
            "<b>As it is written (Song of Songs 2:3), \"As an apple tree, etc.\":</b> The continuation of the verse is, \"As an apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved, etc.\" And according to the content, it is the Holy One, blessed be He, who is compared to an apple tree - as per the [Aramaic] translation (Targum) of Yonatan, and as per the explanation of Rashi there. And all mentions of, \"my beloved,\" in the Song of Songs are like this - that it refers to the Holy One, blessed be He. But it is possible according to the homiletic teaching (<i>drash</i>), that it is referring to the end of the previous verse; as it is written (Song of Songs 2:2), \"so is my companion among the maidens\" - meaning Israel among the nations. Then it would relate well to it - \"As an apple tree among the trees of the wood,\" so is Israel among the nations. And it means to say [that] it is to tell you that just as this apple tree, its fruit, etc. It is comparing the act to the fruit and the hearing to the leaves. For the act is the main thing, as it is said (Avot 1:17), \"the main thing is not the study but the act.\" And it is easy to understand. "

            "<b>The integrity of the upright, etc.:</b> See the explanation of Rashi. And it is also possible to say it is according to, 'along the path a person wishes to proceed, he is led,' and 'one who wants to be purified, he is helped.\" And that is, \"The integrity of the upright\" - who want to walk in the straight path even if it is difficult for them - \"it will guide them,\" to be assisted from the Heavens. And the opposite: \"The perverseness of the faithless\" - to walk in the way that is perverse and not straight - \"will destroy them.\" For 'one who wants to defile himself,' he is [given the opportunity]. And it is easy to understand.",
            "<b>When you perform, etc.:</b> It appears to me that a person has physical sight and cognitive sight and that these are the two eyes [mentioned here]. At the beginning, your heart was complete with one of your eyes - that is with cognitive vision - as you said, \"We will do and we will hear.\" But when you fulfill and perform [the commandments], your heart will be complete with Me with your two eyes - also with physical sight, about which the expression, performing, fully fits. And it is easy to understand.",
            "<b>Insolent is the bride, etc. As it is written, \"gave off,\" and not, \"it reeked,\" etc. And the Sages taught, \"Those who are insulted, etc.\":</b> It is explained in the chapter [entitled] HaSholeach.",
            "<b>\"The Lord gives the word,\" etc.; each and every utterance. etc. divided into seventy languages, etc.: </b> This is so as not to give to the nations of the world, an opening to complain in the future: If we had it heard it in our language, we would have accepted it. And he brings it from the verse that is written (Psalms 68:12), \"The Lord gives the word\" - meaning one utterance gives tidings to \"a great host,\" to all of the nations. And a sage of the school of Rabbi Yishmael brought it from the verse that is written (Jeremiah 23:29), \"like a hammer that shatters a rock, etc.\" See about this in the words of Tosafot in the chapter [entitled] Echad Dinei Mammonot and here; and in our novellae there. ",
            "<b>A drug of life, etc.</b> See the explanation of Rashi. And the content of, \"To those who are right-handed in,\" is that it is for [the Torah's] sake; and \"to those who are left-handed in it,\" is that it is not for its sake. And they expounded in this fashion in the chapter [entitled] Ba Lo: \"'And this is the Torah which Moshe placed, etc.' (Deuteronomy 4:44) - if he merits, it becomes a drug of life; if he does not merit, it becomes a drug of death, etc.\" And so too is it in the commentary of the Reyava there.",
            "Alternatively, \"royal things,\" etc.: As  royal thing, is an expression of dominion and the crown of the monarchy; and royal things is in the plural. The minimum plurality is two. So its content is that there are two crowns to every utterance, meaning is two facets, which are the revealed and the hidden. And they tied a crown to each one of these two facets, meaning two crowns [total] for the revealed and the hidden. And it is easy to understand."

            "...[The Talmud says:  One who reads hallel every day] is tantamount to one who curses and blasphemes God:​​​​​​​ Hallel (Psalms 113-118) was established for days distinguished by a miracle in order to publicize that the Holy One is capable of changing the nature of creation, as he changed nature on these [unique] days.  Consequently, one who recites Hallel daily will not be understood to be reciting Hallel in response to a miracle even on days when it is fitting to publicize the miracles of God.  Such a person as it were curses and blasphemes [God, implying ] that He does not have the power, Heaven forfend, to change the nature of creation.  [The Talmud] resolves [this problem by explaining that 'Hallel' here refers to] Pesukei deZimra/Verses of Song...which do not come to publicize His miracles.  Rather, [these passages] are expressions of praise and acclaim that one ought to make daily, as the Talmud (Berachot 32a) says, \"one ought to set in order his praise of HaMakom (God) and then pray.\"  This is easy to understand."
