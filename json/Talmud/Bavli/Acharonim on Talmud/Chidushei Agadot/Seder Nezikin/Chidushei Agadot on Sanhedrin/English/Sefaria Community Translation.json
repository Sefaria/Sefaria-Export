            "<b>Bring me up seven [men]:</b> We should be precise about this story - that which he said, \"Bring me up seven\": But why wasn't Rabban Gamliel himself from the count of seven? Also difficult is that he found eight; and how did it enter into the mind of one of them to ascend without permission? And another difficulty - since Shmuel HaKatan knew that he himself was from the count, how did he say, \"I am he who ascended without permission\" - lest he would descend and they would intercalate the year without him. [As] if so, one of them was not from the invited ones! And even if he relied upon [Rabban Gamliel's] saying to him, \"Sit, my son, sit\" - as he said to him - not all of them would be from those invited. [Yet] it is implied that even if seven of them are from the count - if the eighth one that is with them is not from the count - they cannot intercalate with him. As he said upon finding eight, \"Who is it who ascended without permission? He must descend!\" So it can be said (answered), when he commanded to bring up seven, that was [including] him. And he was [referring to] the law of seven, that we decide with seven [total]. But his messenger understood to bring up seven besides Rabban Gamliel. And that is why [Rabban Gamliel] got up early and found eight - meaning with Rabban Gamliel. But Rabban Gamliel did not know that his messenger erred and invited seven besides Rabban Gamliel. So he reasoned that one of them ascended without permission and said, \"Who is it who ascended without permission? He must descend!\" And Shmuel HaKatan said, \"I am he who ascended without permission.\" For now, even if he would descend, they could [still] intercalate the year through the others - behold all of them were invited! And it said...",
            "<b>And it was not Shmuel HaKatan, but another person, etc.:</b> It can be said, according to this, that the court would sit hierarchically, as we say in the chapter [entitled] Echad Dinei Mammonot. So the seventh one that was invited by mistake, as I wrote, was below Shmuel HaKatan. And this is [the meaning] of what it said: \"And it was not Shmuel HaKatan,\" who would be appropriate to not be from the count, \"but another person,\" who was below him, so it was he who would be appropriate to not be from those invited. \"But he did this, due to the embarrassment\" of that man whose mind was lower than he and would have been embarrassed that he ascended by mistake because of Rabban Gamliel's messenger. And it is easy to understand.",
            "<b>You are the one who disturbed father, etc.:</b> Rashi explained: As you ate the garlic, etc. To here are his words. But it is difficult: Since they all left behind Rabbi Chiyya - hence they knew that Rabbi Chiyya did not leave because he ate the garlic, but in order that the one who ate it not be embarrassed, and that is why they also left. And if so, it does not appear that Rabbi Shimon did not know and did not understand this. As why [else] would they have all left? But it appears that it can be explained that they certainly all knew that he was not the eater - and so did Rabbi Shimon - and that is why they all left. And this is what he meant - are you the one who disturbed father with your leaving the study hall [such that] they all left behind you? So you disturbed father with regard to the cessation of Torah [study] at that time. For you should not have left; rather just the one who ate it should have left by himself. So he said to him, \"There should not be such in Israel.\" For the cessation of Torah is certainly a sin and an iniquity, but embarrassing an Israelite - there should not be such a great sin in Israel. So it is better to cease Torah than to embarrass an Israelite. And it is easy to understand.",
            "<b>And from where did Rabbi Chiyya learn it? From Rabbi Meir, etc. [until] he learned it from Yehoshua, etc.:</b> Maharshal, may his memory be blessed, wrote: It is a wonder! Is it not that the reason, \"in order not to embarrass,\" is not relevant here? Everyone also asks why it doesn't say from the beginning, they learned from Yehoshua, etc.; and what is the need to have it depend one upon the other [in succession]? And it appears, etc. To here are his [words]; see there at length. And I would add to the question. As who forced them at all to say that each one learned from the other story before him? Behold, it can be said that each one did this according to his own logic - in order not to embarrass someone like the one who ate the garlic in the story of Rabbi Chiyya, and the one who married with intercourse in the story of Rabbi Meir and so too in all of those. And therefore it appears that it can be said [that] it is because it can be said from logic that it is just the opposite: We should go to the other side, that a person should not present himself to others as a sinner and as if he acted improperly [to prevent] his fellow's embarrassment. And all the more so may a person not present his fellow as a sinner and include him with others who acted improperly [to prevent] embarrassment of those who sinned. But from the words of God, may He be blessed, to Yehoshua, \"Israel has sinned\" - [or] from Moshe -  Shekhaniah ben Yechiel learned [that] since God, may He be blessed, did not concern Himself about presenting others as sinners, even when they were not sinners, because of talebearing;  Shekhaniah learned from Him that a person should present himself as a sinner [to prevent] his fellow's embarrassment. And that is why it made each one learning it dependent upon a story of the generation before him, and not from a story of the generation before the one before him. For example, Shmuel HaKatan learned it from Shekhaniah: As if Shekhaniah had gone to the other side, not to present himself as a sinner [to prevent] his fellow's embarrassment and not learn it from the words of God, may He be blessed, who presented others as sinners - meaning because of talebearing - certainly Shmuel HaKatan would have done like Shekhaniah and gone to the other side. And likewise, Rabbi Meir: If Shmuel HaKatan had not done like Shekhaniah and had gone to the other side from logic, Rabbi Meir would have also done like Shmuel HaKatan, since he was the generation before him, and not like Shekhaniah who was before the one before him. And likewise Rabbi Chiyya - if Rabbi Meir had gone to the other side from logic, Rabbi Chiyya would have certainly also done like him, and not like Shmuel HaKatan; as that was a story from one before the one before him. And be precise and you will find it simple.",
            "<b>\"Israel has sinned.\" He said before Him, \"Master of the Universe, who sinned?\" He said to him, \"And am I an informer, etc.\":</b> It is explained in the chapter [entitled] Nigmar HaDin (Sanhedrin 44a), see there.",
            "And if you wish, say it was from Moshe, as it is written, \"And the Lord said to Moses, 'How long do you refuse'\": This is is explained in the chapter [entitled] HaChovel (Bava Kamma 92a), see there. "

            "<b>Woe to you, my two forearms, as they are, etc.:</b> He compared the thing to his forearms, since the word, forearm, is said every place about potential strength - as in, \"and makes flesh his forearm\" (Jeremiah 17:5); \"Your forearm is with strength\" (Psalms 89:14). And he said that his two forearms are like two Torah scrolls that are being rolled up - meaning to say, that he had the potential strength to teach Torah to others. But it did not become actualized to teach them; like a Torah scroll that is rolled up, that has the potential from which to learn Torah, but they have not learned from it. For they left it rolled up. And be precise and you will find it simple.",
            "<b>Like a dog lapping from the sea, etc.:</b> He said this metaphor about himself even though it is a bit of a disgrace. As he compared himself to a dog that is lapping. But about his students, he did not say this metaphor which is a bit of a disgrace, but rather said a different metaphor about them - like a brush in a tube. It is also for this very reason that he exaggerated about himself, that he did not take away from them even like a dog lapping, etc.; but with his students, he did not exaggerate so much about the thing. So he said, \"They have only taken away from me like a brush, etc.\" - which implies that they have taken from me like this amount, which is not so much of a disgrace for his students as [he said] for himself. But according to the commentary of Rashi, it appears that [his] version has the opposite. As he teaches, \"only like a dog that is lapping, etc. even like a brush in a tube.\" But the thing of the change of language requires explanation. And be precise and you will find it simple.",

[So] when he gives them to others, who are not money changers, he will certainly lose from [their value]. So too is this thing\" As Rabbi Akiva certainly has Torah, but he said that he does not know and recognize it, as fully needed, regarding the questions and the uncertainties that he had. \"But I do not have a money changer to sort them,\" and to answer his uncertainties as is fully needed. And be precise and you will find it simple."

            "\"Every person who possesses understanding will ultimately become rich etc.\" This seems challenging, for it is said, \"[N]or yet bread to the wise,\"(Ecclesiastes 9:11) etc. This can be resolved according to what is said in the second chapter of Niddah: 'What should a person do to become wealthy?' It is said to him, 'Increase in commerce, etc.' He said, 'Many have done so and it was not beneficial. Rather, he should seek mercy from the One who possesses the wealth.' This is the meaning of 'whoever has understanding will ultimately become wealthy.' At first, he increases in commerce, and ultimately, when he sees through his intellect and understanding that this was not beneficial, he decides to seek mercy from the One who possesses the wealth. This is the opposite of 'whoever does not possess understanding will ultimately become impoverished,' etc. Because he increases in commerce and it does not benefit him, and since he lacks understanding, he does not seek mercy, and ultimately becomes poor. He is exiled even from his place as he needs to sell it due to his hardship.\""
