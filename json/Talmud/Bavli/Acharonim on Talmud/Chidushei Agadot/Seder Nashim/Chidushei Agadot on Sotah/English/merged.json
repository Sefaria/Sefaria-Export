            "We do not give the cup of blessing to anyone except someone who is good of eye - don't read \"he is blessed (יבורך )\" rather \"he should bless (יברך ) \"...Someone who blesses the host is blessed in return, as we see in the chapter of Haroeh concerning the cup of blessing that the blesser is in turn blessed, as the Torah states (concerning Abram, Gen Ch.12) and I will bless those that bless you, as Rashi Explains it there, and therefore blessing should only be given to someone who has a good (generous) eye, because the potency of  blessing is dependent upon the intention of the one who blesses.  This is the meaning of the blessing of the priests who bless the Jewish people \"with love\" - which means with a generous intention and goodwill.  (The host receives this blessing) because he gave of his food with a good will to the poor.  He doesn't give inferior bread to the poor but good bread for himself - rather he gives the poor of his own bread according to what he has."
