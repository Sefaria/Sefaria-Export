For since it is something that does not have an identifying mark, he presumably surely abandoned it and it became ownerless."

            "<b>And some say in 46 places:</b> If you would say, \"Where do we find these 46 places? Do we not find above only 3 negative commandments?\" One could say that Rabbi Eliezer counted all the places where \"stranger\" is mentioned, such as \"you were stragers\" and \"you shall love the stranger\" etc. Thus taught the RaP (R. Perez ben Elijah of Corbeil). But the RAVaD (R. Abraham ben David) wrote: \"It seems to me that every place Scripture mentions 'a stranger' or 'as a stranger' or 'as a citizen' etc. - he counts as a mention. But it appears to me that the count is only 36 and not 46, and the disagreement between these counts is due to the fact that one considers all the places where a stranger is mentioned, while the other excludes these same places in Torah where 'poor,' 'orphan,' and 'widow' are [also] mentioned.\""

'Ephrayeh' (אפרייה) is a play upon the name Ephrayim (אפרים). [This is the explanation of] Raavad.
