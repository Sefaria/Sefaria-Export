                "<b>Shema</b>: The <i>ayin</i> (the last letter in the word, shema) is large; and the <i>dalet</i> (the last letter) of <i>echad</i> is large. [Those two letters spell out,] <i>eid</i> (witness), as [the Sages,] may their memory be blessed, said. And it is possible that it is to hint that [these two letters] are the initials of modesty (<i>anavah</i>) and speech (<i>dibur</i>), meaning that if one has modesty, the evil impulse has no control over him; and also speech - one should guard one's speech that it should be about words of Torah, then he will be rescued from the evil impulse and merit to unify the Holy One, blessed be He, and His Divine Presence. And this is the hint: Return, O Israel, to (<i>ad<i>, which is also spelled, <i>ayin, dalet</i>) the Lord, your God (Hosea 14:2). So he should be careful about these two fundamentals - modesty [and] speech; and then it will be complete repentance. For the modest person makes himself into a 'chariot' for the Divine Presence, and it is as if he sacrificed all of the sacrifices, so that all of his sins are forgiven.</i></i>",
                "<b>ADDITIONS    Shema</b> [It is written] in the book, Minchat Shai: Outstanding people, and also many [others] follow the practice to write [the word], shema, at the beginning of a line, and [the word,] <i>echad</i> at the end of a line. And so is it written in Tractate Soferim, Chapter 9, and in an old model (Tikun) of a Sefer Torah. To here are his [words]. And in the Aguadah, he concludes, \"And the <i>dalet</i> must be enlarged more than all of the letters."
