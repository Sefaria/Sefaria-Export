[In this case] we worry [that she was ritually impure even before she found blood] and declare ritually impure, out of doubt, all taharot that she came into contact with from the time of her bedikah on Sunday. For it is possible that as soon as she took her hand away [from the bedikah on Sunday] she \"saw\" (i.e. there was a flow of) blood, and the walls of her uterus held the blood in place.", 
                "\"And even for many days\"...between the first check (bedikah) and the second check (bedikah), we declare all taharot she handled during days in between (the first and second bedikot) to be ritually impure. However, those [taharot that were handled before the first bedikah are] ritually pure, since she checked herself (through a bedikah) and found herself to be ritually pure."

And the reasoning of the Rabbis is explained later on in the Gemarah. It appears that a twenty four hour period can reduce [a longer amount of] time in between two bedikot.",

For example, if she performed a bedikah in the morning and found herself to be ritually pure, and she again performed and bedikah in the evening and found herself to be ritually impure - [as is mentioned] later on in the Mishnah (Niddah 11a) \"Sometimes she is required to perform a bedikah in the morning as well as at twilight...\" - we do not declare the taharot of the previous night ritually impure, since she performed a bedikah in the morning and found herself to be ritually pure. And we cannot say that there was blood present at that time (i.e. the previous night). Rather, those taharot from time time [after] the morning bedikah and onward we make ritually impure - which is the time between the two bedikot."
