Thereby, it is explained that the primordial matter was created <i>ex nihilo</i> and the matter of that first compound was called <i>tohu</i> since from its own perspective it was merely potentially [existant], not actually existant, as it says, (regarding false gods) \"for they are <i>tohu</i>, that is to say, without actual existance, rather merely imaginary. Now the form imposed on that first compound was called <i>bohu</i>, for it was \"in <i>tohu</i>\" that it was actually present. And Scripture states \"stones of <i>bohu</i> - the subject that doesn't linger with its form any calculable time, like what happened with the subject of the first form, which immediately took one the forms of interchanging elements.",

And indeed it was that the portion of it adjoining the sphere was inflamed by the sphere's motion - that is elemental fire. The portion of it close to the water acquired coldness from the water, except for a small portion thereof which was heated incidentally by a reversal of the sparks from the luminous luminaries. "

Now behold, thereby, they [the waters] necessarily ascended to some boundary in the elemental air, and the air necessarily was subject to some transformation which made a place for a portion which was converted to vapor, and it expanded to a place much great in volume than its original place."

But He made it such that that \"firmament\" that separates would have the power to stop and prevent the vaporous portion from descending - that's the \"waters which are above the firmament\", such that the transformed atmospheric portion would descend, while the vaporous would remain in its original place. Because of this, when the the moist vapor reaches it [i.e., the firmament], it condenses and gives rise to rain, snow and hail. As they condense they descend, as it is said, \"at the sound of His placing an abundance of water in the heavens\" Jeremiah 10:13. - what it wanted by saying \"heavens\": the  firmament which condenses the atmospheric part [of the waters], as it is said \"And G-d called the firmament \"heavens\" Genesis 1:8. Now when the cloudy, excited vapor arrives there [at the firmament], it generates thunder and lightning, and it is said: \"He lifts up clouds from the ends of the earth, thunder from the rain He makes\" [continuation of verse quoted previously from Jeremiah]. Now, seeing as how some of the heavier watery element is above the lighter air, which from our perspectives is against their nature - this without doubt indicates the action of an volitional actor, intended such an outcome, as it is said, \"the work of His hands shall the firmament declare\" Psalms 19:2",

Therefor it [the word] is said regarding G-d, may He be blessed, and regarding His angels, and similarly it is said regarding judges in respect to that intelligent element that is fitting for them. Indeed, seeing that even though human intelligence is acquired without any material tools, and extends over abstract notions, and over future [i.e., hypothetical situation], and  is not weakened by extensive intellectual activity, nor in old age, but rather gains strength, and all of these [features] make it clear that it is doubtlessly non-material, for indeed, the opposite of all these befall the bodily, material powers, nevertheless, before he gains wisdom [lit. - ponders], being then lacking in all the perfections awaiting him, he is <b>not</b> called g0d, rather he merely called \"in the image of G-d\" until he acquires perfections, especially that wisdom through which he acquires love and awe of G-d and, for then he will be an fully-realized intelligent entity, perfect, non-material, and then he will be necessarily eternal, and will continue to exist also after the death of the body. Now since it is the choice of man whether to acquire this perfection through his effort to ponder the wisdom mentioned previously, it will therefore become clear that when he prevents himself from this, his intellectual potential will remain merely a potentiality, lacking in all actualized perfection, like it was from the beginning, and he will amount to nothing and be lost, as it says, \"man is honored, but if he will not understand, he is compared to mere beasts\" (Psalms 49:21).
