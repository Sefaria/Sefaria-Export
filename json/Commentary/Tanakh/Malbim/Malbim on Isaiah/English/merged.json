                "Zion – The begins a new section after the prophet has finished the prophecy which he prophesized about Yehudah and Jerusalem from the beginning of the book until now. If you look carefully you will see that the rebuke which he delivered from the beginning of the book until the twenty first verse, which is the prophecy that particularly concerns Yehudah, was about acts between the people and Gd – sacrifices, repentance and prayer. Then most of the rebuke which he gives from the verse “How has she become a harlot…” (Isaiah 1:21) is dealing with matters between people like forgery, fraud and the perversion of justice. This is because sins against Gd were more common among the people of Yehudah who lived outside of Jerusalem, but in the capitol city of Jerusalem sins between people were more common because of the amount of business and trade done there. Now the seer closed his words by saying that each one  will find his reparation through the sin he himself committed, and by fixing his crookedness he will return to his place. ",

                "And her penitent through righteousness – This is referring to the tribe of Yehudah who returned to Zion from the exile, whose sin was in perverting righteousness between man and Gd. ", 
                "They will be redeemed through righteousness -- by showing the righteousness of thir actions before their Maker and Creator."

It says - you Zion the herald go up on a high mountain and you Jerusalem raise your voice with strength, don't be afraid lest the thing which you announce not come to pass, because it certainly will come. Not only this but also say to the cities of Yehudah 'here is your Gd' as if you are pointing to something which has already come and exists. (I already explained in many places that in Zion was the seat of the king, the Sanhedrin and the place of the Holy Temple, while in Jerusalem dwelt the masses. Zion announces that He has returned His Presence to Zion and the kingship and the priesthood. Therefore the prophet advised him to ascend a high mountain. Jerusalem announces the ingathering of the exiles, therefore the prophet advised her to raise her voice in strength in order that those driven away hear and be gathered from the four corners of the heavens."
