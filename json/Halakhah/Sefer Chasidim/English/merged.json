            "This work is entitled Sefer Hasidim [The Book of the Pious]. Its words are sweet and loving. The book was written for all those who fear God and meditate on his words, for a pious one whose heart holds great love for God and attempts to heed all his words, but does not know how to place this love on all things in the world, nor does he know about which things he should be careful or how actually to listen to all of God’s words. This is the case for some due to a weak heart in the service of God, because there are pious men who place many things on their heart and listen to the word of God and there are pious men who do very little. If they knew and understood the ways of the pious, then they would indeed do a great many good deeds like the pious ones who do a great many good deeds. The title of this book therefore is Sefer Hasidim, so that all those who fear God and want to return to him know and understand what they need to do in order to become close to him and what they should not do. This work was not written for evil men, for if they understood what they were doing they would see that all their deeds are indeed nothing and futile. About them Solomon in his great wisdom wrote- “Speak not in the ears of the fool, for he will scorn the intelligence of your words (Proverbs, 23-9). Solomon, who composed the book of Proverbs, did not compose it for evil men, for even if he had spoke to them directly with all his wisdom it would not have served any purpose. Rather, Solomon wrote the Book of Proverbs for the righteous people, ones who cling to the ways of God, so that they will see and understand as it is written- “For the ways of God are straight, the righteous walk in them and the sinners will stumble over them” (Hosea 14-10). We learn from this that the ways of righteousness, humility and fear are stumbling blocks to the wicked and an elevation for the righteous."

            "And so said the author of this book, the one who compiled the words of piety, humility and fear, each of them present in the book that I have contemplated and comprehended due to my mentors and teachers, because it is proper for all G-d fearing people to instruct their offsprings and students and all People of Israel as to how to fulfill the Will of our Creator, blessed be His Name and extolled be the mention of Him. And so are the teachings of His words: to describe Him using attributes relevant to those of a human of flesh and blood in order to penetrate human hearts of flesh to make it understood to the human ear, open their unseeing eyes and make their uncircumcised hearts comprehend. And so it is stated in the Torah: \"His voice is like that of multiple waters... Hashem like a lion shall roar\". And so He would appear to His creations: \"His eyes like doves...\" and the like... \"His legs like pillars of marble...\" - and all this only in order to make it understood to the human ear."

And two people already went and hid themselves in the graveyard and heard that one was calling to her friend: Let us go and pray together! All of the souls came out and prayed and asked for mercy so that death would not be decreed upon the living, and those who will die that they return from their evil ways, and that they die through minor illness, and about every matter of the living and the dead; and about themselves, to quickly remove judgement from upon them and from upon others - and they told their congregation. The next year on the eve of Hoshana Rabba, two others went and only one virgin didn't come out of the grave, who had died last week. They said: Come out! She said: I cannot, because my father was rich and lost his possessions and buried me without clothing. And they heard that some of the souls said we will not gather together because two have already revealed us to many. Rather, each one of us will pray in the grave, so that the living will not hear and tell the nation. And they became angry at the father and took clothing and clothed that virgin. And when a shroud decays it does not hold back the soul for behold despite body's decay the soul rests in the bones although it departs from dead body as is known that (sorcerers) who raise a spirit bring it by means of dust that absorbed from the dead. It happened that one man didn't see his head's shadow on Hoshana Rabbah's night, so he and his loving ones fasted numerous fasts and gave a lot to tzedakah and lived many years after that as is said \"Tzedakah saves from death\"."

So he got himself ready and went to search out and find the man. When he got close to the place of the man he asked about him, and the whole world wondered why the Hasid would want to see such a villainous man. This made the Hasid sad, but still, he went to the house of the man. When the hasid arrived, the man came out of his house incredibly angry and struck the hasid on his face, and pulled down the hasid’s pants. The man said to the hasid, “Enter if you like.” And the man and his friends mocked the hasid. The hasid payed no attention and entered the room adjacent to the bordello. That night all the prostitutes of the town entered the room next to where the hasid was and drank wine until they became intoxicated, and the man danced before them all night until they passed out. The hasid saw all of this and cried. The next day the hasid prepared to return home, but before he left he asked the man, “On your life, tell me if you have ever done good in your days, because I saw in a dream that you are sitting next to me in the Garden of Eden, yet you do all of this licentiousness. How can it be that you will sit with me? The man said to the hasid, “All that you I have done that you have seen is for the good. I only make it appear that I am licentious, I offer prostitutes a higher price to come with me, and they think I will spend the night with them when they are drunk, what’s more, I tell my mother to come in at night and pull me out by the hair, so if the prostitutes ask, ‘Why did you not sleep with us?’ I can reply, ‘You know that my mother beats me.’ And this is how I prevent licentiousness among Hebrew women."
