            "As it is required for the house of Israel to read from the scrolls, and to teach in the Torah, and to conclude with the prophets, on each day according to its subject  matter — laws of Pesaḥ on Pesaḥ, laws of Shavuot on Shavuot, laws of Sukkot on Sukkot, as it is written \"And Moses spoke the appointed-times of haShem to the children of Israel\" (Leviticus 23:44), and it is commanded to read every matter at its time and extrapolate on the subject of the day, as taught, \"Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In our manuscripts, it says \"The Rabbis taught\" here.</i> Moses ordained for Israel that they would investigate and extrapolate on the matter of the day — laws of Pesaḥ on Pesaḥ, laws of Shavuot on Shavuot, laws of Sukkot on Sukkot\" (Megillah 32a:17). On Ḥanukkah we read the princes (Numbers 7). On Purim we read \"And Amalek came\" (Exodus 17:8—16). When Rosh Ḥodesh Adar falls on Shabbat we read the portion of the sheqalim (Exodus 30:11—16). \"And Rabbi Yitzḥaq Nappaḥa said: when Rosh Ḥodesh Adar falls on Shabbat, bring three Torah scrolls, and read one for the matter of the day, and one for the new moon, and one from Ki Tissa. And Rabbi Yitzḥaq Nappaḥa said: when Rosh Ḥodesh Tevet falls on Shabbat, bring three Torah scrolls, and read one for the matter of the day, and one for Rosh Ḥodesh, and one for Ḥanukkah\" (Megillah 29b:22). On Ḥanukkah and on Purim three people read, on Rosh Ḥodesh and on Ḥol ha-Moed four people read — since there is Musaf, we add [mosifin] a person. When Rosh Ḥodesh Adar falls on Shabbat, we read the portion of the sheqalim (Exodus 30:11—16). When it falls on another day of the week, we advance the reading of the portion of the sheqalim, and interrupt the special readings. On the second<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Shabbat of the month we read</i> 'Remember' (Deuteronomy 25:17—17). On the third, the red heifer (Numbers 19:1—22). On the fourth, 'This month' (Exodus 12:1—20). If it falls on the sixth, then 'This month' is on the fifth. After that they return to the regular order. And everyone interrupts the order for Rosh Hodesh, Ḥanukah, Purim, fast days, festival days, and Yom Kippur (Mishnah Megillah 3:5). On Pesaḥ they read the portion of the festivals. And a mnemonic is: \"during the bull, sanctify with money, cut in the desert, send the firstborn.\" On Shavuot, \"On the third day\" (Exodus 19:1–20:23), and on the second day, \"Every firstborn\" (Deuteronomy 15:19—16:37). On Rosh Hashanah, \"And haShem remembered Sarah\" (Genesis 21:1–34) and on the second day, \"And God tested Abraham\" (Genesis 22:1—24). On Yom Kippur, \"after the death\" (Leviticus 16:1—34). On Sukkot, the offerings for Sukkot (Numbers 29:12—34). On Ḥanukkah, the princes (Numbers 7). On Purim, \"And Amalek came\" (Exodus 17:8—16). On Rosh Hodesh, \"And on your new months\" (Numbers 28:1–15). On the watches, the matter of creation (Genesis 1:1—2:3). On fast days, \"And Moses petitioned\" (Exodus 32:11—14, Exodus 34:1–10). On Mondays and Thursdays and on Shabbat in the afternoon they read according to the order, but they are not counted in the order. As it is said, \"And Moses spoke the appointed-times of haShem to the children of Israel\" (Leviticus 23:44)  — it's commanded that they read each and every one at its time.\n"
