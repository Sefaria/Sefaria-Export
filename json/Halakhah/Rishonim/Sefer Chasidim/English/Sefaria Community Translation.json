            "And so said the author of this book, the one who compiled the words of piety, humility and fear, each of them present in the book that I have contemplated and comprehended due to my mentors and teachers, because it is proper for all G-d fearing people to instruct their offsprings and students and all People of Israel as to how to fulfill the Will of our Creator, blessed be His Name and extolled be the mention of Him. And so are the teachings of His words: to describe Him using attributes relevant to those of a human of flesh and blood in order to penetrate human hearts of flesh to make it understood to the human ear, open their unseeing eyes and make their uncircumcised hearts comprehend. And so it is stated in the Torah: \"His voice is like that of multiple waters... Hashem like a lion shall roar\". And so He would appear to His creations: \"His eyes like doves...\" and the like... \"His legs like pillars of marble...\" - and all this only in order to make it understood to the human ear."

All of the souls came out and prayed and asked for mercy so that death would not be decreed upon the living, and those who will die that they return from their evil ways, and that they die through minor illness, and about every matter of the living and the dead; and about themselves, to quickly remove judgement from upon them and from upon others - and they told their congregation. The next year on the eve of Hoshana Rabba, two others went and only one virgin didn't come out of the grave, who had died last week. They said: Come out! She said: I cannot, because my father was rich and lost his possessions and buried me without clothing. And they heard that some of the souls said we will not gather together because two have already revealed us to many. Rather, each one of us will pray in the grave, so that the living will not hear and tell the nation. And they became angry at the father and took clothing and clothed that virgin. And when a shroud decays it does not hold back the soul for behold despite body's decay the soul rests in the bones although it departs from dead body as is known that (sorcerers) who raise a spirit bring it by means of dust that absorbed from the dead. It happened that one man didn't see his head's shadow on Hoshana Rabbah's night, so he and his loving ones fasted numerous fasts and gave a lot to tzedakah and lived many years after that as is said \"Tzedakah saves from death\"."

For it will give them grief to go without a wife. And sometimes he does not have the ability to do this; he should pray to God that He find him matches at the  right time for all of their needs and betterments. Behold our teacher Moshe married a convert, when he saw that he could not go back to Egypt. And why were Peretz and Zerach born to Yehudah by way of a sin, even though Tamar was fit for him? It was because he caused Yosef to be sold, so that he did not marry a woman until he was thirty years old, it being because he was placed in jail. And since Yehudah caused it that he not find a wife until he was thirty, that is why David did not reign until he was thirty. Another explanation: \"From tearing my son (Yosef) you arose\" (Genesis 49:9) - you did not kill Yosef (you prevented his death), and caused him to become great when he was thirty. That is why David reigned when he was thirty."

So he got himself ready and went to search out and find the man. When he got close to the place of the man he asked about him, and the whole world wondered why the Hasid would want to see such a villainous man. This made the Hasid sad, but still, he went to the house of the man. When the hasid arrived, the man came out of his house incredibly angry and struck the hasid on his face, and pulled down the hasid’s pants. The man said to the hasid, “Enter if you like.” And the man and his friends mocked the hasid. The hasid payed no attention and entered the room adjacent to the bordello. That night all the prostitutes of the town entered the room next to where the hasid was and drank wine until they became intoxicated, and the man danced before them all night until they passed out. The hasid saw all of this and cried. The next day the hasid prepared to return home, but before he left he asked the man, “On your life, tell me if you have ever done good in your days, because I saw in a dream that you are sitting next to me in the Garden of Eden, yet you do all of this licentiousness. How can it be that you will sit with me? The man said to the hasid, “All that you I have done that you have seen is for the good. I only make it appear that I am licentious, I offer prostitutes a higher price to come with me, and they think I will spend the night with them when they are drunk, what’s more, I tell my mother to come in at night and pull me out by the hair, so if the prostitutes ask, ‘Why did you not sleep with us?’ I can reply, ‘You know that my mother beats me.’ And this is how I prevent licentiousness among Hebrew women."
