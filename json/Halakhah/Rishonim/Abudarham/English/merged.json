            "The reason women are exempt from time-triggered positive commandments is that a woman is subjugated to her husband fo rthe fulfillment of his needs. If she were obligated to perform time-triggered commandments, it might happen that just when she is performing the commandment her husband will command her to do his bidding. If she were to fulfill the command of the Creator and ignores his [her husband's] command, woe to her from her husband! And if she were to fulfill his command and ignore that of the Creator, woe to her from her Maker! Therefore the creator exempted her from his commandments, so that she can be at peace with her husband."

                "A person blesses these three blessings each day: the first is <b>who has not made me a gentile</b>, since \"All nations are as naught in His sight; He accounts them as less than nothing\" (Isaiah 40:17). The second is <b>who has not made me a [Canaanite] slave</b> since the slave is not commanded in positive commandments which are caused by time, and further, that they have no merit of ancestry, since their ancestors did not stand at Mount Sinai. And further, that we do not believe them, since \"the more slaves, the more theft\" (Pirkei Avot 2:7). And further, that it is forbidden for a slave to marry a Jewish woman, and that a slave is close to a gentile. The Rama\"h questions if a convert blesses \"who has not made me a gentile\" and if a captive blesses \"who has not made me a slave\", and replies that so we have seen, the blessing applies specifically to the beginning of the creation of man, and as such a convert does not bless \"who has not made me a gentile\" except when they were entirely born and bred (pregnancy and birth) in holiness [Judaism]. But the captive blesses \"who has not made me a slave\", since this blessing was not established for slavery itself but rather since the slave is not obligated in commandments like a Jew, and is not fitting to enter the community [marry into it], and is unsuitable for many things. And the third blessing is <b>who has not made me a woman</b>, since she is not commanded in positive commandments that are caused by time as we have explaned in the introduction to this book. The man is similar to a labourer who enters a field and plants with permission, and the woman is similar to one who enters a field without permission. And further, that the fear of her husband is upon her and she is unable to perform even that which she is commanded in. And women are accustomed to bless instead of \"who has not made me a woman\", \"who has made me according to His will\", like one who justifies the Judgement regarding the evil that has come upon them.\n"

For God is exalted and the humble will understand this; also it is said, “God raises up those who are bowed down;” that is, when we mention God’s name he raises up those who are bowed. “When Rav Sheshet bowed he bowed all at once, like a cane, without delay.

He is considered as one who says, “Into your hand I entrust my spirit” (Ps. 31:6) The Holy One of Blessing raises up clouds and brings down dew and rain in order to sustain them (in sleep) and then returns the soul to the person. Therefore, we connect sleep to מחיה מתים,One who gives life to the dead רב להושיע משיב הרוח ומוריד הגשם <b>the Mighty One to deliver us.

                "The second mention relates the resurrection of the dead to rainfall, as we learn in the first chapter of <i>Ta’anit:</i> “Rabbi Abbahu said: The day of rain is greater than the resurrection of the dead. While the resurrection of the dead benefits the righteous and not the wicked, as is said, “Many of those that sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to eternal life, others to reproaches, to everlasting abhorrence.” (Da. 12:2), while rain benefits both the righteous and the wicked.” <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">BT Taanit 25b</i>",

                "<b>He causes wind to blow and rain to fall</b> is based on “He causes His wind to blow, and the waters flow.” (Ps.147:18) This is a mighty act because every drop of rain comes from above, and the wind does not blow without purpose; rather God causes the rain to fall wherever God wishes. This is an act of might; there is no act like it. Bringing life to death is dependent upon it as we have said. It is also written, “Who performs great deeds which cannot be fathomed…” (Job 5:9) Juxtaposed to this verse is, “Who gives rain to the earth…” (Job 5:10) During the season when we do not mention the might of the rain, we say, “He causes the dew to follow.” Dew is also a form of resurrection based on the fact that it gives life to the dead, as Scripture states, “Let corpses arise! Awake and shout for joy, you who dwell in the dust! For Your dew is like the dew on fresh growth…” (Is. 26:19) Also, there is great power when the dew falls, since it comes each day and it never ceases.",

Elazar ben Azarya said: Providing a person’s food is as difficult as the splitting of the Red Sea, as it is written: “Who split apart the Sea of Reeds, His steadfast love is eternal;” (Ps. 136:13) Close to this verse it states, “He gives food to all flesh, for His mercy endures forever” (Ps. 136:25) If one makes a garment for a person, the person enjoys it for a year or two but a meal only provides benefit from one meal to the next!",
                "<b>With Kindness:</b> That is, God does it out of His kindness and not because of the righteousness of his creations. We learn in the first chapter of <i>Ta’anit: “</i>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: There are three keys in the hand of the Holy One of blessing, which were not transmitted to an intermediary. And they are: The key of rain, the key of birthing, and the key of the resurrection of the dead. The key of rain, as it is stated: “<i>Adonai</i> will open for you His good treasure, the heavens, to give the rain of your land in its due time” (Deut. 28:12). From where is it derived the key of birthing? As it is written: “And God remembered Rachel and listened and opened her womb. (Gen. 30:22) From where is it derived that the key of the resurrection of the dead is maintained by God Himself? As it is written: “And you shall know that I am the Lord when I have opened your graves” (Ez. 37:13). <b>I</b>n the West (the land of Israel), they say: The key of livelihood is also in God’s hand, as it is written: “You open Your hand and satisfy every living thing with favor” (Ps.145:16)” <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">BT <i>Ta’anit</i> 2b</i> The Talmud then asks, “And what is the reason that Rabbi Yoḥanan did not consider this key of livelihood in his list?

                "<b>Resurrect of the dead with great mercy</b> as we have explained.

There are those who say that, “<b>He keeps His faith with those who sleep in the dust</b>,'' refers to the promise God made to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob who are referred to here as “those who sleep in the dust.” But Abraham is the most essential one. <b>Who is like You, Master of mighty deeds, and who can be compared to You,</b> is based on the verse, “To whom, then, can you liken God, with what form can you make comparison?” <b>A King Who causes death and restores life,</b> is based on, “<i>Adonai</i>, deals death and gives life.” (I Sam 2:6) God gives life and death in many ways, as we have explained above. <b>He causes deliverance to sprout forth,</b> based on “ <i>Adonai</i> will make victory and renown shoot upon the presence of all the nations.” (Is. 61:11) <b>And You are faithful to restore the dead to life,</b> in other words even now we believe that God restores life to the dead (even though it hasn’t happened yet).",

The <i>hatimah</i> of the first blessing is <b>Shield of Abraham</b> (corresponding to Abraham); the <i>hatimah</i> of the second blessing <b>Who gives life to the dead</b> corresponds to Isaac. His father took the knife in hand through the command of the Creator so that he was considered like a person who was dead. God did not allow Abraham to slaughter him so that it was as if he gave him back his life. The third <i>hatimah</i> is <b>The Holy God,</b> corresponding to Jacob, whose bed was whole and holy since no unfit offspring came from him. And the <i>Hatimah</i> <b>King who loves righteousness and justice</b>, alludes to King David who sat in judgment. Therefore, it was decreed at the end of each of these blessings that one mention <i>Melekh</i> because of their importance and because they allude to the Patriarchs and David. It is based on the verse, “I will give you great renown like that of the greatest men on earth.” (II Sam. 7:8) This is what I think.

We do not bless before we nullify chametz; the act of nullification depends on the intentions in one’s heart and one is not required to utter any words and no deed is involved at all, and one does recite a blessing on any mitzvah which is devoid of action, as we wrote in the introduction to this book.

You might answer that people separate from forbidden fat and meat that was not ritually slaughtered throughout the year, so we do not worry lest one accidentally partake of them, but one normally eats chametz and so we must worry. However, the question still stands, as we do not require a nazir to remove wine from his possessions even though he only separates himself  from it during the time of  his  vow. Furthermore, even though we eat grain all year round, and the new grains are forbidden  to be eaten until the 16th of Nisan even in the Diaspora, we are not required to remove it from our houses! Rather, we may explain that we are stringent regarding chametz because the Torah itself warned us more regarding chametz than regarding other mitzvot, prohibiting us from seeing chametz or having it found in our possession. Therefore, our Sages were more stringent and required us to perform bedikah to ensure we do not have a stumbling block. You can see that this is true from the fact that non-chametz prohibited foods are forbidden [in a  mixture] as long as they can be tasted. This even applies to wine used for libations to an idol; though even a minimal quantity of such wine prohibits wine into which it is mixed, it only prohibits other substances into which it is mixed so long as it can be tasted.

                "People are accustomed to reading the Song of Songs on the Festival of Matzot because it speaks about the salvation from Egypt, which is the beginning of the subjugation of Israel and their first redemption. As it is stated (Song of Songs 1:9), \"To a mare in Pharaoh’s chariots.\" And they are also accustomed to read Ruth on the Festival of Weeks (Shavuot), because it is written in it (Ruth 1:22), \"at the beginning of the barley harvest\" - and [Shavuot] is the the time of the harvest. And there is another reason: Because our ancestors only accepted the Torah and entered the covenant through circumcision, immersion and the sprinkling of blood [at that time], as it is found in the chapter [entitled] HaCholetz; and Ruth also converted, as it is stated (Ruth 1:16), \"for where you go, I shall go.\" And from the answer of Ruth, we know what Noami said to her. As she said to her, \"It is prohibited for us [to go beyond] the Shabbat perimeter.\" [She answered,] \"Where you go, I shall go\" (Ruth 1:16). \"Isolation [with a stranger of the opposite sex] is forbidden to us.\" \"Where you lodge, I shall lodge\" (Ruth 1:16). \"We are commanded to observe six hundred and thirteen commandments.\" \"Your people are my people\" (Ruth 1:16). \"Idolatrous worship is forbidden to us.\" \"Your God is my God\" (Ruth 1:16). \"Four types of capital punishment were handed over to the court.\" \"Where you die, I shall die\" (Ruth 1:17). \"Two burial grounds were set up for the court, one for those burnt and stoned and another for those executed and strangled.\" \"And there I shall be buried\" (Ruth 1:17). So is it found in the chapter [entitled] HaCholetz (Yevamot 47b). And we are hence accustomed to reading Ruth on  the Holiday of Weeks. And also on the Festival of Shemini Atzeret (Assembly of the Eighth), it is customary to read Ecclesiastes, because in it, it is written (Ecclesiastes 11:1), \"Distribute portions to seven or even to eight\" - these [correspond to] the seven days of the Festival (Sukkot) and the Festival of the Assembly of the Eighth. I mean to say, because it is the holiday of the reaping, to warn about the tithes and the priestly tithes and the pledges, such that they not transgress, \"you shall not delay,\" [past] the three festivals. And there is another reason - because King Shlomo said it on the Festival (Sukkot) during the assembly (<i>hakhel</i>). As it is written (Deuteronomy 31:10-12), \"at the appointed time of the year of remission, during the Sukkot festival;  When all of Israel comes to be seen, etc. Assemble (<i>Hakhel</i>) the people; the men and the women and the infants, etc.\" And it is [also] written (I Kings 8:2), \"they assembled before King Shlomo in the month of Etanim during the festival, etc.\" So he said it then in the assembly, to rebuke Israel. Hence it is fit to say it during [this] festival. All of this was written by Ibn HaYarchi (R. Avraham ben Natan). And they said in Tractate Soferim (14:3), \"One who reads from Ruth, the Song of Songs, Lamentations and from the Scroll of Esther must [recite the blessing that concludes], 'concerning the reading of the Megillah' - even though it is included in the Writings. One who reads from the Writings must recite, 'Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, [who has sanctified us with Your commandments and has commanded us] to read in the Holy Writings.'\" ",

                "Rav Saadia Gaon writes that there are 10 reasons why the Exalted Creator commanded us to blow the shofar on Rosh Hashana. 1. This day is the beginning of creation when God created the world and ruled over it. At the beginning of a king's reign, they sounds the trumpets and shofars, to promulgate in all locations that the new reign has begun; likewise, we accept upon ourselves God's reign on this day [by sounding the shofar]. This is also why King David said (Ps. 98:6) \"with trumpets and the blast of the horn raise a shout before Ad-nay, the King\".2. Rosh Hashanah is the 1st of the 10 Days of Teshuva, and we blow the shofar in order to announce that all those who wish to do teshuva, should do so, and if not, there is no excuse. This is like what the kings do, that warn the people regarding a decree, and whoever transgresses the decree after the warning has no claim. 3. The shofar reminds us of the shofar at Mt. Sinai, when we accepted the Torah, as it is written \"and a very loud blast of the shofar\" (Exodus 19:16), and our ancestors accepted upon themselves \"we will do and we will listen\" (Exodus 24:7). 4. The shofar reminds us the words of the Prophets, who are compared to the tekiot of the shofar, as it is written \" If anybody hears the sound of the horn but ignores the warning, and the sword comes and dispatches him, his blood shall be on his own head. Since he heard the sound of the horn but ignored the warning, his bloodguilt shall be upon himself; had he taken the warning, he would have saved his life.\" (Ezekiel 33:4-5). 5. The Shofar reminds us of the destruction of the Holy Temple and the cries of war, as it is written \"Oh, the walls of my heart! My heart moans within me, I cannot be silent; my soul hears the teru'ot of war.\" (Jeremiah 4:19). When we hear this sound, we will beseech God to rebuild the Temple. 6. The shofar reminds us of the Binding of Isaac, who was ready to give his life for the sake of Heaven; likewise, we should also dedicate ourselves to sanctifying His name, and He will surely recall us for the good. 7. When we hear the sound of the shofar, we will tremble, be in awe and see our brokeness. This is the nature of the sound of the shofar, it causes one to tremble with trepidation, as it is written \"When a ram’s horn is sounded in a town, do the people not take alarm?\" (Amos 3:6). 8. The shofar reminds us of the ultimate Day of Judgment, as it is written \"The great day of Ad-nay is approaching, approaching most swiftly... a day of shofar blasts and alarms\" (Zephaniah 1:14-16). 9. The shofar reminds us of the Gathering of the Exiles when the shofar will be sounded, and this causes us to yearn for that time, as it is written \"And in that day, a great ram’s horn shall be sounded\" (Isaiah 27:13). 10.The shofar reminds us to believe in the resurrection of the dead, as it is written \"all you who live in the land, and inhabit the earth, when a flag is raised in the hills, take note! When a ram’s horn is blown, give heed!\" (Isaiah 18:3)."

And it says in another place [Midrash Tanchuma Warsaw ed. Parshat Balak 10] that \"anyone who sins and says 'I have sinned' an angel is not permitted to harm them. There are those who interpret 'aval' to mean 'alas' we have sinned and there are those who interpret it as 'indeed we have sinned' (Gen. 42:21). \"We and our ancestors\" is in the manner of \"confessing the sins that we Israelites have committed against You, sins that I and my father’s house have committed.\" (Nehemiah 1:6) and in the manner of \"stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers\" (Nehemiah 9:2). And it is written \"For we have sinned against the LORD our God\" (Jeremiah 3:25). [He then goes on to give a citation every word in the Viddui]",

But there are some places where they are accustomed to add, \"Praise the Lord, call in His name\" (Psalm 105), to say the addition (<i>yotzer</i>) of Shabbat and to say, \"<i>Keter</i>,\" in the additional service, even though it is a weekday. And it is a proper custom. The reason is because it is the end of the holiday and of the circling, and the completion of the seventy bulls [sacrificed over the course of Sukkot]. Moreover, it is because this day is the actual sealing that we requested from the Creator on Yom Kippur, to seal us for life. Hence we are accustomed to add, \"Praise the Lord, call in His name\" (Psalm 105), to say the addition (<i>yotzer</i>) of Shabbat and to say, \"<i>Keter</i>,\" in the additional service - since we consider it to be like a holiday. And when we bring back the Torah scroll [to the ark], we are accustomed to say, \"For the leader, a psalm of David - a song. Praise befits You, etc.\" (Psalm 65). That is because it mentions pleadings about water in it, which is from the day's theme. For on the morrow, we begin to request rain in our prayers. And we also say, \"Our transgressions, You atone for them,\" since [this day] is the actual sealing, as we said.  ",

For you will find [the phrase], \"and I will circle,\" twice in the Masorah - and these are them: \"I will rise and I will circle the city\" (Song of Songs 3:2); and \"and I will circle Your altar, O Lord\" (Psalms 26:6). That is to say, corresponding to that which I circled the city of Jericho seven times, I will circle Your altar [seven times]. ",

Five [congregants] read the Parashah of Zot HaBerakhah from the first one. [The reader] reads with the [first] four until, \"while you tread on their high places\" (Deuteronomy 33:29). And then he goes back with the fifth - who is the last one - from the beginning of Zot HaBerakhah until, \"in the eyes of all of Israel\" (the last verse in the Parashah and in the Torah). And the reason for this Parashah [being read on this day] is based on King Solomon having blessed Israel on the eighth day of the festival, as it is stated (I Kings 8:14), \"and he blessed all of the congregation of Israel, etc.\" That is why we read the blessing that Moshe blessed Israel on the ninth day, about which there is a doubt that it is the eighth day. And in the second [Torah scroll], the reader begins [Parashat] Bereishit until, \"which God had created to make\" (Genesis 2:2). And in the third [Torah scroll], he reads the final selection (<i>maftir</i>) like yesterday; and he concludes (recites the <i>haftara</i>) with the beginning of Joshua, \"And it was after the death of Moshe,\" until, \"for the Lord, your God, is with with wherever you shall go\" (Joshua 1:9).",

However the Sages, may their memory be blessed called it the birth, since every month the moon is hidden for about two days or a little less before it attaches itself to the sun, and it afterwards begins to be born and gather light. But its light does not [then] have the power to be seen by people. So that is like the matter of a newborn, since it does not have the power to act like the custom of [other] people, to walk and move like other animals.",
                "And according to the words of our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, that is the moment that the sun and the moon attach themselves to each other in their median path in one of the parts of the sky; and this is the same in all of the world. So that is the beginning of the next month and the end of the past month. And it would have been fitting to designate this as the start of the month, according to the path of the luminaries, were it not that the [precise] time of this birth is not visible to people, such that the only way to arrive at is by way of calculation and reasoning. But both of these are difficult for most of the world and questions come about them, such that the thoughts of people do not come to a single opinion. And because of that, the Holy One, blessed be He, was not stringent and did not command us to observe the start of the months from their beginning in the sky, which is the time of the [moon's] birth. Rather, He granted us leeway about the thing and give us permission to set the month according to the counsel of the sages, since we have no sign that testifies to us about its beginning in the sky, whereas its beginning according to our eyesight - which is what is revealed to us - is not the same in every person's eyes. And because of that, it requires assistance and control. So the Holy One, blessed be He, gave the right and the power over this to the hands of our sages, so that they could control it according to their opinion and their wisdom. And that is why the verse made the festivals depend on proclamation, in its stating (Leviticus 23:4), \"These are the festivals of the Lord, holy gatherings, which you shall proclaim in their seasons.\" That is to show that we have permission to set the festivals [by way of proclaiming the new months].
