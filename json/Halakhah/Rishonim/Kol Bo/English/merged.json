            "And I found in the [Midrash] Tanchuma, \"All matters of Shabbat are doubled: Two sheep; A cantillation (<i>Mizmor</i>), a song for Shabbat; two breads (<i>lechem mishneh</i>); 'Remember' (Exodus 20:8) and 'Guard' (Deuteronomy 5:12) - and it appears that the custom to light two lights is from this.\" All of this is from the composition by Rabbi Asher, from the Sefer HaMinhagot (Book of Customs). And it is also written there, \"And all Israel is obligated to eat three meals on Shabbat. And the early ones were accustomed to break between one meal and another in the morning, and to spread a [new] tablecloth and recite the grace after the meals. And there is one who gets up from the table to stroll outside the house, or in the house, and say a chapter or a mishnah.\" And it is a proper custom, since the spreading of a tablecloth is called a break [only] with regards to a group that was sitting and the [Shabbat begun] upon them - they may spread a tablecloth and recite Kiddush."

And those people who ate in a room adjacent to the [area of the] wedding canopy do not recite the blessings of grooms, since there is joy only at the wedding canopy. However, if there is one attendant for all of them, the attendant unites them together [such that they can all recite the blessings]."

This means that the enemies came to destroy everyone, men, women, and children, and there are those who say that the great miracle occurred through a woman. Her name was Judith, as the story goes, and she was the daughter of Yochanan, the high priest. She was extremely beautiful, and the Greek king wanted her to lay with him. She fed him a dish of cheese to make him thirsty, so that he would drink a great deal and became drunk, and recline and fall asleep. And it happened just that way, and once he was asleep, she took his sword and cut off his head. She brought his head to Jerusalem, and when the armies saw that their leader had been killed, they fled. For this reason, we have the custom of eating a cheese dish on Hanukkah.\n"

Never the less, it is not possible for them to complete a quorum of ten, because any situation which requires ten, requires men. The author of Aseres Hadibros wrote that women may not exempt men with the reading, because of \"kol b'isha erva.\" Even though they may light the Chanukkah candles and recite the blessing over them, that is not comparable, since it is not necessary for men to be there at the time of lighting."

Moreover, we do not recite the whole thing. However, that which it uses the term, complete, only means that one doesn’t skip around in it, like on Rosh Chodesh. And Rabbi Zerachiah, may his memory be blessed, wrote - and these are his words: And the closing [blessing] of Hallel is not on account of it requiring a blessing after it. For here there is not [the principle of], there is nothing that requires a blessing after it that does not require a blessing before it, and since we don’t recite a blessing before it, we may not recite a blessing after it. Rather we understand from it, that it is not from this reason that we make a blessing after it, but rather that the closing [blessing] is from the structure of Hallel. For so do we conclude it on the days [that we say] Hallel. Hence we do not differentiate from that on this night. And the Hallel that we say on this night is not from the category of Hallel, but from the category of saying song for the miracle. For this is as we learned (Pesachim 10:5), “Rabban Gamliel said, ‘Whoever has not said these three things on Pesach has not fulfilled his obligation.’” And [at that mishnah’s] end, we learned, “Therefore we are obligated [to praise].”"

For thus it is said of Achan, \"Israel has sinned\"(Joshua 7:11) even though he sinned, he is still Israel. Therefore, they still maintain their holiness and they are not removed from the generality of Israel who are not suspected for their oaths. However, if they have been excommunicated, since they must separate themselves from the community of the diaspora, if they were to include them, what would be left of their curse what good was their decree?
