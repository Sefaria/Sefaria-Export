        "Preface": [
            "Blessed is the L–rd, the G–d of Israel, who has separated us from all the peoples and given us His Torah and brought us to the holy land so that we merit fulfilling all of His mitzvoth. His sole intent was for our good alone, so that through this we become holy unto Him — viz. (Numbers 15:40): \"So that you remember and do all of My mitzvoth and be holy unto your G–d\" — and so that it be in our power to receive the effluence of His good and the abundance of His lovingkindness in this world and in the world to come, as it is written (Devarim 10:12- 13): \"What does the L–rd your G–d ask of you, but… to keep the mitzvoth of the L–rd and His statutes which I command you this day to do good unto you?\" (See the Ramban there to the effect that \"to do good unto you\" reverts to \"What does the L–rd your G–d ask of you.\") ",
            "And not only has He given us His special treasure, but He has also commanded us not to forsake it, as it is written (Mishlei 4:2): \"For a goodly acquisition have I given you; do not forsake My Torah\" — unlike the way of flesh and blood, who, if he gives his friend a fine gift, and the other does not deport himself with it correctly, and it is not beloved in his eyes, he pines for the day that his friend will abandon it altogether, so that he can take it back for himself. Not so is the way of our G–d. For He established for us prophets in all the generations of the first Temple to return us to the good. And even in the days of the second Temple, when (in our many sins) Israel descended from its pristine holiness, and when they lacked five things which obtained in the first Temple [ark, ark-cover, and cherubim; the Heavenly fire; the Shechinah; prophecy; and the urim vetumim (viz. Yoma 21b)] — notwithstanding this, when we were on our land and had a Temple, we could fulfill all the mitzvoth of the Torah, and thereby bring to perfection all of the spiritual components within us (the soul [like the body] possessing 248 \"organs\" and 365 \"sinews\" [see Sha'arei Kedushah of R. Chaim Vital, Chapter One]). ",
            "But in the end of the days of the Second Temple, sinath chinam [vain hatred] and lashon hara [slander] increased among us (in our many sins), for which reason the Temple was destroyed and we were exiled from our land (viz. Yoma 9b and Yerushalmi 1:5). [Though the Gemara calls it \"sinath chinam,\" lashon hara is included, proceeding, as it does, from sinah. If this were not the case, they would not have been punished so severely; as the Gemara there concludes: \"This is to teach you that sinath chinam is equivalent to idolatry, illicit relations, and the spilling of blood.\" And we find the same in Arachin 15b in respect to lashan hara, and, likewise, in the discussion in Yoma itself (viz. 9b and 23a).] And from then until now, every day, we hope and pray before the Holy One Blessed be He that He draw us near [to Him], as He assured us in His holy Torah and through His prophets many times. But our prayer is not accepted by Him, as Chazal [our sages of blessed memory] have said (Berachoth 32b): \"From the day of the destruction of the Temple, a wall of iron separates Israel from their Father in heaven.\" ",
            "And, in truth, not against Him (G–d forbid) is our plaint, but against ourselves; for it [the redemption] is not beyond His powers, viz. (Isaiah 59:1-2): \"Behold, the L–rd's hand is not too short to save, and His ear is not too heavy to hear. But your sins have made a separation between you and your G–d, and your transgressions have hid [His] face from you, from hearing.\" And we find (viz. Sanhedrin 98a) that in the days of R. Yehoshua ben Levi he was told (viz. Tehillim 95:6) that the Messiah would come \"today, if you hearkened to His voice\" — even though the time of the exile decreed for Israel (one thousand years, corresponding to the one thousand year \"day\" of the Holy One Blessed be He, had not yet passed [viz. Chida, Petach Eiynayim, Sanhedrin, Ibid.]) In spite of this, the power of repentance would have annulled the decree. How much more so, more than eight hundred years after the end of that [one-thousand-year] \"day\", [should the Messiah come if we repented]! The fault is ours alone — that with our many sins we do not allow Him to repose His Shechinah in our midst. ",
            "And if we carefully searched our ways — which of the sins have primarily caused the length of our exile? — we would find them to be many; but the sin of lashon hara above all, for several reasons. First, for it was the major cause of our exile (as related in the aforementioned Gemaroth). This being so, as long as we do not undertake to correct this sin, how can there be a redemption, the sin being so severe as to have caused us to be exiled from our land! How much more so will it not allow us to return to our land! ",
            "Furthermore, is it not well known that exile had already been decreed upon us because of the act of the spies (viz. Tehillim 106:25-27): \"And they murmured in their tents [against the land]. They hearkened not to the voice of the L–rd. And He lifted up His hand [in oath] against them… to scatter them in the lands,\" as Rashi and the Ramban explain there (Bamidbar 14). And the sin of the spies — was it not that of lashon hara! (viz. Arachin 15a). Therefore, it is imperative that we correct this sin before the redemption can take place. ",
            "And we find it explicitly stated that it was this sin which caused the Jews to be worked [by the Egyptians] with back-breaking labor (viz. Shemoth 2:14 and Rashi there). And (Devarim Rabbah 6:14): \"The Holy One Blessed be He said: 'In this world, because there was lashon hara among you, I removed My Shechinah from you, but in the next world, etc.'\" And (Devarim 33:5): \"And He became a King in Yeshurun when the heads of the people were gathered together as one, the tribes of Israel,\" which Rashi interprets (as per Sifrei): \"When is He a King in Israel? Specifically, when the tribes of Israel are united and not divided into factions\" — which (factions) are well known to be the result of lashon hara. ",
            "And, aside from this, how can the hoped-for blessings of the Holy One Blessed be He repose upon us when, in our many sins, we have become habituated to this sin? Is there not an explicit curse on this in the Torah, viz. (Devarim 27:24): \"Cursed is he who strikes his neighbor in secret,\" which refers to lashon hara, as Rashi explains there (aside from the other curses which are superadded to this, as will be shown at the end of this preface)? ",
            "In addition, is it not seen from the aforementioned Gemara in Arachin that this sin is of infinite severity, so much so that they have branded its practitioners as heretics! And in Yerushalmi Peah 1:1, it is stated that punishment is exacted for this sin in this world, with the \"principal\" remaining (for punishment) in the world to come! ",
            "(See the end of this preface and my book Shmirath Halashon [Guarding One's Tongue], where we have transcribed all the relevant citations from the Talmud, the Midrash, and the holy Zohar. If one scrutinizes them carefully, the hairs of his head will stand on end!) ",
            "And it seems clear that the Torah was severe with this sin because he [the speaker of lashon hara] arouses the Great Adversary against Israel and thereby kills many people in many lands. Consider the language of the holy Zohar in (Shemoth) Pekudei 264b: \"There is a certain spirit appointed over all these speakers of lashon hara, which, when men are aroused to lashon hara, there is likewise aroused that malevolent, unclean spirit above, which is called sachsusa [\"contention\"]. Presiding over that arousal of lashon hara initiated by men, he rises on high and causes — by that arousal of lashon hara — death, sword, and slaughter in the world. Woe unto those who arouse this malevolent force by not guarding their mouth and their tongue, giving no thought to it, not knowing that on this lower arousal depends the higher arousal, both for good and for evil. And all of them arouse this Great Serpent to be an adversary against the world. And all this, because of the lashon hara arousal initiated below.\" ",
            "",
            "And we can say that this is the intent of the aforementioned Gemara in Arachin, viz.: \"All who speak lashon hara magnify transgression until the heavens, as it is written (Tehillim 73:9): 'They set their mouth in the heavens, and their tongue walks the earth.'\" That is, even though his tongue walks the earth, he sets his mouth against Heaven. And thus do we find it in Tanna d'bei Eliyahu (Rabbah Zuta 18) — that the lashon hara that he speaks rises against the Throne of Glory. We can hereby derive some idea of the greatness of the destruction wrought against Israel by the \"men of the tongue.\" ",
            "Another reason for the severity of this transgression: When a man taints his tongue with forbidden things, he prevents all expressions of sanctity which leave his mouth thereafter from rising on high. As stated by the holy Zohar in Pekudei: \"And upon this malevolent spirit there are contingent other inciters of din [judgment, punishment], which are designated to seize upon expressions of evil or of foulness which issue from a man's mouth, which are followed by expressions of holiness. Woe unto them! Woe to their lives! These men cause those other arousers of din to prevail and to taint the Holy Place. Woe to them in this world and woe to them in the world to come. For these other spirits of uncleanliness take this evil expression that has issued from his mouth, and sully the expression of holiness which follows, so that it is not ascribed to him, and the power of holiness has been, as it were, attenuated.\" Is it not evident from the holy Zohar that [in such an instance] all our words of Torah and prayer stand suspended in the air and do not arise on high? Whence, then, will they come to our aid for the coming of the Messiah and the like? ",
            "",
            "And when we delve more deeply into this matter, we find that in addition to its being a grave transgression in itself, it undermines all the [upper] worlds and darkens and lessens their light. For it is the habit of many men to redouble [violation of] this negative commandment many hundreds and thousands of times in the course of their lives. For even a small sin, when it is repeated many times, becomes like [thick] cart-ropes, as Isaiah exhorted (Isaiah 5:18): \"Woe unto those who draw forth iniquity with cords of deceit and [who draw forth] sin as [thick as] cart-ropes.\" This is analogous to the instance of a silken strand which is redoubled hundreds of times. How much more so is this sin [of lashon hara], which is extremely grave in itself and which countless men tend to repeat many thousands of times in the course of their lives without taking it upon themselves to guard themselves against it — how much more so is the [corresponding] undermining [of the worlds] above without limit! ",
            "And I sought to understand this: Why is it that this negative commandment has become insignificant in the eyes of so many men? And I reflected that this must be so for several reasons, [affecting] the common people on one hand and the [Torah] scholars on the other. The common people do not even know that the prohibition of lashon hara applies to what is true [as well as to what is untrue]; and the Torah scholars, even though they know for a certainty that it applies to what is true as well — some of them are misled by the yetzer hara [the evil inclination] in a variety of ways. One of these: The yetzer hara puts it immediately into his head that the one he is speaking of is a flatterer, and says to him: \"It is a mitzvah to expose the flatterers and the evil-doers.\" At other times it says to him: \"Isn't that man [you are speaking of] a stirrer-up of strife, about whom it is permitted to speak lashon hara?\" And sometimes it tempts him with the [halachic] permit of apei telata [lashon hara spoken in the presence of three], and, sometimes, of apei mara [convincing him that he would speak thus even to his (the victim's) face]. And the yetzer hara provides him with the relevant citations (see below, Principles II, III, and VIII). And sometimes he appeals to the nature of what is being said, i.e., that it is not in the category of lashon hara (e.g., what many, in our many sins, are prone to do), publicizing one as not being wise (as will be explained in Principle III). ",
            "In sum, the yetzer hara [in respect to lashon hara] acts in one of two ways: It convinces the speaker that what he says is not lashon hara, or that the Torah did not forbid speaking lashon hara against such and such a man. ",
            "And if the yetzer hara sees that in these ways he cannot prevail over the man, he deceives him in reverse, being so stringent with him in the area of lashon hara until he sees everything as entering into the category of lashon hara, to the extent that he sees it as impossible to live life thus constrained unless he separates entirely from the affairs of the world — as per the device of the [primal] subtle serpent, who said [to Eve] (Genesis 3:1): \"Did G–d really say do not eat from all the trees of the garden\"? [(when, in reality, he had interdicted only the Tree of Knowledge)] ",
            "Add to this that many men lack a fundamental understanding of the prohibition of receiving lashon hara — that it applies even to believing it in the heart [and not only to repeating it (though one is permitted to \"suspect\" it to be true, viz. Niddah 61a). The same is true of many similar instances in the area of receiving lashon hara and of rechiluth [talebearing], which cannot be specified here. And they also do not know how to make amends if they have transgressed the prohibition of speaking lashon hara and of receiving it. ",
            "Because of these reasons things have come to such a pass that one says whatever enters his mouth to say, without first considering that it might enter the category of rechiluth and lashon hara. (In our many sins), we have become so habituated to this sin that in the eyes of many men it is not considered a sin at all — even if he would say something which is apparent to everyone as absolute lashon hara and rechiluth, as when he would speak of his friend and demean him to the very ends of degradation. And if one asked him: \"Why did you speak lashon hara and rechiluth?\" he would think in his heart that he [his chastiser] thought to make him a [\"fanatic\"] tzaddik or chasid, and he would not accept his words at all, regarding this [(lashon hara and rechiluth)], in our many sins, as completely insignificant. ",
            "And all this proceeds — for the most part — from the laws of lashon hara and rechiluth not having been gathered into one spot, where there could be elucidated their nature and application, in principle and in practice. Instead, they are scattered in the Talmud and in the Rishonim (the early authorities). And even the Rambam in the seventh chapter of Hilchoth Deoth and Rabbeinu Yonah in the Sha'arei Teshuvah, who have paved the way for us in this area, have, nonetheless, been very terse, as is the way of the Rishonim. And there are also many dinim [laws] that are not mentioned in their words, as will be seen within. ",
            "",
            "",
            "",
            "",
            "And let the reader, my brother, know that for even the simplest thing found therein, I have indicated its source in the Be'er Mayim Chayim, so that it be clear before the eyes of all that I have not written this book according to the parameters of chasiduth [saintliness], but according to the parameters of din [Law]. ",
            "For the din flows from them [these sources]. \"And all who judge me by the scales of merit, may the Source [of life] judge them by the scales of merit.\" I have also written for this book a long, extensive foreword, explicating several negative and positive commandments frequently transgressed by those who do not guard themselves against this bitter sin of lashon hara and rechiluth. May the L–rd grant that the yetzer be smitten, when he [the transgressor] realizes the extent of the havoc and the harm wrought by his speech. Aside from this, the following (Midrash Rabbah 14:4) is well known: \"If you have labored much in their [the sages'] words, the Holy One Blessed be He removes the yetzer hara from you\" — whereupon I said to myself: \"Possibly, if they study this book, which is gathered from all the words of the Rishonim on this subject, and reflect upon them, the yetzer hara for this sin will not prevail so much over them.\" And, as a mater of course, if one starts to remove himself from this sin, he will come to remove himself from it entirely. For in this sin, habit plays a great part, and (Yoma 38b) \"One who comes to purify himself is assisted [by the L–rd].\" And in this merit, may the Redeemer [the Messiah] come to Zion,\" (Isaiah 50:29), speedily, in our days, Amen! "

        "Introduction to the Laws of the Prohibition of Lashon Hara and Rechilut": {
            "Opening Comments": [
                "In the Blessed One's love for His people Israel and His great desire for their good — to the point of calling them \"sons,\" and \"the portion of the L–rd,\" and \"inheritance,\" along with many other terms of affection which show His great love for Israel, viz. (Malachi 1:2): \"I have loved You, said the L–rd, etc.,\" He distanced them from all forms of evil, especially from lashon hara and rechiluth. For it is these which bring men to quarrels and contention and which very often can lead to the spilling of blood, as the Rambam wrote (Hilchoth Deoth 4:1): \"Even though there are no malkoth [stripes] for transgression of this negative commandment, it is a great sin, which leads to the killing of many souls in Israel, for which reason it [i.e., 'Do not go tale bearing among your people' (Vayikra 19:16) is followed by: 'Do not stand (idly) by the blood of your brother' — as evidenced by [the episode of] Doeg Ha'adomi and Nov, the city of priests (viz. I Samuel 22:9).\" ",
                "Some additional great evils brought about by this despicable trait: It is well known that the sin of the [primal] serpent was brought about by the lashon hara that it spoke against the Holy One Blessed be He, saying [to Eve]: \"He [G–d] ate from this tree [the Tree of Knowledge] and created the world,\" by which Eve was enticed to do likewise (viz. Shabbath 146a): \"The serpent was 'intimate' with Eve and injected zuhamah ['pollution'] into her\" — hence, [(the sin of) illicit relations], and also death to all mankind — hence, the spilling of blood. And through this [i.e., lashon hara] it induced Adam and Eve to transgress the will of the Holy One Blessed be He. It follows that one who speaks lashon hara adopts its [the serpent's] trait, which undermines the creation. ",
                "And the descent of Israel into Egypt, too, stemmed initially from this [i.e., from lashon hara], viz. (Bereshith 37:2): \"And Joseph brought evil report of them [the sons of Leah] to their father,\" whence it was decreed by Heaven, measure for measure, that he be sold into slavery, his having accused them of calling their brothers [from the maidservants] \"slaves\" (viz. Bereshith Rabbah 84:7 and Yerushalmi Peah 1:1). Though Joseph had a heter [halachic license] for bringing this \"evil report,\" as the exegetes explain, it is to be noted that this heter did not avail him [and he was sold into slavery].",
                "And again, the entire reason for our present exile is the sin of the spies (viz. Tehillim 6:25-27): \"And they murmured in their tents [against the land]. They hearkened not to the word of the L–rd. And He lifted up His hand [in oath] against them… to scatter them in the lands,\" as Rashi explains there and as the Ramban wrote (on Bamidbar 14:1). And it is stated in Arachin (15a) that the sin of the spies was essentially lashon hara, their giving out an evil report of the land. And because they then (on the eve of the ninth of Av) cried a \"vain\" cry, it (the ninth of Av) was decreed for them as a \"crying\" for the generations [e.g., the destruction of both Temples, etc.]. And countless other evils befell us because of this grave sin. For all the sages of Israel who were killed by King Yannai in the days of Shimon ben Shetach, the brother-in-law of King Yannai, were also killed because of the sin of rechiluth (viz. Kiddushin 66a). And the murder of the tanna, R. Elazar Hamodai, (which also contributed to the destruction of Betar) was likewise caused by rechiluth which was spoken against him before Ben Koziva (viz. Eichah Rabbah 2:4). ",
                "And because of the gravity of the evils found in this evil trait, the Torah exhorted us specifically against it by negative commandment, viz. (Vayikra 19:16): \"Do not go talebearing among your people,\" as shall be explained below (as opposed to anger, cruelty, and levity and the other corrupt traits, which even though they undermine the majesty of the soul and its form, and they were alluded to in many places in the Torah, as explained in the words of Chazal — with all this, there is no explicit negative commandment against them [as there is against rechiluth] in the count of taryag [the 613 commandments] of the Torah. ",
                "And we shall note yet another reason for the Torah's exhorting us explicitly against these — lashon hara and rechiluth. For when we analyze them in truth, we find them to include almost all the negative and positive commandments which obtain between a man and his neighbor and many between a man and his Maker, as we shall explain, G–d willing. It is for this reason that the Torah exhorted us against these explicitly, so that we not become enmeshed in this evil snare. I shall explain this with the help of the Blessed One. And from this there shall follow, incidentally, great benefit vis-à-vis many other halachoth. And also, perhaps, because of this, the yetzer will be smitten when he [the transgressor] perceives the great havoc and harm wrought by his speech. And here I begin, with the help of Him who grants a man knowledge. ",
                "First we must know the principles of these halachoth of lashon hara and rechiluth. (\"Lashon hara\" is speaking disparagingly against one's friend, and \"rechiluth,\" telling one the evil thing that his friend has spoken against him or done against him.) [The principles]: It [lashon hara and rechiluth] is forbidden even if true, as will be explained below, please G–d, in the name of all the poskim. Also, the prohibition of lashon hara and rechiluth applies both in his [the object's] presence and not in his presence. Also, there is no difference between speaking and receiving [lashon hara and rechiluth], all of which we shall explain further. A \"receiver\" of lashon hara is one who believes in his heart what is told him by his friend even if he does not abet him in the telling but only believes in his heart the lashon hara and rechiluth that he has heard. If he does believe it, he is called \"the bearer of a false report\" and transgresses (Shemoth 23:1): \"Do not bear a false report.\" All of these principles have roots and branches, as in the other parts of the Torah. May the L–rd grant that we know them comprehensively. ",
                "And know that whenever we write that he transgresses both the negative and the positive commandments and the three \"curses\" attaching to them, which we shall mention and elucidate below, our intent is both lashon hara and rechiluth, and both what is false and what is true. And this is what we shall refer to in the Be'er Mayim Chayim as \"in the first four modes\" (unless we explicitly state that it applies only in one of them). And it shall then remain necessary for us only to explain in respect to all of the negative or positive commandments whether they apply in his [the object's presence or not in his presence, or to the speaker or to the receiver. ",
                "And those negative or positive commandments which include all of the modes, I shall refer to, in short, in the Be'er Mayim Chaim as \"in all the eight modes\" — that is: lashon hara and rechiluth, in his presence or not in his presence, both to the speaker and to the receiver, and both if false or if true. (Remember these things, for I will not reiterate them in the introduction.) ",
                "First we shall explain how many negative commandments one transgresses in the speaking of lashon hara and rechiluth, and then, how many positive commandments. Then, how many \"curses\" he brings upon himself, and, further, how many great issurim [prohibitions] result from this. ",
                "I shall divide this introduction into two parts; the first, to be called \"Makor Chaim,\" and a supercommentary around it called \"Be'er Mayim Chayim.\" The reason for these names I have given in the preface. In the Be'er Mayim Chayim it will be made clear to which mode each negative or positive commandment applies, along with some other halachoth. This I begin with the help of Him who grants a man knowledge. "
            ],
            "Negative Commandments": [
                "1) One who bears tales against his friend transgresses a negative commandment, viz. (Vayikra 19:16): \"Do not go talebearing among your people.\" What is talebearing? \"Loading oneself\" with words and going from one to another, saying: \"This is what ploni [so and so] said about you\"; \"This and this is what I heard ploni did to you.\" Although what he says may be true, it destroys the world. And there is a sin much greater than this — lashon hara, which is included in this negative commandment. And that is speaking disparagingly of one's friend, even if what is said is true. But one who speaks falsely [about his friend] is referred to as a \"motzi shem ra\" [one who spreads an evil report]. ",
                "2) And the speaker or the receiver [of lashon hara] also transgresses (Shemoth 23:1): \"Do not receive [tissa] a false report,\" which can also be read as: \"Do not spread [tassi] a false report,\" so that this negative commandment includes both [the speaker and the receiver]. ",
                "3) And the speaker also transgresses (Devarim 24:8): \"Be heedful of the plague-spot of leprosy to take great care,\" which Sifra (1:3) interprets as [Take great care] not to forget to be heedful of lashon hara so that leprosy not come upon you [as it came upon Miriam for speaking lashon hara against Moses]. ",
                "4) And both the speaker and the receiver transgress (Vayikra 19:14): \"And before the blind man do not place a stumbling-block\"; for each one [i.e., both the speaker and the listener] places a stumbling-block before his friend to transgress explicit negative commandments in the Torah. But there is a difference between the speaker and the listener in this regard. For the speaker transgresses this negative commandment both whether the listeners are many or few. Even more so, the more the listeners, the more he [the speaker] transgresses this negative commandment, placing a stumbling-block before many people. Not so the receiver. It is possible that he does not transgress this negative commandment unless he himself hears the lashon hara or the rechiluth from him [the speaker] at the moment, so that if he had left him, he would have no one to relate his lashon hara to. But if there are, besides him, different listeners at the time, it is possible that the hearer does not transgress this negative commandment, but only others mentioned in this introduction [see Be'er Mayim Chayim]. And all this, if he came after the \"recital\" had started. But the first listener — even though others arrived afterwards — certainly transgresses in all eight modes, for the issur was initiated through him. In any event, one must take great heed of such companions, not to sit with them; for \"above\" they are all inscribed as \"a company of wickedness.\" And thus is it found in the will of R. Eliezer Hagadol to Hyrcanus, his son: \"My son, do not sit with the companies of those who speak ill of their friends, for when their words rise on high, they are inscribed in a book, and all who stand there are described as \"a wicked company.\" ",
                "5) And the speaker of lashon hara also transgresses (Devarim 8:11): \"Take heed unto yourself lest you forget the L–rd your G–d,\" which is an exhortation to the proud of spirit, for since he mocks and ridicules his friend, he apparently considers himself wise and \"a man among men.\" For if he knew his own faults, he would not deride his friend. And the statement of Chazal in Sotah (4b) on the severity of the sin of pride is well known, viz.: Because of it his dust does not wake for the resurrection, he is considered an idolator, the Shechinah wails over him, and he is called \"an abomination.\" And, especially, if in shaming his friend he honors himself, he certainly transgresses this negative commandment, aside from our Rabbis' (in their holy spirit) having \"cut him off\" from the world to come, saying (Yerushalmi Chagigah 12:1): \"One who honors himself by the shame of his friend has no share in the world to come.\" ",
                "6) The speaker and the receiver [of lashon hara] also transgress (Vayikra 22:32): \"And you shall not profane My holy name,\" in that there is no lust or physical pleasure to cause his yetzer to intensify itself over him, so that this sin is regarded as rebellion and blatant divesting oneself of the yoke of Heaven; and he profanes the name of Heaven thereby. This, even in the instance of a plain Jew; how much more so in the instance of a man of eminence, whom they all look up to for guidance [speaking lashon hara], where the name of Heaven is certainly profaned! And how much more so, if this sin were committed in public, would it be extremely grave, the transgressor being called \"a desecrator of the name of G–d in public.\" ",
                "7) And sometimes the speaker transgresses (Leviticus 19:17): \"You shall not hate your brother in your heart,\" as when he \"speaks peace\" with his friend in his presence, and denigrates him before others when he is not in his presence. And much more [does he transgress] if he explicitly charges them not to go and inform him, in which instance he, of a certainty, transgresses this negative commandment. ",
                "(8-9) Sometimes the speaker also transgresses (Vayikra 19:18): \"You shall not take revenge and you shall not bear a grudge, as when he [the speaker] bears hatred towards him, having asked him to lend him something and having been denied; and, thereafter, seeing something demeaning in him, he publicizes it before others. From the beginning, he transgresses \"You shall not bear a grudge,\" by bearing the grudge in his heart. And later, when he takes revenge and reveals the demeaning thing he has seen in him, he transgresses \"You shall not take revenge.\" But he must wipe the thing from his heart!",
                "",
                "(10) And if one arises and testifies against another by himself before beth-din concerning something forbidden, since no benefit can result from this vis-à-vis monetary [obligations, imposition of] an oath, or invalidation of the other's status of kashruth [halachic fitness] since he is only a single witness in the matter, the only thing he \"accomplishes\" by this is giving the other a bad name, and he also transgresses the negative commandment of (Devarim 19:15): \"One witness shall not testify against a man for every transgression and for every sin,\" and beth-din must punish him with stripes for this. ",
                "(11) And all this that we have written applies to one who speaks singly or who listens singly, but if he joins himself to a company of wicked men and speakers of lashon hara to tell them or to listen to them, he also transgresses (Shemoth 23:2): \"Do not incline after many for evil,\" which is an exhortation not to agree with or even join with evildoers, though they be many. (And see further, Positive Commandment 6, where you will see that he also transgresses a positive commandment by this evil \"joining.\" And see above (Negative Commandment 4) where I have cited Pirkei d'R. Eliezer on his [R. Eliezer Hagadol's] will to his son in this regard. ",
                "(12) And if he nurtures a quarrel in his speaking, he transgresses (Bamidbar 17:5). \"And he shall not be as Korach and as his congregation,\" which is an exhortation against nurturing a quarrel (viz. Sanhedrin 110a). ",
                "(13) And many times another negative commandment is transgressed. For very often one's friend is demeaned for his early deeds, for a family trait, for the paucity of his learning, or for his [mediocre] work, each man according to his situation, things being said to him which anger and confound him and against which he has no defense. Even if this transpired between the two of them alone [no one else being present], he [the speaker] transgresses (Vayikra 25:17): \"And you shall not wrong, one man his fellow,\" which refers to verbal wronging (viz. Bava Metzia 58b). How much more so if this occurred in the company of others! It emerges, then, that if one slights his friend both through rechiluth or through lashon hara, before him alone or before others, aside from transgressing the negative commandment of lashon hara and rechiluth, as stated above, he also transgresses this negative commandment. ",
                "(14) And if he demeans another thus, with such words and the like, before him [alone] and before others, to the extent that his face changes color [with shame], he transgresses also (Vayikra 19:17): [\"Reprove, reprove, your fellow and] do not bear sin because of him.\" The Torah exhorted one hereby not to shame his fellow Jew, even for the sake of reproof and [even] between him and the other [alone]. That is, not to speak so sharply to him that he shames him — How much more so [i.e., should he not do so], if not for the sake of reproof and if he is in the presence of others. And all this, if it did not take place in public, but if he \"whitens\" his face [with shame] in public, Chazal have already \"cut him off\" from the world to come, saying (Bava Metzia 59a): \"One who whitens his friend's face in public has no share in the world to come.\" ",
                "(15) And if the other were an orphan or a widow, even if they were wealthy, and he spoke demeaningly before them, he also transgresses (Shemoth 22:21): \"Every widow and orphan you shall not afflict,\" the Torah exhorting hereby not to taunt them or sadden their heart with any kind of sorrow. The punishment for this is explicit in the Torah (Ibid 23): \"And My wrath shall burn, and I shall kill you by the sword, and your wives will be widows, and your children, orphans.\" ",
                "(16) And sometimes he transgresses also the issur of flattery, which is to many Geonim (e.g., HaRe'em, Baal Hatosfoth, and Hagaon R. Shlomoh ben G'virol) an absolute negative commandment, (viz. Bamidbar 35:33): \"And you shall not flatter [the men of] the land.\" That is, if his intent in speaking lashon hara and rechiluth is to flatter the listener, whom he knows to bear hatred to the one spoken about, and thereby, to find favor in his eyes — an egregious sin — is it not enough that he does not fulfill the mitzvah of reproof (a positive commandment in the Torah), to reprove him for the hatred he bears his friend, that he also strengthens the hatred that already exists among them! And through him [the speaker], he [the listener] will persist in his wrong more and more, so that more quarrels and wrongs will result (G–d forbid)! <br>And know that this [the following] sin (in our many sins) is widespread. That is, when one speaks demeaningly of his friend, (often,) the listener, knowing that what is being said is unfounded, nevertheless nods his head [in agreement] and he, too, \"smoothes over\" the thing with his tongue, adding some words of taint. For the speaker is sometimes a man of means, or the like, from whom he receives favors, or who he fears will regard him as unwise, or the like [for remaining silent]. And, therefore, the yetzer will entice him, too, to concur in this. But know, my brother, that this, too, is essentially a transgression of the negative commandment of flattery — even if he adds but a few words — as is explained in the Be'er Mayim Chayim.<br> And in this regard it is written (Mishlei 23:2): \"And put a knife to your throat [against speaking lashon hara] if you are a man of spirit.\" And one must rather expose himself to danger than bring his soul to such a sin. According to the Torah, every man under such circumstances must, in any event, strengthen himself not to abet him [the speaker] even by so much as one movement which would cause it to appear that he concurs with what he is saying. And in this connection we can understand the words of Chazal (Eiduyoth 5:6): \"It is better to be called a fool all of one's days than to be wicked one moment before the Almighty.\" And this, even if he knows that his words of reproof will not be accepted by the speaker; for, otherwise, he certainly must reprove him for this, too (as will be explained, G–d willing, in Hilchoth Lashon Hara, Principle VI). ",
                "(17) And sometimes there is yet another negative commandment which is found to be transgressed (in our many sins) — speaking lashon hara against someone in anger, and, at the same time, cursing him — sometimes even by the Name (even if in the vernacular). In doing so, one transgresses an absolute negative commandment viz. (Vayikra 19:14): \"Do not curse a deaf man\" (the meaning being \"even\" a deaf man — how much more so, one who is not deaf, as explained in Choshen Mishpat 27:1). <br>We have hereby enumerated seventeen negative commandments which are often attendant upon lashon hara and rechiluth — even if he speaks only to a Jew. (For if he slanders a Jew to a non-Jew, the issur is greater and graver, sometimes entering into the category of massur [informing], as we shall explain, G–d willing, in Hilchoth Lashon Hara, Principle VIII). And (transgression of) many of the aforementioned negative commandments are subject to death at the hands of Heaven — such as demeaning a widow or an orphan or profaning the Name. And many of them have implications for the world to come, such as \"whitening\" the face of one's friend in public or honoring oneself in the shame of his friend. This, in the instance of one who habituates himself to this grave transgression of lashon hara and rechiluth, all of which will be explained below, God willing. "
            ],
            "Positive Commandments": [
                "<b>And now I shall begin, with the help of the Blessed L–rd to explain how many positive commandments one transgresses in speaking lashon hara and rechiluth, as we projected above. </b> <br>One who bears tales against his friend, aside from transgressing the negative commandments we mentioned above, also transgresses several positive commandments, which I shall explain, with the help of the Blessed One, one by one. <br>(1) He transgresses thereby (Devarim 24:9): \"Remember what the L–rd your G–d did to Miriam on the way when you went out of Egypt.\" The Torah exhorted us hereby that we mention verbally, always, the great punishment [leprosy] that the Blessed L–rd brought upon the tzadeketh, Miriam the prophetess — who spoke only about her brother, whom she loved as her soul, whom she raised on her knees, and for whom she endangered her life, to rescue him from the Nile. And she did not speak in denigration of him, but only compared him to other prophets. And she did not speak so to his face to shame him, and not in public, but only to her brother Aaron, privately. And he [Moses] was not offended by all this, viz. (Bamidbar 12:3): \"And the man Moses was extremely humble, more than any man on the face of the earth\" — in spite of which all her good deeds did not avail her and she was punished with leprosy for this. How much more so will other people, the fools, who are prolix in speaking \"great and awesome things\" against their friends, be severely punished for this. ",
                "(2) And he [the speaker of lashon hara] also transgresses (Vayikra 19:18): \"And you shall love your neighbor as yourself,\" whereby we have been commanded to be as solicitous for our friend's money as we are for our own, and to be solicitous of his honor, and to speak in his praise, as we are solicitous for our own honor. And if one speaks or receives lashon hara and rechiluth against his friend, though it be true, it is apparent that he does not love him at all — how much more so is he in violation of \"as yourself!\" <br>And the great proof of this [that he is in violation of \"as yourself\"] is as follows: Does not every man know his own shortcomings? — in spite of which he would not want his friend to know, under any circumstances, even one thousandth of them! And even if it happens that a few of his faults become known to his friend, who goes and speaks of them to others — how he stands and waits, wishing the L–rd to grant that they not accept his words and not believe him! And all so that he not be seen in their eyes as unworthy — even though he knows himself to be guilty of very many sins, far more than his friend has revealed. In spite of this, in the access of his self-love, everything is swept away. Thus, exactly in this way must one conduct himself vis-à-vis his friend according to the Torah, to be solicitous of his honor in every respect. <br>And not in vain did the Torah relate to us the episode of Noach, viz. (Bereshith 9:21-23): \"And he drank from the wine and he was inebriated and he uncovered himself in the midst of his tent. And Cham the father of Canaan saw the nakedness of his father and he told his two brothers outside. And Shem and Yefeth took the garment and placed it on the shoulders of both and they covered the nakedness of their father, and their faces were [kept] turned backwards [when they drew near him to cover him], and the nakedness of their father they did not see.\" And the Torah also relates to us the blessing by which Noach blessed them (viz. Ibid 26-27) and which was ultimately realized — to reveal to us the greatness of this attribute, that one must cover up any unseemliness in his friend with all of his power, just as he would for himself! ",
                "(3) And sometimes he also transgresses (Vayikra 19:5): \"In righteousness shall you judge your neighbor.\" For example, if one sees his friend saying something or doing something, which may be perceived as righteous and meritorious or as the reverse, even if he [his friend] is a mediocre person, we are obligated by the Torah in this positive commandment to judge him in the scales of merit. (And if that man is G–d-fearing, we are obligated to judge him in the scales of merit even if they incline more to guilt than to merit.) And one who goes and speaks demeaningly of him because of this thing that he said or that he did, or the receiver [of these words], who perceives him negatively because of what he has heard about him, and does not judge him in the scales of merit, transgresses this positive commandment. ",
                "(4) And if through his lashon hara or rechiluth he lowers his friend so that he loses his livelihood as a result, as when through evil-heartedness he publicizes his friend as being dishonest, or, if he is a worker, as being unfit for his work, or the like, he also transgresses (Vayikra 25:35): \"And if your brother grows poor and his hand falls with you, then you shall uphold him [even if he be], proselyte or sojourner; and he shall live with you.\" And (Ibid 16): \"And your brother shall live with you,\" whereby we have been commanded to uphold the hand of an Israelite who has fallen [\"on hard times,\"], either by giving him a gift or a loan, or by going into partnership with him, or by finding a job for him, so that he be strengthened thereby and not fall and be beholden to men. How much more so are we commanded not to cause him to lose his livelihood! ",
                "(5) And sometimes, by accepting the lashon hara or the rechiluth, he also transgresses (Ibid 19:16): \"Reprove shall you reprove your neighbor.\" As when he sees his friend beginning to speak demeaningly of another, and he knows that his words [of reproof] will be accepted by his friend (or even if there is a possibility that they will be accepted), the din is that he must reprove him so that the sin not be consummated. Therefore, if he allows him to consummate his lashon hara, he certainly transgresses this positive commandment. ",
                "(6) And all that we have written applies even if he speaks demeaningly of his friend to him [alone]. But if he joins himself to a company of men of wickedness and speakers of lashon hara in order to speak to them demeaningly of his friend or to hear [such words] from them, he transgresses also (Devarim 10:20): \"And to Him shall you cleave,\" which Chazal explain as cleaving to Torah scholars, frequenting their assemblies in all circumstances — even eating and drinking with Torah scholars and doing business with them and joining them in all types of activities — all this, in order to learn from their deeds. Therefore, certainly, one who does the opposite of this, joining himself to a company of wicked men, transgresses this positive commandment. ",
                "(7) And all this, even if not in the house of study. But if one speaks lashon hara and rechiluth in the house of study or in the house of prayer, he also transgresses (Vayikra 19:30): \"And My sanctuary shall you fear.\" (Our house of study is included in the category of the sanctuary, as explained by the poskim.) And we have been commanded by this verse to fear the One who resides there, wherefore we may make there only reckonings of mitzvah, such as [those pertaining to] the tzedakah fund and the like. How much more so is it forbidden to engage there in laughter, joking, and idle converse. And this is a categorical prohibition, as explained in Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim 151:11. And even more so is it forbidden to speak there lashon hara or rechiluth, out of fear of the Blessed L–rd who dwells there, aside from the grave issur in itself [of speaking lashon hara]. In speaking thus, one shows himself not to believe that the Holy One Blessed be He reposes His Shechinah in this house — whereby he has the audacity to speak in the house of the King against the will of the King. <br>And even those who study Torah regularly in the house of study, where they are permitted to eat and drink (as explained in the aforementioned Orach Chaim, section 1), in any event, if they go astray in the issur of laughing and joking or lashon hara and rechiluth in the house of study, they transgress the positive commandment of \"My sanctuary shall you fear,\" aside from the issur itself. As the Magen Avraham wrote (151:2): \"Are the Torah scholars not exhorted in respect to fear of the sanctuary? All that was permitted them, perforce, is eating and drinking because they learn in the house of study. If they had to eat and drink outside the house of study, their studies would be interrupted.\" (As far as converse in general which is not talk of levity for Torah scholars in the house of study, see what we have written with the help of the L–rd in Part Three.) ",
                "8) And if the one before whom he spoke lashon hara or rechiluth were an elder and he demeaned him with this to his face, even if he were an elderly ignoramus, he also transgresses (Vayikra 19:32): \"And you shall honor the face of the elder.\" (And even though the \"elder\" of the verse refers to one who is wise, Chazal have explained that \"And you shall honor\" also reverts to \"the hoary head\" (seivah) that precedes it), for \"honor\" refers to honoring with words, i.e., speaking to him with honor and respect. And if he demeans him, he certainly does not honor him. Likewise, if he is wise, even if he is not elderly, he also transgresses this positive commandment. For the \"elder\" [zaken] of the verse refers to a sage, as it is expounded: [zaken] \"he who has acquired wisdom\" (aside from his coming many times to transgress thereby the graver issur of shaming a Torah scholar, thereby entering the category of apikores [heretic] according to the din. We shall enlarge upon this, the L–rd willing.) And if he is an elder and also a sage, he transgresses \"And you shall honor\" doubly. ",
                "(9) And if he whom he spoke about were a Cohein, and he demeaned him thus to his face, he also transgresses (Vayikra 21:8): \"And you shall sanctify him,\" whereby we have been exhorted to accord them [the Cohanim] much honor. And since he speaks lashon hara or rechiluth against him and shames him, he certainly does not honor him thereby, and he transgresses. ",
                "(10) And if he [the one spoken against] were his older brother, or his mother's husband or his father's wife, he also transgresses the positive commandment of \"honoring,\" their having been included [in this mitzvah by the addition of \"ve'eth\", [(Shemoth 20:12): \"Honor your father and [ve'eth] your mother,\" as explained in Kethuvoth 103a)]. How much more so — if, G–d forbid, [he speaks lashon hara] against his father or mother themselves, where he certainly transgresses the positive commandment of honoring father and mother — [is such lashon hara especially egregious]! Aside from all this, he also transgresses (Devarim 27:16): \"Cursed is he who demeans his father and his mother\" — may Heaven protect us! ",
                "(11) And in all instances, he also transgresses (Devarim 6:13): \"The L–rd your G–d shall you fear,\" whereby we have been exhorted to fear the Blessed L–rd all the days of our life. And, when an act [of transgression] comes to hand, we are obligated to arouse our spirit at that time [to the realization that] the Holy One Blessed be He observes the deeds of all men, and \"returns them vengeance\" according to the evil of the deed; and [in this realization] he will keep from transgressing the will of his Maker. And, of a certainty, one who abandons his soul to this grave transgression of lashon hara and rechiluth violates this positive commandment [of fearing the L–rd]. ",
                "(12) And in all instances, he transgresses at that time of speaking lashon hara and rechiluth, the mitzvah of learning Torah, which is an absolute positive commandment, as explained by the Rambam in (Hilchoth Talmud Torah 1) and in his Sefer Hamitzvoth (Positive Commandments 11) and by all the enumerators of the mitzvoth. And there is no limit to the reward of this mitzvah, which is over and against all of the mitzvoth, as explained in the Mishnah (Peah 1:1) and in Yerushalmi (Ibid). For all of the mitzvoth are not comparable to one pronouncement of Torah. And, conversely, the punishment for its neglect is over and against all of the transgressions, as Chazal have explained (Petichah d'Eichah Rabbati 2): \"The Holy One Blessed be He 'overlooked' the sins of idolatry, illicit relations, and the spilling of blood; but He did not overlook the sin of neglect of Torah.\"<br> At other times, one goes clean of din \"on high\" for transgression of this sin [of neglect of Torah study] by reason of being occupied with earning a livelihood or in pondering how to gain one. But when he speaks lashon hara or rechiluth, how does his livelihood \"gain\" from this? And he also transgresses in this time of speaking [lashon hara] many negative commandments. As explained in Semag (Negative Commandments 13), we have been exhorted by the Torah in many negative commandments not to separate ourselves from Torah in any manner. For there is always some way in which one can fulfill the positive commandment of [studying] Torah — If he is a steady learner, through his learning; and if he is not a learner, he can study the holy works that are translated into the vernacular [Yiddish] in our time, such as Chovoth Halevavoth, Menorath Hamaor, and the like; and he need not remain idle from learning Torah, and speak lashon hara and rechiluth [instead].<br> And I have also seen this [idea] stated in the name of the GRA [the Gaon of Vilna], who explained the difference between din [judgment] and cheshbon [reckoning]. \"Din\" — one's being judged for the transgression itself; cheshbon — one's being held to account — at the time of judgment for transgression — for the time he could then have spent in fulfilling a mitzvah. \"Woe unto us on the day of din!\" What can we answer if the Holy One Blessed be He reckons against us (for each moment of idle, derogatory, talk and light-headedness, or rechiluth and lashon hara) even the transgression of neglect of Torah for that time alone! For, in truth, with each word of Torah learning, one fulfills the positive commandment [of Torah study] itself! And if one learns a chapter of Mishnayoth or a page of Gemara, he fulfills many hundreds of mitzvoth, as the GRA of blessed memory wrote in Sh'noth Eliyahu (Peah 1:1) in the name of the Yerushalmi. If so, the cheshbon comes to many thousands of holy words of Torah, each one of which is a great mitzvah in itself, that we have actively nullified, and against them, many thousands of transgressions of neglect of the positive commandment of Torah study that we have committed at that very time!<br> And how much more grievous is the sin if at the very time that one separates himself form Torah, he speaks lashon hara and the like. For with every demeaning remark that he makes against his friend, he transgresses a [distinct] negative commandment in itself, as mentioned in Makkoth 20b and in the name of Rabbeinu Yonah above. So that if we come to reckon only the transgression of separation from Torah for every moment of lashon hara, several hundreds of [transgressions of] negative and positive commandments are added thereto. And how much more so, when we add to this [the transgression of] many other negative and positive commandments that we have expatiated upon until now. One must, therefore, keep himself from the recital of such vanities! ",
                "(13) And all this that we have discussed until now applies even when he speaks [lashon hara] about his friend that is true; but if within his lashon hara or rechiluth there becomes intermixed something which is partially false, he also transgresses a positive commandment of the Torah, viz. (Shemoth 23:7): \"From a thing of falsehood keep far.\" And his name [i.e., his classification] also changes for the worse thereby, his now being called \"motzi shem ra\" (\"the spreader of a bad name\"). And his punishment is far more severe than that for the speaker of lashon hara and rechiluth in general. ",
                "(14) It also is apparent that [in all eight modes] he also transgresses (Devarim 28:9): \"And you shall walk in His ways,\" whereby we have been commanded to emulate the traits of the Holy One Blessed be He, all of which [traits] are for the good alone, as Chazal have said (Shabbath 133b): \"Just as He is merciful, you, too, be merciful; just as He is gracious, you, too, be gracious,\" and the like with the other good traits, as is explained by the Rambam (Hilchoth Deoth 1:5 and 6). And we find with the Holy One Blessed be He, in His pure and holy traits, that He hates delation [informing] in all modes, even against the most reprehensible of men, as Chazal have said in the episode of Achan [viz. Joshua 7] (Sanhedrin 11a): \"Am I [the L–rd] a delator for you?\" And He hopes for the good and not for the bad (viz. Tanna d'bei Eliyahu 1), and (Sotah 42a): \"Four classes do not behold the Divine Presence: …the class of the speakers of lashon hara, as it is written (Tehillim 5:5): 'For You are not a G–d who desires wickedness, evil shall not dwell with You.'\" Therefore, one who habituates himself to this evil trait does not walk in the way of the L–rd, which is only to do good to others, and he does the opposite — wherefore the Torah designated [lashon hara] as \"evil\" — so that he also transgresses this positive commandment [i.e., \"And you shall walk in His ways.\"] <br>We have thus enumerated fourteen positive commandments, which tend to be transgressed by lashon hara and rechiluth (aside from the aforementioned seventeen negative commandments). And though all the seventeen negative commandments and fourteen positive commandments cannot obtain with one man and with one slur, as is clear to the reader, still, all who are habituated, G–d forbid, to this evil trait will certainly transgress all of them in the course of time. For sometimes he will come to speak lashon hara against an elder, and sometimes, against a sage. And sometimes he will demean him to his face and sometimes not to his face, as mentioned above. "
            ],
            "Curses": [
                "And now we shall explain, with the help of the L–rd, what we projected in the beginning, to detail how many arurin he who does not guard himself against this evil trait beings upon himself. (1) Aside from all the aforementioned negative and positive commandments, he transgresses (Devarim 27:24): \"Cursed be he who smites his neighbor in secret,\" which refers to lashon hara, as we find in Sifrei and in Rashi's commentary on Chumash. ",
                "(2) He also transgresses (Devarim 27:18): \"Cursed is he who misleads the blind man on the way,\" it being known that the intent of Scripture is to curse one who places a stumbling-block before another so that an issur be committed by him, as in the negative commandment (Vayikra 19:14): \"And before the blind man do not place a stumbling-block,\" which we have already explained (Negative Commandments 4) as also falling into this category. ",
                "(3) And if (G–d forbid) this matter becomes hefker [inconsequential] to him, so that he does not take it upon himself to guard himself from it, he transgresses further a third arur (Devarim 27:26): \"Cursed is he who does not fulfill the words of this Torah to do them,\" which is understood as his not accepting it upon himself to fulfill the entire Torah. And he is called a \"mumar [heretic] in respect to one thing\" because of this — gratuitously transgressing this grave issur, regarding this article of the Torah of the L–rd as hefker — being like any other \"mumar in respect to the entire Torah.\" Therefore, his sin is too great to forgive. We have thus enumerated three arurin which are often attendant upon this evil trait. ",
                "(And if, G–d forbid, the lashon hara were against his father and mother, he also transgresses a fourth arur (Ibid 16): \"Cursed is he who demeans his father and his mother,\" which we have already explained above (Positive Commandment 14) in the Mekor Hachaim and in the Be'er Mayim Chayim.) ",

And very often it leads to levity and to other evil traits of the kind. Therefore, form all the words of this introduction, from which we can understand the greatness of the harm wrought by lashon hara and rechiluth, the Torah has explicitly delineated this issur, assigning to it a distinct negative commandment (viz. Vayikra 19:16): \"Do not go talebearing among your people\" more than any of the other evil traits, as we have written in the beginning of our introduction; and the Introduction is hereby completed.

And, of a certainty, they have guarded themselves form this base trait to its very end, wherefore their words make a deep impress on the hearts of their readers. And let the reader also know that I have not selected the negative and positive commandments fortuitously, but I carefully probed and expounded the 613 mitzvoth, and much did I toil until the Holy One Blessed be He helped me find those [commandments] relevant to our subject.

To this, too, I \"opened my eyes,\" and because of this I copied the responsum of the Chavoth Yair that appears at the end of the book. And, in the book itself, I also resolved many [seemingly contradictory] citations, a little here, a little there. "

For, in truth, we see it patently in many individuals, even (sometimes) in Torah scholars, that they do not regard these evil traits as such a grave issur — as they are, indeed, in truth, to those who contemplate them in Scripture and in the words of Chazal — but only as something not quite appropriate. And perhaps this sinner, too, is of this mind. And if he knew the true gravity of the issur, it is possible that he would exert all of his powers not to transgress them (viz. Shabbath 69a): \"If he [the sinner] were \"unwitting\" [shogeg] relative to kareth [\"cutting- off\"], (i.e., if he did not know that the sin were punishable by the grave penalty of kareth, and he were \"witting\" relative to [having transgressed] a negative commandment, his act is called \"unwitting\" [in that he is not aware of its full gravity]). To the contrary, if one sees that he [the sinner] is habituated to one of these evil traits, he should reprove him and impress upon him the gravity of the issur. And in this he would be fulfilling the positive commandment of \"Reprove shall you reprove your fellow.\" And it is possible that he would admit that he was doing wrong, but that at the time his way was just in his eyes, viz. (Mishlei 21:2): \"A man's every way is just in his eyes.\" Therefore, it is forbidden to perceive him as \"wicked\" and to go and speak [demeaningly] of him. "

For the root of the Torah's exhortation against lashon hara, even when [what is said] is true, applies when one's intent is to shame his friend and to rejoice in his shame. But if his intent is to guard his friend against learning from his [the sinner's] ways, it is obviously permitted, and is also accounted a mitzvah.

Even though they may tell him something negative about him, still it is permitted, since his intent is for his own good alone, so that he will not come afterwards to injury or to strife or to contention and desecration of the Name, G–d forbid.

But if he does not apprise his friend of the reason for his inquiry, but makes himself \"as a stranger\" [to the subject of his inquiry] so that he come to know better the character of that man [inquired about], it seems obvious that he will be in transgression of \"Before a blind man, etc.\"; for through him his friend [the answerer] will perform an issur if he speaks derogatory things about him, even if they be true, as we have explained elsewhere.

And now in these sections, we shall speak of the greater part of its components, where there is nothing to say on behalf of the speaker, when he intends no benefit, but only to speak demeaningly of his friend. The stumbling-block here is more prevalent, almost everybody stumbling into it — and only because of insufficiency of knowledge. I shall, therefore, ask that it not be cause for wonder in the eyes of the reader that I expatiate upon it and mention every detail explicitly. For I [venture to] think that perhaps the L–rd will grant that through this, part of this great stumbling-block will be removed. ",

I shall explain my meaning in all of its details: \"wisdom\" — telling people that Ploni is not wise. And there is no difference here as to whether it is false or partially true and he exaggerates the actuality. — This is certainly a great sin, in the order of \"spreading an evil report.\" For he demeans his friend by his falsehoods. — But even if it is the absolute truth, have not all the Rishonim \"rooted it within us\" that lashon hara [is forbidden] even if true! (See Principle I.) And this thing, negating one's possession of a certain eminence, is certainly also in the category of lashon hara. For did the Rambam not write (Avoth 1:17): \"Lashon hara is relating one's evils and his blemishes and demeaning a Jew in any way, even if the demeaned one were [indeed] deficient, etc.\" As he expatiates there, it is called lashon hara if what he says about him is true. (See also what the Rambam has written in Hilchoth Deoth 7:5 to the effect that lashon hara is something, which when it becomes known to men, causes someone to be harmed in his body or in his money or to aggrieve him or to frighten him.) It seems clear, then, that negating one's possession of a certain eminence is absolute lashon hara according to the Torah. For upon reflection we find that this can result in monetary loss or grief, etc. ",
                        "First we shall explain what we are dealing with now, one's saying about another that he is not wise. For, in truth, there is no [attribution of] deficiency greater than this. For if he were not yet married, if this [lashon hara] were known to people, no one would be found who would want to make a match with him. And if he had an occupation, then whatever occupation he had, whether he were a craftsman or a teacher, who would want to join him in his affairs? And especially if he were a teacher of Law in Israel [i.e., a posek] and one said about him to people that he were not wise, then aside from this being an issur of lashon hara according to the Torah (for certainly, if this were accepted by the hearers and publicized in the city, he would be caused a monetary loss, for no one would want to go to him for din or pesharah [compromise), [aside from this], ",

In addition to this, he greatly demeans thereby the honor of the Torah and its learners and is called \"the shamer of a Torah scholar,\" about which Chazal have said that \"there is no healing for his wound.\" And through this [lashon hara] there will greatly decline the fulfillment of Torah; for if the Rabbi exhorts them thereafter concerning a certain mitzvah in the Torah, they will pay no attention to his words, his having already been publicized in their eyes by the men of lashon hara as a man who is not wise.

Look into yourself: If it were known to you of a certainty that one publicized about you that you were not wise (and the like in the area of negation of eminence), how resentful you would be of him for this! You would think: \"What signs of folly did he see in me? He is nothing other than an evil-hearted person and a speaker of lashon hara, whose desire is only to demean his friend and to degrade him!\" And yet, when you yourself do this to your friend, who in many things is much better than you to the L–rd and to people, you do not see this as a sin at all! See the great blindness in this! And, in truth, when you reflect upon this, you will find in this instance of the varieties of the issur of lashon hara many more [elements] than in the others. This is so because in other instances of his saying about his friend that he transgressed an issur both in the area of \"between man and his Maker\" or in the area of \"between man and his neighbor,\" it very often happens that his sole intent is zeal for the L–rd. And though this is of no avail for the din [it still being considered lashon hara (viz. Principle IV, section 2, and also section 1), still his intent was not for evil; as opposed to this instance, where his sole intent was to demean his friend and degrade him, an egregiously bad trait, as explained in the Sha'arei Teshuvah of Rabbeinu Yonah. And also, in terms of the hearer. For in the other aforementioned instances of lashon hara, his [the speaker's] words are not immediately accepted. And, of a certainty, many listeners will say: \"So long as we do not see it with our own eyes, we will not believe it. And certainly, in what you have said, even if it is true, there must have been some mitigating circumstances which led him to act in this manner, for, as it was told, we cannot believe such things of him.\" And if it develops afterwards that what he said is false, the speaker will be an object of scorn and shame to all, for having spread a false report of his friend. But in this instance, if he degrades his friend and publicizes him as a fool and a simpleton to all, as a result of which all the townspeople will make him an object of shame and scorn, it often happens, in our many sins, that not one of the hearers will say: \"Speak less and pity the honor of Israel. Why do you have to shame him so much!\" — as if the speaker had done no wrong thereby. And of such a speaker it is said (Mishlei 30:20): \"She ate and wiped her mouth and said: 'I have done no wrong.'\" "

How much more so, if he said about one whom the people of the city thought to be wise in Torah, that he is not so wise, and that he knows but little in Torah, and through this they come to think less of him. Certainly this is in the category of lashon hara, even if true, since his intent is not for benefit but only to lower his friend in the esteem of the hearers. For through this, on whichever level he stands, this can cause him harm, or, in any event, distress. I will provide two illustrations. If one says about the city Rabbi before the people of the city that he is not very wise in Torah, but that he knows a little of the halachic rulings that are needed in practice — even if this be true, it is absolute lashon hara according to the Torah. For by this, he completely lowers his honor and undermines his very livelihood, and decreases thereby the honor of the Torah and the fulfillment of its mitzvoth (as mentioned in section 2). The same applies if he says the like about one who was recently married in the city. For certainly his honor will fall in the end in the eyes of his in-laws and of the members of his household when it becomes known to them that he is of little consequence in the city. And there is no greater harm and pain than this and the like. It is difficult for me to illustrate everything, but, \"Give to the wise and he will wax yet wiser\" (Mishlei 9:9). For I have come only to arouse, and the wise man will understand all by himself. And know also that the same applies if he says about a worker that he is not a good worker. This, too, is absolute lashon hara, for here, too, all the aforementioned considerations apply. (And if in this and all the other instances that we have spoken of, his intent is not to demean, but only to derive some benefit, this will be discussed, the L–rd willing, in Principle IX of the laws of rechiluth.)

If, according to the circumstances, he can be harmed by this, as when he is a day-laborer or a teacher (and there are many of this kind), then certainly what he says is in the category of lashon hara.

This, too, is in the category of lashon hara. For certainly, if this becomes public knowledge, he will not thereafter find anyone to extend him credit, and this will cause him harm and great distress, and it will threaten his very livelihood. And, over all, the man of heart must certainly take care (if he intends no [particular] benefit), that there not result from this any harm to the one spoken about.

So that it is quite possible for one to say the same thing about two people and to be praising the one and speaking lashon hara of the other. For example, if he says about someone, whose sustenance is provided by others and who has no problems of a livelihood, that he learns [Torah] about three or four hours a day, he would be demeaning him greatly and would be guilty of lashon hara. But if he said the very same thing about one who toils for a living, this would be great praise. And the same applies to other instances of positive commandments, such as that of honoring the Sabbath. So that if he said about one of the poor townsmen that he spends this and this much [(a substantial sum for him)] to honor the holy Sabbath, this is great praise for him. But if he said the very same thing about one who was considered a wealthy man, it would be very demeaning to him, and he would be scorned by men because of this; and he [the speaker] would be guilty of lashon hara.

What is praise to the one, is insult to the other. And thus with [mitzvoth] between man and his neighbor. If it be said about a mediocre person that he conducts himself in such and such a manner with his employees, it would not be demeaning to him. But if the very same thing is said about a man of eminence in Israel, it would be demeaning to him (and thus in all similar instances). Therefore, it is very difficult to include in a book all of the instances in which one can fall prey to lashon hara. But make the words of the Rambam (Hilchot Deoth 7) \"a crown to your head,\" and remember them always: that anything which, when publicized, can cause his friend physical harm, or monetary loss, or pain, or fright is lashon hara.

What have I said about him?\" That he learns Torah only three or four hours a day? Am I commanded to love him more than I love myself? Would that they said about me that I learned Torah three or four hours a day!\" And the same with charity, Shabbath expenses, and the like. In truth, this is a mistake, for the intent of the Gemara in \"All that is hateful to you\" is \"All that would be hateful to you if you were on his level.\" And, in truth, this is dependent upon the person that is spoken of, and the place and the time.

Even though this may not avail to justify his friend — if, in any event, by the hearers' knowing of this detail in his favor, he would not be so greatly demeaned before them and by their not knowing of it, he would be greatly demeaned before them, it would be a great issur to omit this detail.

Know that the entire heter that we wrote about in section 1 obtains only if the man to whom he would reveal the story did not yet consummate the partnership with the other, but only agreed to do so. But if it were consummated (by each according to his circumstances, as explained by the poskim, in such a manner as to forbid their retraction thereafter), [the din] depends in this: if he [the prospective revealer] knows that by revealing what he knows about the man, the other would harm him in no way, but only guard himself so that from now on no harm would befall him, and all the conditions set down in section 2 were also met, then it would be proper to do so [i.e., to reveal it]. But if he knew the nature of the man to whom he would tell it, to be such that as soon as he heard it he would believe it implicitly (either because it is his nature to believe such things immediately of his neighbor, or because there are \"indications\" [pointing to the truth of the revelation], or because he relies on him [the teller] implicitly), and he would immediately rule for himself and take action, i.e., withdraw from his agreement or do him some other injury, then even if he would not do anything worse than the din that beth-din would pronounce if two witnesses testified in beth-din according to his [the revealer's] words, still, it is forbidden [to reveal it]. For by his revealing it he does harm to the man [he speaks about], as would not be the case even if he testified about him in beth-din. For even if he said the very same thing in beth-din, beth-din could not impose upon him monetary payment according to his testimony, his being a single witness, [whose testimony is not accepted.] And now [if he revealed it] he would cause him real harm by doing so. And, according to this, if the tellers of the thing were two, who themselves witnessed it, it would seem to be permitted [for them to reveal it]. For their intent is only to rescue the hearer from harm and also not to cause [the other], by their revelation, more than accords with the din. (For if they see that by revealing it he [the hearer] would cause the other harm, which even beth-din would not impose upon their testimony, they have no advantage over a single witness, and it certainly would be forbidden for them to reveal it.)

But he who looks into it should know that there are in this din many details, which we shall explain below; and he must take all of them into consideration before he permits this to himself. He should also not deduce leniencies for himself from one situation to another. And before we begin to explain this din in all its details, we shall attempt to remove the common stumbling locks in this area (though, to speak the truth, there is no need to mention them in a book, for they are very obvious and require neither learning nor reasoning). But because of the great harm wrought by them and because they are regarded as permitted by many individuals, I have been constrained to explain the great deception of \"the men of the tongue\" in this regard.

                "Great care must be taken to avoid those base traits which cause one party [to the shidduch] to be demeaned before the second party for completely insubstantial things. So that [for example] if the [prospective] groom were an innocent person, who was not so sharp as to understand the subtleties of men and their deceits, or who did not want to engage in levity like the other youths of his age, he is immediately publicized in the city as a fool and a simpleton, so that sometimes this will be a reason for others not to want to make a match with him, or to break the match that they have already made, and many other such wrongs (May the L–rd cut off such \"slippery lips\" for this!) For it does not suffice them that they are in the category of \"men of lashon hara\" because of this — for in these words of vanity and their like there is not found even one particular of those mentioned in Principle IX, section 2 — but the Torah even calls them \"spreaders of false reports\" because what they say is false, as we have written in Part One, Principle I, and in Principle V on this subject. And even if what they said were the absolute truth, it would require all of the aforementioned conditions. ",

For because of this evil nature of theirs, whereby they hasten to mock people and to pour out shame and disgrace upon them they compel men who are pure and just in their hearts to follow in their paths — in the beginning, by force, so that those scoffers and \"men of the tongue\" not publicize them as fools and simpletons or brand them as \"hypocrites,\" and then, as a matter of course, they are dragged after them, for \"habit becomes nature.\" And, as per the well known dictum in the Gemara (Avodah Zarah 18b on Psalms 1:1): \"If he goes [with the scoffers], he is destined to stand [with them], and if he stands [with them], he is destined to sit [with them].\"...",

For their feet run to evil, etc.'\" And Chazal have said in Eduyoth 5:6: \"Better that a man be called a fool all of his days and not be wicked one moment before the L–rd.\" \"called a fool\" is stated because of the matter discussed there; but in truth, it befits a man to commit folly, even actively, so that the epithet \"wicked\" not apply to him, even for one moment, above. As we find in Scripture (viz. I Samuel 21:16) that David made himself [act] like a fool in the house of Avimelech so that he not fall into his hands. How much more so [should one follow this stratagem if necessary] for the sake of the King of kings, the Holy One Blessed be He! And (Chullin 5b): \"(Psalms 36:7): 'Man and beast do You save, O L–rd' – these are men who are wise in knowledge, but who make themselves [act foolish] like a beast [for the sake of the L–rd].\" And see Berachoth 19b: \"If one finds sha'atnez in his garment, etc.\" ",

For there is a difference between the defects. That is, if the defect is in respect to a bodily ill that the father of the [prospective] bride is unaware of, it being something internal that is not revealed to all, it is obvious that the one who reveals this is not suspect of any issur of rechiluth (so long as none of the conditions mentioned in Principle IX, section 2 are lacking. And I have explained them here in the Be'er Mayim Chayim.) ",

For, in general, one should not hasten to permit this. For our eyes see that many of them do not honor their commitments, and if so, the phenomenon of \"cheating\" does not apply here. For just as the groom [to be] deceives the father-in-law [to be], so does the father-in-law deceive him, and they end off \"equals.\" And, aside from all this, here, too, all of the conditions mentioned in Principle IX, section 2 must be satisfied.)
