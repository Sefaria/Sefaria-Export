            "It is forbidden to speak of another person’s disgrace, even if it is absolutely true. In all cases our Sages classified this as Lashon Hara [gossip; literally ‘the evil tongue’].    (If there is also some mixture of falsehood in what he speaks, and due to the lie the victim’s disgrace is worsened, it is classified as Motzi Shem Ra [slander; literally ‘bringing out an evil name’]. This is a much greater sin.)    Someone who speaks this way transgresses a negative prohibition, as it says “Do not go as a talebearer amongst your nation,” (Leviticus 19:16) since the definition of R’chilus [talebearing; literally ‘peddling’] includes this type of speech.", 
            "The Torah specified this particular negative commandment to refer to the prohibition of Lashon Hara and R’chilus, but even without it there are many other negative and positive commandments which he transgresses with this evil speech, as we brought in the preceding foreword. See there for elaboration.", 
            "This applies even to an isolated incident when he spoke of someone else’s disgrace, but if he constantly habituates himself in this sin, G-d forbid, like people whose habit is always to sit and say “this is what Reuven did...”, or “this is what Reuven’s ancestors did...”, or “this is what I heard about him...” and they are disgraceful issues, our Sages called people like that Baalei Lashon Hara [masters of Lashon Hara]. Their punishment is very much greater, since with contempt they wilfully transgress the Torah of G-d and act as if the commandment has no significance for them, as we explained at the end of the foreword. Regarding them it states in our tradition: “G-d will cut off all the smooth lips, the tongue speaking boastfully” (Psalms 12:4).", 
            "Our Sages have said: “For three sins retribution will be taken from a person in this world, and in addition he has no portion in the world to come. They are Idol-Worship, Immoral Relations, and Bloodshed, and Lashon Hara outweighs them all.” The Sages support this declaration with proofs from various verses. The Rishonim [primary commentators] explain their meaning as referring to those who are constantly habituated in this sin and refuse to restrain themselves because they regard it as acceptable.", 
            "The prohibition of such speech makes no distinction between where he speaks wilfully on his own initiative and where someone else verbally forces him, urging him insistently until he speaks; it remains forbidden in any case. Even if his father or Rabbi, whom he is obliged to honour and revere and never oppose their words, would ask him to relate a particular matter, where he knows that in his answer he will be forced to speak Lashon Hara, or even just Avak Lashon Hara [the dust of Lashon Hara], he is forbidden to obey them.", 
            "Even if he sees that if he accustoms himself to this quality of never speaking of another’s disgrace or other aspects of forbidden speech, it will cause him a great loss to his livelihood (for example, where he works for people who don’t have even the smell of Torah about them. It’s well known that these types of people are completely shameless in this severe sin, to the extent that if they see someone whose mouth is not as open as theirs they consider him an idiot and a fool. Because of this they will dismiss him from his job and he will have nothing to feed his family), nevertheless it is still forbidden. This is exactly the same as all other negative commandments in that he is obligated to give everything he owns in order not to transgress, as is explained in Yoreh Deah  [Code of Jewish Law]. See there for elaboration.", 
            "From here we can understand how much more so it is forbidden if only his honour is affected. For example, he is sitting amongst a group of people who are speaking speech forbidden by Jewish law but there is no way to avoid their company. When he sits silently and doesn’t contribute a word to their conversation they will consider him foolish, but it is certainly still forbidden. In this vein the Sages said: “Better for a person to be called a fool all his days than to be wicked for one moment before G-d.” While in that situation he must energise all his strength to restrain himself, but let his heart be assured that his reward for this from G-d is without limit, as the Sages say: “According to the struggle, so is the reward.” Further, it says in Avos d’Rabbi Natan  [Ethics of Rabbi Natan] “a hundred times with struggle rather than once with no struggle”. This means that the act of doing a mitzvah or restraint from doing a forbidden thing which comes through hardship is rewarded a hundred times more than a similar deed that comes through no difficulty. The statement of our Sages in the Midrash [traditional Torah exposition] is definitely applicable to such circumstances: “For each moment that a person keeps his mouth closed he merits a hidden light that no angel or other creation could even imagine”. Regarding what to do if you are caught in an evil gathering such as that, relating to correcting them or giving them credence, see chapter 6 following, sections 4, 5 and 6. Also relevant is note 16 in the section of the preface dealing with negative commandments.", 
            "The prohibition of Lashon Hara applies as much to speaking about him verbally as it does to writing about him in a letter. There is also no difference how he communicates the Lashon Hara –whether explicitly or by way of a hint – in all cases it is categorised as Lashon Hara.", 
            "You should also be aware that even if he, too, is disgraced by the very defamation with which he disgraces his fellow, and even if he mentions his own disgrace first, it remains defined as slander."

            "It is forbidden to speak Lashon Hara about someone even if it's true and even before just one person - how much more so before many people. As the number of listeners increases, so does the speaker's sin increase, because the victim is disgraced proportionately more by his shame being publicised before many people. Also, the speaker causes many people to stumble in the sin of listening to Lashon Hara (all halachic deciders agree on this).", 
            "That which we find in the words of our Sages - permission to speak Lashon Hara ‘in front of three people’ - has limited scope. It applies to a matter which is not fundamentally disgraceful, and where the description has two possible interpretations. Such interpretation depends on the particular speech uttered at the time by the speaker. It is solely in these circumstances that the Sages permitted speaking Lashon Hara ‘in front of three people’. It relies on the principle that by speaking before three people his words will definitely reach the subject’s ears, because your friend has a friend who has friend and so on. Therefore when he speaks he will take care to speak in a manner where no disgrace can be inferred. (Let us describe one case, and from there we can extrapolate to all similar cases. For example, they ask him “Where can we find fire [food being prepared]?” and he answers “You’ll find it over there – they’re always cooking meat and fish.” The categorisation of his reply depends on how he speaks. If he wants to he can convey this in a language that implies no disgrace to his friend, because truthfully there may be no wrongdoing involved. For example, he has a large household and G-d has helped him to acquire wealth, or he has developed a reputation as a generous host to visitors, or a similar scenario. He asks him “Where can I find fire?” and he answers him “Right now you won’t find fire anywhere but Reuven’s house because they prepare food constantly there,” with his intention as we have said. All such cases related to Avak Lashon Hara [the dust of Lashon Hara] depend on the way he spoke. However, if he said it with an inflection and tone which shows his meaning is that he constantly throws parties, even though this is not wholly disgraceful, nonetheless our Sages called it Avak Lashon Hara and it is forbidden to say even ‘in front of three people’.)", 
            "An alternative interpretation of the permission applies it to where a person has already related a disgraceful thing about someone ‘in front of three people’. Even though the speaker himself definitely transgressed the prohibition of Lashon Hara as we have said, nevertheless if one of those three who heard him speak would afterwards repeat it to others they would not transgress thereby the prohibition of Lashon Hara. The rationale is that once three people know of something, it’s effectively considered disseminated and known to everyone, because your friend has a friend who has friend and so on, and the Torah did not forbid on account of Lashon Hara something which is meant to be public knowledge. However, he only escapes the prohibition of Lashon Hara if he relates what he heard by the way, but not if he intends to publicise and spread it further. <i>Note: Some restrict it further, that even incidentally it is only permissible to relate the matter in passing without specifically intending to speak about it alone. </i> Furthermore, even if he didn't mention who said it originally, but said only that we heard such-and-such about the person, nonetheless it does not escape being classified as Lashon Hara.", 
            "Even the circumstances that we permitted, where his intention was not to publicise it further, are applicable solely to the initial listener who personally heard Reuven speak about Shimon ‘in front of three people’. However, someone who in turn heard it from him [the original audience] is forbidden to go thereafter, on the basis that he told him he heard it ‘in front of three people’, and relate to someone else the disgrace he was told about Shimon, even without telling who was the instigator of this slur about Shimon, unless the matter is already wholly publicised and known to all. It goes without saying that if the second listener does not know for himself whether the substance of the episode is true, that Reuven spoke disgracefully of Shimon - certainly he could not believe him that Reuven transgressed the prohibition of Lashon Hara. But even if he knows independently that Reuven spoke of the disgrace of Shimon, but he did not know if it was ‘in front of three people’ and this first listener revealed to him that indeed it was, nonetheless it is forbidden to rely on his words in this. We have to suspect that possibly it wasn't ‘in front of three people’ and was not intended to be publicised, and it is therefore forbidden for him to tell to any other person.", 
            "It appears to me that if the speech ‘in front of three people’ was before people who fear G-d, who are careful with prohibitions of Lashon Hara, then necessarily the matter was not made to be publicised, and if so it is forbidden from the Torah to tell the matter thereafter to another. Even if only one of the three were a G-d-fearing man who is careful with the prohibition of Lashon Hara, the law is the same because there are no longer three who will publicise. Also, it’s possible that the law is the same if one of the three were a close relative or friend of the one about whom the slander was said; the same reasoning can be applied because he would certainly never go and expose to the world his friend or relative’s disgrace, and if so there are no longer three.", 
            "It further appears to me that specifically in the same city where the matter was heard ‘in front of three people’, only there is it permitted to divulge, because your friend has a friend and so on, but not in any other city, even if traffic is common between them. See Be’er Mayim Chayim.", 
            "If the speaker specifically instructed the listeners not to make it public, then even if he was speaking to a large audience the label of Lashon Hara would still apply to the one who publicises it afterwards, even in passing. Even if he sees that one or two of the listeners did not heed the instruction and did reveal it to others, nonetheless this third person may not spread the matter to others even by the way. See Be’er Mayim Chayim.", 
            "It makes no difference what language he used to warn them not to publicise - whether he told them never to speak of the matter again, or whether he said that no one should ever learn anything about this from them. In all cases it is forbidden to make the disgrace known to another, and all the more so to the one who was spoken about, because by spreading it to another it will be spread in the end to everybody, and even to the subject, because your friend has a friend. <i>Note: But if he instructed them only that the subject must not find out, it may possibly be permissible to reveal it in passing to another. Even though the prohibitions of Lashon Hara and R’chilus apply sans any warning from the speaker, that is where it was not said before three. But where the language of the warning did not preclude publicising it to others, then ultimately it is a matter meant to be publicised and the Torah did not forbid it as Lashon Hara, so long as his intention was not to spread it. This needs further consideration. </i> It also seems obvious that the permission applies only where there is an audience of three, excluding the case of two speaking before two, where it would not apply at all. See B’er Mayim Chayim.", 
            "The permission we have discussed up until now applies to the prohibition of repeating what the speaker said, but G-d forbid to add even one extra word, or to emphasise the matter to the listener - to say that the issue said about Shimon is fitting to be said about him, or similar things - this is definitely forbidden in every case, because he disgraces the subject more than would have been heard about eventually according to the rationale of your friend has a friend. Further, by this he confirms that he has accepted the matter as truth, and everyone agrees this is forbidden in all circumstances, as we will explain with the help of Hashem later in Chapter 7 Section 1, see there. Therefore one must be very circumspect even if it is well known about some person a particular evil deed which he did in his youth, but from then until now he has acted properly and has not remained on that path, and any similar case where in truth there he is not sinning, it is forbidden to disgrace and disrespect him to his friends because of it. Someone who transgresses this and speaks of these matters before people, even if not before the subject, in order to disgrace him in the eyes of his community, even if he adds nothing to the truth, he is included in the faction of the speakers of Lashon Hara who do not greet the face of the Sh’chinah [presence of Hashem] as it writes in “Shaarei T’shuvah”, discourse 214. The permission of ‘before three’ does not apply to this case whatsoever, even though the matter is well-known before all, since in truth no disgrace applies to him [presently], as it writes in Yechezkel (18:20): “A son will not bear the sin of the father,… all his transgressions which he did will not be remembered…” and he makes him because of it a mockery before people.", 
            "You should know further that this entire permission of ‘before three’ is only with regard to the speaker [from the original audience] – but with regard to the listener, if you know that his nature is to immediately accept what he hears about Shimon as true, and he may possibly inflate derogatory details about him – to a person like that it is forbidden to say any hint of disgrace about his fellow in any manner. The one who speaks to him transgresses “Do not put a stumbling block before the blind” (Leviticus 19:14), as we elaborated previously in the introduction on that negative commandment (Note 4), see there. All this that we described in this Chapter as forbidden applies even if he did not mention the name of the original speaker who spoke before three, and related only that such-and-such was heard about Ploni, it is nonetheless forbidden. Now that we have clarified the truth and all these details, see my brother how much you should distance yourself from this leniency, which has almost no practical application. Specifically, that even if you could happen to combine all the details, you also need to investigate whether the Halacha is fixed like that opinion, since according to the opinion of many Halachic deciders there is no source for this leniency in all of the Talmud (as we wrote at the end of paragraph 8 in B’er Mayim Chayim). Therefore one who guards his soul will distance himself from it.", 
            "Take note, too, that according to the principles of ‘before three’ which we explained with the help of Hashem, one needs to be careful when the representatives of the city sit to consider a matter of governance of the population – in an issue of valuation or such-like where there is a benefit to one and a loss to another – and they differ in their assessments, and it falls to a vote, and they proceed after the majority, that when they leave the council room they each need to be very careful not to speak of his or another councilor's original assessment, that it was in favour of a particular person but his colleagues outvoted him and compelled him to follow the majority. It goes without saying that this applies where they agreed from the start that once they left the room they would not publicise the internal doings of the council to the affected party, certainly it is forbidden, but even without specifying confidentiality, and even where there was no intention to publicise, but just in passing he discusses it with someone else in a manner where it is implied from his speech that he does not agree with the conclusion even now but he can't contend with his disputing colleagues, that too is entirely forbidden. (What's more, according to the opinion of the Yad Hakatanah, even if he said simply that originally his opinion was in favour of that person, whereupon they voted and concluded like the majority, that too is forbidden.) It further makes no difference whether he said these comments on his own intitative or the person pressured him with insults regarding the decision they reached about the litigants. In all cases it remains forbidden to place the onus on his colleague and remove it from himself, even if it is true.", 
            "I further see fit to write about one matter explicitly because it is apparent to me that many people make it a habit. That is when someone gives an address in the Study Hall it is forbidden according to Jewish Law to deride him about it and to say there is no substance to his lecture and nothing to learn from it. Due to our many sins we see that many people are shameless about this practice and don’t consider such scorn to be forbidden at all, whereas according to Jewish Law it is pure Lashon Hara. Due to this kind of talk it is common to cause financial damage to others, and often pain and embarrassment as well. If it were only true, still Lashon Hara is forbidden even about true things. What possible benefit could the slanderer and mocker intend with his mockery? If indeed he were a master of his own Soul, then on the contrary he would counsel him in private and elaborate how he should speak in a different manner because in his current manner of speaking his words will not be heeded. Through this advice he would fulfil too the commandment of ‘Love your neighbour as yourself’, but at the very least he should not make him an object of scorn before others. The permission of ‘before three’ does not help in this case as I explained at length in B’er Mayim Chayim.", 
            "If someone revealed to his friend before three people an aspect of his business or his trade, or something along those lines, which under normal circumstances is privileged and forbidden thereafter to reveal to others lest he come to financial damage or anguish, except that now he revealed to him this issue before three people - then we see he is not concerned about it even if it ultimately becomes public knowledge. Therefore it is permitted for the listener without reservation to reveal it to others, so long as he gives no indication that he is indeed concerned about it. Still, he may not omit any details explained previously regarding something spoken ‘before three’. See B’er Mayim Chayim."

            "How great is the prohibition of Lashon Hara! The Torah forbade it even about something factual and in every circumstance. It goes without saying where he restrains himself to speak about him in secret and takes pains that it should not be revealed to him that it is forbidden. By acting this way he accepts on himself  a curse, as it writes \"Cursed is one who strikes his friend in secret\" (Deuteronomy 27:24). But even if he assesses in his mind that he would still say this to his face, or he says the Lashon Hara about his friend literally to his face, that too is called Lashon Hara. In one respect his transgression is greater when it is to his face than when it is not. When it is to his face, then aside from the prohibition of Lashon Hara, he clothes himself thus with the characteristics of brazenness and impudence, and evokes great judgement on himself by this. Many times he comes due to this also into the hands of shaming others, as we elaborated earlier in the Introduction about the prohibition of 'Do not bear sin because of him' (Leviticus 19:17), see there.", 
            "This that we sometimes find permission in the words of our Sages to speak Lashon Hara if he would not withhold himself from saying it to his face, that is applicable specifically to the 'dust of Lashon Hara' where he uses language which could be interpreted in two different ways.", 
            "and see further how great the prohibition of Lashon Hora is that even [if] not spoken in the midst of hate and without intention to defame him [the person they are talking about], only they said it in a joking manner or levity, nevertheless, since it is really a speaking to shame [this individual who is spoken about], it is forbidden by the Torah."
