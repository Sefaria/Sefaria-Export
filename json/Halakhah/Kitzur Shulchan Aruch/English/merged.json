            "\"I have set Hashem before me always.\"<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Psalms</i> 16:8.</i> This is a fundamental rule of the Torah and of the attributes of the righteous who walk before God. For we cannot compare a person's lifestyle, his activities and affairs when he is alone, to his lifestyle, and activities and affairs when he is before a great king. Similarly, his conversation and speech when he is amongst family or relatives, [cannot be compared] to what they would be in the presence of a king, because then he would certainly take special care that all his activities and conversations be refined and correct. How much more so when you contemplate that Hashem, the greatest of kings, the Holy One, blessed is He, Whose glory fills the entire world, stands above you and views your actions, as it is said: \"If a person will hide in hidden places will I not see him? Says the word of Hashem, Do I not fill the heavens and the earth!\"<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Jeremiah</i> 23:24.</i> [Bearing this in mind] it is certain that you will immediately acquire a feeling of reverence and submissiveness for the awesomeness of Hashem, Blessed be He, and be ashamed [to sin] before Him.",
            "Also, while lying in bed you should realize before Whom you lay and as soon as you awaken you should remember the kindnesses of Hashem, Blessed be His Name, that were granted to you; that He returned your soul to you. You committed it to Him faint and weary and it was returned to you new and refreshed, enabling you to worship Hashem, Blessed be His Name, with all of your capacity and serve Him the entire day; because this is the essence of Man, as it is said in Scripture: \"They are new every morning how great is Your faithfulness.\"<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Lamentations</i> 3:23.</i> This verse teaches that every morning a person becomes a new creation, and he should give thanks with all his heart to Hashem, Blessed be His Name, for this (good fortune). While still in bed you should recite: I give thanks to You, living and everlasting King for You have restored my soul with mercy. Great is Your faithfulness. (Even though your hands are not yet clean, you may say this, since the name of Hashem is not mentioned.) You should pause slightly between the word <i>chemlah</i> \"with mercy,\" and the word, <i>rabbah</i> \"great.\"",
            "Yehudah son of Taima says: \"Be bold as a leopard, light as an eagle, swift as a deer and strong as a lion to do the will of your Father in heaven.\"<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Avos</i> 5:20.</i> \"Bold as a leopard\" means, you should not be ashamed before people who mock you for worshipping Hashem, Blessed be His Name. \"Light as an eagle\" refers to what the eye sees. This alludes to the requirement to be swift to close your eyes to prevent the seeing of evil because the sight of evil constitutes the beginning of sin. The eye sees and the heart desires and the organs capable of action culminate the sin. \"Swift as a deer\" refers to the legs, for your legs should run to do good things. \"Strong as a lion\" is a reference to the heart, because true valor in serving the Creator, Blessed is He, emanates from the heart. He also states: \"Strengthen your heart to serve Him, and overpower your evil inclination and defeat it as a hero triumphs over his enemy, defeating him, and casting him to the earth.\"",
            "Therefore, it is imperative for a person to be strong as a lion. Immediately upon awakening (and reciting the <i>Modeh Ani</i> prayer) you should rise with alacrity for the service of the Creator, Blessed and Elevated is He, before you are over-whelmed by your evil impulse with various excuses not to rise, and be outsmarted and seduced in the winter [with this argument]: \"How can you rise now so early in the morning when the weather is so cold?\" Or, in the summer it will argue: \"How can you rise from your bed while you are still not satisfied with enough sleep?\" or other similar claims. The evil impulse knows very well the art of entrapping a person with all kinds of snares to prevent him from rising. Therefore every sensitive person who fears and trembles before the word of Hashem must triumph over the evil impulse and not listen to it, even if it is extremely difficult because of physical considerations or laziness. Your aim must be to fulfill the will of the King of kings, the Holy One, Blessed be He. You should realize that if you were called by any individual to participate in a business transaction in which there is profit, or to collect a debt, or if someone called with a plan to save your wealth from disaster, for example, if a fire occurred in the city or something similar occurred, you certainly would be quick to awaken immediately because of your concern for your wealth and you would not act sluggishly. Similarly, if you would need to go to the service of the king you would rise with alacrity and not be sluggish lest you be denigrated. [Or you would rise with alacrity] in order to find favor in the eyes of the king. How much more so should this apply for the service of the King of kings, the Holy One, Blessed is He, that you should be concerned to rise quickly and with alacrity. Once you accustom yourself to this practice four or five times you will no longer find it difficult, [as our Sages have said:] \"He who makes an effort to purify himself is [Divinely] assisted in his efforts.\"<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Maseches Yoma</i> 38b.</i>",
            "If you are able to awaken and rise at midnight<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> somewhat before midnight.</i> to recite the prayer of <i>Tikun Chatzos</i><sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These are prayers lamenting the destruction of the holy Temple.</i> it is most praiseworthy, as it is said: \"Rise, cry out in the night at the peak of the night watches\" etc.<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Lamentations</i> 2:19.</i> For the Holy One, Blessed is He, [also] laments at that time, as it is said: \"Hashem from His high place cries, and from the Dwelling Place of His Holiness He sends forth His voice, as He cries for His Sanctuary.\"<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Jeremiah</i> 25:30.</i> And He says, \"Woe unto the children that on account of their sins I destroyed My house, and I burned My Sanctuary, and I exiled them among the nations.\"<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Maseches Berachos</i> 3a.</i> If you cannot rise at midnight, you should nevertheless exert yourself to rise before daybreak, as said King David, may he rest in peace, \"I will awaken the dawn,\"<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Psalms</i> 57:9.</i> [He meant] \"I awake the dawn but the dawn does not awaken me.\" You may recite <i>Tikun Chatzos,</i> even after midnight and then afterwards engage in Torah study according to your ability [or capacity]. A lesson in <i>Mishnah</i> is preferable to any other study, (and by so doing you will be worthy of [your] <i>neshamah</i> [soul] [as inferred from the word] <i>Mishnah</i> which has the same letters as <i>neshamah</i>.<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span>נְשָׁמֶה</span> - <span>מִשְׁנֶה</span></i> If you are not capable of this [studying <i>Mishnah</i>], you should recite Psalms and <i>Ma'amados</i><sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Various selections of Scripture and other sources.</i> and study works of ethics. A little learning or recitation with concentration is better than a great deal without concentration. Rabbi Chiyah taught: \"Whoever studies Torah at night the Divine Presence is before him, as it is said: \"Rise, cry out in the night at the peak of the night watches. Pour out your heart like water before the Presence of Hashem.\"<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Lamentations</i> 2:19.</i> This verse signifies that the Divine Presence is before us at that time. It was also said by our Sages, of blessed memory: \"Whoever studies Torah at night is called a servant of Hashem, as it is written: [Behold, Bless Hashem] all [you] <i>servants</i> of Hashem who stand in the House of Hashem, during the <i>nights</i>.\"<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Psalms</i> 134:1.</i> During the short nights when it is difficult to rise so early, you should at least endeavor to rise while there is sufficient time to prepare yourself to go to the synagogue to pray together with the congregation.",
            "Chapters of the Psalms, and other sections of the Torah, Prophets and Scriptures, in which all are not sufficiently fluent, must not be recited by heart. Even someone who knows [them sufficiently] to recite them by heart should be careful not to recite them by heart.<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> you may recite <i>Psalms</i> by heart, since it is similar to saying prayers.</i> However, a blind person may recite them by heart.",
            "We must object to the practice of those who recite the supplications of the <i>Ma'amodos</i> and conclude: \"Blessed are You Hashem, Who listens to prayer.\" Rather, the proper conclusion is: \"Blessed is the One Who listens to prayer,\" omitting the Name of Hashem. (See <i>Turei Zahav,</i> end of Chapter 131)."

            "When he arises from his bed in the morning a person is considered as a newly created being, to serve the Creator, Blessed be His Name. He, therefore, must sanctify himself and wash his hands from a vessel, [just] as a <i>Kohein</i> washed his hands each day from the special basin [located in the Temple] prior to his service. This washing is indicated in the Scripture as it is said: \"I will wash my hands in purity and I will encircle Your altar, Hashem, to proclaim a sound of thanks, etc.\"<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Psalms</i> 26:6,7.</i> There is also another reason for this washing. When man is asleep, his holy soul departs from him, and an unclean spirit comes and dwells upon his body. When he awakens from his sleep, the unclean spirit departs from his entire body except from his fingers, from which it does not depart until he pours water upon them three times alternately.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See paragraph 3 for exact procedure.</i> It is forbidden to walk a distance of four <i>amohs</i><sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is also forbidden to lie in bed without washing your hands. Within the house you may walk even more than four <i>amohs</i> to get water for washing. (See glossary for equivalent of <i>amah</i>.)</i> without washing the hands except in cases of extreme necessity.",
            "The first garment you should don<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is said for males only.</i> is the small <i>tallis</i><sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The four-cornered, fringed garment, known as <i>Arba Kanfos</i>.</i> in order not to walk four <i>amohs</i> without fulfilling the <i>mitzva</i> of <i>tzitzis</i>. However, since your hands are still unclean, you should not [yet] recite the berachah.",
            "The procedure for washing hands in the morning is as follows: take the vessel in your right hand and then place it in your left hand, and then first pour on the right hand; and then take the vessel in your right hand and pour upon the left hand. This procedure is repeated three times.<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Others say that you should follow this procedure a fourth time.</i> It is preferable to wash your hands until the wrist. However, in extreme circumstances it is sufficient to wash them until the knuckles. You should also wash your face in deference to the Creator, as it is said: \"For in the image of God He created Man.\"<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Genesis</i> 9:6.</i> You should also rinse your mouth because of the spittle in it, for you must pronounce the great Name [of God] in holiness and purity. After this dry your hands and be careful to dry your face well.",
            "The hands must be washed only into a vessel. It is forbidden to derive benefit from the water used for washing because of the foul spirit that rests upon it, and [therefore] you should pour it in a place where people do not walk.",
            "Before washing you should not touch your mouth or nose, your eyes or ears or anus, or food,<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is important, therefore, to see that even small children wash their hands in the proper manner. Nevertheless, food touched by those who have not washed their hands according to <i>halacha,</i> is not forbidden. See <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 4:14 and <i>Aruch HaShulchan</i> 4:15. Thus, it is permissible to buy bread and other things even though we are not sure that the bakers have washed their hands.</i> or the place where blood was let; because the foul spirit that rests upon the hands before washing is damaging to these things.",
            "It is preferable to be careful to wash your hands in the morning with water poured from a vessel with human effort, similar to the washing of hands before a meal (See Chapter 40). However, in extreme circumstances, where you do not have suitable water and you wish to pray, you may wash your hands from any [vessel], with any kind of water, even if the water is not poured with human effort, and you may still recite the berachah: <i>al netilas yadayim</i>.<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., “Upon washing the hands.”</i> If there is a river close by it is preferable to dip your hands in it three times, or even [to dip them] in snow. However, if there is no water at all you may wipe your hands on anything and recite the berachah, <i>al nekiyas yadayim</i>,<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., “Upon cleaning the hands,” but not the berachah “Upon washing the hands.”</i> and this is sufficient [preparation] for prayer. Afterwards, upon finding water and proper vessels you should wash your hands again properly, but without pronouncing an additional berachah.",
            "It is written: \"My soul, bless Hashem and all that is within me [bless] His holy Name.\"<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Psalms</i> 103:1.</i> It follows that since a person needs to bless God with all his innards, he is forbidden to recite the berachah until he cleans his intestines from excrement and urine. In the morning when a person awakens he probably has a need to relieve himself or at least to urinate; therefore he should not recite the berachah over the washing of the hands at the time of washing, but rather after he relieves himself. He then washes his hands again and then recites the berachah <i>al netilas yadayim,</i> and then the berachah of <i>asher yatzar,</i> followed by the <i>berachos</i> on the Torah and then the berachah of <i>Elokai neshamah</i>.<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to <i>Mishnah Berurah,</i> the berachah of <i>Elokai neshamah</i> should be said after the berachah of <i>Asher yatzar</i>.</i>",

You should, therefore, wash three times in the alternate manner (as mentioned in paragraph 3) but without reciting the berachah.<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to Rabbi Akiva Eiger, one who is up the entire night but goes to the lavatory to relieve himself during the night, should recite the berachah “<i>Al netilas yadayim</i>.” See <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (<i>Bi’ur Halachah</i>) 4:13.</i>",

Some hold that in today’s bathrooms it is permissible.

Thus when putting on or removing your shirt or any other garment from your body<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., undergarment.</i> you should be very careful not to uncover your body.

For example, the Talmud states:<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Maseches Sanhedrin</i> 74a.</i> that it is forbidden for a Jew to be similar to them even in regard to shoelaces; if their practice was to tie one way and the practice of Jews to tie another way, or if their practice was to wear red shoelaces and Jews wear black shoelaces because the color black indicates humility, submissiveness and modesty. [In all such instances] it is forbidden for a Jew to deviate. From these examples everyone should learn how to apply these standards to his time and place. A garment designed for showiness or immodesty must not be worn by a Jew, but rather his clothing should be made in a style which suggests humility and modesty. The following is mentioned in <i>Sifrei:</i> You should not say that since they go out with scarlet I shall go out with scarlet, since they go out with <i>kulsin</i> (the word <i>kulsin</i> meaning weaponry) I also shall go out with <i>kulsin,</i> because these practices are indicative of arrogance and haughtiness which are not the heritage of Jacob. Rather, our heritage demands of us to be modest and humble, and not be influenced by the haughty. Similarly, any custom or statute of which there is a suspicion of idolatrous intent or background should be avoided by Jews. Similarly, you should not cut your hair or style your hair as they do, but rather you should be distinct, in your clothing and speech and all other endeavors just as you are distinct in your perspectives and concepts. Similarly, it is said: \"I have set you apart from the nations.\"<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Leviticus</i> 20:26.</i>",

            "Since we find that the Torah gives deference to the right hand: in regard to service in the Temple<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The priest used his right hand when he performed the necessary sacrificial rituals such as the sprinking of the blood.</i> and in regard to the thumb and big toe referred to in the <i>milu'im</i><sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When Aaron and his sons were consecrated, blood was applied to their right thumbs and big toes.</i> and purification of the <i>metzora</i> and in the mitzvah of <i>chalitzah;</i><sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Deuteronomy</i> 25:5–10; <i>Maseches Yevamos</i> 104a.</i> therefore in dressing and in other activities you should begin with the right [hand or foot] as opposed to the left [hand or foot.] When removing shoes or other clothing you should first remove the left (because this shows respect for the right.) However, in regard to tying [a lace] the left is held in higher esteem because we tie the tefillin on the left [hand]. Therefore when you tie your shoes, you should first tie the left. For example, with shoes that must be tied, put on the right shoe without tying it, and then the left shoe and tie it, and then tie the right shoe. This also applies to other clothing.<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> this applies only to the shoes.</i>",

Also small children must be trained to cover their heads in order to encourage them to have reverence for God, as it is said of Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak: The mother of Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak was told by Coldai, (\"Coldai\" referring to astrologers), \"Your son will be a thief.\" [Upon hearing this] she did not permit him to uncover his head.

            "Before reciting a berachah you must be sure which berachah you are required to recite, so that when you mention Hashem's Name which is the principle part of the berachah, you will know how to conclude the berachah. It is forbidden to do anything else while reciting a berachah. Do not recite the berachah hurriedly but think of the meaning of the words. The <i>Sefer Chassidim</i> states: \"When you wash your hands or recite the berachah on fruit or on the performance of a mitzvah,—berachos which everybody knows— you should direct your attention to recite them in the Name of your Creator Whose goodness is bountiful, Who granted you the fruit or bread for your pleasure, or commanded you to perform the mitzvah. You should not recite the berachah automatically, out of habit, spouting words from your mouth without thinking of their meaning. On account of such practice Hashem's anger was kindled, and He sent us word through the prophet, Isaiah, saying: \"Because this people approaches [Me] [only] with their mouths and honor Me [only] with their lips and their heart is distant from Me and their reverence for Me is merely perfunctory.\"<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Isaiah</i> 29:13.</i> The Holy One Blessed is He said to Isaiah, See how the deeds of My children are merely external and they adhere to them [only] as a person adheres to and practices a custom of his forbearers; they enter My house and pray to Me the designated prayers merely as a custom of their fathers but not with their whole hearts. They wash their hands, and recite the berachah over the washing and then break bread and recite the <i>hamotzi,</i> they drink and recite the berachah out of habit. When they recite the berachos they have no real intention of praising Me. Therefore, His anger was fierce and He swore by His great Name to destroy the wisdom of their Sages who know Him and still praise Him perfunctorily, without sincerity as it is written thereafter: \"Therefore I shall do yet more … and the wisdom of their Sages will be lost.\"<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Isaiah</i> 29:14.</i> Therefore our Sages warned us regarding this and said: \"Fulfill [your] obligations for the sake of the Creator etc.\"<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Nedarim</i> 62A.</i> This concludes his [<i>Sefer Chassidim's</i>] remarks.

            "It is forbidden to utter the Name of God in vain. Whoever utters the Name of God in vain violates a positive commandment, as it is written: \"You shall fear Hashem, your God.\"<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Deuteronomy</i> 6:13.</i> It is also written: \"If you will not heed etc. to fear this glorious and awesome Name.\"<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Deuteronomy</i> 28:58.</i> Included in the concept of fear is not mentioning His great Name except in praise of Him or when reciting a berachah whenever required, or when studying Torah. You should fear and tremble when you mention the Name of Hashem, Blessed Be His Name, but you should not utter it God forbid in vain. This not only applies to the ineffable Name<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The four letters of <i>Yud-Hey-Vov-Hey</i>.</i> but includes all Names that are ascribed to Hashem, Blessed be He. It is not only forbidden in Hebrew but is forbidden in any language. He who curses his friend or himself in the Name of Hashem, Blessed be He or in one of the allusions to Hashem, (the allusions refer to the adjectives that are used to praise the Holy One Blessed is He, e.g., the Great, the Powerful, the Awesome, the Faithful, the Glorious, the Mighty, the Valiant, the Strong, the Gracious, the Merciful, the Zealous, Prolonger of Wrath, and Bestower of Kindness) in any language, incurs the penalty of lashes. In our sinfulness many people are careless and say: \"God should punish him\" or something similar to that, thereby violating a prohibition of the Torah. If one curses without using Hashem's Name or without the allusion to Him or if the curse was implied from something else that was said, for example: May that person not be blessed by Hashem or a similar statement, even though there is no penalty of lashes there is still a violation (see <i>Choshen Mishpat</i> ch. 27). Similarly it is forbidden to write His Name Blessed be He, in any letter, in any language.

When the Name of God is mentioned frequently, especially when mentioned disdainfully, God forbid it causes poverty among Jews. Wisdom and effort are required to halt this practice (See <i>Urim</i> there). When saliva accumulates in your mouth, you should remove it and then say the Name of Hashem, and not say the Name and then spit. Similarly, when kissing the Torah, remove any saliva before kissing the Torah and not afterwards. When you wish to mention the Name of Hashem you should say the word <i>Hashem</i>,<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally meaning “the Name.”</i> and not as the common people who say <i>Adoshem,</i> because this reference is undignified when referring to Heaven.

If the hole was made above three thumb-breadths, although upon tying the <i>tzitzah</i> and drawing the knot, the garment is creased causing the hole to be lowered, it is nevertheless invalid. If, after threading the <i>tzitzah</i> through the hole which is above the prescribed distance, he widened the hole by cutting it in order that the <i>tzitzah</i> hangs within three thumb-breadths [of the edge], it is [still] invalid because Scripture states: \"You shall make,\"<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Deuteronomy</i>, 22:12.</i> and not [that] which is already made.<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See preface to this paragraph.</i> Likewise, the hole should not be closer to the garment edge, whether along its length or width, than the distance from the middle knuckle of the thumb to the end of the thumb nail, because less than this amount is also not considered the corner but rather <i>under</i> the corner. If the hole was the proper distance [from the edge] but by pulling the knot the garment edge shrank so that there is no longer the proper distance, it is nevertheless valid.<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The distance to the corner must be measured with the garment in its normal state.</i> If there are fringes on the garment edge and they are not woven into the garment, it is questionable if they are included as part of these measurements or not. Therefore, it is necessary to cut them before attaching the tzitzis. Regarding the small tallis, some people have the custom to make two holes next to each other similar to the vowel <i>tzeirei</i>, and they thread the tzitzis through both holes so that they hang on the garment towards the outside.",
            "If at the time of tying the tzitzis the hole was at the proper distance, but afterwards the hole tore slightly or the edge of the garment tore so that the tzitzis are then less than the proper distance from the edge, it is not invalid, because the Torah insists that the <i>tzitzah</i> be placed under the corner only at the time of attaching [the tzitzis] as is stated in Scripture: \"They shall make for them tzitzis on the corners of their clothes etc.\" Nevertheless, it is preferable to make a hem around the hole and at the edge of the garment so that it does not [tear and] diminish [the distance to less than] the knuckle of the thumb [to the end of the nail].",
            "The custom is to tie the tzitzis [into] five double knots so that between them there will be four links. This [is done in the following manner:] the four strings are inserted into the hole and are tied in a double knot and are wound around seven times with the long string called the <i>shamash</i>. Again a double knot is made and again [the string] wound around eight [times] [with the <i>shamash</i>] [followed by] a double knot and wound around eleven [times] [followed by] a double knot, and wound around thirteeen [times] [followed by] a double knot. Since the beauty of the tzitzis is the equal dimension of all its links,<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., it is more attractive if they are uniform.</i> therefore, in the first link, where the windings are few they should be a distance, one from another, and in the second link they should be brought closer. [This should] also [be done] in the third and fourth [links.] The proper lenght for each <i>tzitzah</i>, that is from the first knot until the end of the strings, should be at least twelve thumb-breadths.<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See glossary.</i> The preferable adornment [would be] that all the links together should comprise a third of the <i>tzitzah</i> and the hanging strings the [remaining] two thirds. Therefore care should be taken that each link should be the width of a thumb<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See glossary.</i> so that all of the links should total four thumb-breadths, and the hanging threads should be eight thumb-breadths. If the tzitzis are longer, then the links should also be made slightly longer. It is preferable that all of the knots be made with the [same] four strings [always remaining] on one side, with the [other] four strings [always remaining] on the other side, so that each [individual] string is divided, half on one side [of the four], and half on the other side.<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Explanation: Four strings are inserted through the hole. After they are drawn through, all the ends are lined up, making a total of eight strings which hang from the corner. While making the knots and winding the <i>shamash</i>, care should be taken that the strings remain divided in their respective two groups of four. The advantage of this will become apparent in paragraph 13.</i>",
            "If the strings were not cut from each other but, rather, one very long string was taken and folded to make four [strings], and in this manner inserted into the hole and then made into knots, and afterwards cut, [separating them into individual strings,] it is invalid; this is based on the verse in Scripture: \"You shall make tzitzis for yourself.\" We infer from this that you must make the tzitzis, and not tzitzis that come into being, meaning: it is required that the tzitzis be valid when they are attached to the garment. They may not be invalid at the time of attachment and become valid [afterwards] through another action which would cause them to be valid. This [entire procedure] is invalid. Similarly if the <i>tzitzah</i> were made properly on another garment and that garment tore, and you wish to place the <i>tzitzah</i> in the same way on another garment, or even on this same garment, for example: if the garment tore from the hole until the edge of the garment<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the hole opened completely through the edge of the garment.</i> causing the <i>tzitzah</i> to fall, and you want to put it back to its proper place and then restitch the garment until the hole, this is also invalid because of <i>Ta'aseh velo min he'asui</i>. Similarly, if you tied the tzitzis when the garment was exempt from tzitzis, for example when most of the garment was sewn,<sup>20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In a way that there are no four corners.</i> and afterwards you undid some stitches causing the garment to open most of the way,<sup>21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thereby forming the corners.</i> and [as a result became] obligated to have tzitzis, [then,] if the tzitzis remain as they were,they are invalid because of <i>Ta'aseh velo min he'asui</i>.<sup>22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since he validated the tzitzis with an action other than making them now.</i> Rather,the tzitzis must be untied and then tied again properly. The same applies in any similar circumstance.",
            "Before putting on the tallis the tzitzis should be checked as to their validity. You must also check the strings that go through the hole as well as the <i>shamashim</i> (revolutions.) The strings should also be separated so that they must not be entangled with each other. If you are late in coming to the synagogue so that if you [take the time] to separate the tzitzis and check them you will be prevented from praying together with the congregation, you are not required to check them or separate them.<sup>23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The tallis that will be used on Shabbos should preferably be checked on Friday (<i>Bi’ur Halachah</i> chap. 13).</i>",
            "All mitzvos require a berachah <i>oveir la'asiyasan;</i> that is, the berachah must be made before the performance [of the mitzvah.] Immediately after the berachah the mitzvah must be performed without any interruption. Therefore, you should hold the tallis with both hands and think consciously that the Holy One, Blessed is He, commanded us to enwrap ourselves with tzitzis so that we remember to do all His mitzvos, as it is said, [in Scripture:] \"And you will look upon them (the tzitzis) and you will remember all the commandments of <i>Hashem</i>.\" While standing recite the berachah <i>lehisa'teif ba'tzitzis</i><sup>24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lit. to enwrap oneself in tzitzis. The berachah is made on “enwrapping” because that is the “active” part of the mitzvah, as opposed to wearing the tallis which is passive.</i> (with the vowel <i>pasach</i> under the <i>beis</i>.)<sup>25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., pronounced <i>bah tzitzis</i> rather than <i>b’tzitzis</i>.</i> You should then immediately cover your head [with the tallis] so that the tallis extends below the mouth, and then bring the corners [of the tallis] up to your neck and wrap yourself in the manner of the Arabs. You should remain standing like that for [the length of time] it takes to walk four <i>amos</i><sup>26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A few seconds.</i> and recite the verses: <i>Mah Yakar</i> etc. After this you may remove the tallis from your head.<sup>27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is most proper to pray with the tallis worn over the head (<i>Sha’arei Teshuvah</i> 8,3). In some communities it is acceptable to pray with the tallis not covering the head ( <i>Responsa Devar Shemuel</i> 123).</i> You should take care not to drag the tzitzis along the floor for [this would constitute] disrespect for the <i>mitzvah</i>. Therefore, you should lift them (the tzitzis), and you may tuck them into your belt.<sup>28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thereby preventing them from reaching the floor.</i>",
            "The berachah over the tzitzis is recited only during the daytime and not at night.<sup>29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Because Scripture states: “You shall see it (the tzitzis),” the Sages inferred that the berachah, for this mitzvah is said during the day.</i> It is preferable not to recite the berachah over the tzitzis until the [light of] day is sufficient to distinguish between blue and white. If you put on the small tallis while it was still night, and did not recite the berachah, or if you put it on before your hands were washed and thus did not recite the berachah, then, when reciting the berachah on the large tallis you should have in mind that this berachah [should also include] the small tallis. If you do not have a large tallis, and you put on the small tallis during the day, and your hands were [already] washed, you should recite the berachah: <i>Al mitzvas tzitzis</i> on it<sup>30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., on the small tallis.</i> (the letter <i>vav</i> with the vowel <i>pasach</i>).<sup>31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., <i>mitzvas</i>—singular and not <i>mitzvos</i>—plural.</i> If you put it on while still unable to recite the berachah,<sup>32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Because it was before daybreak.</i> then, afterwards, when daylight arrives and your hands are washed, you should take the tzitzis in your hands and recite the berachah: <i>Al mitzvas tzitzis</i>. If you slept while wearing a small tallis you do not recite a berachah after [daybreak] at all; but, [should instead,] when reciting the berachah on the large tallis, have intention to include [the small tallis].",
            "If you take off your tallis with the intention of putting it on again immediately, even if you did so for the purpose of going to the lavatory, when you return and put it on again you do not recite the berachah over it (the tallis).<sup>33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since your intention was to remove the tallis only temporarily,this does not constitute an interruption of the mitzvah and, therefore,does not require a new berachah.</i> (Since it is permissible to enter the lavatory with it [i. e. even while wearing a tallis]<sup>34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Though it is customarily not done, for the tallis is a garment used for prayers.</i> it is,therefore, not considered an interruption). However, if your intention was not to put the tallis on again immediately, and then you changed your mind and did put it on again, you must recite the berachah over it. If your tallis fell off accidentally, [then] if part of it remained on your body, regardless if most of it fell, as long as part of the mitzvah remained upon you you are not required to repeat the berachah when you readjust [the tallis]. However, if none of the tallis remains on your body, although you are holding it in your hand, [then] since no part of the mitzvah remains on your body, for the mitzvah is not to hold the tallis in your hand, but for the body to be wrapped in it, you must, therefore, say a berachah when you put the tallis on again. If this<sup>35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the tallis completely falls off your body.</i> happens to you during prayers at a point when you are not permitted to interrupt, you should not recite the blessing then but wait [instead] until you are permitted to recite the berachah, [at which point] you should grasp the tzitzis in your hand and recite the berachah.<sup>36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is a controversy among the <i>poskim</i> whether all of the aforementioned in paragraph 10 applies to someone who is wearing a small tallis when the large tallis falls off. <i>Machatzis Hashekel</i> (8,20), Responsa <i>Maharsham</i> (vol. IV. 148), Responsa <i>Imrei Yosher</i> (Vol. II, 9) do not require a new berachah. <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (9,39) concludes that he requires a new berachah. A learned Orthodox Rabbi should be consulted in this situation.</i>",
            "<small>The halachah states that \"One who borrows without the owner's knowledge is considered a thief\". (<i>Bava Basra</i> 88a). Here we find an exception to this law.

Still others go even further and hold that nowadays everyone is assumed to mind and specific permission must be received (<i>Aruch Hashulchan</i> 14: 11).</small><br>It is permissible to borrow someone's tallis on an irregular basis, even without his knowledge, and use it for prayers and to recite a berachah over it, because it may be assumed that one is pleased that a mitzvah is performed with his property, if it is at no loss to [the owner]. However, [the article] may not be removed from the house in which it was placed because the owner may object to that. If the [borrower found] the tallis folded he should replace it folded, but on Shabbos he may not fold it [and it may be assumed] that since the reason for his not folding it is due to a Shabbos restriction,<sup>37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Folding a garment with meticulous care is, in certain situations, prohibited on Shabbos for it constitutes improving the garment. For applicable details consult a learned Orthodox Rabbi.</i> the owner would not object. One who borrows a tallis from another only for the purpose of going up to [read from] the Torah, there is a halachic question if the berachah is recited. Therefore, you should specifically intend not to acquire the tallis, thereby, according to all opinions, you are not required to recite a berachah. However, on the congregation's tallis, even if you take it only for going up to the Torah, you are required to recite a berachah, because it is considered as if it were yours.",
            "When the Torah refers to \"wool\" or when the <i>Poskim</i> do so they [usually mean] sheep's or ram's wool. A pious person should not recite the berachah over a tallis [in which] the warp [threads] are made of wool and the woof threads are made of cotton, silk or the like; or the reverse, [that is,] that the woof threads are made of wool and the warp threads are of another material, because some <i>Poskim</i> maintain that even tzitzis made of wool only exempt a garment made of the same material.<sup>38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The tzitzis must be made of the same material as the garment.There are opinions, however, that tzitzis made of wool exempt “any” garment. Since this ruling is not universally accepted we refrain from reciting a berachah.</i> Similarly, over a tallis made of silk and the tzitzis are made of wool, a berachah is not said, but, [rather,] you should first recite the berachah over a woolen tallis and enwrap yourself with it and remove it (the woolen tallis), and then, enwrap yourself with it (the silk tallis).<sup>39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">By making a berachah over the woolen tallis and having in mind to exempt the silk tallis, he removes any controversy from his actions.</i> However, if the tzitzis [of the silk tallis] were also made of silk you may recite a berachah over it (the tallis,)<sup>40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">All authorities agree that where the garment and the tzitzis are made of the same material, the berachah may be said.</i> (Tzitzis of silk are not common in our countries because tzitzis must be spun for the purpose of tzitzis).<sup>41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lit. for its sake, i.e., for the sake and purpose of fulfilling the mitzvah. This intent must be stated verbally at the time of the spinning.</i> If the tzitzis were partially made of silk and partially of wool it is even worse (more questionable) and (tzitzis) should not be made in this manner.<sup>42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It has become customary to attach wool tzitzis to silk garments and a berachah may be said (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 9:6). [Note: <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 7:4 rules that leather garments are exempt from tzitzis because only woven garments are obligated to have tzitzis. Accordingly, nylon garments are exempt from tzitzis (<i>Igros Moshevol</i>. II, 2).] Rav Z.P. Frank in <i>Har Tzevi</i> maintains that nylon garments do require tzitzis.</i>",
            "A <i>tzitzah</i> from which a string tore from the four strings (that are folded over to form eight strings), and enough remained from it to allow the tying of a bow, that is, four thumb breadths, or if two strings tore but each had four thumb-breadths left and the other two strings remain complete with the prescribed size, it [the <i>tzitzah</i>] is valid. However, if three of the tzitzis strings tore, even if there remains from each (string) four thumb-breadths and the fourth string is complete, or if the tear was even in only one thread and there did not remain four thumb-breadths, even though the other three threads are complete, it is nevertheless invalid (unless it is an emergency). Therefore, if one string tears from the eight strings which are hanging, even if it tore completely up to the links it is certainly valid since this one string is only half [of a larger] string, and there is still [enough left] in the other half to tie a bow and even more. If two strings tore and there did not remain in each one four thumb-breadths, [then] if there is the possibility that these two strings are [really parts of] one string, then the <i>tzitzah</i> is invalid. However, if it is certain that they are from two separate strings, for example, if at the time of tying them he was careful to always tie the four ends on one side with the four ends of the other side, (as I've already mentioned at the end of paragraph five) and now there is a tear in two of the ends located on one side of the knot; in this particular case it is certain that the tears were in two separate strings, and since there still is in each string the amount of four thumb-breadths and even more on the second side of the knot, and the other two strings are complete, the <i>tzitzah</i> is valid. If one string tears at the point where they hang in the hole the <i>tzitzah</i> is invalid. We mentioned that if one string tears, and there remains a [sufficient] amount to tie a bow, that the <i>tzitzah</i> is valid, this is so only if at the time of making [the tzitzis] all of the strings were the proper length, except that afterwards they tore. However, if at the time of making the tzitzis, there was even only one string that was slightly shorter than the prescribed length the <i>tzitzah</i> is invalid.",

            "<small>Please refer to preface to para. 3 where the rule of <i>Ta'aseh velo min he'asui</i> was discussed. Here we find another situation where the problem arises:</small><br><small>A large tallis with a seam down the middle whose tzitzis are validly attached is separated at the seam for the purpose of facilitating the handling of the tallis during laundering or mending. We, thus, have \"two\" <i>taleisim</i> (the Yiddish plural of tallis) with two tzitzis each. We are now faced with a problem—sewing the two halves together again would result in validating the tallis for the mitzvah through an act not done directly to the tzitzis. Thus: <i>Ta'aseh velo min he'asui</i>. The author here proposes a solution to the problem.</small><br>This paragraph deals with a tallis that had tzitzis [attached] and was divided into two [halves] as is common with many of our <i>taleisim</i>, that are sewn together from separate sections. Occasionally [the sections] are separated in order to launder it, or to mend it, and then is restitched. Since there is usually enough left in each section to enwrap a person, it is sufficient to remove two of the tzitzis from any section and after restitching the tallis to retie the tzitzis.<sup>45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus avoiding <i>ta’aseh velo min he’asui</i>.</i> However, if each section is not large enough to enwrap a person, he must [first] remove all of the tzitzis (because when the sections were separated each part is exempt from the mitzvah of tzitzis, and when they are later reattached and require tzitzis, then, if the original tzitzis remain the tallis is invalid because of <i>Ta'aseh velo min he'asui</i> as [was mentioned] previously in paragraph six). If in one section there <i>is</i> a sufficient amount [left] to enwrap [a person], and in the other section there is not enough to enwrap [a person], he should [then] remove the tzitzis from the part that does not have enough to enwrap a person.",
            "If the corner [of the tallis] was either cut or torn and became completely separated from the tallis, and the area of that piece is less than three thumb-breadths by three thumb-breadths, there are those who maintain that this piece, even after it is resewn properly to the tallis, is invalid for attaching tzitzis to it. [The reason for this is] since there is not [in this piece] three thumb-breadths by three thumb-breadths it is not considered to be a \"garment\"<sup>46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Torah writes: “upon the corners of their <i>garments</i>” and a piece of cloth less than three by three is <i>halachically</i> not considered a “garment.”</i> and even if it is attached to the tallis it is still considered as separated. We should adhere to this strict view. However, if the piece is not separated completely from the tallis, as long as it remains slightly attached, resewing it [to the tallis] is sufficient [for the piece] to be considered a part of the tallis, and the tzitzis that will be attached, after resewing [the piece], are valid. The custom is to sew a piece of cloth (three by three) on the corners of the tallis because in many garments, even if they are new, there are pieces of cloth attached that are less than three <i>agudlin</i> by three <i>agudlin</i>. We, therefore, sew at the place that we attach the tzitzis, a piece of cloth, three <i>agudlin</i> by three <i>agudlin</i>.",
            "<small><i>Rashi's</i> opinion(<i>Maseches Menachos</i> 41a) is that any thread used in the stitching at the corner of the garment should be of material other than the tzitzis. This is because there is concern that one may leave some of the sewing thread dangling from the corner and then combine it with three other strings for tzitzis. Since his original intent for this thread was for stitching and not for tzitzis, it cannot <i>become</i> part of the tzitzis merely by his decision to consider it so. This constitutes <i>Ta'aseh velo min he'asui</i>.</small><br>Some authorities hold: that on the entire area of the corner, which is eligible for attaching the tzitzis, that is, from after the length of the first thumb knuckle, from the edge of the tallis until a length of three thumb-breadths,<sup>47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See glossary.</i> there should not be any stitches whatsoever with a thread that may be used in the making of tzitzis for this particular tallis;<sup>48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See preface for the reason.</i> for example, if the tallis, was made of linen, one should not sew there with linen threads, but [use] only silk threads or the like.<sup>49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., or any thread not valid for tzitzis in this tallis.</i> [Likewise] if the tallis is silk it should not be sewn with silk threads. If the tallis was made of wool it should not be sewn with woolen threads but with silken threads or the like. It is preferable to adhere to this strict view also in regard to the hem that is made around the hole to reinforce it (the hole). All of the above, however, applies only to white thread but with colored thread<sup>50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Which is not to be used for tzitzis.</i>there is no reason for concern.<sup>51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And the thread used at the “corner” may be of the same material as the tallis.</i>",
            "If you wish to remove the tzitzis from the tallis in order to reattach replacement tzitzis which are more beautiful, or because one of the threads tore and you wish to attach complete ones, although the original tzitzis are still valid, it is nevertheless permissible [to remove them] since you are not nullifying the tallis from the mitzvah of tzitzis. On the contrary, you will be attaching more beautiful tzitzis. [However,] you should be careful not to throw the original [tzitzis] into a disrespectful place.<sup>52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to some <i>poskim</i> it is more respectful to untie the tzitzis rather than cut them off (<i>Peri Megadim</i> 15:2).Others, however, permit cutting them where untying them would be too tedious ( <i>Chaye Adam</i> 11:32).</i>",
            "Even tzitzis that have become invalid and were removed from the tallis should not be thrown into the trash because it shows disrespect for the mitzvah. Some people are careful to place them in a holy book and to use them as a bookmark; for since they were used to perform a mitzvah at one time, let them be used for another mitzvah. Likewise, a tallis that has aged and is no longer worn as a mitzvah, should not be used in a disrespectful way.",
            "<small>It is important to note that wearing a four-cornered garment without valid tzitzis is not merely a failure to perform a mitzvah but, rather, a transgression, because the Torah <i>prohibits</i> the wearing of a four-cornered garment without tzitzis.</small><br>If you go to a Synagogue on Shabbos and discover that a <i>tzitzah</i> of your tallis has become invalid and you are unable to borrow another tallis and you are embarrassed to sit without a tallis, then, since it is not possible for you to tie another <i>tzitzah</i> on this day,<sup>53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Because it is prohibited to tie a knot on <i>Shabbos</i>.</i> therefore for the sake of your dignity you are permitted to wear the tallis as is<sup>54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., despite the invalid tzitzis.</i> but you should not recite the berachah. This is applicable only if you were unaware before Shabbos that [the <i>tzitzah</i>] became invalid, but if you knew before Shabbos that it became invalid you are forbidden to wear the tallis, since you should have fixed it the day before.",
            "If a garment that requires tzitzis is worn without tzitzis, this constitutes transgression of a positive command.<sup>55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See preface to paragraph 20.</i> We must be careful about certain garments that are made with four corners; one corner must be cut so that it becomes rounded.<sup>56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leaving the garment with only three “corners” and removing the obligation of tzitzis.</i> However, if the corner was merely folded and sewed it so that it appears round it is not sufficient, because as long as it was not cut, it is still considered part of the garment.<sup>57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And the garment still has four corners. Note: Only garments that are used to dress the body are obligated to have tzitzis. Therefore, a cloth used as a head-dress does not require tzitzis (<i>Beis Yoseif</i> 10); neither does a scarf (<i>Aruch Hashulchan</i> 3:22). (This would make it doubtful as to whether <i>talleisim</i> worn as scarves, which are available in some synagogues, would constitute a fulfillment of the mitzvah of tzitzis. These <i>talleisim</i> also do not have the required dimensions for a valid tallis.)</i> Great is the punishment for one who negates the mitzvah of tzitzis.

            "The mitzvah of tefillin is also a very precious mitzvah, for the entire Torah is similar to tefillin, as it is said: \"In order that the Torah of Hashem be in your mouth.\"<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Exodus</i> 13:9. This verse is stated in the context of the mitzvah of tefillin.</i> And someone who does not put on tefillin, is reckoned among the transgressors of Israel who sin with their bodies, [i. e., tefillin are worn on the arm and head]. Similarly one who puts on invalid tefillin,<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This <i>halacha</i> applies only to one who knowingly puts on invalid tefillin; but if he found that his tefillin became invalid after he purchased them, we assume that they were valid until the moment they were found to be defective and his mitzvah was fulfilled.</i> not only fails to perform the mitzvah, but he also recites many berachos in vain, which is a grave sin. Therefore, you should be careful to purchase tefillin from an expert, and God-fearing scribe. Similarly, the tefillin straps should be purchased from a trustworthy person to be sure that the leather was processed for the sake of tefillin, from hides of a kosher animal. But among our many sins is the temptation to purchase tefillin and tefillin straps from anyone who sells them cheaply, [even though] their tefillin are invalid. Every God-fearing person should consider this: if he is concerned to select proper material for his clothing and utensils, then certainly he should not economize and worry about the cost when buying articles to serve God, blessed is His Name. You should therefore be careful to purchase [only] those tefillin that are definitely kosher, even though they cost more. You should take care that they are always in proper order, and that the <i>batim</i><sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lit. “batim” i.e., houses. These cases “house” the written parchments. You must not allow the black paint to be peeled from the <i>batim</i> or straps.</i> and straps are always black. You should smear the straps with oil regularly to ensure their blackness, (but they should not be smeared with the oil of a fish called \"fishtron\" because this oil is derived from a non-kosher fish.) If the tefillin were damaged even slightly or if the stitches tore, you should immediately consult a rabbinic expert to determine their validity. You should be especially careful regarding the corners [of the <i>batim</i>] and specifically to the <i>shel rosh</i><sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the tefillin worn on the head.</i> because they frequently rub against objects which cause dents making them invalid. And also very frequently when tefillin become old, a separation appears in the upper hide of the <i>shel rosh</i> making it invalid. You should be greatly concerned about all of these matters. All who are careful [in the observance] of the mitzvah of tefillin and treat them with sanctity, not speaking of trivial or secular matters when wearing them, will have his days lengthened, and is assured of a share in the World to Come, as it is said: \"Hashem is upon them (for they carry upon themselves the Name of Hashem in the tefillin) and they shall live; and in all these things will my spirit live, and You will give me health and give me life.\"<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Isaiah</i> 38,16. This refers to the expression of thanks that King Chizkiyahu gave to Hashem after he recovered from his illness.</i> The word, tefillin, means judgement and admonition (and therefore the <i>lamed</i> has a dot in order to compensate for the second <i>lamed</i> which is missing) because the tefillin are testimony and proof that the Divine Presence dwells upon us, as is stated in Scripture: \"All the peoples of the earth shall see that the Name of Hashem is called upon you etc.\"<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Deuteronomy</i> 28:10.</i> Our Sages, of blessed memory, explain that this refers to the <i>shel rosh</i> upon which is formed the letters <i>shin</i> of Hashem's Name, <i>Shadai</i>. And therefore you should not cover the <i>shel rosh</i> completely with the tallis.<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">However, if the tallis does cover the tefillin it does not invalidate the mitzvah.</i>",
            "The time for putting on the tefillin in the morning [begins from the time] when you are able to see and recognize a neighbor with whom you are slightly familiar at a distance of four <i>amos</i>.<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See glossary for equivalent of <i>amah</i>. <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 30:13 quotes Rabbi Akiva Eiger who said that if you put on tefillin before it was light and you recited the <i>berachos</i>, you do not have to recite them again when it gets light.</i> The tefillin should be put on after you put on the tallis. The reason for the precedence of the <i>tzitzis</i> over tefillin is because the mitzvah of <i>tzitzis</i> is performed more frequently, being performed during weekdays as well as Shabbos and Yom Tov, whereas the mitzvah of tefillin is performed only during weekdays. [And] the rule is that in choosing between a regularly performed mitzvah, and one that is not performed [as] regularly, the regularly performed mitzvah takes precedence. However, if you happen to touch the tefillin first even though they are still inside their bag, you must put them on first and then enwrap yourself with the tallis, because the rule is that a mitzvah must not be passed by as it is written: \"You shall watch the <i>matzos</i>,\"<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Exodus</i> 12:17.</i> which may also may be read as the <i>mitzvos</i>, [that is, when the opportunity to do] a mitzvah presents itself, do not let it sour by delaying its fulfillment.",
            "It is written: \"It shall be a sign upon your hand.\"<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Exodus</i> 13:16.</i> Since the word <i>Yadecha</i> is written with a [superfluous] <i>hei</i>, our Sages of blessed memory teach: that this means <i>yad keiha</i> or weak hand referring to the left hand which is weaker and feebler.<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The usual spelling of the word <i>yadecha</i> would be with the letter <i>chaf</i> as the suffix. Since in our verse there is a variance with a different spelling, it indicates the need of a <i>drashah</i>.</i> The tefillin should be placed on the elevated part of the muscle as it said: \"Place these words of Mine upon your hearts,\"<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Deuteronomy</i> 11:18.</i> which means it shall be put opposite the heart, and therefore you should place the tefillin there and incline it slightly toward the body, so that when you bend your arm down, the tefillin will be opposite your heart. Although regarding the <i>shel rosh</i> it is written: \"Between your eyes,\" our Sages of blessed memory knew from sacred tradition that this does not mean literally \"between your eyes\" but, rather, [on the head] above the space between your eyes. And the proper place is from where the hair begins to grow, and this place extends to the end of the spot where a baby's scalp is soft. This means that the lower edge of the tefillin should not be lower than the place where hair begins to grow, and the upper edge of the tefillin which is above [on the head], should not be higher than the place where the scalp of a baby is soft. Great care must be taken that the tefillin should rest on its proper place. If you place the <i>shel rosh</i> [so that] even a small part is on the forehead where hair does not grow or even if you place the entire <i>shel rosh</i> on the place where hair grows but it is moved to the side and is not between the eyes, the mitzvah is not fulfilled, and the berachah is in vain. The knot [in the strap] should be placed opposite the tefillin at the back of the head above the nape of the neck, which is the base of the skull where hair grows, which is opposite the face; and it should not incline to either direction. The strap should be secure on the head. When the <i>bayis</i><sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., case.</i> and its base are exceedingly wide it is difficult to maintain their tightness, and it is therefore, urgent to be most careful in this matter.",
            "The tefillin must be put on while standing.<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is a custom among Sefardim which is based on the <i>Zohar</i> to put on the <i>shel yad</i> while sitting. The berachah however is said while standing.</i> You should not shake the tefillin out of the bag, because this is disrespectful to the mitzvah, but you should take them out with your hand. You first put on the <i>shel yad</i><sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The tefillin for the arm.</i> and before you tighten the knot<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If you forgot, you may recite the berachah even after you tighten the knot.</i> recite the berachah: <i>lehani'ach tefillin</i> (the letter <i>hay</i> has the vowel <i>kametz</i> and the letter <i>lamed</i> of the word tefillin<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to technical rules of grammar a letter with a dot has a different pronunciation than a letter without a dot.</i> has a dot in it). You then tighten the knot and wind the strap around your arm seven times, and then immediately put on the <i>shel rosh</i>. Before tightening it on your head recite the berachah: <i>al mitzvas tefillin</i> (the letter <i>vav</i> has the vowel <i>pasach</i>). You then tighten the <i>shel rosh</i> and say the verse: Blessed [is His] Name, Whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever. The reason it is necessary to say: Blessed [is His] Name, Whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever, is because there is some doubt regarding the [second] berachah,<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is a dispute amongst the halachic authorities whether this berachah should be recited or not.</i> and because there is a doubt regarding this berachah there is consequently also a doubt if one who hears the berachah should answer <i>Amein</i><sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> you may answer <i>Amein</i>.</i> or not. Therefore, it appears to me that it is preferable to recite this berachah in an undertone. After putting on the <i>shel rosh</i> coil the strap of the <i>shel yad</i> three times around the middle finger, once on the middle section and twice on the lower section.<sup>20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The finger is composed of three sections.</i>",

Since the precendence of the <i>tefillin shel yad</i> over the <i>tefillin shel rosh</i> is ordained in the Torah, as it is said: \"And you shall bind them for a sign upon your arm and they shall be <i>totafos</i> between your eyes,\" we are therefore not concerned with passing over a mitzvah in this case.<sup>22</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Deuteronomy</i> 6:8.

We pray that His Name be exalted and sanctified instead. Due to its great and awesome ramifications, our Sages wanted everyone to understand the meaning of this prayer and thus instituted that it be said in the spoken tongue; namely, Aramaic.

If ten men were not present when <i>Yishtabach</i> was said but, the <i>minyan</i> was completed afterwards, then, the chazzan may not say Kaddish, because Kaddish is said only following something that was said by ten men. They should, therefore, wait to say <i>Yishtabach</i> until ten [men] arrive. They may wait until almost a half-hour. They should not wait longer, but, rather, they should say <i>Yishtabach</i> and then wait. When ten [men] arrive they should first say a few verses, and afterwards the chazzan says half-Kaddish.",

When the chazzan repeats [the <i>Musaf</i> prayer], he (the chazzan) discontinues saying it, and after that the congregation does not say it at the <i>Minchah</i> prayer, because they have already heard that the chazzan has discontinued saying it.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e. hearing the chazzan repeat the <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> without adding <i>mashiv haruach</i> is equivalent to a public announcement.</i> A person praying privately, should say the <i>Musaf</i> prayer early enough, in order [to be sure] that the chazzan has not yet discontinued saying it in the city synagogues, because whoever prays [<i>Musaf</i> on the first day of <i>Pesach</i>] after the chazzan has discontinued saying [<i>mashiv haruach</i>] at <i>Musaf</i>, no longer says it [himself]. There are congregations<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">During the summer months there are three customs:<br>a) <i>Nusach Ashkenaz</i> adds nothing to replace <i>mashiv haruach umorid hageshem</i>.<br>b) The Sephardim, Hassidic congregations who follow <i>Nusach Sefard</i>, the Vilna Gaon, and those residing in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> add: <i>morid hatal</i> (He brings down the dew).<br>c) Still others add: <i>mashiv haruach umorid hatal</i>.</i> that add, <i>mashiv haruach umorid hatal</i> during the summer. [In those places] the <i>shamash</i> should announce it before <i>Musaf</i> on the first day of <i>Pesach</i>, and then the [congregation] begins to say it in the silent [<i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> of <i>Musaf</i>,] and they discontinue saying <i>umorid hageshem</i>.",

If you did not remember until having completed the berachah, continue on, and in the berachah of <i>Shema koleinu</i>, after the words: <i>\"reikom al tisheveinu\"</i> [\"Do not turn us away empty-handed,\"] say: <i>vesein tal umatar livrachah Ki atah shomea</i> … And even if you did not remember then, but only after you said, <i>Baruch atah</i>, as long as you had not yet said <i>Hashem</i>, you may say: <i>vesin tal umatar livrachah, ki ata shomea</i> … But, if you did not realize [that you forgot to add <i>tal umatar</i>] until after you completed the berachah <i>Shomea tefillah</i>, [then] you must go back and begin <i>Bareich aleinu</i> … And if you did not remember until you said the verse [at the end of <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i>]: <i>Yihyu le'ratzon</i> … you must go back to the very beginning of the <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i>.",

            "Preface:<br><small>The general rule is that omitting one of the prayers requires a make-up-prayer. This will compensate for having omitted a <i>tefillah</i>, but only where the omission occurred unwillingly (<span>אוֹנֵס</span>) or unintentionally (<span>שׁוֹגֵג</span>). But if one willfully and deliberately omitted a <i>tefillah</i>, there is no way to compensate. An important fact to keep in mind while studying this chapter: The compensation <i>tefillah</i> is performed by repeating the particular <i>tefillah</i> that is due at that time. For example, if at <i>Maariv</i> one compensates for an omitted <i>Mincha</i>, he does this by praying two <i>Maariv Shemoneh Esrei's</i>. Due to this, a number of unique situations arise: e. g. Omitting <i>Mincha</i> on Friday afternoon requires two <i>Maariv Shemoneh Esreis</i> on Friday night, both, being the Shabbos eve <i>Shemoneh Esreis.</i></small><small>This chapter discusses the form this compensation takes as well as what is considered deliberate and what is considered unintentional and unwilling.</small><br>It has already been explained (in Chapter Eighteen) that if [you allowed] the time of <i>tefillah</i> to pass intentionally, there is no compensation. But if [it was] unintentional, or due to something beyond your control, that you did not pray, or [if you <i>did</i> pray, but] erred in your <i>tefillah</i> in a way that requires that you repeat the <i>tefillah</i>,<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And you first became aware of your error after the time for this <i>teflllah</i> had passed.</i> [then] you may compensate for it following the next <i>tefillah</i>.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">E.g. if you missed <i>Shacharis</i> or erred at <i>Shacharis</i> then you must compensate at <i>Minchah;</i> if you missed <i>Minchah</i> then you compensate at <i>Maariv</i> etc.</i> You must first pray the <i>tefillah</i> that is due at that time and [only] afterwards the make-up <i>tefillah</i>, for example: if you did not pray the <i>Shacharis tefillah</i>, then when the time for <i>Minchah</i> arrives, you first pray a <i>tefillah</i> for <i>Minchah</i>, followed by the <i>Tachanun</i> prayer, and immediately afterwards you should say <i>Ashrei</i>, and then pray another <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> for the sake of [the omitted] <i>Shacharis</i>. [Similarly] if you omitted <i>Minchah</i>, then you should first say the <i>Maariv</i> prayer, and then pause only for the time it takes to walk four <i>amos</i>, do not say <i>Ashrei</i>, but, immediately, pray the <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> prayer for the sake of [the omitted] <i>Minchah</i>. [Similarly] if you omitted <i>Maariv</i>, then after the <i>Shacharis</i> prayer you should say <i>Tachanun</i> and <i>Ashrei</i>, and [then] pray the <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> prayer for the sake of <i>Maariv</i>. After that you should say <i>Lamenatzeiach</i> and <i>Uva letzion</i>, etc. You may not eat until you also complete the make-up <i>tefillah</i>, which is for the sake of <i>Maariv</i>.",

Similarly if as a result of intoxication<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even a <i>revi’is</i> of alcohol disallows prayer until the effects have dissipated.

Subsequently, all that is lacking is <i>Ya’aleh ve’yavo</i>, and since at the make-up prayer you won’t compensate for <i>Ya’aleh ve’yavo</i>—it no longer being <i>Rosh Chodesh</i>—therefore, no compensation is possible.

This is the proper path [to follow] and it is the way of the righteous, [as stated in the Talmud]<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yoma</i> 23a.</i> \"They suffer insults but do not insult, they listen to abuse heaped on them but do not answer, they are motivated by love in whatever they do, and they rejoice [even when] suffering pain.\" Concerning them, the Biblical verse says: \"But those who love Him are as the sun when it comes out in its might.\"<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Judges 5:31.</i>",
            "Always cultivate the virtue of silence, and engage in conversation only on matters pertaining to Torah study, or on matters concerning your personal needs; and even when [discussing] your personal needs you should not talk too much about them.<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A person who voluntarily undertakes to observe a day of fasting would do better if he volunteered instead to abstain from talking for a day, for this form of “fasting” is not detrimental to his health. (<i>Mishnah Berurah 571:2</i>)</i> Our Rabbis of blessed memory have already said, \"Whoever talks excessively causes sin\" and they said [in the same vein], \"I have found nothing better for a person than silence.\"<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishnah <i>Avos</i> 1:17.</i> Rava said:<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Arachin</i> 15b.</i> \"What is the meaning of the verse, \"Death and life are controlled by the tongue.\" \"He who seeks life [can achieve it] through his tongue,<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">By engaging in Torah study.

Thus said [our Rabbis,] of blessed memory, \"Jesting and frivolity lead a man to immorality.\"<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishnah <i>Avos</i> 3:17.</i> You should also avoid greediness, eagerly rushing after wealth. Be not depressed, nor idle from work, but be benevolent in your outlook. Hold your business affairs to a minimum and be occupied with the study of Torah.

Thus said [our Sages] of blessed memory,<sup>20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishnah <i>Avos</i> 4:28.</i> \"Envy, lust and desire for glory remove a man from the world.\" So it is necessary that you stay away from these [bad traits].",
            "Perhaps a person might say: \"Since envy, lust and glory and the like, are bad character traits that remove a man from the world, I will completely abstain from them, and keep away from them entirely,\" to the point that he will not eat meat, nor drink wine, nor marry a woman, nor live in a comfortable dwelling, nor wear decent clothes, but he will put on a sackcloth, or something similar; this too is a bad way of life, and it is forbidden to follow it. Anyone who follows this life-style is called a sinner. For in regard to the <i>nazir</i> it is written,<sup>21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 6:11.

Despite this, the talebearing of Do'eg caused many <i>kohanim</i> to be killed.",
            "There is a much graver sin [than tale bearing] which is classified under this prohibition and that is slander;<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The laws against slander do not apply when you wish to protect someone from harm. For example, if you know that someone plans to cheat in business, or that he plans to borrow money and not repay the loan, or that the person who wishes to marry someone’s daughter is a evil and corrupt man, then it is a mitzvah to inform the concerned party. (<i>Pis’chei Teshuvah</i> 156, also <i>Chafeitz Chayim, Rechilus</i> 9)</i> which is, speaking of someone's shame, even if it is true. But a person who spreads lies [about others] is guilty of besmirching someone's name.

Rather when [Shimon] comes to borrow something, he should give it to him wholeheartedly and not pay him back for what he did to him. It is becoming for a person to show forebearance in all mundane matters, for in the eyes of understanding people, they are all nothing but vanity and futility, and not worth taking revenge because of them.

            "Because the maintenance of a complete and healthy body is a G-dly path—since it is impossible to understand or apprehend any knowledge of the Creator when one is sick—therefore you must keep away from things that damage the body, and develop habits that improve the body and heal it. Similarly, it is said: “You shall guard yourselves very well.”<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Devarim 4:15.</i>",
            "The Creator, blessed be He and blessed be His name, created the human being (and all living creatures) and gave them their natural warmth. This is the person’s life-force; if the natural fire is extinguished, life is gone. The maintenance of this warmth depends on the food that one eats. As with a burning fire, where if it is not regularly supplied with wood it will be entirely extinguished, so too with the human being: if one does not eat, the internal fire will be extinguished, and he will die. The food is ground between the teeth, mixed with saliva and mashed up. From there it descends to the stomach, where it is further broken down and is mixed with the stomach juices and bile, blended and processed by the heat and by the juices, and digested. The choice elements provide sustenance to all the limbs and sustains the person’s life; the waste, which is the extraneous material, is ejected. Of this we say in the Asher Yatzar blessing, “and [G-d] acts wondrously”—that G-d placed within the human being the natural ability to filter the good elements from the food, with each limb drawing the substance that befits it, and the waste being ejected. Were the waste to remain in the body, it would putrefy and bring on sickness, may G-d preserve us. Therefore, most aspects of bodily health and illness depend on the digestion of food: if the food is digested well and with ease, then the person is healthy; but if there are digestive problems, then the person becomes weak and can end up in danger, G-d forbid.",
            "Good digestion occurs when the food consumed is not excessive, and when it is easily digestible. If you eat a lot and the stomach is full, then digestion becomes difficult, for then the stomach is not able to expand and contract, as it should by nature, to properly process the food. Just as with a fire, where if it is over-heaped with wood it will not burn well, so it is with the food in the stomach. Therefore, if you wish to guard the health of your body, be careful not to eat more than an amount that is average relative to your body’s constitution, neither too little nor to full satiation. Most illnesses that come upon people are due only to bad foods, or filling one’s belly and eating excessively even of good foods. Thus said King Solomon in his wisdom: “One who watches his mouth and his tongue guards his soul from troubles,”<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishlei 21:23</i> meaning: guard your mouth from eating bad food and from being fully satisfied, and your tongue from speaking except as needed. Likewise the wise man said: One who eats a small amount of harmful foods is not harmed as much as one who eats excessively of good food.",
            "A youthful person has a strong digestive capacity, and therefore requires food more often than a middle-aged person. And an elderly person, whose digestive capacity is weak, must eat light foods, in small quantity and of good quality, to invigorate his strength.",
            "On hot days the digestive system is weakened by the heat, and therefore you ought to eat less during on hot days than on cold ones. Expert physicians have estimated that during the summer you should eat two-thirds of what you eat during the winter.",
            "It is a general rule of healthy practice that before eating, you should engage in some strenuous activity, whether walking or working, so that your body is warmed up, and then you should eat. As the verse says, “By the sweat of your brow you shall eat bread,”<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bereishit 3:19.</i> and “She does not eat the bread of laziness.”<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishlei 31:27.</i> You should loosen your belt before eating. This is hinted at in the verse אקחה פת לחם (“I will take a morsel of bread”<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bereishit 18:5.</i>): the word אקחה in reverse is an acronym for התר חגורה קודם אכילה (“loosen the belt before eating”), and פת לחם is an acronym for פן תבוא לידי חולי מעיים (“lest you cause yourself digestive disorders”). While eating, you should sit in your place or recline on your left side. After eating, don’t move about excessively, because that will cause the food to descend from the stomach before it has been fully digested, which can be harmful; rather one should walk a little and rest. But you should not go on a long walk or engage in strenuous activity after the meal. Nor should you sleep till at least two hours have elapsed after the meal, so that the fumes will not ascend to the head and cause damage. Likewise, bathing, bloodletting and sexual intercourse are not beneficial after a meal.",

If you have an intermediate temperament, you should eat foods that are median too. But if your temperament is not an intermediate one, you should eat foods that are the opposite of your temperament. If your temperament is hot, you should not eat hot things like herbs and spices, but rather things that are somewhat cold and pickled. If your temperament is cool, you should eat foods that are somewhat hot. Similarly, the food should be adjusted in accordance with the season and the climate: In the summer you should eat cold foods, like the meat of tender lambs or kids, and young chickens, and also some pickled foods. And in the winter, eat hot foods. Similarly, in a cold country you should eat hot foods, and in a hot country you should eat cold foods.",

It should rather contain some bran, and it should be moderately risen, contain salt, and baked in an oven. Other foods made of wheat are not beneficial. Of the varieties of meat, the best is that of a yearling lamb or of suckling kids. But in all cases the innards, and also the head, are not beneficial. The meat of goat and old cows, and old cheese, are bad and turgid foods. All bird’s meat is digested more easily than that of animals, and the best type of bird is chicken. Physicians have stated that if you are accustomed to a particular food, even if it is bad food, it does not harm you, because habit becomes second nature—provided that you do not stuff yourself with such food.",

Weak and old people should eat only a little at a time, and do so many times each day, for too much food weakens the stomach. If you wish to guard your health, do not eat until your stomach is empty of the previous meal. Normal digestion, for healthy people who eat and exercise to an intermediate degree, takes six hours. It is advisable to skip one meal each week to allow the stomach to rest from its work, thereby strengthening the digestive capacity.

These include: large fish that are salted and aged, aged salted cheese, truffles and mushrooms, aged salted meat, [unfermented] wine from the press, and any cooked food that has been left to the point that it gives off an odor. Likewise, any food that has a bad smell or a very bitter taste is like deadly poison to the body. There are other foods that are harmful, but not as detrimental as those already mentioned. Therefore it is recommended to eat them only in small quantities and at long intervals; don’t be in the habit of making them your regular diet or part of your regular diet. These include: large fish, cheese, milk that has been left for more than twenty-four hours since it was milked, the meat of large oxen or large male goats, barley bread, matzah, cabbage, leeks, onions, garlic, mustard and radishes. All of these are harmful, and it is recommended that one eat only a little of these, and only during the winter. But in the summer, one should not eat these at all.",

            "As regards drinks, water is the natural liquid for a human being and for the health of the body. If they are pure and clear, they are beneficial in that they maintain the body’s moisture and hasten the ejection of waste. When you drink water, it is preferable that it be cold, because it quenches thirst and improves digestion more than water that is not cold. But it should not be very cold, because that extinguishes the natural heat [of the body]. All the more so, when you are tired and exhausted, you should be very careful to not drink [very] cold water, for then the fat of the heart is heated and melted because of tiredness and exhaustion, and cold water is harmful to the point that you might be endangered, G-d forbid. Now although water is good for the health of the body, nevertheless you should not drink too much of it. You should not drink water before a meal, for it will cool down the stomach and it will not be able to digest the food properly. During the meal, too, you should not drink anything other than a bit of water mixed with wine. Only once the food has begun to be digested should you drink a moderate serving of water. Likewise, you should not drink water when you exit the bathhouse, so that the liver is not chilled; certainly you should not drink in the bathhouse. Likewise, you should not drink water directly after sexual intercourse, for then your natural heat is weakened, and it will cause the limbs to become chilled.",

If your head is weak, avoid wine, for it will make you weaker and fill your head with fumes. Wine is good for older people but harmful for youths, for it arouses the natural heat and is like adding fire to fire. You should avoid wine until the age of twenty-one. It is not recommended to drink wine before a meal—except a little in order to open up the innards—nor when you are hungry, have just exited the bathhouse or sauna, or have just exercised or worked hard. During the meal, you should drink only a little.",

A general rule of health is that whenever there is constipation or difficulty in defecating, harmful illnesses are on the way. Therefore, if you see that your bowels have weakened and have lost the power of ejecting, you should consult doctors for advice on how to loosen them, each person according to his temperament and age.",
            "A moderate amount of exercise is good for the body’s health (see above, paragraph 6). But strenuous exercise, and also rest, are detrimental to the body. In the summer one should exercise only a little, and during the winter you need more. A fat person must exercise more than a thin one.",
            "If you want to guard your health, you must be familiar with your emotional reactions and be cautious with them. Examples of these are joy, anxiety, anger and fear, all of which have psychological impact. An intelligent person should be happy with the portion granted to him during his transitory life, not anxious about a world that is not his own. You should not seek luxuries, but should be satisfied and moderately joyful, for this aids the improvement of the natural body heat, digestion of food and expulsion of waste, and strengthening of the sense of vision and all other senses; it also strengthens the intellectual faculties. But you should not try to increase your happiness by feasting and drinking, as fools do, because too much happiness brings body heat to the surface, sapping the body’s natural warmth, so that the heart becomes chilled rapidly and the person may die prematurely and suddenly. This especially occurs to people whose bodies are corpulent, for they have less natural heat in their bodies because their blood vessels are narrow and the circulation, which is source of the body’s heat, is slow. Anxiety is the opposite of joy, and it too is harmful, for it cools the body, so that the natural heat may converge on the heart and cause one’s death. Anger stokes the heat of the body, to the point that it can induce one or another kind of fever. Fear brings a chill to the body—thus, a fearful person shivers—and if this chill becomes too much, he may die. Needless to say, you should be careful not to eat when angry, fearful or anxious, but rather when in a moderately joyful mood.",
            "Sleep in moderation is good for the health of the body; then the food is digested and the faculties are at rest. If it happens that one is unable to sleep due to illness, he should eat foods that induce sleepiness. But too much sleep is detrimental, for the head then becomes filled with fumes which ascend from the belly to the brain; when the head is filled with such fumes, it causes great damage to the body. Just as you should be careful not to sleep directly after eating, so should you take care not to sleep when you are hungry, for when there is no food in the body, its heat acts on the excess [food waste], producing degraded fumes that ascend to the brain. When you sleep, your head should be raised up [higher than the rest of the body], for this will allow the food to descend from the opening of the stomach, and will decrease the amount of fumes that ascend to the brain. Natural sleep occurs at night. Sleep during the day is harmful, and is beneficial only to those who are accustomed to it (see more in chapter 71).",
            "The norm for bathing is that you should enter the bathhouse once in seven days. You should not enter the bathhouse when hungry, nor when you are full, but when the food has begun to be digested. You should first wash your body with hot water, then with warm water, then with lukewarm, and finally with cold water. When you exit the bath, you should dress and cover your head well, so that it should not be exposed to cold air; even in the summer season, you must take care with this. Afterwards you should wait till your spirit is settled, your body is rested and the heat has dissipated; then you can eat. If you nap for a short time after exiting the bathhouse and before eating, that is very beneficial.",

If possible, in the summer you should not live in a place that is open to the north or to the east, and there should be nothing foul-smelling nearby. It is very good to clean the air of the home constantly with good scents and beneficial fumigants.",
            "The air that is best for the health of the body is of average temperature, neither too cold nor too hot. Therefore everyone should be careful not to overheat their homes during the winter, as unthinking people do, because excessive heat encourages the onset of many grave illnesses, G-d forbid. Rather, you should heat your home only to the point where you do not feel any coldness but also do not feel too hot.",
            "To preserve your sense of sight, take the following precautions: Do not come suddenly, all at once, from a dark place to a well-lit one. If you need to enter from a dark place to a lighted one, open the door a bit and look at that small amount of light for a few moments, then open it more and again look at that light for a few moments, and then open it completely. Do the same when going from a lighted area to a dark one. This is because the shift from light to darkness, or from darkness to light, without any transition, damages the sense of sight. For this reason G-d, blessed be His name, in His great mercy created the world in such a way that the sun shines upon the earth little by little, not all at once, and likewise sets little by little. For this we bless Him as “the One who illuminates the earth and those who dwell upon it, with mercy,” meaning that He mercifully makes the sun shine little by little, and not suddenly, all at once. Reflected light from the sun—meaning that the sun shines on something and from there the light is reflected—is a light that is damaging to the eyes. Therefore you should take care not to dwell in a house where all the windows are on the north side, because the sun does not come to the north, so that all the light that comes from that side is only reflected light. Similarly, even if the windows are on the eastern, southern or western sides, if you cannot see the sky through the windows—for example, if there are high walls opposite them—then the light that comes through them is also only reflected light. You should take care not to be occupied with writing, reading a book, or any sort of detailed work by twilight, or in the middle of the day, when the sun’s light is at full strength. You should also not do too much writing, reading of books with fine print, or any other sort of detailed work by candlelight at night. Too much staring at the color white also damages the eyes; that is why the sky appears blue, not white, so it should not damage the eyes. Likewise, staring excessively at a bright red color, or at fire, is also damaging. Smoke and sulfurous fumes are also damaging, as are fine dust and wind that blows into one’s eyes. Also too much walking and large strides, and excessive crying [are harmful], as the verse says, “My eyes are spent with tears.”<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Eichah 2:11.</i> Most detrimental of all is excessive sexual intercourse.

A pause lasting as long as it takes to walk twenty-two <i>amos</i> [11.88 seconds], or from one house to another even if it is a short distance, or talking about something not related to the meal, is considered an interruption. However, if you did interrupt [in such a fashion], it does not matter, provided you did not perform some task in between; and did not engage in lengthy discussion, for if you did any of the above, it would be considered a distraction and you have to wash your hands again.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> disagrees.

            "You should break off the bread at the choicest part of the loaf in honor of the berachah. The choicest part is the crust or hard part, for there the bread is baked best, and it is the part opposite the place where the bread splits open. This occurs because at the place where it starts to bake, the pressure on the dough builds until the opposite side splits. However, an old person who finds it difficult to eat hard bread should cut the bread at the soft part. In any event, cutting the bread should not cause excessive delay between the berachah <i>Hamotzi</i> and eating the bread. Therefore [before saying the berachah], make a small, circular incision around the loaf, in a way that by holding the piece [to be cut], the entire loaf will be lifted along with it, for otherwise it is considered cut off, and we require that the berachah <i>Hamotzi</i> be said while the loaf is whole. [Therefore] leave the piece to be cut joined to the rest of the loaf and say the berachah <i>Hamotzi</i>, and after completing the berachah, you may separate them. In this manner the berachah is concluded while the loaf is still whole. Similarly, when breaking off a piece from a loaf which is not whole, do not cut the slice off completely before saying <i>Hamotzi</i>, so that the loaf should be as large as possible at the time of the berachah. On Shabbos, however, do not cut into the bread at all until after reciting the berachah, so that the loaves should be completely whole. Also on a weekday, if you eat a thin type of bread, [such as matzah], recite the berachah before breaking it, since there is no delay in breaking the bread.",

On Shabbos, even if you eat alone, you may cut off as much as you need for the entire meal, in honor of the Shabbos. You indicate your fondness for the Shabbos meal, by your desire to eat generously of the food. You should eat the piece that you cut off before eating any other bread, to show your fondness for this <i>mitzvah</i>, since you recited the berachah over this piece. It is also preferable not to give from this piece to a non-Jew or an animal or fowl.",

A sheaf forgotten in the field must be left for the poor. 5. A corner of the field must be left unharvested for the poor. 6. It is forbidden to muzzle a working animal. 7. A portion of grain must be separated and given to the <i>kohein</i> (priestly family). 8. A tenth of the remaining harvest must be given to the Levite. 9. A tenth of the remaining harvest is then separated to be taken up to Jerusalem and eaten by the owner. 10. A piece of the dough is separated and given to the <i>kohein</i>. For this same reason there are ten words in the berachah of <i>Hamotzi</i>, and ten words in the verse (Psalms 145:15): \"The eyes of all look expectantly to You\" etc., and ten words in the verse (Deuteronomy 8:8): \"A land of wheat and barley\" etc., and ten words in the verse (Genesis 27:28): \"And may Hashem give you\" etc. When you pronounce the Name of Hashem, lift up the bread.

But if they are not from the same grain, and the whole one is of inferior quality, for example, if the whole loaf is made from spelt, and the cut piece is made from wheat, even if the piece is smaller than the loaf, you should say the berachah on the piece made from wheat. If, however, the whole loaf is made from barley, even though it is inferior to wheat, nevertheless, since barley is also clearly mentioned in the Torah, and since the loaf is a whole one, a God-fearing person should show respect also to the whole barley loaf. How can you accomplish this? Place the cut piece underneath the whole loaf [and say the berachah] and break off from both at the same time. If both of them are whole or both are already sliced and both are made from the same grain, say the berachah on the purest of the two. If both are equally pure, say the berachah on the larger of the two pieces.",

But if the bread made by the Jew is not as pure as the one made by the non-Jew then recite the berachah on whichever one you wish.

But, if you cooked only a small amount of cereal or groats and the main object is only for the soup or the milk, in such a case they do not lose their significance and you recite the berachah, <i>Shehakol</i>, over it. And even though you eat the cereal or groats also, the soup or milk do not lose their significance because they are considered the main object. Nevertheless, in order to do the <i>mitzvah</i> in the most appropriate manner, it is proper that you first recite the berachah <i>Shehakol</i> only on the soup or the milk and drink a small amount by itself (avoiding any of the grain), and afterwards recite the berachah <i>Borei minei mezonos</i> on the cereal or groats, because although the intent (of the cooking) was not for them, they do not become secondary. Grain is [always] considered a major [food] and does not become secondary to forfeit its own berachah as long as its purpose is to add flavor to the food being cooked.",

After that, you may eat them together. And the soup (in which they were cooked) is secondary and does not require a berachah. But if they dissolved and were totally merged together (i.e., into a new food form) for instance a dish that is prepared by mixing flour, eggs, and cheese and then boiled or fried (e.g., pancakes or blintzes), even though the flour is the lesser quantity, nevertheless, since it is [made of] one of the five grains, it is considered primary and the berachah is <i>Borei minei mezonos</i>, and afterwards <i>Al hamichyah</i>. However, this rule applies only when the flour is added to contribute to its taste. But, if only a little is added as a binder (or thickener), as is regularly done to prepare various sauces with a small amount of flour, and similarly, baked confections [that are made with] almonds, sugar and eggs with a little flour added merely as a binder, then the flour loses its identity and the berachah is made on the major ingredient only. The same applies to gravy [or sauce] that is boiled or fried with some flour, browned and fried in butter, the berachah made on the sauce or gravy is <i>shehakol</i>. But if you pick out the bits of browned flour and eat them separately, you must make the berachah, <i>Borei minei mezonos</i>.

Additionally, wine has other qualities as evidenced by the requirement that the <i>kiddush</i> and <i>havdallah</i>, as well as <i>sheva berachos</i>, are said over wine. In addition, wine was also assigned its own after-berachah, i.e. <i>Al Ha'gefen</i>.</small><small>This chapter deals with determining at what point in the process of wine preparation does it achieve the status of \"wine,\" and at what point of its deterioration does it turn into \"vinegar,\" losing the status of \"wine.\"</small><br>The berachah on wine is <i>Borei peri hagafen</i> and after [drinking it] <i>Al hagefen</i>, etc. It makes no difference whether the wine is still bubbling<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is still fermenting and not yet in its “full-wine stage.”</i> [or not].

Even if the wine smells like vinegar,<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Before the days of pasteurization, wine often soured and turned into vinegar.</i> as long as it has the taste of wine, it is considered wine as far as its berachah is concerned. But, if it has turned vinegary, to the extent that some people refrain from drinking it because of its sour taste, then the berachah is in question. (And although you can say the berachah, <i>Shehakol</i>, before drinking it, there is still a question about the after-berachah.)<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A short explanation is in order: wine loses its status as “wine” when it reaches the point where the “average person” will not drink it because of its sour taste. The question (and this question always arises when reference is made to “the average man”) is: What is “the average man”, i.e. at what point can it be rightfully stated that “people” generally would not drink this wine.</i> Therefore, you should not drink it unless you first make a berachah over good wine [and drink it.]<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Then you may drink the questionable wine without a pre-berachah and have no doubts about the after-berachah.</i>",
            "Concerning grape seeds from which wine was extracted only by means of trampling, but which were not pressed in a [heavy duty] wine press, the following should be noted: if water was poured upon them, even if they recovered no more [water] than they poured [on them],<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the recovered liquid would be greater than the amount poured in, this could indicate that there was wine still absorbed in the seeds which was released with this new pressing. The berachah would obviously be <i>Borei peri hagafen</i>. More so, the author states, even if the volume of liquid poured was equal to or even greater than the amount recovered, the berachah would still be <i>Borei peri hagafen</i>, provided that the recovered liquid has the <i>taste</i> of wine.</i> or even if they recovered less, nevertheless, if it has the taste of wine, the berachah is <i>Borei peri hagafen</i>. But, if the seeds were pressed in a [heavy duty] wine press and <i>then</i> the water was poured on them or they poured water upon the residue [in the vat from which all the seeds were removed],<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is known as “wine lees”—a yeasty substance which, when mixed with water, produces a tangy tart drink.</i> it is considered as water.<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is assumed that all the wine remaining in the seeds has been removed by the heavy-duty press.

However, that sort of wine making is a lost art and we now no longer produce such strong wines and we judge each mixture according to its time and place. But, in <i>all</i> cases, a mixture exceeding five parts water to one part wine is no longer wine.</i> the wine is definitely nullified, and it is considered as water. But, if it has more wine [than one sixth], and it is the custom of the people of that area to dilute it to that degree and to drink it as wine, the berachah over it is <i>Borei peri hagafen</i> and afterwards <i>Al hagefen</i>.

This is so only if the beverages were before you at the time you said the berachah over the wine or at the very least it was your intention to drink those beverages. But, if they were not before you, and it was not your intention to drink them, it is an unresolved question [among the <i>poskim</i>] if you must say a berachah on them or not. Therefore, you should refrain from drinking them [i.e., those beverages] until after you recite the after-berachah on the wine, or you may make the berachah, <i>Shehakol</i>, on some food and keep in mind to include those [late arriving] beverages.",

Therefore, you should eat any fruit<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Fruit is only an example. You may eat any solid food—e.g. candy bar, hard cheese, eggs, fish, etc. Grapes, figs and dates would not help resolve this problem since their after-berachah is not <i>Borei nefashos</i>, but <i>Al ha’eitz</i>.

Nevertheless, if you first ate the vegetables and said <i>Borei peri ha'adamah</i>, and afterwards you wanted to drink the juice, it is questionable if you have to say a berachah over it, for perhaps the berachah <i>Borei peri ha'adamah</i> exempted the juice also.

            "Preface<br><small>The <i>Torah</i> writes: <span>אִם כֶּסֶף תַּלְוֶה אֶת עַמִי אֶת הֶעֳנִי עִמָךְ לאׁ תִהְיֶה לוֹ כְּנוֹשֶׁה לאׁ תְשִׂימוּן עָלָיו נֶשֶׁךְ</span> \"When you lend money to my people, to the poor among you, do not press him for payment, do not take interest payment from him\" (Ex. 22:24).</small><small>The <i>Torah</i> obligates us to lend money to one less fortunate than we, but, at the same time, forbids us to derive benefit from making this loan. Any benefit derived thereof is called <span>רִבִּית</span>—interest.</small><small>There are two major categories of <i>ribis:</i></small><small>1) <i>Ribis deoraisa</i> (<span>רִבִּית דְאוֹרַייתָא</span>) i.e. interest that is Scripturally prohibited. The classic case is when the lender stipulates at the time of the loan that the money is being lent with the condition that it be paid back with a set rate of interest. It makes no difference how high or how low the rate may be; in either case, it is <i>ribis deoraisa</i> and the lender must return the interest payment to the borrower. This holds true even where the borrower willingly agreed to the interest payment.</small><small>2) <i>Ribis derabanan</i> (<span>רִבִּית דְרַבָּנָן</span>), i.e. interest that is Rabbinically prohibited, such as a) <i>sa'ah besa'ah</i> (see para. 11); b) <i>avak ribis</i> (<span>אֲבַק רִבִּית</span>), i.e. \"a shade of <i>ribis</i>.\" The <i>Torah</i> prohibited only interest charged for a loan. The Rabbis added a prohibition on interest charged for a purchase; c) <i>ribis mukdemes</i> (<span>רִבִּית מֻקְדֶמֶת</span>), i.e. \"pre-loan\" <i>ribis</i>. The borrower sends money or gifts to the lender so that he will lend him money at a later date; d) <i>ribis me'ucheres</i> (<span>רִבִּית מְאֻחֶרֶת</span>), i.e. \"post-loan\" <i>ribis</i>. The lender did not set interest payments at the time of the loan, but the borrower paid interest at a later date. In cases of <i>ribis derabanan</i>, the <i>Bais Din</i> [Court] does not have the power to force the lender to return the interest collected, but it is, nevertheless, preferable in some cases that he do so on his own.</small><small>The laws of <i>ribis</i> are complex and this chapter will only touch some of the fundamentals of this important subject. It is, therefore, extremely advisable that when a question of <i>ribis</i> arises, a competent rabbi, well-versed in these laws, should be consulted.</small><br>It being the nature of man to desire and lust after money, and it being more likely for man to transgress the prohibition of interest than other prohibitions concerning money, because where robbery and fraud and the like [are concerned], the victim usually protects himself against robbery or fraud. Also, one who wants to rob or defraud another, will often be inhibited because of shame or because of fear. This is not so concerning interest, for the borrower willingly pays and is happy that he has found a place to borrow even with interest. The lender, too, thinks to himself that he is doing a great favor to the borrower by enabling him to profit with this money, many times more than the interest. It is, therefore, very easy for the person to be seduced, Heaven forbid, by his evil inclination to transgress this prohibition. Therefore, the <i>Torah</i> was very stringent with this prohibition. And many prohibitary laws are said concerning it. The lender transgresses six prohibitory laws, and will not be included in the resurrection of the dead, for it is said: \"He gave money [in return] for interest and he accepted interest, he shall not live.\"<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ezekiel</i> 18: 13.</i> The borrower transgresses three prohibitory laws. The scribe,<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Who draws up the loan contract.</i> the witnesses<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Who witnesses the loan and sign the contract.</i> and the co-signer each transgress one prohibitory law. [This applies] also [to] the broker who brought them together or if he was of help to one of them, for instance, directing the borrower to one from whom he could borrow, or if he directed the lender to one to whom he could lend, he, too, transgresses one prohibitory law.",
            "One who failed [to observe this prohibition] and collected interest, is obligated to return it (except where \"pre-loan\" interest and \"after-loan\" interest [are concerned] which are discussed later in paragraph 6).",
            "Even if the lender did not stipulate [<i>ribis</i>] with the borrower at the time of the loan, but, rather, lent him [money] without charge until a specified time, or where he sold him merchandise on credit until a specified time, or where there is an obligation of payment in any other situation, for whatever reason, and when the time for payment arrives he agrees to some additional payment in order to extend the due date, this too is considered <i>ribis</i>.",
            "Even if the borrower voluntarily makes an additional payment at the time the loan is repaid, which was never stipulated and he (the borrower) does not state that he is giving it to him as interest, [this] too is prohibited.",
            "Even if the borrower tells him at the time of the <i>ribis</i> payment that he is giving it to him as a gift, it is also prohibited to accept it from him. But if he already accepted the interest from him and then the lender repents and wants to return it to the borrower, and he the (borrower) waives it to him, [then] he is permitted [to keep the interest].",
            "It is prohibited to pre-pay the <i>ribis</i> or delay it [until after the payment of the loan]. For example, <i>Reuven</i> desired to borrow money from <i>Shimon</i>, and sent him a gift in advance, explaining [that he did so] in order to obtain the loan, or if it was a substantial gift, even though nothing was said, [nevertheless,] it is as if it were explicitly stated that it was for the purpose of obtaining the loan. This constitutes <i>ribis mukdemes</i>.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Pre-loan interest.</i> If he [<i>Reuven</i>] borrowed money from him [<i>Shimon</i>] and repaid the money and then sent him a gift in consideration of the fact that [<i>Shimon's</i>] money was tied up by him during the loan period, this is <i>ribis me'ucheres</i>.<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Post-loan interest.</i>",
            "If one lends money to his friend for a specified time, [with the understanding that] [the borrower] reciprocate and lend him at another time, [either] a greater amount for the same period of time or an equivalent amount for a longer period of time, this is absolute <i>ribis</i>. [But,] if he lends him money with the condition [that the borrower] lend him at another time an equivalent amount of money for the same period of time, some say that this, too, is prohibited, and others say that it is permitted.<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The explanation of this dispute requires some elaboration. The first opinion maintains that since the original lender is repaid his money and additionally receives the benefit of a loan being made to him, he is, therefore, benefiting from the loan he originally granted and is thus collecting <i>ribis</i>. The second opinion feels that the loan granted in return for the original loan does not constitute a gain to the original lender because he must eventually repay in full, the money that he borrows.</i> It is preferable to adhere to the stringent opinion. However, if no stipulation was made, but he voluntarily lends him money at another time, despite the fact that he is doing this only because the other previously granted him a loan, in this instance one may be lenient.",
            "The lender must take care not to derive any benefit from the borrower without his permission as long as his money is in the borrower's hands. [This applies] even if it is something that he would have done for him had he not lent him [money], because since he benefits without permission, he (the lender) seems to be assuming that because his money is in (the borrower's) hands, (the borrower) will forgive him. But, when he benefits from him <i>with</i> his permission [then], it is permitted, provided it is something that he would have done for him even had he not lent him money. Another provision is that it is not widely publicized.<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To summarize: there are three requirements that enable the lender to derive benefit from the borrower while the money is yet on loan: 1) he must first receive permission from the borrower, 2) it must be a favor that the borrower would have done even if the lender had not lent him money, 3) it must be a favor that is not widely publicized.</i>",
            "If it was not the usual practice of the borrower to initiate greetings to the lender on other occasions he may not initiate them [now]. [The borrower] may not honor him with any sort of honor in the synagogue or any other place if it was not his usual practice to do so on other occasions. So, too, other types of <i>ribis</i> of words are prohibited, for it is said \"Interest of any <i>thing</i> which is interest.\"<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Deut</i>. 23: 20.</i> [The sages interpret this to include] that even verbal <i>ribis</i> is prohibited.<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew word <span>דָבָר</span> has the double meaning “thing” and also “word.”</i> <sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 75b.</i> The lender, likewise, is commanded regarding <i>ribis devorim</i>. For instance: If he says to the borrower, \"Let me know whether so-and-so arrives from such-and-such place.\" Though he bothers him only to speak a few words, if he had not been accustomed to do so before this (i.e. the loan) and now because of the loan he bids him to do so, this constitutes <i>ribis</i> because [the borrower] is obligated to him. And if you ask: \"Is it not written:'The borrower is a servant to the lender?'\"<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Proverbs</i> 22: 7—The verse seems to imply that the borrower is obligated to heed the lender’s wishes.</i> [The answer is:] the verse refers only to a situation where there is a dispute between them and the lender says, \"Let us go to the Supreme Court to adjudicate our dispute;\" and the borrower says that the dispute be heard here; then the borrower is obligated to travel to where the lender wishes; whereas there is no obligation on the lender to travel to the Supreme Court located elsewhere, for it is said: \"The borrower is a servant to the lender.\"",
            "Even advantages that are not monetary may not be derived by the lender from the borrower; for instance: if the lender is a craftsman, and it is not usual for this borrower to give him work at other times, but now, in return for the loan, he wants to give him work. This is prohibited.",
            "Preface to Paragraph 11<br><small>It was previously mentioned in the preface to this chapter that <i>ribis deoraisa</i> applies where the lender and borrower, at the time of the loan, agree to a set amount of interest to be repaid. If the rate of interest is not set, or if at the time of the loan it is uncertain whether interest will actually be paid, then this constitutes <i>ribis derabanan</i>.</small><br><small>The following paragraph discusses one aspect of <i>ribis derabanan</i>.</small><br><small>Unlike money whose value, halachically, remains constant, the value of goods and services fluctuate. This creates a problem when lending goods and services, because at the time of payment, albeit the same quantity is returned, nevertheless, the value of the said goods may have increased thereby giving the lender a profit on his loan. This kind of <i>ribis</i> is known as <span>סָאָה בְּסָאָה</span>, (<i>sa'ah be'sa'ah</i>) i.e. \"a bushel for a bushel.\" The derivation of this name stems from the situation where a bushel of grain is lent with the stipulation that a bushel be repaid. Since the repaid bushel may increase in value, this constitutes <i>ribis derabanan</i>.</small><br><small>An exception to this prohibition: If the borrower of the goods has the identical goods in his possession at the time of the loan which can potentially be used as payment at the time of the loan.</small><br>You may not lend someone a <i>sa'ah</i> of grain [with the stipulation] that he repay a <i>sa'ah</i> of grain even if they are both of the same species, because there is the possibility that, in time, the price of the grain will increase and, consequently, he will be repaying [value] greater than what he borrowed. Rather, a money valuation should be set on the grain, so that if the price of the grain increases, he will pay you only the amount of money [at which the grain was originally valued]. However, if the borrower owns even a small amount of that kind [of grain], he may borrow many <i>korim</i>.<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Kor</i> (pl. <i>korim</i>): a large measure of grain.</i> Similarly, if that particular [grain] has a set price in the marketplace, he may borrow [<i>sa'ah besa'ah</i>], even though the borrower does not possess any [grain] of that kind. All of the above applies where the same species of grain [are involved], but where two different species [are involved]; for instance, lending a <i>sa'ah</i> of wheat for a <i>sa'ah</i> of millet is prohibited under any circumstances, even if their prices are the same and [the borrower] posesses millet.<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is a great likelihood that the prices of the two grains will not stay the same, creating the possibility that the repayment will be more than the loan.</i> When [the loan is] an insignificant amount, where it is unusual to be concerned about higher or lower prices, [<i>sa'ah besa'ah</i>] it is permitted in all cases. Therefore, a woman is permitted to lend a loaf of bread to her friend.",
            "One who lends money for a mortgage [whether it be] a house, a field, or a place in the synagogue, and the lender receives the benefits from the mortgage<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e. while the loan is outstanding, the lender retains the right to make use of the mortgaged property.</i> [then] this must be done by deduction; that is, he (the lender) must deduct a set amount per year from the loan which is then considered the rental that the lender is paying.<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the lender will pay no rent then he will be gaining from this loan because aside from the repayment of the loan, he also gained the free use of the mortgaged property.</i> Even if the actual rental value is greater than what they agreed to, [nevertheless,] it is permitted.<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Because it is not uncommon to get a lower rental even when no loan is involved.</i> However, the lender may not turn around and rent [the property] to the borrower himself.<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Because the end result is that the lender gains the rental fee in addition to the repayment of the loan.</i> Concerning mortgages there are many additional laws and [therefore] nothing should be done [concerning mortgages] unless a Rabbinic authority is consulted.",

(<i>Chavos Da'as</i> writes [that \"too much\"] is a sixth or more above the accepted price), for then it is obvious to everyone that it is [in return for] awaiting payment that he is charging more. And even if he charges only slightly more, but he explicitly states: \"If you pay me immediately, then you can have it for ten but [if you want it] on credit, you must pay me eleven,\" [this is] prohibited. Similarly, if the buyer buys the goods at a higher price (in return for the seller waiting for payment) in order to sell it immediately at a loss, and to have ready cash available for a certain period of time, this, too, is prohibited.<sup>20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In effect, the buyer eventually pays a higher price to the seller for the opportunity to obtain immediate cash by selling the goods to a third party at a lower price.

            "Preface to Paragraphs 14 and 15<br><small>It is a common business practice to sell promissory notes at a discount of their face value. For example, a lender who is holding a one-hundred dollar note due in six months, is in a situation where he needs money immediately. He finds a buyer willing to buy the note—or the right to collect the money in six months—for ninety dollars. Although, what has, in effect, happened is that the buyer advanced the lender ninety dollars in return for collecting more in the future, yet no <i>ribis</i> is incurred because the money advanced is not considered a loan, but, rather, a bona fide sale where the buyer has bought the rights to \"become the lender.\"</small><br><small>It, therefore, follows that if it is stipulated that the seller retains all responsibilities for collecting the loan and if, for any reason, the borrower does not pay, the seller will be obligated to pay the buyer the one hundred dollars—in that case the ninety dollars paid is nothing but a loan with a promise that one hundred dollars will be repaid. Of course, this constitutes <i>ribis</i>.</small><br>One who has a promissory note against his friend, may sell it to another for less,<sup>21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Less than the face value.</i> even [before it is] due.

            "The following scenario is permitted: For example, <i>Reuven</i> needs money [during the month of] Nissan, and goes to <i>Shimon</i>, and <i>Shimon</i> gives him a promissory note obligating himself to pay to <i>Reuven</i> one hundred gold coins in the month of <i>Tishri</i>.<sup>25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One may obligate himself, despite the fact that no loan has actually taken place.</i> (In response, <i>Reuven</i>, gives such a promissory note to <i>Shimon</i>, that is obligating himself to pay him one hundred gold coins in <i>Tishri</i>, so that <i>Shimon</i> will be reassured).<sup>26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Having given a promissory note to <i>Reuven, Shimon</i> is vulnerable to an unscrupulous act of <i>Reuven</i>, i.e. <i>Reuven</i> may use this promissory note to collect money from <i>Shimon</i> that he never actually lent him.</i> <i>Reuven</i> now goes and sells the promissory note that he has against <i>Shimon</i> to <i>Levi</i>, in <i>Nissan</i> for ninety gold coins.

            "It is prohibited to buy grain or any other item by paying money in advance while the grain will be delivered at a future date, because it is possible that in the interim the grain price will increase by the time the delivery is made, resulting in the buyer getting more than [the value of] his money, because he advanced the money. However, if the seller now has in his possession all the grain that he is selling, though he will not deliver it to the buyer until a later date, it is, nevertheless, permitted, because a man may sell whatever he possesses at a very reduced price if he sees fit to do so.<sup>30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the grain is now ready for delivery and the buyer could actually take possession of it now, then the increase in the value of the grain is not of benefit to him.

Regarding the transaction, it is considered completed and is permitted. If, however, it lacks three processes it is prohibited.<sup>31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If there is still much left to be done to complete the grain’s process, it cannot be considered as already available for delivery, hence the increase in value cannot be construed as taking place in the buyer’s possession.

            "If the market price for grain has been set, one may buy at the market price by advancing money, though the seller does not possess any [grain]; for, even if the price of grain increases afterwards, the buyer derives no profit from his advanced payment, since he could have bought the grain then with his money at the current price. Since the transaction was made according to <i>halakhah</i>, even though there was an increase in the price of grain at the time of payment and the seller does not wish to deliver the grain that was agreed upon, the buyer is permitted to assess substitute goods to be delivered [at a later date];<sup>32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A new agreement may be formulated transferring the obligation to other goods at the present price of the grain.

If he collects from the <i>areiv</i>, then the <i>areiv</i> has the right to be reimbursed from the borrower. Here, the borrower is considered to have borrowed from the <i>areiv</i>.

This (the 1–1/4 hours before night) is called <i>pelag haminchah</i> (lit. half of the <i>Minchah</i>), because from the time of <i>Minchah ketanah</i> until nightfall two and one-half hours elapse; half of this is one hour and one quarter.

It is advisable to begin sleeping on the left side and finish on the right side; this is beneficial for one's health because the liver is located on the right side and the stomach on the left, and when leaning on the left the liver rests on the stomach and warms it with its heat thereby facilitating the speedy digestion of food. After the food has been digested it is advisable to turn on the right side so that the stomach rests and cause the waste to pass, and you should not turn from side to side too often [during the night] (The laws of modesty will be explained, if God so wills, in Chapter 150)."

This will cause the top coals to be <i>extinguished</i> and the bottom ones to be <i>ignited</i> which are both <i>melachos</i> that are prohibited on Shabbos.

Since you do not desire the extinguishing and igniting of the coals, it is only a <i>shvus</i> and is permitted through a non-Jew.

            "Cooked food [may be] placed in the oven [on Friday] to be eaten on Shabbos, as is our custom.<sup>92</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cholent, etc.</i> Even though the door is not sealed with mortar, it is permitted.<sup>93</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Halachos</i> of <i>hatmanah</i> are numerous. The following is a brief introduction that will enable you to understand these important laws. There are two concepts, one called <span>שִׁהְיֶה</span>, <i>shehiyah</i> which means leaving food [on the fire, or in an oven, etc.], and <span>הַטְמָנָה</span>, <i>hatmanah</i>, which means “hiding,” in other words, covering the pot to keep it warm. There is a Rabbinical prohibition against leaving certain food on open coals because then you might stir the coals on Shabbos. <i>Tosafos</i> and <i>Rosh</i> rule that this prohibition is applicable even on <i>Erev Shabbos</i> and thus food may not be left on coals over Shabbos unless it is completely cooked. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 253:1 seems to agree, but we are accustomed to follow <i>Rashi’s</i> ruling and permit this on <i>Erev Shabbos</i> if it is half cooked, (or one third if need be), which makes it fit to be eaten with difficulty. The <i>Biur Halachah</i> says that it is preferable to be stringent in this matter. In our times we use gas or electric heat, but the prohibition remains, for you are liable to adjust the flame. In the case of a range, you are allowed to put up the meat <i>cholent</i> on <i>Erev Shabbos</i> even if it will be only slightly cooked when Shabbos arrives, if you remove all the coals (which is called <span>גְרֵיפָה</span>, <i>gerifah</i>) or you cover the coals (which is called <span>קְטִימָה</span>, <i>ketimah</i>). For this reason we use a <span>בְּלֶע</span> (<i>blech</i>) to cover both the flame and the knobs, (see <i>Igros Moshe</i> [<i>Orach Chaim, Responsum</i> 93]) since this makes the range <span>קְטוּמָה</span> (<i>Ketumah</i>). However, <i>Rav Akiva Eiger</i> ruled, that <i>ketumah</i> is not sufficient if the food is not at least half-cooked before Shabbos. See <i>Biur Halachah</i> 253. Also see <i>Sha’arei Teshuvah</i> 254: 5 that a metal sheet (<i>blech</i>) does not make it <i>ketumah</i>. If the meat is totally raw, you may put it up to cook immediately before Shabbos and we are not concerned that you will stir the coals. Since the meat was totally raw at the onset of Shabbos, it will be left untouched all night. [Rav Henkin z” l ruled that in our times it is best not to rely on this as our ovens are more efficient and that meat will be partially cooked by the time it is actually Shabbos according to <i>Rabbeinu Tam</i> who rules that <i>Shabbos</i> begins 72 minutes after sunset.] Even putting in one piece of totally raw meat immediately before Shabbos, qualifies the rest of the pot (at whatever stage of cooking it may be) [<i>Shulchan Aruch Harav</i>]. If you put the pot into the oven on <i>Erev Shabbos</i>, and seal the oven door with mortar, there is no concern that you will stir the coals because it is sealed. [<i>Rema</i> and most <i>Poskim</i> and <i>Kitzur</i>.] Even if food is totally cooked on Erev Shabbos, but will improve with shrinking in prolonged heat, (which is called <span>מִצְטַמֵק וְיָפֶה לוֹ</span> —it shrinks and is improved thereby), according to <i>Tosafos</i>, you may not leave it on a range that is not <span>גְרוּפֶה</span> or <span>קְטוּמָה</span>. As mentioned, it is preferable to be stringent in this matter if you can. Also, see <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 253: 70–73.</i> However, it is forbidden to open the oven at night, for there may be food which is not thoroughly cooked, and by closing the oven afterwards you will cause the cooking to be accelerated.",
            "The law which permits us to place cooked food in the oven even when the oven door is not sealed with mortar applies only to meat, and also to various kinds of legumes [peas, etc.], and also to various types of dough, provided you put them in the oven a long time before nightfall, so that the food will be cooked a little before nightfall, until it reaches the stage when it can be eaten with difficulty.<sup>94</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is one half or one third cooked. This is called <i>ma’achal ben Derusai</i>, the food of a gang of bandits who always ate on the run.</i> But if you place legumes or types of dough in the oven close to nightfall you must seal the oven door with mortar.<sup>95</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The difference being since meat takes a long time to cook, it will be left untouched till tomorrow, and there is no need to stir the coals, whereas legumes and doughs take less time to cook, and we fear that he will stir the coals to make it edible for Friday night [<i>Poskim, Magein Avraham</i> etc.].</i> (For probably the coals were not removed or were not covered and cooled with ashes properly.) You must be careful about this; for if you failed to do this, the food is forbidden even <i>bediavad</i> (post factum) until after Shabbos,<sup>96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">[<i>Shulchan Aruch Harav</i>] You and your family may not eat it even when it was done without intent, but others may eat it even on Shabbos if it was done without intent.</i> until enough time has elapsed to accomplish what was done (on Shabbos)",

However, substances which do not add but merely retain heat are permitted on <i>Erev Shabbos</i> for Shabbos. But on Shabbos you may not make <i>hatmanah</i> even in such substances [<i>Rashi</i>.

See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 257: 8.</i> this too is forbidden. You must do it in such a way that the pot of coffee is inserted so that only one half or one third is in the sand, and the remainder exposed to the air (in the hole). You may then place a board or inverted vessel to cover the hole so that there is air space<sup>101</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 257: 8.</i> between it (the cover) and the pot of coffee.

            "It is forbidden to allow a non-Jew to do work for you on Shabbos. They (the Sages)<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Virtually all Poskim agree that telling a non-Jew to do work for you on Shabbos is a Rabbinical prohibition.</i> based this on the verse:<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Exodus</i> 12: 16.</i> \"No manner of work should be done,\" which implies (not) even through a non-Jew.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Beis Yosef</i> 244, <i>Semag</i>, and <i>Rashi, Exodus</i> 12: 16.

Also see <i>Rashi</i> (<i>Maseches Avodah Zarah</i> 15a).</i> If you<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Directly.</i> give the work to the non-Jew on Friday even though the non-Jew does it on Shabbos, it is permissible, But only on these conditions: a) the non-Jew must take the article from the house of the Jew before Shabbos and not on Shabbos.<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the need is great and the non-Jew came on Friday night, after dark, to take the article you may give it to him [see <i>Biur Halachah</i> 252: 1].</i>",

Therefore, if you have a non-Jewish servant for a pre-determined period of time, it is forbidden to allow him to do any work for you on Shabbos,<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This holds true even when he does not do the work in your house and even when you did not tell him to do it. Some say you must protest his doing it in your house even when he is doing it for himself (<i>Taz</i>). <i>Eliyahu Rabbah</i> permits it when he does it for himself. <i>Chayei Adam</i> permits it when he does something that is obviously for his own benefit. See <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 244: 30, see <i>Kitzur</i> paragraph 8 and footnote 19.</i> because then the work is done solely for the benefit of the Jew. If a non-Jew travels to a certain place and a Jew gives him a letter to carry there, which he will carry on Shabbos, the Jew must give him some compensation,<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Chayei Adam</i> (<i>kelal</i> 3: 11) permits mailing letters on <i>Erev Shabbos</i>.

Similarly, if you give him a letter and tell him, \"See to it that it is delivered there on such and such day,\" and it is clearly impossible, unless he travels on Shabbos; this too is prohibited.

Also see <i>Rashi</i> (<i>Maseches Yoma</i> 70a).</i> which indicates a later time (in the day).

            "If you must pray two prayer services, the <i>Minchah</i> service, and the <i>Mussaf</i> service, for example if you delayed praying <i>mussaf</i> until six and a half hours, you should first pray <i>Minchah</i> and after that <i>Mussaf</i>, because <i>Minchah</i> is recited more regularly [daily], and it is an established rule: that when a regular practice conflicts with an occasional practice, the regular practice takes precedence.<sup>33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Maseches Zevachim</i> (90a).</i> However, in congregational prayers, this rule is not followed.<sup>34</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Rambam</i>.

            "If, Heaven forbid, a fire breaks out on Shabbos, our Sages were concerned that the head of the household and his family [who are] in the vicinity of the fire, will be occupied with rescuing their belongings. They will be hasty and panicky at the prospect of losing their valuables, and, as a result, forget that it is Shabbos, and they might extinguish the fire. They, therefore, forbade rescuing even objects that are [normally] permitted to be handled. They forbid even to move them to a place where it is permitted to carry. Only that which is needed for the day is permitted to be rescued.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Some argue that this prohibition applies only where the salvaged objects are carried to your neighbor’s unroofed yard which borders a public domain, for there is concern that you may also carry into a public domain. But to your own yard or friend’s house you may salvage all the food and items you are able to. (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 334: 11)<br><i>Mishnah Berurah</i> rules that you may be lenient since the prohibition involved is only Rabbinic. <i>Shulchan Aruch Harav</i>, however, rules that you must be stringent.</i> For instance: If a fire broke out on Shabbos eve before the [Shabbos] meal, you may rescue [enough] food for three meals, [food] fit for humans—for humans,<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Enough for three meals for each member of your household [<i>Biur Halachah</i> 334: 1]</i> [food] fit for animals—for animals.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since you yourself may not eat before feeding your animals.

If one vessel contains much food [i.e. more than you need], for example, a basket full of breads, or a barrel full of wine<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Otherwise you may rescue only enough wine for three meals. You may rescue other liquids to have a sufficient amount for the entire day.

Similarly, if you spread a sheet or something similar, and gather into it everything you can remove, even quantities of food and drink, and you remove them all at once, it is permissible.<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to some this applies to “loose” food, not in containers.

However, if it can possibly be done in an unusual manner, or by a non-Jew, it should be done.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Though her situation is critical, a woman in confinement is part of the normal pattern in life. Therefore, it is preferable, where possible, to do the <i>melachos</i> in an unusual manner or have a non-Jew do them.</i> She is considered \"a woman at childbirth\" when seated on the birthing-stool,<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Or delivery table.</i> or as soon as there is a flow of blood,<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Or waterflow.</i> or if she doesn't have the strength to walk on her own. Also a woman who has miscarried more than forty days after having immersed herself [in a <i>mikveh</i>] has the classification of a \"woman at childbirth.\"<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 330: 3; <i>Biur Halachah</i> 617.</i>",
            "During the entire first three days,<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">After giving birth.</i> even if she says that it is unnecessary, Shabbos may be violated for her.<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In order to attend her needs. [<i>Mishnah Berurah</i>]</i> Afterwards, if she has no other illness, but only the [usual] pain that follows childbirth, the rule is as follows: then, up to seven days, if she says: \"I require it,\" [Shabbos] may be violated for her sake,<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Regardless whether the doctors agree or disagree. [<i>Mishnah Berurah</i>]</i> and if she says it is unnecessary then it is not violated.<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Unless the doctors say that she requires something. [<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 330: 14]</i> The days referred to are counted from the day of the birth and [they do] not [have to be three] twenty-four-hour periods. For example: if she gave birth Wednesday in the late afternoon, then on Shabbos it is considered more than three days [since the birth],<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e. from the end of the birth. Notwithstanding that less than seventy-two hours have passed. The author bases this ruling on the opinion of the <i>Magein Avraham</i>. See <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (330: 10).</i> and if she gave birth Shabbos in the late afternoon then, the following Shabbos, it is considered more than seven days. If there is the slightest possibility of danger, because the woman is weak by nature, [then] one who is lenient, and counts full 24-hour days, is not considered wrong.<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e. is not considered to have transgressed in any manner.</i>",
            "Once seven days have passed, even if she says: \"I require [something],\" [Shabbos] may not be violated for her, but she is considered a non-critical patient until thirty days, and all her needs may be done [only] by a non-Jew. However, even a Jew may heat the house for her if a non-Jew is not readily available, even in mid-summer,<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If she says she feels cold.</i> because a woman in confinement is considered critical for the first thirty days, as regards being cold.",
            "The newly-born infant may be washed. His umbilical cord may be cut, his limbs straightened, and all his needs may be attended. However, if he cannot survive, for example: he was born in the eighth month,<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Today, an infant born in the eighth month is considered the same as other infants. <i>Chazon Ish, Rabbi S. Z. Auerbach</i>.</i> he may not be handled, but his mother may bend over him and nurse him because of her pain caused by her milk."

order to carry in the alley, many requirements must be fulfilled. The <i>halachos</i> are complex and not discussed in the <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i>. However, mention is made of partnership in the alley. This is achieved when all the inhabitants of the courtyard that exit into the alley jointly make a special eiruv, the details of which are not discussed in the <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i>, but at times will be referred to in the footnotes.</small><br>Two or more Jews who reside in one courtyard, each living in his own apartment, are forbidden to carry<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a Rabbinic decree enacted by King Solomon and his Court for fear that a person will carry out from a private domain to a public domain. [<i>Tur</i> 366] See <i>Maseches Eiruvin</i> 21a; <i>Rambam, Eiruvin</i> 1: 2 and <i>Bach</i> 366—<i>Rav Hai Gaon</i>.</i> from the house into the courtyard, or from the courtyard into the house. It is also forbidden to carry from<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A common application of this rule is that it is forbidden to carry from your apartment into the hall of the apartment building if there is another Jew living in that building, unless you make an <i>eiruv chatzeiros</i>.</i> one house into the other, even without passing through the courtyard, as for example, when there is a door or a window between one house and the other house.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even through a non-Jew except for a <i>mitzvah</i> or for indispensable Shabbos needs. [<i>Avkas Rochel</i> (29)]</i> It is a mitzvah for them to make an <i>eiruvei chatzeiros</i>, so that they do not fall into transgression.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e. of carrying from a private domain to a public domain.</i>",
            "When two courtyards have a door between them, if they wish, all the tenants of each courtyard may make a separate <i>eiruv</i>, whereby all the tenants of the courtyard are permitted to carry into their own courtyard; but any vessels that were in the house before Shabbos began,<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">But vessels that were in the court at the beginning of Shabbos may be carried from one court into the other. [<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 372: 13]</i> are forbidden to be carried from one courtyard into the other.<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If you did take out an article from a house to the court without an <i>eiruv</i> you may not move the article four <i>amos</i> in the court. See <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 372: 16 and <i>Biur Halachah</i>.</i> If they wish, all the tenants of both courtyards can make one <i>eiruv</i> jointly, in order that they should be allowed to carry, from one courtyard into the other, even such vessels that were in the house when Shabbos began. And if there is even a window between the courtyards that measures no less than four <i>tefachim</i> wide by four <i>tefachim</i> high,<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Four by four square. If the window is round it must be large enough so that a four by four [<i>tefachim</i>] square can be inscribed in it. That puts the diameter of the window at 5 3/5 <i>tefachim</i>. See <i>Sha’ar Hatziyun</i> 372: 18—<i>Rambam</i> etc.</i> and it is within ten<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Part of it has to be within ten <i>tefachim</i>. That part must be four <i>tefachim</i> wide. [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 372: 4, <i>Eliyahu Rabbah, Mishnah Berurah</i>]</i> <i>tefachim</i> above the ground, and it has no grate,<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Rema</i> 372: 5. There must be an unobstructed empty space of four by four <i>tefachim</i>. [<i>Mishnah Berurah</i>— <i>Acharonim</i>]</i> [the tenants of both courtyards] may also make a joint <i>eiruv</i>. But if it is less than that, they cannot make a joint <i>eiruv</i>. If there is a window between two houses, even if it is higher than ten <i>tefachim</i>, they can make a joint <i>eiruv</i>, (because the house is considered as filled).<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And thus the window is not considered to be ten <i>tefachim</i> high. [<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 372: 34]</i>",
            "[If there are] two courtyards, one behind the other, and the tenants of the inner courtyard have no other exit to the street than through the outer courtyard, if [the tenants of both courts] wish to do so, they may make a joint <i>eiruv</i>. If they did not make a joint <i>eiruv</i>, then if the tenants of the inner court alone made an <i>eiruv</i>, they are permitted to carry in their own court and the tenants of the outer court are forbidden<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Because they did not make an <i>eiruv</i>.</i> [to carry]. If the tenants of the inner court did not make an <i>eiruv</i>, but the tenants of the outer court alone made an <i>eiruv</i>, then the <i>eiruv</i> is of no use to them, because, since the tenants of the inner court have a right of passage through the outer court, they prohibit the tenants of the outer court [from carrying in their own court]. This is true only if the people of the inner court did not make an <i>eiruv</i>. For then, since they forbid one another [to carry] in their own place (court), it is \"a foot (referring to the person) which is forbidden [to carry] in its own place,\" and a \"foot forbidden in its place\" forbids [others] also in another place. But if they made an <i>eiruv</i> by themselves, and they are allowed to carry in their own court, then it constitutes \"a foot permitted [to carry] in its own place,\" and they do not forbid carrying even to the tenants of the outer court. Consequently, if there is only one Jewish tenant in the inner court, since he is not forbidden to carry in his own court, he cannot cause a prohibition to be imposed [on the tenants of the outer court]. If two tenants live in the inner court and they did not make an <i>eiruv</i>, even though only one tenant lives in the outer court, since they are \"a foot forbidden in its own place,\" they also forbid the single tenant.<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 378.</i>",
            "When houses are built with a second story, and a balcony in front of them, from which the tenants go into the courtyard through a stairway, and from the courtyard into the public domain, they are govorned by the same [laws] that apply to two courts, one behind the other, and the balcony is considered as the inner court.<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 375: 1. This is true only if the balcony is ten <i>tefachim</i> higher than the yard. If not, they are considered as one court and no separate <i>eiruv</i> can be made for each.</i>",
            "A house that has two apartments with a lobby through which you enter both apartments, and the apartments are occupied by two tenants, they are forbidden to carry anything even from their apartments into the lobby. Similarly, even if one apartment is divided into two rooms occupied by two tenants, even though the occupant of the inner room has no other exit than through the outer room, which leads into the courtyard, nevertheless, they may not carry anything, even from one room into the other until they make an <i>eiruv</i>. (If the two houses or apartments belong to one person, and he rented an apartment to someone, and he also has \"a hold<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tefisas yad</i>, “having a hold on the apartment,” means that the landlord stored articles in the apartment that are either too heavy to move or forbidden to be moved on Shabbos because they are <i>muktzeh</i>. See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, 370: 2.</i> on the apartment,\"<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Having a hold on the apartment gives the occupant the <i>halachah</i> of a guest which is discussed in paragraph 14.</i> see <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 370 and <i>Chayei Adam</i> 73: 3–4.)",
            "How do you make an <i>eiruv?</i> The mitzvah done to perfection is for one of the tenants of the courtyard, to take one whole loaf<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bread is required because <i>eiruvei chatzeiros</i> makes the place of the <i>eiruv</i> your place of dwelling. Only bread will serve this purpose. [<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 386: 3] You may not make an <i>eiruv chatzeiros</i> with a piece of bread, even a large one; you must use a whole one. [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 366: 6]</i> of his own bread on <i>erev Shabbos</i> and confer a share of it, through another person, to all the tenants of that court. This is done by saying to that other person, in any language he understands, as follows: \"Take this loaf and acquire it on behalf of all the Jews who live in this courtyard, (or in these courtyards).\" This person then takes the loaf and raises it one <i>tefach</i>.<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 366: 9 and <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 366: 51.</i> Then the one who is making the <i>eiruv</i> takes it from him and<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Bi’ur Halachah</i>.</i> recites the <i>berachah, Baruch atah Adonai Elokeinu melech ha'olam asher kiddeshanu bemitzvosav vetzivanu al mitzvas eiruv</i>.<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even if he did not say the <i>berachah</i>, the <i>eiruv</i> is valid and carrying is permitted. [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 366: 15]</i> [\"Blessed are You, Hashem, our God, King of the Universe, Who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us concerning the mitzvah of <i>eiruv</i>].\" He then says, \"By means of this <i>eiruv</i> it will be permissible for us to take out and to bring in from the houses into the courtyard and from the courtyard into the houses and from one house into another, for all the Jews who live in the houses of the courtyard.\"<sup>20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even if he did not say this, it also becomes a valid <i>eiruv</i> (see <i>Shulchan Aruch Harav</i> 366) but if he said only part of it and not all of it the <i>Peri Megadim</i> (M.Z. 366: 7) says that it may not be a valid <i>eiruv</i>.</i> Since they all acquired a share in this loaf, and at the beginning of Shabbos it is in the house<sup>21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The place where it is must be no less than four <i>amos</i> by four <i>amos</i>.

The peel with which this matzah was taken out of the oven is forbidden to be used for baking matzos.

(<i>Ibid.</i> 473:53,56)</i> Each dips his portion in salt water and says the berachah <i>Borei peri ha'adamah</i> \"Who creates the fruit of the ground.\" They should have in mind to exempt the <i>maror</i> which will be eaten later with this berachah, and while eating the <i>karpas</i>, they should also recline on the left side.<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Mishnah Berurah</i> does not mention the rule that the <i>karpas</i> should be eaten in a reclining position.</i> The person who leads the Seder then takes the middle matzah and breaks it into two parts, placing the larger part near his seat for the <i>afikoman</i>. It is customary to wrap the <i>afikoman</i> in a napkin,<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When using a cloth napkin, care must be taken that the napkin was not starched in laundering. (<i>Ibid.</i> 473:59)</i> to recall what is written, \"Their leftover dough was wrapped in their clothes\" (Exodus 12:34). Some people place it on their shoulders, to recall the Exodus. Since the <i>afikoman</i> takes the place of the <i>Pesach</i> sacrifice, it is most esteemed, and the larger portion of the matzah is set aside for it. The smaller portion, is put back on the <i>seder</i> plate. He then uncovers the matzos slightly, lifts the <i>seder</i> plate, and all declare <i>Ha lachma anya diachalu</i>,<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This declaration should be said in a loud voice. (<i>Ibid.</i> 473:61)</i> \"This is the bread of affliction, which our forefathers ate etc. to <i>leshanah haba'ah benei chorin</i>, \"Next year we shall be free men.\" Those who say, <i>Keha lachma anya</i> (<i>keha</i> instead of <i>ha</i>), \"Such as this bread of affliction,\" should omit the word <i>di</i> (which).",
            "The second cup is now filled, and a child asks: <i>Mah nishtanah</i> \"Why is this night different.\" If there is no child present, then an older son or daughter should ask, or a friend or your wife should ask.<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If there is no one present, you must ask these questions of yourself.

(<i>Ibid.</i> 473:62,63)</i> the contents of the <i>Haggadah</i> in the language they understand.<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It should be explained in language, that will be understood by the women and children, as they too are obligated to fulfill the mitzvah of relating the story of the Exodus from Egypt. (<i>Ibid.</i> 473:64)</i> If you do not understand Hebrew, you should use a <i>Haggadah</i> with a translation, and after completing each paragraph, you should repeat from the translation, and particularly, the declaration, <i>Rabban Gamliel hayah omeir</i> (Rabban Gamliel used to say,) because it is essential to understand the reasons for the <i>Pesach</i> sacrifice, matzah and <i>maror</i>. At <i>Vehi she'amedah</i> (this promise) etc. you should cover the matzos (so that the matzah is not slighted when it seems that we are ignoring it, by lifting only the cup of wine). All take their cups in their hands and say, <i>Vehi she'amedah</i>, to <i>miyadam</i>, (from their hands), when you again uncover the matzos. When you say <i>Matzah zo</i> (this matzah) etc., you should take the half matzah from the <i>seder</i> plate, and show it to the family and say, <i>Matzah zo</i> (this matzah etc.). When saying <i>Maror zeh</i> (this <i>maror</i>), you should lift the <i>maror</i>. However, when saying <i>Pesach shehayu avoseinu ochelim</i> (the <i>Pesach</i> offering which our fathers ate etc.), you should not raise the shankbone, which is a reminder of the <i>Pesach</i> offering, for it might appear as if you had set it apart for a <i>Pesach</i> offering, (which can only be done in the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>). When saying, <i>Lefichach</i> (Therefore), you should cover the matzos, and each person takes his cup in his hand and raises it, holding it until concluding with <i>Ga'al Yisrael</i>, (Who redeemed Israel). Everyone then says the berachah, <i>Borei peri hagafen</i>, over their cup of wine, and drink the cup, while reclining on the left side.",
            "After that, everyone should wash their hands, and say the berachah, <i>Al netilas yadayim</i>, and <i>Hamotzi</i> over the matzos. Since on Yom Tov, we must say <i>Hamotzi</i> over two whole loaves of bread, and the mitzvah of matzah requires that we eat the broken one, because matzah is called \"poor man's bread,\" and a poor man generally eats broken pieces of bread, therefore, when saying <i>Hamotzi</i>, you should take the two whole matzos in your hands and the broken one between them, and recite <i>Hamotzi</i>. You then put down the bottom matzah,<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">You should, simply, allow the bottom matzah to slip from your hands (rather than putting it down). (<i>Ibid.</i> 475:2)</i> holding only the top, and the broken middle matzah, and say the berachah, <i>Al achilat matzah</i>. You then break off a piece the size of a <i>kazayis</i>, from the top matzah and from the broken middle matzah.<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">You should break off a <i>kazayis</i> of each matzah, simultaneously. (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 475:1)</i> You distribute the same quantity to every member of the family. Then you eat both pieces simultaneously,<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is the consensus of the later <i>Poskim,</i> that it is not necessary to swallow both pieces, simultaneously. So long as you chew them together, you can swallow each <i>kazayis</i> individually. If you find this too difficult, you can swallow each <i>kazayis</i> a little at a time, so long as you consume both <i>kazeisim</i> within the time span of <i>kedei achilas peras</i> (<span>כְּדֵי אֲכִילַת פְּרַס</span>) (See Glossary). (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 475:9)</i> while reclining on the left side.<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If you did not recline, you should, at least, eat another <i>kazayis</i> while reclining. (<i>Ibid.</i> 472:22)</i> If it is difficult for you to eat both pieces of matzah at the same time, you should first eat the <i>kazayis</i> piece over which you said <i>Hamotzi</i>, and then eat the <i>kazayis</i> piece from the broken matzah. But you should not pause between eating the two pieces, and eat both pieces while reclining. It is the custom in our region, at the <i>seder</i>, not to dip the matzah in salt; neither the matzah, over which <i>Hamotzi</i> is said, nor the one over which <i>Al achilas matzah</i> is said.",
            "If someone is unable to chew the matzah, he is permitted to soak it in water<sup>20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is also permitted to have the matzah ground up, so long as it equals a <i>kazayis</i> of unbroken matzo. (<i>Biyur Halachah</i> 461:4)</i> to soften it,<sup>21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This leniency applies only when a whole matzah is soaked in one piece, but if it is broken into pieces and then soaked until the water becomes discolored from the matzah, it cannot be used to fulfill the mitzvah, as it is no longer considered bread. These rules applies only to soaking, but if the matzah was boiled, or soaked in boiling water, it is not permissible under any circumstances. (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 461:17,18,20)</i> provided it is not completely mashed. An elderly or sick person, who cannot eat matzah, when soaked in water, may soak it in wine, or in any other beverage.<sup>22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A healthy, young person cannot fulfill his obligation, if the matzah was soaked in any liquid, except water. (<i>Ibid.</i> 461:18)</i> When you soak the matzah, with which you want to fulfill the mitzvah (of eating matzah), you must be careful not to soak it for twenty-four hours, for it would then be considered as if it were cooked and you could not fulfill the mitzvah with it. You must also be careful, in other respects, that the matzah should not lose its status as bread. See Chapter 48:5 above.",

You dip it in the <i>charoses</i>, and shake off the <i>charoses</i>, so that the <i>maror</i> should not lose its taste, and say the berachah, <i>Al achilas maror</i>, and eat it<sup>24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See note 18.</i> <i>without</i> reclining.<sup>25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>maror</i> recalls our slavery, and is, therefore, not eaten in a leisurely manner.</i> You then take a <i>kazayis</i> from the bottom matzah and a <i>kazayis maror</i>. It is also proper to dip (this <i>maror</i>) in <i>charoses</i> and shake it off. You then place the <i>maror</i> between (two pieces of) matzah and say, <i>Kein asa Hillel</i> (This is the way Hillel did it) etc.<sup>26</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Mishnah Berurah</i> questions the custom of reciting this sentence, as it constitutes an interruption between the berachah and the eating.

Since the mitzvah of eating <i>maror</i> is in our days a rabbinical requirement, therefore, a person, who finds it difficult to eat <i>maror</i>, may rely on this (more lenient) opinion, and eat a little less than one third of an egg, and say the berachah over it. A person who is sick and cannot eat <i>maror</i> at all, should, nevertheless, chew a little of any of the species, with which the mitzvah of <i>maror</i> may be fulfilled, or any bitter tasting herb, until he feels a bitter taste in his mouth; just as a token, without saying a berachah.",
            "After that the meal begins. It is proper to eat the entire meal<sup>29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nevertheless, if you reclined only while eating the matzah and drinking the Four Cups of wine, you have fulfilled your obligation. (<i>Ibid.</i> 472:23)</i> while reclining It is customary to eat eggs. It is wise to use good judgment, and not overeat, so that you will be able to eat the <i>afikoman</i>, as required, (with appetite), and not on a full stomach.<sup>30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If you are so full that any more eating is abhorent, and you eat the <i>Afikoman</i> in such a condition, you have not fulfilled your obligation.

It is proper to eat two <i>kazeisim</i> (of matzah for the <i>afikoman</i>), one to remind us of the <i>Pesach</i> sacrifice, and the other to recall the matzah that was eaten with the <i>korban Pesach</i> . At any rate, you should not eat less than a <i>kazayis</i>, and you should eat the <i>afikoman</i>, while reclining. After eating the <i>afikoman</i>, it is forbidden to eat anything.<sup>33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Our Sages ordained this rule, so that the taste of matzo remains with you. If you forgot and did eat something else, you must eat another <i>kazayis</i> of matzo for the <i>afikoman</i>. (<i>Ibid.</i> 476:1)</i> <sup>34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">You are permitted to drink water. Some <i>Poskim</i> also permit tea. Other drinks, however, that are tasty or sharp, that would remove the taste of matzah are forbidden. (<i>Ibid.</i> 478:2, 481:1)</i> The third cup is then filled for <i>Birkas Hamazon</i>. You must make sure that it is clean, not containing leftover wine, that is to say, nothing is left from the wine, in which matzah may have been soaked during the meal. If it is not clean, it requires washing and rinsing (See Chapter 45:4 above). It is a mitzvah to make an effort to recite <i>Birkas Hamazon</i> with <i>zimun</i> (three males), but you should not go from house to house to look for people required for <i>zimun</i>, because each person is required to say <i>Birkas Hamazon</i> in the place where he has eaten. It is customary for the master of the house to lead the <i>zimun</i><sup>35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He takes precedence even over a guest, who is usually accorded the privilege of leading the <i>zimun</i>. (<i>Ibid.</i> 479:13)</i> as it is said: \"A man of a good eye shall bless,\" (Proverbs 22:9) (see Ch. 45:5) and he is called, \"A man of good eye,\" (i.e. a generous person) because he said: \"All who are hungry—let them come and eat\" etc. After <i>Birkas Hamazon</i>, the berachah is said over the third cup, and you should drink it while reclining. It is forbidden to drink between this cup and the fourth cup.",
            "After <i>Birkas Hamazon</i>, the fourth cup is filled. It is the custom to open the door, to remind us that tonight is a night of Divine vigil, and we are not afraid of anything. In the merit of our faith in Hashem, our righteous <i>Mashiach</i> will come, and the Holy One, blessed is He, will pour out his anger on the nations. Therefore, we recite <i>Shefoch chamasecha</i> (Pour out Your anger) etc. After that, we say, <i>Lo lanu</i> (Not for us) and continue reciting the <i>Hallel</i>. When we reach <i>Hodu</i> (Give thanks), if there are three people present, even if they are his wife and children, who have reached the age of training for mitzvos, the leader should say <i>Hodu</i>, and the other two people respond, as it is done in the synagogue. You are required to drink a full revi's<sup>36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">You must do this, in order to be able to recite the after-berachah over the wine; for if you drink less, it is questionable if you should recite the berachah.

After the fourth cup, it is forbidden to drink any beverage, except water.<sup>38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See note 34.</i> If you are not too sleepy, you should say <i>Shir hashirim</i> after the <i>Hagadah</i>. It is customary not to say the bedtime <i>Shema</i>, except for the section of <i>Shema</i> and the berachah <i>Hamapil</i>, to indicate that it is a night of divine vigil when Hashem protects us from all evil, and we need no other protection.",

However, such a person may dilute the wine with water, or drink raisin wine, (see Chapter 50:6 above), or he may drink mead, if these are the \"beverage of the country\"",
            "If the <i>afikoman</i> was lost, and you still have matzah left of those that were made specifically for the mitzvah, you should eat a <i>kazayis</i> of that matzah, otherwise, you should eat a <i>kazayis</i> of any other matzah.",

And even though you had not intended to eat anymore, this does not constitute a diversion of the mind, since it is your duty to eat the <i>afikoman</i>, and are sitting at Hashem's table, (and must fulfill His will; thus you were not completely distracted). Nevertheless, you should wash your hands, without saying <i>Al netilas yadayim</i>. But if you did not remind yourself, until after saying <i>Birkas Hamazon</i>, before saying <i>Borei peri hagafen</i> over the third cup, then you should wash your hands again, without saying, <i>Al netilas yadayim</i>, and recite the berachah of <i>Hamotzi</i>, eat a <i>kazayis</i> of the <i>afikoman</i>, say <i>Birkas Hamazon;</i> then say the berachah over the third cup, and drink it. But if you only reminded yourself after saying <i>Borei peri hagafen</i> over the third cup, you should drink the cup. If on other occasions you are accustomed to recite <i>Birkas Hamazon</i>, without a cup of wine, you should wash your hands, eat the <i>afikoman</i>, and say <i>Birkas Hamazon</i> without a cup of wine. However, if you are scrupulous, and always says <i>Birkas Hamazon</i>, over a cup of wine, and now cannot do it, because you would be adding to the four cups, (which is forbidden), then you should not eat the <i>afikoman</i>, but rely on the matzah, which you ate before."

Therefore, it is everyone's duty to take it to heart on those days to examine his past actions and to repent; for fasting is not the main thing, as it was said about the people of Nineveh, \"And God saw their deeds\" (Jonah 3:10), and our Rabbis, of blessed memory, have said, \"It does not say, 'He saw their sackcloth and their fast,' but 'God saw their deeds, that they had turned away from their evil ways.'\" Fasting is only a preparation for repentance. Therefore those who while fasting, spend the time taking walks, and doing trivial things, take hold of the least important aspect of the fast, while ignoring the essence [of the fast.]",

(Furthermore, it is stated in the Jerusalem Talmud, that even at the destruction of the first <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>, the breach was made on the seventeenth, but that because of all the troubles, they made an error in the date). 4) The wicked Apostomos burned a Torah scroll. 5) An idol was placed in the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> by some wicked people among the Jews, and this caused the destruction of the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> and our exile.",

On that day, the first <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>, as well as the second were destroyed, the city of Betar was captured, which was a large city, in which an immense number of Jews lived.

The next morning at <i>Shacharis, tiskabbeil</i> is again omitted in the <i>Kaddish</i>. It is not said until <i>Minchah</i>. A person who prays by himself, because he can find no <i>minyan</i> (quorum of ten males thirteen years and older), should also recite <i>Eichah</i> and <i>Kinnos</i>.",
            "You should express grief in the manner of your sleeping. For example, if you are accustomed to sleep on two pillows, you should sleep only on one. Some people have the custom to sleep on the floor during the night of <i>Tishah beAv</i>, and to put a stone underneath their head as a reminder of what was said, \"And he took some of the stones of the place etc.,\" (Genesis 28:11). Our Sages comment that Jacob foresaw the destruction of the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> and said, \"How frightful\" etc. (verse 17). It all depends on the person's attitude.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A pregnant woman or any weak (or sick) person is not obligated to do any of these things. (<i>Ibid.</i> 555:7)</i>",
            "In the morning, we do not put on the <i>tefillin</i>, because <i>tefillin</i> are called an \"ornament.\" Neither do we put on the large <i>tallis</i>, because it is written, \"<i>Bitza imraso</i>\" (Lamentations 2:17), and the <i>Targum</i> translates, \"He tore his purple cloak apart.\" But you should put on your <i>tallis katan</i> (small <i>tallis</i>) without saying a berachah.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If you removed your <i>tallis katan</i> at night, some maintain that you should say a berachah when you put it on in the morning. (<i>Ibid.</i> 555:2)</i> You should go to the synagogue a bit earlier than usual.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If starting <i>Shacharis</i> early will cause the congregation to conclude saying <i>Kinnos</i> much before midday, it is better not to start too early. (<i>Ibid.</i> 559:16)</i> No light should be lit for the prayers.<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">At <i>Minchah,</i> however, lights may be lit. (<i>Ibid.</i> 559:15)</i> Again, prayers should be said in a low and tearful voice. We do say <i>Mizmor Lesodah</i> (a Psalm of thanksgiving). In the repetition of the <i>Shemoneh esrei</i> the <i>Chazzan</i> says <i>Aneinu</i> (Answer us) between <i>Ga'al Yisrael</i> (the Redeemer of Israel) and <i>Refa'einu</i> (Heal us), as on every other public fast day. He does not say the <i>Birkas kohanim</i> (priestly blessing).<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This rule is not mentioned in <i>Mishnah Berurah.</i></i> After the <i>Shemoneh esrei</i>, he says half-<i>kaddish</i>. We do not say <i>Tachanun</i> or <i>Keil erech apayim</i> (O' God, slow to anger), because <i>Tishah beAv</i> is called a <i>moed</i>. A <i>Seifer</i> Torah is taken out and the section <i>Ki solid banim</i> etc. is read (When you will have children) etc. (Deuteronomy 4:25), is read for three persons. It is proper for the one called up, to say quietly, <i>Baruch dayan ha'emes</i><sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This custom is also not mentioned in <i>Mishnah Berurah.</i></i> (Blessed is the true Judge) before saying the berachah. After the reading of the Torah, half-<i>kaddish</i> is said, and the <i>haftarah</i> is read of the chapter, <i>Asof asifeim</i>, [I will destroy them completely] (Jeremiah 8:13) in the tone of <i>Eichah</i>. The <i>Seifer</i> Torah is then replaced in the Ark. Everyone is seated on the floor to say <i>Kinnos</i>.<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">During the saying of <i>Kinnos,</i> it is forbidden to walk out of the synagogue or to engage in conversation which interrupt your thoughts and feelings of mourning the destruction. Light-headedness is always forbidden in the synagogue, and certainly so on <i>Tishah beAv,</i> a day of mourning over the destruction and the consequent exile of our people. (See <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 559:22)</i> The saying of <i>kinnos</i> should be drawn out, until close to noon. Then <i>Ashrei</i> (Fortunate are those) is said omitting <i>Lamenatzei'ach</i>, (For the conductor), and we say <i>Uva letziyon go'eil</i> [A redeemer shall come to Zion] etc., but we omit the verse <i>Va'ani zos berisi</i> [And as for Me, this is My covenant], for it would appear, as if He established a covenant for the <i>Kinnos</i>, and, besides, it would be inappropriate to say <i>Va'ani zos berisi etc., Lo yamushu mipicha etc</i>. (My words shall not depart from your mouth), since no one is studying Torah, as Torah study is forbidden (on <i>Tishah beAv</i>). But at a mourner's house, during the entire year, except on <i>Tishah beAv</i>, the verse should be said, for, although the mourner is not studying Torah, those that come to console him are not exempt [from Torah study]. Then, <i>Ve'atah kadosh</i> is said (And You are the Holy One) etc., followed by the complete <i>kaddish</i>, omitting <i>tiskabbeil</i>, then <i>Aleinu</i> (It is our duty) is said, and the mourner's <i>kaddish</i>. We do not say <i>Shir hayichud</i> (Song of God's Unity), nor <i>Shir shel yom</i> (Song of the day), nor <i>Pittum haketores</i> (The incense mixture). It is proper for everyone to read <i>Eichah</i> afterwards",
            "If there is a mourner in the town, he should go to the synagogue on the night (of <i>Tishah beAv</i>) and also during the day,<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Other <i>Poskim</i> maintain that during the first three days of mourning, he should not go to the synagogue. <i>Rav Shlomo Kluger</i> ruled that he should not go at night, when only a limited <i>Kinnos</i> is said, but by day, when the majority of <i>Kinnos</i> is said, he is permitted to go. After the three days, however, he may go, even at night. (See <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 559:24 and also <i>Shaar Hatzion</i> 22)</i> (and stay) until the conclusion of the <i>Kinnos</i>. He is permitted to receive an <i>aliyah</i> and to read the <i>haftarah</i>,<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This rule is not mentioned in <i>Mishnah Berurah.</i></i> because we all are mourners (on <i>Tishah beAv</i>).",

It is also permitted to study the Book of Job, as well as <i>Midrash Eichah</i>. [The following Talmudic selections may also be studied:] the Talmud, chapter <i>Eilu megalchin</i>, (Moed Katan, 3rd chapter), which deals with the laws of a mourner, and a person who was excommunicated, and the <i>Aggadic</i> portion of the chapter <i>Hanizakin</i> (<i>Maseches Gittin</i> 55b), and in the Jerusalem Talmud, the last part of the <i>Maseches Ta'anis</i>, which discusses the destruction of the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>. But even the chapters you are permitted to study, you are forbidden to study in depth, to find an answer to a difficult question or a homiletic interpretation, for that would gladden the heart.

However, if she feels that she is in perfect health and the fast will not harm her, she should complete the fast. Those who must eat on <i>Tishah beAv</i> should not enjoy an elaborate meal, but should eat no more than they need to preserve their health.",

If you are on your way to perform a mitzvah, and the only way you can get there is by crossing a stream, you may cross it on your way there and on returning, and you need not be concerned about it. However, if you are going for business, you may cross it on your way going, but on your return trip it is forbidden.<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">You are permitted to go because it may involve monetary loss, but there is no reason to permit the return.

(see <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 557:2; also <i>Biyur Halachah</i> 557:1)</i> but you should not conclude the prayer, with <i>Baruch menacheim</i> [Blessed … Consoler] etc., but with <i>Ki atah shomei'a</i> (For You hear the prayers) etc. But if you did not realize it until after you said <i>Baruch atah Hashem</i> [Blessed are You, Hashem], you conclude the berachah <i>Shomei'a tefillah</i> [Who hears prayer]<sup>34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See note 33 above.</i> and continue praying according to the regular order, and you do not have to repeat [the <i>Shemoneh esrei</i>].

The reason the fast was not set for the tenth day, although the greater part of the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> was burned on that day, is because the beginning of a punishment is felt more severly. In the Jerusalem Talmud it is stated, \"Rabbi Avin fasted on the ninth and on the tenth,\" ( <i>Maseches Taanis</i> 4:6). Rabbi Levi fasted on the ninth and on the night of the tenth. Because he did not have the strength to fast the entire tenth day, he fasted during the night only.

Also, the berachah <i>Shehecheyanu</i> should not be said; neither should you take a bath, or a haircut, or wash clothes, until noon of the tenth day.

On <i>Rosh Chodesh Elul</i>, Moshe went up Mount Sinai to receive the Second Tablets; he remained there for forty days, and came down on the tenth day of <i>Tishrei</i> when the atonement was completed.

            "It is customary to go to the cemetery <i>erev Rosh Hashanah</i> after the <i>Shacharis</i> prayers and bow prayerfully at the graves of <i>tzaddikim</i> [righteous men]. Charity should be given to the poor, and many fervent supplications offered to arouse the saintly <i>tzaddikim</i>, in their eternal resting place to intercede for us on the Day of Judgement. An additional reason for going to the cemetery is that the place where <i>tzaddikim</i> are buried is sacred and pure, and prayers are more readily accepted when they are offered on sacred ground, and the Holy One, blessed is He, will show us kindness for the sake of the <i>tzaddikim</i>. But it should not be your intention to appeal to the dead who rest there, for that would be tantamount to \"Inquiring of the dead,\" (Deuteronomy 18:11), which is forbidden, but you should ask of Hashem, blessed is His name, to have mercy on you for the sake of the <i>tzaddikim</i> who rest in the dust. When you arrive at the cemetery, if you have not seen graves within the past thirty days, you must say the berachah: <i>Asher yatzar eschem badin</i> [Who has formed you in judgement etc.] (see Chapter 60:11. above) When you approach the grave, you should say, \"May it be Your will, that the repose of [so-and-so] who is buried here, be in peace, and may his merit aid me.\" When placing your hand on the grave, the left hand only should be placed, —not the right hand. You should recite the verse, \"Hashem will always guide you, and satisfy your soul with splendor, and make your bones strong, you will be like a watered garden and like a spring of water whose water will not fail.\" (Isaiah 58:11) \"May you lie in peace, and may you sleep in peace until <i>Menachem</i> (the Comforter, <i>Moshiach</i>) comes, announcing peace.\" (When placing your hand [on the grave] you should have in mind the verse, \"Hashem will always guide you,\" which contains fifteen words the same as the number of joints in the hands.) You should not visit the same grave twice on the same day. Reading the inscription on a headstone, if it is protruding, causes forgetfulness. A remedy for that is to say the prayer <i>Ahavah rabbah</i> (With abundant love) up to <i>uleyachedcha be'ahavah</i> [and to proclaim Your Oneness with love].",

Although you will go to the synagogue afterwards to pray <i>Musaf</i>, and hear the <i>Tekios</i> sounded during the <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i>, the interruption does not require you to repeat the <i>berachos</i>, since all the <i>Tekios</i> constitute one mitzvah.

Others say the reason is that fish have no eyelids, and their eyes are always open, the purpose is thus to arouse the compassion of the All-Seeing Eye above us.)

You should then shake the ends of your clothes, symbolizing your resolve to cast away your sins, and to examine and scrutinize your ways, from now on; so that your \"clothes\" will be white and innocent of all sin.

For some authorities say, since both days are one [extended period of] holiness and you already said <i>Shehecheyanu</i> on the first day, you need not say it again on the second day. Therefore, it is the custom, when you recite the <i>Kiddush</i> on the second night, that a new fruit is placed on the table, in order that the <i>Shehecheyanu</i> in the <i>Kiddush</i> should also apply to the fruit; You might also put on a new garment. If you have neither [a new fruit nor a new suit], it does not matter; you should still say <i>Shehecheyanu</i> in the <i>Kiddush</i>, for the <i>Halachah</i> is decided according to the authorities who say that we must say <i>Shehecheyanu</i> on the second night.

            "The Ten Days of Repentance, as characterized by their name, are designated for repentance. During this time everyone is obligated to repent wholeheartedly before God, blessed is His Name, before the coming of the great and awesome day, of <i>Yom Kippur</i>, as it is said, \"Before God you will be cleansed\" (Leviticus 16:30). It is also said, \"Seek God when He may be found\", (Isaiah 55:6) and our Rabbis of blessed memory said, that this refers to the ten days between <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> and <i>Yom Kippur</i>. Therefore, during these days you must examine your conduct and repent of your bad deeds. Sins about which you are in doubt require greater repentance than transgressions of which you are certain, for a person is more regretful when he knows that he committed a sin, than when he is uncertain of it. Therefore, the guilt offering brought in case of doubtful sin must be of greater value than a regular sin offering. During these days You should study more Torah, perform more mitzvohs, give more charity, and spend less time on your business. It was written by Rabbi Moshe Cordovero, of blessed memory, that you should consider these days as if they were <i>Chol Hamoed</i>, by performing only necessary work. Above all, you must set right the wrongs you committed against your fellow man, for which there is no atonement unless you compensate him for any stolen articles or withheld funds<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is also sufficient if you present the case in all honesty before a Rav or <i>Posek</i> and ask him to decide what you should do.

            "It is customary to perform the <i>kapparos</i> ritual <i>erev Yom Kippur</i>, early in the morning, for then God's compassion is at its height. Men take roosters and women take hens, and a pregnant woman takes a rooster and a hen. The rooster is taken in case she is carrying a male; and if the child is a girl, one hen suffices for the mother and the child.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Others say that she should take two hens, one for herself and one should she be carrying a girl. (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 605:3</i> Even for other people, one <i>kapparah</i> is sufficient for two persons. You should select white chickens, for it is said, \"Though your sins will be like scarlet they will become white as snow.\" (Isaiah 1:18). But when buying, you should not express preference for white fowl and pay a higher price for it, for this resembles the customs of the Amorites [superstition]. But if you happen to find a white one among the fowl you bought, you should choose [the white one.] You take the <i>kapparah</i> in your right hand, and recite the verses <i>Benei Adam</i> [children of man] etc., move it around your head, and say: <i>Zeh chalifasi</i> [This is instead of me] etc. three times. If you move it around someone else's head, you say <i>Zeh chalifasecha</i> [This is instead of you]. You should first move it around your own head and then do it for others. It is preferable that the <i>shechitah</i> is done also early in the morning, immediately after the <i>kapparos</i> ritual.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Where there are many chickens to be killed and a large number of people present, who pressure the <i>shochet</i> to do their chicken, it is best to do the <i>kapparah</i> ritual several days <i>before Yom Kippur</i>, rather than cause the <i>shochet</i> to kill the chicken improperly. He will be unable to inspect his knife properly before killing each chicken and this could cause the chicken to be <i>treife</i> (not kosher). It is also possible to avoid this problem by using money rather than chickens to do the <i>kapporos</i> ritual. (<i>Ibid</i> 605:2)</i> You should not think that this <i>kapparah</i> ritual is an actual atonement, but you should consider that what is done to the fowl should be rightfully done to you, because of your sins. You should agonize over your sins, and the Holy One blessed is He, in His compassion, will accept your repentance. It is customary to throw the intestines, the liver and the kidneys of the <i>kapparos</i>, on the roof or into the courtyard, where the birds can take them, for it is appropriate to take pity on living creatures on that day, so that Heaven will take pity on us. Another reason is that birds usually steal the seeds they eat [we, therefore, throw away their digestive organs] so that we should be mindful to keep away from theft. If you cannot obtain chickens for <i>kapparos</i>, you can take a goose or some other living thing that is not ritually acceptable as a sacrifice on the altar in the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>. Some authorities say that even fish [may be used], but not pigeons or young doves, because these were acceptable as altar sacrifices, and it would appear as if you were bringing sacrifices outside the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> [which is forbidden]. Some people follow the custom of giving the <i>kapparos</i> chickens to the poor, but it is better to redeem the <i>kapparos</i> with money, and give the money to the poor.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The poor person might be humiliated by the thought that you rid yourself of your sins through this chicken and now are sending it to him.

            "Sins committed against your fellow man are not atoned for on Yom Kippur unless you placate him, as it is said, \"You will be cleansed of all your sins before God.\" This means, only sins against God are atoned for on <i>Yom Kippur</i>, but sins committed against your neighbor are not atoned for on <i>Yom Kippur</i>, unless you placate your neighbor. Everyone must, therefore, be very careful, if he has in his possession illegally acquired property, to return it and placate [the rightful owner]. If you are holding property of which you are not certain whether or not it legally belongs to you, you should let your neighbor know that you wish to appear with him, immediately after <i>Yom Kippur</i>, before a <i>Beis Din</i> Rabbinical court to be judged according to the holy Torah; and you should firmly resolve to abide by the verdict pronounced by the <i>Beis Din</i>. If you sinned against your neighbor, even if only with words, you must appease him. It is your duty to go personally to appease him. However, if it is difficult for you to do so, or if you understand that he will be reconciled more easily through an intermediary, you should appease him through an intermediary. The person whose forgiveness is asked should forgive wholeheartedly and should not be ruthless, for this is not a Jewish characteristic, but a trait of Esau of whom it is said, \"And he kept his anger forever\" (Amos 1:11). It is also said of the Gibeonites, because they did not forgive and would not be appeased, \"The Gibeonites were not of the Children of Israel.\" (II Samuel 21:2) The characteristic of the Children of Israel is to be slow to anger and easy to be appeased. And when the sinner asks for forgiveness you should grant forgiveness wholeheartedly and willingly. Even if he tormented you a great deal you should not take revenge nor bear a grudge. On the contrary, if the offender does not take the initiative to come to you asking for forgiveness, you should present yourself to the offender in order that [the offender] should ask your forgiveness. If a person does not banish hatred [from his heart] on <i>Yom Kippur</i>, his prayers will not be heard, God forbid; but if you are tolerant and forgiving, all your sins will be forgiven.",

If the grave is more than three <i>parsa</i><sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See glossary</i> away from the residence of the offender, he does not have to go there in person, but may send a representative. The representative should gather ten men to go to the grave, and say, \"I, the agent of so-and-so publicly declare that so-and-so has sent me to ask forgiveness for his sin,\" etc. If he insulted a dead person he does not have to go to his grave, but he should ask for his forgiveness at the place where he insulted him. But if he had defamed his character, he must accept upon himself to repent, for transgressing the prohibition of the early sages, against slandering the dead.",

Others have the custom to immerse after the final meal because then it is closer to <i>Yom Kippur</i>. (<i>Ibid</i> 606:18)</i> to purify himself from nocturnal emission, and also as an element of repentance, just as a convert is required to immerse in a <i>mikvah</i>. Therefore, even boys and girls<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to boys of thirteen years of age and girls who are twelve years old. (<i>Ibid</i> 606:23)</i> should immerse themselves in a <i>Mikvah</i>. You should be certain that there is no <i>chatzitzah</i> on your body [a particle intervening between the body and the water] (see Chapter 161 below). The most appropriate time for the immersion is after midday. A woman after intercourse is likely to discharge semen within three days. She is then considered as one who has had a nocturnal emission, and the immersion is pointless in this case. The practical thing for her to do, is before immersing, to wash herself well with warm water; she will then experience no further discharge. However, if she had intercourse soon after her monthly immersion in the <i>mikvah</i>, or immediately before her menstrual period, when she is likely to become pregnant, then she is forbidden to destroy the semen of conception, and she should, therefore, not wash herself in warm water. Nevertheless, she should immerse in cold water.

A support for this practice is found at the end of the portion of <i>Tetzaveh</i> (Exodus 30:10) where it is written, \"He shall make atonement once each year,\" and this is followed by the verse (verse 12) \"Each shall give an atonement offering to God.\" The charity is credited to the departed, because God, Who tests the hearts, knows that if this man were alive, he, too, would have given charity. The living can pray to make the judgment of the dead less severe, just as David did when he prayed for [his son] Absalom (<i>Maseches Sotah</i> 10b); and the righteous dead appeal to God on behalf of their offspring. Also on the last day of <i>Pesach</i>, on the second day of <i>Shavuos</i>, and on <i>Shemini Atzeres, Yizkor</i> is said, because on these days we read <i>Kol habechor</i> [Every male first-born], (Deuteronomy 15:19), where it is written, \"Each person according to the gift of his hand\" (16:17). Because of that, people pledge money for charity.

The best way is to light a candle from the flame of the candle you lit in your house the day before, and to say the berachah over both of them. If you have no burning candle in your house you should bring a burning candle from the synagogue, light another candle from it and say a berachah over both of them. In extreme circumstances, you may say the berachah over a candle that was lit from a candle of a non-Jew, or from a flame that was produced by means of a match, or something similar.

            "It is a mitzvah to build the <i>sukkah</i> immediately, on the day after <i>Yom Kippur</i>,<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even though it was mentioned in the previous chapter (Paragraph 30) that it is a mitzvah to begin building the <i>sukkah</i> immediately after <i>Yom Kippur</i> at night, it is sufficient to make a symbolic beginning at night, whereas on the next day you should erect the entire <i>sukkah</i> if possible. (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 652:2)</i> even if it is <i>erev Shabbos</i>,<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">You may work on the <i>sukkah</i> only until midday on <i>erev Shabbos</i> but afterwards it is forbidden. (<i>Ibid</i>., see also <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> 72:9)</i> because when a mitzvoh presents itself you should not put it off. You should select a clean location to build it.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">You must not build a <i>sukkah</i> in an area which is affected by bad odors (garbage etc.) because this will cause you to leave the <i>sukkah</i>. (See <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 630:4, <i>Biur Halachah</i> 637:3)</i> It is a mitzvah for everyone to be personally involved in building the <i>sukkah</i> and laying the <i>sechach</i> (covering). Even though he is a distinguished person, it is considered an honor to be personally involved in the mitzvah. It would have been appropriate to say the berachah <i>Shehecheyanu</i> when building the <i>sukkah</i>, but we rely on the <i>Shehecheyanu</i> that is said in the <i>Kiddush</i>. You should endeaver to decorate the <i>sukkah</i> and to adorn it with beautiful things and elegant spreads, according to your means.",
            "Concerning the walls of the <i>sukkah</i>, there are many different <i>halachos</i>, and not everyone is familiar with them. Therefore, you must make the walls full-length (complete) and strong, so that the wind cannot shake them<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to a normal, usual wind. If the walls move to and fro because of the wind, they are not considered valid walls. (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 630:48)</i> or blow out the candles. If you do not have enough [lumber] for [four] walls, it is better to make three complete walls than four incomplete ones. If you can afford it, it is a mitzvah to build a <i>sukkah</i> with a roof, that can open and close on hinges, so that you can close it when it rains; and when the rain is over, you can open it again. This way, the <i>sechach</i> is kept dry, and you can fulfill the mitzvah of <i>sukkah</i> properly.",
            "With regard to <i>sechach</i>, there are also many <i>halachos</i>. It is our custom to cover the <i>sukkah</i> with branches of trees or with reeds. Since they grow in the earth, and are detached from the soil, and do not absorb ritual impurity, and are not tied together, you have no reason at all to hesitate [using them].",

Even placing them on top of the <i>sechach</i> to reinforce it, should be avoided. However, if they are in place already, or you have nothing else [to serve the purpose], all these are permitted for we have an established rule that it is permitted to support the <i>sechach</i> with something that absorbs ritual impurity.",

(<i>Ibid</i> 631:1)</i> for if there is more sun than shade, the <i>sukkah</i> is invalid, according to Torah law. Care must be taken, therefore, to put on enough <i>sechach</i>; that, even if it dries out, there will still be more shade than sun. You must also be careful not to leave an open space of three <i>tefachim</i> in any one place.<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See glossary. Even though less than three <i>tefachim</i> does not disqualify the <i>sukkah</i>, nevertheless, you should not eat or sleep under that opening. (<i>Ibid</i> 632:12)</i> Initially, it is necessary to leave a slight space between the branches of the <i>sukkah</i>, so that the stars can be seen. Nevertheless, if the <i>sechach</i> is so thick that the stars cannot be seen, the <i>sukkah</i> is still valid. But if the <i>sechach</i> is so thick, that even a heavy rain cannot come through, then it is almost like a house, and the <i>sukkah</i> is invalid.<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Mishnah Berurah</i> writes that if for any reason it is impossible to remove some of the <i>sechach</i>, you can rely on those authorities who rule that the <i>sukkah</i> is valid even with such thick <i>sechach</i>.

If this board is less than four <i>amos</i><sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See glossary.</i> wide, the <i>sukkah</i> does not become invalid, because of invalid <i>sechah</i>, for there is a <i>halachic</i> tradition from Mount Sinai, that when a board projects less than four <i>amos</i>, we say that it is a curved wall, which means that the protruding board is considered part of the wall, and we regard the wall as if it is bent at the top.<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In practice it is advisable to consult a competent <i>halachic</i> authority in such situations, for there are various ramifications regarding this rule.</i> But you may not sit or sleep underneath that board, for <i>Halachah</i> does not recognize that area as part of the <i>sukkah</i>, even if the board is only four <i>tefachim</i> wide; but the rest of the <i>sukkah</i> is valid. But if protruding from the <i>sukkah</i> wall, there are boards that are four <i>amos</i> or more wide, then they are called invalid <i>sechach</i> which invalidates the entire <i>sukkah</i>. Nevertheless, if the boards protrude into the <i>sukkah</i> only on one side, as is the style in some of the built [permanent] <i>sukkos</i>, where a small shelf is installed on one side (to put the dishes there when it starts to rain), then it does not matter; since it is only on one side, there are still three valid walls on which there is valid <i>sechach;</i> and a <i>sukkah</i> made of three walls is also valid, provided it has the minimum size required for a <i>sukkah</i>, which is no less than seven <i>tefachim</i><sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Both the length and width of the <i>sukkah</i> must be at least seven <i>tefachim</i>. Therefore, if one is seven <i>tefachim</i> and the other is less or much longer, it is invalid even though the total area is equal to an area of seven by seven <i>tefachim</i>.

(<i>Ibid</i> 626:1, see <i>Biur Halachah</i>)</i> it is invalid. Even if the branches alone would have allowed more sun than shade, and consequently, by placing the <i>sechach</i> on the <i>sukkah</i>, you, in fact, made it into a <i>sukkah</i> [by providing the required shade], it is, nevertheless, invalid. Even if you cut off the branches of the tree afterwards, the <i>sukkah</i> still remains invalid, for it is written, \"Make [<i>ta'aseh</i>] the festival of <i>Sukkos</i> for yourself\" (Deuteronomy 16:13), and it is expounded, \"A <i>sukkah</i> must be made, and not come into being by itself.\" (see chapter 9:6 above) Therefore, after cutting the branches of the tree, you must pick up each branch of the <i>sechach</i> and a new act of placing it down must be performed, for the purpose of fulfilling the mitzvah of <i>sukkah</i>.<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Mishnah Berurah</i> writes that the <i>sechach</i> must be placed down for the sake of providing shade but not necessarily for the mitzvah of <i>sukkah</i>. (<i>Ibid</i> 626:14)</i> It is also forbidden to lay down the <i>sechach</i> before making the walls for it is required that with the laying of the <i>sechach</i> the <i>sukkah</i> should become valid for use.",
            "Similarly when you build a <i>sukkah</i> with a roof that can be opened [and closed], you must open the roof before you put down the <i>sechach</i>, and if afterwards you close the roof and open it again, it does not matter, for it is the same as if you spread a sheet over it and then remove it. Nevertheless, you should be stringent, and have the roof open at the onset of the Yom Tov. You must also take care with these <i>sukkos</i> that the roof is wide open, straight in line with the wall of the <i>sukkah</i>. For if it is not perfectly straight, but inclines slightly over the <i>sechach</i>, even if the area covered is not large enough to make the <i>sukkah</i> invalid, nevertheless, you should be careful not to sit under the area over which the roof protrudes, for you would then be sitting underneath the roof. (see paragraph 6 above) Although a <i>sukkah</i> is exempt from a <i>mezuzah</i> during the Yom Tov, nevertheless, the permanently built <i>sukkos</i>, that are used all year and are required to have a <i>mezuzah</i>, are not exempt during <i>Sukkos</i>, and it is not necessary after <i>Sukkos</i> to affix the <i>mezuzah</i> again.",

Even if [a piece of wood] fell down you are forbidden to use it; and it is of no avail [if you had made] a stipulation [before Yom Tov] [to use such wood.] If <i>Simchas Torah</i> occurs on Friday, the wood is forbidden also on Shabbos. The <i>sukkah</i> decorations are also forbidden to be used, even if they fell down.

Nevertheless, if an <i>esrog</i> is hanging in the <i>sukkah</i> as a decoration, you are permitted to inhale its fragrance, for it was not set aside in regard to its fragrance. With regard to decorations hanging from the <i>sechach</i>, it is generally accepted that even if you made a stipulation [to use them on Yom Tov], it is of no avail. However, regarding decorations hanging on the walls, this stipulation is effective. Tapestries that are hung in the <i>sukkah</i> as decorations, it is the accepted practice to remove them so that they should not get ruined by an impending rain, even if you had made no express stipulation; for we assume that initially you had that in mind when you hung them.<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shaarei Tzion</i> (638:26) writes: “Therefore, it is permitted to remove them whenever you want, even when it is not raining, and even when there is no threat of rain.”</i> Nevertheless, it is best to express prior stipulation, that is, before twilight on the eve of <i>Sukkos</i>,<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> this stipulation must be made before sunset. (638:21)</i> you should stand [in the <i>sukkah</i>] and say, \"I hereby stipulate that I am permitted to eat, and to use the decorations of this <i>sukkah</i> whenever I wish.\" You must be careful about those <i>sukkah</i> decorations that you intend to remove during Yom Tov, not to tie them with a knot, but only with a loop, (see chapter 80:45, 46 above).",

Therefore, you should keep in mind when you live in the <i>sukkah</i>, that the Holy One, blessed is He, commanded us to live in the <i>sukkah</i> as a memorial of the Exodus from Egypt.

Rabbi Akiva, says that it means actual <i>sukkos</i> that they built for themselves when they camped [in the desert] as a protection from the sun. Although we departed from Egypt in the month of <i>Nisan</i>, He did not command us to build the <i>sukkah</i> during that season, because it is the beginning of the summer, when people usually build booths for the shade, and it would not be recognized as being built in order to fulfill the mitzvah of the Creator, blessed is His Name. He, therefore, commanded us to make it in the seventh month, which is the rainy season, when people usually move out of their booths to live in their homes; but we move out of our houses to live in the <i>sukkah</i>; which makes it clear to all that we are fulfilling the King's command.",

If it rains so much, that in your judgment, if that much rain would drip into your cooked food,<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is true even if the food is of the kind that spoils quickly because of a little water. (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 639:34)</i> it would be spoiled, even if the food is not actually in the <i>sukkah</i>, or if you estimate,<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If you are unable to make such a judgment, you should use the next example quoted in the text as a criterion. (<i>Ramah</i> 639:5)</i> that if it would rain that much into the room where you are sitting, you would move into another room, then you may leave the <i>sukkah</i> and go into the house. If you started to eat in the <i>sukkah</i>, and then it began to rain, so that you went into the house and started to eat there; or because of the rain you began initially to eat in the house, and then it stopped raining, you may finish your meal in the house, and you are not obligated to leave while the meal is in progress, to go from your house into the <i>sukkah</i>. When it is so cold that the food in the <i>sukkah</i> jells,<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is certainly true if you are troubled because of the cold. (<i>Shaar Hatzion</i> 639:59)</i> you are exempt from sitting in the <i>sukkah</i>, and you may eat in the house.<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This <i>halachah</i> also holds true if the climate is so intensely hot or if there are many insects that cause you to be uncomfortable, or will cause the food to become inedible. (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 639:31)</i>",
            "As for sleeping in the <i>sukkah</i>, even a slight rain causes discomfort when you sleep, and you may leave [the <i>sukkah</i> when it rains]. If you left the <i>sukkah</i> to sleep in the house, and then it stopped raining; or if you initially went to sleep in the house because of the rain and then the rain stopped, you do not have to bother to go to the <i>sukkah</i> during the night,<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">You need not go into the <i>sukkah</i> to sleep even if you wake up during the night.

And he is not permitted to say the berachah [<i>Leisheiv basukkah</i>], because it would be a berachah said in vain. When you leave the <i>sukkah</i> because of rain, you should not complain [in anger] as you leave, but go out feeling humbled, like a servant who poured a cup [of wine] for his master, and the master poured a pitcher [of water] into his face.",

The rationale is that the berachah which will be said at mealtime exempts even the time spent in the <i>sukkah</i> before the meal. The later <i>Poskim</i>, however, write that in order to comply with those <i>halachic</i> authorities who maintain that it is not proper to sit for a length of time without saying the berachah, it is best to say the berachah <i>Borei minei mezonos</i> and eat a piece of cake larger than a <i>kebeitzah</i> as soon as you enter the <i>sukkah</i> and to say the berachah <i>Leisheiv basukkah</i>. This will make it unnecessary to say the berachah when you eat the regular meal. (<i>Ibid</i> 639:46)</i> And it is the custom to say the <i>Hamotzi</i> first, and then <i>Leisheiv basukkah</i>, before you begin to eat. Everything that you eat in the <i>sukkah</i> the entire day, and whatever you do while staying there, even if you sleep there, is exempt with the berachah you said before eating the regular meal, [and it exempts everything] until you eat your next regular meal. If you did not leave the <i>sukkah</i> to go to business or to the synagogue between meals, since you once said the berachah, you need not repeat it at the next meal. Even if during the entire week of <i>Sukkos</i>, you would dwell in the <i>sukkah</i> eating, studying, praying and sleeping there, you would need to say the berachah only one time, because your thoughts were never diverted from the <i>sukkah</i>. Even if you left the <i>sukkah</i> temporarily, with the intention of returning immediately, it is not considered a diversion, and you need not say the berachah at the following meal. However, if you went out to do business, or to go to the synagogue, or for similar reasons; even if you went into your house to study, or to do something which is time consuming, it also constitutes a distraction, and you must say the berachah at the next meal.",

In situations where there is a doubt regarding <i>berachos</i>, the rule is that we are lenient and do not say the berachah. It is the best practice, therefore, not to leave the <i>sukkah</i> in the middle of the meal. (<i>Ibid</i> 639:48)</i>",

            "During the era of the Second <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> when the Greek kingdom was in power, they imposed evil decrees against the Jewish people, designed to put an end to their religion. They did not permit them to study the Torah or to perform the mitzvos; they plundered their property, [abducted] their daughters, entered the Temple, violating its sanctity and defiling its purity. Yisrael was in great distress because of them, for they oppressed them bitterly, until the God of our fathers took pity on them and delivered them from their dominion, and rescued them. The Hasmoneans, the sons of the <i>Kohein Gadol</i> defeated and killed them, and delivered Yisrael from their dominion. They appointed as king one of the <i>Kohanim</i>, and the Kingdom of Yisrael returned to power and [endured] for more than two hundred years, until the destruction of the Second <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>. When Yisrael triumphed over their enemies and destroyed them, —this happened on the twenty-fifth of Kislev—, they entered the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>, and found of the pure oil in the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> only one jar, that was stamped with the seal of the <i>Kohein Gadol</i>. This oil was sufficient to burn for only one day, but they lit the lights of the <i>Menorah</i> with it [and it lasted] for eight days, until they crushed olives and extracted pure oil. For this reason the Sages of that generation ordained that these eight days, beginning on the twenty-fifth of <i>Kislev</i>, should be days of rejoicing and praise. We kindle lights in the evening near the entrance to the house every night, during these eight nights, in order to display and reveal the miracle. These days are called <i>Chanukah</i>, which means [it is a contraction of] <i>chanu chaf-hei</i> [they rested on the twenty-fifth]. For on the twenty-fifth of <i>Kislev</i> they rested from their enemies [onslaughts]. Another reason [for the name <i>Chanukah</i>] is that during these days they dedicated the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> [<i>Chanukas habayis</i>], that had been defiled by the oppressors. Some authorities say, therefore, that it is a mitzvah to somewhat embellish the meals on <i>Chanukah</i>. Another reason for celebrating <i>Chanukah</i> is that the construction of the <i>Mishkan</i> was completed during these days. You should tell your family the story of the miracles that were performed for our forefathers, during these days (see Flavius Josephus). Nevertheless, a <i>Chanukah</i> feast is not considered a mitzvah, unless you sing hymns and praises to Hashem during the meal.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his responsa, <i>Maharshal</i> writes that it is fitting and proper that this festivity be combined and saturated with the spirit and joy of Torah. <i>Biur Halachah</i> writes: “Adding to our grave sins, there are those who have substituted card playing and other secular frivolities instead of hymns and praises [at their so called <i>Chanukah</i> parties].” (<i>Biur Halachah</i> 670:2)</i> On <i>Chanukah</i> you should give charity generously, for the days of <i>Chanukah</i> are auspicious to correct flaws of the soul through the giving of charity,<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It has always been a custom for the poor to ask for charity during the days of <i>Chanukah</i>.

            "You are permitted to work on <i>Chanukah</i>. But women follow the custom, not to do any work during the time the <i>Chanukah</i> lights are burning, and you should not [cause them] to treat this matter lightly. The reason that women are more stringent about this [than men], is that the cruelty of the evil decree was directed mainly at Jewish women. For [the Greeks] decreed that a virgin girl before her wedding must first cohabit with the general. Another reason for this is that the miracle came about through a woman. The daughter of Yochanan the <i>Kohein Gadol</i> was a very beautiful girl, and the ruthless king wanted her to lie with him. She told him that she would fulfill his request; and she served him cheese dishes, so that he would be thirsty, and drink wine; then become intoxicated, and fall asleep. That is precisely what happened. Then she cut off his head and brought it to Jerusalem. When the general saw that the king was dead, he [and his army] fled. Therefore, some people have the custom to eat dairy dishes on <i>Chanukah</i>, to commemorate the miracle achieved by means of a dairy product.",
            "All kinds of oil are valid for the <i>Chanukah</i> lights. Nevertheless, the mitzvah done to perfection is to use olive oil, similar to the miracle in the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>, which was achieved with olive oil. If this cannot be obtained you should select another kind of oil that gives a clear, bright flame, or wax candles, for they also produce clear light. You should not use two candles braided together, for that would be like a torch; but each candle should [burn] by itself. You should not make the candles from wax that comes from houses of idol worship, for that is repulsive. All wicks are valid for <i>Chanukah</i> lights. The mitzvah done to perfection is to use cotton. It is not necessary to take new wicks every night, but you may light the old wicks until they are used up.",

You should be careful that each person places his <i>menorah</i> in a separate place, so that one can easily tell how many lights are lit [that night].

But if you placed it higher than ten <i>tefachim</i> you have fulfilled your obligation. However, if you placed it higher than twenty <i>amos</i><sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See glossary.</i> you have not fulfilled your obligation, because when it is placed higher than twenty <i>amos</i> it is out of the range of vision. If you live on an upper floor you may place [the <i>menorah</i>] in the window, even though it is higher than ten <i>tefachim</i> from the ground.

Accordingly if you lit them when they were lower than three <i>tefachim</i> [off the ground] or higher than twenty <i>amos</i>, and after they were already burning you placed them in their proper place, they are not valid.<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Poskim</i> have written that even when the <i>Menorah</i> was lit in a proper place, it should not be moved to another [proper] place until after the candles had burned at least a half hour.

But if you put them in the proper place and they were extinguished by accident, you have fulfilled the mitzvah. Nevertheless, it is customary to kindle them again. It is the custom to be strict and not rekindle an extinguished light with another <i>Chanukah</i> light, but you should light it with the <i>shamash</i> or with some other candle.",

Moshe Rabeinu, peace be upon him, also fasted on the day he went into battle against Amalek. This being the case, we may assume, that in the days of Mordechai and Esther, they also fasted on the thirteenth day of <i>Adar</i>. Therefore, all Jews have accepted this day as a public fast day.

It is meant to remind us that the Creator, blessed is His Name, sees and hears the prayers of every person in his time of trouble, when he fasts and repents with all his heart, as He answered our forefathers in those days. Nevertheless, this fast is not as obligatory as the four fast days mentioned in <i>Tanach</i> (see Chapter 121 above). Therefore, you may be lenient when it is necessary. Thus pregnant and nursing women, or even a person who is slightly ill with an eye irritation should not fast, if fasting would be greatly discomforting to them.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers only to one who has an eye irritation, but a pregnant or nursing woman need not fast even though they feel no discomfort.

Also if she perceived it three consecutive times on the fifth of the Jewish-Hebrew month, then the fifth day of the Jewish-Hebrew month is the established day of her menses. This way of reckoning is referred to as \"Menses determined by days,\" for it is consistently the same day in the month. And even though the number of days between one perception and the other is not always alike, for some months consist of only twenty-nine days, while others consist of thirty days, nevertheless, since she is accustomed to perceive on a certain day of the month, this day is her established day of the menses.",

For instance, if she perceived a flow today, followed by an interval of twenty-five days, and she perceived, followed again by an interval of twenty-five days, and she perceived, followed again by an interval of twenty-five days, and she perceived, she has had four perceptions, between which there were three equal intervals, and has thereby established her menses.",

If the twenty-fifth day came and she has not perceived blood, she must take heed of the twenty-eighth day, because of her last perception.

If now, too, she did not perceive blood on the twenty-fifth day, but rather on the twenty-eighth day, the twenty-eighth day is set as her fixed period while the twenty-fifth is eliminated, (for she has replaced it with another, three times,) and she is permitted [on the twenty fifth day]. If the last perceptions were not had at equal intervals, if she saw on the twenty eighth day, on the twenty ninth day, and on the thirty first day, her previous fixed period is eliminated, and now she has no established fixed period.

You must also be mindful of the \"average <i>onah</i> (period).\" This is how you should conduct yourself until she establishes a regular period. After she establishes a regular period, if a change occurs in her period, you must also be careful to take notice of the new perception, with regard to both the number of intervening days, and the day of the month.

For instance, if she has established a period based only on physical symptoms, for example, if thereafter she yawned three times, and did not perceive a flow, she no longer has to be mindful when she yawns again. If it is a period based on a combination when the fixed day arrives three times, and she yawned and did not perceive any flow, then the term is eliminated. But a change of days without yawning, or a change in yawning without a change in days, do not eliminate the term established by a combination of factors, because we require that this process of its elimination be similar to the process through which it was established.",

When the period of nursing is over, she must continue to observe her former periods.

            "Therefore, in our regions, where the roofs project towards the outside with a width of no less than one <i>tefach</i>, and since we know that the width of one <i>tefach</i> conveys impurity, this projecting roof is considered a tent which conveys impurity. Hence, when two houses are close to each other, if the deceased is in one of them, the impurity passes through the door, or open window, beneath the ends of the projecting rooftop, and enters into the second house, through the open window or door. Thus the <i>Kohein</i> is forbidden to enter even the second house. This is true even if there are many houses closely adjoining one another.",
            "Even if the roofs are not of the same height, but one is higher than the other, even if the roof of the house where the impurity is found is much higher than the second roof or vice versa, there is a <i>halachah</i> handed down by Moshe from [Mount] Sinai, that the height is considered as lowered, that is, we consider as though the height was pressed down and lowered until it reaches the lower one. And since if it were lowered to the level of the bottom one, they would touch, therefore, the impurity passes from one to the other. But if there would be a space between them, even if ever so small, the impurity does not pass from one to the other.",

Then the impurity is conveyed from one roof to another. When necessary, this can be remedied by removing the tiles of the roof in one place to create an interrupting [open] space of a <i>tefach</i> wide without a tent. You must be certain that the wall itself does not project a <i>tefach</i>, as sometimes they make a projection (to adorn) the wall.",
            "There is a <i>halachah</i> transmitted to Moshe from Sinai, concerning the door through which the deceased will be carried from the house. Since after the removal the house will again be ritually pure, although the door is now closed, nevertheless according to <i>halachah</i>, it is considered as though it is open, and therefore a <i>Kohein</i> is forbidden to stand under the lintel, even though the door is closed. Also, if there is a roof projecting a <i>tefach</i> over the door, it conveys the impurity to every possible place, as though the door were open. However, if there was an open door or window on another side measuring four square <i>tefachim</i>, the closed door is not considered as being open, and a <i>Kohein</i> is permitted to stand there provided the impurity cannot reach him through the open door or window.",
            "If a <i>Kohein</i> is in a house or a room, the doors and windows of which are closed in such manner that the door is not opened a <i>tefach</i>, and the window does not have an opening the size of a <i>pundyon</i> (coin), and he hears that there is a corpse in the vicinity, so that if the door or window were to be opened, the impurity would reach him, he is forbidden to open either of them, but he should remain there as is, until the deceased is carried out; for so long as there is not an opening of a <i>tefach</i>, the impurity cannot penetrate, but when it is opened, it can penetrate.",
            "A <i>kohein</i> is forbidden to approach within four <i>amos</i> of a deceased person or a grave. This applies only when the deceased lies in his permanent place. But when he lies on the bier during the funeral procession, or when they are saying <i>Tzidduk Haddin</i>, even when they stop with the bier, since this is not his permanent place, the <i>Kohein</i> need keep away only a distance of four <i>tefachim</i>.",
            "If a <i>Kohein</i> is asleep in a house where there is a deceased person, where the impurity of the deceased penetrates, and it is impossible to shut him in, in order to prevent the access of the impurity, he should be awakened and told to leave the premises. If he is undressed, he should not be told about the impurity, but merely called outside so that he may get dressed first; for a person's dignity is very important. However, as soon as he is aware of the impurity, he is forbidden to wait there until he gets dressed, but he must leave immediately.",
            "Some <i>Poskim</i> maintain that even the corpse of a non-Jew causes impurity in a house. A <i>Kohein</i> should be mindful of this opinion and not walk over the grave of a non-Jew. Especially when there is reason to believe that an apostate may have been buried there (too), for an apostate is like a Jew (in this regard). Also the child born by an apostate woman from a non-Jew, is like in Jew in this regard.",
            "A <i>Kohein</i> is permitted to defile himself at the death of his relatives, and it is a <i>mitzvah</i> for him to do so. These are the relatives for which he may defile himself: his wife whom he was permitted to marry, his father, his mother, his son or his daughter, his brother and sister born from his father, provided they were born full term, but for a child who may have been aborted, a <i>Kohein</i> may not defile himself. He may not defile himself for a married sister.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even if she was divorced or widowed and no longer married.</i> Some <i>Poskim</i> maintain that which a <i>Kohein</i> is permitted and is a <i>mitzvah</i> to defile himself for relatives is only for the needs of burial, or to bring a coffin, or shrouds, or the like. Consequently, on Shabbos, a day when he may not be buried, a <i>Kohein</i> is forbidden to defile himself even in order to guard the deceased. It is proper to follow this strict opinion. However, concerning things necessary for burial, it is certainly a <i>mitzvah</i> for him to defile himself. Even if there is a Burial Society to take care of all the arrangements, and he has nothing to take care of, he is permitted to be in the house in case they might need something. He may defile himself for these relatives only until the grave is closed, and not thereafter.",
            "A <i>Kohein</i> is forbidden to defile himself for parents who abandoned the practices of the Jewish people, and not for one who committed suicide. Similarly, a <i>Kohein</i> is forbidden to defile himself for anyone for whom the rules of mourning need not be observed.",
            "A <i>Kohein</i> may not defile himself for a relative unless the body is complete but not if it is missing a limb. Therefore some <i>Poskim</i> maintain that a <i>Kohein</i> may not defile himself for a slain relative, for his body is considered incomplete; and it is proper to heed this strict opinion.",
            "Some ignorant <i>Kohanim</i> are accustomed to visit the graves of the righteous, maintaining that the graves of the righteous do not defile. They are in error, and such practice should be protested.",
            "Just as an [adult] <i>Kohein</i> is warned against defiling himself, so too are adult <i>Kohanim</i> warned concerning minors, as it is said, \"Say to the <i>Kohanim</i>… and say (to them).\"<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Leviticus</i> 21:1.</i> Because the word \"say\" is written twice, our Sages, of blessed memory,<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Maseches Yevomos</i> 114a.</i> inferred from this that the adults are warned concerning the minors. They must not be the direct cause of their defilement by bringing them into a house where there is a deceased person, but if the minor defiles himself on his own, there is no need to remove him. However, if he has reached the age of training, he should be removed. The pregnant wife of a <i>Kohein</i> is permitted to enter a house containing a corpse.<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even if it seems she will give birth there, because perhaps it will be a girl; and if not, it may not be a viable child. <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 343:3.</i>",

In that case the relatives are forced to remove the deceased, so as not to cause the sick [<i>Kohein</i>] to transgress a law of the Torah. If the deceased is an aborted fetus, its relatives can be forced, in any event, to remove it, even on Shabbos through a non-Jew."

            "It is customary for other relatives too, to observe partial mourning during the first week until after Shabbos. It is therefore customary not to bathe in warm water, and not to change their clothing as they do every other Shabbos. Not all relatives are alike in this respect. For a first cousin, a son's son or a daughter's son, one should wear all his Shabbos clothing except for his outer garment. For a father-in-law, a mother-in-law, or for a paternal or maternal grandfather; also a woman for her father-in-law, her mother-in-law, and for her paternal or maternal grandfather, they should wear only a white Shabbos shirt, and a woman may also wear her white scarf. It is also customary not to bathe, and not to shampoo the hair. One should also not eat out of the house at a religious feast or at any social gatherings. After Shabbos, all of these activities are permitted.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">All these things depend on the prevailing customs. <i>Shach</i> 374:7.</i>",

Neither does he mourn for him, because it may have been an aborted child. If he died after thirty days, even on the thirty-first day at an earlier hour than that on which he was born, one must tear his garments, observe the laws of <i>onein</i>, and mourn over him, unless it is known for sure, that he was born in the eighth month of pregnancy (and is not a viable child). If it was known for sure that he was born in the ninth month, for example, if after cohabitation, the father was separated from his wife, and he was born alive, nine full months later, even if he dies on the day he was born, one must tear his garments, observe the laws of <i>onein</i> and mourn over him.",
            "If one of twin children dies within thirty days after birth or even on the thirtieth day, and the other survives after thirty days, we do not draw the conclusion, that since one lived after thirty days, the other one, too, was a viable child. Therefore mourning is not observed for him.",

            "If the cemetery is close to the city, and the mourner did not go [to the cemetery] but went straight home after the funeral service, he does not observe the laws of mourning until he is told that the grave has been filled. However, if night is approaching and he wants this day counted as one of the seven days of mourning, then, from the time he assumes that the grave was filled, he may begin to observe mourning. If he is informed thereafter that the grave was filled before nightfall, he may count that day as one of the seven, and if it was the day preceding a Festival, the Festival cancels the remainder of the seven days of mourning.",
            "In places where the deceased are sent to another city for burial, and they do not know when he will be buried, the mourners who remain in the city should begin to observe the period of mourning immediately upon returning from the funeral, and count from that time the seven days and the thirty days of mourning. The mourners who accompany the deceased to the place of burial count from the time he was buried. Some <i>poskim</i> maintain that if the head of the family accompanies the deceased, then also those who remain behind count from the time he was buried. They have to estimate the time he was buried, and begin to observe the laws of mourning. (Regarding the intervening days, See above Chapter 196:5, 6) It is only regarding a more strict application that the other mourners follow the head of the family, and even those who remain at home start counting from the time of burial, but if the head of the family remained at home, those mourners who accompany the deceased are not subject to him, rather they begin to count from the time of the burial.",

If he becomes ill, or if he is in some other situation where he must eat, he must have his vow annulled. However, if he distinctly declared that his fasting is not an acceptance of a vow, annulment is not necessary. It is customary to light a <i>Yahrzeit</i> candle.",
