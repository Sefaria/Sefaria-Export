            "With gratitude to the Almighty for the opportunity to study and teach Torah, we are proud to present the sixth English volume of <i>Peninei Halakha</i>. This volume covers holidays and occasions that are primarily of rabbinic provenance. Some, like Ḥanuka and Purim, are days of joy. Others, like the <i>Omer</i> period, the Three Weeks, and the fast days, are occasions of grief and pain. Two topics addressed in this volume, <i>Sefirat Ha-omer </i>and Rosh Ḥodesh, are rooted in the Torah, even as most related observances today are of rabbinic origin.",
            "This is the sixth English volume that has appeared, and the fourth that addresses the observance of Jewish holidays and festivals. It joins two volumes of <i>Peninei Halakha: Laws of Shabbat</i> and one of <i>Peninei Halakha: Laws of Pesaḥ</i>. A volume on the festivals – Yom Tov and <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i>, is entering its final stages of editing. Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur, and Sukkot will be treated separately in future volumes, with help from the Almighty.",
            "In this volume, as in the previous ones, my objective is to summarize the fundamentals of <i>halakha</i>, emphasize and explain its principles, and then move to the practical law. The goal is to be as concise as possible so that one can learn a great deal in a short amount of time. The notes expand on the reasons and sources for particular rulings, introduce additional halakhic complexities, and mention <i>halakhot</i> that rarely come up in practice but are still worth noting.",
            "So as not to weigh the text down with limitless detail, I mention mainly the most well-known sources – <i>Shulḥan Arukh</i>, <i>Mishna Berura</i>, and <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> – where interested readers can find references to most <i>poskim</i> and commentators. When a particular view is identified with a specific <i>posek</i>, I mention that <i>posek</i> without mentioning all the <i>poskim</i> who concur.",
            "I would like to express my heartfelt appreciation to my father and teacher – Rabbi Zalman Baruch Melamed, Rosh Yeshiva and rabbi of Beit-El – to my mother and teacher, and to my dear wife. May it be God’s will that we be privileged to see all our offspring – sons and daughters, grandsons and granddaughters – advance in Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>, establish wonderful families, and increase truth, <i>ḥesed</i>, and peace forever.",
            "I would also like to thank R. Yaakov Katz (Ketzaleh), R. Yaakov Weinberger, R. Dudu Sa’ada, and R. Yisrael Sa’adia, who administrate so many of the institutions that were instrumental in enabling this project. May God grant all who help and assist the necessary wisdom and strength to succeed in their work. May they be privileged to establish beautiful families, and may God fulfill all their hearts’ desires in the best possible way.",
            "I am thankful to the residents of Har Bracha and the students of its yeshiva. It is through the daily classes to them that the issues addressed in the book are clarified. They, too, are partners in this endeavor. In particular, I would like to single out Rav Shlomi Badash for his enlightening comments, Rav Yonadav Zar for his help with the glosses and notes, Rav Refael Deluya for his expertise in the customs of Moroccan and North African Jewish communities, and my old friend Rav Ze’ev Sultanovitch for his wise suggestions and comments. The team that rendered this volume in English also deserves special mention: Rav Moshe Lichtman, who translated this volume, and the editorial team of Rav Maor Cayam, Rav Elli Fischer, Rav Daniel Landman, and Nechama Unterman for the multiple layers of editing and proofreading that brought this book into its final form. May we all merit magnifying and glorifying the Torah, participating in the rebuilding of our holy land, and witnessing the arrival of the just redeemer and the building of the Temple, speedily in our day.",

                    "God created the sun and the moon and placed them in the heavens, and time is marked by them. The sun shines during the day, the moon at night. Years are determined by the solar cycle, and months by the lunar cycle. Indeed, the Torah states: “God said, ‘Let there be luminaries in the heavenly firmament, to separate day from night; they shall serve as signs for the seasons, days, and years’” (Bereishit 1:14).",
                    "Each month, the moon makes one revolution around the earth. One can perceive this cycle by following the appearance of the moon. At the beginning of each month, the moon looks very small to us, like a thin sliver. Its apparent size gradually increases until the middle of the month, when it appears as a complete circle. During the second half of the month, the moon wanes, until it completely disappears at the end of the month for approximately 24 hours. Afterward, it reappears as a thin sliver once more, indicating that a new month has begun.",
                    "A full lunar cycle lasts approximately 29.5 days.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The precise duration of the lunar cycle is 29 days, 12 hours, and 793/1080ths of an hour (each portion or “<i>ḥelek</i>” of an hour is 3.3 seconds). The division of an hour into 1080 portions facilitates complex computations, as explained in MT, Laws of Sanctifying the Month 6:1-3.</i> Since this cycle does not coincide with the earth’s daily rotation around its axis, due to the extra half-day, a Jewish month lasts either 29 or thirty days. A 29-day month is called an “incomplete month,” while a thirty-day month is called a “full month.”",
                    "Establishing the beginning of a month is extremely important, as all of our festivals depend on the Hebrew date: Pesaḥ commences on the fifteenth of Nisan, Yom Kippur falls out on the tenth of Tishrei, Sukkot begins on the fifteenth of Tishrei, etc. In fact, it is so important that the Torah permits witnesses who have seen the new moon to desecrate Shabbat in order to travel to Jerusalem and testify before the <i>beit din</i> (rabbinical court; MT, Laws of Sanctifying the Month 3:2). The court would sanctify the new month based on their testimony and then dispatch messengers to inform all of Israel when the new month began."

                    "<b>Rosh Ḥodesh / The Authority to Set the Months Was Entrusted to Israel</b>",
                    "A new month does not automatically begin when the moon reappears. Rather, the <i>beit din</i> sanctifies the month, as it says, “This month shall mark <i>for you</i>” (Shemot 12:2). God showed Moshe the configuration of the moon in its renewed state and said, “This testimony shall be given over to you” (RH 22a). That is, witnesses must come before you and testify that they saw the new moon, and you shall sanctify the month based on their testimony.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If witnesses who saw the new moon on the night of the thirtieth day of the month come before the <i>beit din</i> the next day, the court sanctifies the month on that day, transforming the thirtieth day of the previous month into the first day of the new month: Rosh Ḥodesh. They then immediately offer the special Rosh Ḥodesh sacrifices. Consequently, the previous month is rendered an “incomplete month,” as it had only 29 days. If, however, no witnesses arrive on the thirtieth, Rosh Ḥodesh is the next day – the 31st – and the previous month is rendered a “full month,” consisting of a full thirty days. In such a case, the <i>beit din</i> does not need to hear witnesses’ testimony or declare the beginning of the new month, as in any case there are only two days on which Rosh Ḥodesh can possibly occur; if no witnesses come on the first day, Rosh Ḥodesh automatically falls out on the next day (MT, Laws of Sanctifying the Month 2:8).</i>",
                    "After Moshe’s death, the authority to establish the Jewish calendar was conferred upon the <i>Beit Din Ha-gadol</i> of every generation (the high Jewish court that functioned in earlier times; the Sanhedrin), on condition that its judges received <i>semikha </i>(rabbinic ordination) from another who has received <i>semikha </i>in an unbroken chain that originates with Moshe himself. Such ordination can only be transmitted in the Land of Israel (MT, Laws of Courts 4). If a time comes when the Jews are unable to set the months by way of a <i>beit din</i>, the <i>halakha</i> states that they must do so using mathematical calculations.",
                    "Thus, even though the lunar cycle is a natural phenomenon, the renewal of the moon does not, by itself, sanctify the month. Rather, the Jewish people sanctify the months, and by doing so enable the holiness of time to reveal itself. This explains why the Sages decided to end the middle <i>berakha</i> of the <i>Musaf</i> prayer on Rosh Ḥodesh with the words “Blessed are You, Lord, Who sanctifies Israel and the New Moons” (<i>Ber</i>. 49a). Perhaps this is also why the first mitzva the Torah commanded the Jewish people was the mitzva of sanctifying the new month (Shemot 12:2), as this mitzva showcases Israel’s unique sanctity – that the holiness of time reveals itself through them."

                    "<b>Rosh Ḥodesh / The History of the Sanctification of the Moon</b>",
                    "As a result of Roman persecution, Jewish settlement in the Holy Land dwindled during the talmudic period, while the larger community of Jews in Babylonia advanced in all areas. Nonetheless, the Sages of Eretz Yisrael retained the authority to sanctify months and intercalate years, as it says, “For<i> </i>Torah shall come forth from Zion” (Yeshayahu 2:3). They would dispatch messengers every month to inform the Jews residing in the Diaspora when the new month began. Only on rare occasions, like during the Beitar revolt, when the situation in the Holy Land was unbearable and the Sages were unable to sanctify the months, did they deviate from this procedure. During such times, judges ordained in Eretz Yisrael would leave the Land and travel to places that were free of such persecution and establish the order of the months and the years there.",
                    "Eventually, the Roman decrees intensified, and, as a result of Christian influence, targeted the Sages in an attempt to stop them from sanctifying the months. During this period, the rabbis sometimes would have to sanctify the month while in hiding and inform the Sages of Babylonia by sending them a secret letter (see <i>San</i>. 12a).",
                    "Toward the end of the talmudic period, Hillel II came to the conclusion that the <i>batei din </i>of Eretz Yisrael would no longer be able to sanctify the months. In addition, there were fears that hardships and evil decrees would lead to the termination of the institution of <i>semikha</i>. Since Hillel II, as the <i>nasi </i>(president) of the <i>Beit Din Ha-gadol</i> – having inherited the position in a generational chain from R. Yehuda Ha-Nasi – had the authority to set the calendar, he and his fellow judges took the initiative and calculated the months and years until the end of time and consecrated them. Thus, in the year 4119 of the Hebrew calendar (359 CE), the Jewish people began to count the months according to the Jewish calendar that Hillel II established. We pray that we will soon be privileged to witness the final redemption, when the <i>beit din</i> in Jerusalem will once again sanctify the months.",
                    "Rambam postulates the very novel idea that the sanctification of the months depends on the inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael, even after <i>semikha</i> was abolished. That is, when the Jews of the Holy Land calculate the order of the months based on the fixed formula used to establish the calendar, then the months are considered sanctified. If, however, no Jews lived in Eretz Yisrael, God forbid, the order of the months, along with all the festivals, would cease to exist. But far be it from God to act thus, for He has promised us in the Torah that the remnants of our nation will never be destroyed.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The main ideas presented here are taken from MT, Laws of Sanctifying the Month 5:1-3. In <i>Sefer Ha-mitzvot</i>, Positive Commandment 153, Rambam writes that the sanctification of the months is entrusted to the <i>Beit Din Ha-gadol</i>. Ramban, however, claims that a <i>beit din</i> of three will suffice. It may be that there is no argument here, as Rambam means to say that the months are sanctified merely by virtue of the foremost <i>beit din </i>of the generation, not that they actually must sanctify the months in practice.<br>As stated above, the months were sanctified primarily in Eretz Yisrael, and only in dire circumstances did the greatest rabbis of the generation, who were ordained in Eretz Yisrael, leave the Land in order to sanctify the months without interference from the kingdom. This is derived from a passage in <i>Berakhot</i> 63a:<br>When Ḥanina, R. Yehoshua’s nephew, went down to the Diaspora (after the Beitar revolt), he intercalated years and established months outside Eretz Yisrael. The rabbis of Eretz Yisrael sent two Torah scholars after him: R. Yossi b. Kipar and the grandson of Zekharia b. Kevutal. When he saw them, he said, “Why have you come?” They replied, “We have come to learn Torah.” He proclaimed, “These men are among the greatest rabbis of the generation, and their forefathers served in the Holy Temple.” He began declaring things impure while they declared them pure. He forbade certain acts and they permitted them. So he announced, “These men are worthless; they are empty.” They said to him, “You already built us up; you can no longer knock us down. You already built a fence; you can no longer breach it.” He responded, “Why is it that whenever I declare something impure you declare it pure; whenever I forbid something you permit it?” They answered, “Because you are intercalating years and establishing months outside Eretz Yisrael.” He said, “Didn’t Akiva b. Yosef intercalate years and establish months outside Eretz Yisrael?” They replied, “Leave aside the case of R. Akiva, for he did not leave behind anyone like him in Eretz Yisrael.” He said to them, “I, too, left no one behind like me in Eretz Yisrael.” They answered, “The kids you left behind have become goats with horns (i.e., the young students you left behind have become great Torah scholars in their own right), and they sent us to you, and this is what they told us: Go, tell him in our names to desist. If he listens – fine. But if he does not – excommunicate him. And tell our brethren in the Diaspora to desist as well. If they listen – fine. But if not – let them go up to the mountain, where Aḥiya will build an altar and Ḥanania will play the harp, and everyone will deny God, saying, ‘We have no portion in the God of Israel.’” Upon hearing this, the entire congregation immediately burst into tears and said, “God forbid! We do have a portion in the God of Israel.” And why all the fuss [not to establish the calendar outside Eretz Yisrael]? Because it says, “For Torah shall come forth from Zion, the word of the Lord from Jerusalem” (Yeshayahu 2:3).<br>We stated above that when <i>semikha </i>does not exist, the months are sanctified by way of mathematical calculations. According to Rambam, this is a <i>halakha le-Moshe mi-Sinai</i> (a law that God taught Moshe at Mount Sinai). This is why he does not mention Hillel II in his discussion on the topic. Ramban, on the other hand, writes that there is no source indicating that this is a <i>halakha le-Moshe mi-Sinai</i>. Rather, the truth is that in our times as well, the months are considered sanctified by rabbis who have undergone <i>semikha </i>– that is, based on Hillel II’s calculations. Consequently, Ramban does not require the existence of Jews living in Eretz Yisrael for the calculations to apply to them, as he maintains that the months are not established based on the calculations of those currently living in Eretz Yisrael, but rather upon Hillel II’s ancient calculations (see AHS 417:7).</i>"

                    "When a month is incomplete (29 days), the following Rosh Ḥodesh is observed for one day. When it is full (thirty days), the following Rosh Ḥodesh lasts two days: the thirtieth day of the previous month and the first day of the next month. Even though the second day is the main part of Rosh Ḥodesh – as it is the first day of the month, from which we count the subsequent days of the month – nevertheless, all the laws of Rosh Ḥodesh apply to the first day as well. We recite the <i>Hallel </i>and <i>Musaf</i> prayers and we insert <i>Ya’aleh Ve-yavo</i> into the <i>Amida </i>(the silent standing prayer, i.e., <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i>)<i> </i>and <i>Birkat Ha-mazon </i>(Grace after Meals). One who forgot to recite <i>Ya’aleh Ve-yavo</i> in <i>Shaḥarit</i> or <i>Minḥa</i> must repeat the <i>Amida</i>. Several explanations have been given for the practice of observing two days of Rosh Ḥodesh; see the footnote.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rosh Ḥodesh means the first day of month; why then is the thirtieth day of a full month also considered Rosh Ḥodesh? <i>Shibolei Ha-leket</i> 168, quoting Rabbeinu Shlomo and Rid, as well as <i>Birkei Yosef</i> 427, explain that on a full month, the new moon appears in the middle of the thirtieth day (after 29½ days). Therefore, even though the next day will be the first of the month (in order to balance out the months, as explained above, in section 1), nonetheless, it is fitting to treat the day on which the moon reappears as Rosh Ḥodesh as well. This is why we observe two days of Rosh Ḥodesh.<br><i>Tashbetz</i> 3:244 states that the Jews in ancient times would refrain from working and prepare festive meals in honor of Rosh Ḥodesh, already beginning to do so on the thirtieth day of the month, in case witnesses arrive and the <i>beit din</i> declares that day the first of the month. And if no one came to testify, they would treat the next day as Rosh Ḥodesh as well. Thus, whenever a month was full, they observed two days of Rosh Ḥodesh (similar to Rosh Ha-shana).<br>Even though the <i>musaf</i> sacrifices were offered exclusively on the first of the month, these two explanations indicate that both days are holy, and we therefore recite <i>Hallel</i>, <i>Musaf</i>, and <i>Ya’aleh Ve-yavo</i> on both days.<br>R. Shlomo Yosef Zevin writes in <i>Le-or Ha-halakha</i> (in an essay on Rosh Ḥodesh) that according to Rashi and <i>Shiltei Giborim</i> (<i>Rosh Ha-shana</i>, ch. 1), Jews used to observe only one day of Rosh Ḥodesh for a full month, while <i>Or Zaru’a</i> (vol. 2, <i>Hilkhot Rosh Ḥodesh</i>) and Maharsha (BM 59b) maintain that they observed two days.<br>These authorities also disagree how to interpret the verse, “But on the day after the new moon, the second day” (1 Shmuel 20:27). <i>Tashbetz</i> and Rabbeinu Yeshaya understand it as a reference to the second day of Rosh Ḥodesh, while Rashi and Radak maintain that it refers to the day after Rosh Ḥodesh – a regular day.<br>Some explain that we observe two days because we are uncertain which day is truly Rosh Ḥodesh. This opinion, however, has been rejected. Therefore, one who forgets to recite <i>Ya’aleh Ve-yavo</i> in <i>Shaḥarit</i> or <i>Minḥa</i> on either day must repeat the <i>Amida</i>.</i>"

                    "The Torah lists Rosh Ḥodesh together with all the other festivals on which we bring <i>musafim</i> (additional offerings) in honor of the day’s sanctity. The Sages derive from Eikha 1:15 that Rosh Ḥodesh is also called a <i>mo’ed</i> (fixed time) like all the other festivals (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 77a). In Temple times, trumpets would be sounded on Rosh Ḥodesh, as it says, “And on your joyous occasions – your fixed times and new moon days, you shall sound the trumpets over your burnt offerings and your sacrifices of well-being” (Bamidbar 10:10).",
                    "Because of the sanctity of Rosh Ḥodesh, a custom developed to go out and greet one’s rabbi, similar to the custom on Shabbat to say “<i>Shabbat shalom</i>” to the rabbi (2 Melakhim 4:23, RH 16b, BHL 301:4). There is also a custom to prepare festive meals on Rosh Ḥodesh (<i>cf</i>. 1 Shmuel 20).",
                    "The Torah uses a marvelous expression when describing the goat that would be sacrificed on Rosh Ḥodesh, calling it “a sin offering for the Lord” (Bamidbar 28:15). The Talmud (<i>Ḥullin</i> 60b) explains the essence of this matter. In the beginning, God created two great luminaries in the sky, the sun and the moon. The moon, in hopes that God would diminish the sun so that it alone could reign supreme, appealed to the Master of the World: “How can two kings share the same crown?” God, however, said to the moon, “Go and reduce yourself.” The moon replied, asking, “Because I made a justified claim before You, I should reduce myself?” God consoled the moon, telling it that the Jews would reckon the months according to its cycle, and that righteous people would be called by its name (i.e., they would use the epithet “the Small” in reference to the moon following its diminution). But the moon was not consoled, so God said, “Bring atonement for Me for making the moon smaller.” This is why it says, “And there shall be one goat as a sin offering for the Lord.”<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A goat was brought as a sin offering on all the holidays, but nowhere else does it say, “a sin offering <b>for</b> the Lord.” The other <i>musaf</i> (additional) sacrifices offered on Rosh Ḥodesh were: two bullocks, one ram, and seven sheep as a wholly-burnt offering (Bamidbar 28:11).</i>",
                    "This is a very profound concept, but on a simple level, the moon’s reduction symbolizes the deficiencies that exist in creation – the descent of the soul when it arrives in this world and all the failures that man experiences during his lifetime. All these failures and deficiencies are prerequisites for subsequent growth, because coping with hardships helps one reach higher heights in the end, as R. Abahu says, “The wholly righteous cannot stand where penitents stand” (<i>Ber</i>. 34b). In the meantime, though, people commit sins that cause great pain in the world. In order to relieve this pain and repair the flaws, God commanded us to sacrifice a goat as a sin offering. This is the purpose of Rosh Ḥodesh: to show us how a new beginning sprouts from the moon’s reduction, which happened as a result of its sinful indictment of God. Therefore, Rosh Ḥodesh is a good time for new beginnings and repentance; indeed, it is a time of profound joy. However, until the world is redeemed from all its deficiencies, the joy of Rosh Ḥodesh is slightly hidden and is not completely revealed (see also below, sections 15-16)."

Therefore, while it is meritorious to enjoy special meals on Rosh Ḥodesh, one is not obligated to do so (SA<i> </i>419:1).",
                    "Nevertheless, one may not grieve on Rosh Ḥodesh, and therefore one may not fast on the day (<i>ibid</i>. 418:1). Anyone who refrains from eating on Rosh Ḥodesh, even for a short period of time, with the intention of fasting, transgresses this prohibition. But if, by chance, one neglected to eat for several hours, there is no reason for concern (BHL 418, s.v. “Rosh Ḥodesh assur”; <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 418:3). Technically, one who ate only fruits on Rosh Ḥodesh is not considered one who has fasted and thus transgressed; rather, he simply failed to fulfill the mitzva of enjoying festive meals on Rosh Ḥodesh.<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi states in <i>Ta’anit</i> 15b, “Even though it is called <i>mo’ed</i>, the Torah does not call it a day of feasting and joy.” Rosh (<i>Ber.</i> 7:23) concurs, stating that we do not insert the word <i>simḥa</i> (joy) into the corrective <i>berakha</i> for <i>Birkat Ha-mazon</i> on Rosh Ḥodesh (see below n. 14). In contrast, <i>Yerei’im</i> 227 states, “One is obligated to rejoice on Rosh Ḥodesh,” though there is no obligation to eat bread at the meal, because one can satisfy the requirement of joy by eating meat and drinking wine. The final <i>halakha</i> remains as stated above.<br>Rambam maintains that fasting on Rosh Ḥodesh is prohibited by Torah law, while <i>Beit Yosef</i> 418 maintains that it is rabbinically prohibited. There was a custom among the <i>ḥasidim rishonim </i>(pious people of yore) to fast on two particular Rosh Ḥodesh days –<i> </i>the first of Nisan, because Aharon’s sons died on that date, and the first of<i> </i>Av, because Aharon himself died on that date (SA<i> </i>580:2).

Eating meat and drinking wine are also ways to beautify the mitzva in honor of Rosh Ḥodesh. According to <i>Yerei’im</i>, however, it is an actual mitzva, as mentioned in the previous note. This is why most Sephardic Jews only begin to refrain from eating meat and drinking wine from the second of Av, in order to uphold the honor of Rosh Ḥodesh. The Ashkenazic custom is to refrain from meat and wine on Rosh Ḥodesh Av as well (see below 8:13).<br>MB 419:2 states that there is no need to conduct a festive meal on Rosh Ḥodesh night, but <i>Responsa Rema</i> <i>Mi-Fano</i> §79 and <i>Eshel Avraham</i> (Buczacz) maintain that there is a mitzva to do so.</i>",

                    "One may work on Rosh Ḥodesh. Ideally, though, one should not do so, as is the law on <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i>. The rule is that the holier the day, the more it is designated for holy endeavors, and the more one should limit his involvement in work. Thus, all work is forbidden on Shabbat, because it is the holiest of all our special days. Work is also forbidden on Yom Tov (festival), which is a level below Shabbat in sanctity, but one may perform activities that are necessary for food preparation. A level below Yom Tov is <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i>, when only certain acts are forbidden. Rosh Ḥodesh should rightfully be on par with <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i>. However, since the twelve tribes of Israel sinned in the episode of the Golden Calf, they correspondingly lost the special quality of the twelve Rashei Ḥodashim of the year. Women, however, did not participate in the sin of the Golden Calf, refusing to give their jewelry in order to help create it. Therefore, God rewarded them in this world and in the World to Come. In this world, God instituted that “they observe Rosh Ḥodesh more than the men do.” God also promised that in the World to Come, they will regain their youthfulness, like the moon that renews itself every month, as it says, “He satisfies you with good things in the prime of life, so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s” (Tehilim 103:5;<i>Pirkei De-Rabbi Eliezer</i> 45). As a result, women absorb more of the sanctity of Rosh Ḥodesh, and they have thus adopted the custom to refrain from working then. <sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This follows the explanation of <i>Pirkei De-Rabbi Eliezer</i> 45, <i>Tur</i> 417, <i>Perisha</i> 417:1, and <i>Darkhei Moshe</i> 417:1 (quoting <i>Or Zaru’a</i>) explain the issue. R. Ḥayim Vital explains in <i>Sha’ar Ha-kavanot</i> 76b that women correspond to the <i>sefira</i> (kabbalistic “emanation”) of <i>malkhut</i> (kingship) and the moon, both of which renew themselves, while men correspond to <i>tiferet</i> (beauty), which does not renew itself. (Furthermore, <i>malkhut</i> involves a decline, from which it can reach even higher than <i>tiferet</i>. This is alluded to in the verse, “A capable wife is a crown for her husband” [Mishlei 12:4].)</i>",
                    "In truth, in the time of the Temple, when the Kohanim (priests) brought <i>musaf</i> offerings, some men also would refrain from doing major work on Rosh Ḥodesh. But their practice is no longer binding, because they participated in the sin of the Golden Calf. Women, on the other hand, did not sin, and thus have more of a connection to the sanctity of Rosh Ḥodesh. As a result, their practice remains valid.",
                    "Therefore, every woman should refrain from doing certain types of work on Rosh Ḥodesh – knitting, for example – in order to differentiate between Rosh Ḥodesh and ordinary days. It goes without saying that she should not plan to do any big jobs on Rosh Ḥodesh.",
                    "Some women go above and beyond and refrain from doing any type of work that is forbidden on <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i>. This includes sewing, knitting, and fixing things in the house. Cooking, baking, and ironing, however, are permitted, as they are permitted on <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i> as well. Washing clothing in a washing machine is also permitted, because it entails almost no effort. If the clothes are needed for Rosh Ḥodesh itself, one may wash them even by hand. An employed woman may work on Rosh Ḥodesh, even if she generally follows the practice of those who go above and beyond, because if she misses work regularly on Rosh Ḥodesh, she might lose her job. And even if there is no concern that she will be fired, she may go to work if she needs the money or if her absence will cause her employer to lose money.<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tur</i> and <i>Beit Yosef</i> OḤ 417 explain that the main source for this custom is <i>y. Ta’anit</i> 1:6: “Those women who are accustomed not to work on Rosh Ḥodesh – it is a custom.” According to Rabbeinu Yeruḥam, a woman who never followed such a custom need not take it on. However, BHL 417, s.v. “ve-hanashim,” states that according to most Rishonim, all women must keep this custom, but they can fulfill their obligation by refraining from any minimal type of work. If, however, they have a more stringent custom that forbids additional types of work, their custom is binding. Indeed, some act more stringently, and I wrote that this is considered going above and beyond. <i>Eshel Avraham</i> (Buczacz) states that even those who go above and beyond should not treat Rosh Ḥodesh<i> </i>more stringently than they do <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i>. Therefore, they may wash clothes for the sake of Rosh Ḥodesh, because the reason for the prohibition on <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed </i>is only to ensure that people wash their clothes in anticipation of the holiday. Regarding washing machines: <i>Sefer Rosh Ḥodesh</i> 11:7 states that some are stringent, but that R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach permits it, because it involves no effort.<br>AHS 417:10 states that a woman may work on Rosh Ḥodesh in order to make a living, and that this is the prevalent custom. <i>Hilkhot Ḥagim</i> 1:5 agrees. This can be derived from a <i>kal va-ḥomer</i> (<i>a fortiori</i> argument): If she is liable to lose her job, or if she needs that day’s wages desperately, she may work even on <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i>. Thus, it is all the more so on Rosh Ḥodesh, which is a lesser holiday. Some women go above and beyond and forgo working that day if they can do so easily. It seems to me that even women who go above and beyond are lenient when it comes to writing for purposes that are not related to work.<br>According to <i>Shibolei Ha-leket</i>, when Rosh Ḥodesh is two days long, the custom for women to refrain from working applies only on the second day, the first of the new month. <i>Roke’aḥ</i> maintains that it applies on both days. <i>Mor U-ketzi’a</i> maintains that the custom applies only during the day on Rosh Ḥodesh, not at night. It seems to me that women follow this custom at night as well. See MB 417:4, BHL (end of 417).<br>BHL 417, s.v. “minhag tov,” states in the name of <i>Baḥ</i> that a husband may not demand that his wife work on Rosh Ḥodesh, but she may work if she desires. As stated above, most <i>poskim</i> agree that a woman should refrain from doing some form of work. Since it is a mitzva for a woman to refrain from working, even though it is not obligatory, it is clear that her husband cannot demand that she work on Rosh Ḥodesh, except for housework, like cooking.<br>Ḥida (<i>Responsa Yosef Ometz</i> §20) cites Rishonim who maintain that men had a custom as well to refrain from working on Rosh Ḥodesh. He explains that this custom developed because they would bow before God in the Holy Temple. <i>Turei Even</i> (on Tractate <i>Megilla</i>) claims that the custom was based on the <i>musaf</i> sacrifices that were offered in the Temple on Rosh Ḥodesh. Either way, most <i>poskim</i> believe that this custom is not binding (MB 417:2).</i>"

                    "On the Shabbat preceding Rosh Ḥodesh (known as <i>Shabbat Mevarkhim</i>), it is customary to announce when Rosh Ḥodesh will take place and recite <i>Birkat Ha-ḥodesh </i>(“blessing the new month”),<i> </i>a prayer that God “renew this month for us and for all His people, the house of Israel, for good and blessing.” In a certain way, this prayer also commemorates the sanctification of the new moon by the <i>beit din</i> of old. Therefore, it is customary to announce the exact time at which the new moon will appear. This event is known as the <i>molad</i>, signifying the moon’s “rebirth.” This is also why we stand during the ceremony, as people used to stand before the <i>beit din</i> when it would perform the mitzva of sanctifying the new moon. The only month before which we do not recite <i>Birkat Ha-ḥodesh</i> is Tishrei. The reason for this is that everyone knows when Rosh Ḥodesh<i> </i>Tishrei is coming, as it is also the holiday of Rosh Ha-shana.<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">MB 417:1 and <i>Igrot Moshe, </i>OḤ 1:142. <i>Sefer Rosh Ḥodesh </i>ch. 1 nn. 4-8 quotes <i>Yerei’im</i>, <i>Shibolei Ha-leket</i>, and <i>Or Zaru’a</i>, which state that we recite <i>Birkat Ha-ḥodesh</i> to let people know when Rosh Ḥodesh is going to take place. Raavya writes that it is in commemoration of the sanctification of the new moon. For this reason, some communities give the rabbi the honor of blessing the new moon (<i>Sefer Rosh Ḥodesh</i> 1:7). What I wrote concerning our omission of <i>Birkat Ha-ḥodesh </i>before Tishrei is found in SHT 417:2.).</i>",
                    "We announce the coming of the new month specifically on Shabbat because that is when the entire congregation is gathered in the synagogue, and everyone will hear when Rosh Ḥodesh is set to take place. Furthermore, all the days of the week receive blessing from Shabbat, and even the sanctity of Rosh Ḥodesh flows from the Shabbat that precedes it. Therefore, we bless the new month on that day. Because of this, on <i>Shabbat Mevarkhim </i>we already begin to feel the festiveness of the forthcoming Rosh Ḥodesh.<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is why Ashkenazim refrain from reciting memorial prayers for the dead on <i>Shabbat Mevarkhim</i> (Rema 284:7, MB 284:17). They even omit the <i>Av Ha-raḥamim</i> prayer, which is said in memory of those killed in sanctification of God’s name. The only exceptions are the <i>Shabbatot</i> prior to Rosh Ḥodesh Iyar and Rosh Ḥodesh Sivan, because the holy martyrs were killed mainly during these two months. My teacher and master, Rav Zvi Yehuda Kook, would recite <i>Av Ha-raḥamim</i> even on an ordinary <i>Shabbat Mevarkhim</i>. He maintained that after the Holocaust it should be said on every Shabbat, just like it is said on <i>Shabbat Mevarkhim </i>before Rosh Ḥodesh Iyar and Rosh Ḥodesh Sivan.</i>"

After all, the Sages instituted our prayers in place of the offerings, and the Torah commands us to bring a <i>musaf</i> offering on Rosh Ḥodesh. Therefore, the Sages prescribed that we recite the <i>Ya’aleh Ve-yavo</i> prayer, in which we beseech God to remember us for good on Rosh Ḥodesh. They inserted it in the <i>berakha</i> of <i>Retzei</i> because that is where we ask God to restore the divine service to the Holy Temple, making it an appropriate place to mention Rosh Ḥodesh; once the divine service is restored we will be able to offer the <i>musaf</i> of Rosh Ḥodesh.

One who forgot to recite <i>Ya’aleh Ve-yavo</i> in the final <i>Minḥa</i> service of Rosh Ḥodesh should recite the <i>Amida</i> twice in <i>Ma’ariv</i>, stipulating beforehand that if he is not obligated to recite the <i>Amida</i> twice, his second <i>Amida </i>should be considered a voluntary prayer (SA 108:11; <i>Peninei Halakha</i>: <i>Prayer</i> 18:10).<br>Customarily, the <i>gabbai</i> (sexton) calls out, “Rosh Ḥodesh” or “<i>Ya’aleh Ve-yavo</i>” prior to the <i>Amida</i> of <i>Ma’ariv</i> (SA 236:2).

The reason we repeat these verses is to continue the pattern of the beginning of Tehilim 118, in which every idea is repeated. This pattern ends at “I will thank You,” but we continue the pattern in <i>Hallel </i>by repeating the rest of the verses of that chapter as well.

The Talmud states in <i>Megilla</i> 22a that one may not interrupt a verse in the middle, except for the purpose of teaching young children. <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Sukka</i> 38b) answer that it is not a true interruption in this case, since this verse was composed by two distinct parties: David and his brothers. <i>Kol Bo</i> suggests that the prohibition of splitting a verse in two only applies to verses from the Torah (MA 422:8).

The passage that we read first describes the daily burnt offering, followed by the special Rosh Ḥodesh offerings (Bamidbar 28:1-15). This alludes to the fact that one can extend the fixed and continuous sanctity of the twice-daily burnt offering into the special sanctity of Rosh Ḥodesh, which represents renewal, atonement, and repentance.",
                    "After we read the Torah and recite <i>Ashrei</i> and <i>U-va Le-Tziyon</i> (and according to some Sephardim, <i>Beit Yaakov</i> and <i>Shir shel Yom </i>[The Psalm of the Day] as well), we recite the <i>Amida</i> of <i>Musaf</i>. This prayer is comprised of the usual three opening <i>berakhot </i>and three closing <i>berakhot</i>, with one middle <i>berakha</i> about Rosh Ḥodesh, which concludes, “Blessed are You, God, Who sanctifies Israel and the New Moons.”",

Since the <i>Musaf</i> prayer on Rosh Ḥodesh is considered a sign as well, we likewise do not need the additional sign of <i>tefilin</i> (SA 423:4, MB <i>ad loc. </i>10). It is customary to remove the <i>tefilin</i> after the <i>Kaddish</i> that precedes <i>Musaf</i>. It is proper to begin the <i>Amida</i> only after the <i>tefilin</i> are completely wrapped in their straps and stored away in their containers, as it is disrespectful to leave one’s <i>tefilin </i>in a state of disarray throughout the <i>Musaf</i> service.<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Beit Yosef</i> 25:13 gives a different reason: It is inappropriate to be without the ‘crown’ of <i>tefilin</i> when reciting the stanza that describes the angels crowning God in the <i>Kedusha</i> of <i>Musaf</i>. However, even Ashkenazim, who omit this stanza, are accustomed to removing their <i>tefilin</i> before <i>Musaf</i>. Therefore, I cited <i>Levush</i>’s explanation that <i>Musaf</i> is considered a sign of the covenant, similar to Yom Tov, when we do not wear <i>tefilin</i> (SA<i> </i>31:1). The prevalent custom is to remove the <i>tefilin</i> after <i>Kaddish</i> (according to Ba’al Ha-Tanya’s <i>siddur</i>, they are removed before <i>Kaddish</i>).<br>This raises a question regarding the common practice to don <i>tefilin</i> at the <i>brit mila</i> of one’s son, in order to be surrounded by two signs. Do we not learn from the fact that we do not wear <i>tefilin</i> on Shabbat and Yom Tov that one should not display two signs together, as each one implies that the other is insufficient, thus degrading both (SA 31:1)? <i>Eliya Rabba</i> 29:1 answers in the name of <i>Roke’aḥ</i> that the sign of <i>brit mila</i> does not commemorate the Exodus from Egypt; therefore, one may combine it with another sign. <i>Tefilin</i>, Shabbat, and Yom Tov, however, commemorate the Exodus and should not be combined.</i>",

                    "In <i>Birkat Ha-levana </i>(the <i>Berakha</i> of the Moon), we thank God for creating the moon, from whose light we benefit at night. Many Jews have attached special honor and affection to this <i>berakha</i>, as it alludes to deep concepts concerning the Jewish people. We will explain some of these concepts here.",
                    "Of all the heavenly bodies, the moon is most similar to us. Just as a person’s life is filled with ups and downs, the moon waxes and wanes through the course of each month. In the middle of the month, the moon appears full, but as it nears the end of the month it dwindles and disappears. And just as Adam, the first man, gave in to his pride and desires and ate from the Tree of Knowledge and was punished, the moon was not satisfied being equally luminous as the sun, asking instead to rule over it (see above, section 5). In retribution for the moon’s arrogance, God reduced its light and even created the lunar cycle in which it wanes every month, eventually disappearing for an entire day. However, unlike man, who eventually fades away and dies, the moon remains part of the heavenly hosts and is fixed and everlasting, always regenerating itself. The Jewish people have the exact same qualities. On the one hand, they lead normal human lives, which include ups and downs, a good inclination as well as an evil inclination. On the other hand, their connection to faith and God is everlasting. Therefore, unlike other nations, the Jewish people will endure forever. We connect to this idea of Israel’s immortality through <i>Birkat Ha-levana</i>, which we recite upon seeing the moon reappear and begin to grow anew every month.",
                    "Moreover, not only do we manage to survive despite all the hardships that we experience, we actually advance to a higher level as a result of each crisis and setback. King David taught us how to transform each setback into an impetus for greater growth. The Sages relate that David was the lowliest of his brothers, growing up in the fields among the animals, but he succeeded in maturing and improving from every experience. Even after his difficult fall in the sin of Bat-Sheva, he did not despair. Rather, he repented completely, to the point where the Sages say that “he established the yoke of repentance” (<i>Mo’ed Katan</i> 16b). David transformed his awful failure into tremendous self-improvement, and ever since then we learn from him the ways of repentance and the true extent of its power. By virtue of his repentance, David’s kingdom is everlasting, just as the moon always rejuvenates after its decline.",
                    "This is why David’s kingdom is compared to the moon, and it is also why we recite in the <i>Kiddush Levana</i> ceremony, “David, King of Israel, lives and endures.” The Jewish people grow from every setback as well, rectifying all their sins and blemishes, until they will eventually be privileged to perfect the world under the sovereignty of God. At that time, the moon, which symbolizes our situation in the world, will also return to its perfected state, when its light will be as bright as the sun’s. Thus, we beseech God in <i>Birkat Ha-levana</i>, “It [the moon] should renew itself as a crown of glory for those He carried from the womb, for they [Israel] are destined to be renewed like it, and to praise their Creator for the sake of His glorious majesty.”",

May the light of the moon be like the light of the sun and like the light of the seven days of creation as it was before it was diminished, as it says, “The two great luminaries” (Bereishit 1:16). And may there be fulfilled for us the verse: “They shall seek the Lord their God, and David their king” (Hoshe’a 3:5). Amen.<sup>21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numerous <i>midrashim</i> indicate that the non-Jews at the time followed the solar calendar. The reason for this is tied to man’s desire to utilize the sun, which stems from a desire for absolute perfection. However, the truth is that this is beyond man’s reach. And since the non-Jews fail to attain absolute perfection, they forfeit what they could have achieved by revealing God’s name in the world. By contrast, the Jews know how to operate within this world while clinging to God, which manifests itself through constant self-perfection. Calculating the months according to the lunar cycle alludes to our efforts in this world, while calculating the years according to the solar calendar alludes to our constant aspiration for perfection. The Islamic calendar’s use of lunar months is based on the Hebrew calendar, but theirs is a purely lunar calendar that does not account for the solar year. This signifies a lack of aspiration for continuous self-perfection and an entrenchment in this world. It also explains why Islam perceives reward, even in the hereafter, in predominantly physical terms.<br>It is important to add that even when the moon is invisible to us, it is not actually gone; it is merely hidden from view. When this occurs, none of the light it absorbs from the sun is reflected toward the earth, thus making it indiscernible to us. The same is true of the nation of Israel: Even when it is in a period of descent, its inner essence remains unblemished; “Every part of you is fair, my darling, there is no blemish in you” (Shir Ha-shirim 4:7).</i>"

Thus, in the academy of Rabbi Yishmael it was taught: “Were the people of Israel privileged to greet the presence of their heavenly Father only once a month (when reciting <i>Birkat Ha-levana</i>), it would have been sufficient for them” (<i>San</i>. 42a). Therefore, Abaye concluded that one must honor the <i>berakha</i> and recite it while standing (<i>San</i>. 42a.). One who finds it difficult to stand should lean on his cane or a friend and recite the <i>berakha</i>.

After all, we learned above that <i>Birkat Ha-levana</i> is compared to greeting the <i>Shekhina</i>. Therefore, one should approach reciting this <i>berakha </i>as if one is going out to greet a king. One who is sick or concerned that he might catch a cold if he ventures outside may view the moon through a window and recite the <i>berakha</i> indoors (MB 426:21).",

One may not recite the <i>berakha</i> if he sees the moon at twilight, because the sun’s light is still visible then and thus one does not benefit purely from the light of the moon at that time (Rema 426:1). Before reciting the <i>berakha</i>, one must look at the moon for a moment in order to derive pleasure from its light, but it is customary not to look at the moon when actually reciting the <i>berakha</i> (MB 426:13, <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 426:34). If one recites the <i>berakha</i> when the moon is covered by clouds he has not fulfilled his obligation, because he cannot benefit from its light.

Some authorities write that it is preferable to postpone <i>Birkat Ha-levana</i> in such a situation, but technically one may recite the <i>berakha</i> even if a thin cloud passes underneath the moon, since one can still derive benefit from its light. It seems to me that as long as one can discern the outline of the moon through the cloud, one may recite the <i>berakha</i>.<sup>23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Radbaz 1:341 writes that it primarily depends on one’s ability to derive benefit from the moon’s light, and many Aḥaronim cite this position, including MA and MB 426:3. However, Ḥida writes in <i>Moreh Be-etzba</i> §184 that one may not recite the <i>berakha</i> if the moon is covered by even a very thin cloud, and <i>Ben Ish Ḥai</i>, Year 2<i>, </i>Vayikra 23 concurs. Nevertheless, it seems that all agree that technically one may recite the <i>berakha</i> as long as one benefits from the moon’s light. This is the conclusion of <i>Yalkut Yosef</i> 426:5.<br><i>Eshel Avraham</i> (Buczacz) explains that one may recite the <i>berakha</i> if the light of the moon allows one to see most of the things that are usually visible when the moon is unobstructed.

According to this opinion, one may recite the <i>berakha</i> toward the middle of the month (when there is more moonlight) even if the moon is covered by a thicker cloud, and one may recite it toward the beginning of the month (when there is less moonlight) only if the cloud is very thin. The <i>poskim</i>, however, seem to indicate that the distinction depends only on the thickness of the cloud, irrespective of the day on which the <i>berakha</i> is recited.

This is apparent from the words of <i>Terumat Ha-deshen</i> quoted in <i>Leket Yosher</i>: “Once, he saw only a small portion of the moon, because it was partially covered by a cloud, and he nevertheless sanctified it.”<br>Some wrote that one should look at the moon only briefly. See MB 426:13 and <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 426:34.<br>Many authorities write that one who recited the <i>berakha</i> without looking at the moon has fulfilled his obligation, as long as he could have seen it had he looked. They derive this, by logical inference, from the law of a blind person. Most <i>poskim</i> maintain that a blind person must recite <i>Birkat Ha-levana</i>, because the <i>berakha</i> was instituted in recognition of the moon’s renewal and thus applies whether or not one can see it. In addition, even blind people benefit from the moon, as others use its light to escort them. This is the viewpoint of Maharshal, MA, <i>Eliya Rabba</i>, and <i>Pri Ḥadash</i>. However, Maharikash maintains that a blind person should not recite the <i>berakha</i>, as he does not derive pleasure from the moon. In practice, a blind person should not recite the <i>berakha</i>, because of the uncertainty surrounding the matter. Nevertheless, it is preferable that he hear the <i>berakha</i> from someone else (see MB 426:1; BHL 426, s.v. “nehenin”; <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 426:2).<br></i>",

                    "Many Rishonim maintain that the time for reciting <i>Birkat Ha-levana</i> begins on the first day the moon is visible, and that the earlier one recites the <i>berakha</i> the better (MT, Laws of <i>Berakhot</i> 10:17; Rosh; and others). Several <i>poskim</i>, however, posit that it is preferable to wait until the moon grows somewhat, when it is possible to benefit from its light. Some say that one should wait until three whole days pass, as that is when the moon’s light begins to be usable (R. Saadia Gaon, <i>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yona</i>), while others say that seven days must pass, because that is when one can begin to truly benefit from its light (<i>Responsa Rema</i> <i>Mi-Fano</i> §78). According to some of the greatest kabbalists – most notably, R. Yosef Gikatilla – one should wait seven days, for kabbalistic reasons. They explain that the renewal of the moon’s light alludes to man’s renewal, and whenever there is a new development there is concern that God’s attribute of justice might prosecute and hinder the new growth. Therefore, it is proper to wait seven days, like the seven days of creation, since by then the moon’s light will have stabilized and the attribute of justice can no longer prosecute against the new beginning.",
                    "The Sephardic and Hasidic custom is to wait until the seventh of the month to recite the <i>berakha</i> (SA 426:4), while the Ashkenazic custom is to recite it after three days have passed (<i>Baḥ</i>, MB 426:20). In practice, though, it is customary to recite <i>Birkat Ha-levana </i>on <i>Motza’ei Shabbat</i>, so that the <i>berakha</i> can be recited joyously, while wearing nice clothing. Thus, practically speaking, Ashkenazim and Moroccan Jews recite <i>Birkat Ha-levana</i> on the <i>Motza’ei Shabbat </i>that follows three whole days after the <i>molad</i>, while Sephardim and Ḥasidim recite it on the first <i>Motza’ei Shabbat</i> after the seventh of the month.",
                    "There is a dispute regarding how to act when the seventh of the month begins on a <i>Motza’ei Shabbat</i>, but seven complete days from the time of the <i>molad</i> (168 hours) have not yet passed. Some authorities maintain that we postpone the <i>berakha</i> until the next night or the next <i>Motza’ei Shabbat</i>, which will fall out on the fourteenth of the month (Rashash, R. Shneur Zalman of Liadi, <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 426:61). Others contend that even if a few hours remain until the end of the seventh day after the <i>molad</i>, one may recite <i>Birkat Ha-levana</i> (<i>Knesset Ha-gedola</i>, <i>Yeḥaveh Da’at</i> 2:24). If people from different ethnic backgrounds pray together and the seventh of the month falls out on a <i>Motza’ei Shabbat</i>, it is proper for everyone to recite <i>Birkat Ha-levana</i>, as that is the position of the majority of <i>poskim</i>.<sup>25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Beit Yosef</i> and SA 426:4, <i>Baḥ</i> and MB <i>ad loc</i>., <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 426:61, <i>Sefer Kiddush Levana</i> 3:1-2. Many Rishonim maintain that the <i>berakha</i> should be recited immediately upon the moon’s reappearance at the beginning of the month. R. Yaakov Rakaḥ writes in <i>Shulḥan Leḥem Ha-panim</i> that this seems to be the opinion of R. Amram Gaon, <i>Behag</i>, Rif, Rambam, Rosh, and others. <i>Baḥ</i> points out that the Talmud implies that one should not recite <i>Kiddush Levana</i> after the seventh day. Rambam, as well, indicates that it is preferable to recite it as early as possible. On the other hand, some <i>poskim</i> infer from <i>Sofrim</i> 20:1 that one should not recite <i>Birkat Ha-levana</i> until it is possible to benefit from its light. <i>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yona</i>, R. David Abudraham, <i>Kol Bo</i>, and others espouse this viewpoint. This is also the practical implication of the discussion cited above in n. 22. According to Kabbala, one should recite the <i>berakha</i> after seven days. In practice, the Ashkenazic custom is to recite <i>Birkat Ha-levana </i>after three days have passed. This is also the custom of North African Jews (R. Shalom Messas and many others). Most Sephardim and Ḥasidim, based on Kabbala, are accustomed to reciting the <i>berakha</i> after seven days. Moreover, some Ashkenazim follow this custom <i>le-khatḥila</i>, as Ḥatam Sofer OḤ 102 and AHS 426:13 state. Nonetheless, when the seventh day falls out on a <i>Motza’ei Shabbat</i>, it seems preferable to recite <i>Birkat Ha-levana</i> then, even if seven complete days from the <i>molad</i> have not yet passed. After all, there is already abundant moonlight and part of a day is often regarded in <i>halakha</i> as an entire day. Moreover, <i>Motza’ei Shabbat</i> is a joyous time, which makes it particularly suited for <i>Birkat Ha-levana</i>. In addition, several <i>poskim</i> maintain that one should recite the <i>berakha</i> as early as possible (Ramban and his adherents), while others assert that one should not recite it after the seventh of the month (<i>Baḥ</i>). Therefore, it is proper to recite it on the night of the seventh day, even if seven complete days have not passed since the <i>molad</i>. This is how <i>Knesset Ha-gedola</i>, <i>Responsa Rema</i> <i>Mi-Fano</i> §78, <i>Nahar Mitzrayim</i>, <i>Eliya Rabba</i>, <i>Eshel Avraham</i> (Buczacz), Maharsham, and others conclude.<br><b>Women and Birkat Ha-levana</b>: Since this <i>berakha</i> is time-dependent, women are exempt from reciting it. And even though according to Ashkenazic custom, women may recite time-bound <i>berakhot</i>, the prevalent custom is that women do not to recite <i>Birkat Ha-levana </i>(MB 426:1). See <i>Peninei Halakha</i>:<i> Women’s Prayer</i> ch. 23 n. 1.</i>",
                    "One who failed to recite <i>Birkat Ha-levana</i> by the seventh of the month may recite it until the end of the night of the fifteenth, because the moon is still waxing until then. Afterward, however, the moon begins to wane; therefore, the <i>berakha</i> cannot be said from the night of the sixteenth and onward (SA 426:3).",
                    "Preferably, one should take into account the opinion of Maharil, who maintains that one may not recite <i>Birkat Ha-levana</i> after half of the lunar cycle has elapsed (fourteen days, eighteen hours, and approximately twenty minutes, from the time of the <i>molad</i>). This time rarely elapses by the beginning of the night of the fourteenth. By the night of the fifteenth, the lunar cycle sometimes reaches the halfway mark and sometimes does not (Rema 426:3, <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 426:53). Nevertheless, in practice, one who did not recite the <i>berakha</i> by the night of the fourteenth may recite it until the end of the night of the fifteenth (BHL 426:3, <i>Yabi’a Omer</i> 8:42)."

                    "Starting from the night of the <i>omer</i> harvest, there is a mitzva to count 49 days, which are seven weeks. This is known as<i> sefirat ha-omer</i>, counting the <i>omer</i>.<i> </i>The <i>omer</i> harvest took place on the sixteenth of Nisan, the night after the first day of Pesaḥ. That night, they would go out to the fields and harvest barley, bring them to the Temple courtyard, thresh them, winnow them, separate out the chaff, roast the grains, grind them well, produce a tenth of an <i>eifa</i> of flour, sift it through thirteen sieves, mix it with a <i>log</i> of oil, and place a <i>kometz </i>(handful) of frankincense on it. The next day, part of the mixture would be offered on the altar. First, a <i>kohen</i> would wave it; then he would separate a <i>kometz</i> from the mixture and burn it on the altar. After the <i>kometz</i> was burned up, everyone was permitted to eat from the newly harvested grain.",
                    "Unlike other festivals, Shavu’ot does not have a calendar date. Whereas Pesaḥ begins on the fifteenth of Nisan and Sukkot on the fifteenth of Tishrei, Shavu’ot’s date is determined by the <i>omer</i> count: the festival begins after the seven-week count is completed, which is why it is called <i>Ḥag Ha-shavu’ot</i> – the Festival of Weeks. This is the meaning of the verse: “You shall count off seven weeks; start to count seven weeks from when the sickle is first put to the standing grain, and then you shall observe the Festival of Weeks for the Lord your God” (Devarim 16:9-10). It also says:<br>And from the day on which you bring the sheaf (<i>omer</i>)<i> </i>of elevation offering – the day after the “Shabbat” – you shall count off seven weeks. They must be complete: You must count until the day after the seventh week – fifty days; then you shall bring an offering of new grain to the Lord. (Vayikra 23:15-16)",
                    "This mitzva is not incumbent upon the <i>beit din</i> alone; rather, every Jew is commanded to count 49 days. The mitzva is to verbalize the count. There is a general principle that applies to <i>mitzvot</i> that require speech-acts: “<i>Shome’a ke-oneh</i>” (“One who hears is as one who responds”). Thus, for example, one can fulfill the mitzva of remembering Amalek by hearing a public reading of <i>Parashat Zakhor</i>, and one can fulfill his obligation to recite a <i>berakha</i> over the counting of the <i>omer</i> by hearing the <i>berakha </i>of the <i>ḥazan</i>. With regard to the actual counting, however, several <i>poskim</i> maintain that each person must verbalize the count, as it says, “<i>u-sefartem </i><b><i>lakhem</i></b>” – literally,<i> </i>“count <b>for yourselves</b>” (<i>Levush, Ḥok Yaakov</i>). Although others maintain that the status of <i>sefirat ha-omer </i>is identical to that of other <i>mitzvot </i>that require speech-acts, and consequently that one may discharge his obligation by hearing someone else count (<i>Pri Ḥadash, Birkei Yosef</i>), nevertheless, <i>le-khatḥila</i>, to satisfy all opinions, each person must verbalize the count (see MB 489:5 and BHL s.v. “u-mitzva”).",
                    "This mitzva is rooted in the very beginning of our emergence as a nation. The Sages explain that Israel had sunk to the depths of the forty-ninth level of impurity during their bondage in Egypt and were therefore unworthy of receiving the Torah. God waited seven weeks for them to purge themselves of the defilement of Egypt and enter a pure state, in which they could receive the Torah (based on <i>Zohar</i>, <i>Emor</i> 97). Counting the <i>omer </i>also expresses our anticipation for the giving of the Torah. A <i>midrash</i> relates that when Moshe announced to Israel that after leaving Egypt they would worship God at Mount Sinai and receive the Torah, they asked him, “When will this take place?” Moshe answered, “After fifty days.” Then, due to their great love for God, they counted every day, saying, “One day has passed,” “two days have passed,” and so on, every day. Because of their love and anticipation for the Torah, it seemed like a long time to them (<i>Shibolei Ha-leket</i> §236).",
                    "<i>Sefirat ha-omer</i> expresses our longing and anticipation of that great day when God gave us the Torah. By doing so, we undergo a process of purification with respect to all 49 levels of which man is constituted. The purer and cleaner one becomes, the more he will be able to absorb the Torah’s light. Thus, every year, we count the <i>omer</i> in preparation for receiving the Torah (see the end of section 3 below)."

                    "<b>The Laws of Counting the <i>Omer</i></b> / <b>The Process of Ascension from Nationalism to Spirituality</b>",
                    "By counting the <i>omer</i>, we draw a line that ascends continuously from Pesaḥ to Shavu’ot. The festival of Pesaḥ represents Israel’s national aspect: the Exodus revealed Israel’s uniqueness, in that God chose us from among all the other nations despite the fact that we were mired in 49 levels of impurity. The festival of Shavu’ot, however, represents Israel’s spiritual aspect, because that is when we reached the spiritual pinnacle of receiving the Torah. On Pesaḥ, we began the process of liberation from the yoke of Egypt, while on Shavu’ot we became completely liberated from the yoke of human perceptions and impulses by receiving the divine Torah, which makes all who engage in it truly free (<i>m. Avot</i> 6:2).",
                    "Let us present another dimension of this ascent. On Pesaḥ, the simple, natural faith that is hidden in the soul of every Jew, and which was preserved even during the years of Egyptian bondage, is revealed. On Shavu’ot, however, we rise to a more sophisticated form of faith, one that is clarified and expanded by the Torah. Natural faith is very powerful – indeed, it is the very foundation of life – but it cannot give direction to life or improve it. Through the Torah and the <i>mitzvot</i>, we are able to link all aspects of our lives – intellectual, emotional, and practical – to faith.",
                    "Thus, by counting the <i>omer</i> we gradually elevate ourselves in two ways: from nationalism to spirituality and from natural faith to a sophisticated faith based on Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>.",
                    "It is impossible to reach Shavu’ot without Pesaḥ. Only by recognizing Israel’s uniqueness can we rise to be worthy of the Torah. Only once we realize that Israel is the chosen nation, as the Exodus demonstrated, can we receive the Torah. As we say in the <i>berakha</i> over the Torah, “Blessed are You, Lord…Who chose us from among all the nations” and only then “gave us His Torah.” Similarly, it is impossible to grasp complex, developed, cognitive faith without first discovering simple, natural faith. Therefore, it is very important to connect the festival of Pesaḥ to the festival of Shavu’ot. Counting the <i>omer</i> is the link and the ladder that connects these two festivals.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is an allusion to this idea in the fact that we are commanded to count “from the day on which you bring the <i>omer</i> of elevation offering” (Vayikra 23:15). The <i>omer</i> offering is unique in that it is made from barley, an animal food, which represents the material, national aspect of Israel. Before we received the Torah and attained knowledge of God, we were like mindless animals. When we finish counting fifty days, we receive the Torah and reach a lofty spiritual state, then, “You shall bring an offering of new grain to the Lord” (<i>ibid</i>. 23:16). Similarly, matza is called the “bread of affliction,” and the <i>Zohar</i> teaches that it is bread of faith, that is, natural faith. The offering of new grain brought on Shavu’ot is made of leavened wheat; it is rich and developed, alluding to the complete revelation of divinity in every aspect of this world. On Pesaḥ, the revelation of natural faith occurs through limitation: the restriction against leavened bread. On Shavu’ot, however, it occurs through expansion (see <i>Orot Yisrael</i> 8:1). <i><br></i>Perhaps we can say that this is the basis of the dispute about whether <i>sefirat ha-omer</i> nowadays is mandated by Torah law or rabbinically (below, section 4). If the purpose of counting is to rise from simple faith to sophisticated faith through Torah study, then it is mandated by Torah law even today. But if the purpose is to elevate us from a revelation of faith by way of limitation and abstinence, which expresses itself in the prohibition of <i>ḥametz </i>on Pesaḥ (see <i>Peninei Halakha</i>: <i>Pesaḥ</i> 1:5-6), to a level of faith that reveals itself in all areas of life – in the physical world with all its pleasures – then it requires the existence of the Temple, which connects heaven and earth. Therefore, as long as we are unable to bring the <i>omer</i> offering, which represents material forces and from which we can rise to the point where we may bring the “new” offering of two loaves, it is impossible for us to express faith in every aspect of life. Therefore, <i>sefirat ha-omer </i>is of rabbinic provenance only.</i>"

Both the <i>berakha</i> and the count are optimally recited while standing, but if one recited them while seated, he has nonetheless fulfilled his obligation (SA 489:1).<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rishonim find an indirect support for this law in the verse, “From when the sickle is first put to the standing grain (<i>ba-kama</i>)” (Devarim 16:9). The Rishonim explain: Do not read the word as <i>ba-kama</i> but as <i>ba-koma</i>, meaning “while standing.” <i>Sefer Ha-eshkol</i> (<i>Hilkhot Pesaḥ</i> 159:1) states that we do not recite the <i>berakha </i>of <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> on <i>sefirat ha-omer</i> because we count in anticipation of Shavu’ot, and the <i>berakha </i>of <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> recited on Shavu’ot covers <i>sefirat ha-omer</i> as well. Maharil suggests that it is because <i>sefirat ha-omer</i> is only a preliminary mitzva that culminates in Shavu’ot. Radbaz 4:256, Maharsham 1:213, and <i>Rav Pe’alim</i> OḤ 3:32 offer these reasons as well. Maharil adds that we are concerned that one may forget to count one day and forfeit the entire count, rendering his initial recitation of <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> a <i>berakha </i>in vain. <i>Kol Bo</i> §145 explains that we omit the <i>berakha</i> because the mitzva is only rabbinic nowadays. Rashba writes (<i>Responsa</i> <i>Rashba </i>1:126) that one only recites <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> if the mitzva gives one pleasure. We take the <i>lulav</i> to express joy; we blow the <i>shofar</i> as a remembrance; but <i>sefirat ha-omer</i> is merely a preparatory act, which provides no pleasure. Furthermore, <i>sefirat ha-omer </i>today has taken on an additional role as a mournful commemoration of the Temple’s destruction. Rabbeinu Yeruḥam provides the same reason, quoting <i>Ha-ma’or</i>.</i>",
                    "There are two components to the count: the days and the weeks, as the Torah says:<br>And from the day on which you bring the <i>omer </i>of elevation offering – the day after the “Shabbat” – you shall count off <b>seven weeks</b>.

                    "Therefore, one must mention the tally of both days and weeks when counting the <i>omer</i> (<i>Menaḥot</i> 61a). For example, on the seventh day one says: “<i>Ha-yom shiva yamim, she-hem shavu’a eḥad</i>”<i> </i>(“Today is day seven, making one week”). On the fourteenth day, one says: “<i>Ha-yom arba’ah asar yom, she-hem shnei shavu’ot</i>” (“Today is day fourteen, making two weeks”). We mention the number of days and weeks even in the middle of a week.

According to <i>Ha-ma’or</i> and other Rishonim, one need count only the days and therefore say, “Today is day eight.” R. Ephraim maintains that one must count only the weeks and say, “Today is week one, day one.” According to Rif, Rambam, and Rosh, one tallies both days and weeks every day, and that is our practice, as SA 489:1 states.<br><i>Be-di’avad</i>, if one forgot to count the days on a day that completes a week, he has not fulfilled his obligation, and he must count again with a <i>berakha</i>.

In this count, each of the seven numbers is manifested through all seven of its facets. Thus, our purification to receive the Torah is complete.

The <i>mitzvot</i> of reciting the <i>Shema</i> and praying <i>Ma’ariv</i> apply all year round, making them more frequent than <i>sefirat ha-omer</i> (<i>Ḥok Ya’akov</i>; see BHL 489:1, s.v. “aḥar”).<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It seems that according to Rambam and Ran, it makes no difference when in the night one counts. However, the Sages say regarding all <i>mitzvot</i>, “The zealous perform <i>mitzvot</i> promptly.” According to <i>Tosafot</i> and Rosh, it is better to count at the beginning of the night, because then the count is more complete. SA 489:1 rules that one should count at the beginning of the night. MB 489:2 and <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 489:12 agree. Nevertheless, we pray <i>Ma’ariv</i> first, because the <i>mitzvot</i> of reciting the <i>Shema</i> and the <i>Amida</i> are more frequent (<i>Ḥok Ya’akov</i>). However, <i>Mor U-ketzi’a</i> maintains that one should count first, because the proper time for counting is the very beginning of the night, whereas <i>Shema</i> and the <i>Amida</i> can be delayed, <i>le-khatḥila</i>, for a half-hour. In practice, we count after <i>Ma’ariv</i> (BHL 489:1), because counting at the beginning of the night is not obligatory, merely a way of going above and beyond; as long as one counts at night, he fulfills the obligation of “<i>temimot</i>” (they must be complete). Therefore, we give precedence to <i>Shema</i> and the <i>Amida</i>, which are more frequent.<br>In order to avoid delaying the count, many <i>poskim</i> suggest that one count immediately after <i>Kaddish Titkabel</i> following the <i>Amida</i>, and before <i>Aleinu</i>, which is an additional prayer. This is found in MB 489:2 and <i>Nehar Mitzrayim</i>, and most follow this custom, including all Ashkenazim and those of North African descent.

                    "There is a dispute among the Rishonim whether one who forgets to count at night can rectify his error by counting during the day. The Torah teaches us that the time for <i>sefirat ha-omer</i> depends on the time of the <i>omer</i> harvest, as it says, “start to count seven weeks from when the sickle is first put to the standing grain” (Devarim 16:9-10). According to <i>Behag</i>, the <i>halakha</i> follows the opinion cited in <i>Menaḥot</i> 71a that if the harvester fails to reap the <i>omer</i> at night, he may, <i>be-di’avad</i>, reap the next day. Likewise, the same is true of <i>sefirat ha-omer</i>: if one forgets to count at night, he may, <i>be-di’avad</i>, count the next day. Rabbeinu Tam, however, maintains that the <i>halakha</i> follows the opinion stated in <i>Megilla</i> (20b, 21a) that the mitzva of harvesting the <i>omer</i> applies only at night. Therefore, one who forgets to count at night cannot fulfill his missed obligation by counting the next day. In practice, the accepted <i>halakha</i> is that one who forgets to count at night should count during the day without a <i>berakha</i>. On one hand, we give credence to the opinion that one may count during the day. However, we omit the <i>berakha</i> in order to avoid reciting a possible <i>berakha</i> <i>le-vatala</i> (SA 489:7). Each subsequent night, he may count with a <i>berakha</i> (<i>Terumat Ha-deshen</i>, MB 489:34)."

                    "The Rishonim debate the nature of the mitzva to count the <i>omer</i>. According to <i>Behag</i>, it is one long mitzva that extends from Pesaḥ to Shavu’ot, as it says, “Seven weeks; they must be complete” (Vayikra 23:15). Therefore, one who forgets to count one day forfeits the mitzva and may not continue counting thereafter. However, most <i>poskim</i> maintain that each night’s count is a separate mitzva. Hence, one who forgets to count one day forfeits only that day’s mitzva, and he must continue counting the next day, with a <i>berakha</i> (<i>Tosafot</i>, Rosh, Ritva, and others).",
                    "In practice, the <i>poskim</i> determined that even if one forgets to count an entire day, he must continue counting thereafter, in accordance with the majority opinion that each day’s mitzva stands alone. However, he must count without a <i>berakha</i>, in deference to the opinion that the entire count is one mitzva, and by missing a day he forfeits the whole mitzva. Thus, in order to avoid reciting a possible <i>berakha</i> <i>le-vatala</i>, he counts each subsequent day without a <i>berakha</i> (SA 489:8).",
                    "In order to avoid forfeiting the <i>berakha </i>entirely, one who misses a day must have in mind to fulfill his obligation by hearing the <i>ḥazan</i>’s <i>berakha</i>.<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to <i>Behag</i>, one who forgets to count one day forfeits the mitzva, because his count is not “complete.” R. Saadia Gaon maintains that only one who forgets to count the first day forfeits the mitzva, while one who skips any other day may continue counting with a <i>berakha</i>. <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Menaḥot</i> 66a) state that <i>Behag</i>’s opinion is puzzling, claiming instead that every day is a separate mitzva. This is also the opinion of Ri, Rosh, Ritva, and others. According to <i>Tur</i>, R. Hai Gaon also agrees. In addition, Ritz Gi’at writes in the name of R. Hai Gaon that one who misses a day should count the appropriate number the next day and then make up for the missed count by adding, “And yesterday was such-and-such.” In practice, we take <i>Behag</i>’s opinion into account, and thus one who forgets to count one day continues counting without a <i>berakha</i> (SA 489:8). However, some Aḥaronim ruled like the majority of Ge’onim and Rishonim that one who forgets can continue counting with a <i>berakha</i>. This opinion is found in <i>She’arim Metzuyanim Ba-halakha</i> 120:7. Still, as mentioned above, most Aḥaronim maintain that one should continue counting without a <i>berakha</i>.<br>One might ask: According to <i>Behag</i>, why do we recite a <i>berakha</i> every day? We are forced to answer that even <i>Behag </i>would admit that each day constitutes a separate mitzva. It is merely that skipping a day mars the “completeness” of what he counts, making it impossible to continue counting. Ḥida writes (<i>Avodat Ha-kodesh</i> 7:217) that if one knows in advance that he will miss a day – due to some uncontrollable circumstance – he should omit the <i>berakha</i> from the start, because, according to <i>Behag</i>, all of his <i>berakhot</i> will be in vain. Most <i>poskim</i>, however, rule that even in such a situation, one should count with a <i>berakha</i> until that day, because even <i>Behag</i> (with whom the vast majority of Rishonim disagree) maintains that the <i>berakhot</i> made prior to the omission were not recited in vain (<i>Kin’at Sofrim, Rav Pe’alim</i> OḤ 3:32). This cannot be compared to the seven-day count of a <i>zava</i> (a woman who is ritually impure due to bodily emissions) who, as <i>Tosafot</i> explain, does not recite a <i>berakha</i> because if she sees new blood then her count is nullified, thus invalidating the entire count. The difference is that even if one forgets to count one day, the count continues and Shavu’ot still arrives on the fiftieth day. Therefore, all the days that he counted without interruption were counted properly, and the <i>berakhot</i> that he recited were warranted. Only after missing a day, when the person himself will no longer be able to count successively, does <i>Behag</i> maintain that the <i>berakha</i> should be omitted because the count is no longer “complete.”<br>One who forgot to count a day and needs to serve as <i>ḥazan</i> (because he is observing a <i>yahrtzeit</i>, for example) should ask someone else to recite the <i>berakha</i> and count out loud, even though this will cause him discomfort, as everyone will realize that he missed a day. Others claim that in order to avoid embarrassment, one may rely on the majority of <i>poskim</i> who maintain that even one who forgets a day must count and may even recite the <i>berakha</i> on behalf of others.</i>",
                    "This <i>halakha</i> demonstrates the tension that accompanies <i>sefirat ha-omer</i>. After all, one who skips a day breaks, in some respects, the chain connecting Pesaḥ to Shavu’ot and forfeits the <i>berakha</i>. It is very important to connect Pesaḥ, which represents holy Jewish nationalism, with Shavu’ot, when we received the Torah, because Torah cannot exist without the Jewish people, and the Jewish people cannot exist without Torah."

Even though some maintain that one does not discharge one’s obligation by counting during the day, we follow those who maintain that, <i>be-di’avad</i>, one who counts during the day fulfills the mitzva.<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Terumat Ha-deshen</i> 1:37 states that even though we customarily follow <i>Behag</i>’s opinion, that is true only when one is certain that he forgot to count. In a case of uncertainty, however, we follow the viewpoint of the majority of <i>poskim</i>. The reasoning is that some authorities maintain that <i>sefirat ha-omer</i> is a Torah obligation. Therefore, when an uncertainty arises, one must be stringent; he must continue to count, and do so with a <i>berakha</i>.

However, even SA, who in 215:4 leans toward the opinion that reciting a <i>berakha</i> <i>le-vatala</i> is forbidden by Torah law, rules here in 489:8 in accordance with <i>Terumat Ha-deshen</i>’s opinion.)<br>According to most <i>poskim</i>, even if one remembers to count only during <i>bein ha-shmashot</i>, he may count the remaining nights with a <i>berakha</i>, even though it is doubly uncertain that he has fulfilled his obligation in such a case: First, some authorities maintain that counting during the day is invalid. Second, even if we maintain that one indeed discharges his obligation by counting during the day, it is uncertain whether <i>bein ha-shmashot</i> is part of the day or the beginning of the following night. Nevertheless, since it is not certain that one missed a day in such a case, he can rely on the majority of <i>poskim</i> who maintain that each day is a separate mitzva and continue counting with a <i>berakha</i>. Furthermore, according to Rabbeinu Tam, we define <i>bein ha-shmashot</i> unquestionably as daytime, and SA 261:2 rules this way as well. Though we do not follow this ruling in practice, we may invoke it in a case of uncertainty in order to rule leniently.

They provide several reasons for this. Since even a young boy must count the <i>omer </i>due to the mitzva of <i>ḥinukh</i> (educating one’s children in Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>), his previous counting is significant and can be viewed on the same continuum as his post-bar mitzva counting. Moreover, even after he becomes a bar mitzva, he will still be obligated to count, at the very least, to fulfill the mitzva of <i>ḥinukh</i>. Furthermore, since he has passed the age of twelve, he is considered <i>mufla samukh le-ish</i> (a youth close to adulthood), whose oaths are binding by Torah law. Since he regularly counted the <i>omer</i>, it is as if he took an oath to count, and he is thereby obligated to do so by Torah law. Regarding the “completeness” of the count, since he actually counted, it should certainly be considered complete, even though he wasn’t originally obligated to the same degree that he is now.

Akiva had 12,000 pairs of students…and they all died during the same period, because they did not treat each other with respect…. It is taught in a <i>beraita</i>, “They all died between Pesaḥ and [Shavu’ot]…and they all died a terrible death.” The world was desolate until R. Akiva came to our rabbis in the south and taught them [and these are the new students]: R. Meir, R. Yehuda, R. Yose, R. Shimon, and R. Elazar b. Shamu’a; it was they who revived the Torah. (<i>Yevamot </i>62b)<br>The Midrash (<i>Bereishit Rabba</i> 61:3) further recounts that R. Akiva said to his new students, “My sons, the first ones died only because they begrudged one another; make sure not to do as they did.”<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Gemara states that the terrible death they suffered was <i>askera </i>(diphtheria or croup), but R. Sherira Gaon writes in his <i>Igeret</i> that they died as a result of religious persecution. In this context, I have heard an interesting explanation: that they died during the Bar Kokhba rebellion. Some students went out to fight the Romans, while others continued studying Torah, and the members of the two groups denigrated one another, each saying: “I am greater than my colleague, for my contribution is important and beneficial, while my friend’s is useless.” Because of this baseless hatred between the fighters and the learners, they were defeated by their enemies, and they all died in a short period. Indeed, the date is not coincidental – they died between Pesaḥ, which represents Jewish nationalism, and Shavu’ot, which symbolizes the spiritual Torah. By showing disrespect for one another, these students created a rift between Pesaḥ and Shavu’ot, between nationalism and Torah, causing them all to die during this season. Some quote the passage from <i>Bereishit Rabba</i> as follows, “They begrudged one another’s <i>Torah</i>.” According to this, the primary rectification needs to be directed toward increasing respect between Torah scholars of different camps. (See below, end of n. 13, where we explain that these days have a festive side as well, serving as a <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i> of sorts – intermediate days between Pesaḥ and Shavu’ot.)</i>",

Since <i>pros</i> implies half a month, or fifteen days, it turns out that we must observe customs of mourning until the 34th day of the <i>omer</i>. There is a difficulty with this approach: According to the tradition mentioned above, the students stopped dying on the 33rd, but according to the calculation of <i>pros</i>, we mourn until the 34th. There are two opinions regarding this issue. Some maintain that we must observe the customs of mourning until the 34th day. This is the view of Ibn Shu’ib and <i>Tashbetz</i> 1:178, cited in <i>Beit Yosef</i> §493. SA 493:2 concurs. Perhaps these authorities explain that the students continued dying throughout the day of the 33rd; therefore, the mourning period ends only on the 34th. In contrast, <i>Ha-manhig</i> (<i>Hilkhot Erusin</i>, end of §106) implies that the period of mourning actually ends on Lag Ba-omer. Other Rishonim and Aḥaronim write similarly. According to them, we must explain that when the Sages use the word <i>pros</i>, they mean approximately half a month, because in reality we stop mourning <i>sixteen</i> days before Shavu’ot. So writes R. Yaakov b. R. Avraham Castro (Maharikash) in <i>Erekh Leḥem</i> (see also below n. 3).<br>4. The Rishonim cite a tradition in the name of <i>Tosafot</i> (not printed in our text of the Gemara) that R. Akiva’s students died on the 33 ordinary, non-festive days of the <i>omer</i> period. If we subtract from the 49 days of the <i>omer </i>six days of Pesaḥ, <i>isru ḥag </i>(the day after Pesaḥ), six <i>Shabbatot</i>, and three days of Rosh Ḥodesh, we are left with 33 days on which the students died. Consequently, we observe customs of mourning for 33 consecutive days. Some observe them at the beginning of the <i>omer</i>, while others do so at the end. <i>Beit Yosef</i> cites this tradition in the name of Ibn Shu’ib, and Rema 493:3 mentions it as well. <i>Baḥ</i>, MB 493:13, and BHL <i>ad loc</i>. clarify the details of this practice. Many Ashkenazim observe the customs of mourning during the latter part of the <i>omer</i>, because the Crusades – during which their ancestors experienced terrible massacres – began in the months of Iyar and Sivan. On the eighth of Iyar, the Jews of Speyer were massacred; the Jews of Worms on the 23rd of Iyar; the Jews of Mainz on the third of Sivan; and the Jews of Cologne on the sixth of Sivan. The earliest custom in this regard was to begin the mourning period on the second of Iyar and end it on Erev Shavu’ot. Nonetheless, one who follows this custom may start the mourning period at the beginning of the <i>omer</i> as well. Even though the laws of mourning do not find expression on <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed Pesaḥ</i> – as there is a mitzva to rejoice throughout the holiday – this does not take away from the 33 days, just as the days of Shabbat, on which mourning is precluded, count toward the 33 days of the <i>omer</i> and the seven days of regular mourning.<br><i>Minhagei Yisrael</i>, vol. 1, pp. 101-111, explains the Sephardic and Ashkenazic customs. In his addenda, vol. 4, pp. 237-241, he brings proofs that the word <i>pros</i> does not usually mean half, but “close to.” According to this, the version that reads “until <i>pros ha-Atzeret</i>” means until Erev Shavu’ot. It is important to note that there was another custom: to observe mourning throughout the <i>omer</i> period, except on Rosh Ḥodesh and Lag Ba-omer, when everything is permitted. We do not follow this practice (cited in MA 493:5 and MB 493:15).</i>"

                    "According to <i>Shulḥan Arukh</i> (493:1-2), the customs of mourning begin on the first day of the <i>omer</i> and last until the morning of the 34th. This is based on the tradition that, according to the Gemara, R. Akiva’s students died until <i>pros ha-Atzeret</i>, meaning fifteen days before Shavu’ot. This implies that we must continue mourning until the 34th day of the <i>omer</i>. However, as with the laws of mourning during <i>shiva</i> (the seven-day mourning period for a close relative), a small part of a day is considered like a whole day. Therefore, just as a mourner may terminate his <i>shiva </i>period after starting to mourn for only a short time at the beginning of the seventh day, since he has effectively completed that day, the same applies to the mourning of the <i>omer</i> period: One need not wait until the end of the 34th day. Rather, all customs of mourning cease to apply a few moments after daybreak on the morning of the 34th, because a small part of that day is considered like the whole day.",
                    "Despite this, one may sing, play music, and dance on Lag Ba-omer, in honor of the anniversary of R. Shimon bar Yoḥai’s death. However, the other customs of mourning remain binding. Thus, according to this practice, one may not get married or cut one’s hair on Lag Ba-omer, and when the day ends, one may not play music or dance on the night of the 34th. When the morning of the 34th comes, however, all practices of mourning cease to apply. (Those who follow Arizal’s customs act stringently and refrain from cutting their hair until Erev Shavu’ot; see <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 493:13.)",
                    "Some Sephardic communities – like those from Turkey and Egypt – end all customs of mourning on Lag Ba-omer. Even though most Sephardim in Israel today do not follow this practice, if there is a great need to be lenient on Lag Ba-omer or the night of the 34th, one should consult with a Torah scholar.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Sephardic custom is elucidated in SA 493:1-2, and we explained its foundations in the previous section (custom 3), based on the meaning of “<i>pros ha-Atzeret</i>,” which means the 34th day of the <i>omer</i>. However, some Sephardic <i>poskim</i> maintain that the customs of mourning end on Lag Ba-omer. Maharikash and R. Yaakov Rakaḥ write in this vein, and Maharikash explains in <i>Erekh Leḥem</i> that <i>pros</i> does not necessarily mean exactly half a month. <i>Sheyarei Knesset Ha-gedola</i> (<i>Hagahot Beit Yosef</i> 493:3) writes that in and around Constantinople, it was customary to get married on Lag Ba-omer. <i>Pri Ḥadash</i>, <i>Nehar Mitzrayim</i>, and others rule similarly. However, the prevalent custom follows SA’s opinion. This can be found in <i>Yeḥaveh Da’at</i> 3:31 and <i>Yabi’a Omer</i>, OḤ 3:26:4. Nonetheless, in pressing circumstances, and when there is potential for monetary loss, there is room to be lenient, provided that a Torah scholar rules that one may do so. R. Ovadia Yosef writes in this vein in <i>Yabi’a Omer</i> 5:38. This leniency applies especially to those who come from places like Turkey, where it is customary to be lenient on Lag Ba-omer. (On the night of the 34th, one may also factor in Ramban’s opinion, namely, that a small part of the night is considered like the entirety of the day; see below, n. 5.)<br>According to Radbaz and <i>Pri Ḥadash</i>, one who has yet to fulfill the mitzva of procreation need not avoid getting married during this period. Yemenite Jews followed such a custom (<i>Shetilei Zeitim</i> 493:4, Maharitz 2:111). In practice, though, we are not lenient regarding this issue, unless circumstances are pressing, and even then, only in accordance with the ruling of a Torah scholar. (Even Yemenite Jews are not lenient; see <i>Shulḥan Arukh Ha-mekutzar</i> 92:7.)</i>"

                    "The prevalent custom among Ashkenazim in Israel today amalgamates several traditions. Most customs of mourning last until Lag Ba-omer, while some continue afterward. This is based on the tradition that although the plague ended on Lag Ba-omer, students who fell ill before then died between the 34th day of the <i>omer</i> and Shavu’ot (Maharal, <i>Ḥidushei Aggadot</i>, <i>Yevamot</i> 62b). Therefore, Ashkenazim do not cut their hair, get married, play music, or dance until Lag Ba-omer. Afterward, however, they refrain only from weddings and large celebrations. Another reason for this custom is that during the Crusades and the Khmelnytsky Massacres of 1648-1649, tens of thousands of Ashkenazic Jews were killed. Since these murders occurred mainly during the latter part of the <i>omer</i> period, Ashkenazic communities refrain from large celebrations during this period. From Rosh Ḥodesh<i> </i>Sivan, however, it is customary to permit weddings, because the joy of Shavu’ot, which we already begin to experience from the beginning of the month, cancels the mourning. Some rule leniently and allow one to get married from Lag Ba-omer and on, and to avoid only optional large celebrations until Shavu’ot. (In the note below, we will mention another custom that was very widespread in Germany.)<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ashkenazic custom in Israel regarding weddings is explained in<i> Minhagei Eretz Yisrael</i> 18:2. <i>Siddur Pesaḥ Ke-hilkhato</i> 12:3 states likewise. This custom satisfies all the various traditions. First of all, 33 days of mourning are observed at the beginning of the <i>omer</i> period, which satisfies the tradition that Rema quotes from <i>Tosafot</i>. It also fits with the tradition that the plague ceased on Lag Ba-omer. In addition, we can explain that the textual variant that states that R. Akiva’s students died until <i>pros ha-Atzeret</i> means <i>approximately</i> half a month before Shavu’ot. Furthermore, following this practice means that there is no great difference between the Ashkenazic and Sephardic customs. Nonetheless, we still continue to avoid large celebrations even after Lag Ba-omer, in accordance with the tradition that R. Akiva’s students who fell ill before the 33rd died throughout the remainder of the <i>omer</i> period. Furthermore, <i>Taz</i> 493:2 states that we observe these customs because of the tragedies that occurred after Lag Ba-omer. Another explanation for this custom is that it fits with our version of the Gemara (<i>Yevamot</i> 62b), which states that the students died between Pesaḥ and Shavu’ot. And since refraining from getting married is the only expression of mourning mentioned in the writings of the Ge’onim, we do not get married during the entire <i>omer</i> period (except from Rosh Ḥodesh Sivan and on). The prohibitions against cutting one’s hair and listening to music were instituted later; therefore, it is customary to observe these prohibitions only until Lag Ba-omer. Another way to interpret the Ashkenazic custom is that one must observe any 33 days of mourning, not necessarily the first 33 days of the <i>omer </i>period. Accordingly, we count 33 days starting from the day after <i>isru ḥag</i> until the 29th of Iyar (not including Rosh Ḥodesh Iyar and Lag Ba-omer). Thus, everything is permissible from Rosh Ḥodesh Sivan and on. Some authorities permit weddings after Lag Ba-omer, if necessary, because they fulfill a mitzva, and prohibit only optional large celebrations until Shavu’ot.<br>In Germany, the Jews adopted the fourth custom from the above list, according to which the important part is to observe 33 days of mourning at the beginning or end of the <i>omer</i> period. Here, too, there are several options: 1) to observe 33 days of mourning from the beginning of the <i>omer</i> period (like the Ashkenazic custom in Israel); 2) from the thirtieth of Nisan, which is the first day of Rosh Ḥodesh Iyar, until the morning of the third of Sivan; 3) from the second of Iyar until Erev Shavu’ot (Rema 493:3, MB 493:15).<br>Rema 493:3 writes that two different customs should not be observed in the same place, because of the prohibition of <i>lo titgodedu </i>(“do not make factions”). However, if people from various communities gather together in one place, they may follow different customs. R. Moshe Feinstein concurs in <i>Igrot Moshe</i>, OḤ 1:159. According to the German practice (the fourth custom), if there is no established custom in a particular city, it is permissible to choose one of the customs, as long as they do not adopt only the leniencies of multiple customs. They may even observe the first 33 days one year and begin on Rosh Ḥodesh Iyar the next, because these are not really different customs; the main idea is to observe 33 consecutive days of mourning. <i>Ḥatam Sofer</i> OḤ 142 states that one may follow one practice regarding weddings and another regarding haircuts. Nowadays, there are barely any Ashkenazim in Israel who have the custom of holding weddings before Rosh Ḥodesh Iyar, so it seems preferable to discourage people from holding weddings then, because the Israeli practice is also based on the third custom mentioned above, and one should not follow two different practices in one place.</i>",
                    "On the day of Lag Ba-omer itself, it is permissible to get married and take a haircut. There is a dispute, however, regarding the night: some say that weddings and haircuts are permitted at night as well, because the entirety of Lag Ba-omer is joyous. Others maintain that one is required to observe 33 consecutive days of mourning, so it is permissible to get married and get a haircut only after morning has arrived and we can apply the rule: “Part of a day is considered like a whole day.” It is customary to act stringently <i>le-khatḥila</i>, but one may follow those who rule leniently if necessary. According to all customs, it is permissible to celebrate with music and dancing on the night of Lag Ba-omer.<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The plain meaning of Rema 493:2 implies that it becomes permissible to get married and get a haircuts only on the morning of Lag Ba-omer, not on the night of the 33rd. This is because we must observe 33 days of mourning, and SA YD 295:1 rules in accordance with the opinion of Maharam of Rothenburg (as opposed to Ramban) that a small part of the night is not considered like the whole of the day; this principle only applies to a small part of the daylight hours. Gra concurs, and MB <i>ad loc. </i>10 inclines toward this opinion as well. However, many authorities, including <i>Ma’adanei Yom Tov</i>, <i>Ḥok Yaakov</i>, <i>Mor U-ketzi’a</i>, and others, maintain that the entirety of Lag Ba-omer is permissible. Their reasoning is that Lag Ba-omer, both night and day, is a time of joy, when R. Akiva’s students stopped dying. The problem, however, is that we need to observe 33 days of mourning. According to those who do not celebrate weddings until Rosh Ḥodesh Sivan, there is no problem, because they observe more than 33 days of mourning. There is also no difficulty according to our version of Maharil’s work, which states that one must avoid cutting one’s hair for only 32 days, since he writes that we refrain from weddings for the entire <i>omer</i> period. SAH 493:5 writes that this <i>halakha</i> is connected to the question of whether <i>Taḥanun</i> is recited at <i>Minḥa</i> on the day before Lag Ba-omer. According to those who maintain that <i>Taḥanun</i> is omitted, the mourning period lasts 32 days, and it is customary to omit <i>Taḥanun</i> (see below ch. 5 n. 1). If we, nonetheless, insist on 33 days of mourning, and we do not include the days after Lag Ba-omer in this count, perhaps we can rely on Ramban’s opinion that a small part of the night is considered like the entire day. Then, we can celebrate weddings and cut our hair a few moments after the night of Lag Ba-omer begins (so states <i>Pri Ḥadash</i>).</i>"

Many authorities maintain that shaving is included in the prohibition of cutting one’s hair, so whenever haircuts are prohibited, shaving is prohibited as well. Most yeshiva students follow this practice, to the point that refraining from shaving has become the most prominent sign of mourning during the <i>omer</i> period.",
                    "Some <i>poskim</i>, however, maintain that there is a fundamental difference between haircuts and shaving: a haircut is special occasion that includes a joyous element. It is common that people get their hair cut in honor of holidays and celebratory events. In contrast, shaving is a routine practice nowadays, done daily or every few days in order to remove unsightly whiskers and stubble. Therefore, the custom to refrain from cutting one’s hair does not apply to shaving. According to this opinion, it is especially appropriate to shave on Fridays, to avoid greeting Shabbat in a disrespectful manner.",
                    "Those who want to rely on the lenient opinion may do so, and one should not rebuke them for this practice. However, it is proper for each person to follow the practice of his father or the instruction of his rabbi. Even though, technically, one may rely on the reasoning of those who rule leniently, we cannot ignore the fact that the custom to abstain from shaving during the <i>omer </i>period is a strong expression of one’s willingness to sacrifice for the sake of mitzva observance, so there is concern that abolishing this custom will harm one’s dedication to upholding traditional custom. Therefore, it is proper for each person to do as his father does, or as his rabbi instructs him to do, because, in this case, the issues of tradition and environmental influences are more important than the technicalities of whether the mourning customs apply to shaving.<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Many authorities rule stringently, forbidding all shaving during the <i>omer</i> mourning period. So writes <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim </i>551:66. In section 493:19, he quotes the Aḥaronim as saying that one may shave only if not doing so will cause a loss of income. <i>Igrot Moshe</i> OḤ 4:102 permits shaving in order to avoid financial loss as well; for example, if one’s employers demand that he shave. On the other hand, one can argue that daily shaving is not like cutting one’s hair. After all, the concept of shaving daily did not exist when the custom to refrain from cutting one’s hair as a sign of mourning first began. And just as, with regard to a mourner’s prohibition to bathe, we distinguish between bathing for pleasure or refreshment and bathing in order to remove filth, so too, one could distinguish between festive shaving and shaving in order to remove unsightly facial hair. The purpose of all the mourning customs of the <i>omer </i>period is to avoid celebrating, not to exhibit mourning, and allowing beard stubble to remain on one’s face is an exhibition of mourning. Granted, one should not be lenient on this issue during <i>shiva</i> and <i>shloshim</i>, but just as we allow shaving during the year-long mourning period after the death of a parent, so may we be lenient during the <i>omer</i> period and the Three Weeks, until Rosh Ḥodesh Av. R. Hershel Schachter cites this position in <i>Nefesh Ha-Rav</i> (p. 191) in the name of R. Yosef Dov Soloveitchik. This is especially true with regard to shaving before Shabbat. After all, MA 551:14 cites <i>Hagahot Asheri</i> as saying that Ashkenazim, who customarily refrain from haircuts for the entire Three Weeks period, should not get haircuts even before Shabbat, because people do not cut their hair every week. This implies that those who have the custom of shaving every week may shave in honor of Shabbat. See BHL 551:3, which states that the Yerushalmi also indicates that one may shave in honor of Shabbat. In addition to all this, it should be noted that, originally, the only custom of mourning during the <i>omer </i>period was to refrain from getting married, and according to the Ge’onim, Jews already began observing this custom soon after R. Akiva’s students died. In contrast, the custom to avoid haircuts is first mentioned in the writings of the Rishonim: <i>Orḥot Ḥayim</i>, <i>Shibolei Ha-leket</i>, and others. Perhaps they instituted it after additional tragedies befell the Jewish people (like the Crusades; see <i>Minhagei Yisrael</i>, vol. 1, pp. 105, 112-117). <i>Responsa</i> <i>Radbaz </i>2:687 writes that some people have a custom that they may cut their hair the entire month of Nisan, during which fasting and eulogizing is forbidden, while others maintain that one may get a haircut every Friday. He also permits getting a haircut on Rosh Ḥodesh Iyar, disputing the opinion of SA 493:3. His position implies that one may follow the more lenient opinions when it comes to this issue. The original Yemenite custom did not forbid haircuts during the <i>omer </i>period; this community began acting stringently only later on. R. David Mishreqi (the author of <i>Shetilei Zeitim</i>) and Maharitz (<i>Responsa Pe’ulat Tzadik</i> 2:76) rule that one should get a haircut on Erev Shabbat. Thus, when there is an uncertainty whether shaving has the same status as cutting one’s hair, one may certainly take into consideration those who rule leniently. See <i>Responsa Ner Ezra</i>, vol. 2, pp. 155-158, where the author concludes that one may shave before Shabbat, writing that this is the opinion of R. Shlomo Min-Hahar and R. Aharon Lichtenstein. R. Nachum Rabinovitch, <i>rosh yeshiva</i> of Yeshivat Birkat Moshe in Ma’ale Adumim, recommends that everyone act as his father does, to avoid a situation in which a father shaves and his son does not, or vice versa, thus derogating from the father’s honor.<br>Another reason to permit shaving on Fridays is that those who shave regularly usually feel great discomfort when they are unable to shave for several days. This may be similar to the dispensation allowing one to trim his mustache if it interferes with his eating, or to remove hairs that cause head sores or headaches. See <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 493:17, which allows one to cut his hair in honor of Shabbat, if his long hair causes him suffering. In addition, Ḥida mentions (in <i>Yosef Ometz</i> §40) the rationale that those who shave regularly suffer greatly when they do not shave, even more than one suffers due to long hair.<br>In my humble opinion, it would technically be proper to rule that those who shave throughout the year should shave in honor of Shabbat, and those who wish to be lenient may shave every day, because the customs of mourning do not apply to daily shaving. However, as I stated above, one should be careful not to undermine tradition in the case of a custom that is displayed so prominently. Therefore, everyone should follow his father’s custom or do as his rabbi instructs him. See a similar discussion below, 8:11, regarding shaving during the Three Weeks.</i>"

                    "Since it is customary not to celebrate too much during the <i>omer</i> period, the Aḥaronim write that one may not engage in optional dancing (dancing that is not for the sake of a mitzva; MA 493:1). They also forbid playing or listening to musical instruments.",
                    "According to Sephardic custom, the laws of mourning last until the morning of the 34th day of the <i>omer</i>. Nevertheless, in honor of the <i>hilula </i>(<i>yahrzeit</i>, anniversary of a death) of R. Shimon bar Yoḥai, music and dancing are permitted on Lag Ba-omer. Afterward, however, the prohibition resumes and continues through the night of the 34th, until the next morning, when all customs of mourning cease to apply.",
                    "According to Ashkenazic practice, the prohibitions last until the end of the 32nd day of the <i>omer</i>, meaning that music, dancing, and rejoicing are permitted from the beginning of the night of Lag Ba-omer, in honor of the <i>hilula </i>of R. Shimon bar Yoḥai. Most Ashkenazim refrain from large celebrations – like festive graduation ceremonies or dance nights – until Shavu’ot, but one may play and listen to musical instruments. One may conduct exercise classes with musical accompaniment even before Lag Ba-omer, but ideally the volume of the music should be lowered so that it is clear that the purpose of the music is to facilitate exercise, not to bring joy.<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ashkenazic Aḥaronim were uncertain whether one may make large celebrations after the 33 days of primary mourning are finished. They are even uncertain concerning the days between Rosh Ḥodesh Sivan and Shavu’ot, as SHT cites 493:4 in the name of <i>Eliya Rabba</i> and <i>Pri Megadim</i>. <i>Siddur Pesaḥ Ke-hilkhato</i> (ch. 12, n. 50) also cites this uncertainty. R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach and R. Shmuel Wosner rule stringently (<i>Piskei Teshuvot</i> ch. 493 n. 43). Even though the custom in Israel is to permit weddings after Rosh Ḥodesh Sivan, one should be stringent throughout the <i>omer</i> period with respect to optional dancing. The rationale for extending the customs of mourning beyond Lag Ba-omer is twofold: 1) the tradition that R. Akiva’s students died throughout the <i>omer</i> period, or at least on the weekdays therein; 2) the fact that so many tragedies befell the Ashkenazic communities during these days. The only difference is that we are more stringent in our observance of these customs before Lag Ba-omer than we are afterward. All this was already explained above, in sections 2 and 4 and in notes 2 and 4.<br>The distinction between a large celebration and a regular one is undefined. However, festive graduation ceremonies and dance nights are certainly considered large celebrations. On the other hand, exercise classes are permitted. If one is uncertain whether an event is considered a large celebration, one may be lenient if one combines it with a <i>siyum </i>or some other mitzva component. According to Sephardic custom, one may participate in any type of celebration after Lag Ba-omer. If many of the participants in an event are Sephardim, the group as a whole may be lenient, in accordance with their custom, but it is preferable to combine the event with a <i>siyum</i> or some other mitzva.</i>",
                    "It is customary to permit dancing and playing music on <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i> <i>Pesaḥ</i>, because it is a mitzva be joyful then (MB 529:16). Weddings, however, may not be held on <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i>, because we do not mix one celebration with another (SA 546:1). The Sages also forbid getting a haircut on <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i>, so that people do so prior to the festival (<i>ibid</i>. 531:2).",
                    "A Jew who makes a living playing music may perform at non-Jewish affairs if he needs the income. One may also teach or study music during the <i>omer </i>period, since these endeavors are not joyful (<i>Siddur Pesaḥ Ke-hilkhato</i> 12:16; see <i>Piskei Teshuvot</i> 493:4). However, a music student who, in any event, studies only intermittently throughout the year, should schedule a break, if possible, during the mourning period of the <i>omer</i>. If he intends to take only one break a year, it is preferable that it be during the Three Weeks (see below 8:2)."

One may, however, listen to non-instrumental music on an electronic device (<i>Igrot Moshe</i>, YD 2:137, <i>Yeḥaveh Da’at</i> 6:34).

                    "However, some maintain that the prohibition on music does not apply to listening to music on the radio or any other personal electronic device, as listening to music this way is not festive, whereas live music is. Furthermore, nowadays, listening to music on electronic devices is a regular, universal practice, and since it has become so routine, it is no longer considered a source of joy and festivity. Thus, listening to it is like listening to singing without musical accompaniment, which is permitted during the <i>omer</i> period. In addition, a distinction should be made between joyous songs and regular songs; only joyous songs should be forbidden to listen to during the <i>omer</i>, but regular tunes, and certainly sad tunes, should not be prohibited during the mourning period of the <i>omer</i>. Therefore, one who wishes to be lenient may rely on this opinion and listen to regular and sad songs on a personal electronic device. However, he should not play this music loudly, because the power of a sound that fills a room generates a festive atmosphere.<br>It seems that according to all views, a driver who is worried that he might fall asleep at the wheel may listen to music in order to keep himself alert.<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The following <i>poskim</i> prohibit listening to music on electronic devices: In <i>Igrot Moshe</i>, YD 2:137 and OḤ 1:166, R. Moshe Feinstein ruled stringently, stating that one may not listen to musical instruments throughout the year, as a sign of mourning for the Temple’s destruction – all the more so, during the <i>omer</i> period and the Three Weeks. And even though R. Ovadia Yosef permits listening to music throughout the year, he prohibits listening to instrumental music on the radio and the like during the <i>omer </i>period and the Three Weeks (<i>Yeḥaveh Da’at</i> 6:34). (In private conversation, however, he permitted Israeli radio station <i>Arutz Sheva </i>to play music, to ensure that they would be able to continue broadcasting Torah-oriented shows.) <i>Minḥat Yitzḥak</i> 1:111 concurs. R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach and R. Yosef Shalom Elyashiv prohibit listening to music on the radio as well (<i>Shalmei Mo’ed</i>, p. 453). <i>Tzitz Eliezer</i> 15:33 and <i>Shevet Ha-Levi</i> 8:127 forbid even non-instrumental music.<br>However, the reasons for leniency are compelling. First of all, musical instruments are not necessarily expressions of joy. See <i>Shabbat</i> 151a, which mentions that flutes were used in funeral elegies. Similarly, <i>Pri Megadim</i> permits playing music during the <i>omer</i> period in order to make a living; this ruling is quoted in BHL 551:2. Maharam Schick (YD 368) discusses the distinction between joyous tunes and sad tunes, stating that sad tunes are permitted during times of mourning. (However, he prohibits teaching music to certain children during their year of mourning, because they learn music only to show off, not to make a living.) In any case, we see that only joyous songs are forbidden. In MT, Laws of Fasts 5:14, where Rambam deals with the prohibition of playing music following the destruction of the Temple, his language implies this as well: “Similarly, they ordained that one should not play melodies with any sort of musical instrument. It is forbidden to celebrate with such instruments or to listen to them being played beacause of the destruction [of the Temple].” Based on this, it seems that the prohibition against listening to musical instruments relates mainly to happy songs, which are often accompanied by dancing, but regular songs – and certainly sad ones – are permitted. <i>Responsa Ḥelkat Yaakov</i> 1:62 brings up another point: listening to music via electronic devices is not included in the decree (or custom) of mourning, because these devices did not exist when the decree (or custom) was originally established. It may be that the reason many <i>poskim </i>disagreed with this ruling is that these devices were rare at the time, and listening to them was considered a festive activity. Nowadays, however, listening to music players is routine and uneventful; therefore, it is not included in the custom to refrain from listening to live music. My father and teacher, R. Zalman Baruch Melamed, agrees with this viewpoint. R. Shmuel David writes likewise in <i>Teḥumin</i>, vol. 13. See also below 8:4. Once again, since the entire prohibition is based on a custom, the <i>halakha</i> follows the more lenient opinion in cases of uncertainty. This is how <i>Arutz Sheva</i> conducted itself during the mourning period of the <i>omer</i>, broadcasting regular songs and avoiding songs that evoke celebration and dancing.<br>All agree that one may not attend a concert, even if the songs being performed are regular or sad songs, because the very act of gathering for a concert is festive and thus joyous. In my humble opinion, the same is true of listening to mild songs at a high volume: they become somewhat festive because of the force of the sound. According to all opinions, a driver may listen to music in order to keep himself awake, both because listening to music while driving is not so joyous and because of the possible danger to life. Even the <i>poskim</i> who rule stringently agree that one who suffers from depression may listen to music in private, as cited in <i>Hilkhot Ḥag Be-ḥag</i> ch. 7 n. 39.</i>"

According to this position, just as we refrain from reciting <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> during the Three Weeks – because it is inappropriate to recite, “Who has given us life…and brought us to this time,” during the period in which the Temple was destroyed – so too, it is inappropriate to recite <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> during a time in which holy Jews were murdered.",

See <i>Yabi’a Omer</i> OḤ 3:26 and <i>Yeḥaveh Da’at</i> 1:24, which summarize the various opinions.

                    "When the State of Israel was established, on the fifth of Iyar in 5708 (1948), the Jewish people fulfilled the mitzva of settling Eretz Yisrael (the land of Israel). It is true that even prior to the establishment of the state, any Jew who lived in Eretz Yisrael fulfilled this mitzva, and the Sages even said:<br>One should always dwell in Eretz Yisrael, even in a city inhabited mostly by idolaters, and he should not dwell outside the land, even in a city inhabited mostly by Jews, for anyone who dwells in Eretz Yisrael is like one who has a God, and anyone who dwells outside the land is like one who has no God. (<i>Ketubot</i> 110b)<br>However, the primary mitzva is for the Jewish people collectively to have sovereignty over Eretz Yisrael. The mitzva for every Jew to dwell in Eretz Yisrael is an offshoot of the collective mitzva that is incumbent upon the Jewish people.",
                    "This is the meaning of the verse, “You shall take possession of the Land and settle in it, for I have assigned the land to you to possess” (Bamidbar 33:53). “You shall take possession” denotes conquest and sovereignty, while “and settle in it” implies inhabiting the land to prevent it from being desolate. Similarly, the Torah states, “you shall possess it and settle in it” (Devarim 11:31). Accordingly, Ramban defines the mitzva as follows: “We were commanded to take possession of the land that God, may He be exalted, gave to our fathers, Avraham, Yitzḥak, and Yaakov; and we must not leave it in the hands of any other nation or let it remain desolate” (Addendum to Rambam’s <i>Sefer Ha-mitzvot</i>, Positive Commandment 4).",
                    "This mitzva is incumbent upon the Jewish people in every generation. For a long time, however, we lacked power and were thus forced to neglect this mitzva. We did not have a military or weapons with which to conquer and settle our land. In recent generations, God showed kindness to His people and a national spirit began to stir. Jews went forth and assembled in Eretz Yisrael. They planted trees, developed the country’s economy, organized a defense force, and resisted foreign rule, so that when the British Mandate ended, our public representatives were able to declare the establishment of the State of Israel. On that day, the Jewish people began fulfilling the mitzva of settling Eretz Yisrael. While it is true that we are not yet in control of the entire Eretz Yisrael, and we are still somewhat dependent on the nations of the world, we are actually fulfilling the mitzva of settling Eretz Yisrael once again.",
                    "We likewise find that the <i>halakhot </i>of mourning over Eretz Yisrael’s destruction depend on Jewish sovereignty over the land. The Sages enacted that one who sees the cities of Judea in ruins should recite, “Your holy cities have become a desert” (Yeshayahu 64:9) and tear his garments. The <i>poskim</i> explain that the definition of “in ruins” depends on who is in control. If non-Jews rule the land, its cities are considered ruined, even if most of the inhabitants are Jews, and one must rend his garment upon seeing them. But if Jews control the cities, they are not considered ruined, even if non-Jews form the majority of their inhabitants, and one does not rend his garments upon seeing them (<i>Beit Yosef</i> and <i>Baḥ</i> OḤ 561; MA <i>ad loc. </i>1 and MB <i>ad loc. </i>2).",
                    "In addition, the Sages lavish praise upon the mitzva of settling Eretz Yisrael, going so far as to say that it is equal to all the <i>mitzvot</i> of the Torah (<i>Sifrei</i>, Be-ha’alotekha §80).<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban outlines the foundations of the mitzva of settling Eretz Yisrael in his addendum to Rambam’s <i>Sefer Ha-mitzvot</i>, Positive Commandment 4, and my master and teacher, R.

Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> that one can compel his or her spouse to move to Eretz Yisrael (<i>Ketubot</i> 110b) applies at all times, as SA EH 75:3-5 determines. This is also the consensus of the Rishonim and Aḥaronim, as <i>Pitḥei Teshuva</i> <i>ad loc. </i>6 cites. While it is true that <i>Tosafot</i> in <i>Ketubot</i> 110b quote Rabbeinu Ḥayim’s opinion that the mitzva does not apply nowadays, the most prominent Rishonim and Aḥaronim do not even address this opinion; they believed that an errant student authored this statement (Maharit, YD 28; many of the greatest Aḥaronim agree; see also <i>Gilyon Maharsha</i>, <i>Ketubot</i> 110b; <i>Responsa Ḥatam Sofer</i>, YD 234). The fact that the main fulfillment of the mitzva revolves around Jewish sovereignty is elucidated in <i>Yeshu’ot Malko</i>, YD 66, <i>Avnei Nezer</i>, YD 455, and elsewhere.<br>Even though the Sages comment that several other <i>mitzvot</i> are equal to all the <i>mitzvot </i>(regarding <i>brit mila</i> in <i>Nedarim</i> 32a; <i>tzedaka</i> in <i>Bava Batra</i> 9a; <i>tzitzit</i> in <i>Shevu’ot</i> 29a; <i>tefilin</i> in <i>Menaḥot</i> 43b; Shabbat in <i>y. Nedarim</i> 3:9; Torah study and acts of kindness in <i>m.</i> <i>Pe’ah</i> 1:1), nonetheless, from a halakhic standpoint, settling Eretz Yisrael takes precedence over them all, as it is the only one that overrides a <i>shvut </i>(rabbinic prohibition on Shabbat). If one needs to violate a <i>shvut</i> in order to perform a <i>brit mila</i> on Shabbat, we postpone the <i>brit</i> instead of violating the <i>shvut</i>. For the sake of settling Eretz Yisrael, however, the Sages rule that one may purchase a home in Eretz Yisrael on Shabbat, if necessary, even if this entails violating the <i>shvut</i> of telling a non-Jew to do <i>melakha </i>(prohibited work) on Shabbat, as the Talmud states in <i>Gittin</i> 8b and BK 80b (and <i>Tosafot ad loc.</i>). This ruling does not only apply to the redemption of all of Eretz Yisrael; rather, even the purchase of just one house still overrides a <i>shvut</i>! Furthermore, in order to erect a protective fence around Shabbat, the Sages abrogate the Torah commandments of <i>shofar</i> and <i>lulav</i> when Rosh Ha-shana and the first day of Sukkot coincide with Shabbat. When it comes to settling Eretz Yisrael, however, the Sages suspend their own enactments by permitting one to violate a <i>shvut</i> – a serious rabbinic prohibition – for its sake. (In fact, <i>Smag</i> apparently considers telling a non-Jew to do <i>melakha </i>a Torah prohibition.)<br>Moreover, we are commanded to sacrifice our lives for the sake of the mitzva of settling Eretz Yisrael. We know this because the Torah commands us to take possession of the land—that is, to conquer it—and soldiers inevitably endanger their lives in war. See <i>Minḥat Ḥinukh</i> §425.<br>The reason Rambam does not include this mitzva in his count of the 613 <i>mitzvot </i>is that it transcends the normal value of <i>mitzvot</i>; it is not listed in the detailed enumeration because, as Rambam writes in his introduction to <i>Sefer Ha-mitzvot</i> and again with respect to Positive Commandment §153, <i>mitzvot </i>that encompass the entire Torah are not listed individually. Besides which, it is implausible to say that the mitzva of settling Eretz Yisrael is only rabbinically mandated today, since the Sages stated, following the destruction of the Second Temple, that settling the land is equal to all the <i>mitzvot</i> of the Torah; it is highly unlikely that they would say such a thing about a rabbinic mitzva. Moreover, it is improbable that the Sages would dismantle a family or allow one to violate a <i>shvut</i> merely for the sake of a rabbinic mitzva (see R. Yaakov Zisberg’s <i>Naḥalat Yaakov</i>, vol. 1, pp. 201-249).</i>"

                    "The establishment of the State of Israel removed the disgrace of exile from the Jewish people. Generation after generation, we wandered in exile, suffering dreadful humiliation, pillaging, and bloodshed. We were an object of scorn and derision among the nations; we were regarded as sheep led to the slaughter, to be killed, destroyed, beaten, and humiliated. Strangers said to us, “You have no hope or expectation.” That situation was a terrible <i>ḥilul Hashem</i> (desecration of God’s name), because God’s name is associated with us, and when we are degraded, His name becomes desecrated among the nations (see Yeḥezkel 36).",
                    "The prophets of Israel prophesied, in God’s name, that the exile will eventually end: “I will take you from among the nations and gather you from all the countries, and I will bring you back to your own land” (Yeḥezkel 36:24); “They shall build houses and dwell in them; they shall plant vineyards and enjoy their fruit” (Yeshayahu 65:21); “Again you shall plant vineyards on the hills of Samaria; Men shall plant and live to enjoy them” (Yirmiyahu 31:4); “And the desolate land, after lying waste in the sight of every passerby, shall again be tilled. And men shall say, ‘That land, once desolate, has become like the Garden of Eden; and the cities, once ruined, desolate, and ravaged, are now populated and fortified” (Yeḥezkel 36:34-35); “I will restore My people Israel. They shall rebuild ruined cities and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and drink their wine; they shall till gardens and eat their fruits. And I will plant them upon their soil, nevermore to be uprooted from the soil I have given them – said the Lord your God” (Amos 9:14-15).",
                    "However, after so many years passed without God’s word coming to fruition, God’s name became increasingly desecrated in the world, and the enemies of Israel decided that there is no chance that the Jews would ever return to their land. Even the Sages spoke in hyperbole about the miracle of the ingathering of the exiles, to the point that they said, “The ingathering of the exiles is as great as the day upon which the heaven and earth were created” (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 88a). But a miracle occurred, and God fulfilled His promise, causing an enormous and awesome <i>kiddush Hashem</i> (sanctification of God’s name). This <i>kiddush Hashem </i>became amplified even further during the Six-Day War, when Jerusalem was reunified and the holy cities within Judea and Samaria were recaptured.",
                    "This process – the ingathering of the exiles and the blooming of the wasteland – which gained tremendous momentum when the State was established, marks the beginning of the redemption. As R. Abba said, “There is no clearer sign of the end of the exile than this verse: ‘But you, O mountains of Israel, shall yield your produce and bear your fruit for My people Israel, for their return is near’ (Yeḥezkel 36:8) (<i>San</i>. 98a).” Rashi comments, “When Eretz Yisrael yields its fruit in abundance, the End will be near, and there is no clearer sign of the end of the exile.”",
                    "Nevertheless, many things still need to be fixed. Unfortunately, we have not yet fully repented, and many Jews have yet to immigrate to Eretz Yisrael. Despite this, the Sages taught that redemption can come in one of two ways. They interpreted the verse, “I the Lord will speed it in due time” (Yeshayahu 60:22) to means that if we achieve complete repentance, God “will speed it”; i.e., He will hasten the redemption. But if we do not repent fully, the redemption will still come “in due time,” through natural processes (<i>San</i>. 98a). That is, even if Israel fails to repent, when the predetermined time for redemption arrives, certain natural processes will begin to unfold. These processes will be full of complications and severe hardships, causing the Jewish people to return to their land and rebuild it. We will proceed from stage to stage in this manner, until the ultimate redemption materializes. These hardships, which stimulate the redemptive process, are called the birth-pangs of the Messiah. The more we strengthen ourselves in the <i>mitzvot </i>of settling Eretz Yisrael and penitence, the sweeter and more pleasant these birth-pangs will become (based on Vilna Gaon in <i>Kol Ha-tor</i>). Concerning this type of redemption, the Sages say, “Such is the redemption of Israel: at first little by little, but as it progresses it grows greater and greater” (<i>y.</i> <i>Berakhot</i> 1:1).",
                    "Explicit verses in the Torah and the Prophets indicate that the order of redemption is as follows. First, there will be a small degree of repentance and the Jewish people will gather in their land, which will begin to yield its fruit. Afterward, God will bestow upon us a spirit from on high, until we return to Him completely.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">My teacher and master, R. Zvi Yehuda Kook, explains in detail (in “<i>Ha-medina Ke-hitkayemut Ḥazon Ha-ge’ula</i>,” <i>Li-netivot Yisrael</i>, vol. 1, pp. 261-272) that the order of redemption is as follows: first there will be a small degree of repentance, with a return to Eretz Yisrael and a national revival. Then, a complete return to God will ensue. We will mention here a few of the many sources that confirm this idea. In the section dealing with repentance in Devarim 30, the Torah states that there will first be a return “to (<i>ad</i>) the Lord,” which refers to a minor repentance stemming from fear and harsh decrees. Afterward, the exiles will gather in Eretz Yisrael, and then a complete return “to (<i>el</i>) God” will take place. R. Zvi Yehuda explains, based on the teachings of his father, R. Avraham Yitzḥak Kook, that the minor repentance will manifest itself in a return to Eretz Yisrael. (This return began with a holy awakening of love, when the Ḥasidim and the students of the Vilna Gaon immigrated to Eretz Yisrael in the 1800s.) Yeḥezkel 36 also describes the redemption in this order, as does the Talmud (<i>San.</i> 97b). There, R. Yehoshua opines that redemption does not depend on repentance; rather, God will empower a king as cruel as Haman, and this will cause the Jews to repent, albeit only partially. R. Eliezer, who argues with R. Yehoshua on this matter, remains silent at the end of the debate, implying that he concedes the dispute. Other sources that indicate that redemption is independent of repentance include: <i>Shemot Rabba</i> 25; <i>Tikunei Zohar Ḥadash</i>; Ramban’s commentary on Devarim 32; <i>Or Ha-ḥayim </i>to Vayikra 25:28; R. Shlomo Eliasov’s <i>Hakdamot U-she’arim</i> 6:9, especially pp. 273-276, where R. Eliasov quotes some of the greatest Aḥaronim who viewed the modern-day ingathering of exiles as the beginning of the redemption. My teacher and master, Rav Zvi Yehuda Kook adds (<i>op. cit.</i>,<i> </i>vol. 2, p. 365) that one who fails to recognize these divine acts of kindness lacks faith, and though this lack of faith sometimes wraps itself in the garb of piety and religiosity, it is actually a denial of the divine nature of the Written Torah, the words of our Prophets, and the Oral Torah. <i>Sanhedrin</i> 98b quotes several Amora’im who were so afraid of the terrible suffering that would occur during the era of the birth-pangs of the Messiah that they said, “Let him (the Messiah) come, but let me not see him.” See other sources in <i>Em Ha-banim Semeiḥa</i> by R. Y. S. Teichtal, <i>Ha-tekufa Ha-gedola</i> by R. M. M. Kasher, and <i>Kol Ha-tor</i> – reprinted at the end of R. Kasher’s book – which contains profound ideas that the Vilna Gaon revealed to his students on the topic of redemption. See also <i>Ayelet Ha-shaḥar</i> by R. Y. Filber, the section entitled “<i>Shivat Tziyon Ha-shelishit</i>.”</i>"

                    "On Yom Ha-atzma’ut (Israel’s Independence Day), the Jewish people were delivered from bondage to freedom, from subjugation by foreign powers, with all it entails, to political independence. This also brought about an actual physical salvation from death: until then, we were unable to defend ourselves from the attacks of our enemies, but from that day on, thanks to God’s kindness, we have defended ourselves and triumphed over our enemies. Although the enemies who have risen up to destroy us have not yet been destroyed, ever since the establishment of the state we have had an army, thank God, so we have the power to fight back and triumph. And even though more than 20,000 holy souls have given their lives in wars and terror attacks since the establishment of the state, just a few years earlier, during the horrific Holocaust, more than six million holy Jews were killed in the span of five years – more than 300 times that amount. This is the difference between having the ability to fight back and not having that ability.",
                    "That day brought about a salvation for Diaspora Jews, as well. They now have a country that is always willing to take them in and that even acts on their behalf in the international arena. Before the state was established, almost no one paid attention when the Jews would complain about the murderous, anti-Semitic persecution that raged in many countries. After Israel gained independence, however, even the most evil regimes were forced to take into consideration Israel’s actions on behalf of the Jews living in their midst. Even Communist Russia had to relent and allow the Jews to leave from behind the Iron Curtain, something that was unfathomable before the state was established.",
                    "The establishment of the state also brought spiritual salvation to the Jews. The Jewish nation underwent a profound spiritual crisis in the modern era. The opportunity to integrate into the civil and national frameworks of developed nations, which Jews now enjoyed, generated a strong desire to assimilate. This is not the place to elaborate on the reasons for this crisis; R. Kook deals with the issue at length, discussing its various facets. Practically speaking, a dangerous process of assimilation and the abandonment of religion developed in all countries that embraced modernity. This process threatened the very existence of the Jewish communities in the Diaspora. Assimilation began approximately 200 years ago in Western Europe, spreading gradually to Eastern Europe and the capital cities of the more developed Arab countries. Today, most youths in the greater Jewish community in the United States marry outside the faith, and even those who marry Jews generally do not have many children. Under these circumstances, Diaspora Jewry is fading away. Only in Israel is the Jewish population growing, and intermarriage there is relatively rare. Moreover, the percentage of Jews connected to Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> in Israel is higher than that of any other Jewish community in the world. This spiritual salvation came about in the merit of the establishment of the state, which enabled the ingathering of the exiles and diminished the temptation of assimilation.",
                    "Thus, Yom Ha-atzma’ut is invested with three sanctities: the sanctity of the mitzva of settling Eretz Yisrael; the sanctity of the beginning of the redemption, which created a <i>kiddush Hashem</i> in the eyes of the nations; and the sanctity of the salvation that the establishment of the state brought for the Jewish people."

                    "The verse states: “I adjure you, O maidens of Jerusalem, by gazelles or by hinds of the field: Do not wake or rouse love until it please!” (Shir Ha-shirim 2:7). The Sages explain that God administered three oaths: two to Israel – not to ascend to their land forcefully all together (lit. “on a wall”) and not to rebel against the nations – and one to the gentiles – not to subjugate the Jews excessively (<i>Ketubot</i> 111a). Afterward, the Gemara adds three other oaths that God administered to the Jews: “That they will not reveal the End of Days, that they will not delay the End, and that they will not reveal the secret to the idolaters.” Furthermore, “R. Elazar says: The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, ‘If you fulfill the oath, well and good; but if not, I will allow your flesh [to be devoured] like [that of] the gazelles and the hinds of the field.’”",
                    "R. Yitzḥak de Leon, author of <i>Megilat Esther</i>, understands the oaths to mean that “we may not rebel against the nations and conquer Eretz Yisrael by force,” and this is what the Sages meant when they stated that we may not ascend “on a wall.” Based on this, he concludes that there is no mitzva to settle Eretz Yisrael until the Messiah arrives (gloss on Ramban’s addendum to <i>Sefer Ha-mitzvot</i>, Positive Commandment 4).",
                    "However, the rest of the great Rishonim and Aḥaronim maintain that the mitzva of settling Eretz Yisrael is fixed and eternal, as Ramban states and as <i>Shulḥan Arukh</i> (EH 75:3-5), and <i>Pitḥei Teshuva</i> (EH 75:6) assert. Thus, one should not infer from this aggadic statement that the mitzva of settling Eretz Yisrael no longer applies.",
                    "Many interpretations have been given for the three oaths. Several of them imply that we must not precipitate the End of Days by ascending to the land by force, without first considering the matter realistically. Indeed, there is reason to fear that, because of the hardships of exile and the protracted period of longing for redemption, people will ascend to Eretz Yisrael impetuously, without any practical means by which to build the land and defend themselves against the nations of the world. This will lead to destruction and crisis instead of the beginning of the redemption. Therefore, God made us swear that we will not attempt to return before carefully calculating our actions. Rather, we should ascend and build the land gradually, in coordination with the nations of the world, or by way of manifest miracles, if we deserve the “I will speed it” form of redemption.",
                    "Indeed, the modern return to Zion occurred gradually. The Jewish community in Eretz Yisrael established itself through small steps, while the Zionist Organization simultaneously engaged in diplomatic efforts, until the world recognized the Jewish people’s right to return to their land and build a national home there. Accordingly, after the League of Nations agreed, at the San Remo conference, to return Eretz Yisrael to the Jewish people, R. Meir Simḥa of Dvinsk wrote that “the fear of the oaths has departed.”<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The full quote is cited in <i>Ha-tekufa Ha-gedola</i>, p. 175. We will mention a few of the sources. Rashi explains the Gemara’s statement “They shall not go up as a wall” to mean, “Together, with a strong hand.” <i>Avnei Nezer</i>, YD 453, states that if the Jews ascend to Eretz Yisrael with the permission of the nations, it is not considered “with a strong hand.” R. Yisakhar Shlomo Teichtal concurs in <i>Em Ha-banim Semeiḥa</i>, pp. 226-228 (English edition), adding that when the Jews in exile encounter great suffering, it is a heavenly sign that they must ascend to Eretz Yisrael (see the index there). R. Zvi Yehuda Kook explains this principle briefly in <i>Li-netivot Yisrael</i>, vol. 2, pp. 274-275. The entire comprehensive work of R. M. M. Kasher, <i>Ha-tekufa Ha-gedola</i>, is filled with sources for the mitzva of settling Eretz Yisrael and the beginning of the redemption, as well as explanations of the three oaths; see pp. 175-176, 273ff.<br>Even if one wants to explain the oaths differently, the rule is that we do not derive <i>halakha</i> from aggadic statements (<i>Avnei Nezer</i>, YD 454). Hence, Rif, Rosh, and all the other early halakhic commentators on <i>Ketubot</i> do not mention the three oaths. On the contrary, they write that there is a mitzva to ascend to Eretz Yisrael. Likewise, Rambam and SA do not mention the oaths in their works. <i>Pnei Yehoshua</i> (on <i>Ketubot</i> 111a) points out that <i>Yoma</i> 9b implies the opposite – that the redemption did not come because the Jews did not ascend as a wall. And since these two aggadic sources contradict each other, we must understand them in some other, non-halakhic way. According to <i>Sefer Hafla’ah</i> (<i>Ketubot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>), the “wall” only relates to the immigration to Eretz Yisrael from Babylonia. The Vilna Gaon writes in his commentary to Shir Ha-shirim that the oaths relate to the construction of the Temple, warning us not to be overly eager and build it without divine authorization, given through a prophet. According to R. Tzadok Ha-Kohen of Lublin (<i>Divrei Sofrim</i> §14), even <i>Megilat Esther</i> would agree that there is a mitzva to settle Eretz Yisrael nowadays. For a comprehensive treatment of this issue, see <i>Naḥalat Yaakov</i> by R. Yaakov Zisberg, vol. 2, pp. 715-815</i>"

                    "There is a mitzva to establish a holiday of rejoicing and praising God on a day when the Jewish people were saved. It was on this basis that the Sages established Purim and Ḥanuka as permanent holidays. Even though one may not add <i>mitzvot</i> to the Torah, this mitzva is derived from a <i>kal va-ḥomer </i>(<i>a fortiori</i> argument): When we left Egypt and were delivered from slavery, God commanded us to celebrate Pesaḥ and sing praise to Him every year; all the more so must we celebrate Purim, when we were saved from death (<i>Megilla</i> 14a). This principle served as the Sages’ basis for establishing Ḥanuka as well (Ritva <i>ad loc</i>.). Ḥatam Sofer explains (end of YD 233, OḤ 208) that since this mitzva is derived from a <i>kal va-ḥomer</i>, it is considered a Torah commandment. However, the Torah does not prescribe exactly how to establish a holiday; therefore, one who does anything to commemorate the salvation fulfills his Torah obligation. It was the Sages who determined that we read the <i>megilla</i>, conduct a festive meal, send <i>mishlo’aḥ manot </i>(gifts of food) to others, and give charity to the poor on Purim, and light candles on Ḥanuka.",
                    "Many Jewish communities throughout the ages kept this mitzva, instituting days of joy in commemoration of miracles that they experienced. Many of them included the word “Purim” when naming these days, like “Purim Frankfurt” and “Purim Tiberias.” Some communities had a custom to eat festive meals, send <i>mishlo’aḥ manot </i>to one another, and give charity to the poor on these days. Maharam Alashkar writes that the enactments that these communities made have binding force, obligating all of their descendants to keep them, even if they move to a new community (<i>Responsa Maharam Alashkar </i>§49). Other Aḥaronim concur (MA and <i>Eliya Rabba</i> 686:5).<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Pri Ḥadash</i> (OḤ 496, <i>Kuntres Ha-minhagim</i> 14) disagrees with Maharam Alashkar, stating that we may not establish new holidays after the destruction of the Temple, when the Sages canceled the holidays enumerated in <i>Megilat Ta’anit</i>. However, Ḥatam Sofer, OḤ 191, demonstrated that we should create new holidays; the fact that the Sages canceled the holidays mentioned in <i>Megilat Ta’anit</i> is no proof, since they canceled only the holidays that were connected to the Temple. Ḥatam Sofer adds that he himself celebrates “Purim Frankfurt” (or “Purim Winz”) on the twentieth of Adar, because he was born in Frankfurt, even though he had since moved elsewhere. It is also well known that Rambam established holidays for himself and his offspring in commemoration of salvations that he experienced – for example, surviving a storm at sea. A similar account is found in <i>Ḥayei Adam</i> 155:41. <i>Yaskil Avdi</i> OḤ 7:44:12 cites many examples of the institution of “Purim” days in various communities and consequently rules (vol. 8, omissions 4) that we may establish Yom Ha-atzma’ut as a holiday. Two more important sources on this issue from the Rishonim are: Ibn Ezra, Bamidbar 10:10; Rabbeinu Tam, cited in <i>Tosafot Ri</i> (<i>Berakhot</i> 8a in the Rif pages).</i>",
                    "The great sage R. Meshulam Rath writes: “There is no doubt that we are commanded to rejoice, establish a holiday, and recite <i>Hallel</i> on the fifth of Iyar, the day that the government, the members of the Knesset [who were chosen by the majority of the people], and most of the greatest rabbis established as the day on which to celebrate, throughout the land, the miracle of our salvation and freedom” (<i>Responsa Kol Mevaser</i> 1:21).<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his <i>Responsa Kol Mevasser</i> 1:21:2-3, R. Meshulam Rath (who R. Zvi Yehuda Kook said was the generation’s greatest sage after the passing of R. Avraham Yitzḥak Kook) explains – based on Ramban, Ritva, and other Rishonim and Aḥaronim – that the foundation of the mitzva to establish Yom Ha-atzma’ut as a holiday is the <i>kal va-ḥomer</i> mentioned above. Therefore, establishing it was not a violation of <i>bal tosif </i>(adding to the laws of the Torah), since the prohibition against inventing a holiday refers only to holidays that do not commemorate a salvation. Based on this <i>kal va-ḥomer</i>, however, we are obligated to institute holidays that commemorate salvations. R. Roth adds that a prophet may not establish a new holiday based on prophecy. In the case of Purim was it necessary to produce a special scriptural exposition (<i>Megilla</i> 7a), only in order to canonize the book of Esther as part of Scripture.<br>It is worth noting R. Meshulam Rath’s reliable statement that Yom Ha-atzma’ut was instituted by the majority of the greatest rabbis. (Although they disputed whether one should recite <i>Hallel</i> with a <i>berakha</i>, most of the greatest rabbis agreed on the basic obligation to give thanks and rejoice.) And when Ḥatam Sofer, OḤ 191, s.v. “mihu,” writes that one might violate the prohibition of <i>bal tosif</i> by establishing a holiday for all of Israel, he merely means that one may not establish a national holiday to commemorate a miracle that happened to one Jewish community. However, when the entire Jewish people experienced a miracle, we are obligated to establish a holiday for all of Israel. See also R. Nahum Rackover’s <i>Hilkhot Yom Ha-atzma’ut Ve-Yom Yerushalayim</i>, which includes articles on the mitzva to establish a holiday on Yom Ha-atzma’ut written by the chief rabbis of Israel and other great Torah scholars.<br>Some have asked why Yehoshua neglected to establish a holiday to celebrate the conquest of Eretz Yisrael. The answer is that the festival of Pesaḥ commemorates both the redemption from Egypt and Israel’s subsequent entry into Eretz Yisrael. This corresponds to the fifth expression of redemption. Alternatively, R. Tzadok Ha-Kohen of Lublin (<i>Pri Tzadik </i>on Tu Be-Av) posits that the holiday of Tu Be-Av (the fifteenth of Av) was established to commemorate this event.

Accordingly, it says in the book of Ezra, “They responded with praise (<i>hallel</i>)<i> </i>and thanks to the Lord: ‘For He is good….’” (<i>Megilat Ta’anit</i>, ch. 9)",
                    "Similarly, the Talmud states that after the miracle of the splitting of the Red Sea:<br>The prophets among them instituted that the Jews should recite <i>Hallel</i> at every episode and for every trouble that does not befall them, and when they are redeemed they should recite it over their redemption. (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 117a)<br>Rashi explains that the Sages of the Second Temple era relied on this principle to institute the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> on Ḥanuka.",
                    "It follows that we must recite <i>Hallel</i> over the miracle that God performed for us on Yom Ha-atzma’ut. On that day we were saved from the worst hardship of all, that of exile and subjugation to foreigners, which caused all of the terrible suffering and massacres that we experienced for nearly 2,000 years.<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>y. Pesaḥim</i> 10:6, we read that <i>Hallel</i> should be recited on such occasions: “When the Holy One, blessed be He, performs miracles for you, you should sing songs of praise” – meaning, you should recite <i>Hallel</i>. <i>Shemot Rabba</i> 23:12, commenting on the Song of the Sea, concurs: “‘They said (lit. “they said, saying”)’ (Shemot 15:1) – We will say to our children, and our children to their children, that when You perform miracles for them, they should sing a song like this one before You.” The Talmud (<i>Megilla</i> 14a) asks why we do not recite <i>Hallel</i> on Purim and offers three answers: 1) From the moment the Jews first entered Eretz Yisrael, we do not recite <i>Hallel</i> on miracles that occur outside Eretz Yisrael; 2) R. Naḥman maintains that we read <i>Megilat Esther</i> in place of <i>Hallel</i>; 3) Rava states that we do not recite <i>Hallel</i> on Purim because we remained subjugated to Aḥashverosh. The miracle of Yom Ha-atzma’ut occurred in Eretz Yisrael and freed us from our subjugation to other nations. Therefore, according to all opinions, we must recite <i>Hallel</i>.<br>The <i>poskim</i> dispute whether the obligation to recite <i>Hallel</i> on days the Jews were saved from distress is mandated by Torah law or rabbinically. <i>Behag</i> and other Rishonim maintain that it is a Torah obligation. (Until King David’s time, no specific formula for praising God had yet been instituted; everyone would compose his own, private thanksgiving prayer. After David composed the book of Tehilim, however, the prophets ordained that we recite specific chapters of Tehilim in order to fulfill the mitzva of praising and thanking God.) According to Rambam, the whole concept of reciting <i>Hallel</i> – whether on the festivals recorded in the Torah or in commemoration of the salvations that God performed for the Jews – is a rabbinic mitzva. Netziv posits (<i>She’iltot</i> 26:1) that reciting <i>Hallel</i> at the time a miracle occurs, as the people of Israel did when they sang the Song of the Sea, is a Torah commandment, while reciting it every year thereafter is a rabbinic mitzva. Ḥatam Sofer, OḤ 208, s.v. “u-mikol makom,” implies that the Torah commandment exists every year (also see end of YD 233).</i>",
                    "We must be very careful not to deny God’s benevolence, as the Sages say, “Whoever acknowledges a miracle done on his behalf will be privileged to have another miracle done for him.” Conversely, if we neglect to thank God, we will delay the redemption, God forbid. The Talmud relates that King Ḥizkiyahu was a very righteous man who spread Torah extensively throughout Israel, but difficult times eventually beset him. King Sennacherib of Assyria besieged Jerusalem with a mighty army, intending to destroy it, and Ḥizkiyahu fell deathly ill. Nevertheless, he did not lose faith; instead, he cried out to God, who performed a great miracle on his behalf, curing his illness and destroying Sennacherib’s entire army in one night. At that moment, God wanted to declare Ḥizkiyahu the Messiah, consider the war against Sennacherib the apocalyptic war of Gog and Magog, and bring redemption to the world. But Ḥizkiyahu did not sing songs of praise, i.e., <i>Hallel</i>, over his redemption. The heavenly attribute of justice said to God, “Master of the Universe, if You did not make King David of Israel, the Messiah, even though he uttered so many songs and praises before You, will You make Ḥizkiyahu the Messiah, seeing that he failed to sing songs of praise after You performed all of these miracles for him?” Therefore, the matter was sealed, and great sorrow spread throughout all the worlds. The earth wanted to sing songs of praise in Ḥizkiyahu’s stead, and the “minister of the world” wanted to defend him, but their pleas were rejected; the opportunity was lost. The prophet said, “Woe to me! Woe to me! Until when?” (<i>San</i>. 94a).",
                    "The same is true of us. For many generations we prayed, “Raise high the banner to gather our exiles” and “Swiftly, lead us upright to our land.” Now that our prayers have been answered, shall we not thank God? Similarly, it says, “Save us, Lord our God, and gather us from among the nations, that we may give thanks to Your holy name and glory in Your praise” (Tehilim 106:47). Now that He has gathered us, shall we not thank His holy name and sing His praise?"

                    "Some say that even though we thank God on Yom Ha-atzma’ut, we should not recite <i>Hallel</i> with a <i>berakha</i>. They mention five main reasons: 1) Based on several Rishonim, Ḥida maintains that <i>Hallel</i> is recited with a <i>berakha</i> only when all of Israel experiences a miracle, and when Israel declared its independence only a minority of world Jewry was living in Eretz Yisrael; 2) We should give thanks only for a complete salvation, and our enemies still threaten us on all sides; 3) The spiritual state of the country’s leaders and many of its citizens 4) It is proper to show deference to the opinion that maintains that <i>Hallel</i> should be said only when a revealed miracle occurs, like the miracle of the oil on Ḥanuka, not on a natural miracle like the establishment of the state; 5) It is uncertain whether the day of thanksgiving should be set for the day Israel declared independence (the fifth of Iyar), the day the War of Independence ended, or the day the United Nations decided to establish a Jewish State (the sixteenth of Kislev, or November 29).",
                    "Because of all or some of these concerns, the Chief Rabbinate Council originally prescribed that one recite <i>Hallel</i> without a <i>berakha</i> during <i>Shaḥarit</i> on Yom Ha-atzma’ut. Over the course of the next 26 years, however, Israel’s situation improved dramatically. We were privileged to liberate Judea and Samaria in the Six-Day War, and we even came out of the Yom Kippur War with a great victory, despite the adverse turn of events at the start of the war. More than three million Jews already resided in the land, five times the number that lived there at the State’s inception in 1948. Therefore, on the 25th of Nisan, 5734 (1974), the Chief Rabbinate Council assembled once again – at the initiative of the Ashkenazic Chief Rabbi, R. Shlomo Goren – to discuss the issue of <i>Hallel</i> on Yom Ha-atzma’ut. They decided, by majority vote, that a strong case can be made in favor of reciting the full <i>Hallel</i> with a <i>berakha</i> on Yom Ha-atzma’ut morning. On this basis, it was the practice of my teacher and master, R. Zvi Yehuda Kook, to recite <i>Hallel</i> with a <i>berakha</i> at Yeshivat Mercaz HaRav, and all of his students follow this practice as well.",
                    "In response to the claim that <i>Hallel</i> may be recited only on a miracle that affects all of Israel, the council explained that the establishment of the state constituted a salvation for all of Israel (as explained above, section 3). In addition, the residents of Eretz Yisrael are considered the entirety of Israel. The day when independence was declared was specifically chosen as the day of thanksgiving because it was the foundation for the deliverance and salvation that took place.<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to R. Meshulam Rath, it would have been appropriate to institute the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> with a <i>berakha</i> on Yom Ha-atzma’ut immediately after the State was established. He writes: “The leaders who chose this day in particular were correct, for that was when the main miracle occurred, when we went from bondage to freedom by declaring independence. Had we postponed this declaration for a different day, we would have missed the opportunity and we would not have attained the recognition and consent of the world’s major powers, as is well known. This miracle also brought in its wake the second miracle: being saved from death, both in terms of our war against the Arabs in Eretz Yisrael and the salvation of the Diaspora Jews who immigrated to the land. This led to the third miracle: the ingathering of the exiles” (<i>Kol Mevaser </i>1:21). My teacher and master, R. Zvi Yehuda Kook, explains further (<i>Li-netivot Yisrael</i>, vol. 1, pp. 248-249) that the courage displayed in declaring the state was miraculous in its own right; see BM 106a and <i>Tosafot ad loc.</i><br>However, R. Ovadia Hadaya (<i>Yaskil Avdi</i> OḤ 6:10) – although agreeing fully that the establishment of the State was the beginning of the redemption – cites Ḥida in <i>Ḥayim Sha’al</i> 2:11 as saying that <i>Hallel</i> should be recited only over a miracle that happened to all of Israel, adding that the salvation of 1948 was not complete. Furthermore, he asserts that no miracle happened on Yom Ha-atzma’ut itself; on the contrary, the war intensified. R. Hedaya was also uncertain of the appropriate date on which to establish the holiday: perhaps the day of the cease-fire is most appropriate, or the sixteenth of Kislev (November 29), when the United Nations confirmed the Jewish people’s right to a state. To avoid disrupting the order of our prayers, which contains deep meaning and significance, R. Hedaya concludes that one should recite <i>Hallel</i> without a <i>berakha</i> after the conclusion of <i>Shaḥarit</i>. R. Ovadia Yosef (<i>Yabi’a Omer</i> OḤ 6:41) agrees that we should omit the <i>berakha</i>, because the miracle did not happen to all of Israel<i> </i>and because we still have a long way to go before reaching a state of peace and security, from both a political-military and spiritual standpoint. R. Yosef Messas (<i>Otzar Ha-mikhtavim</i> 3:1769) maintains that one should recite the full <i>Hallel</i> (with a <i>berakha</i>). R. Shalom Messas felt that one should recite the <i>berakha</i>, but when he heard R. Ovadia Yosef’s opinion he ruled that one who already has a custom to recite the <i>berakha</i> should continue to do so, while one who does not have such a custom should refrain from reciting the <i>berakha</i> (<i>Shemesh U-magen</i> 3:63, 66). My teacher and master, R. Shaul Yisraeli, maintains that one should recite the <i>Hallel</i> without a <i>berakha</i>. Former Chief Rabbis R. Avraham Shapiro and R. Mordechai Eliyahu, concur, but R. Shapiro agrees that one who wants to recite the <i>berakha</i>, in accordance with his custom, may do so (cited in <i>Ha-Rabbanut Ha-Rashit</i>, vol. 2, pp. 901-903).<br>Those who maintain that one should recite <i>Hallel</i> with a <i>berakha</i> explain that the miracle actually did happen to all of Israel, as R. Rath writes (above). According to them, even Ḥida would agree that one should recite the <i>berakha</i>. Furthermore, the residents of Eretz Yisrael are considered the entirety of Israel. This is how R. Shlomo Goren and R. Yehuda Gershuni explain the matter (their position is cited in <i>Hilkhot Yom Ha-atzma’ut Ve-Yom Yerushalayim</i>). <i>Yabi’a Omer</i> <i>loc. cit</i>. 3 states that the Jews of Eretz Yisrael are considered the entirety of Israel only for specific issues. R. Uri Sherki rebuts this claim in his <i>Siddur Beit Melukha</i> (<i>Ba Orekh</i>, sec. 2). Regarding the claim that we should not recite the <i>berakha </i>because the salvation was incomplete, we can learn from Ḥanuka that this is irrelevant. After all, the Jews at the time observed the holiday after their first victory, even though they needed to fight many more difficult battles over the next few decades (see below 11:3). They would establish a holiday after every subsequent victory (see below 11:1). Moreover, when the wars finally ended, Hellenism had already spread throughout the Hasmonean Empire (see below 11:4). It is implausible to say that the Sages instituted Ḥanuka only in commemoration of the miracle of the oil, as the first day of Ḥanuka is observed in celebration of the military victory. Furthermore, the <i>kal va-ḥomer</i> that is cited to support the very foundation of our observance of Yom Ha-atzma’ut relates to the salvation, not the miracle. The fact that many holy soldiers have been killed does not preclude the recitation of <i>Hallel</i>; after all, more fighters were killed in the Hasmonean wars, and they nevertheless established a holiday. In addition, we have at least as much geo-political independence as the Hasmoneans did. R. Goren substantiates his position that it is a mitzva to recite <i>Hallel</i> with a <i>berakha</i> in his work <i>Torat Ha-mo’adim</i>, as does R. Natan Zvi Friedman in <i>Responsa Netzer Mata’ai</i> §36. This is also the opinion of R. Ḥayim David Halevi in <i>Dat U-medina</i>, p. 82.<br>Quoting testimony by R. Yehuda Ushpizai, R. Shmuel Katz writes in his work <i>Ha-Rabbanut Ha-Rashit</i> (vol. 2, p. 841, n. 33) that Chief Rabbis Yitzḥak Herzog and Ben-Zion Uziel believed that it was appropriate to recite <i>Hallel</i> with a <i>berakha</i> from the moment the state was established, but since they were told that Ḥazon Ish and other rabbis strongly opposed this, they refrained from issuing such a ruling, so as not to increase strife. R. Katz cites R. Shlomo Yosef Zevin as saying that this is cause for eternal weeping: that due to external intervention by rabbis who were not members of the Chief Rabbinate Council, the chief rabbis did not rule immediately when the state was established in favor of reciting <i>Hallel</i> with a <i>berakha</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i> p. 890 n. 6). Similarly, R. She’ar Yashuv Cohen relates that his father, R. David Cohen (known as “the Nazir”), maintained that one should recite <i>Hallel</i> with a <i>berakha</i>, but since his opinion was not accepted, he did not recite the <i>berakha</i>, explaining: “I am missing the <i>ve-tzivanu</i> (‘and commanded us’) of the Chief Rabbinate.”<br>It is worth citing here part of a sermon that my teacher and master, R. Zvi Yehuda Kook, delivered on Israel’s nineteenth Yom Ha-atzma’ut, when the Chief Rabbinate had not yet instructed the public to recite a <i>berakha</i> on <i>Hallel</i>:<br>An important man approached me and asked why our rabbis do not permit us to recite <i>Hallel</i> with a <i>berakha</i> on Yom Ha-atzma’ut. I answered that the Rabbinate’s decision is balanced and correct. The Chief Rabbinate’s edicts are made for the entire population, and – unfortunately and disgracefully – many of our people do not acknowledge God’s great deeds as revealed in the reestablishment of Jewish sovereignty in Eretz Yisrael. And since they lack this belief, they lack the joy that goes along with it and we cannot obligate them to recite a <i>berakha</i>. This can be compared to the <i>berakha</i> a person recites upon seeing a long-lost friend: If he is happy to see his friend, he recites the <i>berakha</i>, but if he feels no joy, he does not recite it. R. [Yehuda Leib] Maimon, who was totally dedicated to the rebuilding of God’s nation and territorial inheritance, was filled with the joy of faith when the state was born. He therefore instituted the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> with a <i>berakha</i> in his synagogue. The same is true of other, similar places, like the army and the religious kibbutzim. However, the all-inclusive Chief Rabbinate cannot issue a comprehensive ruling for the entire population, instructing them to recite a <i>berakha</i>, when many people are not ready for this. In our central yeshiva (Yeshivat Mercaz HaRav), we follow the Rabbinate’s ruling, because we are not some <i>kloyz</i> (private house of study) of a specific group. We belong to the concept of the entirety of Israel, which is centered in Jerusalem, and since – painfully and shamefully – there are currently obstacles preventing the public as a whole from attaining full faith and joy…it is appropriate that we, too, act in accordance with the Rabbinate’s ruling for the general public. (<i>Li-netivot Yisrael</i>, vol. 2, pp. 359-360)<br>After the Six-Day War, R. Zvi Yehuda bemoaned the fact that the Rabbinate did not immediately institute the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> with a <i>berakha</i> on Yom Ha-atzma’ut. When R. Goren did so after Israel was victorious in the Yom Kippur War, R. Zvi Yehuda was elated, and this became the custom of Yeshivat Mercaz HaRav. Even though various events have occurred since then – ups and downs – and the Chief Rabbinate does not have the same status as it once had, nonetheless, the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> with a <i>berakha</i> was already established, and this is the practice of R. Zvi Yehuda’s students.</i>"

Meshulam Rath, since Yom Ha-atzma’ut is a holiday on which Israel was saved, it is appropriate to recite the <i>berakha </i>of <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> on the day, as we do on all our holidays, including Purim and Ḥanuka. He believes, however, that the obligation to recite <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> depends on one’s level of joy.

The reason we recite <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> on Ḥanuka and Purim, on which work is not prohibited, is that we perform special <i>mitzvot</i> on these days: we read the <i>megilla</i> on Purim and light candles on Ḥanuka.

He also relies on the opinion of <i>Baḥ</i> and others, who maintain that the principle that we rule leniently in a case of uncertainty regarding <i>berakhot</i> (i.e., one omits the <i>berakha</i>) does not apply to <i>She-heḥeyanu</i>.

On the other hand, <i>Yaskil Avdi</i> 6:10 writes that one should not recite <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> on Yom Ha-atzma’ut, for the reasons stated above.

However, many authorities maintain that the practice<i> </i>of reciting <i>Hallel</i> on the night of Pesaḥ is a unique law, and we cannot invoke this law to support following this practice on other holidays. The proof for this is that we recite <i>Hallel</i> on the other holidays during the day alone. Therefore, one should not recite <i>Hallel</i> on the night of Yom Ha-atzma’ut. This is the practice of most of R. Zvi Yehuda Kook’s students.<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Goren’s position is found in <i>Torat Ha-Shabbat Ve-hamo’ed</i>. See R. Shmuel Katz’s article “<i>Ha-Rabbanut Ha-Rashit Ve-Yom Ha-atzma’ut</i>” (sec. 4, nn. 7, 8, 17, 18).

Yaakov Ariel, who opposes it. R. Moshe Zvi Neriya expressed this view before R. Ariel did (see <i>Kovetz Hilkhot Yom Ha-atzma’ut Ve-Yom Yerushalayim</i>), quoting several reasons why <i>Hallel</i> is recited specifically on Pesaḥ night, none of which are relevant to Yom Ha-atzma’ut. R. Ariel Edri concurs in a booklet called <i>Shaḥar Ahaleleka</i>. According to R. Hai Gaon, it seems that we recite <i>Hallel</i> on the first night of Pesaḥ because one must view himself as if he is actually leaving Egypt that night. Consequently, he must sing praise as the miracle occurs, an element that does not apply to any other holiday. Most rabbis accept this viewpoint, especially since prior to R. Goren’s tenure as Chief Rabbi, everyone agreed that <i>Hallel</i> pertains to the day alone. And when R. Goren publicized his ruling that <i>Hallel</i> should be recited at night, it stirred a dispute, and it is unclear whether the Chief Rabbinate Council agreed with his ruling. In practice, R. Zvi Yehuda Kook instructed his students at Yeshivat Mercaz HaRav to recite <i>Hallel</i> at night, in accordance with R. Goren’s ruling. However, it seems that he personally disagreed.

                    "The fifth of Iyar can fall out on a Monday, Wednesday, Friday, or Shabbat. When it falls out on a Friday or Shabbat, there is good reason for concern that the celebrations and ceremonies will cause public desecration of Shabbat. Therefore, it was decided – at the request of the Chief Rabbinate – that whenever the fifth of Iyar falls out on a Friday or Shabbat, Yom Ha-atzma’ut is celebrated on the preceding Thursday (the third or fourth of Iyar). Eventually, it became apparent that even when Yom Ha-atzma’ut falls out on a Monday, this still causes Shabbat desecration. Since Yom Ha-zikaron (Memorial Day), which takes place the day before Yom Ha-atzma’ut, begins on Saturday night in this case, this causes many Jews to desecrate Shabbat in preparing for Yom Ha-zikaron. Therefore, it was decided – again at the request of the Chief Rabbinate – that both of these holidays would be postponed by a day, such that Yom Ha-zikaron would be observed on the fifth of Iyar and Yom Ha-atzma’ut on the sixth of Iyar. In practice, then, on three of the four days on which Yom Ha-atzma’ut can potentially fall, we celebrate it either before or after its genuine date.",
                    "We find a similar concept in the laws of other holidays. Out of concern that one might carry a <i>shofar</i> or <i>lulav</i> through <i>reshut ha-rabim </i>(the public domain) on Shabbat, the Sages canceled these <i>mitzvot</i> on Shabbat. Therefore, when Rosh Ha-shana falls out on Shabbat, we do not blow the <i>shofar</i> that day, and when the first day of Sukkot falls out on Shabbat, we do not take the <i>lulav </i>that day. Thus, the Sages canceled Torah commandments in order to avoid Shabbat desecration. Despite this, we may not change the actual date of a holiday since it is written explicitly in the Torah. The date of a rabbinically ordained holiday, however, may be moved. For example, when Purim falls out on Shabbat, we read the <i>megilla</i> and give gifts to the poor on Friday, read the special Torah reading and recite <i>Al Ha-nisim</i> on Shabbat, and eat a festive meal and send <i>mishlo’aḥ manot</i> to others on Sunday (SA<i> </i>688:6, MB <i>ad loc. </i>18; below 17:5).

                    "The same is true of Yom Ha-atzma’ut; it all depends on how the holiday was instituted. Whichever day the representatives of the people and the Chief Rabbinate decide is the day to celebrate the establishment of the State is the day when we must thank God for His salvation.<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This has been the Chief Rabbinate’s position throughout its history. It is true that, in 1981, R. Shlomo Goren believed that one should recite <i>Hallel</i> on the fifth of Iyar when it falls out on<i> </i>Shabbat, reasoning that whatever festive practices do not entail Shabbat desecration should be observed in their proper time, as is the case on Purim (<i>Torat Ha-Shabbat Ve-hamo’ed</i>). Nevertheless, all the other rabbis maintained that no distinction should be made, as R. Yaakov Ariel explains in <i>Be-ohalah shel Torah</i> §73. R. Ariel states that it seems we should omit <i>Taḥanun</i> on the fifth of Iyar (if it falls on a Friday), just as Tisha Be-Av retains its status with regard to certain laws even when it falls out on Shabbat (<i>ibid.</i>). He concludes that if the fifth of Iyar falls out on Shabbat, we still recite <i>Av Ha-raḥamim</i>, because of the misfortunes that occurred in Iyar. It seems to me that we should, nevertheless, omit <i>Tzidkatekha</i> from the <i>Minḥa</i> service. It also seems – and so decided the Chief Rabbinate in 2004 – that when the fifth of Iyar falls on a Monday, meaning that Yom Ha-atzma’ut is pushed off to Tuesday, we do not recite <i>Taḥanun</i> on Monday. In his work <i>Ha-Rabbanut Ha-Rashit</i> (pp. 898-899), R. Shmuel Katz explains that even R. Goren originally maintained that <i>Hallel</i> should be recited on the day that was chosen for the general celebrations, as opposed to Shabbat. He changed his mind only later, in 1981. In n. 33, R. Katz relates, in the name of R. Yitzḥak Alfasi, that in 2001 the members of R. Goren’s synagogue, Komemiyut Avraham, followed the prevalent custom not to recite <i>Hallel</i> on Shabbat, because some heard from R. Goren that the general public did not accept his ruling on this matter.<br>Rav Kook writes in <i>Mitzvat Re’iyah</i>, OḤ 688:1 that the Sages instituted two days of Purim in order to distinguish between a Torah commandment, which has one fixed time for everyone, and a rabbinic commandment, which is observed at different times in different locations. Perhaps this explains why the Sages instituted two levels of <i>mehadrin</i> observance with regard to lighting Ḥanuka candles, a feature that is not found in relation to Torah commandments, whose laws are fixed. Based on this, we can state that it is fitting for Yom Ha-atzma’ut not to have a fixed date, seeing that it is a rabbinic enactment.</i>",
                    "It is interesting to note that the actual declaration of Israel’s independence took place earlier than originally planned, in order to prevent Shabbat desecration. The British Mandate ended on Friday night at midnight, but the heads of the People’s Council did not want to declare statehood through Shabbat desecration, so they moved the declaration up to Friday afternoon, the fifth of Iyar."

The war began on three fronts, and in the span of just six days, Israel utterly shattered its enemies’ military strength and dealt them a total defeat. At the same time, all the holy places in Judea and Samaria – most significantly the Old City of Jerusalem and the Temple Mount – were liberated, along with the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan. Anyone who viewed these events honestly and had even the slightest spark of faith in his heart saw clearly the words of our holy Torah, “Since the Lord your God moves about in your camp to protect you and to deliver your enemies to you” (Devarim 23:15). This great victory was truly a manifest miracle.",
                    "In order to thank God and publicize the miracle, the Chief Rabbinate – headed by R. Isser Yehuda Unterman and R. Yitzḥak Nissim – ordained the 28th of Iyar, the day on which the Old City and the Temple Mount were liberated, as a day of thanksgiving and joy for all of Israel, on which <i>Hallel</i> is recited, with a <i>berakha</i>, after <i>Shaḥarit</i>. R. Shlomo Yosef Zevin and R. Shaul Yisraeli also participated in and supported this decision.<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See R. Shmuel Katz’s article on the topic in <i>Ha-Rabbanut Ha-Rashit</i>, vol. 2, especially pp. 974-5. For the exact wording of the Chief Rabbinate’s decision, see <i>Hilkhot Yom Ha-atzma’ut Ve-Yom Yerushalayim</i>, p. 387. A responsum from R. Unterman is cited on p. 125, which discusses the great importance of the mitzva to publicize a miracle. This mitzva is possibly even more important than that of reciting the <i>Shema</i>; we even interrupt Torah study on Purim to participate in reading the <i>megilla</i>, in order to publicize the miracle. There, R. Unterman also expands upon the mitzva of establishing a holiday on a day when the Jews were delivered from distress. R. Meir Kaplan writes likewise (<i>loc</i>. <i>cit. </i>p. 204). R. Seraya Deblitzky also writes of the need to establish a day of thanksgiving for the Six-Day War (<i>loc. cit. </i>p. 61). According to R. Ovadia Yosef, however, one should not recite a <i>berakha</i> on the <i>Hallel</i> that one recites on Yom Yerushalayim, as he maintains, based on Ḥida’s opinion, that we cannot institute the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> with a <i>berakha</i> unless a miracle happens to all of Israel, and R. Ovadia does not view the Jews of Jerusalem as the entirety of Israel. The Chief Rabbinate decided that even when the 28th of Iyar falls out on a Friday, the date when <i>Hallel</i> is recited should not change.</i>"

Responses to this question have varied greatly. The accepted practice is not to observe customs of mourning that subvert the joy of Yom Ha-atzma’ut, and therefore, one may dance and play music. However, one should not schedule a wedding on that day, because avoiding weddings is not considered an expression of mourning that clashes with the joy of Yom Ha-atzma’ut.",
                    "Those who shave regularly should shave in advance of Yom Ha-atzma’ut, just as one would put on special clothing before the holiday begins. Regarding haircuts, it seems that only one who looks disgraceful because of his long hair may cut his hair prior to Yom Ha-atzma’ut. One who looks decent, however, may cut his hair only on Yom Ha-atzma’ut itself, because then the joy of the day overrides this custom of mourning.<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sephardic Chief Rabbi R. Yitzḥak Nissim writes (<i>Hilkhot Yom Ha-atzma’ut Ve-Yom Yerushalayim</i>, pp. 334-340) that all customs of mourning are canceled on Yom Ha-atzma’ut. He bases his ruling on the <i>poskim</i> who maintain that one who has not yet fulfilled the mitzva of procreation may get married during the <i>omer </i>period (Radbaz, <i>Pri Ḥadash</i>). Similarly, some people cut their hair during the <i>omer </i>period in honor of Shabbat and Rosh Ḥodesh (Radbaz, R. Yaakov Emden). Furthermore, R. Ḥayim Palachi writes (<i>Mo’ed Le-khol Ḥai</i> §6) that since a miracle happened to some of the people of his city on the eighth of Iyar, and to others on the eleventh, it is their custom to cut their hair on these days. In addition to R. Nissim’s proofs, there is even more room for leniency when it comes to shaving, because shaving is not festive in nature; it simply eliminates one’s mournful appearance, as we explained above (3:7). <i>Responsa Yaskil Avdi</i> 6:10, on the other hand, does not permit haircuts or weddings on Yom Ha-atzma’ut. My teacher and master, R. Zvi Yehuda Kook, used to rebuke students who usually shave but look like mourners on Yom Ha-atzma’ut, saying, “Their countenance accuses them” (Yeshayahu 3:9) – that they are not happy and that they do not truly thank God for the miracle. See R. Shmuel Katz’s essay in <i>Ha-Rabbanut Ha-Rashit</i>, vol. 2, pp. 877-882.<br><b>Regarding mourners</b>: According to a responsum written by R. Goren (<i>op. cit. </i>p. 900, n. 37), Yom Ha-atzma’ut and Yom Yerushalayim, like Ḥanuka, do not cancel <i>shiva</i>. Therefore, a mourner does not recite <i>Hallel</i>, nor do others recite <i>Hallel</i> in a house of mourning; they must recite it elsewhere. If the mourner has completed <i>shiva</i>, he should join the festive prayers and celebrations, as long as there is no live music. A mourner may not cut his hair during <i>shloshim</i> in honor of these holidays.</i>",

Indeed, they should even be permitted to schedule weddings then. This is because, first of all, many communities terminate all the restrictions after Lag Ba-omer (see above 3:2-4), and moreover, now that the 28th of Iyar has been instituted as a day of thanksgiving and joy over the miracle that God performed for the nation of Israel, one should certainly refrain from mourning.",

Those who go beyond this hold a full memorial service with Torah lectures to elevate the deceased’s soul.",
                    "We have fought many wars throughout our long history, often losing more soldiers in one war than the IDF has lost in all of its battles combined. Nevertheless, the Sages never instituted a memorial day for those killed in battle. When we were victorious, we celebrated, and when we lost, we mourned individually. The only tragedy for which the Sages instituted public mourning, in the form of fast days, is the destruction of the Temple, which was a spiritual and national destruction. Indeed, the destruction of the Temple is the source of all the troubles, evil decrees, and bloodshed that our nation has suffered throughout the long exile. Even the Fast of Gedalia was instituted in commemoration of the Temple’s destruction, not because Gedalia’s righteousness warranted that all of Israel mourn his death each year. Rather, his assassination extinguished the last flicker of hope for the Jews who remained in Eretz Yisrael after the destruction of the First Temple.",
                    "Moreover, just a few years before the State of Israel was established, six million Jews were horrifically and cruelly murdered. They were our brothers no less than the soldiers who fell in battle, and they were far greater in number, more than 300 times the number of soldiers who have died in all of Israel’s wars. How, then, can we establish a day of mourning for Israel’s soldiers on the same scale as for the six million?",
                    "Rather, if a memorial day is warranted, it is on condition that we dedicate the day to educating the public about the essence and purpose of the nation of Israel and about the value of self-sacrifice on behalf of the Jewish people. Many people mistakenly believe that the more we bow our heads in grief and express our pain over the fallen soldiers through somber hues, the more we honor their memories. However, the opposite is true. Our attitude toward the fallen should be that they are holy; their entire lives were refined and sanctified through their self-sacrifice for the people and land of Israel. The Sages say about such people, “No one can dwell in the section of the Garden of Eden where those who were killed by the kingdom dwell” (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 50a). A nonbeliever thinks that the fallen are deader than the living, but a believing Jew knows that they are more alive than all the rest. They died young in this world, but they are truly alive in the everlasting world, the World to Come. They are much more alive than we are. They are holy, and, as the Sages say, “What is holy exists forever” (<i>San</i>. 92a).",
                    "By dying in sanctification of God’s name, they rose above the personal existence of each individual Jew to the all-encompassing level of the entire Jewish people. By sacrificing their lives for the Jewish people, they were elevated to the status of the Jewish people as a whole, and as a result they are more connected to God, the source of life. Therefore, in dying they added much life in both the World of Truth and this world. Moreover, it is to their credit that we can live in Israel today; everything we accomplish is thanks to them.",
                    "Sadly, people who lack faith, who do not understand the Jewish people’s past or its mission, have seized control of the Israel’s media and cultural life. In the beginning, the secularists still possessed an inkling of Judaism, based on what they heard in their parents’ home, but over time, alienation from Torah values took its toll and they turned Yom Ha-zikaron into a day of weakness and defeatism. Instead of honoring the memories of the fallen, trying to understand the essence of the nation of Israel, and investing meaning into the soldiers’ self-sacrifice, they emphasize the pain, despair, and destruction, portraying the deaths of these soldiers as meaningless. They appear to be honoring the fallen, but in reality, there is no greater affront to the honor of these martyrs than the inappropriate character that these people have attached to Yom Ha-zikaron. The fundamental flaw in their approach is their disregard for the Jewish national destiny for whose sake the soldiers sacrificed their lives.",
                    "If we nonetheless observe Yom Ha-zikaron, we must underscore the soldiers’ self-sacrifice in sanctification of God’s name. We must emphasize how they demonstrated to us that the vision of the ingathering of the exiles and the rebirth of the nation of Israel in its ancient homeland is so great that it is worth giving up one’s life in this world for its sake. This will strengthen us and inspire us to follow their lead. The children we bear and raise exist in their merit; the settlements we establish flourish because of them; the Torah we learn is theirs; the ethical Jewish society we want to build here, as the prophets foretold, is theirs. If we remember this, and exert a great deal of effort, we will be able to continue in their path, the path of self-sacrifice for the Jewish people. Then we will truly honor them, as holy and pure souls, illuminating the world and shining like the glow of the heavens.",

Flags will be lowered to half-mast in all public buildings.<br>In addition, the Knesset decided that “Two minutes of silence will be observed throughout the entire country, during which all work and travel will cease.” To facilitate the two minutes of silence, a siren wails throughout the country, and people stand still in honor of the fallen. At 8:00 p.m. on Yom Ha-zikaron evening, the siren sounds for one minute, and at 11:00 a.m. the next morning it sounds for two minutes, during which time people dedicate their thoughts to the memory of the fallen. The siren is sounded in the middle of the official ceremonies to begin the commemoration.",
                    "Some claim that one may not stand at attention when the siren sounds, because this custom has no basis in rabbinic literature. Rather, we copied it from the gentiles, and one may not follow the ways of the nations, as it says, “Nor shall you follow their laws” (Vayikra 18:3). In practice, however, the vast majority of <i>poskim</i> maintain that the prohibition against following the ways of the gentiles applies only when one of two conditions is met: 1) the custom entails a breach of modesty or humility; 2) it has no apparent reason or benefit, making it clear that it is based on non-Jewish superstition (Maharik, §88; Rivash §158). R. Yosef Karo and Rema concur (<i>Beit Yosef</i> and Rema, YD 178:1). Thus, since the custom in question has a purpose – the siren and the minutes of silence unite everyone together in remembrance of the fallen – it is not considered a forbidden gentile practice.<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Despite this, the Vilna Gaon opines that we may not imitate the gentiles even with regard to a custom that has a rationale behind it. Therefore, he prohibits placing branches in a synagogue on Shavu’ot, because the gentiles put trees in their houses of worship on their holidays (<i>Ḥayei Adam</i> 131:13; see <i>Bi’ur Ha-Gra</i>, YD 178:7). Practically speaking, though, most <i>poskim</i> disagree with him and uphold the custom of decorating the synagogue on Shavu’ot, as Rema 494:3 and MA 494:5 state: Since there are reasons for this custom, it is not considered following the laws of the gentiles. Furthermore, if that is their ruling with regard to the custom of placing branches in a synagogue, which is actually done in houses of idol worship, there should certainly be no concern regarding the custom of standing during the siren, which has no hint of idolatry whatsoever. In addition, this custom is almost unheard of among non-Jews today.</i>",

Zvi Yehuda Kook, writes, “Standing during the siren for the fallen soldiers of the IDF contains within it the holy mitzva of remembering the glory of the holy martyrs.” Moreover, we may add that meditating on the memory of the martyrs and on the mitzva to sacrifice one’s life to save the nation and conquer Eretz Yisrael is tantamount to thinking Torah thoughts. And even those who do not understand this must be mindful of Hillel the Elder’s teaching: “Do not separate from the community” (<i>Avot</i> 2:4).<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Pesikta Zutreta</i> (<i>Lekaḥ Tov</i>) on Shemot 2:11 states:<br>“Some time after that, when Moshe had grown up, he went out…” – He went out to see the suffering of Israel. This is what Hillel taught, “Do not separate from the community.” If one sees the community in pain, he should not say, “I will go to my house, eat and drink, and all will be well with me.” Rather, one should bear the burden with his fellow Jews.<br><i>Midrash Sekhel Tov</i>, commenting on the same verse, adds:<br>This is what Hillel taught, “Do not separate yourself from the community.” Our Sages taught, “If the community is in pain and someone separates from them and eats and drinks, two ministering angels accompany him, place food (some versions read “coals”) on his head, and say, ‘So-and-so separated himself from the community in their time of trouble; he shall not see the community’s consolation.”’ We learn from a different <i>beraita</i>: When the community is in pain, one should not say, “I will go to my house, eat and drink, and all will be well with me.” And if he did so, the verse says about him, “Instead, there was rejoicing and merriment, killing of cattle and slaughtering of sheep, eating of meat and drinking of wine: Eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!” (Yeshayahu 22:13). What is written afterward? “Then the Lord of Hosts revealed Himself to my ears: “This iniquity shall never be forgiven you until you die.”<br>R. Zvi Yehuda Kook’s position is quoted in <i>Teḥumin</i>, vol. 3, p. 388. See also R. Yaakov Ariel’s <i>Responsa Be-ohalah shel Torah</i>, YD 23. R. Ḥayim David Halevi writes in <i>Aseh Lekha Rav</i> 4:4 that one who is involved in Torah study at home should continue learning, for standing silently is an illusory form of honor, which one must practice only when others are watching. R. Halevi adds that in public, one may stand and continue thinking about the topic he was studying. R. Yehuda Henkin concurs in <i>Teḥumin</i>, vol. 4, p. 125. However, I believe that what I wrote in the main text is correct, as contemplating the mitzva of <i>kiddush Hashem</i> is itself considered meditating on Torah, and it is preferable to include oneself in the community with such holy thoughts.</i>"

Even though the <i>yahrzeit </i>of a great individual is generally a sad occasion, the kabbalists conveyed in the name of R. Shimon bar Yoḥai that he wanted people to rejoice on his <i>yahrzeit</i>. The <i>Zohar</i> calls the day of R. Shimon bar Yoḥai’s passing a “<i>hilula</i>,” a term linked to wedding celebrations. A person’s level of intimacy with the <i>Shekhina</i> in this world is akin to betrothal, whereas in the next world the level of intimacy is more comparable to marriage. In this world, death is viewed as being exceedingly sad, and when a righteous person dies, he leaves a void, and the nation mourns his loss. In the supernal worlds, however, it is understood that everything is for the best. On the contrary, when a truly righteous person is freed from the shackles of this world, he can absorb the full light of the Torah. This is especially true of those sages who delve into the esoteric aspects of the Torah, for their primary engagement is with the inner light of the Torah and the soul. As long as they remain within the confines of this world, its physical boundaries obscure the light of the Torah and the soul. However, when they depart from this world and are released from its physical boundaries, the gates of wisdom and inner light are opened wide before them. Then they are able to understand fully the deep secrets they studied during their lives. Already on the day they die, it is possible to discern that the walls and barriers of this world are fading away. Accordingly, <i>Idra Zuta</i> (<i>Zohar </i>3:287b and 3:296a) relates that on the day R. Shimon bar Yoḥai died, he revealed deep and wondrous secrets that he was not allowed to reveal beforehand, and he simultaneously cried and rejoiced.",
                    "Therefore, the day that a righteous person dies is like a wedding, because on that day he can consummate his connection to the <i>Shekhina</i>, and his Torah becomes a great source of illumination in the supernal realms. Consequently, his disciples and successors in this world can better connect to the depth of his Torah and esoteric teachings. Therefore, disciples who understand this deep idea customarily celebrate a <i>hilula</i> on the day their righteous master, who revealed the Torah’s secrets, died.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Pri Tzadik</i> (<i>Lag Ba-omer</i> 1), R. Tzadok Ha-Kohen of Lublin explains that there is a distinction between the anniversaries of death of a great scholar in the realm of the Written Torah and a great scholar in the realm of the Oral Torah. The Written Torah is fixed and stable, and thus the day when a great scholar of this corpus died – such as the seventh of Adar, when Moshe died – is a painful day. In contrast, we celebrate a <i>hilula</i> on the day a great scholar of the Oral Torah died, because his Torah continues to proliferate and become more nuanced after his death.</i>",
                    "R. Shimon bar Yoḥai, who composed the <i>Zohar</i>, is unique in that even Jews who do not understand the secrets of the Torah celebrate his <i>hilula</i>. This is how Lag Ba-omer became a day of celebration for the esoteric side of the Torah. Many people go up to Mount Meron for R. Shimon bar Yoḥai’s <i>hilula</i>. The great scholars among them rejoice over the secrets that were revealed to them in his merit and in the merit of his disciples and successors. Even though the masses who join in the festivities do not understand the secrets of the Torah, they rejoice over the fact that the Torah is deeper than the sea and that there are great scholars and righteous people who connect to its deep secrets, as this entire world of darkness is made slightly more pleasant because of them. Furthermore, the very recognition that there are deep secrets beyond the average person’s comprehension generates humility and wisdom, and even simple folk are elevated by virtue of this awareness."

                    "<b>Lag Ba-omer / The Personality of R. Shimon bar Yoḥai</b>",
                    "Before we elaborate on the customs of the <i>hilula</i>, we will briefly discuss the unique character of R. Shimon bar Yoḥai and his mentor, R. Akiva. In general, the Sages tended to act according to the “middle path,” taking into consideration the difficulties that commonly arise in this world. R. Shimon bar Yoḥai, however, adhered to the absolute truth, without considering the real limitations of this world. Therefore, miracles were performed on his behalf, and he met with success in his endeavors.",
                    "One expression of R. Shimon bar Yoḥai’s approach pertains to foreign rule over Eretz Yisrael. The Sages taught that a Jew should pray for the welfare of the kingdom under whose rule he lives, and they tried, to the best of their ability, to avoid clashes between the Jewish people and the various empires that ruled over them. Only when there was no other recourse, and the kingdom forced the Jewish people to violate their religion, did the Sages call for rebellion. In the absence of religious persecution, however, they would try to find a way to reconcile with the kingdom. Accordingly, the Talmud (<i>Shabbat</i> 33b) relates that several of the Sages were once talking about the Roman Empire. R. Yehuda b. Ila’i began the discussion with words of praise for the Romans, saying, “How pleasant are the deeds of this nation; they established marketplaces, erected bridges, and built bathhouses.” Even though R. Yehuda knew that the Romans issued harsh decrees against the Jews – even destroying the Second Temple and killing hundreds of thousands of Jews during the Great Revolt and the Bar Kokhba revolt – he preferred to concentrate on the positive side of their rule, in order to avoid heightening tensions. R. Yosi preferred to remain silent. Apparently, he did not agree with R. Yehuda’s words of praise, but he did not want to denounce the Romans either, so as not to create pointless tensions. R. Shimon bar Yoḥai, in contrast, was unable to tolerate words of praise for the evil Roman Empire, and he said, “All that they built they built solely for their own needs. They established marketplaces in which to station prostitutes, bathhouses in which to pamper themselves, and bridges from which to collect taxes.” The Romans found out about this conversation and decreed: R. Yehuda, who praised us, shall be promoted; R. Yosi, who remained silent, shall be exiled; and R. Shimon bar Yoḥai, who denounced us, shall be put to death. R. Shimon bar Yoḥai fled and hid in the <i>beit midrash</i> (study hall) together with his son, while his wife provided them with food and water. It is important to note that after the rebellions that the Jews staged against the Roman Empire – rebellions that caused many Roman deaths and shook the entire empire – the Romans took no chances and hunted down any display of Jewish opposition to their rule. Apparently, Roman troops searched for R. Shimon bar Yoḥai for years, in order to kill him. The situation became so dangerous that R. Shimon bar Yoḥai could no longer rely on his wife, so he and his son moved into a cave. Miraculously, a carob tree sprouted outside the cave and a spring began to flow there, providing them sustenance for twelve years, until they heard that the emperor had died and his decree was nullified. R. Shimon bar Yoḥai and his son reached such great heights in spirituality and asceticism while there, that when they left the cave they could not tolerate worldly matters; everywhere they looked burst into flames. Consequently, they had to return to the cave for another year in order to delve deeper into the Torah and understand the value of this world. Only then did they leave the cave permanently (<i>Shabbat</i> 33b).",
                    "Another example of R. Shimon bar Yoḥai’s uncompromising attitude concerns the issue of making a livelihood. Most of the Sages maintained that everyone must work for a living; even Torah scholars must work and support themselves. R. Shimon bar Yoḥai, on the other hand, said:<br>If a man plows at the time of plowing, plants at the time of planting, reaps at the time of reaping, threshes at the time of threshing, and winnows when it is windy, what will be of the Torah? Rather, when Israel does God’s will, their work is done by others, and when they fail to do God’s will, they do their own work… (and even) the work of others.” (<i>Ber</i>. 35b)<br>The Gemara concludes with the practical comment of Abaye: “Many have followed the advice of R. Yishma’el (who advocated combining Torah study with a worldly occupation), and it has worked well; others have followed R. Shimon bar Yoḥai and it has not been successful.” Likewise, Rava instructed his students to work for two months of the year in order to support themselves (<i>Ber. </i>35b).",
                    "Admittedly, R. Shimon bar Yoḥai’s approach is not suitable for the public at large, and the necessities of life force us to take its constraints into consideration, in accordance with the view of most of the Sages. Indeed, it is God’s will that we work toward perfecting the world while taking into account the obstacles in our way and without relying on miracles.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When R. Shimon and R. Yehuda disagree, the <i>halakha </i>follows R. Yehuda. When R. Shimon and R. Yosi disagree, the <i>halakha </i>follows R. Yosi (<i>Eruvin </i>46b). Similarly, R. Shimon said that one may provoke the wicked in this world (<i>Ber.</i> 7b). In addition, he clung to the Torah so diligently that Torah became his profession. Therefore, <i>Shabbat</i> 11a states that he was exempt from praying, because prayer deals with temporal life, as opposed to Torah, which is eternal life. He also spoke a great deal about the uniqueness of Israel. For example: “Wherever Israel was exiled, the Divine Presence accompanied them” (<i>Megilla</i> 29a), and “The Holy One, blessed be He, gave Israel three gifts by way of suffering: Torah, Eretz Yisrael, and the World to Come” (<i>Ber.</i> 5a).</i> Nonetheless, it is very valuable to have a great Torah scholar who lives his life according to eternal values, without compromise. This way, everyone can see tangibly the absolute adherence to Torah. It is true that practical decisions and general guidance for the public are determined by the majority of the Sages of Israel, who take into account the limitations of this world and extenuating circumstances. Nevertheless, the grand vision of faith and redemption shines forth from the strength of R. Shimon bar Yoḥai, who sacrificed himself for Israel’s glory and its faith, establishing for future generations that the Roman Empire, which persecuted the Jews, was an evil kingdom. This is why the Jewish masses hallow and venerate R. Shimon bar Yoḥai.",
                    "R. Shimon bar Yoḥai’s focus on the esoteric side of the Torah is connected to his unique personality. By studying these dimensions of the Torah, one can connect better to what lies beyond ordinary life in this world, to the eternal world, to Israel’s unique character, and to the assurance of redemption. Such study elevates a person beyond our opaque and troublesome external existence and illuminates eternal concepts for him with a rare light."

                    "<b>Lag Ba-omer / R. Akiva</b>",
                    "Hidden within the <i>hilula</i> celebration of Lag Ba-omer is another memorial: a memorial for the greatest expositor of the Oral Torah, the wondrous Tanna, R. Akiva, one of whose five greatest disciples was R. Shimon bar Yoḥai. The Talmud relates that R. Shimon bar Yoḥai would encourage his students to review his own teachings because they were a condensed version of R. Akiva’s teachings (<i>Gittin</i> 67a). R. Shimon bar Yoḥai also learned to sacrifice himself for Israel’s honor from his master, as R. Akiva supported the rebellion against the Romans and encouraged Bar Kokhba’s revolt. In addition, the celebration of the esoteric Torah on Lag Ba-omer is connected to R. Akiva as well: It is said that R. Akiva entered the <i>Pardes</i> (lit. “orchard” or “paradise”) – that is, the deep secrets of the Torah – and came out unscathed (<i>Ḥagiga</i> 14b). In contrast, the other sages who entered with him did not come out unscathed, as they were incapable of absorbing the awesome secrets of the <i>Pardes</i>.",
                    "The halakhic reason given for rejoicing on Lag Ba-omer revolves around the fact that R. Akiva’s disciples continued the tradition of the Torah, as we explained above (section 1). After all, R. Akiva is one of the pillars of the Oral Torah. R. Tzadok Ha-Kohen of Lublin explains (<i>Pri Tzadik</i>, <i>Lag Ba-omer</i> 1) that the Sages did not establish a <i>hilula</i> on the anniversary of R. Akiva’s death because he was killed by the government. Therefore, they established the <i>hilula</i> on the day his student, R. Shimon bar Yoḥai, died. Thus, it turns out that R. Shimon bar Yoḥai’s <i>hilula</i> includes R. Akiva’s <i>hilula </i>as well. Therefore, it is appropriate to focus on R. Akiva’s teachings and greatness on Lag Ba-omer.",
                    "There was almost no one who began studying Torah under worse conditions than R. Akiva. Nonetheless, by virtue of his diligence and great faith, he reached the loftiest heights (see <i>Avot De-Rabbi Natan</i>, ch. 6). To a large extent, this was due to his wife Raḥel, the daughter of Kalba Savu’a, one of the wealthiest Jews of the age. She recognized the greatness of his soul and promised that she would marry him if he would study Torah. Her wealthy father disowned her as a result, but she refused to change her mind, marrying R. Akiva and becoming one of the poorest Jews of the time. Despite all this, she continued, with great self-sacrifice, to encourage her husband to study Torah. After R. Akiva became the greatest Torah sage of his generation, he said to his students, “My [knowledge] and your [knowledge] are truly hers” (<i>Ketubot</i> 63a).",
                    "R. Yehuda said in the name of Rav: When Moshe ascended on high, he found the Holy One, blessed be He, engaged in affixing coronets to the letters. He said to Him, “Master of the Universe, who is preventing You?” (Who needs these precise coronets? No one understands their meaning, anyway.) God responded to him, “There will arise a person, many generations from now, named Akiva ben Yosef, who will derive heaps of laws from every jot…. Moshe replied, “Master of the Universe, You have such a man and You are giving the Torah through me?” He replied, “Be silent! This is what arose in My thoughts ….” (<i>Menaḥot</i> 29b)<br>The fact that God showed Moshe R. Akiva specifically, from among all the Sages of Israel, indicates that he is considered the greatest expositor of the Oral Torah. (See also <i>San</i>. 86a, where the Gemara states that all anonymous halakhic teachings stem from him.)",
                    "R. Akiva’s dedication to faith in God and Torah was boundless. Even after 24,000 of his students died, he did not lose faith. Rather, he continued to teach more students, who proceeded to spread Torah throughout Israel. When he saw a fox leaving the site of the Holy of Holies, and his colleagues cried, he began to rejoice because of his faith that just as the prophets’ warnings of disaster came true, so too will their words of consolation (<i>Makkot</i> 24b).",
                    "When the Romans issued a decree prohibiting Torah study, R. Akiva sacrificed himself by teaching Torah to the masses. He was eventually caught, incarcerated, and sentenced to a cruel death. The Sages say:<br>When R. Akiva was taken out for execution, it was the time to recite the <i>Shema</i>. And while they combed his flesh with iron combs, he was accepting upon himself the yoke of the kingship of heaven (by reciting the <i>Shema</i>). His disciples said to him, “Our master, even to this point?” (One is exempt from reciting the <i>Shema</i> under such excruciating circumstances. Why, then, are you exerting yourself so greatly to read it now?) He said to them, “All my days I have been troubled by the verse, ‘With all your soul,’ [which I interpret to mean that one must love God] ‘even if He takes your soul.’ I said, ‘When will I have the opportunity to fulfill this?’ Now that I have the opportunity, shall I not fulfill it?” He prolonged the word <i>eḥad</i> (in the verse, “Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is one [<i>eḥad</i>]”) until his soul departed while saying it. A heavenly voice went forth and proclaimed, “Happy are you, Akiva, that your soul has departed with the word <i>eḥad</i>”…. A heavenly voice went forth and proclaimed, “Happy are you, R. Akiva, for you are destined for life in the World to Come.” (<i>Ber</i>. 61b)"

There are even testimonies that great rabbis followed this practice. On the other hand, some authorities are skeptical about this practice, claiming that it has no basis and, worse, that it is forbidden because of <i>bal tashḥit </i>(the prohibition against destroying things needlessly). It is true that people used to burn the king’s clothes after his death, but that was because no one else may use them, out of honor for the king. Here, however, why should we burn clothing for no reason (<i>Sho’el U-meshiv</i>, 5:39; <i>Ḥikrei Lev</i>, <i>Mahadura Batra</i>, YD 11)? Others try to justify the custom, saying that one transgresses the prohibition of <i>bal tashḥit</i> only when destroying something for truly no reason, but if there is a purpose, like honoring R. Shimon bar Yoḥai, it is permissible (see <i>Torah Li-shmah</i> §206). In practice, if one’s ancestors did not follow this practice, it is inappropriate for him to observe such a disputed custom.

Some authorities permit one to turn to a deceased saint to ask him to intercede before the Exalted One on behalf of those who pray at his grave (<i>Pri Megadim</i>, <i>Eshel Avraham</i> 581:16). Others, however, prohibit this, because this too has elements of necromancy. Rather, we must direct all of our prayers exclusively to the Master of the Universe, without involving any intermediaries. One who is praying to God may ask Him to accept his prayers in the merit of a particular sage or saint (Maharil, <i>Taz</i> 581:39), because when we connect to the Torah teachings and good deeds of a righteous person, we become better, more perfect people, and in that merit we ask God to accept our prayers."

                    "After the destruction of the First Temple, the prophets instituted fast days in commemoration of the terrible events surrounding its destruction and the exile of the Jews from their land. They wished to inspire the people to feel pain and mourn the destruction and the exile, and lead them to repent and rectify the evil deeds that caused all the misfortune that has been visited upon the Jewish people from then until this very day.",
                    "They instituted a fast on the tenth of Tevet (Asara Be-Tevet) because that is when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia began his siege of Jerusalem. They instituted a fast in Tamuz because the walls of Jerusalem were breached in that month. The ninth of Av was established as a fast day (Tisha Be-Av) because the Temple was destroyed on that day. The third of Tishrei (Tzom Gedalia) was instituted as a fast over the murder of Gedalia ben Aḥikam – leader of the Jews who remained in Judea after the destruction of the Temple – because his death extinguished the last ember of Jewish sovereignty in Eretz Yisrael.",
                    "The Jewish people observed these fasts throughout the seventy-year Babylonian exile. When they were privileged to build the Second Temple, the question arose: Must we continue fasting on these days? The prophet Zechariah answered:<br>Thus said the Lord of Hosts: The fast of the fourth month (in Tamuz), the fast of the fifth month (9 Av), the fast of the seventh month (Tzom Gedalia), and the fast of the tenth month (10 Tevet) shall become occasions for joy and gladness, happy festivals for the House of Judah; but you must love honesty and integrity. (Zechariah 8:19)<br>Indeed, during the Second Temple era, these days became joyous festivals.",
                    "When the Second Temple was destroyed, the original enactment was reinstated for all four fast days. However, the date of the fast in Tamuz, commemorating the breach of Jerusalem’s walls, was changed. When the First Temple was destroyed, the city was breached on the ninth of Tamuz, and thus the Jewish people fasted on that day throughout the seventy-year Babylonian exile. When the Second Temple was destroyed, however, Jerusalem was breached on the seventeenth of Tamuz, which is when we have fasted ever since. Even though the four fasts were originally instituted by the prophets to commemorate the destruction of the First Temple – which is why we fast on the tenth of Tevet, which is when Nebuchadnezzar laid siege to Jerusalem during the time of the First Temple, and on Tzom Gedalia, which marks the end of Jewish sovereignty in Eretz Yisrael at the end of the First Temple era – the Sages nonetheless decided to establish the fast commemorating the breach of Jerusalem’s on the seventeenth of Tamuz (Shiva Asar Be-Tamuz), which is when the city was breached at the time of the Second Temple, because the pain of the second destruction is more acute to us. Furthermore, the verse calls that fast “the fast of the fourth month,” implying that the most important part the enactment is that it should take place sometime during the fourth month, Tamuz. Therefore, even when the Sages changed the date from the ninth to the seventeenth, they did not substantively alter the prophets’ enactment of a fast in the fourth month over the breach of Jerusalem. Nothing changed with regard to the ninth of Av, because both Temples were destroyed on that day.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tashbetz</i> 2:271 explains at length that the four fasts commemorate primarily the destruction of the First Temple, which is when the divine Presence departed, and when the prophets first enacted the fasts. The Sages, who lived after the destruction of the Second Temple, did not alter the original enactment, as evident from the fact that they did not institute a fast on the day the Romans began their war on Jerusalem. We fast on the seventeenth of Tamuz instead of the ninth because the original enactment of a fast day commemorating the breach of Jerusalem referred to the month of Tamuz. Therefore, it may be moved from the ninth to the seventeenth. Ramban writes in <i>Torat Ha-adam</i> (p. 243, Chavel edition) that we fast on the seventeenth of Tamuz because the destruction of the Second Temple is more painful for us (based on <i>Yoma</i> 9b). According to the Yerushalmi, R. Tanḥum b. Ḥanila’i said that, in truth, Jerusalem was breached on the seventeenth of Tamuz during the First Temple period as well. The people simply miscalculated, thinking that the breach had occurred on the ninth, and the verse (Yirmiyahu 39:2, 52:6) did not want to deviate from what the people thought (<i>y. Ta’anit</i> 4:5). However, Rava states that at the time of the First Temple, the city was indeed breached on the ninth of Tamuz, while the same tragic event took place on the seventeenth of Tamuz in the Second Temple era (<i>Ta’anit</i> 28b). <i>Tosafot</i> (RH 18b, s.v. “zeh”) state that the Bavli and the Yerushalmi dispute the matter.</i>"

The Chief Rabbinate of Israel further established it as a day of general mourning and recitation of <i>Kaddish</i> (<i>Yom Ha-Kaddish Ha-klali</i>) for the martyrs who were killed in the Holocaust and whose date of death is unknown.",

Ezra enacted ten fundamental decrees (BK 82a), and, by doing so, laid the foundation for the activities of the Sages of the Oral Torah, who likewise made enactments and instituted safeguards to protect the Torah. The Sages further state that Ezra, who migrated from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael to build the Second Temple, was actually the prophet Malachi (<i>Megilla</i> 15a). That is, on one hand, he was the last of the prophets, of those who belong to the era of the Written Torah; while on the other hand, he was the first Sage of the Oral Torah. Thus, he was the great Torah scholar who linked the Written Torah and Oral Torah. And just like Moshe, he cared for the people of Israel and bore the burden of leading them. He was one of the leaders of the return to Eretz Yisrael from Babylonia and one of the builders of the Second Temple.",

That day was as calamitous for Israel as the day when the Golden Calf was made, because the Torah belongs to the Jewish people, and its translation into Greek undermined its uniqueness, allowing it to be viewed at something that anyone can handle. This occurred on the eighth of Tevet, causing darkness to descend upon the world for three days. Therefore, on Asara Be-Tevet, we mention this painful event as well.",

When he descended the mountain carrying the Tablets of the Covenant, which were engraved with the Ten Commandments, he saw that a golden calf had been fashioned, and some of the people were straying after it.

Its importance stems from its consistency: They would bring the <i>Tamid</i> offering twice a day, every day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon.

On the seventeenth of Tamuz, they succeeded in breaking through the walls of Jerusalem and penetrating inward. Practically speaking, once the city was breached, the campaign was lost. Battles continued to rage in Jerusalem for another three weeks, but in the end, the Romans conquered the Temple Mount and burned down the Second Temple on the ninth of Av, thus beginning the long period of our exile.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the previous note regarding the breach of Jerusalem’s walls during the First Temple period, which the verse says occurred on the ninth of Tamuz, and the reason we fast on the day it happened during the Second Temple period.</i>",

Each one manifests a crisis that first affects spiritual roots, then pierces the wall of faith, and finally causes severe damage that, if not repaired promptly, will lead to total destruction, as symbolized by Tisha Be-Av. The sin of the Golden Calf was not outright heresy. The people still believed in God as the Creator of the world, but they believed that the Calf had certain powers as well. Once they began with their strange forms of worship, however, they no longer had the fortitude to resist the bad report later brought by the spies, and they rebelled against God and His servant Moshe. Thus, they violated the purpose for which the nation of Israel was created – the revelation of the divine Presence in this world – in the very land that was dedicated to this purpose, Eretz Yisrael. The same is true of the termination of the <i>Tamid</i> offering, the placement of an idol in the Temple, and the burning of the Torah.

Therefore, they felt it necessary to search for a god that could serve as an intermediary between them and the Creator. Consequently, God later forgave the Jews for this sin. When it came to the Sin of the Spies, however, the people denied God’s ability to operate in this world and help them conquer Eretz Yisrael. They even betrayed their main mission, for which the world was created and for which Israel was chosen – to reveal the divine Presence in this world, through Eretz Yisrael. Therefore, God did not pardon the Sin of the Spies; rather, He decreed that all those who participated in the sin must die in the desert. Only Yehoshua b. Nun and Kalev b.

First, it was decreed, on the ninth of Av, that the generation of the wilderness would not enter Eretz Yisrael, and since we did not subsequently rectify the Sin of the Spies, both Temples were destroyed. We failed to rectify the sin after that, as well, so the city of Beitar was destroyed when Bar Kokhba’s rebellion faltered, and Jerusalem was plowed up.

After the First Temple was destroyed and most of the Jewish people were exiled to Babylonia, the king of Babylonia appointed Gedalia b. Aḥikam to govern the Jews who remained in Judea. The Jewish people as a whole hoped that this surviving remnant, by reestablishing themselves in Eretz Yisrael, could rebuild the Temple and reestablish Jewish sovereignty, together with those who would eventually return from Babylonia after seventy years of exile. Indeed, for some time it seemed that the meager population that remained in the land was recovering from the Temple’s destruction and beginning to cultivate fields and vineyards.",
                    "However, the king of Ammon, who wanted to eradicate the remnant of Israel, sent Yishmael b. Netania to murder Gedalia. Yishmael had an additional, personal reason to carry out the scheme: He was a member of Judea’s royal family, and he thought that he should govern Judea instead of Gedalia. Several military officers warned Gedalia about Yishmael and even recommended killing him before he could carry out his plan. But Gedalia did not believe them, accusing them of maligning Yishmael. In the seventh month, Yishmael ben Netania ben Elishama, who was of royal descent and had been one of the king’s officers, came with ten men to Gedalia ben Aḥikam at Mitzpa; and they ate together there at Mitzpa. Then Yishmael ben Netania and the ten men who were with him arose and struck down Gedalia ben Aḥikam ben Shafan with the sword and killed him…along with all the Judeans who were with him…and the Chaldeans who were there.

                    "There is some uncertainty as to when exactly Gedalia was killed. The Talmud states that the murder happened on the third of Tishrei (RH 18b; <i>y. Ta’anit</i> 4:5). However, some Rishonim explain that he was killed on the first of Tishrei, but since the holiday of Rosh Hashana is celebrated on that day, the fast was postponed until the third of Tishrei.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the opinion of Rabbeinu Yeruḥam (<i>Toldot Adam Ve-Ḥava </i>18:2). Likewise, Ibn Ezra and Radak explain that the word “month” in Yirmiyahu 41:1 implies the first of the month, because that is when the month begins. The fast was simply postponed until the third of the month. Even though only one day of Rosh Ha-shana was observed at that time, the Sages did not want to require us to fast immediately following a holiday. Therefore, they postponed the fast to the third of Tishrei. And even after the practice of observing two days of Rosh Hashana began, the fast remained on the third of Tishrei. <i>Responsa Rosh Yosef</i> maintains that since Tzom Gedalia is observed on a day other than its true date, its laws are more lenient than those of the other fasts. Hence, one who celebrates a <i>brit mila</i> on the third of Tishrei may eat a festive meal and does not need to make up the fast. <i>Taz</i>, OḤ 549, however, dismisses this position, as does BHL <i>ad loc.</i>, based on Ritva. Their reasoning is that even if Gedalia was actually killed on the first of Tishrei, since the fast was established on the third of the month, it is not considered postponed. Rather, that is its proper date.</i>",

This is how the Sages usually enact decrees, modeling them after the Torah’s commandments. Just as Yom Kippur lasts an entire day, from evening to evening, so too, they instituted the four fasts as full-day fasts; just as there are five prohibitions on Yom Kippur – eating and drinking, bathing, anointing oneself, wearing leather shoes, and engaging in sexual relations – so too, they prohibited these things on the fasts over the destruction of the Temple. This is how the Jews observed these fasts throughout the seventy-year Babylonian exile.",

Yehuda Ha-Nasi’s lifetime – the status of these fasts depends on the will of the Jewish people: “If they want, they fast; if they do not want, they do not fast.” This applies to Asara Be-Tevet, Shiva Asar Be-Tamuz, and Tzom Gedalia. Tisha Be-Av, however, does not depend on the nation’s will, and everyone is obligated to fast even in such an intermediate situation, because misfortune abounded and both Temples were destroyed on that day (RH 18b).",

This <i>halakha</i> applies until the Temple is rebuilt, speedily in our days, when the fast days will become days of joy and gladness.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Talmud states (RH 18b):<br>R. Papa said: “What [the verse] means is this: When there is peace, [these days] shall be for joy and gladness; when there are royal decrees, they shall be fast days; if there are no royal decrees but no peace, then if they want they fast, and if they don’t want, they don’t fast.” If that is the case, Tisha Be-Av also [should be optional]!

Papa replied: “Tisha Be-Av is different because several misfortunes happened on it, as Mar said, ‘On Tisha Be-Av, the Temple was destroyed the first and second time, Beitar was captured, and the city [of Jerusalem] was plowed up.’”<br>According to Rashi, the definition of “when there is peace” – when the fasts are canceled – is when the nations of the world have no dominion over the Jews. If so, it is possible that Jews living in the State of Israel today are exempt from fasting. However, most Rishonim, including Ramban, <i>Tur</i>, and others, maintain that “when there is peace” means when the Temple is built. Therefore, even after the establishment of the State of Israel, we are in the intermediate situation and thus must fast in accordance with Jewish custom. The Rishonim also disagree about the nature of the “royal decrees” that render the fasts obligatory. Ramban maintains that it is when the Jewish people experience harsh decrees, while Rashi, <i>Tur</i>, and <i>Tashbetz</i> claim that it is specifically when there is religious persecution, meaning, decrees that prevent us from fulfilling the Torah’s commands. Their dispute stems from variant readings of the Talmud in RH 18b. (In the main text I wrote simply that the fasts became obligatory again after the destruction of the Second Temple. However, <i>Ḥatam Sofer</i>, OḤ 157 states that the Jews began fasting even before the destruction actually took place, once the Sanhedrin was exiled, as <i>Yosippon </i>attests. This shows that despite the existence of the Temple, the harshness of the decrees against the Jewish people is what determines the obligation to fast. Perhaps this supports Rashi’s opinion.)</i>"

Just as the very obligation to fast depends on Israel’s desire, so do the other laws of the fast. And when the Jews accepted upon themselves to fast during these “intermediate” periods, they did not agree to treat these fasts as strictly as they treat Yom Kippur. This is the fundamental difference between the three minor fasts and Tisha Be-Av. Because so many hardships befell us on the ninth of Av, we are obligated to fast on that day even during an intermediate period, and its laws remain as originally established. This means that the fast lasts for an entire 24-hour day and includes prohibitions on bathing, applying ointments, wearing shoes, and engaging in sexual relations, just like on Yom Kippur.",

                    "Another difference is that pregnant and nursing women must fast on Tisha Be-Av. Only illness renders one exempt. On the three minor fasts, however, even pregnant and nursing women who are not ill are exempt from fasting, because when the Jewish people originally accepted upon themselves to fast on these days, they were lenient with regard to pregnant and nursing women, exempting them from fasting (SA 550:1-2).<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">During periods of harsh decrees, must we treat all the fast days like Tisha Be-Av?<b> </b>It would seem that, according to the Gemara (RH 18b, quoted above), during periods of harsh decrees, like the Crusades, the Spanish Inquisition, the Khmelnytsky Uprising, and the Holocaust, the Jews were obligated to fast on the three minor fasts as they did on Tisha Be-Av. However, as far as we know, no Rishonim mention that this was practiced. Even Ramban, who writes, in <i>Torat Ha-adam</i> (p. 243, Chavel edition), that the Jews accepted all the fasts upon themselves in practice, adding, “All the more so in our generation, for due to our sins, Israel’s hardships have proliferated, and there is no peace; therefore, everyone must fast,” nevertheless did not write that one needs to fast from the night before. On the contrary, he concludes, “Go see what the people do.” Apparently, he means to say that it is customary to treat them like minor fasts. This is the ruling in SA 550:2. Perhaps the reason for this is that after the harsh decrees that followed the destruction of the Second Temple ceased, the obligation to fast on the three minor fasts were nullified, and the obligation became dependent on the nation’s will. The people only accepted upon themselves to fast during the day, and since this is all that they accepted, the original institution remained null. Thus, even if there are new decrees, the fast applies only during the daytime. The Vilna Gaon offers a similar explanation in his commentary on <i>Shulḥan Arukh</i>, saying that R. Yehuda Ha-nasi eliminated the more stringent elements of the three fasts when he saw that Israel’s hardships were eased.<br>However, some maintain that we must observe full-day fasts whenever there is a period of harsh decrees and religious persecution. This seems to be the simple understanding of the matter as explained by Ramban and the other <i>poskim</i>. That is, whenever there are harsh decrees, the obligation to fast returns to its original status, and the three minor fasts take on the laws of Tisha Be-Av. <i>Tashbetz</i> 2:271 concurs, but states that if the persecution affects only part of the Jewish people, only those affected must fast from the night before. Sometimes, though, even they are exempt from the stricter fast, since the persecution itself prevents them from fasting.<br><i>Shlah</i>, <i>Masekhet Ta’anit</i>, <i>Ner Mitzva</i> §6 states that it would have been appropriate to be stringent and treat all three minor fasts like Tisha Be-Av, but we do not impose an enactment upon the people unless they can bear it. Therefore, the Sages ruled stringently only with regard to Tisha Be-Av. <i>Sefer Ha-pardes</i> (a work attributed to Rashi) indicates that an individual who feels that he can tolerate it should fast from nightfall on all the fasts. He concludes that it is good to be stringent only in the area of eating, while it is unnecessary to observe the other afflictive prohibitions; and if one wishes to be stringent, he should do so in private, to avoid religious exhibitionism <i>(yuhara</i>)<i>.</i> MA and many other Aḥaronim mention this ruling. Apparently, they understood that since evil decrees existed in their times, it was appropriate to be stringent on the three minor fasts, but the masses did not conduct themselves in this manner. Therefore, individuals who are capable of being stringent should do so. The reason <i>Sefer Ha-pardes</i> ruled leniently regarding the other restrictions is that their status is more lenient from the start. After all, many <i>poskim</i> maintain that these restrictions are not forbidden by Torah law even on Yom Kippur. MA and MB 550:6 state that the only area in which one should not be stringent is wearing shoes, because it would look ridiculous to walk around without shoes when everyone else is wearing shoes. This implies that it is good to be stringent about washing, anointing oneself, and the like. I believe that their reasoning is based on the fact that there were so many harsh decrees, as I wrote above; SHT <i>ad loc. </i>9 concurs.<br>In any event, nowadays, since the establishment of the State of Israel, there seems to be no reason whatsoever to be stringent. We are obligated to fast regardless of the nation’s will only when there are harsh decrees, according to Ramban, or religious persecutions, according to <i>Tashbetz</i> and <i>Tur</i>. But if there are no such torments, all agree that there is no obligation to fast in the manner of Tisha Be-Av on the three minor fasts. Even if we interpret <i>Shlah</i> to mean that the Jewish people would have accepted the three minor fasts as full-day fasts if they were able to do so even during an intermediate period, which depends on Israel’s will, and therefore individuals should fast the entire day, there is still no room whatsoever to be stringent in modern-day Israel, where – thank God – we are not even subservient to the nations of the world. After all, Rashi maintains that the fasts are completely nullified when we are free from the yoke of the nations. While most Rishonim disagree with Rashi (see n. 1 above), if Rashi considers a situation joyous, it cannot possibly be a day on which fasting is completely obligatory. Therefore, there is no room to be stringent by fasting from the night before and observing the other restrictions on the three minor fasts as we do on Tisha Be-Av.</i>",
                    "Preferably, one should be stringent and refrain from bathing in hot water during a minor fast, but one may bathe in lukewarm water for purposes of cleanliness. During the fast, it is also inappropriate to cut one’s hair, listen to joyous music, or shop for things that make one happy.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">SA 550:2 rules that one may bathe on the minor fasts. Most <i>poskim</i> agree, and the <i>halakha</i> follows their opinion. <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Ta’anit</i> 13a, s.v. “ve-khol”) quotes Raavya as saying that one may even bathe in hot water, adding that his father R. Yoel prohibits the use of hot water. Several other Rishonim and Aḥaronim mention this stringency. Two possible explanations can be given for this stringency. 1) The Sages introduced it at a time of harsh decrees; if so, there is no room to adopt it nowadays, as explained in the previous note. 2) It was enacted in order to ensure that the three minor fasts are not more lenient than the Nine Days, on which we do not bathe due to our mourning over the destruction of the Temple. This reason is mentioned in BHL 551:2, s.v. “me-Rosh Ḥodesh” and SHT 550:8 in the name of <i>Eliya Rabba</i>, <i>Ateret Zahav</i>, and <i>Pri Megadim</i>. One who wishes to be stringent in this matter should observe all the customs of the Nine Days, which include not listening to joyous music, not cutting one’s hair, and not reciting <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> if possible, <i>le-khtatḥila </i>(see below 8:7; <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim </i>551:209). There is no custom to refrain from doing laundry (perhaps because it is a custom of mourning that is only meaningful if it is observed for an extended period of time and it has no significance if it is observed for just one day). It is appropriate to avoid large celebrations like dances, even on the night of a fast. Regarding weddings, however, there are varying opinions. Since weddings involve the fulfillment of a mitzva, they may be permitted on the night of a fast. Nonetheless, on the night of 17 Tamuz, one should follow the more stringent opinion, because the Three Weeks begin then and it is not fortuitous to hold such events during that period (below ch. 8 n. 1). Some authorities prohibit washing even in cold water on the minor fasts. In practice, however, it seems that even one who wants to be stringent in general may be lenient and wash in lukewarm water, as one may be lenient on this issue even during the Nine Days (see below 8:19). It is a mitzva to bathe in hot water in honor of Shabbat (SA 260:1); therefore, if one of the minor fasts falls out on a Friday, one should bathe in hot water.</i>"

                    "The minor fasts last from dawn (<i>alot ha-shaḥar</i>) until <i>tzeit ha-kokhavim </i>(when three medium-sized stars are visible in the sky). There are different opinions as to when exactly <i>alot ha-shaḥar</i> occurs: either when the first light begins to appear in the east (when the sun is 17.5 degrees below the horizon) or a short time later, when the eastern part of the sky is illuminated (and the sun is 16.1 degrees below the horizon).",
                    "Likewise, there are also two primary opinions about when <i>tzeit ha-kokhavim</i> occurs: either when experts or those with excellent eyesight can see three stars (and the sun is 4.8 degrees below the horizon) or when average people can see three stars (and the sun is 6.2 degrees below the horizon).",

This is not the case: these intervals depend on the time of year and the place. Therefore, one should use a precise calendar to determine these times.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Regarding <i>alot ha-shaḥar</i>, see <i>Peninei Halakha</i>: <i>Prayer</i>, ch. 11 nn. 1 and 10. Regarding <i>tzeit ha-kokhavim</i>, see <i>ibid</i>. ch. 25 n. 3. I will provide some examples in order to give the reader an idea of the differences. According to the 16.1  measurement, the interval between <i>alot ha-shaḥar</i> and <i>hanetz ha-ḥama</i> in Eretz Yisrael on Tzom Gedalia is c. 73 minutes, whereas it is c. 86 minutes on 17 Tamuz. According to the 17.5T measurement, the interval is c. 80 minutes on Tzom Gedalia and c. 94 minutes on 17 Tamuz. I approximate because the solar date that coincides with the Hebrew date changes from year to year, resulting in a fluctuation of c. two minutes. On Israel’s coastal plain, the sun rises later because the mountains in the east hide the sun longer. Therefore, the interval between <i>alot ha-shaḥar</i> and sunrise<i> </i>increases by about five minutes. The interval between <i>shki’a</i> and <i>tzeit ha-kokhavim</i> also fluctuates depending on the time of year, but the difference is smaller. There is also a considerable difference between the hill country and the plains in Israel. According to the earlier measurement (4.8.), the interval between <i>shki’a</i> and <i>tzeit</i> in Jerusalem on Tzom Gedalia can be as short as 14 minutes. And according to the later measurement (6.2 ), the interval on the coastal plain on 17 Tamuz can be as long as 29.5 minutes. This is why one must use a precise calendar. In the footnotes cited above from <i>Peninei Halakha</i>:<i> Prayer</i>, I explain the issue in depth.</i>",

Therefore, if one went to sleep the night before a fast and woke up before dawn, he may not eat, since he had already taken his mind off of eating. However, if he stipulates mentally before going to sleep that he will eat if he wakes up before dawn, he may eat, because he has not yet accepted the fast upon himself.",

Therefore, it is as if he had in mind to drink if he wakes up before dawn. <i>Shulḥan Arukh</i> (564:1), however, maintains that there is no difference between eating and drinking, and only one who stipulates before going to sleep that he will drink some water when he wakes up before dawn may do so. In practice, one who wants to drink before the fast begins should stipulate mentally that he will do so, but <i>be-di’avad</i>, one who wakes up before dawn and is thirsty may drink, even if he failed to stipulate this (see MB 564:6, <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 564:10).<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This question is discussed in <i>Ta’anit</i> 12a. The reason for the prohibition is that one who goes to sleep takes his mind off of eating, and since these fasts were originally intended to begin at night, as we explained in section 1, if one takes his mind off of eating, it is as if he has accepted the fast. (See Ran 4:1, s.v. “Yerushalmi,” who mentions this rationale with regard to reciting <i>Aneinu</i> at night, even when one fasts only during the day.) Making a stipulation helps, as <i>y. Ta’anit </i>1:4 indicates.<br>With regard to drinking water, since the dispute concerns a rabbinic law, the <i>halakha</i> follows the lenient opinion. Moreover, it seems that Rif agrees with Rosh who rules leniently. <i>Taz</i> 564:2 also concurs. Nonetheless, it is best to stipulate, as MA 564:2 and MB 564:6 state. <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 564:10 cites several Aḥaronim who say that one who has a craving to drink may do so.<br>Tangentially, I would like to point out that even on a regular day, when one may not eat before <i>Shaḥarit</i>, one may eat before dawn and even begin a meal a half-hour before then.

On Yom Kippur, however, when one must fast by Torah law, one may not be lenient in this regard.<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">While it is true that, according to SA 567:3, one may not rinse one’s mouth on a fast day, many Aḥaronim, including MB 567:11, state that it is permitted if not doing so would cause distress. This is even permitted on Tisha Be-Av, in a case of great suffering. We are more spoiled today because of a higher hygienic awareness, and refraining from rinsing one’s mouth in the morning causes most people distress. Therefore, those who suffer may wash their mouths (see below ch. 8 n. 19). Regarding toothpaste, see <i>Berakhot</i> 14a: “One who is fasting may take a taste, without any issue.” Most Rishonim understand that the Gemara is talking about tasting without swallowing, in order to know how the dish tastes, but one may not swallow. There is also debate as to which fast day is at issue. According to Rosh, the Gemara’s statement applies to any communal fast (except Tisha Be-Av), and SA 567:1 rules accordingly. <i>Tosafot</i> maintain that the Sages permitted tasting only on personal fast days, not on communal fasts. Rema writes that it is customary to be stringent and not to taste anything on a fast day. However, MB 567:6 states that one may be more lenient if he is tasting food for the sake of a <i>se’udat mitzva</i>. Certainly, then, one who suffers when he does not brush his teeth with toothpaste may be lenient. Perhaps even Rema would agree with this, because such a person has no intention to taste the toothpaste, only to clean out his mouth. Tisha Be-Av is more stringent, because washing in general is forbidden then, and washing one’s mouth is included in this restriction. Nonetheless, one who is greatly distressed may wash his mouth. However, he may only do so without toothpaste, because even Rosh, who rules leniently on the issue of tasting food on a fast day, forbids tasting on Tisha Be-Av.

On the minor fasts, however, even one who is in great pain – significantly more than other people – is exempt from fasting. This is derived from the law of pregnant and nursing women, who are not considered sick and are thus obligated to fast on Tisha Be-Av and exempt from the minor fasts. Accordingly, AHS 550:1 states that one who is weak should not be stringent and fast on the minor fasts; he must fast only on Tisha Be-Av. <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 550:6, 554:31 concurs. However, many <i>poskim</i> do not make such a distinction, and we can explain their reasoning as follows: the Sages exempt only pregnant and nursing women from the minor fasts because the fetus or baby needs nourishment, but those who are suffering but not actually sick remain obligated.

It is only on Yom Kippur, when fasting is mandated by Torah law that even sick people must fast, that the Sages ruled stringently that those who are dangerously ill and need to eat must do so in quantities smaller than the threshold of punishment, if possible, to avoid breaking the fast.<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Less than the threshold of punishment (<i>paḥot mi-keshi’ur</i>)<i> </i>means drinking less than <i>melo lugmav </i>(a cheekful) and eating less than the bulk of a date (<i>ke-kotevet</i>) within nine minutes.

From the moment a woman knows that she is pregnant, she is exempt from the fast.<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In general, a pregnant woman refers to one who is noticeably pregnant (c. three months pregnant). However, in the present case, the Aḥaronim stated that since a woman is in greater pain and at higher risk of miscarriage specifically during the first few months of pregnancy, a woman who knows with certainty that she is pregnant, based on a test or the like, is exempt from fasting. However, MB 550:3 and SHT <i>ad loc</i>. 2 state that one may rely on this approach and be lenient before the fortieth day of pregnancy only if she is in great pain (as then she is considered sick). In my humble opinion, though, this ruling was based on technology available then, which could not produce certainty of early-stage pregnancy. However, if one knows with certainty that she is pregnant, the danger of miscarriage already exists, and it is clear that her aches are a result of her pregnancy. Therefore, like all pregnant women, she need not fast. <i>Mikra’ei Kodesh</i> (Harari) ch. 1 n. 10 states that R.

Nowadays, the prevalent ruling for Ashkenazic women is to refrain from fasting. See <i>Piskei Teshuvot</i> 550:1, which cites extremely lenient views, stating that all women who might give birth are exempt from these fasts, so that they have strength to give birth. <i>Piskei Teshuvot</i> also cites the view that such women should “redeem” the fast by giving charity.

When there are fewer than six people fasting, the <i>ḥazan</i> should recite <i>Aneinu</i> in <i>Shome’a Tefila</i>, as an individual would.<br>If the <i>ḥazan</i> forgets to recite <i>Aneinu</i> and has not yet said God’s name at the end of <i>Refa’einu</i>, he should go back and recite <i>Aneinu</i> in its proper place. If, however, he has already said God’s name, he should recite <i>Aneinu</i> in <i>Shome’a Tefila</i>, as an individual would. If he forgets to insert it even there, he should recite it, without its conclusion “Blessed are You…Who answers in time of distress,” after “…Who blesses His people Israel with peace,” before he says, “<i>Yiyhu le-ratzon</i>”<i> </i>(“May the words of my mouth…”; MB 119:19). An individual who forgets to recite <i>Aneinu</i> in <i>Shome’a Tefila</i> should insert it in the supplications that follow the <i>Amida</i>.</i>",
                    "During the silent <i>Amida</i>, <i>Aneinu</i> is not recited as a separate <i>berakha</i>, but rather as an insertion in the middle of <i>Shome’a Tefila</i> (<i>Ta’anit</i> 13b). There are various customs regarding when we recite <i>Aneinu</i>. Some say that <i>Aneinu</i> should be recited in all three of the daily prayers; even though we do not fast at night, one should recite it in <i>Ma’ariv</i> because the day as a whole is called a fast day. Yemenite Jews and members of some Sephardic communities follow this custom. Some Sephardic communities have the custom to recite <i>Aneinu</i> only while they are fasting. Therefore, on the minor fasts they recite it in <i>Shaḥarit</i> and <i>Minḥa</i>, and on Tisha Be-Av they recite it in <i>Ma’ariv</i> as well (based on <i>Ha-ma’or</i>, <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 565:17). Ashkenazim customarily recite <i>Aneinu</i> in <i>Minḥa</i> only, out of concern that one may become weak and break his fast after <i>Shaḥarit</i>. Then, his statement “on our fast day” will turn out to be a lie. Therefore, they recite <i>Aneinu</i> only at <i>Minḥa</i>, because one who has fasted this long will probably complete the fast (based on the Ge’onim and Rashi; Rema 565:3). Everyone should follow his family custom.",
                    "One who eats less than a <i>kezayit</i> or drinks less than <i>melo lugmav </i>is considered to still be fasting and should recite <i>Aneinu</i>. But if one ate or drank more than that, he has broken his fast and may not recite <i>Aneinu</i>.<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are varying opinions on this issue, and MB 568:3 states, based on <i>Nehar Shalom</i>, that one should recite <i>Aneinu</i>. In BHL 565:1, however, he cites <i>Ma’amar Mordechai</i>’s opinion that one who eats on a fast day should not recite <i>Aneinu</i> at all. <i>Shevet Ha-Levi</i> 5:60 reconciles this contradiction by explaining that one who is exempt from fasting should not recite <i>Aneinu</i>, whereas one who ate accidentally should recite it, because the fast applies to him. In my humble opinion, however, in light of the Ashkenazic custom not to recite <i>Aneinu</i> in <i>Shaḥarit</i> because one might not fast the entire day, we can clearly infer that one who has already eaten should not recite it. Many Sephardim have adopted this custom. Even one who merely intends to eat, but has not yet done so, should not recite <i>Aneinu</i> (SA 562:1; see MB <i>ad loc</i>. 6).<br>It is also unclear how much one needs to eat in order to be viewed as no longer fasting. Regarding Yom Kippur, the Sages say that eating a date’s bulk of food within the time it takes to eat half a loaf of bread, or drinking <i>melo lugmav</i> of fluid, is enough to eliminate the pangs of fasting. However, SA 568:1 states that one who eats a <i>kezayit</i> of food in the time it takes to eat half a loaf of bread has broken his fast, as a <i>kezayit</i> is the standard measure for all eating-related laws. See <i>Piskei Teshuvot</i> 568:1, which explains that the Aḥaronim debate the matter. Since there is uncertainty regarding this issue, it is better to be passive and not recite <i>Aneinu</i> if one ate a <i>kezayit</i> of food.</i> (Nonetheless, he must continue fasting, as mentioned above, section 6.)"

On fast days that have a <i>Ne’ila</i> service, like Yom Kippur and the fasts that the Sages instituted for droughts, the Kohanim bless the people at <i>Ne’ila</i>, because there is no reason to be concerned that they will be drunk, as it is a fast day. During <i>Minḥa</i> of those days, however, the Kohanim do not bless the people, out of concern that they may mistakenly think that they may do so on regular days as well. On ordinary fast days, when we do not pray <i>Ne’ila</i>, the law depends on when the congregants pray <i>Minḥa</i>. If a congregation that recites <i>Birkat Kohanim </i>prays <i>Minḥa </i>at the same time that <i>Ne’ila</i> would take place, i.e., shortly before <i>shki’a</i>, the Kohanim bless the people (cf. <i>Ta’anit</i> 26b; SA 129:1). But if the congregation prays <i>Minḥa</i> earlier, <i>Birkat Kohanim</i> is omitted, since it is not the time designated for <i>Ne’ila</i>.

Ideally, one should pray <i>Minḥa</i> within half an hour of <i>shki’a</i>, which is the best time to pray <i>Ne’ila</i>. Nevertheless, as long as the congregation prays after <i>plag ha-minḥa </i>(one and a quarter seasonal hours before the end of the day; see n. 16), the Kohanim may bless the people.

The latter opinion goes as far as to say that he should perform it even if there is one other Kohen (<i>Lu’aḥ Eretz Yisrael</i>; <i>Halikhot Shlomo</i>, <i>Tefila</i> 10:13). If there are fewer than six people fasting, no Kohen should perform the blessing at <i>Minḥa</i>, even one who is fasting (see <i>Piskei Teshuvot</i> 129:2).<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to <i>Ginat Veradim</i>, a Kohen who is not fasting may nonetheless perform <i>Birkat Kohanim </i>at <i>Minḥa</i> of a fast day in congregations that recite <i>Birkat Kohanim</i>, because there is no concern that he will perform the blessing while drunk on a fast day. All other <i>poskim</i> disagree. According to <i>Ḥazon Ish</i>, OḤ 20, Kohanim may perform the mitzva even when praying an early <i>Minḥa</i>, as there is no concern that they will be drunk. However, most <i>poskim</i> maintain that <i>Birkat Kohanim</i> is recited only when praying <i>Minḥa</i> at the time of <i>Ne’ila</i>, which is close to <i>shki’a</i>. <i>Rav Pe’alim</i> OḤ 5, <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 129:7, <i>Lu’aḥ Eretz Yisrael</i> (by R.

The basis for this opinion is the fact that the Kohanim do not bless the people at <i>Minḥa</i> of Yom Kippur, as the Sages were concerned that they might mistakenly do so on a regular day. The reason they were concerned is that <i>Minḥa</i> can be prayed on Yom Kippur at the same time we pray <i>Minḥa</i> on a regular day. Furthermore, the earliest time for <i>Minḥa</i> is close to midday, which is when people eat lunch and are liable to drink wine, as opposed to <i>Ne’ila</i>, which is said at the end of the day. Therefore, on a day that has no <i>Ne’ila</i> service, the Kohanim bless the people during <i>Minḥa</i> in congregations that recite <i>Birkat Kohanim</i> only if it is said at the time of <i>Ne’ila</i>. Nonetheless, everyone agrees that if the Kohanim ascended the platform to perform the mitzva during a <i>Minḥa</i> service that is being held before <i>plag ha-minḥa</i>, they may continue.

For our purposes here, we calculate <i>plag</i> from <i>shki’a</i>, as explained there, ch. 20, n. 3. <i>Le-khatḥila</i>, it is best to schedule <i>Minḥa</i> such that the congregation will recite the <i>Amida </i>half an hour before <i>shki’a</i>, as this is the proper time, <i>le-khatḥila</i>, for <i>Ne’ila</i>.<br><i>Be-di’avad</i>,<i> </i>if the <i>ḥazan</i>’s repetition of the <i>Amida</i> extends past <i>shki’a</i>, the Kohanim may perform the mitzva up until <i>tzeit ha-kokhavim</i>, as there is a combination of uncertainties here: 1) According to Raavya, <i>Yere’im</i>, and <i>Or Zaru’a</i>, Kohanim may perform the blessing at night; 2) the status of <i>bein ha-shmashot</i> is uncertain, and it may be considered daytime; 3) according to Rabbeinu Tam, the period following <i>shki’a</i> is definitely daytime.

This period is often known as <i>Bein Ha-metzarim</i>,<i> </i>recalling the verse, “All her pursuers overtook her in the narrow places (<i>bein ha-metzarim</i>)” (Eikha 1:3). Therefore, the Sages recommended that we take extra precautions on these days, which are prone to calamity. For example, even though one must always be careful and vigilant, those who go on a hike or swim in the sea must be even more careful during this period (see <i>Eikha Rabba</i> 1:29).",

Therefore, it is up to the Jewish people to decide whether or not they want to fast, and they have decided to fast only from daybreak. However, the Three Weeks begin on the night of 17 Tamuz. Ḥida writes in this vein in <i>Responsa Ḥayim Sha’al</i> 1:24, based on Ramban. R.

Thus, it is not prohibited to listen to them during the Three Weeks.",
                    "Furthermore, a distinction can be made between happy songs and regular songs. It is only fitting to prohibit happy songs during the Three Weeks, whereas regular tunes, and certainly sad ones, should not be prohibited. Similarly, the Gemara (<i>Shabbat</i> 151a) teaches that the custom was to play flutes at a funeral in order to arouse people to cry out in anguish over the deceased, and this was part of the mitzva of accompanying the deceased to his final resting place (<i>levayat ha-met</i>). This shows that there is no sweeping prohibition against hearing instrumental music. Rather, one may not listen to happy tunes during times of mourning. I heard from my father and teacher that not only may one play sad instrumental songs related to the destruction of the Temple on the radio during the Nine Days, but it is actually good to do so, because it inspires people to mourn the destruction even more.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Among those who prohibit listening to music on the radio are: <i>Igrot Moshe</i>, YD 2:137 and OḤ 1:166, which tends toward stringency with respect to listening to instrumental music at all times nowadays; <i>Yeḥaveh Da’at</i> 6:34 permits listening to instrumental music in general but forbids listening to them on the radio and the like during the <i>omer</i> period and the Three Weeks. (In private conversation, however, he allowed Israeli radio station <i>Arutz Sheva</i> to play music during these periods, to avoid causing them to cancel their Torah-oriented segments.) <i>Tzitz Eliezer</i> 15:33 even forbids listening to non-instrumental music on the radio during these mournful periods. However, the rationale of those who rule leniently is strong, especially since the entire custom of refraining from listening to instrumental music and dancing during these times is first mentioned in the works of the Aḥaronim; it is not an ancient institution. Similarly, <i>Responsa Ḥelkat Yaakov</i> 1:62 concludes that listening to music on an electronic device is not included in the decree (or the custom of mourning) because these devices did not exist when the decree was first enacted. It seems, then, that the prohibition depends on whether or not the music is joyous. We can also derive this from the fact that the Aḥaronim permit attending music lessons during these periods because such music is not joyous. Clearly, then, it all depends on whether the music is joyous. Maharam Schick, YD 368, distinguishes between joyous music and sad music, ruling that sad music is not forbidden during times of mourning. This can also be inferred from the wording of Rambam in Laws of Fasts 5:14, where he discusses the prohibition of playing music after the destruction of the Temple: “Similarly, they ordained that one should not play melodies with any sort of musical instrument. It is forbidden to celebrate with such instruments or to listen to them being played, [as an expression of mourning] for the destruction [of the Temple].” According to this, it appears that the prohibition relates mainly to listening to joyous music, which is associated with dancing, while regular songs, and certainly sad ones, are permissible. Some people do not make any distinction between joyous songs and sad songs. These people take care, on the one hand, not to hear or play musical instruments during the Three Weeks or the <i>omer </i>period, but on the other hand will play joyous non-instrumental songs. They are mistaken, however, as one should be more stringent about hearing happy songs, even without instrumental accompaniment, than about hearing sad songs with instrumental accompaniment, concerning which one may rely on the lenient opinion. See R. Shmuel David’s article in<i> Teḥumin</i> 13. Also see above 3:10.<br>Even according to the more stringent opinion, one who is listening to a radio talk show that occasionally plays musical selections is not obligated to turn the radio off. However, one who takes care to turn it off when the music comes on should be commended (<i>Hilkhot Ḥagim</i> 25:9).<br>It seems that even according to the more stringent <i>poskim</i>, one may be lenient on Friday afternoon and Saturday night, because the sanctity and joy of Shabbat extends to these times. Indeed, we do not say <i>Taḥanun</i> on Friday afternoons, and we continue to wear Shabbat clothing on <i>Motza’ei</i> <i>Shabbat</i>.</i>"

                    "“When Av arrives, we curtail our joy” (<i>Ta’anit </i>26b). Therefore, one must refrain from outings and recreational activities that are mainly designed to provide pleasure and joy. However, one may go on a trip or vacation that is designed primarily for educational or therapeutic purposes during the Nine Days. The same goes for swimming, whether in the sea or in a pool: If the purpose is leisure, it is forbidden. However, if one’s doctor instructs him to swim for health reasons, he may do so even during the Nine Days.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yesod Ve-shoresh Ha-avoda</i> states that it is proper to avoid enjoying oneself during the Three Weeks. R. Ḥayim Palachi writes (in <i>Masa Ḥayim</i>) that the rabbis of his city (Izmir) instituted a prohibition against strolling through the orchards, on the beach, or along the banks of the river during the Three Weeks (quoted in <i>Sdei Ḥemed</i>, <i>Ma’arekhet Bein Ha-metzarim</i> 1:10). The other Aḥaronim, however, did not cite this stringency. It is mentioned only in contemporary works (<i>Am Ke-lavi</i>, p. 170; <i>Nit’ei Gavriel</i> 23:3, as a secondary opinion; <i>Mikra’ei Kodesh</i> [Harari], 5:1). It appears that this is a pious custom, which is why most Aḥaronim do not cite it. In practice, the <i>halakha </i>dictates that one must curtail pleasurable, joyous activities only during the Nine Days. We find the same idea with regard to consuming meat and wine and engaging in joyous business transactions: They are forbidden only from the first of Av. Similarly, there is no reason to prohibit hiking because it is dangerous. The very obligation to avoid danger is a Torah command; while we are exceptionally cautious during these days, this does not mean that we create an entirely new system of safety rules.<br>The same applies to swimming in the sea or a river. It is similar to hiking both in terms of the pleasure derived and the danger involved. There is a <i>posek</i> who is stringent about this (<i>Mekor Ḥayim</i> by the author of <i>Ḥavot Ya’ir</i>, 551:4), but many authorities permit it, as we find in <i>Terumat Ha-deshen</i> §150, which states that people used to bathe in rivers during the Nine Days, and no one protested. <i>Shulḥan Gavo’ah</i> §551 writes that the custom in Thessaloniki was to swim in the sea even on the day before Tisha Be-Av. Likewise, <i>Yeḥaveh Da’at</i> 1:38 states that one may swim in a pool or in the sea even during the week of Tisha Be-Av. It seems more proper to be stringent regarding swimming for pleasure during the Nine Days, not because swimming is inherently problematic, but because we must curtail our joy, as we will explain below. Nevertheless, we can derive from the opinions quoted above, based on a <i>kal va-ḥomer</i> argument, that swimming and hiking are permissible during the Three Weeks.<br>However, it is preferable, <i>le-khatḥila</i>, to avoid going with a large group on an outing and to refrain from scheduling a summer camp during the Three Weeks. These activities are exceptionally joyous, as they are somewhat similar to dances. Nevertheless, <i>be-di’avad</i>, if it is very difficult to schedule the outing or the summer camp for a different time, one may participate in these activities until the first of Av, since these activities are not really similar to dances, whose main purpose is merrymaking. Rather, the goal of an outing is to acquaint the participants with a new place and to allow them to enjoy the social setting. Indeed, it would be proper to change the scholastic calendar such that schools would be in session during the Three Weeks. This way, fewer people would go on outings or go swimming during this period. As things stand today, however, the Three Weeks is when summer camps operate and the yearly vacation takes place. Therefore, one should not be stringent beyond the demands of the law and forbid outings or swimming before the first of Av. Regarding swimming daily for exercise, which is not considered recreational, but part of a healthy lifestyle, see below, section 21, where we explain that according to Sephardic custom it is proper to be stringent in this regard during the week of Tisha Be-Av, and according to Ashkenazic custom, from the first of Av. (See <i>Rav Pe’alim</i> 4:29, which states that even though one who begins swimming lessons before the Three Weeks should be stringent during the Nine Days, one should not rebuke him if he acts leniently and continues his lessons during the Nine Days and the week of Tisha Be-Av. It is written in the name of Ḥazon Ish that one may swim during the Nine Days for health reasons.)</i>"

Even though some of the greatest <i>poskim</i> felt that one does not need to follow this stricture (<i>Taz</i>, Vilna Gaon), over time it became customary to be stringent and avoid reciting <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> during the Three Weeks.

For example, one may buy socks or undershirts, because these items of clothing are not significant enough to warrant the recitation of <i>She-heḥeyanu</i>. One may also purchase shoes if it is not his custom to recite <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> over them (SA and Rema 223:6; also see <i>Peninei Halakha: Berakhot </i>ch. 17 n. 4). Similarly, a couple may buy a piece of furniture, because, as partners in the purchase, they recite the <i>berakha </i>of <i>Ha-tov Ve-hametiv </i>rather than <i>She-heḥeyanu</i>. An individual, on the other hand, must refrain from buying furniture to avoid reciting <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> (SA 223:5; <i>Peninei Halakha: Berakhot </i>17:3).",
                    "Until the end of Tamuz, one may also buy a fancy garment that requires alterations, to be worn after Tisha Be-Av. Since it cannot be worn at the time when it is purchased, one does not recite <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> at that time (MB 223:17). Furthermore, according to those who customarily recite <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> only when they first wear the clothing (which is the prevalent custom), one may buy a new garment during the Three Weeks, on the condition that he wears it and recites the <i>berakha</i> after Tisha Be-Av. Once Av begins, we minimize our business dealings, and so it is proper to avoid such a purchase even if one will not recite <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> at the time of purchase (see below, section 18)."

                    "Similarly, one who sees a close friend after not seeing him for thirty days, and is happy to see him, should recite <i>She-heḥeyanu</i>, since if he does not recite it immediately, he loses the opportunity to recite the <i>berakha</i>. Likewise, one who sees his newborn daughter for the first time should recite <i>She-heḥeyanu</i>, since if he does not do so immediately, he loses the opportunity to recite the <i>berakha</i> (based on SA 225:1, MB 223:2).",

Therefore, one who gets a new fruit during the week should postpone eating it until Shabbat, and then recite <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> over the fruit. If he cannot postpone eating it – for example, if he has no access to a refrigerator, and the fruit might spoil before Shabbat – he should eat it immediately and recite <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> (Rema 551:17, MB 551:98). With regard to a new article of clothing, one may likewise recite <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> on the <i>Shabbatot</i> before the first of Av.

Technically, the prohibition applies only to an “optional” wedding, i.e., that of a man who has already fulfilled the mitzva of procreation by fathering a son and a daughter; one who has yet to fulfill this mitzva may get married even during the Nine Days. Nevertheless, it is customary not to schedule any weddings during this period, because it is an inauspicious time. Weddings should take place in times of good omens and good fortune, and this period is not one of good omen or good fortune. Some Sephardim do not hold weddings only during the Nine Days (see n. 5).",

Since such a party is a celebration of the couple’s agreement to get married, the event contains a mitzva component and is thus permitted (see above ch. 3 n. 7, regarding whether one may play music at such an event). One may not, however, hold a large-scale engagement party during the Three Weeks. During the Nine Days, when we must curtail our joy, one may not hold even a modest, small-scale party. However, the parents of the couple may meet, even during the Nine Days, in order to decide on the details of the wedding, and refreshments may be served at this meeting. Even though this, too, involves joy, it is permissible because such a meeting transforms the couple’s relationship into an accomplished fact, which brings them closer to the mitzva of marriage. It is also permissible for singles to date for the sake of marriage during the Nine Days.<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Beit Yosef</i> and MB 551:14 explain that even marriages that fulfill a mitzva are prohibited during this period, because the time is inauspicious. Vilna Gaon 551:69 adds a novel idea, explaining that even from the standpoint of mourning the destruction of the Temple, one should refrain from getting married during this period. As the Talmud (BB 60b) states, if it were possible, it would be proper to avoid marriage altogether following the destruction of the Temple. Though we are unable to do this, it is proper to refrain from getting married at least during the Three Weeks.<br><b>The Sephardic custom</b>: Yemenite Jews do not get married starting from the seventeenth of Tamuz. <i>Knesset Ha-gedola</i> (whose author was from Turkey) was stringent, ruling that one may not even get engaged during the Three Weeks, and indeed, Moroccan Jews follow this custom. <i>Ben Ish Ḥai</i>, Year 1, Devarim 4 forbids weddings and states that it is proper to be stringent regarding engagements as well, in accordance with the ruling of <i>Knesset Ha-gedola</i>. <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 551:44 also cites this position.

This implies that those who shave regularly may shave in honor of Shabbat. <i>Pri Megadim</i>, <i>Eshel Avraham</i> 551:14 similarly states that one may cut one’s hair for the sake of Shabbat before the first of Av. While <i>Mateh Yehuda</i> 551:4 rules stringently, <i>Pri Megadim</i>’s opinion seems more correct in the case of shaving, because one who refrains from shaving looks unsightly on Shabbat. See also BHL 551:3, which states that the Yerushalmi indicates that one may cut one’s hair in honor of Shabbat even during the Nine Days. R. Akiva Eger concurs. Another reason to be lenient is that those who shave regularly generally feel great distress when they go several days without shaving. Perhaps this is similar to cutting mustache hairs that interfere with eating, or applying ointment on Tisha Be-Av, which is permitted for one who suffers from head sores (SA 554:15). It also coincides with the ruling that I heard, that one may cut hairs that cause sores or headaches. In <i>Nefesh Ha-Rav</i>, R. Hershel Schachter writes in the name of R. Yosef Dov Soloveitchik that the Three Weeks have the same status as the year-long mourning period for a deceased parent, during which shaving is permissible; the customs of the Nine Days are like those of the <i>shloshim</i> period over the death of a close relative, when shaving is prohibited; and Tisha Be-Av is equivalent to <i>shiva</i>. Based on this, he permits shaving every day, until the first of Av, because not doing so makes one look disgraceful. See <i>Tzohar</i>, vol. 3, p. 39, where R. Soloveitchik’s opinion is challenged, but these challenges can be rejected. Also see <i>Responsa Ner Ezra</i>, vol. 2, pp. 155-158, which concludes that one may shave before Shabbat, stating that this is the opinion of R. Shlomo Min-Hahar and R. Aharon Lichtenstein.<br>However, many <i>poskim</i> rule stringently, forbidding shaving altogether. So states <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 551:66. <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim </i>493:19 quotes Aḥaronim who state that one may shave if refraining from shaving will cause a loss of income. Most people who observe the <i>mitzvot</i> meticulously follow this viewpoint. <i>Igrot Moshe</i>, OḤ 4:102 also only allows shaving in order to avoid monetary loss.<br>In my humble opinion, it seems that technically, it is proper even for those who follow Ashkenazic custom to shave every Friday, until the first of Av. On other days of the week, however, it is preferable to be stringent. Nevertheless, one who is lenient has an opinion to rely on. One may be lenient to maintain his livelihood as well. Starting from the first of Av, it is proper to be stringent, both throughout the week and on Friday. Even though one could argue that it is imperative to shave in honor of Shabbat – as the Yerushalmi and R. Akiva Eger imply, as cited in BHL 551:3 – nevertheless, we find in the writings of the Rishonim (<i>Kol Bo</i>, cited in <i>Beit Yosef</i> 551:4) that it is customary to refrain from shaving before Shabbat Ḥazon, so that we enter Tisha Be-Av as mourners. We also find that the prevalent Ashkenazic custom was to refrain from wearing Shabbat clothes on Shabbat Ḥazon, as Rema 551:2 states. Even though we do not follow this custom, we can still learn from it that according to Ashkenazic practice, one need not be so meticulous about the honor of Shabbat Ḥazon. Therefore, during the Nine Days, it is better to refrain from shaving before Shabbat. In my humble opinion, it is proper to recommend to Sephardim that they, too, refrain from shaving during the Nine Days. Firstly, this is the law for those who forbid haircuts throughout the Three Weeks (Jews from Morocco and Djerba, and those who follow Arizal’s customs; Tunisian and Algerian Jews avoid haircuts starting from the first of Av). In addition, we find that this was the Sephardic custom, as cited in <i>Kol Bo</i> (by R. Aharon of Lunel, which is in Provence), that one must enter Tisha Be-Av in a disgraceful state. Today, the most prevalent sign of mourning is being unshaven, and, conversely, shaving is a tangible expression that one is not mourning. Therefore, it is proper to display this sign of mourning during the Nine Days and on Tisha Be-Av. Furthermore, it is proper to minimize discord, when possible. Accordingly, several contemporary authors write that Sephardim studying in Ashkenazic yeshivot should adopt Ashkenazic stringencies (<i>Yeḥaveh Da’at</i> 4:36). Even though today’s <i>yeshivot</i> in our communities are not Ashkenazic or Sephardic <i>per se</i>, but are open to students of all backgrounds, it is preferable, when possible, to minimize variation of customs. Therefore, when it comes to shaving for Shabbat before the first of Av, it is preferable to follow the custom of most Sephardim, who shave during the Three Weeks. During the Nine Days, however, it is better to follow the custom of Ashkenazim and some Sephardim, who do not shave. Nonetheless, one should not rebuke one who wants to rely on the logic found in BHL and follow the custom of the Sephardim who shave in anticipation of Shabbat Ḥazon. During the week of Tisha Be-Av, however, everyone agrees that one may not shave.<br>Practically speaking, I heard proper guidance from R. Naḥum Rabinovitch, the <i>rosh yeshiva </i>of Yeshivat Birkat Moshe in Ma’aleh Adumim. He suggests that everyone follow his own father’s custom, to avoid a situation in which a father is shaven during the Three Weeks and his son is not, or vice versa, as this could be an affront to the father’s honor. I would add that if the father follows the more stringent custom, there is reason to be concerned that if his son shaves, people will think that he is doing so for reasons of convenience, and not for the sake of Shabbat, which will result in an affront to God’s honor. Furthermore, one should not ignore the fact that one who refrains from shaving for three weeks demonstrates that observing Jewish customs is very important to him, and by doing so he sanctifies God’s name.

Under such circumstances, the Sages permitted engaging in transactions, just as they permitted building a wall that brings joy, if there is concern that not doing so will result in damage (MB 551:13). This is why I wrote that merchants may continue their business dealings as usual, even if they deal in luxury items, because they are liable to sustain a loss if they stop working. Several Aḥaronim follow this position as well; see SHT <i>ad loc. </i>13. (These merchants are not helping others commit a transgression, because it may be that their customers are buying for the sake of a mitzva and cannot postpone their purchase. And even for those who are violating a prohibition by buying, since they can make their purchase elsewhere, some say that the prohibition of <i>lifnei iver</i> – putting a “stumbling block in front of the blind” [Vayikra 19:14] – does not apply to rabbinic commandments.)<br>If postponing the purchase of furniture and clothing for a wedding would cause the wedding to be delayed, one may purchase these items during the Nine Days, because doing so is for the sake of the mitzva of marriage. This is allowed only if the groom has not yet fulfilled the mitzva of procreation (Rema 551:2, MB 551:14). Nowadays, however, postponing these purchases does not delay the wedding, because people book a wedding hall and send out invitations months in advance, and it is possible to buy everything before or after the Nine Days. Either way, no one would cancel a wedding on account of these purchases. Only in rare cases, when the families are under great pressure, may they buy clothing, as <i>poskim</i> typically permit many things in situations of great need.

One should refrain from arranging these books on one’s shelves upon buying them until Shabbat, at which point one should begin learning from them and should then recite <i>She-heḥeyanu </i>(above, section 8).

Many Iberian Jews were stringent as well, and would refrain from washing in hot water during the week of Tisha Be-Av. The Ashkenazic custom, on the other hand, was to refrain from bathing completely during the Nine Days, even in cold water. They would only rinse in cold water in preparation for Shabbat Ḥazon (SA 551:16, MB <i>ad loc</i>., <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim ad loc.</i> 186).",

Because of this, people barely suffered when they refrained from bathing. Nowadays, though, when people shower regularly, this has become a routine practice. Many people shower daily, with soap, and would suffer if they were to go even a single day without showering. Some even have difficulty falling asleep as a result.",

MB <i>ad loc. </i>2 infers from this language that one who sweats profusely may wash himself in order to remove the sweat, because such washing is not for pleasure. In the end, though, MB permits this only for an <i>istenis</i> (a delicate and sensitive person). However, if the <i>poskim</i> permit this on Yom Kippur, which is ordained by Torah law – and several Rishonim maintain that even the prohibition on washing is a Torah prohibition – one may certainly be lenient during the Nine Days, when the prohibition on washing is less stringent and is based on the custom of the Rishonim.<br>Today, almost everyone is considered an <i>istenis</i> with regard to foul odors, since we have sinks and faucets for washing, as well as sewage pipes that remove excrement and urine. In the past, foul odors were commonplace, as sewage would flow in canals in between the houses, or it was buried near villages. It is evident that all <i>halakhot </i>relating to foul odors are determined based on what is accepted in the current setting. Therefore, we are more stringent nowadays with regard to allowing prayer in the presence of foul odor (see <i>Peninei Halakha</i>: <i>Prayer</i> 3:10). In addition, our bathing habits have changed completely, as we shower much more frequently than in the past. Everyone is considered an <i>istenis</i> in this area, and thus we may shower for the sake of cleanliness. The only qualification is that one should use lukewarm water, so as not to derive pleasure from washing. One should not be stringent and wash exclusively in cold water, because most people are used to showering in hot water, and thus using cold water would cause them great pain. Therefore, one should use water that causes neither suffering nor pleasure. It is also worth noting that the difference between the Ashkenazic and Sephardic customs apparently stems from the difference in climate in the regions where each of these groups lived. There is a greater need to bathe frequently in the hotter, southern lands than there is in the colder, northern lands. Moreover, the conventional wisdom among the non-Jews in Europe at the time was that bathing is detrimental to one’s health, and thus they would bathe only once every few months. The Jews who lived there were also influenced by this viewpoint to some degree. Therefore, they acted stringently during the Three Weeks. Today, however, especially in Eretz Yisrael, people suffer greatly from not washing, and the custom, therefore, is to be lenient.</i>",

According to Ashkenazic custom, however, several customs of mourning begin on Rosh Ḥodesh Av, making Shabbat Ḥazon part of the mourning period. Therefore, many of the European ancestors of Ashkenazim had the custom not to bathe in hot water before Shabbat Ḥazon or wear fancy Shabbat clothing on that Shabbat, as Rema writes (551:1, 16). Several great Ashkenazic sages, however, disagree with this custom, because one may not exhibit signs of mourning on Shabbat. Today, the prevalent custom among Ashkenazic Jews is to shower in lukewarm water, with soap and shampoo, in anticipation of Shabbat Ḥazon, and to wear laundered Shabbat clothing.

These fasts were modeled on Yom Kippur, which lasts an entire day and contains five prohibitions. When the Second Temple was built, these fasts were annulled, becoming joyous holidays. And when the Second Temple was destroyed, the four fasts reverted to their original status.",
                    "After the period of harsh decrees ended and a new era began, in which the Temple was still in ruins but evil decrees no longer plagued us, the Sages determined that the status of three of the fasts – Asara Be-Tevet, Shiv’a Asar Be-Tamuz, and Tzom Gedalia – depended on the will of the Jewish people: “If they want, they fast; if they do not want, they do not fast.”",
                    "On Tisha Be-Av, however, we must fast under all circumstances, because many tragedies befell the Jewish people on that day, including the destruction of both Temples. Even when we live in a tranquil time, its status is not dependent on Israel’s will. Rather, as long as the Temple sits in ruins, we must fast on that day, as the prophets enacted (RH 18b).",
                    "This is the basis for the difference between Tisha Be-Av and the minor fasts. Our obligation to fast on Tisha Be-Av is based on an institution of the prophets, so all the laws of the fast apply in their entirety. On the minor fasts, however, our obligation is based on custom, since all of Israel agreed to fast on these days until the Temple is rebuilt. Thus, from the very outset, the accepted custom has been to treat them more leniently than Tisha Be-Av (as explained above, 7:1).<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above 7:1-2 and n. 1, where it is explained that “peace” means that the Temple stands; only then will Tisha Be-Av be annulled. The statement that the obligation to fast on Tisha Be-Av does not depend on Israel’s will is stated by Ramban in <i>Torat Ha-adam</i>, p. 244. This is also the opinion of Rashi, <i>Eshkol</i>, <i>Itur</i>, <i>Smak</i>, <i>Magid Mishneh</i>, and others. However, some – including Rashba and Ritva – maintain that in an intermediate situation, when the Temple is destroyed but evil decrees have ceased, we are exempt from fasting even on Tisha Be-Av, but the Jewish people decided to observe Tisha Be-Av as a full fast, in accordance with the original enactment, because of the numerous tragedies that occurred on that day. Nonetheless, the accepted practice follows the majority of Rishonim and Aḥaronim, who maintain that the fast of Tisha Be-Av is not dependent on anyone’s will.

Only on Yom Kippur, which is mandated by Torah law and which even sick people must observe, must one eat less than the <i>shi’ur</i>, when possible, to avoid breaking the fast. On rabbinically instituted fasts, however, sick people are completely exempt; therefore, they need not eat small quantities or fast for a few hours.

Similarly, MB 554:14 states in the name of <i>Eliya Rabba</i> that a postpartum woman should preferably fast for a few hours, if possible. <i>Ḥatam Sofer</i> OḤ 157 concurs, saying that if a sick person can suffice with just drinking, he should not eat, and if eating once will satisfy his needs, he should not eat twice.

Although the general rule is that sick people do not need to eat portions that are smaller than the <i>shi’ur</i>. So states AHS 554:7.

It seems that if the uncertainty stems from the person’s weakness – i.e., that it is likely that he will become truly sick over the course of the fast, as in the case of a pregnant woman who feels weak – it is proper to instruct him to begin eating and drinking less than the <i>shi’ur</i> in the morning, in accordance with the ruling of BHL.

Similarly, if a woman is concerned that fasting might cause her milk supply to become completely depleted, rendering her unable to breastfeed her baby, she should not fast. <i>Torat Ha-yoledet</i> 48:4 writes that such a woman should drink quantities smaller than a <i>shi’ur</i> because she is not really sick; the only reason she needs to drink is for her baby.</i> The best advice for most women whose milk supply decreases is to skip two feedings in alternating fashion. That is, a woman who nurses every three hours should breastfeed her baby at 10 AM, give him something else at 1 PM, breastfeed again at 4 PM, and give him a something else again at 7 PM.

On Tisha Be-Av, however, the prohibition is a function of the laws of mourning. Therefore, only anointing for the sake of pleasure is prohibited, while anointing in order to remove filth is permissible.

According to many other <i>poskim</i>, however, there is no prohibition against smoking, from the perspective of the fast day, especially for one who needs to smoke to relieve agitation. MB 555:8 permits smoking after midday, in private, for one who needs it. Many others permit smoking even before midday, in private, for one who needs it. These <i>poskim</i> are cited in <i>Yabi’a Omer</i> 1:33. <i>Hilkhot Ḥag Be-ḥag</i> ch. 7 n. 87 states that those who prohibit smoking are not referring to cigarettes, but to a type of smoking that entails more pleasure and involvement. It is by now clear that smoking is detrimental to one’s health, and it is a mitzva for one who is accustomed to smoking to make every effort to quit. Nevertheless, if one is already addicted to smoking, one may smoke on a fast day in order to relieve the pain of fasting.</i>"

In the past, high-quality shoes were commonly made from leather, since people did not know how to make strong, flexible, and durable shoes from other materials. There is a dispute among the <i>poskim </i>about the status of non-leather shoes. Some Rishonim were stringent and ruled that one may not wear such shoes on Tisha Be-Av if they actually protect the foot from the ground (Rashi, Rambam, <i>Tosafot</i>, Rabbeinu Yeruḥam). Other Rishonim permitted wearing such shoes on Tisha Be-Av even if they protect one’s feet from the rough ground (Ramban, Rosh, Rashba). Most of the Aḥaronim ruled in accordance with the latter Rishonim in practice (SA 614:2).",

Today, however, when manufacturers commonly produce high-quality non-leather shoes, one may not wear shoes of any material on Tisha Be-Av if it is a kind of shoe that people would wear year-round to walk on rocky ground. In the previous generation, when it was still uncommon to find high-quality shoes made from different materials, some <i>poskim </i>permitted wearing such shoes on Tisha Be-Av. However, as time goes by and excellent shoes made from different materials become increasingly common, fewer and fewer <i>poskim</i> permit wearing such shoes on Yom Kippur.",
                    "Therefore, any shoe that people can wear outdoors on rocky ground may not be worn on Tisha Be-Av, no matter what the material of the shoe is. Thus, footwear such as “Crocs,” “Keds,” and “Converse All-stars” may not be worn on Tisha Be-Av. However, one may wear cloth slippers or very thin rubber shoes, since people generally would not wear these shoes when walking on rocky ground as one can feel the roughness of the ground when wearing them. Nonetheless, since there are still <i>poskim</i> who are lenient regarding non-leather shoes, one should not rebuke those who wish to rely on this opinion. (See <i>Ohalah shel Torah</i> 2:81; <i>Hilkhot Ḥag Be-ḥag </i>22:25 [in the name of R. Yosef Shalom Elyashiv]; this topic is explained in detail in <i>Peninei Halakha: Days of Awe</i> 8:5).",

Likewise, one who is walking in a muddy place may wear his regular shoes in order to avoid soiling his feet. A soldier on active duty may wear army boots (SA 554:17, 614:3-4). The reason for all these leniencies is that wearing shoes is prohibited on Tisha Be-Av only if one wears them for the sake of comfortable walking. When there is different reason for wearing them, however, the prohibition does not apply. If one requires orthotic shoe inserts and suffers without them, one may insert them into a slipper or thin rubber shoe that people generally would not wear throughout the year. This is permitted because one is not using these inserts for the sake of comfortable walking but in order to relieve his suffering. In addition, since the insert is not attached to the shoe, it can be claimed that it is not part of the shoe (<i>Ḥelkat Yaakov </i>2:83; <i>Shemirat Shabbat Ke-hilkhatah</i> 39:37)."

Another reason one may not study Torah during a period of mourning is that Torah study makes one happy, as it says, “The precepts of the Lord are just, gladdening the heart” (Tehilim 19:9). One may not even think thoughts of Torah, because even that makes one happy. However, it is a mitzva to study sad sections of the Torah, which deal with the calamities that befell Israel and the afflictions that man encounters, as these sections are appropriate for the mood of the day. One should not study even these sections in depth, because such study makes one happy. However, if one thinks of a novel idea while studying a matter superficially, he does not need to worry, because that is the nature of learning (AHS 554:4).

In addition, unfortunately, this language can still apply to the Temple Mount. Furthermore, compared to what Jerusalem should be – the capital of the world, “perfect in beauty, joy of all the earth” (Eikha 2:15) – it is indeed considered destroyed and desolate.<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One who forgets to recite <i>Naḥem</i> in its proper place should recite it in the <i>berakha</i> of <i>Avoda</i>, which relates to the Temple service (BHL §557).

This is similar to the <i>halakha</i> that a Kohen who is in mourning does not recite <i>Birkat Kohanim</i>, because he is forlorn and therefore unable to bless the congregants with peace. Most Ashkenazim and some Sephardim follow this custom. In other communities where <i>Birkat Kohanim </i>is generally recited, the Kohanim do recite it at <i>Shaḥarit</i> on Tisha Be-Av; this is the custom of the kabbalists of Jerusalem.

Using a play on words, the Sages interpret the phrase <i>bitza emrato </i>to mean that God, as it were, tore His garment. This expresses the depths to which we have sunk since the Temple was destroyed (Rema 559:2). We return the curtain to its proper place before <i>Minḥa</i> (<i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 559:19).

Each community should continue following its custom.<sup>20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to Raavad, one should not wear <i>tefilin</i> on Tisha Be-Av, just like a mourner does not wear <i>tefilin</i> on his first day of mourning. Others maintain that although there is no obligation to wear <i>tefilin</i> on Tisha Be-Av, there is also no prohibition to do so. Me’iri quotes this in the name of “a few sages,” and <i>Magid Mishneh</i> explains that this is Rambam’s opinion (regarding the <i>tefilin </i>worn on the head). Ramban, Rashba, Rosh, and most Rishonim maintain that one must wear <i>tefilin</i> on Tisha Be-Av. The prevalent custom, as cited in SA 555:1, is not to wear them until <i>Minḥa</i>. Similarly, Maharam of Rothenburg and other Rishonim are quoted as saying that at <i>Shaḥarit</i> one should act as if it is the first day of one’s personal mourning and refrain from wearing <i>tefilin</i>. However, after <i>Minḥa</i> time, one must put on his <i>tefilin</i>, as if it is an ordinary day. Many great Sephardic sages, as well as a few Ashkenazic sages, took care to wear their <i>talit</i> and <i>tefilin</i> before <i>Shaḥarit</i>, in order to recite the <i>Shema</i> in the optimal way; afterward, they would go to the synagogue and pray with the congregation without wearing a <i>talit</i> and <i>tefilin</i>. This was the practice of Maharam Galanti. Some suggested that everyone should adopt this practice, including <i>Ben Ish Ḥai</i>, Year 1, Devarim 25 and R. Ḥayim Palachi. Some communities prayed together while wearing their <i>talitot</i> and <i>tefilin</i>. <i>Knesset Ha-gedola</i> states that this was the custom in Salonica, and <i>Shulḥan Gavo’ah</i> attests that this was the custom in Izmir. The kabbalists of Yeshivat Ha-mekubalim (“Beit El”) in Jerusalem also followed this custom, as cited in <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 555:4.

Some Amora’im adopted a stringency to fast on both the ninth and the tenth of Av. However, the prophets and the Sages established the fast on the ninth of Av, because the beginning of any calamity is more severe than its continuation, and the calamity of the Temple’s destruction began on the ninth of Av (<i>Ta’anit</i> 29a, <i>y.

It is proper to refrain from sexual relations on the night of the tenth of Av.

                    "It is a mitzva to educate our children to observe the <i>mitzvot</i> relating to Tisha Be-Av and mourning over the destruction of the Temple, just as we teach them about all other <i>mitzvot</i>. Since children are weak, however, we cannot train them to fast. From the age of nine, we train them to fast for a few hours, depending on their strength. They should not fast the entire day (<i>Responsa Rema</i> <i>Mi-Fano</i> §111; see <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 554:23). When feeding children on Tisha Be-Av, one should give them only simple foods, in order to teach them to join with the community in mourning (MB 550:5). ",
                    "Many people teach their children who have the appropriate age – around six years old – not to eat or drink on the night of the fast.",
                    "Once children reach the age<i> </i>when they begin to understand the story of the destruction of the Temple and the concept of mourning over it – at about age six – we teach them not to wear shoes that people would normally wear when walking on rocky ground. We also teach them not to apply ointments or bathe for pleasure. Some are stringent with regard to wearing shoes even from the age of two or three. Even though children at this age do not understand the concept of mourning, the inclusion of even our children – if only to a certain extent – in our mourning nonetheless serves to express our anguish over the destruction of the Temple.<sup>28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">SA 616:1 rules that on Yom Kippur, minors must observe only the prohibition against wearing shoes, because doing so does not cause that much pain, while we may wash and anoint them. However, the reason for this leniency is that people used to wash and anoint young children in order to help them grow. Today, though, when we do not follow this practice, it seems that one may not wash and anoint minors just as we may not allow them to wear shoes. <i>Nit’ei Gavriel</i> 69:2, 73:3 rules this way as well. <i>Ḥokhmat Adam</i> 152:17 states that one does not need to train children on Tisha Be-Av, even with regard to wearing shoes, because we educate children to observe these laws only on Yom Kippur. On Tisha Be-Av and in cases of personal mourning, however, there is no need to do so if it entails even a small degree of pain. MA 551:38, however, asserts that we educate children to keep the laws of public mourning. MB 551:81 concurs, adding that there are two reasons why adults may not cut children’s hair during the Nine Days: 1) for educational purposes – accordingly, the prohibition starts at age six; and 2) to generate feelings of sorrow among the adults – in which case the prohibition starts even before then. (<i>Piskei Teshuvot</i> 554:15 concludes that, either way, everyone agrees that there is no need to be stringent before the age of two or three.)</i>",
                    "Just as adults may not study Torah on Tisha Be-Av, because it brings one joy, and one may only study sad topics related to the destruction of the Temple and the laws of mourning (above, section 10), so too with regard to teaching children: adults may only teach children topics related to the destruction of the Temple and mourning. Some maintain that adults may not teach children even topics and laws related to the destruction of the Temple, because adults feel joy when they teach children. According to these authorities, the only way one may teach children Torah on Tisha Be-Av is by telling them the story of the Temple’s destruction (MB 554:2; see <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 554:8). Since these two opinions are equally represented, every person may choose the opinion he wants to follow. Everyone agrees, however, that a minor may learn, on his own, whatever an adult may learn.<sup>29</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Baḥ</i>, <i>Taz</i>, and others assert that children who understand what they learn may study sorrowful topics. When the Sages stated that one may not teach children, they were referring to teaching them their regular course of study. MA maintains that an adult should not teach children even sad topics, but one may tell them stories about the destruction of the Temple.</i>"

                    "The Talmud describes the story of Ḥanuka, which occurred during the Second Temple era, in a brief passage:<br>When the Greeks entered the Temple, they defiled all the oils therein. When the Hasmoneans prevailed and defeated them, they searched and found only one cruse of oil that was marked with the seal of the High Priest, but which contained sufficient for one day’s lighting only; yet a miracle was performed there and they lit [the <i>Menora</i>] for eight days with this [oil]. Another year these [days] were designated a holiday with [the recitation of] <i>Hallel</i> and thanksgiving. (<i>Shabbat</i> 21b)<br>It is likewise forbidden to fast or deliver eulogies on these days (<i>Megilat Ta’anit</i> 9:2).",
                    "The Sages established many holidays during the Second Temple era, to thank God and rejoice over the salvations He performed for Israel. These holidays are all mentioned in <i>Megilat Ta’anit</i>. Many of these holidays commemorate the victories of the Hasmoneans: 13 Adar was “Nicanor Day,” when the Hasmoneans defeated a large Greek army and killed their commander, Nicanor; 14 Sivan was the day they conquered Caesarea; 22 Elul, when the Hasmoneans killed the apostates who refused to repent; 23 Marḥeshvan, when the Hasmoneans destroyed the brothel that the Greeks had built near the Holy Temple; and 25 Marḥeshvan, when they conquered Samaria and began settling it.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Additionally: On 22 Shevat, because during the Hasmonean Revolt, the wicked Antiochus traveled to Jerusalem to destroy the city and annihilate its Jewish inhabitants. Upon hearing troubling reports of rebellion in the eastern part of his kingdom, however, he was forced to end the siege of Jerusalem on that day (in 167 BCE). He eventually died during these rebellions. On 3 Kislev, the Hasmoneans removed the idols that the Greek troops had placed in the Holy Temple. On 24 Av, the Hasmoneans reinstated Torah law as the official legal system, instead of Greek law. On 23 Iyar, Shimon ben Matityahu the Hasmonean conquered the Acra fortress that housed a Greek garrison even after the city was liberated. On 27 Iyar, the Hasmoneans (apparently during the reign of Yonatan ben Matityahu) banned the idolatrous images that hung upon the entrances of houses and stores. On 15-16 Sivan, the Hasmoneans conquered Beit She’an and drove out the gentiles who oppressed the Jews. The Sages also established holidays to commemorate the deaths of evil kings who persecuted them: King Yannai on 2 Shevat<b> </b>and King Herod on 7 Kislev. Many other dates are mentioned in <i>Megilat Ta’anit</i>.</i>",
                    "However, after the destruction of the Second Temple, the Sages abolished <i>Megilat Ta’anit</i> (SA 573:1) because all of the wonderful things that happened on those days were no longer relevant and thus no longer constituted a reason to rejoice. One may even fast and deliver eulogies on these days. Only Ḥanuka remains of all those day, as the Sages explain, because of the unique miracle of the oil that it commemorates and the mitzva of lighting Ḥanuka candles that the Sages enacted to publicize the miracle. And since we already observe the mitzva of lighting the Ḥanuka candles, we also preserve the other aspects of the holiday: we thank God by inserting <i>Al Ha-nisim</i> into our prayers; we praise God for saving His people by reciting <i>Hallel</i>; and we refrain from fasting and eulogizing throughout the holiday (see RH 18b; Rashi and Ritva <i>ad loc.</i>).",
                    "In order to understand better the significance of Ḥanuka and the miracle of the oil – the only remnants of all the holidays that existed during the Second Temple era – we must elaborate a bit on the events of those days and their meaning."

                    "Over the course of hundreds of years, an advanced culture developed in Greece and accomplished a great deal in the realms of science, philosophy, literature, art, architecture, military strategy, and politics. Its power increased gradually. In defeating his adversaries, King Philip II of Macedon united the Greek city-states under his rule. He invited the great Greek philosopher and scientist Aristotle to tutor his son, Alexander III, later known as Alexander the Great. When Alexander ascended the throne, he began a campaign of conquests, and within three years (3426-3429/ 334-331 BCE), his army had conquered vast expanses of territory – Asia Minor, Eretz Yisrael, Egypt, and the entire mighty Persian Empire as far as India.",
                    "After Alexander died, the generals of the Macedonian army began fighting over the throne. In the end, they divided the vast territory under their control into several Greek kingdoms.",
                    "As a result of the conquests, Greek culture spread throughout the world, consuming all other cultures and forming a single Hellenistic civilization. The system of government, language, culture, and sporting competitions in every country were Hellenistic. The upper classes and the nobility of every land assimilated into Hellenistic culture imitated its ways.",
                    "Judea was among the areas ruled by the Greeks, and there, too, Hellenism spread. The Jews, however, were different from all the other nations, and the process of Hellenization proceeded relatively slowly in Judea. Nonetheless, over the course of 160 years of Greek rule, the influence of the Hellenists grew increasingly stronger, mostly over the affluent. It reached the point where the High Priests, Jason and Menelaus, were leading supporters of Hellenization, working to increase Greek influence in Judea. Jason built a gymnasium near the Holy Temple, which caused the priests to prefer watching wrestling matches rather than performing their sacrificial duties in the Temple.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Alexander the Great died in 3437 (323 BCE). At first, Ptolemy I and Seleucus I fought Antigonus I, defeating him in the Battle of Aza in 3448 (312 BCE). The winners divided the spoils, with Ptolemy taking Egypt and Seleucus taking Syria and Babylonia. Later, the two fought each other over Eretz Yisrael, and the Ptolemaic dynasty prevailed, taking control of the Holy Land for over a hundred years, starting in 3458 (301 BCE). In the year 3562 (198 BCE), Antiochus III, a member of the Seleucid dynasty, conquered Eretz Yisrael, but his power waned toward the end of his life. He attempted to conquer the kingdom of Pergamon in Asia Minor, but the Romans intervened on their behalf and defeated Antiochus, who was forced to pay a steep war indemnity. His son Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the wicked king who enacted evil decrees against the Jews, took the reins of power after his father’s demise (3584-3596/ 176-164 BCE). (Most of the information in this and the following notes is taken from Dr. Mordechai Breuer’s <i>Divrei Ha-yamim Le-Yisrael U-le’umot Ha-olam</i>.)</i>"

                    "In the year 3591 from creation (169 BCE), around 160 years after the Greeks conquered Eretz Yisrael, Antiochus IV Epiphanes began oppressing the Jews. Under his rule, the Greeks plundered the holy vessels of the Temple, breached the walls of Jerusalem, murdered thousands of Jews, and enslaved many others. In 3593 (167 BCE), Antiochus decreed that the Jews must forsake the Torah and its <i>mitzvot</i> and worship idols. He made it a capital crime to perform <i>mitzvot</i>, abolished the sacrificial service in the Temple, and turned the Temple into a place of idolatry. Torah scrolls were torn and burned. Antiochus’ soldiers went from town to town forcing the Jews to eat pork and erect an altar for idol worship. They prohibited the practice of <i>brit mila</i>,<i> </i>and Jewish women who insisted on circumcising their sons were executed. As a result of these decrees, many pious Jews fled to the wilderness, caves, or other countries; and many were murdered in sanctification of God’s name.",
                    "The intense pressure that the Greeks exerted against the Jews kindled a spark in their souls, and when the Greeks arrived in the village of Modi’in, with the intention of forcing Matityahu b. Yoḥanan the High Priest to worship idols, Matityahu rose up and killed the Greek officer and his Hellenized Jewish collaborators. The novelty of his action was that instead of dying in sanctification of God’s name, like the other pious Jews, he decided to kill the oppressor. By doing so, he and his sons raised the banner of rebellion against the Greeks and Hellenization.",
                    "The war was difficult. Yehuda the Maccabee, the boldest of Matityahu’s sons, led the fighters. With courage and skill, the Hasmoneans overcame the Greek forces, and after two years of fighting they succeeded in conquering Jerusalem. On the 25th of Kislev, 3596 (165 BCE), they began purifying the Temple and restoring the sacrificial service to its original state. This is when the miracle of the oil took place.",
                    "Later on, the Greeks returned to Eretz Yisrael in greater numbers, conquered Jerusalem, and put Hellenized Kohanim in charge of the Temple. However, in order to avoid increasing tensions with the Jews, they abolished the evil decrees and allowed the Jews to observe the Torah and the <i>mitzvot</i>. But this did not stop the rebellion; the Hasmoneans continued to fight against the Greeks and Hellenism. The war effort had ups and downs, but the Hasmonean brothers combined strength, diplomacy, and cunning to eventually gain political independence, decades later. Granted, the Jews lived under the aegis of the mighty empires of the ancient world – first the Greeks and then the Romans – but rule over Eretz Yisrael was by the Jews and for the Jews.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On the thirteenth of Adar, 3599 (161 BCE), Yehuda the Maccabee’s troops defeated the army of Greek general Nicanor; Nicanor was killed and the remnants of his troops retreated. This day was celebrated as “the Day of Nicanor” for generations. Immediately thereafter, the Greeks sent Bacchides at the head of a large army. Yehuda, unable to mobilize a greater number of fighters, stood against him with a mere 800 soldiers. Yehuda was killed in this battle (3600/ 160 BCE). Bacchides conquered the entire Eretz Yisrael and awarded the position of High Priest to Alcimus, a Hellenist, who executed sixty of Israel’s elder sages. Yonatan, Yehuda’s brother, assumed command of the remaining Hasmonean fighters, who had fled and gone into hiding. Over time, the Hasmoneans regained their strength and managed to harass the Greeks, but they were unable to reconquer Jerusalem. Then, a threat arose against King Demetrius’ rule, and in order to maintain his power he made a pact with the Hasmoneans, giving them Jerusalem and autonomy. Yonatan took advantage of the struggle for power in the Seleucid dynasty and obtained additional concessions from Demetrius’s rival. Thus, in the year 3608 (152 BCE), the Hellenist administrators of the Holy Temple were deposed and Yonatan began serving as High Priest. Diodotus Tryphon, one of the Greek rulers who opposed Yonatan’s increasing power in Jerusalem, lured him into meeting for a friendly conference and then murdered him (3618/ 142 BCE). Shimon inherited his brother’s command and made a treaty with Tryphon’s rival, in exchange for a tax exemption for the Jews of Judea. While the Greek kings were preoccupied with internal battles, Shimon cleansed Eretz Yisrael of the vestiges of Greek influence, conquered the fortress of Accra (23 Iyar, 3619/ 141 BCE, a date later established as a holiday), as well as additional cities surrounding Judea, and fortified its political independence. When Antiochus VII Sidetes defeated his enemies and no longer needed Shimon’s aid, he instigated a conspiracy against him, and indeed, Shimon’s son-in-law Ptolemy murdered Shimon, along with two of his sons (3625/ 135 BCE). With Antiochus’s help, Ptolemy tried to take control of Judea, but Yoḥanan Hyrcanus, Shimon’s faithful son, fought him. Then, Antiochus came to assist the murderous Ptolemy, pillaging Judea and bringing Jerusalem under heavy siege. However, Antiochus was forced to retreat because of revolts that sprang up against him elsewhere. He accepted Yoḥanan’s peace proposal, which stated that the Jews would pay a heavy tax to the Greeks in exchange for partial autonomy. Yoḥanan was appointed High Priest and <i>nasi</i>. Shortly thereafter, Antiochus’ army was crushed by the Parthians and Antiochus himself was killed. At this time, Yoḥanan began conquering additional territory in Eretz Yisrael, in order to expand Jewish settlement at the expense of the gentiles and to cleanse the land of idolatry. These conquests brought the Jews wealth and economic prosperity. Yoḥanan ruled Judea for 31 years (3625-3656/ 135-104 BCE), acting righteously most of his lifetime and strengthening the Sanhedrin. At the end of his life, however, he joined the Sadducees.</i>",
                    "It seems quite evident that had the Greeks been more patient, Judea would have succumbed to Hellenism, just like the other nations did. But the hand of God, which conceals itself in the historical process, generated the conflict. Just as He hardened Pharaoh’s heart during the Exodus, so too, He hardened Antiochus’ heart, and in the process helped reveal the faith, self-sacrifice, and courage of the Jewish people."

We still needed to defend ourselves against the torrent of Hellenism that had already engulfed all of the surrounding cultures. Greek culture was very powerful. Its methods of scientific research were advanced; its military strategy was excellent; its system of government was efficient; its sculptures and architectural designs were impressive; its dramatic performances captivated; and its sporting events thrilled. This is why Greek culture succeeded in spreading so vigorously throughout the civilized world. Centuries later, when Rome had already become the major military power in the world, Greek culture remained the dominant cultural force.",
                    "Although the Hasmonean revolt impeded the process of Hellenization, it did not stop it entirely. A few decades later, Hellenism once again struck deep roots among wealthy Jews and among those who were in close contact with the gentiles. The Hellenists of the Hasmonean era were known as Sadducees; they did not preach total assimilation, but they believed that it was possible to combine loyalty to the Written Torah and Greek culture within a Jewish national framework.",
                    "One of the great tragedies of Jewish history is that the descendants of Matityahu, who sacrificed his life to fight Hellenism, were themselves drawn to Hellenism and persecuted the Sages of Israel, the defenders of our tradition. Matityahu’s great-grandson was King Yannai, who also served as High Priest. An evil man, Yannai believed that his death would gladden the Sages and their supporters. In order to spoil their joy, he commanded that immediately following his death a large number of Sages should be executed. After he died, however, his heirs, led by his wife Shlomtziyon, disobeyed his orders. The Sages declared the day of Yannai’s death a joyous day of thanksgiving, marking the demise of an evildoer and the salvation of the Sages.",
                    "Eventually, the slaves of the Hasmoneans – foremost among them, Herod – overcame their masters, annihilated the entire Hasmonean line, and ruled in their stead. The Sages thus declared: “Anyone who claims to be from the Hasmonean dynasty is either a slave or a liar” (BB 3b).<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The troubles began following the death of Yoḥanan Hyrcanus (3656/ 104 BCE). Yoḥanan’s heirs did not obey his last will; his oldest son, Yehuda Aristobulus, an ally of the Sadducees, acted like a Hellenist ruler, incarcerating his mother and brother and declaring himself king and High Priest. He died a year later, after which his brother Alexander Yannai reigned for 27 years. Yannai was a Sadducee who favored the Hellenists and fought against the Sages. Despite this, he continued to extend the borders of Israel. Alexander Yannai repented toward the end of his life, realizing that his ties with the Sadducees undermined Jewish nationalism. He therefore commanded that his righteous wife, Shlomtziyon, sister of Shimon b. Shetaḥ, inherit his throne. Shlomtziyon reigned for nine years (3684-3693/ 76-67 BCE). After her death, a bitter civil war broke out between her two sons, Hyrcanus and Aristobulus (who were educated by their father Yannai). In the year 3695 (65 BCE), the two brothers turned to the Roman commander Pompey, asking him to mediate between them. Two years later, Pompey and his army invaded Judea, abolished the Hasmonean kingdom, and stripped Judea of some of its territory. He allowed Hyrcanus to retain his position of High Priest and leader of the Jews in Judea, giving over the rest of Eretz Yisrael to autonomous gentile rule, subordinate to Rome. In the course of time, Antipater the Idumean, a loyalist to Hyrcanus, established ties with the Romans and became their trusted ally, eventually taking control of Judea. After he died, his son Herod continued in his ways. Since Herod helped Hyrcanus defeat his nephew Antigonus, Hyrcanus gave him his granddaughter Miriam’s hand in marriage. This enabled Herod to eventually claim the Hasmonean throne. In the year 3720 (40 BCE), the Parthians conquered Eretz Yisrael and Aristobulus’ son Antigonus seized control of Judea taking revenge on his uncle Hyrcanus. Herod fled to Rome, where he was officially appointed King of Judea. Armed with Roman troops, he returned to the Holy Land and reconquered it. Thus began his 36-year reign. He murdered his opponents and anyone else whom he perceived as a threat to his authority, including the members of the Hasmonean family, and even some of his own sons. When Herod died in 3756 (4 BCE), the Sages ordained the date of his death – the seventh of Kislev – as a holiday. Nevertheless, Rambam considered his kingdom genuine Jewish sovereignty, as he writes in MT, Laws of Ḥanuka 3:1: In the merit of the Hasmonean victory, “sovereignty returned to the Jewish people for over 200 years.” Rambam teaches us here that even Herod’s reign was better than the oppression that preceded the rebellion and the subjugation that followed the destruction of the Second Temple.</i>",
                    "Based on this, we can understand the criticism that certain Sages leveled against the Hasmoneans, accusing them of failing to appoint a king from the tribe of Yehuda, as the Torah prescribes: “The scepter shall not depart from Yehuda” (Bereishit 49:10; see Ramban <i>ad loc</i>.). At first, the Hasmonean leaders were called <i>nesi’im</i> (chieftains), but they eventually crowned themselves as kings. They also reserved the position of High Priest for themselves. Clearly, their involvement in matters of state interfered with their priestly duties, blemishing the holy service, which was supposed to be performed in sanctity and purity, and strengthening the influence of Hellenism. From a political standpoint, as well, their kingdom was lacking, as it existed in the shadow of the mighty empires and, more often than not, under their aegis. This political weakness also strengthened Hellenism’s influence over Judea."

The political independence that they won, though limited, contributed to the prosperity of the Jewish population in Eretz Yisrael in every way. Previously, around forty percent of Judea’s produce was taken by the Greeks as a tax; now all of it remained in Eretz Yisrael, stimulating economic growth. By virtue of the victories, Jewish settlements sprung up throughout the country, Jews immigrated from the Diaspora, birthrates rose, and the Jewish nation, which had undergone destruction and exile, rehabilitated itself, to a large degree.",

Houses of study grew and flourished, fully expressing the injunction of the Men of the Great Assembly: “Produce many disciples and make a fence for the Torah” (<i>Avot</i> 1:1).

                    "This explains the Sages’ statement (RH 18b) that the holiday of Ḥanuka endures because of the miracle of the oil and the rabbinic mitzva of lighting the candles. The miracle of the oil showed that the military victory over the Greeks did not benefit that generation alone, but all generations. Therefore, the Sages determined that we should continue observing Ḥanuka even though the other holidays mentioned in <i>Megilat Ta’anit</i> were abolished after the Temple was destroyed. Thus, in addition to the mitzva of lighting candles all eight nights of Ḥanuka, we recite <i>Al Ha-nisim</i> and <i>Hallel</i>, to thank and praise God for saving us and allowing us to defeat our enemies.<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We express our thanks by reciting <i>Al Ha-nisim</i> in the <i>Amida</i> and in <i>Birkat Ha-mazon</i>, which emphasizes the victory over the Greeks, who wanted to make us forget the Torah and the <i>mitzvot</i>. God came to our aid and delivered our strong, wicked enemies into the hands of the righteous few. Afterward, the prayer relates that they purified the Temple and kindled lights. No mention is made of the miracle of the oil.<br>Rambam further emphasizes the national-political victory:<br>During the Second Temple era, the Greek kingdom issued decrees against the Jewish people, abolishing their religion and refusing to allow them to observe the Torah and its <i>mitzvot</i>. They did violence against their property and their daughters; they entered the Temple, wrought havoc within, and made the sacraments impure. The Jews suffered great difficulties from them, for they oppressed them greatly until the God of our ancestors had mercy upon them, delivered them from their hand, and saved them. The sons of the Hasmoneans, the High Priests, overpowered [the Greeks], killed them, and saved the Jews from their hand. They appointed a king from the priests, and sovereignty returned to Israel for over 200 years, until the destruction of the Second Temple. (MT, Laws of Ḥanuka 3:1)<br>This means that the miracle of the oil symbolizes the triumph of faith and Torah over Hellenism. It is the basis for the fact that Ḥanuka is a perpetual holiday. However, we would not have been privileged to receive the everlasting mitzva of lighting the candles or the triumph of faith if not for the miracle of the military victory – the righteous defeating the wicked – and the other national achievements, as described in <i>Al Ha-nisim</i>. This is why we praise God specifically by reciting <i>Hallel</i>, since the Sages prescribed that we recite <i>Hallel</i> mainly to commemorate times when the Jewish people were delivered from bondage or saved from death. Hence, Rambam emphasizes the national aspects of Ḥanuka. This also explains why Rambam emphasizes the joy of Ḥanuka, as he writes later: “Accordingly, the Sages of that generation decreed that these eight days, beginning from the 25th of Kislev, be commemorated as days of joy and praise. Candles should be lit…” (<i>ibid. </i>3:3). (It may be that Rambam viewed the military victory as the primary miracle, contrary to what I wrote in the first section of this chapter, based on the opinion of several Rishonim.) For more on this issue and the following discussion, see the essay in <i>Orot </i>titled essay<i> </i>“<i>Le-mahalakh Ha-idei’ot</i>,” where Rav Kook explains that the Second Temple era prepared the Jews for the subsequent exile, by absorbing sacred vitality from the Temple and integrating it into the Oral Torah that accompanied the Jews into exile. See also the essay titled “<i>Ḥakham Adif Mi-navi</i>,” and <i>Orot Ha-Torah</i>, ch. 1.</i>",
                    "Over the years, it became clear that the miracle was even greater than we originally thought. Not only did we manage to survive the torrent of Hellenism that inundated the world, but Judaism shattered – through a long and complicated process – most of the pagan foundations of Hellenism. The abstract belief in one God, ethical values, the aspiration to fix the world – all fundamental principles of the Torah – increasingly spread among the nations of the world, eventually becoming, through means both direct and indirect (i.e., via Christianity and Islam), the foundations of all the good and beneficial aspects of human culture.",
                    "The longer our exile lasted, the longer and brighter the light of Israel and its Torah shone.

These candles symbolize the mighty Jewish faith, which breaks through all forms of darkness. Even in the darkest times, when the mightiest empires ruled the world ruthlessly, we did not despair of the light of Torah and faith, and we continued learning and teaching. A small ray of our light has the power to disperse a great deal of their darkness.",
                    "Ḥanuka is the celebration of the Oral Torah. First, this holiday was established by the Sages (the expounders of the Oral Torah), and second, the mitzva of lighting the candles was one of the first <i>mitzvot</i> the Sages enacted. But beyond these reasons, the holiday of Ḥanuka is a general expression of the essence of the Oral Torah. During the First Temple era, prophecy abounded among the Jewish people, and they studied the Written Torah primarily. After the Temple was destroyed and prophecy ceased, however, the time came for the Oral Torah to take precedence. The Oral Torah reveals the high stature of the Jewish people, who share in revealing the Torah’s light. The principles are set in the Written Torah, but the Sages of the Oral Torah paved the way for the realization of these principles. Granted, the light of the Written Torah shines brighter – it is compared in this regard to the midday sun – while the light of the Oral Torah is compared to that of the moon and the stars. However, the Oral Torah is able to descend to the hidden recesses of the soul and illuminate all dark corners of the world. The foundations for the methods of the Oral Torah were laid during the Second Temple era – including all enactments, safeguards, and customs. By virtue of the unique light of the Oral Torah, which, like the Ḥanuka candles, illuminates the darkness, we have managed to overcome all the difficulties of the exile.",

The Torah, as well, belongs to the eighth level, as it serves to elevate nature to a divine level. This is why the Torah was given after the seven-week <i>omer</i> period, which represents the wholeness of nature. After the seven weeks of the <i>omer</i>, we rise to a level above nature – the festival of Shavu’ot, when the Torah was given.

The Greeks’ worldview stemmed from nature, and since there are different forces in nature, they believed in multiple gods. In addition, since nature has no values, only strength, beauty, and external wisdom, they yearned for these things. In contrast, Judaism is based on the belief in one God, who created nature but who Himself transcends it. The goal is to discover God’s oneness in the world, to reveal the image of God within man through morals, the Torah, and the <i>mitzvot</i>. The Greeks cannot coexist with us, because our belief in one God and our ethical values undermine the foundation of their worldview. Judaism, however, can coexist with Greek culture and use it as a tool for research, classification, and the revelation of Jewish concepts.

The first is that women were generally less astute and are thus were more likely to use the light of the Ḥanuka candles mistakenly. The second is that they have a certain special virtue, and therefore the sanctity of the day manifests itself in them to a greater extent.<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Sages say that women must hear the <i>Megilla</i> on Purim, drink the four cups on Pesaḥ, and light the Ḥanuka candles, because “they too participated in that miracle” (<i>Megilla</i> 4a, <i>Pesaḥim</i> 108b, <i>Shabbat</i> 23a). <i>Tosafot</i> and many other Rishonim maintain that these <i>mitzvot</i> are primarily incumbent upon men, while women are also obligated because they too were saved from Egypt, Haman, and the Greeks. Rashi and Rashbam (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 108b) maintain that a woman’s obligation in these <i>mitzvot</i> stems from the fact that women played a major role in the miracles that took place. After all, the Gemara (<i>Sota</i> 11b) states that we were redeemed from Egypt by virtue of the righteous women of that generation, who had faith in God and encouraged their husbands to procreate despite the harsh decrees. The Purim miracle as well came about through Esther, and the Ḥanuka miracle was precipitated by Yehudit. From this perspective, these <i>mitzvot</i> are more pertinent to women than they are to men. Therefore, only they are meticulous and refrain from working while the candles are lit.<br>See above, 1:7, regarding Rosh Ḥodesh, which is more significant to women than it is to men, because women were not involved in the sin of the Golden Calf, and they also donated toward the construction of the <i>Mishkan</i>. Perhaps this is also why women have a higher connection to Ḥanuka, because the Hasmoneans rededicated the Temple at that time, just as the Israelites completed the construction of the <i>Mishkan</i> in the wilderness. In addition, the element of the Oral Torah, which we mentioned above, is connected to the attribute of kingship (<i>malkhut</i>), which has a feminine aspect. See <i>Ben Ish Ḥai</i>, Vayeshev 27.

Even though it is a time-bound positive mitzva, from which women are usually exempt, they are nonetheless obligated because women were involved in the miracle (<i>Shabbat</i> 23a; however, it is customary for a married woman to fulfill her obligation through her husband’s lighting; see below n. 2, and above ch. 11 n. 14).",

They also determined that one should light the candles after <i>shki’a</i>, when the maximum number of people will see them. On one hand, darkness has already begun to descend, making the lights more visible. On the other hand, it is early enough that the streets are still filled with people coming home from work (we will elaborate below, 13:4).

                    "The mitzva of lighting Ḥanuka candles is very beloved. In general, there are two levels of mitzva observance: fulfillment of the basic obligation and <i>mehadrin</i>, going beyond the basics to beautify the mitzva. When it comes to Ḥanuka candles, however, there are three levels: the basic obligation, <i>mehadrin</i>, and <i>mehadrin min ha-mehadrin</i>, the most beautiful way. Moreover, all of Israel fulfills this mitzva according to the practice of <i>mehadrin min ha-mehadrin</i>.",
                    "Minimally, every household must light one candle every night of Ḥanuka on behalf of all household members. This candle enables them to remember and publicize the miracle of Ḥanuka. Those who go above and beyond this (<i>mehadrin</i>)<i> </i>light one candle for every adult member of the household. For example, if four adults live in the house, they light four candles every night of Ḥanuka, demonstrating that everyone has a share in the mitzva.",
                    "Those who follow the custom of <i>mehadrin min ha-mehadrin</i> light a different number of candles each night of Ḥanuka. The Sages disputed the number of candles that one must light according to this custom. According to Beit Shammai, we light eight candles on the first night and subtract one candle every subsequent night, eventually lighting one candle on the last night. According to this viewpoint, the number of candles corresponds to the number of days remaining in the holiday of Ḥanuka. On the first night, we light eight candles because there are eight days left in the holiday, and on the last night we light one candle because there is only one day left. According to Beit Hillel, we light one candle on the first night and add a candle each subsequent night, eventually lighting eight candles on the last night. According to them, the number of candles corresponds to the number of days that have already passed – that is, every night we light candles according to the number of days the miracle lasted. This way, we demonstrate the magnitude of the miracle, because every additional day that the Hasmoneans lit the <i>Menora</i> in the Temple using the same small cruse of oil, the miracle increased. In addition, this method allows us to ascend in holiness, until we reach the pinnacle on the eighth night when we light eight candles (<i>Shabbat</i> 21b). All of Israel has accepted the custom of <i>mehadrin min ha-mehadrin</i>, according to Beit Hillel’s interpretation (SA<i> </i>671:2).",
                    "What emerges, in practice, is that we light 36 candles over the course of the eight days of Ḥanuka. The prevalent custom, though, is to light an additional candle every night, to serve as a <i>shamash</i> (lit., “attendant”), so that if one needs to use the light of the candles, he may use the light of the <i>shamash</i>. After all, one may not derive benefit from the Ḥanuka candles. However, we separate the <i>shamash</i> from the other candles, because the main objective of the custom of <i>mehadrin min ha-mehadrin</i> is to make the number of candles recognizable and thus demonstrate the increasing magnitude of the miracle (we will elaborate below, sections 10-11)."

                    "There are different traditions regarding how to fulfill the custom of <i>mehadrin min ha-mehadrin</i> in practice. According to Sephardic tradition, the main way of beautifying the mitzva is to light the number of candles that corresponds to the current day of Ḥanuka. Even if there are many people living in one home, only one of them should light Ḥanuka candles, and he should light the number of candles that corresponds to the current day of the holiday. That is, he lights one candle on the first night, two on the second, and eight on the eighth. The reason for this is that the goal of the custom is to show how many days the miracle lasted, as this publicizes the miracle more. If everyone in the house were to light candles within the small space adjacent to the doorway, passersby would not be able to recognize which day it is, because everyone’s candles would appear conjoined and confuse the tally. Since according to this custom only one person lights, it is proper for the head of the household to light on behalf of everyone else.",

Mordechai Eliyahu ruled that children under the age of bar mitzva may recite a <i>berakha</i>. R. Shalom Messas ruled that if someone over the age of bar mitzva wants to recite a <i>berakha</i>, he should have in mind not to fulfill his obligation through his father’s lighting and may then beautify the mitzva by lighting the candles with a <i>berakha</i> (<i>Yalkut Shemesh</i>, OḤ 192)."

                    "According to Ashkenazic custom, each member of a household must light his own candles in order to fulfill the custom of <i>mehadrin min ha-mehadrin</i>. That is, on the first night everyone lights one candle and on the eighth night everyone lights eight. We are not concerned that onlookers will not know how many candles are being lit on any given night, because we are careful to separate between the various menoras.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">At first glance, if the custom of <i>mehadrin</i> is to light one candle for every member of the household each night, then the custom of <i>mehadrin min ha-mehadrin</i> requires one to light the number of candles corresponding to the current day of the holiday on behalf of each member of the household. This is Rambam’s opinion (MT, Laws of Ḥanuka 4:1-3), as well as the Ashkenazic custom. According to Rabbeinu Yitzḥak (<i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Shabbat</i> 21b), however, only one member of the house lights candles, since if everyone lights, onlookers will not know what day of Ḥanuka is being celebrated. This runs counter to the main objective of the custom of <i>mehadrin min ha-mehadrin</i>, which is to publicize the miracle based on the number of days it lasted. This is the Sephardic custom, as written in SA 671:22. (Ra’ah explains that doing it this way glorifies the miracle more than the custom of <i>mehadrin</i> does, because most households do not have that many members. Therefore, following this version of <i>mehadrin min ha-mehadrin </i>means that more candles will be lit. Furthermore, even if fewer candles will be lit this way, the mitzva is enhanced because people will come to know which day of Ḥanuka it is.) Many explain that the difference between the customs is based on where people used to light. Sephardim traditionally lit their candles near the entrance to their homes; therefore, if many members of the household would light there, onlookers would not be able to tell which day of Ḥanuka it was. Ashkenazim, on the other hand, were accustomed to lighting inside the house, so everyone was able to light their own candles. <i>Darkhei Moshe</i> 671:1 thus writes in the name of R. Avraham of Prague that, according to the custom of <i>mehadrin min ha-mehadrin</i>, everyone in the house must light his own candles when lighting indoors, even according to <i>Tosafot</i>.<br>According to <i>Bi’ur Ha-Gra</i>, the main reason the Gemara gives for Beit Hillel’s opinion is that we “ascend in holiness,” so there is no need to know which day of Ḥanuka it is; the main thing is to increase the number of candles. Thus, the Vilna Gaon dismisses <i>Tosafot</i>’s reasoning, indicating that even when everyone lights at the entrance, one should light according to the number of members of the household and the current day of the holiday.<br>Some infer from Rambam’s language that one person should light for everyone, but according to Ashkenazic custom, based on Maharil, everyone lights his own candles and recites his own <i>berakhot</i>. R. Naḥum Rabinovitch writes in <i>Melumdei Milḥama</i> (p. 232) that according to R. Yosef Qafiḥ’s edition of MT, it turns out that Ashkenazic custom is the same as Rambam’s opinion. <i>Taz</i> 677:1 and MA 677:9 explain that since the members of the household have no intention of fulfilling their obligation through the head of the household’s <i>berakhot</i>, they may recite the <i>berakhot</i> over their own candles. This implies that they would not be able to recite the <i>berakhot</i> otherwise, because one does not recite a <i>berakha</i> upon merely beautifying a mitzva. <i>Sefat Emet</i> (<i>Shabbat</i> 21b), however, postulates that from the very beginning, the Sages determined that those who follow the custom of <i>mehadrin min ha-mehadrin</i> should recite the <i>berakhot</i>, even though they have already fulfilled their minimal obligation. Another dispute involves one who lights a single candle, with a <i>berakha</i>, and later obtains enough candles to fulfill the mitzva according to the custom of <i>mehadrin</i>. Should he recite an additional <i>berakha</i> upon lighting the new candles or not? <i>Eliya Rabba</i> maintains that he should recite a <i>berakha</i>, but according to <i>Pri Ḥadash</i> §672 he should not recite a <i>berakha</i>; <i>Responsa R. Akiva Eger </i>2:13 seems to lean toward that opinion, based on the implication of <i>Taz</i> and MA.<br>We must clarify whether the lighting of the head of a household absolves his family members of their obligation if they planned on lighting on their own but ended up not doing so. In my humble opinion, they have discharged their obligation, <i>be-di’avad</i>, because the minimal requirement to light one candle in the house was fulfilled. Therefore, whether they like it or not, the family members have fulfilled the mitzva at its simplest level. Their intention to refrain from discharging their obligation, in accordance with the words of <i>Taz</i> and MA, relates only to the effort to beautify the mitzva by lighting on their own with a <i>berakha</i>. Regarding the lighting itself, however, they discharge their obligation through the head of the household’s lighting. The matter still requires further study.</i>",

                    "The prevalent custom among married women is not to light Ḥanuka candles, because their husbands’ lighting it is considered like theirs, “one’s wife is like himself.” In many homes, young women and girls who have reached the age of education also do not light. Nevertheless, they may light with a <i>berakha</i> if they wish. It seems better to encourage young girls who have reached the age of education to light candles, at least until they become bat mitzva, as lighting Ḥanuka candles connects them to Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>. If they wish to continue lighting afterward, they should be commended. Even a woman whose husband lights candles may light her own candles, with a <i>berakha</i>, if she wishes, despite the custom to refrain from doing so.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Many Aḥaronim cite the reason that “one’s wife is like himself,” including MB 671:9, 675:9 and <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 671:16. Several reasons are given to explain why girls in some communities refrain from lighting. <i>Ḥatam Sofer</i> (<i>Shabbat</i> 21b) states that since people used to light outdoors, it was considered immodest for girls to go out and light. According to <i>Mishmeret Shalom</i> 48:2, it is improper for a daughter to light when her mother does not do so. Others explain that the reason minors light the candles is in order to train them to perform the <i>mitzvot </i>as adults, and since girls will not light when they grow older, because their husbands will light for them, they do not light when they are young either. (See <i>Mikra’ei Kodesh</i> [Frank] §14)<br>It they wish, they may light with a <i>berakha</i>, as MB 675:9 states. After all, Ashkenazic custom permits women to recite <i>berakhot</i> even over <i>mitzvot</i> from which they are exempt. Certainly, then, they may recite a <i>berakha</i> over lighting the Ḥanuka candles, which they are obligated to do. And since some single women and widows live alone, there is room to say that young women should become used to lighting candles, with a <i>berakha</i>, in their parents’ home. According to the predominant Sephardic custom, in which only one person in each household lights, girls should not recite a <i>berakha</i> if they wish to light.</i>"

                    "The Sages prescribed that we recite two <i>berakhot</i> before lighting the Ḥanuka candles, so that we focus on the two aspects of the mitzva. The first <i>berakha</i> relates to the mitzva itself: “…Who has sanctified us with His <i>mitzvot</i> and commanded us to light Ḥanuka candles.” The Ashkenazic formulation of this <i>berakha </i>concludes, “<i>lehadlik ner shel Ḥanuka</i>,” while Sephardim conclude, “<i>lehadlik ner Ḥanuka</i>.”<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The text of the Gemara (<i>Shabbat</i> 23a) reads, “<i>lehadlik ner shel Ḥanuka</i>,” and this is how Rif and most Rishonim formulate the <i>berakha</i>.

Sephardic Jews follow this custom.</i> The second <i>berakha</i> expresses our thanks to God for the miracles He performed on behalf of our ancestors when the story of Ḥanuka took place. The Sages enacted that we recite this <i>berakha</i> when we light the candles because the candles are supposed to remind us of the miracles and their meaning. We recite: “<i>Barukh ata Hashem Elokeinu Melekh ha-olam she-asa nisim la-avoteinu ba-yamim ha-hem ba-zeman ha-zeh</i>” (“Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, Who performed miracles for our ancestors in those days, at this time”). On the first day, we add the <i>berakha </i>of <i>She-heḥeyanu</i>, which expresses our thanks to God for giving us life and sustaining us for another year, giving us the privilege to once again reach the days of Ḥanuka and fulfill the mitzva of lighting the candles.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Some maintain that the <i>berakhot</i> of <i>She-asa Nisim </i>and <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> were instituted in connection with both the act of lighting the candles and with the day itself. Therefore, one who cannot light candles nonetheless recites these <i>berakhot</i> upon the day itself (Me’iri). Others maintain that these <i>berakhot</i> were instituted only in connection with the lighting, and one who does not light or see lit candles may not recite them (Rambam). The Aḥaronim debate this issue as well, and SHT 676:3 remains undecided. According to most Aḥaronim, however, one should not recite the <i>berakhot</i>, out of uncertainty.</i>",
                    "Immediately following the <i>berakhot</i>, one begins lighting the candles, without talking between completing the <i>berakhot</i> and beginning to light. After the first candle is lit, it is customary to start reciting <i>Ha-nerot Halalu</i> (whose origin is <i>Sofrim</i> 20:6). While reciting this paragraph, one continues lighting the remaining candles. Even though more candles still need to be lit, reciting <i>Ha-nerot Halalu</i> does not constitute an interruption. As we already learned, the minimal obligation of the mitzva is fulfilled by lighting the first candle, while the purpose of the remaining candles is to beautify the mitzva. Even though, <i>le-khatḥila</i>, one should refrain from speaking until after all the candles are lit, since <i>Ha-nerot Halalu</i> explains the purpose of the mitzva, there is room to say that one should recite it specifically while fulfilling the mitzva. However, one who finds it difficult to recite <i>Ha-nerot Halalu</i> while lighting the candles may recite it afterward (see MB 676:8, <i>Mishbetzot Zahav</i> 676:5).",

Besides the fact that this glorifies the mitzva and publicizes the miracle, it is necessary for those who are not reciting the <i>berakhot</i> themselves, like a woman who fulfills her obligation through her husband’s lighting or children who fulfill their obligation through the lighting of the head of the household. By hearing the <i>berakhot</i>, they take part in thanking God for the miracles He performed.

On the first night, the <i>berakha </i>of <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> is added. The commentators disagree on what the phrase “one who sees the Ḥanuka candles” means. According to Rashi, Rambam, and <i>Mordechai</i>, one who has another person light on his behalf, but who fails to hear the <i>berakhot</i>, recites <i>She-asa Nisim</i> upon seeing the candles. This is because the mitzva has two components: 1) to light Ḥanuka candles at home, in order to publicize the miracle; and 2) to thank God for the miracle by seeing the candles. One who has another person light on his behalf at home has fulfilled the mitzva of lighting, but since he did not hear the <i>berakha </i>of <i>She-asa Nisim</i>, he has not fulfilled the mitzva of giving thanks. Therefore, he recites the <i>berakha</i> upon seeing Ḥanuka candles. For example, a woman who did not hear her husband recite the <i>berakhot</i> when he lit must recite <i>She-asa Nisim</i> when she comes home later and sees the candles. Similarly, a household member who was absent when the candles were lit recites the <i>berakha</i> of <i>She-asa Nisim</i> when he walks through the streets and sees Ḥanuka candles in the window of someone’s house. On the other hand, Rashba, Ran, and <i>Smag</i> maintain that only one who has not yet discharged his obligation – because he has no one to light on his behalf – recites <i>She-asa Nisim</i> upon seeing Ḥanuka candles.<br>SA 676:3, MB <i>ad loc. </i>6, SHT <i>ad loc. </i>9-11, and <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> <i>ad loc. </i>24 rule that one should not recite a <i>berakha</i>, because the matter is uncertain.

Even according to those who maintain that the head of the household completely exempts everyone of their obligation with his lighting, it is clear that it is preferable for him to perform the mitzva in the presence of the entire family.

                    "Some have a custom to place large, electric menoras, whose light can be seen from afar, in public areas. Even though this does not fulfill the rabbinic commandment to light Ḥanuka candles, there is merit to this custom, because it reminds the public of the miracle of Ḥanuka."

                    "The mitzva is fulfilled by the act of lighting the candles, not by having them lit. This is evident from the formulation of the <i>berakha</i>: “Who has sanctified us with His <i>mitzvot</i> and commanded us <b>to light</b> Ḥanuka candles.” Therefore, if one lights candles that can burn for half an hour and someone knocks them down by accident, causing them to go out before half an hour has passed, he does not need to rekindle them, because he fulfilled the mitzva when he lit the candles initially. Even if one lights inferior candles, such that there is some concern that they might go out, he has discharged his obligation, assuming that these candles usually last for half an hour. Nonetheless, the Aḥaronim rule that it is proper to be stringent and rekindle the candles, so that they may be lit for the half-hour period that the Sages prescribed (SA 673:2, MB <i>ad loc. </i>27).",
                    "However, if one lights the candles in a place where they cannot burn for half an hour, like in a windy area, and the wind actually blows them out before they manage to burn for half an hour, he has not fulfilled his obligation, because at the moment he lit them they were not fit to last the required amount of time. Most <i>poskim</i> maintain that in such a case one must rekindle the candles with a <i>berakha</i>, but in practice one should rekindle them without a <i>berakha</i>, because the matter is uncertain, and the rule is that we are lenient in cases of uncertainty concerning <i>berakhot</i>.<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One should not recite a <i>berakha</i> because he may have fulfilled his obligation with the first lighting, even though it did not last for half an hour, as we explained in n.8. Furthermore, sometimes it seems as if the candles will certainly blow out, when, in truth, it is not so certain. See SHT 673:30. Even if one extinguishes the candles deliberately, one should rekindle them without a <i>berakha</i>, because he may have already fulfilled the mitzva. Moreover, it is unclear whether extinguishing the candles nullifies the lighting that he performed properly. <i>Har Tzvi</i>, OḤ 2:114 states that if one lights in a place where, for external reasons, the candles are not expected to last half an hour, but they nonetheless do, he has discharged his obligation. This is why those who light in an aquarium fulfill the mitzva even though they close the box only after they light, because once the box is closed the candles can actually stay lit for half an hour.<br>According to Maharshal and <i>Taz</i> (MB 673:26), if the candles accidentally go out late Friday afternoon before Shabbat, one must rekindle them, because they have not yet burned after <i>shki’a</i>. Most <i>poskim</i>, however, maintain that while one is not obligated to rekindle the candles in this situation, it is very proper to do so. After Shabbat begins, or after one accepts Shabbat upon himself, everyone agrees that one may not relight the candles.</i>",
                    "As previously stated, the mitzva is fulfilled by lighting the candles, not by placing them in their proper place. Therefore, if a candle happened to have been lit while it was still daytime, and it is situated in a valid location for Ḥanuka candles, one has not fulfilled his obligation, since it was not lit for the sake of the mitzva. Even if one picks up the lit candle and then puts it back down with the intention to perform the mitzva, he has not fulfilled his obligation. Rather, he must extinguish it and rekindle it for the sake of the mitzva, and there is no need to pick it up and put it back down (<i>Shabbat</i> 23a, SA 675:1).",
                    "One must light the candles where they will be placed. Even if the head of the household is ill and cannot get out of bed, one may not bring the candles to him so that he can light by his bedside, and then transfer the candles to their proper place. Rather, the head of the household may recite the <i>berakhot</i> while someone else lights for him in the proper location of the candles (<i>Ben Ish Ḥai</i>, Year 1, <i>Hilkhot Ḥanuka</i> 6 [Vayeshev]). If one places the candles on the windowsill, but forgets to move them close to the window before lighting, he may push them closer after the lighting, so that the passersby can see them more clearly.<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If one moves the candles from inside to outside, or vice versa, after the lighting, he has not fulfilled his obligation, because an onlooker might think that he lit them for his own use (SA 675:11). Regarding nowadays, this requires further investigation. After all, people today do not use candles for light; therefore this concern no longer applies. In practice, though, one should not move the candles from place to place, even inside one’s home (MB <i>ad loc. </i>6). It seems, however, that one may move them slightly, when it is clear that one’s intention is to publicize the miracle more effectively.

Most <i>poskim</i> disagree, as <i>Beit Yosef</i> and SA 673:1 state.

If, however, one has used up all his matches, and if he does not relight the <i>shamash</i> he will not be able to continue lighting the rest of the candles, he should light the <i>shamash </i>from a Ḥanuka candle.<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Shabbat</i> 22a; <i>Berur Halakha</i> <i>ad loc</i>.; SA 674:1.

We take into account the opinions of both Maharshal, who is concerned that onlookers will think that he is benefiting from forbidden objects, and <i>Baḥ</i>, which permits one to derive benefit from the candles only if he stipulates that the sanctity will not rest upon the leftover oil or wax after half an hour. Also, see below 13:4, where I explain that it is preferable nowadays to light the candles for more than half an hour. Based on these ideas, I wrote in the main text simply that the remaining oil is forbidden, without differentiating between whether the candles already burned for half an hour or not.

                    "When setting up the menora, one is faced with several choices: Where, preferably, should the first candle be set up on the first night, the second on the second night, etc., and which candle should be lit first? Even though one fulfills the mitzva according to the custom of <i>mehadrin min ha-mehadrin</i> no matter how he lights, the ideal practice is as follows: On the first night, one sets up the candle on the right side of the menora (from the perspective of the person facing or lighting the menora), because the right side always takes precedence over the left. On the second night, one sets up the new candle to the left of the first one, and after reciting the <i>berakhot</i>, one lights the new candle first, followed by the one to its right. There are two reasons for this. 1) It is preferable to begin with the new candle, which symbolizes the increasing greatness of the miracle. 2) After lighting the leftmost candle, one will have to turn to his right in order to light the next candle, and the Sages teach that when one turns, it is preferable that one turn to the right (<i>Yoma</i> 15b). On each subsequent night, one adds a new candle to the left of the candles he lit on the previous nights and lights the new one first. Then, he turns to the right and lights the rest. When reciting the <i>berakhot</i>, it is proper to stand to the left of the menora so that the closest candle will be the one he lights first. This way, one avoids skipping over the other candles in order to light the new one (SA 676:5, MB <i>ad loc. </i>11).<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This custom is cited in SA 676:5, <i>Darkhei Moshe</i> <i>ad loc. </i>2, <i>Sha’ar Ha-kavanot</i> of Arizal, <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> <i>ad loc. </i>31. The <i>halakha</i> that one should stand next to the new candle on the left is stated explicitly in <i>Ḥayei Adam</i> <i>ad loc. </i>154 and MB <i>ad loc. </i>11. I would add that by standing to the left of the candles, the person lighting avoids being considered one who turns to the left when lighting the first, leftmost candle, because he is simply lighting the candle closest to him; and from there, he turns to the right. There are two additional customs that we will mention. 1) Maharshal and the Vilna Gaon maintain that one should first light the candle closest to the doorpost (whether one placed the candles to the left of the doorway, as one should do, <i>le-khatḥila</i>, or to its right) and continue lighting the rest from there. They believe that one should start with this candle because it is the one that fulfills the main requirement of the mitzva, while the rest are lit in order to follow the custom of <i>mehadrin</i>. This, in their opinion, is more important than lighting from left to right. 2) <i>Taz</i>’s opinion is the inverse of the accepted opinion. He maintains that turning to the right means that one begins to light on the right side and then continues to the left. According to him, one lights the leftmost candle on the first night, because it is the closest to the left doorpost.

One may not even begin a light meal, since he might drag out the meal and forget to light candles. In addition, one may not drink alcoholic beverages, but one may eat as many fruits and vegetables as one desires. One may even eat bread or <i>mezonot</i> (grain-based foods aside from bread), as long as he eats less than a <i>keveitza </i>(an egg’s bulk; c. 50 ml).",
                    "Likewise, one may not begin any type of work during the half-hour period before candle-lighting time that may drag on for a long time, nor should one go to sleep during that time. One may begin to eat, work, or sleep during this period if he asks a friend to remind him to light on time. Nevertheless, even if one begins these activities in a permissible fashion, i.e., more than half an hour before candle-lighting time, he must stop at <i>tzeit</i> and light the candles, so that he does not miss the time that the Sages enacted (MB 672:10; SHT <i>ad loc.</i>; <i>Peninei Halakha:</i> <i>Prayer</i> 25:9).",

However, he must take care not to eat until he fulfills the mitzva. In addition, if his work is the kind that can drag on for a long time, to the point where there is a concern that he will end up forgetting to light the candles, he may continue working only if he asks a friend to remind him to light when his work is done (see below 13:6, 9).",

However, if a regular Torah lecture takes place at that time, and it would be difficult to reschedule it for another time, it is best to keep the lecture at its normal time and remind everyone at its conclusion to light Ḥanuka candles (see below ch. 13, n. 13)."

                    "<b>Lighting the Ḥanuka Candles / Lighting in the Synagogue</b>",
                    "It is customary to light Ḥanuka candles in the synagogue, reciting all of the <i>berakhot</i> there that we recite at home. Even though the Sages ordained only that one must light at home, the custom developed to light in the synagogue as well, in order to publicize the miracle further. The candles are customarily placed near the southern wall of the synagogue, similar to the location of the <i>Menora</i> in the Holy Temple. One does not discharge his obligation through this lighting, and even the person who actually recites the <i>berakhot</i> and lights the candles in the synagogue must light again, with the <i>berakhot</i>, at home (SA 671:7).<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The main explanation the Rishonim provide for the custom to light in the synagogue is that it serves to publicize the miracle; see Me’iri (<i>Shabbat</i> 23b), <i>Manhig</i>, <i>Kol Bo</i>, and many others. Rivash §111 writes that when people began lighting indoors, they introduced the custom of lighting in the synagogue, in order to publicize the miracle. <i>Manhig</i> gives an additional reason: Since the miracle occurred in the Temple, the Sages wanted to publicize it in the synagogue, which is considered a miniature version of the Temple. According to these explanations, one does not fulfill his obligation through this lighting. <i>Orḥot Ḥayim</i>, however, explains that the custom is also to enable those who do not know how to perform the mitzva, or are not diligent about it, to fulfill their obligation. Some say that the purpose of this custom is to enable guests who are away from their homes to fulfill the mitzva. According to these explanations, it would seem that one can fulfill his obligation, under pressing circumstances, through the lighting in the synagogue. Rashi, Rambam, and <i>Mordechai</i> – cited above in n. 6 – maintain that if one fulfilled his obligation through the lighting performed in his home by someone else, in his absence, he has not fulfilled his obligation to thank God. According to this opinion, one may fulfill his obligation to give thanks by hearing the <i>berakha</i> of <i>She-asa Nisim</i> in the synagogue.<br>Nevertheless, the <i>halakha</i> is that one who lights in the synagogue does not fulfill his obligation, because each person is obligated to light in his home. When one lights for one’s wife and children after having recited the <i>berakhot</i> in the synagogue, it is clear that he must recite all of the <i>berakhot</i> again at home. However, if the person who lights in the synagogue lives alone, he should recite only two <i>berakhot</i> on the first night, because some maintain that the <i>berakha </i>of <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> pertains to the day itself (see <i>Beit Yosef</i> 676:3, SHT <i>ad loc. </i>3), and he has already fulfilled his obligation with the <i>berakha</i> that he recited in the synagogue. Thus state MB 671:45 and <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 671:74. (<i>Yeḥaveh Da’at</i> 2:77 states that such a person should also refrain from repeating the <i>berakha</i> of <i>She-asa Nisim</i>. By contrast, <i>Igrot Moshe</i>, OḤ 1:190, states that he should repeat <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> as well.) Therefore, it is preferable, <i>le-khatḥila</i>, for one who is free of all these uncertain elements to light the candles in the synagogue, like one whose custom is to let his father light for him at home.</i>",
                    "It is customary to light the candles between <i>Minḥa</i> and <i>Ma’ariv</i>, because that is when the largest number of people is in the synagogue and the miracle will be publicized most effectively. After <i>Ma’ariv</i>, however, people are in a rush to get home and light. In synagogues where they pray <i>Ma’ariv</i> late – significantly later than <i>tzeit</i> – they should light the candles before <i>Ma’ariv</i>.",
                    "Most congregations pray <i>Minḥa</i> on Friday afternoon shortly before <i>shki’a</i>, making it impossible to light Ḥanuka candles after <i>Minḥa</i>, because that is when one must accept Shabbat. Therefore, people in such communities should light before <i>Minḥa</i>. Congregations that pray <i>Minḥa</i> a long time before <i>shki’a</i>, however, should light the candles after <i>Minḥa</i> and make sure to finish lighting at least five minutes before <i>shki’a</i>, so that they can accept Shabbat before <i>shki’a</i> and fulfill the mitzva to extend the sanctity of Shabbat into the mundane week (MB 671:47). On <i>Motza’ei Shabbat</i>, we light the candles in the synagogue after <i>Ma’ariv</i>, because before then Shabbat has not yet ended.",
                    "Since the reason for lighting candles in the synagogue is to publicize the miracle, at least ten people must be present at the time of lighting. What should one do if ten people have yet to assemble, and it is not possible to delay the lighting – on Friday, for example, when there is a concern that the congregation will not manage to finish praying <i>Minḥa</i> on time? Some say that they may recite the <i>berakhot</i> and light the candles even though fewer than ten people will hear the <i>berakhot</i>, because ten people will certainly gather together afterward and see the candles (MA, MB 671:47, BHL <i>ad loc</i>.). Others maintain that they should light without a <i>berakha</i> (<i>Mor U-ketzi’a</i>, <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 671:72).<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Responsa Rav Pe’alim</i>, OḤ 2:62 states that if there are ten people present with the inclusion of women in the women’s section, one may recite the <i>berakhot</i> even according to those who require the presence of ten. <i>Torat Ha-mo’adim</i> 7:8 cites opinions that allow children to be included in the count as well, adding that it is preferable in such a case to ask a child to recite the <i>berakhot</i>.</i>"

                    "Many people glorify the miracle by lighting Ḥanuka candles wherever people gather, like at weddings, bar mitzvas, bat mitzvas, Ḥanuka parties, and lectures. But may one recite a <i>berakha</i> over the lighting at such an event? ",
                    "Many contemporary rabbis maintain that one should not recite a <i>berakha</i>, because the <i>berakhot</i> are customarily recited only in synagogues, and we do not have the authority to invent new customs in other places. According to them, a <i>berakha</i> that one recites in places other than a synagogue is considered a <i>berakha</i> <i>le-vatala</i>. The reason we light specifically in synagogues is likely to commemorate the <i>Menora</i> that was lit in the Holy Temple, since synagogues are considered miniature versions of the Temple. Elsewhere, however, one may not light with a <i>berakha</i>. ",
                    "Nevertheless, several <i>poskim</i> maintain that one may light Ḥanuka candles with a <i>berakha</i> wherever there is a public gathering. Since the reason we light in the synagogue is to publicize the miracle, one should light with a <i>berakha</i> wherever masses of people gather. It is preferable, though, to pray <i>Minḥa</i> and <i>Ma’ariv</i> – or even just <i>Ma’ariv</i> – in such a place, so that it will be considered a synagogue, to some degree. Then one certainly may recite a <i>berakha</i>, as the custom dictates.",
                    "In practice, one who wishes to rely on the opinion that one may light with a <i>berakha</i> may do so. If the guests at the event include non-observant Jews, who may not have lit candles at home, it is especially important to light with a <i>berakha</i>, because only then will everyone stand up – to hear the <i>berakhot</i> – causing the miracle to be publicized in front of their eyes. They will also learn how to fulfill the mitzva properly. If possible, it is preferable to ask someone who is unaccustomed to performing <i>mitzvot</i> to recite the <i>berakhot</i> and light the candles. This way, it will become clear that the <i>mitzvot </i>belong to the entire Jewish people, observant Jews and non-observant Jews alike.<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Those who maintain that one may not recite the <i>berakhot </i>include: <i>Minḥat Yitzḥak</i> 6:65; <i>Tzitz Eliezer</i> 15:30; <i>Divrei Yatziv</i>, OḤ 286; <i>Shevet Ha-Levi</i> 4:65; R.

                    "In the past, most people lived in single-story homes. A doorway led either to the street or to an enclosed courtyard with an exit to the street. The Sages ordained that people should light at the exit to the street, in order to publicize the miracle of Ḥanuka. They added that the candles should be lit to the left of the entranceway. This way, people passing through are surrounded by <i>mitzvot</i>, with the mezuza on the right and the candles on the left (<i>Shabbat</i> 22a).",
                    "The Sages further stated that ideally the menora should be placed no lower than three <i>tefaḥim</i> from the ground<i> </i>and no higher than ten <i>tefaḥim</i> from the ground (between 9 and 30 inches). The reason for this is that if it is placed higher than ten <i>tefaḥim</i>, people who see it would think it is meant to illuminate the entrance to the home, since when people used to light candles to illuminate their homes, they would place them in their entranceways at a height of above ten <i>tefaḥim</i>. However, if it is placed lower than three <i>tefaḥim</i>, which is very close to the ground, people would think that the candles were placed there only temporarily, and would soon be moved to an area that needs to be illuminated. Only when the menora is placed at a height between three and ten <i>tefaḥim</i> is it clear to all that it was lit to fulfill the mitzva, and in this way the miracle is publicized. In any case, <i>be-di’avad</i>, if one lights Ḥanuka candles lower than three <i>tefaḥim</i> or higher than ten <i>tefaḥim</i>, he has fulfilled his obligation. However, if one lights candles at the entrance to his home and places them higher than twenty <i>amot</i> (about 30 feet), he has not fulfilled his obligation.

Homes were built close together, many cities and courtyards were enclosed by a wall, and there were no strong winds blowing between the homes. Therefore, evidently, it was possible to light candles outside entranceways and courtyards without worrying that the candles would blow out. Today, though, when one lights candles outside, the wind usually blows them out. The only way to protect the candles is to light them in a glass box, like an aquarium.",
                    "However, the Sages never required people to buy glass boxes in order to fulfill the mitzva of lighting Ḥanuka candles. Therefore, one who does not wish to buy a glass box may light the candles inside his home. If he lights in a window facing the street, he beautifies the mitzva of publicizing the miracle to the same degree as one who lights in the entranceway, though he does not further beautify the mitzva by lighting on the left side of the entranceway and thus surrounding himself with <i>mitzvot</i> (the <i>mezuza</i> on the right and the candles on the left). Those who wish to beautify the mitzva to the greatest extent should buy a glass box and light outside the entranceway of the house on the left side. If several family members are lighting, as is the Ashkenazic custom (above, 12:3-4), they should make sure that every menora appears distinct, so that it is clear how many candles are lit on each day of Ḥanuka. Another possibility is for the other household members to light inside the home, at the window.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>She’elat Yaavetz</i> 1:149 states that it is preferable to light inside a glass box, and many Jerusalem residents have followed this practice. R. Zvi Pesaḥ Frank discusses this practice in <i>Mikra’ei Kodesh</i> §§16-17. However, even according to these authorities, there is no obligation to buy a glass box. AHS 671:24 states this explicitly, adding that lighting in a glass box makes the candles less visible (apparently glass at that time was not as transparent as it is today), and therefore it is customary to light inside, on the left side of the doorway.<br>We have already seen in <i>Shabbat</i> 21b that when it was dangerous to light outside, people lit on a table inside. However, even when the danger subsided, people continued lighting inside, to the left of the doorway. Thus states Rema 671:7. <i>Or Zaru’a</i> expresses surprise that once the danger had passed people did not go back to lighting outside. <i>Itur</i> explains that once people began lighting inside, the custom remained even after the danger had passed. Some continue this practice to the present time (<i>Minḥat Yitzḥak</i> 6:66; <i>Yemei Ha-Ḥanuka</i> 3:2; <i>Piskei Teshuvot</i> 671 n. 11). See also <i>Torat Ha-mo’adim</i> 3:4 which states that this is the custom of most Sephardic communities. Nevertheless, the most straightforward understanding of the Gemara and the Rishonim is that it is preferable to light outside the doorway of the home, or in a window facing the street. Both these options are supported by the Gemara in <i>Shabbat</i> 21b, and they both serve to publicize the miracle more effectively.</i>",
                    "In the past, many homes had walled courtyards, and people would exit to the street through a gate in the wall. In such a case, the courtyard was considered an extension of the home and the correct place to light was in the entranceway of the courtyard. In contrast, today’s front yards are not walled, and therefore the correct place to light is at the entranceway to the home itself.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rishonim disagree where one should light if he lives in a house with a front yard. According to Rashi, Ran, and others, he should light at the entranceway of the house. According to <i>Tosafot</i>, Rashba, and others, he should light at the entranceway of the yard. SA 671:5 rules in accordance with <i>Tosafot</i> without even mentioning Rashi’s position, to the surprise of AHS 671:20. (This topic is more complex than it seems; see <i>Berur Halakha</i> on <i>Shabbat</i> 21b and <i>Torat Ha-mo’adim</i> 3:2.) The accepted ruling in this case follows <i>Tosafot</i>’s position, as MB and BHL<i> </i>state. However, in practice, nowadays one should almost never light at the entranceway of the yard. There are a number of reasons for this: a) Today’s yards are usually not enclosed by a fence or gate. b) Some maintain that if an entranceway does not require a mezuza (such as if it does not have a lintel), one should not light there. (This is implied by Rabbeinu Yeruḥam, as cited in the end of <i>Darkhei Moshe</i> §671). c) Ḥazon Ish maintains that since today’s yards do not function as extensions of the home (as they are not used for laundering, cooking, and similar activities), one who lights Ḥanuka candles in the entranceway of such a courtyard has not fulfilled his obligation to light in his home. (See <i>Az Nidberu</i> 5:39.)<br>Nevertheless, some contemporary <i>poskim</i> rule that one should light candles at the entranceway of one’s yard. In any case, since in practice everyone agrees that lighting in the entranceway of the house fulfills the obligation, there is no reason to court uncertainty by lighting at the entrance of the yard.<br>The Sages state that if one’s home has two entrances on different sides, he should light at both entrances, so that household members are not suspected of neglecting the mitzva (<i>Shabbat</i> 23a; SA 671:8). However, as we saw in the previous note, nowadays many people light inside. Therefore, it is not necessary to light at both entrances, because there is no concern that neglecting to do so will arouse suspicion.

                    "In some homes, the entranceway is not clearly visible to many people on the street, while lighting in the window would be more clearly visible from the street. Some maintain that, in such a case, it is still preferable to light in the entranceway, as doing so follows the Sages’ original enactment, so that one who enters the home will be surrounded by <i>mitzvot</i>. Others maintain that lighting in the window is preferable in this case, since the primary reason for the enactment is to publicize the miracle, and more people will see the candles if they are lit in the window. In practice, it seems that the mitzva is rendered more beautiful when one lights in the window. However, there is also an advantage to lighting in the entranceway.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the entranceway of the home is on the side and not so visible from the street, it would seem preferable to light in a window facing the street because the rules concerning where to light revolve around the fundamental value of publicizing the miracle (SHT 671:30; <i>Igrot Moshe, </i>OḤ 4:125). Some maintain that lighting to the left of the doorway is still the best option, as being surrounded by <i>mitzvot</i> has kabbalistic significance. In my humble opinion, publicizing the miracle takes precedence. Even if the window facing the street is over ten <i>tefaḥim</i> high, it is still preferable to light there in order to publicize the miracle (see n. 5 below).</i>"

The best place for them to light is in a window facing the street or on a porch facing the street, as this is the most effective way of publicizing the miracle. Those who light in the window must make sure that both household members and passersby can see the candles. Therefore, one should not use a menora that has a back that blocks the view of the candles from either side.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the only menora in one’s possession has a back that blocks the candles from view on either side, one should place it perpendicular to the window, so that it will be visible from one side of the house and one side of the street.</i>",
                    "Even when the window facing the street is higher than ten <i>tefaḥim</i> (c. 30 inches), one should still light there, because it is more important to publicize the miracle to passersby than to be meticulous about lighting the candles lower than ten <i>tefaḥim</i>.<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Yosef Karo in SA 676:1 rules that it is a mitzva to place the candles lower than ten <i>tefaḥim</i>. However in his <i>Beit Yosef</i>, he acknowledges that according to Rif and Rambam this is not a mitzva. Nevertheless, according to Rabbeinu Ḥananel, Rosh, Ran, and most Rishonim it is indeed a mitzva (following the Gemara’s conclusion in <i>Shabbat</i> 21b). In any case, it is clear that <i>be-di’avad</i>, one who lights the candles higher than ten <i>tefaḥim</i> has fulfilled his obligation. MA 671:5 states that even if the window is higher than ten <i>tefaḥim</i>, he should still light there. Similarly, SHT 671:30 points out that the Gemara explicitly emphasizes the importance of publicizing the miracle. As the Sages stated, the mitzva of lighting Ḥanuka candles applies “until the Tarmodians have departed” (see section 6 below). This is why they enacted that one must light the candles outside the entranceway of the home.</i>",

Although one who chooses to light this way certainly fulfills his obligation, it is nevertheless better to light in the window facing the street, to publicize the miracle.<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Contemporary halakhic works contain lengthy discussions about the best way to light in apartment buildings. There are three primary positions, which I will briefly summarize here: a) One should light at the entrance to the building, as practiced by several contemporary authorities. Others disagree, maintaining that one who lights there has not fulfilled his obligation because they view this case as comparable to lighting in the entrance to an alleyway (<i>mavoi</i>), rather than the entrance to a courtyard (based on Ḥazon Ish). Furthermore, according to Rashi, even if this is considered the entrance to a courtyard, it may be that one does not fulfill his obligation by lighting there (see n. 2 above). b) One should light outside the door that opens to the hallway, so that people walking there will see the candles. Some light inside the doorway on the left side, as this has been a common practice for many generations (as mentioned in n. 1 above), in order to be surrounded by <i>mitzvot</i>. c) Some maintain that it is preferable to light in the window, as this publicizes the miracle most effectively. This accords with the simple meaning of the Sages’ statement: “One who lives on an upper floor places [the menora] in the window facing the street” (<i>Shabbat</i> 21b).<br>In practice, one should not follow the first option, since some maintain that one cannot fulfill the obligation this way. All agree that one can fulfill his obligation by following the second or third option. It is best to light in the window, since publicizing the miracle is more important than beautifying the mitzva by lighting to the left of the doorway. This is the position of many authorities, including MA, SHT 671:30, and <i>Igrot Moshe,</i> OḤ 4:125. For those who follow Ashkenazic custom – that multiple family members light candles – it is preferable for one of them to light to the left of the doorway, thus beautifying the mitzva according to all the opinions.</i>",
                    "Even if the apartment is on an upper floor and the window is higher than twenty <i>amot</i> (c. 30 feet), as long as passersby can see the candles through the window it would seem that it is preferable to light there in order to publicize the miracle. However, if one wishes, he may light in the hallway right outside the apartment door, as this publicizes the miracle somewhat as well. Even if he lights the candles inside his home, he has fulfilled his obligation.<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the window is higher than twenty <i>amot</i> (c. 30 feet) from the street, it would seem at first glance that there is no reason to light in the window. Since it is so high that people are not likely to see it, the miracle is not publicized, and thus one does not fulfill the obligation by lighting there. Rather, one should light to the left of the doorway. Several contemporary <i>poskim</i> rule this way. Nevertheless, all agree that one who lights at the window fulfills his obligation, since the menora is less than twenty <i>amot </i>high from the perspective of those inside the apartment. Thus, if one knows that passersby on the street do indeed see the candles in the window, it would seem that it is preferable to light there. This is implied by SHT 671:42 and stated explicitly by <i>Shevet Ha-Levi</i> 4:65. There are a few reasons for this preference: a) According to the opinion of R. Yoel cited in <i>Tur</i>, if the wall of the house starting from the ground reaches the candles, then one may light even above twenty <i>amot</i> (meaning that one who lives in a ground-floor apartment may light the candles at the top of the wall above him).<i> </i>If so, there is value to publicizing the miracle according to his opinion. b) <i>Pri Megadim</i> (end of <i>Mishbetzot</i> <i>Zahav</i> 671:105) states that even when one lights above twenty <i>amot</i>, passersby still notice the candles to some extent. (Thus, if one is already fulfilling the mitzva by the fact that the candles are lower than twenty <i>amot </i>for the household members, there is some additional value to publicizing the miracle – albeit slightly – to the outside world.) c) Some add another rationale: that residents in the other tall apartment buildings facing one’s own building can indeed see the candles that one lights in the window.<br>Despite all this, when the window of one’s home is over twenty <i>amot</i> high, the opinion that gives preference to lighting in the hallway right outside the apartment door is more understandable. However, even if one lights inside the apartment he fulfills his obligation, as explained in n. 1.</i>"

                    "The Sages ordained that one must light the Ḥanuka candles when the miracle will be publicized most effectively. In the past, when there were no street lights, at nightfall the streets would fill with people returning home from their daily activities. Therefore, the Sages declared that the proper time to light the candles is “from sunset<i> </i>until the marketplace empties out” (<i>Shabbat</i> 21b).The Rishonim disagree whether “sunset”<i> </i>here refers to the beginning of sunset, meaning when the sun disappears from view, or to the end of sunset, meaning when the sunlight disappears from view as well and the stars become visible. On one hand, at the beginning of sunset the streets are more crowded. On the other hand, since there is still a relatively large amount of sunlight at that time, the candles are less visible. Therefore, it is better to wait until <i>tzeit</i> <i>ha-kokhavim</i> to light. Indeed, the widespread practice in Israel is to light at <i>tzeit</i>, which is<i> </i>about twenty minutes after <i>shki’a</i> in Israel.<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The phrase used in <i>Shabbat</i> 21b to refer to sunset is <i>mi-shetishka ha-ḥama</i>. According to <i>Behag</i>, Rambam, and Maharam of Rothenburg, this means the beginning of <i>shki’a</i> (i.e., when the sun disappears below the horizon). Maharam explains that if we light when there is still sunlight visible, those who see the candles understand that they were lit in order to fulfill a mitzva, and the miracle is publicized. Ran and Rashba agree that the Gemara refers to the beginning of <i>shki’a</i>, but they follow the position of Rabbeinu Tam that it is referring to the “second sunset,” 58.5 minutes (the time it takes to walk three and a quarter <i>mil</i>) after sunset. According to Rabbeinu Tam, Rosh, <i>Terumat Ha-deshen</i>, <i>Tur</i>, and SA 672:1, as well as most Aḥaronim (MB <i>ad loc.</i> 1 and <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> <i>ad loc.</i> 2), the Gemara refers to the end of sunset, or <i>tzeit ha-kokhavim</i>. That time is debated as well. The Rishonim disagree how much time separates <i>shki’a</i> from <i>tzeit</i>. The Ge’onim maintain that the time between <i>shki’a </i>and <i>tzeit </i>is slightly longer than the time it takes to walk three quarters of a <i>mil</i>; according to Rabbeinu Tam, though, it is the time that it takes to walk four <i>mil</i>, which is 72 minutes. See SA 261:2 and the commentaries there, especially BHL. (Also see <i>Peninei Halakha</i>:<i> Shabbat</i> 1:2:1 and n. 1). In practice, the standard ruling here is in accordance with the Ge’onim.<br>The vast majority of Aḥaronim maintain that the best time to light Ḥanuka candles is at the end of <i>shki’a</i>, when the stars are visible – in other words, <i>tzeit</i> <i>ha-kokhavim</i>. This is the position of <i>Baḥ</i>, MA, <i>Taz</i>, <i>Eliya Rabba</i>, <i>Ḥayei Adam</i>, <i>Ben Ish Ḥai</i>, and others. (The Prushim community in Jerusalem follow the Vilna Gaon, who writes in <i>Bi’ur Ha-Gra</i> 672:1 that one should light at sunset.) See <i>Peninei Halakha</i>: <i>Prayer</i> ch. 25 n. 3, where I point out that many consider <i>tzeit</i> to be about twenty minutes after <i>shki’a</i>. (Regarding <i>Keri’at Shema</i>, which is a Torah obligation, I recommend waiting thirty minutes. However, since lighting Ḥanuka candles is a rabbinic obligation, one need wait only twenty minutes from sunset. Some maintain that <i>tzeit</i> is about fifteen minutes after sunset.) A comparison of the positions of the Rishonim shows that twenty minutes is an intermediate position. Rambam maintains that one should light at sunset, Ran and Rashba maintain that one should light about 58 minutes after sunset, and Rabbeinu Tam maintains that one should light about 72 minutes after sunset. Accordingly, the view that one should light at <i>tzeit</i>, which in Israel is about twenty minutes after sunset, is the intermediate position. (If the candles remain lit until 52 minutes after <i>tzeit</i>, one meets the requirements of all the different positions.)</i>",
                    "Another issue that arises, however, is that men are obligated to pray <i>Ma’ariv</i>, and many regularly do so immediately at <i>tzeit</i>. For these men, praying <i>Ma’ariv</i> takes precedence over lighting Ḥanuka candles, since the former is a more constant practice than the latter. Additionally, by praying <i>Ma’ariv </i>they also fulfill the Torah commandment to recite<i> </i>the <i>Shema</i> in the evening. After praying, they should return home quickly, in order to light as close as possible to <i>tzeit</i>. Those who usually pray <i>Ma’ariv</i> later should light candles at <i>tzeit</i> and pray at their usual time.<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to those who maintain that one should light at <i>tzeit</i>, <i>Ma’ariv</i> takes precedence. According to MB 672:1 and BHL <i>ad loc.</i>, if one prays <i>Ma’ariv</i> at <i>tzeit</i>, it is preferable to light the candles beforehand, in deference to the opinion that one should light at sunset. Furthermore, according to Rambam, one must light within half an hour after <i>shki’a</i>. If one waits to light until after praying <i>Ma’ariv</i> at <i>tzeit</i>, he will miss the opportunity to light at the proper time. Even those who maintain that one should light at <i>tzeit</i> agree that one may light a few minutes before then. Nevertheless, most Aḥaronim maintain that <i>tzeit</i> is the proper time to light, and thus praying <i>Ma’ariv</i> at <i>tzeit</i> takes precedence over lighting. They are not concerned about the opinion that one must light within half an hour after <i>shki’a</i>, since after <i>Ma’ariv</i> there are still people in the streets. Furthermore, as we saw in the previous note, the other opinion maintains that the ideal time to light is <i>tzeit</i>, not sunset<i> </i>(Ran, Rashba, Rabbeinu Tam, and others). We should add that many families sing Ḥanuka songs and give the children candy after lighting candles, in order to deepen their connection to the mitzva and the miracle of Ḥanuka. If their father were required to run to the synagogue immediately after lighting, it would diminish their enjoyment of the mitzva. If one always prays <i>Ma’ariv </i>late, there is no reason to change his practice on Ḥanuka. In fact, adhering to this practice will enable him to light precisely at <i>tzeit</i> (<i>Yeshu’ot Yaakov</i> 679:1).</i>",
                    "Even though one fulfills one’s obligation as long as the Ḥanuka candles remain lit for half an hour, some say that nowadays, when people regularly walk through the streets well beyond <i>tzeit</i>, it is preferable to beautify the mitzva by lighting candles that will remain lit for two hours or more. They contend that this is a commendable practice because the more people that see the candles, the more the miracle will be publicized.<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The candles must be lit “from sunset until the marketplace empties out.” The Rishonim explain that this means about half an hour, and this is the ruling of SA 672:2. <i>Otzar Ha-Ge’onim</i> (<i>Shabbat</i>, <i>Teshuvot</i> §65) states that it means an hour or half an hour.

However, on Friday evening, obviously one may not light candles after sunset, since Shabbat begins at sunset, and on Shabbat one may not light a fire. In addition, one should not light immediately before sunset because of the mitzva of <i>tosefet Shabbat</i>, which dictates that we begin Shabbat a bit early in order to extend the sanctity of Shabbat into the mundane week. In practice, most Israeli communities accept Shabbat about twenty minutes before sunset, and, accordingly, this is the Shabbat candle-lighting time that appears on Israeli calendars. On Shabbat Ḥanuka, one must light the Ḥanuka candles before lighting the Shabbat candles.<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The custom in <b>Jerusalem</b> is normally to light Shabbat candles forty minutes before sunset.

Therefore, the Sages stated that the mitzva to light Ḥanuka candles extends “from sunset<i> </i>until the marketplace empties out.” The expression “until the marketplace empties out” refers to the time when the poor people who would collect leftover food from the market stalls would return to their homes (<i>Shabbat</i> 21b). This was about half an hour after lighting time (Rif).",
                    "Nowadays, when there is electric lighting and most people continue working for several hours after dark, the best time to light is still the time that the Sages ordained – from <i>tzeit</i> until half an hour afterward. ",
                    "However, if one finds it difficult to return home by <i>tzeit</i>, he may light later. One should try to return home as soon as possible, in order to light close to the ideal time ordained by the Sages. Specifically, one should make an effort not to light later than 9 PM. Until then, it is standard for people to come home from work, so this period of the evening is still considered “until the marketplace empties out” (see n. 13 below). One should make sure not to eat a meal, meaning a <i>keveitza </i>of bread or <i>mezonot</i>, until after lighting (MB 672:10 and 431:6; above 12:13).",

In such a case, it is preferable to hold the class as usual, and the attendees should light Ḥanuka candles afterward, because the mitzva of Torah study takes precedence over the value of lighting candles at the ideal time (see n. 13)."

                    "In many families, the question arises as to the appropriate procedure when one’s spouse cannot make it home from work by <i>tzeit</i>. Is it better to light at <i>tzeit</i> or to wait for his or her return?",
                    "Technically, it is not necessary for both spouses to be present for candle-lighting. When either one of them lights candles in their home, they have both fulfilled their obligation. Therefore, it would seem preferable for one to light at <i>tzeit</i>. Nevertheless, in practice it is preferable in most cases to wait for the spouse to return home. In general, there are three primary considerations that would lead us to delay candle-lighting until both spouses are home.",
                    "First, if the husband will not hear the <i>berakhot </i>of candle-lighting at the synagogue or elsewhere, although he will have fulfilled the obligation to light through his wife’s lighting, some maintain that as long as he has not heard the <i>berakha</i> of <i>She-asa Nisim</i>, he has not fulfilled his duty to thank God. Therefore, if there is nowhere else for him to hear the <i>berakhot</i>, it is preferable to wait for him. (The same is true if the wife is not home at <i>tzeit</i>, and the husband is waiting.)",
                    "Second, the husband or wife may feel insulted or upset if the candles were lit without them. ",
                    "Third, there may be a concern that the connection of the absent spouse to the mitzva will be weakened. This consideration is pertinent when one spouse regularly comes home late from work. If one will not be present for candle-lighting on all or most of the days of the holiday, one’s connection to the mitzva is liable to be weakened.",
                    "This third consideration is particularly significant for families that follow the Sephardic custom (above, 12:3), according to which only one member of each household lights. When there is concern that if the parents do not wait for their children to return home for lighting, the children’s connection to the mitzva may weaken, the parents should wait for them.",
                    "Thus, the only case in which it is preferable to light the candles at <i>tzeit</i> is if the delayed husband or wife will be able to hear the <i>berakhot</i> elsewhere and if this delay is an isolated occurrence and will therefore not cause marital discord or weaken the absent spouse’s bond to the mitzva. In all other cases, it is better to wait for both spouses – and in the case of Sephardim, for all members of the household – to be home. However, even then, candle-lighting should not be delayed past 9 PM. Members of the household should not eat a proper meal from half an hour before <i>tzeit</i> until after they have fulfilled the mitzva of candle-lighting (as explained above, 12:10).<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See n. 13. The baseline <i>halakha</i> is explained in <i>Baḥ</i> 675:2 and 677:3, as well as <i>Yeḥaveh Da’at</i> 3:51. However, there are three considerations that should be taken into account: a) If the household member arriving late will not hear the <i>berakhot</i> over the candles, it is questionable whether he has fulfilled his obligation of thanking God. According to Rashi, Rambam, <i>Mordechai</i>, and others, in order to fulfill his obligation completely he must recite the <i>berakha</i> of <i>She-asa Nisim</i> over candles that he sees in the street. However, in practice, he should not make this <i>berakha</i>, because of the principle that one does not recite a <i>berakha</i> if it is uncertain whether it is needed (as explained above, ch. 12 n. 4). It would seem that it is more important to fulfill the obligation along with the <i>berakhot</i>, according to all opinions, rather than to light on time, at <i>tzeit</i>. b) If not waiting would adversely affect marital harmony, it is better to wait until the husband or wife returns home. c) Publicizing the miracle is a fundamental part of the mitzva, and first and foremost one must publicize the mitzva for one’s family members. In my humble opinion, it is preferable to go above and beyond in publicizing the miracle for the family, rather than in lighting at <i>tzeit</i>. It is well known that many great Ḥasidic rabbis light late in order to inculcate the value of this mitzva in people’s hearts. We can learn from them that it is proper to delay candle-lighting for an educational reason. Therefore, I wrote in the main text that if the delay is a one-time event, the wife may light on time in the absence of her husband or vice versa. However, if it is a regular occurrence, she should wait to light with her husband. Otherwise, his connection to the mitzva will likely be weakened. For those who follow <b>Ashkenazic custom </b>(see 12:4), the first consideration can be addressed if the wife lights on time, and her husband has in mind not to fulfill his obligation through her lighting. Later, when he gets home, he can light with the <i>berakhot</i>. (The same applies if the wife is not home at <i>tzeit</i>, and the husband is waiting.) However, if this will lead to hurt feelings, or if the family’s relationship to the mitzva will suffer, it is better that they all light together when the spouse arrives.</i>"

                    "One who was unable to light Ḥanuka candles by 9 PM may light all night until dawn. However, he should recite the <i>berakhot </i>only if it is very likely that someone on the street will see his candles, or if someone at home, such as his wife or children, will see them. If, however, his family members have gone to sleep and would be upset if he were to wake them, and if it is unlikely that anyone will see his candles from the street, he should light without <i>berakhot</i>.<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shabbat</i> 21b states that the time for candle-lighting is “until the marketplace empties out.” The Rishonim explain that this is half an hour after candle-lighting time. They disagree about whether one may light later than this. MT, Laws of Ḥanuka 4:5 states that there is no mitzva to light later (and <i>Behag</i> and others rule likewise). Others maintain that the Gemara is describing the ideal time; <i>be-di’avad</i>, however, one may light all night, even though one publicizes the miracle less when lighting late at night (Rashba, Rabbeinu Yeruḥam, and others). Some suggest that the dispute hinges on a debate between the two explanations given in the Gemara. Since the mitzva is rabbinic, the <i>halakha</i> follows the lenient opinion. Thus, <i>be-di’avad</i>, one may light all night (Raavya in the name of Rabbeinu Tam; this seems to be the opinion of Rosh as well; SA 672:2). Many Rishonim maintain that even the stringent opinion would agree that when people light inside and the miracle is publicized for the family members whenever the lighting takes place, one may light all night long, even after the marketplace has emptied out. This is the opinion of <i>Tosafot</i>, Rashba, Ran, Rosh, <i>Sefer Ha-teruma</i>, and many others. Rema 672:2 agrees as well. Nevertheless, Rema adds that it is preferable to light at the time the Sages instituted. In a time of need, one may light later in accordance with the vast majority of <i>poskim</i>, as I wrote in the previous section and in n. 12.<br>SA implies that one who lights late may recite the <i>berakhot</i> all night. This is surprising, as it seemingly would have been proper to take into consideration Rambam’s position that one may not light late, and rule that one should not recite the <i>berakhot </i>due to uncertainty. However, there are several uncertainties at play in this case: a) perhaps the <i>halakha</i> follows the second explanation in the Gemara, and even <i>le-khatḥila</i> one may light all night; b) perhaps even according to the first explanation, <i>be-di’avad</i> the <i>berakhot</i> may be recited all night; c) perhaps when lighting inside, it is acceptable to light all night. Additionally, the custom in the past was to recite the <i>berakhot</i> even when lighting late. Indeed, according to <i>Pri Ḥadash</i>, <i>Ḥemed Moshe</i>, and others, <i>be-di’avad</i>, even if no one else will see the candles, one recites the <i>berakhot </i>when lighting. This is because they maintain that, <i>be-di’avad</i>, one may light all night. They claim further that lighting late at night is similar to the case of a person who lives in an isolated area, in which all agree that he may light with the <i>berakhot</i> at the beginning of the night, because that is the time the Sages ordained for lighting. This is the view of <i>Igrot Moshe</i>, OḤ 4:105:7 (SHT 672:17 states that one does not need to object if people rely on this leniency). However, in practice many Aḥaronim maintain that once the marketplace has emptied out, one may make the <i>berakhot</i> only if the miracle will actually be publicized to others. MA 672:6 rules accordingly, as does MB <i>ad loc.</i> 11. The plural phrase “members of the household” implies that there must be at least two additional people there (<i>Ben Ish Ḥai</i>, Year 1, <i>Hilkhot Ḥanuka </i>7 [Vayeshev]). However, according to AHS 672:7, as long as there is one additional person, even a child who only partially understands, one may recite the <i>berakhot</i>. This is what I wrote in the main text, as it is the intermediate position.<br>An additional strong rationale for permitting lighting late appears in the newer edition of Ritva, which states that the law follows local norms. If so, now that we have electric lights, the appropriate time to light extends later than it once did. This can be explained in one of two ways. The first approach is that the time when “the marketplace empties out” refers to when people return home latest from work. This seems to be the opinion of <i>Shiltei Giborim</i>. Nowadays, this is about 9 PM. The second approach is that everything depends upon publicizing the miracle, so if people are still out on the streets late at night, the marketplace has not yet emptied out, and one may still light candles with the <i>berakhot</i>. This seems to be the opinion of Maharshal (<i>Responsa</i> <i>Maharshal</i> §85), who writes that one may publicize the miracle until midnight. <i>Sefat Emet</i> states this as well. In practice, as I wrote at the end of section 7, in a time of need one may delay the lighting until 9 PM, but no later. Since that is when people who work late are coming home, this approach fits best with the idea of the marketplace emptying out. Furthermore, since people sometimes delay dinner until then, there is no great concern that they will forget to light. It should be emphasized that for purpose of making a living, which is considered a great need, it is proper to delay lighting, but for other purposes it is not. In my humble opinion, since people are still returning from work at that time, one may light candles with the <i>berakhot</i> then, even if no one else will see the candles. In a time of need, if one wants to delay lighting later than 9 PM but while there are still people in the street next to his home, he has an opinion to rely upon, but, in my opinion, this should not be done except in pressing circumstances.</i>",

Therefore, if an unmarried person has his own home, regardless of whether it is owned or rented, he must light candles there. If he is visiting friends at candle-lighting time but will return home to sleep, he cannot fulfill his obligation at his hosts’ home. Rather, he must return home to light. (See sections 6-8 above for the proper times to light candles, <i>le-khatḥila</i> and <i>be-di’avad</i>.)",
                    "If an unmarried person will be staying for the night as well, his status depends on where he is sleeping. If he will be sleeping in the hosts’ home, he should pay the host the value of a <i>pruta </i>toward the cost of the candles (or the host may give him a share in the candles as a gift) and he can fulfill his obligation through the host’s lighting.

According to <i>Ginat Veradim</i> (cited in <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 677:3), as long as the guests are completely dependent on their hosts, there is no need to pay the value of a <i>pruta </i>toward the cost of the candles, because we can assume the hosts give them a share in the candles as a gift. However, according to many Aḥaronim, including MB 677:1, the guests should still contribute the value of a <i>pruta </i>or otherwise acquire a share in the candles. The only case in which they do not need to do so is if they are permanently dependent on the host, as is the case with live-in workers. Even if the guest is one of the homeowner’s children, and thus there is good reason to claim that he is considered a part of the family, since the guest is an independent adult, it is proper for him to pay toward the cost of the candles and meet the requirements of the more stringent position on the matter.</i>"

                    "A yeshiva student who sleeps in his dormitory room and eats in a cafeteria must light in his room, because he resides there for an extended period and the room is set aside for him. If the dormitory room has a window facing the street, he should light in the window to publicize the miracle. If there is no window facing the street, he should light inside his room, preferably to the left of the doorway, so that the <i>mezuza</i> will be on the right and the Ḥanuka candles on the left.<sup>21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yeshiva students must light on their own because they are independent. Even if we claim that they are considered dependent on their parents or on the yeshiva, according to the Ashkenazic version of the custom of <i>mehadrin min ha-mehadrin</i>, each individual must light independently in order to beautify the mitzva. The students fulfill their obligation by lighting in any place in the yeshiva, whether it is in their dormitory rooms or in the cafeteria, just as they would fulfill their obligation by lighting in any place in their homes (<i>Halikhot Shlomo</i> 14:8). The question is: where is it preferable for them to light? According to most <i>poskim</i>, it is preferable for them to light in their rooms, although Rema 677:1 states that in general it is preferable to light where one eats. Ḥazon Ish agrees that it is preferable to light in the cafeteria. Nevertheless, according to most <i>poskim</i>, it is preferable for them to light in their dormitory rooms. The cafeteria is a communal area like a restaurant, while the dormitory room is designated for personal use. <i>Poskim</i> who rule this way include <i>Minḥat Yitzḥak</i> 7:48, <i>Shevet Ha-Levi</i> 3:89, and <i>Az Nidberu</i> 5:38. This was also the custom at Yeshivat Mercaz HaRav when I studied there. (Some of the students were stringent and would eat the main meal of each day of Ḥanuka in their dormitory rooms, such that all opinions would agree that this is the proper place to light) According to <i>Igrot Moshe</i>, OḤ 4:70:3, <i>Halikhot Shlomo</i> 14:8, and R. Mordechai Eliyahu, it is preferable to light in a window or on a porch facing the street. According to my teacher and master, R. Shaul Yisraeli, it is best to light in the hall to the left of the doorway, because the hall is comparable to a public area. In any case, even if one lights on a table in one’s dormitory room, one fulfills his obligation.</i>",
                    "An uncertainty arises regarding Sephardic students. According to Sephardic custom, the way to beautify the mitzva is for the head of the household to light for the entire household. Furthermore, according to many <i>poskim</i>, the true home of a yeshiva student is his parents’ home, even though he lives at the yeshiva. His parents’ home is where he returns regularly, and where he goes when he is sick. Therefore, even when he is at the yeshiva, he fulfills his obligation to light through his father’s lighting at home.",
                    "On the other hand, some maintain that since the student lives in the yeshiva most of the year, he is considered an independent person with his own home, and thus he must light candles in the yeshiva with the <i>berakhot</i>. Following Sephardic custom, one student should light for himself and all his roommates. The roommates who do not light must either pay the value of a <i>pruta </i>toward the cost of the candles or acquire a share in them.<sup>22</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>The Sephardic custom: </b>The rationale of the position that a yeshiva student fulfills his obligation through his father’s lighting is explained in the main text. Since he has already fulfilled his obligation when his father lit, according to Sephardic custom he may not light candles with the <i>berakhot</i> at the yeshiva. This is similar to the law that we discussed in n. 18 regarding a married man whose wife is lighting for him at home. This is the opinion of R. Ovadia Yosef, R. Mordechai Eliyahu, R. Shaul Yisraeli, R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, and many others. <i>Yeḥaveh Da’at</i> 6:43 and <i>Torat Ha-mo’adim</i> 2:4 present two additional rationales for why Sephardic yeshiva students may not light independently. First, even if students are not considered dependent on their parents, the entire yeshiva is considered one family, all of whose members are dependent on the <i>rosh yeshiva</i>. Second, every student fulfills his obligation through the lighting that takes place in the <i>beit midrash</i>. Unlike the lighting that takes place in the synagogue (which does not fulfill one’s personal obligation), the <i>beit midrash</i> is considered the home of the students. This is the reason that students may eat and drink in the <i>beit midrash</i> throughout the year. Following this reasoning, there is no need for a yeshiva student to light in his dormitory room. Nevertheless, R. Eliyahu maintains that one student should light in each room without reciting the <i>berakhot</i>. If an Ashkenazic student is lighting there with the <i>berakhot</i>, his Sephardic roommates should contribute to the cost of the candles. There is also a debate about a student whose parents are abroad. R. Eliyahu ruled that in such a case, the student should light with the <i>berakhot</i>, because he is not considered dependent upon them, whereas <i>Yeḥaveh Da’at</i> and <i>Halikhot Shlomo</i> 14:12 state that he does not need to light (perhaps because he fulfills his obligation through the lighting in the <i>beit midrash</i>).<br>In contrast, R. Shalom Messas and R. Avraham Shapira maintain that even Sephardic students must light candles in the yeshiva. In each dormitory room, at least one person must light and recite the <i>berakhot</i>, while everyone else may contribute to the cost of the candles (see above, 12:3). This opinion is described in <i>Hilkhot Ḥag Be-ḥag</i> 4:4, and is cited in <i>Yemei Hallel Ve-hoda’ah </i>36:1 in the name of R. Yosef Shalom Elyashiv. It fits with the simple meaning of the statement in <i>Shabbat</i> 21a that R. Zeira was obligated to light candles himself before he was married. According to this opinion, the candles lit in the <i>beit midrash</i> are not enough for a student to fulfill his obligation through them, because that lighting is similar to the lighting in the synagogue, which is not done to fulfill any obligation. One could argue that this issue should depend upon the attitude of the yeshiva. If the yeshiva sees itself as responsible for all of its students’ needs, then all the students are considered one family whose members fulfill their obligation through the lighting in the <i>beit midrash</i>. On the other hand, most yeshivas consider their students responsible for themselves, while the yeshiva simply helps them by providing room and board. In such a case, the students’ dorm rooms are considered their homes, and it is there that they must light. This is especially applicable when the <i>beit midrash</i> and the dormitory rooms are located in separate buildings. Then the students should certainly not rely on the lighting in the <i>beit midrash</i>. <b>In my humble opinion, </b>when young men and women are studying in institutes of higher education where the students are generally over the age of eighteen, the students are considered independent, and even according to Sephardic practice they must light themselves with the <i>berakhot</i>. The same applies to soldiers, as described in <i>Shabbat U-mo’ed Be-Tzahal</i>, p. 336. Nevertheless, it would seem that even according to this position, when a Sephardic student returns home he is not viewed as a guest, but rather as one who is completely dependent on his parents. Accordingly, he fulfills his obligation through his father’s lighting, and is not even required to contribute the value of a <i>pruta </i>to the cost of the candles, as explained in MB 677:1 and <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 677:3. Students who live at home but stay overnight at their yeshiva on Ḥanuka are considered dependent on their parents, and according to Sephardic custom do not need to light in their dormitory room.<br>It is uncertain whether the student who lights the candles in the <i>beit midrash</i> needs to light again in his room. However, if he lights first in his room, he may certainly light in the <i>beit midrash</i> with the <i>berakhot</i>. In our yeshiva, we make a point of appointing a Sephardic student, who normally relies on the lighting of his parents or roommate, to light in the <i>beit midrash</i>, thus giving him an opportunity to recite the <i>berakhot</i>.</i>",
                    "The laws that apply to a yeshiva student also apply to soldiers and college students. According to the custom of all Ashkenazim and some Sephardim, a soldier or a college student should light in his room with the <i>berakhot</i>. The custom of most Sephardim is that such a person relies on his parents’ lighting. If no one else is lighting in the dorm room, he should light without a <i>berakha</i>. ",
                    "The same pertains to female students studying at seminaries or universities, who live in a dormitory or in a rented apartment. The custom of all Ashkenazim and some Sephardim is to light with the <i>berakhot</i>, and the custom of most Sephardim is to rely on their parents’ lighting. If no one else is lighting in the dormitory room, they should light without the <i>berakhot</i>.<sup>23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On one hand, unmarried women are more likely to be dependent on their parents than unmarried men are. On the other hand, young women who study in universities often support themselves, and thus are considered more independent than others. Therefore, they may be compared to yeshiva students. The more independent they are, the more reasonable it is to say that they must light in their apartment with the <i>berakhot</i>, even according to Sephardic custom.</i>"

Although the reading of the Torah every Shabbat, Monday, and Thursday was instituted in the time of Moshe, the division of the Torah into 54 portions, to allow it to be read in its entirety over the course of a year, took place much later. In the time of the Amora’im, the Jewish community in Babylonia followed this practice, but the Jews of Eretz Yisrael would complete the Torah every three years instead of every year. However, the institution of the Four <i>Parshiyot</i> and the special readings for the holidays are mentioned already in the Mishna and the Talmud (<i>Megilla</i> 29a-30b).<br>Reading <i>Parashat Zakhor</i> is a Torah commandment, as we will explain below, in section 6. Some maintain that <i>Parashat Para</i> is also a Torah commandment, as SA 146:2, 685:7 states.

In order to keep the lunar months in sync with the solar year, leap years, in which an extra month is intercalated, must be declared occasionally. This means that some years have thirteen months. The only month that may be intercalated is the second Adar, meaning that Nisan is postponed to ensure that it coincides with spring. In the past, a <i>beit din</i> would decide on leap years based on agricultural concerns and astronomical calculations. Today, however, since we do not have a court with the power to declare months and years, the Sages established a fixed cycle of nineteen years, of which twelve are ordinary years and seven are leap years.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Twelve lunar months add up to 354 days (plus 8 hours, 48 minutes, and about 40 seconds). A solar year, on the other hand, contains 365 days (plus 5 hours, 55 minutes, and about 25 seconds). The following years in the nineteen-year cycle are leap years: 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, 19.

                    "Moreover, the Sages statement about increasing joy when Adar arrives implies that Adar I ushers in joy (observance of a bar mitzva or <i>yahrzeit </i>is discussed in the footnote).<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Mishna states, “There is no difference between Adar I and Adar II except the [<i>mitzvot </i>of] reading the <i>megilla</i> and giving gifts to the poor” (<i>Megilla </i>6b). The Gemara adds the Four <i>Parshiyot</i> to this list. This implies that the two months are equal with regard to rejoicing. One can also infer this from MA and the Vilna Gaon on OḤ 568:7. MB 697:4 states that one need not enhance his meal on the fifteenth of Adar I in walled cities, but <i>Minḥat Yitzḥak</i> 10:58 states that one should enhance his meal on that day in Jerusalem.<br><b>Bar Mitzva</b>: Since Adar II is the primary month of the two, one who was born in Adar on an ordinary year becomes a bar mitzva in Adar II, if that year happens to be a leap year.

According to Ashkenazic custom, however, it is observed during Adar I, to avoid postponing the mitzva. According to this approach, Adar II is the primary month only with regard to Purim and the Four <i>Parshiyot</i>, not for other matters. Moreover, since Adar II is more joyous, as it is the month in which we celebrate Purim, it is more appropriate to remember the dead in Adar I. Some Ashkenazim are stringent and observe the <i>yahrzeit</i> twice (SA, Rema 568:7, MB <i>ad loc. </i>41). An Ashkenazic Jew who adopted a custom to fast in honor of a <i>yahrzeit</i> in both months of Adar should continue his practice. Similarly, MA and MB <i>ad loc. </i>42 state that one who took an explicit oath to fast on a <i>yahrzeit</i> that falls out in the month of Adar must fast on both months of Adar during a leap year.

The first is a positive commandment to remember what Amalek did to us, as the Torah says: “Remember what Amalek did to you on your journey, as you left Egypt” (Devarim 25:17). The second is a negative commandment not to forget what Amalek did to us, as the Torah says: “Do not forget” (<i>ibid</i>. 19). The third is a positive commandment to eradicate Amalek’s offspring from the world, as the Torah says: “Therefore, when the Lord your God grants you safety from all your enemies around you, in the land that the Lord your God is giving you as a hereditary portion, you shall blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven” (<i>ibid</i>.).",
                    "Amalek symbolizes the root of evil in the world. Indeed, Amalek introduced the concept of Jew- hatred to the world. The Jewish people face a difficult struggle in this world. The idealistic, faith-based message that God assigned to Israel incites all the evildoers of the world to rise up and fight against the Jews. No other nation has been persecuted as the Jews have, from the destruction of the Temple, through the Crusades, the Inquisition, and the Khmelnytsky Massacres of 1648-9, and culminating in the terrible Holocaust that ravaged our nation. Amalek started it all.",
                    "Right after we left Egypt, even before we had a chance to coalesce and organize ourselves, Amalek attacked us, without any provocation or reason. Who did they attack? Slaves on their way to freedom after a prolonged period of servitude. Amalek is the nation whose very existence expresses hatred of Israel and, by extension, hatred of the Torah and the divine idea of repairing the world through kindness and truth. This is why the verse says, “‘Hand upon the throne (<i>kes</i>)<i> </i>of the Lord (<i>Kah</i>)!’ The Lord will be at war with Amalek throughout the ages” (Shemot 17:16). Rashi comments, noting that the verse uses shortened versions for two words – <i>kes </i>instead of <i>kisei</i> and <i>Kah</i> instead of the full Tetragrammaton – “The Holy One, blessed be He, swore that His name and His throne will not be complete until the name of Amalek is utterly blotted out.”",
                    "A Jew is naturally kind and compassionate, and many <i>mitzvot</i> in the Torah further cultivate these traits within him. He would naturally be inclined to forgive Amalek. But the Torah commands us to remember what Amalek did and obliterate it. This way, we will remember that there is evil in the world, and that we must fight this evil to the bitter end, without compromise. Only then will we be able to perfect the world."

Indeed, the Sages taught that the people of Israel were commanded to fulfill three <i>mitzvot</i> upon entering Eretz Yisrael: first, to appoint a king; then to wipe out the descendants of Amalek; and then to build the Holy Temple (<i>San</i>. 20b).",
                    "Indeed, after the people of Israel became coalesced as a nation in its land, appointed a king in Shaul, and his kingdom stabilized, the prophet Shmuel approached him, saying: I am the one the Lord sent to anoint you king over His people Israel. Therefore, listen to the Lord’s command! “Thus said the Lord of Hosts: I am exacting the penalty for what Amalek did to Israel, for the assault he made upon them on the road, on their way up from Egypt.” Now go, attack Amalek, and proscribe all that belongs to him. Spare no one, but kill alike men and women, infants and sucklings, oxen and sheep, camels and asses!” (1 Shmuel 15:1-3)",
                    "However, King Shaul did not fulfill the mitzva properly. He had pity on King Agag of Amalek and on the best of the sheep and cattle. As a result, God took the kingdom away from Shaul and gave it to David. Nevertheless, the damage that was already done was devastating. Because of Shaul’s weakness and compassion, many Amalekites survived and continued harassing Israel. A few years later, a band of Amalekites attacked Tziklag, where the families of David and his men lived, burning down the city and taking all the women and children captive. With God’s help, David and his men managed to rescue the captives and vanquish the marauders. But since David was not yet king and did not have the army of Israel at his disposal, he was unable to eradicate them. According to 1 Samuel 30:17, “four hundred young men…mounted camels and got away.” Apparently, other groups of Amalekites survived elsewhere as well. Even after David became king and continued to fight against the Amalekites, he was unable to destroy them all, because they were scattered throughout the land. The Sages also relate that because Shaul delayed killing Agag, Agag’s line was preserved, eventually resulting in the birth of Haman the Agagite, who attempted to wipe out the Jewish people (<i>Megilla</i> 13a).",
                    "Even though the mitzva to eradicate Amalek is primarily incumbent upon the Jewish people as a whole, every individual Jew is commanded to fulfill it, as well. Therefore, if a Jew meets an Amalekite, and has the ability to kill him, but refrains from doing so, he has neglected this mitzva (<i>Sefer Ha-ḥinukh</i> §604). The descendants of Amalek are currently unknown, but if one would ascertain that a particular person is an Amalekite, and that person follows their ways, it would be a mitzva to kill him.<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Responsa Kol Mevaser</i> 2:42 derives from Rambam, Ramban (Shemot 17:16), and <i>Sefer Ha-ḥinukh</i> §604 that the mitzva of eradicating Amalek is primarily incumbent upon the king and the Jewish people as a whole, but that an individual who is able to kill an Amalekite must do so.<br>I asserted that some Amalekites remained after Shaul neglected to kill Agag. This is clear from BB 21a-b, which relates that David’s general Yoav erred in killing only the men of Amalek but not the women, because his school teacher had taught him an incorrect interpretation of the relevant verses. This incident took place during the war mentioned in 1 Melakhim 11:15-16, which was fought mainly against Edom, i.e., the descendants of Esav. Since the Amalekites represented only a small part of the descendants of Esav, this implies that there were groups of Amalekites within the Edomites, and it was concerning those Amalekites that Yoav erred. This explanation is cited in <i>Responsa Kol Mevaser</i> 2:42.</i>"

Nonetheless, one fulfills his obligation to hear <i>Parashat Zakhor</i> even through an inaccurate pronunciation. As long as a large Jewish community accepts and agrees upon a certain pronunciation system, it is valid. Even regarding the mitzva of <i>ḥalitza</i>, where the improper recitation of certain Hebrew verses by the man or woman renders the ceremony invalid, we do not require them to enunciate the verses according to all the different pronunciation schemes, and the woman is permitted to remarry (<i>Igrot Moshe</i>, OḤ 3:5).

After all, the Sages understood that the mitzva not to forget what Amalek did to us commands us to remember internally (<i>Megilla</i> 18a). Thus, when the Torah commands us to remember, it means through verbalization. The <i>poskim</i> dispute what exactly the Torah obligation entails. Rambam and Ramban imply that reading from a Torah scroll is a rabbinic enactment, and that by Torah law one fulfills the mitzva by reading from a <i>ḥumash</i> or through any other means of commemoration. (<i>Marḥeshet</i> 1:22 states, based on Ramban’s commentary on the end of <i>Parashat Ki Tetzei</i>, that reading the <i>megilla</i> on Purim also fulfills the mitzva of remembering Amalek.) On the other hand, according to <i>Tosafot</i>, Rashba (<i>Ber.</i> 13a), Rosh, and <i>Eshkol</i>, one is obligated by Torah law to hear <i>Parashat Zakhor</i> read from a Torah scroll. SA 146:3 rules in accordance with this opinion. Therefore, we bring a Torah scroll to a sick person or a prison inmate in order to read <i>Parashat Zakhor</i> for him, an action that we do not take for any other reading (MB 135:46; see also BHL <i>ad loc</i>.).<br>If the scroll from which <i>Parashat Zakhor</i> was read is later found to be invalid, there is no need to reread the <i>parsha</i> from a different scroll (<i>Halikhot Shlomo</i> 18:4), because, according to several <i>poskim</i>, one fulfills the mitzva without a Torah scroll, and others maintain that a Torah scroll is required, but that one fulfills his obligation with an invalid Torah scroll. It stands to reason that if the defect in the scroll is found on that same Shabbat, the congregation should reread <i>Parashat Zakhor</i> from a valid scroll, since the Sages instituted the reading on that particular day.<br><i>Terumat Ha-deshen</i> §108 infers from Rosh that according to Torah law, the mitzva to read <i>Parashat</i> <i>Zakhor</i> can only be fulfilled by reading the passage from a Torah scroll in the presence of ten men. Several Aḥaronim explain that by remembering what the Amalekites did to us, we become aroused to wage war against them, and since war is a communal obligation, <i>Parashat Zakhor</i> must be read with the congregation (<i>Keren Ora</i>, Maharam Schick). It seems to me that even <i>Terumat Ha-deshen</i> agrees that in the absence of a congregation there is still a mitzva to read it individually. SHT 685:5 expresses puzzlement about <i>Terumat Ha-deshen</i>’s viewpoint and states that all other Rishonim maintain that a <i>minyan</i> is required only rabbinically. In practice, if one finds himself in a place where there is no <i>minyan</i>, he should read <i>Parashat Zakhor</i> privately from a Torah scroll. If no scroll is available, he should read it from a <i>ḥumash</i>, as we already learned that one fulfills his Torah obligation even without a Torah scroll according to some <i>poskim</i> (see <i>Responsa Binyan Shlomo</i> §54, <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 685:35).<br>According to MA, one who fails to hear <i>Parashat Zakhor</i> on Shabbat can, <i>be-di’avad</i>, discharge his obligation by hearing the Torah reading on Purim, which recounts the story of Amalek’s attack (Shemot 17:8-16). MB 685:16 questions this, because that section only mentions the narrative of the war against Amalek, not the commandment to remember and eradicate it. Some authorities suggest that he should wait until later in the year when the congregation reads <i>Parashat Ki Tetzei</i>, which contains <i>Parashat Zakhor</i> at the end, and ask the reader to have in mind to absolve him of his obligation to remember Amalek. Both the reader and listener must have in mind to fulfill the mitzva (<i>Mikra’ei Kodesh</i> [Frank], <i>Purim</i> 6). In my humble opinion, however, it is best for him to read <i>Parashat Zakhor</i> privately, from a Torah scroll, as soon as possible, lest he forget it altogether. This way, he will fulfill his obligation according to the vast majority of <i>poskim</i>. Then, if he remembers, he can act scrupulously and try to fulfill the mitzva through the readings of Purim and <i>Ki Tetzei</i>.<br>The Aḥaronim dispute the reason for this mitzva. According to <i>Keren Ora</i>, it is in order to destroy Amalek.

Some explain that the lineage of a non-Jew is determined by the father, and these teachers descended from Haman through a daughter (Mahari Engel, <i>Gilyonei Ha-Shas</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 57b; Maharsham 3:272). </i>",
                    "Others explain that, <i>le-khatḥila</i>, we do not accept Amalekite converts, but if they are accepted by accident, their conversion is valid (<i>Yeshu’ot Malko</i>, <i>Likutim</i> 15). Others maintain that the conversion is valid only if the mistake is discovered several generations later, but if a convert’s Amalekite origin is revealed immediately, the conversion is invalidated (<i>Shvut Yehuda</i> on the <i>Mekhilta</i>). Others maintain that the teachers descended from an Amalekite who assimilated into another nation and converted afterward. In such a case, it is impossible to know that he is from Amalek, and thus we accept him. Later on, it was revealed through divine inspiration that these teachers were descendants of Haman, but their conversion was still valid (R. Ḥayim Palachi, <i>Einei Kol Ḥai</i>, <i>San.</i> 96b). It is also possible that an Amalekite can divest himself of the status of Amalek by accepting the seven Noahide laws, and then, at a later stage, convert (suggested by Ḥida, <i>Petaḥ Einayim</i>, <i>San.</i> 96b). According to <i>Reponsa Kol Mevaser</i> 2:42, we may accept an Amalekite convert; the <i>Mekhilta</i> only prohibits such a convert from marrying into the Jewish people."

                    "The custom of all Jewry, since the geonic period, is to fast on the thirteenth of Adar in commemoration of the fasts that Esther observed before approaching King Aḥashverosh to annul the decree against the Jewish people (Esther 4:16) and the fast that the Jews observed on the thirteenth of Adar of that year. The wicked Haman decreed that on the thirteenth of Adar, all Jews – young and old, children and women – be destroyed, massacred, and exterminated on a single day, and that their possessions be plundered. Because of the miracle of Purim, the hanging of Haman, and the rise of Mordechai and Esther, King Aḥashverosh issued a second letter allowing the Jews to defend themselves and kill their enemies on that same day. The original decree, however, was not rescinded, because a decree that was written and signed by the king could not be annulled. Therefore, the enemies of Israel also had permission to kill the Jews. In other words, the kingdom established the thirteenth of Adar as the day on which those who hated the Jewish people were permitted to kill them, but the Jews were also permitted to fight for their lives and kill their enemies as well. And even though Mordechai was already second in command to the king, the Jews were still in grave danger and in need of divine mercy to help them overcome and kill their enemies. Therefore, the Jews who could not fight stirred themselves to repentance and fasted that day, as is Israel’s practice in times of hardship. Indeed, there is no greater penitence than penitence that is achieved through fasting, as fasting purifies a person’s material side and returns his spirituality to its natural, central place.",
                    "In commemoration of that fast, the Jewish people fast on the thirteenth of Adar every year. We still have enemies who want to destroy us and we still need to fast and repent every year anew.<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rishonim ask how a fast could be established on the eve of Purim, as <i>Megilat Ta’anit</i> states explicitly that we do not fast or deliver eulogies on the day before a rabbinic holiday. <i>Tosafot</i> answer that since <i>Megilat Ta’anit</i> was repealed, the laws of the day before the holidays mentioned therein were also repealed. <i>Ha-ma’or</i> explains that we view the laws of Purim as if they were mandated by the Torah, which needs no reinforcement, and thus one may fast before Purim. Rosh and Ran point out that since the Book of Esther 9:31 alludes to this fast – “the matters of the fasts with their cries” – one may fast prior to the holiday. <i>Beit Yosef</i> §686 elaborates on this.</i>",
                    "In general, the laws of Ta’anit Esther (the Fast of Esther) are more lenient than those of the other minor fasts, because the other fasts were instituted by the Sages, whereas Ta’anit Esther was established by Jewish custom. In practice, though, there is almost no difference between them.<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since Ta’anit Esther is based on custom, we are more lenient in cases of uncertainty. Thus, a woman is exempt from fasting on Ta’anit Esther for 24 months after giving birth. Even though the <i>poskim</i> dispute this law when it comes to the other minor fasts – most of them taking a more stringent approach, as explained above, 7:8 – there is room to rule leniently regarding Ta’anit Esther.<br>A bride and groom during the seven-day period of joy after their wedding, as well as the main participants in a <i>brit mila</i>, must observe the other minor fasts but are exempt from fasting on Ta’anit Esther. This is stated in SHT 686:16, <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 686:16, 28, and <i>Yeḥaveh Da’at</i> 2:78. (According to the Vilna Gaon, they are exempt from all the minor fasts.) Rema 686:2 maintains that the main participants in a <i>brit</i> must fast on Ta’anit Esther, and many follow this ruling. With regard to a bride and groom, however, it is customary to be lenient.<br>Rema 686:2 states that those who have severe eye pain need not fast on Ta’anit Esther, but they should make up the fast on a different day. Most Aḥaronim explain that even though those who suffer from eye pain are not considered truly sick, they may postpone their fast to a different day because they are in pain. This is not the case regarding the other minor fasts, on which one must fast even if he is in pain. In practice, it is difficult to distinguish between illness and pain. <i>Mikra’ei Kodesh</i> (Harari) ch. 3 n. 25 rules similarly, quoting R. Shaul Yisraeli and R. Mordechai Eliyahu, that those who suffer from eye pain have the same status as a sick person: They do not need to fast on Ta’anit Esther, nor do they need to make up the missed fast on a later date. Another difference, on the minor fasts, it is proper to be stringent and refrain from washing in warm water and playing music, as a sign of mourning over the Temple’s destruction (see above 7:2 and n. 3). On Ta’anit Esther, however, there is no reason to adopt this stringency.</i>",
                    "The laws regarding the prayers and Torah reading at <i>Shaḥarit</i> and <i>Minḥa</i> on Ta’anit Esther are the same as on all the minor fasts. The only difference is that we omit <i>Taḥanun</i> at <i>Minḥa</i>, since it is the day before Purim (MB 131:33). In addition, those who follow Ashkenazic custom and usually recite <i>Avinu Malkeinu</i> on fast days at both <i>Shaḥarit</i> and <i>Minḥa</i> do not do so at <i>Minḥa </i>on Ta’anit Esther. When the thirteenth of Adar coincides with Shabbat, we fast on the Thursday prior, and since the fast is not on the eve of Purim, we pray <i>Minḥa</i> as on all other fasts."

Jews, even when they sin, are still called God’s children, and nevertheless God directs the world and arranges events for their benefit, in order to save and redeem them.",
                    "At the time of the Purim story, the Jewish people was in dire straits. The First Temple had been destroyed, and Israel had been exiled from its land. While Cyrus’s edict permitting the Jews to return to their land had already been declared, only a small minority actually did so. The Persian Empire ruled the world, and the large Jewish population living throughout the empire made an effort to assimilate and behave as the gentiles did, to the point where many were willing to bow down to an idol. In the capital city of Shushan, many Jews partook in Aḥashverosh’s feast and looked on as the Persians brought out the Temple vessels, which our enemies had pillaged at the time of the Temple’s destruction, and used them for mundane purposes. Yet they still enjoyed this wicked man’s feast. It seemed as though the great vision for which the nation of Israel was chosen was steadily vanishing; there would no longer be hope for a return to Zion. The Jewish people would no longer bring the word of God to the world.",
                    "Then, a great accusation arose in heaven against Israel. Despite the fact that God chose Israel from among all the other nations, gave them His Torah, and manifested His presence in their midst, they were acting like the gentiles, bowing to an idol, and failing to go up to their land to build the Holy Temple. Therefore, the wicked Haman, a descendant of Amalek, arose and instigated the Persian Empire to enact a terrible decree against the Jews, the likes of which had never been seen before: “To destroy, massacre, and exterminate all the Jews, young and old, children and women, on a single day, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month – that is, the month of Adar – and to plunder their possessions” (Esther 3:13).",
                    "Incidentally, some Jews claimed against Mordechai that he was the cause of the evil decree: By refusing to bow to the wicked Haman, he stirred his wrath against all the Jews (<i>ibid</i>. 3:2-6).",
                    "Ultimately it became clear that God controls events and had even already prepared the solution to the problem in advance, by arranging for Aḥashverosh to marry Esther. Thus, Mordechai and Esther were able to thwart Haman’s plan. Everything was reversed: Instead of Israel’s enemies carrying out their evil scheme, the Jews were able to kill their enemies, even hanging Haman and his sons on the very tree that he had prepared for Mordechai. The people of Israel experienced a great salvation; their prestige grew among the nations; and they mustered the strength to ascend to Eretz Yisrael, settle it, and build the Second Temple.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It emerges from <i>Megilla</i> 11b-12a that the Purim story happened after Cyrus’s edict but before the Jews were permitted to build the Temple. Furthermore, the evil decree was issued because they bowed down to an idol and derived pleasure from the wicked king’s feast. Many claim that Darius was the son of Aḥashverosh and Esther, and that thanks to Esther’s influence, Darius allowed the Second Temple to be completed after the enemies of the Jews disrupted its construction.</i>"

The decree made it clear that the Jewish people were willing to make great sacrifices in order to hold onto their faith. After all, they could have assimilated among the gentiles and saved themselves from annihilation. Nevertheless, they did not try to escape their Jewish destiny.

In a certain sense, their renewed commitment at that time was greater than their original acceptance of the Torah on Mount Sinai. When the Torah was first given, Israel was forced to accept it, as it says, “They took their places at the foot of the mountain” (Shemot 19:17). The Sages comment (<i>Shabbat</i> 88a):<br>This teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, overturned the mountain upon them like a cask, and said to them, “If you accept the Torah – good; if not – here shall be your burial.” R. Aḥa b. Yaakov said, “This furnishes a strong protest against the Torah” (since they accepted the Torah under duress, they are not obligated to uphold it). Rava said, “Even so, they re-accepted it at the time of Aḥashverosh, as it says, ‘The Jews upheld and accepted upon themselves” (Esther 9:27) – that is, they confirmed what they had accepted long before.”",

After all the great miracles of the Exodus from Egypt, the splitting of the sea, and the awesome revelations at Mount Sinai, it was impossible for the Jews not to accept the Torah. However, the question still remained: Would the Jews stay connected to God and His Torah even afterward, when they become detached from those miracles and wonders? Indeed, there were ups and downs, until the events of Purim took place. That is when it became clear that the people of Israel’s connection to their faith and to the Torah were absolute. The terrible decree made it clear that the price of belief might be unbearable, but the Jews still chose to adhere to their faith, repent, and pray to God, without any coercion.

In the end, they found scriptural allusions indicating that there are grounds to write about the battle of Amalek once again.

They only dispute the <i>halakha</i> in cases of uncertainty. At first glance, the fact that the <i>Megilla</i> is read on both the 14th and 15th where there is uncertainty about whether that location was walled at the time of Yehoshua bin Nun indicates that one must be stringent in cases of uncertainty, as we are with regard to Torah commandments. This appears to be the position of Rambam and SA 688:4, 696:7. According to Ramban, Rashba, and Ritva, however, we follow this practice only as a pious custom, not as an obligation, demonstrating that the status of these <i>mitzvot</i> is like that of rabbinic commandments. Several Aḥaronim are inclined toward stringentcy (<i>Turei Even</i>, MB 692:16, <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 692:39).

This decree was not abolished even after Mordechai and Esther’s amazing rise to power, because by law any decree written in the king’s name and sealed with the king’s signet could not be revoked.

                    "Only as a last resort – if one is unable to hear the <i>Megilla</i> read in a <i>minyan</i> – may one fulfill the mitzva in private, with a <i>berakha</i> (SA and Rema 690:18).<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When several people, but not enough to form a <i>minyan</i>, need to fulfill the mitzva it is preferable for each one to read on his own since, <i>le-khatḥila</i>, reading the <i>Megilla</i> is like prayer: when there is a <i>minyan</i>, the <i>ḥazan</i> prays on the congregation’s behalf, but one individual cannot fulfill the obligation on behalf of another individual. <i>Be-di’avad</i>, however, an individual may read the <i>Megilla </i>on another person’s behalf (SA 689:5, MB <i>ad loc. </i>15). If only one person knows how to read the <i>Megilla</i> with the proper cantillation, it is preferable for him to read on behalf of others, even if there is no <i>minyan</i>.<br>The Talmud records a dispute in <i>Megilla</i> 5a: Rav maintains that when <i>Megilat Esther</i> is read in its proper time, even an individual may read it, while R. Asi maintains that a <i>minyan</i> is required even if it is read in its proper time. The Rishonim differ over how to interpret this dispute. According to Rabbeinu Tam, the dispute concerns a <i>le-khatḥila </i>situation, and the <i>halakha</i> follows Rav’s opinion. Therefore, even <i>le-khatḥila</i>,<i> </i>an individual may read the <i>Megilla</i>, in its proper time (though it is clearly preferable to read it with a large group of people). According to <i>Behag</i>, the dispute concerns a <i>be-di’avad</i> situation, and the <i>halakha</i> follows R. Asi’s opinion. Therefore, an individual should not read the <i>Megilla</i>. Those who take <i>Behag</i>’s opinion into consideration<i> </i>maintain that an individual reading the <i>Megilla </i>should not recite a <i>berakha</i> (<i>Mordechai</i>, quoting Rabbeinu Gershom, is in this vein, as is Mahari Weil). Many Rishonim maintain that, <i>le-khatḥila</i>, one should read the <i>Megilla</i> with a <i>minyan</i>, but that this is not absolutely necessary in order to fulfill the mitzva. The reason for this is that either the <i>halakha</i> follows R. Asi’s opinion, though even he would agree that, <i>be-di’avad</i>, an individual may read the <i>Megilla</i>;<i> </i>or the <i>halakha</i> follows Rav’s opinion, and even he would agree that, <i>le-khatḥila</i>, one should read the <i>Megilla </i>with a <i>minyan</i>. Rosh and Raavad follow this position, and it is codified in SA 690:18. The vast majority of Aḥaronim agree that one who reads the <i>Megilla </i>individually should recite the <i>berakha</i>. <i>Orḥot Ḥayim</i> quotes Raavad as saying that if the <i>Megilla</i> was read in front of ten men in a certain place, an individual in that place may read it alone <i>le-khatḥila</i>, as the miracle has already been publicized. Rema 690:18 concurs. MB <i>ad loc. </i>64 states that some rule stringently and require an individual to search for ten men, <i>le-khatḥila</i>, even in this situation. See below, n. 8, regarding whether a woman may read the <i>Megilla </i>on behalf of other women and whether she may recite the <i>berakha</i> for other women in doing so. Also see n. 17, on the issue of whether a <i>minyan</i> is required for the <i>berakha</i> of “<i>Ha-rav et riveinu.</i>” (According to <i>Ben Ish Ḥai</i>, one recites the <i>berakha</i> even without a <i>minyan</i>, but the prevalent custom is not to recite it. If ten women are present, one should recite the <i>berakha</i>.)<br>According to Rif, Rashba, and Ramban, one should not read the <i>Megilla</i> without a <i>minyan </i>when it is not the proper time for reading it (11-13 Adar). Rashi and <i>Ha-ma’or</i>, however, maintain that one may read the <i>Megilla </i>and recite the <i>berakha</i>, <i>be-di’avad</i>, without a <i>minyan</i>. In practice, SHT 690:61 states that if one reads the <i>Megilla </i>without a <i>minyan </i>when it is not the proper time, one should not recite the <i>berakha</i>.</i>"

Rashba and Ritva maintain that the enactment was for the villagers to read the <i>Megilla </i>on the day of assembly with a <i>minyan</i>, while they would read it at night in their hometowns without a <i>minyan</i>. The only point of disagreement between Rashba and Ritva is which night the villagers would read the <i>Megilla</i>: Rashba maintains that they would read it on the night before the day of assembly, whereas Ritva maintains that they would read it on the night of Purim itself. <i>Noda Bi-Yehuda</i> 1:41 and <i>Turei Even</i>, <i>Megilla</i> 4a state that the law of the daytime reading is <i>mi-divrei kabbala</i>, while the nighttime reading is merely a rabbinic decree. <i>Yabi’a Omer</i>, OḤ 1:43:13 suggests that <i>Ohel Mo’ed</i>, <i>Or Zaru’a</i>, and Ran share this opinion. However, according to <i>Roke’aḥ</i>, Rashba, and Ritva, the nighttime reading is also <i>mi-divrei kabbala</i> (though a <i>minyan</i> is not required at night, because the miracle is publicized primarily during the day).

                    "According to Rashi and Rambam, women and men are equally obligated in the mitzva to read the <i>Megilla</i>, and a woman may read the <i>Megilla</i> for her family. In contrast, <i>Behag</i> and Rabbeinu Ḥananel maintain that a woman’s obligation differs from that of a man: Men must read the <i>Megilla</i>, whereas women must hear it. Therefore, a man does not fulfill his obligation with his wife’s reading. <i>Responsa Avnei Nezer</i> (OḤ 511) explains that this difference stems from the fact that women must hear the <i>Megilla</i> only in order to publicize the miracle, and therefore their obligation is only in hearing the <i>Megilla </i>and not reading it. In contrast, men are commanded to publicize the miracle and also to remember Amalek to wipe him out ultimately. Therefore, men are commanded to read the <i>Megilla</i>.<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Turei Even</i> (<i>Megilla</i> 4a) states that a man’s obligation to read the <i>Megilla </i>is rooted in divine inspiration (of the <i>Megilla </i>itself) and is a time-bound positive mitzva and thus applies only to men. Women, on the other hand, are obligated because of the rationale that “they too participated in that miracle,” a rationale that is solely rabbinic. Therefore, according to <i>Behag</i> and Rabbeinu Ḥananel, a man cannot fulfill his obligation with a woman’s reading. Raavya and <i>Roke’aḥ</i> concur, and this also seems to be the opinion of <i>Tosafot</i> and Ran. <i>Mordechai</i> states that according to this position, women recite a different formulation of the <i>berakha</i>’s ending: <i>lishmo’a megilla </i>(“to hear the <i>Megilla</i>”). However, Rashi, Rambam, <i>Nimukei Yosef</i>, <i>Or Zaru’a</i>, Ri’az, Me’iri, and others maintain that a woman’s obligation is identical to that of a man. Therefore, a woman can read on a man’s behalf, and she recites the same <i>berakha</i> that men do.<br>Some maintain that women and men have the same obligation, but women cannot read on behalf of men for a different reason. <i>Smag</i> states that it is because reading the <i>Megilla</i> is like reading the Torah. MA 689:5 explains that this means the Sages determined that women should not read the <i>Megilla</i> out of respect for the congregation, and that they cannot even read on an individual man’s behalf, so as not to make any distinctions. According to <i>Kol Bo</i>, women should not read the <i>Megilla </i>for men because a woman’s voice is considered <i>erva</i>. Those who maintain that women may read on behalf of men may have been referring to relatives, about whose voices one need not be so concerned. Alternatively, a woman could read for a man without the cantillation. Another possibility is that, technically, we are not concerned that a woman’s voice is <i>erva</i> in the context of mitzva observance.</i>",
                    "Since the Rishonim are evenly split on this issue, most Aḥaronim rule that a woman may not read the <i>Megilla </i>on a man’s behalf except in pressing circumstances, when it is not possible for the man to read for himself or hear it from another man. In that case, at least he will fulfill the mitzva according to the opinion that a woman can read on a man’s behalf.<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Some Aḥaronim interpret SA 689:1-2 to mean that a woman can read on a man’s behalf, and that this is indeed the <i>halakha</i> (<i>Birkei Yosef</i> 271:1, <i>Ma’amar Mordechai</i> 689:2). <i>Ḥazon Ovadia</i>, <i>Purim</i>, p. 59 states that even though the <i>halakha</i> follows the more lenient opinion, one should only rely on it under pressing circumstances. Most Aḥaronim, however, maintain that a woman should not read on a man’s behalf. Thus state <i>Levush</i>, <i>Eliya Rabba</i> 689:2, <i>Pri Ḥadash</i> 689:1, <i>Erekh Ha-shulḥan</i> 689:3, <i>Ḥikrei Lev</i>, and <i>Derekh Ha-ḥayim</i>. Some maintain that this is also SA’s position (<i>Pri Megadim</i>, <i>Eshel Avraham</i> 689:4; also see <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 689:14).</i>",
                    "A woman may read on behalf of other women. Some say that a woman cannot fulfill the obligation on behalf of many women, since <i>Megilla</i> reading has a status similar to Torah reading, and just as a woman does not read from the Torah, so too she does not read the <i>Megilla</i> for many women. Some <i>poskim </i>say that when the <i>Megilla</i> is read for women, no <i>berakha</i> is recited (<i>Ben Ish Ḥai</i>, Year 1, <i>Hilkhot Purim </i>1 [Tetzaveh]; <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 689:19). However, halakhic practice follows the overwhelming majority of <i>poskim</i> who maintain that a woman may read on behalf of other women, reciting the same <i>berakha</i> a man recites. And if the group is comprised of ten women, the reader recites the <i>berakha</i> of “<i>Ha-rav et riveinu</i>” after the <i>Megilla</i>. However, <i>le-khatḥila</i>, it is preferable that women hear the <i>Megilla</i> read by a man, to satisfy all opinions.

                    "When a man reads the <i>Megilla</i> for women, the prevalent custom is for the reader to recite the <i>berakha</i> for everyone; and if ten women are present, he recites the <i>berakha</i> of “<i>Ha-rav et riveinu</i>” after the reading. Others follow the custom that one woman recites the <i>berakha</i> for all the women. Both customs are valid.<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Korban Netanel</i> (on Rosh, <i>Megilla</i> 1:4, n. 40) innovatively suggests that a woman may not read on behalf of many women. This is cited in SHT 689:15. However, it seems that the intent is to be stringent <i>le-khatḥila</i>, because SHT 689:16 states that the dominant opinion is that women and men have an equal obligation. <i>Halikhot Beitah</i> (<i>Petaḥ Ha-bayit</i> 25; also cited in <i>Halikhot Shlomo </i>ch. 19 n. 4) states that R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach questions <i>Korban Netanel</i>’s explanation and concludes that halakhic practice follows R. Yeḥiel Mikhel Tikochinsky, who rules in <i>Lu’aḥ</i> <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> that a woman may read on behalf of many women. The reason for the opinion that no <i>berakha</i> is recited on a reading for women is concern for the position that no <i>berakha</i> is recited when reading for an individual (above n. 4), and women collectively are considered like an individual (<i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 689:19). The opinion of most <i>poskim</i> is that there is no need to be concerned for this at all; as is written in <i>Yabi’a Omer</i>, OḤ 1:44. However, it seems obvious that it is a mitzva for women to hear the <i>Megilla</i> among a multitude of people; they are simply not obligated to the same degree that men are, for the same reason that women are exempt from time-bound positive commandments and from prayer in a <i>minyan</i>.<br>According to Rema 689:2, when a woman recites the <i>berakha</i>, she should recite “<i>lishmo’a Megilla</i>.” So state <i>Levush</i>, <i>Baḥ</i>, and MB 692:11. However, most <i>poskim</i> maintain that a woman recites the same <i>berakha</i> that a man does: “<i>al mikra megilla</i>”<i> </i>(“concerning the reading of the <i>Megilla</i>”). First of all, half of the <i>poskim</i> maintain, like Rashi and Rambam, that women and men have the same obligation. Second, even according to <i>Behag</i> and Rabbeinu Ḥananel, who maintain that a woman is obligated only to hear the <i>Megilla</i>, nonetheless, Rabbeinu Tam maintains that women may optionally fulfill <i>mitzvot</i> from which they are technically exempt and may recite <i>berakhot</i> over them, just like men do. Indeed, this is the Ashkenazic practice. Therefore, it may be that no distinction needs to be made between the formulation of the <i>berakha</i> for men and the formulation of the <i>berakha </i>for women. Most Sephardim follow this custom, and <i>Pri Ḥadash</i> and the Vilna Gaon concur.<br>The Talmud states in RH 29a, “Even though one has already discharged his obligation, he may absolve others of theirs.” That is, even if one has already performed a mitzva and recited a <i>berakha</i> over it, he may still recite a <i>berakha</i> on behalf of one who has not yet fulfilled his obligation. According to <i>Behag</i> and Rambam, this holds true only when the one who still needs to fulfill the mitzva does not know how to recite the <i>berakha</i>. If he knows how to recite the <i>berakha</i>, however, he must do so himself. <i>Or Zaru’a</i> and Ran, on the other hand, maintain that one may recite a <i>berakha</i> even on behalf of someone who knows how to do so himself. The answer to the question whether it is better for one of the women to recite the <i>berakha</i> as opposed to the male reader depends on this dispute. BHL 273:4 explains that the dispute concerns only the <i>le-khatḥila</i> case. Simply stated, it is preferable for one of the women to recite the <i>berakha</i> on behalf of all the rest, as this allows the women to fulfill their obligation according to all the opinions. <i>Lu’aḥ Eretz Yisrael</i> and <i>Halikhot Shlomo</i> 19:3 advocate this solution. In many communities, however, the reader recites the <i>berakha</i>, as MB states in 585:5 regarding <i>shofar</i> blowing and in 692:10 on the issue of women reading the <i>Megilla</i>. <i>Minḥat Yitzḥak</i> 3:54:38 states – based on a <i>halakha</i> in SA 689:5 and based on what we explained in n. 4, above – that if there are fewer than ten women, it is better for each one to recite her own <i>berakha</i>.<br>The issue of reciting the <i>berakha</i> of “<i>Ha-rav et riveinu</i>” when there are ten women is discussed below, n. 17.</i>"

If it is written using something other than ink, or on paper, it is invalid, and one who reads from it has not fulfilled his obligation. The hide from which the parchment is made must be tanned for the sake of writing a <i>Megilla</i>. The individual sheets of parchment must be sewn together with threads made of sinews. One must etch out the lines using a stylus before commencing to write on the parchment, so that the words come out straight. Furthermore, it must be written by hand, and the scribe must be mindful of the sanctity of the <i>Megilla</i>.<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A <i>Megilla</i> has the same status as a Torah scroll, as is clear from the Mishna and Gemara in <i>Megilla</i> 17a and 19a. One may write a <i>megilla</i> on a <i>gevil </i>(roll of parchment) or on <i>klaf </i>(split parchment), but it is customary to write it on <i>klaf</i>. According to Rambam, one does not need to tan the hide for the sake of the mitzva, but Rosh and most <i>poskim</i> rule that one must tan the hide for the sake of the mitzva (<i>Beit Yosef</i> and SA 691:1). The Aḥaronim debate whether a woman may write a <i>Megilla</i>. <i>Birkei Yosef</i>, <i>Mateh Yehuda</i>, and <i>Pri Megadim</i> posit that since a woman must read the <i>Megilla</i>, she may write one. R. Akiva Eger, <i>Avnei Nezer</i>, and others maintain that she is invalidated from writing a <i>megilla</i>, just as she is invalidated from writing a Torah scroll. <i>Lishkat Ha-sofer</i> 28:7 (by R. Shlomo Ganzfried, author of <i>Kitzur </i>SA) brings a support for those who permit women to write a <i>Megilla</i> from the verse “Then Esther wrote” (Esther 9:29), the source from which <i>Megilla</i> 19a derives the law that a <i>Megilla</i> must be written like a Torah scroll. He concludes that <i>le-khatḥila</i>, one should use a <i>Megilla</i> that was written by a man, in order to satisfy all opinions. <i>Be-di’avad</i>, however, when the only available <i>Megilla</i> was written by a woman, one may read from it and even recite the <i>berakhot</i> over it.</i>",
                    "When writing a Torah scroll, we make sure that all of its letters are written according to their exact configurations, that no letters touch each other, and, of course, that no letters are omitted or added unnecessarily. A scribe should likewise be careful about all these things when writing a <i>Megilla</i>. <i>Be-di’avad</i>, however, there is a difference between a Torah scroll and <i>Megilat Esther</i>: one may not recite the <i>berakha</i> over reading the Torah if the scroll contains a mistake in even one letter, but one may read from, and recite a <i>berakha </i>over, a <i>Megilla </i>that is missing some of its letters, if a perfectly kosher scroll is unavailable. For example, if a scribe mistakenly omitted several letters from a <i>Megilla</i>, or wrote them incorrectly – or if he originally wrote the scroll properly, but some of its letters faded over time – one may still use it to perform the mitzva, as long as the main part of it is written properly. The reason for this is that the <i>Megilla</i> is called a “letter,” indicating that its purpose is to tell the story from a written document, but it does not need to be as precise as a Torah scroll must be. We learn from here that one fulfills his obligation as long as the essentials of the <i>Megilla</i> are written properly, and on condition that one fills in the missing words by reading them from a printed <i>Megilla</i> or by reciting them by heart.<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The rule is that one fulfills his obligation, <i>be-di’avad</i>, if he reads from a <i>Megilla</i> of which at least half is written properly, provided that no part of the story is entirely missing and that the beginning and end are intact (SA 690:3).<br>Some maintain that if some of the words are written in a different language, the <i>Megilla</i> is invalid, because it is like a document that is self-evidently counterfeit. <i>Mateh Yehuda</i> and R. Shlomo Kluger maintain that a <i>Megilla</i> is disqualified from use if letters are missing or added in a way that changes the meaning of a verse, because it, too, is like a self-evidently counterfeit document. In practice, though, most authorities maintain that mistakes do not invalidate a <i>Megilla</i> any more than erased letters do, as explained in MB 691:6, 14. See also BHL 690:8, regarding the alternative opinion, and Ritva.<br>One should not write vowels, cantillation marks, or <i>berakhot</i> in the <i>Megilla</i>, but <i>be-di’avad</i>, when no other scroll is available, one may read from such a <i>Megilla</i> and even recite a <i>berakha</i> over it (SA 691:9). A Torah scroll, however, is invalidated if vowels and cantillation marks are written inside (SA,<i> </i>YD 274:7). There is a stringency regarding the public reading of the <i>Megilla</i>: If one reads from a <i>Megilla</i> that is written together with other books of the Writings (<i>Ketuvim</i>), one does not fulfill his obligation. This is because the miracle is not publicized this way, as it looks like one is merely reading from the Writings. An individual, however, discharges his obligation when reading from such a <i>Megilla</i> (SA 691:8).<br>Some rule very leniently and allow one to read from an invalid <i>Megilla</i> (like the ones children use, which open like a scroll) with a <i>berakha</i>, if no kosher <i>Megilla</i> is available (<i>Roke’aḥ</i>, <i>Orḥot Ḥayim</i>). According to most <i>poskim</i>, however, under no condition may one recite a <i>berakha</i> on such a <i>Megilla</i>. Nonetheless, it is proper to read from it without a <i>berakha</i> (SA 691:10).

Rather, it is a <i>berakha</i> of praise and thanksgiving that depends on one’s custom, as the Mishna states, “In a place where it is customary to recite the <i>berakha</i>, one should recite it, and in a place where it is customary not to recite the <i>berakha</i>, one should not recite it” (<i>Megilla</i> 21a). Nowadays, everyone recites it. <i>Orḥot Ḥayim</i> quotes the Yerushalmi as saying that one recites it only in a <i>minyan</i>, and <i>Beit Yosef</i> and Rema 692:1 codify this. However, Rashi, Maharam, and Radbaz maintain that even an individual recites it. <i>Ben Ish Ḥai</i>, Year 1, <i>Hilkhot Purim </i>13 (Tetzaveh) concurs, and those who follow the rulings of <i>Ben Ish Ḥai</i> act accordingly.

Anyone who rises up against Israel, God’s nation, is in effect rebelling against God, Creator and Sustainer of the world, and – according to strict justice – deserves total annihilation. Several laws demonstrate the special significance of killing Haman and his sons.",
                    "First, the passage describing the execution of Haman’s ten sons is written in the <i>Megilla </i>in the format of a song. However, this format is unlike the format that appears in other biblical songs, such as the Song at the Sea, where the words and spaces are interwoven. The execution of Haman’s sons, in contrast, is written in a straight and organized fashion. On every line, one word is written on each of the two ends, with a space left in the middle. Thus, the names of the ten sons are written on the right side and the Hebrew word <i>et</i>, which connects the names, is written repeatedly on the left side (<i>Megilla</i> 16b, SA 691:3). The explanation is as follows. The purpose of all other songs is to convey the extent of the salvation that Israel experienced; therefore, they are written in a spacious and expansive format. The song describing the execution of Haman’s sons, however, expresses the joy we feel over the fact that they were utterly destroyed and that strict justice was meted out; therefore, it is written in a closed, linear style (Maharal, <i>Or Ḥadash</i> 9:10).",
                    "One must make an effort to read all the names in a single breath, to demonstrate that their souls departed from their bodies simultaneously. If one fails to do this, he has nonetheless fulfilled his obligation,<i> be-di’avad</i>. The letter <i>vav</i> in the name Vaizata is written higher than the other letters, to teach that Haman’s sons were all hanged together (<i>Megilla</i> 16b; SA 690:15, 691:4). The point is that the foundation of Israel’s faith is the existence of one God. The Amalekites oppose this belief and hate the Jews. Thus, when they are eliminated, God’s oneness is revealed to the world. Therefore, when Haman’s sons were punished, they died as one, since their deaths confirmed our belief in God’s oneness (Maharal, <i>loc</i>.<i> cit.</i>).",
                    "After the <i>Megilla</i> reading, one must recite, “Cursed is Haman, blessed is Mordechai; cursed is Zeresh, blessed is Esther; cursed are all the wicked people, blessed are all the righteous people; and Ḥarvona, too, is remembered for good (<i>y. Megilla</i> 3:7; SA 690:16).",

Apparently, they wanted to express their hatred for wicked people and their joy over their downfall. Even though there is no source for this practice, Rema writes, “One should not abolish or deride any custom, for it was not established for naught” (690:17). However, some Rishonim disregard the custom, and some Aḥaronim even oppose it, because the noise is liable to prevent the listeners from fulfilling their obligation to read the <i>Megilla</i> (as explained above in section 10). In practice, one may continue following the custom of “beating” Haman, as long as it is assured that everyone can hear the entire <i>Megilla</i> properly.<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This custom is more prevalent in Ashkenazic communities. However, Maharil did not follow it. In our community of Har Bracha, we conduct two <i>minyanim</i> on Purim night. In the main <i>minyan</i>,<i> </i>the congregants stomp once with their feet each time “Haman” is read, causing almost no delays. At the yeshiva, the students “beat” Haman extensively. During the day, the entire community reads the <i>Megilla</i> together with the yeshiva students, and people bang minimally.

Others maintain that one does not need to repeat <i>Birkat Ha-mazon</i>, since one does not need to eat bread at the meal (<i>Terumat Ha-deshen</i>, MA, <i>Eliya Rabba</i>). Still others maintain that even though one must eat bread at the meal, the law of <i>Al Ha-nisim</i> at the meal is no more stringent than that of <i>Al Ha-nisim</i> in the <i>Amida</i>, upon whose omission one does not need to repeat the <i>Amida </i>(AHS 695:7, 12).

The Talmud (<i>Megilla</i> 14a) provides three reasons for this. R. Yitzḥak explains that we do not recite <i>Hallel</i> for a miracle that occurred outside the Land of Israel. According to Rava, it is omitted because we remained subjugated to Aḥashverosh even after the miracle occurred, and <i>Hallel</i> can be said only over a salvation that brings us freedom. R.

Anyone who disregards the pain of the destitute – even if he thinks that he is enjoying himself with his friends – is in reality engaged in debauchery, ignoring the realities of life. He flees thoughts about the suffering in this world so that he can have some fleeting happiness. But the harsh reality will not disappear when he drinks wine and becomes intoxicated. Therefore, deep down, he knows that he does not deserve to be happy, and he will remain miserable.

Similarly, Haman's decree was foiled by Jewish solidarity, as Esther said to Mordechai, “Go, assemble all the Jews who live in Shushan, and fast in my behalf; do not eat or drink for three days, night or day” (<i>ibid</i>. 4:16).

However, <i>Maḥatzit Ha-shekel</i> seems to maintain that one must give the gifts specifically on the day of Purim, and BHL 694:1 cites this opinion. Furthermore, there is uncertainty about what the law is in a case in which one sends <i>mishlo’aḥ manot </i>before Purim but they reach the recipient on Purim: <i>Yad Aharon</i> states that one fulfills one’s obligation in such a case, but <i>Torah Lishma </i>§188 maintains that one does not fulfill one’s obligation, because one must increase love on the day of Purim specifically. AHS 695:16 rules according to the latter opinion with regard to both <i>mishlo’aḥ manot</i> and <i>matanot la-evyonim</i>. There is further uncertainty in a case where one gives the gifts before Purim, telling the recipient that they are merely a deposit until the day of Purim. Mahari Algazi maintains that such a person fulfills his obligation, whereas <i>Devar Eliyahu</i> §69 maintains that he does not fulfill his obligation, because both types of gifts must be given on the day of Purim.

Even though the mitzva of rejoicing continues throughout the night and day of Purim, it reaches its climax at the <i>se’uda</i>, the<i> </i>festive meal. The proper way to express joy is through a large meal, during which the participants drink a good deal; conversely, the proper and most joyful way to drink is in context of a <i>se’uda</i>.

While it is true that the Sages derive from here that one may not fast or deliver eulogies on Purim (<i>Megilla</i> 5b), there is certainly also a mitzva to rejoice actively, which one accomplishes by partaking in a joyous meal. So explains <i>Shibolei Ha-leket</i> §201. (Some maintain that the festive meal is a rabbinic mitzva; <i>Binyan Shlomo</i> §58 discusses this.) The mitzva includes eating meat and drinking wine, which is why SA 696:7 rules that even an <i>onen</i> (a mourner whose deceased relative has not yet been buried) must observe it.<br>According to Rambam (MT, Laws of <i>Megilla</i> 2:14), Rashba, and Ritva (<i>Megilla</i> 4a), the mitzva of eating and drinking is only during the day, as the verse in Esther says “days.” MA 695:6 cites <i>Kol Bo</i> as stating that some have a custom not to eat meat at night, so as not to mistakenly think that this counts as the Purim meal. On the other hand, Raavya maintains that one must have a meal with meat and wine at night, just as it is a mitzva to read the <i>Megilla</i> at night in addition to the main reading of the day. The only difference is that the main, more dignified meal must take place during the day. <i>Baḥ</i> concurs. <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Megilla</i> 4a) also seem to agree that there is a mitzva to have a festive meal at night as well.

It seems that according to these authorities, the meal should be even more elaborate than a Yom Tov meal. The term “joy” includes eating meat and drinking wine, as the Sages state in <i>Pesaḥim</i> 109a regarding Yom Tov. Even though the obligation to eat meat on Yom Tov used to relate specifically to the meat of a peace offering (<i>shelamim</i>), there is nonetheless a mitzva to eat meat on Yom Tov even after the destruction of the Temple, since doing so makes one happy, as SAH 529:7 and BHL 529:2 explain.

Eating chicken also brings joy, as the Gemara and <i>Tosafot</i> in <i>Beitza</i> 10b indicate.<br>The <i>poskim</i> disagree about whether one must eat bread at the Purim meal. According to Me’iri, Raavya, Maharshal, and <i>Mor U-ketzi’a</i>, one must eat bread, just as it is a mitzva to rejoice on Yom Tov and to eat bread at the meals. <i>Terumat Ha-deshen</i> and MA 695:9 maintain that one does not need to eat bread. They explain that the obligation to eat bread on Yom Tov is not based on the obligation to rejoice, but on the concept of honoring Yom Tov, which the Torah calls, “sacred occasions” (Vayikra 23:4). They similarly disagree about one who forgot to recite <i>Al Ha-nisim</i> in <i>Birkat Ha-mazon</i> (see above ch. 15 n. 19). Nevertheless, MB 695:12 states that one should not repeat <i>Birkat Ha-mazon</i>, since we are lenient in cases of uncertainty about <i>berakhot</i>, and AHS 695:7, 12 rules, on the one hand, that it is a mitzva to eat bread at the Purim meal, but on the other hand, one who forgets <i>Al Ha-nisim</i> does not need to repeat <i>Birkat Ha-mazon</i>, as the obligation to recite <i>Al Ha-nisim </i>in <i>Birkat Ha-mazon</i> cannot be more stringent than the obligation to recite it in the <i>Amida</i>.

                    "<b>The <i>Mitzvot</i> of Joy and Kindness / The Mitzva to Drink</b>",
                    "The mitzva to rejoice on Purim is very unique. It is even greater than the mitzva to rejoice on the festivals (Sukkot, Pesaḥ, and Shavu’ot), about which it says, “You shall rejoice in your festival” (Devarim 16:14). Since most people enjoy drinking wine, it is a mitzva to drink wine on the festivals; however, there is no mitzva to drink a lot (SA 529:1-3). Regarding Purim, however, there is an explicit mitzva to drink a lot. Moreover, the essence of Purim is that it should be “days of feasting<i> </i>(<i>mishteh</i>,<i> </i>lit. ‘drinking’) and joy” (Esther 9:22). Therefore, the Sages said, “A person is obligated to get drunk on Purim until he does not know the difference between ‘Cursed is Haman’ and ‘Blessed is Mordechai’” (<i>Megilla</i> 7b).",
                    "There are many opinions regarding the parameters of this mitzva, and they can be divided into two main categories. Some take the words of the Sages literally, meaning that one must get so drunk that he actually cannot differentiate between “Cursed is Haman” and “Blessed is Mordechai” (Rif, Rosh). That is, he should reach a state of simple joy, in which there is no distinction between different levels. In the eyes of one who has reached such a state, “Cursed is Haman” is the same as “Blessed is Mordechai,” since everything is good and everything is for the good. This is the nature of drunk people: They cannot perceive details; everything seems the same to them. However, if one knows that he is liable to do prohibited or disgusting things while he is in a state of drunkenness, he must refrain from reaching such a state. Rather, he should drink heavily until he falls asleep as a result, and while he sleeps he will not be able to differentiate between “Cursed is Haman” and “Blessed is Mordechai”—that is, between good and evil.",
                    "Others maintain that the mitzva is to drink more than usual, until one becomes tipsy, but one should not become so drunk that he is liable to act unbecomingly. The reasoning behind this viewpoint is that the <i>halakha</i> does not follow the talmudic opinion that one must drink “until he does not know” (Rabbeinu Ephraim). Alternatively, we accept that opinion, but we interpret it to mean that one should drink until he cannot pronounce his words properly, and when he has to repeat the phrase “Cursed is Haman and blessed is Mordechai” several times, he will occasionally stumble (<i>Tosafot</i>, Ran).",
                    "In practice, each person must choose for himself the way that will best allow him to drink and rejoice for the sake of heaven. Since people’s natures are different from one another, there are varying opinions as to how one should drink and rejoice.<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are three levels of intoxication: tipsy, drunk, and as drunk as Lot. 1) An tipsy person is one who drinks wine until he feels somewhat happy and disoriented, but is still capable of standing respectfully before a king. Such a person may not recite the <i>Amida</i> until the effects of the wine dissipate, but if he nonetheless prays, his prayer is valid. 2) A drunk person is one who drinks so much that he cannot stand before a king because he is incapable of acting respectfully. If he recites the <i>Amida</i>, he does not discharge his obligation, because his prayer is an abomination. Nevertheless, he may recite <i>Birkhot Ha-nehenin </i>(<i>berakhot</i> recited upon deriving pleasure from something) even in his state of drunkenness. 3) A person who is as drunk as Lot is one who drinks so much that he does not know what is happening to him. He is like a <i>shoteh</i> (a mentally impaired person), who is exempt from all <i>mitzvot</i>. See <i>Peninei Halakha</i>: <i>Prayer</i> 5:11.<br>We can now apply these levels to the mitzva of drinking on Purim. Rif and Rosh cite Rava’s statement that “a person is obligated to get drunk (<i>livesumei</i>) on Purim until he does not know…” implying that they understand the mitzva according to its simple meaning. The Aramaic word <i>livesumei </i>means to get drunk, as Rashi explains (<i>Megilla</i> 7b). Apparently, this relates to the second category mentioned above – that of a drunk person. In contrast, a person who is as drunk as Lot cannot discern anything, let alone the difference between “Cursed is Haman” and “Blessed is Mordechai.” However, even within the category of a drunk person, there are different levels: 1) one who cannot stand before a king and speak properly; 2) “until he does not know,” which is as I explained in the main text: He cannot discern details, but instead shows an indiscriminate perspective. As the Sages state, “One who puts his eye on his cup (i.e., is drunk), the whole world appears to him like a plain” (<i>Yoma</i> 75a). Such a person forgets his troubles, and everything is for the good in his eyes – both “Cursed is Haman” and “Blessed is Mordechai.” Such a drunk person is liable to disgrace himself. Many authorities maintain that the mitzva to get drunk on Purim refers to this level of drunkenness, and <i>Taz</i> and the Vilna Gaon seem to agree. Ḥakham Zvi and many other great scholars adopted this approach in practice. Raavya 2:564 states that it is a <i>mitzva</i> to get drunk “until he does not know,” but one is not obligated to do so. Apparently, his reasoning is that it is possible to fulfill the mitzva of drinking without reaching this level of drunkenness. From the words of Rif and Rosh, however, it seems that it is obligatory. Even though the Talmud relates that Rabba slaughtered R. Zeira because he was so drunk, implying that it is bad to drink in excess, the fact that Rabba invited R. Zeira to join in his Purim feast again the next year and that R. Zeira was apprehensive about going implies that the mitzva is indeed to get drunk “until he does not know,” in the literal sense (<i>Eshkol</i>, <i>Pri Ḥadash</i>).<br>MT, Laws of <i>Megilla</i> 2:15 states, “One should drink wine until he gets drunk and falls asleep in his drunkenness.” This, in essence, is an intermediate opinion. On the one hand, one must reach the level of “until he does not know,” but he should not do so while awake, because that would mean he is very drunk. Rather, he should fall asleep as a result of his drunkenness. Mahari Brin concurs with this opinion, and it is cited in Rema 695:2.<br>Others maintain that one does not need to get so drunk, because drunkenness is shameful and liable to bring one to commit serious transgressions. So states <i>Orḥot Ḥayim</i>. Similarly, Me’iri states: “We are not commanded to get drunk and degrade ourselves in the process of rejoicing, for the type of joy we are commanded to achieve is not one of debauchery and folly, but one of pleasure that leads to loving God and thanking Him for the miracles He performed on our behalf.” <i>Ha-ma’or</i> states in the name of Rabbeinu Ephraim that the fact that the Gemara related the story of Rabba slaughtering R. Zeira implies that the <i>halakha</i> does not require us to drink “until he does not know.” However, it is clear that even these opinions agree that one must drink enough to become tipsy to the point that it would be forbidden to pray. This is clearly indicated from the discussion concerning the timing of the meal, which the <i>poskim</i> determine should take place a significant amount of time before the time of prayer, since one may not pray immediately after the meal. Furthermore, it is a mitzva to drink more on Purim than one does on Yom Tov, since Purim is a day of <i>mishteh</i>. It is a mitzva to drink on Yom Tov in order to rejoice, and it seems that one must drink at least a <i>revi’it</i> measure (<i>Torah Or</i> 99:3). And since one becomes tipsy after drinking only a <i>revi’it</i>, it follows that on Purim one must drink until he nears the level of drunkenness.<br><i>Tosafot</i> and Ran explain that one must drink enough to occasionally stumble on the words “Cursed is Haman and blessed is Mordechai.” <i>Abudraham</i> explains that there was once a song that required the audience to respond accurately – sometimes “Cursed is Haman” and sometimes “Blessed is Mordechai”; people who were intoxicated would often get confused. <i>Aguda</i> and Rabbeinu Yeruḥam explain that the numerical value of both phrases is the same, and when people drink they find it hard to calculate the numbers. <i>Nimukei Yosef</i> explains that one must drink and joke around until he makes himself appear as if he does not know the difference between Haman and Mordechai. According to these opinions as well, the mitzva is to become tipsy, not drunk. They maintain that the <i>halakha</i> follows Rava, that one must drink “until he does not know,” but that this does not mean getting totally drunk. <i>Shlah</i> and <i>Responsa Rema Mi-Fano</i> maintain a similar position. Upon examining these opinions, we find that the mitzva is to become tipsy or even slightly drunk. This fits with the opinion of <i>Baḥ</i>, which accepts the position of Rabbeinu Ephraim in practice, but states, “One should become tipsy or even drunk to the point that he cannot speak before a king, but he should retain his faculties.” <i>Yad Ephraim</i> also is in this vein, but maintains that Rava’s statement was not rejected. Rather, he meant that one should get drunk <i>until</i> “he does not know,” without actually reaching that extreme level of drunkenness (“<i>ad ve-lo ad bi-khlal</i>”). <i>Sefat Emet</i> and R. Yisrael Salanter also write along these lines, explaining that one must drink all day long, with the goal of being happy, but if he reaches the state of “he does not know,” he becomes exempt from the mitzva of drinking and does not need to continue.</i>"

If one derives greater joy from drinking other beverages, he should drink mostly what he likes best, as, fundamentally, the mitzva is to rejoice. But if he enjoys drinking wine even a little bit, it is best to begin by drinking wine, in commemoration of the miracle.<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Mikra’ei Kodesh</i> (Frank) §44, which cites sources indicating that one must drink wine specifically. However, it seems that in practice, this requirement is only <i>le-khatḥila</i>.

Perhaps this is why the Sages say in <i>Pesaḥim</i> 109a, regarding the mitzva of rejoicing on the festivals, that people should rejoice through what is appropriate for them: men through wine and women through nice clothing. This implies that women cannot rejoice through wine, because drunkenness is degrading for them. See <i>Peninei Halakha</i>: <i>Pesaḥ</i> 16:7 and n. 3, regarding the Four Cups. Nevertheless, it is a mitzva for women to drink a small amount, without getting drunk.</i>",
                    "If one knows that drinking a lot of wine causes him to cry and become depressed, or causes headaches, it is preferable for him to fulfill the mitzva by drinking just a little more than usual. This is because the main objective of the mitzva is to be happy, and if drinking makes one sad, he undermines the mitzva. If, however, he cries out of joy – for example, if he is happy to cry about important things, like the present state of the Jewish people, the rebuilding of the Holy Temple, or his own unrepentant spiritual state – he may fulfill the mitzva by drinking “until he does not know.”",
                    "If one knows that when he gets drunk he goes wild and hurts others, or he ends up wallowing in his own vomit and degrading himself in public, he should not get drunk. Rather, he should fulfill the mitzva by drinking more than usual. Such a person need not bemoan the fact that he cannot control himself when drunk. Even though the Sages state that “When wine enters, a secret comes out” (<i>Eruvin</i> 65a), and thus his actions while drunk seemingly show that he has a deep-seated inclination toward violence and rowdiness, nevertheless, the Sages also say, “The reward is proportionate to the exertion” (<i>Avot</i> 5:23). Since he actually manages to curb his impulses in the course of daily life, it is clear that he continually makes great improvements.<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ḥayei Adam</i>, quoted in BHL 665:2, s.v. “ad,” states that one should not reach a state of drunkenness in which he sins. It is true that I write later on in the name of Rav Kook that, when it comes to missing prayers, we apply the rule “One who is engaged in performing a mitzva is exempt from performing another mitzva.” Nevertheless, all agree that one may not cause oneself to sin. It is true that Rav Kook writes in <i>Mitzvat Re’iyah</i> (Omissions §695) that the performance of a mitzva protects one from harm, proving this from a statement of Rashba; nevertheless, it seems that everyone agrees that one who knows from experience that getting drunk leads him to sin or degradation should not get drunk. It is also obvious that one who feels sad when he drinks heavily should not drink, as Purim is supposed to be a day of feasting and joy. However, if he cries for good things, and enjoys doing so, he may get drunk, and it is even a mitzva to do so. A proof for this is found in <i>Shibolei Ha-leket</i> §93, which cites an aggadic teaching that R. Akiva used to cry on Shabbat, saying that it gave him pleasure. This is quoted in <i>Beit Yosef</i> and Rema, OḤ 288:2, and in MB <i>ad loc</i>.<i> </i>4.</i>",
                    "In order to fulfill the mitzva properly, one must understand that alcohol reaches the height of its influence around twenty minutes after it is ingested. This delay causes some people to make a mistake: When five minutes pass after drinking a cup of wine or hard liquor, and they do not feel any significant change, they think that they need to drink another cup. And when, even then, they feel that they have not fulfilled the mitzva, they drink another cup, and – just to be sure – one more. Then, all of a sudden, the first cup starts taking effect, and then the second, the third, and the fourth. All at once they become very drunk, behave like animals, and begin to vomit, causing much shame and degradation. Therefore, one must know how to drink and rejoice, waiting at least a half-hour between drinks and incorporating one’s drinking into the meal. This way, people will be able to rejoice properly throughout Purim."

                    "It is reasonable to ask: Both in Tanakh and in rabbinic literature (<i>Bamidbar Rabba</i> ch. 10, <i>Vayikra Rabba</i> 12:1), it is made clear that drunkenness is disgraceful and liable to bring one to sin. Why, then, are we commanded to get drunk on Purim? The reason is that all the miracles that God performed for the Jewish people on Purim happened through wine. Vashti was removed from her reign at the wine feast, and Esther then took her place. Haman’s demise occurred at a wine feast as well. We must therefore conclude that although drunkenness is generally disgraceful, one cannot ignore its positive aspects. Through wine, simple joy is made manifest and unconstrained material happiness, filled with strength and vitality, is expressed. Throughout the year, the disrepute and rowdiness that associated with drunkenness overshadow its positive aspects, and thus drunkenness causes many problems. On Purim, however, when we drink and rejoice over God’s salvation, in commemoration of the miracles He performed through drinking – the positive aspects of drinking are expressed.",
                    "There is a deeper reason as well. On Purim, the eternal sanctity of Israel is revealed, and it becomes clear that everything God does to the Jewish people is for the good. Even things that initially seem bad eventually turn out to be for our benefit. Drinking wine for the sake of a mitzva shows that even the material aspect of Israel is holy at its core. Even though the body and its senses seem to impede the service of God, this is reversed on the sublime plane of Purim, when these physical elements greatly enhance our service of God, with joy and vitality.",
                    "Let us delve even deeper. In general, Torah and intellect must guide our lives, and when one follows this path, he is happy, but his happiness is limited by his perception. However, on the lofty level of faith that we reach on Purim, we recognize that God runs the world for the good. Even if His ways are sometimes incomprehensible to us, we disregard our own perceptions and happily accept God’s governing of the world. This is the level of “until he does not know”: cleaving to God Who is beyond human comprehension. This is connected in its entirety to faith through self-sacrifice. With such sublime faith – the faith of the people of Israel – we achieve boundless joy.<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The simple explanation is quoted in <i>Eliya Rabba</i> and BHL 695:2. See also <i>Mitzvat Re’iyah</i> (omissions §695). It is no coincidence that there is another, deeper explanation, as that is the property of good wine – it reveals secrets. At first there is one interpretation, and through this interpretation another is revealed. These three explanations correspond to the three levels of drinking: 1) tipsy; 2) drunk; and 3) very drunk – “until he does not know,” according to its simple meaning. See <i>Torah Or</i> by R. Shneur Zalman of Liadi, “<i>Ḥayav Inish Li-besumei</i>,” pp. 98a-100b, especially 99c-d. In the merit of their natural humility, women can attain all of this by drinking only a small amount of alcohol.</i>"

                    "Most Jews begin the Purim meal in the afternoon, after praying <i>Minḥa</i>. During the morning hours, they are busy sending <i>mishlo’aḥ manot</i> to one another and giving <i>matanot la-evyonim</i>, going out of their way to express love and friendship toward family and friends. When afternoon arrives, it is proper to pray <i>Minḥa</i> before starting the meal; otherwise there is reason to be concerned that people will not be able to pray <i>Minḥa</i> due to drunkenness.",
                    "Some people start the meal very late, just before <i>shki’a</i>, eating most of the meal after dark. Many authorities question this practice, as the mitzva is to eat the meal on Purim, and at <i>tzeit ha-kokhavim </i>the next day already begins. Some answer this objection by pointing out that everything follows the beginning, and since these people start the meal on Purim, its continuation at night is still considered part of the Purim meal. The same rule applies to <i>Birkat Ha-mazon</i>. If one starts the meal during the day and finishes it late at night, he nonetheless recites <i>Al Ha-nisim</i> in <i>Birkat Ha-mazon</i>. Furthermore, it is appropriate to rejoice on the night immediately following the fourteenth of Adar as well, because that is when Purim begins in walled cities. <i>Le-khatḥila</i>, however, it is proper to start the meal when there is plenty of time left in the day. Then, if the meal carries over into the night, no harm is done, because the main part of the meal was eaten during the day.",
                    "Some say that it is preferable to perform the mitzva as early as possible and eat the meal in the morning. This way, whoever gets drunk can become sober by <i>Minḥa</i> time. The prevalent custom, however, is to conduct the meal in the afternoon.<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The explanation behind the custom to start the meal just before <i>shki’a</i> is cited in <i>Terumat Ha-deshen</i> §140. The author and his mentors, however, used to eat the meal in the morning. <i>Shlah</i> encouraged people to eat the meal specifically in the morning. This was also the custom of the Vilna Gaon, and Rashash followed this practice as well, for kabbalistic reasons (<i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 695:23). Rema 695:2 states, based on Maharil, that it is better to eat the meal after praying <i>Minḥa</i> at the earliest time (<i>Minḥa gedola</i>). This is the standard recommendation, which many people follow. Still, others start the meal just before evening, and even some Aḥaronim followed this practice. If the following night is the fifteenth of Adar, there is a mitzva to rejoice on both days in any case (Rema 695:2, MB <i>ad loc. </i>16). Nevertheless, even in Jerusalem, some extend the meal into the following night, based on the rationale that everything follows the beginning of the meal. Moreover, according to Ran, the prohibition of “<i>ve-lo ya’avor </i>(lit. ‘and it shall not pass’)” (Esther 9:27) does not apply to the active <i>mitzvot</i> of Purim, only to the reading of the <i>Megilla</i>. This is why we eat the meal on Sunday, the sixteenth of Adar, on a Triple Purim (see below 17:5). Therefore, one may extend the meal into the night.</i>",
                    "It is praiseworthy to study some Torah before beginning the <i>se’uda</i>, as it is written, “The Jews enjoyed light and gladness, joy and honor” (Esther 8:16); the Sages expound, “‘Light’ refers to Torah.” Through Torah study, one can attain consummate joy (Rema 695:2).",
                    "According to many authorities, one who knows that he may not be able to pray <i>Minḥa</i> or <i>Ma’ariv</i> if he gets drunk should not get drunk (<i>Ḥayei Adam</i>, BHL). However, R. Avraham Yitzḥak Kook writes that one who drinks on Purim is engaged in performing a mitzva, and the rule is that one who is engaged in performing a mitzva is exempt from performing another mitzva (<i>Oraḥ Mishpat</i>, omissions §7)."

                    "A tipsy person is one who is under the influence of alcohol and finds it difficult to concentrate or focus his thoughts, but would still be capable of speaking before a king. A drunk person is one who has drunk so much that he would be incapable of speaking properly before a king.",
                    "Individuals in both of these states may recite <i>Birkhot Ha-nehenin</i>. Even though, <i>le-khatḥila</i>, a drunk person should not recite <i>berakhot</i>, he may recite <i>berakhot </i>that must be recited at a specific point in time. Therefore, on Purim, a drunk person may recite all <i>Birkhot Ha-nehenin</i>, <i>Birkat Ha-mazon</i>, and <i>Asher Yatzar</i>.",
                    "The law regarding prayer is more stringent. One who is tipsy or drunk after finishing the meal must wait to pray <i>Ma’ariv</i> until he is sober and able to pray with a clear mind. If doing so will cause him to miss praying with a <i>minyan</i>, then if he is merely tipsy, he should pray – from a <i>siddur</i> – with the <i>minyan</i>, because the prayer of a tipsy person is acceptable, <i>be-di’avad</i>. If, however, he is truly drunk, he should not pray with the <i>minyan</i>, because the prayer of a drunk person is invalid and considered an abomination.",
                    "If one feels very tired, and there is concern that he will fall asleep and miss praying entirely if he does not pray immediately, the law is as follows. One who is merely tipsy should recite the entire prayer, but one who is drunk should read the <i>Shema</i> without its accompanying <i>berakhot</i> and skip the <i>Amida</i>. This way, he at least discharges his Torah obligation to read the <i>Shema</i>. Furthermore, even if he is overcome by sleep before he manages to pray, he is not viewed as having sinned, because he became drunk for the sake of heaven, and one who is engaged in performing a mitzva is exempt from performing another mitzva. In such a case, he should make up the prayer he missed the next morning by reciting an additional <i>Amida</i> prayer after the <i>Amida</i> for <i>Shaḥarit</i>.",
                    "It seems that if one is unsure whether he is considered tipsy or drunk, he may be lenient on Purim and recite the <i>Amida</i>, since on Purim even the king accepts the drunkards with good spirits, because that is the mitzva of the day.<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See SA and Rema §99, and MB <i>ad loc.</i>, regarding tipsiness and drunkenness. Also see <i>Peninei Halakha</i>: <i>Prayer</i> 5:11 regarding the same issue, and <i>ibid. </i>18:8-10 regarding the laws of making up missed prayers.<br>The allowance for an intoxicated person to pray when time is running out is explained in <i>Yam shel Shlomo</i>, quoted in MB 99:3, 17. Rema rules leniently as well regarding one who drank a <i>revi’it</i> of wine, either because today’s wines are weaker than those of the past or because today we use <i>siddurim </i>when we pray. In my humble opinion, one may certainly be lenient on Purim regarding this issue, because becoming intoxicated is part of the mitzva of the day.</i>"

                    "Alternatively, there is a custom to combine the Purim meal with the first Shabbat meal on Friday night. Some great Torah authorities follow this custom, while others recommend doing so only <i>be-di’avad</i>. In order to follow this custom, one must pray <i>Minḥa</i> and then begin the meal while it is still Purim. Then, around a half-hour before <i>shki’a</i>, one should accept Shabbat by lighting the Shabbat candles, place a covering over the bread, and recite <i>kiddush</i> over wine. Since one has already recited the <i>berakha</i> over wine (<i>Ha-gafen</i>) during the Purim meal, one should omit that <i>berakha</i> in <i>kiddush</i>. After <i>kiddush</i>, one continues the meal, making sure to eat a <i>keveitza</i> of bread, or at least a <i>kezayit</i>, for the Shabbat meal. At the end of the meal, one recites <i>Retzei Ve-haḥalitzenu</i> in <i>Birkat Ha-mazon</i>, adding <i>Al Ha-nisim</i> in the <i>Ha-Raḥaman</i> (“May the Merciful One”) section at the end of the prayer. After the meal, one prays <i>Ma’ariv</i>.<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Responsa</i> <i>Maharil </i>§56 states that when Purim falls out on Friday one may begin the meal before <i>Minḥa ketana</i> (about three hours before the end of the day).

Some Aḥaronim followed this practice as well. <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 271:22 states in the name of Arizal that, <i>le-khatḥila</i>, this should not be done, because one must make <i>kiddush</i> after praying <i>Ma’ariv</i>. According to Me’iri and MA 695:9, one should recite both <i>Retzei</i> and <i>Al Ha-nisim</i> at their regular places. However, MB 695:15 states, based on <i>Ḥayei Adam</i>, that one should not recite <i>Al Ha-nisim</i>. I suggested above that one should recite <i>Al Ha-nisim </i>in the <i>Ha-raḥaman</i> section because it does not affect one’s fulfillment of the mitzva of <i>Birkat Ha-mazon </i>if it is recited there.</i>"

Even though there is no source for this in the writings of the Sages, and the Aḥaronim did not write that one must wear costumes, various reasons have been given for the custom. The first reason is that it increases our joy, as a person with an unusual appearance can be amusing and entertaining. Another reason is that when one departs from his normal attire, he is able to let loose, rejoice, and display his love for his friends. Another reason is that having different modes of dress causes disunity among the Jewish people, and changing our external appearances on Purim breaks down the barriers between us and increases unity. Another reason is that by wearing costumes, we become aware of the degree to which we are influenced by external elements, and as a result, we can focus more on the internal elements that are revealed on Purim. Finally, costumes allude to the fact that even when the Jews look like gentiles on the outside, they remain Jews deep down, as the Purim story made clear.",
                    "Mahari Mintz writes that the custom in the homes of great and pious individuals in Germany was to dress up on Purim; men even wore women’s clothing and women wore men’s clothing (<i>Responsa</i> §16). He comments that one should not think poorly of them, since there is certainly no concern that this is prohibited. After all, the prohibition of <i>lo yilbash </i>(the prohibition against cross-dressing) refers only to wearing the clothing of the opposite gender for purpose of adultery and licentiousness.

Some maintain that if a person changes only one article of clothing, and that person’s sex remains recognizable based on the other garments, one should not denounce him (<i>Pri Megadim</i>).<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to <i>Baḥ</i>, one may be lenient only when there is a real need to wear a garment of the opposite sex.

See <i>Yabi’a Omer</i> YD 6:14.

Shushan, where the miracle actually took place, is the only exception; it is considered a walled city even though the city had not yet been built at the time of Yehoshua bin Nun (SA 688:1).<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Megilla</i> 3b states that a walled city is a city that was surrounded by a wall before its houses were built, or whose houses were built with the intention of surrounding the city afterward with a wall. If, however, the residents built the city without any expressed intent to build a wall and afterward surrounded it with a wall, it is not considered a walled city (SA 688:1). The Gemara continues: “A city in which there are not ten <i>batlanim</i> is reckoned as a village.” According to <i>She’iltot</i> and Ramban, this principle can be applied to Purim. Rambam, <i>Tosafot</i>, Rosh, and many other Rishonim maintain that this law was stated in reference to the other laws of a walled city, but regarding Purim, a place does not need to have ten <i>batlanim</i> in order to be considered a city. SA 688:1 rules according to this opinion. See MB <i>ad loc.</i> 2. What are <i>batlanim</i>?

According to Ramban, Rashba, and Ritva, however, they do not have to remain unemployed; they simply need to attend the synagogue services in the morning and the evening on a consistent basis.</i>",
                    "When the Men of the Great Assembly instituted the holiday of Purim, many large cities, especially in Eretz Yisrael, had a tradition that they had been surrounded by a wall at the time of Yehoshua bin Nun. The residents of these cities, therefore, celebrated Purim on the fifteenth of Adar. Over the centuries, however, these cities have been destroyed, and the traditions regarding their status have been lost. Some modern cities, like Lod, have the same name as cities that were known to have been surrounded by a wall at the time of Yehoshua bin Nun. The problem is that we do not know with certainty whether the modern city is located exactly where the city stood in Yehoshua’s time, or perhaps it is simply named after the ancient city but is actually situated somewhere else nearby. Some ancient cities became devoid of Jews, and we do not know whether they existed at the time of Yehoshua, because the traditions regarding their status were lost. There are other cities, such as Hebron, that we know existed at the time, though we do not know if they had a wall. There is only one city concerning which there is a clear tradition that it was surrounded by a wall at the time of Yehoshua bin Nun: our holy and glorious city of Jerusalem. Jerusalem is the only place where Purim is celebrated nowadays on the fifteenth of Adar. We will first elaborate on the laws of Jerusalem and then discuss the laws of the various uncertain places.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Responsa Divrei Yosef</i> (Schwartz) §2 states that Jerusalem is the only place about which we are certain that it was surrounded by a wall. Take Hebron, for example: According to Radbaz 2:681, it was not surrounded by a wall (see <i>Teḥumin</i>, vol. 1. pp. 122-123), whereas Ḥida writes that the Jews there had a custom to read the <i>Megilla</i> on the fifteenth as well (<i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 688:17). Regarding Lod, <i>Megilla</i> 4a states clearly that it is a walled city. However, it is uncertain whether modern Lod is located exactly where the ancient city of Lod stood. Therefore, we treat it as an uncertainty. This is how R. Ovadia Yosef rules in <i>Yabi’a Omer</i> 7:60. As for Tiberias, <i>Megilla</i> 5b explains that it has an uncertain status because one side of the city was not walled; it bordered on the sea. In general, even if we would discover a city that has remnants of an ancient wall from the time of Yehoshua bin Nun, it would still be unclear whether the city was built with the intention of surrounding it with a wall, as that is the only way a city can be considered walled. R. Shaul Yisraeli suggested that if the walls of an ancient city are buried beneath the ground and the houses of the modern city are built above the height of the walls, the modern city is not considered walled (cited in <i>Teḥumin</i> vol. 1, p. 126). See the same source for a lengthy discussion concerning the town of Beit El, which is located around a kilometer away from the excavations of the ancient city of Beit El. On p. 128, R. Sraya Deblitzky states, based on <i>Igrot Ha-Re’iyah</i> §423, that one should not determine <i>halakha</i> based on archeological evidence. See p. 130, which cites the ruling of my father and teacher, R. Zalman Melamed, that residents of Beit El should celebrate Purim only on the fourteenth of Adar.</i>"

Therefore, not only do the residents of the Old City of Jerusalem celebrate Purim on the fifteenth of Adar, but so do the residents of all the neighborhoods adjacent to the Old City. Even though the city has expanded greatly over the years, each and every neighborhood takes on the status of the Old City and reads the <i>Megilla</i> on the fifteenth, since each one is adjacent to the one next to it.",
                    "While the neighborhoods of Jerusalem were still being built, a question arose regarding the status of neighborhoods that were originally built far away from the rest of the city. Most recently, this question came up regarding the neighborhoods of Ramot and Har Nof. Some authorities maintain that only neighborhoods to which there is a continuous stretch of houses from the Old City are considered part of Jerusalem. If, however, there is a gap of 141 and one third <i>amot</i> (67.8 meters) between the two areas, they are considered separate locations. Accordingly, these authorities ruled that residents of Ramot and Har Nof must read the <i>megilla</i> on the fourteenth.",
                    "Others maintain that all neighborhoods that are considered part of the Jerusalem municipality for tax purposes – and all the more so if they are surrounded by the same <i>eruv</i> – take on the status of Jerusalem and read the <i>Megilla</i> exclusively on the fifteenth. Thus, they ruled that residents of Har Nof and Ramot must read the <i>Megilla</i> on the fifteenth. The former Chief Rabbis of Jerusalem, R. Shalom Messas and R. Yitzḥak Kulitz, ruled in this manner, and this is the prevalent custom. All of these rulings were decided, over time, as Jerusalem expanded. With the help of God, Builder of Jerusalem, the city will continue to be built up, and even the furthest neighborhoods eventually become adjacent and linked to the rest of the city, until it becomes clear to all that they are considered part of Jerusalem.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Megilla</i> 3b states that if a place is “adjoining, even if it is not visible” or “visible, even if it is not adjoining,” then it is considered part of the walled city. Rashi, Rabbeinu Ḥananel, Raavan, <i>Or Zaru’a</i>, Rashba, Me’iri, and Ritva explain that if a place is not visible from an adjacent walled city, it is considered part of the city as long as it is within a <i>mil</i> (912 meters) of the city. But if the place is visible from the walled city, it is considered part of the city even if it is more than a <i>mil</i> away. They ask: Is the place still considered part of the walled city if it can be seen from the city, but is very far from it? Me’iri explains that the Gemara refers to a place that is subordinate to the city and considered part of the same district. Similarly, Ritva writes that this law applies only when residents of the surrounding villages participate in the affairs of the city.<br>In contrast, Rambam maintains that even a place from which a walled city can be seen is not considered part of the city if it is more than a <i>mil</i> away. The only distinction is that when the city is visible, we measure the <i>mil</i> as the crow flies, and when it is not visible, we measure it by a straight, terrestrial line (Maharitatz §120). Alternatively, when the city is visible, we measure a <i>mil</i>; and when it is not visible, the nearby place takes on the status of the walled city only if it truly adjacent – on the outskirts of the city (Maharam Alashkar). That is, if there is a distance of 70 and two thirds <i>amot</i> between the two places, and the walled city is not visible, they are considered separate places. And if there are two neighborhoods, the distance is doubled – 141 and one third <i>amot</i>. Ran, <i>Roke’aḥ</i>, and <i>Ohel Mo’ed</i> concur. The Aḥaronim disagree about the opinion of SA 688:2. According to MA and others, SA agrees with Rashi and most Rishonim. <i>Pri Ḥadash</i> and others claim that SA concurs with Rambam.<br>The reason that places adjacent to or within view of a walled city take on the status of the city is that they are subordinate to and reliant on it. This can be inferred from the words of Ritva, who writes that residents of these places come to take refuge within the city’s walls in times of danger. <i>Turei Even</i> 3:2 and <i>Ḥatam Sofer</i>, OḤ 193 explain that the reason is in order not to separate between people who live close to each other.<br>Practically speaking, MB 688:6 and SHT <i>ad loc.</i> 7 maintain that the first opinion is the primary one. <i>Yabi’a Omer</i> 7:58-59 states that one should take the second opinion into consideration as well, especially since residents of walled cities can satisfy their obligation, <i>be-di’avad</i>, by reading the <i>Megilla</i> on the fourteenth.<br>How exactly do we measure the distance between a walled city and a place that can be seen from it? Some maintain that we measure only from areas that are actually walled (<i>Yabi’a Omer</i> 7:59:1), while others maintain that the measurement begins from the edges of the expanded city. Another dispute concerns whether the residents of the place need to be able to see all – or at least most of – the walled city (this appears to be Me’iri’s position, and R. Ḥayim Palachi writes this explicitly), or if it is sufficient for them to be able to see a small part of the city (Maharil Diskin, <i>Mikra’ei Kodesh </i>[Frank] §24)?<br>In practice, the former Chief Rabbis of Jerusalem, R. Shalom Messas (<i>Shemesh U-magen</i> 1:51-52, 2:16-17) and R. Yitzḥak Kulitz, maintained that all neighborhoods that are part of Jerusalem for the purposes of paying municipal taxes read the <i>Megilla</i> exclusively on the fifteenth. They ruled this way even for the residents of Ramot and Har Nof. R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach concurs. Moreover, in his opinion, the outlying areas would read the <i>Megilla</i> on the fifteenth even if they were separate entities for tax purposes, because there is an <i>eruv</i> that connects these neighborhoods to the city of Jerusalem (<i>Halikhot Shlomo</i> 20:8-9). These authorities also relied on the majority opinion of the Rishonim, who maintain that “adjacent and visible” is measured from the farthest outskirts of the expanded city. <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 688:10 suggests a novel idea: that the definition of a <i>mil</i> is the amount of time it takes to travel a <i>mil</i>; R. Messas mentions this suggestion as additional support for his ruling. My teachers, R. Avraham Shapiro, R. Mordechai Eliyahu, and R. Shaul Yisraeli, also endorsed, in practice, the halakhic determination that all neighborhoods of Jerusalem should read the <i>Megilla</i> on the fifteenth, with a <i>berakha</i> (<i>Mikra’ei Kodesh</i> [Harari] 5:11 and n. 43).<br>In contrast, several great authorities maintain that the rule is as follows: Any neighborhood within a <i>mil</i> of the wall itself reads on the fifteenth, even if the entire area in between is empty. However, when measuring from a point in the expanded city, an empty area of 141 and a third <i>amot</i> constitutes a gap between Jerusalem and that neighborhood, and thus its residents must read on the fourteenth, with a <i>berakha</i>. This is the opinion of <i>Yabi’a Omer</i> 7:58 and <i>Or Le-Tziyon</i> 1:45. <i>Ḥazon Ish</i> 153:2-3 and <i>Mikra’ei Kodesh</i> (Frank) §23 also rule similarly, but they ruled that the residents of Giv’at Sha’ul should read the <i>Megilla</i> on the fifteenth, despite the fact that hundreds of meters of undeveloped land separated between that neighborhood and the rest of the city at the time. Apparently, they ruled this way because the residents of Giv’at Shaul were dependent on the city for all their affairs. <i>Minḥat Yitzḥak</i> 8:62 ruled that the residents of Ramot should read the <i>Megilla</i> on the fourteenth. The same is reported in the name of R. Yosef Shalom Elyashiv. Several years later, however, when Ramot expanded, R. Elyashiv changed his ruling and instructed residents of Ramot to read the <i>Megilla </i>on the fifteenth (even though there is an undeveloped area of more than 141 and a third <i>amot</i> between it and the main part of the city).<br>A bigger question arose regarding Mevaseret Yerushalayim, which is, indeed, connected to Jerusalem by the <i>eruv</i>, but is its own municipality. According to the second opinion stated above, its residents certainly must read the <i>Megilla</i> on the fourteenth, and some actually do so. According to the first opinion, however, they should read it on the fifteenth, because from some parts of Mevaseret, one can see the outskirts of expanded Jerusalem. In addition, its residents are dependent on Jerusalem to a degree, and, as already mentioned, the two cities are joined by an <i>eruv</i>. R. Messas ruled in accordance with this opinion, and R. Uri Cohen, head of the Meretz Kollel there, implemented this ruling in practice. See <i>Oraḥ Mishpat</i> §146, which states similarly regarding Bayit Vegan in 1920. (Bayit Vegan in those days was like Mevaseret Yerushalayim today.)<br>From 1948 to 1967, the Old City of Jerusalem was under Jordanian occupation. Because of this, the question arose: Should those residing in neighborhoods adjacent to the Old City celebrate Purim on the fifteenth, even though the area within the walls itself is bereft of Jews? <i>Masat Moshe</i> 2:3 and <i>Birkei Yosef</i> state that in such a situation, the <i>Megilla</i> is read on the fourteenth. The Vilna Gaon maintains, based on the Yerushalmi, that it is read on the fifteenth. Rashba and Ritva concur, and this was the practice in Jerusalem in those days. The proponents of this viewpoint suggest another rationale: Ancient Jerusalem was larger than the area known today as the Old City. R. Zvi Pesaḥ Frank accepted this in practice, recording his ruling in both <i>Har Tzvi</i> 2:131 and <i>Mikra’ei Kodesh</i> §25. It is worth adding that the whole reason Jews came to the new side of Jerusalem was in order to draw closer to the holy ancient Jerusalem. For this reason, all neighborhoods of Jerusalem are subordinate to it in all matters.</i>"

                    "There is uncertainty about when to celebrate Purim in the following cities: Tiberias, Hebron, Shechem, Jaffa, Lod, Gaza, Tzefat, Akko, and Haifa. Some add the following cities to the list: Beit She’an, Jericho, Beersheba, Ramla. In addition, the following cities outside the Land of Israel have uncertain status: Tyre, Sidon, Damascus, Izmir, and Baghdad.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Mikra’ei Kodesh</i> (Harari) 5:11 (pp. 101-107), which specifies the uncertainty and outlines the custom of each city. There are two possible reasons for uncertainty: 1) whether the city had a wall at the time of Yehoshua bin Nun (and even if it did, perhaps the wall was erected after the houses were built); 2) whether the city is currently located in the same place as in ancient times. Some cities are uncertain for both reasons, while others are uncertain for only one reason. The cities enumerated in the first list were more likely surrounded by a wall, while for those in the second list this were less likely. Consequently, fewer people customarily read the <i>Megilla</i> on the fifteenth in those places.</i>",
                    "The Rishonim disagree about how residents of cities of uncertain status should conduct themselves on Purim. All agree that the <i>Megilla</i> must be read on the fourteenth of Adar, with a <i>berakha</i>, in these cities, since even a resident of Jerusalem fulfills his obligation, <i>be-di’avad</i>, if he reads the <i>Megilla </i>on the fourteenth, when most of the world reads it. Therefore, in places of uncertain status, the <i>Megilla </i>must be read, <i>le-khatḥila</i>, on the fourteenth, with a <i>berakha</i>. The question is whether residents of these places must read it on the fifteenth as well.",
                    "Some maintain that residents of uncertain places celebrate Purim exclusively on the fourteenth, with no obligation whatsoever to read the <i>Megilla</i> on the fifteenth. Only those who wish to follow a pious custom read it on the fifteenth without a <i>berakha</i> (Ramban, Rashba, Ran, Ritva).",
                    "Others maintain that in places of uncertain status, the <i>Megilla</i> must be read on the fifteenth as well, without a <i>berakha</i>, so that the uncertainty surrounding these cities is not forgotten. An additional reason is to enhance the honor of Eretz Yisrael. Nevertheless, the <i>berakha</i> is omitted because of the uncertainty of the matter (MT, Laws of <i>Megilla </i>1:11, Me’iri, <i>Shibolei Ha-leket</i>, SA 688:4). The <i>poskim</i> debate the matter of the other <i>mitzvot</i> of Purim – <i>mishlo’aḥ manot</i>,<i> matanot la-evyonim</i>,<i> </i>and <i>se’uda</i>. Some maintain that residents of uncertain cities observe these <i>mitzvot</i> only on the first day, which is Purim for most of the world (<i>Pri Ḥadash</i>). Others maintain that they must perform these <i>mitzvot</i> on the second day as well (Ri’az).<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Megilla</i> 5b relates that the <i>amora </i>Ḥizkiya read the <i>Megilla</i> in Tiberias on both the fourteenth and the fifteenth, because although the city was walled on three sides, the fourth side bordered on the sea, and thus it was uncertain whether the city was considered walled. In addition, R. Asi read the <i>Megilla</i> in Hutzal on both the fourteenth and the fifteenth, because it was uncertain whether it was walled at the time of Yehoshua bin Nun.<br>According to Ramban, Rashba, Ran, and Ritva, based on the Ge’onim, those who live in cities of uncertain status read the <i>Megilla</i> exclusively on the fourteenth, with a <i>berakha</i>. Technically, they do not need to read the <i>Megilla</i> at all, because we are lenient in cases of uncertainty about a rabbinic law. However, in order to avoid canceling the mitzva altogether for such people, the Sages established that they read it on the fourteenth, like the majority of the world. Ḥizkiya and R. Asi were merely following a pious custom by reading it on the fifteenth as well. In contrast to the Rishonim mentioned above, Rambam, <i>Shibolei Ha-leket</i>, Me’iri, and SA 688:4 maintain that <i>halakha</i> requires residents of cities of uncertain status to read the <i>Megilla</i> on both days – on the first day with a <i>berakha</i> and on the second day without a <i>berakha</i>. (According to Ri’az, they recite a <i>berakha</i> on both days, while according to R. Yeḥiel, they omit the <i>berakha</i> both days.)<br>Seemingly, one could ask: How can these people recite a <i>berakha</i> over the <i>Megilla</i> reading on the fourteenth when it is uncertain if their city is considered unwalled? The answer is that the Yerushalmi (<i>y. Megilla</i> 1:1, 1:3, 2:3) states that, <i>be-di’avad,</i> a resident of a walled city who reads the <i>Megilla</i> on the fourteenth fulfills his obligation. It is true that <i>Pri Ḥadash</i> §688 and several other Aḥaronim state that the Bavli disagrees with this, and according to them, a resident of a walled city who reads the <i>Megilla </i>on the fourteenth does not fulfill his obligation. Nonetheless, <i>Pri Megadim</i>, <i>Mishbetzot Zahav</i> 688:2 and other Aḥaronim maintain that the Bavli agrees with the Yerushalmi. In addition, Vilna Gaon 688:4 explains that this is the basis for the opinion of Rambam and SA. This is also how the position of Ramban and Rashba is explained. Therefore, residents of uncertain cities read the <i>Megilla</i> on the fourteenth, with a <i>berakha</i>.<br>Rashba, Ritva, and the Vilna Gaon write that the practice of reading the <i>Megilla</i> on both days in uncertain cities applies only in Eretz Yisrael. Others disagree; see MA 688:4. <i>Ben Ish Ḥai</i> (<i>Tetzaveh</i> 14) states that in Baghdad the custom was to read the <i>Megilla</i> on both days.<br>According to Ri’az and MA 688:5, when there is uncertainty regarding a city’s status, its residents observe all the <i>mitzvot</i> of Purim on both days. <i>Pri Ḥadash</i> and <i>Mateh Yehuda</i> maintain that reading the <i>Megilla</i> is the only mitzva that is performed on both days. <i>Binyan Shlomo</i> explains that the mitzva of reading the <i>Megilla</i> was instituted by the prophets, while the other <i>mitzvot</i> were rabbinically mandated, which is why we are more lenient regarding the other <i>mitzvot </i>when there is an uncertainty. (See MB 688:10, which sides with MA, whereas BHL§695 agrees with <i>Pri Ḥadash</i>. Perhaps the distinction is that he rules leniently when it comes to <i>mitzvot</i> that require monetary outlay.) <i>Igeret Ha-Purim</i> states that the custom in Hebron and Tiberias is only to read the <i>Megilla</i> on the fifteenth, not to observe the other <i>mitzvot</i>. The author of <i>Ben Ish Ḥai</i> observed all of the <i>mitzvot</i> on both days. The Aḥaronim disagree about whether there is Torah reading (<i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 688:25). Regarding <i>Al Ha-nisim</i>, MB 693:6 states that one should recite it on the second day as well, while <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 688:23 states, based on R. Ḥayim Vital, that one should not recite it.</i> People who live adjacent to cities of uncertain status observe Purim exclusively on the fourteenth, as only those who live adjacent to a city that reads the <i>Megilla</i> on the fifteenth with certainty take on its status, not those who live adjacent to a city of uncertain status. However, some authorities rule stringently, stating that even in places that are near a city of uncertain status, the <i>Megilla</i> should be read on the fifteenth as well.<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to <i>Birkei Yosef</i> 688:9, cited in BHL 688:2, people who live near a city of uncertain status read the <i>Megilla</i> only on the fourteenth. <i>Pe’at Ha-shulḥan</i> 3:15 states that the villages near Tzefat read it on both days. <i>Ḥazon Ish</i> 153:3 concurs; for this reason, Ḥazon Ish required the residents of Bnei Brak, which is close to Jaffa, to read the <i>Megilla</i> on the fifteenth. However, we already learned that, according to many Rishonim, technically, one does not need to read the <i>Megilla </i>on the fifteenth even in places of uncertain status. Therefore, in a nearby village, there are two uncertainties (<i>sfek sfeika</i>), and so we rule leniently. In addition, perhaps one could claim that this strengthens the opinion that even in the city of uncertain status itself the <i>Megilla </i>should be read only on the fourteenth. After all, one of the explanations given for why a place adjacent to a walled city takes on the status of the city is that we want to avoid separating between people who live as neighbors (<i>Turei Even</i> and <i>Ḥatam Sofer</i>, as cited above in n. 3). If residents of a place adjacent to a city of uncertain status would celebrate Purim only on the fourteenth, while the residents of the city itself celebrate on the fifteenth as well, they will be divided. Therefore, it is proper for residents of the uncertain place to follow the practice of those who live adjacent to them and observe only the fourteenth, especially since most Rishonim (based on the Ge’onim) espouse this opinion.</i>",
                    "In practice, most uncertain places today rely on the lenient opinion and celebrate Purim exclusively on the fourteenth. Only in places where the likelihood that it was truly a walled city is greater, like in Tiberias and Hebron, do many people customarily read the <i>Megilla</i> on the fifteenth as well. Some even fulfill Purim’s other <i>mitzvot</i> on the fifteenth as well in these cities."

                    "Since Purim is celebrated in unwalled cities on the fourteenth and in walled cities (today, only in Jerusalem) on the fifteenth, many questions arise regarding one who travels from an unwalled city to Jerusalem, or vice versa. When should such a person observe the holiday of Purim? The general rule is that a person’s obligation is determined by his location on the day of Purim, not by his permanent residence throughout the year, because one who stays in an unwalled city for even one day is nonetheless considered a resident of an unwalled city with respect to the laws of Purim. The determining moment is <i>alot ha-shaḥar </i>(dawn) – on the fourteenth for unwalled cities, and on the fifteenth for walled cities – because that is when the obligation of the daytime <i>Megilla</i> reading begins.",
                    "A resident of Jerusalem who wants to celebrate Purim on the fourteenth must enter an unwalled city on or before the night of the fourteenth and remain there until after <i>alot ha-shaḥar</i>. This way, he is considered a resident of an unwalled city according to all opinions. Then, even if he returns to Jerusalem early in the morning, before managing to read the <i>Megilla</i>, he remains obligated to read the <i>Megilla</i> on that day – the fourteenth – in Jerusalem. In such a case, he should appoint someone who is staying in an unwalled city to be his <i>shali’aḥ</i> to give <i>matanot la-evyonim </i>and <i>mishlo’aḥ manot </i>on his behalf. If, on the other hand, a resident of Jerusalem enters an unwalled city on the night of the fourteenth with intention to return to Jerusalem before <i>alot ha-shaḥar</i> of the fourteenth, or if he first enters the unwalled city after <i>alot ha-shaḥar</i> of the fourteenth, and he returns later on to Jerusalem, he is still considered a resident of Jerusalem, because the determining time is <i>alot ha-shaḥar</i> of the fourteenth.",
                    "If a resident of an unwalled city celebrates Purim on the fourteenth and wants to celebrate the holiday again on the fifteenth, in Jerusalem, he must come to Jerusalem on the night of the fifteenth and stay there until after <i>alot ha-shaḥar</i> of the fifteenth. This way, he is considered a resident of Jerusalem for the day and must fulfill all the <i>mitzvot</i> of Purim on the fifteenth. However, he should try to hear the <i>berakhot</i> for the <i>Megilla</i> from someone else – and if he reads the <i>Megilla</i> for himself, he should omit the <i>berakhot</i> altogether – because some authorities maintain that one who already observed Purim on the fourteenth does not need to observe it a second time (based on Rosh). Even though he is halakhically required to observe Purim on the fifteenth as well, when it comes to reciting the <i>berakhot</i>, we take into account the opinion of those who rule that he is exempt and therefore omit the <i>berakhot</i>. One who is going to be in Jerusalem from the night of the fourteenth all the way through the day of the fifteenth must observe Purim only in Jerusalem, and he may recite the <i>berakhot</i> over the <i>Megilla</i> on the fifteenth according to all opinions.",
                    "The Rishonim debate the case of a resident of Jerusalem who traveled to an unwalled city on the night of the fourteenth and planned to return to Jerusalem before <i>alot ha-shaḥar</i>,<i> </i>but was delayed and did not manage to return in time. Some authorities maintain that his status is determined by his intentions, and thus he is exempt from observing Purim on the fourteenth (Rif, Ramban). Others maintain that we consider only his actions, and thus he must observe Purim on the fourteenth (Rashi, <i>Ha-ma’or</i>). Within the opinion that his status is determined by his intentions, some maintain that his status is determined by his intention at the time that he traveled to that location (<i>Mishna Berura</i>), and others maintain that his status is determined by his intention when Purim begins. In practice, in both cases one should observe the <i>mitzvot</i> of Purim without reciting <i>berakhot</i>. If added uncertainties arise, one should consult a competent rabbi.<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This issue is very detailed and complicated. Therefore, I wrote this section in a way that is suitable for everyone, summarizing the disputes very briefly. See <i>Torat Ha-mo’adim</i> 6:9-10, which rules that the law generally follows one’s location, and <i>Hilkhot Ḥag Be-ḥag</i> ch. 9, which rules that the law generally follows one’s intentions. There are many more distinctions regarding this issue; see <i>ibid. </i>and <i>Piskei Teshuvot</i> 688:9-10, which expands upon the topic in great detail.<br>The determining time is <i>alot ha-shaḥar</i> because that is when the obligation for the daytime <i>Megilla</i> reading – which is the primary reading – begins. Several <i>poskim</i> write that <i>halakha</i> actually implies that in order to become obligated, one must stay there long enough after <i>alot ha-shaḥar </i>to be able to read the <i>Megilla</i>, which is approximately half an hour (see SHT 688:17).<br>I wrote in the main text that the determining time is <i>alot ha-shaḥar</i> of the fourteenth and of the fifteenth, as that is the opinion of Rashi, Ramban, Ritva, Ri’az, SA, and others. Rosh, however, maintains that <i>alot ha-shaḥar </i>of the fourteenth is the only determinant. Accordingly, one can never obligate himself to observe two Purims. In consideration of his opinion, one does not recite the <i>berakhot</i> over the <i>Megilla</i> reading on the second day. Furthermore, according to most <i>poskim</i>, based on the Yerushalmi, it turns out that one who will be in Jerusalem on the fourteenth and in Tel Aviv on the fifteenth is exempt from observing Purim altogether. According to Rosh, however, since he knows on the night of the fourteenth that he does not intend to be in Jerusalem on the fifteenth, he must observe Purim on the fourteenth, and some say on the fifteenth as well.</i>"

When the fifteenth falls out on Shabbat, Purim in that year is called <i>Purim Ha-meshulash </i>(“Triple Purim”), because its <i>mitzvot</i> are divided over three days. Why don’t we celebrate Purim on Shabbat? The Sages prohibited us from reading the <i>Megilla</i> on Shabbat for fear that one may carry it through a public domain. It is also inappropriate to conduct the <i>se’uda </i>on Shabbat, because it says, “To observe them as (lit. ‘to <i>make</i> them’) days of feasting and joy” (Esther 9:22), which means that the meal must be <i>made</i> for the sake of Purim, not Shabbat.

On the other hand, we may partake in the <i>se’uda</i> only once the day of the miracle has arrived, which is Shabbat.
