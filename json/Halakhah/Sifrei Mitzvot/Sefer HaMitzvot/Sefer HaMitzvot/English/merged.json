            "The Rambam's Introduction": [
                "Since we have already put out the famous composition that we called the Commentary on the Mishnah - and it was our intention in that composition to briefly explain the law from the Mishnah, but our intention was not to be exhaustive in the laws of each commandment, nor to bring all that is necessary about what is forbidden or permissible and obligated or exempt, as is clear to one who carefully studies that composition - I have also seen fit to write a composition that  includes all of the laws of the Torah and their regulations, such that nothing be missing from it. And in it, I will follow my custom of leaving out mention of disagreements and rejected statements. Rather, I will only bring the final law. This composition will include all of the laws of Moshe's Torah - those that are necessary during the time of exile and those that are not necessary. I have also found it proper to remove the lengthiness and authority [involved] in mentioning those that possessed traditions, such that I will not say, \"these are the words of Rabbi x,\" or \"Rabbi y says this and that\" about each statement. Rather I will more generally mention the sages of the Mishnah and the sages of the Talmud, peace be upon them, at the beginning of the composition. I will mention that all of the regulations of the Torah - and that is the oral (orally transmitted) Torah - were passed down from x and from y, up until Ezra and up until our teacher, Moshe. And with each and every one, I will mention those that received it from him. All of this is for the sake of brevity. And I also saw fit not to write it in the parlance of the books of prophecy (Biblical Hebrew), because that parlance is too limited, in order for us to use it in explaining all the content of the laws. And I will also not write it in the parlance of the Talmud, since only a few among the people of our nation would understand it; and since some of its words are foreign or difficult even for those who are experts in Talmud. Rather I will write it in the parlance of the Mishnah, in order to make it simpler for most people. In it, I will include everything that has been certified and clarified about the Torah's words - such that there not be any imperative question missing, which I will not address or not [at least] address the root from which the question stems, [so that it can be seen] quickly without [requiring] in-depth study. For my intention in this is both brevity and completeness; such that everything be found in it that is found in the Mishnah, the Talmud, the Sifra, the Sifrei and the Tosefta - and that which the later Geonim deduced, clarified and explained - about that which is forbidden or permissible, impure or pure, disqualified or fit, obligated or exempt, requiring payment or not requiring payment and requiring an oath or being exempted from an oath. In general, [it will be written so] that in order to know any matter from the Torah that one needs - whether from the Torah [itself] or rabbinic - he not need any other book after the Torah besides it.",
                "And once I had the intention of this purpose in mind, I gave thought to which way I should divide this composition and its sections. Would it be more fitting if I divided it according to the division of the Mishnah and let its approach suffice? Or should I divide it differently and arrange its sequence according to what is required for its analysis, so it would lend itself more easily to study? And it appears to me that it would be best for its division to be according to the various laws instead of the tractates of the Mishnah - such that one would say, the Laws of the Sukkah; the Laws of Tefillin; the Laws of of Tzitzit; and the Laws of the Mezuzah - and that I divide the topic into chapters and laws, as is done in the Mishnah. So, by way of illustration, there would be a first, second and third chapter in the Laws of Tefillin; and each chapter would be divided into laws. In this way, one who so desires may more easily memorize it or call up an item from memory. And it is clear that since the division is in this way - whether it is a positive or negative commandment, it would not be fitting to divide its laws into two topics. Rather anything that needs to be subdivided will be included in [different] chapters within that category. So sometimes there will be several commandments within one category - whether because one topic unites them or whether because the commandments have the same intent. So, for example, when I speak about idolatry, I will call the category, the Laws of Idolatry and I will attach many laws of many commandments to it: The inciter and the instigator; one who passes another to Molekh; one who prophesies in its name; one who worships it; and other commandments besides this that pertain exclusively to idolatry. And likewise when I discuss the laws of prohibitions of the altar, I will speak about leaven and honey; animals with defects; the wage of a prostitute and the sale revenue of a dog; and that which is similar to them in this category. For all of these commandments have one thing which unifies them, and that is that they are all things that are forbidden as sacrifices.",
                "And because of this intention, I came to the conclusion and saw fit that I first write a list of all the commandments - both positive and negative - at the beginning of the book before I divide the book into their categories, so that no commandment escape without completing the discussion of its laws: Whether a specific discussion like that of sukkah or lulav or tzitzit - for each one of these warrant a specific discussion - or whether within a category of commandments like those which we mentioned. In that case - after we have mentioned [the category] - we shall say that these laws of idolatry have x positive commandments and these and those are them; and y negative commandments and these and those are them. All of this is to make sure that no matter is absent from [the composition], such that I not speak about it. And by mentioning all of the commandments by number, I will be sure about this.",
                "But after I decided about this matter and began my efforts to write this book and mention all of the commandments plainly at the beginning of the book - according to their count - I was disturbed by a root issue that has been on my mind for many years. And that is that those that have listed the commandments have confused many matters, such that I cannot even recount the greatness of their disgrace. For all who begin to list them or to write a book that speaks about this intent are all drawn after the words of the author of the Halakhot Gedolot (Behag). And they all only differed from his approach a tiny bit in their counts, as if they were all frozen in front of this man's word. This is so much the case that I saw that the author of the famous Sefer HaMitzvot (of Rav Chefetz Gaon) noticed a small part of the confusion of the Behag and pushed away the counting - which the Behag had done - of visiting the sick and comforting the mourners; yet while what he pushed off was indeed off, he himself added things that were even further off. Moreover, he followed him in things that were worse, as will be clear to the one who studies our essay here. And God, may He blessed, knows, and His testimony is enough, that all that I have seen about their confusion - that they count things that one can see are not fit to be counted from the very first observation, and that they have followed each other without much observation - is a terrible misfortune to me. And to me, it has actualized the need for the [prophetic statement] to be fulfilled: \"So that all prophecy has been to you like the words of a sealed document; if it is handed to one who can read and he is asked to read it, he will say, 'I can’t, because it is sealed'\" (Isaiah 29:11).",
                "And likewise have all of the many <i>azharot</i> (liturgical renderings of the commandments) - that are composed here in the land of Spain that I have heard - seized me with pangs, upon seeing the fame of this matter and its spread. And even though they are not to be blamed, for their authors were poets and not rabbis - and from the angle of their craft, they fulfilled that which was appropriate for them, with the sweetness of the lyric and the beauty of the arrangement - yet they were drawn in their meaning after the Behag and the other later rabbis. And when I reflected upon this and realized the fame of the matter among the masses, I knew that if I mentioned the true count that is fitting to count plainly without proof, even the first reader to read it will be certain that it is a mistake. And he will see it as a mistake, since he will see that it is different than that which was mentioned by x and y. For this is what happens in our time among the 'treasured people' - that they do not examine a statement according to its content, but rather by whether the statement agrees with the statement of those who preceded him, without examining that earlier statement. All the more so is this the case with the masses.",
                "Hence I saw fit to preface the composition that I mentioned with an essay. And that is this essay that explains the topic of the commandments and how it is fit to count them. And I will bring proofs about this from verses of the Torah and the statements of the Sages as [their] explanation. And I will begin with principles that are appropriate to rely upon concerning the commandments and their count. And when their number is validated in this essay with clear proof - that has no doubt - the mistake of all those who counted differently than our count will become clear. And we do not need to respond to each one specifically to explain his mistake. As, for those that seek it, the intended goal and purpose of this essay will be accomplished without it. And that is because I will explain all of the commandments and count them one one by one, and bring a proof about anything that may be questionable. And my intention in this essay is not to explain the laws of any of the commandments, but rather just their [inclusion in the] count. So if I explain something about them when I mention them, I will be explaining it only in terms of [its] designation, such that it be known what a particular command or prohibition is talking about. And once you arrive at knowing their count with their proofs from this essay, I will mention them plainly at the beginning of the general composition, as we mentioned.",
                "So I will now begin to mention the principles that are appropriate to rely upon in the count of the commandments, and they are fourteen. But first I will preface:",
                "All of the commandments that are included in the book of the Torah that was given to us by God, may He be blessed, are 613. Of that, there are 248 positive commandments, the number of a person's limbs; and 365 negative commandments, the number of days in the solar year. And this number is mentioned about the commandments at the end of the Gemara,  Makkot (Makkot 23b). They said, \"There were 613 commandments stated to Moshe at Sinai, 365 corresponding to the number of days in the solar year, and 248 corresponding to the number of a person’s limbs.\" And they also said in homiletical style (see Tanchuma, Ki Tetzeh) that since the positive commandments are the number of the limbs, it is to say that each and every limb is saying to one, \"Do a commandment with me\"; and since the negative commandments are the number of the days of the year, it is to say that each and every day is saying to a person, \"Do not do a sin upon me.\" And this was not bumbled by anyone who counted the commandments, meaning that this is their number. However they were greatly confused in the mention of the things to be counted, as will be explained in this essay. And that is because they were not aware of the content of [all] these fourteen principles:",
                "<b>The first of these principles</b> is that it is inappropriate to count rabbinic commandments in this category.",
                "<b>The second principle</b> is that it is inappropriate to count anything that we learn from the thirteen hermeneutic principles through which the Torah is expounded or from a (formal technical) inclusion.",
                "<b>The third principle</b> is that it is inappropriate to count commandments that are not practiced for [all] generations.",
                "<b>The fourth principle</b> is that it is inappropriate to count commands that include the whole Torah.",
                "<b>The fifth principle</b> is that it is inappropriate to count the reason for a commandment as a commandment on its own.",
                "<b>The sixth principle</b> is that it is appropriate with a commandment that includes [both] a positive commandment and a negative commandment, to count the positive commandment in it with the positive commandments and the negative commandment in it with the negative commandments.",
                "<b>The seventh principle</b> is that it is inappropriate to count the details of the laws of the Torah.",
                "<b>The eighth principle</b> is that it is inappropriate to count the negation of a positive commandment with the negative commandments.",
                "<b>The ninth principle</b> is that it is inappropriate to count the [statements] of the negative commandments and the positive commandments, but rather the items prohibited by them or commanded by them.",
                "<b>The tenth principle</b> is that it is inappropriate to count preliminaries that are for one of various purposes.",
                "<b>The eleventh principle</b> is that it is inappropriate to count each of the parts of a commandment on its own, when their combination is one commandment.",
                "<b>The twelfth principle</b> is that it is inappropriate to count parts of work, that are required by a command, on their own.",
                "<b>The thirteenth principle</b> is that the count of commandments not be increased according to the number of days that one is obligated in that commandment.",
                "<b>The fourteenth principle</b> is that it is inappropriate to count the enactment of fences [punishments] among the positive commandments. "

                "That it is inappropriate to count rabbinic commandments in this category:",
                "You should know that it is not [truly] appropriate to bring up this topic to explain it. For since the words of the Talmud (Makkot 23b) are, \"There were 613 commandments stated to Moshe at Sinai,\" how can we say about something rabbinic, that it is included in the count. However we have been prompted to it because many erred and counted the Chanukah light and the reading of the Megillah (Scroll of Esther) among the positive commandments. And likewise the hundred blessings each day; comforting the mourners; visiting the sick; burying the dead, clothing the naked; calculating the seasons; and the eighteen days in which we complete [the recitation of] Hallel. You can only stare at someone who hears [the Talmud's] statement, \"stated to Moshe at Sinai,\" and yet counts the recitation of Hallel in which David, peace be upon him, praised God, may He be blessed - that Moshe was commanded about it; or the Chanukah light which the Sages established during the Second Temple; or the reading of the Megillah. I cannot see anyone imagine - or it even coming to his mind - that it was nevertheless stated to Moshe at Sinai that he should command us that when, at the end of our monarchy, such and such happens to us with the Greeks, we will be obligated regarding the Chanukah light. And it appears to me that what led them to this is that we make the blessing [on these commandments], \"who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us\"; and the Talmud's question (Shabbat 23a) - \"And where we commanded?\" And they said, \"From 'you shall not veer'\" (Deuteronomy 17:11). But if they counted them from this, they should count everything rabbinic: For everything that the Sages commanded us to do and everything they prohibited to us [would then have] already commanded by Moshe, peace be upon him, at Sinai when he commanded us to do so. And that is his saying  (Deuteronomy 17:11), \"According to the law that they instruct you, etc.\" And he prohibited us from violating anything that [the rabbis] ordained or decreed, by saying, \"you shall not veer.\" But if one counts everything rabbinic within the 613 commandments because it all fits  into His, may He be blessed, saying \"you shall not veer\" - why would he count these in particular and not count others besides them? And just like they counted the Chanukah light and the reading of the Megillah, they should also have counted the washing of the hands and the commandment of <i>eruv</i>. For [we also] recite the blessing, \"who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us,\" [on these] - just like we recite the blessings on the reading of the Megillah and the Chanukah light. Yet it is all rabbinic! And in explantion, [the Sages] said (Chullin 106a), \"[Washing hands]  is a commandment.\" And they said, \"What is the commandment? Abbaye said, 'It is a commandment to listen to the words of the sages.'\" This is like what they said about the reading of the Megillah and the Chanukah light, \"And where were we commanded? From 'you shall not veer.'\" And it is already clear that anything that the Sages and the prophets that arose after our teacher, Moshe ordained is also rabbinic. And in explanation, they said (Eruvin 21b), \"At the time that Shlomo ordained [the ordinances of] <i>eruv</i> and of washing hands, a heavenly voice emerged and said (Proverbs 27:11), 'My son, be wise and make My heart glad.'\" And they explained in other places that <i>eruv</i> is called rabbinic and washing hands is from the words of the Scribes. Behold that it is clear that everything that they decreed after Moshe is rabbinic. Indeed I am explaining all of this to you so that you not think that since the reading of the Megillah is an ordinance of the prophets, it is considered to be from the Torah. As <i>eruv</i> is rabbinic even though it was ordained by Shlomo and his court. And this was missed by someone besides us - so that they counted clothing the naked, because it is found in Isaiah 58:7, \"when you see the naked, you should clothe him.\" And he did not know that it is included in His, may He be blessed, saying (Deuteronomy 15:8), \"enough for his lack that he is lacking.\" For the content of this command is without a doubt that we feed the hungry, cover the naked, give bedding to one without bedding, give clothing to one without clothing, marry off a single man who does not have the wherewithal to get married and to give a horse to ride upon to one who is habituated to it [but can no longer afford it], as is made famous in the Talmud (Ketubot 67b). For this is all included in His saying, \"he is lacking.\" And the words of the Talmud for them were attached 'to a stammering jargon and an alien tongue.' For otherwise, they would not have counted the reading of the Megillah and that which is similar to it with the commandments that were stated to Moshe on Mount Sinai. And it is stated in the Gemara in Shevuot (Shevuot 39a:10), \"And I have only the commandments that were commanded at Mount Sinai. From where do I have commandments that were to be initiated in the future, such as the reading of the Megillah? The verse (Esther 9:27) states, 'they fulfilled and accepted' - they fulfilled what they [already] accepted.\" And that is that they would believe all of the commandments that the prophets and sages ordained afterwards. But it is a wonder: Why did they count positive rabbinic commandments, as we mentioned, and not also mention negative rabbinic commandments. And just like they counted reading the Megillah, the Chanukah light, the one hundred blessings each day and Hallel among the positive commandments, they should have also counted each and every rabbinic secondary sexual prohibition as a negative Torah commandment! It is as [the Sages] explained it and said (Yevamot 20a), \"The secondary sexual prohibitions are from the words of the Scribes.\" And it has already been explained in the Talmud about the statement of the Mishnah, \"the prohibition of a commandment\" - referring to secondary sexual prohibitions - saying, \"What is the commandment? To listen to the words of the sages.\" And it should have been lookwise appropriate for them to include the sister of the levirate wife, which is from the words of the Scribes. More generally, if we were to count every positive rabbinic law and every negative rabbinic law, it would add up to many thousands. And that is something clear. But the principle is that anything rabbinic is not counted in the category of the 613 commandments. For this category is completely [comprised of] that which is written in the Torah, such that there is nothing rabbinic in it - as we are explaining. However their counting some things that are rabbinic and leaving out others - according to their choice - is an unacceptable notion, no matter what they say! Behold we have explained this principle and its demonstrations such that there should be no doubt about it at all to anyone."

                "That it is inappropriate to count anything that we learn from the thirteen hermeneutic principles through which the Torah is expounded or from a (formal technical) inclusion.",
                "We have already explained in the introduction of our composition, in the Commentary on the Mishnah, that most laws of the Torah have come out from the thirteen hermeneutic principles through which the Torah is expounded; and that there is sometimes a disagreement about a law that comes out through one of these principles; but that there are also, among them, laws the explanation of which was received from Moshe about which there is no disagreement. Nevertheless, they bring proofs about them from one of these thirteen principles. For it is the brilliance of Scripture that it is possible to find a hint or a verbal analogy in it, that indicates the received explanation - and we have already explained this topic there. And since the matter is such, behold: We can not say about every matter that the Sages brought out by a principle from the thirteen principles, that it was stated to Moshe at Sinai; and likewise can we not say about everything found in the Talmud in which they [only] supported it with one of the thirteen principles that it is rabbinic. For sometimes it will [nevertheless] be the received explanation from Moshe at Sinai. What is appropriate here regarding anything that is not found written in the Torah, but it is found that it is something they learned in the Talmud through one of the thirteen principles - if they themselves explain and say that it is a part of the Torah and that it is [a law] from the Torah, it is surely appropriate to count it. For those through which it is received said it is from the Torah. But if they did not explain this and did not say this, it is rabbinic - for there is no verse here indicating it. And this is also a principle that someone besides us has already been confused about; and therefore he counted fear of the sages as a positive commandment. And that which appears to have brought him to this is the statement of Rabbi Akiva (Pesachim 22b), \"'You shall fear <i>et</i> the Lord, your God' (Deuteronomy 6:13) - to include Torah scholars.\" So he thought that anything that is arrived at through the thirteen principles is in the category [of the 613 commandments]. But if the matter was as he thought it, why did he not count honoring a mother's husband or a father's wife; and likewise not count honoring an older brother? For we learned that we are obligated to honor these individuals by inclusions. They said (Ketubot 103a), \"'You shall honor <i>et</i> your father' - to include your older brother and your mother's husband; 'and <i>et</i> your mother' - to include your father's wife.\" That is just like they said, \"'You shall fear <i>et</i> the Lord, your God' - to include Torah scholars.\" If so, why did they count these and not those? But they have come to even greater foolishness than that in this matter. And that is when they found a teaching about a verse, in which the teaching obligates an action or the distancing from something - but they are rabbinic without a doubt - they counted them among the commandments, even though the simple meaning of the verse does not indicate any of these things at all. This is in spite of the principle that [the Sages], peace be upon them, taught us about it - a verse may not be taken out of its simple meaning. So the Talmud asks everywhere where a verse is found from which we learn many things by way of explanation and proof, \"What was the simple understanding of the verse written about?\" But those who relied on this [mistaken] thinking counted visiting the sick, comforting the mourners and burying the dead in the category of the commandments, because of the teaching that is found about His, may He be blessed, saying, \"and make known to them the way in which they are to go and the practices that they must do\" (Exodus 18:20). And [the Sages] said about this (Bava Kamma 100a), \"'The way' - that is acts of kindness. 'They are to go' - that is visiting the sick. 'In which' - that is burial of the dead. 'The practices' - that is the laws. 'That they must do' - that is [conducting oneself] beyond the letter of the law.\" And [the ones mistaken about what can be counted] thought that each and every one of these actions was a separate commandment. And they did not know that all of these actions - and those that are similar to them - fall under one commandment written in the Torah, when it is explained. And that is His, may He be blessed, saying, \"and you shall love your neighbor like yourself\" (Leviticus 19:18). And in this exact same way, they counted the calculation of the seasons as a commandment because of the teaching from, \"it is your wisdom and your understanding\" (Deuteronomy 4:6). And that is their saying (Shabbat 75a), \"Which is the wisdom and understanding that is in the eyes of the nations? You shall say, it is the calculation of the seasons and the constellations.\" And [even] if one would [only] count what is clearer than this and what is more appropriate to count - that being, to count everything that we learn in the Torah from the thirteen hermeneutic principles through which the Torah is expounded - the count of commandments would add up to many thousands. And if you might think that I am running from counting them because they are not true; whether the law that comes out of it is true or not - that is not the reason. Rather the reason is that any extension that a person, and even if it was Moshe himself, draws out from the root principles that were told to Moshe at Sinai with their explanation - and these are the 613 commandments - is not appropriate to count. And the proof of this all is their saying in the Gemara, Temurah (Temurah 16a), \"One thousand and seven hundred a fortiori inferences, verbal analogies, and precise inferences of the Scribes were forgotten during the days of mourning for Moshe. Even so, Otniel, son of Kenaz, restored them through his sharpness, as it is stated (Joshua 15:16-17), '\"To he who smites Kiryat Sefer, and takes it, etc.\" And Otniel, son of Kenaz took it.'\" And if this was what was forgotten, what was the total from which this amount was forgotten?! For it would certainly be false to say that everything that was known was forgotten. So, without a doubt, those laws that were drawn out by a fortiori inferences and the other principles were many thousands - and they were all known at the time of Moshe. And yet they are called precise inferences of the Scribes, because anything that they did not hear explained at Sinai is certainly from the words of the Scribes. Behold it has now been shown that that which was learned out through the thirteen principles even during Moshe's time, peace be upon him, is not to be counted among the 613 commandments that were stated to him at Sinai. Hence all the more so should that which was derived in later times not be counted among them. However it is nevertheless true that what was an explanation received from him is counted. And that is what the transmitters explain, and say that this thing is something forbidden to do and its prohibition is from the Torah; or they say that it is a part of the Torah. Behold that we count this, since it is known from tradition and not through a verbal analogy. Indeed, their [possible] mention of a verbal analogy and their bringing a proof for it from one of the thirteen principles [in such a case] is only to show the brilliance of Scripture, as we explained in the Commentary on the Mishnah."

                "That it is inappropriate to count commandments that are not practiced for [all] generations. ",
                "You should know that that which they said (Makkot 23b), \"613 commandments were stated to Moshe at Sinai,\" indicates that this is the number of the commandments that are practiced for [all] generations. For commandments that are not practiced for [all] generations do not have a connection to Sinai - whether they were stated at Sinai or elsewhere. However their intention in saying, \"at Sinai,\" was that the main giving of the Torah was at Sinai. And that was His, may He be elevated, saying, \"Come up to Me on the mountain and be there, and I will give [it] to you\" (Exodus 24:12). And in explanation, they said, \"What is the verse [that alludes to this]? 'Moshe commanded us the Torah, an inheritance of the congregation of Yaakov' (Deuteronomy 33:4)\" - meaning to say - \"the numerical value of [the word,] Torah is 611. In addition, 'I am the Lord your God' and 'You shall have no other gods' (Exodus 20:2, 3), that we heard from the mouth of the Almighty.\" And with them, the total of the commandments is 613. They wanted to say with this indication that the thing that Moshe commanded us - and that we did not hear from anyone but him - was the number of 611 commandments. And he called it, \"an inheritance of the congregation of Yaakov.\" And a commandment that is not practiced for [all] the generations is not an inheritance for us. For it is indeed only that which will be continuous for the generations - as it is stated (Deuteronomy 11:21), \"like the days of the heavens upon the earth\" - that will be called an inheritance for us. And likewise, their statement (Tanchuma, Ki Tetzeh), that it is as if each and every limb commands a person to do a commandment; and it is as if each and every day is warning a person from sin. This is a proof that the number will never be lacking. But if commandments that are not practiced for [all] generations were included in the count of the commandments, behold that the number would be lacking once the obligation of such a commandment ceased. And then this statement would only be correct for a limited time. However someone besides us already erred in this principle as well and counted - because he was forced by a need - \"But let them not go inside and witness the dismantling of the sanctuary\" (Numbers 4:20); and \"he shall serve no more\" (Numbers 8:25), concerning the Levites. Yet these were also only practiced in the wilderness. And even though they said (Sanhedrin 81b:18), \"From where is there a hint about one who steals a jar for the Temple service (that he is killed)? 'But let them not go inside and witness the dismantling of the sanctuary'\" - there is enough [clarification here] in their saying, \"a hint.\" But the simple understanding of the verse is not like this; and it is not even included in those liable for the death penalty at the hands of the Heavens - as is explained in the Tosefta (Tosefta Keritot 1) and in Sanhedrin (Sanhedrin 83a). And I am wondering about this, why they mentioned these negative commandments. Why did they not [also] count about the manna, \"Let no one leave any of it over until morning\" (Exodus 16:19); or that which He, may He blessed said, \"Do not harass the Moabites or provoke them to war\" (Deuteronomy 2:9), and likewise the prohibition that came about the the Children of Ammon, \"do not harass them or start a fight with them\" (Deuteronomy 2:19). And likewise should he count among the positive commandments, \"Make a seraph figure and mount it on a standard\" (Numbers 21:8); and its saying, \"Take a jar and put one omer of manna in it\" (Exodus 16:33) - like he counted the tithe of the [booty] (Numbers 31) and the dedication of the altar (Numbers 7). And he should have also counted, \"Be ready for the third day\" (Exodus 19:15); \"neither shall the flocks and the herds graze\" (Exodus 34:3); \"they shall not destroy, to come up\" (Exodus 19:24); and many like these. And no intelligent person will doubt that all of these commandments were given to Moshe at Sinai as commands and [prohibitions; however they were all temporary and not practiced for [all] generations. And therefore they were not counted. And because of this principle, it is inappropriate to count the blessings and the curses that they were commanded at Gerizim and Eval; nor to count the building of the altar that we were commanded to build when we entered the Land of Canaan - for all of these were temporary commandments. And likewise, not the command that we were commanded to sacrifice any animal, from which we want to eat, as peace-offerings - as this was only a temporary command. And that was its saying, \"and you shall bring them to the Lord\" (Leviticus 7:8).\" And they said in Sifrei, Achrei Mot, \"'And you shall bring them' is a positive commandment\" - but it was only so in the wilderness. For the dispensation to eat meat for pleasure is explained in [Deuteronomy]; and that is its saying, \"you may eat meat whenever you wish\" (Deuteronomy 12:20). And had it been appropriate to count everything of this type - meaning all that Moshe was commanded from the day he was appointed to be a prophet until the day he died - there would be more than three hundred commandments, besides the commandments that are practiced for [all] generations. This is when we count all the commands that came in Egypt, everything about the preparations [for the tabernacle service], and the other ones besides them - some are positive commandments and some are negative commandments, but they are all written in the Torah. And since he did not count all of them, he is perforce also obligated not to count any of them; and not like this other man, who took [only] some of these things to help him, when he toiled to find the [right] tally. And this is the critique we wanted to make about him regarding this principle."

It is as if it says, \"Do everything I have commanded you to do and be careful about anything from which I have prohibited you\"; or \"Do not transgress anything of what I have commanded you about.\" And there is no room to  count this command on its own - as it does not command us to do a specific act, such that it should be a positive commandment; nor does it warn us from doing a specific act, such that it should be a negative commandment. And this is like its saying, \"Be on guard concerning all that I have told you\" (Exodus 23:13); and what is stated, \"And you shall keep my statutes\" (Leviticus 19:19); \"And you shall keep my judgements\" (Leviticus 18:4); \"and you shall keep My covenant\" (Exodus 19:5); \"And you shall keep My charge\" (Leviticus 18:30), and many like these. And [others] have already erred in this principle, such that they counted, \"You shall be holy\" (Leviticus 19:2), to be included among the positive commandments. And they did not know that \"You shall be holy,\" and \"you shall sanctify yourselves and be holy\" (Leviticus 11:44) are commands to keep the whole Torah. It is as if it said, \"Be holy by doing everything I have commanded you and being careful about anything I have prohibited to you.\" And the words of the Sifra (Sifra, Kedoshim, Section 1:1) are, \"'You shall be holy' - you shall be separated - meaning to say, separate from all the disgraceful things that I have prohibited to you.\" And in the Mekhilta (Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 22:30:1), \"Issi ben Yehudah says, 'When the Holy One, Blessed be He, originates a commandment for Israel, He adds holiness to them'\" - meaning to say this command is not a command in itself, but rather follows from the commands that they have been commanded. So one who fulfills this command will be called, holy. And there is no difference between it saying, \"You shall be holy,\" or if it had said, \"Do my commandments.\" Would you see that that which is being said [here] is a positive commandment, in addition to the commandments that it is referring back to, that we have been commanded? Likewise should we not say that \"You shall be holy,\" and that which is similar to it, is a commandment - for it has not commanded us to do anything besides what we [already] know. And the words of the Sifrei (Sifrei Bamidbar 115:1): \"'You shall be holy' - that is the holiness of the commandments.' Hence behold what we have been working around is clear. And also based on this principle is its saying, \"Cut away the thickening about your hearts\" (Deuteronomy 10:16) - meaning to say, that one accept and obey all of the commandments already mentioned. And so too, \"and stiffen your necks no more\" (Deuteronomy 10:16) - meaning to say, do not harden your heart and accept that which I commanded you, and do not transgress it."

And this is like its stating, \"Then the first husband who sent her away shall not take her to wife again [...] you must not bring sin upon the land\" (Deuteronomy 24:4): Its stating, \"you must not bring sin upon the land,\" is the reason for the prohibition that preceded it. It is as if it is saying that if you do this, you will cause great loss to the land. An it is [also] like its stating, \"Do not profane your daughter and make her a harlot, lest the land fall into harlotry\" (Leviticus 19:29). For its stating, \"lest the land fall into harlotry,\" is the reason. It as if it said that the reason of this prohibition is so that \"the land not fall into harlotry.\" And so too, its stating, \"you shall not make yourselves unclean therewith and become unclean with them\" (Leviticus 11:43): After mentioning the prohibition of the various species that are forbidden to eat, it gave a reason for this and said, \"you shall not make yourselves unclean\" by eating them. It is as if it is saying that which caused this to be prohibited is the making of oneself impure. And to explain that which He, may He be blessed, said after He prefaced not taking ransom from a murderer, \"You shall not defile the land\" (Numbers 35:34) - they said in the Sifrei (Sifrei Bamidbar 160:13), \"The verse is telling us that spilling blood defiles the land.\" Hence behold it is clear that this negative statement is the reason for the previous negative commandment, not something else.  And likewise regarding that which is stated, \"He shall not go outside the sanctuary and not profane\" (Leviticus 21:12) - if he does go outside, he profanes.

And likewise the fast of Yom Kippur is a positive commandment, but eating upon it is a negative commandment.

                "You should know that a commandment is a received legal construct, and that many commands and prohibitions flow out from its base - and those are the laws of the commandment. An example of this is levirate marriage (<i>yibum</i>) and <i>chalitsah</i>, which are two positive commandments. About this, there is no argument. But when we observe the laws of these commandments, what flows out from these Torah bases is that some women are obligated to do <i>chalitsah</i> and may not do levirate marriage; some of them must do levirate marriage and may not do <i>chalitsah</i>; some may do either <i>chalitsah</i> or levirate marriage; and some may not do <i>chalitsah</i> or levirate marriage. And likewise with men - that is to say the ones [theoretically obligated] to initiate the levirate marriage - some must do <i>chalitsah</i> and may not do levirate marriage; some must do levirate marriage and may not do <i>chalitsah</i>; some may do <i>chalitsah</i> or levirate marriage; and some may not do <i>chalitsah</i> or levirate marriage. And likewise are there found some women subject to levirate marriage that do <i>chalitsah</i> with one and do levirate marriage with another; and some that do <i>chalitsah</i> with the one and the other (added by Ibn Tibbon: and some that do levirate marriage with the one and the other). And there are some that are permissible to their husbands but forbidden to their levirate husbands; some who are permissible to their levirate husbands but are forbidden to their husbands; some who are forbidden to both; and some who are permissible to both. And if we were to count each one of these details of the commandment as a commandment on its own, the count of commandments only from Tractate Yevamot would add up to more than a hundred commandments. As they would all be either a commandment or a prohibition, such that one would say that this one is obligated to do <i>chalitsah</i> in the way we would describe. Or one would say, that this one is not permissible to that one; or that <i>chalitsah</i> is completely impossible for her, or levirate marriage. And such would be the way with each and every commandment. ",
                "But since this is so, and there is no disagreement about it, it is not appropriate to count the details of the commandments even when they are written in the Torah. For it is not just because Scripture explained and detailed a commandment or the conditions for it that we should count each condition or component - which is a detail - and say that it is commandment. And many have already erred in this and counted everything that they found written [in the Torah] without observation [as to what is] the root of the commandment and [what are] its details or its conditions. An example of this is that in the book of Leviticus, Scripture obligates someone who defiles the sanctuary or its holy objects that are mentioned with it, to bring a sacrifice of a sin-offering. And that is a positive commandment without a doubt. And afterwards, Scripture details what this sacrifice will be and says, a female sheep or a female goat; and if he cannot afford its cost, he brings two turtledoves or two young pigeons; and if he cannot afford their cost, he brings a tenth of an ephah of fine flour - this is a variable burnt-offering. But this is truthfully an explanation of the sacrifice that he is obligated. Hence it is inappropriate to count it as three commandments, and to say that the command is that he was commanded to bring a tenth of an ephah. For they are surely not three commands but rather one; and that is that he bring a sacrifice for his mistake, and that this sacrifice should be like this - or like that, if [the first] is impossible. And also of this type is making a mistake about a commandment. And this is what Scripture has in the book of Leviticus, that one who made a mistake and transgressed one of God's commandments bring a sacrifice. And it is a positive commandment that the one who made a mistake bring a sin-offering, on condition that the mistake be about something that volitional sin would obligate excision as a result of an act [that violates] a negative commandment - as is explained in the chapters of Horayot and Keritot. Afterwards, Scripture details the description of this sacrifice, and then Scripture writes about it and says that if the errant one was from the people of the land, he brings a female sheep or a female goat; if he was a chieftain, he brings a male goat; if he was a high priest, he brings a bull; and if the mistake was with idolatry, he brings a female goat - whether he is a chieftain, a commoner or a high priest. And it is not because of the variation in the type of animal that he sacrifices, that the one sacrifice increases and becomes many commandments. For were it to be like this, we would have also been obligated to count that which it says, a female sheep or a female goat, as two commandments; and its saying two turtledoves or two young pigeons as two commandments. But the matter is not like this. The command of the sacrifice is the positive commandment - whatever [specific] sacrifice one brings - whereas not every condition of the commandment is counted as a commandment. And understand this very well, for the mistake in it is subtle and only someone with understanding will be aware of it.",
                "And also of this type is His, may He be exalted, saying that a betrothed maiden that is promiscuous is [killed] by stoning; but [if she is] the daughter of a priest, by burning - which are the filling out of the details of the law of [adultery with] a married woman.  And everyone, who I have heard of already, erred in this - counting a married woman as a commandment, a betrothed maiden as [another] commandment and the daughter of a priest as [yet another] commandment, when the matter is not like this. Rather it is as I shall explain. And that is that His, may He be exalted, saying, \"you shall not commit adultery\" (Exodus 20:13), is a commandment from the tally of the commandments - and the tradition came that this negative commandment is the prohibition of the married woman. Afterwards, Scripture explained that one who violates this negative commandment is killed; and that is its saying, \"they shall surely be killed, the adulterer and the adulteress\" (Leviticus 20:10). Afterwards, Scripture filled in this detail and the conditions of this issue and judgement. So it stipulated conditions and said that that which is stated - \"they shall surely be killed, the adulterer and the adulteress\" - has distinctions: If she was a married woman that was the daughter of a priest, she is burned; if she was a betrothed virgin maiden, she is stoned; and if she was married but was not the daughter of a priest, she is strangled. But it is not that the stipulations of the laws of [its] death penalty expand it into several commandments; for we have not exited the prohibition of the married woman in all of this. And in Sanhedrin (Sanhedrin 51b:10), they said in explanation, \"All were included in 'the adulterer and the adulteress': [Then] the verse singled out the daughter of an Israelite for stoning and the daughter of a priest for burning.\" With this, they meant that regarding the prohibition of a married woman, all are included in that which Scripture said about them, \"they shall surely be killed, the adulterer and the adulteress\" - however Scripture differentiated about this death, and had some people to be burned and some of them to be stoned. And were it appropriate to count the detail of a commandment when it is written in the Torah, we would have been required to not list one who kills a soul by mistake being exiled as a single commandment, since Scripture has already detailed this commandment (Numbers 35:16-28). So we would have also counted the statement of Scripture, \"But if he strikes him with a metal instrument,\" as one commandment. And the second commandment would have been its saying, \"And if he struck him with a stone tool.\" And the third commandment would have been, \"Or struck him with a wooden instrument.\" And the fourth commandment would have been its saying, \"The blood-avenger shall put the killer to death.\" And the fifth would have been its saying, \"Or if he pushed him with hatred.\" And the sixth would have been its saying, \"or hurled something at him on purpose.\" And the seventh would have been its saying, \"Or if he struck him with his hand in enmity.\" And the eighth would have been its saying, \"But if suddenly without enmity.\" And the ninth would have been its saying, \"or hurled any object at him unintentionally.\" And the tenth would have been, \"Or  any deadly object of stone without seeing.\" The eleventh would have been, \"and he dropped it upon him and he died, though he was not an enemy of his.\" The twelfth would have been, \"And the congregation shall protect the killer.\" The thirteenth would have been, \"and the congregation shall bring him back to his city of refuge.\" The fourteenth would have been, \"and there he shall remain until the death of the high priest.\" The fifteenth would have been, \"But if the killer surely goes outside.\" The sixteenth would have been, \"and after the death of the high priest, the killer may return.\" And had we done this with each and every commandment, the number of commandments would have added up to more than two thousand. And the damage [of doing so] is clear, since they are all details of the topic. But the commandment that is counted is the law of one who kills a soul by mistake, and that is the law about which we have been instructed to evaluate the laws and details that are written about it. And likewise did God call them, regulations; and He did not call them, commandments - but said (Numbers 35:24), \"And the congregation shall judge between the killer and the blood-avenger according to these regulations.\"",
                "And the author of the Halakhot Gedolot was already aware of some of these matters and went around them by counting sections (as a whole and not each part of them). And in counting them, he [called them], the section of inheritances, the section of vows and oaths, the section of putting out a bad name. And he counted many sections like this. However he was not completely clear about this topic and did not arrive at it [fully]. And hence he counted in these sections that which had already been counted earlier, without sensing it. And since this principle escaped those besides us concerning the commandment of <i>tsaraat</i>, he counted it as twelve commandments and did not know that they are [actually just] one commandment; and that everything mentioned by Scripture is actually a detail or a condition. And the explanation of this is that He instructed us that <i>tsaraat</i> of a person makes one impure; and his impurity is such that he is obligated regarding that which impure people are obligated regarding distancing from the Sanctuary and its holy things, and to go outside of the camp of the Divine Presence. But we would not [yet] know which <i>tsaraat</i> renders impure and which does not render impure. So Scripture came to explain it and differentiate the regulations, such that if he was like this, he would be pure, but if he was like that he would be impure; if he was like this, he would have to stand so much time like this, but if he was like that, he would have to stand [a different amount of] time. And in explanation, they said (Sifra, Tazria Parashat Nega'im, Chapter 16:13), \"'To declare it pure or to declare it impure' (Leviticus 13:59) - just as it is a commandment to declare it pure, so it is a commandment to declare it impure.\" So the commandment is in fact for [a priest] to say, impure or pure. However it is inappropriate to count the differentiations of the their content - such that some are impure and some are pure - since they are its conditions and details. And this is like our saying that sacrificing animals with defects is forbidden to us. But if [we understand that] it is a negative commandment, it remains for us to know what the defects are. Could you see us calculating each and every defect as a commandment? If this were the case, its count would be close to seventy defects. But just like we do not count the defects - which of them are [an actual] defect and which of them are not [an actual] defect - but rather the prohibition is that we have been prohibited from an animal with a defect; so too is not fitting to count all of the signs of <i>tsaraat</i> - which of them are impure and which of them are pure - but rather only that the person with <i>tsaraat</i> is impure. And all of the rest is an explanation of what <i>tsaraat</i> is. And in this way, it it appropriate to count each and every type of impurity as one commandment [each]; and not count all the details of that type of impurity and its conditions, as will be explained. And understand this principle, as it is a pillar of the teaching in which we are [involved]. "

                "That it is inappropriate to count the negation of a positive commandment with the negative commandments.",
                "You should know that a prohibition is one of the two divisions of commands. For you can command a subject to do a certain thing or that he not do it. As you would command him to eat, and you would say to him, \"Eat\"; or you would command him to distance himself from that eating and say to him, \"Don't eat.\" But in the Arabic language, there is no noun that includes both of these matters together. And scholars (mutakallimun) of grammar theory have already noted this, and they said as follows: Indeed there is no noun in the Arabic language that brings together both the command and the prohibition, such that they have been required to refer to both (when they want to refer to both together) by one word - and that is, \"command.\" Behold that it is hence already clear to you that a prohibition is a type of command. However the famous word in Arabic used for a prohibition is the word, \"<i>lah</i> (no).\" And this [overall] content is found without a doubt in every language - meaning to say, that you are commanding a subject to do something or not to do it. If so, it is clear that both positive and negative commandments are full-fledged commands - things that He commanded us to do; and things that He prohibited us from doing. And the name for the command that is to be done is a positive commandment; and the name for that from which we are prohibited is a negative commandment. And the noun that includes both of them together in the Hebrew language is <i>gezerah</i>. And likewise the Sages call all of the commandments - whether positive or negative - <i>gezerat</i> (decree) of the King. ",
                "However negation of the positive is a different matter. And that is that you negate the predicate from the subject. As when you say, \"X did not eat yesterday; y did not drink today; Reuven is not Shimon's father\" - and that which is similar to this - it has nothing to do with the notion of a commandment at all. Behold this is all negation of the positive, and there is no trace of a command in it. And the word with which to negate in Arabic is generally <i>mah</i>, but they also negate with the word, <i>lah</i>. But the Hebrews generally negate with the word, <i>lo</i>, which is exactly the same word they use to prohibit. However they also negate with <i>ayin</i> and that which is connected to it, such as <i>eino</i>, <i>einam</i>, <i>einchem</i> and the other ones. Indeed negation in Hebrew is with the word <i>lo</i>, as when it states, \"<i>Lo</i> arose another prophet like Moshe\" (Deuteronomy 34:10); \"<i>Lo</i> a man is God that He should be untrue\" (Numbers 23:19); and many like these. And negation with <i>ayin</i> is like its saying, \"and man was <i>ayin</i>\" (Genesis 2:5); \"but the dead <i>einam</i> know anything\" (Ecclesiastes 9:5); and many others. Hence behold that the difference between a prohibition and a negation is already clear to you - and that is that a prohibition is a type of command and will only come with the exact verb of a command. That means to say, just like the verb of a command will always be in the future, so too will [the verb of] a prohibition. It is not possible for a command to be in the past, and so too with a prohibition. And there is no room to group a command as a [type of] narrative sentence: For a narrative sentence requires a predicate and a subject; whereas a  command is a complete sentence (without an explicit subject) - as is explained in the books written about this.  And a prohibition is also not to be included with a narrative sentence. But a negation is not like this, for a negation can be a narrative sentence. And negation can be in the past, the future or the present. And this is all self-evident with some observation. And since this is so, it is inappropriate to include negative statements that are negations as negative commandments in any way. And this is a demonstrable matter - there is no need for affirmation of it, besides that which we mentioned about the understanding of the nature of words, so as to differentiate between a prohibition and a negation.",
                "But this was already missed by someone besides us to the point that he counted, \"she does not go out like the release of slaves\" (Exodus 21:7) - and he did not know that this was a negation and not a prohibition. And the explanation of this is as I will explain. And that is that since God already determined about someone who struck his [gentile] slave or maidservant - and at the time of the strike, caused him to lack one of his main limbs - that [the slave or maidservant] goes out to freedom, it would enter our minds that if the matter is like this with a gentile slave, all the more so would it be the case with a Jewish maidservant and that she would go out to freedom if she loses one of her main limbs. And He negates this conception from us, by His saying, \"she does not go out like the release of slaves\" - as if to say, there is no obligation for her to be sent out to freedom with the loss of her limbs. So this is the negation of a law about her, and not a prohibition. And the masters of the tradition also explained it like this: And they said in the Mekhilta (Mekhilta DeRabbi Shimon Bar Yochai 21:7), \"'She does not go out like the release of slaves' - she does not go out with the main limbs in the way that [gentile] slaves go out.\" Behold that it is hence already clear to you that it is the negation of another law, which He is negating from her - not that He prohibited anything to us. And there is no difference between His saying, \"she does not go out like the release of slaves,\" and His saying (Leviticus 13:36), \"the priest does not examine the yellow hair, he is impure\" - it is only a negation, not a prohibition. And that is that it is explaining to us that he does not require quarantine because of this indication (of impurity), and that there is no doubt about him - he is impure. And likewise is His saying (Leviticus 19:20), \"they are not put to death, since she has not been freed,\" a negation and not a prohibition. For He is saying that they are not liable for the death penalty, since [her] freedom is not complete. And it would be inappropriate to explain this as if it were stated, \"you shall not put them to death\" - such that it would go from a matter of negation to a matter of prohibition. For His saying, \"they are not put to death, since she has not been freed,\" is like His saying (Deuteronomy 22:26), \"the girl has no sin worthy of death\" - which negates the death penalty from her because of the rape. And likewise [here], He negated the liability of death from them because of [her] slavery - as if to say, they have no sin worthy of death. And likewise is His saying (Numbers 17:5), \"and not be like Korach and like his congregation,\" a negation. And the Sages clarified that it is a negation: They explained its content and said (Midrash Tanchuma, Tzav 13:1) that He, may He be exalted, was telling us that anyone who argues about and challenges the priesthood will not have what happened to Korach and his congregation happen to him with regards to being swallowing up or burned; but rather his punishment will truly be like that which the Lord said through Moshe - meaning to say, <i>tsaraat</i>. For He, may He be elevated, had said to him (Exodus 4:6), \"Put your hand into your bosom.\" And they brought a proof [for this] from what happened to King Uzziah of Judah (II Chronicles 26:19). And even though we find a different expression in the Gemara in Sanhedrin (Sanhedrin 110a) - and that is their saying, \"Anyone who maintains an argument, transgresses a negative commandment, as it is stated, 'and not be like Korach and like his congregation\" - this is by way of an <i>asmakhta</i> (homiletic support), and not that their intention in this is the simple meaning of the verse. However the prohibition about this is included in a different negative commandment, which I will explain in its place. ",
                "But there is nothing that will clarify the difference between a negation and a prohibition to you besides the content of the statement. Indeed it will surely not be clarified by the word, for the word for negation and prohibition are the same in Hebrew; and that is the word, <i>lo</i>. So one learned must understand the content of the statement. And then he will quickly grasp which negative statement is a negation and which negative statement is a prohibition, according to our preceding explanation. And [the Sages], peace be upon them, already alluded to this matter. And that is in that which we find disagreement about a certain negative statement, as to whether it is a negation or a prohibition. And that is His saying regarding a bird sin-offering (Leviticus 5:8), \"pinching its head at the nape, and he does not sever it.\" For behold our tanna - and that is the tanna that speaks in the mishnah (Zevachim 6:4) - holds that this is a prohibition; and therefore said that if he separated it, it is disqualified. And according to this, this negative statement would have to be a negative commandment. That is that if he severed it, it is disqualified - as if he brought leaven or honey [on the altar]. But Rabbi Elazar (ben Shimon) holds that this negative statement is a negation and not a prohibition; and that His saying, \"he does not sever it,\" is intending to say, one does not have to sever the head, but rather one can cut it in any way that it might be. And hence - according to his opinion - if one severed it, it is [still] fit. And accordingly, they said in the Gemara, Zevachim (Zevachim 65b), \"Rabbi Elazar ben Shimon would say, 'I have heard that we sever the bird sin-offering.' [Then] what is [the meaning of], 'he does not sever it?' He does not have to sever it.\" And they asked about this and said, \"But from this - concerning a pit, about which it is written (Exodus 21:33), \"and he does not cover it,\" is it also the same?\" And the answer was, \"There, it is written (Exodus 21:34), 'The one responsible for the pit must make restitution' - it is implied that he needs to cover it.\" Behold it has been clarified that they took a proof as to whether it is a negation or a prohibition from the content of the statement. And from it, it has become clear that His saying, \"he does not sever it,\" is a negative commandment - according to what is written in the mishnah. And it has [also] become clear that His saying with a bird burnt-offering (Leviticus 1:17), \"And he shall tear it open by its wings, he does not sever it,\" is inappropriate to count as a negative commandment - as it is a negation. And according to everyone, if he severs it, it is [still] fit. For it is because He said with an animal fire-offering (Leviticus 1:12), \"And you shall cut it up into sections,\" that it would enter your mind that a bird burnt-offering is also like this. So He said that you do not need to sever it, but just tear it. So if he severed it, it is [still] fit - as is explained in its place. ",
                "And also included in these negative statements that are negations is His saying (Leviticus 27:29), \"Any human being who has been proscribed is not ransomed.\" Indeed, once you know what the content of this statement is, it is clear to you that this is a negation and not a prohibition. And that is that Scripture here has already discussed the set values of appraisals according to the amount of years of the one appraised and whether they are male or female. And there is no difference whether one said, \"My appraisal is upon me\"; or \"the appraisal of x is upon me\" - as we see who this person is and how old he is, and he gives according to that. But if the one appraised was someone who was liable for a death penalty of the court and his judgment has been completed - and after that someone said, \"The appraisal of that one is upon me\" - he is not obligated to give anything, since that one is considered as if he is dead, for there is no value to him once his judgment has been completed. And this is the content He wanted [to express] by saying, \"is not ransomed\" - meaning to say, he has no value, such that the appraiser should give it. So this is one of the laws of appraisals and their regulations mentioned by Scripture, and not a prohibition. And the language of the mishnah (Arakhin 1:3) is, \"One who is moribund and one who is taken to be executed is not vowed about nor appraised.\" And the Talmud (Arakhin 6b) explains that this is on condition that he has come out of a Jewish court with a guilty verdict. And the words of the Mekhilta are, \"Those who are liable for the death penalty do not have redemption, as it is stated, 'Any human being who has been proscribed is not ransomed.'\" And reflect upon the language of the statement and be precise in your study of it - how they explained that this negative statement is a negation and not a prohibition, by their saying, \"do not have redemption\"; and they did not say, \"we may not redeem them.\" And they explained this very matter in the Sifra in the section about appraisals (Sifra, Bechukotai, Chapter 12:7) and said, \"From where is it derived that if one liable for the death penalty of the court said, 'My value is upon me,\" he has said nothing? We learn to say, 'is not redeemed.'\" That is to say [that the question was,] from where is it that [we know that] he is not liable [for any] value. And we have already explained this matter with complete clarity, such that no question is left about it, even for one whose intellect is the most dense among all people. And since we have spoken about this matter, you should know that the words that can connote a prohibition in the Torah are four. And anything that is prohibited by one of these four is called a negative commandment. And they are guard, lest, do not and no (<i>hishamer, pen, al, lo</i>). And in explanation, they said (Makkot 13b:5), \"Wherever it is stated, guard, lest, or do not, it is nothing other than a negative commandment.\" But there is one thing that remains for us to explain in order to complete the intent of the section. And that is that when the Torah tells and commands us to cleanse ourselves by negating actions x and y, behold that action is included in the negative commandments. And even though the negative statement through which it comes is a negation and not a prohibition - since it commands us to negate it from ourselves, and say, \"I have not done such and such,\" we perforce know that such and such an action is prohibited to us. And this is like when Scripture commands us to say, \"I have not eaten of it while in mourning, I have not cleared out any of it while I was unclean and I have not deposited any of it with the dead\" (Deuteronomy 26:14) - it is indicating that all of these actions are prohibited to us. And behold that this explanation will come in its place, when we speak about these commandments."

                "That it is inappropriate to count the [statements] of the negative commandments and the positive commandments, but rather the items prohibited by them or commanded by them.",
                "You should know that the commands of the Torah and its prohibitions are about four things: Beliefs, actions, traits and speech. And [beliefs] is that He commanded us to believe in the unity of the Lord, to love God and fear Him; and that He prohibited us from many beliefs, such as his prohibiting us from any divinity besides Him. And He also commanded us in certain actions, such as His commanding us to bring sacrifices and building the Temple; and prohibited us from certain actions, such as His prohibiting us from sacrificing to anyone besides Him, may He be blessed, or from bowing down to anything that is worshipped besides Him. And he also commanded us to act with a certain trait, like that which He commanded us about compassion, mercy, charity and kindness and His saying, \"you shall love your neighbor like yourself\" (Leviticus 19:18); and he prohibited us from acting with certain traits, like that which He prohibited us from hatred, vengeance, grudge-bearing, bloodlust and other bad traits, as I will explain. And He commanded us that we should say certain statements, like that which He commanded us to praise Him, to pray to Him, to confess our iniquities and our sins and that which is similar to this, as will be explained; and He prohibited us from certain speech, like that which He commanded and forbade us from swearing falsely, talebearing, evil speech, cursing and that which is similar to it. And once these matters that we have been commanded about, or prohibited from, have come to us - whether they be actions, speech, perspectives, or traits - we do not look at the amount of times we are commanded it, it if is a command; or that we are prohibited from it, if it is a prohibition. For they are all to strengthen it. As sometimes He comes back to the very same matter, with one prohibition after the other, to reinforce it. And likewise will one command come after the other to reinforce [a singular commandment]. This is unless you find some statement of the Sages to differentiate the matter, such that the commentators (meaning to say, the Sages of the Talmud) explain to you the positive commandment in it or the negative commandment in it that is not included in the [previous parallel] positive or negative commandment. For then, it would be appropriate to count it [as a separate commandment] without a doubt. As it would not still [just] be reinforcement, but rather additional content - even though what appears from Scripture is that it is about the same content. For we are only forced to say that a verse is repeated to reinforce it, and is not new content, if we do not come to a statement of the commentators - who are the receivers of its tradition - otherwise. However when we find that the tradition says that this command or this prohibition has such content and this command or prohibition that is repeated has different content, this [understanding] has priority and is better - such that the verse not be repeating, but rather [containing additional] content. And then it would be appropriate to count this one by itself and that one by itself. Nevertheless, when there is no new content there, you should know that it is only truly being repeated to reinforce it; and in order that it be known that this matter is a very great iniquity - given that one prohibition after another is coming about it; or to learn a law about the commandment; or to learn from it [one of the laws of another commandment. This is as it is explained in the Talmud, \"it is statement exported for a verbal analogy,\" or to learn from it] a parallel. And behold we saw that they, peace be upon them, alluded to this matter in the Gemara, in the second chapter of Pesachim (Pesachim 24a). And this is what they intended about one of the negative commandments that appeared to be repeated - since the prohibition [already] came from another [verse] - and they sought to establish it to be about about additional content. And it was said about it as a difficulty, \"Ravina said to Rav Ashi, 'And say that it comes to have one violate two negative commandments [for the same act]?'\" This is meaning to say, \"That which you want to establish this negative statement about a different matter than the matter that came as a result of the other negative statement - what is your need to toil about this; perhaps it was repeated about the exact same matter, in order that the person who does this matter be liable for two negative commandments?\" But the answer was, \"He said to him, 'Anywhere that it is possible to expound, we expound - and we do not establish the verse as containing an extra negative commandment [for the same act].'\" Behold it is has been clarified to you that any negative statement that is not coming for additional content is surely called, extra - that is to say that it is repeated. And even if they will say it comes to have one violate two negative commandments, behold it is nevertheless an extra negative commandment - as is clear from this statement. Hence it is inappropriate to count it. Behold, it is already clear that the commandments are not multiplied by the multiplicity of positive or negative statements [about the same content].",
                "It is already well-known that there is a command to cease work on Shabbat and that it was repeated twelve times in the Torah. Would you see someone who counts the commandments saying that they are included as commandments of resting on Shabbat, and that they are twelve commandments? And likewise does the prohibition of eating blood come seven times. Would any learned one also think to say that the prohibition of blood is seven commandments? And this is something that no one would err about - meaning that resting on Shabbat is [only] one of the positive commandments. And you should know that even when you find the expression of the Sages, that one who transgresses prohibition x has transgressed so many negative commandments or when he who negates matter y has negated so many positive commandments - it does not necessarily come out of this that you should count each one of those negative commandments or positive commandments individually; for it is the same content and there is no [true] multiplicity. Indeed, they [are saying] that he transgresses so many positive or negative commandments on account of the repetition of the command or the prohibition of that commandment; for he transgressed many [statements of the] prohibition. This is unless you find that they say, he is given two or three [sets of] lashes. For then, each one is counted individually. For one cannot be given two [sets of] lashes for one category (<i>shem</i>), as is clarified from that which is made known in the Talmud in Makkot (Makkot 16a) and Chullin (Chullin 82b) and other places. Indeed one receives two [sets of] lashes for two categories - meaning for two matters about which a prohibition comes for each one. And that is the difference between their saying, \"He transgresses for this and that,\" and their saying, \"He receives two [sets of] lashes,\" or \"three [sets of] lashes.\" And the proof to that which we are saying is their saying (Menachot 44a), \"Whoever does not have <i>tzitzit</i> (fringes) on his garment violates five positive commandments\" - since the language of the command is repeated five times (in Numbers 15:38-39 and Deuteronomy 22:12): The first is, \"let them attach to the <i>tzitzit</i> at each corner.\" The second is, \"make for themselves <i>tzitzit</i>.\" The third is, \"That shall be your <i>tzitzit</i>.\" The fourth is, \"You shall make tassels for yourself.\" And the fifth is, \"on the four corners of the garment with which you cover yourself.\" But we found a clear statement from them that <i>tzitzit</i> is [only] one commandment, as I will explain when I discuss it (Sefer HaMitzvot, Positive Commandments 14). And in this exact way do they say (Menachot 44a), \"Whoever does not don tefillin violates eight positive commandments\" - because of the repetition of the command about them, of the head and of the arm, eight times. And likewise their saying, \"Any priest who does not go up on the platform (to bless the congregation) violates thirteen positive commandments\" - because of the repetition of the command about it thirteen times. And none of those who count the commandments would be so foolish as to say that the blessing of the priests is thirteen commandments, that <i>tzitzit</i> is five commandments and that tefillin is eight commandments. And had it been so, it would have been appropriate for us to count abuse of a convert as three commandments, because of the repetition of the prohibition about it - on account of their saying in the Gemara in Bava Metzia (Bava Metzia 59b), \"One who abuses the convert transgresses three negative commandments and one who oppresses him transgresses three negative commandments.\" But they are only two commandments - do not abuse and do not oppress him - however their prohibition was repeated. And this is clear and there is no doubt about it. And in explanation, they said in the Gemara, \"For what reason are we warned in the Torah in thirty-six places with regard to a convert? It is due to the convert’s inclination being evil.\" Would it be possible for one to say that this is thirty-six commandments out of the 613 commandments? No one would be foolish enough to say it!",
                "Behold it is already been completely explained that it is inappropriate to count every negative or positive commandment that is found in the Torah, for it [may be] a repetition. Indeed it is appropriate to count [only] the content that we are commanded about or prohibited from. And it is impossible to have knowledge of a repeated negative or positive commandment that is coming to give additional content, without a teacher that instructs it. And [these teachers] are those that received the traditional explanation, peace be upon them. And do not err also because the prohibition is repeated with different words - like His, may He be exalted, saying (Leviticus 19:10), \"You shall not pick (<i>teollel</i>) your vineyard bare,\" once He also said (Deuteronomy 24:19), \"and overlook a sheaf in the field, do not turn back to get it,\" and He said (Deuteronomy 24:20), \"When you beat down the fruit of your olive trees, do not extract (<i>tefaer</i>) again.\" For these are not two negative commandments, but rather one prohibition about one matter - and that is that he not take that which he overlooked from the grain or the fruits when he gathers them. And He brought two examples about them - from grapes and from olives. And He called what is left of the grapes <i>ollelot</i>; and of the olives, \"<i>pe'erot</i>. And the understanding of <i>tefaer</i> is do not remove that which you have overlooked in some of your <i>pe'erot</i> - and those are the branches. (See the glosses on this book.) And to this principle, it is appropriate to attach that which I will [now] say. And that is that when I say that it is appropriate that they count the content about which we are commanded or from which we are prohibited, it is on condition that the content that we are prohibited is a separate negative commandment for each and every matter; or that the transmitters [present] a proof that separates one matter from another and that each of them requires [its own] prohibition. However when there is one negative commandment that includes many matters, only that negative commandment is counted, and not all of the content that is included in that negative commandment. And this is a general prohibition, for which we do not give lashes - as we will now explain. And that is that they said (Sanhedrin 63a) in explanation of His saying, \"You shall not eat upon the blood\" (Leviticus 19:26), \"From where [do we know] that one who eats from an animal before its soul departs is in [transgression of] a negative commandment? As it is stated, 'You shall not eat upon the blood.' Another matter: From where is it derived that one who eats the meat of an offering before the blood has been sprinkled [on the altar] is in [transgression of] a negative commandment? We learn to say,'You shall not eat upon the blood' - you shall not eat the meat when the blood is still in the bowl. Rabbi Dosa says, 'From where [do we know] that we  do not provide a meal for mourners of those executed by the court? We learn to say, \"You shall not eat upon the blood.\"' Rabbi Akiva says, 'From where  [do we know] that a Sanhedrin that killed a soul (i.e., that sentenced a person to death) may not taste anything that entire day? We learn to say, \"You shall not eat upon the blood.\"' Rabbi Yochanan says, 'From where [do we know] the prohibition against the behavior of a stubborn and rebellious son? We learn to say, \"You shall not eat upon the blood.\"'\" Behold that we are prohibited from all of these five things, but they they are all included under one negative commandment. And they also said (Berakhot 10b), \"From where  [do we know] that a person should not taste anything until he prays? We learn to say, 'You shall not eat upon the blood' - you may not eat before you pray for your blood.\" And in explanation, they said in the Gemara (Sanhedrin 63a), \"For all of [these specific prohibitions], he is not given lashes - as it is a general negative commandment.\" And they also explained that a general negative commandment is when two or three prohibitions come from one negative commandment. So it is inappropriate that they should count each and every prohibition it included as a separate negative commandment; but rather only the one negative commandment that includes all of them. And similar to this negative commandment - meaning, \"You shall not eat upon the blood,\" - is His saying, \"you shall not place a stumbling block before the blind\" (Leviticus 19:14). As it also includes many matters, as will be explained (Sefer HaMitzvot, Negative Commandments 299). And likewise, His saying, \"You must not carry a false rumor\" (Exodus 23:1) - behold, it too includes many matters, as will be explained (Sefer HaMitzvot, Negative Commandments 281). And this is one of the types of general negative commandments.",
                "The second type is when one negative commandment comes to forbid several matters that are connected to one another - and that is that He says, \"Do not do such and such.\" And this type is divided into two divisions. For included in it is that about which they said in the Talmud, that he is liable for lashes on each and every one of the connected matters. But [also] included in it is that about which they said that he is only liable once, since it is a general negative commandment. And those negative commandments about which they explained that one is liable for each and every one of them - they are the ones that we count each and every one as a separate commandment; whereas that about which they explained that one is only liable once for all of them is counted as a single commandment. This is according to that which we established in this principle - that under no circumstances is one given two [sets of] lashes for one negative commandment . So when, in the explanation, they made one liable for each and every connected matter - to give lashes for each and every one of them when they were all done at once, to give several [sets of] lashes - we perforce know that they are several categories; and that each one should be counted separately. And I will mention several examples from both divisions until the intended matter becomes totally clear. And that is His, may He be blessed, saying, about the lamb of the Pesach sacrifice, \"Do not eat any of it raw or boiled in any way with water\" (Exodus 12:9) - a negative commandment, which we count as one commandment. And we don't count, do not eat it raw, as one commandment; and do not eat it boiled, as another commandment. For He did not specify a separate negative commandment for each matter, to say \"Do not eat any of it raw; and not boiled in any way\" - but rather one negative commandment came to include both matters; and the one matter was appended to the other. And in the second chapter of Pesachim (Pesachim 41b), they said, \"Abbaye said, 'If he ate it raw, he is given two [sets of] lashes; raw and boiled, he is given three.\" And that is because he holds that we give [distinct sets of] lashes for general negative commandments. So when he ate it raw, he transgressed two negative commandments: One of them is, \"Do not eat any of it raw\"; and the second [set of] lashes is from the general principle - as He is saying, do not eat it when it is not roasted, and he has already eaten it when it is not roasted. And according to his opinion, when he eats it raw and boiled, he gets three [sets of lashes] - one because he ate it raw; the second because he ate it boiled; and the third because he ate it when it was not roasted. And over there, they said about this statement, \"But Rava said, 'One does not receive lashes for a general negative commandment.' Some say, at any rate, one [set of] lashes he does receive. And some say he does not receive even one [set of] lashes, as the negative commandment he transgressed is not specific to it, as is the negative commandment against muzzling.\" That means to say, like that which He, may be exalted, said (Deuteronomy 25:4), \"You shall not muzzle an ox while it is threshing\" - which is one negative commandment that prohibits one matter. However for this negative commandment, which prohibits two things - raw and boiled - we do not give lashes. And you already know that it was clarified in the Gemara (Sanhedrin 63a), that we do not give lashes for a general negative commandment. And hence the statement of Abbaye is rejected; and the truth is that he is given one [set of] lashes: Whether he ate any of it raw and boiled, [just] raw or [just] boiled, he is only given one [set of] lashes. And so we shall count His, may He be exalted, saying, \"Do not eat any of it raw or boiled,\" as one commandment. And there, it is also stated, \"Abbaye said, '[If a nazirite] ate a grape skin, he receives two [sets of lashes]; a grape pit, he receives two; a grape skin and a grape pit, he receives three. But Rava said, 'One does not receive lashes for a general negative commandment'\" - meaning to say, \"from anything that is obtained from the grapevine\" (Numbers 6:4), for which Abbaye thinks we give lashes. And they also said in the fifth chapter of Menachot (Menachot 58b), \"One who offers leaven and honey on the altar - Abbaye says, 'He receives lashes on account of leaven; he receives lashes on account of honey; he receives lashes on account of a mixture of leaven; and he receives lashes on account of a mixture of honey'\" - meaning to say that His saying (Leviticus 2:11), \"any,\" is including two things: That he not offer it by itself; and that he not offer a mixture of it, whatever the quantity [of what is mixed with it] may be. And this is all according to the principle of his approach - as he holds that we give [distinct sets of] lashes for general negative commandments. And it is stated there, \"But Rava said, 'One does not receive lashes for a general negative commandment.' Some say, at any rate, one [set of] lashes he does receive. And some say he does not receive even one set of lashes, as the negative commandment he transgressed is not specific to it, as is the negative commandment against muzzling.\"",
                "And after it has been explained that His saying, \"Do not eat any of it raw or boiled\" is [only] one commandment; and likewise all of the negative commandments that arise from the prohibition for the nazirite of all that comes out from the vine are one commandment, since they are all details, as is explained in the Gemara; and they likewise said that, \"any leaven and any honey,\" is one commandment - we should also count, \"No Ammonite or Moabite shall be admitted\" (Deuteronomy 23:4), as one commandment. And likewise, His saying, \"You shall not ill-treat any widow or orphan\" (Exodus 22:21). And likewise, His saying, \"You shall not subvert the rights of the stranger or the orphan\" (Deuteronomy 24:17). And likewise, His saying, \"he may not diminish her food, her clothing or her conjugal rights\" (Exodus 21:10). Each of these negative commandments is one commandment. This means to say that each of these is exactly like, \"Do not eat any of it raw or boiled in any way,\" and like, \"for no leaven or honey may be turned into smoke as an offering.\" There is no difference between them. And likewise, His saying, \"You shall not bring the fee of a prostitute or the sale revenue of a dog\" (Deuteronomy 23:19), is one commandment. And likewise, His saying, \"Drink no wine or other intoxicant, etc. And to differentiate [...] And to instruct\" (Leviticus 9-11). That is to say, with one negative commandment did He prohibit [a priest] to enter the Sanctuary or to give instruction while drunk. And that is one of the divisions of the second type of general negative commandments. And the second division is [made up of cases with] words exactly like those of the previous division. However [in such cases], it is the traditionally received explanation that we give separate lashes for each and every one of those connected matters. And that is that when he does them all - even at one time - he is given lashes for each and every one as a distinct prohibition. Of this type is His saying, \"You may not eat within your gates of the tithes of your new grain or your wine or your oil\" (Deuteronomy 12:17). They said in Keritot (Keritot 4b), \"[If one] ate the tithe of grain, wine, and oil (outside Jerusalem), he is liable [separately] for each and every one.\" And they raised a difficulty and said, \"But is one given lashes for a general negative commandment?\" And the answer was, \"The verse is written superfluously. How is this? It is written, 'And you shall eat before the Lord your God, in the place where He shall choose to cause His name to dwell there, the tithe of your grain, etc.' (Deuteronomy 14:23); why did He need to come back and write, 'You may not eat within your gates?' And if you shall say that it is to [make it into a full-fledged] negative commandment - if so, let the verse say, 'You may not eat them within your gates.' Why did the verse need to go back and write all of them ('your new grain or your wine or your oil')? We hear from this, that it is to separate [it into three distinct commandments].\" And there, after give and take, it is clarified that it was not necessary for Him to say, \"and parched grain\" (Leviticus 23:14), such that it was truly mentioned to separate - that one would be liable for parched grain on its own. And in the Talmud, they asked by way of rejection, \"Maybe one is separately liable to receive lashes for parched grain\" - for it is truly mentioned for this - \"whereas for bread and fresh stalks, one is [only] liable for one [set of] lashes?\" So they answered, \"For what law did the Merciful One write, 'parched grain,' in between [the others]? To tell you that one who eats bread, parched grain and fresh stalks is liable for each and every one [individually].\"",
                "Exactly parallel to this is His, may He be exalted, saying \"Let no one be found among you who passes his son or daughter through the fire, or who is an augur, a soothsayer, a diviner, a sorcerer. One who casts spells, or one who consults ghosts or familiar spirits, or one who inquires of the dead\" (Deuteronomy 18:10-11).\" For each one of these things is counted as a separate negative commandment; and they have nothing to do with the first of the two divisions of the second type. The proof about this is His saying, \"a soothsayer, a diviner,\" in the middle; whereas each of them was already clarified to be a separate negative commandment. And that was His saying [this verse], after a soothsayer and a diviner were each also mentioned separately in another verse - and that was His saying, \"do not divine and do not soothsay\" (Leviticus 19:26). And just like soothsayer and diviner are separated, so too do they separate those before them and after them (in the verses in Deuteronomy), [to be] like soothsayer and diviner - as we explained, about bread, parched grain and fresh stalks. And someone besides us already erred about this topic - whether because his mind did not comprehend all of these things, or whether [because] he forgot them. So he counted His saying, \"A harlot or a profaned woman they shall not marry; a woman divorced from her husband they shall not marry\" (Leviticus 21:7), as one commandment. And it was already clarified in the Gemara, Kiddushin (Kiddushin 77a), that he is liable for each and every one [separately], even if it is [all included] in one woman - as we will explain in its place (Sefer HaMitzvot, Negative Commandments 161). And we can grant him an excuse for counting a harlot and a profaned woman as one commandment - as he thought it to be a general negative commandment. And in his thinking, His saying, \"A harlot or a profaned woman they shall not marry,\" was for him, like His saying, \"Do not eat any of it raw or boiled in any way.\" And he did not know that the one was to be separated and the other was not to be separated. And likewise did he not distinguish between His saying, \"you shall not eat bread, parched grain and fresh stalks,\" and His saying, \"he may not diminish her food, her clothing or her conjugal rights.\" However I will not attack him about this. Yet [regarding] his counting a divorcee together with a harlot and a profaned woman as one commandment - he has no argument for this at all. For it's - meaning the divorcee - being separate is clear. And that is His saying, \"a woman divorced from her husband they shall not marry.\" Behold we have explained this great principle - meaning to say, the general negative commandment - and its questions. And we have informed you of those that are separated and those that are [limited] only to the general negative commandment, such that we are only liable for it once; and that the content which is separated is counted as several commandments and that which is not separated is counted as one commandment. And always place this principle in front of your eyes; for it is a great key in verifying the count of the commandments. "

                "That it is inappropriate to count preliminaries that are for one of various purposes.",
                "You should know that sometimes commands appear in the Torah; yet those commands are not commandments, but rather preliminaries to the doing of the commandment - as if He is recounting how it is appropriate for you to do the commandment. An example of this is His saying, \"You shall take fine flour and bake of it\" (Leviticus 24:5). As it is inappropriate to count the taking of fine flour as a commandment or the making of bread as a commandment. Rather that which is counted is His saying, \"And on the table you shall set the bread of display, to be before Me always\" (Exodus 25:30). Behold the commandment is that the bread always be before the Lord. And afterwards, He explained how this bread should be, and from what it should be - and He said that it should be from fine flour and that it should be twelve loaves. And in this very same way is it inappropriate to count His saying, \"to bring you clear oil of beaten olives\" (Exodus 27:20); but rather \"for lighting, for kindling lamps regularly\" - which is the maintenance of the lamps, as is explained in Tamid 83a. And in this very same way does one not count, His saying, \"Take the herbs to yourself\" (Exodus 30:34); but rather the offering of the incense every day - as Scripture explains about it, \"he shall burn it every morning when he tends the lamps. And when Aharon lights the lamps\" (Exodus 30:7-8). And that is the commandment that is counted; whereas His saying, \"Take the herbs to yourself,\" is only a preliminary of the command, to explain how you should do this commandment and what matter this incense should be from. And likewise should one not count, \"Take choice spices for yourself\"; but rather certainly count the command that He commanded that we anoint the high priest, the kings and the holy vessels with the anointing oil described. And apply this to all that is similar to it, such that you will not add what is inappropriate to count. And this is our intention about this principle, and it is a clear matter. However we mentioned it and it has come to our attention because many have erred also about this, and counted some of the preliminaries of the commandments with the commandments themselves as two commandments. This is clear to the one who understands the count of sections that Rabbi Shimon ben Kiara mentioned - he and all those who followed him - to mention the sections in their counts."

                "That it is inappropriate to count each of the parts of a commandment on its own, when their combination is one commandment.",
                "Sometimes there will be a command which is one commandment, but it has many parts - such as the commandment of lulav, which has four species. Behold that we do not say that (Leviticus 23:40), \"the fruit of goodly trees,\" is a separate commandment; \"the boughs of thick trees,\" are a separate commandment; and \"willows of the brook,\" are a separate commandment. For they are all parts of the [one] commandment - since He commanded to combine them. And after they are combined, the commandment is to take all of them into the hand on the designated day. And by the exact same comparison, it is inappropriate to count His saying about purifying someone with <i>tsaraat</i> - that it is with (Leviticus 14:4-5) two living birds, cedar wood, hyssop, fabric dyed scarlet, living water and a ceramic vessel - as six commandments. Rather purifying someone with <i>tsaraat</i> is one commandment in all of its description, and all of these requirements and others - meaning, shaving. For all of these are parts of the commandment that we have been commanded - being the purification of someone with <i>tsaraat</i> - and that is that it be done in the prescribed way. And the exact same comparison applies to that which He commanded us to do regarding recognition of someone with <i>tsaraat</i> - while he is impure - so that he is kept away from. And that is His saying, \"his clothes shall be rent, his head shall be left bare, and he shall cover over his upper lip, etc.\" (Leviticus 13:45). And none of these acts are a separate commandment, but it is rather their combination that is the commandment - and that is that we are commanded to bring about recognition of someone with <i>tsaraat</i>, such that someone who sees him stay away from him; and that his recognition be with this and that. This is like that which we have been commanded to rejoice in front of the Lord on the first day of Sukkot - and its explanation was that the joy be in the taking of this and that (the four species of the lulav). ",
                "And this principle is very subtle in its understanding. And I will explain the nature of its subtlety: It is understood concerning everything about which the Sages, may their memory be blessed, said, \"X and y impede one another\" - like the four species of the lulav - that it is one commandment. Likewise the bread of display and the pure frankincense that is made with it - as their words about this are (Menachot 27a), \"The bread of display and the bowls (of frankincense) impede one another.\" So it is clear that it is one commandment. Likewise anything about which it is understood that the desired outcome is not accomplished by one of the parts - it is then understood that their combination is the matter that is counted. This is like recognition of someone with <i>tsaraat</i>; as it is understood by you that were his clothes rent, but he did not leave his head bare, and he did not cover over his upper lip and he did not call out, \"Impure, impure\" - he will not have done anything. For his recognition will not be accomplished until he does all of them. And likewise is his purification not accomplished without all that is mentioned about the birds, the cedar wood, the fabric dyed scarlet and the shaving. However the point of difficulty is in the things about which they said, \"They do not impede one another.\" For one would have thought that since each one of these parts do not require their counterpart, each one would be a separate commandment. As with their saying (Menachot 38a), \"The blue-purple (<i>tekhelet</i>) is not impeded by the white, and the white is not impeded by the blue-purple\" - it would have been possible for us to say that the white and the blue-purple be counted as two commandments. This is if we had not found a clear statement [otherwise] from them in the Mekhilta of Rabbi Yishmael. It says there, \"It is possible that they are two commandments, the commandment of the white and the commandment of the blue-purple. [Hence] we learn to say (Numbers 15:39), 'That shall be your <i>tzitzit</i> (fringes)' - it is one commandment and not two commandments.\" So it has been already made clear to you that even parts that do not impede one another sometimes constitute one commandment - when their content is singular. For the intention of the <i>tzitzit</i>, is \"in order that you should remember\" (Numbers 15:40). If so - that the principle of the required thing is the remembering - it is counted as one commandment. Behold that it follows that in the count of the commandments, we may not look at their saying, it impedes or it does not impede - but rather only at the content. Is the content singular or is it multiple? [This is] as we explained in the ninth principle of these principles that we are trying to elucidate. "

                "That it is inappropriate to count parts of work, that are required by a command, on their own.",
                "It is well-known that there are times when we are commanded about some action, and Scripture afterwards comes to explain the nature of this action; such that the topic mentioned is explained and it says what it is about. If so, it is inappropriate to count each command that comes in that explanation as a separate commandment. For example - \"And let them make Me a sanctuary,\" is one of the positive commandments: And that is that we should have a house in which it is fit to come and celebrate, and in which sacrificing and gathering take place on holidays. And afterwards, He comes to describe its parts and how to make it. Yet it is inappropriate to count everything that is said about it as a separate commandment. And the topic of sacrifices mentioned in Leviticus follows in this very same way. And that is that the singular commandment is the whole process described for each and every type of sacrifice. For example - with the burnt-offering - it is that we were surely commanded that the process of the burnt-offerings be like this. And that is that it be slaughtered, flayed, dissected, that its blood be sprinkled as described, that its fat be offered, that all of its flesh afterward be burnt with a certain measurement of fine flour mixed with oil and a certain measurement of wine - which are the libations - and that its hide go to the priest that sacrifices it. And this process as a whole is a positive commandment - and that is the precept of the burnt-offering. As the Torah is obligating to do every burnt-offering through this process. And likewise, with the whole process of the sin-offering - its sacrifice, its flaying, offering that which needs to be offered from it and the washing of the vessels in which it was cooked or their breaking. It is all the precept of the sin-offering and it is one commandment. And likewise the precept of the guilt-offering is one commandment. And likewise the precept of the sacrifice of the peace-offerings - and that is that if it is a thanksgiving-offering, it is with bread, or [otherwise] without bread, the priest's taking of the breast and the thigh and waving it - it is all one commandment. And these are all types of sacrifices that include obligations of the individual and the community, except for the guilt-offering - which is always an obligation of the individual, as we explained in our introduction to the Order of Kedoshim (Commentary on the Mishnah). And the reason [to count each as only one commandment] is because the process is the commandment, such that it is inappropriate to count each and every part of the process as a commandment. This is unless they are commands that include all of the sacrifices, and are not specific to one type but not another type - then it would be appropriate to count each of those commands as a separate commandment. For then they would not be one of the parts of the process of one of the sacrifices. For example, His prohibiting sacrificing an animal with a defect; or His command that it be unblemished; or His command that it not be lacking in its time - and that is His saying, \"and from the eighth day onward\" (Leviticus 22:27); and His commanding that every sacrifice be salted - and that is His saying, \"on all your offerings you must offer salt\" (Leviticus 2:13); and His prohibition not to leave it [unsalted] - \"and you shall not omit salt\" (Leviticus 2:13), and His command to eat that which is to be eaten from it. As each one of these commands is a commandment on its own. For not one of them is a part of the commandment of the whole process of a specific sacrifice. Rather their commands include every sacrifice, as we will discuss when we count them.",
                "And it is clear that the priest taking that which he may take is one of the parts of the commandment, as we mentioned with the hide of the burnt-offering. Likewise the first shearings - the whole commandment, is that we separate it and [then] give it to the priest - and likewise the tithe that we give to the Levite. But they have already erred about this, such that they have counted the gifts to the priesthood as a commandment after they have counted some of the commandments that those gifts were a part of - as we explained with the hide of the burnt-offering, and the breast and the thigh of the peace-offerings. And because this principle was hidden from others besides us and they were not aware of it all and they did not comprehend it - they came to counting pouring, mixing, crumbling, salting, presenting, waving and incinerating as separate commandments; and they did not know that they were all parts of the process of the grain-offering. And that is that we were commanded the grain-offering; and afterwards He explained about this topic that was mentioned and what it is about - and that is the precept of the grain-offering. And He said that it should be from fine flour and from bread that is made according to this description or that description - meaning [in] a pan, or a deep-pan or baked in an oven - that it be mixed in oil according to a certain measure, crumbled, that salt and frankincense is put upon it, that it is presented, waved, some of it is taken and incinerated, according to the facets that were explained in Tractate Menachot. But these are all parts of the process. And the matter that follows this whole description is called a grain-offering. If so, the commandment is the command that the process of the sacrifice of bread or of fine flour be that we offer it completely according to this arrangement. And similar to these things in the commandment of the grain offering - meaning its pouring, its mixing, its crumbling, its salting, its presenting, its waving and its incinerating - is His, may He be exalted, saying about <i>chalitsah</i>, \"and she shall remove his shoe, spit in front of him, and declare and say\" (Deuteronomy 25:9). And just like the commandment of <i>chalitsah</i> is one and we do not count <i>chalitsah</i> (removing the shoe) and spitting [separately] - since it is their combination, which is the process of <i>chalitsah</i>, that is one commandment - so too, would we not count [separately], \"and you shall pour oil upon it,\" \"and he shall place frankincense upon it,\" \"you shall surely salt it,\" \"and he shall wave\" and \"and he shall incinerate.\" And this would only be hidden from someone who bases his words on his first impressions without [further] analyzing them - as the Sages, may their memory be blessed, say, \"He said it on the run\" - meaning it was said without observation, but rather what first came to his mind. And this principle [relates to] the commands of the sacrifices and how it is appropriate to count them, such that no new mistakes or confusion creep in at all - as we have explained."

                "That the count of commandments not be increased according to the number of days that one is obligated in that commandment.",
                "It is clear that there are commandments that are obligated for a set amount of time: Some are attached - that is that one is obligated to do that commandment one day after another, like the sukkah and the lulav. And others are done on certain days, like the sacrifices. As an example, we would say that the additional sacrifice of Rosh Chodesh (offered once a month) is one commandment; and likewise the additional offering of each and every holiday of the five holidays - even though they are obligated on several adjacent days. For just like He said, \"and you shall rejoice before the Lord, your God, seven days\" (Leviticus 23:40) - He also said, \"seven days shall you bring a fire offering\" (Leviticus 23:36). Just like the commandment of lulav is singular, so too is the commandment of the additional sacrifice of Passover singular. And likewise with the additional sacrifice of each and every time period. And according to this, it is clear that the holiday (<i>chagigah</i>) offering is also one commandment, even though it is obligated at three [different] times; and so too the sacrifice of appearance and the sacrifice of joy. And this is something that no one erred about, nor would they consider something different. But they made a great disgraceful mistake about something that relates to this. And that is that they counted all of the additional sacrifices as one commandment - the additional offering of Shabbat, the additional sacrifice of Rosh Chodesh and the additional sacrifice of the holidays. But according to this way of counting, they would have been obligated to count the rest of every holiday as one commandment; yet they did not do this. Of course, it is not appropriate to attack them for any of this; since they did not make any type of order in their count, but rather 'ascended to the heavens and descended to the depths.' But the obvious truth is what we told you - that each and every additional sacrifice is a separate commandment, just like each rest is a separate commandment.

                "That it is inappropriate to count the enactment of (fences) [punishments] among the positive commandments.",
                "Regarding this principle, you should know that  all positive and negative commandments are immediately divided into two divisions. The first one is where Scripture does not explain any punishment in any way. Rather it commands or prohibits, but does not make the transgressor liable for punishment, or specify a scourge, on account of that command or that specific prohibition. And the second is that in which the punishment for it is explained. However within this division in which the punishment is explained, there are some commandments for which He, may He be blessed, commanded that the punishment for one who transgresses them is that we stone them with stones; and some about which He commanded us to burn one who transgresses them with fire; and some about which He commanded us to smite one who transgresses them with a sword - as is explained in the received tradition. And there are some about which He commanded us to strangle one who transgresses them, as appears in the explanation; and some of them about which He commanded us to give lashes to one who transgresses them; and some of them about which He designated excision. And that is that the one who transgresses not get a death penalty, but rather - should he die with his sin - not have a share in the world to come, as we explained in the chapter [entitled] Chelek. And there are some of them about which only death was designated. And that is that God shall kill him for his sin, and his death shall atone for him. And they have already explained at the end of Makkot (Makkot 13) regarding any prohibition for which one who transgresses is only liable for excision or is liable for death at the hands of the Heavens - when it is confirmed that he did that sin with witnesses and a warning, [the court] gives him lashes, even though his main judgement is given over to the Heavens. And there are some of them about which He, may He be blessed, commanded us to punish the one who transgresses them, only with his money and not with his body - as He decreed with a robber, an addition of a fifth; and with a thief, a double payment of what he stole. And there are some of them about which He, may He be blessed, commanded us that the one who transgresses them should offer a sacrifice for his transgression and that will atone for him. And behold that all of these punishments are positive commandments. And that is that He commanded us to kill that one, that we should give lashes to the other, that we should stone the third and that we should offer sacrifices for that which we have transgressed. ",
                "And the manner of their count is that we count the four death penalties as four positive commandments. And the language of the Mishnah (Sanhedrin 49b) is, \"This is the commandment of those stoned.\" And likewise did they say (Sanhedrin 52a), \"How was the commandment of those burnt, how was the commandment of those stangled, how was the commandment of those killed?\" And they also said (Sanhedrin 35b) that what He, may He be blessed, said, \"You shall kindle no fire throughout your settlements\" (Exodus 35:3) came to prohibit the punishments on Shabbat. And that which He prohibited the commandment of burning and said, \"throughout your settlements,\" was to say - in the settlement that is a court, do not kindle a fire - even though [the kindling is part of] a positive commandment. They said, \"Burning was within a category. So why was it singled out? [Because] just like burning is specified in that it is one of the four death penalties of the court and does not push off the Shabbat, so too do the other death penalties of the court not push off Shabbat.\" And this is clear, such that no one should have a doubt about it. And likewise is it appropriate to count lashes as a commandment. But it is inappropriate to count every specific punishment as a separate commandment, until we would say, for example, that the commandment that we have been commanded to stone those that profane the Shabbat is a positive commandment, the stoning of someone with an <i>ov</i> is another commandment and the stoning of idolatry is a third, to the point where the count of the commandments would be according to the [classes of] people that are liable for the death penalties of the court - as did someone besides us without contemplation. For if the matter would be like this, it would be appropriate to also perforce count each and every set of lashes on its own, to the point that the lashes for eating a carcass would be a separate commandment, the lashes for eating pork would be a second commandment, the lashes the eating of meat in milk would be a third and the lashes for wearing a forbidden mixture (<i>shatnez</i>) would be a fourth. And for him, the positive commandments should then be according to the count of negative commandments for which we give lashes; and then the positive commandments would perforce be more than four hundred. But just like we do not count all those liable for lashes, but rather only count the type of punishment - and that is lashes - so too do we only count the types of death penalties. And those are stoning, burning, killing (decapitation) and strangulation.",
                "And likewise do we not count those liable for a sacrifice according to their details, to the point that we would say the sin-offering for Shabbat would be a commandment and the sin-offering of idolatry would be [another] commandment. Rather we only count the types of sacrifices, just as we [only] counted the types of death penalties. And you already know that the types of sacrifice change according to the different transgressions for which one is liable for that sacrifice. For there are transgressions for which one is liable an uncertain guilt-offering; and some for which one is liable a variable burnt-offering, and some for which the liability is a definite guilt-offering, and some a fixed sin-offering. And so, the sin-offering is not counted with the guilt-offering. Rather we shall count the obligation of the fixed sin-offering as a commandment, the obligation of the definite guilt-offering as a commandment, the obligation of an uncertain guilt-offering as a commandment and the obligation of the variable burnt-offering as a commandment - regardless of who is the one who is liable for that sacrifice. And we do not pay attention to the different transgressions for which each one would be liable a sacrifice - just like we count lashes as a commandment and do not look at the different transgressions for which each one of them would get lashes. And so there is a separate section [in the Torah] for each of them. And someone besides us has already gotten unnecessarily mixed up about this principle. And due to the great confusion of these matters, it is not [even] appropriate to answer him. ",
                "And I am surprised at a man who counted all of those that are liable for the death penalties of the court - every single one, those liable for excision and those liable for death - among the negative commandments, when he also counted among the the negative commandments, the things from which they were prohibited for which one is liable for death. As the author of the Halakhot Gedolot (Behag) counted one who desecrates the Shabbat among those that are liable for stoning, and then [also] counted, \"you shall not do any work\" (Exodus 20:10). There is no other option but that they without a doubt first thought that the punishments were [individual] negative commandments. But how could one count both the punishment and the matter about which one is liable for that punishment among them? And more difficult than this is that he counted those that are liable for excision and death at the hands of the Heavens as negative commandments; and that they thought that the liability for excision is the counted commandment. So much so that the author of the Sefer HaMitzvot (of Rav Chafetz Gaon) revealed his opinion about this and said this thing in the first chapter - while explaining what is included in that chapter. These are his words: \"And among them are thirty-two matters that He told us that He, may He be blessed, is designated for its doing and not us; and all of them are guaranteed.\" Indeed, by saying, \"among them,\" he is saying that they are from the things he is including in that chapter. And the content of the thirty-two are the twenty-three sins for which one is liable for excision and the nine for which one is liable for death at the hands of the Heavens, as he counted. And the content of his saying, \"guaranteed,\" is that He, may He be blessed, guarantees that he will excise or kill him. If so, there is no doubt that he did not retain with him that he is to believe that all of the 613 commandments are obligations upon us; but rather [thought] that there are are some of them that we are obligated, and some of them that He, may He be blessed, is obligated - as I will explain. And he said that He is designated for their doing, not us! Upon my life, this is a great confusion to me! It is inappropriate to [even] speak about this in any way, as they are clearly empty words. However they all made this mistake by counting the punishments as commandments and became confused by them. Sometimes they would count them by themselves and sometimes they would count [both] the punishments and the thing for which one is punished, and they made them all negative commandments - without reflection. But the true way of counting is that which I have mentioned - that each type of punishment be a positive commandment, such that the law of the payment of a thief be a positive commandment; for we were commanded to punish him with his money according to this measure. And likewise is the addition of a fifth a positive commandment; and the law of the obligation of a fixed sin-offering is a commandment; and the law of the obligation of a definite guilt-offering is a commandment; and the law of an uncertain guilt-offering is a commandment; and the variable sacrifice is a commandment. And each one of these punishments - burning, stoning, killing, strangling and hanging - is its own positive commandment. This is regardless of the [class] of people that are liable for it; just as lashes are one commandment regardless of who is liable. And this is what we wanted to preface about this principle. And with it are all the principles completed, the prefacing of which will assist you in that which we are involved.",
                "It is also appropriate for us to attach this preface: And that is that anything for which one is liable a death penalty of the court or excision is perforce a negative commandment - except for the Passover (sacrifice) and circumcision. For they involve excision, even though they are positive commandments - as they said at the beginning of Tractate Keritot (Keritot 2a). But besides them, there are absolutely no positive commandments for which one who transgresses them would be liable for excision; all the more so a death penalty of the court. And anything about which it appears in the Torah, that if one does a certain action, he is to be killed or become liable for excision - it is certainly known that this act is prohibited and that it is a negative commandment. But behold sometimes Scripture explains the punishment alongside the prohibition, such that it explains the punishment and the prohibition. For example, the desecration of Shabbat and idolatry - about which it states, \"you shall not do any work\" (Exodus 20:10), and \"you shall not worship them\" (Exodus 20:5); and afterwards renders the one who does work [on Shabbat] or who worships idolatry liable for stoning. And sometimes the prohibition is not made clear as a definite negative commandment in Scripture; but He rather mentions the punishment and omits the prohibition. But the principle amongst us is that Scripture does not punish [for something] unless it prohibited [it], and that it is impossible not to have a prohibition for anyone who is liable a punishment. And hence, it is said in every place, \"We have heard the punishment; from where [do we know] the prohibition? [Hence] we learn to say, such and such.\" And when the prohibition is not in Scripture, it is learned out by one of the Talmudic methods - like that which they mentioned about the prohibition of cursing one's father and mother and of striking one's father and mother, which is not explicit in Scripture at all. As it did not say, \"You shall not strike your father.\" Yet it made one who strikes or curses liable for a death penalty. Hence we know that they are negative commandments; and we derived the prohibition for them - and those like them - from other places, by way of analogy. And this does not contradict their saying, \"We do not derive a prohibition from an inference,\" nor their always saying, \"And can we derive a prohibition from a derivation?\" For we only say, \"We do not derive a prohibition from an  inference,\" regarding the derivation from an analogy of a prohibition that is not understood at all. However when we find the punishment for one who does this action explicit in the Torah, we perforce know that it is a forbidden action from which we are prohibited. Yet we regardless derive it from an analogy, so that the principle of their saying, \"Scripture did not punish [for something] unless it prohibited [it],\" be reinforced. But once the prohibition has come to us - not to do that thing - the one who transgressed and did [it] will become liable for excision or death. And know this principle and guard it together with the previous ones, to remember it in all that is coming up."

            "And now I will begin mentioning each and every commandment, and I will explain their designation - as we set our goal at the beginning of our essay - for this is the intention of the book. Behold that I find it proper to add an addition to this intention: And that is that when I mention the commandment for which one receives a punishment - whether it be a positive or a negative commandment - I will mention its punishment. And I will say, \"One who transgresses it will be liable for death, or excision, or a certain sacrifice, or lashes, or one of the death penalties of the court or payments.\" And you should know that that about which we do not mention any punishment: If it is a negative commandment, it is like that which they said, \"It is like he is transgressing  the commandment of the King,\" such that it is not for us to punish him. However with all positive commandments - whenever one is obligated to do one of them, we should give lashes to the one who refrains from doing it until he dies or does it. But if the time [for it] has passed, we refrain from this. Like, for instance, with one who transgressed and did not dwell in a sukkah - we do not give him lashes after Sukkot for his transgression. And know this. And also when I mention commandments for which women are not obligated - both positive and negative commandments - I will say this: \"And women are not obligated in it.\" However it is well known that women do not judge, or testify, or bring sacrifices on their own or fight optional wars. So for all commandments that are contingent upon the court, or witnesses, or the Temple service or optional wars, I do not need to say, \"And women are not obligated in this.\" For this [would be] extraneous speech and there is no need for it.  Moreover, when I mention commandments that are only practiced in the Land of Israel or in the presence of the Temple - be they positive or negative commandments - I will say, \"These are only obligated in the Land of Israel or in the presence of the Temple.\" However, it is also well known that all of the sacrifices are only done in the Temple and that the Temple service is only permitted in [its] courtyard; and likewise that capital punishments are only judged when the Temple is standing. And the language of the Mekhilta is, \"From where [do we know] that we only sentence to death in the presence of the Temple? [Hence] we learn to say, 'from My altar you will take him to die' (Exodus 21:14) - behold, if you have the Temple you put him to death, if you don't have the Temple you do not put him to death.\" And there it also says, \"From where do we know that the Sanhedrin needs to be close to the altar? As it is stated, 'from My altar.'\" And it is also known that both prophecy and monarchy have departed from us until we refrain from our constant transgressions. And then He will atone for us and be merciful to us - as He set out - and bring them back, as it is stated (Joel 2:28), \"And it will be after that, I will pour My spirit on all flesh, your sons and your daughters will prophesy.\" And regarding the return of the monarchy, He said, \"On that day I will restore the fallen sukkah of David, and I will repair its breaches, etc., I will build it as in the days of old\" (Amos 9:11). And it is well known that war and conquering of the cities cannot be without a king and without the counsel of the Great Sanhedrin and without a high priest, as it is stated (Numbers 27:21), \"And he shall present himself in front of Elazar the Priest.\" And hence all of these are well-known to most people - all the positive or negative commandments that are contingent upon sacrifices, Temple rituals, capital punishments, the Sanhedrin, a prophet, a king or optional wars - so that I will not need to say about it, \"This is only obligated in the presence of the Temple,\" since it is [already] clear, as we explained.

And these peace-offerings, that are in addition to the holiday peace-offerings. are called peace-offerings of joy. And they said (Chagigah 6b) that women are obligated in these. And Scripture has already appeared [about it], \"And you shall sacrifice peace-offerings, etc.\" (Deuteronomy 27:7). And the regulations of this commandment have already been explained in Chagigah.

All of this fits into His saying, \"You shall rejoice in your festival.\" And that one is specifically obligated in the drinking of wine is because it is uniquely associated with joy.

And that is His saying, \"They shall eat the meat that night; they shall eat it roasted with fire, with matzah and with bitter herbs\" (Exodus 12:8). And perhaps a questioner will challenge me and say, \"Why do you count the eating of the Pesach-offering, matzah and the bitter herbs as one commandment and not count them as three commandments?\" I would [then] answer him that it is true that the eating of matzah is a separate commandment, as I will explain later (Sefer HaMitzvot, Positive Commandments 158); likewise is the eating of the meat of the Pesach-offering a separate commandment, as we have mentioned. However the bitter herbs are an extension of the eating of the Pesach-offering and are not counted as a separate commandment. And the proof of the matter is that the meat of the Pesach-offering is eaten to fulfill the commandment, whether bitter herbs are available or whether they are not available. But bitter herbs are only eaten with the meat of the Pesach-offering - as His saying, \"upon [...] bitter herbs shall they eat it\" (Numbers 9:11). But [if one ate] bitter herbs without meat, he has not done anything; and we do not say that he has already fulfilled a commandment. And the language of the Mekhilta (Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 12:8:3) is, \"'They shall eat it roasted with fire, with matzah and with bitter herbs' - tells [us] that the commandment of the Pesach-offering is roasted meat, matzah and bitter herbs.\" This means that the commandment is the combination of these. And there, they said, \"From where [do we know that] which you say, that if they do not have matzah and bitter herbs, they fulfill their obligation with the Pesach-offering? [Hence] we learn to say, 'shall they eat it'\" - meaning the meat by itself. \"I might think that if they do not have a Pesach-offering, they [do not] fulfill their obligation with matzah and bitter herbs. Behold you argue: The Pesach-offering is a positive commandment and matzah and bitter herbs are a positive commandment. Behold you have learned that if they do not have matzah and bitter herbs, they fulfill their obligation for the Pesach-offering; so too, if they do not have the Pesach-offering, they fulfill their obligation for matzah and bitter herbs. ([Hence] we learn to say, 'upon matzah and bitter herbs shall they eat it.')\" And there, they [also] said, \"'They shall eat it' - From here, [we know] that the Pesach-offering is to be eaten in a state of satiety, but matzah and maror are not [necessarily] to be eaten in a state of satiety.\" That is because the essence of the commandment is the eating of the meat - as He said, \"They shall eat the meat that night,\" whereas the bitter herbs are an extension of the eating of the meat; and their obligation is explained from these verses, for those that understand them. And the obvious proof of this is the [following statement] in the Talmud - and that is their saying (Pesachim 120a), \"Bitter herbs in our days is rabbinic.\" For there is no obligation from the Torah to eat them by themselves. Rather they should be eaten with the meat of the Pesach-offering. And that is a clear proof that they are from those things that are extensions of the commandment [of the Pesach-offering], and that their eating is not a separate commandment.

And here there is room for the questioner to challenge me, \"Why do you count the second Pesach-offering? That contradicts what you have prefaced in the Seventh Principle, when you said that a law of a commandment is not counted as a separate commandment!\" The questioner of this challenge should know that the Sages already argued about whether the second Pesach-offering is a law of the first, or a distinct command. And the legal decision was that it is a command stated on its own. So therefore it is appropriate to count it separately. In the Gemara (Pesachim 93a), they said, \"'One is liable for excision for [not observing] the first, and one is liable for excision for [not observing] the second.' These are the words of Rabbi (Yehuda HaNasi). Rabbi Natan says, 'One is liable for excision for [not observing] the first, but one is exempt from excision for [not observing] the second.' Rabbi Chananiah ben Akaviah says, 'Even for [failing to observe] the first, one is only liable if he did not fulfill the second.'\" And the Talmud [then] asked and said, \"With regard to what do they disagree? Rabbi holds that [the second Pesach] is its own festival, whereas Rabbi Natan holds that it is a redress for the first, etc.\" Behold we have already made clear, that which we were referring to. And there (Pesachim 93b), they said, \"Therefore, one who was volitional about this one and that one\" - meaning that he volitionally did not offer the first Pesach-offering nor the second Pesach-offering - \"is liable according to everyone; and one was inadvertent about this one and that one, is liable according to everyone. If one was volitional about the first but inadvertent about the second - according to Rabbi and Rabbi Natan, he is liable; according to Rabbi Chananiah ben Akaviah, he is exempt. And likewise, if he was volitional about the first, but sacrificed the second, he is liable according to Rabbi.\" As according to his opinion, there is no redress for the first. (See Mishneh Torah, Paschal Offering 5, where he writes, \"If he was volitional about the first, he should sacrifice the second\" - and that is the opposite of what he wrote here.) And the law in this is completely like Rabbi. But women are not obligated in this commandment; as it has already been explained there that the second [Pesach-offering] is optional for a woman.

It might be even those who are killed according to the testimony of colluding ones.

So in the explanation (Niddah 32b), they said, \"A man becomes impure with white, and a woman with red.\" And the law of the <i>zav</i> and the <i>zavah</i> is not like the law of a man with <i>tsaraat</i> and a woman with <i>tsaraat</i>. And the open proof about this is their saying in Keritiot (Keritiot 8b), \"Four are lacking [full] atonement: The <i>zav</i>; the <i>zavah</i>; the woman after childbirth; and one with <i>tsaraat</i>.\" Behold you see how they counted the <i>zav</i> and the <i>zavah</i> as two, but counted <i>tsaraat</i> as one - whether it is a man or a woman. For the discharge of a man is different than the discharge of a woman.  And the verse that appears about this matter is His saying, \"When she becomes clean of her discharge [...]. On the eighth day she shall take two turtledoves or two pigeons\" (Leviticus 15:28-29). (See Parashat Metzora; Mishneh Torah, Offerings for Those with Incomplete Atonement 1-3.)"

However as a result of the variation of their sacrifices - as you can see - it is perforce required to count each sacrifice individually. For the thing with which one [of them] completes purification is different from the thing with which the other one completes it. This is like waters of purification (mixed with ashes of a red heifer), the waters of a mikveh and the four species for the one with <i>tsaraat</i> are three commandments, even while they are all to purify the impure - as I will explain.

And I will now present a preface that is appropriate that we remember anytime we mention the various types of impurity. And it is that that which we count each type as a positive commandment - its content is not that we are obligated to become impure with a certain impurity, and also not that we are prohibited from becoming impure from it and that it be a negative commandment. Rather the Torah said that anyone who touches this type [of object] becomes impure; or that this thing renders one who touches it impure according to this description. And that is the positive commandment - meaning that this law with which we have been commanded is a positive commandment. And that is His saying, whoever touches this according to this description has become impure; and whoever according to that description does not become impure. But the matter itself is optional - if he wants, he becomes impure; if not, he doesn't become impure. And the language of the Sifra (Sifra, Shemini, Chapter 4:10) is, \"'And their carcass do not touch' (Leviticus 11:8) - I might think that if one touched a carcass, he receives lashes. [Hence] we learn to say, 'and to these you shall become impure' (Leviticus 11:24). I might [then] think that if one saw a carcass, he should go and become impure from it. [Hence] we learn to say, 'and their carcass do not touch.' How is this? You shall say, it is an option.\" And this commandment that has been told to us about this law - that one who touches this become impure; and that he will be impure, such that he will be obligated about everything that impure people are obligated, [such as] to exit from the camp of the Divine Presence, not to eat consecrated food, not to touch it and other things besides this - this is the command. That means to say, one becoming impure from this type when he touches it or was proximate to [it] in such a manner. And remember this matter with every one of the types of impurity.

And that is His, may He be blessed, saying, \"and he shall bathe in water\" (Leviticus 15:16). And it comes in the tradition that it is water that all of one's body can enter, and that is the measurement of a mikveh - unless the waters are running waters, which have no measurement; as is explained in the analysis of this commandment. And it is among the stipulations specifically for the <i>zav</i>, that the waters that purify him be running - as in the Torah, it says, \"living waters\" (Leviticus 15:13). And the intention of the statement that immersion is a positive commandment is not that anyone impure is obligated to perforce be purified, in the same way that anyone covered by a cloak must make <i>tzitzit</i>, or anyone with a home must make a parapet. Rather what is intended is the law of immersion - and that is that the Torah told us that anyone who wants to be purified from his impurity will only complete it with immersion in water; and he will then be purified. And the language of the [Sifra] (Sifra, Acharei Mot, Section 5:3) is, \"'And he shall bathe [...] in water' (Leviticus 16:26) - I might think that it is a decree of the King (that he must immerse). [Hence] we learn to say, 'and then he may come to the camp' - from his impurity.\" This hints to the principle that we have explained - that the law is only that anyone who wants to become pure do this. That is the law, and that is the commandment - and not that he be obligated perforce to immerse. Rather, anyone who wants to remain impure and not enter the camp of the Divine Presence for a certain time is allowed [to do so]. And it has already appeared in the books of truth that one who becomes impure and immerses is purified, but he does not complete his purification until the sun goes down for him. And it also appears in the accepted tradition that when he immerses, his naked flesh must be in contact with the water itself and that there not be anything separating between him and the water. Behold this commandment has been explained to you - and that is the commandment of immersion; and it includes the regulations of the mikveh, the regulations of bathing and the regulations of one who has immersed that day (before sunset).

                "That is that He commanded the <i>metsora</i> (a person with <i>tsaarat</i>) to shave, and that is its second purification - as it is explained at the end of Negaim. And that is His saying, \"And [...] on the seventh day, he shall shave\" (Leviticus 14:9). And the essence of their words has already preceded [this] (Sefer HaMitzvot, Positive Commandments 93), \"Three shave, and their shaving is a commandment: The nazarite; the <i>metsora</i>; and the Levites.\" And the laws of this commandment have already been explained at the end of Negaim. And here I will explain the reason for our counting the shaving of the <i>metsora</i> and the bringing of his sacrifice as [two] separate commandments. And that is because there is no connection for the <i>metsora</i> between the shaving and the bringing of his sacrifices. And the purpose of the shaving is distinct from the purpose that is accomplished by bringing his sacrifices. And that is because the purification of the  <i>metsora</i> is dependent upon his shaving. And in the sixth chapter of Nazir (Nazir 44b), they said, \"What is the difference between a nazarite and a <i>metsora</i>? It is only that the purification of this one is dependent upon days and the purification of that one is dependent upon his shaving\" - meaning to say the <i>metsora</i>. And when the <i>metsora</i> shaves and completes his second shaving, he is pure from [continuing to] give off impurity like a creeping animal, as is explained at the end of Negaim (Negaim 14). However, he is still lacking [complete] atonement until he brings his sacrifices - like the other ones that lack [complete] atonement, as is explained there. So the purpose of his shaving was to be pure from [continuing to] give off impurity like a creeping animal - whether or not he brought his sacrifices. Whereas the purpose of bringing his sacrifices is the completion of his atonement - like the other ones that lack [complete] atonement, meaning the <i>zav</i>, the <i>zavah</i> and the woman after childbirth. And we have already been preceded by their saying (Keritot 8b), \"Four are lacking [complete] atonement.\" And there it is made clear that the nazarite is not one lacking atonement. Rather that action (his sacrifice) is included in it - meaning to say that the [shaving] and the bringing of the sacrifice permit him to drink wine; however one of them will not suffice without the other. Instead, the shaving is connected to the sacrifice and the sacrifice is connected to the shaving, and they [only] achieve their purpose when they are combined - and that is that they permit those things that were forbidden to him in the days of his being a nazarite. And in the sixth [chapter] of Nazir (Nazir 46b), they said, \"One who shaves over his sacrifice, and it is found to be disqualified - his shaving is disqualified and his sacrifices do not count for him.\" Behold it has been made clear to you that the shaving is from the stipulations of the sacrifice and the sacrifice is from the stipulations of the shaving. And it is also explained in the Tosefta (Nazir 15a) that a nazarite that has completed his days is [still] forbidden to shave, to drink wine and to become impure with corpses until he does that whole process - and that is the shaving of purification, as it is explained in the sixth [chapter] of Nazir (Nazir 45b). And that is that he shaves at the opening of the Tent of Meeting, throws his hair under the urn and offers his sacrifices - as Scripture explains. And you will find that in most places, they called the bringing of [these] sacrifices, \"shaving.\" And in some places in the Mishnah, they said in explanation (Nazir 11b), \"[One who says,] 'Behold I am nazarite and it is upon me to shave, etc.'\" - by which, he means that he will bring the sacrifices of the nazarite and offer them on his behalf. Behold it has already been made clear to you that \"shaving\" is used [to mean] the bringing of the sacrifices. And the reason for this is that it is a part of them - as we have explained - and it is with their combination that the status of nazarite is removed, and the nazarite may drink wine. However the shaving of impurity (of a <i>metsora</i>) is a law of the commandment, as we have explained earlier (Sefer HaMitzvot, Positive Commandments 93).

And that is His, may He be exalted, saying, \"As the person with a leprous affection, his clothes shall be rent [... and he shall call out, 'Impure; impure!]'\" (Leviticus 13:45). And the proof about its being a positive commandment is their saying in the Sifra (Sifra, Tazria Parashat Nega'im, Chapter 12:5-6) \"Because it is stated (of the high priest, Leviticus 21:10), 'his hair he shall not grow long and his clothes he shall not rend, etc.,' I might think (that this holds) even if he is afflicted. And how will I fulfill, 'his clothes shall be rent and his hair shall grow long?' With all other people besides the high priest. [Hence] we learn to say, 'with a leprous affection' - even if he be the high priest - his clothes shall be torn; 'and his hair shall grow long' - he shall grow out his hair.\" And it is clear that a high priest is [prohibited] with a negative commandment from renting [his clothes] and growing [his hair] long. And the principle with us is that any place you find a positive commandment and a negative commandment - if you can fulfill both of them, that is best; but if not, the positive commandment pushes off the negative commandment. And since we have found that their language instructs that when the high priest has <i>tsaarat</i>, he grows [his hair] out and rents [his clothes], it indicates that it is a positive commandment. And the tradition has already come [to teach] that people with other impurities are also obligated to make a sign about themselves, such that other people will distance themselves from them. And the language of the Sifra (Sifra, Tazria Parashat Nega'im, Chapter 12:9) is, \"From where [do we know that the same holds for] someone impure from a corpse or one who had sexual intercourse with a menstruant woman? [Hence] we learn to say, 'and he shall call out, \"Impure; impure!\"'\" And the explanation is that anyone impure must announce his impurity and place a sign upon himself, through which it will be known that he is impure, and one touches him is impure - hence they will distance themselves. And behold it has been explained that women are not obligated in [providing for] the recognition of a <i>metzora</i>. And that is their saying (Sotah 23a), \"A man grows [his hair] out and rents [his clothes], but a woman does not grow [her hair] out and rent [her clothes].\" But she does cover the lip and makes known that she is impure, like other impure people.

And the explanation (Rosh Hashanah 22a) comes [and tells us] that \"this testimony is given over to them\" - meaning that this commandment is not given over to each and every individual, like the Shabbat of creation, towards which every individual counts six days and rests on the seventh. [Here, it is not] that when each and every individual sees the [new] moon, he determines that today is Rosh Chodesh (the first of the month), or that he should count some Torah matter and establish the new month or look into the lateness of the Spring - or something else that is fitting to observe - and add a month. Rather, this commandment is always only done by the High Court, and only in the Land of Israel. And the sighting [of the new moon] has therefore been annulled for us today with the absence of the High Court, just like the offering of sacrifices has been annulled with the absence of the Temple. And the heretics called Karaites have referred to this and erred about it. And this is a principle that even some of the rabbis did not concede and followed them into the darkness and the shade. You should know that the calculation that we count with today, through which we know Rosh Chodesh and the holidays, is impossible to do outside of the Land. However in the absence of sages in the Land of Israel, it is possible for a court that was ordained in the Land of Israel to intercalate years and determine months outside of the Land, like Rabbi Akiva did - as is explained in the Talmud (Berakhot 63a) - yet there is a great and strong question about this. And it is known that the Great Court, however, was in the Land of Israel; and that they were the ones that determined the months and intercalated the years in ways that were passed on to them, [doing so] in their gathering together. And this is one of the great principles of the faith - only those that have a deeper knowledge know it and see it in its place. And that is that that which we count today outside of the Land with the work of intercalation that is in our hands - and say that this day is Rosh Chodesh and that day is a holiday - is not because we have determined the holiday from our [own] calculation in any way. Rather, it is because the Great Court in the Land of Israel had already determined that this day is Rosh Chodesh or a holiday. And since they said that today is Rosh Chodesh or a holiday, it is [actually] Rosh Chodesh or a holiday - whether this action of theirs was through calculation or sighting - as appears in the explanation (Rosh Hashanah 25a), \"'These are the set times of the Lord [...] which you shall proclaim as sacred occasions' (Leviticus 23:4); I have no other set times besides these\" - meaning to say, the ones that they say are the sacred times, even under duress, even in error, even inadvertently - as it appears in the tradition. And we indeed consider the day determined by them - meaning the inhabitants of the Land of Israel - to be Rosh Chodesh. As it is upon [their] work itself that we count and determine [it] - not upon sighting; and it is upon their calculation that we rely, and not upon our [own] calculation. Rather our calculation is just an exposition of the matter. And understand this. And I will explain to you further. If we were to assume, by way of illustration, that the [Jewish] residents of the Land of Israel disappeared from the Land of Israel - God forbid that God would do this, since He promised that He would not erase the traces of the nation [there] totally - and that there would not be a court there, nor a court outside the Land of Israel that was ordained there. [In such a case,] this calculation of ours would surely not help us at all in any way. For we may only calculate months and intercalate years outside the Land of Israel according to the conditions mentioned, as we have explained - 'for out of Zion comes forth Torah.' And when someone with a complete intellect examines the [related] statements of the Talmud with this approach, everything that we said will become clear, without a doubt. And note that there were hints that appear in Scripture that indicate the principles of this work upon which we should rely to know Rosh Chodesh and the intercalation of years. Among them is His saying, \"You shall keep this ordinance at its set time from year to year\" (Exodus 13:10). They said (Mekhilta DeRabbi Shimon Bar Yochai 13:9), \"It teaches that we only intercalate the year during the period that is proximate to the sacred occasion (Pesach).\" And they said [further], \"From where [do we know] that we only sanctify the month during the day? [Hence] we learn to say, 'from year to year (literally, from day to day).'\" And they [also] said (Megillah 5a), \"You calculate months for years, but you do not calculate days for years.\" This indeed indicates that the addition in this is in fact a full month. And they said [further], \"'A month of days' - you count the days of a month, and you do not count the hours of a day.\" And His saying, \"Observe the month of Spring\" (Deuteronomy 16:1), indicates that it is fitting that we preserve the seasons of the year in our years, and that is why it is [also] solar. And the regulations of this commandment have already all been completely explained in the first chapter of Sanhedrin, in Tractate Rosh Hashanah and in Berakhot.

However had they said, \"From where [do we know that] the days are a commandment; and from where [do we know that] the weeks are a commandment\" - it would have been two commandments. And this will not be lost on the one that will not be fooled by the words. Since were you to say, \"It is an obligation to do such and such,\" it surely does not necessarily make that action a separate commandment.

And perhaps one might think that this commandment is not practiced for [all] the generations, since the seven nations have already ceased to exist. However it is [only] one who does not understand the topic of a practice that is practiced for the generations or that is not practiced for the generations who will think this. For it is not said about a command that is finished by the arrival of its purpose - without it being dependent upon a specific time - that it is not practiced for the generations. Rather it is practiced in each and every generation that the thing is found to be possible. Would you think that when God, may He be exalted, destroys the seed of Amalek and cuts it off with finality - as it will soon be, as He promised us by His saying, \"I will surely blot out the memory of Amalek\" - it is not for the generations? This would never be said! Rather it is practiced in each and every generation: Any time that the seed of Amalek is found, it is commandment to cut it off. And so too is killing the seven nations and destroying them a statement that was commanded; and it is a commanded war. And we are commanded to search for them in each and every generation until they are finished and not a single man of them remains. And so did we do in the days of David. [Then their] remnants scattered and mixed in with the [other] nations, until no root of them remained. But it is not because they have been cut off that this commandment that we have been commanded [should be considered] a commandment that is not practiced for the generations - and even after they have been finished and they have been destroyed. For these commandments are not connected to a specific time or place, like the commandments that were specific to the desert. Rather they are connected to to all times that it is found that this command is possible. And more generally, it is surely appropriate for you to understand and know the difference between commandments and that thing about which we were commanded. For, many times, the commandment will be practiced for the generations, but the thing about which we were commanded has already disappeared from certain times and places. But it does not turn into a commandment that is not practiced for the generations with the disappearance of the thing about which we were commanded. Rather it is [considered] not practiced for the generations when the matter is the opposite. And that is when certain content is in existence, but one is [only] obligated to do an action or a law at a certain time. But today it is not practiced, even though the thing is found with that matter. For example, a Levite who was disqualified in the desert is suitable today with us, as is explained in its place (Chullin 24a). And understand this principle and place it upon your heart.

And even though he was included regarding this with [all of] Israel, in His saying, \"and you shall love your neighbor as yourself (Leviticus 19:18) - since this stranger is a convert (and a full member of Israel) - however because he entered into our Torah, God added love upon love and designated an additional commandment for him. [This is] as He did with the prohibition of, \"And you shall not oppress\" (Leviticus 25:17); He [also] said, \"And you shall not oppress a stranger\" (Exodus 22:20). And it is explained from the language of the Gemara (Bava Metzia 59b) that we are liable by oppressing the convert on account of, \"And you shall not oppress,\" and on account of, \"And you shall not oppress a stranger.\" [So] we are also obligated to love him on account of, \"and you shall love your neighbor as yourself,\" and on account of, \"And you shall love the stranger.\" And this is clear - there is no doubt about it. And I do not know a [single] man from whoever counted the commandments that botched this. And in most [books of] Midrash, they explained that God commanded about the convert, just like He commanded us about Himself - He said, \"And you shall love the Lord, your God\" (Deuteronomy 6:5), and He said, \"And you shall love the stranger.\" (See Parashat Ekev; Mishneh Torah, Human Dispositions 6.)"

And that is His, may He be exalted, saying, \"Just scales\" (Leviticus 19:36). And the language of the Sifra (Sifra, Kedoshim 8:7) is, \"'Just scales' - justify the scales well. 'Just weights' - justify the weights well. 'A just ephah' - justify the ephah well. 'And a just hin' - justify the hin well.\" And it is already known that the ephah is the dry measure and the hin is the wet measure. And all of these matters are one, [even] if the type of measure varies according to the thing that is weighed or measured - regardless, it is a measurement that is evaluated. And all of these - meaning, the leveler, the scales and the ephah - are called measures; and the command, that we have been commanded to maximize the exactitude of the accepted measurement for each and every type, is called the commandment of measures. And the language of the [Sifra] (Sifra, Kedoshim 8:10) is, \"On this condition, I brought you out of the Land of Egypt - that you take upon yourselves the commandment of measures. For all who acknowledge the commandment of measures, acknowledge the exodus from Egypt; and all who deny [it], deny the exodus from Egypt.\" And the regulations of this commandment have already been explained in the fifth [chapter] of [Bava] Batra.

And that is His, may He be exalted, saying, \"In the presence of the elderly you shall rise and you shall respect an elder\" (Leviticus 19:32). And the language of the Sifra is, \"Rising that has honor.\" And the regulations of this commandment have already been explained in the first chapter of Kiddushin. And you should know that even if this commandment is obligatory for all people in general - meaning to honor sages, and even [towards] a sage that is one's equal in wisdom, like they explained in their saying (Bava Metzia 33a), \"The Torah scholars in Babylonia would stand up for one another\" - you should know that there are additional [obligations] of honor for the student. And that is because the honor a student is obligated towards his teacher is much more than the honor due to a sage [in general]. And along with the honor, he is obligated to fear him. For they have already explained that the law of his teacher upon him is like the law of his father, whom Scripture has obligated him to honor and fear. And they already said (Sanhedrin 5b) that it is not permissible to disagree with his rabbi - meaning a disagreement that breaks with his instruction and legal decision, such that he relies upon his [own] wisdom and teaches or decides and instructs, unless [his teacher] gives him permission. And it is not permissible to quarrel with him, nor to get upset with him. And he may not suspect him regarding his actions or words with various suspicions, as it is possible that this was not [his teacher's] intention. And in the chapter [entitled] Chelek (Sanhedrin 110a), they said, \"Anyone who disagrees with his teacher is as if he disagrees with the Divine Presence, as it is stated (Numbers 26:9), 'when they strove against the Lord.' And anyone who argues with his teacher is as if he argues with the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is stated (Numbers 20:13), 'These are the waters of Meribah, [where the children of Israel quarreled with the Lord].' And anyone who gets upset with his teacher is as if he is upset with the Divine Presence, as it is stated (Exodus 16:8), 'Your complaints are not against us, but against the Lord.' And anyone who suspects his teacher is as if he suspects the Divine Presence, as it is stated (Numbers 21:5), 'And the people spoke against God, and against Moses.'\" And this is completely clear, since the disagreement of Korach and the argument of the Children of Israel - and their complaint and their accusation and their suspicion - was with Moshe, who was the teacher of all of Israel; but Scripture put all of these matters of theirs towards God. And in the explanation (Avot 4:12), they said, \"The fear of your teacher is like the fear of the Heavens.\" And [this fear] is all deduced and proved from Scripture's commanding [us] to honor parents and sages, as is explained in many places in the Talmud - but that [does not make] it a separate commandement. And understand this. (See Parashat Kedoshim; Mishneh Torah, Torah Study)."

And there are [also] among them, commandments that are obligatory on an individual if he did a certain act or something happens to him - such as a sacrifice for an inadvertent or volitional [sin]. And among these commandments are also laws, like those we explained - such as the [law] of the Hebrew slave, the law of the Hebrew maidservant, the law of the Canaanite slave, the law of the unpaid guardian, the law of the borrower and the others that were previously mentioned - it is possible that an individual will live all of his life and not deal with it, and so not be obligated in this commandment.

And among them is one who strikes the ground with a stick that is in his hand - repetitive strikes - and yells unusually, ignores his thoughts and stares at the earth a long time until he is visited by effects of a seizure, and tells over what will happen in the future. And I have already seen this a few times in the far West. [Also] among them is one who spreads out sand and shapes forms in it; and this is very famous in the West.

And this prohibition is so that we will not resemble the idol worshippers, since the idolatrous priests would do this - as they would only shave the hair of their temples. So they had to clarify in Tractate Yevamot (Yevamot 5a) and say, \"Rounding the whole head is called rounding\" - so that it not be said that the point of the resemblance is the shaving of the temples and the leaving of the rest of their hair, like the idolatrous priests do; whereas when one shaves it all, there is no resemblance to them. Behold it is informing us that it is not permissible to shave the temples in any case - not by themselves and not with the [rest of the] head. And he is liable for lashes for each one of them; so he is liable for two [sets of] lashes if he shaved his whole head. But it is appropriate that we not count this [as] two commandments, even though he is liable for two [sets]. For there are not two expressions belonging to one negative commandment. As if He had said, \"You shall not round off the corner of the head on the right nor the corner of the head on the left,\" and we would have found them liable for two [sets], it would have then been possible to say that they be counted as two commandments. However in that it is one expression and the same content, behold it is truly one commandment. And even though it appears in the explanation that this negative commandment includes different, distinct parts of the body and that one is liable for each part separately, this does not require that they be multiple commandments. And the regulations of this commandment have already been explained at the end of Makkot. However women are not obligated in it.

And He did not say, \"nor shall you destroy your beard,\" but \"nor shall you destroy the corner\" - meaning to say not to shave even one corner of the entire beard.

And the prohibition about this was already repeated with His saying, \"You shall not make any lacerations in your flesh for the dead\" (Leviticus 19:28). And it has already been explained in the Gemara, Yevamot (Yevamot 13b), that the essence of the verse, \"you shall not gash yourselves,\" is, you shall not make a wound. And there it also says, \"'You shall not gash yourselves,' is required for itself, as [the Torah] is saying, 'Do not make a wound for a corpse.\" And in the Gemara, Makkot (Makkot 21a), they said, \"A laceration and a gash are the same.\" And there it is explained [that] one who makes a gash for a corpse is liable whether it was [done] with the hand or with a tool; but for idolatry, one is liable with a tool, but by hand, one is exempt - as appears explicitly in prophecy, \"and they gashed themselves according to their practice with knives\" (I Kings 18:28). And they have already said (Yevamot 13b) that included in this is the prohibition of disunity in the religious practices of a city and division [into] groups.

However the essence of [that] verse is [simply] to deter [from this]. And according to what the Sages explained, it is surely a negation, not a prohibition. For they explained that the content of this statement is that God, may He be exalted, is saying that one who will disagree and challenge the priesthood at some future time will not be punished with that which Korach was punished. Indeed he will be [punished], \"Like the Lord spoke through Moshe to him\" - meaning, <i>tzaraat</i> - as that which He said to Moshe, \"Place your hand in your bosom,\" (Exodus 4:6) and as is made clear with King Uzziah (II Chronicles 26).

And that is His, may He be blessed, saying, \"And you shall not desecrate My holy name\" (Leviticus 22:32). And this sin is divided into three parts - two that are general (for all) and one which is specific. Indeed the first of the general ones is anyone who it was demanded of him that he transgress one of the commandments at the time of a religious persecution (<i>shemad</i>) - and the persecutor had in mind to make him sin - whether one of the light commandment or [one] of the weighty commandments; or one who it was demanded of him that he transgress with regards to idolatry, sexual immorality or murder, even if it was not at the time of a religious persecution. Behold [such a one] is obligated to release himself and be killed, and not to transgress - as we explained in the ninth of the Positive Commandments. But if he transgressed and was not killed, he has already desecrated [God's] name and violated this negative commandment. And if the transgressor was in a public place - meaning [in front of] ten Israelites - he has already desecrated [God's] name in public. And he has violated the negative commandment of, \"And you shall not desecrate My holy name,\" and his sin is very great. However he is not lashed, as he was under duress. For a court may only administer the punishment of lashes or a death penalty when volitional - willingly, with witnesses and a warning. And the language of the [Sifra] (Sifra, Kedoshim, Section 4:5) about the one who gives of his offspring to Molekh - \"And I will set My face against that man\" (Leviticus 20:3): They said, \"'That [man],' and not one under duress, and not one inadvertent and not one mistaken.\" Behold it has already been made clear to you that one who worships an idol under duress is not liable for excision nor - all the more so - a death penalty of the court. But he has transgressed [the prohibition of] desecration of [God's] name. And the second part that is also general is when a man does a sin for which he has no desire and no benefit, but rather intends [to show] rebellion or the removal of the yoke of the kingdom of Heaven with his action. Behold this one also desecrates [God's name] and is lashed. And hence He said, \"[You shall not swear falsely by My name,] and desecrate the name of your God\" (Leviticus 19:12). For this one intends to anger [God] with this matter, and he has no physical benefit with it. And the specific part is when a man known for his virtue and goodness does a certain action that appears like a transgression in the eyes of the masses; such that it is not appropriate for someone esteemed to do this type of action, even though the action is permissible.

And that is that the language of a prohibition appears with a burnt-offering - and that is His saying, \"lest you bring up.\" And in another verse, the explanation appears with a command to offer the burnt-offering inside - and that is His, may He be exalted, saying, \"and there shall you bring up\" - and that is the positive commandment that one offer the burnt-offering there, \"in the place that the Lord will choose.\" However the [only] command that comes [for] the other consecrated animals is that they offer them inside - and that is His saying, \"and there shall you do\" - to teach that you should not do [it] outside. But the principle with us is that a negative commandment derived from a positive commandment is a positive commandment. And that is their saying, \"I would still say [that] other consecrated animals would only be with a positive commandment.\" [This] means to say that the one who sacrifices other consecrated animals would only [transgress] a positive commandment - that is that one who sacrifices other consecrated animals outside would only transgress a negative commandment that is derived from a positive commandment. And hence He said, \"and there shall you bring up your burnt-offerings\" - so as to extend the comparison, and that the [other] sacrifices be like the burnt-offering: So just like one who offers a burnt-offering [outside] is with a negative commandment, so too [with] the other sacrifices. And one who transgresses this negative commandment is liable for excision when volitional; and a fixed sin-offering when inadvertent. And the language of excision is [found] in Parashat Acharei Mot about someone who brings up an offering outside - it is written, \"who brings up a burnt-offering or a sacrifice: And does not bring it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting [...], he will be excised\" (Leviticus 17:8-9). And in the [Sifra]: \"'That man will be excised from his people' - we have understood the punishment. From where [do we know] the prohibition? [Hence] we learn to say, 'Take care lest you bring up your burnt-offerings.'\" And the language of the Gemara, Zevachim (Zevachim 106a), is, \"The punishment is written, and the prohibition is written: The punishment, 'he will be excised'; the prohibition, 'Take care lest you bring up.'\" And the regulations of this commandment have already been explained in the thirteenth [chapter] of Zevachim.

                "That He prohibited us from slaughtering any of the sacrifices outside. And this is called, slaughtering outside. And at the beginning of Keritot (Mishnah Keritot 1:1), when they listed all those that are liable for excision (<i>karet</i>), they counted one who slaughters outside and one who offers [the sacrifices] outside as two. Indeed, if one slaughters outside, he is liable for excision - even if he does not bring [it] up - from the time he slaughtered it. That is the language of the Torah; and that is His saying, \"who slaughters an ox or sheep or goat in the camp, or slaughters outside the camp, and does not bring it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, etc.\" (Leviticus 17:3-4). Nevertheless, the prohibition about this - meaning to say, slaughtering outside - is not explicit, but is rather learned from the precept that He does not punish unless He prohibited, which we situated as a principle in our introduction with which we introduced [all] of these commandments. And the language of the Gemara, Zevachim (Zevachim 106a), is, \"[One who brings up and slaughters outside is liable for two.] Granted, for bringing up, the punishment is written, and the prohibition is written: The punishment, 'he will be excised' (Leviticus 17:9); the prohibition, 'Take care lest you bring up' (Deuteronomy 12:13). [This is] in accordance with Rabbi Avin, who says, 'Wherever it is stated in the Torah, Observe; Lest; or Do not, it is nothing except a prohibition.' But [for] slaughtering, why is one liable? Granted the punishment is, 'he shall be excised from among his people.' [But] from where [do we know] its prohibition?\" And after [many] words, the [conclusive] statement came out with this language (Zevachim 107a): \"He said, 'there you shall bring up your burnt offerings and there you shall do' (Deuteronomy 12:14). It compares doing to bringing up - just like [with] bringing up, He punished and prohibited; so too, [with] doing, He punished and prohibited.\" With their saying, \"there you shall bring up [...] and there you shall do,\" it is an indication that His saying, \"there you shall bring up your burnt offerings\" - and that is the offering, meaning its incineration on the fire - [can be compared to] His saying, \"there you shall do like everything I command you,\" which includes this offering, [as well as] the slaughtering. For He also commanded the slaughtering. And know that one who slaughters outside inadvertently is liable for a fixed sin-offering. And it is necessary that you know that one who slaughters consecrated animals at this time outside the location of the courtyard is liable for excision. And in the explanation, they said (Zevachim 107b), \"One who brings up [a sacrifice] outside: Rabbi Yochanan says, 'He is liable.'\" And that is the law, for it is fitting to offer [even today]. And the true principle with us is [that] we may sacrifice, even though there is no Temple. And the regulations of this commandment have already been explained in the thirteenth [chapter] of Zevachim.

And the language of Sifra (Sifra, Emor, Chapter 7:4) is, \"'And as a fire-offering you shall not place of them - these are the fats. I only [know about] all of them. From where [do we know even] some of them? [Hence] we learn to say 'of them' - even some of them.\" Behold it has been made clear to you that one who offers an animal with a blemish has already transgressed four negative commandments - when we count the burning of the innards as one negative commandment. However if we count it as two negative commandments - like the teacher that is speaking here - behold he would be transgressing five negative commandments. For he counts some of the innards as one matter and all of them as another matter; as he said, 'of them' - even some of them,\" even though it is one negative commandment. For this teacher holds that we give lashes for general negative commandments. Hence they said in the Sifra (Sifra, Emor, Section 7:5), \"One who consecrates animals with blemishes to the altar transgresses on account of five negative commandments: On account of, do not consecrate; on account of, do not slaughter; on account of, do not sprinkle the blood; of, do not burn up all of it; and of, do not burn up part of it.\" [And in the Gemara (Temurah 7b), it says,] \"Rava said, 'We do not give lashes for general negative commandments.' An objection was raised [from the Tosefta (1:10)]: One who consecrates animals with blemishes on the altar violates five categories. This is a conclusive refutation of Rava.\" Behold it has been made clear to you that that which they said that he transgresses five is with the logic that holds that we give lashes for a general negative commandment. And hence he counts the negative commandment that includes all of them and some of them as two categories. And this is well-known as the opinion of Abbaye in every place, as we explained in Principle 9 of this essay (Sefer HaMitzvot, Shorashim 9:5). But according to Rava, however, who says that we do not give lashes for general commandments, one is [only] liable four [set] of lashes for the burning up - as it is explained in the Gemara, Sanhedrin (Sanhedrin 63a), according to that which we illustrated in Principle 9. So, together, they are only four negative commandments, as is explained in Scripture. As one who consecrates and offers an animal with a blemish is lashed four [sets of] lashes for these four negative commandments, as we explained. And all of these negative commandments are with an animal with a permanent blemish, as is demonstrated by Scripture when it said, \"(a limb) extended or contracted, [... (with its testes)] bruised or crushed or torn or cut\" (Leviticus 22:23-24) - and these are all permanent blemishes. And the regulations of all the blemishes in animals - permanent and temporary - have already been explained in the sixth [chapter] of Bekhorot. And likewise have the regulations of these four negative commandments, of offering an animal with a blemish, been explained in scattered places in Tractate Temurah and Zevachim.

And among them, He mentioned, \"and the tithe (<i>terumah</i>) of your hand\" (Deuteronomy 12:17) - without a doubt, that is the firstfruits. Indeed, it is known that the priestly tithe (<i>terumah</i>) does not require bringing to a place - how would one be careful from eating it \"in your cities?\" And the language of the Sifrei (Sifrei Devarim 72:9) is, \"The verse only came about one who eats firstfruits who has not recited the declaration over them, that he transgresses a negative commandment.\" And it has already been explained at the end of Makkot (Makkot 19a) that we are only liable for them before he has placed them in the [Temple] courtyard. But once he has placed them in the courtyard, one is exempt for them, even though he has not recited [the declaration]. And the condition that there is with the second tithe also exists with firstfruits - meaning to say, that one is not liable for them when he eats them outside until they see the presence of the Temple. But when someone ate them outside after they saw the presence of the Temple before they are placed in the courtyard, he is lashed only if he is a priest. However an Israelite who eats firstfruits - even after the declaration - is liable for death at the hands of the Heavens. And in the second [chapter] of Bikkurim, (Bikkurim 2:1), [they] said, \"For the priestly tithe and for firstfruits, one is liable for death, and a fifth; and they are forbidden to outsiders.\" So if an outsider eats them: If he was volitional, he is liable for death; and if inadvertent, he adds a fifth - exactly like the law of the priestly tithe. For since Scripture called them, \"the tithe of your hand,\" it becomes liable to the laws of the priestly tithe. And it is appropriate for you to understand this properly until you will not get it confused: And that is that when the priest eats firstfruits from when they have seen the presence of the Temple before they have been placed in the courtyard, he is lashed; and its prohibition is from here - \"You may not eat in your cities, etc. and the tithe of your hand,\" as is explained in Makkot (Makkot 17).

And it is learned [from the use of the same word,] desecrate with the priestly tithe, [the eating of] which is an iniquity [punished by] death, as we have explained.

                "That He prohibited the priests from leaving the Temple at the time of the [Temple] service. And that is His, may He be exalted, saying, \"And from the door of the Tent of Meeting, etc.\" (Leviticus 10:7). And this prohibition was already repeated when He said about a high priest, \"And out of the sanctuary shall he not go\" (Leviticus 21:12). And the language of the [Sifra] (Sifra Shemini, Mechilta d'Miluim 2:42-43) is \"'And from the door of the Tent of Meeting he shall not go out' - I might think [even] not during the service. [Hence] we learn to say, 'shall he not go out and he will not desecrate.' I would [hence] say, [only] at the time of the service. 'For the anointing oil of the Lord [is upon you]' - I only know [about] Aharon and his sons, that if they went out at the time of the service, they would be liable for death. From where [do we know] about the priests in all the generations? [Hence] we learn to say, 'for the anointing oil of the Lord is upon you.'\" And know that there is a supplement with the high priest, that he may not accompany his dead [relatives]. And this is the simple understanding of Scripture, from His saying, \"And out of the sanctuary shall he not go.\" And it has already been explained in the second [chapter] of Sanhedrin (Sanhedrin 18a) that if [a relative] of his died upon him, he may not follow the [procession of the] bier. And they brought a proof from His saying, \"And out of the sanctuary shall he not go [and he shall not desecrate].\" And we learn from this that it is permissible for him to serve [in the Temple] on the day that his [relative] dies. And so did they explain, \"And out of the sanctuary shall he not go\": \"Behold another, if he did not go out [but served], he desecrated\" - meaning to say, an ordinary priest. For the service is not permitted for him when he is grieving. Rather he is prohibited from this - meaning to say that he may not serve [while] grieving. And this principle has already been explained to you in Horayot (Horayot 12b). And that is that an ordinary priest that is grieving may not serve, but a high priest may serve when he is grieving. And behold that it has been made clear to you that His saying, \"and he shall not desecrate,\" is a negation - not a prohibition - to say that his service is not desecrated, even thought he is grieving. But the simple meaning is [that] when He said, \"and He shall not desecrate\" - it is a reason for the previous prohibition, which is [that] he shall not go out, so that he shall not desecrate. And according to these things - as has been explained - this negative statement is inappropriate to count separately [as a negative commandment], as has been explained to the one who understands the original principles of this essay. And it has already been explained that these three negative commandments - which are, \"and he shall not let his head be wild, or rend his garments [...] And out of the sanctuary shall he not go\" - have already been repeated with a high priest, to explain their content. [This is] like the prohibition about the divorcee, the <i>zonah</i> and the desecrated woman is repeated to explain some content about these three things that were prohibited to them. For these three negative commandments [to the high priest] are exactly that which was forbidden to them when He said, \"you shall not let your head be wild and do not rend your garments [...] And from the door of the Tent of Meeting he shall not go out.\" And that was what our teacher, Moshe - peace be upon him - said to Elazar and Itamar: That in your excitement about this great distress, the content that is forbidden to you has not become permitted; rather you are [still] in your holiness of being forbidden about unkempt hair, tearing garments and leaving the Temple during the service. And [here] the prohibition was repeated with the high priest, such that we understood that this prohibition [for which one is] liable for death is only during the service. As you see that they brought a proof to explain the matter of His saying, \"And from the door of the Tent of Meeting, etc.\" - from His saying, \"And out of the sanctuary shall he not go.\" And even though there is a supplement in each of these negative commandments that were repeated with the high priests - as we explained - there is no expansion of the count of the commandments with this, for the one who understands our introduction. For the essence of the verse is that he should not do any of this during the service. (See Parashat Shemini; Mishneh Torah, Admission into the Sanctuary 2.)"

And the language of the Sifrei (Sifrei Devarim 163:2-3) is, \"'No part' - in the booty. 'Or inheritance' - in the land.\" Yet you are able to challenge me and ask, \"Why did you list these matters as two commandments, for they are a prohibition about taking a portion in the spoil and the territory of the land, and both of them are within one negative statement?\" You, the questioner, should know that this negative statement has already been divided by His saying, \"The priests the Levites, all the tribe of Levi, shall have no part\" - and that is the prohibition about the taking of the booty of the city. Whereas the second is, \"And they shall have no inheritance\" (Deuteronomy 18:2) - and that is the prohibition about the taking of a portion in the land. And the prohibition of these very two matters has already been repeated to the priests - and that is His saying to Aharon, \"You will have no inheritance in their land,\" at the time of division of the land; \"and you will not have a share among them,\" in the booty. And maybe you would think that these two laws of the priests are two [additional] commandments, such that it is fitting to count them. [However] know that when the prohibition comes to the whole tribe of Levi, the priests have surely already been included. Rather it was repeated with the priests to strengthen [it]. And likewise [with] anything similar to this of general categories and specific items - it is indeed repeated to strengthen [it] or to round out the law when it would not have been complete from [only] one prohibition. However if we were to count His saying to Aharon, \"You will have no inheritance in their land,\" as an addition to that which He said, \"The priests the Levites, all the tribe of Levi, shall have no\" - you would surely be obligated according to this very comparison to count the divorcee, the desecrated woman and the <i>zonah</i> to the high priest as three negative commandments besides the three negative commandments that came from the general category of priests, whether a high [priest] or an ordinary [one]. And if one would say that those are also appropriate to be counted - behold we would say to him that perforce the high priest with a divorcee would be liable twice: Once on account of [being] a priest, and a divorcee is forbidden to him; and secondly on account of [being] a high priest, since she is also forbidden to him with a different negative statement. Yet it has already been explained in Kiddushin (Kiddushin 77a) that he is only liable once. Behold it has been confirmed that a prohibition that is within a general category is the only one to be counted; and that a prohibition which appears about that very content for the individual item - it is in fact only to teach one of the regulations or to round out the law, as I explained in Commandment 165 of these (positive) commandments. And from this very category is the prohibition in which He prohibited the priests, \"They shall not make baldness on their heads [...]\" (Leviticus 21:5). And all of Israel as a general category had already been prohibited with these three negative commandments already when He said, \"You shall not round off the corners of your head\" (Leviticus 19:27); \"you shall not gash yourselves\" (Deuteronomy 14:1); and \"lacerations for the dead\" (Leviticus 19:28). So it was actually repeated for the priests just to round out the law - as it is explained at the end of Makkot (Makkot 20a), when they explained the regulations of these three commandments. But were they negative commandments specifically for the priests and were not to round out the law - but rather commandments themselves - the priest would have been liable two [sets of] lashes for each such act, due to his being an Israelite, and due to his being a priest (respectively). But the matter is not like this. Rather there is one [set of] lashes, like [for] other Israelites, as is explained in its place. And understand this.

It is found, then, that the camel, the hare, the coney and the swine [are prohibited] by Scripture, and the other impure beasts, by an a fortiori argument.

And if it is also a swarming thing of the sea, he is lashed three - one on account of] the swarming things of the earth; one on account of the flying swarming things, the negative commandment of which is also explicit; and one on account of, \"You shall not make yourselves repulsive.\" For it forbids every swarming thing, so that swarming things of the water are also included in, \"anything that swarms\" - by His saying, \"with anything that swarms.\" And if he ate a swarming thing of the earth only, he would be lashed one - on account of, \"All the things that swarm, etc.\" And likewise [for] a flying swarming creature, [he would be liable for] only one - on account of the flying swarming things. And likewise only one for swarming creatures of the water - on account of, \"You shall not make yourselves repulsive.\" And this negative statement including the swarming things of the earth, does not make it that he is lashed twice for a swarming thing of the earth. For [even] if there were a thousand negative statements appearing for us about swarming things of the earth that were all explicit, he would only be lashed for one. For they are all repeated about the exact same content. And even if He said, \"A swarming thing of the earth shall not be eaten\"; \"You shall not eat a swarming thing of the earth\"; \"They shall not eat a swarming thing of the earth,\" a thousand times, it would only make him liable for one [set of] lashes. Could you see those that established this corrupted principle holding that one who wears <i>shatnez</i> (forbidden mixtures) be lashed twice because two negative statements appeared about it? I have never seen them hold this. Rather if another person were to say it, they would disparage him. Yet they do not disparage themselves about their saying that [one who eats] a flying swarming thing or a swarming thing of the earth is lashed twice - once on account of the negative statement that is explicit about it, and once on account of, \"You shall not make yourselves repulsive.\" And this [part] of the matter's explanation would not [even] be lost on a foolish child. But I will [now] return to the matter I started to explain and say that when it happens that a creature is born in a certain seed or a certain fruit and goes out to the exteriority - and even though it has not touched the surface of the ground: Behold if one eats it, he is liable for one [set of] lashes, since a specific negative commandment appeared about it - as we explained in the previous commandment. But if it moved to the ground and walked on it: If one eats it, he is liable once on account of, \"things that swarm upon the earth, you shall not eat them\" (Leviticus 11:42); and once on account of, \"are repulsive, they may not be eaten.\" And if it happened with this that it is not fruitful and does not multiply, he would be liable three [sets of] lashes for it - the two previously mentioned, and the third [on account of,] \"you shall not make yourselves impure through any swarming thing that creeps\" (Leviticus 11:44). And if in addition to these, it flies, he is liable for a fourth [set of] lashes on account of, \"winged swarming things are impure for you; they may not be eaten\" (Deuteronomy 14:19). And if along with this, it would swim in the water even as it flies - as is constantly seen with many species - he would be liable a fifth [set of] lashes on account of a swarming thing of the water that is included in that negative commandment, which is, \"You shall not make yourselves repulsive.\" And if along with this, this creature that comes to exist on its own from food is also a bird, he would also be liable a sixth [set of] lashes on account of, \"These you shall consider repulsive from among the birds; they may not be eaten\" (Leviticus 11:13). And do not dismiss that there be a species of birds that come to exist from rot, as people often see birds larger than a small nut coming to exist from rot. And do not dismiss that there be a species that is itself an impure bird and a flying swarming thing. For this is not unlikely, since it would surely have characteristics of a bird, and actions and characteristics of a flying swarming thing. Do you not see that all the earlier commentaries counted among those [with] six [sets of] lashes, an impure fish [that is also] a swarming thing of the water? And that is also true - do not dismiss it. For it is likely that it be a fish and a swarming thing of the water; or likewise a bird and a swarming thing of the water; or likewise a bird and a flying swarming thing. And that is the <i>putita</i> - which is a bird, a flying swarming thing, a swarming thing of the earth and a swarming thing of the water. And therefore we are liable four [sets of] lashes for it. And one is lashed five for an ant, [as] the ant that is mentioned is a flying ant that comes to exist from rotten fruits and which is not fruitful and does not multiply. One is liable one on account of a swarming thing that separates from food; one on account of a swarming thing of the earth; one on account of that which crawls on the ground; one on account of a flying swarming thing; and one on account of a swarming thing of the water. And a wasp that also comes to exist from rot is - in addition to these - a bird [as well as a] flying swarming thing. And it is only among fools that it be impossible that the ant or wasp or other types of birds and swarming things come to exist from rotten food. For they have no knowledge of natural science, but rather think that it is impossible in all of the species, that one come to exist from another except through a male and a female - since this is what they see. And I have already explained to you the content that you must examine and determine [to know that] a person is liable, for eating a certain creature, so many [sets of] lashes; and [another one] is only liable for [a lesser amount]. And it is made clear to you from these verses that we do not look for a [requisite] size from one who eats an entire creature, and we do not say whether there was [a requisite amount of] a <i>kazayit</i>. Rather, [even] if he ate a small mosquito, he is lashed three [sets of] lashes on account of a swarming thing of the earth; on account of a swarming thing that crawls; and on account of a flying swarming thing. And behold they also said (Makkot 16b), \"One who delays his orifices transgresses on account of do not be repulsive. And one who drinks water from the horn of a bloodletter\" - and that is a tool for drawing out - \"transgresses on account of, 'do not make yourselves be repulsive.'\" And this is an analogy to eating things that are disgusting and drinking disgraceful things which a man pushes away, such that one is forbidden about them. But he is not liable for lashes because of them; for the simple meaning of the verse is only about swarming things. Be we do strike him with lashes of rebellion. Behold it has already become clear to you, from all that we had precede, that we have indeed only taken the prohibition of the swarming thing of the water from this verse - which is, \"You shall not make yourselves repulsive - for no specific prohibition appeared about it besides this.

This means to say that once any meat goes out of its boundaries, it becomes torn - like the most consecrated of the consecrated meat when it goes outside of the [Temple] courtyard; or the lighter consecrated meat when it goes outside of the wall [of Jerusalem]; or meat from the Passover sacrifice when it goes outside of the eating group; or when an [animal] embryo extends its arm outside [of its mother], as is explained in the fourth [chapter] of Chullin. All of these types of meat are designated as, \"and you must not eat meat that was torn in the field.\" And one who eats a <i>kazayit</i> from them is lashed by Torah law. And likewise is meat from a living animal designated as, torn; and one who eats it is lashed. And in the Gemara, Chullin (Chullin 102b), they said, \"'Meat that was torn in the field' - that is meat from a living animal. And the prohibition about this and the commandments preceding this were already repeated (in Ezekiel) regarding the priests alone. For the Torah commanded them to eat the fowl sin-offering, and that is with nipping (<i>melikah</i>). But nipping with ordinary meat is not slaughter, without a doubt, but rather [renders it] a carcass. And it might have crossed our minds that, for them, eating from nipping is also permitted with ordinary meat - and the same would be the law for all invalid slaughter. And hence He explained that they remain within the category of Israelites and with the prohibition of eating carcasses and torn animals. This is what the Sages mentioned, along with another law which they testified to from this verse - [but] we do not intend to mention it in this essay of ours. However eating a beast or animal that develops one of the [conditions that render] it torn (terminally injured or ill), received by tradition, is forbidden - even if it was slaughtered appropriately. And one who slaughters it with a fit slaughter and eats of its meat is lashed by rabbinic law. And the [conditions that render] it torn have already been explained in the Gemara, Chullin (Chullin 42-58). And the regulations of this commandment and the ones before it have been explained at the end of Makkot. (See Parashat Mishpatim; Mishneh Torah, Forbidden Foods 4.)"

And that is that one cuts a limb from it while it is alive and eats a <i>kazayit</i> of that limb in its natural (complete) form, even if there was only the smallest amount of meat to it.

And in Chullin (Chullin 114a), they said, \"Milk and meat - one is lashed for its cooking, and lashed for its eating.\" And in the Gemara, Makkot (Makkot 21b), they said, \"One who cooks a sciatic nerve in milk on a holiday and eats it is lashed five [sets of] lashes: On account of eating a [sciatic] nerve; on account of cooking on a holiday; on account of cooking meat and milk; on account of eating meat cooked with milk; and on account of kindling [a fire].\" And there (Makkot 22a), they said, \"Remove kindling, and insert [the use of] consecrated wood - the prohibition of which is from here: 'And their tree-gods you shall burn in fire […] you shall not do so to the Lord, your God' (Deuteronomy 12:3–4).\" And in the Gemara, Chullin (Chullin 114a), they said, \"The [Torah] expressed eating with a term of cooking, so that like if he cooked, he is lashed; he is also lashed for eating.\" And in the second [chapter] of Pesachim (Pesachim 21b), they said, \"Because of this did [the Torah] not write about eating meat with milk explicitly - to say that we give lashes for it even when [consumed] not according to the way of its enjoyment.\" And remember this. And here it is appropriate for me to note an important principle that I have not yet mentioned. And that is His saying, \"you shall not cook a kid in its mother's milk\" three times; and the Teachers have said that each one of the negative statements is for [specific] content: And they said (Chullin 115b), \"One is for eating, one is for cooking and one is for benefit.\" But the questioner will ask and say, \"For what reason did you count the prohibition of its eating and its cooking as two commandments, yet you do not count the prohibition of its benefit as a separate commandment?\" The questioner should know that it is inappropriate to count its benefit as a separate commandment, since it and its eating are the same matter. And His saying about something that is forbidden to eat is indeed one of several examples of benefit. But the intention is that he not benefit from it, not by eating and not by anything else. And that is their saying (Pesachim 21b), \"Wherever it is stated, 'You shall not eat'; 'It shall not be eaten' - both a prohibition of eating and a prohibition of benefit are implied; until the verse specifies that one may benefit, in the manner that it specified with regard to a carcass.\" As Scripture explained the use of that, and that is His saying, \"you may give it to the resident alien who is within your gates, that he may eat it\" (Deuteronomy 14:21). And according to this principle, it is inappropriate to count the prohibition of eating and benefit as two commandments. And if we had counted them [as] two commandments with meat with milk, it would have likewise been appropriate with chametz, with <i>orlah</i> (fruit of trees during their first three years) and with forbidden mixtures of the vineyard - that each one of them be two commandments - if the prohibition of benefit is its own commandment. But since these were not counted, but rather only the negative commandment of eating, alone, was counted - and the prohibition of benefit was included in this prohibition - the same should occur regarding meat with milk. And only one question remains about this. And that is that one could say, \"Since the prohibition of benefit ensues from the prohibition of eating, for what purpose did Scripture need a negative statement about meat and milk, to forbid its benefit, as we explained?\" Behold the answer to this is that it is needed regarding this because it is not written, \"Do not eat from this\" - from which eating and benefit would have been forbidden. Hence a negative statement to forbid benefit was required. And we have already mentioned the reason for which the eating of meat with milk was not mentioned: For anything about which it mentions eating is only liable when his throat derives enjoyment from it. However, if he open his mouth and swallows what is forbidden, or it is [so] hot as to burn his throat, he is exempt - except for meat with milk, about which one is liable for its eating even if he did not derive enjoyment from it, as we mentioned. And likewise [is the case with] forbidden mixtures of the vineyard, as we will explain after this (Sefer HaMitzvot, Negative Commandments 193). And understand all of these principles and remember them.  And the regulations of this commandment have already been explained in Chapter 8 of Chullin.

If so, since the gluttonous and drunk son under the specified conditions is sentenced to stoning, we know that the act is perforce prohibited to him - since the punishment was explicit.

For if one transgressed and took it, he is obligated to return it to the poor. And that is His saying, \"it shall be for the stranger, the orphan and the widow.\" And the regulations of this commandment have already been explained in Tractate Peah. And know that the principle with us is that any negative commandment that has a positive commandment [attached to it] - if he fulfills the positive commandment in it, he is not lashed; but if he does not fulfill it, he is lashed. An example of this is that if he harvested the corner, he is not liable for lashes immediately when he harvested. Rather he must return the sheaves. And likewise if he threshed them, ground the wheat and kneaded the dough, he must give what was fit for him for [his obligation of] the corner, from the dough. But if it happened that the wheat got totally lost or it was burnt, he is lashed - as he did not fulfill the positive commandment in it. And all the more so if he negated [the positive commandment] actively - as when he ate all of the wheat. But do not think that that which they said, in the Gemara, Makkot (Makkot 16a) - \"For us, we only have this and one other one,\" and it is explained that this other one is the corner - requires that this law is in fact only exclusively regarding the corner. Rather the matter of the \"other one,\" is meaning to say, the corner and everything, the law of which is like the law of the corner - the single grapes, what was forgotten, the gleanings and the <i>ollalot</i>. Each one of them is a negative commandment that is rectified by a positive commandment and has the possibility within it - that is possible with the corner - of 'he fulfilled it or he did not fulfill it,' and 'he nullified it or did not nullify it.' For the verse from which we learned that there is a positive commandment with the corner is His, may He be exalted, saying, \"you shall leave them for the poor and the stranger\" (Leviticus 19:9-10); and that appears about the corner, the gleanings, [the single grapes,] and the <i>ollalot</i>. He said [there], \"you shall not completely cut the corner of your field, [you shall not gather] the gleaning of your harvest. You shall not pick your vineyard bare; neither shall you gather the single grapes of your vineyard.\" And He likewise said about the forgotten sheave, \"you may not return to take it.\" And once we have found the language in the Gemara, that the corner is a negative commandment rectified by a positive commandment and they brought a proof about the positive commandment in it from His saying, \"you shall leave them for the poor and the stranger, etc.\" - it is a proof that these five commandments are [all] negative commandments that are rectified by a positive commandment. So - as we mentioned - as long as he fulfills the positive commandment in it, he is not lashed; but if the fulfillment of the positive commandment is no longer possible, he is lashed. However so long as it is possible to fulfill it - even though he has not fulfilled it - he is not yet lashed. Rather we only command him to fulfill it, until we know that he has already transgressed the negative commandment and there is no possible way for him to fulfill the positive commandment in it.

And it remains for us here to explain their saying (Bava Metzia 115a), \"And he is liable on account of two vessels, as it is stated, 'One shall not take as a pledge, a lower millstone nor an upper millstone.'\" For this may make us think that they are two commandments - and all the more so, with their saying (Bava Metzia 116a), \"And he is liable for the lower millstone on its own.\" And the content of this statement is that anyone who takes, as collateral, a vessel with which we make food of sustenance, transgresses a negative commandment, as it is explained; and one who takes several vessels - each one of which is used for food of sustenance - as collateral, is liable for each and every vessel. For example, if he takes as collateral, a tool for grinding, a tool for kneading and a tool for the making of bread.

However the question is about one who takes as a pledge, two vessels with which, both together, he makes food of sustenance: Do we say that since the [specific preparation of] food is in fact only finished by both of them, the two of them are surely one vessel, and he should [only] be liable on account of one vessel; or since they are two vessels, he should be liable for each one on its own? And they explained to us that he is liable with them on account of two vessels - even though the work is done by bringing the two of them together, like a lower millstone and an upper millstone, as the grinding will not be done by one [of them] alone.

If one transgressed - took it as collateral and grabbed it from him - they remove it from his hand and return it to its owners.

And that is why He took the example of the first of the relatives and the greatest love. And that is the love of a father for a child, and of a child for a father. And behold one will [then] say, since we do not accept the testimony of a father for the child, even to make him liable for the death penalty - is it not all the more so that other relatives will not be accepted? And this is a Scriptural decree (<i>gezerat hakatuv</i>) - it has no explanation in any way. And the regulations of this commandment have been explained in Chapter 3 of Sanhedrin.

                "That He prohibited the judge to declare punishments by way of strong conjectures, and even when it is almost certain. For example, that one man is running after his enemy to kill him; and in order to escape from him, he enters a house; but then the pursuer runs behind him. And others enter after him and find the pursued in death throes, while his enemy that was pursuing him is standing over him, the knife dripping blood in the hand -  the [court] may not kill him, from the angle of executing the punishment, since witnesses are not testifying that they saw the killing. And the prohibition about killing this one comes in the Torah; and that is His saying, \"do not kill an innocent righteous man\" (Exodus 23:7). And in the Mekhilta (Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 23:7:2), they said, \"If they saw him pursuing another to kill him, and they warned him and said to him, 'He is an Israelite, he is a Son of the Covenant; and if you kill him, you shall be killed.' But they averted their eyes, and  found [the one pursued] in the death throes, the knife dripping blood in the hand of the murderer - I might understand that he is liable [for the death penalty. Hence] we learn to say, 'do not kill an innocent righteous man.'\" And do not dismiss this and wonder about this law. For among possible things, there are things that are very likely, things very unlikely and things in between; so that there is a wide spectrum of what is possible. And if the Torah had permitted declaring capital punishments in very probable cases - when it is very close to actuality, like the case of our example - we would declare the punishment in that which is a little removed from this, and [eventually] also in that which is far removed. Until they would declare the punishments and kill people with a weak conjecture, according to the imagination of the judge and his thought. Therefore He, may He be exalted, closed this opening and said that he not declare the punishment until witnesses testify that they know with certainty that this one did the act - without a doubt and without any guesswork at all. And when we do not declare punishments based on strong appearances, the end result is surely that we will acquit the sinner. But if we declare punishments based on appearances and conjecture, we would surely sometimes kill someone innocent. And likewise when two witnesses testify to two sins, each of which has a death penalty. For example, one of the two saw him transgressing one [sin] alone, and the other saw him transgressing the other - behold, this one is not killed. And the example about this is such as if one testifies that he did work on Shabbat and warned him; and the other testified that he worshipped idolatry and warned him - this one is not stoned. They, may their memory be blessed, said, \"[If] one testified against him, 'He worshipped the sun,' and another testified against him, 'He worshipped the moon,' I might understand that they combine [to constitute the necessary two witnesses. Hence] we learn to say, 'do not kill an innocent righteous man.'\" (See Parashat Mishpatim; Mishneh Torah, The Sanhedrin and the Penalties within their Jurisdiction 20.)"

And that is His, may He be exalted, saying, \"but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die\" (Numbers 35:30). And the prohibition about this was repeated with His saying, \"at the mouth of one witness, he shall not be put to death\" (Deuteronomy 17:6) - meaning to say, he shall not be put to death from the claim of the witness. And in Sanhedrin (Sanhedrin 33b), they said, \"'But one witness shall not testify against any person' - whether to exonerate or to incriminate.\" And they explained [that] the reason for this is because it is as if he is predisposed towards his testimony.

And the explanation of this is that that which we mentioned in the commandment before this about saving the sinner, such that the witnesses not kill him before the court judges him - that is however when he sinned and did the act for which one is liable for the death penalty and completed it. However at the time that he is making efforts and seeking to do it, he is then called a pursuer - and it is an obligation upon us to prevent him from doing what his heart desires and to stop him, in order to prevent him from the sin. But if the does not want to listen to us, we fight against him: If we can prevent it by destroying one of his limbs - such as if we cut off his hand or his foot or blind his eye - behold that is preferable. But if it is impossible to prevent it without [killing him] - he must surely be killed, so that he does not do that evil act. So the prohibition comes [that we] not have compassion upon him and prevent ourselves from killing him. And that is His saying, \"You shall sever her hand; you are not to have compassion\" (Deuteronomy 25:12). And the language of the Sifrei (Sifrei Devarim 293:1) is, \"It teaches that you are obligated to rescue him with her hand. And from where [do we know] that if they are not able to rescue him with her hand, they rescue him with her soul (i.e., by killing her)? [Hence] we learn to say, 'you are not to have compassion.'\" And there, they said, \"Just like his genitals are specific in that they involve a danger to life - and it is with, 'You shall sever her hand'; so [too] is everything that involves a danger to life with, 'You shall sever.'\" And that which we said, that the pursuer is to be killed, is not regarding anyone making efforts to do a transgression. However it is the same whether it is one who is pursuing his fellow to kill him - even if he is a minor - or one who is pursuing one of the forbidden sexual prohibitions to have sexual relations. And [the latter] is on condition that he is nine [years] old and a day; and it is clear that a male is among the sexual prohibitions [for a man]. And His saying, \"the betrothed maiden cried out, but there was none to save her\" (Deuteronomy 22:27), [tells us]  - behold, if there was someone to save her, he must save her with everything he can. And He equated one pursuing her with one pursuing his fellow to kill him, with His saying, \"for, just as if a man rises up against his neighbor and murders him, so is this matter\" (Deuteronomy 22:26).

And in all of the Talmud and the Mishnah, they said, \"the <i>nessiim</i> and the heads of the court.\" And in their language (Sanhedrin 19b), \"'[In the case of] a <i>nassi</i> who forwent his honor, his honor is forgiven (it is effective); [of] a king who forwent his honor, his honor is not forgiven (it is not effective).\" And know that this negative commandment includes [the rabbinic] <i>nassi</i>, along with the king. For the content of this negative commandment is that it prohibits cursing anyone who has the power to command and is at the highest level - whether it is governmental or pertaining to Torah. And [the latter] is the head of the academy; and that is what is understood from the law of this commandment. And one who transgresses this negative commandment is lashed.

                "He prohibited us from cursing any Israelite person. And that is His saying, \"You shall not curse a deaf person\" (Leviticus 19:14). And understand the content of this, 'deaf person,' from me: And that is that when the spirit is moved to take revenge upon the injurer according to the nature of the imagined injury - behold it will not veer from its activity until the injurer is repaid according to the injury recorded by the imagination. And when his repayment is complete, the activity then departs from the imagination. So sometimes he will repay him only with a curse and disparagement, and his mind will be calmed by the measure of injury caused by those statements and by the disparagement. But sometimes the matter will be harsher, and the activity will not be stilled until he destroys [the offender's] property. Then his mind is calmed by the measure of pain caused to [the other] by the loss of his property. However sometimes the matter is [even] harsher, such that he will not be calmed until he takes revenge on [the other's] body with different injuries and the destruction of [his] limbs. And sometimes the matter will be harsher [still] and the [mental] activity will not cease until he takes the life of the injurer and his portion of existence; and that is the extreme. But sometimes the activity of the soul will be gentler than to seek the punishment of the injurer - due to the smallness of the crime - to the point that the activity will end with [just] yelling, anger and cursing [of the other], even though that other person does not hear [it] and is not present. And this is well-known about the actions of temperamental and angry people - that their minds are calmed from light offenses with this measure, even though the offender does not know of their anger and does not hear their disparagement. And perhaps we would have in our mind that the point of what is forbidden to us is the curse of an Israelite when he hears it, such that distress and pain come to him; but since a deaf person does not hear [it] and it does not hurt him, the curse would not be a sin. Hence Scripture is informing us that it is forbidden, and we are prohibited from [doing] it. For the Torah was not only concerned exclusively with the state of the one cursed, but also with that of the one cursing - in that it forbade him to move his soul towards vengeance, and that he not become accustomed to getting angry. And the masters of the tradition accordingly brought a proof about the cursing of any Israelite from His saying, \"You shall not curse a deaf person\": And the language of the Sifra (Sifra, Kedoshim, Section 2:13) is, \"I only know of a deaf person. From where [do we know] to include all people? [Hence] we learn to say, 'You shall not curse a <i>nassi</i> (elevated person) among your people' (Exodus 22:27). If so, why is it stated, 'a deaf person?' Just as a deaf person is distinctive in being alive [so too is it the case for anyone alive] - to exclude a dead man, who is not alive.\" And in the Mekhilta (Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 21:17:3): \"'You shall not curse a deaf person' - the most abject of people.\" And everything that we have said is on condition that it be with [God's] name. And one is also lashed when he curses himself. Behold it has already been explained that one who curses his fellow with [God's] name is transgressing a negative commandment - and that is, \"You shall not curse a deaf person.\" And one who curses a judge is transgressing two negative commandments, and is lashed twice. But one who curses a <i>nassi</i> is lashed three times. And the language of the Mekhilta (Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 22:27:2) is, \"When he says, 'You shall not curse a <i>nassi</i> among your people,' both a <i>nassi</i> and a judge are implied. So what do we learn to say [from], 'You shall not curse the powers (judges)' (Exodus 22:27)? To make liable for this on its own and for that on its own. From here, they said, 'One may speak one thing and be liable on account of four things. On account of, \"You shall not curse a deaf person,\" on account of the father, on account of a judge and on account of \"a <i>nassi</i> among your people,\" in any event.'\" Behold, what we mentioned has become clear. And the regulations of this commandment have been explained in the fourth [chapter] of Shevuot. (See Parashat Kedoshim; Mishneh Torah, The Sanhedrin and the Penalties within their Jurisdiction 26.) "

And even if he [only] cursed one of them with [God's] name after [the parent's] death, he is stoned. However the prohibition is not explicit in Scripture. For it does not say, \"You shall not curse your father.\" But it already preceded that a prohibition came about cursing every Israelite; and that includes a father and anyone besides him. And in the Mekhilta (Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 21:17:3), they said, \"'And if one curses his father or his mother, he shall surely die' - we have heard the punishment; from where [do we know] the prohibition?

It is the same for the man and for the woman.\" And this is not like, \"And to the wife of your kinsman\" - for that is a prohibition that does not include an adulterer and an adulteress, but is a prohibition for the adulterer alone. And likewise with the other sexual prohibitions. It was impossible that they not derive [the prohibition] also for the woman, from His saying, \"you (plural) shall not approach to uncover [their] nakedness\" (Leviticus 18:6): \"Behold there are two (it is plural)! To prohibit a man with a woman and a woman with a man\" (Sifra, Acharei Mot, Chapter 13:1). And in the Gemara, Sanhedrin (Sanhedrin 51b), they said, \"All [adulterers] were included in, 'The adulterer and the adulteress.' Scripture  singled out the daughter of a priest for burning, and the betrothed maiden for stoning.\" And the explanation of this matter has already been discussed in the introduction to this essay."

For it is not with the prohibition of males to have sexual intercourse with animals, that it is forbidden for a woman to have an animal have sexual intercourse with her - were it not for the specific prohibition about it. And at the beginning of Keritot (Keritot 2a), they said, \"There are 36 [sins punished] with excision in the Torah,\" and tallied them. And among them, they tallied a man having sexual intercourse with an animal, and an animal having sexual intercourse with a woman (separately) - even though it was grouping content together as negative commandments (and yet it does not group these two).

And the prohibition about this exact content has already been repeated with His saying, \"and there shall not be a male prostitute from the Children of Israel\" (Deuteronomy 23:18). And that is the correct approach - that this negative commandment is repeated to strengthen it; and not that it is a prohibition about the one who receives intercourse. Rather, we learn from His saying, \"You shall not lie,\" [both] about the one who lies and the one who is lain with. And in the Gemara, Sanhedrin (Sanhedrin 54b), it is explained that it is Rabbi Yishmael that positions, \"and there shall not be a male prostitute,\" as a prohibition for the one being lain with. Hence one who has sexual intercourse with a male and has a male have sexual intercourse with him in one forgetful spell, is liable for two [sin-offerings] according to the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael. But Rabbi Akiva says, \"It is not necessary. Behold, He says, 'And you shall not lie (<i>tishkav</i>) with a male.' Read into it, 'You shall not be lain with (<i>tishakhev</i>).'\" Hence one who has sexual intercourse with a male and has a male have sexual intercourse with him in one forgetful spell is only liable for one [sin-offering]. And they said about the reason for this, \"You shall not lie and you shall not be lain with are the same.\" However, \"and there shall not be a male prostitute,\" appears - according to my opinion - to strengthen [it]; like He said, \"you shall not commit adultery\" (Exodus 20:13), which is the prohibition of a married woman, as we explained, yet afterwards He said, \"And to the wife of your kinsman do not give your lying for seed\" (Leviticus 18:19). And there are many examples like this, as we explained in the Ninth Principle. And one who transgresses this negative commandment is liable for stoning; and if he is not stoned, he is surely [punished] with excision if he was volitional.

And they asked there, \"That is derived from, 'You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a woman' (Leviticus 18:22)!\" And they answered, \"[It is] to render him liable for two [sin-offerings].

And in the Gemara, Sanhedrin (Sanhedrin 54a), they said [that] everyone agrees that one who has sexual intercourse with his father's brother is liable for two [sin-offerings], as it is written, \"The nakedness of your father's brother you shall not uncover.\" And know that my saying [earlier concerning several commandments], \"the testimony has been ratified\" - is that there be two or more proper witnesses there that warn him, that [the testimony] be in a proper court of twenty-three [judges], that they give their testimony about them and that this be in a time when capital punishment is practiced. And it is clear about all of these sexual prohibitions that have been mentioned above, that excision appeared about them explicitly in the Torah. And that is His saying - after listing them - \"For anyone who will do any of these abominations, their souls shall be cut off, those who do these things\"  (Leviticus 18:29). And likewise, anything about which we mentioned that they are liable for death penalties of the court, is also written in the Torah. However the different death penalties - that we said about some of them, stoning; some of them, strangulation; and some of them, burning - some of them are a tradition and some of them are written in the Torah. And the laws of these sexual prohibitions have been explained in Tractate Sanhedrin and in Keritot. And it has already been explained in Keritot (Keritot 24b) that every sin for which one is liable for its volitional [transgression], excision; and for its inadvertent [transgression], a fixed sin-offering - one is liable for its uncertain [transgression], an uncertain guilt-offering. And the content of a fixed sin offering is that it only be from the beasts. And when you observe all of the negative commandments, one by one, and examine the punishment that is mentioned for each and every commandment, you will find that with every iniquity for which we are liable excision when volitional and a sin-offering when inadvertent - that that sin-offering is fixed, except for two sins. In each one of those, we are liable for excision when volitional, but a sin-offering which is not fixed - but rather variable - when inadvertent. And these two iniquities are the impurity of the Temple and the impurity of its consecrated items. What I mean when I say - \"impurity of the Temple,\" is an impure person who entered the [Temple] courtyard; and \"impurity of its consecrated items,\" is an impure person who ate a consecrated food. And it has also been made clear to you that every negative commandment for which we are liable excision when volitional, we are liable for a sin offering when inadvertent, except for one iniquity. And that is the one who blasphemes; as [although] his [punishment] is excision when volitional, it is not a sin-offering when inadvertent. And likewise has it been made clear to you that anyone who is liable for a death penalty of the court - whatever death penalty it may be - behold, that man is also [punished] with excision, when the court did not kill him or it it did not know about it - except for ten [cases in which] one is liable for a death penalty of the court, but they do not have excision [placed] upon them. And they are the inciter, the subverter, the false prophet, one who prophesies in the name of idolatry, a rebellious elder, a stubborn and rebellious son, one who steals (kidnaps) a Jewish soul, a murderer, one who hits his father and mother and one who curses his father and mother. And when the testimony for each one of these is ratified, he is killed. But if he is not killed - such that the court could not kill him or it was not known to it - behold [even though he has] made himself susceptible to a death penalty, he is not up for excision.

                "He prohibited approaching one of these forbidden sexual relations - even without intercourse - such as [with] hugging and kissing, and similar such licentious acts. And that is His saying about its prohibition, \"Each and every man - to any of his close kin - you shall not approach to uncover nakedness\" (Leviticus 18:6) - as if to say, do not make any approach that leads to uncovering nakedness (sexual intercourse). And the language of the Sifra (Sifra, Acharei Mot, Chapter 13:15) is, \"'You shall not approach to uncover nakedness' - I only know of nakedness. From where [do we know] not to approach? [Hence] we learn to say, 'To a woman, while in her menstrual impurity, you shall not approach to uncover her nakedness' (Leviticus 18:19). I only know about a menstruant, that she is [forbidden] with, do not approach and with, do not reveal. From where [do we know] about all of the sexual prohibitions, that they are [forbidden] with, do not approach and with, do not reveal? [Hence] we learn to say, 'you shall not approach to uncover.'\" And there (Sifra, Acharei Mot, Chapter 13:21), they said, \"'Their souls shall be cut off, those who do' (Leviticus 18:29) - what do we learn to say [from this]? Because it is stated, 'You shall not approach,' perhaps they would be liable for excision for approaching. [Hence] we learn to say, 'who do' - and not who approach.\" And the prohibition about these illusions was already repeated with His saying, \"that you shall not do any of the abominable customs\" (Leviticus 18:30). However His saying, \"After the practice of the Land of Egypt in which you have lived, you shall not do; and the practice of the Land of Canaan, to which I am bringing you, you shall not do,\" is not only prohibiting the abominable customs - but indeed also prohibiting the actual abominations that He explained after this. And that which He brings two general negative statements about all of the prohibited sexual relations - is because when He prohibited not doing like the practice of the Land of Egypt and the practice of the Land of Canaan, this includes the lewdness, [but it also includes] the work of the land, the shepherding of animals and the settlement of the land as well. So He came back to explain that the actions that He prohibited [originally] were such and such sexual prohibitions that one should not uncover - and it is as He explained at the end of the [section], when He said, \"For all of these abominations were done by the people of the land\" (Leviticus 18:27). And the language of the [Sifra] (Sifra, Acharei Mot, Section 8:8) is, \"Perhaps they should not build houses or plant vineyards like them. [Hence] we learn to say, 'and in their statutes (<i>chukoteichem</i>) you shall not walk' - only those statutes (<i>chukim</i>) which were instituted (<i>chakukim</i>) for them and for their forefathers.\" And there, they said, \"What did they do? A man would wed a man, and a woman, a woman; and a woman would wed two men.\" Behold it has been made clear that these two negative commandments - being, \"After the practice of the Land of Egypt [...] and the practice of the Land of Canaan [...] you shall not do\" - are general commandments, being the prohibition of all of the sexual prohibitions (hence they not counted in the tally of the commandments). And afterwards, He repeated the prohibition of each sexual prohibition individually. And we ourselves have explained the regulations of these commandments in the seventh [chapter] of Sanhedrin in our great composition (Commentary on the Mishnah), and we explained that we are lashed for it. And it is from that which is fit for you to know that [in the case of] any woman for whom we would be liable excision, the [child] born from that intercourse is called a <i>mamzer</i>. And it is God, may He be exalted, who called him a <i>mamzer</i> (Deuteronomy 23:3). Whether that intercourse is volitional or whether it was inadvertent, the embryo is a <i>mamzer</i> - except specifically for the menstruant. One born from her is not a <i>mamzer</i>; however it is called the child of a menstruant. And this has already been explained in the fourth [chapter] of Yevamot.

And the language of the [Sifra] (Sifra, Kedoshim, Chapter 7:2) is, \"'Do not profane your daughter to make her a harlot' - that is one who gives over his single daughter, not for the sake of marriage; and, similarly, her giving herself over, not for the sake of marriage.\" And listen to me [as to] why this negative commandment was repeated with this language, and what content was added with it: And that is that He already preceded that one that has sexual intercourse with a virgin - whether it was seduction or whether it was rape - is not liable for any of the punishments, but rather for a monetary fine and to [have to] marry her, as is explained in Scripture. So it would enter our thoughts that since there is only a monetary fine, its law is like any monetary matter. So just like a person has the right to give his money to his fellow as he wants, and exempt him from [returning] anything that he has with him; it would likewise be permissible for him to take his maiden daughter and give her to a man for him to have sexual intercourse, and then exempt him from it - meaning to say, the fifty [measures of] silver which go to the father - given that this is one of his rights; or to also give her to him, on condition that he receive such and such dinars from him. That is why He prohibited this and said, \"Do not profane your daughter to make her a harlot.\" For that which I judged to only punish him with money is in fact [only] when it happens that a man seduces her or rapes her. But that the matter be with the mutual consent of both of them and permissible, there is no way [for such a] thing! And the proof for this explanation is His saying [in the continuation of the verse], \"lest the land fall into harlotry, and the land be filled with lewdness.\" For seduction and rape only occur a little, but if the matter were to be by choice and permissible, it would grow and spread in the land. And this explanation is very fine and praiseworthy regarding this verse; and it is fitting regarding all that the Sages mentioned and all that is in accordance with Torah laws.
