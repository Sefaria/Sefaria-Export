            "And now I am going to begin mentioning every single mitzvah, and I will explain them, as I made clear at the beginning that this is the intention of the book. ... I will also explain the punishments for not doing a mitzvah or for a transgression ... And every one of those negative commandments for which we do not count a punishment among the punishments, you should know that that is like the mitzvah of a king, that for one that transgresses it we have no punishment in record. Even though for positive commandments in which one is obligated we have that one receives lashes if one refrains from observing them until that person either dies or does it, in any instance if the time is passed we refrain from doing [such punishment], like for instance a person during Sukkot who did not dwell in a sukkah, we do not lash such person due to his/her transgression, and you should know this. And I also announced the mitzvot in which women are not obligated, whether positive or negative... in several mitzvot I do not need to explain to you that they are not obligated, such as the mitzvot that deal with the temple or optional wars, because those are wordy add-ons that are superfluous, and this is also the case regarding mitzvot that only apply in the Land of Israel or when the Temple is standing. It is known that sacrifices are not done outside of the Temple area, and so too capital punishments are not judged unless the Temple is standing. And in the language of the Mechilta:  \"from where do we know that we do not sentence to death unless in front of the Temple? The text says: 'from My altar you will take him to die' (Exodus 21:14) - behold, if you have the Temple you make him die, if you don't have the Temple you don't.\" And there too it says \"from where do we know that the Sanhedrin needs to be close to the altar? From what is said: 'from My altar'.\" And it is known that both prophecy and kingship have been taken away from us until we refrain from our constant sins, and then He will be forgiving to us, and will merciful to us, as we have testimony regarding prophecy: \"And it will be, after I pour My spirit on all flesh, your sons and your daughters will prophesy\" (Joel 2:28). And regarding the return of the kingship: \"On that day I will restore the fallen sukkah of David, and I will repair its breaches and set up its ruins anew, I will build it firm as in the days of old\" (Amos 9:11). And it is known that war and conquering of the cities cannot happen without a king and without the advice of the Great Sanhedrin and without a High Priest, as it says \"he [Joshua] shall present himself in front of Eleazar the Priest [who shall on his behalf seek the decision of the Urim]\" (Numbers 27:21). And therefore it should be announced for all people that all positive commandments that are dependent on sacrifices, Temple rituals, capital punishments, Sanhedrin, prophet and king, or optional wars one does not have to say that there is no obligation regarding those unless the Temple is standing, as we explained, may we be sufficient, and rouse ourselves for it, with God's help. And now I will begin the mentioning of each and every mitzvah with the help of Shaddai."

                "The 3rd mitzva is that we are commanded to love G‑d (exalted be He), i.e. to meditate upon and closely examine His mitzvos, His commandments, and His works, in order to understand Him; and through this understanding to achieve a feeling of ecstasy. This is the goal of the commandment to love G‑d. [We can see that meditation is the way to create this feeling of love1 from] the Sifri: \"From the statement, 'You shall love G‑d your Lord'2, can I know how to love G‑d? The Torah therefore says, 'and these words which I command you today shall be upon your heart'3; i.e. that through this [meditation about His commandments] you will understand the nature of 'the One Who spoke, and thereby brought the world into being.' \"From this it is clear that meditation will lead to understanding, and then a feeling of enjoyment and love will follow automatically [since the second verse explains the way to reach the goal of the previous verse.]Our Sages also said that this mitzvah includes calling out to all mankind to serve G‑d (exalted be He) and to believe in Him. This is because when you love a person, for example, you praise him and call out to others to draw close to him. So too, if you truly love G‑d — through your understanding and realization of His true existence — you will certainly spread this true knowledge that you know to the ignorant and the foolish.[We see that this mitzvah includes spreading love for G‑d to others from] the Sifri: \" 'You shall love G‑d,' i.e. make Him beloved among the creatures as your father Avraham did, as it is written, 'The souls that he made in Charan.'4\"The meaning of this Sifri: Avraham, as a result of his deep understanding of G‑d, acquired love for G‑d, as the verse testifies, \"Avraham, who loved Me\"5. This powerful love therefore caused him to call out to all mankind to believe in G‑d. So too, you shall love Him to the extent that you draw others to Him."

                "The 5th mitzvah is that we are commanded to serve G‑d (blessed be He). This commandment is repeated twice. It is stated:\"And you shall serve G‑d, your L‑rd\"(Exodus 23:25). And it is also stated: \"And you shall serve Him\"(Deuteronomy 13:5). Although this commandment is of a general nature, as explained in the Fourth Principle, [and apparently should not be included in the count of the 613 mitzvos,] nevertheless it has a specific quality, since it is the commandment to pray. [We see that \"service\" is not just a general command from the following statements:] The Sifri says, \"The verse, 'And to serve Him' means prayer.\" The Sages also said, \"The verse, 'And to serve Him' means Torah study. In the Mishnah of Rabbi Eliezer, the son of Rabbi Yosi HaG'lili, the Sages said, \"What is the biblical source to include prayer among the mitzvos? From the verse, 'You shall fear G‑d, your L‑rd, and you shall serve Him.' \" They also said, \"Serve Him through His Torah; serve Him in His Temple.\" This [statement, 'serve Him in His Temple,'] means that one's goal should be to pray in the Temple or in the direction of the Temple, as King Solomon, peace be upon him, explained."

And in the Tosefta is states \"just as when the torah was given the reading of the shema was established, so too  the sages established times for prayer\", this means to say that the times for prayer are not biblical, rather the obligation of prayer itself is biblical, as we explained, and the sages, may their memory be a blessing, organized times for them. And this is the concept that was stated (TB Berakhot 26b) \"The prayers were established according to the Tamid offerings\", which means to say that they established times [for prayer] according to the times for the sacrifices. And women are not obligated in this commandment. (Parshat Va'etchanan; Rambam Sefer Ahava, Hilchot Keriat Shema Chapter 1)."

And this commandment completely includes all of the sacrifices. And there is a proof that it is not accepted before then from His saying, \"and from the eighth day, it will be accepted as a burnt-sacrifice to the Lord\" (Leviticus 22:27). Behold the prohibition of offering that which is lacking time has already been demonstrated. However it is a negative commandment derived from a positive commandment. Hence we do not give lashes for it. So one who sacrifices [an animal] which is lacking time does not receive lashes, as it is explained in the chapter [entitled] <i>Oto ve'et Beno</i> (Chullin 80b). And there, it is said, \"Leave that which is lacking time, as Scripture rectified it by a positive commandment.\" And the regulations of this commandment have already been explained in the Sifrei and at the end of Tractate Zevachim.

These four processes - meaning the process of the burnt-offering, the sin-offering, the guilt-offering and the peace offerings - are all the processes of sacrifices. For all animal sacrifices that are sacrificed by an individual or the community are perforce one of these four types. However the guilt-offering is exceptional, in that it is always the sacrifice of an individual - as we have explained many times. And Tractate [Zevachim] also includes the laws of these four commandments, and those things which are connected to them by being similar to them in terms of obligation and exemption; the corrupted process and the one that goes smoothly.

[In these cases,] he is obligated to offer a sacrifice for his sin, and it is not a sin-offering sacrifice; indeed, it is a guilt-offering, and it is called a definite guilt-offering.

And that is one who is impure from one of the primary sources of impurity - as we set out in the introduction to the Order of Purities (Commentary on the Mishnah) - and entered the Temple or ate sanctified [food] inadvertently; and that is impurification of the Temple and its sanctified objects. Or that he swore falsely, as with an oath of speech that he inadvertently transgressed; or if he swore falsely with an oath of testimony - whether inadvertently or volitionally.

Or if a person swear, speaking with his lips [...] And it shall be, when he shall be guilty [...]. And he shall bring his guilt offering [...]. But if his means do not suffice\" (Leviticus 5:1-7).

Everything is according to what the means of the sinner, who is obligated to offer the sacrifice, suffice.

One might think that one could admonish him to the point that his facial features change — the verse therefore continues, \"And not bear sin because of him.\" Our Sages explained that this commandment is incumbent on every individual; even a person on a low level to someone on a higher level. Even if one is cursed or insulted he should not desist, nor stop admonishing unless he is struck physically, as explained by our Sages from the Oral Torah, \"[One must reprimand] until one receives physical blows.\" This mitzvah has conditions and laws which are explained in various places in the Talmud."

            "And you should know that, that which we said, [that] their regulations are in place x - our intentions was not that in that chapter or that tractate would be included all of the regulations of that commandment, to the point that no question would remain. Rather I am mentioning  the place in which there is the main law of the commandment and most of its regulations. However there will be many questions to the regulations of that commandment that are scattered in many places in the Talmud, but I will not mention their places now. And when you now examine all of these commandments that are previously mentioned, you will find among them commandments that are an obligation on the community - not on each and every individual - like the building of the choice [Temple], the establishment of a king and the cutting off of the seed of Amalek. And there are [also] among them, commandments that are obligatory on an individual if he did a certain act or something happens to him. "

And it is clear that by our saying, idol, we mean anything worshipped besides God. And the intention is not only bowing and nothing else. Indeed, He mentioned one of the ways of worship - meaning to say, bowing - but we are also prohibited from sacrificing to them, to offer libations and to burn incense [to them]. And one who has transgressed one of these and bowed, sacrificed, offered libation or burned incense is liable for stoning. And the language of the Mekhilta (Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 22:19) is, \"'Whoever sacrifices to gods shall be proscribed' - we have [thus] heard the punishment. From where [do we know] the prohibition? [Hence] we learn to say, 'You shall not bow to them and you shall not worship them.' Sacrifice was included (in serving), and it was singled out to teach [that] just as sacrificing is distinctive in that we serve the Heavens in a similar way and one is liable for it, whether he worships it or he does not not worship it - so too, one is liable for all the ways that are similar to how we serve the Heavens, whether he worships it or he does not not worship it.\" And it has already been explained in the Gemara, Makkot (Makkot 23b) that this negative commandment is included in the 613 commandments.

                "That He prohibited the priests from eating firstfruits outside [of Jerusalem]. And that is His, may He be exalted, saying, \"You may not, etc. and the tithe of your hand\" (Deuteronomy 12:17) - that is the firstfruits. For He did not leave anything that requires being brought to a place in this verse that was not mentioned in the explanation. And among them, He mentioned, \"and the tithe (<i>terumah</i>) of your hand\" (Deuteronomy 12:17) - without a doubt, that is the firstfruits. Indeed, it is known that the priestly tithe (<i>terumah</i>) does not require bringing to a place - how would one be careful from eating it \"in your cities?\" And the language of the Sifrei (Sifrei Devarim 72:9) is, \"The verse only came about one who eats firstfruits who has not recited the declaration over them, that he transgresses a negative commandment.\" And it has already been explained at the end of Makkot (Makkot 19a) that we we are only liable for them before he has placed them in the [Temple] courtyard. But once he has placed them in the courtyard, one is exempt for them, even though he has not recited [the declaration]. And the condition that there is with the second tithe also exists with firstfruits - meaning to say, that one is not liable for them when he eats them outside until they see the presence of the Temple. But when someone ate them outside after they saw the presence of the Temple before they are placed in the courtyard, he is lashed only if he is a priest. However an Israelite who eats firstfruits - even after the declaration - is liable for death at the hands of the Heavens. And in the second [chapter] of Bikkurim, (Bikkurim 2:1), [they] said, \"For the priestly tithe and for firstfruits, one is liable for death, and a fifth; and they are forbidden to outsiders.\" So if an outsider eats them: If he was volitional, he is liable for death; and if inadvertent, he adds a fifth - exactly like the law of the priestly tithe. For since Scripture called them, \"the tithe of your hand,\" it becomes liable to the laws of the priestly tithe. And it is appropriate for you to understand this properly until you will not get it confused: And that is that the when the priests eats firstfruits from when they have seen the presence of the Temple before they they have been placed in the courtyard, he is lashed; and its prohibition is from here - \"You may not eat in your cities, etc. and the tithe of your hand,\" as is explained in Makkot (Makkot 17). [This is] like an Israelite concerning the second tithe, about which one is lashed for eating it outside of its place, even though it is his. Nevertheless, when an Israelite eats firstfruits after they have seen the presence of the Temple, he is liable for death anytime he eats them. And its prohibition is from, \"And no outsider shall eat of the consecrated food (<i>kodesh</i>)\" (Leviticus 22:10), as we explained in Commandment 133 of these (negative) commandments.

                "He prohibited us from being gluttonous and drunk with food and drink in the days of youth and under the conditions of the law of the stubborn and rebellious [son]. And that is His saying, \"'You shall not eat with the blood\" (Leviticus 19:26). And the explanation of this is that a stubborn and rebellious son is included in [those things] that are liable for a death penalty of the court; and the language of the Torah about it (Deuteronomy 21:21) is that it is [punished] with stoning. And it has already been explained at the introduction of this essay (Sefer HaMitzvot Shoreshim 14) that anything for which one is liable for excision or a death penalty of the court is a negative commandment, except for the Pesach-sacrifice and circumcision - as we explained. If so, since the gluttonous and drunk son under the specified conditions is sentenced to stoning, we know that the act is perforce prohibited to him - since the punishment was explicit. Hence we must search for the prohibition, since Scripture did not punish [for something] unless it prohibited [it]. And the language of the Gemara, Sanhedrin (Sanhedrin 63a), is, \"From where [do we know] the prohibition of a stubborn and rebellious son? [Hence] we learn to say, 'You shall not eat with the blood'\" - meaning to say, do not eat an eating that brings about the spilling of blood; and that is the eating of  a stubborn and rebellious son, as he is liable for death because of it. And when he eats this bad eating in those not good ways, he has already transgressed the negative commandment - even thought this is a general negative commandment, as we explained in the ninth principle. For this is not difficult: Since the punishment is explicit, we do not concern ourselves whether the prohibition is bona fide or whether it is from a general negative commandment. And the regulations of this commandment have already been explained in Chapter 8 of Sanhedrin. (See Parashat Kedoshim; Mishneh Torah, Rebels 7.)"

And that is His, may He be blessed, saying, \"The nakedness of your father's sister you shall not uncover\" (Leviticus 18:12). And one who transgresses this negative commandment volitionally is [punished] by excision. But [if] inadvertent, he must bring a fixed sin-offering."

                "He prohibited - to not have sexual intercourse with the father's brother. And that is His, may He be exalted, saying, \"The nakedness of your father's brother you shall not uncover\" (Leviticus 18:14) -  such that one who is inadvertent with his father's brother with his father is liable for two sins-offerings, as we explained with his father. And in the Gemara, Sanhedrin (Sanhedrin 54a), they said [that] everyone agrees that one who has sexual intercourse with his father's brother is liable for two [sin-offerings], as it is written, \"The nakedness of your father's brother you shall not uncover.\" And know that my saying, \"the testimony has been ratified,\" is that there be two or more proper witnesses there that warn him and [the testimony] be in a proper court of twenty-three [judges] and they give their testimony about thiem, and that this be in a time when capital punishment is being practiced. And it is clear about all of these sexual prohibitions that have been mentioned above, that excision appeared about them explicitly in the Torah. And that is His saying, after listing them, \"For anyone who will do any of these abominations, their souls shall be cut off, those who do these things\"  (Leviticus 18:29). And likewise anything about which we mentioned about them, that they are liable for death penalties of the court is also written in the Torah. However the different death penalties - that we should about some of them, stoning, and some of them, strangulation, and some of them, burning - some of them are a tradition and some of them are written in the Torah. And the laws of these sexual prohibitions have been explained in Tractate Sanhedrin and in Keritot."
