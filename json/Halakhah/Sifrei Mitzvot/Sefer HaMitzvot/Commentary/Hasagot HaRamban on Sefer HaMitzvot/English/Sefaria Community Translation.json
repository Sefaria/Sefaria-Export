I shall explicate their methods and assess their worth. But if my thoughts cannot abide them, I shall humbly take issue with them, and judge as my eyes are given to see, with the clear legal vision given to me. I shall not show favoritism to received teaching. For God grants wisdom in all ages and days, and withholds not grace from those who walk in God's ways. "

                "We were commanded when we besiege a city, to eat from the tree upon its borders all the days of the siege. And if we cut them for no reason in the way of destructiveness, we would transgress a positive commandment, on top of the explicit negative commandment about it. And He, may He be elevated, stated it, \"as you may eat from it\" - [as] a positive commandment - \"but you may not cut it down\" - [as] a negative commandment. And it is fitting for [Rambam] to count also this, according to his calculation of the commandments. And you should know that this commandment - in both its positive and its negative [forms] - is when we besiege the city to fight against it, to snatch it. As we were commanded to be concerned about it the way we would be concerned about our own, [since] perhaps we will conquer it. But upon our leaving the land of the enemy, we destroy and wreck every good tree. Likewise during the days of the siege, it is permitted to hurt the people of the city by the destruction of the trees so that they will not live off of them. The Torah only forbade its destruction for no reason..."
