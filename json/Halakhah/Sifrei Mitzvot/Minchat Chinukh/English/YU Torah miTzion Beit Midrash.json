                    "A person does not fulfill the commandment until the Torah is written in ‎accordance with the laws of a Sefer Torah. If there is a disqualification, even a missing or extra ‎letter, then a person does not fulfill this mitzvah, for it is not a Sefer Torah at all. The gemara ‎‎(Menachot 30a) asks, \"Could a Torah be missing a letter? It is written(Devarim 31:26), 'Take this ‎Sefer Torah'!\" The Rambam (Hilchot Tefillin, Mezuzahv'Sefer Torah 7:11) lists disqualifications and ‎says, \"It does not have the status of a Sefer Torah, only as a chumash from which they teach ‎children.\" The Ran (Megilah) also writes that a person does not fulfill the mitzvah of writing a sefer ‎Torah with [a Torah that is] missing a letter. According to this, we cannot fulfill the mitzvah, for the ‎gemara (Kiddushin 30)explains that previous generations were expert in which letters to exclude ‎and which to include, but we are not expert. Therefore, we who are not expert might include a ‎letter in a word that should be written without it, or the reverse, and consequently we would not ‎fulfill the mitzvah [of writing a Torah] at all. The Shaagat Aryeh (36) has already suggested that we ‎might be exempt from this mitzvah today because we are not expert in missing and extra letters. ‎We can suggest that we are expert in the four chapters of the tefillin, for if this were not so, then ‎we could not fulfill the mitzvah of tefillin. We must say that since tefillin area constant mitzvah and ‎only include four‏ ‏paragraphs, we did not forget how to write‏ ‏it. As to the entire Torah, we are not ‎expert.‎‏ ‏Nonetheless, this remains difficult; writing a Torah is also a mitzvah, so how could people‏ ‏have failed to set their hearts against‏ ‏forgetting it?... How could the proper writing‏ ‏of the Torah ‎have been forgotten in the days‏ ‏of the Amoraim [recorders of the gemara]?‎‏ ‏In my humble ‎opinion, the explanation is‏ ‏that there are two types of missing or extra‏ ‏letters. One type involves a ‎missing or extra‏ ‏letter which changes the meaning of the‏ ‏word, or has the potential to change the‏ ‏meaning, like the examples cited in the‏ ‏gemara (Sanhedrin 4a)... According to theone who says ‎that we translate based on the‏ ‏word as it is written, a word which has an‏ ‏extra letter or is missing a ‎letter changes the‏ ‏message of G-d, for many laws will be‏ ‏altered from their true status. Even‏ ‏according to the opinion that we translate‏ ‏based on the word as it is pronounced, so‏ ‏that should ‎law does not change [based‏ ‏upon our incorrect writing], the Torah‏ ‏must still be written as it was ‎given. Therefore, when a Torah is missing a‏ ‏letter, since the Torah was given to us to‏ ‏be written ‎thus and not the way the word is pronounced [this change will disqualify ‎‏ ‏the Sefer Torah]… ‎However, other‏ ‏missing or extra letters do not change the‏ ‏meaning of the word…‎‏ ‏Certainly, the ‎first type of letters [i.e. the‏ ‏letters that would change the meaning of a word] were not forgotten… ‎but the‏ ‏missing or extra letters that would not‏ ‏change the meaning or cause harm by their absence ‎or inclusion were not‏ ‏known… and these letters, which do not‏ ‏change anything, do not harm this‏ ‏mitzvah and a person fulfills entirely the‏ ‏mitzvah to write a Torah with this act of writing… G-d ‎forbid that the Jewish‏ ‏people could not fulfill a biblical mitzvah‏ ‏for many generations.‎"
