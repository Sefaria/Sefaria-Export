            "Before the night of the fourteenth it is necessary to visit all the rooms and houses in the courtyard, and also a woman should thoroughly inspect all the all the clothes, in their pockets; perhaps they put chametz in them, and even if there is a doubt she needs to check and see. And then at the beginning of the night of the fourteenth we check for chametz with the light of the candle after the stars come out, immediately and right away. And he should do netilat yadayim before saying the berakhah on the bedikah, as mentioned by the acharonim z\"l.", 
            "It is necessary to check with the light of a candle made of wax, and he should not bring two that are large or stuck together, for it would be like an avukah/torch, and we do not check with the light of a torch. And the lamps that we do not check with were given a mnemonic, חשש\"א/chashasha, meaning simply, chelev/suet, shuman/oil, avukah/torch; and see [the book] מל\"ח. And the candles that presently come from European cities are made from suet, so we do not check with them. "
