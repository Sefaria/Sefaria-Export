            "Rabbi Shimon gave this introduction, saying (Zohar Vol. 3, daf 166b): \"<i>Ayelet ahavim ve'ya'alat chen, dadeiha yeravukha bekhol 'et; be'ahavatah tishgeh tamid</i>/A lovely ewe and a graceful she-ibex, let her teats satisfy you at all times; with her love be involved (to the [partial] neglect of other matters) always.

From you is everything, by you the upper and lower [worlds] are sustained. His upper light goes out from you. Oraita! Oraita! what shall I say of you, <i>ayelet ahavim ve'ya`alat chen</i>, above and below are your mercies, whoever merits to acquire from you in the proper fashion. Oraita! Oraita! The delights of those who master you! Who can reveal and tell your secret and hidden things!",
            "Master of Universe, let it be Your will to give strength and power to me and to all Yisrael, and let us enter in without shame before you and before the <i>Matronita `Ila'ah</i> (Higher Divine Presence), of which it is said, \"<i>em-habanim smechah</i>/as joyful as a mother of children\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ps. 113</i>. And let us not be in shame before the <i>Barta DiMalka</i> (Lower Divine Presence), of which it is said, \"<i>kol kevudah bat melekh penimah</i>/all honor [shall be] for the King's daughter (His entourage) who is within (i.e. humble),\" and of which it is said, \"<i>Rabot banot `asu chayil, ve'at `alit `al kulanah</i>/Many women have acquired riches, but you surpass them all\" (Prov. 31).",

            "Blessed are You Hashem, Our God King of the Universe, Who has sanctified us with his commandments and commanded us regarding <i>divrei</i>/words/matters of Torah. Now please make sweet, Hashem our God, the dirvei of Your Torah in our mouths, and in the mouths of Your people Yisrael.

            "Blessed is our God who has created us for His glory, and separated us from those who err, and given us the Torah of truth, and planted eternal life among us, \"<i>Mah ashiv laShem kol tagmuluhi `alai</i>/How can I return to Hashem all his benevolences toward me?\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ps. 116</i>, Who has permitted me in His great mercies and great compassions, to serve in the \"courtyards of the Temple of Hashem,\" in the place that our holy forefathers served, <i>nishmatam eden</i>/their souls in Paradise, in the permanent dwelling each and every Shabbat, when the children of Yisrael assemble there, to expound to them holy scriptures, which they read on their Shabbatot each parashah in its time, as its arrangement and order is given; <i>zot chuqat hatorah</i>/This is the statute of the Torah. Also including <i>drashahs</i> of the Haftarah readings, though my original [work] was review of the Torah, and as Hashem Yitbarakh graced me in His great compassion, to some produce <i>chidushim</i>/novel words by the way of <i>peshat</i> [basic explanation of the scripture] or <i>derash</i> [mystical explanation] or the <b>crown</b> of <i>remez</i>, I recorded the chidushim for reminder. And already in the year 5624 I printed from my chidushim with the help of Heaven a book small in quantity, on the Pentateuch, and I named it <i>Aderet Eliyahu</i> (the cape of Eliyahu<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Kings 2</i>), and behold, from that time until now, praise to El Yitbarakh, the chidushei Torah increased from what Hashem bestowed to me, and because we have heard an admonition from the mouth of scribes and from the mouth of <i>sefarim</i>/holy books that a man is obligated to print his sefarim in his lifetime, I awakened myself to bring to the printhouse chidushei Torah in the way of drash and remez on the Pentateuch, because I reasoned that it is proper to advance this before other chidushei Torah, because it is food for every man, and it is a staple for every soul, and benefits the masses a bit more, but because the printing expenses were great, and I have not the financial means, I was forced to bring to print at this time only a little of my produce, one quarter of what I have by the grace of `El Eylon, and if Hashem Yitbarakh desires He will help me bring what remains with me in a separate book, because that which remains has a great quantity, and furthermore has also the chidushei Torah that I darshened on the verses of the Haftarot of the whole year; I have not brought one of the here, because due to their great quantity they are fit to be a large sefer by themselves, if Hashem helps.",
            "Nonetheless I interlaced settled <i>halakhot</i>/laws of conduct throughout this collection, from all kinds of halakhot that are brought in the Shulchan Arukh \"Orach Chayim\" and \"Yoreh De`ah,\" because I was already accustomed to publicly lecture also one these each and every Shabbat, because I immersed myself in the sefarim and enlightened my eyes with the words of our Sages of blessed memory, and I knew that the ancient way of our Rabbis the Rishonim [or \"our early Rabbis\"] z\"l who would lecture to the people every Shabbat, that they would not make a constant [study] only on <i>aggada</i>/homily in the Midrashim and <i>peshatim</i>, but rather they also lectured them halakhot to let them know the statutes of God and His Torahs/instructions, to know the way they should go, and the things they should do, because likewise we find in the Gemara in Sanhedrin (daf 38), \"Said Rabbi Yochanan, 'When Rabbi Meir would lecture on his piece, he would say one-third legal decisions, one-third aggada, one-third parables,'\" see there. And likewise we find in our Rabbis z\"l in Mekhilta, they bring the words of Rabbeinu Maharam Alshich z\"l, at the beginning of <i>parashat</i>/the Torah portion Vayakhel, that Moshe Rabbeinu the servant of Hashem taught the children of Yisrael that they should gather on Shabbatot, to lecture to them the laws of Shabbat and His Torahs, see there. And likewise they said the same in the Gemara, \"Moshe ordained for Yisrael, to teach the laws of Pesach at Pesach [time], laws of Atzeret at Atzeret [time], laws of the [Sukkot] Festival at Sukkot [time], and such is the report from several devotees in the Gemara, that their custom was to teach halakhot each and every Shabbat, and truthfully logical reasoning also requires this, to teach halakhot to the people, to know what Yisrael should do in the mitzvot of Hashem, and see Pri Chadash in Yoreh De`ah hilkhot Tol`ayim [laws regarding prohibition of eating worms], siman 84, that he wrote, verbatim, \"And it is necessary to inspire and teach these matters to the people more that teaching them peshatim,\" end of quote.",
            "Actually it is a known thing that to lecture on halakhot alone, the heart of the masses is not drawn after this, rather it is necessary to make the derash the root and most of it words of agadda and <i>mussar</i>/ethical teaching, and the lecturer should also mention in the middle the decided halakhot, through the tie that that he ties in the lecture that he says on the text, in order to draw the hearts of the people to these things in <i>chokhmah</i>/wisdom and <i>da`at</i>/knowledge, and this was the intention of our master the Tanna Rabbi Meir a\"h, who wuold lecture a third in halakhot, a third in aggadot and a third in <i>mashalim</i>/allegories in order to draw the heart of the masses to hear the halakhot via two thirds of aggada and mashalim, and it seems to me the mashalim were in the manner of mussar, and so will you find in Shabbat daf 30: The question was asked of Rabbi Tanchum, \"What does it mean to extinguish a lamp for a sick person on Shabbat?\" And he opened with this introduction and said first some long words of aggada, and afterwards at the end of his words he gave them a short answer on the legal question mentioned, and Rashi z\"l explains there, so were they accustomed to give an introduction with aggada first, in order to draw the hearts of the audience to hear the halakhah.",
            "And likewise we find in the Gemara of Sotah daf 40: Rabbi Abbahu and Rabbi Chiya bar Abba happened uppon that place. Rabbi Chiya bar Abba spoke about halakhic decisions, and Rabbi Abbahu told aggada. Everybody abandoned Rabbi Chiya bar Abba, and came before Rabbi Abbahu. Rabbi Chiya was downcast. Rabbi Abahu said to him, \"I will tell you a parable what this is like. To two men who come to a city, one selling gems and jewels, and one selling tinsel. Who do they jump to? Not to the one who sells tinsel!\" See there. Hence the world chases after homiletics and peshatim, therefore you must proceed wisely according to the minds of people, namely to make most of the lecture in aggada and explanation of the scripture, and the lesser part words of halakhah absorbed into it in the middle or in the end, and this is the proper way.",
            "Therefore I, the young one, after the year 5630, it came to my heart to mention in the lecture on the parashah that I am publicly speaking each Shabbat, some halakhot from matters mentioned in the Orach Chayim and Yoreh De`ah, and I would tie the beginnings of the halakhot with the lecture on the Torah, and after the halakhot I would end the lecture with verses of the Haftarah. However it was not possible to finish all the halakhot that I decided to teach on every Shabbat in one year, rather they needed a length of two years, as they are organized in the eyes of the reader in the second part of this book, and every two years they are to be repeated, and therefore I made the halakhot with their ties in separate parts, Part One and Part Two, and brought them to the printhouse to join them with the lectures that are in this book, so that the eyes of the Tzadikim should see straight [ways]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ps. 17:2</i>, and also in the halakhot I mentioned I omitted for now several halakhot from the first part and the second part, due to the expense of printing, and if Hashem helps, in the halakhot part too there will be a later edition, and they will come in a separate book.",
            "And behold since I named my book on Talmud discourses <b>\" Ben Yehoyada\"</b> -- which I have not yet printed but only on two tractates -- and Hashem Yitbarakh allow me to print all of it for good life and peace -- I chose to call this book <b>\"Ben Ish Chai\"</b>. And Hashem Yitbarakh help me to print the rest of the books which He has graced me in His great compassion and great kindness. And the name of the man who donated money for printed expenses shall be displayed at the end of this introduction in a certain form on his good name. Hashem Yitbarakh make his days and life long, long good and sweet life, Amen so let it be [His] will.",
            "And from now on, behold I reveal my mind and will with all my heart and soul, that my whole intention in this collection, and also in all the collections that Hashem Yitbarakh allowed me to assemble in the Written Torah and in Oral Torah, it is all for the unification of Kudsha Brikh Hu and his Shekhinah, and in awe and love and in fear and love, to unify the name of Hashem, Y\"H with W\"H, in complete unity, in the name of all Yisrael, and all my reasoning and thought and speech that is not according to the His will Yitbarakh, let them be null and anulled, so that all my desire in this collection, and the other collections that I do in chidushei Torah wit the help of heaven, and also any mitzvah that I do, it be in order to unify Kudsha Brikh Hu and his Shekhinah, and to rest of spirit before Him Yitbarakh specifically, without any outward turning, and Hashem Yitbarakh in His compasion help me to learn and teach Torah for its own sake, Amen so may it be [His] will.",
            "And since my proclamation is steadfast, in truth and in faith, before Hashem Yitbarakh, and in the eyes of all Yisrael<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">לעיני כל ישראל, the last words of the Torah, Deut. 34:12</i> a declaration great and strong, valid and lasting, I will prolong my prayer before Hashem, Please Hashem save us [from affliction], Please Hashem make us successful [in our deeds]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ps. 118</i>, and establish the fallen Sukkah of David, and let the Redeemer come to Tziyon, righteous [in deeds] and victorious is he<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zech. 9:9</i>, and let our eyes see the coming of our Righteous Mashiach, and the rebuilding of our Holy Temple, soon in our days, and let the pleasantness of Hashem our God be on us, and the work of our hands, establish for us (w/o mishap to us), and the work of our hands, establish it<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ps. 90</i>, and let the great name of Y-H be magnified and sanctified speedily and soon, Amen so let it be [His] will.",

                    "\"And Hashem-Elohim made for Adam and his wife honorable garments from [animal] hides, and dressed them.\" Behold it is known, what Rabbeinu the Arizal wrote regarding the garments of Adam haRishon. Before the <i>chet</i> [\"sin,\" lit. missing-the-mark], there were <i>ketonet ohr</i>/garments of light from the Chashmal and when he sinned he lost those clothings of Chashmal which are 378 lights, gematria of chashmal, and He made him a different clothing from klipat nogah which are the <i>ketonet `or</i>/garments of hide, as mentioned in Etz Chayim Shaar 106 Amud 4, q.v., also the Arizal wrote in Sha`ar Hakavanot regarding the intentions in the [morning blessing] \"<i>malbish `arumim</i>/Who dresses the bare,\" that the clothing of a man is from <i>kedushah</i>/holiness, and through transgressions that one does he causes the klipot to have a grip on the garments, and behold the garments have an <i>ohr hamakif</i> [\"surrounding light;\" aura] outside them as known, because there is an inner light inside included which is included in the body, and the clothings surrounds the body and over the clothing are the orot hamakifim and they stand outside the garments, and for each and every garment there is an aspect of ohr makif according to its value, and there is nothing that pushes off the klipot as much as ohr makif, since the klipot have no ability to feed from and take grip on the ohr hamakif, and therefore it stands outside and he has no fear of the klipot etc., see there.  ",
                    "And behold by this is understood the jealousy of the <i>nachash</i>/serpent who was jealous of Adam Harishon before the chet and provoked him to make him stumble, because he was jealous of his ketonet ohr since he saw he had a great ohr makif around him according to the value of the ketonet ohr, and he had no grip on the ohr makif, in the <i>sod</i>/secret, and the nachash was <i>`arum</i>/bare as it says, and therefore he provoked him to make him stumble and he caused that the ketonet ohr be removed from him and for `or to be instead of ohr, as it is written, \"<i>Vaya`as Hashem Elohim le'adam ve'ishto kotnot `ohr vayalbishem</i>/And Hashem Elohim made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins, and clothed them,\" and they said in the Holy Zohar that serpent skin clung to him, and with this I explained the remez of the scripture in the word \"<i>vayalbishem</i>,\" reading it as \"<i>vai levusham</i>/Woe for their clothing!\", it was the serpent skin; it was \"<i>vai</i>\" because it clung to them, which was all due to the chet, and it seems to me, bsd, the difference between \"<i>ohr</i>\" and \"<i>`or</i>\" is a gematria of 69, gematria of <i>yagon</i>/grief, and it is known that grief is from the side of the <i>sitra achra</i> as is known is the intention in <i>vehaser mimenu yagon ve'anachah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">[1]</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> from <i>hashiva shofteinu</i> in the `<i>Amidah</i> prayer</i> which is the force of impurity aliased <i>yagon</i> and the force of impurity aliased <i>anachah</i>, as mentioned in the siddur of the Rashash z\"l, and therefore we find that <i>evyon</i>/impoverished and <i>yagon</i> are the same gematria, because someone who becomes evyon of mitzvot, yagon clings to him, as the two letters aleft-vet become gimel, and then the letters of evyon become the letters of yagon, but in the future when the <i>tikkun</i>/perfection is completed the yagon will be removed completely and then the count of yagon will be missing from the letter `ayin of `or/skin, and what will remain is aleph, and then there will be the reunion of ohr/light as the crown returns to its old place: What follows from the above is that the <i>chitzonim</i>  [\"outside;\" forces that are outside of kedushah] have no grip on the ohr hamakif, which is why the serpent was jealous of Adam Harishon because of his ohr hamakif which he was bare of since he had no grip on it, behold from this is understood bsd the reason that the mitzvah of tzitzit is effective in remembering the mitzvot of Hashem as it is written, \"<i>u're'item oto u'zechartem et kol mitzvot Hashem</i>/and you shall see it and remember all the mitzvot of Hashem\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">[2]</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Num. 15</i>. The reason is the tzitzit are aspect of ohr makif as Rabeinu the Arizal wrote, and therefore it has power to repel the klipot and since it repels the klipot therefore it aids memory, for it is known what Rabeinu z\"l wrote in the Kavanot regarding the secret of the garments that a man wears, that it is necessary to be careful to not put on two garments simultaneously, and doing so breeds forgetfulness, and the secret of the thing is that each garment has an aspect of ohr hamakif, and nothings repels the klipot like the ohr hamakif, since they are unable to feed from them and grip them, and therefore one who joins two garments and dons them together does not leave a space for the ohr hamakif to enter between the two garments to surround each garment, and thereby the klipot are not repelled from there, and it is known that forgetfulness does not happen except because of the klipot, because memory is from the side of kedushah in the sod of \"<i>ein shikhechah lifnei kise kevodekha</i>/nothing is forgotten before Your throne of glory,\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">[3]</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Berakhot 32b and Yamim Nora'im prayers</i> end quote, q.v.. And from this it is understood the beautiful reason why the tzitzit because it is the aspect of ohr makif therefore it has power to push off the klipot and thereby forgetfulness is repelled and memory dominates, by one's seeing and remembering the mitzvot of Hashem, because by seeing it, via the contemplations related to it the illumination of the ohr hamakif is stimulated which is the sod of the tzitzit. And therefore tzitzit is gematria \"<i>beit ya`akov</i>\", of which we say \"<i>beit ya`akov lekhu ve nelekhah be'ohr Hashem</i>/House of Ya`akov go and let us walk in the light of Hashem\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">[4]</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isa. 2:5, recited in morning prayers</i>, because the grip of the ohr hamakif which is the sod of tzitzit is only for Yisrael who are the Beit Ya`akov, and on this we say \"<i>va'esa etchem `al kanfei nesharim</i>/And I shall lift you up on wings of eagles...\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">[5]</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ex. 19:4</i> but when the tikkun is finished \"<i>...ve'avi etchem elai</i>/and I shall bring you to Me,\" i.e. you will perceive everthying, even regarding the tallit; [also] <i>elai</i> is spelled <i>el-yud</i> (to the yud) which is the sod of chokhmah."

And now you will be wrapped in it, your head and body together. Such is the way it is detailed in Sefer Hakavanot, drush hatzitzit perek 1, and as the Rav El\"Y [? ] z\"l beautifully explained on daf 107 amud 4, and likewise explicitly stated in the siddur of Rabeinu haRashash z\"l.

However if he removes it in order to enter the bath where he will stay long, it is preferable to say the berakhah as the Arizal did. This is what I brought up in my holy book Mekabtzi`el. But if he changes his clothes and dons a different tallit katan, even if he dons it immediately after removing the first one, he should say the berakhah on the new one, an this too is the rule with a tallit gadol if he removes the one that is on him and dons a different tallit gadol, he should say the berakhah on the second one. And in my holy book Rav Pe`alim I wrote a responsa bs\"d, regarding someone whose practice it is to don tzitzit and tefilin each day in his house, in order to enter the synagogue in tzitzit and tefilin, but because he walks in pathways where many people pass back and forth, those of the Brit and those who are not of the Brit, he does not don the tallit gadol that he has in the synagogue, because it is visible to people, but instead he has a very thin tallit that large enough to be a tallit gadol but is not very big, and he dons in his house under his coat, and because it is very fine and also because it is not long it is not visible to people who apss by, and when he enters the synagogue he leaves this one on him under his coat, and dons the tallit gadol that he has, and I brought up bs\"d that he can say the berakhah in the synagogue on the second tallit, even though the first one is on him that he said a blessing over in his house, because there is a gap between [going from] his house to the synagogue, and also there is a hesech da`at since he says verses by the mezuzah, and furthermore it takes him much time to walk the path, and there in the synagogue he dons a different tallit that is full-sized, wrapping his head and body, while the tallit that is on him rests on his shoulder and legs, and also I found other reasons regarding this why he should say the berakhah, so one should not have any doubt on this regarding safek berakhot."

                        "Four sections are in the tefillin: <i>Kadesh</i> (Exodus 13:1-10); <i>VeHaya ki Yiviecha</i> (Exodus 13:11-16); <i>Shema</i> (Deuteronomy 6:4-9); and <i>VeHaya im Shemoa</i> (Deuteronomy 11:13-21). And that is the order of their placement according to Rashi, may his memory be blessed. However, according to the understanding of Rabbenu Tam, may his memory be blessed, their order is <i>Kadesh; VeHaya ki Yiviecha; VeHaya im Shemoa</i>; and <i>Shema</i>. But the practice is according to the Rashi's understanding, may his memory be blessed. And the Levush, may his memory be blessed, wrote that once the stand over Ezekiel the prophet's tomb, may his memory be blessed, fell and they found old tefillin there which were [arranged] according to the order of Rashi. So at the beginning, they thought this disagreement was like other disagreements in which one understanding was dispelled. But our teacher, the Ari, may his memory be blessed, came along and said from a tradition spoken by Eliyahu, his memory should be for the good, that both understandings are true and that one should [follow] both of them; and that they would wear two pairs from the days of our teacher, Moshe, up until the Geonim. And so is it found in the Gemara (Eruvin 95b), \"there is room on the head to place two pairs.\" And in the Zohar Chadash it is found that there were some people who would put on two pairs based on the doubt, \"as they did not know this secret that both are required.\" Hence one who fears the Heavens should make two pairs of tefillin, one like the understanding of Rashi and one like the understanding of Rabbenu Tam. And he should grab both of them in his hand and bring them up on his forearm and tie them, one on top of the other. As he needs to put them on together; and not like those who place that of Rashi by itself and that of Rabbenu Tam by itself. It is also necessary that he place the tefillin of Rabbenu Tam above that of Rashi, both with the head and with the arm. For the aspect of Rabbenu Tam's tefillin is greater than the aspect of Rashi's tefillin. Hence the practice is to make the Rabbenu Tam tefillin smaller than that of Rashi. But the connected (hence lower) part of the forearm is the higher. Hence he should first bring up that of Rashi and recite the blessing upon it after he ties it on the biceps; and afterwards bring up that of Rabbenu Tam. And it comes out with this that that of Rabbenu Tam is resting higher than that of Rashi. And all of that is with the boxes; but regarding the straps, he should place the strap of the Rabbenu Tam tefillin below the strap of Rashi. Hence he should make the width of the strap of Rabbenu Tam narrower than that of Rashi, in order that it can be covered by it. And likewise with the head, he should place the Rabbenu Tam tefillin above that of Rashi; and also the knot of the Rabbenu Tam tefillin should be on the nape a little higher than that of Rashi. However one should pass the straps, that hang down from the knot on the nape and below, underneath the Rashi strap, such that it cover it. The hint to this is (Psalms 37:37), \"Guard the blameless (<i>tam</i>), and see the upright (<i>yashar</i>, which is Rashi spelled backwards). And there is a reason for all of these things according to [Kabbalah], so one should not change a thing. One should also be careful not to place the box of one over the connection of the other, but rather adjacently, one below the other, with all of them resting upon the flesh - and as I wrote with the help of the Heavens in my holy book, MeKabtziel.\n"

Then he eats it without reclining, which is as was written by the Gaon, Chida (Chaim Yosef David Azulay); and also like our custom from the time of the crown of my head, the teacher and Gaon, my master grandfather, may his memory be for life in the world to come - to eat it without reclining. And this first dipping, which is the <i>karpas</i> in vinegar, is a remembrance of the cause for the hardship of the subjugation - as it was because of the sale of the righteous Yosef; that they dipped his cloak of <i>pasim</i> into blood, sold him and caused anguish to our father, Yaakov, may his memory be blessed. And this is hinted to in (the word,) <i>karpas</i>. And that is since the letters, <i>kar</i>, are the end of <i>makhar</i> (sold), and the letters, <i>pas</i>, are the beginning of <i>pasim</i>.

Nevertheless, he does not recite the blessing, \"who creates the fruit of the ground,\" upon bitter herbs, since it is considered something needed for the meal that comes within the meal (and hence covered by the earlier blessing over the matzah). And he should take care not to eat all of the <i>karpas</i> in the Seder plate, but rather leave some of the <i>karpas</i> in the Seder plate until after [eating from the matzah]. As the secret of the Seder plate needs to be complete until after the eating of matzah and bitter herbs."

(Avot, Ch. 5, 26)  We will see, with the help of heaven:  [Regarding] the separation of the sparks of holiness, there are two parts - the first that \"turns over\" the sparks of holiness from \"muddy matter\" to pure matter, this is called clarifying the external.  The second that \"turns over\" the sparks from pure matter to spirituality, and this is called clarifying the internal. And this is the matter because the sparks of holiness are contained in the inanimate objects, plants, and animals; the meat of domestic animals, wild animals, and chicken are all \"muddy matter\".  And if a man eats meat and raises up the spark in the meat that is \"muddy matter\"to the man that is \"pure matter\", or if he eats plants, or if he eats something that is mixed with dust it is considered inanimate and the dust has sparks of holiness. ",
                    "And then it is required to elevate the spark of holiness from the man to the spiritual, that is the place of holiness above the highest worlds...And behold, this is \"turning\" form \"pure matter\" to the \"spiritual\".  And the completion of these two parts of clarifying, they are the essence of external, and the essence of internal...it is not possible to complete except only through the study of Torah.  Because the words of Torah have external, the plain (pshat), and the internal, the secret (sod).  And that is why it says \"turn it over, turn it over\", there are two types of \"small jugs\": the first is from \"muddy matter\" to \"pure matter\" that is called \"clarifying the external\" and the second is from \"pure matter\" to \"spiritual\", this is called \"clarifying the internal\". ",
                    "Since it is all in the Torah it is \"imprisoned\" there, that is to say, the \"external\" and the \"internal\" and therefore it is the completion of the two clarifications, the \"external\" and the \"internal\", and regarding this, even though the clarification was made through eating, the clarification was not complete.  Because the clarification of the \"external\" from \"muddy matter\" to \"pure matter\" is not possible only through eating and therefore our Sages of blessed memory, warned us to study words of Torah at the table during the week.  And the study of the \"petach Eliyahu [prayer]\", he should be remembered for good, is a great segulah to clarify the sparks of holiness.  And the usual way [of having books on the table] is good for him but sometimes he is busy, or he is eating on his roof during the summer and it is not possible to learn by the light of a candle."

And therefore God commanded to kill off the Canaanites, as it is written \"You shall surely destroy them etc.\" (Deuteronomy 12:2) and \"You shall not let any soul live\" (Deuteronomy 20:16), because there were many and mighty sparks of holiness in their shell, and if Israel had treated them well and kept them in the world, they would not have been able to separate those sparks of holiness, and on the contrary, the \"shell\" would have been strengthened more, but by Israel destroying them below and killing them off to fulfill the commandment of the Lord, they were able to crush and destroy also the \"shell\" and take out what was \"swallowed from its mouth\".",

                    "And the fourth one after the bread is baked and the person threshes it with his teeth when he chews it. And in this the clarification of sparks of holiness from it is completed.",
                    "And these four steps of clarification are against four letters of the name of God, and therefore they established four blessings after eating food. And just as the purifying of bread needs to be with the threshings we have mentioned, so is the purification of sparks of holiness from the nation of idolatry and the \"shell\", which does not need to be by us; that we will crush them until they are destroyed. Therefore God did not destroy the Canaanites in the hands of heaven that he did not send them bad plagues in their land until they were destroyed, as he did to the Egyptians in the land of Egypt with ten plagues, rather he decreed that Israel would come to their lands and fight them and destroy them themselves, so that the clarification of sparks of holiness from their \"shell\" would be by Israel who would crush them themselves as they do with bread, and by this He destroys them in their place from heaven as He did to the Egyptians who did not need Israel to fight them. For this he said \"for they are our bread\", meaning God wanted to make them like bread that needs to be purified by man through the threshings that he does with it, and these \"remove their shadow\" - the good part - \"from them\". When the good part - which is sparks of holiness - is removed from bread,  \"and God\" - the name of God which is against four steps of clarification mentioned above is \"with us\" to help us in war in order to complete purification of sparks of holiness by our hands, and therefore \"do not fear them\" now, that they remain existing and they were not destroyed by heaven."

After Rosh Hashanah, when the friend comes to repay the loan, they announce \"I annul the loan,\" and don't take the money back. Afterwards, the friend buys some food and rejoices with this free money, and the lender can rejoice at having really performed the mitzvah of cancelling debts. With praise to the blessed God, I enacted such a mitzvah in our city of Baghdad, may God protect it. I printed Prozbul forms and handed them out to many people who used them, and I also instructed them to do as I described above, to lend a small sum after filling out the Prozbul in order to really perform the mitzvah. Happy are Israel, lovers of God's commandments, who fulfil them with joy!"

However, one who wishes to prepare <i>'Limonada'</i>, which is a beverage made of squeezed lemons together with sugar and water, they should first put the sugar in a bowl and squeeze lemons over it, and only then pour over water. But do not put the water before the squeezing of the lemons. They have found a sign for this in the Torah (Genesis 28:12) \"Behold, a ladder (<i>sulam</i>) standing on the earth\". The word <i>Sulam</i> is the initials of the words Sugar, Lemon, Mayim (water), which is the order that the lemonade is to be made."

                    "And behold it is well known that the work of the refinement of the holy sparks which is incumbent upon man is hefty work. However the refinement of that which is living and that which is vegetative is more incumbent upon man than the refinement of that which is inanimate. The essence [of the latter] is in the hands of God, may He be blessed, as it is through rain - like our master, the Ari, may his memory be blessed, wrote about the statement (Taanit 7a), \"A rainy day is as great as the revival of the dead.\" For that is why they fixed the mention of rain in the blessing, \"who revives the dead.\" For through the rain, the dead will be revived - they are the holy sparks in the inanimate that will rise from it, and that is their revival on the first level. And likewise did the Sages, may their memory be blessed, say (Taanit 7a), \"A rainy day is as great as the ingathering of the exiles\" - for the holy sparks are gathered on it. However it is clear that there is more of a need incumbent upon man to refine the living and the vegetative, since he is to refine them through eating, as it is something edible. And therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded two commandments that are by way of a statute (<i>chok</i>). One is with the vegetative, which is forbidden mixtures (<i>kilayim</i>); and the other is with living flesh and that is milk and meat. For these two commandments are statutes that do not have explanations. As this is permissible by itself and that is permissible by itself, so why should they be forbidden when they are in a mixture? And it is well known that any commandment of the statute type which a man keeps has a gap in its performance, since the Satan and the nations of the world taunt Israel and mock the statute commandment saying, \"What is this commandment and what explanation is there about it?\" And there will hence be help and support from it to overcome the husk and to break its power, to separate the holy spark from it that is absorbed amidst the evil part of the husk and mixed in with the vegetative and with the living. And that is why the numerical count (<i>gematria</i>) of statute  <i>chok</i> is that of <i>Geihinnom</i> - since through the performance of the statute, man extracts the good spark from the fire of <i>Geihinnom</i>, which is the evil that is attached to it. So Israel is victorious. Hence a person must be careful about this statute concerning the prohibition of milk and meat, so that he not stumble in it, God forbid - even with something small in it. For through it, he will have a great boost with the refinement that he needs to refine from the food."

Therefore, even if they are new, such that he bought them from a gentile artisan [who made them], he must [still] immerse them. And it is forbidden to use it without immersion, even for cold [food]. But if a Jew rented or borrowed a vessel from a gentile, it does not require immersion. And this is specifically with culinary vessels, since the verse is dealing with culinary vessels - as it is written (Numbers 31:23), \"Anything that is placed on a fire, etc.\" And what is something that is placed on a fire and and one needs to make it fit (kosher) with a fire? I would say that is a culinary vessel that absorbs [flavor] with fire, and so requires fire for the ejection of what is absorbed.\n"
