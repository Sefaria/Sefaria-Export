            "Rabbi Shimon gave this introduction, saying (Zohar Vol. 3, daf 166b): \"<i>Ayelet ahavim ve'ya'alat chen, dadeiha yeravukha bekhol 'et; be'ahavatah tishgeh tamid</i>/A lovely ewe and a graceful she-ibex, let her teats satisfy you at all times; with her love be involved (to the [partial] neglect of other matters) always. (Prov. 5:19)\" Oraita! Oraita! (Torah! Torah!) the light of all the worlds! How many seas and rivers and wells and springs spread out from you to in all directions! From you is everything, by you the upper and lower [worlds] are sustained. His upper light goes out from you. Oraita! Oraita! what shall I say of you, <i>ayelet ahavim ve'ya`alat chen</i>, above and below are your mercies, whoever merits to acquire from you in the proper fashion. Oraita! Oraita! The delights of those who master you! Who can reveal and tell your secret and hidden things!",
            "Master of Universe, let it be Your will to give strength and power to me and to all Yisrael, and let us enter in without shame before you and before the <i>Matronita `Ila'ah</i> (Higher Divine Presence), of which it is said, \"<i>em-habanim smechah</i>/as joyful as a mother of children\"<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ps. 113</i>. And let us not be in shame before the <i>Barta DiMalka</i> (Lower Divine Presence), of which it is said, \"<i>kol kevudah bat melekh penimah</i>/all honor [shall be] for the King's daughter (His entourage) who is within (i.e. humble),\" and of which it is said, \"<i>Rabot banot `asu chayil, ve'at `alit `al kulanah</i>/Many women have acquired riches, but you surpass them all\" (Prov. 31).",
            "And being that the holy way of the genius who wrote <i>Halakhot Gedolot</i> is very pleasant to me, who opened the preface with <i>Birkot Hatorah</i>/Blessings recited before learning Torah, I too, the humble one, shall also proceed in this straight way, and give thanks first in reciting the Birkot Hatorah:",
            "Blessed are You Hashem, Our God King of the Universe, Who has sanctified us with his commandments and commanded us regarding <i>divrei</i>/words/matters of Torah. Now please make sweet, Hashem our God, the dirvei of Your Torah in our mouths, and in the mouths of Your people Yisrael. And be we and our offspring and the offspring of our offspring, all us us knowers of Your name and learning Your Torah for its own sake. Blessed are You Hashem, Who teaches Torah to His people Yisrael.",

And your glory upon us holy Torah, your knowledge on us holy Torah, and our minds on you holy Torah, be not lifted from you, and do not part from us, not in this world and not in the coming world.",
            "Blessed is our God who has created us for His glory, and separated us from those who err, and given us the Torah of truth, and planted eternal life among us, \"<i>Mah ashiv laShem kol tagmuluhi `alai</i>/How can I return to Hashem all his benevolences toward me?\"<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ps. 116</i>, Who has permitted me in His great mercies and great compassions, to serve in the \"courtyards of the Temple of Hashem,\" in the place that our holy forefathers served, <i>nishmatam eden</i>/their souls in Paradise, in the permanent dwelling each and every Shabbat, when the children of Yisrael assemble there, to expound to them holy scriptures, which they read on their Shabbatot each parashah in its time, as its arrangement and order is given; <i>zot chuqat hatorah</i>/This is the statute of the Torah. Also including <i>drashahs</i> of the Haftarah readings, though my original [work] was review of the Torah, and as Hashem Yitbarakh graced me in His great compassion, to some produce <i>chidushim</i>/novel words by the way of <i>peshat</i> [basic explanation of the scripture] or <i>derash</i> [mystical explanation] or the <b>crown</b> of <i>remez</i>, I recorded the chidushim for reminder. And already in the year 5624 I printed from my chidushim with the help of Heaven a book small in quantity, on the Pentateuch, and I named it <i>Aderet Eliyahu</i> (the cape of Eliyahu<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Kings 2</i>), and behold, from that time until now, praise to El Yitbarakh, the chidushei Torah increased from what Hashem bestowed to me, and because we have heard an admonition from the mouth of scribes and from the mouth of <i>sefarim</i>/holy books that a man is obligated to print his sefarim in his lifetime, I awakened myself to bring to the printhouse chidushei Torah in the way of drash and remez on the Pentateuch, because I reasoned that it is proper to advance this before other chidushei Torah, because it is food for every man, and it is a staple for every soul, and benefits the masses a bit more, but because the printing expenses were great, and I have not the financial means, I was forced to bring to print at this time only a little of my produce, one quarter of what I have by the grace of `El Eylon, and if Hashem Yitbarakh desires He will help me bring what remains with me in a separate book, because that which remains has a great quantity, and furthermore has also the chidushei Torah that I darshened on the verses of the Haftarot of the whole year; I have not brought one of the here, because due to their great quantity they are fit to be a large sefer by themselves, if Hashem helps.",
            "Nonetheless I interlaced settled <i>halakhot</i>/laws of conduct throughout this collection, from all kinds of halakhot that are brought in the Shulchan Arukh \"Orach Chayim\" and \"Yoreh De`ah,\" because I was already accustomed to publicly lecture also one these each and every Shabbat, because I immersed myself in the sefarim and enlightened my eyes with the words of our Sages of blessed memory, and I knew that the ancient way of our Rabbis the Rishonim [or \"our early Rabbis\"] z\"l who would lecture to the people every Shabbat, that they would not make a constant [study] only on <i>aggada</i>/homily in the Midrashim and <i>peshatim</i>, but rather they also lectured them halakhot to let them know the statutes of God and His Torahs/instructions, to know the way they should go, and the things they should do, because likewise we find in the Gemara in Sanhedrin (daf 38), \"Said Rabbi Yochanan, 'When Rabbi Meir would lecture on his piece, he would say one-third legal decisions, one-third aggada, one-third parables,'\" see there. And likewise we find in our Rabbis z\"l in Mekhilta, they bring the words of Rabbeinu Maharam Alshich z\"l, at the beginning of <i>parashat</i>/the Torah portion Vayakhel, that Moshe Rabbeinu the servant of Hashem taught the children of Yisrael that they should gather on Shabbatot, to lecture to them the laws of Shabbat and His Torahs, see there. And likewise they said the same in the Gemara, \"Moshe ordained for Yisrael, to teach the laws of Pesach at Pesach [time], laws of Atzeret at Atzeret [time], laws of the [Sukkot] Festival at Sukkot [time], and such is the report from several devotees in the Gemara, that their custom was to teach halakhot each and every Shabbat, and truthfully logical reasoning also requires this, to teach halakhot to the people, to know what Yisrael should do in the mitzvot of Hashem, and see Pri Chadash in Yoreh De`ah hilkhot Tol`ayim [laws regarding prohibition of eating worms], siman 84, that he wrote, verbatim, \"And it is necessary to inspire and teach these matters to the people more that teaching them peshatim,\" end of quote.",
            "Actually it is a known thing that to lecture on halakhot alone, the heart of the masses is not drawn after this, rather it is necessary to make the derash the root and most of it words of agadda and <i>mussar</i>/ethical teaching, and the lecturer should also mention in the middle the decided halakhot, through the tie that that he ties in the lecture that he says on the text, in order to draw the hearts of the people to these things in <i>chokhmah</i>/wisdom and <i>da`at</i>/knowledge, and this was the intention of our master the Tanna Rabbi Meir a\"h, who wuold lecture a third in halakhot, a third in aggadot and a third in <i>mashalim</i>/allegories in order to draw the heart of the masses to hear the halakhot via two thirds of aggada and mashalim, and it seems to me the mashalim were in the manner of mussar, and so will you find in Shabbat daf 30: The question was asked of Rabbi Tanchum, \"What does it mean to extinguish a lamp for a sick person on Shabbat?\" And he opened with this introduction and said first some long words of aggada, and afterwards at the end of his words he gave them a short answer on the legal question mentioned, and Rashi z\"l explains there, so were they accustomed to give an introduction with aggada first, in order to draw the hearts of the audience to hear the halakhah.",
            "And likewise we find in the Gemara of Sotah daf 40: Rabbi Abbahu and Rabbi Chiya bar Abba happened uppon that place. Rabbi Chiya bar Abba spoke about halakhic decisions, and Rabbi Abbahu told aggada. Everybody abandoned Rabbi Chiya bar Abba, and came before Rabbi Abbahu. Rabbi Chiya was downcast. Rabbi Abahu said to him, \"I will tell you a parable what this is like. To two men who come to a city, one selling gems and jewels, and one selling tinsel. Who do they jump to? Not to the one who sells tinsel!\" See there. Hence the world chases after homiletics and peshatim, therefore you must proceed wisely according to the minds of people, namely to make most of the lecture in aggada and explanation of the scripture, and the lesser part words of halakhah absorbed into it in the middle or in the end, and this is the proper way.",
            "Therefore I, the young one, after the year 5630, it came to my heart to mention in the lecture on the parashah that I am publicly speaking each Shabbat, some halakhot from matters mentioned in the Orach Chayim and Yoreh De`ah, and I would tie the beginnings of the halakhot with the lecture on the Torah, and after the halakhot I would end the lecture with verses of the Haftarah. However it was not possible to finish all the halakhot that I decided to teach on every Shabbat in one year, rather they needed a length of two years, as they are organized in the eyes of the reader in the second part of this book, and every two years they are to be repeated, and therefore I made the halakhot with their ties in separate parts, Part One and Part Two, and brought them to the printhouse to join them with the lectures that are in this book, so that the eyes of the Tzadikim should see straight [ways]<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ps. 17:2</i>, and also in the halakhot I mentioned I omitted for now several halakhot from the first part and the second part, due to the expense of printing, and if Hashem helps, in the halakhot part too there will be a later edition, and they will come in a separate book.",
            "And behold since I named my book on Talmud discourses <b>\" Ben Yehoyada\"</b> -- which I have not yet printed but only on two tractates -- and Hashem Yitbarakh allow me to print all of it for good life and peace -- I chose to call this book <b>\"Ben Ish Chai\"</b>. And Hashem Yitbarakh help me to print the rest of the books which He has graced me in His great compassion and great kindness. And the name of the man who donated money for printed expenses shall be displayed at the end of this introduction in a certain form on his good name. Hashem Yitbarakh make his days and life long, long good and sweet life, Amen so let it be [His] will.",
            "And from now on, behold I reveal my mind and will with all my heart and soul, that my whole intention in this collection, and also in all the collections that Hashem Yitbarakh allowed me to assemble in the Written Torah and in Oral Torah, it is all for the unification of Kudsha Brikh Hu and his Shekhinah, and in awe and love and in fear and love, to unify the name of Hashem, Y\"H with W\"H, in complete unity, in the name of all Yisrael, and all my reasoning and thought and speech that is not according to the His will Yitbarakh, let them be null and anulled, so that all my desire in this collection, and the other collections that I do in chidushei Torah wit the help of heaven, and also any mitzvah that I do, it be in order to unify Kudsha Brikh Hu and his Shekhinah, and to rest of spirit before Him Yitbarakh specifically, without any outward turning, and Hashem Yitbarakh in His compasion help me to learn and teach Torah for its own sake, Amen so may it be [His] will.",
            "And since my proclamation is steadfast, in truth and in faith, before Hashem Yitbarakh, and in the eyes of all Yisrael<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">לעיני כל ישראל, the last words of the Torah, Deut. 34:12</i> a declaration great and strong, valid and lasting, I will prolong my prayer before Hashem, Please Hashem save us [from affliction], Please Hashem make us successful [in our deeds]<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ps. 118</i>, and establish the fallen Sukkah of David, and let the Redeemer come to Tziyon, righteous [in deeds] and victorious is he<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zech. 9:9</i>, and let our eyes see the coming of our Righteous Mashiach, and the rebuilding of our Holy Temple, soon in our days, and let the pleasantness of Hashem our God be on us, and the work of our hands, establish for us (w/o mishap to us), and the work of our hands, establish it<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ps. 90</i>, and let the great name of Y-H be magnified and sanctified speedily and soon, Amen so let it be [His] will.",

                    "\"And Hashem-Elohim made for Adam and his wife honorable garments from [animal] hides, and dressed them.\" Behold it is known, what Rabbeinu the Arizal wrote regarding the garments of Adam haRishon. Before the <i>chet</i> [\"sin,\" lit. missing-the-mark], there were <i>ketonet ohr</i>/garments of light from the Chashmal and when he sinned he lost those clothings of Chashmal which are 378 lights, gematria of chashmal, and He made him a different clothing from klipat nogah which are the <i>ketonet `or</i>/garments of hide, as mentioned in Etz Chayim Shaar 106 Amud 4, q.v., also the Arizal wrote in Sha`ar Hakavanotregarding the the intentions in the [morning blessing] \"<i>malbish `arumim</i>/Who dresses the bare,\" that the clothing of a man is from <i>kedushah</i>/holiness, and through transgressions that one does he causes the klipot to have a grip on the garments, and behold the garments have an <i>ohr hamakif</i> [\"surrounding light;\" aura] outside them as known, because there is an inner light inside included which is included in the body, and the clothings surrounds the body and over the clothing are the orot hamakifim and they stand outside the garments, and for each and every garment there is an aspect of ohr makif according to its value, and there is nothing that pushes off the klipot as much as ohr makif, since the klipot have no ability to feed from and take grip on the ohr hamakif, and therefore it stands outside and he has no fear of the klipot etc., see there.  ",
                    "And behold by this is understood the jealousy of the <i>nachash</i>/serpent who was jealous of Adam Harishon before the chet and provoked him to make him stumble, because he was jealous of his ketonet ohr since he saw he had a great ohr makif around him according to the value of the ketonet ohr, and he had no grip on the ohr makif, in the <i>sod</i>/secret, and the nachash was <i>`arum</i>/bare as it says, and therefore he provoked him to make him stumble and he caused that the ketonet ohr be removed from him and for `or to be instead of ohr, as it is written, \"<i>Vaya`as Hashem Elohim le'adam ve'ishto kotnot `ohr vayalbishem</i>/And Hashem Elohim made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins, and clothed them,\" and they said in the Holy Zohar that serpent skin clung to him, and with this I explained the remez of the scripture in the word \"<i>vayalbishem</i>,\" reading it as \"<i>vai levusham</i>/Woe for their clothing!\", it was the serpent skin; it was \"<i>vai</i>\" because it clung to them, which was all due to the chet, and it seems to me, bsd, the the difference between \"<i>ohr</i>\" and \"<i>`or</i>\" is a gematria of 69, gematria of <i>yagon</i>/grief, and it is known that grief is from the side of the <i>sitra achra</i> as is known is the intention in <i>vehaser mimenu yagon ve'anachah</i><sup>[1]</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> from <i>hashiva shofteinu</i> in the `<i>Amidah</i> prayer</i> which is the force of impurity aliased <i>yagon</i> and the force of impurity aliased <i>anachah</i>, as mentioned in the siddur of the Rashash z\"l, and therefore we find that <i>evyon</i>/impoverished and <i>yagon</i> are the same gematria, because someone who becomes evyon of mitzvot, yagon clings to him, as the two letters aleft-vet become gimel, and then the letters of evyon become the letters of yagon, but in the future when the <i>tikkun</i>/perfection is completed the yagon will be removed completely and then the count of yagon will be missing from the letter `ayin of `or/skin, and what will remain is aleph, and then there will be the reunion of ohr/light as the crown returns to its old place: What follows from the above is that the <i>chitzonim</i>  [\"outside;\" forces that are outside of kedushah] have no grip on the ohr hamakif, which is why the serpent was jealous of Adam Harishon because of his ohr hamakif which he was bare of since he had no grip on it, behold from this is understood bsd the reason that the mitzvah of tzitzit is effective in remembering the mitzvot of Hashem as it is written, \"<i>u're'item oto u'zechartem et kol mitzvot Hashem</i>/and you shall see it and remember all the mitzvot of Hashem\"<sup>[2]</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Num. 15</i>. The reason is the tzitzit are aspect of ohr makif as Rabeinu the Arizal wrote, and therefore it has power to repel the klipot and since it repels the klipot therefore it aids memory, for it is known what Rabeinu z\"l wrote in the Kavanot regarding the secret of the garments that a man wears, that it is necessary to be careful to not put on two garments simultaneously, and doing so breeds forgetfulness, and the secret of the thing is that each garment has an aspect of ohr hamakif, and nothings repels the klipot like the ohr hamakif, since they are unable to feed from them and grip them, and therefore one who joins two garments and dons them together does not leave a space for the ohr hamakif to enter between the two garments to surround each garment, and thereby the klipot are not repelled from there, and it is known that forgetfulness does not happen except because of the klipot, because memory is from the side of kedushah in the sod of \"<i>ein shikhechah lifnei kise kevodekha</i>/nothing is forgotten before Your throne of glory,\"<sup>[3]</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Berakhot 32b and Yamim Nora'im prayers</i> end quote, q.v.. And from this it is understood the beautiful reason why the tzitzit because it is the aspect of ohr makif therefore it has power to push off the klipot and thereby forgetfulness is repelled and memory dominates, by one's seeing and remembering the mitzvot of Hashem, because by seeing it, via the contemplations related to it the illumination of the ohr hamakif is stimulated which is the sod of the tzitzit. And therefore tzitzit is gematria \"<i>beit ya`akov</i>\", of which we say \"<i>beit ya`akov lekhu ve nelekhah be'ohr Hashem</i>/House of Ya`akov go and let us walk in the light of Hashem\"<sup>[4]</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isa. 2:5, recited in morning prayers</i>, because the grip of the ohr hamakif which is the sod of tzitzit is only for Yisrael who are the Beit Ya`akov, and on this we say \"<i>va'esa etchem `al kanfei nesharim</i>/And I shall lift you up on wings of eagles...\"<sup>[5]</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ex. 19:4</i> but when the tikkun is finished \"<i>...ve'avi etchem elai</i>/and I shall bring you to Me,\" i.e. you will perceive everthying, even regarding the tallit; [also] <i>elai</i> is spelled <i>el-yud</i> (to the yud) which is the sod of chokhmah."

Then first grab the two on the right and cast them behind you to the left, so that they be wrapped around your neck over your left shoulder to the back, while the two left ones remain hanging in front of you, and wait the short time length of walking four amot or slightly less, then follow by sending the left ones also behind you to the left, so that now all four corners are hanging behind you together on the left, and wait the time of walking four amot and then let the tallit that is wrapped around your neck go down over all your body. And now you will be wrapped in it, your head and body together. Such is the way it is detailed in Sefer Hakavanot, drush hatzitzit perek 1, and as the Rav El\"Y [? ] z\"l beautifully explained on daf 107 amud 4, and likewise explicitly stated in the siddur of Rabeinu haRashash z\"l. And what he wrote that one should wait between throwing the two right ones and the two left ones, a time length of walking 4 amot, is not explained explicitly in the words of Rabeinu z\"l and in the words of the Rashash z\"l, but because it is explained there that it is necessary to do kavanot in that part by itself, and kavanot in the other part by itself, thus the throwing of the first two while the two left ones are still hanging in front has a matter to it by itself. And we do not make these kavanot, therefore it suffices for us to wait the time of walking four amot, in order to fulfill the precept of this matter, and as written \"`eder `eder levado/each flock by itself... and put a space between one flock and the other.\""

However if he removes it in order to enter the bath where he will stay long, it is preferable to say the berakhah as the Arizal did. This is what I brought up in my holy book Mekabtzi`el. But if he changes his clothes and dons a different tallit katan, even if he dons it immediately after removing the first one, he should say the berakhah on the new one, an this too is the rule with a tallit gadol if he removes the one that is on him and dons a different tallit gadol, he should say the berakhah on the second one. And in my holy book Rav Pe`alim I wrote a responsa bs\"d, regarding someone whose practice it is to don tzitzit and tefilin each day in his house, in order to enter the synagogue in tzitzit and tefilin, but because he walks in pathways where many people pass back and forth, those of the Brit and those who are not of the Brit, he does not don the tallit gadol that he has in the synagogue, because it is visible to people, but instead he has a very thin tallit that large enough to be a tallit gadol but is not very big, and he dons in his house under his coat, and because it is very fine and also because it is not long it is not visible to people who apss by, and when he enters the synagogue he leaves this one on him under his coat, and dons the tallit gadol that he has, and I brought up bs\"d that he can say the berakhah in the synagogue on the second tallit, even though the first one is on him that he said a blessing over in his house, because there is a gap between [going from] his house to the synagogue, and also there is a hesech da`at since he says verses by the mezuzah, and furthermore it takes him much time to walk the path, and there in the synagogue he dons a different tallit that is full-sized, wrapping his head and body, while the tallit that is on him rests on his shoulder and legs, and also I found other reasons regarding this why he should say the berakhah, so one should not have any doubt on this regarding safek berakhot."

The second that \"turns over\" the sparks from pure matter to spirituality, and this is called clarifying the internal. And this is the matter because the sparks of holiness are contained in the inanimate objects, plants, and animals; the meat of domestic animals, wild animals, and chicken are all \"muddy matter\".  And if a man eats meat and raises up the spark in the meat that is \"muddy matter\"to the man that is \"pure matter\", or if he eats plants, or if he eats something that is mixed with dust it is considered inanimate and the dust has sparks of holiness.

And the completion of these two parts of clarifying, they are the essence of external, and the essence of internal...it is not possible to complete except only through the study of Torah.  Because the words of Torah have external, the plain (pshat), and the internal, the secret (sod).  And that is why it says \"turn it over, turn it over\", there are two types of \"small jugs\": the first is from \"muddy matter\" to \"pure matter\" that is called \"clarifying the external\" and the second is from \"pure matter\" to \"spiritual\", this is called \"clarifying the internal\".

Because the clarification of the \"external\" from \"muddy matter\" to \"pure matter\" is not possible only through eating and therefore our Sages of blessed memory, warned us to study words of Torah at the table during the week.  And the study of the \"petach Eliyahu [prayer]\", he should be remembered for good, is a great segulah to clarify the sparks of holiness.

                        "One has to be very careful in the prayer of Minchah of the holy Shabbat, for it has [the potential for] many ascents upwards. And even though there are siddurim in which it is written \"And who is like Your nation Israel?\"--the main idea is that one must say \"like Your nation, like Israel\" [and not \"like Your nation Israel\"], and just as [the author] wrote in Shalmei Chagigah in the name of Rabbi Ya'akov Tzemach in Nagid UMitzvah, and so it is in the siddur of our master, Rabbi Shalom Shar'abi of blessed memory, which is found among us. And from the language of Sha'ar HaKavvanot [by Rabbi Chayyim Vital], which mentions \"like Your nation Israel\"--from this [citation] there is no proof in general. And I said, with the help of Heaven, that the language of \"like Israel\" is more correct, for in II Samuel 7[:23], it says \"like Israel,\" and, in [I] Chronicles 17[:21], it says, \"Israel,\" and therefore what our master Rabbi Ya'akov Tzemach of blessed memory well wrote is correct, that we must say \"like Israel\"--on account of this being a verse from Prophets. And like this, we have found the pronouncing of 'Migdol yeshu'ot malko'  (II Samuel 22:51) in Birkat HaMazon, for on Shabbat, we say \"Migdol,\" just as it is written in Prophets (II Samuel 22:51), and, on a profane day, \"Magdil,\" just as it is written in Scriptures (Psalm 18:21)."
