                    "Traditions of the ancients, contained within the books of our ancestors,",
                    "New interpretations of the law soaring high above;<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This poem by the Netziv, which rhymes in Hebrew, is a paean to the works of the earlier commentators, especially the She’iltos. The poem is meant to apply to the entire <i>Ha’amek She’elah</i>. The words “high above” are taken from Isa.7:11, which is also the verse from which the title of his work, <i>Ha’amek She’elah</i>, is derived. The verse in Isaiah states: “Request a sign for yourself from the Lord your God. Request it from the depths or from high above.” This can be read to mean that the interpretations of the Torah provided by the early generations are comparable to a sign from Heaven that attests to God’s greatness. The word <i>le-hagbe’ah,</i> towards above (a verbal noun), may also be read as <i>le-hagbiah</i>, “to lift upward.” See <i>Pesah Ha’amek</i> in Section 1, <i>os</i> 10, where the Netziv writes that his commentary lifts upward (reveals) the concepts hidden in the depths (the words of the <i>She’iltos</i>).</i>",
                    "Analysis of their words expresses His majesty forever.",
                    "They are His concealed Might,<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The words “concealed Might” are taken from Habakkuk 3:4. This may allude to the way the words of the ancients exposed God’s presence in a manner similar to the revelation at Mount Sinai.</i> every word to be treasured;<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The early authorities were very careful with their words, such that it behooves one to pay great attention to any variation in or addition of words to understand their intent. This Netziv applies this approach on almost every page of <i>Ha’amek She’elah.</i></i>",
                    "They are His words of caution, protecting one from stumbling.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This denotes that by learning the early sources, such as the <i>She’iltos</i>, one obtains insights into the proper interpretation of the Talmud and provides further insights into how one is to practice Judaism.</i>",
                    "More than others was Koheles wise.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I translated the word <i>ve-yoser</i> as “more than others,” which is similar to the way that the Targum translated it. I believe that it fits best with what the Netziv writes in chapter 7 rather than the usual translation of “besides being wise.” There he notes that this phrase describes how Solomon had employed the methods of analysis and teaching listed in this verse in a manner superior to any other.</i> He also taught the people knowledge. He pondered and sought out, and set in order many proverbs (Koheles 12:9).<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv writes in the Introduction to his commentary on <i>Shir ha-Shirim</i> that the book of <i>Koheles</i> was written to teach both Jews and non-Jews that the main goal of humanity is to serve God. As <i>Koheles</i> 12:13 says: “The sum of the matter, when all has been considered, is this: fear God and obey his commandments, for that is man’s whole duty.” Only verses 9–12 in the final chapter of <i>Koheles</i> are written specifically for the Jewish nation. The Netziv uses these verses for the three different sections of his Introduction to <i>Ha’amek She’elah </i>to convey the main points discussed in each of those sections. The Netziv quotes verse 9 at the beginning of Section I because it describes the methodology of King Solomon’s study of the Torah, for he “exerted himself to examine the rationales of all the laws that had been received from the previous [courts], and he educated [others] in the methodology [that the previous courts applied] to reach their conclusions” (see Part 1, chapter 7). According to the Netziv, this verse describes the ultimate goal of Torah study, which is to understand the rationales and scope of the laws that the previous generations have derived from the Torah.</i>",
                    "<b>T<small>HE FOUR LEVELS OF TORAH</small></b><br>W<small>HEN [GOD GAVE</small> the Torah to the Jewish people,] “He came with some of the sacred myriads;<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The translation I have provided is from Rashi’s commentary on the Torah. Since God came with only <i>some </i>of his sacred myriads, it can mean that God is modest, as explained by Rashi on that verse. In other words, God did not wish to reveal His entire essence to Israel because He intended man to discover the Torah by his own efforts.</i> and in His right hand was <i>esh-das,</i> a fire of law, for them [Israel].”<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 33:2. The Netziv quotes this verse at the beginning of each of the three sections and in the introduction to his Torah commentary, <i>Ha’amek Davar</i>. This verse describes both the nature of the Torah and the manner in which it was revealed to Israel. More importantly, it expresses the betrothal of God and Israel that was achieved through the Revelation of the Torah to the Jewish people. The Netziv in other sections of this book describes how the nature of Torah is similar to several characteristics of fire. See the <i>Sifrei </i>on the passage of <i>Ve-zos ha-beracha</i>, 3:2: “This verse teaches us that the words of Torah are comparable to fire. Just as fire was given from Heaven, so are the words of Torah given from Heaven, as it is written, ‘You have seen that from Heaven I spoke to you’ (Ex. 20:16). Just as fire sustains the world, so do the words of Torah sustain the world. Just as one who approaches fire becomes singed, while he who distances himself from it cannot warm himself because [he has allowed] the fire to grow cold, so it is with the words of Torah. He who uses them [for personal gain] becomes lost from the world. If he separates himself from it, he experiences death, and if he toils over it, it brings him life. Just as fire will be used in this world and in the World to Come, so will the words of Torah be used in this world and in the World to Come. Just as whoever uses fire gets a mark on his body, so those scholars who toil [in the Torah] are distinguishable among mankind by the way they walk, the way they speak and the way they dress in the marketplace.”</i> This verse describes two categories of Torah law. The first is laws that are obvious to all – laws that clearly define what an individual may and may not do. This class of laws is referred to as <i>das, </i>law, similar to the word <i>das</i> in Esther 1:15: [“Then the King conferred with the experts”… as to what should be done <i>ke-das,</i> legally, [to Queen Vashti…].”<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Esther 1:15.</i> The second category described in the verse consists of those laws that remain hidden until one brings them to light through analysis and analogy. This category of laws is referred to as <i>esh </i>(fire). In the same way that many sparks can come from a single flame, [so may an unlimited number of laws be derived from the Torah]. Each spark can create a flame whose size is limited only by the amount of fuel added or by the means used to increase the flame.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One such technique, for example, could be the fanning of the flame. The fuel or techniques may be symbolic of the toil one applies to Torah study, or it may represent the spiritual and cognitive development of the individual.</i> Such is the way of Torah, as it is written: “Like a hammer that breaks the rock into pieces.”<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jer. 23:2. This means that from a single law, “a rock,” many other laws, “the pieces,” may be derived. See the Netziv in Part 2, chapter 10, translating and interpreting tractates <i>Shabbos</i> 88a and <i>Sanhedrin</i> 34a, which describe the verse in Jeremiah as follows: “In the academy of R. Yishmael it was taught, ‘like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces.’ Just as a hammer causes a rock to emit many sparks, so can a verse be explained in many ways.” According to the Netziv, this metaphor refers to the various opinions that result from disagreement. Another way of translating this <i>gemara </i>is: “Just as a rock can shatter a rock into many pieces, so can a verse be explained in many ways.” This approach of the Netziv is explained in depth in Section 2, chapter 10.</i>",
                    "From ancient times, beginning with the days of Joshua, there were cases in which the Torah scholars of each generation debated the law that was in doubt. These cases were then decided by majority vote,<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These cases were decided by the Sanhedrin, as the Netziv writes in <i>Pesah Ha’amek</i> (3:2).</i> in accordance with the Torah rule of following the majority.<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Hullin</i> 11a, which explains the verse “to lean toward the majority” (Ex. 23:3) to mean that we follow the majority vote in all cases.</i> Such a decision is referred to as <i>halacha berurah,</i> a clearly-defined Law. Thus, <i>das</i> was derived from e<i>sh</i>.",
                    "The Midrash (<i>Bereshis Rabbah, </i>1<i>)</i>: writes, “‘Then I was to Him as an <i>amon</i>.…’<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 8:30.</i> <i>Amon</i> means a guardian [pedagog]; <i>amon</i> means a teacher of that which is covered; <i>amon</i> means a teacher of that which is hidden, and some say that the word <i>amon</i> refers to the capital [Alexandria of Egypt].”<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This Midrash derives the fourth interpretation from Nahum 3:8: “Are you better than No-amon, which was situated among the rivers with water around it…?” The Targum renders “No-amon” as the “capital Alexandria.”</i> The point of this <i>midrash</i> is that there are three categories of Torah law.<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The analogies are listed in ascending order of difficulty. The Netziv states that these analogies refer to three categories of law. In fact there are four, but since the last category is not accessible by man, it need not be counted separately.</i>",
                    "The first category, the “guardian,” refers to laws that are easy to learn, similar to the ones that school pupils are taught. When the guardian teaches the child, the child can understand the lessons with no need for analysis.",
                    "The second category, “that which is covered,” refers to matters that can only be revealed to those who already possess knowledge and analytical skills. Similarly, the Torah contains laws that require analysis in order to be understood correctly. These kinds of laws are described as “covered” because while their general location is known, they can be retrieved only with effort, as it says, “If you search for her as for silver… [then you shall understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God].”<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 2:4–5. This refers to deep analysis of the words of the Torah to derive new concepts related to the context of the passage that are hidden within the words. The Netziv interprets the word “silver” in this verse as silver ore rather than silver coins. See <i>Kadmas Ha’amek</i> 2:6 and the introduction to his commentary on the Torah in <i>os</i> 3, where he elucidates this verse in greater detail.</i>",
                    "The third category, “that which is hidden,” refers to concepts whose whereabouts are unknown, and finding them requires help and support from God. Similarly, there are secrets hidden within the Torah that cannot be revealed through analysis or analogy alone, but require Divine assistance. This portion of the Torah is transmitted only to those who expend great effort to search for it, comparable to the effort expended in searching for lost treasures, as Scripture says, “… if you hunt for her as hidden treasures, [then you shall understand the fear of the Lord, and find] the knowledge of God.”<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Id. The Netziv in Part 2 explains that “treasures” relate to inferences from the Torah that are unrelated to the context. It is much easier to mine silver and smelt it to produce pure silver than it is to find treasures that are so valuable they are secreted away and thus require external help to find.</i>",
                    "Those who add the opinion “[that <i>amon</i>] refers to the capital of a country” refer to a further category of Torah knowledge, one that is impossible for anyone to obtain. As our sages, of blessed memory, said: “Two handbreadths of the Tablets were in the hands of the Holy One, blessed be He.”<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shemos Rabbah</i>, 28:1. The <i>Midrash</i> quoted in its entirety is: “R. Berechiah said: The length of the Tablets was six handbreadths; two were… in the hands of Him who called the world into being; two handbreadths were in the hand of Moshe, and two handbreadths separated the two pairs of hands.” It appears that the Netziv’s interpretation of this <i>Midrash</i> is that the two handbreadths held in God’s hands are symbolic of those areas of the Torah that are held only by God and cannot be made known to human beings. Similarly, these areas of the Torah are compared to God’s capital – in other words, God’s essence, to which He restricts or denies access.</i>",
                    "All of the above-noted categories are included in the Holy Torah, which is called fire. (The reason that the Torah is described as a “fire of law,” rather than a “law of fire,” [is that fire is also symbolic of the Divine nature of the Torah, which is then used by man to derive the commandments].<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Commentary of Gaon of Vilna in <i>Divrei Eliyahu</i>, as referenced by Netziv in <i>Ha’amek Davar ad loc.</i> By applying <i>gematria</i> and recombining the letters of <i>esh, dat</i> and the neighboring words in that verse, we can derive that <i>esh</i> refers to the written Torah and <i>dat</i> refers to the Talmud.</i> The <i>Midrash</i> (<i>Tanhuma, Vayeshev)</i> notes, that the Torah is a “fire of law”<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the exact translation of the Netziv’s quote from the <i>Midrash Tanhuma</i>. I have not seen the version of the <i>Midrash Tanhuma</i> from which the Netziv quotes. The version found in the current texts (Buber Edition) of the <i>Midrash Tanhuma</i> reads as follows: “The Torah scholars are guardians of the Torah, that is, a law of fire given by the One Who Is a Consuming Flame.” This version provides even greater support for the Netziv’s understanding of why the Torah is called a fire of law. The Torah is described by our version of the <i>Midrash Tanhuma</i> as the law of fire given by the Consuming Flame; therefore, the reason why it is referred to as a fire of law in Deut. is that it was given by the Consuming Flame (God).</i> and God is referred to as “a consuming fire.” See also <i>Yoma</i> 21b,<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“There are six forms of fire…. The fire that consumes fire is the <i>Shechinah</i> (the Divine Presence).”</i> [which describes God as a consuming flame]. These Talmudic statements allude to how Nahmanides wrote in the introduction to his commentary on the Torah: “The Torah consists of combinations of God’s Holy Names” – that is, [“fire” alludes to “God’s Holy Names,”] which are the root of the Torah. It is clear to me that this idea [that His Holy Names are the source of the Torah], is expressed by the verse in Shir ha-Shirim, “Your name is oil poured forth,”<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Song of Songs, 1:3.</i> meaning that the commandments are cast and formed from His Holy Names, and are symbolized by the word oil.<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See further discussion of this concept in Part 2, chapter 7.</i> See also the <i>Midrash Koheles</i> on the verse, “Your head will never lack oil,”<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Koheles, 9:8. Koheles Rabbah, 8 states: “[Let your garments always be white, and your head never lack oil.] Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai said: ‘Do not the idol worshippers have numerous white garments and oil? Rather, the verse is referring to the commandments, good deeds and the Torah.’”</i> [which compares the commandments to oil], as does the verse, “for the commandment is a lamp.”<sup>20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Prov. 6:23. The fuel of a lamp is oil.</i> [Therefore the Torah is called <i>eish-das</i>, a fire of law, because it emanates from God] as <i>esh</i> (fire) and is subsequently processed [by man] into <i>das,</i> law).<sup>21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As we shall see in Chapter 3, the law is a combination of God’s and man’s efforts.</i>"

                    "<b><small>THE RABBIS DERIVED LAWS FROM THE TORAH THAT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED AS DEFINITE TORAH LAWS</small></b><br><b><small>Translator’s introduction:</small></b><small> In this chapter, the Netziv demonstrates, using various Talmudic sources, that the rabbis derived laws from the Torah that future generations considered to be definite Torah laws. The Written Torah, referred to as <i>Torah she-bi-chesav,</i> is defined by the Oral Torah, <i>Torah she-be’al peh.</i> The latter may refer to the laws received from Moses at Sinai or to laws that were decided definitively by the courts of the previous generations.  Much of the Netziv’s basis of proof for the existence of Torah laws that were decided definitively by the rabbis revolves around the definition of the Talmudic terms “gemiri” and “halacha le-Moshe mi-Sinai.” The manner in which the various commentaries interpret these Talmudic terms is influenced by whether a particular Talmud passage cites a biblical verse as a proof text. All Rishonim accept that the Talmud will never cite a biblical verse in support of a “halacha le-Moshe mi-Sinai.”</small>  <br>   ANOTHER REASON FOR describing the Torah as an eish-das, a “fire of law”: A torch emits sparks which, when fanned or when fuel is added,<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, “joined with strengthening forces.”</i> can result in the creation of another bright torch of comparable size and brightness. [This newly formed torch] can in turn emit other sparks that generate other [torches, each one comparable in size and brightness to the first].  When the first legal dispute occurred in the time of Yehoshua, [the Sanhedrin sitting at that time] voted and resolved the disputed issue beyond doubt. The [previously disputed] issue became <i>halachah berurah</i>, no longer subject to discussion. This law became binding precedent and a foundation that enabled future generations to resolve new, contemporary issues based upon the legal precedent. [Thus, a succession of “torches” was created from the first “torch” that was received at Sinai.]",
                    "This [process] is described by the Rambam in the introduction to his commentary on the Mishnah, s.v. “<i>ve-ka’asher mes Yehoshua</i>.”<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam states there: “Regarding matters that were in dispute, the law was decided by [the vote of the] majority of the Elders…. New interpretations [and laws] were constantly formulated. The sages of each [successive] generation would treat the previous decisions as established doctrine, inferring other concepts and new laws from them. Concerning these newly accepted doctrines, there was no longer any dispute….”</i> [According to the Rambam] this is what is meant by the Talmud whenever it uses the terms <i>hilchesa gemiri lah</i> or <i>gemiri </i>[usually translated as “they have a tradition”].<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv later in this chapter will provide a different translation of <i>gemiri.</i></i>  [However], according to Rashi and Tosafos [the terms <i>hilchesa gemiri lah </i>or <i>gemiri</i>] refer to laws that have been received by Moshe from God at Mount Sinai. This can be seen from [their comments on] <i>Yoma </i>32a [which states]: “[Rav Chisda said]: <i>Gemiri,</i> [During the Yom Kippur service] the high priest performed five immersions [and ten washings from the <i>kiyor</i><sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The laver used by the priests in the Temple court.</i>].” <i>Rashi </i>there explains that [<i>gemiri </i>means] that this law had been received by Moshe from God at Mount Sinai. Tosafos [is clearly of the same opinion because they] question why a <i>baraisa</i><sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A Mishnaic-era law that was not included in the codification of the Mishnah.</i> derives this law from a Torah verse. Tosafos can only be asking this question if he assumes that the law has been received by Moshe from God at Mount Sinai [because there is a rule that with respect to such laws, no biblical verses should be cited for support]. See the beginning of <i>Mo’ed Katan</i><sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">3b.</i> in the <i>sugya </i>of the ten saplings [where this is clearly the view of Tosafos].<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Gemara in <i>Mo’ed Katan </i>3b teaches: “[The following] laws were received from Moshe at Mount Sinai: the law of shemittah applied to ten saplings [that are spread over an area the size of a <i>beis se’ah</i>], the use of the willow [on Sukkos], and the laws pertaining to water libations.” Tosafos there asks why elsewhere, in <i>Shabbos </i>103b, verses are cited as the source for the law of water libations. Tosafos answers that the verses are not used for derivation, but are merely an “asmachta,” rabbinic support rather than a derivation from a Torah source. We thus see that Tosafos is also of the opinion that a verse is not cited for the source of <i>halacha le-Moshe mi-Sinai.</i></i>",
                    "[In contrast to the way I have explained the Rambam’s definition of <i>gemiri,</i>] the Kesef Mishneh<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Kesef Mishneh </i>is R. Yosef Caro’s commentary on the Rambam’s <i>Mishneh Torah.</i> For additional information about R. Caro, see note 316 below.</i> (<i>Hilchos Shehitah </i>10:12) writes that the Rambam is also of the opinion [that <i>gemiri </i>refers to laws received by Moshe from God at Sinai]. On the basis of this [misunderstanding of the Rambam’s definition of <i>gemiri</i>], he has difficulty with the Rambam’s opinion in <i>Hilchos Tumas ha-Meis </i>(2:15, 5:11),<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tumas mes </i>is a state of ritual impurity that is communicated from dead bodies to people or objects.</i> where the Rambam writes that the laws of <i>gollel ve-dofek</i><sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the Rambam, <i>gollel ve-dofek </i>refers to building walls around a corpse with stones or vessels (dofek) and then laying upon these walls a stone, board, or vessels (gollel). The Rambam is of the opinion that if this structure is not sealed, it only transmits tumah (spiritual impurity) rabbinically via <i>ohel</i> (tent) and <i>maga</i> (touch).</i> are rabbinic.<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The difficulty is that <i>Hullin</i> 72a records a dispute between R. Yishmael, who holds that the laws of <i>gollel ve-dofek </i>are <i>hilchesa gemiri lah,</i> and R. Akiva, who derives them from verses. Assuming that <i>hilchesa gemiri lah </i>refers to laws given to Moshe from God, both opinions would hold that they are Torah laws. Both opinions thus contradict the Rambam’s view that the laws of <i>gollel ve-dofek </i>are rabbinic.</i>  [The Kesef Mishneh] explains that the Rambam follows the opinion of R. Akiva, who cites the biblical verses only as an <i>asmachta </i>[rabbinic support rather than a derivation from a Torah source].<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv will demonstrate at the end of this chapter that according to the Netziv’s understanding of the Rambam, there is no difficulty because the Rambam believes that <i>gollel ve-dofek </i>is rabbinic in origin. This is based on R. Yishmael’s use of the term <i>hilchesa gemiri lah,</i> meaning that it is not from Sinai, but merely a law decided by earlier generations.</i> But according to R. Yishmael, these laws would indeed be Torah laws. However, after careful review, you will find that in his introduction to his commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam only counts as <i>halacha le-Moshe mi-Sinai </i>those laws that the Talmud mentions explicitly as being <i>halacha le-Moshe mi-Sinai </i>or with the term <i>be-emes amru, “</i>in truth they said.” The Jerusalem Talmud in <i>Shabbos </i>(chapters 1 and 9) states that the words <i>be-emes </i>[<i>amru</i>] mean that it is a law received from Moshe at Sinai. But [according to the Rambam] whenever the term <i>hilchesa gemiri lah </i>or <i>gemiri </i>is used, it is not referring to a law received from Moshe at Sinai, but rather to a law that has been received from previous generations, back to the generation that established that law. According to the Rambam, the term <i>gemiri </i>is related to the term <i>nimnu ve-gamru</i><sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, “they voted and decided definitively.” <i>Gamru </i>is derived from the same root as <i>gemiri.</i></i> [which means that the law had been decided definitively for all time].",
                    "Thus, the Rambam states in <i>Hilchos Nizkei Mammon </i>(2:3) that the law of <i>hatzi nezek tzeroros</i><sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This law states that if an animal kicks a rock that strikes a vessel and breaks it, the owner of the animal is liable for only half of the damages. See <i>Bava Kamma </i>3b, which states that this law is <i>hilchesa gemiri lah.</i></i> is “<i>halacha mi-pi kabbalah</i>,” a law that has been received [from previous generations] and not as Rashi interprets it in <i>Bava Kamma </i>3b (s.v. “<i>hatzi nezek tzeroros</i>”), that it is a law that Moshe received from God at Mount Sinai.<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi is thus being consistent with his interpretation of <i>hilchesa gemiri lah.</i></i>  In <i>Hilchos Shabbos </i>(12:8) the Rambam writes: “We have learned <i>mi-pi ha-shemuah </i>[on the basis of tradition received from a previous generation]<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">However, the Talmudic Encyclopedia states that when the Rambam uses the terms <i>mi-pi ha-shemuah </i>or <i>mi-pi kabbalah,</i> he is referring to a law received from Sinai as opposed to a received tradition. The encyclopedia fails to mention that this understanding of the Rambam contradicts the view of the Netziv, which is also the position of the Havos Yair, which is cited later in this chapter.</i> that if one carries an object a total of four cubits in a public domain [he is just as liable as one who carries an object from one domain to another <i>– </i>the penalty is capital punishment if it was done intentionally and a sin offering if it was unintentional].” Here, too, the Talmud uses the expression <i>hilchesa gemiri lah </i>[which the Rambam understands as being a tradition received from a previous court’s ruling, as opposed to being a law received from Moshe at Sinai].<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A tradition does not go back to Mount Sinai, but rather to the generation that definitively decided the law.</i>",
                    "Further [in <i>Sukkah </i>5b, the Talmud explicitly mentions that the law of partitions was received from Moshe at Sinai], <i>Sukkah </i>6b [states] that according to R. Meir “the rule that [the laws of partitions are <i>halacha le-Moshe mi-Sinai</i>] includes the legal fictions of extension [<i>lavud</i>], junction [<i>gud</i>], and curved wall [<i>dofen akumah</i>].”<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These three laws consider the walls as extending beyond their physical parameters.</i> [Several lines later] the Talmud discusses the rule which allows [one wall of a sukkah<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is a disagreement between R. Shimon and the rabbis as to whether a sukkah is required to have three or four walls. If one of the walls of a sukkah is only a single handbreadth wide, the wall is viewed as if it extends beyond its physical parameters and reaches the neighboring walls.</i> to be] a <i>tefach </i>wide. This law of <i>tefach</i>, the Talmud notes, is <i>hilchesa </i>[although it does not list the law of <i>tefach </i>together with the previously cited laws of partitions that were received by Moshe from God at Sinai]. Rashi [on <i>Sukkah </i>6b] (s.v. “<i>hilchesa</i>”) explains that when the Talmud previously mentions [in <i>Sukkah </i>5b] that the law of partitions are <i>halacha le-Moshe mi-Sinai</i>, it also includes the law of <i>tefach</i>.

                    "In fact [by reviewing the references to <i>gemiri</i>] in many places [throughout the Talmud], one is compelled to accept that [<i>gemiri</i>] does not refer to a law received from Moshe at Mount Sinai. See <i>Nazir </i>4b<sup>21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv cites 5b.</i> [which proves that the book of <i>Shoftim </i>relates], according to which Shimshon intentionally became impure by having contact with the dead by <i>gemara gemiri lah</i>.<sup>22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An act of killing in battle, not in self-defense, proves that he did not have the same status as a true Nazirite. One bound by the Nazirite vow sets himself apart for Divine service. He must abstain from all products of the vine, including grapes, and from intoxicating drinks, avoid proximity with dead bodies, and let his hair grow.</i> [After attempting to find sources from the book of <i>Shoftim</i>,<sup>23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verses are “With the jawbone of a donkey I have killed a thousand men” (Judges 15:16) and “He went down to Ashkelon and killed thirty men of them, and he took their clothing” (ibid. 14:19). The Talmud mentions that perhaps Shimshon avoided having contact with the dead by throwing the jawbone of the donkey, or that he took their clothing before killing them.</i> the Talmud concludes (<i>Nazir </i>4b) that these sources are inconclusive and the only way we know that Shimshon did defile himself with the dead is by tradition. [A tradition received from Moshe at Sinai could not possibly be used to provide an interpretation of a verse in a book of the Prophets which was written so much later than the time of Moshe.]<sup>24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The wording of the Netziv implies that he is following the interpretation of Tosafos on <i>Nazir </i>4b, s.v. “<i>ela gemara gemiri lah.</i>”</i> In addition, [the Gemara in] <i>Berachos </i>28a states, “<i>Gemiri</i>, that we may promote [a person or thing] to a higher grade of sanctity, but we must not downgrade.” Yet we see in <i>Menahos </i>99a that this same principle [not to downgrade] is derived from a Torah verse [and because a scriptural source is not cited when it is a law received from Sinai, this principle cannot have come from Moshe at Sinai]. Furthermore, in <i>Hullin </i>9b, the Talmud notes “<i>gemiri</i>” [regarding the law that when there is a doubt if something became defiled in a public area, it is deemed to be pure]. Yet this ruling is derived from the laws of <i>sotah<sup>25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A woman suspected of committing adultery who was required to drink the bitter waters (see Devarim 5:12–31).</i></i> [and if it is a law received from Moshe at Mount Sinai, there would be no need to derive it from the laws of <i>sotah</i>]. See also <i>Kiddushin </i>37a, noting [that according to the first opinion stated in the Mishnah], the laws of <i>orlah</i><sup>26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The fruit of a tree during the first three years after the tree was planted, which may not be eaten.</i> and <i>kela’im</i><sup>27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The forbidden mixing of heterogeneous plants (see <i>Vayikra </i>19:19).</i> are not applicable outside the Land of Israel [and that this law] is <i>hilchesa gemiri lah. </i>Yet Shmuel [in <i>Kiddushin </i>38a] is of the opinion that these [same laws] are <i>hilchesa medinah </i>[a law that people of the provinces had voluntarily accepted upon themselves, which obviously occurred after the time of Moshe].[It is clear that after analyzing the use of the term <i>hilchesa gemiri lah </i>and variations thereof in various parts of the Talmud, the phrase cannot possibly mean a law received from Moshe at Sinai.] This [observation that <i>hilchesa gemiri lah </i>refers to a tradition from previous generations rather than a law that was received from Moshe at Sinai] has also been noted in the responsa of the <i>Havos Yair </i>(ch. 192) and in the <i>Tosafos Yom Tov </i>on <i>Sotah </i>2:2.",
                    "[I do not mean to suggest,] Heaven forbid, that these [Talmudic references] were unknown to Rashi and Tosafos. But they did not find them problematic [because, according to Rashi and Tosafos, at times the Talmud will refer to something as having come from God at Sinai, in the sense that the law in question is as definite as a law that God gave at Sinai even though it was not actually given there]. This idea is also found in the Rosh in the first chapter of <i>Hilchos Mikva’os </i>in the name of Rabbenu Tam. The Talmud [<i>Shabbos </i>11a] states, “<i>Be-emes amru </i>that on Friday night, a teacher may look at a book near a lamp if the students are reading it, but must not read it himself.” [Since this law is a rabbinic decree],<sup>28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is a decree against reading by the light of an oil lamp lest one tip the lamp, thereby becoming liable for feeding a flame on Shabbos. The Gemara states that this decree is waived for a teacher supervising children who are reading by the light of a lamp.</i> it obviously cannot be a law that Moshe received from God at Sinai. Yet the Jerusalem Talmud states, “<i>Be-emes amru” </i>refers to a law that Moshe received from God at Sinai!<sup>29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Shabbos</i>, chapters 1 and 9.</i> [The Rosh, quoting Rabbenu Tam, answers that] the proper understanding [of this Talmudic statement in <i>Shabbos </i>is] that this law is as definitive as if Moshe had received it from God at Sinai.",
                    "See also the Rash<sup>30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rash is the acronym for R. Shimshon of Sens (1150–1230), a teacher, Tosafist, and halachist whose teachers included the Ri and Rabbenu Tam. All Talmudic editions of the orders <i>Zera’im </i>and <i>Taharos,</i> for which no Babylonian Talmud exists, incorporate R. Shimshon’s comprehensive Mishnah commentary.</i> on the fourth chapter of tractate <i>Yadayim </i>[which states that the law that <i>ma’aser ani </i>be taken during <i>shemittah</i>] in the regions of Ammon and Moav is a <i>halachah le-Moshe mi-Sinai.</i> [The Rash explains that although this is rabbinic, it is as definite as if it had been received at Sinai.] [It can be demonstrated that] Rashi [is of the same opinion as the Rosh and Rash]. See <i>Sukkah </i>38b [where Rashi explains the term] “<i>be-emes amru</i>” to mean that “there is no disagreement” [in other words, it is as definite as if it had been received from Moshe at Sinai]. See also <i>Rashi</i>, <i>Bava Metzia </i>60 (s.v. “<i>be-emes amru</i>”), [which says] that this term means “without hesitation.”",
                    "But according to the Rambam, this [term, <i>be-emes amru</i>, signifies that it is a law <i>actually </i>received from Moshe at Sinai and] is to be taken literally. See what I have written on the <i>She’iltos </i>(137:2) for a more detailed explanation.<sup>31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv explains there that according to the Rambam, Moshe issued guidelines for future rabbinic decrees prohibiting one from reading by lamplight on Shabbos and the laws of <i>shemittah </i>and <i>ma’aser ani </i>pertaining to the regions of Ammon and Moav. Thus, the term <i>be-emes amru </i>or <i>halacha le-Moshe mi-Sinai</i> would apply to these rabbinic laws. See <i>Ha’amek Davar,</i> Devarim 11:1, where the Netziv hypothesizes that Moshe actually enacted certain rabbinic laws for his generation only (for example, the law against reading by a lamp on Shabbos). When later courts reissued the decree, they followed the guidelines that were established in Moshe’s earlier enactment.</i> Therefore, one is compelled to [conclude that the Rambam’s understanding of the Talmudic usage] of the terms <i>hilchesa gemiri lah </i>and <i>gemiri </i>is not that they are laws received from Moshe at Sinai [but instead are laws that] have been received [from previous generations] which have been decided definitively, leaving no doubt. It seems that conclusive proof can be found for Rashi’s understanding of [<i>gemiri </i>as being a law received by Moshe from God at Sinai] from <i>Menachos </i>92b. [In <i>Menachos, </i>we learn that R. Yehuda maintains that the he-goats brought as atonement offerings for the sin of idolatry (when the entire congregation committed idolatry due to an erroneous ruling of the Sanhedrin) do not require <i>semichah,</i> the laying of hands on the sacrifice before slaughter. R. Yehuda proceeds to derive this law from a verse.] The Talmud asks why R. Yehuda requires a verse to exclude from <i>semichah</i> the he-goat brought as an atonement offering for idolatry, since Ravina has said that “gemiri” only two communal sacrifices require <i>semichah </i>[namely, the cow offered by the congregation for other sins besides idolatry and the goat sent to Azazel on Yom Kippur]. [The Gemara answers that the verse is cited only as a textual allusion but not a true derivation. Rashi explains that R. Yehuda was citing a scriptural allusion to his ruling, but he does not need to derive it from this verse, since it is <i>gemiri.</i>] Thus, the Gemara appears to be saying that <i>gemiri </i>refers to something revealed to Moshe, for which no verse is needed.",

                    "[Returning to the previous discussion of] <i>gollel ve-dofek </i>[the reason for the Rambam’s opinion that this law is of rabbinic origin] is that he holds in accordance with R.

The dispute, however, is which Talmudic terminology refers to these laws. According to the Rambam, whenever the Talmud cites hilchesa gemiri lah (or any of its variations), it is referring to these definitive rabbinically-derived laws. According to Rashi and Tosafos, in the majority of instances when hilchesa gemiri lah is cited by the Talmud, it refers to a law received by Moshe from God at Sinai. However, in a minority of cases they believe that the terms hilchesa gemiri lah and be-emes amru refer to rabbinic laws that are as definite as if those laws had been received at Sinai. The Netziv appears to prefer the Rambam’s approach, because the latter’s definition of those terms is more direct and accords better with the simple meaning of the texts of the Talmud.</small>"

                    "<b><small> IT IS GOD’S WILL FOR MAN TO DERIVE TORAH LAWS</small></b><br>[IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER, we saw that there are laws received from previous generations that are undisputed and treated as definitive, binding upon future generations]. It appears that Tractate <i>Megillah</i> 19b is referring to such laws when it states: “The Holy One, blessed be He, revealed to Moshe <i>dikdukei sof’rim,</i> meticulous exegesis by the scholars. The Midrash<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> on <i>Shemos</i>, <i>parasha</i> 1: “The Holy One, blessed be He, revealed to Moshe at that time even the questions that students would ask their rabbis.” <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> on <i>Vayikra</i>, <i>parasha</i> 22 states: “Even that which a distinguished student would say before his rabbi was revealed to Moshe at Mount Sinai.”</i> asserts that God revealed to Moshe what distinguished scholars would originate in the future. It is impossible to say that the Midrash intended [to suggest that what was revealed to Moshe] was mere questions and dialectics by future scholars that did not result in a lasting resolution of issues, and which had no practical outcome. Rather, it must be [that what was revealed to Moshe] were [laws] that distinguished scholars would advance so authoritatively that there would be no room for disagreement. See <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> on Koheles (chapter 1), [where the text does not read “<i>le-hadesh</i>,” to originate], but “<i>le-horos</i>,” to teach or rule, which supports what I have written. See also the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Pe’ah</i>, chapter 2,<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Halachah 4. Tractate <i>Peah</i> is similar to the <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> on Koheles, as both state that it was revealed to Moshe what the future scholars would teach as law.</i> [which is similar to another statement further] in tractate <i>Megillah</i>, [“God showed Moshe <i>dikdukei soferim”</i>] and all that the Sages are destined <i>le-hadesh</i>, and this refers to the reading of the Scroll of Esther. [We thus see that the term <i>le-hadesh</i>] refers to new laws that leave no room for doubt.",
                    "This helps us to explain [a difficult passage] in <i>Gittin</i> (60b): “I [God] have written for him [Israel] the major parts of My Torah, [but] they have been regarded as foreign.”<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hosea 8:12</i> R. Elazar said: The majority of the Torah are written, and only a minority are oral. R. Yohanan said: The majority are oral, and only a minority are written. […That verse is to be understood as a question: “Should I have written for him the major parts of My Torah? But even (the parts) that I have written have been regarded as foreign!”]",
                    "This debate is difficult to comprehend, for it is obvious that the Written Law is but a very small percentage of Torah Law. However, the proper understanding [of the dispute] is as follows: It is surely impossible to suggest that the Holy One, blessed be He, would record in the Written Torah all the questions and arguments [that might arise in the future]. Nor would it be possible [to argue] that [God] would record all the details of every law that could be subject to doubt or differences of opinion.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv understands Written Law to be the Torah, and Oral Law as definite laws decided by the rabbis. In <i>Meromei Sadeh</i>, he rejects Rashi’s interpretation that the Written Law refers to laws that have been derived through the thirteen hermeneutical principles with which the Written Law may be expounded, while the Oral Law refers to those laws that have no Scriptural basis and were transmitted to Moshe orally as <i>halachah le-Moshe mi-Sinai</i>. There the Netziv argues that it would be obvious to all that those defined as <i>halachah le-Moshe mi-Sinai </i>would be significantly fewer.</i> [The fact that there is room for differing interpretations of the Torah] is clearly stated in Tractate <i>Eduyos</i>, 1:5: “[If the law is decided according to the majority], why are the minority views mentioned? Because a later court may decide to rule in accordance with the minority opinion, and thus it will be able to use that opinion as a support.” Moreover, it is written in <i>Soferim</i>, 16:5 — Rabbi Tanhum ben Hanilai said, “If the Torah had been given [to Israel] consisting solely of clearly decided laws, a halachic authority would lack the necessary flexibility to render appropriate decisions. But now [that the Torah does not give clear-cut interpretations,] if [a judge or rabbi] were to decide to declare something unclean [for good reasons,]<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Later in this chapter, the Netziv refers to flexibility in emergency situations – times of great stress and hardship. There are specific rules concerning when to apply emergency rulings and who is qualified to rule on such matters (See Rambam, <i>Mishnah</i> Torah, <i>Sanhedrin</i> Chapter 24 and <i>Shulhan Aruch</i>, <i>Hoshen Mishpat</i>, s<i>iman</i> 2). Matters involving endangerment are covered by the general rule of <i>pikuah nefesh</i> (see <i>Kesubos</i> 19a and <i>Yoma</i> 82a) where the requirement to save a life almost always supersedes even explicit Torah law, and they are not discussed in the text.</i> [he would have] opinions on which he could rely; or if he should decide to declare something clean, [for good reasons,] he will have opinions upon which he can rely.” See [also] <i>Parah</i> 7:7, that a temporary [emergency] order was issued for rendering valid [the water that was drawn for purification purposes].<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Those preparing the waters of lustration that were to be combined with ashes of the red heifer were not allowed to perform work during the ceremony of preparing the mixture. Due to the difficulties of the time, one was allowed to wrap the rope from the bucket that was used to draw the water, even though one was performing work by doing so.</i> The debate [in <i>Gittin</i>] only refers to those laws for which there can be no doubt or disagreement. It is thus very reasonable for there to be a difference of opinion as to whether the majority of laws are written or oral.",
                    "<b><small>Translator’s note:</small></b><small> For the remainder of this chapter, the Netziv will be using a disagreement between Rashi and Tosafos in Tractate Niddah in order to explain the underlying rationale for the disagreement between R. Yohanan and R. Elazar of the number of definite laws. The Mishnah in Niddah 7a–b records a disagreement between R. Elazar and the rabbis as to whether a young woman who menstruates after having missed three consecutive menstrual periods is considered a niddah, ritually impure: only from the time she sees the blood, or twenty-four hours retroactively from the time she saw it. According to R. Elazar, she transfers tum’ah, ritual contamination, only from the time that she sees blood, whereas according to the rabbis she does so twenty-four hours retroactively from the time that she saw blood. In Tractates Eruvin 46a and Niddah 6a–b, it mentions that in one particular case, Rebbi ruled in accordance with the lenient opinion of R. Elazar. After issuing this ruling, he recalled that R. Elazar’s opinion was a lone opinion and that he should have ruled in accordance with the rabbis. After further thought, Rebbi concluded that even though he should have ruled differently, he was not going to reverse his ruling, since we can rely on the opinion of R. Elazar in times of pressing need. The Talmud notes that if the halachah had been decided in accordance with the rabbis (it was not a merely a disagreement between a lone authority and the rabbis), he would indeed have reversed his ruling, even in times of pressing need.It is possible to add [that this disagreement is actually the basis of] the dispute between Rashi and Tosafos in <i>Eruvin</i> 46a and <i>Niddah</i> 7b, found in the Tosafos s.v. “<i>lismoch alav be-she’as hadehak</i>.” Rashi defines “pressing need,” as “a year of famine.”<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">By rendering food <i>tameh</i> (unclean), less food was available.</i> However, Tosafos questions Rashi’s interpretation, because, [in <i>Niddah</i> 9b], the rabbis themselves say “no [halachic] proof can be brought from [how the previous generations decided, as it was] a time of need [famine].”<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Elazar attempted to prove that his opinion accords with how the previous generations ruled in a specific case. The Rabbis retorted that although the previous generations did believe that we should apply retroactive <i>tumah</i>, they waived the retroactive enactment because they were experiencing a scarcity of food.</i> [In other words, the rabbis agree that at a time when food is scarce, we may waive the enactment of contamination]. Therefore, even if the <i>halachah </i>was decided in accordance with the rabbis, it would not affect his ruling.<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Therefore, in Tractate <i>Niddah</i>, 9b, Tosafos offers two alternative explanations of what “time of need” means. One of the explanations is that the individual who asked the question had left the area and had already traveled a significant distance, which would have required Rebbi or his messengers to exert much effort to find that individual so as to notify her that the <i>halachah</i> is in accordance with the rabbis.</i></small>",
                    "We must explain Rashi as follows: [In the previous generation], prior to the disagreement between R. Elazar and the Rabbis, they [as noted in <i>Niddah</i> 9b] judged leniently in times of pressing need; the law was not decided definitively. However, once the disputed opinions had been voted upon and decided, one could no longer rely on the opinion of R. Elazar, even in a time of pressing need.",
                    "Similarly, with respect to the [previously stated] mishnah in <i>Parah,</i> in order to prevent substantial loss, a temporary [ruling] validated [water drawn for purification purposes]. Now that a definite ruling was decided in accordance with those authorities who invalidate drawn water, one may no longer render the water valid in times of pressing need.",
                    "Thus, we see that according to Rashi, once a law has been decided upon, we may no longer apply the rule of following the minority in times of pressing need. Therefore we may ask, regarding [definitive laws that have been voted upon,] why where they not written in the Torah. The definite oral laws are more numerous than actually written. This is the opinion of R. Yohanan, who interprets the verse [in Hosea] as a question: [“Should I have written the majority of My Torah for him when even they regard the minimal parts that I have written as foreign?”]",
                    "However, according to Tosafos, [even after the halachos have been brought to a vote and decided upon,] they are not considered definite, and we may still follow the minority view temporarily or in time of pressing need. The question [of why certain laws were not written by God] is limited to the laws for which there is complete agreement among the rabbis, as only these are considered to be laws that are absolutely definite. According to this opinion these laws are less in number than what is written explicitly in the Torah.<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Elazar agrees with R. Yohanan that God wanted to minimize the earlier generations’ transgressions. However, according to R. Elazar the verse is translated as: “Though I write the majority of My Laws for him, they consider them foreign.”</i> This is the opinion of R. Elazar: “The majority of definite laws are written.”",
                    "The <i>halachah</i> in this matter follows R. Yohanan. Such is the opinion of Rambam and the Shulhan Aruch, who never cite any tannaitic disagreements. This is meant to teach us that once the halachah has been decided, there is no longer any practical reason [for citing the minority opinion]."

Though a rabbi [or judge] must decide as his eyes see,<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A judge or halachic authority must render decisions based on what appears to him to be correct at the time, and not be concerned that he may err and be punished by God (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 6b).</i> and with God’s help decides properly, they [the rabbis of Levi] did not establish the law for future generations. They did not support their decisions with such analytical power that would make it impossible to deviate from their rulings. They did not decide definite laws.",
                    "The strengths of [the scholars of] Yehuda were just the opposite, because their reasoning did not permit them to arrive at the truth so readily. However, [this weakness turned out] to be their strength [because they were forced] to render decisions only after thorough analysis and debate, so that they would bring to light such clearly defined laws that it would be impossible not to follow them. That is why Yehuda is referred to as a <i>mehokek</i> [legislator], because a <i>mehokek</i> weighs [the issues] and excavates by the spring of wisdom [and thereby] produces and clarifies the law. Pertaining to the verse, “His teeth are whiter than milk,”<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gen. 49:12.</i> the rabbis expounded in <i>Bereshis Rabbah</i> (chapter 98) that the Rabbis [of Yehuda] study in groups of two<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Both <i>shinnayim</i>, meaning “teeth,” and <i>shenayim,</i> meaning “two” or “both” have the same letters, and vary only in their pronunciation.</i> and systematize the laws, thereby producing results that are as pure as milk, which results in <i>hok lo ya’avor</i>,<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The words <i>hok</i> and <i>mehokek</i> are derived from the same Hebrew root.</i> immutable laws.",
                    "Similar [is the intent] of the verse, “The scepter shall not depart from Yehuda nor the legislator from between his feet.” [This should be translated instead as, “The scepter shall not depart from Yehuda, nor he who legislates from between his feet], as the words ‘between his feet’ pertain to the legislator, [not to Yehuda].”<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv is making two points regarding the verse: that <i>mehokek</i> is to be translated as “legislator” and not “scepter,” and that “between his feet,” refers to the <i>mehokek</i>, “legislator,” rather than Judah. See <i>Ha’amek Davar,</i> Gen. 49:12, where this is elaborated on in more detail.</i> [This indicates that the <i>mehokek</i>, who develops new laws, does so “from between his feet” – that is, with the assistance of his students.] The most effective means of clarifying the law is through analyses by groups of scholars [in study] and their debates by and with the students. In those days, the rabbi or teacher would sit on a bench, and the students would sit before him on the ground, as it is written in Tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i> 17b: “He, [the teacher], would judge cases before them [the students, who were sitting on the ground before him].” In Tractate <i>Bava Metzia</i> 84b, it is written that “Rabban Shimeon, the son of Gamliel, and R. Yehoshua, the son of Korcha, were sitting on benches, while R. Elazar, the son of R. Shimeon, and Rebbi, were sitting before them on the ground, whereupon they [R. Shimeon and Rebbi] raised questions and answered them.” [This illustrates] that the phrase, “he who legislates from between his feet,” [refers to studying with others and debating with students]. Further, it states in Tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i> 5a that “‘he who legislates from between his feet’ refers to the descendants of Hillel, who teach Torah in public, and to students who, through debate, bring the laws to light.”",
                    "This [description] can reconcile [an apparent] contradiction between two Talmudic discussions. In Tractate <i>Yoma</i> 26a [it states that Yehuda cannot decide according to the accepted <i>halachah</i>], whereas in Tractate <i>Bava Kamma</i> 92 [it states that by means of Moshe’s prayer for Yehuda’s soul, Yehuda could decide according to the accepted <i>halachah</i>], as suggested in the verse, “May You [God] help him [Yehuda] against his enemies.”<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It states in <i>Yoma</i>: “Rava said, ‘You will not find Torah scholars who decide the law except those who issue from the tribe of Levi or from the tribe of Issachar.’ We know this is true of Levi because it is written: ‘They [Levi] shall teach Your ordinances to Jacob [the people of Israel]…. But is this also true of Judah, for it is written: ‘Judah is my lawgiver.’ Rava answers: ‘I was referring to scholars [of Levi] who conclude legal discussions in accordance with the accepted halachah.’” It is to be inferred from <i>Yoma</i> that Judah did not decide the accepted halachah. However, <i>Bava Kamma</i> relates that Moshe had prayed that Judah’s soul, which initially could not decide the accepted halachah, [would be able to do so in the heavenly court]. The rabbis there in <i>Bava Kamma</i> explain the verse, “May You help him [Judah] against his enemies,” as meaning that through Moshe’s blessing, Judah was able to decide the accepted halachah, contrary to what is stated in Tractate <i>Yoma</i>.</i> (One could answer that <i>Bava Kamma </i>is discussing Yehuda [himself] and his status in the Heavenly Court, [whereas <i>Yoma </i>discusses the halachic decisions of the tribe of Yehuda]. However, it is clear that also Moshe’s prayer for Yehuda’s soul was to affect the character of his descendants who sit in the earthly courts).<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Moshe’s blessings for Judah should be no different than the blessings for the other tribes that are related to their descendants. See <i>Toras Moshe</i> to Deut. 16:18, where the Chasam Sofer notes how each of the 12 tribes’ unique strength in applying judgement emanated from 12 different sources in heaven. Thus Judah and his descendants would have to be similar in their manner of determining halacha.</i> But [the real reason that there is no contradiction between <i>Yoma</i> and <i>Bava Kamma</i>] is because [<i>Yoma</i> is concerned with individual decisions rendered by scholars without benefit of debate with their colleagues, whereas <i>Bava Kamma</i>] is stating that the <i>halachah</i> is established in accordance with the [Rabbis of Yehuda], only after deep analysis and debate together with colleagues. Tractate <i>Makkos</i> 11b [validates my interpretation of <i>Bava Kamma</i>] where it says that [Yehuda himself was unable to answer their questions, after which Moshe prayed for him], “May You help him against his enemies.”<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 33:7.</i> [This implies that it was specifically when Yehuda was “answering questions,” i.e., involved in debating students, where Moshe’s prayer had an effect in bolstering Yehuda’s ability in decision making]. But without the means of debate and analysis, that is applying on-the-spot decision making as questions arose, Yehuda was incapable of deciding in accordance with the accepted <i>halachah</i>.",
                    "[These two types of decision-making – practical decision making, and legislation that establishes the <i>halacha</i> for generations] – is described in the Torah portion about the rebellious scholar.<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to an acknowledged, ordained sage who is qualified to sit on the Sanhedrin, but who defies the decision of the majority and rules that it is permitted to act contrary to the Sanhedrin’s decision.</i> There it states: “If there is a man [who is ordained and sits on the Great Sanhedrin]<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 87a.</i> who rebels and refuses to listen to the <i>Kohen</i> [priest] who is in charge of serving God your Lord there, or to the <i>shofet</i> [judge]….”<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 17:12.</i> This [verse] is cryptic, for why would a <i>Kohen</i> be involved in legislation? If the word “<i>kohen</i>” is referring to the head of the court, let the verse describe him as a <i>shofet</i>.",
                    "The explanation is that [when the word “<i>kohen</i>” is used, it] refers to situations when the court does not have the opportunity to clarify the question through analysis and debate, and the judges merely rule according to what they see as appropriate at that time. [The word “<i>kohen</i>”] denotes that in those situations the courts may rely on Heavenly support from within the Temple and the [Heavenly revelation that unfolds] through the merit of the high priest who is in a constant state of readiness to serve God in holiness. For the Torah gave [the High Priest] the unique privilege of adjudicating, as it is written, “[You, Aharon,<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Or any other high priest.</i> will also be able] to render decisions for Israel [in all the laws that God has taught you through Moshe].”<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lev. 10:11.</i> However, when the law is resolved through the power of the head of the Sanhedrin, who through his wisdom decides the <i>halachah</i> [for all] generations, [that kind of decision-making process is referred to in the verse] by use of the word s<i>hofet</i>.<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv elaborates further in Part 3, chapter 6.</i>",
                    "<b><small>Translator’s note:</small></b><small> In the remaining paragraphs of this chapter, the Netziv will be addressing the opinion of R. Eliezer ben Yaakov, which can be viewed as a potential objection to his definition of “shofet.” </small> <br>You should not object [to my interpretation], from what is stated in Tractates <i>Sotah</i> 44b and <i>Sanhedrin</i> 14b, where R. Eliezer ben Yaakov derives that a high priest may also be referred to as a <i>shofet</i> [from the verse] “You must approach the scholarly priests and the <i>shofet</i> who are alive at that time.”<sup>20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 17:9. <i>Kohanim ha-Levi’im</i> has been translated as explained in <i>Ha’amek Davar</i> on Deut. 10:8.</i> Thus, we see that the word <i>shofet</i> also refers to the high priest.",
                    "However, this is not a question at all, for R. Eliezer ben Yaakov says that the verse, “You must approach the scholarly priests <i>and</i> the <i>shofet</i> who are alive at that time”<sup>21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to R. Eliezer the verse is translated as follows: “You must approach the scholarly priests together with the <i>shofet</i>.”</i> implies appearing before all the members of the court, meaning the Sanhedrin, together with the most distinguished judge among them being referred to as a <i>shofet</i>. Most courts were valid even though they consisted of judges from various tribes. However, ordinarily they consisted mainly of priests and Levites,<sup>22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The priests were associated with the court since they were supported by the community and could therefore devote their time to Torah study. See <i>Ha’amek Davar,</i> Deut. 10:8.</i> and therefore it is understandable that [according to R. Eliezer ben Yaakov], the word <i>shofet</i> in that verse refers to the most distinguished member of the priests of the Sanhedrin – i.e., the <i>Kohen Gadol</i> [the High Priest]. [However], the other [previously cited] verse<sup>23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 17:12 regarding the rebellious judge.</i> states, “If there is a man<sup>24</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sanhedrin</i> 87a applies this to an individual who is ordained and qualified to be sitting on the Great Sanhedrin.</i> who rebels and refuses to listen to the <i>kohen</i> who is <i>in charge of serving the Lord your God </i>there, <i>or </i>to the <i>shofet</i>….”<sup>25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word “or” indicates that the <i>kohen</i> is separate from the <i>shofet</i>.</i> It is the priest who is charged with “serving God,” not [functioning as a] <i>shofet,</i> and therefore the word <i>shofet</i> in that verse must refer to [judges from] other tribes. One can further explain that according to R. Eliezer ben Yaakov, [<i>shofet</i>] is [to be translated as] “most outstanding judge,” which includes the two types of outstanding judges: the High Priest [who renders decisions with special Divine assistance] or a Judge from a tribe other than Levi [who legislates with deep analysis and debate].<sup>26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse is to be translated as “You must approach [the Sanhendrin] consisting of the scholarly priests, together with the most outstanding judge….”</i> [Thus, R. Eliezer ben Yaakov would agree that <i>shofet</i> in Deut. 17:12 is representative of the process of legistlation.]",
                    "One should note, however, that in the <i>Sifrei</i><sup>27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Pesikta 20.</i> on the Torah portion of <i>Shofetim,</i><sup>28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See note 20.</i> [<i>shofet</i> always refers to judges who are not from the tribe of Levi]. There the <i>Sifrei</i> states that it is a <i>mitzvah</i><sup>29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The mitzvah is to have Levites and Priests <i>ab initio.</i></i> to have a court consisting of judges from the priests and Levites. Therefore, one could argue that if a court is lacking priests and Levites, it is an invalid court. However, Scripture in the portion of <i>Shofetim</i> uses the word s<i>hofet </i>to teach us that even a court lacking priests and Levites is valid. It is thus clear that my interpretation of the word <i>shofet</i> is [in accordance with the majority of the <i>Tannaim</i>, who disagree with] R. Eliezer ben Yaakov, [because the <i>Sifrei</i>] cites its interpretation of <i>shofet</i> anonymously.<sup>30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Rambam in his Introduction to the <i>Mishnah:</i> that a particular <i>mishnah</i> or <i>baraisa</i> that cites a halachah anonymously indicates agreement among all or most authorities.</i> [Thus according to most authorities, s<i>hofet</i> always refers to the legislation process and excludes the tribe of Levi]."

The <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> 34, on the Torah portion of <i>Terumah</i>, explains that those who were involved in making the Ark would merit achieving Torah knowledge. As the <i>Midrash</i> informs us that by stating: “<i>They </i>shall make the Ark,”<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ex. 25:10.</i> Scripture teaches us the significance of inviting everyone to work on the Ark: “R. Yehuda the son of Shalom said: ‘The Holy One, blessed be He, said: ‘Let <i>all</i> come and participate in the making of the Ark so that they may <i>all</i> merit in achieving Torah [knowledge].’” Betzalel, who descended from Yehuda, merited knowledge of the Torah more [than all the others who participated in the work], and for this reason the [Torah] says, “Betzalel made the Ark”<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ex. 37:1.</i> [even though others participated in its construction]. For although [Betzalel] worked with others in order to build the Ark, he rose above the others [because of his special contribution to its construction].<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi on this verse cites <i>Midrash Tanhuma</i> 10: “Because he (Bezalel) devoted himself to the work [of the Ark] more than the other wise men, it is called by his name.”</i> However, once the Ark was completed, [Betzalel of Yehuda] was no longer involved with the service [of the Ark].<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv views Bezalel’s work in creating the Ark as a service.</i> It was transferred to the Levites, who were responsible for bearing the Ark containing [the Torah]<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Ha’amek She’eilah</i> 58:9, where the Netziv writes that the Tablets contained the entire Torah.</i> and setting it in its proper place<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezra 2:68.</i> so that the Torah would fulfill the ultimate purpose for which it was intended.",
                    "Analogously, so it has been for generations – that Yehuda would be the legislators, who were then followed by the Levites, who would utilize [Yehuda’s] decisions by judging individual cases as they would arise, or by issuing decrees as the [needs of] changing times arose. The Levites would instruct [others so] that the ultimate purpose for which the Torah was intended would be realized.<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv writes in <i>Ha’amek Davar</i> on Ex. 27:20 and Lev. 16:16 that the Ark provided special assistance to Aaron and the tribe of Levi to derive <i>halachic</i> decisions by applying their method of comparative logic as described in chapter 4. In contrast, those such as Judah, who derive halachah through the process of pilpul, were assisted by the Divine light emitted by the Menorah.</i>",
                    "[On a lesser scale, the other tribes also legislated, such] as Oholiav of the tribe of Dan, who made many special contributions to the Tabernacle. [This suggests] that Dan also contributed to the development of law in particular areas, that is, monetary matters. And this is what Scripture [implies when it] writes: “Dan shall judge his nation, [in a manner similar to] the unique tribe of Israel,”<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gen. 49:16.</i> [referring to] Yehuda. Just as Yehuda [legislates] concerning <i>all</i> areas of the Torah, similarly, Dan, when issuing certain legislation, would also delve very deeply into the [Torah to arrive at the proper] <i>halachah </i>concerning monetary cases. [Thus, what Yehuda did for <i>all halachah</i>, Dan did in a specialized area.

He therefore explains that Osniel’s analysis was so powerful that his derivations were seen as equal to that which was received from Moshe at Sinai.</i>",
                    "<b><small>Translator’s note:</small></b><small> In the next few paragraphs, the Netziv will be proving his explanation of Tractate Temurah by clarifying R. Elazar’s opinion in Tractate Yoma.</small> In Tractate <i>Yoma</i> 80a, it is stated: “R. Elazar said: ‘If one has eaten forbidden fat in these times [when there is no Temple], he must note the quantity, because another rabbinical court may come and increase the measures.”<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Elazar suggested that if the Sanctuary were to be rebuilt and a new rabbinical court established, it might decide to increase the measures. Therefore, one who is aware of having eaten tallow should take the precaution of putting down the exact quantity so as to be sure that his transgression does not entail a sin offering in accord with the new enactment.</i> [The Gemara continues that] R. Yohanan had stated that “standard measures and penalties are fixed by laws [communicated] to Moshe at Sinai.” A <i>Baraisa</i> is then quoted: “The minimum required for penalties are fixed by laws [communicated] to Moshe at Sinai. Others say: the Court of Ya’abetz [Osniel]<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the Talmud in <i>Temurah</i> 16a, Ya’abetz is another name for Osniel. Ya’abetz is a combination of the Hebrew initials of, “He advised and advanced the study of the Law.”</i> fixed them.” The Gemara then asks: “But Scripture said: ‘<i>These </i>are the commandments,’<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lev. 27:34.</i> i.e., only that which is contained in the Torah, which means that no prophet may introduce any new law from then on.” The Talmud answers, “They were forgotten and then [the court of Osniel] established them anew.”",
                    "<i>Prima facie </i>it appears that R. Elazar and R. Yohanan are not disagreeing as to whether these measures are from Moshe at Sinai. [However, one is compelled to conclude that they do disagree]. Otherwise, how, according to R. Elazar, can another rabbinical court come and increase the measures if [standard measures and penalties] were fixed by laws [communicated] to Moshe at Sinai? [If the measures were given at Sinai, everyone would agree that they cannot be changed by a subsequent court].<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A court is unable to nullify a previous court’s decision unless it is greater in wisdom and number. See Tractate <i>Eduyos</i> 1:5.</i> Further, it is clear from the Jerusalem Talmud in Tractate <i>Pe’ah</i> 1:1 and Tractate <i>Hagigah</i> 1:2 that R. Elazar and R. Yohanan do disagree on this matter. As [these tractates] note, R. Yohanan states that standard measures are fixed by laws [communicated] to Moshe at Sinai, while according to R. Hoshea, it was the sages who set the standard measures. [In <i>Pe’ah</i> and <i>Hagigah</i>], the Gemara states that R. Hoshea follows his opinion [expressed elsewhere], that one who eats forbidden foods must make a note of the quantity, because another rabbinical court may come and increase the measures. Behold, according to the opinion [that the measures] were received from Sinai, it is not possible to say that [another rabbinical court may come and increase the measures communicated to Moshe at Sinai]. It is therefore certain that R. Elazar and R. Yohanan are <i>not</i> in agreement, and that this disagreement reflects a tannaitic dispute as to whether the measures were given at Sinai. [As in the previously cited <i>baraisa</i> quoted in <i>Yoma</i>], the Tanna Kamma [who stated, that the minima which entail penalties are fixed by laws communicated to Moshe on Sinai, agrees] with R. Yohanan. On the other hand, [the opinion] of the “Others,” who stated that the Court of Ya’abetz established them, is expressing what was quoted previously from Tractate <i>Temurah</i>: “that they were restored through the use of pilpul.” Even though the laws regarding [measures] had previously been received from Moshe at Sinai, they were forgotten and it was necessary to reestablish them through argument and deep analysis. Because of this [determination of the court of Ya’abetz], R. Elazar was concerned that a later court might come and conclude through [strong] proofs that the measures given to Moshe at Sinai [differed from those of the court of Ya’abetz]. Nevertheless, as things turned out, the decisions of Ya’abetz are true for all time and have endured as the accepted halachah, [and considered as if they had been told to Moshe at Sinai].",
                    "Similarly, [the Tribe of Yehuda continued to excel in applying deep analysis, as expressed by what occurred] in the time of King Saul and King David. It states in Tractate <i>Eruvin</i> 53a: David revealed a collection of laws, while Saul did not. In reference to David, it is written: ‘Those who revere You shall see me [David] and rejoice.’<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 119:74.</i> That is, those who fear God will delight in the accuracy of David’s halachic decisions. In reference to Saul, who did not reveal a collection of laws, it is written in the Book of Samuel: “Wherever he turned, he would destroy them [his adversaries].”<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Sam. 14:47. I translated this verse according to the Targum and Rashi, with whom the Netziv agrees (See <i>Harhev Davar,</i> Deut. 33:11). An alternative translation is, “He would terrify and bewilder them.”</i> Rashi explains [that the Gemara] is saying that Saul did not render decisions in accordance with the accepted halachah. [However, this interpretation] is difficult, for the verse cited [from the Book of Samuel] has reference to Saul’s military campaigns and victories.<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Harhev Davar</i>, see note 8, the Netziv adds two additional difficulties: one, how can it be suggested that Saul would not render proper decisions and, two, what relationship do halachic decisions have to military battles?</i>",
                    "The proper understanding of this gemara is that concerning Saul, a descendant of Benjamin, it is written [concerning Benjamin], “He rests securely with him,”<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 33:12.</i> [meaning that God’s Divine Presence dwells forever with Benjamin because of the Holy Temple].<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Rashi on that verse. In addition, <i>Yoma</i> 12a, states that a portion of the Temple stood within the area of the tribe of Benjamin. According to one opinion, the holiest portion of the Temple, the Holy of Holies, was within Benjamin’s territory.</i> Because of this, [Benjamin] was assured that he could render decisions as cases arose before him and [decide] as his eyes saw [fit] at that very moment, without deep analysis. [Therefore Saul] did not need to render decisions with powerful proofs such that his conclusions would be applicable for all times. The interpretation of the Gemara, which states that Saul did not reveal a collection of laws, is that he did not reveal his reasoning [for his decisions] to others, and as a result his decisions were not established for all times.",
                    "David,<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">David was a descendant of Judah.</i> however, [similarly] to how we described [Yehuda] in chapter 4, did not render decisions based on his own [individual] reasoning. Rather, he would toil greatly in applying pilpul in group study with other scholars. [This interpretation is further buttressed by] Rashi’s explanation of <i>Eruvin</i>, based on the statements in Tractate <i>Mo’ed Katan;</i><sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">16b.</i> from the verse, “One who sat in the assembly,”<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Sam. 23:8.</i> [we learn that David engaged in group study, sitting on the ground before the scholars].<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The full discussion in <i>Mo’ed Katan</i> is: “It is stated in Scripture ‘These are the names of David’s mighty men: who sat in the assembly… Adino the Etznite….’ What does this verse mean? R. Abbahu said, The verse actually states: ‘These are the names of David’s mighty deeds: he sat in a low position.’ When [David] sat in the academy, he did not sit upon mattresses and cushions but on the ground. As long as his teacher, Ira ha-Ya’iri was alive, Ira would teach the rabbis while seated upon cushions and mattresses. When [Ira] died, David would teach the rabbis, and he would sit on the ground. [The rabbis] said to him, ‘Let the Master sit upon cushions and mattresses,’ but he would not sit in an elevated position. ‘He is Adiono the Etznite’ – this implies that when [David] sat and engaged in Torah study, he bent himself like a worm. But when he went out to war, he straightened himself like wood.”</i> It is also written [about David], “In the House of God we would walk in company,”<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 55:15.</i> [i.e., he took counsel with others]. This group interaction ensured that his rulings were established as immutable laws. It therefore follows that [David’s approach to Torah study] also benefited Israel in time of battle, for the sword of Israel is in the merit of applying pilpul to Torah.<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv is saying that the strength of Torah study, which protects the Jewish people, is comparable to a sword. Tractate <i>Shabbos</i> 63a states that the simple meaning of the verse in Psalms 45:4, “Gird your sword upon your thigh, O mighty one, your majesty and your splendor,” is that it refers to the Torah. See also <i>Bereshis Rabbah</i> 24 that explains Psalms 149:6, “A double-edged sword is in their hands,” as referring to the Torah. The reason the Torah is compared to a sword as opposed to any other weapon, is that a sword is has two parts, the sword itself and its sheath, which are respectively symbolic of the Oral and Written Law. In time of peace, the sheath is more significant than the sword, as it denotes the importance and power of the officer who wears it, while the sword itself is not as significant since it is not used. In times of war, however, the sword is greater than the sheath, since then the main purpose of the sheath is not to display its wearer’s status but to protect the sword, whose condition and sharpness are of the highest importance. When Israel is at peace and the Torah, which is composed of God’s holy names, is studied, the Torah functions as the sheath during times of peace that communicates the greatness of the Jewish nation. This idea is hinted at in Deut. 28:10, “Then all the peoples of the earth will see that the name of the Lord is proclaimed over you, and they will fear You.” However, when Israel is at war, the sword – the pilpul of Torah – needs to be sharpened, meaning that the survival and protection of the nation of Israel require the application of deep analysis of the Torah.</i> This is clearly stated in Tractate <i>Makkos</i> 10a, on the verse, “Our feet were standing within your gates, O Jerusalem.”<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 122:2.</i> “Who caused our feet to remain standing in battle? It was when Israel [at the time of King David],<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Some explain this verse as describing not what transpired in the time of King David, but as referring to the future Temple. The verse thus describes King David’s recipe for success in battle, which is to be deeply involved in the study of Torah – in other words, pilpul.</i> was involved in the study of Torah, symbolized by the gates of Jerusalem.”",
                    "However, concerning Saul who was not involved in the pilpul of Torah, Scripture writes, “Wherever he would turn he would destroy them,” meaning that his successes were only temporary, [for, concerning Saul, the verse] did not state <i>hitzliah</i>, that he was successful.”<sup>20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv in <i>Harhev Davar</i> (Deut. 33:11) elaborates that the differences in tactics employed by David and Saul show that David’s successes were of a lasting nature, while Saul’s were only temporary. When Saul won a battle, he needed to destroy the inhabitants of that region so that his enemies would not be able to regroup. Saul lacked the ability to maintain a lasting presence in the locale in order to subjugate his enemies. But once David conquered an area, he would set up military posts, and this continuing presence meant there was no need to destroy the people of the conquered region.</i> With God’s help, this has been elaborated on in my book <i>Rinah shel Torah</i>."

[David and Osniel] applied pilpul only in those instances where the <i>halachah </i>had not been clearly defined and decided definitively.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is explained in <i>Ha’amek She’elah</i> 18:1 that per Tractate <i>Berachos</i> 7b–8a, King David established (prior to the building of the Temple) an academy that was “prominent in halachah” on Mt. Moriah. See later in Part 2, chapter 8, how Osniel and his colleagues collected and organized the halachah. We thus see that the main focus of David and Osniel was in the area of practical halachah.</i> They did not revisit those laws that courts had previously considered and conclusively decided, nor did they attempt to understand why those laws were decided as they were. It was not so with King Solomon of blessed memory, for he exerted himself to delve into the rationales of all the laws received from the previous [courts], and he trained others in the methodology [that the previous courts applied] to reach their conclusions.",
                    "Solomon’s methodology is explained in the verse, “More than others was Koheles wise,”<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Eccl. 12:9.</i> which means that [Solomon] was erudite in traditions and laws that had been previously received. “He also taught the people knowledge,”<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Id. The Netziv in the beginning of Part 2, chapter 7, cites Tractate <i>Eruvin</i> 21b that [Solomon] “taught them through signposts, [and explained the laws with analogies].” Using Rashi, he explains that through meticulous analysis of the language of Scripture or the Oral Law, Solomon found proofs for the received [laws and traditions].</i> means that he instructed the people regarding the bases of the [existing] decisions. Along these lines did Solomon caution: “The beginning of wisdom is: Acquire wisdom, and of all that you acquire, attain understanding.”<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Prov. 4:7.</i> Rashi explains: The beginning of [achieving] wisdom is learning from others, that is, acquiring for yourself the traditions from the rabbi’s mouth. [Only then will you] ‘with all that you acquire, attain understanding,’ [meaning] you will then know [the Torah, so that] you can independently ascertain the reasons [for the laws by] means of logical derivation.",
                    "To justify this interpretation further,<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse, “More than others was Koheles wise,” means that Solomon achieved the deepest understanding of wisdom.</i> the word “wisdom” [must] connote both knowledge and intellect, [for to receive meaningful instruction], one must also be at the proper level to absorb the precepts. This is the meaning of what is written in Daniel: “He gives wisdom to the intelligent,”<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Dan. 2:21. See Marsha to tractate Berachos 55a.</i> i.e., wisdom is imparted [by God] to one who possesses intelligence and not to one lacking this trait and is thus unable to conceptualize his knowledge.<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Ha’amek Davar</i>, Deut. 1:13 and Ex. 31:6. Both “wisdom” and “intelligence” are derived from the word “hacham.” The alternate translation, “He gives wisdom to the wise,” is unsatisfactory because the verse would imply that one becomes wise prior to receiving wisdom.</i> Solomon wrote that a prerequisite [for developing] this intelligence is to acquire knowledge and tradition, and afterwards to try to understand [the laws]. For thus did the sages of blessed memory caution, that “A person should first learn and [then attempt] to interpret,”<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shabbos</i> 63a.</i> the latter meaning to understand the rationale for the laws that one has learned.",
                    "It is explained in Koheles that three benefits stem from this labor [of discovering the reasons for existing decisions regarding a particular <i>halachah</i>]. These are expressed by the following terms: <i>izzen</i>, <i>hikker</i> and <i>tikken meshalim harbeh</i><sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“More than others was Koheles wise, he also taught the people knowledge; yea, he pondered (<i>izzen</i>), sought out (<i>hikker</i>), and set in order many proverbs (<i>tikken meshalim harbeh</i>).” Eccl. 12:9.</i> [literally, “pondered,” “investigated” and “organized many parables”]. The rabbis (in <i>Eruvin </i>21b) explain <i>izzen </i>as: “Make handles for the Torah,”<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Izzen</i> comes from the word <i>ozen,</i> which can mean either an ear or a handle.</i> [meaning to clarify the Torah to make it accessible to the masses]. The rabbis likened [a law whose rationale appears to be missing]<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lacking proper definition and scope.</i> to a large basket that lacks handles for grasping so that it cannot be moved [except by a select few] such as those possessing great strength; however, when handles are provided, [the basket] can be used by all. Further, a basket that lacks handles [is difficult to store], and it can easily fall and break [its contents], whereas if handles are provided, [it can be protected] by being secured on a peg. So it is with tradition that lacks reasoning – it is impossible to grasp unless it has been received directly from another (a rabbi who is such an illustrious teacher that he is like an angel of <i>Ha-Shem’s</i> hosts). In the absence of [knowledge and understanding of the rationale, even if one has an illustrious teacher], the [student] is unable to render decisions or accept these laws. However, when the tradition is accompanied by a rationale, everyone trusts the tradition, since it has been proven by reason and logic. In addition, since the law is now fully comprehensible, it is not easily forgotten. Indeed, toward the end of Tractate <i>Megillah</i>,<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">32a.</i> one is admonished to acquire learning through melody. As Tosafos explains, by properly combining learning with melody, retention is enhanced. One’s retention of the law is enhanced even more when learning is combined with its rationale; this is the meaning of <i>izzen</i>.",
                    "Another reason [for providing the rationale for laws] is explained by the word <i>hikker, </i>meaning “investigation.” This refers to the process of inferring corollaries from the received laws. If one does not know the rationale of a law, one cannot derive its corollaries. As a well-known saying states, “Follow the rationale.”<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Gittin</i> 73a.</i>",
                    "A further potential benefit of obtaining this knowledge [of the rationale of a law], is suggested by the phrase, <i>tikken meshalim harbeh</i>, [“Set in order many proverbs”]: i.e., one may originate new legal principles that go even beyond deductions from the laws that have been received. These derivations can only be made through carefully weighed decisions and [use of] pilpul. It is well known that each person possesses different intellectual and analytical abilities. However, when a law’s rationale is known, in addition to the methodology used to arrive at the law, [many people] may develop new formulations of laws. In this sense, pilpul functions like a parable, to enable one to arrive at new legal principles, effectively creating a paved path leading one to the proper decision."

                    "<b><small> THE END OF THE FIRST TEMPLE PERIOD: KING JOSIAH CREATES A FRAMEWORK THAT FACILITATES THE GREATER USE OF PILPUL</small></b><br>DURING THE FIRST TEMPLE period, after Solomon’s reign, the Kohanim and Levites [did not apply his analytical methods, but] dealt with specific cases as the need arose. In order to adjudicate in accordance with the Torah’s true meaning, they relied on the Divine light of the Ark that resided within the Temple and on the holiness of the High Priest. [This continued until] the period of King Josiah, who foresaw that the Divine light of the Ark would be extinguished from the Holy of Holies, that Israel would be exiled from its soil and “Her king and officers would be exiled among the nations, there without Torah.”<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lam. 2:9.</i> This meant that the shining Divine light that powered the process of adjudication through Divine assistance [would be lost]. Should that occur, it was then possible, Heaven forbid, that the methodology of adjudication would be totally lost. As noted in the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Sotah</i> 7:4), it is because of this concern that Josiah rent his clothing and said, “The responsibility of strengthening (the Torah) rests upon me.”<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Jerusalem Talmud there states: “‘Cursed be the one who will not uphold the words of this Torah’ (Deut. 27:26). Does [this imply] that the Torah may fall?… Pertaining to this matter, Josiah rent his garment and stated: ‘The responsibility of strengthening the Torah rests upon me.’” Josiah foresaw that they were to be exiled and it was possible that the Torah would be forgotten (i.e., fall), and the power to strengthen the Torah for the future exiles rested in his hands.</i> The manner in which Josiah fortified the Torah is recorded in II Chronicles 35:3: “He [Josiah] said to the Levites who taught all Israel, who were holy unto God: ‘Put the Holy Ark in the House which Solomon, the son of David, King of Israel, built; there shall no longer be a burden upon your shoulders; now serve the Lord your God and His people Israel.”",
                    "A well-known interpretation of this verse is given in Tractate <i>Yoma</i>, in the chapter entitled <i>Hotziu lo.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">52b.</i></i>There it states that the phrase “put the Holy Ark” means that [Josiah] directed the Levites to hide the Ark. However, it is difficult to understand the intent of the directive, “Now serve the Lord your God and His people Israel,” [for what additional service could be placed on the Levites other than what they already performed?]<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">. In addition, what burden was associated with the Ark, since it rested securely within the Temple and was never removed? See <i>Harhev Davar</i>, Ex. 13:16.</i>",
                    "The explanation is that “to serve God” means that Josiah commanded the Levites to increase the application of pilpul to Torah study.<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Ha’amek Davar</i>, Lev. 10:11. Although the strength of Levi was not in pilpul but in analysis and comparative logic, the scholars of Levi applied this methodology when they needed to render decisions and learn Torah with others from the tribe of Levi. However, when they (the priests) taught Torah to the Jewish people, it was incumbent upon them to teach students the art of pilpul so that they could in the future apply pilpul and derive new laws.</i> [This reinforced the scholars’ ability to ensure the survival of the Torah when they were eventually exiled together with Josiah’s grandson, Jehoiachin]. [These scholars are referred to in II Kings as] “craftsmen, the gate sentries, one thousand, all mighty men, warriors.”<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“He [Nebuchadnezzar] exiled all Jerusalem and all the officers and all the mighty warriors, ten thousand exiles, and all the craftsmen and the sentries of the gates”: II Kings 24:16; Jer. 52:28.</i> As our sages expounded in the <i>Sifrei</i> in <i>Ha’azinu</i> on the verse “infants together with white-headed elders”<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 32:25.</i> and in <i>Seder Olam</i>, chapter 25, “What war do people bound in fetters and chains wage? Rather, they were mighty men of Torah who waged the war of Torah [through pilpul].” This approach of applying pilpul continued to be followed by Yehoiachin, Josiah’s grandson, and the Men of the Great Assembly: they exhorted and decreed, “Be deliberate in judgment; develop many disciples; and make a [protective] fence for the Torah.”<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Avos 1:1.</i>",
                    "These three decrees strengthened the use of pilpul and analysis in Israel. Being “deliberate in judgment,” means not to adjudicate by logic alone, but also to consider every possible outcome with deep analysis, until one arrived at a clearly convincing decision. In addition, by including many students in the discussions, they raised many questions and these discussions resulted in producing much Torah and wisdom. As expressed in the well known saying of R. Haninah in <i>Ta’anis</i> 7a, “I learned much from my teachers, more from my colleagues, and most of all from my pupils.” The exhortation, “Make a (protective) fence for the Torah” refers to the creation and application of <i>asmachtos</i><sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Asmachtos</i> in this context refers to rabbinic decrees based on supporting words in Scripture, even if they are in conflict with the simple meaning of the verse (See manuscript cited on page 253 of <i>Otzeros ha-Netziv</i>).</i> and <i>gezeros</i>, rabbinical decrees designed to prevent violation of the Torah. [The use of <i>gezeros</i> and <i>asmachtos</i>] increases knowledge and analysis because their use forces the scholars to investigate the Torah laws thoroughly in order to determine what is rabbinic and what is Biblical.<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One cannot enact preventive measures without a thorough understanding of the origin of the laws and how they were derived. For example, preventive measures cannot be applied to prevent the violation of other preventive measures.</i> All this was foreseen by the luminary of Israel, King Josiah, who directed [the Levites], “Serve the Lord your God” so that the Torah would not be forgotten, Heaven forbid. He [Josiah] directed, “serve… His nation Israel” [meaning that the Levites should teach Israel how to decide <i>halachah</i>] when they encounter undecided laws [in various areas].<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Until the time of Josiah, the Levites were separate from the masses, immersed in their sacred duty to God. (See Num. 8:14, “You shall separate the Levites from among the Children of Israel, and the Levites shall be Mine”). That form of service is “a burden upon your shoulders” because they were <i>ba’alei merkavah la-Shechina</i> – “possessors of the Divine Chariot.” As it is written in Num. 7:9, “To the sons of Kehas he did not give because they are obligated in the sacred service; they carry on their shoulder.” Why does Scripture need to mention that they bear the Ark on their shoulders instead of stating that they carry the holy vessels with staves, as mentioned in <i>Terumah</i>? Because Scripture is stressing that the Levites were to be a vehicle of God’s Divine Presence, which required them to be immersed in thoughts of holiness. This type of thought originates from the back of the head, which is connected to the shoulders. A similar idea is expressed in Tractate <i>Arachin,</i> which states that this verse refers to the mitzvah of singing in the Temple, as that service also required the Levites to be immersed in holy thoughts. Therefore, Josiah’s directive to the Levites was to hide the Ark and no longer separate themselves from others and be immersed in holiness, symbolized by bearing the Ark. The directive of Josiah, “Serve the Lord your God and His people Israel,” is translated by the Netziv as “Serve the Lord your God <i>together </i>with His people Israel” (e<i>s</i> may also be translated as “with”). This means that they were to be involved with the masses in the service of God by applying pilpul to Torah study. See <i>Harhev Davar</i> 28:10 and Ex. 13:15.</i>",
                    "In our book, <i>Rinnah shel Torah</i>, in which we use much exegesis and ethics, we dealt more extensively with Josiah’s directive to his generation.<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This directive and the importance of applying pilpul outside of Israel are described in the section entitled <i>Shear Yisrael.</i></i> Josiah and his generation needed to sharpen and brighten the sword of Israel. [Although that which is explained in <i>Rinnah shel Torah</i>] are the words of the ancients<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The phrase “words of the ancients” is from I Chron. 4:22.</i> [we will not now elaborate on this further], because our goal here is to describe the development of <i>halachah</i>.  [The prophet Amos] eulogized Josiah, stating, “It will come to pass in those days, says the Lord God, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon and I will darken the earth in the <i>yom or</i> – the day of light.”<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Amos 8:9.</i> In Tractate <i>Mo’ed Katan</i> 25b, R. Yohanan states that this verse refers to the day of King Josiah’s death. Josiah had begun to brighten the eyes of Israel [with his directives to increase pilpul and communal Torah study]. Had he lived longer, he would have greatly increased the amount of Torah [knowledge] in his day. However, the sins [of the generation] were great and the lamp of Israel was darkened, and all that remained of Josiah was the framework [that he had created].",
                    "Another interpretation of the term “day of light” is a day of rain. As is mentioned in <i>Bereshis Rabbah</i> 26, and in Tractate <i>Ta’anis</i> 7b, whenever the word <i>or,</i> light, is used in the Book of Job, it refers to rain, which is the fountain of light that brings prosperity to man’s life. Though [at times] “a rainy day is as calamitous as a day of judgment” (see <i>Ta’anis</i> 8b), nevertheless, from this rain flows light, [i.e., prosperity]. The [benefit of rain] is even greater when the sun shines after rainfall, as it says in <i>Ta’anis</i> 3b, “Sunshine after rain is as beneficial as two rainfalls.” For behold, when rain is followed by [a significant amount] of sunshine, the benefit of the rain greatly outweighs any calamity that results from it. This is the metaphor indicated in the verse, “I will darken the earth on a day of light,” meaning that the full benefit of the rain will not be realized. This [reference to darkening the earth on a day of light] is also explained through the parable, “It is a time of trouble unto Jacob, but out of it shall he be saved.”<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jer. 30:7.</i> The trouble [of Jacob] is the source of [Israel’s] light, because the darkening of the light of Torah that occurred with the exile of the Ark and Israel, caused the creation of the light of pilpul and the magnification of the Torah throughout the Diaspora.",
                    "Pertaining to this concept, one can apply the parable stated in Tractate <i>Yoma</i> 28b, “On a cloudy day the sun is felt all over.” What I mean to say is [that when the sun is obstructed by clouds, its light is reflected through the break in the clouds and permeates the shady locations]. The light of Torah in Jerusalem shone as if it emanated from the sun at its zenith; but when this light was extinguished, it caused the light of the Torah to be felt all over. [The impending diminution of the light of Torah was the catalyst] for applying pilpul and diligence to the study of Torah within every four cubits,<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Tractate <i>Berachos</i> 8a: “Since the day the Temple was destroyed, the Holy One, blessed be He, has nothing in His world but the four cubits of halachah.”</i> even though this light was not as apparent as at Jerusalem’s zenith. Therefore, during the days of King Josiah, when the rain [of Torah] began to fall, even though Josiah’s light contributed greatly [to the enhancement and survival of the Torah, his full potential was not realized]. What was realized is as described in the verse, “I will darken the earth, on a day of light,” meaning that we did not merit to experience the full benefit of the rain [of King Josiah]. [This explanation sheds light on why the Talmud in <i>Mo’ed Katan</i> also eulogizes the death of R. Yohanan with the same verse]. During R. Yochanan’s time, the world had become darker with the loss of the knowledge of the Tanna’im. For the Torah knowledge that existed at the time of the Tanna’im was much greater than that of later generations. As is stated in Tractate <i>Eruvin</i> 53a, “R. Yohanan said: ‘The understanding of the earlier sages was as broad as the <i>ulam</i> [the hall that led into the interior of the Temple], while our understanding is as narrow as the eye of a very fine needle.’” R. Yochanan’s generation was also distressed at losing the spiritual sustenance and its fruit [that had existed in previous generations]. As stated in the Jerusalem Talmud in Tractate <i>Pe’ah</i>, chapter 7<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The original text cites chapter 4.</i>: “R. Yohanan said, ‘The late-ripening fruits we ate in our youth were tastier than the peaches we eat in our later years,’” for in his time, the <i>koach ha-da’as,</i> intellectual power, had diminished.”<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Yohanan lived during the transition from the tannaitic to the amoraic period.</i> [Similar to the time of King Josiah], when the strength of understanding had decreased, it was an impetus for the arrival of R. Yohanan’s light, his explanation of the Mishnah, that is, the creation of the Jerusalem Talmud. However, we did not merit his full light, which is the completion of his task of compiling the Jerusalem Talmud. [This is the meaning of the verse, “I darkened the earth on a day of light.” This should be translated as, “I darkened the earth on a day of rain,” meaning that the <i>full </i>benefits of R. Yohanan’s Torah, symbolized by the rain, were impeded by darkness]."

                    "<b><small>THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND TEMPLES</small></b><br>WHEN THE JEWS were exiled to Babylonia, they needed to heed even more strongly King Josiah’s exhortation that they should not render <i>halachic</i> decisions unless they applied deep analysis and weighed their decisions carefully. Furthermore, as directed by King Solomon, they had to understand the intricacies of the received laws so that they could apply their conceptual underpinnings to new situations.",
                    "The reason for adhering to these stringencies is that the merit of living in Israel itself [even without the Ark and High Priest] enabled one to arrive at the proper decisions with less analysis, which was not true in Babylonia. It is taught in <i>Avos de-Rabbi Nasan</i>, chapter 28, “R. Nasan said, ‘There is no love like the love of Torah, and no wisdom like the wisdom of the Land of Israel.’” Also, in <i>Vayikra Rabbah</i>, chapter 13, “‘The gold of the land is especially good,’<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gen. 2:12.</i> teaches that there is no Torah like the Torah of the Land of Israel, and there is no wisdom like Israel’s wisdom.” Further in <i>Avos de-Rabbi Nasan</i> it states: “R. Shimeon the son of Elazar says: ‘If a sage who dwells in Israel leaves for the Diaspora, his scholarship becomes tainted, etc.’” In Tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i> 24a it is written, “[To what does the verse], ‘He has placed me in darkness like the eternally dead’<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lam. 3:6.</i> refer? R. Yirmiyahu answered that this alludes to the study of [Torah] in Babylonia.” [R. Yirmiyahu is not saying] that the Babylonian Talmud contains mistakes, Heaven forbid-[he is extolling the power of pilpul in “darkness”]. Since Babylonia was an abyss of darkness,<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“He has placed me in darkness like those who are dead forever” is explained by the <i>Midrash Lekah Tov</i> as referring to the long exile. See the Netziv in <i>Ha’amek Davar</i>, Lev. 24:4, which states that “darkness” refers to the lack of the special Divine assistance that existed when the Jews lived in Israel and received the Divine light emitted through the Menorah.</i> totally lacking the light of Torah, only by creating the great torch of pilpul contained in the Babylonian Talmud could they produce in the darkness the light of halachic decision. [As stated <i>ad loc.</i>], “Rabbi Yohanan said, ‘What is Babylonia?<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word <i>Bavel</i> (Babylonia) comes from the root of the Hebrew word <i>livlol,</i> which means “to mix.” See Gen. 11:9.</i> [A place] that blended Scripture, Mishnah and Talmud.’” [To counter this darkness, the Babylonian scholars] needed to apply deep analysis and to study repeatedly all sections of the Torah until they reached sound conclusions. [This way, they] succeeded in magnifying the Torah and creating a magnificent torch-light of Torah.",
                    "This is similar to the parable cited in the Midrash on Koheles.<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> on Koheles, 2:14, where it comments on Koheles 2:12: “‘I turned myself to behold wisdom’: R. Nahman made two comparisons…. The other comparison was to a huge palace with so many doors that whoever entered it lost his way. There was a shrewd man who, on entering, took a rope of reed-grass that he tied to the entrance. All were then able to enter and depart by means of the guiding rope.”</i> [It compares one who applies deep analysis to a person who enters] a large palace which contains many rooms [and he must strategize to find a way out]. To find his way back to the entrance, he ties one rope to another so that he can retrace his steps. However, someone who has a lamp that illuminates the way to the door does not need to exert that much effort, and can find the door with minimal searching and exertion. However, he will not gain an understanding of the palace. This is not so with the one who has no lamp and must exert much effort to understand the intricacies of the palace; he stumbles and repeatedly gets lost until he finally locates the exit. Such a person obtains a great light – namely, a much greater insight into the design of the building, than the other.",
                    "So it is with the sages who lived in Israel. Since the merit of Israel illuminated their path, there was no need for great toil in order to reach the right decisions. However, the Babylonian scholars [between the first and second Temples] could not discover the light of legislation without great effort. In addition, they stumbled many times until they arrived at the proper conclusions. This is analogous to [the amoraic approach to study] as [demonstrated] in the commonly found statement in the Babylonian Talmud, “The words I said before you were mistaken.”<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As an example see <i>Shabbos</i> 63b. Obviously, the discussions in the Gemara occurred much later than the period between the First and Second Temples. The Netziv feels that these later discussions shed light on the earlier period.</i> Along these lines, the Talmud in <i>Gittin</i> 43a commented [on the verse discussing the end of the First Temple period] “‘… this stumbling block [the Torah] is under your hand.’<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isa. 3:6. The full verse is: “When a man takes hold of his brother of his father’s house [so that he may speak to him, and he says to him], ‘Be a ruler over us and let our stumbling be under your hand….’” The Netziv may be quoting the Talmudic explanation of this verse because it discusses the type of Torah knowledge that would come into being with the destruction of Jerusalem. At that time, the men of Jerusalem had become lax in the study of Torah and experts capable of issuing halachic rulings were scarce. Whenever people encountered someone who seemed well-versed in the Torah, they would implore him to assume the position as their halachic decisor. They would say, “Come, be our leader, for this ‘stumbling block’ [the Torah], is under your hand [i.e., you are well versed in the Torah’s laws].”</i> That is, a person does not achieve true understanding of the Torah until he has stumbled and made incorrect decisions.”<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Talmudic passage reads, “Rava, the son of Rav Huna, thereupon assigned an announcer to precede him and to declare his retraction. He expounded that the verse states, ‘This stumbling-block [the Torah] is under your hand.’ Why is the Torah referred to as a stumbling-block? Because a man does not reach a full understanding of the words of the Torah unless he has first stumbled in interpreting them….”</i>",
                    "However, [after such stumbling], by virtue of their great understanding the Babylonian sages [following the first Temple] produced great, enlightened legislation. Pertaining to this [period] it is written in Isaiah 29:18, “In that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness.” This means that only out of darkness and obscurity [such as that in Babylonia] can one gain true intellectual enlightenment, more than those who do not inhabit such darkness.<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Related to this subject, the Netziv writes in <i>Harhev Davar</i>, to Ex.19:19 that when Israel received the Torah at Sinai, Scripture states (Ex. 19:18–19): “The whole of Mount Sinai was full of smoke… its smoke ascended like the smoke of the lime pit….The sound of the <i>shofar</i> continually grew louder….” Smoke is symbolic of the trials and tribulations that Israel would experience throughout the ages, as one covered in smoke experiences both darkness and the inability to see what is happening. This means that when Israel experiences trying times, the outcome is unknown, and it is a mystery why these bad experiences occur. The <i>shofar</i> is symbolic of God’s word – that is, the Torah. At Mount Sinai the blasts of the <i>shofar</i> grew stronger with time, unlike what would occur in the real world, where the sound would diminish. So it is with the Jewish people: when they are confronted with times of darkness symbolized by the smoke, the power of pilpul becomes stronger – a mystery, the sound of the <i>shofar</i> emanating from the dark smoke.</i>"

                    "<b><small>THE SECOND TEMPLE PERIOD</small></b><br>FOR THE REASON that was explained above, with the arrival of Ezra from Babylonia into Israel and the building of the [Second] Temple, there was once again no impetus to apply pilpul. For whenever any [scholars in the Land of Israel] were confronted with difficult cases, they forwarded their questions to [the court that sat] in the Holy Temple, where the Divine light of the high priest was sufficient [to determine law]. As a result, the use of pilpul diminished. Hence, when the sins [of Israel] increased during this period [even though the Temple still stood], the merit of the Temple was no longer sufficient for achieving enlightenment in the law. In addition, it is known [that towards the end of the Second Temple period] the high priests were no longer worthy of their position.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">During the Second Temple period, many people bought the position of High Priest, including those who were unworthy of it. See Tractate <i>Yoma</i> 18a, “R. Assai said, ‘Martha, the daughter of Boethus, gave King Yannai a <i>tarkav</i> (a dry measure equal to three <i>kav</i>) of gold dinars to nominate Joshua son of Gamla as one of the high priests (to be elected by the electors).’” Even though Joshua son of Gamla was worthy of the position, the purchase of the office by his wife Martha began a trend of people purchasing the office regardless of their character and Torah knowledge.</i> It is stated in Tractate <i>Sukkah</i> 20a<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“In the beginning, when the Torah was forgotten from Israel, Ezra rose up from Babylonia and re-established it. When it was again forgotten, it was re-established by Hillel the Babylonian….”</i> that the Torah was almost forgotten in Israel [until it was saved by] Hillel, who arrived from Babylonia and re-established the [use of] pilpul. In Israel, Hillel used and applied the methodology that was being employed [by the sages] of Babylonia. Hillel is also referred to as a legislator, as it says in Tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i> 5a, “To what does Scripture refer in the verse, [‘The scepter shall not depart from Yehuda], nor he who legislates from between his feet?’<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gen. 49:10.</i> These are the descendants of Hillel who teach Torah to the masses.” That is, by applying deep analysis to the received traditions and decisions, Hillel derived the seven rules for interpreting the Torah, which is set forth in the seventh chapter of the <i>Tosefta</i> of Tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i>.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Tosefta</i> at the end of this chapter states, “Hillel the Elder expounded seven rules [for elucidating the Torah] before the sages of Besera: (1) through a conclusion inferred from a lesser case to a strict one and vice versa; (2) through tradition that similar words in different contexts are meant to clarify one another; (3) through a general principle derived from one verse, and a general principle derived from two verses; (4) through a general statement limited by a specification; (5) through a specification broadened by a general statement; (6) anything that was included in a general statement, and was then singled out to discuss a provision similar to the general category; and (7) anything that was included in a general statement, and was then singled out to discuss a provision not similar to the general category. These are the seven rules that Hillel expounded before the sages of Besera.” R. Yishmael later incorporated these seven rules into his thirteen rules cited in the Introduction to the <i>Sifra</i>. This is also recited in the morning prayers at the end of the section dealing with the sacrifices.</i> As befitting the greatness of his generation, [Hillel and his court] functioned as a powerful spring of water that overflowed and overcame all doubts. The use of pilpul and analysis was their strength that enabled them, with the help of their Creator, to fortify the yoke of Torah. With righteous humility, through the sword of the pilpul of Torah, they experienced the wonders<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Psalms 45:5.</i> of the Torah, Israel’s majesty and splendor. This [system] continued during the days of Rebbi, [Yehuda the Prince], the crown and lamp of Israel, until the completion of the Mishnah.",
                    "Even though Hillel came [from Babylonia] to Israel and established the seven rules for interpreting the Torah, it did not change the way the scholars in either country [Israel or Babylonia] engaged in study. From time immemorial in the Land of Israel, the sages would study individually, not together, and their main efforts consisted of rendering halachic decisions for individual cases. Their understanding of the proper interpretation of the Mishnah shone on the scholars of Israel as a torch [that is, they had an established tradition from Yehuda the Prince of the Mishnah’s meaning]. When confronted with a new situation [they would compare that circumstance] with a previously well-established law, and thus needed only minimal application of pilpul. This was never so with the Babylonian sages. Their major efforts consisted of applying pilpul in great depth, and [through group study and debate] they sharpened one another’s minds. Since people have different intellectual approaches, [group study resulted either in] laws flowing from the ‘Rock of Contention’, [that is, dispute],<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv is utilizing a play on words with the phrase, “Rock of Contentions,” cited in I Samuel 23:28. This means they had the advantage of hearing multiple viewpoints. The Netziv is also referring to the metaphor cited in Jeremiah of the rock broken in pieces. It is discussed in Part 2, chapter 10.</i> or one of the group would be standing near the basin [of truth], and the righteousness [of those who initially disagreed with that scholar] induced them to agree with [his] true interpretation. Their desired goal was [not personal gain], but to assure long-lasting legislation stamped with their judicial seal. Because of this [unselfish motive] they treated one another with love and respect, as one should treat his master and teacher. As it is stated at the end of the second chapter of Tractate <i>Bava Metzia</i>, “The Babylonian scholars would rise out of respect for one another,” etc.<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 33a. “Ulla said: The Torah scholars of Babylonia are accustomed to stand up before one another and to rend their garments for one another.” Ulla, an amora who traveled back and forth between Israel and Babylonia, is apparently saying that the mutual respect among the Babylonian scholars was greater than what he observed among the Torah scholars of Israel.</i> See <i>Ha’amek She’elah</i> 7:5.<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The text cites <i>os</i> 1 rather than <i>os</i> 5. There the Netziv uses this difference in study methodologies between the Israeli and Babylonian scholars in order to interpret the Talmudic discussions pertaining to the priority of teaching Torah to others, versus performing mitzvos for oneself, such as the laying of tefillin.</i>"

                    "<b><small>A FURTHER ELABORATION OF THE DIFFERENCES IN LEARNING BETWEEN THE ISRAELI AND BABYLONIAN SCHOLARS</small></b><br>THE SCHOLARS OF BABYLONIA understood the drawback of depending solely on pilpul for decision-making. For it is well known that one who overemphasizes the use of pilpul destroys the source [the original meaning] of the laws. Such people, [whose main focus is on the creative and imaginative aspects of interpretation], find it difficult to spend a significant amount of time analyzing the Gemara and the received laws to determine their practical applications. They become accustomed to ascribing significance to those laws whose methodology they can readily understand, together with the rationale that the Gemara applied in deriving those laws.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The literal translation is “on what were the law’s bases sunk.” This is similar to the wording in Job 38:6.</i> Thus, they are likely [to depart from these established rulings] by emending or amending them. [The Sages of Babylonia], were accustomed not to derive any matter, unless impelled to do so because they were confronted with the “darkness” of doubts and thus needed to clarify and purify them. Tractate <i>Yoma</i> 57a states, “R. Yirmiyahu<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An amora who lived in Israel and a contemporary of Rava, who lived in Babylonia.</i> said to Rava, ‘The [foolish Babylonian Torah scholars] dwell in a land of darkness. Therefore, they communicate laws of darkness.’” Rava [from Babylonia] lamented [that R. Yirmiyahu’s statement was true], and retracted his opinion [pertaining to the halachic matter that they were discussing]. As Rava said to R. Papa, “Not only do they consider us [the Babylonian scholars] to be dull, but they refer to us as the dullest of the dull.”<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Talmud there considers what happens if the blood from the bull sacrifice became mixed with the blood of the ram sacrifice prior to the sprinkling being performed on the Day of Atonement. Rava opined that the blood should be sprinkled both above and below for both the bull and ram sprinklings. R. Yirmiyah argued that this cannot be acceptable, since by combining the sprinklings, the ram’s blood would precede that of the bull, which is not permitted. Rava accepted R. Jeremiah’s argument.</i> [Rava was expressing] the realization of the [Babylonian scholars] that the straightforward arguments confidently presented by the Israeli scholars were in many instances more beneficial [in arriving at the truth] than what resulted from the pilpul of the [Babylonian scholars]. For [pilpul alone] is not as great a determinant of the truth [as received tradition].<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although the Netziv does not use the word “tradition,” this word was inserted based on what he writes thereafter in the text.</i> This was noted by Nahmanides in the introduction to his work, <i>Milhamos ha-Shem</i>.”<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“You who read my book [<i>Milhamos ha-Shem</i>], do not boldly say that I consider all the answers I wrote in order to [defend R. Yitzhak Alfasi] against the questions raised by R. Zechariah of blessed memory, irrefutable arguments that will impel you to agree with them against your faulty opinions. Or [I believe] that you may boast of being the provider of the knowledge of any of my arguments to others, or that you will need to enter the eye of a needle in order to repel the power of my arguments. This is not so, for of everyone who learns our Talmud, know that among those involved in disputing the interpretation of the Talmud, none possesses flawless proofs, nor in most cases do they have decisive rebuttals. For in this art [of pilpul], there is no paragon among the various generations, as there is to be found among the mathematicians in the field of geometry, or among the scientists in the field of astronomy.”</i> Therefore, [Babylonian scholars] respected the decisions of the scholars from the Land of Israel in practical matters. In many instances, when a halachic decision was not clear to them, the Babylonians would forward their questions to the scholars in the Land of Israel and would not deviate from their words.",
                    "The scholars from the Land of Israel also understood that when the law was not straightforward and it was necessary to draw the light of decision out of darkness through debate and analogy, the Babylonian scholars were superior. This is brought out in <i>Bava Kamma </i>117b, pertaining to the discussion of R. Yohanan [an <i>amora</i> from the Land of Israel] and R. Kahana [who had moved from Babylonia to Israel]. R. Yohanan said to the disciples in Israel, “I [originally] believed that [superior learning] of the Torah was yours; but it is theirs [the Babylonian scholars’].” For there is no Torah matter that cannot be properly resolved when thorough analysis of the law is coupled with the assistance of God, may His Name be blessed. When a scholar from the Land of Israel who was proficient in the Oral Law moved to Babylonia and acquired their skills at applying pilpul, he bore much fruit as the need arose. [The advantage of combining the traditions of Israel with the pilpul methodology of Babylonia] is described in Tractate <i>Menachos</i> 42a: “[When] one of the scholars from the Land of Israel comes to Babylonia, [he] becomes equal to two of the Babylonian scholars.” The obvious reason is that the traditions that such a [scholar from the Land of Israel] possessed assisted him in applying pilpul to arrive at the truth, even in those circumstances where traditions were lacking.<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The more information one possesses, the more tools one has for making inferences.</i> This transplanted scholar’s knowledge of traditions] would always lend weight to his arguments. If he stated that the matter was based on tradition, they, [the Babylonian scholars,] would concede, saying, “It is tradition. We accept [your argument].” In a converse situation, [when a Babylonian scholar emigrated to Israel], the Talmud in <i>Kesubos</i> 75a states: “When one of us [a Babylonian scholar] arrives [in Israel], he becomes equal to two scholars from the Land of Israel.”<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Talmud in <i>Kesubos</i> 75a states: “Abbaye said: ‘One of them [a resident of Israel] is better than two of us in Babylonia.’ Rava said: ‘But when one of us goes up to there, he is better than two of them. Take R. Yirmiyah, for example. When he was here in Babylonia, he did not know what the rabbis were saying. Yet when he went to live there, in the Land of Israel, he grew so that he would call us the foolish Babylonians.’”</i> Once he became knowledgeable in the traditions he had acquired in the Land of Israel, he overflowed both in wisdom and in applying the method of pilpul to which he was already accustomed."

It teaches whatever one’s mouth would request or mind would desire. When one becomes proficient [in the Talmud] through diligent study, he readily acquires the tools to make inferences and to define the laws clearly. Whether he obtained [this knowledge] from the concealed treasures of the sands<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Deut. 33:19.</i> of pilpul, or whether he was making inferences from the exact wording of the scholars, these methods, when grasped by those possessing sound judgment, [assure a level of understanding] that is limited only by the power of those who can repel attacks at the gates [of the houses of study].<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Isa. 28:6: “He will be a spirit of justice for those sitting in judgment, and [a spirit] of bravery for those who repel attacks at the gate.” The Talmud in <i>Sanhedrin</i> 111b comments: “Those who repel attacks at the gate” – this is one who is involved in the give-and-take of the battle of the Torah (i.e., its discussions and arguments). “At the gate” refers to those who are involved in Torah study in the synagogues and houses of study from early morning until night.”</i>",
                    "The <i>Ge’onim</i>, who followed the sages of Babylonia who had authored the Talmud, were knowledgeable of the straightforward paths contained within the palace [Talmud], for [because of the traditions that they had received], they were never in doubt regarding the manner in which the laws were to be applied. As a result, they were not much involved with the application of pilpul. [An additional] contributing factor [to explain the lack of pilpul in this period] was the multitude of restrictions and religious persecutions that existed in Babylonia. This [prevented them] from summoning the strength to develop many disciples so that their lamp of Torah might shine upon them during this time of great distress. Because of these circumstances, the Geonic responsa were expressed tersely and they did not choose to state the sources of their rulings, whether they were derived from tradition or through the analytical genius of the Geonim themselves – Israel’s majesty and the holiest of the valiant ones."

                    "In <i>Bereshis Rabbah</i>, parashah 25, it is written: R. Hunah and R. Yirmiyah stated in the name of R. Shmuel, ben R. Yitzhak, “The famine [in King David’s time] was meant to have occurred in the days of King Saul.<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Due to Saul’s sins, the famine was to occur in his generation.</i> However, since Saul [was compared] to the shoot of a sycamore tree,<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A sycamore is a lowly tree.</i> the Holy One, blessed be He, postponed it and brought it about during the days of David. [This is like the] well-known saying: ‘Shilo sinned and Yohana is punished’” [i.e., later generations pay for the sins of their ancestors]. R. Hiyya Rabba says, “This [timing of the famine] is similar to a glassmaker who was holding a basket filled with glass cups and other precious glassware. When he wanted to hang the basket, he [first] brought a peg and hammered it into the wall. [To test the strength of the peg], he first hung his own weight on it [after which he felt confident that the peg was strong enough], and then he suspended his basket from it. Therefore, the famine did not come during the days of men who were weak, but during the days of the mighty men who could withstand it.",
                    "R. Birchaya used to apply to [the timing of the famine] the verse: ‘He provides strength to the weary.’”<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isa. 40:29.</i> The Midrash is comparing the famine to a basket containing precious glassware that will in time bring honor to its owner. Since the owner needs to be careful that it will not break, he is zealous to the extent that he will even demean himself to protect it. [This is referred to in the Midrash] in a passage that says: When a glassmaker needs a strong peg from which to suspend the basket, what does he do? He first [tests its strength] by hanging his own weight on the peg [after which he feels confident enough] to hang his basket from it. He is willing to demean himself, because honor will result in the end. So it was with Israel’s shameful famine, which was a profanation of God’s name, as the people became needy and dependent on [the] other [peoples], which in turn led to their dispersal among the other nations.<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For example, Jews would move to neighboring countries to obtain food, as did Mahlon and Kilion (See Ruth, chapter 1).</i> However, [David’s degradation, the famine], caused the valiant of Israel to wage God’s battle [by attacking the neighboring nations], so that they could be sustained by the spoils of war. As reported in Tractate <i>Berachos</i> 3b, [the sages of Israel approached King David with the request], “Your nation Israel needs provisions,” [after which] King David replied, ‘Go, stretch out your hands as a band of marauders.’” When [Israel] triumphs, God’s name is made great and sanctified, because Divine salvation becomes well-known among the nations. However, this would not be the case if Israel had lived in security, [as there would be no impetus to wage a war that would result in the sanctification of God’s name.]",
                    "[The previously cited Midrash, <i>Bereshis Rabba</i> 25, illustrates why God imposes famine only in certain generations]. One would not risk his physical well-being by using his body to test the strength of the peg unless he could determine with confidence that it could withstand his weight [and that he would be unlikely] to fall and injure himself, as a consequence of which he would miss out on the honor [of preserving the precious glassware]. Similarly, a famine will not occur during a generation of weak people who are incapable of surviving it, as this would not result in the sanctification of God’s name. Therefore, the famine occurred during the time of strong individuals who would be able to withstand it, by providing an impetus for them to wage battle [and sanctify God’s name]. R. Berachiah, however, quotes the verse, “God gives strength to the weary.” [This means] that God gave strength to the armies of David to withstand the famine. For they could not [withstand it on their own without special Divine intervention]. In truth, if the famine had occurred during the time of King Saul, God would also have provided the necessary strength for his [Saul’s] mighty and valorous men, but for [certain reasons God desired] that the famine should take place during [King David’s] time.",
                    "This topic [discussed in the Midrash], is also applicable to the subject of halachah. As demonstrated by the Talmud’s exegesis of a verse [in Amos], the sages compared [periods of Jewish history lacking erudition in halachah] to a shameful famine.<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shameful because they became dependent on the non-Jewish world.</i> It is noted in Tractate <i>Shabbos</i> 138b: In the future, the Torah will become forgotten amongst Israel, as it is stated in [Amos],<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Amos 8:11.</i> “A time is coming, says the Lord God, when I will send famine upon the land; not a hunger for bread or a thirst for water, but for hearing the words of God – the halachah.” The verse continues,<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Amos 8:12.</i> “People shall wander from sea to sea and from north to east to seek the word of God, but they shall not find it.” … What is the meaning of ‘people shall wander… to seek the word of God’? This [prophesies] that in the future a woman shall take a tithe from her bread and will wander amongst different synagogues and academies to inquire as to whether the tithe is ritually pure or impure, and they [the sages] will be unable to discern its halachic status. This [inability to render a halachic decision] occurred [because that generation, at the end of the First Temple period], lacked proper training in applying pilpul]. This deficiency occurred because [earlier generations] were satiated with the Divine light of the Ark and the holiness of the high priest, and therefore did not need to wage God’s battle with the aid of pilpul. [This continued] until the famine [of Torah] that occurred during the time of Josiah, when the sages became mighty in the application of pilpul [to counter it]. I described this in chapter 8, pertaining to the <i>Sifrei’s</i> interpretation of the verse, “craftsmen, gate sentries, one thousand, all mighty men, warriors.”<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Kings 24:16; Jer. 52:28.</i> Thanks to this [impetus to wage battle by means of pilpul], God’s honor, may He be blessed, became great, because the profundities of the Torah became known to the masses. [Alternating cycles of generations applying deep analysis and generations minimizing pilpul but relying on tradition, continued throughout history].",
                    "When [the sages] became satiated with the seven exegetical rules given by Hillel,<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See note 4.</i> [they had less need for pilpul]. [In the periods after Hillel, the need for pilpul increased], because the knowledge of tradition decreased during the amoraic period, and they needed to apply pilpul to expound the Mishnah, thereby enhancing the Torah [by means of] the wisdom of the Talmud. [Once again], after the completion of the Talmud, [the need for pilpul diminished] since the Geonim became satiated with the traditions that they had received in regard to the interpretation of many Talmudic subjects. After this, the Talmud, [several generations later], was transmitted to the Tosafists, who [due to their lack of tradition in interpreting the Talmud], needed to apply pilpul, thereby making the Torah greater through their various interpretations and arguments. If [those generations which relied primarily on tradition] had been given the need to apply pilpul, they would have also been able to reach this level of analysis through the Divine assistance of the Guardian of the Covenant.<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As noted in the text, R. Berachia stated regarding the occurrence of famine, “He provides strength to the weary.” One might suggest that the Netziv follows R. Berachia against R. Shmuel, son of Yitzhak. However, this appears not to be the case, as the Netziv alludes to both interpretations in describing the reason for the famine. It appears, therefore, that according to the Netziv, both rabbis are in agreement and that R. Berachia is merely adding to the words of R. Shmuel. This means that God mainly subjects those generations that are stronger to be hardened and elevated through famine, and thereby requiring less Divine assistance. In a few situations, however, God will subject a weak generation to harsh situations such as famine (for reasons only known to the One of Infinite Wisdom), and will elevate even them to such a level that they can be provided the impetus to wage battle and win.</i>"

(As it is written: “For the Lord God is a sun and a shield, favor and glory does God bestow; He withholds no goodness from those who walk in perfect innocence.”<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 84:12.</i> The interpretation of this verse is that even though the sun bestows favor and glory upon every life form, none is [protected] from the sun when it is burning hot, [for at such a time] they all are in need of some form of a shield or cover.",
                    "So it is with the light of Torah: it bestows favor and glory upon those who are diligent in its study. As is said in Tractate <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 3b, “Anyone who studies Torah at night, the Lord strings a thread of grace around him during the day.”<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Harhev Davar</i> on Ex. 22:22 where the Netziv writes that according to Tractate <i>Avodah Zarah, </i>if a scholar studies the Torah at night, the prayers that he utters by day are answered by God.</i> It is stated in <i>Shemos Rabba</i>, <i>parshah</i> 38, that the Book of Chronicles does not associate anyone with glory until it discusses Osniel, who is known as Ya’abetz,<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See note 4 supra.</i> for he had toiled in the study of Torah. [However, the Torah, like the sun, can at times be harmful]. As explained in Tractate <i>Yoma</i> 72b, if one is not meritorious, i.e., he does not study the Torah diligently so as to understand it properly, the Torah] “smelts him” to death. However, when one walks in pure innocence, he constantly benefits from its light. This explains the verse, “that the Lord God is a sun and a shield,” and also explains, “Favor and glory does God bestow; He withholds no goodness from those who walk in perfect innocence”). [Now that we have established that the sun is symbolic of the source of the Torah, it seems clear that] the verse in Koheles expresses the view that one who understands the sources and traditions of this “inheritance,” that is, the tradition coupled with its rationale, is the superior approach [in determining Halachah]. As I wrote previously,<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See chapter 7 supra.</i> this trait was characteristic of King Solomon’s wisdom.",
                    "The verse then continues, “For to sit in the shelter of wisdom is to sit in the shelter of money.” This means that as money provides shelter [security], everyone comprehends that it is better to gain money through inheritance rather than to have to toil for it and experience frustration. However, there is an advantage to obtaining wealth though one’s personal toil in business: that experience makes a person aware of [business practices], more than if one received his knowledge through inheritance.",
                    "Obviously, one who inherits money is likely to become knowledgeable in business practices; for the possession of money itself accustoms a person to business, [as expressed in the saying:] “Money leads one to doing business.”<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This expression originates from Tractate <i>Bava Metzia</i> 63b, which states: “A man’s funds perform a service of brokerage for him” – that is, a person who possesses sufficient funds does not need a broker.</i> But those who inherit money do not become as knowledgeable in [business as those who acquire wealth through their own efforts]. However, [gaining expertise in business] is not [totally analogous] to [acquiring] Torah knowledge, for it is a fact that when knowledge is acquired through much analysis, one acquires the ability to make decisions in unclear circumstances, more than one who has acquired knowledge through tradition. Nevertheless, when knowledge is acquired through tradition, one is more likely to decide correctly, [since the accumulation of authentic knowledge] guides one to arrive at the truth in a straight path.",
                    "[This is what Koheles refers to when he states:] “For to sit in the shelter of wisdom is to sit in the shelter of money.” [In the shelter of wisdom one receives honor, and the shelter of money provides one with his practical needs]. For both honor and livelihood are equally important, each one in its own way. [Torah knowledge as represented by honor] sustains the soul with its clear guidance, because you have gained clearly defined laws, whilst [livelihood] sustains the body through material assets. However, [as stated by Koheles], “The advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of its possessors,” meaning that wisdom is more likely to lead one to the end goal [of fully sustaining the soul], than how money will achieve its objective [of fully sustaining one physically].<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is explained by the Netziv in greater detail in Part 3.</i>",
                    "Just as it is understood that there is no value in wealthy people questioning why the poor need to apply so much more effort to their business than they, similarly there is no value gained by questioning why in these times we need to be more diligent in our Torah study than the earlier generations. For, as we have already explained, [the earlier generations] were rich in the traditions and the explanations of the laws, as well as their scope. This is not so in these times, where we hunger for God’s word, which is Jewish law.",
                    "An additional reason why later generations need to work harder in order to determine Jewish law is that the [nature of the world has changed from former times]. [This is evident] from the way the taste and the quality of fruits have changed in the later generations. As it is taught towards the end of Tractate <i>Sotah</i>, “R. Shimon the son of Elazar said: ‘When purity was suspended from the [Jewish people], the [special] taste and aroma of fruits was suspended from the world.’”<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sotah</i> 48a.</i> [This means that] whatever happens to the spiritual level of the Jewish people affects the world. Many other examples are cited [in Tractate <i>Sotah</i>] to demonstrate this concept. Since the later generations lack this trait of purity, there is a need [to compensate] by sweetening the lives of mankind through diligent study and analysis. It was the saintliness and sincerity of earlier generations that greatly assisted them to determine the truth without the need of much analysis and toil. As is stated in the Jerusalem Talmud in Tractate <i>Berachos</i>, chapter 5, The pious men of the earlier generations would meditate for an hour before and for one hour after their prayers. If this is so, how did they have enough time to conduct their studies or business? Said R. Yitzchak of the School of R. Eliezer: “Since they were pious, a blessing was bestowed upon their studies and labor, [so that with minimal toil] they were equally successful in both directions in achieving the desired result.”",
                    "[The great <i>Amora</i>, Rava, also understood that due to their holiness and saintliness, earlier generations were more worthy to determine the truth], as stated in Tractate <i>Shabbos</i> 134b: “He (Rava) said to himself, ‘Why did I have to take issue with the interpretations of the elders [that is, R. Yehuda and Ravin bar Avuha]?’”<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rava was prompted to make this statement because he became ill after he instructed a man to bathe his baby on the Sabbath in a manner contrary to the opinion of R. Yehuda and Ravin bar Avuha.</i> This [demonstrates] that it was clear to Rava that since [R. Yehuda and Ravin bar Avuha] were from the earlier generations, they were more likely to determine the truth. [These earlier generations were superior in their ability to discern the truth because of], their holiness and righteousness. As is recorded in Tractate <i>Berachos </i>20a [pertaining to the generation of R. Yehuda], “R. Papa asked Abayye why it was that in earlier generations they experienced miracles, while in our generation we do not experience miracles…. It is because earlier generations risked their lives for the sanctification of God’s name, and we do not.” This was a consistent pattern throughout the different generations: that there were alternating styles in learning Torah. One generation consistently applied deep analysis, while another generation relied heavily on tradition. These alternating styles reflected the varying levels of righteousness of the different generations."

                    "<b><small>SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE APPROACHES OF THE TOSAFISTS, NAHMANIDES AND MAIMONIDES</small></b><br>JUST AS THE SAGES of Babylonia, as described in chapter 11, were respectful of the sages of the Land of Israel due to their knowledge of Torah traditions, so were the Tosafists [respectful] of the Geonim. The Tosafists were aware of the superior knowledge of the Geonim, which they had [gained from] the light of tradition. Many times the Tosafists modestly humbled themselves before the Geonim because of the holiness of their words, acknowledging that they expressed the words of tradition.",
                    "However, since the Tosafists were accustomed to relying on deep analysis, their hearts were not with [the Geonim] consistently and with strong conviction<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These words are from Psalms 78:37, “But their heart was not constant… and they were not steadfast….”</i> [that is, they did not always follow geonic decisions], nor did the Tosafists place faith in any matter if they themselves did not find the entrance and the light.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv is using a metaphor he employed in chapter 9, where the doorway and the light in the palace are representative of the knowledge of the traditions that enable one to navigate the pathways of the Talmud.</i> For behold the great genius, Yaakov – that is, Rabbenu Tam<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jacob ben Meir (Rabbenu) Tam (1100–June 9, 1171), the most prominent of the French Tosafists, was born at Ramerupt on the Seine and died at Troyes. Some of his responsa are collected in <i>Sefer ha-Yashar</i>.</i> of blessed memory. [In one case, where a woman’s husband was missing], he with his great wisdom allowed her to remarry on the basis of testimony from a witness who had seen [the husband’s corpse] three days after he had expired. [Although the facial features were not clear so long after death], he relied on the witness’s recognition of the entire body.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This ruling, which is written in Rabbenu Tam’s book, <i>Sefer ha-Yashar, siman </i>92, is cited in Tosafos’s commentary on the <i>Mishnah</i> in Tractate <i>Yevamos</i> 120a. The <i>mishnah</i> in <i>Yevamos</i> states: “Evidence [of identity regarding a dead man] may be lawfully tendered [to allow the widow to remarry] only on [proof afforded by] the full face with the nose, though there were also marks on the man’s body or clothing…. Evidence [of identification] may be tendered only [by those who saw the corpse] within three days [after death, since, after this period, decomposition would make identification difficult].” Rabbenu Tam argues that the <i>Mishnah</i>’s requirement that the identification of the corpse can only be performed within three days of death applies only when a head remains and parts of the body are missing. However, when a complete corpse is available, the body may be identified even after three days. For the ability of one to recognize an object by viewing it in its entirety, <i>tevias ayin</i>, is the strongest form of identification, even if parts of the body such as the face are mutilated. See also <i>Shulhan Aruch, Even ha-Ezer</i> 17:26. The Netziv also discusses this topic in detail in <i>Meshiv Davar</i> 3:28.</i> It is clear from what Rabbenu Tam writes in his <i>Sefer ha-Yashar</i>, that he based his opinion on a nuance in the words of the Bahag.<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bahag is an acronym for Ba’al Halachos Gedolos, meaning the author of the work <i>Halachos Gedolos. </i>Some, including the Netziv, attribute the work to R. Yehudai Gaon (Yehudai ben Nahman), the director of the academy of Sura from 757 to 761 C.E. Others attribute the authorship to R. Shimon Kayyara (ninth century). Since the Bahag describes the <i>mishnah </i>in <i>Yevamos</i> using the word <i>simanim</i>, Rabbenu Tam uses that as a proof to support his argument that the three-day requirement applies to a case in which there are only ordinary signs and a lack of <i>tevias ayin.</i> Rabbenu Tam also infers that ordinary signs, as stated in that <i>mishnah,</i> are rabbinic; they are used as a means to verify that a woman’s husband is dead, since the prohibition on her remarrying is based on rabbinic stringencies imposed where her husband was said to have drowned in a very large body of water, <i>mayim she-ein lahem sof</i>. The rabbis required witnesses to see and identify the body because it might be possible to say that her husband survived, and we could not see and verify without doubt that he escaped drowning.</i> However, pertaining to the laws of mourning, the Tosafists held that the first day of mourning is rabbinic. Thus, they rejected the words of the Bahag with a straw of wheat [a weak argument]. As [the Tosafist, the Ri] stated, “R. Yehudai Gaon, the <i>Ba’al Halachos</i> [the Bahag], was a great lamp [for Israel, yet at times his students would use his name to write matters that he did not direct nor intend to write].”<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the Bahag, if one dies on the last day of Yom Tov outside of Israel, mourning must be observed on that day because the first day of mourning is mandated by the Torah, while the last day of Yom Tov outside of Israel is a rabbinic commandment.</i> [Thus, since the Tosafists could not logically accept the Bahag’s opinion as stated. They felt that they could reject that opinion and concluded that it was written by a student].",
                    "Also, pertaining to our master, the Sheiltos, he is described by Rabbenu Tam in his <i>Sefer ha-Yashar</i> as being the most eminent of the Geonim,<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Pesah Ha’amek</i>, the Netziv references <i>siman</i> 618 of <i>Sefer ha-Yashar</i>. I was unable to find the reference.</i> yet, pertaining to <i>davar she-eino miskaven</i>,<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Translated literally as “an unintentional activity.” If one intends to perform an act that is permissible in itself, it may result in the manifestation of something that is prohibited. For example, if one intends to perform a permissible act such as walking barefoot on grass on Shabbos, this may result in uprooting the grass, which is prohibited on Shabbos. It is a disagreement among the tannaim, with R. Shimon holding that it is permitted and R. Judah holding that it is not. The example cited pertains to the Sabbath, but this issue pertains to other areas as well, such as castration, which is discussed in Tractate <i>Shabbos</i> 110a.</i> an unintentional activity, the [Tosafists] in Tractate <i>Shabbos</i> 100b, rejected our master’s [the She’iltos’s] words, [viewing him] as if he were a [mere] student at the academy, lacking in knowledge. They [the Tosafists] did not attempt to answer the obvious questions that they raised against the one who was the world’s lamp, the one from whom no Torah matter was hidden.<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Ahai Gaon in the She’iltos on Leviticus (<i>Emor</i>) writes that concerning a<i> davar she-eino miskaven</i>, Halachah accords with R. Shim’on when it pertains to acts affecting Sabbath observance, but accords with R. Judah when it pertains to other areas of ritual law. Tosafos disagrees with the opinion of the She’iltos, and argues that Halachah accords with R. Shim’on in all areas of ritual law.</i> You already know<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 4:35.</i> that I wrote in <i>Ha’amek She’elah</i>, chapter 105, Section 4, the true understanding of this Sheiltos and how the opinion of the Aruch<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Aruch</i> was written by Nasan ben Yehiel, who is known as the greatest Talmudic scholar of the eleventh century. It explains legal terms, provides etymologies and explanations of foreign words (including those in Aramaic, Latin, Greek, Arabic, and Persian), and made the Talmud more accessible to students. Nasan cited Geonic interpretations, the commentary of Rabbenu Gershom, and relied heavily on the writings of Hananel ben Hushiel.</i> pertaining to <i>pesik reshe de-lo niha leh<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This means one who performs a permissible act that will inevitably result in the manifestation of something prohibited, and the performer of the work is satisfied with the result. For example, one washes his hands (a permissible act) above his plants, which will result in the watering of his plants (prohibited because of <i>zorea</i>).</i> </i>was derived from the Sheiltos, whose words are illuminating and as impervious as sapphire.<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Lam. 4:7, “Her princes were purer than snow, whiter than milk; their appearance was ruddier than rubies, their form was like sapphire,” on which the <i>Echah Rabbati</i> 4:8 says, “Is sapphire a weak item? Said R. Pinhas, ‘There is a story of a man who went to Rome to sell a sapphire stone. A buyer told the seller that he would buy it on the condition that he could inspect it. He placed the sapphire stone upon an anvil and struck it, which caused the anvil to split in half while the sapphire remained intact.’”</i>",
                    "Similarly, the light of our eyes, the Ramban [Nahmanides] of blessed memory, sacrificed his life for the Geonim and toiled with all his strength to answer questions that were raised against them. Even so, because he was knowledgeable in the art of pilpul of the Torah, equal [in stature] to the authoritative and erudite sages of the Tosafists, if the explanation of the [geonic sages’] words was not available to him – that is, if he lacked the oral tradition and possessed only their written words, if the latter were not explicitly expressed, he would slant the words of the Geonim to suit his brilliant opinion and would interpret R. Yitzchak Alfasi and the geonic statements to support his paved paths, [that is, his own well-thought-out approach].",
                    "This was not so with the foremost of the authorities, the Rambam, of blessed memory, the Lamp of the Exile. He learned the geonic traditions and concepts with the exact version of their [Talmudic] texts, as hinted at in the master’s books, [the Sheiltos], and the works of the Bahag, and afterwards, R. Yitzchak Alfasi. [He learned all this] in a well organized and exemplary manner from his father and teacher, R. Maimon, and from the Ri Migash.<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam was only six years old at the death of R. Yoseph ibn Migash (Ri Migash, Seville, 1077–Lucena, 1141). Since Rambam’s father, Maimon, taught him many of the teachings of Ri Migash, the Rambam refers to him as his teacher even though he did not learn from him directly.</i> The Rambam, apart from the fact that the hand of God was upon him, enabling him to produce eternal words [drawn] from that which is hidden, knew through tradition the hints and unexpressed concepts known to the Geonim. In all instances when the Geonim were in disagreement and the truth was being investigated [in order to determine the Halachah], his intellect, being more expansive than the oceans, assisted him in sifting fine flour into flour of the highest quality, and to distinguish with a perceiving eye the wheat that sustains all who eat it.<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The determined halachah sustains the world like food.</i>",
                    "It is befitting for those who possess understanding to know that [even though] the <i>baraisos </i>of the <i>Toras Kohanim</i>,<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Also known as <i>Sifra</i>, one of the earliest commentaries on Vayikra.</i> the <i>Sifrei</i><sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Sifrei</i> is the oldest commentary on Numbers and Deuteronomy. While both the <i>Sifra</i> and <i>Sifrei</i> are tannaitic Midrashim because they contain attributions to the tannaitic sages mentioned in the <i>Mishnah</i>, they were written by the amoraim.

Yishmael.</i> are an open pathway leading from the Written Torah to the Oral Laws that are taught in our Mishnah, nevertheless, there are many <i>baraisos </i>from which the Talmud would deviate. I explained this clearly, with Heaven’s help, in my commentary on the <i>Sifrei</i>, where I argue that the sages of the Talmud knew through tradition that there were other Sages who disagreed with these <i>baraisos </i>on particular points, and that the Halachah was in accordance with those Sages. See what I wrote in <i>Ha’amek She’elah</i>, 128:1, that even though the books of the She’iltos, Bahag and R. Yitzchak Alfasi provided the Rambam, of blessed memory, with an open passageway from the Talmud to practical Halachah, there are, nevertheless, many halachic decisions that the Rambam rendered that deviated from these authorities. As we stated, the Rambam had a tradition that there were other Geonim who disagreed with [the above mentioned geonic authorities], and he ruled that the Halachah was in accordance with those other geonic opinions."

Rabbenu Tam objected strongly to textual emendations. He criticized Samuel ben Meir, the Rashbam, as follows: “Where my grandfather [Rashi] made one correction, Samuel made twenty, and erased [the old readings] from the manuscripts [and replaced them with new ones].” Rabbenu Tam also asserted that his explanations followed the simple meaning of the text (<i>peshat</i>) and argued against those “who by their pilpulistic methods distort the explanations of our teachers, and their interpretations render the <i>halachos</i> wholly meaningless.” (See <i>The Jewish Encyclopedia,</i> vol. 7, s.v.

Similarly with the responsa of the later Geonim of blessed memory: one cannot find them citing analyses of the works of the earlier Geonim, other than a little here and little there [on an ad hoc basis]. I do not [mean to imply], Heaven forbid, that they are to blame [for these omissions], for they were occupied with many tasks in their holy positions,<sup>22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word <i>makom,</i> usually translated “place,” has been translated here as “position.” M<i>akom</i> is can also describe a person’s state or status: see <i>Ha’amek Davar</i>, Ex. 3:5, and Gen. 18:33 and 30:25. An alternative translation is “in their holy locations.” Since Babylonia was well-established as a place where the Torah had been studied, it maintains a certain level of holiness and thus assists the subsequent generations in their performance of mitzvos and their study of Torah (<i>Ha’amek Davar,</i> Gen. 37:1).</i> and the light of publication was not as widespread as their need and use required, [and thus they lacked full access to the earlier geonic writings]. Therefore, the later geonic students would follow the approach of the heads [of their academies], seeking to examine the Six Orders of the Talmud in a manner familiar to Rashi and the other commentators. Thus, the new insights [of these later geonic students] depended upon these interpretations of the Talmud. In those instances when they found fresh ideas within the books of the earlier Geonim, it was an experience, as if they had found mandrakes<sup>23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Metiv Shir</i>, Song of Songs 8:14, where the Netziv sees mandrakes as symbolic of great spiritual joy.</i> in places where no one had previously trod.

The words of the Talmudic sages may not [seem] to enlighten one as to what one reads in Scripture. Therefore, I have toiled greatly [to understand] the <i>Mechilta</i>, the <i>Toras Kohanim</i> and the <i>Sifrei</i>, the primary fountains<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This means they are the primary sources.</i> that provide a well<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Harhev Davar</i>, Num. 21:20, where the Netziv describes the word “well” as symbolic of a wealth of explanations flowing from the Oral Law.</i> [giving insight] into the opinions of the Talmudic Sages, the mighty ones. [Through this genuine toil], I discovered the reasoning [behind the Talmudic sages’ opinions], and with the help of the Gracious Dispenser of Wisdom, who provides [the Torah’s wisdom] even to those who are unworthy, I have written my Book on the <i>Sifrei</i>, which in turn expounds the Books of Numbers and Deuteronomy, for the [writing styles]<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, “paths.”</i> of the tannaitic sages are terse. From there I proceeded to produce my commentary on the many <i>baraisos </i>cited in the <i>Mechilta</i> and <i>Toras Kohanim</i> which the commentators had not addressed. [The works I produced] were stored with me<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 32:34.</i> until the appropriate time,<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 32:6; perhaps alluding to how he was impelled by God to publish his work earlier than he intended, since the latest revision of his manuscript, edited by his son R.

The Netziv writes in <i>Ha’amek Davar</i> on Ex. 28:15 that the <i>urim</i> provide assistance to the Jewish people in battle and in Torah study. Another possible translation is that the Netziv is referring to the creation of the celestial lights, which determine time. The Creator of the Celestial Lights therefore refers to the One who controls time and knows the future.</i> to publish them and bring them into the gates [of the various academies]. As a result of obtaining an understanding [of the different Talmudic sources], I was also enabled to appreciate the approach of the most eminent teachers [of Israel], to draw the overflowing spring waters of instruction from the pure source, for from them [the <i>Sifre</i>, <i>Mechilta</i> and <i>Toras Kohanim</i>], [the Talmudic] laws were derived.<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, “hewn.” The author may have used the passive voice (“were derived”) in order to facilitate rhyming or to render the identity of the one who did the deriving ambiguous.</i> Similarly, to understand the decisions of the Rishonim clearly, [I studied their sources], that is, the tersely worded books of our master [the She’iltos], and also the Bahag and the Rif. I am warm [with gratification from all this study],<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Isa. 44:16: “Part of it he burns in a fire: on that part he roasts meat. He eats the roast and is sated; he also warms himself and cries, ‘Ah, I am warm! I can feel the heat!’” The Netziv is describing poetically how intense study and sincerity enabled him to understand the Talmud and its commentaries in great depth. See chapter 1, footnote 2, in which the Sifrei describes one who attends to the Torah, which is symbolized by fire, as warming himself by its flames.</i> and I can see [with confidence] the light of subjects that are scattered throughout the Talmud.<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, understanding an opinion requires effort, as one must consider various statements dispersed throughout different commentaries on diverse subjects, with commentaries on different areas of the Talmud.</i>",
                    "[In order to help me, God allowed me to overpower the mighty ones,<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Judges 5:13.</i> [by convincingly] showing [pre-eminent scholars] the enlightening and novel opinions [of the early authorities].

I translated this expression according to Rashi’s explanation in those Tractates.</i> [that would withstand deep scrutiny]. I did this by applying pilpul and [using the analyses of the Tosafists and Ramban], to reveal to [contemporary] masters of the Talmud, the beauty of the earlier versions of the Talmud, for the opinions of the earlier authorities [i.e., the Geonim], were driven by the extant texts possessed by rabbis of an even earlier era.",

God forbid that such a strange thought should enter one’s mind, for I know that error exists without limit, and that Moshe our Teacher taught a law that was to be applied throughout the generations so that we should not refrain from denying our mistakes. As stated in <i>Vayikra Rabbah</i>, <i>parshah</i> 13, “Moshe made an announcement throughout the Jewish camp, ‘I have made a mistake with the law; my brother Aaron came and taught me [corrected me] properly.’” Moshe performed this act to demonstrate to others the importance of admitting their errors.",
                    "For if anyone seeks to shatter my opinions into splinters, I have the [merit] of being committed to the Divine<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Gen. 30:8, in which the Netziv appears to be using the translation of Menahem ben Seruk that Rashi quotes.</i> and associating with eminent scholars.<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, “I placed my head between the mountains.”</i> I also state that the purpose of my work has been so that the words of our master [the She’iltos] should be acknowledged. If someone else comes to explain his words in a different manner, he is to be blessed, for I have lifted the shard that enables him to discover the ornamental pearl that lies underneath it.<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a Talmudic expression that means that scholars can build opinions based on their fellow scholars’ rulings (See <i>Bava Metzia</i> 34b, <i>Yevamos</i> 92b and <i>Makkos</i> 21b).</i> The benefit of both of our opinions assists in clarifying our master’s rulings, now that they are no longer concealed within hidden places. It will enhance the battle of Torah within the gates [of the houses of study], such that his words are comprehended by the sages and scribes, for the terse words of the early sages are enlightening as shining stars.<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv in <i>Ha’amek Davar</i>, Gen. 15:5, and in other places, says that the stars are symbolic of people of eminent stature and scholarship who shine brilliantly throughout the generations.</i>",

                    "Behold, there is no author from old times onwards who did not edit his words, for even our Master [the She’iltos, rather than] being defensive about his previous decisions [out of pride], edited his book many times, resulting in several revisions of his texts. (See what I wrote in <i>Pesah Ha’amek,</i> 1:2). What am I, born as I was with an inferior mind – what I built yesterday, I would like to tear down today, and I will be adding something tomorrow to that which I feel today is complete. I say it is better that a person should bear the yoke of plowing in his youth and focus his efforts on plowing, planting and the toil of raising the fruit, even if not its harvest. What I mean to say is that one should not publish [his ideas] until his later years, when he is seasoned and possesses a clarity of mind, after he has persisted in understanding matters clearly and applied much effort to enhance [the Torah’s] light.<sup>21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv was forty-two years old when this work was published.</i>",
                    "It is written in Proverbs 20:4, “The sluggard will not plow when it is winter; therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing.” The wise one [Solomon], who was imbued with the Divine Spirit, did not come to tell us what even small children know. As explained by Rashi’s commentary on that verse, derived from the <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> on the Torah portion <i>Nitzavim</i>, this verse is a parable and analogy, referring to the Torah. For we already know from other [Talmudic sources] that the toil and labor applied to Torah [study] is compared to bread. Tractate <i>Hagigah</i> 14a states, pertaining to the verse, “Come, eat of my bread…,”<sup>22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Prov. 9:5, “Come, eat of my bread and drink of the wine that I have mixed.”</i> [that bread] refers to the Talmud.<sup>23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Ha’amek Davar</i>, Deut. 28:2, where the Netziv explains that the word <i>lehem</i> denotes how the Torah creates a strong connection between God and Israel which cannot be severed. It resembles the Hebrew word <i>laham</i>, which means to weld or glue two things together strongly.</i> Scripture compares the toil of Torah in one’s youth to “plowing,” while “harvest” is referring to a person later in life, who possesses a clear mind and benefits others with his wisdom. [King Solomon] is stating that if one does not toil by applying analysis in his youth,<sup>24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the parable of planting in the winter.</i> he will beg for explanations of the Torah and receive nothing.<sup>25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This means that he will not receive an understanding of clearly-defined laws.</i> We now need to understand that just as plowing when done by the elderly is not successful, because at a weaker time of life one can not hoe well, so there is no point in man harvesting in his youth, i.e., reaping the fruit [of Torah] too early, so that it cannot be restored or improved by means of great analysis. The fruit of the tree of life is fragile and delicate,<sup>26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isa.47:1.</i> and its essential taste and aroma come when it has matured and not when it is unripe.",
                    "I have no misgivings<sup>27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word <i>afunah</i>, translated “misgivings,” is used only once in Scripture, in Psalms 88:16.</i> if any arguments or pilpul in my book also may have been advanced previously by my colleagues. At this time there has been an increase of God’s people spreading [false statements];<sup>28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 2:24, “No, my sons, for the rumor that I hear God’s people spreading is not good.”</i> slander is common among students and colleagues, and these individuals are transgressing the prohibition against suspecting the innocent. Because of my many duties, I was not always able to carry out a search of [various] books except in certain instances. If it happened that I saw [one of my ideas, which was independently derived in another book], I then made a note that my idea could be found in another source. In many instances [even when I did find my idea expressed in another source], I did not have the time [to note that source], and the original document remained unchanged.",
                    "Because of all of these concerns, I had reservations about publishing this book, similar to my [feeling regarding] my commentary on the <i>Sifrei,</i> which remained unpublished<sup>29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, stored away with me (see Deut. 32:34).</i> [even though] it had been completed much earlier, the result of the toil of the days of my youth. However, previously I had transferred my compilation to my son, our master Rabbi Hayyim Berlin, to edit and enhance because God bestowed upon him wisdom. He then toiled, copying and refining it. He tried to return it to me through one who specializes [a courier], but all his work was lost. I was therefore concerned that the manuscript should not come into the hands of someone who would use it improperly, and therefore I decided on publication without further delay. I constantly offer prayer<sup>30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 109:4: literally, “I am prayer.” I translated these words as they are understood by the Netziv in <i>Imrei Shefer</i>, in the section beginning with the words “<i>U-ve-osos.” </i>King David was consistently engaged in praying, and therefore he identifies himself with prayer.</i> to the God who fulfills my longing,<sup>31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 57:3.</i> my longing in matters of truth, and does not withhold it from me.

Torah refers to Scripture. Mitzvah – this is the Mishnah, and ‘that which I have written’ refers to the Prophets and Hagiographa.’” In <i>Shemos Rabbah</i>, <i>parashah</i> 28, it is written: R. Yitzhak said, “That which the Prophets were to prophesy in the future to subsequent generations was received from Mount Sinai. For Moses said to Israel, ‘[Not with you alone do I seal this covenant…] but with whoever is here, standing with us today before the Lord our God, and with whoever is not here with us today,’<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 29:14, 15.</i>…[A similar idea is found in the verse], ‘The burden of the word of God to Israel by Malachi,’ [literally, “in the hand of Malachi”].<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mal. 1:1.</i> It does not say ‘in the days of Malachi,’ but ‘in the hand of Malachi,’ for his prophecy was already in his hand since Sinai, but until then he was not granted the right to prophesy. Similarly Isaiah said, ‘From the time that it was, there am I.’<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isa. 48:16.</i> Isaiah said, I was present at the Revelation on Sinai where I received this prophecy. [However], only ‘now has the Lord God<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi, on Deut. 3:24, translates <i>Adonai Elohim</i> as “merciful in judgment.” See Nahmanides for another translation.</i> authorized me to prophesy<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, “sent me.”</i> and imbued me with his Divine Spirit,’ for until now no permission was given to him to prophesy.”<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since Malachi and Isaiah were born long after the Revelation, they could not have uttered any prophecy earlier because they were not yet alive. The <i>Midrash</i> intimates that God only brought them into the world when permission to prophesy had already been given.</i>",
                    "[If God desired to give the Jewish people the twenty-four books at Sinai], one can ask a strong question from Tractate <i>Nedarim</i> 22b: “R. Adda, the son of R. Hanina, said: ‘Had Israel not sinned, they would have received only the Five Books of the Torah and the Book of Joshua,<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Book of Joshua would be needed to define the borders of Israel and of the different tribes.</i>… as it is written, ‘For with much wisdom comes much anger.’” This Talmudic passage implies that as each subsequent generation sinned it received another book of the Prophets or Hagiographa, for the [receipt of] prophecy [contained in the twenty-four books] was contingent on Israel sinning [and arousing God’s anger].",
                    "However, if you consider further this statement [of R. Adda in <i>Nedarim</i>], you are compelled to conclude that he is saying just the opposite. If you understood his words simply to indicate that there was prophecy because of Israel’s sins and the needs of the times, you could ask the following questions: First, [what does R. Adda’s statement add], as it is obvious that there is no need for a reproach [from God] unless the people sinned? Further, many of the books of the Hagiographa and Prophets are not concerned with the sins [of Israel]!",
                    "However, to quote the commentary attributed to Rashi<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv is expressing the notion that the commentary in <i>Nedarim</i> is not really Rashi’s and is incorrectly attributed to him.</i> [regarding the statement of R. Adda in <i>Nedarim</i>], “Since they [the Jewish people] rebelled and sinned, they received additional wisdom contained in the other books [of the Prophets and Hagiographa] to burden them more.<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, in order to make them work more. This will be explained in the following chapter.</i> Similarly, it says in <i>Koheles Rabbah</i> 1, on the verse, “… it is an affliction that God has given to the sons of man with which to be concerned”:<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Eccl.1:13.</i> “R. Hunia applied this [verse] to the Prophets and the Hagiographa, for had Israel been worthy, they would have received only the Five Books, [however], they were given all of the Scriptures [including] the Prophets and Hagiographa so that they should toil in [learning them] as well as the Torah, and perform precepts and righteous acts so as to receive a good reward.’”",
                    "With this we can explain what is stated in Tractate <i>Betzah</i> 25b, “Why was the Torah given to [the people of] Israel? Because they are impetuous [and the law was given to discipline them].” Rashi comments, “[God] gave them the Torah so that they might study it diligently, for it diminishes the strength [of their evil inclination] and humbles them.” Along these lines, the talmudic and midrashic statements were saying that as [the people of] Israel sinned, they were given additional [sources of] wisdom that entailed [additional] toil to acquire. This explanation answers the difficulty that we had in understanding R. Adda’s statement [in <i>Nedarim</i>], and reconciles it with what is written in Tractate <i>Berachos </i>[that Moses received the Prophets and Hagiographa at Mount Sinai]. When R. Adda said that [because the people of] Israel sinned [they received the twenty-four books], he was not referring to the sins of <i>subsequent </i>generations, but only to the sin of the Golden Calf. For when they sinned with the calf, they showed they were a “stiff-necked people” who needed to study and engage in [additional learning] with which to occupy their time. It was for this reason that [God] transmitted to Moses all that would be prophesied in the future."

                    "<b><small>BECAUSE OF THE DIVINE NATURE OF THE PROPHETS AND HAGIOGRAPHA, THEY HAD TO BE WRITTEN IN A PARTICULAR STYLE</small></b><br>THE EXPLANATION GIVEN above, however, is still not clear. Can it be that because God burdens [the people of Israel] with the twenty-four Books of the Prophets and the Hagiographa, [this prevents] them from sinning? Further, what kind of burden is this? [The burden of learning the twenty-four books] is unlike the toiling that is described in Tractate <i>Betzah</i> 25b, which we previously discussed [in the last chapter]. It was because of [the stubborn nature of the people of Israel] that they were commanded to toil in the study of Torah day and night, even beyond that which was needed to know how to practice, for this would weaken<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, “pluck the strength [of their evil inclination].”</i> the strength [of their evil inclination] and soften their heart of stone. The Oral Law is called <i>Tushiyah</i><sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Prov 3:21, 8:14, etc. Though this word is usually translated as “counsel” or “understanding,” it is linked here to the word <i>mateshes</i> – “weakens” (the body or the evil inclination). See Tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i> 26b, “[Pertaining to the verse (Isa. 28:29), ‘Wonderful is His <i>tushiyyah</i>, His counsel, great is His wisdom.’ R. Hanan said, Why is the Torah called <i>tushiyyah</i>? Because it weakens the strength of man.’” On Prov. 2:7, the Gaon of Vilna says that it weakens the evil inclination.</i> because the light it contains [causes one] to return to the right [path]. However, by [merely] increasing the quantity of the Written Torah, no additional burden would be imposed [to occupy the Jewish people so as to prevent them from sinning].<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv argues that the Prophets and Hagiographa do not require the kind of intense study necessary in learning the Oral Law.</i> Another problem is that the wording of R. Hunia’s statement in <i>Koheles Rabbah</i> does not read well. What connection is there between toiling in the study of the Prophets and Hagiographa and the performance of precepts and righteous acts?<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Also “charitable acts.”</i>",
                    "Another [source] to understand is the <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> [on the Book of Shemos] on <i>Parashas Ki Sisa</i>,<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Parashah 41.</i> wherein it states pertaining to the verse in Ex. 31:18, “He gave unto Moses, <i>ke-chaloso,</i> [that is], when He finished speaking with him.” [This should be read as] “And He gave unto Moses <i>ka-chaloso</i>, [that is], as his bride….” R. Levi said in the name of R. Shimon ben Lakish: “Just as a bride is decked in twenty-four kinds of ornaments, so must a scholar be proficient in the twenty-four books.”",
                    "At first impression, this midrashic statement is difficult to understand because the reference to a Talmud scholar is a digression. Since the verse states, “He gave unto <i>Moses,</i>” should the Midrash not state that Moses [rather than a scholar] was clothed in the twenty-four books? However, what the Midrash says is sound, for there would be no need for the verse to tell us that Moses knew the wisdom contained in the twenty-four books. For all [knowledge of the Torah] was revealed to Moses, even “what distinguished scholars would originate in the future,”<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the beginning of Part 1, chapter 3, where the Netziv discusses this midrashic statement in detail.</i> and this would certainly include the Prophets and Hagiographa. [R. Levi would not need this verse to teach us that Moses knew the twenty-four Books]. Moreover, the R. Levi quoted in this Midrash is not the R. Levi usually cited as the teacher of R. Shimon ben Lakish. Rather, he is the same R. Levi ben Hama, who stated in the name of R. Shimon ben Lakish, whom we cited above from Tractate <i>Berachos</i> 5a, that from the verse, “And I shall give you the stone Tablets, etc.,” it is known that all [Torah knowledge including the Prophets and Hagiographa] were revealed to Moses. [More than anyone else], R. Levi would not need [the verse in <i>Ki Sissa</i>] to inform us that Moses knew the twenty-four books. Therefore, what the midrash is saying is that [Moses is representative of a Talmudic scholar], and since Moses [certainly possessed knowledge] that would equal any [future] scholar, since he [Moses] needed to be clothed in the twenty-four books, we infer that all Talmudic scholars need to be knowledgeable about these writings.",
                    "However, one can [still] question this interpretation of the midrash, for why [would the midrash limit] the need to learn the twenty-four books to Talmudic scholars and not include all Jews? [Why not include] one who reads Scripture, and [since he] is not illiterate – for he reads the Five Books ─ why not require him also to be knowledgeable regarding the twenty-four books? A further question is: [does the midrash imply], Heaven forbid, that no one was considered a complete scholar until all of Scripture was complete, [i.e., given to the Jewish people, which occurred] hundreds of years after the giving of the Torah?",
                    "[In order to comprehend this midrash], one first needs to understand that the sole purpose of the Prophets and Hagiographa is not [to convey a particular] prophet’s chastisements, due to be given at a certain moment, or to make known [to us] a particular occurrence. It surely is impossible to say so, for [in addition to the prophets recorded in Scripture], many more Prophets lived during the times of Elijah, Elisha, and [until the time of] Jeremiah. This is known, as it is written [in several instances], “I have sent them all of My servants, the prophets….”<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jer. 7:25. The verse reads in full, “From the time that your ancestors left the land of Egypt to this day, I sent them all of My servants, the prophets, every day.” This also occurred during the times of Elijah and Elisha, as a similar use of words is found in II Kings 17:13, 23; 21:10; and 24:2.</i> And all of these [not mentioned by name] prophesied and uttered words of chastisement. [See] also <i>Koheles Rabbah</i> 1, which comments on the verse in Eccl. 1:2, “‘There is no remembrance of them of former times.’… Many prophets arose in Israel whose names have not been specified….” [Obviously many of the various prophets’ statements] were not meant to be recorded. [The reason why the prophecies of many prophets were not recorded in Scripture is conveyed in] Tractate <i>Megillah</i> 14a, in which states, “Prophecy needed for future generations was recorded, but that which was not needed was not recorded.” If anyone had recorded their words, he would have transgressed the prohibition that words that are transmitted orally must never be recorded even if they are uttered with holiness.<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is similar to the prohibition not to redact the Oral Law.</i> As it is written, “Do not add to his words”;<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Prov. 30:6.</i> [i.e., do not record things meant to be transmitted orally], even if one is only adding to the Hagiographa. As it is said in Tractate <i>Megillah</i> 7a, “Is this [recorded in Proverbs] the only wisdom that King Solomon articulated?” [Solomon had expressed much more wisdom than what was revealed in Proverbs, yet no one was allowed to record it].",
                    "[The only prophecy that may be written] is the twenty-four holy books, [even though] much of it consists of narratives. Nevertheless, they were intended to be recorded in holiness through prophecy or Divine inspiration.<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ruah ha-kodesh</i>, usually translated as Divine inspiration or the Holy Spirit, is a lower level of prophecy than <i>nevuah</i>. <i>Ruah ha-kodesh</i> indicates how the prophet obtained insights from God regarding a vision or event. With <i>nevuah,</i> however, the prophet heard and communicated actual words that he received from God, though they may have been combined with a vision. Since the Hagiographa was written through <i>ruah ha-kodesh,</i> it was mainly written in a style similar to the manner in which people normally speak, whereas the books of the prophets, which were written with <i>nevuah,</i> were couched in a style unlike the usual manner of speech. Because of these differences, the writings that are classified as the books of the prophets are considered holier than the <i>Kesuvim</i> (Hagiographa). See the Netziv in <i>Emek ha-Netziv</i> on the <i>Sifrei, </i>commenting on the Torah portion of <i>Be-ha’alosecha</i>, <i>pesikta</i> 38, and what he writes in <i>Ha’amek Davar</i> on Gen. 23:1.</i> It is easy to understand [as will be explained shortly], that in addition to that which is revealed, [the narratives in the Prophets and Hagiographa were in many instances intentionally] distorted in order to teach Israel the wisdom and knowledge that is veiled within the words.<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv may be directing this argument against the Tosafos s.v. <i>Man de-hu</i>, in Tractate <i>Ta’anis</i> 15a, that states that the narratives in the Books of the prophets are not <i>divrei kabbalah</i>, words received through Divine inspiration or conveyed from Moses at Sinai. The responsa of the Havos Da’as, <i>siman</i> 9, claims that this Tosafos was written in “great error” by a student of the <i>Ba’alei ha-Tosafos, </i>the Tosafists.</i> There is not a single verse [in Scripture] that does not hint of secrets [of the Torah], the mysteries of science, or matters of ethics. If it appears to us that the [Books of the Prophets] lack substance, it only seems that way to us due to our deficient understanding. This is stated in the Jerusalem Talmud, Tractate <i>Peah</i>, 1:1: [When Scripture states]: “For it is not an empty thing for you, [for it is your life],…”<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 32:47.</i> this is referring to the Torah. For if it appears empty to you, why is this so? This is because you do not toil in the study of Torah. [When Scripture states], “For it is your life,” [when is it your life]? It is your life when you toil in the study of Torah. [The Torah is not “an empty thing” to you when it becomes “your life”; when you toil in its study].”<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Some of this text is not found in our version of Tractate <i>Pe’ah</i>.</i>",
                    "So it is with any [of the prophetic words] that God commanded to be written. As stated in <i>Bereshis Rabbah</i> 85, “The Book of Daniel was not written in chronological order, so that people should not say that it was merely a historical account. [Rather, it is] in order for all to know that he [Daniel] uttered [these words] through Divine inspiration.” The meaning of this midrash is, since [the Book of Daniel] was not written in chronological order – the way in which it would be written if it originated in the human intellect – it is then understood that this book contains concealed matters, and for this reason it needed to be written in this manner. If this was said of the Book of Daniel, which is in the Hagiographa and written in Aramaic,<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Mishnah</i> refers to Hebrew as <i>Lashon ha-kodesh, </i>“the holy tongue,” in order to distinguish it from Aramaic or other “secular languages” spoken by the Jewish people (see <i>Sotah</i> 7:2–4; 8:1).</i> how much more so are the books of the Prophets which are even greater in holiness [written in an ambiguous way, as they conceal hidden matters]. It is because of this [Divine plan] that there are many verses in which because of either extraneous or missing words, the language does not appear to be [written] in a precise manner. All of the thirty-two rules of aggadic exegesis<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These rules are distinct from Rabbi Ishmael’s thirteen rules of biblical exegesis, although some of the latter are contained within the thirty-two rules of aggadic exegesis, which are attributed to R. Eliezer ben R. Yosi ha-Gelili and can be found at the end of Tractate <i>Berachos</i>. The following are a few examples of these rules: 1. Other items or individuals may be included in a scriptural statement by the use of particles such as “<i>es</i>.” Since “<i>es</i>” is used in Gen. 21:1, “And God remembered Sarah as He had said,” we infer that all barren women were remembered together with Sarah. 2. Some words function as a limitation, such as “<i>ach,</i>” which is usually translated as “only.” It states in Gen. 7:23, “and Noah <i>ach</i> (only) remained alive.” We infer from this that Noah was coughing and spitting blood. Since <i>ach</i> is a limitation, we infer that something was wrong with Noah. 3. <i>Gezerah shavah</i>, an analogy through the use of identical words. We infer that the prophet Samuel was a Nazirite because the word <i>moreh</i> (razor) is used concerning both Samson and Samuel, and since it is known that Samson was a Nazirite, we learn that Samuel was a Nazirite as well.</i> and all the toil of the more straightforward expounders of Biblical text [do not provide] sufficient explanations, or elevate one’s understanding [of the verses],<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv uses a play on words regarding the verse in Isa. 40:16, “Lebanon does not contain sufficient fuel, nor are its beasts sufficient for burnt-offerings.” By exchanging the <i>ayin</i> of <i>ba’er</i> with an <i>alef</i>, “fuel” becomes “explanation.” The word <i>olah</i>, meaning “burnt-offering,” can also be translated as “enhancement.”</i> so that one could understand why it was written in an ambiguous manner [and what it intended to teach].",
                    "Similarly, in the Torah there are many verses [that are ambiguously written] as described by the <i>Parchon,</i><sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv is referring to Solomon Parchon of Aragon (mid-twelfth century). He wrote the <i>Mahberet</i>, a complete lexicon of the Hebrew language, compiled from the works of Judah Hayyug, Ibn Jannah; Solomon Ibn Gavirol, and the compiler’s own notes. Parchon, who was born in Calatayud, Spain, was a renowned grammarian and a student of Ibn Ezra.</i> s.v. <i>Ulai</i>.<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There Parchon cites verses that use prepositions in an unusual way where the letter <i>lamed,</i> which is translated as “to,” is to be understood at times as the preposition <i>min</i> (from), or verses are written in a manner or order that could not be possibly be taken literally. For example, in Ex. 14:21, “He turned the sea to dry land and the waters split,” this verse is obviously not written in correct sequence, as the waters would first have to be split before the land could become dry. Also in Ex. 16:20, “It became infested with worms and stank,” it is obvious that the manna would have to spoil before it became infested. There Parchon writes, “You may ask why Scripture confuses us by writing certain items in a reverse manner, or why it writes tersely or in a style that expresses a point contrary to what knowledge dictates, thereby requiring much effort to comprehend [these verses]. I say to you that even though the Creator has provided us with five senses – the ear to hear, the eye to see, the nose to smell, the palate to taste and the hand to touch – nevertheless, we must rely on our intellect [rather than on our senses]. For a person often believes [based on his senses] that something will occur or that something is true, and [yet after applying] his intellect, he sees that it is not so. For this reason, the Torah requires us to interrogate witnesses thoroughly with the seven questions, and [the judge] must delay a decision until the true facts [of the case] are revealed…. Heaven forbid [that one should consider these examples of unusual style] to be errors. For they are God’s words, [and He] relied on [human] intellect [to comprehend them]. [He] did not bother to clarify them due to the sheer length [of explanation needed to express all that is intended in that verse]….”</i> Therefore, one is obliged to say that [unusual wording in a verse] does not lack purpose. Rather, the purpose of writing [Scripture in this manner] is to inform us that hidden in the language of the verses are “hidden treasures,” in addition to the revealed and simple meaning of the text. This also applies to the Prophets and Hagiographa, for they are God’s words.",
                    "[WE HAVE ALREADY explained in <i>Harhev Davar, Shofetim</i> [Deut. 18:18], what the Prophet Ezekiel stated in 2:10 [“He spread it before me, and it was written within and without, and there was written therein lamentations, moaning, and woe”].<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv explains Ezekiel 2:10 as follows: “He spread it before me….” Ezekiel realized that God had revealed what was already prophesied at Mount Sinai, and the meaning of the prophetic words was explained to him by the angel, “it was written <i>panim ve-ahor</i>, within and without” – in other words, from the beginning it was written both “within” verses that were to be understood as written, and “without,” with concepts hidden within the Torah, as it is composed of His Holy Names. [It seems that according to the Netziv, <i>ahor</i> should be translated literally as “back” rather than “without” – i.e., “mysterious.” The words “It was written therein: <i>kinnim</i>, lamentations,” can also be translated as “compartments” or “separate sections,” meaning concepts that, although they were written within the verses, do not relate to the context of that section. According to the Netziv in the introduction to his commentary on the Humash, many words in Scripture have dual meanings. Here, <i>kinnim</i> can also mean “separate sections” as well as “lamentations.” The plural of the word <i>kinnah</i> is given in the masculine form as <i>kinnim</i> rather than <i>kinnos</i>.] “… moaning and woe….” The Netziv refers this to laws of nature and science, those commonly mentioned publicly, as well as knowledge limited to a few individuals that cannot be expressed publicly. The words <i>ve-hehgeh va-hi</i>, “moaning and woe,” can also be translated as “spoken of and gasps of astonishment.”</i> This view was also expressed by the Ra’avad in his <i>Hassagos</i> [on the Rambam], towards the end of chapter 2, in the Laws of <i>Megillah.</i> There he stated that there is no book in Scripture that does not contain additional information [external] to the book’s main theme. It is thus understood that one should not compete with Scripture or believe that he can compose language that is equal in beauty. [Nonetheless], there are those who believe that their compositions are even more eloquent than Scripture. However, this is mere vanity, for these [compositions] lack the Living Spirit [embedded] within Scripture – that is, Divine inspiration. For throughout Scripture there are many hints regarding many matters – a feat that would be impossible to accomplish without Divine inspiration. This is similar to one who draws a picture of a man or some other living being. There are some whose [drawings] depict the human being as more beautiful than the thing itself. This does not imply that the one who draws a beautiful picture of a man is a greater artist than the Master of Nature. For since [the artist] is only creating a lifeless form [of a man], he can make a human look better [than the way he appears in real life]. This is not so with one who possesses a living spirit, [whose form] is a result of many factors in nature; he is created with defective and unpleasant [characteristics], [but the reason for many of these deficiencies is unknown] to us since they originate from the secrets of nature.",
                    "Similarly, since parables composed by human beings are comparable to lifeless forms, their wording can be refined so that they are more attractive. This is not so with Holy Scripture, since it contains the living spirit of Divine inspiration. Therefore, the hints and secrets [that Scripture desires to convey] constrain and make it impossible for them [the Prophets] to express [their words] in refined language, because they must also convey [the hints and secrets embedded in their words] which are their splendor and majesty.]"

Derivations related to the context are, for example, those of the sages, of blessed memory, found in the <i>Toras Kohanim</i>, <i>Mechilta</i>, <i>Sifrei</i> and <i>Midrashim</i><sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Plural of <i>midrash</i>.</i> that add flavor to the contextual exegesis. On the other hand, [the sages also] expounded [verses] in a manner that was not related to the context of that section of Scripture at all. For example, our sages concluded in Tractate <i>Kiddushin</i> 68a, that we derive a major principle that the marriage of a Jew to a Canaanite slave is ineffective,<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gen. 22:5. Gen. 22 pertains to the Binding of Isaac at Mount Moriah. When Abraham saw the mountain from a distance, he ordered the two young men with him, “Stay here by yourselves with the donkey.” The two superfluous words, <i>im ha-hamor</i>, “with the donkey,” can also be read as <i>am ha-hamor</i>, meaning they are “a nation similar to a donkey” in respect to legal status for marriage.</i> from a verse [in the narrative of the Binding of Isaac], “[And Abraham said to his young men], you stay here with the donkey,” [since, like a donkey, the Canaanite slave is a chattel of his master]. [Another example is the way the sages derived a law pertaining to the halachic definition of bread and matzah from a verse in a passage discussing the punishments God will inflict on the Jewish people if they do not follow His commandments]. The verse states, “Ten women will bake your bread in one oven”<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lev. 26:26.</i> [because people will be so destitute]. <i>Pesahim</i> 37b states that R. Yehuda derives from this verse that only dough baked in one oven is considered bread, meaning that [halachically] it is not considered to be bread if it has [first been fried] and then baked.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The conclusion in <i>Pesahim</i> is that once dough has been fried, it cannot become bread by being baked in an oven.</i> [Since] it is not considered bread, it is exempt from the requirement that <i>hallah</i><sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Hallah</i> is a portion that was separated from the dough and given to the <i>kohen</i>.</i> must be taken. Many other examples of derivations of laws not related to the context could also be cited.",
                    "One can also find more extensive applications of this method of derivation external to the context of a passage in the <i>Aggadah.</i><sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A<i>ggadah</i> means “narrative” – a rabbinic teaching which expounds Biblical narrative, history, ethics and prophecy. The <i>aggadah</i> developed in Israel from the Second Temple period to approximately 500 C.E. It includes parables, allegories, prayers, laments, polemics, stories, homilies, theology, ethics and letter symbolism. The material is found in midrashic literature with scattered traces throughout the Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmuds. <i>Aggadah</i> does not have the same authority as Halachah.</i> There, deductions and exegesis relate to ethics and rules of proper conduct. This approach of inferring [concepts and laws] both related and unrelated to the context of a passage, is equally applicable to the Prophets and Hagiographa, because they were written through prophecy or Divine inspiration. Contextual inferences permit many possible interpretations of a particular verse, and this is the essential value of something being written through holy inspiration.<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv appears to be saying that regarding verses written in Scripture by means of <i>ruah ha-kodesh</i>, Divine inspiration, the inferences are mainly related to context. In <i>Ha’amek She’elah</i> 8:10, the Netziv writes that while the <i>Kesuvim</i> are written mainly by means of <i>ruah ha-kodesh</i> because they are written in ordinary human language, the Prophets are written in a language that differs from ordinary speech. Awkward language in a particular verse is believed to indicate a hidden meaning that does not relate to the context.</i> See the <i>Midrash Vayikra Rabbah</i> 14, where it states pertaining to the verse, “‘I will proffer my opinion from afar, etc.’ (Job 36:3) If this verse was said by Elihu of his own accord, he is entitled to praise; if through Divine inspiration, [he is entitled] to supreme praise.” [If the verse originated through Divine inspiration], it [can provide us with many insights] through the various interpretations [pertaining to the context that may be found in this midrash].<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To the Netziv, this <i>midrash</i> is saying that if this statement was uttered by Elihu, the friend of Job, without Divine inspiration, we could derive limited significant Torah knowledge from it. However, if it is uttered with Divine Inspiration, many Torah insights can be derived from his words.</i>  Examples of [inferences from the Prophets and Hagiographa] not related to the context of the passage can be found in [the mishnah in Tractate <i>Shabbos</i>] 83b: “From where do we know that a ship is not susceptible [to <i>tumah</i> contamination?<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ritual impurity transmitted through contact.</i> From a verse [Proverbs 30:19, 20], ‘Four things I do not know… when a ship in the heart of the sea [has passed].’”<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Gemara explains, “It is obvious that a ship is in the midst of the sea, but we are informed explicitly that just as the sea is ritually pure, so is a ship ritually pure.”</i> [Another example can be found] in Tractate <i>Eruvin</i> 73a, in which R. Yehuda ben Bava allows slaves who live in separate houses in a courtyard shared with their master to be considered as a single household. [His ruling is] based on the verse, “Daniel [a servant in the royal household] was in the gate of the king.”<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Dan 2:49.</i> [Further] see Tractate <i>Hagigah</i> 26a, where it states, “During the festival, <i>ammei ha-aretz</i><sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An ignorant person who may not be scrupulous in his observance of mitzvos.</i> are trusted regarding even the spiritual purity of <i>Terumah</i>. Whence is this [law] known? R. Yehoshua ben Levi, said, ‘A verse states: All the men of Israel gathered to the city like one man, <i>haverim</i>, comrades.’”<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Judges 20:11.</i> [We see from this verse that when Jews gather in one place] during the Festivals, Scripture considers them all <i>haverim</i>.<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A Torah scholar who is meticulous in his observance of mitzvos.</i>",
                    "We also find this method [of making unrelated inferences from the Prophets and Hagiographa] in the <i>Aggadah</i>. See Tractate <i>Berachos</i> 10b,<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The text cites 9b.</i> where it states [pertaining to what the Shunammite woman said to her husband regarding the prophet Elisha’s holiness, “She said to her husband, ‘See now, I know that he is a holy man of God], who passes by us <i>tamid</i>, regularly.’”<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Kings 4:9.</i> R Yose ben R. Hanina said in the name of R. Eliezer ben Yaakov: [the word <i>tamid</i> in this verse teaches] that if anyone hosts a Torah scholar in his house and gives him benefit from his belongings, Scripture looks upon him as though he brought <i>tamid</i> offerings<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>tamid,</i> or continual offering, is a communal sacrifice that is offered daily.</i> to the Altar.” Certainly the Shunammite woman did not intend [to teach this ethical concept], but since the prophet, [under Divine inspiration], articulated her words [in a particular way], they invited homiletical interpretation. All of Scripture is “like a hammer that breaks the rock into pieces,”<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Part 1, chapter 1, to see how the Talmud explains Jer. 23:2.</i> [having numerous interpretations] that [emanate from the verses], just as sparks shoot forth [from the anvil of the mason]. Some sparks land where he [the mason] stands, while others land in outlying locations that he never anticipated they would reach. Similarly, Scripture hints of many matters and secrets, even those that do not relate in way to the context of the passage.",
                    "[This concept] can be used to interpret Tractate <i>Megillah</i> 7a, where there is a disagreement as to whether the Book of Esther was composed for the purpose of reading [on Purim], or for being written down and included in the Holy Scriptures. [According to the understanding of Tosafos, Shemuel is of the opinion that the <i>Megillah</i> is not to be written down but to be taught verbally and on Purim recited from memory]. Tosafos then questions [this ruling of Shemuel], as [the mishnah in <i>Megillah</i> 17a] rules that the <i>Megillah</i> must be read from a written text, not from memory. [Based on his interpretation of Shemuel], Tosafos is pressed to answer that it was the rabbis who ruled that it should be written [and read on Purim from a text]. However, my understanding is that [both opinions agree that the Book of Esther must be written]. Their disagreement is whether or not it was composed under Divine inspiration for the sole purpose of being read on Purim to publicize the miracle. If it was not written for any other purpose [than Purim] it would not be worthy of being included among the Holy Scriptures, even though it was written under Divine inspiration. It would be similar to the words of the other prophets that were not [allowed] to be written, because they did not contain any other subject matter hinted [at in their words], which were applicable only to a particular time [or circumstance]. Similarly, if the Book of Esther was written only in order to publicize the miracle of Purim for subsequent generations, it should not be considered conducive to interpretations other than those that relate to the particular context. [If however, the Book of Esther] was written [under Divine inspiration] to be included in Holy Scripture, like the Book of Daniel, etc., one therefore might derive from it [concepts and laws] that are unrelated to the context.",
                    "It appears to me that [that this difference between Shemuel and the other rabbis] is echoed in the disagreement regarding how to explain the verse [in the Book of Esther], “They confirmed and took upon themselves….”<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Esth. 9:27.</i> Shemuel, consistent with his argument [that the Book of Esther was written only to be read in order to publicize the miracle of Purim], concludes that this verse relates solely to Purim. [According to Shemuel] the verse indicates that they confirmed above [in the Heavenly court] that which [the Jews] undertook below [in the earthly court].<sup>20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tractate <i>Megillah</i> 7a. Shemuel cites this verse to prove that the Book of Esther was written with Divine inspiration. Without this inspiration, the authors of the Megillah could not have been aware of the Heavenly Court’s proceedings.</i> According to Rava, the verse is positing that [the Jews] affirmed in the days of Ahashverosh that which [Israel] had already accepted in the days of Moses.<sup>21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tractate <i>Shabbos</i> 88a.</i> It is from this verse that it is derived that “they established in the days of Ahashverosh that which they had already accepted in the days of Moses.” There are strong grounds for believing [that at Mount Sinai] the people were coerced into accepting the Torah,<sup>22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since Ex. 19:17 states, “They stood at the foot of the mountain.” R. Avdimi, the son of Hama ben Hasa, said, “This teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, held the mountain over them like a barrel. He said to them, ‘If you accept the Torah, well and good. If not, this shall be your burial place.” R. Aha the son of Jacob stated, “From here we see that <i>moda’ah rabbah le-oraisa </i>[there is basis] for a strong protest against the Torah” (since the Torah was forced upon the Jewish people under duress).</i> but “[nevertheless they accepted the Torah again willingly in the days of Ahashverosh].” [We therefore see] that Rava proclaimed [a principle] pertaining to the Torah,<sup>23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The second word in the phrase “<i>moda’ah rabbah le-oraisa</i>” is written by the Netziv as Rava, which is the name of the great amora. This play on words changes this phrase to mean “Rava proclaimed an understanding pertaining to the Torah (or Torah law).”</i> [based on the Book of Esther], which demonstrates [that the Book] was composed to be included in the Holy Scripture [since concepts and laws] can be derived from it, even though they do not specifically pertain to the context of the [story of Purim]."

                    "<b><small>WHY A SCHOLAR MUST BE PROFICIENT IN THE TWENTY-FOUR BOOKS OF SCRIPTURE</small></b><br>[USING THE ABOVE-MENTIONED] explanations, we can now arrive at the proper interpretation [of the previously cited] <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> on the <i>parshah</i> of <i>Ki Sissa</i>. Let us start by noting that when the Midrash states that a Talmudic scholar must be proficient in the twenty-four books, it clearly cannot mean that he should become versed in Scripture superficially, that is, without examining its meaning.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, “the creases are straightened out,” as used in <i>Tosefta Nega’im</i> 1:8, “The creases are straightened out and then the leprous spot is examined.”</i> [A superficial understanding] will not benefit his scholarship. This would be analogous to a bride who carries her ornaments crumpled in her hands. In this situation, the ornaments do not make her beautiful in the eyes of others. In fact, the opposite occurs, for she then makes it known to everyone that she lacks intelligence and does not understand the real value of those valuable items and how to use them. Therefore, the meaning of the Midrash is that a Talmudic scholar must be diligent in translating the texts [of the verses properly] and [then] extracting from them the wisdom, ethics, and good character traits that are expected of him at a particular time. The extent to which one understands the Holy Scriptures is proportional to the level of wisdom of the particular scholar. Just as a bride’s ornaments are of varied worth and beauty, so is it certainly true that a scholar who is erudite in Scripture becomes more recognized than Talmud scholars [who lack this Scriptural erudition]. Nevertheless, in general, [the twenty-four books bring some form of honor] to [every] Talmud scholar who becomes accustomed to infer [various] matters from Scripture, as he becomes clothed in righteousness and the fear of God. There is no aspect of ethics or wisdom in the world to which Holy Scripture does not allude, whether by using terms that are unexpected or different from common usage, or by the doubling of words in the verses.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chapters 8 and 9 contain an example of the Netziv’s analysis of a verse written with a doubling of words.</i> Our sages of blessed memory searched throughout the Book of <i>Ben Sira</i><sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An ancient work comprising part of the Apocrypha; according to some scholars it was written in approximately 250 B.C.E., while according to others, it was written during the Second Temple period. According to one tradition, Ben Sira was a son of the prophet Jeremiah.</i> and, except for one phrase,<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv is referring to the following phrase, which may be proverbial: “A thin-bearded man is sharp-witted, a thick-bearded man is a fool [and] one who blows away the froth in his mug is not thirsty.”</i> they could not find there a single concept that was not alluded to by Scripture, as described in Tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i> 100b. It is known that the Book of <i>Ben Sirah</i> is filled with many rules of proper conduct and ethics, and it must be that the sages knew all of these [precepts] by studying the Holy Scriptures. The interpretation of the Midrash in <i>Ki Sissa</i> is now very clear. Just as a bride is involved with her dowry and all the other details necessary to enter the marital home, she also strives to find favor in the eyes of her groom and of all those who rejoice with her. Similarly, becoming a Talmud scholar entails, in addition to learning all the essential laws necessary for practicing [Judaism], clothing oneself in the proper character traits, ethics and wisdom that are hinted at in the twenty-four books so as to find favor in the eyes of God and man. Through this [understanding], his path becomes pure and righteous in his daily affairs, so that he is concerned with the love of his fellow men, protecting their honor, and pursuing their interests, desires, betterment and welfare.<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The deans of the Volozhin Yeshivah placed great emphasis on concern for the welfare of one’s fellow man. This is demonstrated by what Rav Itzeleh writes in the introduction to his father’s book, <i>Nefesh ha-Hayyim</i>: “In every respect, he [Rav Hayyim Volozhiner] minimized his own honor so as to enhance that of Heaven…. Even as his strength was leaving him, when he lay sick in bed… his eyes were directed heavenward to utter the Name of Heaven out of [concern for the] pains of the community and individual. [His concern was coupled] with his moaning greatly and sighing bitterly, to the extent that his intense sighs would shatter the being of anyone who heard them. (In fact, he was accustomed to chastise me in this matter, for he felt that I did not properly involve myself with the suffering of others. He constantly communicated to me [that concern for others] is the essence of man, for he was created not to be [only] for himself, but to be concerned for others to the extent of his ability to act). He taught and fulfilled the precept ‘Love peace and pursue peace, love humankind and bring them close to the Torah’ (Avos 11:10).”</i> Through him [the Talmudic scholar], the Name of Heaven becomes sanctified. This is stated in Tractate <i>Berachos</i>, in the chapter entitled <i>Ha-Roeh</i>,<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I found this Talmudic statement in Tractate <i>Yoma</i> 86a.</i> pertaining to the verse, “You shall love God,”<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 6:5.</i> [so] “that the Name of Heaven shall be beloved through him, so that people will say, ‘Fortunate is his father and the teacher who taught him Torah.’”<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yoma states, “Abayye explained: It was taught, from the verse, ‘You shall love the Lord your God’ (Deut. 6:5), that the Name of Heaven will become beloved [to others] because of you. If a person studies Scripture and <i>Mishnah</i> and attends to the needs of the scholars, is honest in business and speaks pleasantly to others, what do people then say concerning him? ‘Fortunate is the father who taught him Torah; fortunate is the teacher who taught him Torah.”</i>",
                    "[SINCE ALL THE WORDS of the sages contain hidden meanings], for “honey and milk are under their tongue,”<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These words are similar to Song of Songs 4:11, “Honey and milk are under your tongue.” See how this verse is explained in <i>Hagigah</i> 11b.</i> [it is our duty to understand the symbolism of every facet of an example or metaphor found in their parables]. The reason that our sages of blessed memory used a parable of a bride [with twenty-four ornaments] as representing [the twenty-four books], is that a woman who is not a bride does not wear the twenty-four ornaments, for if she does, people may suspect her of being a harlot. Similarly, one who is not a Talmudic scholar should not be “dressed” in the twenty-four books of Holy Scripture. [This means that] he should not write commentaries and publish them; indeed, he should not study them deeply.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, “he should fold the verses in Scripture.”</i> If someone wishes to interpret [Scripture] according to his own understanding and has not grasped the opinions of our sages of blessed memory, there is concern that he may be a heretic and that he is distorting the verses to suit his own opinion.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This topic is discussed further by the Netziv in <i>Harhev Davar </i>on Deut. 32:3.</i>]"

                    "<b><small>ALL CONCEPTS AND LAWS FOUND IN THE PROPHETS AND HAGIOGRAPHA ARE CONTAINED IN THE TORAH</small></b><br>IT IS WELL-KNOWN how, in <i>Ta’anis</i> 9b, R. Yohanan asked rhetorically: “Is it possible that there is something in the Hagiographa to which Moses did not allude in the Torah?”<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The quoted gemara states in full: “Another time R. Yohanan met the child of Resh Lakish and said to him: ‘Tell me the verse [you learned today in school]’. The boy replied: ‘The foolishness of man perverts his way; and his heart frets against the Lord’ (Prov. 19:3). After pondering for a while over the matter, R. Yohanan said, ‘Is it possible that there is something in the Hagiographa to which Moses did not allude in the Torah? Said the boy: ‘Is this verse not alluded to in the Torah? Is it not written, ‘Their heart failed them, and they turned trembling one to another saying: What is this that God has done to us?’ (Gen. 42:28). R. Yohanan lifted his eyes and looked at the boy in astonishment….”</i> In the <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> to <i>Naso</i> 10, it also states, “[You will find that in this section Moses intimated that Samson would become a Nazirite]. This is to teach you that there is nothing in the Prophets and Hagiographa that Moses did not refer to in the Torah.”<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There the <i>Midrash</i> applies the word “man” in Num. 6:2, “…A man or woman who clearly utters a Nazirite vow….,” to the angel who came to instruct the parents of Samson that he was to be raised as a <i>Nazir</i>.</i> It is because of this understanding that the [sages] toiled and searched, striving to find many hints in the Torah of matters that were explicitly stated in the Holy Scripture [of the Prophets and Hagiographa]. [For example, in Tractate <i>Yoma</i> 38b, the Gemara asks from where it is known that “the mention of a righteous one is for a blessing.” The Gemara first argues that [this is obvious], as it is known from an [explicit] verse [in Proverbs 10:7]. The [Gemara] then [clarifies the issue] and determines that the real question is where this concept is known in the Torah. See also [the eighth] chapter [of <i>Bava Kamma</i> entitled] <i>Ha-hovel</i>, [which demonstrates] that the Sages labored and found many ethical concepts and rules for proper conduct [that are alluded to] in the verses of the Torah.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Bava Kamma</i> 92a–b, which cites sixteen different exchanges between Rava and Rabbah the son of Mari, regarding rules of conduct in daily life that are inferred mainly from the Torah. This is a strong proof that the sages devoted significant effort to infer these concepts from the Torah. Examples discussed there include: “Eat early in the day in summer because of the heat, [and early in the] day in winter because of the cold”; “If your friend calls you a donkey, take a saddle off a donkey and place it on your back” (in other words, a person should accept the insult without argument); “If you follow after a man of means, you will take away chunks of fat for yourself” – if you associate with the wealthy, some of their substance will rub off on you.</i>",
                    "Indeed, the [spiritual and mental] strength of the early generations was very great, and, as a result, they [already] saw in the Torah the illuminating insights that were later incorporated in the writings [of the Prophets and Hagiographa]. They accomplished this by applying intricate exegesis to the Torah, perceiving the variations of each and every stroke of the letters.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Kotz</i> can be translated as “crown,” as in the Aruch. Jastrow translates it as “stroke of a letter.” We find that the sages derived concepts from the tips of the letters, as for example in <i>Menachos</i> 29b, “to teach mounds of rules on every tip [of letters in the Torah].”</i> Due to their brilliant intellect, which shone before them, [they made manifest] that which was merely hinted at in [the Torah]. [Although they limited their exegesis to the Torah, they discerned the principles enshrined in the later writings and] could [also] be described as being diligent in the study of the twenty-four books.<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This answers the previous question of the Netziv, that if a scholar must be diligent in the Twenty-four Books, that would imply that the sages of earlier generations could not be considered true scholars.</i> I mean to say is that [the earlier generations] were able to grasp [solely] from the Torah those insights which the later generations [could] acquire [only] through [studying] the twenty-four books of Holy Scripture.",
                    "We can now understand the Gemara of <i>Nedarim</i> 22b: “Had [the people of] Israel not sinned, they would have received only the Torah and the Book of Joshua.” The Gemara is stating that all [those concepts] which we find today and which were derived from the twenty-four books, the [Jewish nation] had derived [in earlier generations] from the Torah of Moses. However, when the people sinned [beginning with the golden calf], their eyes dimmed and their intellect could no longer understand all that was contained [within the Torah]. Therefore, they were given the Prophets and Hagiographa so they could draw from them what was needed to bring bliss to the Jewish soul. In fact, these are the very same words of the <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> to <i>Koheles</i> that I cited in Chapter 1 [of this section]: “[The people of Israel] were given all of the Scriptures [consisting] of the Prophets and Hagiographa in order to toil in [studying them] as well as the Torah, and perform precepts and righteous acts so as to receive a good reward.” It is clear that the purpose of these Holy Books is [that people should] labor [in their study] so as to gain proper character traits and to do as much good as possible to mankind, and that they receive a just reward [by sanctifying God’s name throughout the world].",
                    "[USING WHAT WE WROTE above, we can answer an objection raised by the Ra’avad [in <i>Mishneh Torah</i>], Laws of <i>Megillah</i> 2:18 against the Rambam’s [literal interpretation of the] Jerusalem Talmud<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Megillah 1:5.</i>, that in the days of the Messiah, all the books [of the Hagiographa and Prophets] will be annulled, except for the Book of Esther. Ra’avad questions [why the other books of the Prophets and Hagiographa would be nullified], for in addition to the simple understanding of these texts, there are inferences made through exegesis [of these Books] that can be applied to other subject areas of the Torah.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra’avad argues that the proper interpretation of the Jerusalem Talmud is not that the other Holy Books will be nullified except for the Book of Esther, but merely that they will no longer be read publicly.</i> However, this is not a question at all, for in the time of the Messiah, we will have the merit to [perceive all the concepts] that are [referred to] in the Prophets and Hagiographa.

One approach is to make inferences based on the context of the passage, taking heed of every stroke of the letters, so that one [either] arrives at the purpose [of that verse in relation] to the Halachah, or develops a deep understanding of the story or the conversations that are recorded.",
                    "The second method uses meticulous exegesis regarding language that does not fit well with the message [that the verse or <i>parashah</i>] seemingly conveys. [In such a case,] one investigates [the meaning of the verse further], thereby finding much wisdom and knowledge pertaining to halachah and aggadah that is unrelated to the context [of the verse or the passage].",
                    "[These two approaches] are expressed in the verse, “If you search for her [Torah knowledge] as silver, and if you hunt for her as hidden treasures, then you shall understand the fear of the Lord….”<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Prov. 2:4, 5.</i> This means that in earlier generations, one who merited to acquire Torah knowledge needed to search out the halachah through rigorous analysis of the passage, like one who toils in order to extract silver that is embedded in base metals that are found in its locale [that is, related to the context of the passage], as well as to search for treasures that are not found in its locale [that is, not related to the context of the passage]. After this, [the scholar] was required to arrange the laws [he had derived] in a well-organized manner. This is taught in the <i>Mechilta</i> on the <i>parashah</i> of Mishpatim: “‘[These are the laws] that you shall set before them.’<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ex. 21:1.</i> This teaches us that the laws should be set before [the people of Israel] as a set table.” This is also taught in Tractate <i>Eruvin</i> 54b, where it states, “[How is it known that a teacher should teach his students so] that it is well organized in their mouths?

                    "After which the Prophet continues, “<b>To whom is He teaching knowledge?” </b>(this pertains to the judges) “<b>and to whom is he imparting wisdom?”</b><sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 9.</i> (to whom, meaning those who debate and refute arguments at the gate of the academy). “<b>To those just weaned from milk,”</b><sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 9.</i> (for there were many Jews in Isaiah’s time who were accustomed to eating dairy foods; as Solomon stated in Proverbs, “There will be enough goats’ milk for your food, for the food of your household, and life [sustenance] for your maidens.”<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">27:27.</i> [A further proof that dairy products, rather than meat, were their main staple], can also be seen in Tractate <i>Hullin</i> in the chapter entitled <i>Kissui ha-dam</i>,<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">84a.</i> “‘…will ensnare,’<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lev. 17:13.</i> teaches us that one should not eat meat except after much preparation.”<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Rashi: one should not accustom himself to eat meat at all meals. Rather, it should be a luxury that requires special preparation.</i> Since the [people at that time] were in excellent health, it was proper for a Talmud scholar to reduce his food intake even of dairy foods. As it is taught in a mishnah in [Avos], “This is the way of Torah: Eat bread with salt, [drink water in small measure],” etc.<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Avos 6:4.</i> Isaiah [also] directed this admonition [against excessive indulgences] towards those “weaned” from dairy foods. [For if a Talmud scholar conducts his life in such a manner], he will then have the ability to make rulings and understand legal discussions. One can also add in homiletic fashion [that the phrase, “weaned from milk,” is referring to Talmudic scholars].",
                    "Tractate <i>Berachos</i> 63b says [pertaining to the verse], “‘For the churning of milk produces cream…’:<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Prov. 30:33.</i> [This teaches], Who produces the cream of Torah? The one who regurgitates the milk that he imbibed from his mother’s breasts” [i.e., those who are “weaned.” “Weaned,” as stated in Isaiah, refers to the Talmudic scholars, for they drink from the Torah’s milk – knowledge – from which they produce “cream” – in other words, laws]. <b>“…and torn from the breast,”<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isa. 28:9.</i></b> (refers to a diminution in the indulgences of life; Scripture compares these indulgences to breasts, as seen in Proverbs 5:19, “Let her breasts satisfy you at all times….” It is known from the Talmudic chapter entitled <i>Kinyan ha-Torah<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The collection of <i>baraisos</i> found in the sixth chapter of Avos is often referred to as <i>Perek Kinyan ha-Torah –</i> the Chapter of the Acquisition of the Torah.</i> that a [non-indulgent lifestyle] is one of the conditions enabling [a person] to acquire [the knowledge of Torah].</i>",
                    "(The Prophet then elaborates as to why reduced indulgence is necessary preparation for acquiring Torah). <b>“Commandment by commandment, commandment by commandment.”</b><sup>20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isa. 28:10.</i> (For there are two categories of commandments – positive and negative – and the Talmudic scholar is required to have a deep understanding and knowledge of the characteristics of both). <b>“… Measuring line by measuring line, measuring line by measuring line….”</b><sup>21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isa. 28:10.</i> (Just as there are two different types of commandments, there are two types of <i>middos</i>, guidelines. The first type [consists] of the rules by which the Torah is elucidated. These rules are called <i>middos</i> because [the applicability of] these rules of inference are dependent upon the subject and upon received traditions. In other words, for every interpretive rule, there are conditions and procedures as to how and when these laws are to be inferred, and in which areas they should or should not be derived. [For example], in the area of <i>kodashim,</i> there is the limiting rule that a law derived by exegesis cannot be used to teach another law by exegesis.<sup>22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Tractate <i>Zevahim</i> 49b: “R. Yohanan said: ‘Throughout the entire Torah we may derive with exegesis a derivative from what is itself a derivative from exegesis, except with the regard to the area of <i>kodashim</i>, sacred offerings, where we cannot derive a derivative from that which is itself a derivative.’”</i> There are many other similar examples. “Tradition” means that many conclusions were drawn from <i>kal va-homer</i>, the rules of minor to major, that were received from Sinai, as it is stated in Tractate <i>Temurah</i> 15b:<sup>23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is actually on 16a. Page 15b states that during the mourning period for Moses, three thousand <i>halachos</i> were forgotten. Page 16a states, “It has been taught: one thousand seven hundred <i>kal va-homer</i> and <i>gezerah shavah</i> and <i>dikdukei soferim</i> were forgotten during the mourning period for Moses.” See Part 1, chapter 3, for an explanation of <i>dikdukei soferim</i>.</i> “Many instances of <i>kal va-homer</i> were forgotten during the period of mourning for Moses.” This means that without the tradition defining when to could apply the <i>kal va-homer,</i> they would not have applied it. (<i>Netziv’s addendum</i> – See [<i>Ha’amek She’elah</i>] 167:2, noting that a <i>kal va-homer</i> can be rejected based on a logical refutation; however, if the law was received [from earlier generations] based on proofs and inference from Scripture, we apply that <i>kal va-homer</i> and do not refute it [since they had traditions as to the applicability of a <i>kal va-homer</i> that are no longer available to us] – <i>End of Netziv’s Addendum</i>).",
                    "The second type of guidelines pertains to ethics and appropriate conduct. These rules of good conduct are not immutable laws, but only applicable to a particular time and circumstance. As it states, “A wise man will know time and manner.”<sup>24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Eccl. 8:5. It appears that the Netziv is translating <i>mishpat</i> as “manner” or “custom.”</i> This means that [the scholar] must be flexible, [and keep his unique character traits] and distinctive<sup>25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I translated <i>tovah</i> as “distinctive.”</i> moral principles for the right moment and circumstances. That is why these rules are described by the word <i>middos</i>, [which can also be translated as “measure” or “calculation”], for one needs to measure [or calculate] when these rules are applicable. In the days of Isaiah, the two types of rules, [that is, the rules of inference and the rules of conduct], were also known as <i>kav</i> [measuring lines] because their applicability is bounded by constraints).",
                    "[The Prophet then continues], “<b>…a little here, a little there?”</b><sup>26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isa. 28:11.</i> (All is not explicitly stated in the Torah, as each law and rule is only hinted to or alluded to in scattered [places], and [one only finds] “a little here and a little there.” Therefore, a scholar needs to toil greatly in order to succeed in comprehending [the rules], so he can gather and collect them in such a way that they are readily accessible as a set table).",
                    "<b>“Indeed, one speaks to this people as with stammering lips and in a foreign tongue….”<sup>27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibid.</i></b> ([This means that] God communicates with Israel as one who stammers. For one does not grasp [what a stammerer wishes to say] until after he hears him stutter a great deal to express one word, and then he listens to more stuttering, after which he perceives another piece [of what the person wishes to express]. [Similarly with Torah study], one infers a law from one story [in Scripture] that may relate to the context of the event and then glean from another story additional information related to the same <i>mitzvah</i>; though the [additional] information is unrelated to the context [of the first story]. [Moreover], even when [a law] has been derived from [a passage] that deals with the context of the derived law, it is similar to hearing information from someone who speaks a foreign language. When one speaks in a foreign tongue, one may be expressing oneself in clear language and in a well-organized way. Nevertheless, the listener, [who does not understand that dialect], does not comprehend what he is saying. He, [the listener], requires an interpreter to translate [the other person’s words properly so as to express] the intent of the speaker. Similarly, even to derive [laws] related to the context [of a passage], it would not be possible to perceive His intent, may He be blessed, without the assistance of the interpreters, that is, the sages of blessed memory [who received the laws and their sources] from the [traditions] given from one generation to another. Therefore [a scholar] must toil with [even] greater diligence to perceive the teachings [of Scripture] that he did not receive by tradition).",

The subject of this verse is that it was the custom of the tribes of Israel to set apart a fund [to support] the soldiers and [cover] their expenses. It is known that men of valor [due to their involvement with military affairs] cannot immerse themselves in the study of Torah, nor are they able to settle the Land [of Israel]. Therefore, for this reason, Jacob blessed Issachar, for he [Issachar], saw that the “rest” of the Torah was good, and that the land was pleasant. [Jacob] did not wish to [bless Issachar] with valorous men, for they loved “to rest between the boundaries,”<sup>31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gen. 49:14.

The previously cited verse, “Not only was Koheles wise; he also taught the people knowledge,” was interpreted to mean that Solomon taught others the methods [the previous generations] used for deriving [laws] received [by his generation]. [This method] comprised of analyzing hints contained in the Written Torah, as stated in Tractate <i>Eruvin:</i><sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">21b.</i> the verse, “he also taught the people knowledge,” means that [Solomon] “taught them through signposts,<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Some translate <i>simanei te’amim</i>, as “signs hinted at,” or “symbols of cantillation.” See note 4 for Rashi’s interpretation.</i> [and explained the laws with analogies].” Rashi explains that [Solomon] established traditions and signs that could be applied to the words of the Scripture and the Mishnah, i.e., the Oral Law. [Rashi] means to say that through meticulous analysis of the language of Scripture or the Oral Law, Solomon found proofs for the received [laws and traditions].<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to this interpretation of Rashi it appears that <i>simanei te’amim</i> should be translated as “indicators of reasoning” or “pointers to understanding.”</i>",
                    "Along these lines, [Solomon] continues, “Koheles sought to find words of <i>hefetz</i>” (delight) – i.e., he sought to discover insights by searching out laws that were not placed [where they seemingly should be]. This is like a person searching for gems, who finds precious stones intermingled with a multitude of rocks and dirt that are worthless [to him]; these types of gems are called “stones of delight.”<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the Jerusalem Talmud in Tractate <i>Peah</i> 1:1, which states that words of delight are symbolic of the words of Torah and precious stones.</i> Similarly, the form of exegesis called “words of delight” applies to the situation that occurs when one is hunting for a given word, idea, or concept at a particular moment, and he finds it alluded to within a multitude of words unrelated to the subject of his present search.<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv is saying that <i>hafetz,</i> usually translated as “delight,” should instead be translated as “words (or items) of choice.” This implies searching for something one wants that is mixed with other items that he does not necessarily desire – in other words, of secondary importance.</i>",
                    "Solomon sought to find hints of laws from words scattered [throughout the Torah], outside their expected context. The verse describing the process of finding “words of delight” also states, “… that which was written in a straightforward manner….” This means [that Solomon also tried] to understand the passage in a straightforward manner related to the context. Obviously, this does not mean that that he sought a superficial understanding of Scripture, i.e., reading [and understanding] the verses as children are taught in school. Rather, this verse intends to [teach that Solomon sought] to find hints [in Scripture] through rigorous exegesis and analysis of each stroke of the letters. When he exerted himself and toiled in this effort, he attained much wisdom and knowledge.",
                    "Solomon then stated that the written words of Scripture are “words of <i>emes</i>, truth.” Solomon was not, Heaven forbid, arguing that the value of Torah is limited to words of truth and the absence of falsehoods. [This could not be so], as the value of Torah is described in Proverbs, not in <i>Koheles</i>.<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Part 1, chapter 1, notes that other than the last few verses, <i>Koheles</i> was written for the non-Jewish nations, which do not study the Torah.</i> Furthermore, did not Solomon communicate with the people who believed with all their heart and soul that the Holy One, blessed be He gave us the Torah? If this is so, who could not know that the Torah consists of words of truth?",
                    "Rather, Solomon has a deep-based intention regarding this matter: he explains why God communicates [through Scripture] as if He were speaking with “stuttering lips” or in a “foreign tongue” that requires one to search out “words of delight”<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Not related to the context of the verse.</i> and “straightforward words.”<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Related to the context of the verse.</i> The reasoning is that since they are words of truth, it was necessary that they be written in such a manner. [To pursue this argument further] we will begin by examining the blessing [recited over the Torah]: “…Who gave us the Torah of truth and implanted eternal life within us.” This has already been explained by the <i>Shulhan Aruch,</i> [<i>Orah Hayyim</i>], 139:10 in that “Who gave us the Torah of truth,” refers to the Written Torah, while [the phrase], “and implanted eternal life within us,” speaks of the Oral Law. At first glance the [wording of this blessing] is incomprehensible, for if God gave us the Torah, it naturally follows that it is the truth. How can it possibly be the opposite?",
                    "However, [within this blessing] is contained a deep matter that has been revealed to us by the holy man of God, Nahmanides, in the Introduction to his Commentary on the Torah, [where it states], “We have an additional tradition of truth that the entire Torah is composed from the names of the Holy One, blessed be He.” (<i>Netziv’s addendum</i> – See the holy Zohar at the beginning of the Torah portion of <i>Korah</i>.<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There the Zohar states, “R. Abba began his Torah lecture with a discussion of the following verse: ‘They are more desirable than gold – even much fine gold; and sweeter than honey – than drippings from the combs’ (Psalms 19:11). How lofty are the words of Torah, how precious, how beloved to [the Heavens] above, how dear to all. For [the words of the Torah] are from the Holy Name and all who are engaged in the diligent study of the Torah are involving themselves with the Holy Name. They [who study it] will be saved from all evil and will experience salvation in this world and in the World to Come….”</i> This is also the intent of what the sages wrote in Tractate <i>Berachos</i> 55a: “Betzalel knew how to re-combine the letters from which heaven and earth were created,” – i.e., the letters of the Torah – <i>end of Netziv’s addendum</i>). [Continuing the quotation from Nahmanides]: “The words [of God’s names] can be subdivided [and recombined] into names [or words] pertaining to other subjects. For example, the first verse in <i>Bereshis</i> can be subdivided into other words… This matter has already been discussed by our master Shlomo<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to Rashi.</i> in his commentary on the Talmud (<i>Netziv’s note</i> – Tractate <i>Sukkah</i> 45a), pertaining to the Great Seventy–two-Letter Name contained in the verses of ‘And he went…’<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ex. 14:19.</i> ‘And he came…’<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 20.</i> ‘And he stretched out….’”<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 21.</i> [For a fuller discussion], see the material in the holy words [of Nahmanides’s Introduction].",
                    "The intent [of Nahmanides’s words] is that it is known that the fifty gates of wisdom were created with His Names, may He be blessed, which are the components of the entire universe, as is discussed by Nahmanides [in his Introduction].<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nahmanides writes: “Everything transmitted to Moses our teacher through the forty-nine gates of wisdom was written in the words of the Torah explicitly or implicitly, in the numerical value of the letters or in the form of letters, whether written normally or with some change in form such as bent or crooked letters, and other deviations, or in the tips of the letters and their crownlets,” and so on.</i> This makes it clear that the world was created with the Torah. This is what is taught in the Mishnah in Avos, Chapter 4,<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Actually it is Chapter 3, <i>Mishnah</i> 17.</i> “The Torah is called a beloved vessel, for with it the world was created.”",
                    "Using this tradition of truth, I offer an explanation through the sayings of [our sages] of blessed memory, who stated in <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 3b, “During the first three hours of each day, the Holy One Blessed be He, sits and engages in the study of Torah.” This statement is not susceptible to a simple understanding. In addition, the Gemara asks, “What does God do by night?… There are those who say that God sits and listens to songs uttered by the holy <i>Hayyos</i> [angels]. As it is stated in the verse, ‘By day God commands His kindness, and by night His song is with me.’”<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 42:9.</i> [During the day God commands his kindness. Since God is occupied with the study and teaching of Torah during the day, it is obvious that the kindness He directs to His creations during the day is related to the study of Torah]. This is difficult to understand, for what kindness does the One Whose name is to be blessed perform while He is engaged in studying Torah? Rashi’s commentary [in <i>Avodah Zarah</i>] explains that God employs his kindness by means of judging, sustaining and teaching Torah [to the souls of children who died very young].<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Gemara questions what God does during the fourth quarter of the day. It answers, “He sits and teaches schoolchildren Torah. As Scripture states, ‘To whom shall one teach knowledge? To whom does one explain a message? To those weaned from [their mother’s] milk, removed from the breasts’ (Isa. 28:9). The Gemara interprets this verse to mean that God teaches Torah to those who are “removed from the breasts,” which means that they died at an early age.</i>  Rashi’s interpretation of this Gemara is that for most of the day God engages in acts of kindness, but in the first three hours of each day, He engages in the self-study of Torah, so to speak. However, the inferences from the verse [in Psalms] do not seem to be as [explained by Rashi].",
                    "It appears that the explanation of the [Talmudic statement] that the Holy One blessed be He, sits and engages in the study of Torah, is [found in the words] formulated by the Men of the Great Assembly in the blessing [pertaining to] God’s creation of the luminaries.<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One of the two blessings preceding the <i>shema</i> that are recited each morning.</i> Within that blessing it is stated, “In His goodness, He constantly renews the work of creation every day.” It is clear that [God] renews Creation in the same manner in which He created it originally, i.e., with His holy names, which are the basic laws of the Torah. [God’s] engaging [in the study of Torah] is called kindness, [since it results in creation. As is stated in the blessing pertaining to the creation of the luminaries], “[Give thanks] to Him who makes the great luminaries, for His kindness endures forever.”",
                    "According to what I have written, this clearly explains what we indicate in the text of the blessing, “In His goodness, He constantly renews the work of creation every day.” The term “He renews,” means exactly what it says: for there is no day comparable to another in [the realm] of the Most-High Source. This is written in the book <i>Nefesh ha-Hayyim</i>, <i>Sha’ar</i> 2:13 pertaining to <i>Tikkunei Tefillah</i>.<sup>20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I found this statement of <i>Nefesh ha-Hayyim</i> in <i>Sha’ar</i> 1, chapter 2, where R’ Hayyim Volozhiner states, “If He, may He be blessed, were to remove His influence from them [His creations] for even a single moment, they would become utter nothingness. This [concept] is similar to what the Men of the Great Assembly instituted in the liturgy: ‘In His goodness He renews daily, perpetually, the work of creation.’ The word ‘perpetually’ is to be taken literally as every single instant. Proof of this is explicitly written in Psalms (136:7), ‘To Him Who makes great luminaries’; [the verse] does not state [Who] made, but ‘[Who] makes.’” In <i>Sha’ar</i> 2, chapter 13, R. Chayyim Volozhiner discusses the way in which prayer influences the creations in the Heavenly realm. He writes, “Every time we pray, it causes new formations in the arrangement of the [Heavenly] worlds and forces…. From the time that the prayers were set in order [by the Men of the Great Assembly] until the arrival of our Redeemer, may he come speedily in our days, there never was, nor will ever be, one prayer like another prayer… [similarly, a person’s own prayers] differ each day from what he [ever prayed before] or whatever he will pray in the future.” That is, the creations in the Heavenly realm above change daily, due in part to the prayers of man, and are constantly renewed.</i> Even though in [the realm] under the sun there is nothing new within the nature of creation, nevertheless [in the realm] above the sun, there is a certain degree of change and renewal. This renewal is achieved through the variations in the combining of His Names, blessed be He, which is the origin of new laws before the Holy One blessed be He. This [concept] is brought by our sages in <i>Bereshis Rabbah</i> 49: “There is not a single day that the Holy One, blessed be He, does not originate a new law in the Heavenly Court, as it states, ‘Hear attentively the fury in His voice, and the sound that emanates from His mouth.’”<sup>21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 37:2.</i> God does not, Heaven forbid, change any of the Torah laws that He has given us to teach and practice, for decisions about Halachah is “not in [the hands] of Heaven.”<sup>22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 30:12. See Tractate <i>Bava Metzia</i> 59b, describing how R. Eliezer, through the use of miracles and a heavenly voice, attempted to convince R. Yehoshua and the sages that the <i>halachah</i> was in accordance with his view. His opinion was not accepted; as R. Yehoshua stated, “[The Torah] is not in Heaven.”</i> [The interpretation of this Midrash] is that before God, may He be blessed, [i.e., in His Heavenly Realm, He] changes the combinations [of His holy names] and the nature of creation in whichever manner.",
                    "What we have [so far] explained is implied in what Scripture states in Proverbs 8:30–31: “Then I was with Him as a nursling, and I was daily <i>sha’ashu’im</i>, ‘all delight’, playing always before Him: playing in His habitable land, and my delights are with the sons of men.” [To understand these verses properly], one needs to understand why there is a duplication of words, and why there is a variation in the words where the Torah is first described as a delight and then as that with which one plays. In addition, why in the first verse is playing mentioned before delight, while in the second verse, delight is placed before playing? [The answer] is that [these verses] describe the two types of forces of the Torah that we have explained. The first type refers to the combination of Divine names used in the creation of the world. This portion of the Torah does not affect the behavior of man;<sup>23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As it does not deal with areas of <i>halachah.</i></i> it is in reference to this aspect of the Torah that the verse says, “I was daily all delight.” Similarly, as used in the Talmud,<sup>24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This sentence is difficult to translate. The Netziv states tersely, “similar to the language of the Talmud,” and one cannot be certain what the Netziv is alluding to. My suggestion is that the Netziv is telling us to interpret <i>sha’ashu’im</i> as the word is used in the Talmud in Tractate <i>Bava Basra</i> 4a.</i> [the word <i>sha’ashu’im</i>, should be translated as something which a person handles, such as by pasting or smoothing it over]. For God daily [directs His attention to His creations] by constantly curling<sup>25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Curling, playing with a lock of hair.</i> and handling them, like a person who is infatuated with something.",
                    "The second aspect of the Torah consists of that which God has given us to keep and practice before the Holy One, blessed be He, by governing the world with reward and punishment for each particular nuance of Halachah. This is described [in the same verse] as “playing always before Him,” for no moment is separated from the power of God’s attention. All that is under the sun, all of that [realm], is influenced by the section of the Torah which is practiced [by man]. In reference to that which exists only before the Holy One, blessed be He [not before man], it commenced at the beginning of creation, [continues] with the daily renewal [of creation], and is followed by God’s administration [of the Heavenly realm].",
                    "However, with man this [sequence of events] occurs in reverse. [First he concerns himself with the section of the Torah relating to what he should practice, after which he concerns himself with the section that deals with the realm of creation]. First we need to occupy ourselves with the thoughts of Torah so as to know what to practice. Scripture applies to this the words, “Playing in His habitable land.”<sup>26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Prov. Chapter 8.</i> The verse is careful to specify <i>His</i> land, since only in Israel is it possible to fulfill all the particulars of the Torah. This is not so outside Israel, as [the Diaspora] lacks many of the <i>mitzvos</i> that are tied to the Land of Israel,<sup>27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Many of the laws pertaining to agriculture, such as <i>shemittah</i> and tithes, apply only in the land of Israel.</i> as well as the sacrifices. It is also for this reason that the Torah is called “The law of the God of the land.”<sup>28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Kings 17:26.</i> After a person merits to be as complete as possible in his practice of all the precepts that he has derived through meticulous exegesis of the Torah, he is then able and, in fact, obligated to understand the various combinations of God’s names so as to understand the various sources of creation. As is stated in <i>Mishlei Rabbati</i> 10, “[After a person dies] the Heavenly Court asks his soul if he knows how the Heavenly Throne exists,” and continues endlessly questioning the soul [in similar vein]. These concepts are concealed from man’s natural intellectual capabilities. It would be impossible for anyone to comprehend these secrets without the knowledge of the combinations of God’s names contained in the Torah. This is the meaning of the verse, “My delights are with the sons of men,” that wherever they may reside, if one is worthy of that knowledge [God provides it to the deserving].",
                    "After all this, the deep intent of the words [contained in the blessing over the Torah], “A Torah of truth,” is now clear. [When we recite this blessing] we are not attempting to verify the truth of the utterances of the Holy One, blessed be He, or the [truth of the] Torah or [of the] commandments given by His mouth, may He be blessed, which He gave us to practice. [Instead, we are testifying] that though we see in the Torah many human conversations and narratives that seem to lack substance – that is, although historically accurate, they nevertheless [contain great wisdom even though they do not appear] to contain any enduring or eternal matter that would merit the title of truth; (all of this is in the Holy Zohar in the <i>parashah</i> of <i>Be-ha’alosecha</i> 149b).<sup>29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There the <i>Zohar</i> uses the phrase Torah of Truth, since everything is contained in it, even the stories, enshrines lofty concepts and secrets that are applicable to the entire Torah.</i> Because of this we declare in this blessing that the entire Torah is truth. The [combination of God’s names] in the verse, “Timna was a concubine,”<sup>30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gen. 36:12.</i> are equal to those found in the verse, “Hear, O Israel.”<sup>31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 6:4.</i> Both verses [consist of the Divine names] that are included in the essence of creation; both verses are the seal of the Holy One, blessed be He, which is [absolute] truth.<sup>32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Sanhedrin </i>64a, where R. Hanina proves that God’s seal is truth.</i>",
                    "For this reason the entire Torah is referred to as the “Truth of the Torah.” This is stated in Tractate <i>Megillah</i> 16b. The <i>Megillah</i> requires engraved lines, since it is like the “Truth of the Torah.”<sup>33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>gemara</i> there states that we learn from Esther 9:30, “Dispatches were sent… with words of peace and truth,” that the Scroll of Esther requires etched lines similar to the Torah of Truth.</i> For a king possesses a well-known seal, and though it be small, it is like an abbreviated proclamation, for his seal represents the banners of his army, as if it were a banner proclaiming to others all that is hinted at in that abbreviated seal. Thus the word <i>emes</i> (truth) functions as an abbreviated seal of the names of God, may He be blessed. For <i>emes</i> is an abbreviation of His names, may He be blessed, [as it comprises] the first, last and middle letters of the [remaining] twenty-four letters of the Torah,<sup>34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are twenty-seven letters in the Hebrew alphabet if we omit letters that are written in the same way but pronounced differently such as <i>shin</i> and <i>sin</i> and <i>bes</i> and <i>ves</i>, while the final letters for <i>chof</i>, <i>mem</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>peh</i> and <i>tsadi</i> are included in this number.</i> and the “Truth of the Torah” is the great seal with which all the various combinations of His names, may He be blessed, are proclaimed. All this is included in the word <i>emes</i> (truth).",
                    "For this reason it was appropriate for Koheles to state [that the words of the Torah “are words of truth”], for [this understanding] propelled Koheles to find “words of delight” that were not found in their expected place, and to find those concepts that are related to the context, that is, written in “straightforward words.” Both are words of truth, and there is not a single letter in the Torah that does not contain a sublime purpose. It is for this reason that the letters could not be written in any manner other than in the particular order [and form] in which they are found. Hence, we rely on the Oral Law to inform us how to comprehend the Written Torah’s hints and clues pertaining both to those related and unrelated to the context."

                    "<b><small>THE WISE AND THE “MASTERS OF COLLECTIONS”</small></b><br>AFTER KING SOLOMON searched and found that which was concealed within the Written Torah, he began to praise the power of the words of the sages: “The words of the wise are like goads, and like implanted nails are the sayings of the masters of collections….”<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Eccl. 12:11.</i> According to the simple meaning, [Solomon] is discussing the strengths of the two categories of Torah giants that exist in every generation. Some are referred to as “wise” because they delve deeply into the Torah in order to produce [novel] laws from Scripture and return the lost laws [to us].<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Perhaps this is a reference to laws that were forgotten during the mourning period for Moses. It may also include laws that would be forgotten in subsequent generations.</i> There are also “masters of collections” who gather the laws that are scattered throughout the Written Torah and organize them in a proper order. We wrote about this in Chapter 6 regarding the prophet Isaiah’s exhortation to [the scholars of his generation that their learning should not consist of], “a little here, a little there.” Indeed, the Torah [itself] exhorts [us] regarding this as well. As stated in Tractate <i>Eruvin</i> 54b, “From whence is it known that [the Jewish people must toil in the study of the Torah] until it is well organized within their mouths? [From the verse], ‘You shall place it [the Torah] within their mouths.’”<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 31:19.</i>",
                    "Osniel ben Kenaz and his colleagues had already organized laws, as they gathered, categorized and produced a collection of the oral laws of one mishnah [i.e., those relating to a particular subject], from the precepts that were scattered throughout the Torah. It is for this reason that [Osniel and his yeshiva] are referred to as “families of <i>soferim</i>.” This is stated in the Jerusalem Talmud, Tractate <i>Shekalim</i> 5:1 , [pertaining to I Chronicles 2:55, “The families of <i>sof’rim</i> who dwelled with Ya’abetz”]:<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Part 1, chapter 6, in which Osniel is also referred to as Ya’abetz.</i> Why [are the colleagues of Osniel] referred to as <i>soferim</i>, literally ‘enumerators’? Because they [grouped all the laws relating to specific topics, which] they then enumerated [according to category]:<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word <i>soferim</i> can be translated as both “scribes” and “those who enumerate.”</i> “Five types of people should not separate <i>terumah</i>”;<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Terumah</i> 1:1.</i> “[There are] five types of [baked goods from which one is] required to separate <i>hallah</i>”;<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Hallah</i> 1:1.</i> “Fifteen categories of women cause their co-wives to be exempt from <i>yibbum</i>”;<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yevamos</i> 2a. For example, if a man dies without issue, his brother is required to marry the deceased’s wife. However, if doing so constituted a violation of Torah law – for example, if the widow were his wife’s sister – then he would be exempt. The <i>Mishnah</i> adds that the co-wives of the deceased brother’s other wives would also be exempt from <i>yibbum</i> since one of his wives has already been exempted. This is explained in detail in chapter 11.</i> “Thirty-six transgressions mentioned in the Torah are punishable by <i>kares</i>”;<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Taharos</i> 1:1. <i>Kares</i> is Divine punishment by premature or sudden death. See chapter 11 where this concept is discussed in further detail.</i> “Thirteen rules [pertain to ritual impurity] regarding the carcass of a fowl”;<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Taharos</i> 1:1.</i> “There are four principal categories of damages’;<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bava Kama 2a.</i> ‘Thirty-nine major forms of work are forbidden on the Sabbath.”<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shabbos</i> 73a.</i> All the details [of the examples cited, which were derived by the yeshiva of Ya’abetz], were not taken from the context of one [Scriptural] location. These [categorizations] were produced by collecting the laws from various, scattered sources. [For example], the mishnah in <i>Terumos</i>, “Five types of people should not separate <i>terumah:</i> a deaf person, an insane person, a minor, one who separates [<i>terumah</i>] from produce that does not belong to him, and a non-Jew.” The exclusion of the deaf person, the insane person and the minor are derived from the passage pertaining to tithes given for the Tabernacle,<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ex. 25:2 states, “They shall take for Me a portion; from every man whose heart motivates him, you shall take My portion.” The Jerusalem Talmud reads the words “every man” as excluding a minor and a deaf person. An insane person is excluded by use of the words, “whose heart (read here as understanding) motivates him.” According to Halachah, minors and the deaf are considered to lack understanding.</i> as stated in the Jerusalem Talmud at the beginning of Tractate <i>Terumos</i>,<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">1:1.</i> whereas the exclusion of the one who is not the owner of the grain comes from the verse in the section of <i>Korah</i>, “So shall you, too, set aside a <i>terumah</i> for God.”<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Num. 18:28. From this verse the Talmud derives that one can only set aside <i>Terumah</i> for someone else if he had permission from the owner to act as his agent.</i>",
                    "[HOWEVER, [IT IS understood that my example does not] accord with the <i>Midrash Tanchuma</i> on the Torah portion of <i>Terumah.</i> This law is also derived from the passage about [the tithes given for the Tabernacle]: “‘From every man whose heart motivates him you shall take.’ [This teaches us] that you can only set aside for <i>Terumah</i>] that which is your own.”]",
                    "This same [approach] is applied to all halachic details. This method of collecting and classifying the laws is [a reflection of] the wisdom of the “Masters of Collections.” When Solomon states that “the words of the wise are like goads,” [he is referring] to the method of deriving [novel] laws from Scripture and understanding tradition properly. He compares [this method] of deriving law from Scripture, to using a goad to train an ox to walk in a proper path so that it may provide life to the world.<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When directing an ox in the proper path it plows the field properly, thereby bringing sustenance to the world.</i> The words of the “Masters of Collections” are like “implanted nails,” as they are nailed in a well-organized fashion, [like] saplings [that are planted in rows] so that they are readily counted, thus enabling one to keep track of the number of plants. We would not be able to count the number of nails if they were not arranged in an organized manner.",
                    "The reason Solomon added that the nails are planted rather than well-organized (a question already addressed extensively in <i>Koheles Rabbah</i>)<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Parashah 12.</i> may be explained according to what we have just explained. The benefit derived from the enumerations of the laws by the “masters of collections” is much greater than the advantage of having nails arranged in a well-organized fashion. Organized nails only enable us to count what is visible, whereas enumerating the Torah laws not only assists us in remembering the Torah rules themselves, such as that there are five types of people who should not remove <i>Terumah</i> (which does not assist one in deciding the Halachah), but also [helps us to] take care to remember the particulars of this rule. For [by understanding why these five are listed and no other,] if one of the five [<i>Terumah</i>] laws should be forgotten, [a scholar] will be able to toil and analyze [the particulars of the four laws he remembers] deeply in order to derive [that forgotten law and thus list the proper number] that corresponds to that enumeration. If one did not know this enumeration, it would not be possible to determine [the scope of the <i>Terumah</i> rule] and reinstate the proper number. For this reason, Solomon compared the benefit of [well-organized laws] to planted nails [resembling] saplings. Just as a sapling’s stem causes the roots to spread in the ground below and the branches above, so is the main purpose of a rule to cause one to remember its particulars by toiling and exerting oneself in the study of Torah. This is the plain meaning of this verse [in <i>Koheles</i>].",
                    "Just as there were two types of Torah giants in the time of Koheles, the “wise” and the “masters of collections,” so too do these two types of Torah giants exist throughout the generations. [For instance], Rabbi Akiva is described as being “an overflowing storehouse.”<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Gittin</i> 67a.</i> [Further,] in <i>Avos de-Rabbi Nasan </i>11,<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is actually chapter 18 of <i>Avos de-Rabbi Nasan</i>.</i> it is taught: “He was like a worker who carried a basket when he went to [market to purchase grain]. When he found wheat, he put it [in the basket], when he found barley, he put it [in that basket], when he found spelt he put it in the basket…. When he returned home, he separated the wheat, the barley, etc. R. Akiva did the same [with Jewish law], as he made the entire Torah into a number of various rings [groups].”<sup>20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Later in this chapter the Netziv explains the meaning of rings as referring to the gathering of laws.</i>",
                    "The explanation of this [passage] is that R. Akiva possessed these two qualities of [Talmudic scholarship] in the most complete manner. When he was involved with teaching in the academy, he applied pilpul with wisdom to the various [subjects] that were discussed there. When he studied by himself, he created signs for the Torah by organizing the details of the various areas of [Jewish law] into separate collections organized [according to topic].<sup>21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv is explaining why the parable uses these examples. Going to market refers to meeting with others in order to engage in pilpul, as one interacts with others in the marketplace. When he returns home, he puts the produce in separate baskets, meaning he categorizes the laws, but this task is done on one’s own.</i> Afterwards he transmitted these collections to his students, [being careful] to transmit to his [best] students [specific] areas [that matched] their talents.<sup>22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i> 86a: “Whenever an anonymous opinion is stated in the M<i>ishnah</i> [the statement is the view of] R. Meir…. An anonymous opinion stated in the <i>Sifra</i> [<i>Toras Kohanim</i>] is [the statement of] R. Yehuda, [and] an anonymous opinion stated in the <i>Sifrei </i>[is the statement] of R. Shimeon. All these [anonymous opinions] are in accordance with R. Akiva.”</i> He transmitted the <i>Toras Kohanim</i> to R. Yehuda and the <i>Sifrei</i> to R. Shimon. These [works] consist of [R. Akiva’s] inferences organized according to the order of Scripture, to which he devoted much wisdom and exegesis. [Since these works follow the sequence of Scripture], not all the laws are organized according to topic. He transmitted the Orders of the Mishnah to R. Meir, who then gathered and collected the details of various laws organized according to topic [that had] been scattered [throughout the Torah]. For instance, in the first chapter of Tractate <i>Berachos</i> pertaining to the [reading of the <i>shema</i>: the sources of the laws of reading the <i>shema</i> are from the Torah portions of <i>Va-es’hannan</i> and <i>Ekev</i>; the law to remember the Exodus from Egypt is derived from <i>Re’eh</i>, and, as stated in the Jerusalem Talmud,<sup>23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tractate <i>Berachos</i> 1:5.</i> the laws of the blessings of the <i>shema</i> are alluded to in the verse [from Psalms], “Seven times a day I have praised you.”<sup>24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">119:164.</i> R. Meir collected the laws as stalks of grain and gathered them into a bundle [organized them in the first chapter of <i>Berachos</i>], as these laws relate to reading the <i>shema</i>.",
                    "These [two approaches] were also applied during the time of the building of the Talmud. Among the writings of the Talmud were works that emanated from the “words of the wise,” who derived them by meticulous analysis of the words and by delving deeply into the deep meaning of the Mishnah. In addition, there were the “masters of collections” who compiled the smaller Tractates<sup>25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Smaller Tractates were compiled during the later part of the amoraic era.</i> such as Tractate <i>Soferim.</i> In fact, in the Gemara itself, we find [“rings”] groupings from many Amoraic statements. Indeed, [the sages] in Tractate <i>Shabbos</i> 104a cautioned, “Make signs for the Torah and acquire it.” Rashi explains that this refers to organizing the laws scattered throughout the six Orders of the Talmud; this constitutes “signs” for the legal traditions of a tanna or amora [that are reflected] in the wording [of the accumulated laws] so they should not be forgotten.",
                    "Similarly, after the completion of the Talmud, our masters, the She’iltos, the Bahag and Rabbi Yitzhak Alfasi, functioned as the “masters of collections,” as they gathered waters from the various sections of the Talmud into a single location. This continued after them with Rambam and the like, while the master Tosafists were the “wise” who delved deeply into the understanding of the Talmud, and they made accessible the plethora of knowledge contained therein. These two types of Torah giants continued from one generation to the next, each according to his approach in wisdom, each according to his method in organization. All that has been stated in this chapter is the understanding of this verse: [“The words of the wise are like goads, and the sayings of the masters of collections, are like implanted nails…”]."
                ],
                [
                    "<b><small>MORE ON GOADS AND NAILS</small></b><br>HOWEVER, the above-mentioned verse, [“The words of the wise are like goads, and like implanted nails are the sayings of the masters of collections…”], requires further investigation. First, why is “goads” written in the plural? Could Koheles not have used this word in the singular? How can we better explain and determine the ideas hinted at in this verse?",
                    "Second, why does Koheles compare [well-organized laws] to nails? They should have been compared to plants in a vineyard that are [well-arranged] in rows of two, which would better express the main intent of the verse. Certainly, there must be a deep meaning [intended by] the word “nails.”",
                    "Third, [if it is true], as described above, that “goads” relates only to the “wise,” [who make inferences,] while “nails” relates to the “masters of collections,” it would have been better for Scripture to state, “The words of the wise are as goads; the masters of collections are as implanted nails.”<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note the differences in the order of descriptive phrases in relation to the “Masters of Collections” and the sages.</i>",
                    "One must therefore translate this verse as [follows]: “The words of the wise are like goads and implanted nails; like goads and implanted nails are the masters of collections.”<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv argues for a grammatical rule that when a verse has two clauses with two defining clauses, and the order of the first clause and its defining clause is reversed with respect to the second clause (as in: clause 1, defining clause 1; defining clause 2, clause 2), then the defining clauses must be applied to both clauses. Since the verse states, “The words of the wise (clause 1) are like goads (defining clause 1) and like implanted nails (defining clause 2) are the sayings of the wise (clause 2),” the verse should be read as follows: clause 1, defining clauses 1 and 2; defining clauses 1 and 2; clause 2. This explains why the verse was not more clearly stated as follows: “The words of the sages are as goads and those of the masters of collections are like implanted nails.”</i> [This manner of translation is similar] to how our sages applied exegesis in Tractate <i>Bava Metzia</i> 61a, to explain [two terms denoting interest], <i>neshech</i> and <i>tarbis</i>.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Torah uses two different terms to denote interest, <i>neshech</i> and <i>tarbIsa. Neshech</i> is literally “that which is bitten,” as it refers to how interest bites into the borrower’s assets. <i>Tarbis</i>, which means “increase,” refers to the increase of the lender’s assets that result from the interest he collects. The Talmud in <i>Bava Metzia</i> states that the two terms refer to interest coming from both loans of money and food. This is derived by applying a similar method of translation to the verse in Lev. 25:37. “You shall not lend him your money with <i>neshech</i>, [nor with] <i>marbis</i> shall you lend him your food.” The Talmud states that it would have been better to write, “You shall not lend him your money with <i>neshech</i>, nor your food with <i>marbis</i>,” without inverting the order of what is being lent (money and food) with the terms that describe the type of interest (<i>marbis</i> and <i>neshech</i>). The Talmud therefore concludes that <i>neshech</i> and <i>tarbis</i> must be read twice and are connected with both the first and second clause. The verse would then read, “You shall not lend him your money with <i>neshech</i> or <i>marbis</i>, nor with <i>neshech</i> or <i>marbis</i> shall you lend your food.”</i> [That there is such a grammatical rule is evident] by its application in numerous locations, such as explained there by the Tosafos, s.v. <i>Kari Beih</i>.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tosafos cites several places where this grammatical rule has been applied in the Talmud, such as Tractates <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 20a, <i>Pesahim</i> 21b and <i>Hullin</i> 114b.</i> Therefore, [based on my translation of the verse in Koheles], there are two advantages to both the “wise” and the “masters of collections” [conveyed by the words “goads” and “implanted nails”] that need to be addressed.",
                    "We will begin by expounding the [two advantages] of the “Wise,” in connection with what is stated in Tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i> 34a: R. Assi asked R. Yohanan, “If two [different judges] based their decisions on the same reasoning [but cited] a different verse [as the source of their reasoning], what is the law?” [R. Yohanan answered], “We consider the decisions of these two judges as being only one vote, [since a single law cannot be inferred from two different verses].” What is the source of the [rule stated by R. Yochanan]? Abbaye said, “This is learned from the verse, ‘One thing has God spoken, these two have I heard, that strength belongs to God.’<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 62:12.</i> [This verse teaches us] that one verse can produce many laws, while one law could not be derived from more than one verse.”<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The interpretation of this verse in Psalms 62:12 is that one statement from God (“One thing has God spoken”), can have various interpretations (“These two have I heard”), where God would not use extraneous words to express one concept or thought.</i> The Academy of R. Yishmael taught, “[pertaining to the verse] ‘as a hammer that breaks the rock into pieces,’<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jer. 23:29. The complete verse is, “Behold, My word is like fire, says the Lord, and like a hammer that shatters a rock.”</i> just as a hammer can produce many sparks,<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv translates <i>nitzotzos</i> as sparks. The Netziv’s interpretation of this verse will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter 10.</i> so can one verse [be interpreted] to produce many laws.”",
                    "[We must analyze this gemara] in order to understand it properly, for the rule itself [that one verse can be interpreted in various ways to derive many laws], is, in turn, derived from two different verses. [However], it is impossible to understand the gemara in this manner, for it states immediately above that a single rule or law cannot be derived from more than one verse. Therefore, the [two different verses] actually reflect two different aspects of this rule. There is one situation in which there is no disagreement among those who interpret the verse in numerous ways. For [although] they may derive various interpretations from the same verse, each agrees [that the other scholar’s] interpretation is valid. For example, regarding the verse, “You shall not eat [the sacrifices] with the blood,”<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lev. 19:26.</i> the <i>Toras Kohanim</i><sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Toras Kohanim, </i>which is also known as the <i>Sifra,</i> is a <i>tannaitic midrash halacha </i>on the Book of Leviticus.</i> [on that verse] and Tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i> 63a derive numerous prohibitions.<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Toras Kohanim</i> and Tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i> cite five different prohibitions inferred from these words: 1) not to eat sacrificial meat before its blood has been sprinkled; 2) not to eat the flesh of an unsanctified animal before it dies; 3. not to offer a “meal of comfort” (first meal eaten by the mourners after a funeral) to relatives who are mourning the death of a person executed by the Sanhedrin; 4) if one is a member of a Sanhedrin that sentenced a person to death, not to eat that entire day; 5) if one is a stubborn and rebellious son; not to eat in a manner that will cause him to shed blood.</i> All these [inferences] are derivations of the true law; none contests [the validity] of the other. In addition, it is possible that the same sage can derive many laws from one verse. [Tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i>] 103b states that “Menashe taught fifty-five different approaches to understanding <i>Toras Kohanim</i><sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Toras Kohanim</i> literally means “Priestly Laws.” In this context it is the Book of Leviticus.</i> [Leviticus], while Ahav derived eighty-five different approaches, and Yerovam derived one hundred and three different interpretations.”",
                    "In this manner we can explain the verse, “One thing has God spoken, these two have I heard….” For we have heard [received], two laws that [tell us] what to practice. In truth, there is not a single verse from which one cannot derive many different interpretations. This is stated in Tractate <i>Eruvin</i> 21b in which R. Hisda says in the name of Mar Ukva, “Pertaining to the verse, ‘His locks are wavy,’<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Song of Songs 5:11.</i> one may derive numerous mounds of laws from each stroke of the letters.”<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See explanation in note 4.</i> This [responsibility to derive numerous laws from a single verse] was given to the sages, and they must determine whether any other possible derivations can be made from a verse. Because of this, Koheles compared the sayings of the “wise” to goads, for each and every facet [of the sages’ inferences] is a goad of its own. Every interpretation [of the “wise”] indicates a path [that man should take], which [in turn] brings life to the world, as it teaches man how he should behave.<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is similar to the goad that guides an animal like an ox as to the path it is to take, which in turn enables the animal to help sustain the world.</i> [This interpretation] explains well [why] the word “goads” [is plural]."

                    "<b><small>IMPLANTED NAILS SHOW THAT EVEN REJECTED OPINIONS MUST BE STUDIED BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE INSIGHTS IN UNDERSTANDING THE TORAH</small></b><br>THERE IS, HOWEVER, a second method by which the sages derived several laws [from the same verse], one that was used when there was disagreement.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In chapter 9 of this section, the Netziv discusses the derivation of laws when there is no disagreement.</i> One sage holds that a certain law is derived [from certain words in a verse], while the other sage advances an opposing opinion, arguing that a different law is to be derived [from them]. Behold, one opinion is of importance and brings life to the world [instructs us what to practice], while the second is of lesser significance and is not the accepted halachah. Perhaps, Heaven forbid, you might believe that the [rejected] opinion is null and void and is not included within the category of the light of Torah. For this reason [Jeremiah] compared [the opposing derivations by sages] to an “anvil striking a rock.”<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An anvil striking a rock is symbolic of disagreement among the sages, in which there are clashing opinions.</i> It is similar to one who strikes a rock to produce sparks so that he can light a lamp that enables one to walk in the proper path.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the Netziv, the Talmud sees two meanings in the verse in Jeremiah: first, many different interpretations of Scripture that can result from disagreement, similar to the way an anvil shatters a rock; second, these different opinions contain properties similar to the sparks that emanate from the anvil as it strikes the rock.</i> Although when one strikes a rock he produces many sparks, he is only concerned about the [single] spark that he will use to light the lamp. Yet although the other sparks cease to exist and do not fulfill that purpose, they are unequal in how distant they are from achieving that goal. Some sparks do not travel very far, for as soon as they leave the rock, their brightness subsides and they decay until they no longer possess any light. Other sparks will last for a [longer] time and will be able to brighten the area towards where they are traveling. But some flying sparks become caught in certain things [that are flammable], and they create a large bonfire, which was not the intent of the one who struck the rock. Thus it is when the words of the sages are in disagreement.",
                    "One opinion decides the law in accordance [with accepted] practice, which is the main purpose [of Torah study, i.e., to ascertain the true halachah], while the other opinions serve no purpose [in relation] to the decided halachah. Nevertheless, these other opinions, [though they did not] fulfill the main purpose of [leading one to] the true halachah, are unequal [in their effect].",
                    "Some opinions [seem to] have [an insignificant impact], for as soon as they issue from the rock of contention, their brightness is diminished and degenerates to the extent that they no longer contain the light of Torah. For example, the sages in ancient times disputed [whether the verse], “Neither an Ammonite nor a Moabite may enter into God’s community,”<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 23:5.</i> also included a prohibition of marrying an Ammonite or Moabite woman. [Some included such women in the prohibition, while others disagreed]. At the time of the disagreement [the former view] was considered within the] category of words of Torah. [However, once] Boaz came forward, as stated in Tractate <i>Kesubos</i> 7b,<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Boaz assembled ten men when he married Ruth. According to the Gemara, he did this in order to publicize the ruling that one may marry a Moabite woman.</i> and established the halachah for future generations [that the prohibition applies only to Ammonite or Moabite men], the Torah spark [of the rejected opinion] was totally extinguished. Therefore, one studying the opinion of Do’eg<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Do’eg was a Torah scholar and an advisor to King Saul. He later slandered King David and, as stated in I Sam. 22:9–18, was responsible for the destruction of Nov, the city of Kohanim.</i> [as quoted in Tractate <i>Yevamos</i>],<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tractate <i>Yevamos</i> 76b–77a describes how King Saul’s armor was miraculously able to fit David for his fight with Goliath. This indicated to King Saul that David was of royal lineage, which in turn led to a discussion between King Saul, Do’eg and Avner (King Saul’s general), as to whether David, a descendant of Ruth the Moabite, was permitted to marry into the congregation. The Gemara reports that Do’eg argued strongly against allowing David to do so until Yisra the Israelite (II Sam. 17:25) said that he had a tradition from the court of the prophet Samuel that the scriptural prohibition applied only to Moabite and Ammonite men.</i> that Ammonite or Moabite women are included in the prohibition, discovers something that is dissimilar to the rest of the words of Torah. It is unlike a person studying the opinion of R. Shimon in the Mishnah in Tractate <i>Yevamos</i> 76b, according to which Egyptian and Edomite women are not included in the prohibition [in Deut. 23:9].<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse states: “Sons who are born to them [an Edomite or Egyptian] in the third generation may enter the congregation of the Lord.”</i> [R. Shimon’s light of Torah lasted longer and indeed was not extinguished until the Amoraic era]. So it was regarding the decision of Do’eg and Ahisophel,<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Achisophel was a great Torah scholar and an advisor to King David. He is described in II Sam. 16:23 as so wise that his advice was comparable to one making decisions through the <i>urim ve-tummim</i>, the oracle upon the high priest’s breastplate.</i> that they ruled it was permissible [for Absalom to marry] king David’s wife, since [in their view, King David] was subject to capital punishment and was therefore considered [legally] dead<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Midrash</i> quoted there states, “The one [Achisophel] permitted incest and bloodshed [when he counseled Absalom], ‘Go to your father’s concubines’ (II Sam. 16:21). The other [Do’eg] permitted incest, as R. Nahman, the son of Shemuel, the son of Nahman, stated, ‘He annulled David’s status and declared him an outlaw and as one already dead, so that anyone could shed his blood or marry his wife without penalty.’”</i> (see the beginning of <i>Bereshis Rabbah </i>on the Torah portion of <i>Noah</i>).<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Parasha 32.</i> Clearly, this opinion receded, and has no light of Torah.",
                    "In a similar manner, during the Second Temple period, there was a dispute as to whether the <i>Hagigah</i> sacrifice overrides the Sabbath.<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bringing a sacrifice involves the performance of acts such as slaughtering an animal, which are included in the thirty-nine main categories of work that are prohibited on the Sabbath.</i> Tractate <i>Pesahim</i> 70b states that according to Yehuda ben Dortai and his son, the <i>Hagigah</i> sacrifice overrides the Sabbath, just as the paschal lamb does. Rav asks, “What is the reasoning of Ben Dortai?” [Rav analyzes Ben Dortai’s opinion], after which R. Ashi replies, “Must we come and explain the reasoning of those who separate themselves?”<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to one who refuses to follow the majority opinion.</i> Thus we see that according to [R. Ashi], this spark had vanished and should no longer be discussed. Also see Tractate <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 7b, which gives [several opinions of Nahum the Mede].<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Talmud cites three opinions of Nahum the Mede, to which the rabbis responded, “Let this matter be forgotten and left unspoken.” His three opinions are: 1) it is forbidden to transact business with idolaters on the day that precedes their festivals; 2) one may sell an old male horse to idol-worshippers during wartime; 3. dill is subject to tithes whether harvested as a seed, a vegetable or as shoots. Notwithstanding the admonitions regarding Nahum’s opinions, the Netziv says that they still have value in understanding the opposing opinions. The Gemara itself uses them for that purpose.</i> After each opinion, the Gemara says: “Let this matter be forgotten and left unspoken.” According to Rashi’s second explanation,<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to Rashi’s first explanation, these words are interpreted as, “No one had ever made such a statement.”</i> this statement is to be translated as, “Let this matter not be discussed beyond our debate,” which implies that this opinion is no longer included within the definition of Torah. Who knows how many [other] disagreements of earlier generations came to naught because their brightness was extinguished?",
                    "However, there are many disagreements in which each opinion is itself a lamp that glows with the wisdom of the Torah, even though one of the opinions is not in accordance with the decided halachah. This is obvious according to [the previously discussed] opinion of Tosafos in Part 1, chapter 3, that [individual opinions] retain their significance; for [according to Tosafos], in emergency situations we can rely on a solitary opinion that is lenient. Moreover, [this is true] even though the opinions of Rashi and the Rambam, [discussed in the above mentioned section], hold that it is impossible ever to rule in accordance with the lone opinion.<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This opinion is restricted to when the sages voted on the particular issues. If no vote was taken, it was permitted to follow the lone opinion.</i> For even in those places where the Gemara decides unequivocally against a certain opinion, such as when the School of Shammai argues against the School of Hillel, Halachah is not in accordance with the Academy of Shammai.<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Tractate <i>Eruvin</i> 13b where it rules that Halachah is in accordance with the House of Hillel. See also Tractate <i>Sukkah</i> 3a, in the Tosafos s.v. <i>De-amar lach mani</i>, that according to Rav Amram Gaon, in six instances Halachah follows the School of Shammai.</i> Nevertheless, [Shammaite] opinions contain concepts that shed light upon other areas unrelated to the topic being debated,<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The last clause is literally, “or [their opinions] become caught within the sought-after opinion.” This is like a spark that leaves a rock and ignites something that catches fire, just as when one strikes a rock to produce sparks. His main concern is the one spark that lights the lamp, but other items that are not related to the main topic of discussion become ignited.</i> or have certain aspects that may be useful in determining the halachic matter under discussion.<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For an example, see Tractate <i>Berachos</i> 51b and 52a, where R. Meir and R. Yehuda disagree as to the way the School of Hillel differs from the School of Shammai concerning the order of the blessings in the Havdalah service.</i>",
                    "<b><small>Translator’s note:</small></b><small> Next, the Netziv cites an example to illustrate the significance of opinions that are not in accordance with the accepted halachah. This example is complicated and contains four ways to describe the disagreement between Rabban Gamliel and the rabbis. The Netziv has also included two addenda that have been moved to appendices. If one is not comfortable with reading the Netziv’s analysis of the gemara in Tractate Berachos, one may proceed to the end of the chapter to see the way the Netziv explains how Koheles describes the significance of various differing opinions and how they pertain to the interpretation of Torah. </small><br>Take, for example, the first disagreement that occurs in the six Orders of the Talmud. The discussion relates to when one recites the <i>shema </i>in the evening. [There are three opinions cited in the Mishnah]. According to R. Eliezer, the <i>shema </i>may be recited at nightfall, beginning from the time that the <i>kohanim,</i> who had been <i>tamei</i> – ritually impure – returned home<sup>20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, “enter to eat their <i>terumah</i>.”</i> to eat their <i>terumah,</i><sup>21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>kohen</i> receives a certain percentage of the crops that are grown in the Land of Israel. This percentage is called <i>terumah</i>. Since <i>terumah</i> is considered sacred, it may be eaten only by the <i>kohen</i> when he is in a state of <i>tohorah</i> (ritual purity). A <i>kohen</i> who is ritually impure can only become <i>tahor</i> for the purpose of eating <i>terumah</i> by immersing in a <i>mikveh</i> and then waiting for nightfall. The Gemara defines nightfall as the time when three medium-sized stars may be seen in the night sky.</i> and ends at the completion of the first <i>ashmurah </i>[watch].<sup>22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The night is divided into three watches. Therefore, the first watch ends at the end of the first third of the night.</i> The sages say that it may be recited until midnight, while according to Rabban Gamliel it may be recited until the break of dawn. According to our [the Babylonian] Talmud, the halachah is in accordance with Rabban Gamliel,<sup>23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Tractate <i>Berachos</i> 8b, where R. Yehuda states in the name of Shemuel that the halachah is in accordance with Rabban Gamliel.</i> whereas according to the Jerusalem Talmud, the halachah is in accordance with the sages.<sup>24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv discusses this later in this chapter in the text at n. 28.</i> The opinion of R. Eliezer has certainly been halachically rejected. Perhaps you will say, Heaven forbid, that the words of R. Eliezer contain no light of Torah. However, this is not true, for his opinion provides a spark that enlightens another area [of the Torah]. We learn from his words that the night has three watches, which is in itself deep wisdom and sheds a sublime light.<sup>25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Tractate <i>Berachos</i> 3a, which discusses at length how the three watches correspond to three events that occur both in heaven and on earth.</i>",
                    "In addition, by [properly understanding] the opinion of R. Eliezer, one achieves a correct understanding of the opinion of the sages. [Because of R. Eliezer’s opinion], the sons of Rabban Gamliel questioned the scope of their father’s opinion and that of the sages. As it states in <i>Berachos</i> 9a, [Rabban Gamliel’s sons came home from a banquet after midnight and asked their father], “Do the sages who say that one may read the <i>shema </i>until midnight disagree with you [regarding the Torah definition as to when the <i>shema </i>may be read, and therefore hold that the <i>shema</i> cannot be read under any circumstances after midnight], and that when there is a disagreement between the majority and minority, we follow the opinion of the majority? Or perhaps the sages agree with you on the definition of the Torah law [and concur that according to the Torah, the <i>shema</i> may be read until dawn], and that when they said [one may only recite the evening <i>shema </i>until midnight], it was only in order to distance a person from sin? Rashi explains this discussion as the following: [Do the sages disagree with your understanding of how late the Torah allows one to read the <i>shema</i>]? That is, do the sages agree with R. Eliezer that <i>be-shochbecha</i> refers only to when people are <i>preparing </i>to go to sleep, and their disagreement with R. Eliezer is only regarding the time period in which people prepare to go to sleep? Or do the sages perhaps agree with you [that the Torah allows one to read the <i>shema</i> the entire night, and <i>be-shochbecha</i> means when people are sleeping]?<sup>26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus, the sages are only stating a rabbinic decree to prevent people from delaying the recitation of the <i>shema</i> and becoming susceptible to falling asleep until dawn.</i>",
                    "[ONE SHOULD NOT question [why Rabban Gamliel’s sons’ questioned regarding the scope of the sages’ opinion based on what the Gemara states about the opinion of the Sages] in <i>Berachos</i> 4a. There the Gemara asks, “The Sages [who hold that the <i>shema</i> may be read only until midnight], with whom do they agree? If they hold like R. Eliezer, let them state like R. Eliezer [that the <i>shema</i> must be read prior to the end of the first watch]?” Rashi explains that if the sages agree with R. Eliezer, who explains <i>be-shochbecha</i> as ‘when people are preparing to go to sleep,’ they should not allow anyone to read the <i>shema</i> after the first watch, since by then, anyone who was planning to go to sleep for the night has already done so? Therefore, how could Rabban Gamliel’s sons question [the Sages’ interpretation of <i>be-shochbecha</i> if it is the same as defined by R. Eliezer, for then the Sages should have required the <i>shema</i> to be read prior to the end of the first watch?]",
                    "Although the commentaries have already discussed this issue, I would like to offer the following solution. Concerning the morning <i>shema,</i> there is a disagreement between the Tanna Kamma<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tanna Kammah refers to the first anonymous opinion stated in a <i>Mishnah</i>.</i> and R. Yehoshua as to when it may be read, the resolution of which depends on the definition of the Scriptural term, <i>u-vekumecha</i>, “and when you rise up.” According to the Tanna Kamma, the morning <i>shema</i> may be read only until sunrise, as that is when most people get up. However, according to R. Yehoshua, the morning <i>shema</i> may be read until the end of [the first] three hours [of the day], as that is when royalty arise – i.e., we take into account the period when the minority arise. Since the Talmud decides in accordance with R. Yehoshua, we consider the practices of the minority for determining the time for reading the <i>shema,</i> [at least in the morning], one could argue [with respect to the evening <i>shema</i>], that the Sages who disagree with R. Eliezer hold in accordance with R. Yehoshua that we consider the practices of the minority of people, such as Talmudic scholars and the like, who go to bed around midnight. Therefore, there is room for doubt, as expressed by the sons of Rabban Gamliel [whether the Sages accepted <i>be-shochbecha </i>as defined by R. Eliezer, and considered the sleeping habits of the minority as R. Yehoshua believes.",
                    "However, the Gemara [4a] questions [how anyone could suggest that the sages defined <i>be-shochbecha</i> as R. Eliezer did, i.e., when people are preparing to go to sleep, and considered the minority of people's sleeping habits like R. Yehoshua]. It is clear from the wording of the Mishnah that the sages do not agree with R. Eliezer regarding the evening <i>shema</i>, and they [also] disagree with R. Yehoshua pertaining to the morning <i>shema.</i><sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the <i>Mishnah</i> states this opinion in the name of R. Yehoshua, it is a solitary opinion. If it were in the name of the sages, it would have stated, “The Sages say,” and so on, as worded in the first <i>Mishnah</i>. We infer that the sages disagree with R. Yehoshua. See <i>Meromei Sadeh</i>.</i> [Therefore, since the sages do not hold that we consider the sleeping habits of the minority, they must interpret <i>be-shochbecha</i> differently from R. Eliezer, since the sages state that one can read the <i>shema</i> up to midnight]. Nor does it appear that R. Yehoshua disagrees with R. Eliezer [in which case the Gemara could not argue that perhaps the sages held like R. Yehoshua who would consider the minority of people who go to sleep at midnight].<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv is rebutting a possible argument that the Sages agree with R. Yehoshua. One could argue that R. Yehoshua disagrees with R. Eliezer, thus if the Sages disagree with R. Eliezer , they must agree with R. Yehoshua. However, neither Mishnah indicates that R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua disagree.</i> The sons of Rabban Gamliel, [however], who lived prior to the redaction of the Mishnah, knew only that the Sages disagreed with Rabban Gamliel, and believed that the sages could follow R. Eliezer’s definition of <i>be-shochbecha</i> in relation to the time for reading the evening <i>shema,</i> and also agree with R. Yehoshua [who considers the minority’s sleeping habits for purposes of the morning <i>shema </i>and that his explanation could be applied] to the evening <i>shema.</i>]",
                    "Behold, it is due to R. Eliezer’s opinion that we must analyze the opinion of the rabbis even more deeply. It also appears from the Jerusalem Talmud that there truly are two different views of the sages’ opinion. The Jerusalem Talmud questions how Rabban Gamliel could issue a ruling for others to practice in accordance with his minority opinion, since it is known that when other tannaitic sages disagreed with the majority opinion, they did not act in accordance with their lone opinion. [The Jerusalem Talmud provides two different answers.] One view is that Rabban Gamliel told his sons that in reality, halachah agrees with the sages, [and one can no longer fulfill the mitzvah of reading the <i>shema</i> after midnight]; however, they should still read the <i>shema</i> in order to receive the reward for Torah study.<sup>27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Sha’agas Aryeh compares this to the mishnah in Tractate <i>Berachos</i> 9b: “One who recites the morning <i>shema </i>from that point on [after the third hour, even though he does not receive the reward for reading the <i>shema</i>] does not lose [all of his Heavenly reward], since he is rewarded as one who reads from the Torah.”</i> The second view is that Rabban Gamliel answered his sons that since the time for reading the <i>shema</i> as defined by the Sages had passed, they should read the <i>shema</i> in accordance with his opinion. Prima facie, [the second answer] is difficult to understand, for Rabban Gamliel is still ruling against the sages, for according to their opinion, there is never any reading of the <i>shema</i> after midnight. Therefore, one must argue that these two different answers imply two different interpretations of the Sages’ opinion. The first view is that the sages agree with R. Eliezer that [the time limit is defined by when people are preparing to go to sleep]. Therefore, once midnight has passed, one may no longer read the evening <i>shema</i> under any circumstances, for it is as if the sun had already risen. Those who offer the second opinion, however, hold that the Sages agree [with Rabban Gamliel] that the time period for reading the <i>shema,</i> as defined by the Torah with the word, <i>be-shochbecha,</i> is when people are asleep. [This would invite the conclusion that], according to the Torah, one can read the <i>shema</i> up til dawn, but the Sages stated that one should read the <i>shema</i> before midnight to prevent one from sinning. It is then understandable why Rabban Gamliel instructed his sons to read the <i>shema, be-di’avad</i>, after the fact, i.e., once midnight has passed, for the sages would agree that [even after midnight] one should still read the <i>shema</i> in accordance with Rabban Gamliel’s opinion. Behold, we see that according to the first view, the sages concur with R. Eliezer’s interpretation of <i>be-shochbecha.</i>",
                    "However, after further analysis of this discussion in the Jerusalem Talmud, one sees that it is not possible to offer the interpretation we described above. It is clear from the Jerusalem Talmud that [the rabbis of the Land of Israel were of the opinion that] according to Rabban Gamliel one may deliberately delay the reading of the <i>shema</i> past midnight. The Jerusalem Talmud states<sup>28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is stated in <i>Berachos</i> 1:1.</i> in that section in which R. Yassa [to stress that the halachah is not in accordance with Rabban Gamliel] exhorted Talmud sages who entered the academy to study at night to recite the <i>shema</i>, thus ensuring that they would read it before midnight.<sup>29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There it states, “R. Yassa stated in the name of R. Yohanan that Halachah is in accordance with the rabbis. R. Yassa would charge his colleagues, ‘If you wish to engage [all night] in the study of Torah, [make sure] that you read the <i>shema </i>before midnight and study [afterwards].’”</i> We infer from this, that according to the Jerusalem Talmud, the halachah follows the sages, and it is taken for granted that according to Rabban Gamliel one is allowed at the outset to delay the reading of the <i>shema</i> past midnight. Therefore, one must conclude that [according to the Jerusalem Talmud], when the Mishnah rules that one must read the <i>shema</i> prior to midnight [not because the Torah prohibits any postponement, but in order] to prevent one from sinning. This is indeed the proper interpretation of the Sages, as they disagree with R. Eliezer’s [definition of <i>be-shochbecha</i> that one can read the <i>shema</i> the entire time that people are preparing to go to sleep].",
                    "Thus, we must say that these two answers [explaining how Rabban Gamliel could permit his sons to read the <i>shema</i> after midnight], are only disagreeing as to how the Sages implemented the precautionary rule to distance oneself from sin.<sup>30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, did the sages uproot one’s ability to read the <i>shema</i> after midnight which is granted from the Torah? The <i>Nimukkei Yosef</i> states that the rabbis were given the power to uproot a positive commandment, by applying <i>shev ve-al ta’aseh</i> (“sit and do nothing”) to ensure that people do not sin.</i> In the first opinion, according to the rabbis, even after the fact one cannot fulfill the mitzvah of reading the <i>shema.</i><sup>31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The rabbis have the power to apply a decree and ensure observance by limiting the scope of a Torah law.</i> This, in fact, is [similar to] Rashi’s opinion in <i>Berachos</i> 9b, s.v. <i>O Dilmah</i>: “Nevertheless, if he was unable to read the <i>shema</i> before midnight, there is still time to read the <i>shema.</i>” Rashi means that the sages disagree, [holding that] even after the fact, [if one deliberately] delayed reading the <i>shema,</i> one cannot read it after midnight. One can only recite the <i>shema </i>after midnight if one was unable to do so before midnight.<sup>32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, it was delayed by accident.</i> The Jerusalem Talmud, [however], does not differentiate [between a deliberate and an inadvertent delay, and opines that according to the sages one cannot fulfill the mitzvah of reading the <i>shema</i> after midnight regardless of the circumstances]. This is why Rabban Gamliel told his sons that they could read the <i>shema,</i> for they would not be going against the sages, [even though the sages ruled that one could no longer fulfill the mitzvah of saying the <i>shema</i> at that time, they would nevertheless agree that one could read the <i>shema</i>] because they would receive reward for Torah study by doing so. The second answer is given by those who hold that according to the Rabbis [their ruling was only a precaution, so that where there was a delay], and a person did not recite the <i>shema</i> before midnight, he could still fulfill his obligation by reciting the <i>shema </i>after midnight.",
                    "[FROM WHAT HAS been discussed regarding the way in which the Jerusalem Talmud differs from the Babylonian Talmud in their interpretations of the opinions of Rabban Gamliel and the rabbis], it is clearly possible to suggest that the rabbis instituted their rule as a precautionary measure to the extent that if one was delayed, he could not read the evening <i>shema</i> after midnight. This interpretation of the sage’s view addresses the objection raised against this opinion as expressed by the great genius, the Sha’agas Aryeh.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Aryeh Leib Gunzberg (1695–1785), one of the three teachers of Rav Hayyim Volozhiner, is commonly referred to by the name of his classic work, <i>Sha’agas Aryeh</i>. In the Laws of <i>Kerias Shema</i>, <i>siman</i> 4, he discusses whether, from the outset, a person can delay the reading of the evening <i>shema</i> until dawn. He analyzes in depth two possible approaches to the disagreement between R. Gamliel and the sages. One possibility is that both R. Gamliel and the sages allow one to read the <i>shema</i> until dawn, but R. Gamliel allows one to delay the reading of the <i>shema</i> after midnight from the outset, while the sages do not allow us to delay its reading from the outset. The second possibility is that R. Gamliel holds that from the outset one is not allowed to delay the reading of the <i>shema</i> after midnight. However, if one did delay after midnight, R. Gamliel allows the <i>shema</i> to be read until dawn, while according to the sages one is no longer allowed to recite the <i>shema</i>.<br>The Rif and the Rambam, as understood by the Sha’agas Aryeh, agree with R. Gamliel as in the second approach. The Sha’agas Aryeh, based on his interpretation of the Jerusalem Talmud, argues against the Rambam, and preferring the first way of describing the differing opinions between R. Gamliel and the rabbis. The argument of the Sha’agas Aryeh is based on his understanding that the Jerusalem Talmud considers both possibilities and rejects the second. He also believes that the Jerusalem Talmud understands the opinions of R. Gamliel and the rabbis similarly to the way they are understood by the Babylonian Talmud.<br>The Jerusalem Talmud questions how R. Gamliel could rule against the rabbis by allowing his sons to read the <i>shema</i> past midnight, when it is seen from several examples, that sole authorities always instructed others to follow the majority opinion rather than their own. The first answer is that in reality they could no longer fulfill the mitzvah of <i>shema</i>; however, the sages allow one to read the <i>shema</i> past midnight as this would at least fulfill the mitzvah of learning Torah. This answer is rejected by the Talmud, since they could fulfill this even past dawn and the <i>Mishnah </i>should not have specified that the question referred to the time before dawn. The second answer is that R. Gamliel’s instruction to his sons did not contradict the rabbis, since they also allow one to read the <i>shema</i> past midnight. As explained by the Sha’agas Aryeh, if the sons had questioned R. Gamliel prior to midnight, he would have ruled that they are not allowed to delay the <i>shema</i>, as they are required to follow the majority opinion. However, since midnight had already passed, he told them to read the <i>shema,</i> for the Rabbis agreed that it could be read up until dawn. It is then clear that according to the second opinion, R. Gamliel allows one from the outset to delay the <i>shema</i> past midnight. Since, according to the Babylonian Talmud, the Halachah follows R. Gamliel, the Sha’agas Aryeh disagrees with the Rambam and allows one to delay the reading of the <i>shema</i> past midnight from the outset.</i> It would then follow logically that Rabban Gamliel also agrees that from the outset one may not delay the reading of the <i>shema</i> past midnight, which [indeed] is the opinion of the Rif. The Rif proves from what the Talmud states in [<i>Berachos</i>] 4b: [that according to all opinions, one may not intentionally delay the reading of the <i>shema</i> past midnight]. The Gemara there states, “The sages made a fence for their words, for a person should not come from the field in the evening and say, I will first go to my house and eat a little…. A deep sleep will come over him, and the result will be that he will sleep all night [and not read the <i>shema</i>].”<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the Talmudic text: “In reality it is R. Gamliel’s view that they adopted, and the reason for saying that the <i>shema</i> may be read until midnight is to distance a person from sin. It has been taught: The sages made a fence for their words, for a person should not come in from the field in the evening and say, I will first go to my house and eat a little… drink a little and sleep a little, and afterwards I will recite the <i>shema</i> and pray. A deep sleep will come over him, and as a result he will sleep through the whole night [and omit the <i>shema</i>]. Rather, when a person returns from the field in the evening, he should go directly to the synagogue… recite the <i>shema</i> and pray. [Only then] should he eat his bread and recite the blessing afterwards. Whoever transgresses the words of the sages is liable to the death penalty.”</i> Therefore, since [this precautionary measure instituted by the rabbis that a person should not] eat or sleep prior to the reading of the <i>shema</i> is in accordance with all opinions, even including Rabban Gamliel, so all the opinions agree that from the outset one may not delay the reading of the <i>shema</i> past midnight intentionally regardless of whether he eats or drinks. The disagreement between Rabban Gamliel and the rabbis thus pertains to one who [intentionally] delayed the reading of the <i>shema</i> past midnight. According to the rabbis, one thereby forfeited his right to read the shema, while according to Rabban Gamliel, he may continue to read the <i>shema </i>until dawn]. This is also the opinion of the Rambam<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Laws of <i>Kerias Shema</i> 1:9.</i> of blessed memory, whose view is contrary to the opinion of the Jerusalem Talmud. For according to the Rambam, the Babylonian Talmud disagrees with the Jerusalem Talmud, and we follow the Babylonian Talmud.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv rebuts the Sha’agas Aryeh’s objection against the Rambam (and the Rif) by stating that the Rambam considers that the Jerusalem Talmud understands R. Gamliel and the rabbis, differently from the Babylonian Talmud. Only according to the Jerusalem Talmud does R. Gamliel allow one from the outset to delay the reading of the <i>shema</i> past midnight. According to the Babylonian Talmud, both the Rabbis and R. Gamliel agree that from the outset one is not to delay the reading of the <i>shema</i> past midnight. As a general rule, we follow the opinion of the Babylonian against the Jerusalem Talmud.</i>",
                    "The genius Sha’agas Aryeh argued that such a decree [disallowing] the reading of the shema [past midnight] could not possibly be imposed by the rabbis. According to the Jerusalem Talmud, the rabbis decreed that one could no longer fulfill the mitzvah past midnight [only if a delay could result in severe consequences] such as the punishment of <i>kares</i>, excision, [which would not apply to delaying the reading of the <i>shema</i>].<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Due to this interpretation of R. Gamliel’s statement, the Sha’agas Aryeh is confronted with the problem of what the Jerusalem Talmud means by its statement that R. Gamliel agrees with the sages regarding the limits placed upon the burning of sacrificial limbs and fats – that they may only be burned until midnight. As the Jerusalem Talmud states at the end of halachah 1, “[The <i>Mishnah</i> states], ‘… and all those sacrifices that may be eaten for only one day, the time of the mitzvah extends until the light of dawn rises….’ If it is true [that these sacrifices may be eaten until dawn], why did the sages state that they [may only be eaten] until midnight? [It is in order to distance a person from sin]. One may eat the sacrifices past dawn [while thinking that it is still night], thereby violating a prohibition. [Now that the sages] required a person to eat the sacrifices before midnight, [he will be more zealous], and [at most] will only delay the sacrifices past midnight, thereby avoiding the transgression of a negative commandment.”</i> We see that for the same reason, the rabbis applied this decree [that one could not fulfill the <i>mitzvah</i> past midnight] regarding the eating of the <i>kodashim</i>, holy sacrifices. However, this is not a question at all, for the Jerusalem Talmud stated this law only in reference to [their view of] Rabban Gamliel that one may, from the outset, postpone the reading of the shema past midnight, [i.e., in relation to <i>kodashim,</i> even Rabban Gamliel agreed with the Rabbis that one could not intentionally delay the offering past midnight, since, unlike the shema, <i>kodashim</i> involve the punishment of <i>kares</i>, excision. But according to the rabbis, the punishment of <i>kares</i> was irrelevant]. It goes without saying that this interpretation [regarding the effect of <i>kares</i>] fits well with the Rambam. For according to the Rambam, <i>kodashim</i> may never be eaten, even <i>be-di’avad,</i><sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, “after the fact.”</i> past midnight, as he writes in the laws of <i>Korban Pesah.</i><sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam in the Laws of <i>Korban Pesah</i> , 8:5, states: “… The paschal lamb can only be eaten until midnight [as required by the rabbis] in order to distance one from sin, [although] it is a Torah law that it may be eaten the entire night until dawn.”</i> Yet [in the Babylonian Talmud] everyone agrees that according to Rabban Gamliel, one may read the <i>shema be-di’avad</i> after midnight. [One has to conclude that Rabban Gamliel treats <i>kodashim</i> differently], since they involve the punishment of <i>kares</i>.",
                    "Returning to our topic of discussion, [it has been demonstrated] that the words of R. Eliezer stand on their own as words of Torah, since they may be used to teach us other things [e.g., that there are three watches], and we also see that his words are interwoven with the words of the Rabbis [upon which they shed light]. This is also true of every lone opinion stated in the Mishnah or Gemara, for every such opinion contains a light for a particular purpose, and it is for this reason that it is proper, and indeed required, to study and consider them carefully. Koheles compared this method [of deriving Torah from conflicting opinions] to [the concept of] implanted nails. A fruit tree has many branches that do not produce fruit, and they are therefore unequal in fulfilling their purpose.",
                    "Some branches are stripped bare and the twigs have whitened, so they can no longer accomplish any purpose. However, some branches, even though they do not bear fruit, nevertheless have leaves which serve a medicinal purpose, as is often found with leaves that grow on fruit trees. In addition, the barren branches can be grafted onto a superior tree, and thereby enhance the fruit of the grafted branch so that it produces fruit equal in quality to this [superior] tree. They are then literally like implanted nails,<sup>33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He is discussing grafting, which involves removing an area from the good tree after which the graft is inserted in the cut. Some methods, such as bridge grafting, involve chiseling a T-shaped cut into the tree after which the graft is actually nailed in place.</i> since the branch does not provide any fruit in its current state, and does so only when implanted in another location. King Solomon used the above parable [of goads and implanted nails] to extol the virtues of the words of the “wise,” as they provide new insights in the interpretation of Scripture, whether they are the accepted or rejected halachah. They are like goads and implanted nails. So are the words of the wise ones in every generation, whether they are the sages of the Talmud who attained insights into the words of the Mishnah, or the later Sages who attained insights into the words of the Gemara.<br> <b>Translator’s summary:</b><sup>34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This summary includes Addendum 10B.</i> The Netziv stresses the importance of studying all the opinions stated in the Talmud, even those that are not halachically accepted. He offers two different reasons for this proposition: First, although several halachic concepts may be contained within their words, and one of them may be refuted in that part of the Talmud, the other concepts are of importance to other areas that may not be the main subject under discussion at that particular point. Second, even if these opinions do not contain any light of Torah, i.e., they do not express any concepts that relate to the accepted halachah, nevertheless, when one studies the rejected dissentient views, one obtains a better understanding of the scope of the views that are halachically accepted. The Netziv uses the disagreement between R. Eliezer, Rabban Gamliel and the rabbis to illustrate this point. When we understand the extent to which the rabbis disagree with R. Eliezer, we gain an understanding as to when one is allowed to read the shema. That is, do the Rabbis agree with R. Eliezer that the time for reading the shema is dictated by defining <i>be-shochbecha </i>as the time people are preparing to go to sleep? However, unlike R. Eliezer who defines the time that people prepare to go to sleep with the first watch, do the Rabbis believe that people prepare to go to slep at midnight? Or, perhaps, the Rabbis hold like Rabban Gamliel, who defines <i>be-shochbecha</i> as the time people are sleeping? Thus, Rabban Gamliel and the Rabbis only disagree as to how the rabbinical decree was formulated to discourage people from reading the <i>shema</i> past midnight. Furthermore, since there is a level of ambiguity in understanding how the Talmud perceives the extent to which the sages agree with R. Eliezer, the Sha’agas Aryeh and the Netziv contrast the opinion of Rabban Gamliel with that of the rabbis, and the Netziv discusses four different possibilities, listed in the table below.   According to the Sha’agas Aryeh, both the Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmuds believe that the opinions of the rabbis and of Rabban Gamliel are as in Number 1 above. He therefore disagrees with the decision recorded by the Rambam, that one may not from the outset delay the reading of the shema past midnight, since the halachah is in accordance with Rabban Gamliel. While the Rambam agrees with one view in the Jerusalem Talmud, namely the opinions of Rabban Gamliel and the sages as depicted in Number 2, this was explicitly rejected by the Jerusalem Talmud and the Sha’agas Aryeh assumes that it was also rejected by the Babylonian Talmud. According to the Netziv, the Rambam and the Rif believe that the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds disagree regarding the opinions of Rabban Gamliel and the rabbis. The Jerusalem Talmud presents the first and fourth possibilities, while the Babylonian Talmud puts forth the third option. The Netziv argues that this interpretation (3) is the rationale for the opinion of the Rambam and the Rif, for we follow the Babylonian Talmud when it disagrees with the Jerusalem Talmud."

                    "<b><small>INFERRING LAWS BY ANALYZING HOW THE “MASTERS OF COLLECTIONS” CATEGORIZED SCATTERED TORAH AND TALMUDIC STATEMENTS</small></b><br><b>Translator’s note:</b> In this chapter the Netziv analyzes the way in which categorizations and enumerations in Talmudic and post-Talmudic texts provide valuable insights into the law. To illustrate this technique, the Netziv gives an in-depth analysis of the Mishnah in Yevamos that lists fifteen types of women who exempt their co-wives, and the co-wives of the co-wives, from yibbum and halitzah.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If a man dies without children, his brother must perform <i>yibbum</i> by marrying the widow. If neither she nor all the brothers wish to proceed with <i>yibbum,</i> she and the brothers perform the <i>halitzah</i> ritual, which releases them from their obligation and frees the woman to remarry whom she wishes.</i> The laws of yibbum are complex, and in order to appreciate the Netziv’s analysis regarding the fifteen women, it is necessary to understand at least the following scenario: Man 1, Man 2 and Man 3 are brothers, and Woman A is the daughter of Man 2. Man 1 marries Woman A, together with one or more women whom we designate as co-wives. If Man 1 dies without issue, Man 2 may not marry Woman A or her co-wives, which renders him exempt from yibbum and halitzah regarding all these women. However, if Man 3 marries one of Man 1’s former co-wives together with one or two others, the latter are known as co-wives of the co-wives. Since Man 1’s co-wives are forbidden to Man 2, he may not marry them or any woman who was a co-wife of a co-wife to Man 3 (See the accompanying chart).<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a simple scenario and many more complex situations can arise and are dealt with in Tractate Yevamos.</i>  The rule pertaining to co-wives is based on an inference from Scripture,<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Maimonides in his Commentary on the <i>Mishnah</i> cites Deut. 25:19, “… he who will not build his brother’s house (family).” One who can build his brother’s house in its entirety may build it partially (by marrying one of his brother’s wives); a house that one cannot build in its entirety (since he cannot marry one of the wives) cannot be built even partially. See Rabbenu Ovadiah Bartenura (Bertinoro) on the first <i>Mishnah </i>in <i>Yevamos,</i> which derives this law from the word <i>litzor</i>.</i> whereas the source of the rule pertaining to the co-wives of the co-wives is a matter of debate and is discussed by the Netziv in the addendum to this chapter.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the Netziv, the Babylonian Talmud understands the<i> Toras Kohanim </i>to derive the rule for the co-wives of the co-wives from logic, while the Jerusalem Talmud understands the<i> Toras Kohanim </i>to derive the rule of the co-wives of the co-wives from the word<i> litzror </i>in the Torah.</i> According to all opinions, if Man 1 divorces Woman A, the co-wives of Man 1 are no longer forbidden to Man 2. <br> In order to comprehend the Netziv’s analysis fully, it is important to understand the following scenario: <br>Levi divorces Rivkah and gives her a get (bill of divorce) that stipulates that she may remarry any man except his brother, Shimon. According to the sages, this divorce is invalid, but according to R. Eliezer, it is valid. According to R. Eliezer, with respect to Shimon, Rivkah retains the status of being married to his brother.<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Tractate <i>Gittin</i> 82a.</i> If Aharon, Shimon’s brother, should then marry Rivkah, there is room to argue that if Aharon dies, Shimon may not marry Rivkah or any of her co-wives. <br>It is also important to bear the following rules of yibbum in mind:<br> If a woman is an ervah<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An <i>ervah</i> (one of the twenty-one women listed in Lev. 18 with whom the Torah forbids marriage on the grounds of close kinship) is exempt from both <i>yibbum</i> and <i>halitzah</i>.</i> to a brother, i.e., a forbidden relationship, then that brother is exempt from yibbum.   <br> If a man divorces a woman who is an ervah to a brother, the co-wives are no longer forbidden to that brother. <br>  [NOW THAT WE HAVE addressed the two advantages of the “Words of the Sages” as denoted by the words, “goads” and “implanted nails”], we explain the way these [same words] can be used to inform us of the two benefits [that may result from studying the] “masters of collections.”<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv has in mind commentators who collected various sources and organized them by topic. See those discussed in chapter 8 and in this chapter.</i> At first glance, it may seem that the words of [the “masters of collections”] do not convey any new halachic interpretation, and their only apparent benefit is to enhance one’s recollection of the law. However, [this view is not accurate], for novel laws may indeed be derived from the words [of the “masters of collections”] in two different ways:",
                    "The first way is by elimination.<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The second method is discussed in chapter 12.</i> When the “masters of collections” enumerate laws, they are informing us that only these laws apply in that category, and that no other [possibilities exist]; what they are saying is that only this is the law. For example, [the very first <i>mishnah </i>in <i>Yevamos</i>] states: “Fifteen women exempt their co-wives and the co-wives of their co-wives from the requirement of <i>halitzah</i> and the law of <i>yibbum</i>.”<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the deceased had more than one wife and any one of them is an <i>ervah</i> to a particular brother while the other wives are not <i>ervah</i> to that brother, all the wives are exempt from <i>yibbum</i> and <i>halitzah</i> with respect to that brother.</i> This rule in the Mishnah teaches us that there are only fifteen types of women [who can exempt their co-wives and the co-wives of their co-wives] and that no others [can do so]. If that is so, one can ask why a sixteenth type, that is, the co-wife of a married woman [who was forbidden to the brother of the deceased by a divorce with a limiting clause], should not be included. For example, [suppose] a man divorced his wife [with a limiting clause], saying to her, “Behold, this is your <i>get</i>, your bill of divorce, [with the limitation that you can marry anyone], except for [my brother].” Regarding that brother she is considered a married woman, and she and her co-wives are forbidden to him for purposes of <i>yibbum</i>. [Why is this woman not included in the fifteen types of women listed in the Mishnah who can exempt their co-wives and the co-wives of the co-wives from <i>yibbum</i> and <i>halitzah</i>]? Therefore, [since only fifteen types of such women are described in the Mishnah], one is forced to conclude that a woman [who receives a <i>get</i> with such a stipulation] does not fall into this category [for one of two reasons]. One is that the Mishnah is in accordance with the Sages, and they disagree with R. Eliezer, and hold that this type of divorce is not valid.<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the sages, this is not a valid divorce because a connection to her husband remains. In Deut. 24:1, the <i>get</i>, or bill of divorce, is called <i>sefer kerisus</i>, a writ of severance.</i> Alternatively, the Mishnah may be in accordance with R. Eliezer, whose opinion is cited at the beginning of <i>Ha-megaresh</i>,<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the ninth chapter of Tractate <i>Gittin</i>. This <i>Mishnah </i>is cited on 82a.</i> [concluding that such a <i>get</i> is valid]. [If the Mishnah is in accordance with R. Eliezer that this <i>get</i> is valid, the original question stands and we must ask why such a case is not included in the fifteen types of women listed in the Mishnah]. Tosafos’s answer is given in Tractate <i>Yevamos</i> 9a,<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This explanation of the Jerusalem Talmud is stated by the Tosafos s.v. <i>Le-olam leis leh,</i> in <i>Yevamos</i> 10a.</i> and is based on the Jerusalem Talmud. The Jerusalem Talmud states that even though [the woman with the conditional <i>get</i>] is considered an <i>ervah</i> [to the man prohibited by the divorce stipulation], her status is based on a factor that her former husband has the power to rescind.<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He can give her another <i>get</i> that does not contain this restriction.</i> [This latent power, for example], differentiates the case of the sister of the wife of the deceased [who remains forbidden to the surviving brother according to the Torah, and is thus included as one of the fifteen cases in the Mishnah]. We see therefore that by [analyzing] the enumerations of the “masters of collections,” we can derive laws. For if the Sages in this Mishnah had not provided such an enumeration, and had instead cited a general rule that a forbidden relationship, <i>ervah</i>, that is punishable by <i>kares</i> [excision], exempts her co-wives from <i>yibbum</i> and <i>halitzah</i>, one might be able to argue that the wife of the deceased [who remains forbidden to marry her husband’s brother by a limiting divorce, a condition] that R. Eliezer considers valid, also exempts her co-wives from <i>yibbum</i> and <i>halitzah</i>.<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv is arguing that had the <i>Mishnah </i>been framed in terms of general concepts rather than an enumeration of details, one could argue that the woman subject to the divorce condition was like the other types cited in the <i>Mishnah</i>.</i>",
                    "<b></b>[The Netziv’s Addendum to Chapter 11]<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this addendum, the Netziv presents a remarkable analysis of this Talmudic example of enumeration and demonstrates that the words of the “masters of collections” can create a domino effect, permitting a succession of insights into several areas of Halachah.</i><br>AS WE WILL EXPLAIN, the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds disagree as to what the <i>tanna</i> in <i>Toras Kohanim</i><sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is stated in <i>Toras Kohanim</i>, in the <i>parashah</i> of <i>Kedoshim</i>, Chapter 12. The <i>Toras Kohanim,</i> a collection of <i>baraisos</i> on the Book of Leviticus, is also known as the <i>Sifra</i>.</i> intended [to include in the fifteen categories of women]. As the <i>Toras Kohanim</i> only states, “… there are fifteen categories of women who exempt their co-wives and the co-wives of their co-wives [from <i>halitzah</i> and <i>yibbum</i>], ad infinitem,” and unlike the [the Mishnah in] <i>Yevamos</i>, the <i>tanna</i> in <i>Toras Kohanim</i> does not list the fifteen types of women. It will be explained, that the Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmuds disagree regarding how the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>Toras Kohanim</i> [analyzes the facts of the fifteen types of women], so as to assure that the enumeration of the fifteen types of women is complete.",
                    "For the <i>Toras Kohanim</i> says that when the Torah states [Lev. 15:21], “A man who takes his brother’s wife, she is [like] a <i>niddah</i>,”<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The source that such a woman is exempt from <i>kares</i> comes from the <i>Toras Kohanim</i>’s statement pertaining to Lev. 20:22, “If a man wishes to marry his brother’s wife, she is considered <i>niddah </i>as far as he is concerned. He has uncovered his brother’s nakedness. They shall die <i>aririm</i> [childless].” The <i>Toras Kohanim</i> asks: “Is the verse speaking of the wife of a brother from the same father, or of the wife of a brother from the same mother? Since Scripture forbids a man to marry the sister of his father or mother or his brother’s wife, one could argue thus: Just as a man may not marry the sister of his father or mother, regardless of whether his father or mother are only related to the sister through a common father or mother, so should the wife of his brother be forbidden regardless of whether he is only related to his brother through his father or mother. Scripture therefore states ‘She is [considered] <i>niddah</i>’ in order to teach us that the sister of a brother is forbidden in a manner similar to the way a <i>niddah</i> is forbidden. Just as relations with a woman who is a <i>niddah</i> are forbidden [for a period of time], and there is [a period of time] when she is permitted, so does Scripture forbid one from marrying a wife of a brother who has [a situation] in which she is forbidden, and [a situation] in which she is permitted. What category of a wife of a brother has different situations in which she can be permitted or forbidden? This is the wife of a brother from the same father, for if she has children, she is always forbidden [to her husband’s brother], and if she does not have children, [she is permitted to her husband’s brother after her husband’s death].”</i> [the words, “she is [like] a <i>niddah</i>”] exclude the wife of a man’s maternal half-brother from the prohibition of marrying the wife of one’s brother [thus, he, the maternal half-brother, must perform <i>yibbum</i> or <i>halitzah</i>], as cited by Tosafos in the beginning of <i>Yevamos</i>.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Tosafos, <i>Yevamos</i> 2a, s.v. <i>Eshes ahiv me-immo</i>.</i> This [<i>Toras Kohanim</i>] is also cited in Tractate <i>Shabbos</i> in the Jerusalem Talmud, in the chapter entitled <i>Kelal Gadol</i>.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chapter 7, halachah 2.</i> However, the Babylonian Talmud, in Tractate <i>Yevamos</i> 54b,<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Actually it is 55a.</i> derives an opposite [conclusion] from this verse. For it infers from the words, “she is [like] a <i>niddah</i>,” that there is even the liability [of <i>kares</i>] with the wife of the husband’s <i>paternal </i>half-brother, therefore exempting her from <i>yibbum</i>. It explicitly assumes it to be obvious that the wife of a maternal half-brother is forbidden, [thereby exempting the maternal half-brother from <i>yibbum</i> and <i>halitzah</i>].<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tractate <i>Yevamos</i> 55a deduces that the wife of a maternal brother is forbidden from two verses: Lev. 18:16, “The <i>ervah</i> [nakedness] of your brother’s wife you shall not uncover; she is the <i>ervah</i> of your brother,” and Lev. 20:21, “If a man takes his brother’s wife, she is a <i>niddah</i>; he has uncovered his brother’s <i>ervah.”</i> The words, “the <i>ervah</i> of your brother’s wife,” teach that his brother’s wife is forbidden during her husband’s lifetime (after he divorces her) when he does not have children. The word <i>niddah</i> conveys that she is forbidden during her husband’s lifetime (after divorce) when he does not have children. The phrase “he has uncovered his brother’s <i>ervah</i>” prohibits her if her husband has died and was survived by children. Since all three possible cases are covered by other derivations, the phrase, “the <i>ervah</i> of your brother” is available to teach that the wife of a maternal brother is forbidden.</i>",
                    "At first glance, one may wonder how the [Babylonian] Talmud can disagree with the <i>Toras Kohanim</i>, [as an <i>amora</i> cannot disagree with the rabbis of the Mishnah or with a <i>baraisa</i>]. However, as it will be explained [this is not a question, as the Babylonian Talmud sides with our Mishnah which they interpret to disagree with the <i>Toras Kohanim</i>]. Our Talmud is of the opinion that the <i>Toras Kohanim</i> does not include the wife of the maternal half-brother in the fifteen types of women, and [completes the list of the fifteen types of women] by inserting in place [of the wife of the maternal half-brother] the married woman [with the divorce limitation], in accordance with R. Eliezer. Therefore [it is seen that according to the Babylonian Talmud], our Mishnah, which includes the wife of the maternal half-brother, disagrees with the <i>tanna</i> in <i>Toras Kohanim</i>. However, according to the Jerusalem Talmud, the <i>Toras Kohanim</i> includes the wife of a man’s maternal half-brother, and does not disagree with the <i>tanna</i> of our Mishnah of <i>Yevamos</i>.",
                    "The difference between the Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmuds [regarding the interpretation of the <i>Toras Kohanim</i>], is related to there being two different versions of the text.<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv in <i>Meromei Sadeh</i> on Tractate <i>Yevamos</i> 2a writes that one should not feel uncomfortable with the idea that the two Talmuds have different versions of a <i>baraisa</i>, as we often find that the Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmuds have different versions of a <i>mishnah</i>, as stated by Tosafos in <i>Bechoros</i> 22b.</i> According to the extant version of the Babylonian Talmud,<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yevamos 3b.</i> the <i>baraisa</i> states: From where is it derived that the co-wife [of the widow] is also excluded [from <i>yibbum</i> and <i>halitzah</i>]? From the word <i>litzror</i> [in the Torah]. I have learned that [only] the co-wife is excluded; from where is it derived that the co-wives of the co-wives are also excluded? The Torah therefore states <i>litzror</i>, not <i>latzor</i>.<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The letter <i>resh </i>appears twice in the word <i>litzror.</i> From the extra <i>resh,</i> Tosafos infers that the co-wives of the co-wives are also excluded. <i>Latzor</i> without the extra <i>resh</i> means the same thing.</i>",
                    "Tosafos has already raised a question in <i>Yevamos</i> 2a,<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Tosafos s.v. <i>Ad sof ha-olam</i>.</i> based on what Rav Ashi states in <i>Yevamos</i> 13a, that the co-wives’ co-wives are excluded by logic:<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The text erroneously cites 12a.</i> “Why is the co-wife forbidden? Because the wife’s co-wife takes the place of the <i>ervah</i> [forbidden relative], and therefore the co-wife’s co-wives are also forbidden, since they also take the place of the <i>ervah</i>.” [Why would<i> Toras Kohanim</i> quoted in <i>Yevamos</i> 2b say that the source is the word <i>litzror,</i> when Rav Ashi states that this law is derived from logic?]<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv in <i>Meromei Sadeh</i> cites an example from <i>Kesubos</i> 22a, where it is seen that we do not cite Scripture if a law can be derived by logic.</i> Tosafos is therefore pressed to provide an answer; see what he says [in <i>Yevamos</i> 2b].<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Yevamos</i> 2b, where Tosafos answers that from the word <i>litzror</i> we derive that if there are two brothers, the first co-wife exempts the co-wives of the co-wives. However, Rav Ashi’s reasoning is that this biblical derivation extends even to a case where there are one hundred brothers: each successive co-wife continues to exempt her own co-wife.</i> However, Nahmanides, in [his book] <i>Hiddushei [ha-Ramban</i>], writes that in reality our Talmud does not include within its text [the <i>Toras Kohanim</i> regarding the derivation from <i>litzror</i> to eliminate the co-wife of a co-wife], as evidenced by the Laws of the Rif also quoting this version of the <i>Toras Kohanim</i> [excluding the derivation from <i>litzror</i>], in the text of the Babylonian Talmud. (<i>Note from the Netziv</i> – The extant text found in [our version of] the Rif [that includes the derivation of <i>litzror,</i> has erroneously been] inserted by certain editors [to make the text of the Rif match that of the [erroneous text of the] Babylonian Talmud] – <i>end of the Netziv’s note</i>). However, the Jerusalem Talmud does include the text [of the <i>Toras Kohanim</i>] regarding the derivation from the word <i>litzror</i>. This is what Nahmanides, of blessed memory, states.",
                    "Therefore, you must say that according to the Jerusalem Talmud, we cannot use Rav Ashi’s logical derivation, since they held that we can differentiate between a co-wife and the co-wife of a co-wife. For one can apply the previously cited argument from the Jerusalem Talmud distinguishing between a woman forbidden because of a divorce with a limitation, and a woman forbidden due to her <i>ervah</i> status according to Torah law: the divorce condition can be rescinded, which is not the case with the status of<i> ervah</i>. Further, the Jerusalem Talmud believes that we can argue that since a man can divorce his wife and thereby remove the <i>ervah</i> prohibition from the co-wives,<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The co-wives do not take the place of a woman who has the status of an <i>ervah.</i></i> we cannot derive the prohibition of marrying the co-wives of the co-wives from the prohibition of marrying the co-wives of the <i>ervah</i>.<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The exclusion of an <i>ervah</i>’s co-wife from <i>yibbum</i> applies only when the <i>ervah</i> and the co-wife are still co-wives at the time of the husband’s death. However, if the husband divorced the <i>ervah,</i> the co-wives are no longer excluded from <i>yibbum</i>.</i> [Because of this argument] the Jerusalem Talmud required a verse to teach us not to differentiate between the co-wives and the co-wives of her co-wives, and this answers why the Jerusalem Talmud differentiates [between the co-wives of the woman divorced with the stipulation of limitation, and the other women who are forbidden because of <i>ervah</i>]. At first glance, one can pose a strong question as to why there should be any difference between one <i>ervah</i> or any another, as all are comparable to one another.<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tractate <i>Kiddushin</i> 54b derives from the case of a wife’s sister that marriage does not take effect between two individuals whose relationship would incur <i>kares</i>. As the <i>gemara</i> there explains: “The verse [in Lev. 18:29] states, “If anyone commits any of these abominations, the persons doing so will be cut off from among their people.’ All the forbidden relations are compared to [an illicit relationship] with a sister. Just as there is no marriage in the case of a wife’s sister, there is no marriage with regard to all the forbidden relationships.” Since all the <i>ervah</i> relationships are compared to one another in regard to the effect of a marriage, why should the laws of <i>yibbum</i> involving various types of <i>ervah</i> not be derived from one another? See <i>Meromei Sadeh</i> on Tractate <i>Yevamos</i> 2a.</i> However, since the verse [of <i>litzror</i>] is needed to include the co-wives [to teach us not to differentiate between <i>ervah</i> relationships that can be removed by divorce, and others that cannot be removed, and since we lack a verse to cover the case of] a woman who is forbidden to marry a brother due to a divorce condition, her co-wives are permissible [to her brother]. Therefore, there is no room to say that according to the [Jerusalem Talmud’s version of the] <i>Toras Kohanim</i>, the list of the fifteen types of women includes the woman with the divorce having a stipulation of limitation, which R. Eliezer [rules to be effective]. One is [therefore] forced to conclude that [according to the Jerusalem Talmud, the <i>Toras Kohanim</i>] includes the wife of a maternal half-brother in the fifteen types of women. Even though the wife of a maternal half-brother, is excluded from the punishment of <i>ariri, </i>[excision without leaving issue], that is written in the Torah pertaining to the prohibition of marrying the wife of one’s brother,<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Therefore this raises the question of why the wife of a maternal half-brother would be included in the fifteen types of women, all of whom are subject to excision.</i> she is not excluded from <i>kares</i> [where one dies prematurely, but leaves issue]. Our Mishnah fully agrees [with what the <i>Toras Kohanim</i> lists in the fifteen types of women].",
                    "However, the Babylonian Talmud does not have the version [of the <i>Toras Kohanim</i> which exempts the co-wives of the co-wives from <i>yibbum</i>], from the word <i>litzror</i>; it derives this exemption from the logical argument of Rav Ashi. Therefore, according to the Babylonian Talmud, it would be impossible to exclude the co-wives of a woman [who was divorced with a stipulation of limitation], which R. Eliezer holds is valid, [as it does not believe that one can differentiate between those excluded by being <i>ervah</i> as defined by Torah law, or those excluded by a condition in a <i>get</i>]. Consequently, it is possible to say that the <i>Tanna</i> of <i>Toras Kohanim,</i> who excludes the wife of a maternal half-brother, is also exempting [the brother], from <i>kares</i>. In reality, she [the wife of the maternal half brother], does not exempt her co-wives, and the fifteen women who exempt their co-wives includes the woman [who was divorced with a condition], according to R. Eliezer.<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The list does not include the wife of a maternal half-brother as the total would be sixteen.</i> One must then conclude [that according to the Babylonian Talmud], our Mishnah that lists the wife of a maternal half-brother, disagrees with the <i>Toras Kohanim</i> in the derivation from the words, “she is [like] a <i>niddah</i>.”<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv described this at the beginning of this addendum.</i>",
                    "This explanation, [that the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds disagree in the interpretation of the <i>Toras Kohanim</i>], resolves the objections to Rashi’s definition of <i>kares</i>. [Rashi is of the opinion that] throughout the Torah [<i>kares</i>] is synonymous with the word, <i>ariri</i>, which means [the Divinely-imposed punishment of] dying childless, while only the phrase “death by the hands of Heaven” refers to one dying at a younger age, but [with] surviving children.<sup>20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tosafos in <i>Yevamos</i> 2a, “<i>Eshes ahiv me-immo</i>,” writes that the interpretation of the word <i>kares</i> depends on the context. Tosafos has to take this position because he believes that both the Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmuds have the same version of the <i>Toras Kohanim, </i>which includes the wife of the maternal half-brother among the fifteen categories of women. His argument is based on the following logic: Tractate <i>Yevamos</i> 20a states that a woman is exempt from <i>yibbum</i> only if her union with the brother of the deceased involves the punishment of <i>karesa.</i> Yet we see from the Jerusalem Talmud that a wife of a brother from the same mother is exempt from <i>yibbum</i>, even though they are exempt from <i>karesa.</i><br>We see that according to the Jerusalem Talmud, only the wife of a paternal brother is liable to <i>kares</i>, not the wife of a maternal brother. Why, then, is the wife of a maternal brother exempt from <i>yibbum</i>? Tosafos resolves the question by positing a difference in meaning between <i>kares</i> and <i>ariri</i>. <i>Ariri</i> means dying childless, whereas <i>kares</i> means that one dies young, yet still has children. The <i>Toras Kohanim</i> is stating, according to Tosafos’ view, that the wife of a maternal brother is excluded only from the punishment of <i>ariri,</i> dying childless. However, she is subject to the punishment of <i>kares</i>, premature death.</i> Tosafos’ question is: since the Jerusalem Talmud and <i>Toras Kohanim</i> rule [according to his understanding] that the wife of the maternal half-brother is exempt from <i>ariri</i>, why does such a woman exempt herself and her co-wives from <i>yibbum</i> and <i>halitzah</i>? [A woman is exempt from <i>yibbum</i> only if her union with the brother of the deceased involves excision, and according to Rashi, exemption from <i>ariri</i> includes exemption from all types of excision. Therefore, Tosafos argues that one must conclude that there are two types of excision: <i>kares</i>, dying a premature death, and <i>ariri</i>, dying childless. While the wife of the maternal half-brother is exempt from <i>ariri</i>, she is still subject to <i>kares</i>.] However, according to how we explained [that the Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmud disagree whether the <i>Toras Kohanim</i> includes the wife of the maternal half-brother in the fifteen types of women, we will demonstrate] that they must also disagree [in the definition of <i>kares</i> and <i>ariri</i>]. For according to the Babylonian Talmud, as stated in <i>Yevamos</i> 55a, the reason for the Torah to state [in Lev. 20:20, concerning the forbidden relationship with one’s aunt], “they shall <i>die</i> childless,” and the necessity for the verse [in Lev. 20:21, regarding the relationship of his brother’s wife], “<i>shall be</i> childless,” teaches us the extent to which the punishment of <i>kares</i> is meted out by God; [not only the children born from the time of the transgression and onward will die, but those born before the transgression will also die]. For according to the Babylonian Talmud, whatever punishment is written regarding one <i>ervah</i> must be applied to any other <i>ervah</i>; the reason for stating “childless” is only in order to define <i>kares</i>.<sup>21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the Babylonian Talmud, various types of <i>ervah</i> can be derived from one another, so why is there a need to state the punishment of <i>kares</i> in the verses describing the forbidden relationships with one’s aunt and brother’s wife, since it is derivable without these verses? The Talmud therefore concludes that it is defining how <i>kares</i> is carried out by God.</i> Thus, Tosafos’s question has now been well answered, for according to our Mishnah, the wife of one’s maternal half-brother has not been excluded [from <i>kares</i>], whereas according to the <i>Toras Kohanim,</i> this woman is not included at all within the fifteen types, [and is thus exempt from the punishment of <i>kares</i>].<sup>22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tosafos’s difficulty is based on his understanding that the Babylonian Talmud agrees that the <i>Toras Kohanim</i> exempts the wife of the maternal half-brother from <i>yibbum</i> and <i>halitzah</i>.</i>",
                    "However, according to the Jerusalem Talmud [in Tractate <i>Shabbos</i>], in <i>Klal Gadol</i>,<sup>23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chapter 7, <i>halachah </i>2.</i> [the punishment of childlessness] is where the Torah states, “they will be childless,” [i.e., only if one is intimate with his brother’s wife, he will not have children from that time onward], and infers from the verse, “they shall die childless” [that only by having sexual relations with one’s aunt, he incurs the punishment of his children dying even if they were born prior to that sin]. Therefore, we see that according to the Jerusalem Talmud, we do not infer [the different types of <i>ervah</i>] from one another [and the different types of <i>ervah</i> can incur different types of excision]. Thus, it would logically follow [that according to the Jerusalem Talmud], the wife of the maternal half-brother is only excluded from the punishment of <i>ariri</i>, [being childless] however, [such a woman] is still included within the punishment of <i>kares</i>, dying a premature death [without affecting the children’s lives], similar to the other types of <i>ervah</i>. [Rashi’s definition of <i>kares</i> and <i>ariri</i> is in accordance with the Babylonian Talmud’s definition].<br><b>Translator’s note:</b> The Netziv will be using the opinion of R. Nehuniah ben Hakanah in tractate Kesubos to prove that Rashi’s definition of kares and “dying by the hand of Heaven”<sup>24</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Kares</i> means that one is liable to a premature death without issue, whereas “death by the hand of Heaven” describes premature death for the offender only, not for his children.</i> accords with the Babylonian Talmud. Exodus 21:3 states that “If an ason (fatality) should occur, then you shall give life for life.” This verse teaches the halachic principle, “kam leh be-de-rabbah mineih,” “one is subject only to the greater penalty,” meaning that if the courts have sentenced a person to death and also to a fine, he is subject only to the death penalty. R. Nehuniah extends the “kam leh be-de-rabbah mineih” rule to apply even when one is liable to “death at the hand of Heaven.”<sup>25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Nehuniah holds that one who burns another’s stack of grain on Yom Kippur is exempt from paying damages. Since the penalty for desecrating Yom Kippur is <i>kares</i>, the desecrator is not liable for monetary payment as he considers <i>kares</i> to be more severe than a monetary payment. Although the transgressor on Yom Kippur is liable to <i>kares,</i> the Gemara states that R. Nehuniah applies <i>kam leh be-de-rabbah mineh</i> to any “death by the hand of Heaven.”</i> Kesubos 30a states that R. Nehuniah derives this principle from the usage of ason in reference to Benjaimin in Gen 42:38, “He [Jacob] said to [to Reuben], ‘My son [Benjamin] shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead and he alone is left. Should an ason (disaster) befall him on the journey that you are about to take, then you will have brought down my grey hairs in sorrow to the grave.’”<sup>26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jacob feared that Benjamin would have an accident – i.e., be punished by God on the way, since when a man is in a dangerous situation, such as a journey far from home, Satan takes the opportunity to accuse him before God.</i> Just as ason in Gen. 42:38 refers to a death imposed by Heaven, so does ason in Ex. 21:3 refer to a death imposed by Heaven.",
                    "I would like to add that according to the Babylonian Talmud, <i>kares</i> must be as defined by Rashi, i.e., that both the transgressor and his children suffer excision. [For according to Tosafos, since he regards <i>kares</i> as dying a premature death with no effect on one’s children, he is confronted with how to define the punishment of <i>kares</i> and “dying by the hand of Heaven” as both appear to be the same]. Therefore, Tosafos must define <i>kares</i> as a punishment of dying before the age of fifty, while “dying by the hand of Heaven” is the punishment of dying before the age of sixty. There is a question against this definition because of what the Talmud states in Tractate Kesubos 30a, pertaining to the opinion of R. Nehuniah ben Hakanah, who infers from the word <i>ason</i> [stated in Ex. 21:23<sup>27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In that chapter (verse 22), Scripture states that when men are fighting and one jostles a pregnant woman, causing her to miscarry, but the woman herself does not die, he shall pay the value of the aborted offspring as determined by the court. Scripture continues in verse 23, “But should an <i>ason</i> [fatality] occur, then you shall give a life in place of a life.” This is interpreted to mean, “If there is an <i>ason</i> [one has been sentenced to death by the courts], then you shall give a life in place of a life [and not commute the sentence to a fine].”</i>], and <i>ason</i> as it is used in reference to Benjamin in Gen. 42:38<sup>28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“He [Jacob] said [to Reuben], ‘My son [Benjamin] shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead and he alone is left. Should an <i>ason</i> (disaster) befall him on the journey that you shall take, then you will have brought down my gray hairs in sorrow to the grave.’”</i> that one subject to “dying by the hand of Heaven” is exempt from paying damages. How could the Talmud infer from the word <i>ason</i>, as it was used to refer to a possible disaster befalling Benjamin, that one deserving of “dying by the hand of Heaven” is exempt from payment? One could argue that [according to Tosafos’s definitions of <i>kares</i> and “dying by the hand of Heaven”], one is exempt from payment only if one is younger than fifty – i.e., <i>kares</i>, since Benjamin [at the time of that incident] was much younger than fifty. Therefore, one is compelled to conclude, as Rashi says, that <i>kares</i> [according to the Babylonian Talmud] means that a person and his children are liable to suffer a premature death by the hand of Heaven. Since Benjamin at the time of that incident already had children, [and Jacob was only concerned for the <i>ason</i> of Benjamin himself], the Talmud can derive from <i>ason</i> that it is referring to one liable to suffer a premature death [and not <i>kares</i>]. That is how Rashi inferred [in <i>Kesubos</i>] that <i>kares</i> means that both he and his children are punished.<br><b>Translator’s summary:</b> Using several examples of enumerations of laws provided by the “masters of collections,” the Netziv illustrates how, using careful analysis of their words, one can derive new laws and obtain insights into the interpretation of the Talmud. By citing the example of the fifteen women who can exempt their co-wives and the co-wives of the co-wives from yibbum and halitzah, the Netziv demonstrates that the words of the “masters of collections” can create a domino effect permitting a succession of insights into several areas of Halacha. For by analyzing the enumeration and the types of women who are listed in the Mishnah or Toras Kohanim, combined with the understanding whether certain prohibitions are to be derived from Scripture or logic, one not only concludes which women are to be included or excluded from such a categorization; one infers whether or not the different types of ervah, forbidden relationships, can be derived from one another, which in turn influences how one is to define kares and ariri. The Netziv demonstrates this by illustrating how the Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmuds have two different versions of the Toras Kohanim, and what appears to be a subtle variation, actually results in significant halachic differences.<br>According to the Jerusalem Talmud, the version of the Toras Kohanim is that the co-wives of the co-wives are exempt from yibbum and halitzah based on the Scriptural derivation of litzror. The need for this Scriptural derivation teaches us that the Toras Kohanim believes that the various types of ervah cannot be derived from one another, which thus precludes the use of the logical argument of Rav Ashi. It is therefore also clear that since various forbidden women cannot be derived from one another, one cannot derive the case of the woman with the conditional divorce from other ervah. For in the case of a conditional divorce the ex-husband can rescind his condition, and there is no verse that exempts the co-wives of the woman with the conditional divorce. Since the conditional divorce is not included in the listing of those women who exempt the co-wives and the co-wives of the co-wives, and there is a need to complete the list of fifteen, it therefore must include the wife of the maternal half-brother. If the Toras Kohanim is read to include the wife of the maternal half-brother, the question then arises as to how that inclusion is valid if the Toras Kohanim excludes such a woman from kares. Therefore, one is forced to conclude that the Jerusalem Talmud believes that there are two forms of excision, one of which is premature death inflicted on the transgressor and his children, and another type of excision, which affects only the actual transgressor.<br>However, according to the Babylonian Talmud, the text of the Toras Kohanim does not derive the co-wives of the co-wives from the word litzror. We thus infer that according to the Toras Kohanim, the various types of forbidden relationships may be derived from one another even when the forbidden nature of the relationship may be obviated either through divorce or by rescinding a condition. Therefore, the Babylonian Talmud understands the Toras Kohanim to include in the list of the fifteen women the woman who was divorced with the condition that prohibits her marriage to a certain man. If one were to include the wife of the maternal half-brother, the number would be increased to sixteen. Therefore, the Babylonian Talmud concludes that the Toras Kohanim excludes the wife of the maternal half-brother. Since the wife of the maternal half-brother does not exempt the co-wives from yibbum and halitzah, it would logically explain why such a woman would be excluded from the punishment of kares. Therefore, according to the Babylonian Talmud, there is no need to delineate two levels of kares.",
                    "Returning to the matter we were discussing, we see from the enumeration of the fifteen types of women that such categorizations function as goads to teach us novel concepts and secret matters. Similarly, one gleans [insights] from the sayings of the “masters of collections,” who have gathered [laws] from all of the scattered statements regarding a particular area and put them into one collection. [By careful analysis of the manner in which these laws have been collected], we obtain an understanding of the intent of the original Talmudic statements that have been collected.",
                    "[For another example], see [my commentary, <i>Ha’amek She’elah</i>] 134:4, in which we derived insights from the words of our master [the She’iltos] pertaining to the prohibition of filling one’s mouth with laughter. [We asked why the She’iltos] included this prohibition in the section pertaining to the laws of <i>Tisha be-Av</i>.<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud <i>Berachos</i> 31a states, “R. Yohanan says in the name of R. Shimeon ben Yohai, ‘One may not fill one’s mouth with laughter in this world.” One may interpret this statement to refer to this world as opposed to the World to Come. However, since the She’iltos groups this statement together with the laws of Tisha be-Av, one infers that the phrase “this world” refers to this world in the absence of the Holy Temple, and that one may not fill his mouth with laughter because we mourn the destruction of the Temple.</i> Further, see the way we inferred so much in 57:4,<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tractate <i>Bava Basra</i> 60b states: “We must not decorate our rooms with plaster, panels and paintings in these days. However, if one purchased a courtyard that had walls that were plastered, paneled and painted, it may be retained in its current state.” Most authorities explain this gemara as a reminder not to plaster or paint one’s house so that we will more readily recall the destruction of the Temple. However, the She’iltos records this statement together with the prohibition against making images of heavenly objects and angels. He states that “… We are not concerned that to remove suspicion of [having made forbidden images, one should remove those that have already been made]. This is stated in the <i>baraisa</i>, ‘One who [had already] purchased a courtyard that had walls which were plastered, paneled and painted, may retain them in their current state.’” Therefore, according to the She’iltos, this prohibition of plastering, paneling and painting one’s home is not to remember the destruction of the Temple, but rather alludes to the prohibition of making something that may be construed as constructing forbidden images. The She’iltos’ version of <i>Bava Basra</i> 31a did not include the words “in these days.” In addition, many question why the Rif did not include the prohibition of painting or plastering one’s house in order to remember the destruction of the Temple. However, we see the Rif agrees with the She’iltos that this relates to the prohibition against making forbidden images.</i> as in many other places, by analyzing the manner in which [the She’iltos] categorized collections of laws. Similarly, we obtained further insights by analyzing the words of the Bahag, [as demonstrated] by what is written in [<i>Ha’amek She’elah</i>] 53:4,<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There the Netziv writes that according to the Bahag, we can infer that the reading of the <i>shema</i> is required by the Torah, since he includes it in the 613 mitzvos. That is, the inference that one is required to recite the evening and morning shema from the words <i>be-shochbecha u-ve-kumecha</i> is not an <i>asmachta</i> but a Torah law.</i> pertaining to the laws of the reading of the <i>shema.</i> In addition, see how this method was applied to Rav Yitzchak Alfasi based on what we wrote in [<i>Ha’amek She’elah</i>] 27:6<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There the She’iltos discusses whether one may take the law into his own hands, such as wounding someone in order to prevent him from sinning, or removing by force money that was wrongly taken. The She’iltos concludes that it is permitted only if there are two witnesses. Similarly, a court bailiff who is slighted by any of the litigants may report their behavior to the court, and this shall not be considered <i>lashon ha-ra</i> (evil speech about another). In addition, he has the right to beat the litigants if necessary, and is exempt from damages if he causes them physical harm. The Netziv writes that the Rif is of the opinion that the bailiff has the capacity to perform these acts, since his trustworthiness is equal to the testimony of two witnesses. Although the Rif does not state this explicitly, it is inferred from the manner in which, in the third chapter of <i>Mo’ed Katan</i>, he groups a Gemara from <i>Mo’ed Katan</i> together with a citation from <i>Bava Kamma</i>. He first cites from <i>Mo’ed Katan</i> 16a that a court bailiff may bring a negative report of a person’s behavior to the court, and then follows this by citing from <i>Bava Kamma</i> 112b that a court bailiff’s word carries the same weight as the testimony of two witnesses, and he is allowed to harm the litigants physically as he deems necessary.</i> and 20:13,<sup>20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There the Netziv extensively discusses the scope of liability of one <i>shomer</i> (watchman) who entrusts another <i>shomer</i> with an object or animal to watch without obtaining the owner’s permission. His view of the Rif’s opinion in part relates to his analysis of why the Rif juxtaposes a statement of Rav from <i>Bava Metzia</i> 112a, with another statement of Rav’s from <i>Bava Metzia</i> 97b.</i> and as in many other places. When Koheles stated, “as goads are the masters of collections,” it was [in reference to this method of inferring laws from categorizations]. This means that [the way the collected laws are categorized and expressed, enables one to obtain insights about the law, even though] these interpretations were not explicitly stated by the “masters of collections.”<sup>21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv is explaining why the verse does not say “The <i>words </i>of the masters of collections,” as it said “the words of the sages.”</i> These categorizations function as a “goad” to bring life to those who learn them."

                    "<b><small>HOW TO DERIVE TORAH PRECEPTS BY ANALYZING THE WORDS OF THE “MASTERS OF COLLECTIONS”</small></b><br>THERE IS ANOTHER method by which to learn [law, i.e.] from the manner in which [the “masters of collections”] gather [categorize], the laws. To those who read their works, at first glance it appears as if they are merely categorizing laws rather than conveying any novel ideas. However, if you read their words meticulously, you will find that a particular word comes [to convey a concept], that alludes to the logic of the “master of collection” and the direction he wishes to take. [However], since the [main purpose] of the categorizers of law was not to afford insights, but merely to arrange [laws] by topic in accordance with one’s understanding [of those topics], they wrote their words tersely so they would be easier to memorize, for that was the main purpose of his producing that compilation. Nevertheless, if we attempt to analyze their writings meticulously, word by word, we will be able to elicit the depth of their intent. It is in this manner that the “words of the wise” differ [in style] from the “masters of collections.” The purpose of the “words of the wise” was to resolve [conflicts] and to communicate their understanding of a particular [concept]. Therefore, [the “wise”] had to elaborate so that they could achieve that purpose. That is unlike the language of the “masters of collections,” because their main objective was to gather and assemble materials scattered [throughout the Talmud] so as to reduce the extent to which one was required to memorize the vast range of subjects. [Therefore], since they needed to keep their words to a minimum, it behooves us to deeply analyze [what they wrote], word by word.",
                    "Pertaining to this, you will see in a particular section of the Talmud, that often the <i>Halachos Gedolos</i><sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Bahag.</i> and the Rif elaborate at length; however, in most cases they write tersely. [The reason they elaborate in certain instances] is that when they saw that certain sections were being misinterpreted, they felt the need to clarify those areas well. However, [that method was only applied in few instances], and the main purpose of their compilations was to gather and assemble much information, with a minimum of words, systematically; that is why they categorized their insights [on particular] topics with a minimum number of words. This explains why Koheles compared the [“masters of collections”] to implanted nails.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv compares cuttings to implanted nails or pegs. A popular method of growing vines and fruit trees is to take cuttings from the tree branches or from the vine shoots and plant them. These cuttings appear like pegs that have been implanted in the ground.</i> The intention of one who plants a cutting from a fruit tree is that it will bear fruit and for its roots and branches to spread, thereby enabling him to produce a harvest from this cutting. [To ensure this result,] he plants the cutting in the most effective manner. In contrast, the intention of one who hammers nails is only that the nails be properly arranged and remain in place and not become dislodged. Both aspects apply to the “masters of collections.” They are like the one who hammers nails, because their main intention is that [their writings] should be well organized to facilitate memorization; however, they are unlike nails and more like the person who plants cuttings, because they wish some of their writings to bear fruit [as novel insights] in Halachah.",
                    "After all that Koheles described regarding the two types of scholars that exist in every generation, he concluded with the words, “… coming from one Shepherd.”<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Eccl. 12:11.</i> [This was written to indicate] why you must regard the words of both types of scholars as precious. Their two types of strengths emanate from the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is written in Tractate <i>Megillah</i> 6b<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The text erroneously cites <i>Megillah</i> 4.</i>: “One needs Divine assistance to retain what he has learned.”<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv explains this Talmudic statement to include the assurance that the laws are not forgotten from Israel.</i>",
                    "Thus one should not say that the “masters of collections” lack wisdom and that their [compilations are merely the result] of organizing the laws according to the [needs of the] time, or [that they merely reflect their interest in a] particular subject, and hence one should not be so concerned to analyze and consider their words carefully. On the contrary, this view is not correct, since they also have a strength [that emanates] from God, the Shepherd of Israel, May He be blessed, the Keeper of the Covenant, to assure that [the Divine words] should not be forgotten. He gives each individual strength according to his approach: This one explains, this one compiles; this one analyzes while another speaks; yet another, with the assistance of God’s hand, succeeds in accumulating much grain.<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv writes in <i>Harhev Davar</i> on Deut. 32:3 that grain is a metaphor for the Talmud, as stated in <i>Bereshis Rabbah</i> on the Torah portion of <i>Toledos</i>.</i> This is why Solomon was particular in describing God as a Shepherd, as all these different approaches are only applicable to the revealed portion of the Torah that He has given us to practice [thus enabling us] to follow His words, may He be blessed. However, this is not so with the hidden portions of the Torah, and as I wrote previously,<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See chapter 7 in this section.</i> Koheles alluded to this portion of the Torah as words of truth, <i>divrei emes</i>, to demonstrate that there is only one path, i.e., <i>emes</i>, an absolute truth. If one does not concentrate on the proper understanding of [this] truth, and believes that he has grasped the proper combinations of God’s holy names, while in reality it is not so, [he has devoted time] to trivial matters, and his words do not glow with the light of Torah at all. It is because of this that [Solomon] said, “coming from one Shepherd,” to illustrate that He leads and guides Israel in the path it travels.<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This has reference to the “revealed” Torah which provides halachic direction to the Jewish nation.</i> [The sages] explained [this verse] in Tractate <i>Hagigah</i><sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">3b.</i> and in <i>Avos de-Rabbi Nasan, </i>Chapter 18,<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There it states, “‘The words of the sages are like goads, and like implanted nails are the words of the masters of collections.’ Just as a goad directs an animal to its furrow [so that it may plow the fields], so do the words of Torah guide man towards the paths of life. Since a goad can be displaced, [you may think] that the words of Torah can be displaced. Therefore [Scripture says], ‘They are like nails.’ [You may think] that just as a nail removes [pieces of a structure] and does not add to a structure, the Torah [functions in a similar way]. [Scripture therefore says] ‘implanted.’ Just as a plant is fruitful and multiplies, so does the Torah bear fruit and increase. Just as that which is implanted cannot be uprooted, so the words of Torah cannot be uprooted. [When the verse states] ‘masters of collections,’ it refers to Talmudic scholars who enter [the academies] and sit in collections of groups. Some groups rule that a particular thing is forbidden, while another group rules that it is permitted; some of these groups may rule that a particular item is ritually impure, while others rule that it is pure; this group rules that a particular thing is invalid, while others rule that it is valid. Perhaps because of these [varied opinions], one may question how he can properly study the Torah. For this reason, Scripture states that they ‘come from one Shepherd.’ [This teaches] that One created them and One provided them; the Master of Creation has stated [all of] these [various opinions]. Therefore, make your ear like a hopper to receive the words of those who forbid, the words of those who permit, the words of those who rule something ritually impure and those who rule that it is pure, the words of those who invalidate and those who validate.”</i> as well as in many other Talmudic sources: Though these [scholars] rule that something is spiritually unclean, and other [scholars] rule that it is spiritually clean; though these [scholars] rule that something is forbidden, while other [scholars] rule that it is permitted, all [of their opinions] are the words of the Living God.",
                    "Behold how the sages of the Talmud made a great effort to analyze the language of the “masters of collections,” that is, the sages of the Mishnah, and [how this effort] produced many laws. [This method] is described in the common phrase found in the Gemara: “The wording of our mishnah can be used to prove [this point].”<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For an example see Tractate <i>Pesachim</i> 99a and Tractate <i>Shabbos</i> 154b.</i> This means that they derived a new law, even though it was not stated explicitly and it only became known by analyzing their words. For the perception of the Sages of the Gemara was strong and so powerful that it enabled them to determine decisively the intent of the sages of the Mishnah. This [methodology] continued after the completion of the Talmud, as our masters the She’iltos, the Bahag, and the Rif were “masters of collections,” who were followed by the Rambam, the Ramban, and the like, whose perceptions were also great, and whose steadfastness provided them with success. The words of the Geonim encircled the <i>halachic</i> decision makers of the Rishonim, as the Spirit [directed] the <i>Ofanim</i>.<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Taken from the <i>Ma’aseh ha-Merkavah</i> (the Work of the Chariot) described in Ezek. 1:18. The word <i>ofanim </i>in this context means “celestial wheels” or a type of angel. The Netziv is using this as a metaphor to describe how the Rishonim could understand the intention of the Geonim and where their words were heading, similar to the way the <i>ofanim</i> follow the four <i>hayyos</i> (creatures) of the Chariot. As it states, “As the <i>hayyos</i> move, the <i>ofanim</i> move beside them…. When they moved, they moved; and when they halted they halted… for the spirit of the <i>hayyah</i> was in the <i>ofanim</i>.”</i> [However], after the passage of many years, the manner of inferring [insights] from the words [of the “Masters of Collections”] was forgotten by the later generations, except by chance, and in a few places that are out of the ordinary. When we now attempt to analyze their words, so that we understand the direction in which they were going, we realize that our perception is weak and that we are threading through their words in darkness. In addition, [even] when we perceive that their words do not appear very exact, we lack the strength to understand their intent.",
                    "Therefore, when we wish to sharpen our perception, we need to place [the] three books [of the She’iltos, Bahag, and Rif] side by side. It will then become apparent to all who review their words, that, [for instance], two [of the three] are similar in their language on many subjects. However, they differ in the order that these topics are organized, as I wrote about the Rif in [<i>Pesah Ha’amek</i>], 1:4. It then becomes simple to discern any differences among them, even for the one who is dull of perception such as myself.",
                    "This is comparable to what the Rosh wrote in Tractate <i>Niddah</i>, in the chapter entitled <i>Tinokos</i>,<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is the title of the tenth chapter of Tractate <i>Niddah</i>.</i> section 3, regarding how to determine if a woman who had bled was in fact menstruating. Even though one may not be an expert in all the different types of menstrual blood, nevertheless, if one compares two types of blood [side by side], one can tell whether they are similar or different in appearance.",
                    "However, in order to understand the opinions [of the “masters of collections”] of blessed memory and the reason for their differences, it behooves us to analyze deeply and to compare the various opinions of the <i>Rishonim</i> who differ in relation to a particular subject. [By doing this], one can [more] easily infer from their choice of words which opinion a “master of collection” follows.",
                    "In order to illustrate the difference between our capability of understanding the intent of the Geonim today, and how the words of the Geonim were understood at the time of the Rishonim, I would like to provide the following parable: One who has summer fruit and would like to store it for the winter. If he stores the fruit in its current state in his [storage] room, it will spoil and rot. So what does he do? He dries them until they become hard, wrinkled, and small in volume. When the time arrives to eat them in the winter, if his teeth are in good condition, he can chew the dried fruits as they are and taste their flavor. However, if his teeth are in bad condition and he cannot taste their flavor since he can only chew them with his tongue, what does he do? He brings a pot, water, wood and fire, and cooks [the fruit] for a long time, after which he can extract the flavor that was hidden within them.",
                    "So it was with the early generations<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The term “Rishonim” here means the earlier generations.</i> – they plowed, sowed, harvested and produced fruit. If they attempted to communicate what was in their spirit, [all of their knowledge], they would have perished due to the time and effort [required for the task]. Therefore, the “masters of collections” were required to produce an abridged form of the six Orders of the Talmud, so that the laws would not become lost due to the extent of the text. What did they do? They wrote in an extremely terse manner, yet [they were able] to incorporate many matters in few words. For [the “masters of collections” intended to communicate much even though they] “have no speech or words,”<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This phrase is from Psalms 19:4, where it states that although the heavens do not utter any words, their message is discerned by human beings. The Netziv is also explaining why “words” is not written with the “masters of collections” as it was with the “wise” in Eccl. 12:11.</i> and though statements may be lacking [in their texts]. The following generations that [wished] to consume and benefit greatly from their knowledge, of blessed memory, varied according to their capabilities. The Rambam (and his equals), whose intellect was great, did not need to toil greatly to derive inferences from the nuances of the words of our sages; he would just apply his mind to the vast sea of knowledge and could thus decisively derive their opinion. Similarly, Rabbenu Tam, as I stated in Part One of <i>Kadmas Ha’amek</i>, chapter 15, derived a law<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbenu Tam derived a law that permits identifying a corpse more than three days after death.</i> and a fundamental <i>halachic</i> principle<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbenu Tam derived from the Bahag that using a sign for identification in various halachic matters is of rabbinic origin.</i> from a nuance in the language of the Bahag.",
                    "However, we are like ignorant children<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Kesuvos</i> 17b and <i>Hullin</i> 111b, in which the Hebrew word <i>yasom</i> is used as a gentle rebuke, as when calling someone an ignorant child. The literal meaning of the word <i>yasom</i> is “orphan.”</i> who possess no intellect, nor do we have the mouth [with good teeth] that is the means to consume and benefit from the nuances in the language [of the words of the sages]. Therefore, we need to delve deeply into the explanations that Rashi, Tosafos and their like among the <i>Rishonim</i> provided, and use these commentaries when applying pilpul to the various areas of the Talmud. With this perception, we can easily come to understand the approach of our Master [the She’iltos], as well as the positions of the Bahag and the Rif [in understanding the Talmud]. In this way, the opinion of our Master [the She’iltos] functions as a support, making known the distinctive features of an opinion based on the well-known traditions received by the Gaon, Rav Ahai, of blessed memory."

In <i>Harhev Davar</i> on Gen. 2:7, he explains that the word <i>hayyah</i>, life, refers to one achieving a complete form of living: the moment of true living comes when one is deeply involved in the study and analysis of the Torah. This concept of life is found in the Jerusalem Talmud in <i>Pe’ah,</i> as cited by the Netziv in Part 2, chapter 2, “Your life is when you toil in the study of Torah.” The Torah becomes your life when you engage in its study. In addition, the spiritual experience gained from Torah study is truly living. When the soul connects with the Creator, there is a happiness and satisfaction that cannot be matched by any physical pleasure.</i> may God bless them, [the Scholars of the current generations of Israel to properly study and understand the words of the “masters of collections”]. Everyone emphasizes the greatness of the She’iltos and the Bahag, and [it is known what] the <i>Rishonim</i> wrote pertaining to them, that all their words are words of holiness, and [everyone underscores] the holiness of the Rif, as [the Rishonim] wrote regarding the Rif’s book that it was compiled with Divine inspiration, and everyone knows that this awesome result came because the Rishonim knew how to analyze their words meticulously. They saw light within darkness, [insights within obscurity, derived] from the most subtle nuances. [Even though this is known by all], today’s generations have not gained a proper understanding of the opinions of the giants of the “masters of collections,” the pillars of Jewish Law. For [today’s scholars] have not habitually analyzed their words, even those of the Rif, whose words are before the eyes of all who study his commentaries and those of his armor-bearers, of blessed memory.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv is lamenting that even though many people, such as the Ran and Nimukei Yosef, study the commentaries of the Rif, and many people study the Ramban’s <i>Milhamos ha-Shem</i>, which he wrote in order to defend the Rif against the Ba’al ha-Ma’or, some fail to analyze the words of the Rif properly.</i> It then goes without saying that they are not paying sufficient attention to the books of the She’iltos and of the Bahag, unless [they are reading] what the Rishonim have already inferred from their terse words.",
                    "Because [many do not read the words of the “masters of collections” in the actual source], it follows that [those who study] my book, which cites [various] opinions in the name of our “masters of collections” of blessed memory, will find it difficult to understand and analyze these opinions. Obviously, it will be even more difficult for one to build foundations [in Halachah], and to use pilpul in [the analysis of] their opinions, than those who analyze the great matters from the source. Every person’s insight is [proportional] to the greatness [of the source], even when understanding [the Geonic] opinions through the expressions of the Rishonim.",
                    "Therefore, I feel that I must quote from the inferences of the masters of the <i>Midrash</i> on the verse, [“The words of the wise are like goads,” etc.], which we cited at the beginning, and to explain it as God has beneficently granted to an unworthy person, such as myself [to understand]. The <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> says on the portion of <i>Naso</i> 14:",
                    "[On the verse], “The words of the wise are like goads,” it has been taught: Whence is it known that if a person hears a [Torah] matter from the mouth of a less significant [scholar] in Israel,<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He is considered inferior compared with the scholars of previous generations.</i> he should consider it as if he heard it from a [great] sage in Israel? [From what] Scripture states, “If you listen to My commandments that I command you today…”<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 11:13: “‘It shall be that if you listen to My commandments that I command you today – to love the Lord your God and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul….”</i> (<i>Netziv’s note</i> – “If you listen to My commandments from whomever it may be, i.e., from whomever I direct to teach you [the law], since he is worthy of this task as a sage of his generation, even though you did not hear this [matter] directly from [a great sage]”). Not [only is it] as if you heard this matter from a sage, but as if you had heard it from [a group] of sages, as Scripture states, “The words of the wise are like goads.” Just as a goad directs an ox to plow so that it may bring life to the world, so does the Torah direct a person’s intellect to God. Not only is it as if he heard this matter from the sages, but it is as if he heard it from the Sanhedrin, as Scripture states, “like masters of collections,” [and “collections”] refer to the Sanhedrin, as Scripture states, “Collect for Me seventy men from among the elders.”<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Num.11:16.</i> Not only is it as if he heard this matter from the Sanhedrin, but it is as if he heard it from the mouth of Moses, as Scripture states, “from a shepherd.” [Moses was a shepherd]: Scripture states, “They remembered the ancient days, [when] He sent Moses to His nation, how He drew them from the sea with their shepherd.”‘<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isa. 63:11.</i> Scripture also states, “Moses was a shepherd.”<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ex. 3:1.</i> Not only was it as if he heard this matter from Moses, but it is as if he heard it from the Holy One blessed be He, as Scripture states, “from one Shepherd.” The Holy One blessed be He, is called a Shepherd, as Scripture states, “Hear, O Shepherd of Israel…’<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 80:2.</i> [<i>One </i>Shepherd refers to God] as God is One.’<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 6:4.</i>",
                    "This is the language of the <i>Midrash,</i> to which I have added a few emendations. This [Midrashic statement], with a few variations, is also cited in the <i>Sifrei</i>, on the Torah portion <i>Ekev</i>.",
                    "At first glance the statements of this <i>Midrash</i> are difficult to understand. Why is Koheles so verbose in communicating the message [that one who heard a law from an inferior scholar of Israel] is as if he reaches the top [i.e., as if he heard it from God]? [Why is this not expressed] in one large leap without the gradations in reaching this goal? Why not simply state that if we learn [a law] from an inferior [scholar] of Israel, we should regard it as if we had heard [the law] from the Holy One, blessed be He? What is the significance of each of these stages?",
                    "In reality, it is difficult [to comprehend even why one should treat a statement from a lesser sage as if from a greater Sage]; it should be just the opposite. How is it possible to compare what one hears from a lesser [scholar] to [what one hears] from a great sage? For it is taught in the <i>Sifrei</i> in the beginning of <i>Devarim</i>,<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Piska</i> 14. The verse states, “You answered me and said, ‘What you propose to do is good.’”</i> as cited by Rashi with his explanation:<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Harhev Davar</i> to Deut. 1:14, where the Netziv explains Rashi’s understanding of the <i>Sifrei </i>in this way: “V<i>a-ta’anu osi va-tomeru</i>,” “You answered me and said,” could have been written more tersely as <i>va-ta’anu</i>, and “you answered,” or <i>va-tomeru elai</i>, “you said to me.” Therefore, Scripture is implying that there is an additional way of reading these words, such as “<i>va-ta’anu osi</i>” – “you pained me” or “you pressed me” – to hurry and appoint judges. In other words, the people wanted to rid themselves of Moses as their judge.</i> [After Israel answered Moses],<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibid. 1:12: “Provide yourselves with men who are wise and understanding and renowned in your tribes.”</i> “[It is a] good thing that you said to [appoint judges],” Moses said, “You should have replied instead, ‘Our master Moses, from whom is it more fitting to learn, from you or from your disciple? Would it not be better [to learn] from you, [Moses], who suffered for it?’” As [this <i>Sifrei</i>] demonstrates, the power of [knowledge from one who is inferior and from one who is a great sage] are not the same.",
                    "[To answer this question], we need first to understand what is truly different in the power of understanding when hearing a statement from one who is great [in Torah], than from [hearing the same statement] from one who is inferior [in Torah knowledge]. Do they not both state the same thing? However, it appears that the difference is in two different areas. One is denoted in the <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> on Exodus, on the Torah portion <i>Ki Sissa</i><sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Parashah 41.</i>: [Pertaining to the verse], “He [God] gave to Moses, <i>ke-challoso</i>,<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This means complete.</i> when he finished speaking with him,”<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ex. 31:18.</i> [meaning that during the forty days that Moses was on Mount Sinai, he was taught the entire Torah. One can ask], “Did Moses really learn the entire Torah? Is it not written in Scripture [pertaining to the Torah], ‘Its measure is longer than the earth and broader than the sea,’ and yet Moses was able to learn it in forty days?” [Rather], God taught Moses the principles of the Torah; [this is the meaning of the word], <i>ke-challoso</i>, [as <i>kaloso</i> is similar to <i>kelal</i>, a principle].",
                    "We see from [this Midrash] that Moses’s strength in learning directly from the Holy One, blessed be He, was like an inexhaustible fountain that overflowed greatly and with much force so that with the basic principles that God unearthed for him, [Moses] was able to produce by himself all the minutiae of the Torah. This would not be so with one who did not learn Torah directly from the Holy One, blessed be He, as such a person would not acquire the power [to make such inferences]. From this we understand that depending [on one’s scholarship], there is a difference in the [effect of the same] teaching, depending on from whom it emanates. For one who hears from a lesser sage, who only possesses a replica of the original teaching, is unlike one who receives this teaching from a sage who through the power of his learning can delve and produce additional streams of the water [of Torah]. This is explicitly written in Tractate <i>Eruvin</i> 54b. And if he learned this matter directly from the Sanhedrin, his strength would be even greater, and if he learned the same matter from Moses, he would be able to produce Torah in an even more wondrous manner.",
                    "The second [way in which the understanding of the received Torah laws are affected when being taught by a great sage], is described in the Midrash Rabbah to Song of Songs,<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Parshah 1.</i> on the verse, “He kissed me with the kisses of His mouth.”<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Song of Songs 1:2.</i> There it states: R. Judah said, “When Israel heard the words, ‘I am the Lord your God,’ the knowledge of the Torah was fixed in their heart and they learned it and did not forget it. They came to Moses and said, ‘Our Master, Moses, intervene between us [and God], as it says, ‘Speak with us and we will hear…why should we die? What profit is there if we perish?’ They then became liable to forget what they had learned. They said, ‘Just as Moses, being flesh and blood, is ephemeral, so is his teaching ephemeral.’ Because of this they came to Moses a second time and said, ‘Our Master, Moses, perhaps God can be revealed to us a second time! If only He would kiss us ‘with the kisses of his lips! If only He would fix the knowledge of the Torah in our hearts as it was!’ He, [God], replied to them, ‘This cannot be now, but it will be in the days to come’, as it says, ‘I will put my law in their inner parts: in their heart will I write it’ (Jer. 31:33).”",
                    "Behold, we learn from this <i>midrash</i> that when one hears a Torah matter from the Holy One, blessed be He, [Who] lives and endures, this learning is everlasting. This is not so with one who does not learn directly from the Holy One, blessed be He; he does not achieve this power [of retention]. From this <i>midrash</i> we can understand that the degree of the power of retention [of a Torah matter] is proportional to the source of this material. The power of retention is different when one hears a Torah matter from a lesser [sage] of Israel as opposed to one who heard the same Torah matter from a sage, and so on with the gradations [listed in the <i>midrash</i>].",
                    "[With these insights] we can understand the<i> Midrash Rabbah</i> (ch. 2) to Song of Songs, commenting on the verse (2:14), “My dove is in the clefts of the rock.” The <i>Midrash</i> discusses how Moses was pained by Israel [wanting him as an intermediary rather than hearing the Torah directly from God]. [God allayed Moses’s concern, as Scripture states], “And God heard the sound of your words … and said…Everything that they said is excellent” (Deuteronomy 5:24). What is meant by, “Everything they said is excellent?” Hiyya bar Addah and Bar Kappara gave different explanations of [the Hebrew word, <i>hetivu</i>, which means excellent]. One compared it to the maintenance, <i>hatavas</i>, of the lamps,<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the Rambam, <i>hatavas ha-neros</i> refers to the maintenance of the lamps, which involves the changing of the wicks, adding oil and lighting them. See <i>Sanhedrin</i> 82b where Tosafos defines this activity as the cleaning of the lamps.</i> and the other to the preparation, <i>hatavas</i>, of the incense.",
                    "Although this midrashic statement is difficult to understand, it can be grasped [by combining] what we said above with a <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> on <i>Koheles</i>,<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Parashah 3.</i> pertaining to the verse, “I have observed the task which God has given man for affliction.”<sup>20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Eccl. 3:10.</i> As the <i>Midrash</i> states, This is the ephemeral nature of Torah study ─ one learns the Torah and forgets it. The rabbis of Babylonia said in the name of R. Yitzhak of Israel and R. Tuviah said in the name of R. Yitzhak, “It is to man’s benefit that he studies Torah and forgets it. For if a person were to study Torah and not forget it, he would study the Torah diligently for two or three years, and then return to his work and not pay attention to the Torah for the rest of his life. It is only because when a man studies Torah that he forgets it, that he does not depart or separate himself from the words of Torah.”",
                    "It is now understood [why the <i>Midrash</i> in Song of Songs states] that God did not want to teach the Torah a second time directly to the nation of Israel, so that [the Israelites] would not forget it. [God wanted Israel to have lapses in memory so] they would [need to] study the Torah diligently. However, in the future days [of the Messiah], when the evil inclination is uprooted [from the nation of Israel], and [Jews] will be studying the Torah <i>li-shemah</i>, for the sake of Heaven, they will have these two benefits: that is, as taught in the Chapter of Acquisition of the Torah,<sup>21</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Avos</i> 6:2 (according to some versions it is the first <i>Mishnah</i>). This chapter of <i>Avos</i> is known as “The Chapter of Acquisition of the Torah,” as it speaks of the value of the Torah and its spiritual effect on human beings.</i> that whoever studies the Torah for the sake of Heaven becomes an overflowing spring and a river that never ceases [to flow]. [I will now explain] these two [metaphors]. [The first metaphor about an overflowing spring, indicates] how one’s mind penetrates deeply and can infer additional laws, [over and above] the law he has been taught. [The other metaphor] describes how the strength of one’s memory will continue forever, as a river that never ceases [to flow]. However, this is not true in these times, as we do not study the Torah for the sake of Heaven, and because of this we are required to toil greatly in the study of the Torah, and the more one toils, the more he discovers. This is stated in Tractate <i>Eruvin</i> 54b, “Why are the words of Torah compared to a breast? Just as with a breast – every time a baby handles it, he finds milk in it – so it is with the words of Torah: every time a person meditates on them, he finds [additional] flavor in them.”",
                    "These are along the same lines we described above, regarding [what the <i>Midrash</i> on Song of Songs stated pertaining to the verse], “Everything they said is excellent.” These words imply that the Holy One, blessed be He, saw goodness in the words and request [of Israel]; this was contrary to the view of Moses, who felt grief [at their request]. [The commentaries] ask why the response of the Holy One Blessed Be He was “Everything they said is excellent,” for what goodness is there in their request? Therefore, Hiyya bar Adda states that [God] replied that the response of the Children of Israel was as fine as the maintenance, <i>hatavas</i>, of the lamps [of the Menorah]. The meaning is that the lamps of the Menorah have to be maintained constantly, as the wicks are continually being consumed, and they thus require a person to maintain them by constantly adding more oil. This would not be the case if the lights were constantly burning; they would not be attended to at all. So said the Holy One, blessed be He, that it was excellent when they said that they did not want to hear the Torah directly from Me, for through this [method of learning], their power of memory will be like an obstructed river and an extinguished flame, thereby requiring them to concentrate on, enhance and review the teachings.",
                    "But, according to Bar Kappara [God replied that their words were excellent], as they are as the <i>hatavas</i>, the preparation of the incense. This is because, as is known, the nature of incense is that the more thoroughly it is ground the more fragrant and potent it becomes. It is because of this that the Mishnah states that [the incense] should be thoroughly ground.<sup>22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This halachah is stated in Tractate <i>Kerisos</i> 6a.</i> In fact, for Yom Kippur, it has to be most thoroughly ground to make its fragrance even more potent. Therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, replied that their request that they did not want to hear the Torah directly from Me, was excellent, for as a result they will not be able to understand the spoken word [of Torah] unless they thoroughly grind the Torah [to understand its essence]. This is similar to the metaphor of comparing the Torah to a breast, for just as the baby who handles the breast causes it to produce milk, so it is with the grinding of the Torah: by analysis it produces more taste, that is, an additional understanding of the Torah. Alternatively, one’s own crushing, i.e., the toil in itself [arouses the Divine assistance of obtaining insights]. This is stated in Tractate <i>Berachos</i> 63b, When the verse states, “<i>Haskes</i> and listen, O Israel;<sup>23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 27:9.</i> [it is saying:] grind yourselves down [i.e., toil] over the words of the Torah, in accordance with the words of Resh Lakish. Resh Lakish stated, “From where do we know that the words of the Torah are retained only by one who [metaphorically] kills himself over the Torah? From what Scripture states, ‘This is the Torah of a man who dies in a tent.’”<sup>24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Num. 19:14.</i> As can be seen from the other sources that I cited above, [when a man toils in the study of Torah he is given Divine assistance to obtain insights].",
                    "With the above interpretations we have now reconciled the various midrashic statements so that they do not contradict one another. Certainly Moses [was right to be upset] and to reply [to the people of Israel] that what they would hear from himself rather than from his disciples would be better in two ways: [it could help them] to retain and to comprehend a particular Torah statement. However, [God responded that their words were excellent] because regardless from whom the Torah teaching was received, one must toil over it and constantly review it.",
                    "This is what Koheles warned: that the teaching we receive from one who is inferior [in Israel] should be as beloved to us as a teaching that we have received from a sage. For if one toils over and reviews a saying [he will retain it and derive insights] just as if he had received that teaching from a great Sage. If he toils over it and reviews it even more, it will become as if he received the statement from a group of sages. If he further increases his diligence and analysis, it will be as if he received that teaching from the Sanhedrin, and so on.",
                    "Nevertheless, all of this is applicable only to teachings that one has received from a lesser teacher, who learned it from his teachers [who had a tradition to this effect], not from his colleagues who did not hear [this Torah statement] from their teachers. One has to accept that this Midrashic statement is referring to this when it states “One who <i>heard </i>this statement from one who is inferior [in Israel],” for if it were referring to what one originated by himself, it would not have stated that he was a lesser one of Israel. Rather, it is only referring to a lesser one of Israel who states a teaching [that he received from previous generations]. For this is applicable even to those who are inferior scholars of Israel, as it states in Tractate <i>Eduyyos</i><sup>25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chapter 1, <i>Mishnah</i> 3.</i> that two weavers from the Hill Gate [of Jerusalem] testified in the name of Shemaya and Avtalyon that three <i>log</i><sup>26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a liquid measure equal to the space occupied by six eggs.</i> of drawn water can invalidate a <i>mikveh</i> that is less than forty <i>se’ah</i>.<sup>27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Tosefta</i> asks, “Why does the <i>Mishnah</i> state their profession and their place [of residence]? Is any profession more degrading than weavers? Is any place lowlier than the Hill Gate [of Jerusalem]? [This teaches us] that just as [Hillel and Shammai], the most eminent ones in the world, did not persist in their opinions when confronted with tradition, so no one should persist in arguing their opinion when it runs against tradition.”</i>",
                    "Along these lines, see the <i>Midrash Rabbah</i>, Genesis section 97, where it states [pertaining to the verse], “May they proliferate abundantly like the fish within the land” (Gen. 48:16): Just as with fish raised in water, if water falls from above, they accept that water as thirstily as if they had never tasted water in their entire lives – so it is with Israel, who is raised on the water of Torah. If they hear a novel Torah law, they accept it with great thirst as if they had never heard a word of Torah in their lives.",
                    "[This <i>midrash</i>] is referring to a case in which one hears a clearly defined Torah law stated in the name of his rabbis. He who refuses to listen to any matter that he did not learn directly from the Talmud is [acting] foolishly and arrogantly, and is in a sorry state. This is not so with one who says, “So it appears in my eyes;” [when that has resulted] from deep analysis: each is according to his path in the toil of the Torah ─ this one derives the multitude of the Talmudic statements from the ambassadors,<sup>28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbis of the Talmud.</i> this one though pilpul and logic: behold, each man goes according to the path that seems right in his eyes. It is not surprising that each person’s opinion seems strange in the eyes of his colleague, for it takes much effort for an individual to align his opinion with that of each member of his group. This requires him to overcome his nature [and achieve] the love of truth and Torah, to the extent that he is so overcome by the trait of modesty and a pure spirit, that he loves the honor of his friend and graciously respects his opinion. Then fortunate is his lot, and it is befitting that the Divine Presence dwell upon him. However, [unfortunately], not everyone merits to achieve this level of purity.",
                    "However, this is not so with my book, <i>Ha’amek She’elah</i>, for God has given me the merit to analyze each word of the book, the <i>She’iltos</i> of Rav Ahai Gaon, meticulously. In many places I saw that his opinion is more obvious, while in others I unlocked the door to reach a deep understanding of his superior opinion, for during the days [of Rav Ahai Gaon] the living [Torah] was [more readily] elicited.",
                    "Behold, I say that the traditions of Rav Ahai Gaon are sublime, and I did not pause in my humble endeavor of producing fruit, to clarify the opinion of our Master [the <i>She’iltos</i>] with analysis of Torah and the use of pilpul, as the gracious hand of God bestows [understanding] upon the toiling soul. Perhaps the giants of the generation will realize the benefit [of my work] though it may be small and modest. [I request] that they refrain from flippantly contradicting my words, and that they first take the effort to carefully analyze the opinion of our Master, so that they may be able to understand it on their own, each according to the extent of his great ability.

A Spanish-born Jewish philosopher and translator, he initiated reconciliation between Jewish Orthodoxy and philosophy and defended Maimonides’s work <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i> (<i>The Guide of the Perplexed</i>) against the attacks of the traditionalists.</i> on Part 2, chapter 8 of the <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i> understands the Rambam’s opinion to be that one who is wise [even in secular matters] is superior to a prophet, for the prophet’s words may contain errors, Heaven forbid. He [the Shem Tov] rejoiced in this finding, saying, “It is more valuable than any precious vessel.”<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In that chapter of <i>Moreh Nevuchim,</i> the Rambam discusses Aristotle’s rejection of the ancient belief that the motions of the heavenly spheres – the planets, sun and stars – produced powerful sounds. The Rambam states: “This belief is also widespread in our nation… and in this astronomical question, our sages have abandoned their own theory [and agreed with the Greek scientists]….” According to the Shem Tov, when the Rambam states, “This belief is also widespread in our nation,” he is referring to the prophet Ezekiel, who stated, “When they went I heard the sound of their wings like the sound of the great waters, like the waters of the Almighty….” The Shem Tov is of the opinion that this verse in Ezekiel refers to the sound generated by the heavenly spheres.</i> Nevertheless, I say that he [the Shem Tov] delights in scoffing rather than finding that which is holy.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a play on words. <i>Keli hemdah </i>means “a precious vessel,” and <i>hemed </i>is the word for “delight.”</i> He found a peg to hang it on, [i.e., an authority upon which to base his opinion]. Heaven forbid [that this should be the proper understanding of that section in <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i>], for the Rambam did not intend to express this [idea], but was referring to something else [i.e., the sages].<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is difficult to interpret the Rambam’s words in <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i> as addressing the words of Ezekiel, for the Rambam clearly states “sages” with no reference to prophets. The Rambam is referring to <i>Yoma</i> 20b which states: “Were it not for the sound of the hordes of Rome, we would hear the sound of the sun rotating.” The sages believed that the motion of the sun produces sound.</i>]",
                    "[WE HAVE ALREADY explained in <i>Harhev Davar, Shofetim</i> [Deut. 18:18], what the Prophet Ezekiel stated in 2:10 [“He spread it before me, and it was written within and without, and there was written therein lamentations, moaning, and woe”].<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv explains Ezekiel 2:10 as follows: “He spread it before me….” Ezekiel realized that God had revealed what was already prophesied at Mount Sinai, and the meaning of the prophetic words was explained to him by the angel, “it was written <i>panim ve-ahor</i>, within and without” – in other words, from the beginning it was written both “within” verses that were to be understood as written, and “without,” with concepts hidden within the Torah, as it is composed of His Holy Names. [It seems that according to the Netziv, <i>ahor</i> should be translated literally as “back” rather than “without” – i.e., “mysterious.” The words “It was written therein: <i>kinnim</i>, lamentations,” can also be translated as “compartments” or “separate sections,” meaning concepts that, although they were written within the verses, do not relate to the context of that section. According to the Netziv in the introduction to his commentary on the Humash, many words in Scripture have dual meanings. Here, <i>kinnim</i> can also mean “separate sections” as well as “lamentations.” The plural of the word <i>kinnah</i> is given in the masculine form as <i>kinnim</i> rather than <i>kinnos</i>.] “… moaning and woe….” The Netziv refers this to laws of nature and science, those commonly mentioned publicly, as well as knowledge limited to a few individuals that cannot be expressed publicly. The words <i>ve-hehgeh va-hi</i>, “moaning and woe,” can also be translated as “spoken of and gasps of astonishment.”</i> This view was also expressed by the Ra’avad in his <i>Hassagos</i> [on the Rambam], towards the end of chapter 2, in the Laws of <i>Megillah.</i> There he stated that there is no book in Scripture that does not contain additional information [external] to the book’s main theme. It is thus understood that one should not compete with Scripture or believe that he can compose language that is equal in beauty. [Nonetheless], there are those who believe that their compositions are even more eloquent than Scripture. However, this is mere vanity, for these [compositions] lack the Living Spirit [embedded] within Scripture – that is, Divine inspiration. For throughout Scripture there are many hints regarding many matters – a feat that would be impossible to accomplish without Divine inspiration. This is similar to one who draws a picture of a man or some other living being. There are some whose [drawings] depict the human being as more beautiful than the thing itself. This does not imply that the one who draws a beautiful picture of a man is a greater artist than the Master of Nature. For since [the artist] is only creating a lifeless form [of a man], he can make a human look better [than the way he appears in real life]. This is not so with one who possesses a living spirit, [whose form] is a result of many factors in nature; he is created with defective and unpleasant [characteristics], [but the reason for many of these deficiencies is unknown] to us since they originate from the secrets of nature.",
                    "Similarly, since parables composed by human beings are comparable to lifeless forms, their wording can be refined so that they are more attractive. This is not so with Holy Scripture, since it contains the living spirit of Divine inspiration. Therefore, the hints and secrets [that Scripture desires to convey] constrain and make it impossible for them [the Prophets] to express [their words] in refined language, because they must also convey [the hints and secrets embedded in their words] which are their splendor and majesty.]"

                    "Similarly, pertaining to the phrase “Do not be excessively wise,” our sages of blessed memory in <i>Shemos Rabbah</i>, <i>parashah</i> 10, explained that this verse was written by King Solomon is in reference to himself, who [thought that he was] wiser than the Torah’s warning [against marrying too many wives].<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i> 21a, states that a king may not have more than eighteen wives. Solomon also transgressed the prohibition of going to Egypt by going there to buy more horses.</i> He had believed that since the Torah stated the rationale for this prohibition [as], “He may not have many wives, so that his heart will not stray,”<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 17:17.</i> and he was confident in himself that he would not reach such a level [of sinning], he therefore dared to transgress these negative commandments. [The <i>Midrash</i> continues]: “Solomon said: ‘For that which I thought I was wiser than the Torah’s laws, and where I thought I had understood the Torah’ wisdom, [I discovered] that [my] wisdom and understanding consisted of madness and foolishness. Why? ‘For what is man who will come after the King? It has already been done’ (Eccl. 2:12).” The <i>Midrash</i> is expressing that [Solomon was lamenting]: “I am unable to penetrate the deepest secrets embedded within the laws of the Torah, for [even when the Torah provides a rationale for a commandment], who knows how many other reasons there may be in addition to that [stated] rationale. Even where I knew the rationale, and I was convinced that there is no other reason for [that commandment], even [for this I learned] that it is foolish to nullify that warning, as it emanated from the “mouth” of the Holy One blessed be He. The Torah is built upon that <i>hok</i> [statute], and he who nullifies any statute, ruins the Torah’s entire structure.",
                    "Similar to how a person is built, with every limb being created with a special feature and purpose, even if the reason for needing a particular limb no longer exists, if one removes that limb from its place, one destroys the body and its composition, since it was created to be of a particular form consisting of every limb. So it is with the composition of the Torah, for the world has been built [through every] Torah [principle]; they are the fundamental laws of Heaven and Earth. This is stated in the <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> on the passage of <i>Be-hukosai</i>,<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Vayikra Rabbah, parashah 35.</i> “<i>Im</i> – If – you follow My statutes and keep My commandments,”<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lev. 26:3.</i> are the laws [used by God to create] Heaven and Earth. This understanding that “statutes” includes the fundamental laws of Heaven and Earth led our Sages in <i>Toras Kohanim,</i> as quoted in Tractate <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 5a, to interpret the <i>im</i> as a “prayer,” meaning that <i>im</i> used in this verse is a language of request rather than of condition. [The verse must then be translated as: “<i>im</i> – if you would only follow My statutes and keep My commandments”]. They interpreted <i>im</i> in this way because they understood “My statutes and commandments” to include the fundamental laws of heaven and earth that the Holy One, blessed be He, desired to exist perpetually. It was understood that He was asking Israel to guard the world and not destroy it by neglecting the study of Torah.<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This verse and concept is discussed in detail by the Netziv in <i>Ha’amek Davar,</i> Lev. 15:3.</i> Therefore, even if the purpose for a particular prohibition is absent, it is impossible to nullify it. This is so with any Torah precept that has a rationale; the details of the <i>mitzvah</i> are still to be treated as <i>hukim</i> [physical laws of nature through which the world exists]. For instance, as stated in the <i>Tosefta</i> cited in Tractate <i>Shabbos</i> 135b, [the <i>mitzvah</i> of] <i>pidyon ha-ben</i> [redeeming of the first-born son], must be [delayed] until after the thirtieth day [after the infant’s birth], since until that time we are in doubt as to whether the infant will survive. [Thus], even if the infant was born after a gestation period of nine complete months, the <i>pidyon ha-ben</i> must still be performed after thirty days and no sooner. Similarly, earthenware vessels [that have been used to cook non-kosher foods] cannot be made kosher through <i>hage’alah</i> [immersion in boiling water], for [the non-kosher] substance does not leave the walls [of the pot]. In fact, the Torah states that “it shall be broken,”<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lev. 7:21.</i> even if it is known that it was cooked in a manner in which the pot did not absorb [any non-kosher substance].<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The pot was suspended in an oven such that it did not touch any of the oven’s walls.</i> It cannot be made kosher for use, as it is a decree by the Torah as written by Tosafos in Tractate <i>Pesahim</i> 30b.<sup>20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Tosafos, s.v. <i>Ha-Torah he’idah</i>.</i> Similarly, a borrower who is liable for unavoidable losses because all the benefit is his,<sup>21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He has secured the right to use another’s property gratis.</i> nevertheless, even if he is borrowing an animal for which he is obligated to provide food,<sup>22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since he is providing the animal with food, it is as if he is paying the owner to use it.</i> [thus not receiving use of the animal for free], he is still liable for unavoidable losses. Many other examples could be cited.",
                    "[Thus, in all cases], although a fundamental principle has been established for a particular reason, once the Torah has decreed this principle as a rule, the details [of this rule] are like <i>hukim</i> [immutable laws]. [Therefore] one may not philosophize and nullify [the commandment even] if the [apparent] rationale [for that commandment] is not operative. This is how our sages of blessed memory explained the above-cited warnings [in <i>Koheles</i>].",
                    "Now that we have explained [that the verse “Do not be overly righteous or excessively wise” refers to how one is to practice a commandment even if the rationale for that commandment is inapplicable], we [now] need to explain the end of the verse, “Why become demented?” [The explanation is] that this refers to being punished [mentally]; King Saul who, after having been overly kind [to the Amalekites], was troubled with an evil spirit,<sup>23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See I Sam. 16:14: “An evil spirit from the Lord troubled him.”</i> and King Solomon who over-philosophized, expelled his knowledge and forgot it.<sup>24</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Midrash Rabbah</i> to Ex. 6:1.</i> This form of punishment lacks a scientific explanation, as it would be unnatural for one who attempts to make himself more righteous or wise, beyond [what is willed by] the Torah, to lose his sanity. However, [this penalty] is a metaphysical punishment decreed with the wisdom of the One who is to be blessed, similar to the way the punishment of <i>kares</i> [is exacted against those] who transgress the thirty-six prohibitions that are punishable by excision.<sup>25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The thirty-six prohibitions that carry the punishment of excision are enumerated at the beginning of Tractate <i>Kerisos</i>.</i> Therefore, when there are those who sin a hundred times and the Holy One, blessed be He, is patient with them,<sup>26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Eccl. 8:12.</i> though they are not excised in this world, they will receive a two-fold punishment in the World of Reckoning. Similarly, there are many who think that they are wiser than the Torah in this manner, and they are not punished in this world with madness. Their punishment is being saved for the World of Reckoning. Everything that [we have stated] regarding the explanation of these warnings is provided by the sages of blessed memory. [However, this explanation does not accord with the simple meaning of the verses.]"

                    "<b><small>CONFLICTING SCRIPTURAL AND TALMUDIC SOURCES REGARDING THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER ONE SHOULD STRIVE TO RISE ABOVE HIS INNATE INTELLECTUAL AND SPIRITUAL ABILITIES</small></b><br>HOWEVER, THE MAIN character of the Book of Koheles is the wisdom of Solomon, as it states in Tractate <i>Berachos</i> 57b, “Whoever sees the Book of Koheles [in a dream] may anticipate acquiring wisdom.” This goes without saying for the opinion in Tractate <i>Megillah</i> 7a, that Ecclesiastes was not written with the Divine Spirit – it is merely Solomon’s wisdom – this is so even according to the opinion that says Koheles was written with the Divine Spirit. For certain [Koheles] was not written with the same character of Divine Spirit as was Song of Songs and Proverbs were written; the latter originated from the Divine Spirit – not so with Koheles. Interspersed among Solomon’s vast wisdom [in Koheles] are the results of investigations by the philosophers and scholars of natural science of his time [but the Divine Spirit influenced what was to be recorded and how they were to be expressed]. Only certain portions of his knowledge were permitted to be recorded [in Koheles,] as proven [in <i>Megillah</i> 7a] from the verse, “Do not add to its words.”<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Prov. 30:6. This means that God limited what Solomon could write.</i> We infer from this that these words of wisdom spoken by Solomon were imbued with a Divine imprint even though they originated from his investigation of nature, for the wisdom of nature is also His creation, may He be blessed.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In certain instances a prophet would use the words of earlier writers or, as in this case, from those investigating the natural sciences and philosophy, and modify them with the Divine Spirit.</i>",
                    "There is a two-fold significance to knowing of this Divine influence. First, we know with certainty that these concepts [contained in Ecclesiastes] are [words of] truth, and no one can say that Solomon erred in any of his analyses, contrary to what the later generations say pertaining to the philosophies of Aristotle and the like.",
                    "[Addendum to Chapter 2]<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the Addendum to Chapter 2, the Netziv rejects an interpretation of <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i> about the eternal truth of the words of the Prophets.</i><br>[THE SHEM TOV<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is Shem Tov ben Joseph Ibn Falaquera, also spelled Palquera (c. 1225–1295). A Spanish-born Jewish philosopher and translator, he initiated reconciliation between Jewish Orthodoxy and philosophy and defended Maimonides’s work <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i> (<i>The Guide of the Perplexed</i>) against the attacks of the traditionalists.</i> on Part 2, chapter 8 of the <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i> understands the Rambam’s opinion to be that one who is wise [even in secular matters] is superior to a prophet, for the prophet’s words may contain errors, Heaven forbid. He [the Shem Tov] rejoiced in this finding, saying, “It is more valuable than any precious vessel.”<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In that chapter of <i>Moreh Nevuchim,</i> the Rambam discusses Aristotle’s rejection of the ancient belief that the motions of the heavenly spheres – the planets, sun and stars – produced powerful sounds. The Rambam states: “This belief is also widespread in our nation… and in this astronomical question, our sages have abandoned their own theory [and agreed with the Greek scientists]….” According to the Shem Tov, when the Rambam states, “This belief is also widespread in our nation,” he is referring to the prophet Ezekiel, who stated, “When they went I heard the sound of their wings like the sound of the great waters, like the waters of the Almighty….” The Shem Tov is of the opinion that this verse in Ezekiel refers to the sound generated by the heavenly spheres.</i> Nevertheless, I say that he [the Shem Tov] delights in scoffing rather than finding that which is holy.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a play on words. <i>Keli hemdah </i>means “a precious vessel,” and <i>hemed </i>is the word for “delight.”</i> He found a peg to hang it on, [i.e., an authority upon which to base his opinion]. Heaven forbid [that this should be the proper understanding of that section in <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i>], for the Rambam did not intend to express this [idea], but was referring to something else [i.e., the sages].<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is difficult to interpret the Rambam’s words in <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i> as addressing the words of Ezekiel, for the Rambam clearly states “sages” with no reference to prophets. The Rambam is referring to <i>Yoma</i> 20b which states: “Were it not for the sound of the hordes of Rome, we would hear the sound of the sun rotating.” The sages believed that the motion of the sun produces sound.</i>]",
                    "Second, since the Divine Spirit had shone upon the writing of [Koheles], we can derive from it matters unrelated to its context. As we explained in Part 2, chapter 3, this is one of the virtues of what is written with the Divine Spirit. We used this concept there to explain the disagreement [in <i>Megillah</i> 7a–b] as to whether the Book of Esther was written with Divine inspiration, [which in turn would determine what laws could be derived from the Book of Esther].<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv explained one sage to be interpreting the verse in relation to the context, since he believed that the Book of Esther was not written with Divine inspiration, whereas the other interprets the verse in a manner inconsistent with the context, since he believed it was written with the Divine Spirit.</i> We hold that Koheles was written with the Divine inspiration, and thus we can derive from it matters unrelated to its context. [An example may be found] in Tractate <i>Shabbos</i> 10a: Until when do [judges] sit in judgment? Rav Sheshes says: Until the time for the main meal of the day.<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The main meal is eaten at around noon.</i> Rav Hama says [that this may be inferred] from the verse [in Koheles], “Woe to you, O land, whose king acts like an adolescent, and whose ministers dine in the morning. Happy are you, O land, whose king is a man of dignity, and whose ministers dine at the proper time – in strength and not in drunkenness.”<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Eccl. 10:16.</i> [We infer from the words, “in strength and not in drunkenness”], that the judges should fortify themselves with the strength of Torah rather than by drinking wine.",
                    "See what I have written in <i>She’ilta</i> 51:2, how this explanation is not in line with the simple meaning of that verse.<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv explains that according to the She’iltos the words, “whose ministers dine at the proper time – in strength and not in drunkenness,” is to be interpreted as: “The ministers” – the judges involved in communal matters, “at their accustomed time for eating” – usually prior to the fifth hour – are to be immersed in the strength of Torah, and not in drink. In other words, the judges must delay their meal until after the sixth hour (noon) in order to accommodate the masses who eat at approximately the fifth hour. Most people take care of their legal affairs in the morning, since they drink during lunch.</i> In the Aggadah one can find many derivations [from Koheles] that do not relate to its context, and these derivations [were possible only] because it was written with Divine inspiration.",
                    "However, since the main theme of Koheles is the investigation of the natural sciences, this is why all [of Koheles’s] warnings [in this Book] are associated with [the name] <i>Elohim,</i> as the creations of the universe, i.e., the nature of the world, was written with the name <i>Elohim</i>.<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See for example Gen. 1:1.</i> An additional [reason for using <i>Elohim</i> in Koheles] is because the nations of the world do not know of any of [His] names other than <i>Elohim</i>. This is stated in Tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i> 60a, [where R. Hiya says that one who hears a Divine Name being blasphemed nowadays is not obligated to rend his garment. The Talmud derives that R. Hiya is speaking of hearing an idol worshiper blaspheming God’s name, <i>Elohim</i>, and not the Specific Name.<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The name <i>Elohim</i> (unlike the Tetragrammaton) is subordinate because it can be used to identify other things such as a court, such as in Ex. 21:6.</i> As the Talmud notes]: “If [R. Hiya’s statement] refers [to an idol worshipper] blaspheming the Specific Name, [we must object] – are idolaters familiar with that Name?” Since [Solomon] also taught wisdom to the scholars of the nations of the world, [he needed to use the name <i>Elohim</i>]. It is because of this [theme] the book is entitled <i>Koheles</i>,<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This means “gathering.”</i> in the feminine.<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the Netziv, the feminine form, usually consisting of the addition of the letter <i>tav</i>, denotes a form of comparative diminishment. The word, <i>Koheles</i>, meaning “one who gathers,” possesses the <i>tav</i>, and denotes a diminishment of the power or teaching associated with the gathering of people with Solomon. Since this gathering involved transmitting knowledge to the non-Jews as well, it is not the more powerful gathering that consists of the transmission of Torah, but rather the gathering associated with Solomon transmitting worldly knowledge.</i> As explained later in chapter 9, when comparing the sciences to the Torah, the feminine form is used.<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A secular scholar is represented by <i>bas</i>, “daughter,” possessing the letter <i>tav</i>, whereas a Torah Scholar is referred to as <i>beni</i>.</i> Here too, [regarding Koheles], the gathering [of scholars] to investigate the natural sciences is called <i>Koheles</i> rather than <i>Hikahel</i>.<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Koheles Rabbah</i>: “[Why was Solomon] called <i>Koheles</i>? Because his words were uttered <i>be-hikahel</i> [in public assembly], as it is written, ‘Solomon <i>yakhel</i>, assembled’” (I Kings 8:1). It would thus be more appropriate for Solomon to be called <i>hikahel</i>.</i>",
                    "[With this understanding], we learn that the warnings [and their associated] punishments that are written in Ecclesiastes [operate] in a manner [that is consistent] with human logic and where the laws of nature dictate a particular result. One should not disobey [these warnings] unless [one is able somehow to operate in a manner] that is above nature. Therefore, one should understand [that according to the simple meaning of these verses], the intent of these warnings and their associated punishments are scientifically based, and result in madness.",
                    "Along these lines, “do not be overly righteous” means that [one should] not be overly zealous with the warnings of the Torah, whether one is a Gentile or a Jew, and perform more than what is required by the Torah, since doing so may result in harm so great that life is endangered. The verse, “He who obeys the commandment will know no evil”<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Eccl. 8:5.</i> does not apply to this situation,<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To counter the argument that if a mitzvah is performed as directed by God it will result in harm, Koheles states: “He who obeys the commandment will know no evil” – no harm will result from performing the mitzvos as the King has directed. See <i>Harhev Davar</i> on Num. 7:89.</i> for in circumstances [where harm may result], a person is forbidden to perform a mitzvah. As it states in Tractate <i>Pesahim</i> 8b, [regarding the search for leaven on the eve of Passover], “[R. Nahman ben Yitzhak says that] if there is a hole in the [adjoining] wall between the dwellings of a Jew and an Aramean, he searches as far as his hand can reach.” However, [we follow the opinion of] Pleimo that he does not need to search at all, and the Gemara explains that there is no need to search at all since it involves danger.<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is concern that if the Aramean notices the Jewish neighbor inserting a candle into the hole of an adjoining wall, he will harm the Jew, suspecting him of practicing witchcraft.</i> Even though we hold “those sent to perform a mitzvah are not harmed,”<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Pesahim</i> 8a.</i> this rule does not apply when there is a likelihood of danger. The Talmud is not saying that one is exempt from searching for leaven. It is saying that one is <i>not allowed </i>to do so when there is a likelihood of danger.",
                    "The Talmud [must be saying that one may not search], as it derives this rule from the Prophet Samuel, who [when charged by God to go and anoint David as king] protested, “How can I go? If Saul finds out, he will kill me.”<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Sam. 16:2. Even though God commanded Samuel to anoint David, Samuel was concerned that Saul might kill him for doing so. Therefore, God told Samuel to take a calf with him so that it would appear that he was going in that direction in order to offer sacrifice.</i> Samuel did not feign piety by placing himself in danger when there was a likelihood of harm.<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv argues that Pleimo’s statement “There is no need” should be interpreted as “there is no need to search,” since it is forbidden to endanger oneself. If Pleimo was saying that searching is optional, then this law should not be derived from how Samuel refused to obey God’s command. Later on, the Netziv will discuss why God initially asked Samuel to endanger himself.</i> [This can also be inferred] from Tractate <i>Bava Kamma</i> 61a–b, regarding the three mighty men of David [who risked their lives] by breaking into the camp of the Philistines [in order] to ask the Sanhedrin a halachic question. King David refused to relate this ruling in the name of the three warriors, as he said, “So have I received a tradition from the Court of Samuel the Ramathite: ‘We do not cite any halachic statement in the name of one who surrenders himself to death on account of the words of the Torah.’” The reason [for David’s declaration] was that the three mighty men behaved improperly [by placing their lives in danger for the sake of that mitzvah]. Similarly, [Rava]<sup>20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Some say this was stated by R. Nahman ben Yitzhak.</i> stated in Tractate <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 35b regarding Aivu, who [practiced against the rulings of the Sages] by eating the bread of an idolater: “Do not cite Aviu because he eats Aramean bread.” The Ran cites in the name of the Geonim that Rava was stating that no halachah may be cited in his name because he acted improperly.<sup>21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The rulings, in any area, of a halachic authority who violates Halachah must not be cited. The three mighty men who violated the Torah by endangering their lives in order to perform a mitzvah are similar to a halachic authority who violates any other command of the Torah, such as eating bread made by an Aramean.</i> The three mighty men [of David] also did not act properly when they subjected themselves to danger [for the sake of a mitzvah]. This is the meaning of the warning, “Do not be overly righteous.”",
                    "Solomon’s additional warning, “Do not be overly wise,” is related to the first clause, [“Do not be overly righteous”]. In other words, he warns not to strive to be wiser than the capacity we merited to receive at the time of the giving of the Torah. This potential is recognizable from a person’s makeup and intellect. Pertaining to these two warnings, [Solomon] wrote in accordance [with the laws] of nature: “Why become demented?” For he who is overly confident that his righteousness will enable him to endure a dangerous situation, being overly confident that the merit of a mitzvah will stand him in good stead ─ when he fails, he is likely to become insane. Similarly, he who strives to become wiser than his mental capacity is likely to destroy his intellect in any area [of study] he toils to understand that is beyond his mental capacity. This appears to be the simple meaning of this verse.",
                    "However, one can argue [against this interpretation], as we see many Aggadic statements where our Sages of blessed memory seem to convey the opposite [point of view]. Tractate <i>Shabbos</i> 83b states, “The words of Torah are retained only by one who <i>memis</i> [kills himself] over them, as it states, ‘This is the Torah [law] concerning a person when <i>yamus</i>, he dies in a tent’ (Deut. 19:14).” One cannot retort that <i>memis</i> is not be taken literally as “kills himself,” but [as “deadening” one’s sensitivity to pride]. This would accord with Tractate <i>Tamid</i> 32a: “What should a person do so that he may live [spiritually]? He should kill himself.” The <i>Mefaresh</i><sup>22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The term <i>Mefaresh</i> refers to a Rishon of unclear identity.</i> explains that the phrase “kill himself” means that he should lower himself [make himself modest], implying that he should eliminate his sensitivity to not receiving [sufficient] honor or [being unable to exercise his own] desires,<sup>23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Avos</i> 2:4, “Treat His Will as if it were your own will, so that He will treat your will as if it were His Will. Nullify your will before His will, so that He will nullify the will of others before your will.”</i> for those sensitivities can nullify or disturb the power of the Torah. Tractate <i>Eruvin</i> 54a states, “R. Mattena said: ‘What is the meaning of “From the wilderness is Mattanah?”<sup>24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Num. 21:18.</i> If a man allows himself to be treated as a wilderness on which everybody treads, his study will be retained by him. Otherwise it will not.’”<sup>25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word <i>matanah</i> can also be translated as “gift.” If a person allows himself to be treated as a wilderness, he will receive the Torah as a gift.</i> There are many other similar [Aggadic] statements. Therefore, [one could strongly argue] that the previously cited statement from Tractate <i>Shabbos</i>, “one who kills himself over them,” refers to one who makes himself similar to the dead by [deadening his sensitivities and] ignoring these vanities.",
                    "However, it is impossible to explain [Tractate <i>Shabbos</i>] in this manner because of the manner in which Tractate <i>Gittin</i> 56b,<sup>26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I found it on 57b. <i>Gittin</i> cites many stories of those who sacrificed their lives for the Torah.</i> explains that same statement: For Your sake we are killed all the day long, we are counted as sheep for the slaughter” (Psalms 44:23). R. Nahman ben Yitzhak stated: “[This verse] can be applied to the students who kill themselves for the words of the Torah, in accordance with the saying of R. Shimeon ben Lakish, who said: ‘The words of the Torah reside only with one who kills himself for them, as Scripture states, “This is the Torah law concerning when a man dies in a tent.”’”  We see that the Talmud says explicitly that if one attacks his learning in such a way that if he would take the same approach with other forms of wisdom, it would result in his death ─ the merit of the Torah protects him. This [interpretation aligns well] with the inference from, “when a man dies <i>in</i> a tent.” For we infer that he [can act in a manner that is dangerous] <i>specifically when </i>he is dwelling and meditating in the tent of Torah. Whereas, according to the former explanation, [i.e., “kills himself” means that he is to kill his sense of vanity, this interpretation] would have to apply even when a person is <i>not </i>in the tent.<sup>27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One would need to guard himself from arrogance at every moment.</i> Therefore, one must conclude that the explanation is, as it says, that he endangers himself with his studies.",
                    "So did Hillel endanger himself for the words of Torah, as stated at the end of the third chapter of Tractate <i>Yoma</i>.<sup>28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">35b. “Every day Hillel would work and earn one tropaik. Half would go for his food and family, while the other half he would give to the guard at the <i>beis ha-midrash</i>. One day, he earned no money and the guard at the <i>beis ha-midrash</i> would not permit him to enter. Hillel climbed up on the roof and listened through the skylight so that he could hear the words of the living God from the mouths of Shemayah and Avtalion. It was Shabbos eve in the middle of winter, and snow began to fall. When the dawn rose, Shemayah said, ‘Brother Avtalion, every day this house is light and today it is dark. Is it a cloudy day?’ They looked up and saw the figure of a man on the skylight. They went up and found Hillel covered with three cubits of snow. They took him down, bathed him, and placed him in front of the fire. They said, ‘This man deserves to have us violate Shabbos on his behalf.’\"</i> It was [that quality of sacrifice] that stood him in good stead to ascend as the leader of all of the Sages of Israel. Similarly, Rabbi Eliezer the Great,<sup>29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is R. Eliezer ben Horkenus.</i> as it is taught in <i>Avos de-Rabbi Nassan</i><sup>30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chapter 6, <i>os</i> 3.</i> and in the beginning of <i>Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer</i>, that he did not eat for many days and endangered himself for the sake of the words of the Torah. Also in Tractate <i>Kesubos</i> at the end of the chapter entitled <i>Ha-moder</i>,<sup>31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">77b.</i> [it relates] that R. Yehoshua ben Levi would mingle with those who were stricken with [the contagious disease] <i>ra’asan</i><sup>32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A contagious type of skin disease that carries a symptom of great weakness.</i> and study Torah with them, as he relied on the merit of the Torah to protect him. He was spared from harm. This is just the opposite of the way we explained, “Do not be overly righteous,” and what we had proven from <i>Bava Kamma</i> 61a–b [pertaining to how the three mighty men of King David acted wrongly to endanger their lives for the Torah]. We also learn this concept from Tractate <i>Eruvin</i> 54,<sup>33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I found it at 55a.</i> [that states:] “‘It is not in Heaven,’<sup>34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 30:12.</i> for if it were in Heaven, you should have gone up after it.” We explained in [<i>Ha’amek She’elah</i>] 19:4, that this statement is not to be understood literally, rather as: if it is “above” [beyond the capability] of your intellect, and it is difficult to achieve, as [if it were] something that is placed in the heavens, you are required to toil thereby becoming wise [enough] by bringing it “down” [i.e., within your grasp of understanding].<sup>35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verses 12–14 state: “It is not in heaven, that you should say, ‘Who will go up to heaven and acquire it for us, and inform us of it so that we may fulfill it?’ Nor is it across the sea, that you should say, ‘Who will travel across the sea and acquire it for us, and inform us of it so that we may fulfill it?’ The matter is very close to you; in your mouth and in your mind to fulfill it.” The Netziv explains that there is a difference between what is expressed by the parable of it not being in heaven versus traveling overseas. Traveling overseas, as explained in the Talmud, refers to traveling as far as necessary to find the proper rabbi from whom to learn. The parable of ascending into the heavens cannot possibly refer to traveling a great distance, as it is impossible to ascend to the heavens. Rather it is referring to one being discouraged from acquiring a deep understanding of the Torah due to its difficulty to comprehend and its great holiness. God therefore states that it is within our grasp, for if you apply great toil in study in order to acquire various forms of knowledge and skills in analysis, you will achieve it.</i>",
                    "Also in Tractate <i>Kesubos</i> 63a regarding R. Akiva, [when he returned home as a great sage, his father-in-law,<sup>36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ben Kalba Sabua, who was one of the three richest men of Jerusalem at the time of Vespasian’s siege.</i> hearing that a great scholar had come to his town, approached R. Akiva (not realizing that R. Akiva was his son-in-law) in order to request an annulment of his vow in which he disowned his daughter for having married him. When he completed his request, R. Akiva] asked, “Would you have made your vow if you had known that he was a great man?” [His father-in-law replied, “No, even if he had known but one chapter or even a single halachah.<i>” </i>“Akiva then said to him, ‘I am the man’. The other fell upon his face and kissed his feet and also gave him half of his wealth”]. Tosafos<sup>37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Tosafos s.v. Ada’ata de-gavra rabbah mi nedart.</i> questions [why R. Akiva was allowed to suggest to his father-in-law an opening to absolution for a vow, as Akiva became a great Sage <i>after </i>the vow had been made], and it is thus considered to be <i>nolad</i>, [i.e., a different set of circumstances existed when the vow had been uttered]?<sup>38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If one wishes to annul a vow he requires three ordinary judges, or a <i>mumheh</i> [an expert judge], such as R. Akiva. In order to annul a vow, the one who took it must express regret for it. The court or <i>mumheh</i> provides an opening for this expression of regret. <i>Nedarim</i> 63a states that according to the sages, if a <i>nolad</i>, new fact, arises after the vow, it cannot be used for such an opening. Tosafos therefore questions how R. Akiva could provide an opening to his father-in-law since a particular event – his becoming a great scholar – occurred after the vow was made.</i> Tosafos answers: Since R. Akiva had been a student at the academy at the time of the vow, it would not have been considered unusual for Akiva to become a great scholar, as it is likely that those who go to the academy [to study Torah] become great men. Thus we see that [even] a simple man who does not seem competent to study Torah, such as R. Akiva who was illiterate, [can overcome his intellectual deficits]. Also, <i>Avos de-Rabbi Nassan</i><sup>39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chapter 6.</i> relates how R. Akiva, at the time he began to pursue his studies, felt that just as a stone’s [shape] was changed by a constant drip of water, [so he, by constant study, could sharpen his mind and achieve knowledge]. He became so successful that there was no [scholar] greater than he. This is [obviously] unlike the way we explained the warning, “Do not be overly wise,” [that a person should not strive to achieve wisdom beyond his inborn capabilities]."

                    "<b><small>GOD’S PROVIDENCE TRANSCENDS NATURE FOR THOSE WHO RISE ABOVE THEIR PHYSICAL NATURE</small></b> THE [ABOVE DESCRIBED CONFLICT] can be resolved by studying Nahmanides’s commentary on the Torah passage of <i>Aharei Mos.</i><sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lev. 18:4.</i> He writes that there are many ways to serve God when performing the commandments and studying the Torah diligently: Be aware that [the level] of one’s living through the commandments is proportional to one’s being prepared [mentally and emotionally] to perform them. He who performs the commandments not for their sake – i.e., who performs them to receive a reward in his world [i.e., this world] – his life in this world will consist of wealth and honor. This is what Scripture states, “<i>Bi-smolah</i> [in her left hand] are wealth and honor;”<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Prov. 3:16.</i> our Sages explained this verse as, “<i>La-misma’elim bah</i>, those who study [the Torah] not for its sake, will obtain wealth and honor.” Similarly, those who perform the commandments in order to merit [a share] in the World to Come – i.e., they serve God out of fear – merit by their intent to be saved from the judgment reserved for the wicked, and their souls will dwell [eternally] in goodness. But those who fulfill the commandments out of love, [in a manner] that is proper, while also acting properly in the affairs of this world, will be rewarded as written in <i>Im be-hukosai</i>: “Your threshing shall last until the vintage.”<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lev. 26:3.</i> In other words, they will merit achieving a good life in this world in accordance with nature, and in life eternal in the World to Come, their merits will be rewarded in a complete manner. However, those who completely forsake the concerns of this world and pay no attention to it, acting unlike physical beings, with all their thoughts and intentions being directed only to their Creator, just as was the case with Elijah – because their souls cleave to the Glorious Name, they will live forever in body and soul, as evidenced in Scripture concerning Elijah, etc.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Most of this translation is taken from Dr. Charles B. Chavel’s translation of Nahmanides’s Commentary on the Torah.</i> All of these are the words of the holy man of God, Nahmanides, may his memory be for a blessing.",
                    "We learn two main principles from his words. First, there are two approaches to performing the commandments for the sake of Heaven, where expressing love of God. One approach<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The second principle is written several pages later.</i> is to serve God for His honor, may He be blessed, without any expectation of reward – yet he does not lose the sense of his own physical being, “because he is created of flesh” and composed of human nature.<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Gen. 6:3: “My spirit shall not abide in man forever, <i>bi-shegam</i>, since he is also flesh.”</i> This is a path of holiness, and fortunate is the one who merits in [achieving] this. Pertaining to this approach the first chapter<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I found this in Chapter 2, <i>Mishnah </i>17.</i> of <i>Avos</i> teaches, “R. Yosi says… ‘Let all your deeds be for the sake of Heaven.’” <i>Avos de-Rabbi Nassan</i><sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chapter 6, <i>os</i> 3.</i> explains this Mishnah to mean “for the sake of the Torah,” i.e., he [performs the mitzvos] because the Torah directs him to do so. Even so, he does not lose the nature of man, and he does not merit to be glued in his thoughts to the Holy One, blessed be He due to the barrier created by his human nature.",
                    "There is, however, another form of love for God where one is so powerfully bound to God with love that it causes him to forsake his human nature utterly. There is nothing greater than this path of righteousness. But the righteous ones of the earlier generations, even though they had merited to [obtain] this love, to sample life consisting of the light of spiritual delight to the extent of forgetting their physical being – though their souls constantly longed to remain within that delight and purity – they did not constantly remain in that state. At times they actually reached [this spiritual pleasure], and they clung to it with Divine inspiration, whereas at times they could not immerse their thoughts totally in this love, or even if they did have the opportunity to deeply focus and hunger for it, they still were unable to achieve [Divine inspiration]. It is because of this that at times King David refers to himself as a <i>hasid</i>,<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 86:2: “Guard my soul, for I am righteous.”</i> a righteous one, and at other times as an <i>ani</i>,<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the following verses in Psalms: “Turn to me and show me favor, for I am alone and bereft” (25:16); “I am bereft and painracked; Your salvation, O God, shall raise me high” (69:30), “A prayer of David; O Lord, incline your ear, answer me, for I am bereft and destitute” (86:1) “I have been bereft and close to death since youth” (88:16).</i> one who is bereft (a distinction that has already been addressed in the Aggadah).<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi on Psalms 86:2 cites the <i>midrash</i> in which David is referred to as a <i>hasid</i> (righteous one), since he had the power to harm those who shamed or blasphemed him, and yet remained silent. See also Tractate <i>Berachos</i> 4a, where David refers to himself as righteous since he soiled himself with the blood [of menstruation], the fetus and the placenta in order to declare a woman permitted to her husband. Pertaining to <i>ani</i>, bereft, see <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> on 25:16 that David considered himself bereft in comparison to God’s greatness in addressing the needs of the people of Israel.</i> However, according to our understanding [of these terms], he referred to himself as a <i>hasid</i> because he constantly longed for that love and <i>devekus</i> [close bonding]. This is the implication of the word <i>hasid</i>, and with God’s assistance I elaborated on this at great length in my composition <i>Rinah Shel Torah</i>.<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Song of Songs 4:8.</i> Because he recognized that he himself was many times unable to achieve such a state, or that he lacked the opportunity to achieve his holy soul’s longing, he [also] referred to himself as <i>ani</i>. For an <i>ani</i> is simply one who is unhappy with his lot in the area of the service of God, and [he felt bereft] that on many an occasion he could not fulfill his great want.",
                    "Truly, if a person were to merit being a <i>merkavah de-shechinah</i> [a Chariot of the Divine Presence] ceaselessly,<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Bereshis Rabbah</i> 47:6 where Avraham, Yitzhak and Yaakov are referred to as being a <i>Merkavah de-Shechinah</i> (a dwelling and sanctuary for the Divine Presence). There the <i>Etz Yosef</i> quotes the <i>Kli Yakar,</i> who states this term refers to one who is at such a great spiritual height that it is “as if he supports the Divine Throne,” with no “intermediary existing between him and the Divine Presence.” Also see page 20 of <i>Imrei Shefer</i> (Kefar Hasidim edition), that this is one of the meanings of the phrase “The dwelling of the eternal God” (Deut. 33:27) – that the sage is a <i>Merkavah de-Shechinah.</i></i> he would never die, as experienced by Elijah the Prophet.<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Mo’ed Katan</i> 26a.</i> However, [if everyone reached such a state], the world would never be inhabited, as I wrote, with Heaven’s help, in the <i>Hashmatos</i><sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It appears that this reference was to a <i>hashmatah</i> in an earlier version, after which it was integrated into the main body of the text in <i>She’iltah</i> 15, <i>os</i> 6. There the Netziv writes that based on what is written in the <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> on <i>Koheles</i> 3:15 and on Nahmanides’s commentary on <i>Bereshis</i> 2:17, when Adam lived in Gan Eden, he was capable of developing and inhabiting the earth even as he received God’s Divine Light. However, once Adam was expelled from Gan Eden, the world could only be inhabited if human beings were connected to the Earth. This is stated in <i>Koheles</i> (3:11), “He made everything beautiful in its time and also the world He put into their heart.” The <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> interprets this verse to mean that God gave human beings an evil inclination (in this case, a competitive spirit), for without it, human beings would lack the desire to build and inhabit the earth. But one who aspires to become a <i>Merkavah de-Shechinah</i> – to live in a constant spiritual state – must separate oneself from the physical aspects of this world. This is why Ben Azzai never married, as quoted in Tractate <i>Yevamos</i> 63b, “But what shall I do, seeing that my soul is in love with the Torah? The world can be carried on by others.” The Netziv elaborates further upon this concept in <i>Ha’amek Davar</i> on Gen. 2:9.</i> [Omissions], 21:6 ─ the world was not created for [everyone to be a <i>Merkavah de-shechinah</i>] but rather to be inhabited. Nonetheless, one who [constantly] longs to express his love for God finds many opportunities to function as a Chariot of the Divine Presence and to disregard himself [i.e., his physical nature]. As we explained in <i>She’ilta</i> 1,<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Os</i> 21.</i> pertaining to Hillel, because all his acts were performed for the sake of Heaven, he reached a level that nullified his physical being, such that he did not desire [physical pleasure] from his eating and bathing. For him, these things became [a spiritual act] similar to laying tefillin and the like. This is the first concept that we learn from Nahmanides’s words.",
                    "The second concept that we learn from Nahmanides, of blessed memory, is that the manner of God’s Providence over Israel is proportional to how Israel serves Him. Thus, it also naturally follows that there will be a difference in this world for the one who serves out of love – yet he remains within his human nature, which is what the Holy One, blessed be He, has provided. Providence relates to him in a manner that does not completely negate nature, [though] the eye of God is directed towards those who fear Him<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Psalms 33:18, “Behold, the eye of God is on those who fear Him; upon those who await His kindness.”</i> with a Divine Providence that is characterized<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, “branded.”</i> by nature. This is the attribute of the Kingdom of God, may He be blessed; His Providence [as applied to individuals] is similar to how He [generally] governs the world [i.e., in accordance with nature]. Therefore, if such a person places himself in a dangerous situation and he requires a miracle that transcends nature, God, may He be blessed, will not assist him.",
                    "However, if he is able to rise above human nature and becomes an Israelite through whom God, may He be blessed, becomes glorified, His Providence in return transcends the nature of the world, and [He] will cause His glorious arm to march at his right hand.<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Isa. 63:12, “Who made His glorious arm march at the right hand of Moshe.”</i> This matter is further elaborated in my compilation, <i>Ha’amek Davar</i>, on the Torah passage of <i>Yisro,</i><sup>20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ex. 19:4–6: “You have seen what I did to Egypt, and that I have borne you on the wings of eagles and brought you to Me. And now, if you hearken well to Me and observe My covenant, you shall be to Me the most beloved treasure of all peoples, for Mine is the entire world. You shall be to Me a kingdom of ministers and a holy nation.” To paraphrase the Netziv’s interpretation of these verses: “You have seen what I have done to Egypt for your sake, and how I have sustained you in a manner that transcends nature. From now on, Divine Providence will be in accordance with your acts. If you study the Torah well and serve Me, you will merit these rewards. From now on, the nations of the world can only achieve this spiritual goal if they join the Jewish nation, a beloved treasure collected of all different peoples who dwell upon My earth. If you serve me properly, Divine Providence will govern as a kingdom of ministers, in a favorable manner consistent with nature. However, if you perform the mitzvos for the sake of Heaven, you will be treated as a holy and distinctive nation in which Divine Providence shall manifest in a manner that transcends nature.”</i> where I explain that God communicated this concept to Israel at the gathering [around Mount Sinai] prior to the giving of the Torah, with Moshe reiterating this at the giving of the Second Tablets. I also discussed these two ways of performing the Commandments and their respective ways of Providence on the Torah portion dealing with <i>tzitzis</i> [fringes], read daily [in the <i>shema</i>].<sup>21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv writes in Num. 15:38–41 that the azure threads of the <i>tzitzis</i> represent the Divine Throne, while the white ones represent man’s involvement in the world. Some Jews are similar to the white threads, being constantly involved in worldly affairs, while those who are immersed in the Torah and in spiritual affairs are represented by the purple threads. We read the <i>shema</i> daily in order to understand that regardless of whether we comprise the <i>Merkavah de-Shechinah</i> or are immersed in day-to-day affairs, we cannot ignore the daily performance of mitzvos and we must perform them at their proper time, even if they appear to interrupt our financial or spiritual growth. Verse 41 states: “I am the Lord your God Who took you from the land of Egypt to be your God; I am the Lord your God.” The phrase “I am the Lord your God” is repeated twice to represent the two forms of Divine Providence: once for those who are involved in worldly affairs, is to perform the mitzvos that they received upon leaving Egypt, and again for those who are the <i>Merkava de-Shechina</i>, who existed both before and after the exodus from Egypt.</i> This subject is quite involved and it will be explained there [in <i>Ha’amek Davar</i>] as God decrees that it should be so, and may He assist me in that task. [However, I am not delving into this concept of Providence] here, I am only touching on this subject to clarify and answer the question at hand.",
                    "It can be said with certainty that if one has not attained this level of love of disregarding his physical being, i.e., he has not left the category of human nature, it is forbidden for him to feign righteousness and place himself in a dangerous situation. However, he who stands on the Mountain of God and serves Him in His holy place,<sup>22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Similar to Psalms 24:3, “Who may ascend the mountain of God, and who may stand in His holy place?” The Netziv in <i>Ha’amek Davar</i>, Ex. 3:5, writes that in this context, the phrase “holy place” represents one being in a holy state or on a high level.</i> has removed the sandal from his foot,<sup>23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When Moshe approached to view the Burning Bush, God commanded him, “Remove your shoes from your feet, for the place upon which you stand is holy ground” (Ex. 3:5). The Netziv writes in <i>Ha’amek Davar</i> that God was telling Moshe that he was in a place or state of holiness, and was thus required to remove the physical barriers that his shoes represented and to dedicate himself to the sacred. This is the same reason that people were required to remove their shoes in the precincts of the Holy Temple.</i> and has removed the bodily attire of nature, there is no matter that stands before him, every [potential obstacle] becomes [flattened] as a plane. He may then perform the commandments under any dangerous circumstance.",
                    "This concept clarifies what Tractate <i>Pesahim</i> 8b states [regarding the search for leaven on the eve of Passover]: “If there is a hole in the adjoining wall between the dwellings of a Jew and an Aramean, [according to the Tanna Kamma] he searches as far as his hand can reach.” [According to Pleimo, however, he is not to search at all]. This disagreement is difficult to understand, for should not the Tanna Kamma be concerned with the likelihood of harm? And if in fact the [Tanna Kamma] disagrees [with Pleimo and holds that one is to perform the search even though there is a likelihood of harm], why do we follow the opinion of Pleimo [when he is a lone authority]?<sup>24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Tanna Kamma represents the majority opinion.</i>",
                    "[Addendum to Chapter 3]<sup>25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the Addendum to Chapter 3, the Netziv rejects the Rosh’s explanation of the disagreement between the Tanna Kamma and Pleimo.</i><br>[THE ROSH STATES that [there is a rule that] when we deal with dangerous situations, we follow the lone authority.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rosh understands the Tanna Kamma to be of the opinion that we do not concern ourselves with this probability of danger.</i> I find this difficult based on what is stated in the chapter entitled <i>Mi Mefanim</i>.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tractate <i>Shabbos</i> 129b.</i> [The Talmud there discusses the lone opinion of R. Yosi, which is cited in the Mishnah in Tractate <i>Shabbos</i> 128b, that when delivering a baby on the Sabbath] one may sever the umbilical cord to reduce the risk of danger to the infant. [Tractate <i>Shabbos</i> 129b] states, “Rav Nahman said in the name of Rabbah, the son of Avuha, who said in the name of Rav that the halachah is in accordance with R. Yosi” [who opposes the majority opinion, as stated by the Tanna Kamma, that one may only tie the umbilical cord]. Therefore, we see [that there is no rule that we follow the lone opinion when there is a risk of danger], for without [Rav Nahman’s clarification] we would not rule [that the halachah is in accordance with R. Yosi].<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Meromei Sadeh,</i> the Netziv concedes that one might answer that there was a need to state that the Halachah goes according to R. Yosi because the prohibition of cutting an umbilical cord on the Sabbath originates in the Torah. On the other hand, there was no need to state that the Halachah goes according to Pleimo, since the requirement for searching for leaven on the eve of Passover is of rabbinic origin. However, the Netziv argues that the Tanna Kamma must also agree that one does not search for leaven when doing so would involve risk. Otherwise, the Gemara should challenge the Tanna Kamma, asking why God told Samuel to take a calf to conceal his going to anoint David as king.</i>]",
                    "You may wish to argue that [the Tanna Kamma and Pleimo do not disagree], as the Tanna Kamma is discussing a special circumstance where it clearly does not involve any danger – the Jew knows that his Aramean neighbor will not suspect him of witchcraft. If so, what is Pleimo’s reason [forbidding one to perform the search]? [If Pleimo is speaking of a different circumstance than the Tanna Kamma, this distinction] should have been clarified as, “According to Pleimo, if the [search] involves danger, one may not search.” Rather [it must be that] the Tanna Kamma, [like Pleimo], is discussing [searching for leaven] in a dangerous situation with a likelihood of harm; however, he is speaking of a person who confidently knows of himself that he will nullify his physical senses when he performs this mitzvah. [The Tanna Kamma is also] teaching the basic law regarding to what extent one needs to search a hole for leaven, and that is as far as his hand will reach. However, certainly, not every person merits to reach such a spiritual level and it goes without saying that [a halachic authority] cannot rule for one who comes to inquire [to perform a mitzvah in a dangerous situation], for one cannot ascertain what lies in another’s heart. [Therefore, Pleimo is stating that we must never rule that others should endanger themselves by performing any mitzvah].",
                    "Behold, [when] the Holy One, blessed be He, [directed Samuel to anoint David as king],<sup>26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See I Sam. 16:1–13.</i> He did not direct Samuel from the outset, “Take a calf with you” [to conceal his task from Saul], until Samuel asked Him [what to do, as he feared that Saul might kill him if he were to discover the purpose of his mission]. For certain, Samuel was at an extremely high spiritual level, but it was only in this instance [that he could not reach that level] since he was pained [to be involved in the termination] of Saul’s reign. He could not be confident in this dangerous situation, as he could not find the joy of heart that he required in order to achieve a powerful love and connection to God. It was because of this that Samuel properly asked [God how he could perform this task, since it involved danger], and God’s response [to Samuel] was that he was not to endanger himself, [and to conceal from Saul the fact that he had anointed David as king].<sup>27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv is explaining that God directs human beings according to their current state, not their potential state. Before Samuel became distressed over this command, he was in his usual high spiritual state and was therefore commanded to perform this act in a manner that transcended nature. Once Samuel received God’s order and realized, to his disappointment, that he was unable to carry it out at this high spiritual level, he protested. God then told him to take the calf.</i>",
                    "In my previously referenced compilation, [<i>Ha’amek Davar</i>], I explained that this was Moshe’s request after [the sin of the Golden] Calf: “Whoever is for God, [let him come] to me, and all the Levites gathered unto him.”<sup>28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ex. 32:26.</i> Moshe’s request was not directed to those who did not worship the Golden Calf, as there were many others [besides the Levites] who did not serve the Golden Calf; there were only three thousand men who had sinned.<sup>29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 28 states that only three thousand men were killed by the Levites.</i> Rather, [his request was directed to those who were on a high spiritual level] because he wanted to direct them to perform a very dangerous task of going from gate to gate and killing openly the men they were seeking. It was certainly possible that the [sinners’] relatives and friends would fight the Levites, resulting in atrocities from a battle ensuing in the camp. This dangerous task could not be achieved other than by one who was confident that he “is for God” [deeply immersed in God’s service]. This is similar to the way in which the <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> on <i>Mattos</i><sup>30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Num., <i>Parasha</i> 22.</i> explains the verse, “He whom you shall serve,”<sup>31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 10:20.</i> meaning, “You are to dedicate yourself to the Torah and to occupy yourself with the commandments [to the extent] that you have no other service,” i.e., he does not serve himself at all. [Only such a person] could be assured that calamity would not result from his passing [throughout the camp to kill those who served the Golden Calf]. The Levites were so successful that not a single one was harmed, and it was because of this that Moshe blessed them: “Dedicate yourselves [from] this day [forward] to God, for each has opposed his son and his brother, that He may bestow upon you a blessing [from] this day [forward].”<sup>32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ex. 32:29.</i> [Moshe] means that they had utterly forsaken their personal needs to the extent that it would not have been <i>difficult </i>for them to kill his son or brother by his own hand. It is because of this that the Levites were blessed [by Moshe] in the wilderness [so they] could reach this elevated manner of service.

For certain, even if she had received pleasure from it, she would be allowed to perform this act to save the Jewish people. Nevertheless, it is a dangerous path, for one may not derive pleasure during the commission of a sin. The great mitzvah of saving Jewish lives does not negate the sin or the [prohibition] of receiving pleasure from it. If it was so, [that she received pleasure from that sin], then she did not achieve the lofty [level] of one deserving the praise [expressed in Devorah’s] song that was composed with Divine inspiration. One cannot argue that since she performed that act for its own sake, [to save the Jewish people], then she must have forgotten her [physical] self ─ that would be a more heavenly and lofty level than that which Yael had reached, for in spite of all her righteousness [to risk her life] she still derived pleasure [from the act]. [Therefore, the Talmud answers] that the “favors of the wicked are disdained by the righteous” – [in fact, Yael received no physical pleasure from the act].<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the Gemara could initially believe that Yael received pleasure from Sisera, we infer that even when one performs the most important mitzvah for its own sake, one does not necessarily rise above his or her nature.</i>",
                    "All of this applies to the performance of the mitzvos – not so regarding the diligent study of the Torah. (Though it is a mitzvah like any other<i>,</i> where one may study the Torah for its own sake without negating his sensitivities to his physical being, and it would thus be forbidden to go and study the Torah in a dangerous environment). Nevertheless, the Torah is called a “beloved hind”;<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Prov. 5:19. This is figurative of a beloved woman.</i> a praise implying [an effect] where one who engages in deep [Torah] study even for a moment, it will naturally follow for his Jewish soul to cleave to [the Talmud] with a most powerful love, such that he forgets his physical self.<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tractate <i>Eruvin</i> 54b states, “Why are the Torah’s words compared to a hind? To tell you that as a hind has a narrow womb and is loved by its mate at all times as at the first moment of their meeting, so it is with the words of the Torah – they are loved by those who study them at all times as at the moment when they first made their acquaintance.”</i> This is demonstrated in Tractate <i>Shabbos</i> 88a, where Rava did not notice how he ground his fingers [under his feet] and his fingers spurted blood, since he was so engrossed [in Torah study].",
                    "Also see Tractate <i>Eruvin</i> 54b pertaining to the verse, “May you always be insane with her [the Torah’s] love,”<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Prov. 5:19.</i> “This refers to R. Elazar ben Pedos, who would sit and study Torah in the lower market of Tzipori and would forget his cloak, leaving it in the lower market of Tzipori.” It was not, Heaven forbid, that he left his cloak there on purpose, rather since he was so immersed in the analysis [of Torah], combined with an intense love, that he forgot his personal needs. Pertaining to this, the verse [in Proverbs] states that with the love of [Torah] one is allowed to act insanely; one who acts in an unusual manner is called insane. In truth it is forbidden to act in a manner that is considered insane to others, however, [since] the love of Torah results in one forgetting his human nature, one is permitted to act in an “insane” manner.",
                    "[<i>Eruvin</i> 54b] states further, R. Shmuel ben Nahmani, said, “… [What is the meaning of the verse] ‘She effuses charm?’<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Id.</i> This teaches that [the Torah] brings allure to those who study it.” This means that when [people] usually see a person acting insanely, or one who deviates from accepted behavior, such a person is detested by mankind. This is not so with one who clings [to God] through the love of Torah and deviates from [normal] human behavior. Such a person is not despised, Heaven forbid; everyone exalts him with graciousness and honor.",
                    "However, this only happens when one performs this [mitzvah] with true love, rather than with a love for himself – out of an ulterior motive. For then he will not be successful, and thus it would be prohibited to act in such a way, because of the [resulting] profanation of God’s name and the disgrace of Torah’s honor. They said of R. Elazar ben Pedos that one time they saw a poisonous snake lying on [R. Elazar’s] cloak, [thereby preventing others from stealing it]. [This honor of the Torah occurred] from [R. Elazar’s] clinging [to the Torah] with true love, and thus all [barriers were leveled] before him as a plane. The change of nature was not too exalted for him. It therefore naturally follows that one may risk one’s safety by analyzing the Torah deeply in such a way that if he [in a similar circumstance] were to apply analysis and mental toil in other areas of wisdom, he would, by the nature of things, endanger himself or become demented.",
                    "However, the love of Torah is more exalted than any other act, and it is understandable why [the Torah] states, “If a man dies <i>in</i> a tent,” [which is interpreted by the Talmud to mean] that a person may place himself in a dangerous situation while he is <i>within </i>the tent of Torah, a moment in which he is clasped within her love and diligence [of study]. This was not so with the three mighty men [of David] who stood on the battlefield. They were not engrossed in the diligent study of the Torah, but went to enquire of the [Sanhedrin] at the gates of Bethlehem about a halachic matter. Even though they traveled there for the sake of Heaven, it was like any other mitzvah, where the act itself does not induce clinging to God, unless as we have elaborated above, he is one who has reached the level [of rising above their physical nature]."

                    "<b><small>A FURTHER ELABORATION OF HOW TORAH STUDY, EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF THE TEMPLE, ENABLES ONE TO TRANSCEND THE PHYSICAL REALM</small></b><br>TO FURTHER ELABORATE and clarify this matter, I would like to begin by quoting <i>Avos de-Rabbi Nassan</i>, chapter 28: “R. Nassan said, ‘There is no love like the love of Torah, there is no wisdom as the wisdom of the Land of Israel, there is no beauty, and so on.’” R. Nassan teaches us that spiritual love is greater and more powerful in potential than the love that results from physical pleasure, which has a finite limit. All that man aspires to achieve in physical love is provided for the sake of what his soul loves, [a form of love] that has precedence over everything [and is experienced by all]. This is not so with the love of Torah, which is so powerful in capacity, to the extent that the soul [reciprocates] and also contributes love for [the Torah’s] sake, [as experienced by] the one whose soul is greatly accustomed to her study and taste. Even though this is difficult to conceptualize and is incomprehensible to the one who has not experienced it – since it is beyond man’s intellect and human nature – however, its truth is known to the one who experiences this additional spirit within himself<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Mal. 2:15.</i> and is bound to the spirit of the wisdom of the Torah.",
                    "This is what Tractate <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 4a is expressing in its interpretation of this verse describing [God’s promise to] Israel: “Daughters of kings are with your precious ones; at your right hand the <i>shegal</i> stands erect in the golden jewelry of Ophir.”<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 45:10.</i> If <i>shegal</i> means “dog,” what promise is the prophet bringing to Israel? What he means is this: Because the Torah is as dear to Israel as a <i>shegal</i> is to the heathens, you have earned as your reward the gold of Ophir.”",
                    "Behold, this parable is like “vinegar to the teeth and smoke for the eyes.”<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Prov. 10:26.</i> However, the interpretation is that regarding all different forms of love existing in the world, even though there are diverse ways in experiencing love, as some may have a great love for one thing while others have a greater love for another, even so, everyone can identify with the various sorts of love through their natural human intellect [and experiences]. This is not the case with the love of Torah which is so powerful, the Torah of the Living God – never can it be perceived by one who has never experienced it. [Such a person] can only perceive it by comparing it to the other physical loves that he has experienced, such as the love for a dog that is experienced by those who play with it; which is incomprehensible to those who never experienced this lowly type of love. [The verse is expressing that] the reward for the Torah being beloved by Israel is a lofty matter which is incomprehensible to those [who have not experienced it], just as the [lowly] love of the <i>shegal</i> [dog] is incomprehensible to the human intellect. [By achieving this love of Torah], you will have merited obtaining the gold of Ophir.",
                    "The reason and cause for this [Torah] love, indeed its very origin is explained in the Aggadah of Tractate <i>Bechoros</i> 8b, where the Athenian sages stated the argument to R. Yehoshua ben Hanania: If a man goes and asks the hand of a woman in marriage, but [her family declines] and does not offer her to him, why should he see fit to go where the people are of higher social status than the first woman and seek one of their daughters? [If he was found unworthy by the first, more common family, he will surely be unacceptable to the second].” [R. Yehoshua] took a pin and stuck it in the lower part of the wall, but the [pin] did not enter. [R. Yehoshua then raised his arm and stuck the pin] in the upper [part of the wall, where there was a crack] and it entered. [R. Yehoshua] said [to the Athenians], “This [man] too, [despite his rejection by the first family], may chance to find [among the second family] a woman of his constellation.”  Clearly, the Athenian sages were not asking R. Yehoshua frivolous questions. Certainly they were asking about very important matters that pertained to the differences between Israel and the other nations. [The Athenian sages] were attempting to prove that the Jewish religion was inferior to paganism, for when the Holy One, blessed be He, was giving the Torah, He [first] approached [the other nations such as] Paran and Edom, who rejected it, [and only afterwards] did He offer it to the people of Israel who accepted it. [If God approached Israel last], how could they possibly be greater than the other nations in wisdom and importance?  R. Yehoshua responded that certainly [the other nations] are [by nature] wiser and greater in measure than Israel. However, the nations of the world are not of the same constellation of the Torah, while Israel is. It states in the Zohar, “Israel and the Torah are one,” meaning, the root of the Spirit of Israel is bound up together with the root of the Torah. This is the reason that Israel and the Torah were brought together in a powerful love similar to the way a flame clings to its source [in Heaven], when unrestrained by something [such as a wick].<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When a flame is not “held” by an item such as a wick, it “returns” to the source of fire that exists in Heaven. See <i>Rinah shel Torah</i> on Song of Songs 1:2.</i> When the spirit and soul of Israel embrace for a few moments in the sharpening of the mind in the study of Torah, they [the Torah and Israel] combine to become a single spiritual torch. This is a love powerful in magnitude.",
                    "However, we still do not understand the previously cited statement of R. Nassan. Why did R. Nassan state, “There is no love like the love of Torah”? Should he not have stated that “There is no love like the love of the Holy One, blessed be He?” In chapter 8 of Song of Songs it is written: “Love [for You] is as strong as death,” for it is the <i>nishmisa de-nishmatin</i>, “the soul of the souls” (this is the language of the <i>Zohar</i> on the Torah portion of <i>Beha’alosecha</i> 152b). [In other words, it is as if God is the Soul consisting of the souls] of Israel. [God] is the origin of both the Torah and Israel.<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Ha’amek Davar</i> on Gen. 49:24 and Deut. 32:9, the Netziv writes that <i>nishmisa de-nishmatin</i> expresses the relationship between the individual souls of Israel and God similar to how different strands are combined to make a rope. The individual souls of Israel are like the strands that dangle from one end of a rope – which, although they are separate, are bound to God in a manner similar to the way these individual strands are twisted together to form a tight and solid mass at its other end.</i>",
                    "One should understand that a complete love is consummated when the beloved draws close to the one who desires to pour forth his spirit of love. If the beloved does not draw close to him, so that his love does not match the one who desires to express it – then for certain, the love becomes degraded and weakened.",
                    "[Addendum 1 to Chapter 5]<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Addendum 1 to Chapter 5, the Netziv uses this concept of reciprocal love to explain what King David said of Yonassan: “Your love was more wonderful to me than the love of women” (II Sam. 1:26).</i><br>[THIS IS WHAT King David said of Yonasan, “Your love was more wonderful to me than the love of women.”<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Sam. 1:26.</i> [King David] did not say “Our love was more wonderful than the love of women,” which would suggest that they loved one another [equally]; David’s love for Yonasan was not as extraordinary. Yonasan drew himself close to David in the greatest possible manner, even though his love for David was much greater in measure [than David’s love for him]. David did not express the same powerful love to Yonassan, for his [David’s] capacity for love was less. It is common that a woman’s love for her husband is greater in measure than her husband’s is for her; nevertheless, her love towards him is powerful since the man expresses his desire for her and pours forth his spirit upon her. David did not express great love for Yonasan, for [his expression of love] was smaller in measure [than Yonasan’s], and thus [David] could not find the emotion to pour his love upon him. Even so, Yonasan loved David with the [deepest] love of the soul, thus the love of Yonasan was [truly] “more wonderful than the love of women.”]",
                    "It describes in Tractate <i>Yoma</i>, in the chapter <i>Hotziah loh</i>, 54a, to enable this end result [of bringing love between God and Israel], the <i>kohanim</i> [Priests] would pull back the <i>Paroches</i><sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the curtain that separated the main sanctuary from the Holy of Holies.</i> so the Jewish masses could see the <i>Keruvim</i><sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These are the Cherubs, the figurines of the baby-faced angels that stood on the top of the Ark.</i> embracing one another, [thus displaying God’s love for Israel] as the love of a male and female [for one another]. [The <i>kohanim</i>] did not do this to instill pride, Heaven forbid, but so that the people should more readily love and cleave to Him, may He be blessed. For when Israel expressed its love for God, it would be impossible to achieve a complete love for God, unless at that time God [reciprocated] by bestowing his love in abundance for Israel. This only occurred only in the Land of Israel and in a generation that was worthy of this. It cannot occur in these days, as it states in the second chapter of Tractate <i>Sukkah</i><sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I found this talmudic statement in Tractates <i>Sotah</i> 48b and <i>Sanhedrin</i> 11a.</i> that [even though] it was fitting that the Divine Spirit should rest upon [certain pious sages, it did not occur] because the generation was not worthy.",
                    "This is unlike the love of Torah, as a complete love can be experienced in any place or time, as [expressed by] wisdom’s statement communicated by Solomon through Divine inspiration, “I love them who love me, and those who seek me earnestly shall find Me.”<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Prov. 8:17.</i> Two things are guaranteed, that she [the Torah] loves us [Israel], and that [the Torah] is readily accessible. It states in Tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i> 91,<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is actually 99b. See Part 2, chapter 6 for an additional understanding of this talmudic statement.</i> “‘When the soul toils, the soul then toils for him,’<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Prov. 16:26.</i> he toils in one place and then the Torah toils for him in another.” The Torah assists [by both helping him] to understand it and by sweetening his heart so that he is drawn unto her with a complete love that is spiritual [in nature and] most powerful. In conclusion, in these times the love of Torah is more precious before God than the love of God, for [only] the love of Torah can be achieved in a most complete manner.",
                    "The <i>Aggadah</i><sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Midrash Shohar Tov</i> (1:8) that this request of King David was expressed in (Psalms 19:15): “Let the words of my mouth be acceptable.”</i> states that King David of blessed memory requested of the Holy One, blessed be He, that He consider the recitation of Psalms as if one had stated the laws of <i>Negaim</i><sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These are the rules that concern the treatment of different types of leprosy in people, garments and dwellings in accordance with Lev. chapters 8–9, and the prescriptions for the leper’s purification.</i> and <i>Ohalos</i>.<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These are the laws that concern the defilement conveyed by a corpse to persons or ‘vessels’ which happen to be in the same tent or under the same roof.</i> This implies that studying the Torah with deep analysis is more precious than the hymns and praises of Psalms in arousing Israel to love their Father in Heaven. It is then difficult to understand why David had uttered so many praises [of God], for would it not have been better for him to occupy his time instead with the study of the laws of <i>Negaim</i> and <i>Ohalos</i> [which would have brought him to a higher level]? Is it possible to say that David troubled himself [to compose Psalms only] for those men who lack the strength to study the Torah in depth? However, the correct understanding [of this <i>midrash</i>] is that certainly King David himself experienced Divine inspiration while he recited the various Psalms. Since he achieved a complete love of God, certainly for David, [the love of God] was more precious than the love of Torah.<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">David could achieve a full love of God since he experienced God’s reciprocal love.</i> However, in those generations where man cannot experience Divine inspiration through the recitation of Psalms, even though it arouses one to grasp a certain level of loving God, it cannot be achieved to its fullest. This is not so with obtaining the love of Torah, [i.e., the laws of <i>Negaim</i> and <i>Ohalos</i>] for it can be achieved to its fullest, and is thus more precious and greater than anything else.",
                    "One should know that the love of Torah is precious in two ways. One: it causes the love of God, for it is a stepping stone for approaching this level – for those who wish to ascend to this most elevated love of holiness. This is taught in the <i>Sifrei</i><sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sifrei</i> on Deut. 6:6</i> on the Torah portion of <i>Va-es’hanan</i>: The Torah states, “You are to love the Lord your God… these words that I command you today shall be upon your heart.”<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 6:5–6.</i> I would not know how I should love the Holy One, blessed be He, therefore Scripture states, “And these words,” i.e., [with the Torah] you will understand the Holy One, blessed be He, and you will cling to His ways.” This is explained further in my compilation, <i>Rinah shel Torah</i>.<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Song of Songs 3:1, where the Netziv using the Rambam in <i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilchos Yesodei ha-Torah</i>, chapter 2, explains the <i>Sifrei </i>to be stating that when one first achieves Torah knowledge, one can then obtain a deep love of God by understanding His wondrous creations.</i>",
                    "Second, even if one who does possess the mind or desire to reach such a level, it is possible for one to toil and exhaust himself with the Torah and to cling to it with love and yet never experience the clinging to or love of God, since he did not focus on [reaching this goal]. This is similar to how a specialized tool will not benefit a craftsman if he does not perform the task for which [the tool] is designed; the craftsman does not wish to perform that particular task. Similarly, the word of God does not benefit [even] one who meditates on [the Torah], to achieve the love of God, if one does not concentrate on achieving it. Even so, the love of Torah itself is precious and esteemed in the eyes of God to the extent as described by our Sages in Tractate <i>Avodah Zarah</i>, 3b: During the day, the Lord strings a thread of grace around those who study the Torah by night, as Scripture states, “In the daytime, God will command His lovingkindness. Even by night His song is with me, a prayer to the God of my life.”<sup>20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 42:9.</i>",
                    "Kindness in this context means that his prayer will be accepted [by God], as indicated by the ending words of the verse, “a prayer to the God of my life.” The simple understanding of the words, “His song is with me,” describes how, when reciting hymns and praise by night, he grasps love and cleaves to the Holy One, blessed be He. [However], R. Simon ben Levi, explains that <i>shira</i> [song] is referring to the song [utterance] of the Torah. As it states in Tractate <i>Nedarim</i> 38a, that the verse “In order that this <i>song </i>will be for Me a witness against the Children of Israel”<sup>21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 31:19. The verse reads in full: “Now write for yourselves this song and teach it to the Children of Israel to place it in their mouths, in order that this song will be for Me a witness against the Children of Israel.”</i> refers to the entire Torah. [We thus infer that the interpretation of “His song is with me,” is “His Torah is with me,” and King David is stating that by studying the Torah at night], one reaches a level where one’s prayer is accepted by day.",
                    "[Addendum 2 to Chapter 5]<sup>22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv in Addendum 2 to Chapter 5 [By understanding that “love of God” can be synonymous with “the study of Torah”] assists us in understanding [a seemingly difficult <i>mishnah</i>] at the end of Tractate <i>Uktzin</i>: “In the future, the Holy One, blessed be He, will bequeath to each and every righteous person 310 worlds, as it is written: ‘I will cause those who love Me to inherit <i>yesh</i> [substance] so that I may fill their storehouses’” (Prov. 8:21).</i><br>[THE UNDERSTANDING THAT the love of God can be synonymous with the study of Torah] assists us in understanding [a seemingly difficult mishnah] at the end of Tractate <i>Uktzin</i>:<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Uktzin</i> 3:12.</i> R. Yehoshua ben Levi said, “In the future, the Holy One, blessed be He, will bequeath three hundred and ten worlds to each and every righteous person, for it is written: ‘I will cause those who love Me to inherit <i>yesh</i> [substance], so that I may fill their storehouses.’”<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Prov. 8:21. The numerical value of the word <i>yesh</i> (substance) is 310.</i>",
                    "At first glance this statement is difficult to understand, since “each and every righteous person” includes even one who serves God out of fear. [We know that] one [who serves God out of fear] is also referred to as “a righteous person” from what is stated at the end of the fifth chapter of Tractate <i>Sotah</i>,<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">31a.</i> when [Rava told two of his students], “Both of you are completely righteous rabbis, but one is motivated by love and the other by fear.” However, [this verse cannot possibly include those who fear Him], for the verse specifies “those who love Me,” meaning only those who serve God out of love. However, [on the other hand the words] “those who love Me” surely cannot be specific to those who serve God with love. Otherwise, the wording at the end of the verse, “That I may fill their storehouses” would not fit well [“storehouse” describes elsewhere those who serve God out of fear], as used in the verse, “The fear of God is His storehouse.”<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isa. 33:6.</i>",
                    "Rather, the entire verse is discussing how the Torah provides an inheritance for “those who love Me,” [meaning] that the Torah provides an inheritance for those who study the Torah diligently with love [and, as shall be explained, can also include those who serve God out of fear]. “Inheritance” refers to a share in the 310 worlds, for [“world”] refers to secular wisdom, for every area of study is a world unto itself. Whoever studies the Torah diligently out of love, will achieve with ease, the knowledge in the other areas of wisdom, without the need to expend much effort. For this reason the accumulation of secular knowledge is compared to an “inheritance,” as an inheritance is obtained without toil or labor. One’s comprehension in other fields of study increases proportional to the amount of work that one applies to Torah study. This is why the verse ends with the words, “I will fill their storehouses,” meaning, one’s storehouse will be filled with the fear of God. A [righteous person] wishes to know how to perform the commandments without lacking the knowledge required to fulfill any commandment requiring an understanding of science and the like. It is because of people’s diligence in Torah study, combined with love, that God promises them that He will help them to fill their storehouses [i.e., accumulate knowledge] so that they may comprehend various areas of knowledge and thus be able to perform the commandments properly. That is why R. Yehoshua ben Levi closes the six orders of the Mishnah with his statement [“God will bestow upon every righteous person a share in 310 worlds”], for the six orders of the Mishnah involve all forms of knowledge and wisdom. If one should wonder how it will be possible to know how to calculate exactly the [various] measures required in every area [of halachah] (as this involves a thorough understanding of the areas of science and secular knowledge); R. Yehoshua ben Levi answers that you should not wonder about this since the Torah states: “Those who love Me will inherit <i>yesh</i> [substance]” – [the love for Torah] assists one to obtain understanding in all matters of wisdom and knowledge.",
                    "This verse alludes to the fact that there are 310 different forms of wisdom in the world, every one of which assists those who study the Torah diligently to understand the Torah fully and fill their “storehouses of fear” by knowing how to perform [the commandments]; this is the purpose of the Torah. A proof to this [interpretation can be found] in Tractate <i>Bava Basra</i> 134a, where the Talmud describes how the Torah assisted R. Yohanan ben Zakkai in comprehending all forms of wisdom [references the same verse]. (The [alternative] explanation offered by the Rashbam<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rashbam understands the Talmud to be interpreting this verse as: “I cause those who love me to inherit 310 worlds.

Abraham is described in Isa. 41:7 as the following: “He who strikes with the anvil” (Abraham who struck the Four Kings); “[God] says of the soldering: ‘It is good.’” In other words, Abraham had unified heaven and earth by acting totally out of love for God and by enabling Divine providence to enter the world.</i> [The <i>Mishnah</i>] explains “inherit an everlasting possession” in the World to Come, and “fill their storehouses” with reward in this world. However, R. Yehoshua ben Levi [unlike the Mishnah] explains that the entire verse is discussing this world, as we have explained above.[",
                    "So did the Sages derive in Tractate <i>Tamid</i> 32b: R. Hiya taught, “Whoever is immersed in the study of Torah at night, the <i>Shechina</i>, the Divine Presence, stands before him. As it says in Scripture, “Arise, cry out with hymns at night at the beginning of the watches! Pour out your heart like water in the Presence of God! [Lift up your hands to Him for the life of your young children, who swoon with hunger at every street corner].”<sup>23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lam. 2:19.</i>",
                    "The main theme of these verses teach us that prayer will be accepted [even] after the destruction of the Temple, and the Eulogizer [Jeremiah] is telling us that in these times when you wish “to lift up your hands for the sake of your young children who swoon from hunger,” you should rise to cry out at night and then the Divine Presence will be standing before you ─ He, may His name be blessed, will be close to you and your prayers will be accepted. Simply understood, the verse implies that when one rises to cry out with hymns and praises he obtains love that bonds him with the Holy One, blessed be He. However, the [sages] of blessed memory explained it to be referring to the singing of the Torah; [Torah study] is considered as hymn and praise, for it enables prayer to become more readily accepted. This topic is quite involved and is well-explained in my aforementioned compilation, [<i>Rinah shel Torah</i>], where it was appropriate to discuss this matter at length. My purpose here is only to address the difficulty I raised in chapter 2, i.e., why [the sages who placed themselves in dangerous situations are considered] to have acted properly and became even wiser in the study of Torah. Not only did they avoid harm, but the opposite occurred – they rose to the greatest heights. The reason for this is that the study and analysis of Torah for its own sake brings one to a state of having a powerful spiritual love, which is incomprehensible to one’s natural faculties, as it nullifies one’s focus on his physical being and propels him above any matter of nature.",

Thus it naturally follows that the Torah “toils for him,” and there is no impediment to his achieving greatness.",
                    "It is proper for Koheles to warn those who investigate nature with their human intellect and mind [to refrain from risking the loss of their mental health or life]. Truly, one who studies [Torah] not for its own sake, and has not reached this level [of nullifying the sense of his physical self], is deserving of the two warnings: “why become demented” and not “to be overly wise” than the intelligence he has been allotted. This has been stated in the <i>midrash</i> that we cited at the beginning of our discussion [of this topic]."

                    "<b><small>THE DIFFICULTIES IN UNDERSTANDING RAVA’S STATEMENTS THAT THE TORAH CAN BE A DEADLY POISON</small></b><br>BASED ON WHAT we have explained, we can now answer [a seemingly difficult statement in] Tractate <i>Yoma</i> 72b: R. Yehoshua ben Levi said:<b> “</b>What is the meaning of the verse: ‘And this is the law which Moshe <i>sam</i> (set) [before the children of Israel]?’<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 4:44.</i> If one is meritorious, it, [the Torah], becomes for him a medicine of life, if not, [it becomes] a deadly poison. That is what Rava [meant when he] said: “If he is <i>uman bah</i>, skillful in its use, it is a medicine of life unto him; [but if] he is not <i>uman bah</i>, skillful in its use, it is a deadly poison.”",
                    "We can understand the interpretation of “if one is meritorious” from what Rashi writes (on this same folio of the Talmud) [in explaining the following statement] of R. Yohanan: “The Torah writes <i>zar</i>, “alien,” which may also be read as <i>zer</i>, “crown.” If you are meritorious, the Torah becomes a crown for you; if you are not meritorious, it becomes alien to you.” Rashi explains “meritorious” to mean that he merits to study the Torah and practice the commandments for their own sake. It is therefore clear that “not being meritorious” means that if one does not study the Torah for its own sake, it becomes “foreign to him,” which Rashi explains as meaning “he forgets it.” Such a person is unlike one (as described in Part 2, chapter 13), who studies [the Torah] for its own sake, thereby becoming like a river that never ceases [to flow] – in other words, never forgetting [what he has learned].",
                    "This interpretation [of Tractate <i>Yoma</i>] is difficult to understand, since R. Joshua ben Levi would then be stating that if one studies the Torah, not for its own sake, it becomes a deadly poison to him. [This conflicts with] the well-known statement [of our Sages] of blessed memory in Tractate <i>Pesahim</i> 50b: A person should always engage in the study of Torah and the performance of the commandments even [if they are not performed] for their own sake, for [even if at first] they are not performed for their own sake, eventually they will be performed for their own sake.",
                    "One cannot argue [that there is no conflict] since the proper interpretation of <i>Yoma</i> is that [the Torah] becomes a poison only for those who during their <i>entire</i> lifetimes do not study the Torah for its own sake. This cannot be because [of an additional statement by Rava]. <i>Pesahim</i> there states, “Sometimes one is zealous and is rewarded, while another is indolent and is rewarded,” etc. The Talmud there [cites a <i>Baraisa</i>] that one who is indolent and is rewarded “is one who does not work the entire week and [also] does not work on the eve of <i>Shabbos</i>.” Rashi explains that such a person is also considered to be one who performs a mitzvah not for its own sake. Rava then adds: “These women of Mehoza, even though they do not work on any day because they were pampered, since they do not work on the eve of Shabbos, they are considered as being lazy and [yet are] rewarded.”",
                    "One needs to understand what [novel concept] Rava is adding to what was already stated by the <i>Baraisa</i>. [He is pointing out] it is possible to believe that only if one has the <i>potential </i>of eventually refraining from doing work on the eve of Shabbos for its own sake, such a person receives a reward [for performing this act, even when it is not performed for its own sake]. However, if one refrains from working on the eve of Shabbos because that is his nature, [i.e., he is lazy], since he will never [perform this act for its own sake], he would not receive a reward for refraining from working on the eve of Shabbos. Rava therefore adds, even though the women of Mehoza did not work on any day because they were pampered during their childhood [and thus because of their upbringing they would never refrain from performing work on Shabbos eve for its own sake], nonetheless, they are considered as being among those who are “indolent and rewarded.” For the phrase “Even if at first they are not performed for their own sake, they will eventually be performed for their sake” means that if another person sees the women from Mehoza refraining from work on the eve of Shabbos without knowing that they doing so because of their upbringing, he will assume that they are refraining from working on the eve of Shabbos for its own sake, [and he will do the same].",
                    "(<i>Netziv’s Addendum</i> – [Evidentiary support for this interpretation can be found] in Tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i> 105b, stating: If one performs a mitzvah not for its own sake, he will merit to have a descendant who performs the commandments for their own sake.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Talmud there quoted in full is: “R. Yehuda said in the name of Rav, ‘A person should always engage in the study of Torah and the performance of the commandments even [if they are not performed] for their own sake, for when they are not performed for their own sake, eventually they will be performed for their sake.’ As a reward for the forty-two offerings that Balak offered to God [to assist Bilam in cursing Israel], he merited that Ruth should descend from him.’”</i> – End of <i>Netziv’s Addendum</i>)",
                    "Therefore, there is an apparent conflict between the <i>Yoma</i> statements by R. Yehoshua ben Levi, [that “If one is not meritorious,<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This was explained to mean “not being performed for its own sake.”</i> it becomes a deadly poison,” followed] by Rava’s [statement agreeing] that “If one does not use it skillfully, it becomes a deadly poison,” and Rava’s own [statement in <i>Pesahim</i> that even those who perform the mitzvos not for their own sake will be rewarded even if they never perform the mitzvah for their own sake during their lifetimes]. One cannot attempt to resolve this problem by arguing that [the statement of R. Yehoshua ben Levi, pertaining to study not for its own sake [refers to a contentious person]. As Rashi explains [the statement in] Tractate <i>Berachos</i> 17a: “One who performs a mitzvah not for its sake – it would be better for him not to have been created,” as referring to a contentious person [who uses his Torah knowledge as a weapon against others]. Tosafos here and in Tractate <i>Pesahim</i> offers this same explanation. See also Tractate <i>Ta’anis</i> 7a, R. Bana’a used to say: “… if one studies the Torah not for its own sake, it becomes a deadly poison to him, as the Torah states, ‘My teachings shall drop as the rain,’ (Deut. 32:2). The term used here for dropping, <i>ya’arof</i>, also denotes killing, as it states, ‘They shall break, <i>ve-arefu</i>, the heifer’s neck.’” (Deut. 21:4)",
                    "However, it is impossible to explain the Tractate <i>Yoma</i> statements in this way. First, as we noted above, the opinion of R. Yehoshua ben Levi is written in the context of R. Yochanan’s statement [in <i>Yoma</i> dealing with studying for, or not for its own sake, and therefore it is unlikely that they are speaking of contentiousness]. In addition, how can we associate one who is contentious [using Torah knowledge to harm others] with the description of “one who does not merit?” Behold, the former is a sinner and transgressor who becomes contentious by exploiting the King’s crown!<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Avos</i> 1:13: “He who exploits the crown [of Torah] shall fade away.”</i> Further, Rava states, “If he does not use it skillfully, it becomes a deadly poison.” If this is to be interpreted as “he is contentious,” why would Rava state that he “does not use it skillfully,” which implies that he is not doing anything wrong, but is simply not using it in the best manner? Behold, he is skilled in being contentious and harming others!",
                    "Certainly, it must be that the words, “he does not merit,” is referring to one who does not study the Torah for its own sake, and therefore the original questions remain: why is it that [if one does not study the Torah for its own sake], it becomes a deadly poison? Further, it is Rava himself who stated in Tractate <i>Pesahim</i> that one receives a reward even when not studying the Torah or performing a <i>mitzvah</i> for its sake,<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Pesahim</i> 50b states that Rava accords with R. Yehuda, who said, “A man should always occupy himself with Torah and good deeds even if it is not for their own sake, since doing good out of an ulterior motive leads to doing good for its own sake.”</i> and yet he states in <i>Yoma</i> that if one does not merit, i.e., he does not study the Torah for its own sake ─ it becomes a deadly poison to him.",
                    "I have a further question based on what is stated in Tractate <i>Shabbos</i> 88b: R. Hananel ben Papa said: “What is meant by, ‘Hear, for I will speak princely things;’<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Prov. 8:6.</i> why are the words of the Torah compared to a prince? [It is] to tell you that just as a prince has the power of life and death, so do the words of the Torah have [the potentialities] of life and death.” Thus Rava said: “To those who go to the right hand [of the Torah], it is a medicine of life; to those who go to the left hand thereof, it is a deadly poison.”<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The meaning of “right” and “left” is explained in the next two paragraphs.</i>",
                    "Furthermore, see what is stated in the same Tractate [<i>Shabbos</i>] 61a:<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I found it at 63a.</i> Rava ben R. Shila said, while others say R. Yoseph ben Hama said in the name of R. Sheshes: “What is meant by the verse, ‘Length of days is in her right hand, in her left hand are riches and honor’?<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Prov. 3:16.</i> Is there in her right hand length of days only, but not riches and honor? Rather [the proper interpretation is] those who go to the right hand there is length of days, and certainly riches and honor, whereas for those who go to the left hand there are riches and honor, but not length of days.” Rashi explains that the left hand, as the weaker one, is descriptive of those who do not study the Torah as deeply as required, or they do not study the Torah for its own sake. One can ask regarding R. Hananel ben Papa: why does he explain that for those who go to the left hand [of the Torah] it is a deadly poison; yet we see that there are riches and honor for those who go to the left hand as well?",
                    "One may suggest that in those areas of Torah that one merited to acquire because of one’s natural abilities, such a person fulfills the commandment of studying the Torah, even if he does not study it for its own sake. However, if a person studies areas of the Torah that are beyond his natural abilities, it is good to say that if he merits to study the Torah for its own sake, the Torah assists him to comprehend it, even though it was not originally within his ken. This is the meaning of [Rava in <i>Shabbos</i> 88a that the Torah] becomes a medicine of life for him. Yet if he strives to understand those areas of the Torah that are beyond his natural abilities, and he does not study the Torah for its own sake, it then becomes a deadly poison to him. [Therefore, when Tractate <i>Shabbos</i> 63a states that there are riches and honor for the one who does not study the Torah for its own sake, it is speaking of those areas that are understandable to him with his inborn abilities]. This would appear to be the proper interpretation.",
                    "However, this interpretation is not apt, for why would [R. Yehoshua’s and Rava’s statements] be limited to Torah study when any matter of wisdom that a person strives to comprehend beyond his natural ability involves danger?<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is cited in chapter 2 of this section.</i> Why would Scripture state, “This is the Torah,”<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 4:44.</i> meaning that it is unique to the Torah? [Also Proverbs] states: “Hear, for I will speak princely things,” from which the Sages in Tractate <i>Shabbos</i> [inferred that the words of Torah have the potentialities of life and death], which also makes it clear that this statement is limited to the Torah. [Therefore, the statements cannot be speaking of one studying the Torah not for its own sake in a way that exceeds his natural abilities, otherwise these statements should have been expanded to studying the other areas of knowledge not for their own sake as well].",
                    "This matter can be understood by carefully re-examining the wording of the above-mentioned Tractate <i>Yoma,</i> which infers [that the words of Torah can be either an elixir of life or a deadly poison] from the verse, “This is the law which Moshe set [before the children of Israel].” Why is this derived from the words “which Moshe set?” Granted, the <i>Mechilta,</i> on the Torah portion of <i>Be-shalah,</i> infers from these words that the Torah is associated with [Moshe’s] name. Nevertheless, since the inference that the Torah is like an elixir [of life or death] is only alluded to by a verse linking the Torah to Moshe, a reason for this exegesis is necessary. [A further difficulty] is how the prophet Malachi warns [Israel to keep] the Torah: “Be mindful of the teaching of My servant Moshe, whom I charged at Horeb with laws and rules for all Israel.”<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mal. 3:22.</i> It is difficult to understand why there is a need for this extra phrase and description “Whom I charged at Horeb,” etc.<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Malachi should have simply stated, “Be mindful of the teaching of my servant Moshe.”</i>",
                    "However, this can be explained by what is stated in Tractate <i>Nedarim</i> 38a: R. Yosi ben R. Hanina said: “The Torah was given only to Moshe and his seed, for it is written, ‘Write for yourself these words’<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ex. 34:27.</i> [and] ‘Carve for yourself’:<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ex. 34:1.</i> just as the carvings [of the Tablets] are yours, so is the writing yours. But Moshe generously gave it to Israel, and concerning him it is said, ‘He who possesses a bountiful eye shall be blessed, etc.’”<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Prov. 22:9.</i> R. Hisda objected, “[The Torah states]: ‘God commanded me at that time to teach you <i>hukim</i> [statutes] and <i>mishpatim</i> [judgments]?’”<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 4:14. This proves that it was not given to Moshe for himself.</i> [R. Yosi answered], “[It should be translated as], ‘He commanded me, and I [passed it on] to you.’”<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the answer, which interprets the verse as: “And God commanded me at that time [and I determined] to teach you,” etc.</i> “[There is a further objection, as the Torah states]: ‘Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the Lord my God commanded me?’”<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 4:5.</i> [R. Yosi answered], “He commanded me, and I then taught you.” “[Another objection is that Scripture states]: ‘Now, therefore, write this song for you!’”<sup>20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 31:19. “For you” implies that it was given to the Israelites in the first place.</i> [R. Yosi answered], “This refers only to the song<sup>21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to <i>Ha’azinu</i>, Deut. 32:1–43.</i> [whereas the rest of the Torah had been given to Moshe alone].” “[But does not “song” refer to the entire Torah, as Scripture states]: ‘This song shall be a witness against the children of Israel’?”<sup>22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 31:19. If the reference is to the song alone, how can that testify against Israel?</i> “Only <i>pilpul be-alma</i> [the pilpul method] [was given to Moshe alone, and he later taught it to the people].”",
                    "The Rosh explains that pilpul refers to the understanding and sharpness of reasoning. That is what is meant by [the phrase], “The writing is yours,” for all wisdom and reasoning are hinted at in the writing of the Torah by the forms of the letters. (<i>The Netziv’s addendum</i> – One must say that “forms of the letters,” refers to how the letters are combined, [such as] when words are written <i>haser</i> [with missing letters], or <i>malei</i> [with all of the letters], or when an unusual use [of a word or letter is employed]<sup>23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv appears to be arguing that since <i>pilpul be-alma</i> would be translated as “the general pilpul method,” “forms of letters” must refer to how the Thirteen Hermeneutical Principles can be applied by analyzing how letters and words are combined in various forms. The Rosh would be employing similar language as used in Tractate <i>Kiddushin</i> 49a, where “as it is formed” refers to how the words in a verse are written.</i> – <i>end of Netziv’s addendum</i>).",
                    "The <i>Mefaresh</i> to <i>Nedarim</i> writes, “The ability to infer one matter from another, [was given to Moshe, and he treated it with generosity by giving it to Israel].” We will expand on the significance of this later.<sup>24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See chapter 8 of this section.</i> We learn from this that the pilpul method, i.e., deriving Halachah by meticulous exegesis of Scripture, and by application of the thirteen hermeneutical principles with which the Written Law may be expounded, was given to Moshe alone. All of Israel was limited to the halachic decision process by applying the Halachah that Moshe received at Mount Sinai pertaining to every <i>parasha</i> and mitzvah of the Torah. Where no tradition was received, the Halachah was to be derived by using logic in comparing one matter to another, as it states in Tractate <i>Bava Basra</i> 130b, “In the entire [domain of] the Torah comparisons are made.” This is the main halachic decision method found in Israel. We previously explained in Part 1, chapter 4, how this method is written [in Scripture] pertaining to the “rebellious scholar.” Scripture first states: “You must approach the scholarly priests and the <i>shofet</i> who are alive at that time,”<sup>25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 17:9.</i> and then states [a few verses later], “If any man [who is ordained and sits on the Great Sanhedrin]<sup>26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 87a.</i> should rebel and refuse to listen to the <i>Kohen</i> who is in charge of serving the Lord your God there, or to the <i>shofet</i> [judge]….”<sup>27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 17:12.</i> These verses are difficult to comprehend, for what does the <i>Kohen</i> “who is in charge of serving God” have to do with addressing uncertainties in Halachah, which can be resolved by [one who possesses] exceptional wisdom, such as the Head of the Sanhedrin, i.e., the <i>shofet?</i>",
                    "However, there are two types of extraordinary [judges]. One type [addresses] doubts pertaining to areas of <i>pilpul</i> [deep analysis], and these types of issues are asked of the <i>shofet</i>, i.e., the Head of the Sanhedrin. The second type [of judge addresses] questions that involve comparative logic, and in this area the [greatest] power of adjudication was given to Aharon, as it states, “[You, Aharon,<sup>28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Or any other High Priest.</i> will also be able] to render decisions for the Israelites in all the laws that God has taught you through Moshe.”<sup>29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lev. 10:11.</i> It is impossible to rely on the <i>pilpul</i> method for the more common forms of adjudication, because that requires argumentation and deliberation;<sup>30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It would be impossible to set aside the amount of time needed to address the numerous halachic questions.</i> this method relies instead on sound logic.",
                    "<small><b>Translator’s note:</b> For the next several pages, the Netziv will be proving that when the Torah describes the High Priest as having the “crown of anointing oil,” it is stating that the High Priest was foremost in rendering on-the-spot halachic decisions. His analysis pertains to the two ways the High Priest assumed office:<br>• By being anointed with the oil of anointment.<br>• By donning the vestments of his office. This High Priest is called merubeh bi-vegadim, literally translated (as the priest distinguished by) a “larger number of [official] garments.” During the Second Temple era, when no anointing took place, the High Priest assumed office in this manner.</small><br>Following Aharon, every High Priest was greatest and foremost in deciding Halachah by applying the known traditions he amassed and by using comparative logic. With this [concept] we can understand what is written in the Torah portion of <i>Emor</i>, “The Priest who is greatest among his brethren, upon whose head was poured the anointing oil…. He shall not leave the Sanctuary and he shall not profane his God’s Sanctuary,<sup>31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The High Priest, who is forbidden to assist in the activities related to the burial of a relative, may not even follow the funeral procession.</i> for the crown of his God’s anointing oil is upon him,” etc.<sup>32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lev. 21:10–12.</i> The usage of “crown” in “the crown of his God’s anointing oil,” is unclear. In addition, it is known that the High Priest who assumed office by donning the special vestments performed his duties while being an <i>onen</i>, [a mourner before the burial of a close relative]. This is difficult because the verse explicitly states, “For the crown of his God’s <i>anointing oil </i>is upon him,” which implies that only the High Priest who assumed office with the oil of anointing [was prohibited from leaving the Sanctuary] – not the High Priest who assumed office by donning the special vestments. Rashi in Tractate <i>Horayos</i> 12b, s.v. <i>Talmud Lomar</i>, states: “The High Priest serves while he is an <i>onen</i> regardless if he assumed his office with the oil of anointment or by donning the special vestments… for [these two types of High Priest] are included within the category of a High Priest….”",
                    "I find this problematic because of the [source of the] prohibition against the High Priest marrying a widow [demonstrates that the various types of High Priest cannot be inferred from one another]:<sup>33</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Horayos</i> 12b.</i> “The priest who is highest among his brethren,”<sup>34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lev. 21:10.</i> refers to the High Priest; “Upon whose head the anointing oil is poured”<sup>35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Id.</i> refers to the priest who is anointed for war; “Who is consecrated to put on the garments”<sup>36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Id.</i> refers to the High Priest who is dedicated by the additional garments alone.",
                    "We therefore see that if the Torah did not state explicitly the law pertaining to the priest appointed to wear the special vestments, [the prohibition against his marrying a widow] would not be inferred from the priest who had been anointed with the oil of office. Therefore, how is it known that the one appointed to wear the special vestments is included in the requirement for a High Priest to perform his duties while he is an <i>onen</i>?",
                    "The source is from the <i>Toras Kohanim</i><sup>37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Parashas Emor, perek 1, Parasha 2.</i> where it states: We only know that a Priest who is appointed with the oil of anointment [is to serve when he is an <i>onen</i>]; from where is it known that this same rule applies to the one appointed by the special vestments? The Torah therefore states, “For the anointing oil of God is [upon you].”<sup>38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lev. 10:7.</i> Although this [text] is unclear, the holy one, Eliyahu,<sup>39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He is referring to the Vilna Gaon’s editions to the <i>Toras Kohanim</i>.</i> correctly edits [this <i>Toras Kohanim</i>] by [including a different verse], “For the crown of his God’s anointing oil is upon him.”<sup>40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lev. 21:12.</i> However, this exegesis remains unclear, [for how can the words pertaining to anointing oil teach us that even the one appointed by the special vestments may perform the service even while he is an <i>onen</i>]?",
                    "It appears that this <i>Toras Kohanim</i> can be explained by the previously cited Tractate <i>Yoma</i>: “The Torah writes <i>zar</i>, “alien,” which may also be read as <i>zer</i>, “crown.” If you are meritorious, the Torah becomes for you a crown, if you are not meritorious, it becomes alien to you.” Z<i>er</i> refers to the crown on the Ark that resided in the Holy of Holies, for it was from there that the power of halachic decision-making emanated, enabling one to attain the truth through comparative reasoning.<sup>41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This methodology is unlike the forceful logic of pilpul, requiring deep analysis. It is discussed in Part 1.</i> It is pertaining to this that [<i>Yoma</i>] inferred that if one does not merit [to receive the crown of halachic decision-making], the traditions will be forgotten by him. It is for this reason that “crown” was written such that it may be read in two different ways: [<i>zer</i>, “crown” and <i>zar</i>, “foreign”]. However, pertaining to the High Priest, who most certainly merited to [obtain the crown of <i>halachic</i> decision making], Scripture clearly states, “For the <i>zer</i> [crown] of his God’s anointing oil is upon him.” [“Crown”] teaches us that even if he does not have God’s anointing oil upon him, [i.e., he is appointed by the special vestments], nevertheless the crown [of the Ark] is upon him, i.e., [Divine assistance] for halachic decision making.<sup>42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus any <i>kohen gadol</i> who was an <i>onen</i> was not allowed to be involved with a close relative’s funeral.</i>",
                    "The power of halachic decision existed in the Tent of Meeting, for it was from there that the teaching of the law emanated for Israel. It states in the <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> pertaining to the verse in Song of Songs: “‘To the chamber of her – <i>horasi</i> – who conceived me,’<sup>43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Song of Songs 3:4.

                    "However, to know the pilpul method, enabling one to comprehend deeply how the traditions are all alluded to in the Torah, and how to [use this comprehension] to derive laws that are not addressed by tradition (as we have written in Part 1, chapters 6 and 7) initially – these were provided only to Moshe and his descendants. When our teacher Moshe arrived at the plains of Moab, he taught [this methodology] to all of Israel, and this is why Moshe taught the Torah a third time on the plains of Moab.<sup>45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See how the Netziv expands on this matter in <i>Ha’amek Davar</i> and <i>Harhev Davar</i> on Deut. 1:3. See <i>Sotah</i> 37b and <i>Hagigah</i> 6b, where R. Akiva states: “Both general and particular laws were proclaimed at Sinai, repeated in the Tent of Meeting, and for the third time in the plains of Moab.”</i> Moshe did not merely review with them what he had previously taught, for why would the Torah specify only “the plains of Moab?” He [continued] to study and teach as much as possible, throughout the entire forty years that they traveled in the wilderness. Rather, the third time Moshe taught them the Torah, he taught them a new methodology, which is pilpul and inference from Scripture. This [idea] is clearly stated in the <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> on <i>Shemos</i> 40, [Scripture states]: “Then did He see it, and declare it; He established it and <i>hikerah</i>, searched it out.”<sup>46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 28:27.</i> [This teaches us], “Then did he see it and declare it” at Sinai, [then] “he established it” in the Tent of Meeting, [and he] “<i>hikerah</i>, searched it out” in the plains of Moab.”",

As it states in Psalms 106:26, “Then He lifted up His hand [in an oath] against them, to throw them down in the wilderness.” In addition, the Prophet Ezekiel, in 20:23 stated, “I also lifted up My hand [in an oath] that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them throughout the lands.”",
                    "[Addendum 1 to Chapter 7]<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Addendum 1 to Chapter 7, the Netziv will be explaining the reason for Israel’s exile.</i><br><small><b>Translator’s note:</b> In this addendum, the Netziv explains the reason for Israel’s exile.</small><br>ALTHOUGH THIS DECREE [of exile] is not stated explicitly in the Torah, it is alluded to [by how God decreed during the incident of the spies that they would not enter Israel]: “But as I live and the glory of God shall fill the entire world.”<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Num. 14:21.</i> The commentaries<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Rashi, Ibn Ezra and Nahmanides on this verse.</i> say that this statement is an oath [of punishment to be read as], “Just as I [God] live and the glory of God fills the entire world; all the men who have seen My glory and My signs… will not see the Land that I have sworn to give their forefathers,” etc. However, we explained in <i>She’ilta</i> 30:7 that this is not an oath [of punishment]. Rather, it is a rationale as to why they were not forgiven completely as they should have been, since Moshe entreated God by invoking the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy. See there [what we wrote].<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When Moshe entreated God for the Jews to be forgiven, he employed two arguments: 1) if God were to destroy the Israelites, He would lessen His own glory, since the nations of the world would say: “It was only because God lacked the ability to bring this people to the land that He had promised them that He slew them in the wilderness.” 2. That the “strength of God be magnified” – in other words, the Divine attribute of slowness to anger should prevail over that of strict justice. Moshe then pleaded using the Thirteen Attributes. God then replied: “I have forgiven [them] because of your statements” – your argument that My glory will be diminished if I destroy them. God stated that even though they had profaned His name, “the Glory of God shall fill the entire world” and I will not destroy them. However, they cannot be completely forgiven even though you mentioned the Thirteen Attributes in your plea. This generation shall die off in the wilderness and not enter the Land of Israel because it profaned God’s Name, since those who profane God’s name cannot be completely forgiven until they die.</i>",
                    "In addition, [God is explaining to the generation that left Egypt why] it was [also] decreed that the future generations were to be dispersed among the different lands. For it is known that if it were not for the fact that Israel was exiled and scattered among the various lands of the Diaspora, the glory of God would have never been revealed to the nations of the world;<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv elaborates on this explanation in <i>Harhev Davar</i>. When the Jews sinned during the Incident of the Spies, they refrained from becoming a nation residing in the Land of Israel in a manner that would transcend nature. Had they become such a nation, it would have been clear to the entire world that God is involved in the workings of the world. However, since the Jews rejected that plan, choosing instead to receive Divine Providence in accordance with nature, they could not be a nation that would reveal God’s glory by remaining in Israel. Therefore, in time they had to be exiled among the nations.</i> the ancient ones of the nations of the world were idolaters and did not know God. This remained so until Israel arrived and was intermixed among the various nations and the Name of God and His glory were thus revealed from “the rising of the sun to its setting.”<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 50:1, Malachi 1:11 and others.</i>",
                    "The meaning of the word <i>ani</i> (I), as used in Scripture, is referring to the fulfillment [of the potential] and purpose of the speaker. For the <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> on the <i>Mi-ketz</i><sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Parashah 90.</i> states: From the <i>ani</i> of flesh and blood, we learn how to interpret the <i>ani</i> when it is used by the Holy One, blessed be He. For when Pharaoh said to Joseph, “<i>Ani</i> – I – am Pharaoh. Without your command, no man will lift a hand or foot in all of Egypt,”<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gen. 40:44.</i> the words “<i>Ani</i> – I am Pharaoh,” express he is one possessing complete power and might, and it is due to his possessing that complete power that he is able to assign great authority to Joseph. Therefore, when God states, “But now see! It is <i>ani</i> [I], <i>ani</i> [I] am the One,” etc.,<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 32:39.</i> a fortiori, even more so that it is with God. [God] is stating, “I am the One through Whom the entire purpose of Creation is to be manifest for [the sake of] My glory, and I shall reveal My glory throughout the land.”",
                    "It is [because of this interpretation of “<i>ani</i>”] that our sages<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, R. Meir.</i> of blessed memory expounded [in a mishnah] in the fifth chapter of Tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i>:<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">46a.</i> “When a man of Israel<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Our text does not include the word Israel.</i> suffers [for his sins], what expression does the <i>Shechinah</i>, the Divine Presence, use? – <i>‘Kalani</i> – I am lighter than My head, I am lighter than My arm.’”<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 21:23 when describing the prohibition against allowing the corpse of a condemned man to remain on the gallows past nightfall, states: “<i>Ki kelilas Elohim talui</i>” (a hanging person is a curse of God).</i> In the Jerusalem Talmud<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tractate Sanhedrin 6:8. To quote in full: “We read ‘<i>kalelani</i>,<i>’</i> while others read ‘<i>kal ani.</i>’ Those who read <i>‘kaleni’</i> [the interpretation is]: He [God] is a burden. Those who read <i>‘kal ani’</i> [the interpretation is] <i>ani</i> are light [not taken seriously].”</i> this [Mishnah] is explained further: “What is meant by ‘<i>kalani</i>’? The <i>ani</i> is not light” [i.e., the <i>ani</i> is a burden]. The interpretation of this [Jerusalem Talmud] is, that the <i>ani,</i> so to speak, is being diminished through the weakening of the glory of Heaven and His will, may He be blessed.<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Based on what the Netziv writes in <i>Birkas ha-Netziv</i>, <i>Mishpatim</i>, <i>Parasha</i> 19, it appears that he understands both opinions in the Jerusalem Talmud to interpret R. Meir’s statement to mean the diminution of the Divine Presence. One opinion is that <i>kalani</i> is a compound of <i>kal ani</i>, which means the <i>ani</i> is light, or that <i>kalani</i> is a compound of <i>kalil ani, the ani </i>is a burden. The Netziv explains both opinions to understand R. Meir stating how God bemoans the diminution of the <i>ani</i>, the manifestation of the Divine Presence in the world.</i> (It appears that this is the proper interpretation of Rava’s statement [explaining this mishnah] in the Babylonian Talmud.<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 46b.</i> “[It is like one who is saying], ‘The world is <i>kal</i> – light – to me,’” that is, the world is unworthy [to contain My glory]. This [Mishnah] is expressing that the <i>ani</i> is not [manifest as the Divine Will intended it to be from the beginning of creation].<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Rinah shel Torah</i> on Song of Songs 5:2, the Netziv writes that “My head” refers to God’s will, at the beginning of creation, that His glory be manifest in heaven and earth. He also writes that “My arm” alludes to how God’s glory is manifested in the world. The <i>Mishnah</i> states that since God’s goal and desire that His Glory be manifested in the world have been weakened by the sins of human beings, He deals with the world in a degraded manner.</i> Rashi’s interpretation is weak.)<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to Rashi, when a person expresses anguish by saying, “The world is too light for me,” he is speaking euphemistically, saying that the world is too heavy for him to bear. This is not as straightforward as the Netziv’s interpretation that obviates the need for euphemism.</i>",
                    "[With this interpretation of <i>ani</i> we can now understand the purpose of the exile]. This is the statement of the Holy One, blessed be He, at the Incident of the Spies: “But as I live,” [meaning] when does the <i>ani</i> live, i.e., reach its ultimate purpose? When “the glory of the Lord fills the entire world,” for the entire world was created to be filled with its Creator’s glory. When this purpose is fulfilled, then the <i>ani</i> “lives” [i.e., is manifest]. When Israel caused the profanation of God’s Name with the Incident of the Spies, it resulted in: “<i>Ani</i>, I, will live.” In other words, “The glory of God shall fill the entire world,” by [Israel] being scattered throughout the world. [Since Israel sinned, they could no longer publicize His glory by acting in a manner above nature while remaining in Israel. They were limited to acting in a manner in accordance with nature and were thus required to be dispersed among the nations and to make his Name known]. This was not clearly explained to Israel [at that time]. It is only later that [God] added, “You will then understand My absence,”<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Num. 14:34. I translated this as explained by Rashi. Saadia Gaon translates it as, “you will then understand My acts.”</i> meaning that there will be a time [in the future that] you will understand what I intended to accomplish by means of [the exile].",
                    "Moshe understood that with the power of traditions [alone], the Jews would not be able to formulate laws and statutes<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In chapter 8, the Netziv will offer another translation of the words <i>hukim</i> and <i>mishpatim,</i> which are translated here as “laws” and “statutes.”</i> [to compensate] for what had not been received from Sinai, or [to compensate] for what would be forgotten during the mourning period for Moshe. Even more [he was concerned] for the later generations, when Israel would be devoured by gaping mouths<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Isa. 9:11, “The Arameans on the east and the Philistines on the west – they devour Israel with open mouth.”</i> and would not be able to reach the Temple. Even during the period of the Second Temple, the power of the Temple would become diminished and the light of the Ark would be absent. [Therefore,] Moshe was forced to rise and teach [Israel] the method of pilpul, for [with pilpul] it would be able to derive any law that was not received at Sinai or to [compensate] for those laws that were received and forgotten, analogous to what we wrote<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Part 1, chapter 6.</i> pertaining to Osniel, who, through his pilpul, restored all the forgotten laws.",
                    "This is what Moshe warned [Israel] of at the beginning of Devarim: These are the words that Moshe spoke to all of Israel, on the other side of the Jordan…. Eleven days from Horeb, by way of Mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea. It was in the fortieth year… when Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel regarding everything that God had commanded him for them. After he had smitten Sihon…. On the other side of the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moshe <i>ho’il</i> began explaining this Torah, saying….<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 1:1–5.</i>",
                    "This means that before Moshe explained the Torah – in other words, taught them how the traditions are alluded to in the Torah – he had to tell them why it was necessary for him to teach [them] this method. He reprimanded them, saying [that it was necessary] because they had sinned, so it was decreed upon them that they must dwell for forty years in the wilderness. This [punishment] alluded to [their future dispersal] among the other lands, as it is written in the Torah passage of <i>Shelah</i>: “There shall be one year for each day, a total of forty years until your sin is forgiven. You will then understand My absence.”<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Num. 14:34.</i>",
                    "We previously wrote that [God] hinted to them that they would know eventually why they had received this decree [from Him]. Therefore, [since the future generations were to be dispersed], there was an absolute need to teach [Israel] all that God had directed him [Moshe, to do] – that is, the pilpul method. This is the explanation of <i>ho’il Moshe:</i> meaning that Moshe generously [taught them this method],<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Rashi on Gen. 18:27.</i> or [it can be translated as, “Moshe began”] – meaning that he began to teach them in a new way in which he had never taught them before.",
                    "This explains the order of the [following items cited in the] Torah passage [of <i>Va-es’hanan</i>]: This is the law that Moshe presented before the Children of Israel. These are the testimonies, rules and laws that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel when they left Egypt. On the bank of the Jordan, in the valley, opposite Beis-pe’or, in the land of Sichon, king of the Amorites, who dwells in Heshbon, whom Moshe and the Children of Israel smote when they went out of Egypt. They possessed his land,” etc.<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 4:44–47.</i>",
                    "According to the theme of this passage, everything [in the latter verses] appear to be extraneous, for what is the relevance of possessing the land of Sichon and its borders with the importance of keeping the Torah’s statutes? However, this matter can be explained with the <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> on <i>Hukas</i>:<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Parashah 19.</i> Why was the Torah given [to the Children of Israel] in the wilderness? For if the Torah was given in the Land of Israel, the Tribe within whose border it was given would state that it was foremost in the portion of the Torah. Therefore, the Torah was given in the wilderness so that all [would acknowledge] that they are equal [in its study].",
                    "When it was time for Moshe to teach the Children of Israel a new method [of Torah study] by using pilpul, as implied by the words “Moshe began explaining this Torah,” this teaching would be difficult to transmit on the other side of the Jordan River. This land had already been apportioned to the sons of Gad and Reuven, and there was a concern that those two tribes could claim that they had a greater share in this area of the Torah. He therefore approached this wisely, as it is clearly explained [in the above-mentioned <i>midrash</i>].",
                    "[The land “opposite Beis-pe’or was neutral land, for Israel was forbidden to dwell there], as the <i>Sifrei</i> on the Torah passage of <i>Balak</i><sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Piska</i> 1.</i> stated: “R. Elazar ben Shamua said, ‘Just as it is impossible for a nail to be dislodged from a door without [taking] the wood [with it], so it is impossible for [the Children of] Israel to separate from Peor without [losing their] souls.’” The <i>Sifrei</i> then cites a number of instances where the Temple of Pe’or would entice and seize Jewish souls, even more than other nations. [Because of this strong attraction,] Jews were forbidden to live opposite Beis-peor, as it states in Tractate <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 17a–b [it is forbidden to place oneself in a situation where one is likely to be tempted to sin]. When R. Hanina and R. Yonassan approached a fork in the road, with one path opening onto the door of a temple of idol worship, and the other path opening onto the door of a brothel, one Sage said], “Let us go on the path that opens onto the door of the temple of idol worship, for its inclination has been slaughtered”<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Men of the Great Assembly had prayed that the evil inclination for idolatry be diminished. Therefore one sage stated that they were required to pass by the temple of idol worship rather than the brothel, for the evil inclination toward the latter remained powerful.</i> – in other words, as Rashi explains, so that the evil inclination will not overcome us.<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i> 64a states in full: “R. Hanina and R. Yonassan were walking on the road and came to a fork in the road. One path led near the door of a place of idol-worship and the other led to a brothel. Said one to the other: Let us go [by the path that passes] the idolatrous place, the inclination for which has been abolished. The other, however, said: Let us go [by the path that passes] the brothel and defy our inclination, and have our reward. As they approached the place, they saw the harlots withdraw at their presence. Said the one to the other: How did you know this [would happen]? The other replied by quoting: ‘She shall watch over you <i>mi-zimmah</i> [against lewdness], and discernment shall guard you’” (Prov. 2:11). The Netziv in <i>Ha’amek Davar</i> on Deut. 9:4 says that if one is in a state of studying Torah (as these two sages were), then one can pass by such temptations. However, if one is not in this constant state of studying Torah, it is forbidden to place oneself in such a situation.</i>",
                    "Because of this [strong temptation for idolatry], the area opposite Beis-pe’or remained without [a tribe attempting] to possess it [at that time]. Even though in fact this land should have been connected to Reuven’s inheritance, as it was near the border of Nevo, [and regardless of the fact] that Moshe was buried in Beth-peor, that particular string of land that stood opposite that [area] of idol worship, which was not possessed by Reuven, remained unclaimed.",
                    "Therefore, Moshe and all of Israel arose in that particular place, and while the Jews were engrossed in the elucidation of the Torah, the Sword of Israel shielded them from the enticements of the evil urge to this idol worship. This is the explanation of the verses [in <i>Va-es’hanan</i>], “These are the testimonies, rules and laws that Moshe spoke…. On the bank of the Jordan, in the valley, opposite Beis-peor,” etc. In other words, the reason that they stood in that dangerous area is [that since] they [already] possessed all of the land of Sihon, inclusive of all that was within that border, [Moshe] was unable to give over to them this portion of the Torah and [this methodology] of study in a place that had already been possessed, [without it being viewed as being partial to Reuven or Gad]. Therefore, they stood on unowned land.<br><b>Translator’s summary:</b> Moshe taught the pilpul method opposite Beis-pe’or for two reasons. First, it was neutral land, and it was demonstrated that all of Israel have a share in the pilpul method. Second, they learned how the pilpul method protects them from falling prey to even the most powerful form of idol worship.",
                    "[Addendum 2 to Chapter 7]<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Addendum 2 to Chapter 7, the Netziv will prove that pilpul enabled Gad to inhabit the land opposite Beis-pe’or.</i><br>[IN THIS ADDENDUM, the Netziv will be proving that pilpul enabled Gad to inhabit the land opposite Beis pe’or].<br>With the above explanation, we can now explain Moshe’s blessing of Gad: Blessed is He Who broadens Gad; he dwells like a lion, tearing off arm and even head. He sees the foremost portion, for that is where the lawgiver’s plot is hidden; and he came with the heads of the nation, doing what is just with God and His ordinances with Israel.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 33:20, 21. The translation of verse 21 is based on what the Netziv writes in <i>Harhev Davar</i> and later in this chapter.</i>",
                    "According to the simple understanding, all [the words in] these [verses] are speaking of the tribe of Gad, however, it is unclear what is meant by the words, “He came with the heads of the nation, doing what is just with God,” etc. It seems that the meaning of the phrase “broadens Gad” is not that his portion was more expansive than the rest of the tribes, as it appears that half of the tribe of Menasheh received a larger amount of land. In fact, anything that was to be linked to [Gad’s] possession should not be referred to as “broadened,” for everything it received was within its allotted share; “broadens Gad” means that it took more than its allotted share. It is stated in the <i>Sifrei</i> on the Torah passage of <i>Ve-zos ha-beracha</i><sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Piska</i> 16.</i> that Moshe had died within the inheritance of Reuven on Mount Nevo and that he was buried in the valley that was tied to the inheritance of the tribe of Gad, as it states: “for that is where the lawgiver’s plot is hidden.” This [statement] is unclear, for how could they divide the land in such a precise manner that they could draw a marker through a mountain and valley [so that Moshe’s grave would be in the land of] two different tribes? Is it not clear that [Nevo] is not defined as being within the borders of Gad [but Reuven’s<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Reuven built up Nevo, as stated in Num. 32:38.</i>], and if this is so, how [can this area also] be considered as Gad’s?",
                    "However, this is the proper interpretation. The strip of land [including Mt. Nevo] that stands opposite Beis-peor was not taken as a possession by the sons of Reuven due to the fear of idol worship. When Moshe died, the sons of Gad came and possessed it and their possession was thus expanded.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus when the <i>Sifrei</i> stated that the valley and mountain were possessed by both Gad and Reuven, it is not stating that it was divided between the tribes, but at first it was to be Reuven’s, as it was located near its border, but later it was possessed by Gad. It appears that the Netziv differentiates between Nevo and Mt. Nevo. While the tribe of Reuven possessed and built up Nevo, it did not possess the strip of land before Beis Peor, which included Mt. Nevo.</i> They did not fear [the sin] of idol worship, and this is the interpretation of the words, “he dwells like a lion without fear, tearing off arm and even head.” As it states in the <i>Midrash</i>,<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer</i>, towards the end of chapter 45 and <i>Yalkut Shimoni,</i> towards the end of <i>remez</i> 965.</i> which is also cited by Tosafos in Tractate <i>Sotah</i> 45,<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is really 14a as cited in <i>Harhev Davar,</i> Deut. 33:21. There is a variation between the <i>midrash</i> referenced in n. 5 and what is cited by Tosafsos. The <i>Yalkut</i> and <i>Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer</i> state that it was anger – in other words, punishment – resulting from the idol-worship that is diminished. It appears that the Netziv is stating that the intent of these midrashic statements, and the midrash cited by Tosafos is the same. That is, the punishment that may result from the Jews’ sins lowers itself (is diminished), since Moshe’s grave weakens the influence of idol-worship.</i> when idolatry raises its head [in that area] and views the grave of Moshe, it lowers itself. This is what the verse states: “He sees the foremost portion, for that is where the lawgiver’s plot is hidden.” The foremost reason for Gad’s confidence [that it would be protected from the sin of idolatry], was that Moshe was buried there. The verse adds, “He came with the first of the nation” [that is, he came with the foremost of the nation], for he brought there the heads of the nation, i.e., sages engrossed in the study of Torah, [and this provided additional protection]. By doing so, [the tribe of Gad was involved in] “doing what is just with God,” as it made this place habitable for Israel, since it is known that there is a <i>mitzvah</i> to settle the land of Israel.<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Deut. 12:29, “When the Lord your God cuts down the nations where you come to drive them away, and you drive them away and settle in their land.” The <i>Sifrei </i>on the verse states, “The settling of the Land of Israel is equal in weight to the observance of all the mitzvos of the Torah.” According to both the Rambam and Nahmanides, this is a positive commandment, since it occurred during the time of Joshua. See discussion of this mitzvah in the <i>Megillas Esther le-Tosafos ha-Ramban</i>, <i>mitzvas aseh</i> 4.</i> By increasing the number of scholars [and deep analysis], “His ordinances with Israel” were increased [through the insights provided by these scholars of Gad]."

                    "<b><small>BY RESOLVING THE APPARENT CONFLICT IN RAVA’S STATEMENTS, WE UNDERSTAND HOW THE MISAPPLICATION OF PILPUL CONTRIBUTES TO THE WORLD’S DESTRUCTION</small></b><br><b>Translator’s note:</b> Here the Netziv asserts that pilpul is an elixir of life, a method of Torah study that God directed the Jewish nation to employ in order to guarantee its survival in the various exiles. However, if this precious tool of pilpul is misapplied, it becomes an elixir of death. The Netziv’s proofs depend on the meaning of three words ─ hukim, mishpatim and la’asos. The word hukim is generally interpreted as counter-intuitive laws,<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">E.g., the eating of pork and not wearing garments composed of wool and linen.</i> whereas the word mishpatim refers to the laws that have a discernible rationale,<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Tractate <i>Yoma</i> 67b, as quoted by Rashi to Lev. 18:4.</i> or laws that regulate conduct between persons – e.g., torts, contracts, etc.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Tractate <i>Bava Kamma</i> 87.</i> The word la’asos is usually translated as either to make or to perform. Both here, and in many places in his commentary on the Torah,<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the Netziv’s Introduction to <i>Ha’amek Davar</i>, and what he writes in <i>Ha’amek Davar</i> and <i>Harhev Davar</i> on Lev. 18:5, Ex. 24:3, 4, and Deut. 6:1.</i> the Netziv argues that the translations of these terms vary according to context. With regard to the word hukim, he concludes that it may also mean analysis or analytical rules, such as the thirteen hermeneutical principles of R. Yishmael. Similarly, the word mishpatim can also mean practical laws, or, alternatively, the application of analysis, namely, the methodology as to how to apply hukim so that it results in the derivation of practical laws,<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Ha’amek Davar</i> on Ex. 15:23.</i> such as the ones in the Shulhan Aruch.<br>The word la’asos and its various conjugations may be translated as ‘to perform’ or ‘to create,’ depending on the context. The Netziv asserts that if la’asos is translated in various statements as “create” or “enhance,”<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the Netziv in his Introduction to <i>Ha’amek Davar</i>, <i>os</i> 8, arguing that the word <i>la’asos</i>, depending on the context, may be translated as “to make,” “to enhance” or “to arrange” something that already exists.</i> the difficulties discussed in chapter 6 pertaining to the interpretation of various Talmudic statements and the contradictions between the various statements of Rava are resolved by limiting the word to the application of analysis and pilpul to generate new laws.<br>WE EXPLAINED in Part 1, chapters 7 and 8, that with the destruction [of the Temples] and the beginning of the exile, Isaiah [at the end of the First Temple period], and afterwards, the Men of the Great Assembly [led by Ezra during the Second Temple period], resolved to enhance the Torah and [use of] pilpul among Israel. This was the message of Malachi: [“Be mindful of the teaching of My servant Moshe, whom I charged at Horeb with <i>hukim</i>, laws, and <i>mishpatim</i>, rules, for Israel”].<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mal. 3:22.</i> Malachi, [who is actually] Ezra,<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezra understood that the purpose of the Jews returning to Israel and rebuilding the Temple was to prepare the Jewish nation for the approaching lengthy exile. See <i>Ha’amek Davar</i> on Deut. 32:36.</i> as stated in Tractate <i>Megillah</i> 15a,<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Tractate <i>Megillah</i> there is a disagreement between the sages who were of the opinion that Malachi and Ezra were two separate prophets, and R. Yehoshua ben Korhah, who stated that they were the same person. The Talmud concludes in accordance with R. Yehoshua.</i> [is referred to as] a <i>sofer</i>, “enumerator,” of the Torah of Moshe,<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ezra 7:6, “Ezra came up from Babylon, a <i>sofer</i> [scribe] expert in the Torah of Moshe.” See Targum, Ibn Ezra and Gersonides that <i>sofer</i> in this context means that Ezra enumerated and explained the details and sources of the laws contained within the Torah.</i> for he counted the letters of the Torah and applied exegesis to them. It is written in Ezra 7:11 that “He counted<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The present tense in Hebrew is a participle and serves both as a verb and noun, therefore, <i>sofer</i> may also be translated as “enumerates.”</i> the <i>words </i>of the commandments of God and his<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the next paragraph the Netziv, will define the phrase “his statutes” as referring to Ezra, not God.</i> statutes that [were commanded] to Israel.” Had the text stated, “He counted God’s <i>commandments,</i>” I would say that Ezra had counted the commandments, [which is in itself] a great wisdom, [as explained in Part 2]. However, the language used is, “He counted the <i>words </i>of the commandments,” implying that he counted the details of each and every mitzvah.",
                    "[We see elsewhere that the word <i>sofer</i> is defined as one who enumerates the details of the mitzvos]. As the Talmud explains [regarding the colleagues of Ya’abetz], “families of <i>soferim</i>, enumerators”<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Chron. 2:55.</i> [refers to the grouping or counting of the details of the various commandments]. See this interpretation in chapter 5 of the Jerusalem Talmud [in Tractate <i>Shekalim</i>].<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">[Regarding I Chron. 2:55, the Gemara asks], “Why [are the colleagues of Osniel] referred to as <i>soferim</i> (enumerators)? Because they [grouped all the laws relating to specific topics, which] they then numbered [according to category]. This was explained in detail in Part 2, chapter 8.</i> [Based on what is said in Ezra and the way a <i>sofer</i> is defined in Tractate <i>Shekalim</i>], we infer that Ezra was a “master of collections,” i.e., one who enumerated the details of the mitzvos. It also states in the Book of Ezra that “<i>hukav</i>, his statutes, which [were commanded] to Israel,” were originated by Ezra. [The term] <i>hukav</i>, <i>his</i> statutes, refers to Ezra [and not to God], meaning that he investigated [the Torah] deeply [from the word <i>mehokek</i>] and thus originated new laws, teaching Israel how to do the same. [We thus see that during the First and Second Temple periods, the leaders of Israel, mindful of the impending exiles, instructed Israel in the method of pilpul].",
                    "(<i>Netziv’s addendum</i> – [As a support for my interpretation of the word <i>hukav</i> as used in Malachi, see] the <i>Mechilta</i> on the Torah section of <i>Beshalah</i>:<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Section of <i>Mechilta</i> entitled <i>Vayisa</i>, <i>Parashah</i> 1.</i> “‘You shall keep all <i>hukav</i>, his statutes’<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ex. 15:26.</i> – these are the halachos, the laws.” In other words, [these are the practical laws] that are derived through deep examination and <i>hakikas</i>, analysis of the mind.<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Mechilta</i> is stating that <i>hukav</i> should be translated as “<i>his</i> statues” rather than “His statues,” since it refers to the scholar, not to God. The practical laws are derived from the <i>hukim</i>, which the Netziv believes are the thirteen hermeneutical rules that in turn are formulated through deep analysis.</i> – <i>end of Netziv’s addendum</i>)",
                    "As I explained above pertaining to Tractate <i>Nedarim,</i><sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">38a.</i> [the way to derive new laws] was mainly by application of pilpul to the Torah. The prophet Malachi warned Israel: “Be mindful of the Teaching of My servant Moshe, whom I charged at Horeb with <i>hukim,</i> laws, and <i>mishpatim,</i> rules, for all of Israel.”<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mal. 3:22.</i> “Mindful of the [Teaching of My servant Moshe],” refers to the portion of the Torah that was given only to Moshe at Horeb, [i.e., the pilpul method]. Today it is incumbent upon all of Israel to use the pilpul system, and this is what is meant by linking <i>hukim</i> together with <i>mishpatim</i>. That is, it should not be a pilpul of vapor without a goal, but rather a method to comprehend the <i>hukim</i> and <i>mishpatim</i> [i.e., a practical result]. This is the wording of the Torah: “See, I have taught you <i>hukim</i> and <i>mishpatim</i>,” meaning, I [Moshe], have been directed to teach you statues and rules. Tractate <i>Nedarim</i> understands this verse as, “I have been commanded [in this method], and I am now teaching it to you. This is referring to <i>pilpul be-alma,</i> [i.e., deriving laws by analyzing the nuances of the letters and words in the Torah].<sup>20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 6.</i> <i>Hukim</i> and <i>mishpatim</i> mean that the laws should be studied, <i>le-hokek,</i> to analyze the words deeply, so that one can derive <i>mishpatim</i>, [laws that are to be practiced] from them. This interpretation is supported by the above-mentioned <i>Mechilta,</i><sup>21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Netziv’s first addendum in this chapter.</i> and this is Malachi’s exhortation [to be “mindful of the teaching… with <i>hukim</i>, analysis, and <i>mishpatim</i>, rules of practice”].",
                    "[Addendum 1 to Chapter 8]<sup>22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv in Addendum 1 to Chapter 5, using his explanation of <i>hukim</i> and <i>mishpatim</i>, resolves a question raised by Tosafos pertaining to an apparent conflict between Tractates <i>Bava Kamma </i>and <i>Sanhedrin</i>22 as to whether teaching the Torah to non-Jews is forbidden.</i><br>THIS [EXPLANATION OF <i>hukim</i> and <i>mishpatim</i>] resolves a question raised by Tosafos in the fourth chapter of Tractate <i>Bava Kamma.</i><sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">38a. See Tosafos, s.v. <i>Kar’u ve-shanu ve-shilshu</i>. What the Netziv cites is similar to the question of Tosafos, but Tosasfos does not cite Tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i>.</i> [The difficulty is that <i>Bava Kamma</i> relates that the Sages] taught Torah to non-Jews, yet the Sages in Tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i><sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 59b.</i> inferred from the verse “It is the <i>morashah</i> [heritage] of the Congregation of Jacob”<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 33:4.</i> that [teaching the Torah to non-Jews is forbidden. The source of the latter rule] is that the word <i>morasha</i> may be read as <i>me’orasah</i>, betrothed; meaning that we are betrothed to the Torah, and a non-Jew who is immersed in the study of Torah is liable to the death penalty.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Meaning he deserves to be punished by God. See Rambam in <i>Mishneh Torah,</i> Laws of Kings10:9. There is second opinion that it is read as <i>morashah</i> (heritage), meaning that the Torah is a heritage for us and not for them.</i> In addition, Tractate <i>Hagigah</i><sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Hagigah</i> 13a.</i> states that it is forbidden to teach a non-Jew Torah and inferred this law from the verse, “Such <i>mishpatim</i> they know not.”<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 147:20.</i>",
                    "However, by defining [<i>hukim </i>and<i> mishpatim</i>] as above, no question remains. For certain, one is allowed to study established laws with [non-Jews]; it is only the Talmud, the pilpul of the Torah, that is forbidden. It is “the Torah that Moshe commanded us”<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">God first gave the pilpul method to Moshe and his descendants, and then Moshe generously gave it to all of Israel.</i> [the pilpul] that is betrothed to Israel. This is stated by the verse: “He relates His words to Jacob, His <i>hukim</i> and <i>mishpatim</i> to Israel. He did not do this for any other nation; such <i>mishpatim</i>, they know them not.”<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 147:19, 20.</i> “His words,” i.e., the Written Torah, “He relates” [communicated such that it enables the people to infer nuances from Scripture];<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These words were added based on the Netziv’s statements in <i>Harhev Davar</i> on Lev. 18:5. The Hebrew word for “relate” is <i>higid –</i> which, according to the <i>Mechilta</i> on <i>Yisro,</i> means that God related the Torah in detail to the Israelites.</i> “to Jacob,” the entire congregation of Jacob, [meaning that it was transferred exclusively to those who enter the congregation of Jacob];<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Harhev Davar,</i> the Netziv cites <i>Shemos Rabbah</i>, <i>parashah</i> 30, regarding the convert Aquila (Onkelos), who told Caesar that he converted to Judaism so that he could understand the Torah well – as the Torah states: “He relates His words to Jacob.”</i> “His <i>hukim</i> and <i>mishpatim</i>” – these are the [<i>hukim</i>], hermeneutical rules and methods of analysis [that result in the <i>mishpatim,</i> laws]; “He did not do so for any other nation” refers to “His words”; the [methodology which permits inferences of minutiae from] the Written Torah [were not made known to the other nations]. Even though they, [the nations of the world], know the Written Torah and [it was God’s] desire from the beginning that they should know the Written Torah, (for that is why the Torah was written in seventy languages, as stated in the seventh chapter of Tractate <i>Sotah</i>),<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">35b.</i> He did “<i>relate</i>” the Torah to them [as he had done for Israel]. The phrase “Such <i>mishpatim</i>, they know them not” does not exclude the <i>hukim</i>, the analytical rules<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is why the verse does not state, “<i>Hukim </i>and <i>mishpatim,</i> they know them not.”</i> [as the nations of the world] may study the hermeneutical rules [and understand them] at face value. However, they are unable to grasp the analysis such that they can apply them [to derive new <i>mishpatim</i> applicable] to daily life; thus, the Talmud was not made known to them.<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Mishpatim</i> means to apply the <i>hukim</i> with the result of producing practical laws.</i> In fact, this interpretation [of <i>hukim</i> and <i>mishpatim</i>] is clearly stated in the Jerusalem Talmud,<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jerusalem Talmud, Tractate <i>Nedarim</i> 4:3.</i> which is also cited by the Ran on Tractate <i>Nedarim</i> 37a, [while discussing the scope of the prohibition for compensating those who teach Torah, states:]",
                    "One may argue that one is required even to teach Scripture and <i>Targum</i><sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is referring to Targum Onkelos, which gives the simple meaning of the verses.</i> gratuitously, therefore the Torah states: “[God commanded me at that time to teach you]<i> hukim</i> and <i>mishpatim</i>.”<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 4:14. The Talmud interprets this verse as saying: Just as I, Moshe, taught you the <i>hukim</i> and <i>mishpatim</i> gratuitously, so you must teach the <i>hukim</i> and <i>mishpatim</i> gratuitously.</i> You are to teach them <i>hukim</i> and <i>mishpatim</i> gratuitously, whereas you are not required to teach Scripture and <i>Targum</i> for free.",
                    "We thus see that <i>hukim</i> and <i>mishpatim</i> refer to the Talmud. This [conclusion] is also strongly supported by the <i>Sifrei</i> on Deut. 12:1: “These are the statutes and judgments;” [the Sifrei says] that <i>mishpatim</i> refers to practical laws. <i>Targum Onkelos</i> also translates <i>hukim</i> in this verse as <i>keyamayah</i>, “that which is established,” [which means they are laws that are established by the rabbis].<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, “derived” by them and not “decrees.”</i> This is unlike the way <i>hukim</i> is translated by the Targum when used in the context of the verse “This is the <i>hukas</i> of the Passover offering”<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ex. 21:43.</i> [which he translates as a decree.<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is the usual translation of the word <i>hukim</i>: “counterintuitive laws.”</i>] [Thus, the meaning of <i>mishpatim</i> and <i>hukim</i> varies depending on the context. Therefore, the reason that the sages, as stated in <i>Bava Kamma,</i> were able to teach Torah to two members of the Roman government is that they were only teaching the established laws of the Torah, whereas when <i>Sanhedrin</i> states that it is forbidden to teach non-Jews the Torah, it is referring to pilpul].",
                    "Now all of the previously cited [Biblical and Talmudic] statements are clear and can be resolved without any difficulty. [Returning to Tractate <i>Yoma</i> quoted in chapter 6: “The Torah writes <i>zar</i>, “alien,” which may also be read as <i>zer</i>, “crown.” If you are meritorious, the Torah becomes a crown for you; if you are not meritorious, it becomes alien to you”]. Clearly, the teachings that are referred to as <i>zar</i>, “alien,” are those that have already been received through tradition. Even though a person does not merit studying them for their own sake, nevertheless he [who has done so] has not sinned, though he does forget it, [which explains why it becomes <i>zar</i>, alien]. However, when Scripture states: “This is the law that Moshe presented before the Children of Israel,”<sup>23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 4:44.</i> it is referring to the power of formulating novel concepts and applying pilpul.<sup>24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An item that initially was only given to Moshe.</i> If one does not merit to apply [pilpul] for its own sake, certainly it becomes for him an elixir of death. He has now formulated laws to be practiced – not in accordance with the truth, for he has formulated novel laws, not for the purpose of achieving the truth but [rather driven by] his will [and ulterior motives]. He has slanted pilpul to derive [incorrect] laws by stretching logic, and there is no greater evil than this.",
                    "The <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> on Exodus, <i>parasha</i> 25, comments: [When the verse states], “His bread shall be given, his waters shall be trustworthy. Your eyes will behold a King in His beauty;”<sup>25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isa. 33:16–17.</i> [it is referring] to the Holy One, blessed be He, who commands those who study Torah. One should never say, “I heard” about anything that he did not hear. Never forbid others from doing that which you allow yourself. Let all the utterances that come from your mouth be reliable, as were those that came from Moshe, and I will make you behold His beauty face to face.",
                    "“His bread shall be given” refers to what is received, i.e., learned from others. The meaning of the <i>midrash</i> is that regarding the given bread – the traditions that he says he received from his teachers – must be transmitted truthfully.<sup>26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Midrash understands the phrase “His bread” to mean that God’s Torah must be transmitted truthfully. The word “trustworthy” also relates to the first part of the verse, “His bread.” Another possible source for this inference is that since the verse is written in the passive voice, the emphasis is placed on the bread (teaching) rather than on the person transmitting it. The bread (teaching) must remain pure and not become corrupted by anyone who handles it.</i> One must not say, “I heard [such and such]” about what he really did not hear. [The verse then continues] to exhort those who originate novel law, referred to by “<i>his</i> waters”; those [novelties] which he produces by himself “shall be trustworthy,” lacking any [influence from] his [personal] will. [If one relates correctly the traditions he received and originates properly novel law], “your eyes will behold a King in His beauty,” the Holy One, blessed be He, will reveal to him a “face” [a means]<sup>27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word <i>panim</i> may be translated as “face” or “manner of interpretation.”</i> to determine the true Halachah. However, if he misapplies [pilpul], being influenced by his biases and personal desires, he incorrectly formulates Halachah, perverts the Halachah being taught to the masses, thus producing an elixir of death.",
                    "The previously cited <i>aggada</i> of Tractate <i>Shabbos </i>[63a]: “Those who go to the left hand [i.e., those who do not study the law for its own sake], ‘there are riches and honor,’ is referring to learning matters that have been received by others.<sup>28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since this Talmudic passage discusses laws that are received and not the application of <i>pilpul</i>, one receives lesser honor, but honor nonetheless. He is not causing others to sin.</i> [Continuing to use this distinction of originating law vs. studying the received laws, we can] explain the previously cited [Tractate <i>Shabbos</i> 88b]:",
                    "What is meant by “Hear, for I will speak princely things”?<sup>29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Prov. 8:6.</i> Why are the words of the Torah compared to a prince? To tell you that just as a prince has power of life and death, so have the words of the Torah [the potentialities] of life and death. [Thus Rava said: “To those who go to the right hand [of the Torah], it is a medicine of life; to those who go to the left hand thereof, it is a deadly poison.]” He who originates new laws through the wisdom of analysis is comparable to a prince. Similar to a prince who directs others according to whatever crosses his mind, [even though it may not be ordered by the king],<sup>30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A prince may order others to act against the king’s wishes, thus making them risk execution.</i> so is the one who <i>originates and produces </i>laws that have not yet been directed [by the King, i.e., God]. It is in this area that one has the potential to kill or to revive [the spiritually ill]. If, through the power of his analysis, he “goes to the left of the Torah” [not for its own sake] and produces laws that are not in accordance with the intended Halachah, then behold, he possesses the ability to kill.",
                    "This is what Rava concluded in [the previously cited <i>Yoma</i> 72b]:<sup>31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 6 where the phrase <i>uman bah</i> was translated as “uses it skillfully.”</i> “If he is <i>uman bah</i>” – upright and applies pilpul in an upright manner – “it is a medicine of life unto him.” We know the meaning of the word <i>uman</i> is “row,” [something that is straight], as [for example] in Tractate <i>Peah </i>4:5, it states: “One gives <i>peah</i> from each <i>uman</i>,” which is translated to mean that one gives <i>peah</i> from each row. Thus, for one who “is not <i>uman bah</i>” – in other words, one who does not apply pilpul to produce straight laws – “it is a deadly poison.” This interpretation aligns Rava’s [statement in <i>Yoma</i>] with the above mentioned statement of Rava [in <i>Shabbos</i> 88b], “For those who go to the right hand [of the Torah], it is a medicine of life; for those who go to its left hand, it is a deadly poison.”",
                    "Due to the merit of resolving the above mentioned explanations, we can also explain what is stated in Tractate <i>Berachos</i> 17a: A favorite saying of Rava was: “The goal of wisdom is repentance and good deeds, for a man should not study Torah and Mishnah and then rebel against his father and mother, his teacher and his superior in wisdom and rank. [This is what Scripture] says, ‘The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom, good understanding to all <i>oseihem</i> – who perform them.’<sup>32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 111:10.</i> It does not say <i>osim</i>, ‘who perform’, but <i>‘oseihem</i>,’ ‘who perform them,’ which implies that they perform them for their own sake and not for other motives. If one performs them for other motives, it were better that he had not been created.”",
                    "Rashi explains: The words, “for other motives” mean one who learns to “criticize and quarrel.” Rava in [Tractate <i>Pesahim</i> in the chapter entitled] <i>Makom she-nahagu</i>,<sup>33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">50b.</i> addresses a contradiction between two verses. One verse states, “For great <i>until</i> Heaven is Your kindness,”<sup>34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 57:11.</i> and another verse cites, “For <i>above </i>the Heavens is Your kindness.”<sup>35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 108:5.</i> Rava answers, “One verse is speaking of one who performs [a mitzvah] for its own sake, while the other verse is speaking of one who performs [a mitzvah] not for its own sake.” [Therefore, Rava in <i>Pesahim</i>] is referring to one who studies for the sake of receiving honor, [that is, <i>until </i>Heaven, whereas in <i>Berachos</i>, Rava is speaking of one who studies in order to criticize and quarrel, thus being a person who should not have been created]. This interpretation seems [to be what is stated] in the Jerusalem Talmud. [This interpretation] is also provided by Tosafos there in <i>Pesahim</i>.<sup>36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Tosafos s.v. <i>Ve-chan be-osem</i>.</i>",
                    "However, in my humble opinion, it is difficult to explain “not for their own sake,” to mean “to criticize and quarrel” [for why did he not use those words explicitly?]. In addition, how could Rava [describe two extremes] – one who studies the Torah for its own sake and one who studies in order to criticize and quarrel? Would not [Rava] be skipping [the most common situation] ─ merely studying not for its own sake without a motive to criticize and quarrel?<sup>37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Words have been added based on what the Netziv writes in <i>Meromei Sadeh</i>.</i> [A further difficulty] is Rashi’s principal interpretation of one “who does not <i>oseh</i>, perform, for its own sake,” is to be translated as “one who does not study” does not fit well, as the Talmud should have stated <i>osek</i>, “involved in study,” [rather than <i>oseh</i>, “perform”]. True, the Talmud is quoting the words as stated in Scripture, but the question can be related to the Scriptural verse itself ─ if it is speaking of study, why does it employ the word, <i>oseh,</i> which denotes “performing?” [This question is strengthened] by the existence of another version of this talmudic statement [in <i>Berachos</i> 17a], where it notes, “Scripture did not state ‘good understanding to all who <i>study </i>them,’ but ‘good understanding to all who <i>perform </i>them?’” [According to this version], Rashi’s interpretation [of the Talmud’s answer that the verse is referring to those who study in order to “criticize and quarrel”], does not really address the question [why the verse states “perform them” rather than “study them”]?",
                    "If one wishes to [offer another] interpretation, that [according to this version] the Talmud is not referring to study, but to those who perform the mitzvos for their own sake [and Rava is stating that “if one performs them [the mitzvos] for other motives, it were better that he had not been created’], then one can ask why should it be if one performs the mitzvos not for their own sake, it is better that he had not been created? Is there not a well-known Talmudic statement that a person should be involved in the study of Torah and the performance of the mitzvos, even if he is not performing them for their own sake?<sup>38</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Pesahim</i> 50b.</i> [Nor can Rashi’s interpretation be applied to this version to say that Rava is referring to one who <i>performs </i>the mitzvos not for their own sake], for to say that one who <i>performs </i>mitzvos “to criticize and quarrel,” is not apt language.",
                    "Rather, it appears that the proper interpretation of the Gemara explaining [Psalms 111:10] that proper study provides “good understanding to all <i>oseihem </i>is that it “provides a good understanding for those who produce them” – i.e., novel [laws and concepts] of the Torah. The Talmud, when explaining “If the verse had stated <i>osim</i> (perform) rather than <i>oseihem</i> (those who perform them),” should be interpreted this way: if the verse had written <i>osim</i>, “perform,” I would have explained the verse as referring to those who perform the mitzvos. However, since the verse stated <i>oseihem</i> [the word <i>oseihem</i> is not be translated as “perform them,” but as “produce them” – the verse is referring to one] who himself creates [the laws].",
                    "This is stated [by Rava] in Tractate <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 18:<sup>39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I found it on 19a.</i> At the beginning the Torah belongs only to the Holy One, blessed be He, but at the end it belongs to him [who studies it], for it is said, “But His desire is in the Torah of God, and in his [own] Torah he meditates day and night.”<sup>40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 1:2.</i> [Meaning], it is as if the Torah is his, since he has produced [new laws] according to the will of the Holy One, blessed be He.’” For the Torah is at first referred to as “His desire,” and then as “he meditates” [and “meditates” means that he derives new laws].<sup>41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi explains “meditates” to mean the application of comparative logic and analysis.</i> This [interpretation that <i>la’asos</i> and its derivatives can mean the creation of <i>halachah</i> is further supported] by what is stated in Tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i> 99b, [pertaining to one who teaches another’s son Torah: Scripture regards him as though he had created the words of the Torah, for it is written, “You will preserve the words of this <i>beris</i> [covenant], <i>va-asisem</i> – you will make – <i>osam</i> – them.’<sup>42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 29:8.</i> Do not read the last word of the verse as <i>osam</i>, “them,” but rather read it as <i>atem</i>, “yourselves.” See what I wrote in <i>She’ilta</i> 7:3 [that <i>va-asisem</i> is referring to the origination and establishment of halachah].<sup>43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>She’iltos</i> states that this verse refers to analyzing the Torah and protecting it. The Torah is preserved by teaching it to others and providing the students with the tools necessary to originate <i>halachah </i>on their own. Thus whatever <i>halachah </i>the students originate it is as if it was created by the teacher.</i> In the <i>midrash</i> on the Torah passage of <i>Be-hukosai,</i><sup>44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Toras Kohanim and Midrash Tanhuma.</i> it states: “<i>va-asisem,</i>” and you will make them.’<sup>45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lev. 26:3.</i> If you guard the Torah I will consider it as if you had produced the commandments.”<sup>46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the <i>Toras Kohanim</i> is translated as “practicing the commandments,” the statement becomes repetitious, for if one guards the Torah, it is obvious that one is also practicing the commandments.</i> Therefore, when Scripture states <i>asisem,</i> it means “you had created them.” However, when one originates a Halachah in sincerity, behold, he has created that law and this is the meaning of <i>oseihem</i> [in the verse: “The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom, good understanding to all <i>oseihem,</i> who make them.”<sup>47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 111:10. See <i>Berachos</i> 17a.</i> The fear of God helps ensure that good understanding is provided to those who originate laws in truth].",
                    "[Addendum 2 to Chapter 8]<sup>48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv in Addendum 2 to Chapter 8 uses the definition of the word <i>la’asos,</i> to originate law, to explain Tractate <i>Shabbos</i> 10a and the <i>Ahavah rabbah</i> prayer.</i><br>TRACTATE SHABBOS 10A states: [“Moshe sat to judge the people, and the people stood by Moshe from the morning until evening.” Now, can you possibly think that Moshe sat and judged the entire day?] If so, when would his [Moshe’s], Torah <i>na’ases</i>, be done? Rather, any judge who renders a true judgment is considered by Scripture as if he became a partner with the Holy One, blessed be He, in the act of Creation.” The <i>Sheiltos</i><sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">She’ilta 51.</i> phrases this as, “When would <i>his </i>Torah be studied and taught?” [We thus see that <i>na’ases </i>refers to deep analysis in order to originate law]. This is the explanation of the words in the prayer [<i>Ahava Rabbah</i>], “<i>Lishmor</i> (to safeguard), <i>la’asos</i> (to make), <i>u-lekayem</i> (and to establish) all the words of your Torah’s teachings with love.” In other words: “safeguard” [by retaining] that which you have already learned; “make,” [derive] new laws, and “establish all the words of your Torah, etc.,” which means to establish the study of Torah throughout Israel. This is the inference of the Talmud [that <i>la’asos</i> means “to produce new laws”].",
                    "The <i>Vayikra Rabbah </i>on Kedoshim, parasha 28 states: [R. Huna and R. Yirmiyah said in the name of R. Hiya ben Abba]: “In the future, the Holy One, blessed be He, will prepare a shade and canopies in the Garden of Eden for those who perform the precepts, accompanied by the students of the Torah.” And [R. Hiyya], has three texts to support him. (1) “For to sit in the shelter of wisdom is to sit in the shelter of money”;<sup>49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Eccl. 7:12.</i> (2) “Fortunate is the man who <i>oseh</i>, creates this, and the son of man who strengthens her”;<sup>50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isa. 56:2. The word “strengthens” is also translated as “seizes.”</i> (3) “She is a tree of life to those who strengthen her.”<sup>51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Prov. 3:18. The word “strengthens” is also translated here as “seizes.”</i>",
                    "“Fortunate is the man who <i>oseh,</i> creates this,” refers to the Sages who <i>oseh</i>, “produce,” the Torah, as the word “this” refers to the Torah, [as seen from Num. 9:23], “And <i>this </i>is the Torah that Moshe placed before the Children of Israel.” “And the son of man who strengthens her;” refers to he who supports those who study the Torah, so that they can produce [novel law]. [Such scholars can] deeply penetrate the Torah with their intellect, and study diligently with a clear mind, [since they do not have to worry how they will be able to support themselves]. We thus see that [the <i>Midrash</i> understands the word <i>oseh</i>] to be referring to those who possess the wisdom “to make” the Torah, i.e., those who originate novel law. See this [<i>Midrash</i>] discussed at greater length towards the end of chapter 10 [in this section].",
                    "[Returning to the previously cited <i>Berachos</i> 17a],<sup>52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“‘The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom; good understanding to all <i>oseihem</i>’ [who perform them]. It does not say <i>osim</i> (‘who perform’) but <i>oseihem</i> (‘who perform them’), implying that they create them for their own sake and not for other motives. If one creates them for other reasons, it would be better had he not been created.”</i> the other version which reads, “It does not say <i>lomedeihem</i>, ‘who study them,’ but <i>‘oseihem</i>,’ ‘who perform them,’ which implies that they perform them for their own sake and not for other motives,” can now also be understood. The Talmud is saying that Scripture did not state <i>lomedeihem</i>, “who study them,” which implies studying that which has already been received, but <i>‘oseihem</i>,’ “who create them,” meaning those who originate novel law. Pertaining to this, Rava concludes that [God provides good understanding] only to those who produce novel law for its own sake, and not to those who derive novel laws not for their own sake. If one produces law not for its own sake, for certain it would be better if he had not been created, as he inverts the words of the living God. In addition, this conclusion is derived from the verse, “The beginning of wisdom is the fear of Heaven” – that is, the fear of Heaven should precede wisdom for [the fear of Heaven] provides good understanding for all who produce Halachah.",
                    "On the other hand, those who study the received law without originating new laws, even when they are not performed for their own sake, even without the fear of Heaven – does not involve, Heaven forbid, any evil. This appears to be the interpretation of Tractate <i>Berachos.</i><sup>53</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Berachos</i> 17a should be translated as: “[Scripture] says, ‘The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom, good understanding to all <i>oseihem.</i>’ It does not say <i>osim,</i> but <i>‘oseihem</i>’ [from which we infer that it is to be translated as] ‘who make them,’ implying that they produce them [the laws] for their own sake and not for other motives. If one produces them for other motives, it would be better had he not been created.”</i>",
                    "[Returning to] the <i>baraisa</i> of R. Ba’na’ah in <i>Ta’anis</i> 7a, [If one studies the Torah not for its own sake, it becomes a deadly poison for him, as Scripture states, <i>‘Lik’hi</i> – my portion [teachings] – <i>ya’arof</i> [shall drop] like the rain.’<sup>54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 32:2. The word “my” is written in lower case, since, according to the Netziv, Tractate <i>Ta’anis</i> understands this word to be referring to Moshe.</i> Y<i>a’arof</i> also denotes killing, as it states, ‘<i>Ve-arefu</i> – and they shall break the heifer’s neck.”<sup>55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 21:4.</i> One can certainly explain, as did Tosafos, [that R. Bana’a] is speaking of a contentious person. However, one can suggest that he is also speaking of one who is involved in the sharp debates and creation of the Torah, similar to the way it was explained in the numerous above mentioned statements [of Rava]. That is, [R. Bana’a] understands the phrase “<i>Lik’hi</i> [my teachings] <i>ya’arof</i> [shall drop] like the rain” to refer to producing novel law. It is clear to me based on what I wrote in another location<sup>56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv writes in <i>Ha’amek Davar</i>, Deut. 32:2, that <i>lik’hi</i> can also be translated as “my purchase,” referring to the deep analysis of <i>halachah </i>achieved through much toil. He bases this interpretation on <i>Shemos Rabbah</i>, <i>Parashas Yisro</i>, <i>Parasha</i> 28, stating that the Torah was given to Moshe “for a price;” the price being that Moshe neither ate, drank, nor slept for forty days.</i> that “my portion” refers to Moshe’s portion, which we explained above [is the art of pilpul which originally was transmitted by God only to Moshe].",
                    "The conclusion from all that we explained above is that one who is blessed by God [with the ability] to originate laws must be extremely careful to do so only for their own sake, preceded by the fear of Heaven.",
                    "In the Midrash Rabbah on Exodus, parasha 19, it states, It is written: “Let my heart be undivided in your hukim [statutes] in order that I may not be put to shame.”<sup>57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 119:80.</i> David said: “Lord of the universe! When I occupy myself with Your statutes, let not the Tempter have power to influence me, as it says: ‘Teach me, God, Your way, that I may walk in Your truth; [unite my heart to revere Your Name].’”<sup>58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 86:11.</i>",
                    ")The Midrash is proving that one cannot explain the phrase “Let my heart be undivided” to mean that David was praying he perform the statutes absent of improper thoughts. We know from what David requested elsewhere, in similar language, [“Unite my heart”], as a prayer that God should “teach” him His ways; in other words, his learning [of the <i>hukim, </i>“analytical rules”] should enable him to achieve the truth.(",
                    "[The <i>Midrash</i> continues], “Prevent my evil inclination from leading me astray and embarrassing me before the righteous.” )It explains the last words of the verse, “in order that I may not be put to shame,” to mean that David was asking that he not be embarrassed before the righteous if he makes an error, since the evil inclination leads people astray in halachic matters due to personal motives).<sup>59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">David was concerned that his error would reveal to the righteous how his Torah study was driven by selfish motives.</i>",
                    "[The <i>Midrash</i> continues], “Moreover, if it [the evil inclination] misleads me, I will neglect the study of the Torah, and when I proclaim my learning before You and those lesser than I am, they will say to me: “It is not so.” As a result, I will be put to shame. I beseech You, therefore, to make my heart whole so that I may occupy myself with the Torah in integrity.’” (The Midrash explains that David was also requesting that he not be put to shame before the students. For if he would not originate new laws for their own sake, his personal motives would lead him astray. For when he comes to describe the formation of his novel laws and derivations before his students, they will recognize his error more than he, as they will be lacking [the same personal motives as David] that would “blind their eyes.” Since he [will have been influenced by personal gain], it will result in [him] becoming embarrassed, and this will restrain him from teaching them Torah [in the future]).",
                    "It is written in Proverbs 12:8, “A man is praised according to his intelligence; but he that is of a distorted understanding shall be despised.” According to the commentaries,<sup>60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Rashi ad. loc.</i> “shall be despised,” is connected to the phrase, “he that possesses a distorted understanding.” [However], according to this interpretation], the end of the verse is not parallel to the beginning of the verse, [since the beginning of the verse deals with a proportional nature, that a man is praised according to the level of his intelligence, and then it states that if he is of “distorted understanding he shall be despised,” which is not proportional].<sup>61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv is arguing that the manner in which this verse is being translated does not conform to the style of Proverbs, which employs parallelism. See Introduction to Proverbs by the Soncino Press, which summarizes the different forms of parallelism used in Proverbs: 1. Synonymous – the second clause repeating the thought of the first clause in different words. For example: “The evil bow before the good, and the wicked at the gates of the righteous” (14:19); 2. Antithetic – the second clause presents a contrast to the first. For example: “A merry heart is a good medicine, but a broken spirit dries the bones” (17:22); 3. Synthetic – the second clause continues the thought of the first. For example: “It is the discretion of a man to be slow to anger, and it is his glory to pass over a transgression” (19:11); 4. Comparative – the point of the lesson is made clear by the use of comparison. For example: “As vinegar to the teeth and as smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to them who send him” (10:26).</i> Rather, the verse’s proper interpretation is that “shall be despised” is connected to “according to his intelligence,” and this is how the verse should be translated: [“A man is praised according to his intelligence; but when combined with distorted understanding, he shall be despised.”]<sup>62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is an aphorism written in the synthetic style.</i> In other words, he who possesses a distorted understanding and distorts the law due to personal motives will be despised proportional to his intelligence. The greater one is [in intellect,] the more he can mislead others, for he brings down the strongholds [of the Torah] by trusting in his [superior] intellect.<sup>63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This last statement is a play on the words used in Prov. 21:22, “A wise man scales the city of the mighty and brings down the stronghold wherein it trusts.”</i>"

                    "<b><small>A FURTHER EXPLANATION OF THE VERSE: “MORE THAN THESE, MY SON, BE CAUTIOUS: COMPOSE BOOKS WITHOUT LIMIT, AND MUCH STUDY IS WEARINESS OF THE FLESH”</small></b><sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Eccl. 12:12.</i><br><b>Translator’s note:</b> In this chapter, the Netziv lays the foundation for his interpretation of Eccl. 12:12 described in chapter 10. Most of this chapter is devoted to demonstrating that the word “beni,” usually translated as “my son,” can also in certain contexts be translated as “scholar.”<br>WE WILL NOW INFER concepts crucial to our objective of explaining the verse: “More than these, <i>beni</i> [my son], be cautious, <i>asos</i> [compose] books without limit, and much study is weariness of the flesh.”<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibid.</i> This verse is difficult to understand [for several reasons]. If Solomon is warning people not to produce many books,<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv may be referring to R. Yonah Ibn Yanach, who in his <i>Sefer ha-Rikmah</i> (at the beginning of chapter 2) argues that the word <i>hizaher</i> (be cautious) always refers to something that one should not do.</i> the verse should have stated <i>me’asos</i>, “of [composing books].” Further, if the verse is to be understood as warning one not to compose too many books, what would be the limit as to how many one could or could not compose? Is it possible, Heaven forbid, that Koheles might be warning others not to enhance the Torah more than what it was during his time? In addition, [if Solomon is warning others not to record the Oral Law, it would already have been known from the Torah] during Solomon’s time that writing books in order to instruct others would have been forbidden – “that which is oral you are forbidden to say in writing.”<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tractate <i>Gittin</i> 60b states: “It is written: ‘God said to Moshe: “Write for yourself these words” (Ex. 34:27). But it is also written: ‘According to [by the mouth of] these words!’ How can this be? That which is written you are forbidden to say orally, and that which is oral, you are forbidden to put in writing.”</i> Moreover, what is the warning not to engage in “much study?” Certainly, one should study the mitzvos as much as possible! Rather, as we will soon explain, the interpretation of this verse must be the opposite [of what we have just suggested].",
                    "First we need to understand the meaning of the word, <i>beni</i>, “my son,” as its usage here is unclear. In Proverbs, [Solomon,] through Divine inspiration, conveys statements uttered by the mouth of wisdom,<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For example, see Prov. 5:1: “My son, take heed of my wisdom; incline your ear to my understanding.”</i> and thus it is well understood that wisdom and understanding [in Proverbs] are represented by <i>em</i>, “mother.” As it states in Tractate <i>Berachos</i> 57a, “One who cohabits with his mother in a dream may expect to obtain understanding, for it is written, ‘<i>ki im</i> – for if – you call out to understanding.’”<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Prov. 2:3.</i> It is clear [from what the She’iltos states] in the <i>hashmatos</i><sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Hashmatos</i> means omissions. The Netziv used other manuscripts in order to supplement missing portions of the <i>She’iltos</i>. See <i>Pesah Ha’amek</i>, Section 3, <i>os</i> 3, where the Netziv refers to how he received additional manuscripts of the <i>She’iltos</i> from Paris and Vienna.</i> of the Torah passage <i>Mishpatim</i><sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Sh’iltah</i> 58, <i>os</i> 15.</i> that [this exegesis] was inferred from <i>im</i> being written with the vowel <i>tzereh,</i> such that it is to be pronounced as <i>em</i>, [meaning “mother]. This is recorded by our master in his [original] handwriting. [That is, by vocalizing <i>im</i> as <i>em,</i> the verse reads, “As <i>em</i> [a mother] you shall call understanding”]. It is for this reason that [one could argue that in the Book of Proverbs], understanding is personified as one, [a mother] who expresses longing for Israel, as represented by the word, <i>beni</i>, “my son.” However, Ecclesiastes, which relates to the investigations of Koheles [in the natural sciences], and [based on the context of] the [above-mentioned] concluding verse [of Ecclesiastes], there is no room for suggesting [that <i>beni</i> expresses] longing.",
                    "We find another ambiguous usage of <i>beni</i> in Scripture due to the theme and context. When Ezekiel depicts the cruel and powerful sword of Nebuchadnezzar, he says: A sword! A sword has been sharpened and polished. It has been sharpened to inflict slaughter; [therefore] it has been ground to a brilliant polish. How can we rejoice? <i>Beni</i> – My son – it scorns the rod and every stick…. There is a trial; and what if he disdains even the rod? It shall not be, says the Lord God.”<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 21:14, 15, 18.</i> On the whole, this statement [of Ezekiel] is difficult to understand, and in particular, the usage of the word <i>beni</i>, which represents longing, does not belong here [in the context of slaughter].",
                    "[However], I believe that the word <i>beni</i> has two meanings: one [that relates to construction] since one’s male offspring is called <i>ben</i>, which is a derivative of <i>binyan</i>, “building,” for the male builds his father’s house [i.e., his family]. Also, female offspring is called <i>bas</i>, with the main form of <i>bas</i> being really <i>benas</i>. As in Aramaic, where we find that a male child is called <i>bar</i> and a female child a <i>baras</i>,<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Aramaic word for “daughter” is composed of <i>bar</i> [son], appended with the letter <i>tav</i>, thus becoming <i>beras</i>.</i> so in Hebrew, the main form of the word <i>bas</i> is <i>benas</i>;<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word for “daughter” consists of the word for “son,” <i>ben</i>, with the addition of the letter <i>tav</i>, forming <i>benas</i>.</i> a proof being that the plural of <i>bas</i> is <i>benos</i>. <i>Benas</i> is also a derivative of <i>binyan</i> [“building”], and the reason for the addition of the letter <i>tav</i> to the root of <i>ben</i> [to form <i>benas</i>], is to lessen the effect of the female’s “building up” of her [father’s house] in contrast to how a male “builds up” his father’s family. For a female [is limited to] extending her father’s house by combining her father’s family with another’s or by building up her husband’s family. Although it is [obviously] impossible [to achieve these ends] without her, as she participates in the building of the world, [relative to her father’s family itself, her “building” is of a lesser effect].",
                    "The second connotation [of <i>beni</i>] is one who possesses intellect and understanding, and the ability to delve deeply into a matter and produce novel insights from the words of the Torah. [Such a person] is called <i>ben</i> because [in this case, the word] is derived from the word <i>tevunah</i>, understanding. <i>Tevunah</i> is also [derived from the word] <i>binyan</i> [“building”], for when one [applies deep analysis to the Torah], he ties one matter<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Tractate <i>Hagigah</i> 14a.</i> to another until he produces a tower that blossoms with the spirit of wisdom. [A person who possesses intellect and understanding] is represented by the word <i>beni,</i> even though a speaker is not referring to his son, [i.e., the possessive form], as the word <i>beni</i> is a noun, [and in many instances it is not to be translated as, “my son”]. For the letter <i>yud</i> is appended [to the noun] as we find with the word <i>nirdi</i>,<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Song of Songs 1:12. The Netziv translates the word “<i>nirdi</i>” (sent forth its fragrance) as “Nard sent forth its fragrance,” rather than “My nard.”</i> in which the <i>yud</i> is added [to nard], and it is not to be translated as “<i>my</i> spikenard,” but as “spikenard.”<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nard is a plant from which a spice and ointment are made.</i> There are many [examples where we find nouns appended with a non-possessive <i>yud</i>].<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the Netziv, the letter <i>yud</i> may be added to a noun to denote a special class. For instance, the Hebrew word for son, <i>ben,</i> is derived from the word <i>binyan</i> (building) since the son builds his father’s house, but when it is appended with a <i>yud</i> in certain contexts it means one who builds structures of knowledge. The Netziv in <i>Rinah shel Torah</i> writes that <i>nirdi</i> denotes a special class of nard. The wild nard that grows in the desert possesses a scent of lesser quality.</i>",
                    "(<i>Netziv’s addendum</i> – We find <i>beni</i> used in a figurative sense in <i>Bereshis Rabbah</i> on the Torah reading <i>Miketz</i>. When he did not agree with an analysis of his students, R. Tarfon would say to them, “<i>Beni</i> shall not go down with you,” [meaning, “<i>Beni</i>, a scholar who possesses understanding, would not agree with you and would not go along with your in-depth analysis.”<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus we can see from this <i>Midrash</i> that <i>beni</i> can represent a scholar who possesses understanding.</i> – <i>end of Netziv’s addendum</i>)",
                    "One who possesses intellect in other areas of wisdom is called a <i>bas</i> – <i>benos </i>in the plural – because the main result of studying the other areas of wisdom is not to build the spiritual world but rather to enhance the structure of Torah. The other sciences are intertwined with [the application of] many Torah laws. A proof of this may be found in <i>Midrash Rabbah</i>, <i>parasha</i> 90: [When Scripture states]: “<i>Benos</i> saw her and acclaimed her;”<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Song of Songs 6:9.</i> it is referring to the tribes [of Israel], as it states: “[Their] fame was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying: Joseph’s brothers have come.”<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gen. 45:16.</i> [When the former verse continues], “Queens and concubines praised her,” it is referring to Joseph, [as it states]: “Pharaoh said to his servants: Can we find such a one as this?<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gen. 41:38.</i> “",
                    "It may seem odd that Pharaoh’s house would be represented by <i>benos</i>. However, it is consistent with the above explained [definition of <i>benos</i>]. “Pharaoh’s house” refers to the sages of the House of Pharaoh, who rejoiced [with the arrival] of Joseph’s brothers, for it was well known that the Hebrews were knowledgeable in all areas of wisdom. They realized that upon their arrival, much knowledge would be received from them, thus increasing their learning. It is for this reason that [Egypt’s sages] are referred to as <i>benos</i>.<sup>20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As they were sages in the secular sciences.</i>",
                    "This is [consistent with] the wording of the verse, “<i>Benos</i> [daughters] of kings are with your precious ones; the <i>shegal,</i>” etc.<sup>21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 45:10.</i> It was previously explained [in chapter 5], the exegesis of the Sages of blessed memory in Tractate <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 4a that [“daughters of kings”] refers to those who diligently study the Torah with an intense love. The Torah helps those who reach such a level to understand the other types of wisdom and thus learn those areas of Torah that require [secular knowledge] to fully comprehend them. “Daughters of kings” refer to the various forms of knowledge possessed by the kings of the nations of the world. “Are with your precious ones,” mean that the nations of the world, will hold you in high regard [as “precious”], for he who is learned in Torah and is also wise in secular knowledge causes the Torah’s to be held in higher regard – that the Torah is the main structure of the world.<sup>22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See this verse explained in <i>Harhev Davar</i> on Gen. 45:16.</i>",
                    "One should now understand that every occurrence of the word <i>beni</i> in Proverbs, uttered by the mouth of wisdom, does not denote yearning,<sup>23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If <i>beni</i> is translated as “my son,” this would symbolize how Israel relates to understanding, which is represented by “mother.” That is, the understanding that is contained within the Torah yearns to join with her son, the people of Israel.</i> but is in fact a noun that represents a scholar who deeply studies the Torah’s wisdom. Proverbs is exhorting this type of person, and is not directed toward the multitudes of Israel. Even those who fear God and hold His mitzvos dear are not at the intellectual level of those immersed in Torah study. It would be incomprehensible [to them], unlike someone involved in observation and analysis. This is unlike the section of Proverbs from chapter 10 [through chapter 30] describing ethics and etiquette applicable to all of Israel.<sup>24</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Beni</i> in that section denotes longing.</i> In chapter 31, Proverbs then reverts to reproaching Torah scholars in particular when it states: “The burden with which his mother corrected him. What, O <i>beri</i>, and what, O <i>bar </i>of my womb? And what, O <i>bar</i> of my vows?”<sup>25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Some translate this verse as follows: “What, <i>beri</i> [my son], and what, <i>bar</i> [son, of my womb]? And what, <i>bar</i> [son, of my vows]?” The Netziv rejects this translation.</i> “The burden with which his mother corrected him,” is referring to understanding, as we explained above [“mother” refers to understanding]; and understanding, she, calls to them: “And what, <i>beri.”</i> [<i>Beri</i>] is not Aramaic,<sup>26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Netziv appears to align with the opinion that Proverbs contains no Aramaic. Chapter 31, which begins with the introduction, “The words of King Lemuel,” are Solomon’s words. Lemuel is another name for Solomon. If this was composed by Solomon it would be very difficult to argue that <i>beri</i> and <i>bar</i> are Aramaic, since the Aramaic language was not the spoken vernacular until the time of the Babylonian exile. Another opinion is that this chapter was added by the Men of the Great Assembly, as stated by the Vilna Gaon on Prov. 24:23.</i> and not to be translated as “my son”. Rather, it is a [Hebrew] noun [derived] from the word <i>barur</i>, [meaning that which is clear]. [<i>Beri</i>] denotes one who clarifies the words of understanding.<sup>27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Similar to <i>beni</i>, the <i>yud</i> in <i>beri</i> is unrelated to the noun’s possessive construct.</i> [Pertaining to the words]: “And what, O <i>bar</i> of my womb” [“<i>bar</i>” does not mean “son,”<sup>28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word “<i>bar</i>” is Hebrew, not Aramaic.</i> but] is an adjective [meaning “pure”]. Just as a fetus whose formation is completed little by little within the darkness of its mother’s womb, so is the structure of wisdom and its clarity accomplished. At first it is slowly fashioned within the bowels of the observer, surrounded by the darkness and obscurity of thought, [after which] the spirit [of life is fashioned] from his understanding.<sup>29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A play on words taken from Job 20:3: “Out of my understanding, my spirit answers me.”</i> [Pertaining to] the phrase, “And what, O <i>bar</i> of my vows,” [<i>bar</i>] is also an adjective [translated as “pure”], meaning that the Torah assists one to achieve clarity [in his understanding], as [wisdom] promises: “I love those who love me, and those who seek me earnestly shall find me.”<sup>30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Prov. 8:17.</i> We therefore find that the clarity [of understanding the Torah] is achieved through vows [to study Torah].",
                    "Returning to the subject [of understanding Ezekiel 21:14, 15: A sword! A sword has been sharpened and polished. It has been sharpened to inflict slaughter; [therefore] it has been ground to a brilliant polish. How can we rejoice? <i>Beni</i> scorns the rod and every stick…. There is a trial; and what if he disdains even the rod? “It shall not be,” says the Lord God.<sup>31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 21:14, 15, 18.</i>] <i>Beni</i> [in those verses] refers to one who deeply penetrates the wisdom and understanding of the Torah. In addition, with God’s assistance, we have explained in my compilation <i>Ha’amek Davar</i><sup>32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ex. 13:16.</i> that the Torah is referred to as a sword. Tractate <i>Shabbos </i>60a<sup>33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I found it on 63a.</i> explains [“sword,”] as in, “Gird your sword upon your thigh, O mighty one, your glory and your majesty,”<sup>34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 45:4.</i> “to refer to the words of the Torah.” [This metaphor] teaches us that the Torah protects those who study it as if it were a sword in the hand of the valiant. [Pertaining to this verse], I explained many Talmudic statements, the expressions of the Ancient Ones, at great length, as clearly explained in <i>Harhev Davar </i>towards the end of the Torah portion, Bo.<sup>35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Harhev Davar</i> on Ex. 13:15.</i> This is also stated explicitly in the beginning of chapter 20 of <i>Avos de-Rabbi Nassan,</i> “He who places the meditations of the Torah upon his heart, the fear of the sword is removed from him,” etc.",
                    "Ezekiel foresaw that the sword of Nebuchadnezzar was approaching to destroy the people of Israel beyond measure. [And though this transpired], many of the Sages of Israel and giants in Torah were saved. This is expounded in the [section of the] <i>Sifrei</i>, in <i>Ha’azinu</i>, relating to the verse “infants together with white-headed elders.”<sup>36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 32:25.</i> [Scripture states]: “He [Nebuchadnezzar] exiled… all the military men seven thousand, and the craftsmen and the gate sentries one thousand; [and the king of Babylonia brought them into exile into Babylon].”<sup>37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Kings 24:15, 16.</i> What sort of war do people bound in fetters and chains wage? Rather, they were mighty men of Torah who waged the war of Torah [through pilpul].",
                    "Also during the days of Zedekiah towards the end of the period of the destruction of the [First Temple were the Sages spared], as it states in <i>Shemos Rabbah</i>, <i>parasha</i> 24, “Is this the way you repay the Lord, you <i>naval</i> and unwise people?”<sup>38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 32:6.</i> This verse refers to the generation of Jeremiah; they were a “<i>naval</i> people” because they produced <i>nevelos</i>, “corpses,” for it says, ‘They have given the dead bodies of Your servants to be food unto the birds of heaven.’<sup>39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 79:2.</i> Why? Because their wise were absent, as it says [and should be translated as], “You <i>naval</i> people, lacking wise ones.”",
                    "Behold, we see that the sages remained alive [throughout the destruction, as the “wise ones” were no longer there when the other Israelites were made into “corpses”]. Not that Nebuchadnezzar loved the sages of Israel, but rather the power of the Torah shielded them, and rescued the sages of Israel from whatever place [whether it was] one from a city, [or] two from a family, bringing them to Jerusalem,<sup>40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Jer. 3:14.</i> from which they were taken alive into exile. This happened during the destruction of the Second Temple, when the sages of Yavneh were saved by R. Yohanan ben Zakkai.<sup>41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Gittin</i> 56b.</i> All of this is what Ezekiel was expressing, for the greatness of the sword [of Nebuchadnezzar] came for two purposes: one, as its plain meaning, to butcher countless people, and two, to gladden the soul of Israel – that the staff of the <i>beni</i>, the Talmudic scholar, “scorns the rod and every stick.” Every forest was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar’s sword. A slender, lightweight rod [a people lacking scholars], cannot withstand it [the sword] – yet the scholar could stand against it. The prophet adds, “There is a trial, and what if he disdains even the rod? It shall not be, says the Lord God.” The [Torah] had placed the greatness and strength of the sword [of Nebuchadnezzar] under trial, for though at the time of Ezekiel’s prophecy it had destroyed and laid waste all the cities of Israel, [“it shall not be”], it did not conquer Jerusalem. [It was observed] that for cities lacking a single scholar – in other words, a “rod that denigrates,” those cities had no survivors. We should rejoice with [at least] knowing the greatness of the power of Torah, and the merit [provided to those who study her, for Jerusalem was spared. We thus learn the strength of the Torah, for a single scholar can save an entire city]."

Both function in every generation “as goads” [providing direction], enabling him to originate novel law, and as “implanted nails” [cuttings which are planted in the earth], enabling one to “harvest the fruit” of halachic decision-making. Koheles then warns those who originate and delve deeply to enhance and add to the Torah, more than what has already been received [from the “wise ones” and the “masters of collections”]: “<i>Ve-yoser</i> (and more) <i>me-hemah </i>(than these) <i>beni</i>, be cautious” – in other words, he [who is a Torah scholar who penetrates into the core of the Torah] and wishes to make the Torah <i>yoser</i> – more – than what currently exists has a responsibility to be more cautious than would be required of one who is merely studying the Torah in its current form [without his enhancements]. If one is only studying the Torah, even if not for its own sake, it is not considered an evil act. Even if he does not analyze it sufficiently, he has done no evil. This is not so if one wishes to originate [new laws], for then he needs to take care not to destroy [the Torah] with the decisions that stem from his bitter analysis (that is, not for its own sake). He who is hasty (with little analysis) is capable, Heaven forbid, of destroying the world.",
                    "Solomon “also taught the people”<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Eccl. 12:9.</i> how to be cautious when originating additional laws [by warning]: “Compose books without limit.” This means that if one is meditating on the words of the “wise ones” and the “masters of collections,” conceiving novel concepts, he should write them down for himself. He should not wait until the moment that he will need [to use that concept] for decisions and application of analysis. One should note that even though it was forbidden in Solomon’s time<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As in any other generation.</i> to commit the Oral Law to writing, as stated in Tractate <i>Gittin</i> 60b, nevertheless it was permitted to write notes for oneself. This is referred to in Tractate <i>Shabbos</i> 6b by the phrase <i>megillas sesarim</i>, a “secret scroll,” on which Rashi comments: It was hidden because it was not allowed to be written down. When they heard novel opinions of individual [scholars] that had not been learned [previously] in the study hall, they would record them so that they would not be forgotten, and they would conceal the scroll.",
                    "“It was not allowed to be written down” means that [it was prohibited] where the purpose was to teach others [directly from the scroll]. The <i>Baraisa</i> states, “Matters of the Oral Law are not allowed <i>le-omran bi-chesav</i>, to be communicated in writing;” it does not state “are not allowed <i>le-kasvan</i>, to write them down.” One was certainly permitted to record the laws so that the author would not forget them.",
                    "This is also stated in the fourth chapter of Tractate Sanhedrin:<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">34a.</i> “Two judges’ clerks stand before [the judges], one on the right and one on the left, recording the arguments of those who would acquit, and those who would convict.” They not only recorded their decisions, but also the rationale of their decisions, as it states in 35a [of <i>Sanhedrin</i>]: “Courts do not convene on the eve of the <i>Shabbos</i> or Yom Tov. For if he is tried on the eve of <i>Shabbos</i>, and the matter concluded on the first day of the week, they might have forgotten their reasons by then. Although two judges’ clerks stand before them and write down the arguments of those who would acquit and those who would convict, they can only record according to the mouth [in other words, what they heard said – once the heart forgets, it remains forgotten. Hence it is impossible [to convene on the eve of <i>Shabbos</i>].”<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The deliberation of the case may need to be interrupted due to the Sabbath. As a result, the judges may forget the reasoning that underlies their decisions and therefore will be unable to defend them. While they would record the rationale of each judge in writing, this would not be able to capture the judges’ rationales completely.</i> This [concept] is clearly stated [in <i>Sanhedrin</i>] 34a, that they [the clerks] recorded the rationale, “lest two judges draw a single argument from two Scriptural verses,” or for some other purpose. Behold, there is no prohibition [in recording matters pertaining to the Oral Law], it is just that it is forbidden to record the Oral Law to study and learn from [the text]. This is stated in Tractate <i>Temurah</i> 14b: “If one writes the laws it is considered as if he had burned the Torah, and he who studies [this text] receives no reward.” [We thus see] that it is forbidden to study from what is written and it is thus forbidden to record the received laws. However, it is certainly permitted to write them for one’s personal use, so that he will not forget his own opinion.",
                    "<small><b>Translator’s note:</b> The Netziv cites an additional proof that the prohibition of recording the Oral Law is when the text is used to teach others.</small><br>[<i>Temurah</i> 14b states: “You are not allowed to state oral matters from what is written, and you are allowed to recite written matters orally”]. Tosafos interprets this earlier prohibition on the topic in <i>Temurah,</i> “The Written Torah may not be recited orally,” to mean that one may not recite the Written Torah orally for others [unless he is reading directly from a Torah scroll, so that others may fulfill the obligation of hearing the reading of the Torah]. The Gaon, Rabbenu Eliyahu, agrees with this in <i>Shulhan Aruch, Orah Hayyim</i> 49, based on what is discussed explicitly in Tractate <i>Ta’anis</i>; see what he wrote there.<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Vilna Gaon in <i>Beurei ha-Gra</i> agrees with Tosafos’s interpretation of <i>Temurah</i> based on what is stated in Tractate <i>Ta’anis</i> 28a. The <i>Baraisa</i> in <i>Ta’anis</i> states: “‘During the morning and <i>musaf</i> prayers, the people assemble in the synagogue and read from the Torah in the same way as they do during the entire year, but during the afternoon prayer one individual recites the entire portion by heart.’ Said R. Yosi: ‘Is an individual ever allowed to recite the Torah for the congregation by heart? You must therefore say that all the congregants read it individually (for themselves) by heart, as one reads the <i>shema</i>.’” From R. Yosi’s question we infer that the prohibition of reciting Scripture orally applies only when the recital is performed for a congregation in order to fulfill the mitzvah of hearing the reading of the Torah.</i> Therefore, just as [the latter statement, “Written matters are not to be recited orally,” is referring to reading for others], so does the first statement, “You are not allowed to state Oral matters from what is written,” also apply to teaching others the Oral law that has been recorded; recording them for one’s personal use is permitted. It is for this reason that scholars who recorded [these oral statements] hid them so that others would not study from them.",
                    "This is also stated by the Rambam in the introduction to <i>Yad ha-Hazakah</i>: In each generation, the head of the <i>Beis Din</i> [court] or prophet would write down notes for himself in order to remember the matters that he heard from his teachers, and he would use them [as an aid] to teach the masses. Each and everyone would write down <i>for himself</i> the explanation of the Torah or its laws, as he was able, in accordance with what he heard.",
                    "One can add that this is what is stated in Tractate <i>Nedarim</i> 38a: R. Yosi ben R. Hanina said: “The Torah was given only to Moshe and his seed, for it is written, ‘Write yourself – <i>lecha </i>– these words’<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ex. 34:27.</i> [and] ‘Carve for yourself’ – lecha:<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ex. 34:1.</i> just as the carvings [of the Tablets] are yours, so is the writing yours.”<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Discussed in chapter 6.</i> The Talmud there concludes that it was <i>pilpul be-alma</i><sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That which God gave to Moshe alone.</i> and we previously cited the Rosh’s explanation that <i>pilpul be-alma</i> refers to the hints provided by the letters.<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See chapter 6.</i> However, this [explanation] does not fit well with <i>pilpul be-alma,</i> for the Talmud could have simply stated, <i>diyukei dikrah</i>, “inferences from the nuances in Scripture.” The Mefaresh explains [<i>pilpul be-alma</i>] means “inferring one matter from another.” However, it is unclear how we know from the phrase “write for yourself these words” [that it is referring to pilpul that was given to Moshe alone]. A further difficulty is that the Talmud [infers this] by comparing the phrase “write for yourself these words” to “carve for yourself,” and concludes that “just as the carvings [of the Tablets] are yours, so is the writing yours.” Could we not have inferred [that pilpul was given only to Moshe] from the phrase “write for <i>yourself </i>these words” alone [without reference to “carve for yourself”]? If the reason for needing “carve for yourself” is to teach us that <i>‘‘lecha</i>” does not mean [“for your benefit,” as is used in Genesis], “<i>lech lecha,</i>”<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gen. 12:1.</i> [which is interpreted to mean “go out for your own benefit”], and as “<i>Kach lecha </i>(take for yourself) high-quality spices,”<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ex. 30:23.</i> [which is also interpreted “for your benefit”], we still obtain no proof from “carve for yourself” [for one could still argue that “carve for yourself” should be translated as “carve for your benefit”]. See the way I have explained [<i>lecha</i>] in my commentary <i>Harhev Davar</i> on <i>Shemos</i>.<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ex. 34:27 where the Netziv explains that the word <i>lecha</i> can have two different meanings depending on the context: 1) for your benefit alone, and 2) it is to be given to you alone in secret and thus remain unknown to others.</i>",
                    "It therefore seems R. Yosi ben R. Hanina [in <i>Nedarim</i>] explains the verse, “Write for yourself these words, for according to these words have I made a covenant with you and Israel,” to be speaking of [only] one subject [i.e., the oral law]. This is unlike Tractate <i>Gittin</i> 60b, which states, “Write for yourself,” refers to the Written Torah, and “by the mouth of these words” refers to the Oral Law (it is explained in the same manner in the Jerusalem Talmud in Tractate <i>Peah</i><sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chapter 2, halachah 4.</i> and in the <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> on the Torah passage of <i>Ki Sissa</i>).<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Parashah 47.</i> However, “R. Yosi ben R. Hanina explains the entire verse to be speaking of the Oral Law. [He also understood] that the contradiction between “write for yourself” and “by the mouth of these words” would be answered according to what we have just explained: “write for yourself,” means it is proper to write what you originate through <i>pilpul</i> – only for yourself, however, to transmit and teach it to others should only be done [“by the mouth”] – orally. It would therefore be possible to explain that Moshe was [always] required to teach the Torah of pilpul to Israel, and the meaning of “write for yourself,” is that he was not to submit the recorded words of pilpul to others for study. Scripture therefore also said, “Carve for yourself,” from which we infer that just as the Oral Law [which was contained within the Tablets]<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Harhev Davar</i> on Ex. 24:12 and Ex. 34:27, stating that the Divine names used in the creation of heaven and earth were contained within the first and second Tablets. These names, when recombined, formed the words of the mitzvos of the Torah (see the end of Part 1, chapter 1, where this subject is discussed further by the Netziv).</i> was only for [the benefit of] Moshe and his descendants – and the others had no share in pilpul – so, too, the writing of pilpul<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the Torah had a need to add the phrase “carve for yourself,” we infer that “write for yourself” refers to a writing that was unique to Moshe and his descendants. “Write for yourself” does not include the prohibition that applies to everyone – not to use the oral law to teach others – but the writing of pilpul notes, which was unique to Moshe and his descendants.</i> was given only to Moshe and his descendants.<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Initially, only the descendants of Moshe were given the ability to apply pilpul and to understand the intent contained within the previous generation’s pilpul notes.</i>",
                    "<small><b>Translator’s note:</b> The Netziv has explained “write for yourself” refers to the writing of notes required for organizing one’s thought when applying “pilpul be-alma.”<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When the Rosh says, “All wisdom and reasoning are hinted at in the writing of the Torah by the forms of the letters,” he is explaining the process of <i>pilpul be-alma,</i> not “the writing is yours.”</i> The Netziv in the following paragraph is citing the history of the Tribe of Zevulun to demonstrate how the gift of pilpul requires an additional ability to properly comprehend the previous generations’ notes.</small><br>See what I wrote at length in <i>Ha’amek Davar</i> to <i>Devarim</i> 33:23<sup>20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There the Netziv states that the scholars of Zevulun possessed the ability to apply pilpul and originate new laws. However, since they were unable to communicate this ability to others, they recorded their ideas only for their own use.</i> and in my compilation <i>Rinah shel Torah</i><sup>21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I could not find this verse explained in <i>Rinah shel Torah</i>. Perhaps the Netziv is referring to his lengthy discussion in this compilation, when he describes how Jeremiah warned his generation that by applying pilpul they could repel the sword of the enemy. See text at note 30.</i>: that “Out of Zevulun, they who handle the pen of the scribe”<sup>22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Judges 5:14.</i> means that they would record for themselves what they heard [originated by other scholars]. This is also the intent of Jeremiah chapter 8:<sup>23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 8.</i> “How can you say, ‘We are wise and the Torah of the Lord is with us?’ For it has performed falsehood, the pen of falsehood of the scribes.” This means that you should not say that since the Written Torah is with them, [well-known by Jeremiah’s generation]; it must be considered wise. The scribes [of the previous generations created opportunities] for falsehood, for the preceding generations left them notes from their numerous novel insights that existed from the days of Hezekiah – for naught, for as we wrote below,<sup>24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chapter 11.</i> during the days of Jeremiah they did not toil in the Torah [and misused those notes].",
                    "[It is in reference to the notes of pilpul] that Koheles warns those who have the ability to enhance the Torah and to originate decisions that are to be established as Halachah: to first make private notes [at the moment of discovery] and not rely [on his ability to remember these novel thoughts] when the moment arrives for applying his ideas and making decisions. Those [private notes] provide two benefits: First, at the time when he needs to apply his ideas, there is concern that he may be influenced to slant his opinion and lose his objectivity because of his prejudices in a particular matter and his personal involvement in the case. Alternatively, once one [scholar] decides in a particular way, it is the nature [of human beings] to take a position different from the one that his colleague has proposed, such that when he makes his decision based on halachic principles he may ignore a particular element because he has deviated [from his objectivity]. Then, he will corrupt the decision, Heaven forbid. Yet if he made notes during his study, when he originated novel insights in Halachah and decision, [using those notes when making his decision], he will no longer uproot halachic elements because of <i>shiat,</i> his passions.<sup>25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I translated <i>shiat</i> in the same way the Netziv does in Part 1, chapter 16.</i> The second [benefit of private notes] is [to counter] the concern that at the time of application, he will be pressured to complete the decision with minimal analysis, thus being unable to discern the required elements of that halachah.",
                    "It appears from the commentary of the <i>Targum Yonassan</i> that this is the intent of Jeremiah’s warning in chapter 2:<sup>26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 24.</i> “A wild donkey who is used to the wilderness, who gulps the wind in her desire, who can hinder her lust? All those who seek her will not weary themselves. In her month, they shall find her.”<sup>27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Targum explains that this refers to the last month of the donkey’s pregnancy.</i> The Targum states: Like a wild donkey… so is the congregation of Israel that runs away, [rebels], and sways from the Torah, ignoring the Prophet’s retorts. He [Jeremiah], says to her [Israel], that she does not toil with any of the openings of the mouth, [i.e., make inquiries] of the Torah, [they think] they will find it [in its proper] time.",
                    "It appears that the Targum is describing the reproach, directed against the Torah scholars who did not toil in the study of the Torah and who went “wildly” as they desired. They thus erred in their halachic decisions and did not desire “to return,” even after the greatest among them came to reverse their decisions. In the prophet’s statement, “All who seek her will not weary themselves, in her month [of giving birth] they shall find her,” he describes [the scholars’ thinking]. All those who sought the Torah did not toil [in it], believing that in the proper time, the time when an unfamiliar situation<sup>28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Described by the donkey giving birth.</i> would arise requiring their decision, “they would find her.” They believed that they could make the decision based on the proper halachic elements; they did not believe that they would have to toil before that time or to study the Torah diligently.<sup>29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus, the Targum explained that the word <i>hodesh</i> not as “month” but as a moment of discovery, from the word <i>le-hadesh</i>, to originate. The second part of the verse is to be translated as: “All those who seek her will not weary themselves; [they say that] ‘with her moment of discovery they shall find her.’”</i>",
                    "This is not much different from the theme of Jeremiah’s warning during the period of the destruction [of the first Temple], for the worst destruction was related to the strength of the battle of Torah among Israel; this being explained at length in my compilation, <i>Rinah shel Torah</i>,<sup>30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Sha’ar Yisrael</i>, <i>osos</i> 11 and 12.</i> [as I was blessed] as decreed by the Living God. To a lesser degree, this is also addressed in the following chapter. It is for this reason that Koheles taught knowledge to the <i>beni</i> – the one who originates new laws and builds new categories. Therefore, when they meditate on the Torah they should write notes without measure, for they do not know when the need for decision will present itself, and they will then need to analyze the issue; they will find that all [as required] is readily available [in their notes].",

                    "[Discussing the Torah with others] benefits in two ways: First, if his mind is deviating from the truth and he errs in a matter, the students will redirect him, causing him to stand in truth.

                    "Rashi explains that Rabbi gained much from his students because they constantly asked questions. However, it appears to me that the parable is accurate. At times, the student begins to awaken the foundation of a halachah, and even though he lacks the ability to build and complete [the analysis], nevertheless he begins to enlighten the path before his master, just as a small piece of wood can set a big piece of wood on fire. This is the meaning [in <i>Koheles</i>] of, “much talk of study,” that the words of Torah are uttered from his mouth numerous times [until it becomes fully understood].",
                    "Along these lines it is stated in Tractate <i>Eruvin</i> 54b: Why are the words of Torah compared to a breast? Just as with a breast, every time a baby touches it [with his mouth],<sup>37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Others translate it as “every time a baby handles it.”</i> he finds milk in it; so it is with the words of Torah, every time a person utters them,<sup>38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Others translate it as “meditates upon them.”</i> he finds [additional] flavor in them.",
                    "It is therefore fitting, when one originates [halachah] he utters his thoughts with his mouth many times, and [the Torah] thus becomes sweeter than when [the concept] first arose in his mind. Koheles adds that a scholar should speak his ideas out not only while studying privately, when he is comfortable, but also when it involves “weariness of the flesh,” the toil [required] of one speaking it out with his students and explaining [the Torah] to them. All of this facilitates the production of novelties in their true light, and it is for this reason that he needs to be heedful [to talk his insights out with others].",
                    "It appears that this is what is stated in <i>Shemos Rabbah</i>, <i>parasha</i> 47: “[We infer from the phrase] ‘For by the mouth of these words’<sup>39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ex. 34:27. It is usually translated as “for according to these words.”</i> that you should toil in the Torah using your mouth. This [is similar] to what is stated, ‘It is in your mouth and heart to perform it.’”<sup>40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 30:14. It may also be translated as “It is with your mouth and heart to perform.” The verse in full reads: “For the word is exceedingly close to you. It is in your mouth and heart to perform.”</i> It is unclear how “by the mouth” implies that one should toil in the Torah. It therefore appears to be similar to what we have just explained, and is referring to studying only with others, when a person toils in order to [defend] and explain his logic. For the explanation of the phrase “‘For by the mouth of these words” is similar to [what is expressed in] the verse in Proverbs, “And adds learning to his lips,”<sup>41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Prov. 16:23.</i> for it is with his discussion with others that one increases the strength of analysis and thereby brings the halachah to light. The [above-mentioned] midrash brings a proof from the phrase “It is in your mouth and heart to perform it,” for the main theme of that verse pertains to the laws contained in the Oral Law that have not been received, and [their conception] requires us to analyze [the received Oral Law] deeply and [bring them to light] by inferring one matter from another. [Therefore, the verse should be translated as follows: “It is in your mouth and heart to produce it.”] This is what Scripture states: “It is not in the heavens, [so that you cannot say, ‘Who shall go up for us to the heavens and take it for us, and let us hear it that we may produce it].’” This is stated in Tractate <i>Eruvin</i> 54a<sup>42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This gemara is explained further in the addendum in the next paragraph.</i> and see [how this gemara is explained] at length in [<i>Ha’amek She’elah</i>], <i>She’iltah</i> 19.<sup>43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This reference will be described in footnote 45.</i>",
                    "Pertaining to this, the Torah states: “For the word is exceedingly close to you; it is in your mouth and heart to perform.” The simple meaning of this verse is that one should utter the Torah with his lips; study it so that it may be practiced. However, according to this interpretation, it should have stated “It is in your heart to perform it” before “It is in your mouth” to perform it, as the fear of sin precedes wisdom.",
                    "(<i>The Netziv’s addendum</i> – In addition, the cantillations of this verse do not fit [well with this interpretation, “It is with your mouth” [to study] and your heart to perform it”], since the <i>tipeha</i> should be placed over the word <i>be-ficha</i>, “in your mouth,” [thereby separating “mouth” from “perform”]. [Therefore, the word <i>la’asoso</i>, is not to be translated as “to perform it,” but as “to produce it.”] It therefore appears [that the words “in your mouth” are connected to the words “to produce it”], and this is the intent of Tractate <i>Eruvin</i> 54a, where R. Yitzhak infers [from this verse that one is to speak out what he studies: “When [is the Torah] close to you? When it is in your mouth and heart to produce it.”]<sup>44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, discussing the Torah with others enables one to originate new laws properly.</i> – <i>end of Netziv’s addendum</i>)",
                    "Therefore, the correct interpretation [of <i>la’asoso</i>”] is [“to create it,”] which refers to the deep [analysis] of the halachah that is incumbent upon you to infer, [even though] it is distant from you. As explained in the above-mentioned reference,<sup>45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verses in Deut. 30:11–14 are elaborated further in <i>Eruvin</i> 54b–55a: “R. Eliezer said: [The verse] ‘You shall call understanding <i>modah</i> [a relative]’ [Prov. 7:14] teaches one to make signs for the Torah. Rava said: ‘[This teaches one] to set <i>moadim</i> [times] for Torah study.’ And this is what was stated by Avdimi bar Homa bar Dosa, What is the meaning of what Scripture states: ‘It is not in the heavens… nor is it across the sea’? [The words], ‘It is not in the heavens’] implies that if it were in the heavens, you would be required to go up in pursuit of it; and if it were across the sea, you would have to cross the sea in pursuit of it.” The She’iltos explains that Avdimi bar Homa bar Dosa is saying that if a Talmud scholar has a teacher who lives overseas, he is required to travel overseas in order to study from him. The Netziv writes that the <i>She’iltos</i> understands that we infer from the verse in Proverbs that since one achieves understanding mainly by studying daily with a rabbi, it is important to set times for Torah study – that is, to organize classes. Since the Talmud connects the inference from Proverbs to Deuteronomy, the She’iltos understands Avdimi bar Homa bar Dosa to be stating that Deuteronomy is exhorting one to study from his rabbi even if it means that he must travel to his rabbi who lives overseas. The Netziv explains that the verses in Deuteronomy state further that if “it is in the heavens” – if the Torah seems to be too holy and difficult to grasp – we must discuss it aloud with others and apply deep analysis. As stated in Proverbs according to R. Eliezer: “Make signs for the Torah” – in other words, devise and pursue whatever strategy is necessary to understand and grasp the Torah.</i> you may think that it is in the heavens or overseas. In other words, it may appear to you [to be impossible] to produce laws from deep analysis [by yourselves], and thus it is as if [these laws] were in the heavens. Or [you may think] that you will have to travel overseas [to find] a rabbi who has already learned these laws. Therefore, Scripture states that this is not so. Rather, it is within the ability of your mouth and heart to produce these matters of halachah. The interpretation of <i>la’asos</i> is similar to the way we previously explained [in chapter 8], “good understanding to all <i>oseihem</i> (who perform them),’<sup>46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 111:10.</i> where [<i>oseihem</i> should be translated as “make them”], i.e., to produce the halachah.<sup>47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Therefore, the verse is to be translated as, “It is with your mouth and your heart to produce it.”</i> Thus, one can explain that the words “and your heart” is tied to “and your mouth”; the speech [of Torah study] should be with the toil of the flesh, influencing the heart [understanding], and this is how one brings the halachah to light. This is the interpretation of the <i>Midrash</i> which infers [from: “For by the mouth of these words’<sup>48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ex. 34:27. Usually translated as, “for according to these words.”</i>] that one must toil [in the Torah with one’s mouth].",
                    "We therefore find that the Torah alludes to these two pieces of advice for producing <i>halachah</i> from pilpul. One, “write for yourself these words,”<sup>49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ex. 34:27.</i> means to make notes for yourself, and “by the mouth of these words,” to teach them to others. Koheles elaborated on these two pieces of advice for producing halachah beyond what is received: one should write many books for himself, and also engage a great deal in the “talk of study,” together with the “weariness of the flesh” [the toil associated with teaching others]."

This is the sequence of Isaiah 42:18–25: Hear, O you who are deaf, and look, O you who are blind, so that you may see. Who is blind but My servant? or deaf, as My messenger that I send? Who is as blind as he who is wholehearted, and blind as the Lord’s servant? Though you see many things, you guard not, though he opens the ears, he hears not. The Lord desired, for His righteousness’s sake, to make the teaching great and glorious. But this is a people robbed and spoiled, their chosen ones are swollen,<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This translation is based on what the Netziv writes later in this chapter.</i> and they are hidden in prison-houses. They are marked as prey, and there is no savior; they are plunder and none says, “Restore.” Who among you will listen to this? Who will heed? They hear from the rear. Who gave up Jacob as plunder, and Israel to the robbers? Did not the Lord direct so? He against Whom we have sinned, and in Whose ways they would not walk; neither did they listen to His Torah. Therefore, He poured upon him the fury of His anger and the strength of battle; and it set him on fire round about and he did not notice; and it burned him, and he paid no attention.",
                    "The theme of this section [of Isaiah] is as follows: It is known that the righteous King Hezekiah, together with the prophet Isaiah, devoted their lives to increasing Torah among Israel. This is stated in Tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i> 94a: Hezekiah “planted a sword by the door of the schoolhouse and proclaimed, ‘He who will not study the Torah shall be pierced with the sword.’” This is not referring to the study of the received laws that they possessed; rather, he [Hezekiah] enhanced the Torah by [influencing Israel] to analyze and penetrate deeply [to find] novel laws such that it resulted in a <i>Shulhan Aruch</i> [“set table”], laws for practice. This is stated further there [in <i>Sanhedrin</i>]: “They searched from Dan to Beer Sheva and no ignoramus was to be found; from Gabbas to Antipris, and no boy, girl, man or woman was found who was not thoroughly versed in the laws of ritual purity and impurity.”",
                    "This matter is perplexing, for how could Hezekiah have the heart to decree, “He who will not study the Torah shall be pierced by this sword?” However, the reason is that it was known that in his days Sanheriv would destroy the land and conquer many Jewish communities up to Jerusalem. Israel’s main [strategy] for battle was through the sound of Torah, as it states in Tractate <i>Makkos</i> 10a, which comments, “‘Our feet were standing within your gates, O Jerusalem.’<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 122:2.</i> In other words, what caused our feet to stand in battle so they would not stumble? It was the gates of Jerusalem that were filled with Torah.”",
                    "It also states in the <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> on the Torah passage of <i>Toldos</i>, <i>parasha</i> 65, No one arose in the world who was as wise as Balaam the son of Beor and Abnimos of Guadara. The nations of the world came to them to inquire, “Tell us whether we can defeat<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally “match them.”</i> this nation.” They replied, “Walk near their synagogues and their study halls. If you should find small children with voices uplifted there, you will not be able to defeat them. For so were they promised by their Father when he said to them, ‘The voice is the voice of Jacob, and the hands are the hands of Esau.’”<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gen. 27:22.</i> When the voice of Jacob is found within the sanctuaries, the hands of Esau will have no power if not, the hands of Esau will have power, and you will defeat them.’”",
                    "Therefore, it always happened that when Israel went out to battle they would designate those with the proper attitude and aptitude for Torah and prayer, so that they would go out among the soldiers in the tents of the field where they would sharpen the edges of their swords with the sound of Torah. As it states in Tractate <i>Megillah</i> 4a,<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I found it on 3a.</i> [Joshua was chastised by an angel on the night before the battle of Ai for neglecting the study of Torah]. “Immediately in response the verse states: ‘Joshua lodged that night… in the valley.’<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 5:14.</i>…This teaches that [Joshua] penetrated the Torah law deeply.” This verse clearly pertains to the time that Joshua was in need of advice and a strategy for engaging in the battle of Ai, and [Joshua’s conversation with the angel] pertained to the need for [success] in battle so as to sharpen the fortification provided by the sword of Israel.",
                    "This is also the intent of Moshe’s blessing to Zevulun:<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 33:18–19.</i> “Rejoice, O Zevulun, in your excursions” (to wage battle in the fields) “and Issachar in your tents” (within encampments, in which they are engrossed in the Torah). “The tribes will assemble at the mountain” (for battle, and whoever is standing on the mountain is near victory, as is known from many sources); “there they will slaughter offerings of righteousness,” (as they bring a thanksgiving offering for their victory); “for by the riches of the sea they will be nourished” (from their enemies who reached them by sea, bringing abundance from the sea) “and by the treasures concealed in the sand” (what they obtain from their own inheritance, or this may refer to what the idol worshipers hid in the sand near the seashore when they arrived to wage war).",
                    "In Hezekiah’s time, the power of the Torah was sought out as necessary for success in battle against Sanheriv, for he saw that the yoke of Sanheriv would not be destroyed by a well-sharpened sword or the intensity of battle, but rather by the special sword of Israel (as cited above from Tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i>). [Scripture states]: “The yoke shall be destroyed by reason of oil,”<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isa. 10:27.</i> meaning that the yoke of Sanheriv would be destroyed by the oil of Hezekiah, which burned inside the various synagogues and study halls.<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, the Torah study continued throughout the night in Israel.</i> Therefore, since there was a need to succeed in war, it would be feasible for Hezekiah to decree [that those who refused to study would be killed], just as a king would order his entire nation to take up the sword, as necessary in wartime. This will be explained in greater length, as God wills, in my compilation <i>Rinah shel Torah</i>.<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Sha’ar Yisrael 10–12.</i>",
                    "Let us now return to the discussion of the theme of the reproach of Isaiah. When those two righteous ones [King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah] decreed upon the cities of Judah that they should enhance the Torah in great multitudes, and deepen and magnify the power of the Torah with the application of pilpul, many cities did not obey their command and were therefore overrun [by Sanheriv]. That is why when Isaiah came to reproach [Judah] about this, he introduced his reproach with the words: “Hear, O you who are deaf,” etc.",
                    "To clarify the reason for his criticism, [let us] use a parable of a king who realizes that the war has reached a critical juncture. The king directs the officers of the army to make new weapons that [seem to be] cumbersome to fight with. Because of the king’s directive, the officers of the army are astonished, since it is common sense that in time of battle one is supposed to simplify the soldiers’ task as much as possible. However, they realized that the king’s perception is without limit and [thus] understood the king’s wisdom. Against the will [of their soldiers], with intense diligence, they would accustom themselves and their hands to the extent that they would be well-trained [in the operation] of this wondrous weapon. For [the officers realized] that the benefit from this [training] would be that their opponents would not [have the same capability] with their weapons against this tool of war. Immediately, they became diligently involved in this task in an exceptional manner, following the king’s directive and thus succeeding in battle. Yet there was one officer who did not fully understand the directive, and [though] he constructed new weapons, he did not strive to train them [the troops] well [in their use]. As a result, when they entered battle, [the solders] being unaccustomed to the new weapons, used the older weapons and were defeated [by the opponent] thus being spoils [of war]. When the king’s wrath was directed against that officer, he retorted that it was due to the negligence of the king’s directive that he lost his army, for he had directed them to make new weapons that were cumbersome. The king angrily replied that this was not true, and since he had failed to comprehend the king’s words, he [the officer] was to blame for [his army] being plundered.",
                    "Now with whom should the king be angry? Not with the soldiers, for they [are not expected] to understand the king’s intention. Rather, [the king’s anger] is either directed against the general, who because of his level of intelligence [and expertise] is expected to comprehend the king’s word, or against [the elite solder], the man of valor who attends personally to the king and is thus rebuked by him many times to understand his intent and intimations.",
                    "So it was during the days of King Hezekiah, during oppressive times for him and Israel, he commanded that the Torah be enhanced and that pilpul and analysis be strengthened. This matter was difficult for many leaders of various communities to carry out fully, for it is common sense that during a time of siege it is better to keep to a bare minimum [the instructions people have] to acquire, and have them focus on the decided halachah, so that each one will meditate upon them individually and independently. Therefore, whom should the prophet Isaiah rebuke? The giants of Israel.",
                    "He [Isaiah] said: <b>“Hear, O you who are deaf, and look, O you who are blind, so that you may see”</b> (in other words: look [contemplate] in order to understand and achieve erudition); <b>“Who is blind but My servant?”</b> ([This refers to] the one who has eyes to see [understand] yet does not look [attempt to comprehend]. It is because of this that I call him “blind.” This does not apply to the one who is incapable of “seeing”). <b>“Or deaf as My messenger that I send?”</b> (He can hear but did not listen, and for this reason is called deaf. I would not insult the one who is incapable of listening. [Isaiah is now going to define who those with the ability to “seek” are]): <b>“Who is as blind as he who is whole hearted?”</b> (This is one who is in the category of a <i>tzaddik</i> [righteous one], who upon sinning is punished immediately, as stated: “The Lord is your Guardian, the Lord is your shade at your right hand.”<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 121:5.</i> God promises the tzaddik that He will protect him from sin, so that the sin will not negate the earlier promise [of continuous protection] stated earlier in that Psalm. [The Psalm] explains earlier how he [the <i>tzaddik</i>] will be protected from sin: “The Lord is your shade at your right hand.” Unlike others, though the Holy One blessed be He accompanies them like a shadow, following them wherever they go – whether for good or ill, most people experience the shade, [the consequences of their acts] after some time, and because of this they do not understand why a particular punishment was meted out to them, so that they can be more careful [in the future]. However, the <i>tzaddik</i> is promised that the “shade will be at <i>his right hand</i>”; if he acts improperly, he will receive punishment without delay, and this [is the intent] of the verse, as stated at the end of the third chapter of Tractate <i>Yoma</i>.<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">38b.</i> Pertaining to such a person, he says, “Who is blind as he who is wholehearted,” for the Holy One, blessed be He, has punished him many times for his unintentional errors, for he is righteous and His servant, and therefore he should have seen [the truth], and yet he does not).",
                    "<b>“And [who is as] blind as the Lord’s servant?”</b> (This is a giant of his generation, who governs Israel in lofty and exalted affairs, and because of his wisdom he should have seen and yet did not see). <b>“Though you see many things, you guard not”</b> (for he has insight to crucial and invaluable matters, many of which he wanted to admonish the people, but he did not take heed to keep guard of them [of impressing on the people] their importance). <b>“Though he opens the ears, he hears not”</b> (the messengers of the Holy One, blessed be He, the prophets of Isaiah’s time, were sent among the various communities in order to stimulate and strengthen in whatever areas required vigor; to increase instruction and pilpul so that they could be saved from the yoke of Sanheriv. And yet they did not listen, and [such a person] is similar to one who is deaf).",
                    "[Following these introductory remarks], Isaiah begins the main body of his reproach: <b>“The Lord desired, for His righteousness’ sake, to make the teaching great and glorious.”</b> (It is certainly clear that at the time of Isaiah, many other prophets received prophecy from God to increase the Torah in quantity and quality; to sharpen the sword of Torah through deep penetration and teaching. The reason that we possess no record of their writings is because matters irrelevant to the later generations were included in much of their prophecy, [similar] to what is stated in the first chapter of Tractate <i>Megillah</i>.<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">14a.</i> In reality, earlier in chapter 32,<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I found it in chapter 28.</i> Isaiah chastises the prophets “tottering in judgment,”<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A term used by the Prophet in Isa. 28:7.</i> because they used minimal oversight and analysis and because they did not want to listen, as explained earlier.<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Part 2, chapter 6.</i> Pertaining to this Isaiah states that it was “for His righteousness’s sake” that He has taught you the way to be saved from the sword of Sanheriv). <b>“But this is a people robbed and plundered”</b> (where “robbed” refers to one who is not taken captive himself, but whose possessions are taken as plunder, whereas “plundered” refers to who is actually taken captive). <b>“For their chosen ones are swollen”</b>; (the reason [that such a fate] has befallen them is because the special ones of Israel are in a position to wage the battle of Torah with the assistance of their students, as advised [by Koheles].<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">12:12.</i> However, they did not do so, and their wisdom and analysis remained within them, as one stricken with a swollen throat, where his air remains inside and cannot be exhaled [i.e., he cannot talk]. Thus the chosen ones have become too lazy to toil with the students in order to clarify the matters that are within their capacity for breath [i.e., his potential to teach]). <b>“They are hidden in prison-houses”</b>: (they did not go to the study halls to supervise the students so that they should study the Torah diligently, rather they sat by themselves and studied in isolation, as if they lived in prison). <b>“They are marked as prey, and there is no savior”</b> (as a result, this evil has befallen some of the communities, their possessions becoming spoil, with none to save them). <b>“For [they are] plunder and none says, ‘Restore them’”</b> (they have been taken captive and no one can protest by saying, “Restore them”). <b>“Who among you will listen to this? Who will heed? They hear from the rear.”</b> ([That is, they do not listen attentively]. Who among the giants of Israel will listen to this reproach that I have uttered, acting as if they were hidden in the prison-houses, uninvolved in promoting diligent study by the students – “they [the giants of Israel] hear from the rear.” For Isaiah stated that [these calamities befell] because the special ones acted as though they had swollen throats, not uttering words of Torah to their students, continuing [to remain in isolation] like one in prison, by not going to the study halls at all. Yet they, [the giants of Israel] say the opposite, that they are forced to remain in the “prison-houses,” for they cannot burden the students with such difficult labor – apply pilpul and deep analysis at a time of crisis. Therefore, even they have reached such a level that every special one [acts as if he] possesses a swollen throat, such that there is no longer found a single [student] before whom a scholar can communicate the deep analysis of the halachah residing within him). <b>“Who gave up Jacob as plunder”</b> (the multitudes were taken captive due to the lack of the merit of the students’ “voice of Jacob”) <b>“and Israel to the robbers?”</b> (Although the giants of Israel<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Ha’amek Davar</i> on Gen. 38:10, in which “Israel” refers to the exceptional ones, while “Jacob” represents the masses.</i> possessed merit [of Torah study] sufficient to save themselves (as I wrote in chapter 9), nevertheless their possessions became plunder [of war]).",
                    "<b>Did not the Lord [direct so]?</b> (For even if they [the giants of Israel] did not direct that the Torah be enhanced and strengthened by sharpness of study, [they could at least have charged them] to study diligently what they had received, and [many] would [be able to] supervise them. Had they come to the study hall to supervise the students, [this would have led to interaction between the students], so that they would tell them what was in their minds rather than act as though their throats were swollen. However, [the giants of Israel insist] that though the Holy One, blessed be He, has charged them to sharpen the sword of Israel, it is impossible today [to achieve victory in this manner] by imposing [such study] on the students.",
                    "This [attitude of the giants of Israel] resulted in <b>“He against whom we have sinned”</b> (this is the cause for having sinned against Him, for we are lax in establishing the word of God) <b>“and in whose ways they would not walk”</b> (pertaining to the way He exhorted and taught the strategy for being saved from Sanheriv); <b>“neither did they listen to His Torah.”</b> (They ignored the many places where the Torah declares the greatness of the power of the sword of Torah); <b>“Therefore He poured upon him the fury of His anger” </b>(such that many communities were overrun by Sanheriv) <b>“and the strength of battle”</b> (many stood to fight and did not succeed due to the intensity of the battle). <b>“It set him on fire round about, and he did not notice”</b> (for they heard at first that the villages surrounding the city were already destroyed and burned by Sanheriv’s army, and yet they did not learn any lessons from this for what they should be careful). <b>“And it burned him, and he paid no attention.”</b> (Even when the punishment arrives, he pays no attention for the future [and does not understand] that this is a punishment from Heaven.

This reciprocal punishment applies whether the testimony involves capital punishment or monetary payments. The law of reciprocal punishment only applies when the witnesses have been discredited through hazamah, in which a second set of witnesses testifies that the first set of witnesses could not have seen the incident regarding which they testified because they were somewhere else at the time.</small><br>I WOULD LIKE to provide an incentive<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally translated as “opening.”</i> for those who support others in the performance of mitzvos, by proving that their assistance is equal to the one who performs the mitzvah himself, so that they may find the heart to perform [this mitzvah] with much joy and generosity.",
                    "It is taught in the Mishnah in the first chapter of Tractate <i>Makkos:</i><sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tractate Makkos 5b.</i> [Scripture states]: “By the testimony of two witnesses or three witnesses shall the one who deserves to die be put to death.”<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 17:6.</i> If testimony may be established by two witnesses, why does the Torah [also] specify three [witnesses]? [This was done in order] to draw an analogy between three and two [witnesses]. Just as it is obvious that three witnesses can discredit two through <i>hazamah</i>, two witnesses can also discredit three through <i>hazamah</i>. Where in Scripture [do we learn] that [two witnesses can discredit through <i>hazamah</i> even a number as great] as one hundred witnesses? The Torah therefore states ‘witnesses.’”<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word “witnesses” is superfluous as it is stated twice in the verse.</i>",
                    "R. Shimeon says, “Just as two witnesses are not executed unless both have been found to be conspiring witnesses, so too three witnesses are not executed unless all three are established as conspiring witnesses. Where in Scripture [do we learn that this rule applies even if a group of witnesses is composed] of one hundred witnesses? The Torah therefore states ‘witnesses.’”",
                    "R. Akiva says, “The third witness is not stated so that we should deal more leniently [with the extra witness]. Rather, [this is done so] that we should deal more stringently with him, and make his [the third witness’s] punishment the same as theirs [the other two witnesses]. If this is how the Torah punished one who was merely an accomplice to transgressors, [by treating him] like the transgressors themselves, how much more so will He reward one who lends his aid to those performing a mitzvah [by treating him] like those who actually perform the mitzvah. And just as with [a group of] two witnesses, if one of [the witnesses] was found to have been a relative<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A witness related to anyone who is involved in the case.</i> or disqualified,<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For example, the witness is known to commit a certain sin.</i> their testimony is invalid, [since only one witness remains], so too with [a group of] three. If one of them was found to be a relative or a disqualified witness, their testimony [i.e., the testimony of the entire group] is invalid. Where in Scripture do we learn [that even one witness of a set can disqualify an entire group consisting of] one hundred? The Torah therefore states ‘witnesses.’”",
                    "Rashi, explaining the reasoning of R. Akiva, states: There would be no need [for the Torah] to teach us the [law stated by the Tanna Kamma that two witnesses can discredit even a hundred], for by logic alone we would know that two can discredit three by <i>hazamah</i>, for two [witnesses] are valid for all [forms of] testimony. [In addition], by logic alone we would know that the [witnesses] are not discredited through <i>hazamah</i> [to receive reciprocal punishment] until the entire set is discredited. For all the witnesses, [regardless of the number,] are treated as one, as Scripture states: “If the witnesses should turn out to be false witnesses,”<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 19:18. Rashi comments that any occurrence of the word ed in Scripture should be translated as “witnesses.”</i> [and the word meaning “witnesses” is written in the singular, <i>ed</i>, “a witness”]. [Rather, ‘three witness’ is stated] so that we should deal more stringently with him, [the third witness]. One should not argue that since without him [the third witness], the testimony would still have been established, [and therefore] we would not apply the law of <i>hazamah</i>. [Thus] Scripture teaches us that this [third witness] is also considered as those who have certified this matter [by testimony].",
                    "I have not merited understanding [Rashi’s explanation]. Because two witnesses are valid for [all forms] of testimony, would we know that the power of three witnesses is not greater than the power of two? Behold, regarding the field of <i>umedanah,</i> estimations in monetary law,<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For example, where expert witnesses are needed to assess the value of property being used to pay off a loan.</i> even though an estimation of two people is sufficient, nevertheless, since we follow the estimations and [if] three others come and estimate that it is not [as the previous two had opined], we listen to [the second group instead,] as stated in Tractate <i>Yoma</i> 83a. Rather, regarding testimony, it must be the reason [that three witnesses are not stronger than two], is because the verse compares two witnesses to three.<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This could not be derived by logic alone.</i>",
                    "In addition, I find what Rashi writes difficult, that it would be obvious [that] three [witnesses] are not punished with death until all are disqualified with <i>hazamah</i>, since three witnesses are considered as one [set] of testimony. [One could also use this logic instead of] using R. Akiva’s exegesis from the verse that if we find that one of the witnesses is a relative or disqualified, [it invalidates the entire group of witnesses]; it should also be obvious that the same logic regarding the three witnesses would be comparable to two [because all of the witnesses are considered as one set]! This exegesis [of a single witness invalidating an entire group of three] is also R. Akiva’s, as is evident from Tractate <i>Sanhedrin </i>9a, which states, “R. Yosi and Rabbi differ in applying the opinion of R. Akiva.”<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One cannot argue that the Mishnah’s exegesis of a single witness invalidating a group of three, is not R. Akiva’s, for Sanhedrin 9a ties this statement to R. Akiva: “R. Yosi and Rabbi differ in applying the opinion of R. Akiva…. R. Yosi says: ‘These aforementioned limitations apply only to witnesses in capital charges, while in monetary cases, the evidence offered can be established by those remaining. Rabbi says that it is one and the same rule; whether in monetary or capital cases the evidence becomes equally void, i.e., provided the disqualified witnesses took part in the prerequisite warning. But if they were not among those who gave the warning, why should the evidence be affected by disqualified witnesses?”</i>",
                    "I am aware of a way to answer and clarify Rashi’s explanation. However, if it were it not for his explanation, it would appear that in reality [R. Akiva’s opinion should be explained as follows]: There are two different verses pertaining to this [comparison of two witnesses to three]. One is from the <i>parasha</i> pertaining to idol worship, “By the testimony of two witnesses or three witnesses shall the condemned person be put to death,”<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 17:6.</i> and the other pertains to conspiring witnesses, “By the testimony of two witnesses or three witnesses shall a matter be established.”<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 19:15.</i> These two verses complement one another in [determining] what may be derived. R. Akiva derives from the verse mentioning the phrase “be put to death” that if one of the witnesses was found to be a relative or disqualified, it invalidates an entire group. Yet from the verse containing the phrase regarding “shall a matter be established,” the Gemara derives that Scripture is speaking only of those who establish the facts of the matter.<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even though the murderer and sodomizer witness the act and cannot testify against themselves, thus being disqualified witnesses, they do not invalidate the testimony of the other witnesses. They are not defined as witnesses since they are not people through whom “a matter shall be established.”</i>",
                    "Though the Tanna Kamma derives the law regarding conspiring witnesses [that two witnesses can invalidate three] from the verse that contains the phrase “be put to death,” he also [needs to] derive from the verse that contains the phrase “shall a matter be established” [that only those who will be testifying are considered as set of witnesses], words not written in the verse that contains the phrase “be put to death.” R. Akiva argues that one is forced to accept that the verse containing the phrase “be put to death” is not coming to derive these [laws of <i>hazamah</i>, that two witnesses can invalidate three], for this is already inferred from the verse containing the phrase “shall a matter be established.” Rather, why is “three” stated in the <i>parasha</i> pertaining to idol worship, in the “be put to death verse?” “So that we should deal more stringently with him and make his [the third witness’s] sentence the same as theirs,” etc.",
                    "Now, from the verse that contains the phrase “shall a matter be established” [alone], which deals with monetary matters, we would not know that the law [of reciprocal punishment] applies to capital punishment [to the extent] that the [third] conspiring witness is also killed since he is [merely] supporting the testimony [of the other two]. It is logical that [reciprocal punishment] applies in monetary cases, for if the three witnesses are discovered to be conspiring witnesses, the payment penalty is divided [equally among them] into three parts. Therefore, we find that the third witness assists in the payment of the penalty resulting from the reciprocal punishment, just as he assisted them in the testimony; thus the verse, “You shall do to him as he conspired to do to his fellow,”<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 19:15.</i> is applicable to him. For since he was a factor in the strengthening of the two witnesses’ testimony, he shares in the payment [penalty], so that he should also pay a portion and thus alleviate a portion of what they should pay.",
                    "However, pertaining to capital punishment, even though he wanted to assist [the other two witnesses] with their testimony, it would not enter one’s mind that he should also die if the members of [the entire group] were found to be conspiring witnesses, for he does not assist them [in any way] with his death. All he wanted to do was to assist [them], to strengthen their testimony,<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since valid testimony existed without his evidence.</i> and yet we apply <i>more </i>than “what he conspired to do to his fellow, is done to him” – he is killed. He does not assist them [the other two witnesses], with his death and he is killed only because of his own sin that he performed by himself. Behold, we learn from this verse that the punishment for one joining others in committing sin is the same as if he had committed the sin entirely by himself.",
                    "R. Akiva also inferred that just as when one of two witnesses is found to have been a relative or disqualified their testimony is invalid, [the same applies to three: if one of them was found to be a relative or a disqualified witness, the entire group’s testimony is invalid]. This cannot be inferred from the verse containing the phrase “shall a matter be established,” for one may argue that even when two are testifying and one of the witnesses is disqualified, the second witness is still valid as far as being able to require the accused to take an oath, a law applicable to a single witness.<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Tractate <i>Kesuvos</i> 87b.</i> One could therefore argue similarly that when there are three witnesses, if one of the witnesses is disqualified, the testimony of the remaining two witnesses is valid. Therefore, there is the need for the verse that contains the phrase “the condemned person be put to death.” Certainly in capital cases, if one of the two witnesses was found to be a relative or disqualified, the [effect] of the second witness is nullified, so also with [a group of] three witnesses, even though two witnesses remain, their testimony is rendered invalid. From [this verse] we infer [that the same rule is applicable] to all other testimonies in the Torah, even pertaining to monetary cases.",
                    "Returning to the subject [at hand], R. Akiva understood from the manner in which those who assist others [in sin] are punished, that he who supports others [in sinning] is considered as if he had committed that sin himself even though he does not lessen the punishment of the other witnesses at all – his punishment is harsh. R. Akiva extended this concept to those who assist others in performing mitzvos. It goes without saying that if someone’s assistance lessens the amount of work performed by the principal, it should result in decreasing the amount of the principal’s reward, for “according to one’s effort is his reward.”<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Avos</i> 5:25.</i> Certainly the one who assists should receive a portion of the reward [proportional] to the amount of assistance that he rendered to the principal. However, if the principal performs a mitzvah on his own, not laying aside any of his burden, when his friend comes to assist him in performing this task, I would not imagine that the one who participates would receive a reward equal to the one who performs the mitzvah by himself. It is this that [R. Akiva’s] <i>kal va-homer</i><sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The inference from minor to major.</i> teaches us: one who joins [others in performing the mitzvah] receives a reward as if he performed the mitzvah himself, even without reducing the amount of reward that the others receive.",
                    "Similarly, those who support others, enhancing the Torah with their money, even though they do not lessen by one iota the toil of those engaged in waging the battle of Torah – nevertheless, since they join them in this mitzvah, they are equal [in the reward reserved for the scholar’s] toil and pain.",
                    "It is written in the <i>parasha</i> of <i>Ki Savo:</i> “Cursed be he who does not uphold the words of the Torah to perform them.”<sup>20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 27:26.</i> The Jerusalem Talmud in Tractate <i>Sotah</i><sup>21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chapter 7, halachah 4.</i> and the <i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> on the <i>parasha</i> of <i>Kedoshim</i> states<sup>22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Parashah 25.</i> that the converse is also [true]: “Blessed be the one who upholds the words of the Torah.” There it explains that “one who has not studied or taught himself, etc., but caused others to study, is included within this blessing.”<sup>23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To quote both <i>Sotah</i> and the <i>Midrash</i>: “R. Yirmiyah said in the name of R. Hiya ben Abba: ‘If a man did not learn Torah and neither performed, observed nor taught it to others, yet maintained scholars even though he did not have the means to maintain them and protested even though he was not strong enough to protest, for this he is included in the term “blessed” (that is the converse inferred from ‘Cursed be one who does not uphold the words of the Torah to perform them).’”</i>",
                    "(<i>Netziv’s addendum</i> – I will now be able to explain the [following] verses in I Samuel, chapter 30<sup>24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verses 24 and 25.</i>: Like the share of the one who goes down to do battle, so is the share of the one who stays with the [soldiers’] equipment; they shall share alike. It was from that day <i>u-ma’alah</i> (onward), that he [David] established a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day. The phrase “Like the share of the one who goes down to do battle, so is the share of the one who stays with the [soldiers’] equipment” does not read well. It would have been better to state, “As one who goes down to do battle so is one who stays with the [soldier’s] equipment; they shall share alike.” Also, the word <i>u-ma’alah</i> is used for “onward” [which really means “and above”]. It would have better to use the word <i>ve-halah </i>[“onward”], (a [note on this strange wording] is already provided in <i>Bereshis Rabbah</i>, <i>parasha</i> 43). In addition, it is unclear how “that he made a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day” relates to the simple understanding in this particular context.",
                    "Rather, it appears that another matter is being alluded to, one unrelated to the context of the <i>parasha</i>, as I wrote in Part 2,<sup>25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chapter 6.</i> of the prophetic style. What the verses are alluding to is the battle of Torah, and so it is referred to in Scripture as seen from what the Sages wrote [pertaining to the verses]: “Behold the couch of Solomon, sixty mighty men round about it…. They all handle the sword, skilled in warfare.”<sup>26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Song of Songs 3:7–8. See <i>Rinah shel Torah</i> on verse 7: that the sixty mighty men refer to scholars who are well versed in the sixty tractates of the Talmud. See Rashi (on verse 8) that “skilled in warfare” represents those who are skilled in the battle of Torah.</i> Also see the <i>Sifrei</i> on <i>Ha’azinu</i>, explaining the verse “craftsmen, the gate sentries, one thousand, all mighty men, warriors,”<sup>27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“He [Nebuchadnezzar] exiled all Jerusalem and all the officers and all the mighty warriors, ten thousand exiles, and all the craftsmen and the sentries of the gates” (II Kings 24:16; Jeremiah 52:28).</i> [as referring to the battle of Torah].<sup>28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This <i>Sifrei </i>is discussed by the Netziv in Part 1, chapter 8. To quote the <i>Sifrei</i>: “What war do people bound in fetters and chains wage? Rather, they were mighty men of Torah who waged the war of Torah [through pilpul].”</i>",
                    "It is known that it is impossible to fight the battle of Torah without the support of those who provide supplies. This is comparable to those who guard the equipment [required] for a war involving hand-to-hand combat. [This verse] would not be needed to teach us how a good reward is provided in this world to those who support others with kindness in this world, [as we already know] of the reward of those who are charitable: that they eat the fruit [that is, they receive the reward] in this world.<sup>29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Tractate <i>Kiddushin</i> 40a, that this is known from Prov. 21:21, “He who pursues charity and brotherly love shall find life, prosperity and honor.” “Life” refers to the reward in the World to Come, while “prosperity and honor” refer to the reward received in this world.</i> Rather, our sages of blessed memory taught us in Tractate <i>Pesahim</i> 53, “Whoever puts merchandise into the Torah scholars’ purses merits to sit in the heavenly academy, as Scripture states, ‘For to sit in the shelter of wisdom is to sit in the shelter of money.’<sup>30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Eccl. 7:12.</i> “Behold, we see that he receives reward together with the possessors of Torah.",
                    "According to this [line of reasoning], the reward of the one who stays with the equipment [i.e., the supporters of those who wage the battle of Torah] is greater than the one who actually studies, for [the supporter] receives a reward both for being charitable and for [being considered] as studying Torah. Therefore, the proper interpretation [of the verse in Samuel] is that the share of reward for the one who is immersed in the battle [of Torah] is the same as for the one who sits with the equipment [provides support]. This one according to his toil, and this one according to his kindness; together they shall receive the [reward]. “For that day and beyond,” meaning [for that moment of supporting Torah study], is more lofty than those involved in hand-to-hand combat – the battle of Torah. And “he made it a <i>hok</i> [statute] and a <i>mishpat</i> [ordinance]” – this rule [of receiving a greater reward is when one supports those who produce] <i>hok</i> and <i>mishpat</i>, resulting from the battle of Torah.<sup>31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This great reward for the support of Torah study is reserved for those supporting others involved in pilpul to determine Halachah.</i> [In other words, pilpul is applied to formulate rules, represented by <i>hok</i>, and to use those rules to derive laws of practice, as represented by <i>mishpat</i>]<i> – end of Netziv’s addendum</i>).<sup>32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See how <i>hok</i> and <i>mishpat</i> are explained in Part 3, chapter 8.</i>",
                    "Truly, if the supporters [of Torah] would only realize the greatness produced by their acts, they would find the heart to perform them with more joy and generosity, enhancing their blessing even more.",
                    "This is stated in the <i>Midrash</i> [<i>Rabbah</i>] on the Book of Ruth: R. Yitzhak ben Merion said: “Scripture teaches us that if a person performs a mitzvah, he should perform it with a full heart. If Reuven had known that the Holy One, blessed be He, would write of him, ‘Reuven heard and saved him [Joseph] from their hand,’<sup>33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gen. 37:21.</i> he would have carried him on his shoulders and brought him to his father. And if Aharon had known that that the Holy One, blessed be He, would write of him, ‘Behold, he [Aharon] is going out to meet you [Moshe], and when he sees you he will rejoice in his heart,’<sup>34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ex. 4:14.</i> he [Aharon] would have gone out to greet him with drums and cymbals. Had Boaz known that the Holy One blessed be He would record of him, ‘He handed [Ruth] parched grain, and she ate and was satisfied and had some left over,’<sup>35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ruth 2:14.</i> he would have fed her fattened calves. R. Kohen and R. Yehoshua of Sichnin said in the name of R. Levi, “In the past, when a person performed a mitzvah, the prophets would record it. However, now when a person performs a mitzvah, who will record it? Eliyahu will record it, and it will be sealed by the hands of the Messiah and the Holy One, blessed be He. This is what Scripture states: ‘Then those who fear the Lord spoke to one another,<sup>36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, Eliyahu speaks with the Messiah.</i> and the Lord listened and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before Him for those who fear the Lord and those who give thought to His Name.’”<sup>37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mal. 3:16.</i>",

As it says, ‘For to sit in the shelter of wisdom is to sit in the shelter of money,’ and [Scripture also] states, ‘It is a tree of life to those who grasp it, and its supporters are praiseworthy.’”<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Prov. 3:18.</i> With some variation, this is also expressed in the <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> on the passage of <i>Kedoshim.</i><sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Vayikra Rabbah,</i> <i>Parasha</i> 25, “The Holy One, blessed be He, will in the future prepare a shelter and canopies for the possessors of mitzvos [who perform charity], next to the possessors of Torah in the Garden of Eden; and he has three verses to support him: 1) ‘To sit in the shelter of wisdom is to sit in the shelter of money’ (Eccl. 7:12); 2) ‘Happy is the man who observes this [the Torah], and the son of man who strengthens her’ (Isa. 56:2); and the present one, ‘She is a tree of life to those grasp her, and her supporters are praiseworthy’ (Prov. 3:18).”</i>",
                    "At first blush, one can ask a strong question: why do we need a special proof for this mitzvah of strengthening the Torah more than any other mitzvah that would be included in the rule derived by R. Akiva in the above-mentioned mishnah?<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That anyone who assists another in the performance of a mitzvah receives an equal reward.</i>",
                    "However, it is relevant to know that <i>tzel</i> (“shade”) and <i>huppah</i> (“canopy”) refer to honor, as similar language is used in Isaiah 4:<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verses 5 and 6.</i> “For more than any honor shall be a canopy, and a booth for shade in the day-time [to protect one] from the heat.” The meaning is that even though two different people can perform the same mitzvah in an equal manner and receive the same reward in the World of Rewards (Gan Eden), nevertheless, their honor is dissimilar. For one’s honor is dependent on the totality of his actions and his conduct in the World of Living, which essentially is the attire that he will wear in the Heavenly World. Just as it is shameful for a man who is distinguished to sit in a lowly seat and wear ordinary clothing, so does shame envelop the face of ordinary men who sit in esteemed places and wear formal attire, receiving honor for a transitory act that it is incompatible with his character. This is what is written in chapter 2<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 16.</i> of Habakkuk, when speaking of Nebuchadnezzar, “You are filled with shame instead of glory.” This means that because of their fear of Nebuchadnezzar, they honored him more than was acceptable to his soul and this is why there was “shame instead of glory.” It is written in chapter 3 of Proverbs,<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 35.</i> “The wise shall inherit honor, but as for the fools, they carry away shame.” This means that the wise inherit honor, for it is appropriate and acceptable to them. However, when honor arrives for the foolish it brings them shame, for those who sit at the gates [in the marketplace] speak of how unworthy they are to receive that honor. Similar to the honor for vanities in this world is the honor [to be received from] God in the World to Come – in other words, it is unacceptable to one unless it matches his general strength [of achievements]. This is stated in Tractate <i>Bava Basra</i> 75a, [that in the World to Come, God will make everyone a canopy corresponding to what they deserve], and “each one will be burned because of the canopy of his friend.” Each one will perceive himself as being unworthy of this honor, to benefit from the light emanating from the Face of the Living King in a manner equal to his fellow. Behold, the Kingdom of the Firmament is like the earthly kingdom: just as we see how the king grants honor to a man of valor who deserves the reward of receiving a title of officer of the army or leader of battle, so it may be said that they are the bearers of his kingdom and upon them depends the kingdom’s strength and splendor. It is because of this that he gives them citations of power and splendor, proportional to how each one has excelled in battle. Such is the kingdom of the Holy One, blessed be He, which uplifts those who fight the battle of Torah. It is for this reason that the [Torah] is referred to as a sword, as stated in Tractate <i>Shabbos</i> 60<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I found it on 63a.</i> regarding the verse, “Gird your sword upon your thigh, O mighty one, your glory and your majesty”<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 45:5.</i> – that the simple meaning of this verse pertains to the study of Torah. Just as His Kingdom, may He be blessed, is uplifted through those who meditate on [the Torah], so she [the Torah] provides strength and glory to those [who study her], as it is written, “Strength and glory are her clothing,”<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Prov. 31:25.</i> – the glory of God is reserved particularly for the Talmud scholar. This is stated in Tractate <i>Bava Basra</i> 8b, “What does Scripture say of the rabbis? Ravina answered: ‘Those who love Him are like the sun when he goes forth in his might.<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Judges 5:31.</i>’ “The sun represents honor,” as Psalms states,<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">84:12.</i> “A sun and a shield is the Lord God. The Lord bestows favor and glory; He withholds no goodness from those who walk in perfect innocence.” This means that Divine Providence is comparable to the sun, as it bestows favor and glory similar to the way the sun illuminates a [particular] thing [causing it] to be [viewed] more favorably than any other, even though [the two things] may be truly similar. See Part 1, chapter 14, of <i>Kadmas Ha’amek</i> for an explanation of this verse.",
                    "With this explanation, we can now understand [the Sages’] above-mentioned statement in <i>Pesahim</i>: [“Whoever puts merchandise into the purses of Torah scholars merits to sit in the heavenly academy, as it is said: ‘To sit in the shelter of wisdom is to sit in the shelter of money.’”] [This statement] teaches us the greatness of the honor for those who enable [others to study] Torah, for they receive the honor of the Talmudic sages themselves. It is therefore proper that [the sages] cited a proof from the verse, “To sit in the shelter of wisdom is to sit in the shelter of money,” for this verse was quoted by the Jerusalem Talmud, cited previously, along with the verse, “It is a tree of life to those who grasp it, and its supporters are <i>meushar</i>” (praiseworthy). The connotation of <i>ishur</i> [praiseworthy] is the receipt of praise from others. (<i>Netziv’s addendum</i> – One can now answer the question I raised above – what does R. Yohanan add when he describes the reward of those who support Torah? The [above-mentioned mishnah in] Tractate <i>Makkos</i> [already] teaches that those who support others who perform mitzvos receive the same reward as those who perform the mitzvah itself.",
                    "However, this question can be answered according to what we have explained. One first needs to realize that even though it is impossible to conceive [what] the reward in the World to Come is – as Scripture states, “The eye has never seen it,” and so on<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isa. 64:3.</i> – nevertheless, we can still compare it to a prize awarded by a kingdom to those deserving commendation. Behold, there are two types of rewards dispensed by a kingdom: One is awarded to those who excel in governmental affairs. To such a person the king gives a gift such as money and the like; this does not involve any type of glory at all. The second type [of reward], however, is [reserved for] the one who serves with his sword, performing acts of valor in battle – the king promotes such a person to general, and this is a more exemplary honor.",
                    "It is similar with the rewards for performing the mitzvos. Though it may bring pleasure, [it] lacks the glory of sitting in the heavenly academy. This does not apply to the Talmudic scholar who sits in the heavenly academy. Now, regarding [the reward for] performing the mitzvos, it is obvious that every person is able to accomplish this; similar to how every person can receive a reward for serving a king of flesh and blood. [One might think] that this would not be so with the reward [reserved] for the Talmudic scholar who studies in the heavenly academy, for certainly not everyone is worthy to receive [this honor], just as it would be impossible for every man of valor to be awarded [with a promotion] to the position of general.",
                    "Therefore, from our mishnah [in Tractate <i>Makkos</i>] we would only know of the reward [reserved] for those who assist others to perform <i>mitzvos.</i> It is unlike the [reward for the] supporters of Torah. We would not know that [they could receive the reward of glory], for [even] if it were possible for them to sit in the Heavenly Court, they would not understand the discussions, and it would thus be “shame instead of glory.” This is why R. Yohanan teaches that he will be able to sit in the “shade” of wisdom and will receive the power to comprehend the [Heavenly Court’s] discussions. – <i>end of Netziv’s addendum.</i>)",
                    "<small><b>Translator’s note:</b> The Netziv will be citing a proof from the Talmudic discussions of Todos of Rome regarding how one is rewarded in this world when one supports Torah study. Tractate Pesahim states that Todos, against rabbinical decree, instructed his community to eat roasted meat on Pesah night. The Talmud then questions why the rabbis did not excommunicate him.</small><br>One may add that we can infer from the above mentioned Tractate <i>Pesahim,</i> that the future Godly honor one will attain in the World to Come, i.e., to sit in the shade and canopy of the Talmudic scholar and to sit in the Heavenly Court, is partially reflected<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The words literally mean “sparks.”</i> in this world [as well]. Tractate <i>Pesahim </i>[on 53b], inquires: “Was Todos of Rome a great man, or was he a powerful and violent man?” It derives that [he was a great man based] on a proof from a <i>baraisa:</i> This teaching as well did Todos of Rome expound: “What did Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah see that caused them to throw themselves into the fiery furnace for the sanctification of God’s name? They applied to themselves a <i>kal va-homer</i> from the [plague] of the frogs [in Egypt]. Pertaining to the frogs, which are not commanded to sanctify God’s name, it is written, ‘The river shall swarm with frogs and they shall ascend and come into your place… and into your ovens and into your kneading bowls.’ When are kneading bowls next to an oven? I would say at the moment that the oven is hot. So we, who are being commanded to fulfill the mitzvah of sanctifying God’s name, [should be willing to throw ourselves into the flames].’ R. Yosi ben Avin said, “Todos would put merchandise into the purses of Talmudic scholars, for R. Yohanan said: ‘Whoever puts merchandise into the purses of Talmudic scholars merits to sit in the heavenly academy, as Scripture states: “To sit in the shelter of wisdom is to sit in the shelter of money.’”",
                    "This [Talmudic statement] appears incomprehensible. The Gemara proved that [the Rabbis refrained from excommunicating Todos] not [because he was] a violent and powerful man, but because he was a great man. He taught exegesis in public, so it would be appropriate to prove that he [possessed qualities beyond] one who was [merely] wealthy and a philanthropist. For what right does a wealthy person have to teach exegesis in public, as it does not relate to his power in wisdom? Rather, one must say, [just as one who supports the Torah] has the merit to sit in the heavenly academy and can understand their discussions and thus not sit there in embarrassment, so also, even in this world, he receives help from Heaven to originate and apply exegesis in certain matters. [Just] like a Talmudic scholar [who, because of his toil, receives assistance from Heaven to analyze and derive halacha], so at times does the one [who supports the scholars] receive Heavenly support to apply exegesis in his moment [of opportunity as determined by God]; [not because of his] toil, [but] rather [due to his acts of kindness]<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The added words are taken from what the Netziv writes in <i>Harhev Davar</i> to Num. 21:20.</i>, resulting in Heavenly support to achieve honor and joy through the utterances of his mouth.",
                    "This is the parable written [in Proverbs],<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">31:24.</i> “She makes linen garments and sells them, and gives girdles to the merchant.” This parable is referring to one who possesses equipment to weave large and small linen garments (“linen garments” refer to large garments, whereas “girdles” refer to small ones), even the small ones are sold for their full value. When [a merchant] acquires much merchandise at its market value, it is common practice that in [appreciation] of this purchase, the manufacturer will give [the merchant] a girdle as a gift. This is the understanding of this parable, as it is written, “She makes linen garments and <i>sells</i> them,” meaning, the [larger linen garments] are never received as a gift, whereas, [she] “<i>gives </i>girdles to the merchant” since he has purchased much. It is well known that Tractate <i>Yevamos</i> 63b states that the Torah is compared to a valorous woman [and thus the woman described in Proverbs as making linens and girdles is representative of the Torah]. This parable is to be understood [to be addressing] two types of novelties in the Torah. One [type, represented by the linens], is an extensive matter encompassing deep topics in halachah, whereas there is another matter, [represented by the girdles], being of minimal scope, like understanding a particular verse or topic as the issue arises. Behold, even minimal matters do not come to man other than as a payment for his toil [in Torah study in other areas]. Such are the commodities of Torah, as it states in <i>Shemos Rabbah, parasha</i> 28, “[The verse], ‘You have received gifts among men,’ [teaches us] that it [the Torah] was given to him [Moshe] for a price.<sup>20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word “price” is explained by the commentaries to refer to the forty days and nights during which Moshe neither ate, drank nor slept.</i> [The Proverbs parable is stating], he who toils greatly in [the study] of a matter in halachah, is like a great merchant in [the goods of] the Torah, and the Torah thus gives him [insights] into minimal matters without the need to toil; this is a gift provided with the assistance of God. (This is the merit and assistance that is also achieved by the one who places merchandise in the purse of the Talmud scholar and sits in the shade of the Torah).",
                    "Along these same lines, R. Yosi ben Avin stated, “Todos would put merchandise into the purses of Talmud scholars.” [Since he performed this mitzvah,] Divine assistance rested upon him, enabling him to reach [the level] of applying exegesis to the verse appropriate to the subject that presented itself at that time.",
                    "I would like to add, (being no matter not alluded to in the Torah of Moshe), this [concept is alluded] in the explanation of the verse in the <i>parasha</i> of <i>Shemini</i>, “Moshe said, ‘This is the <i>davar</i> [thing] that God has commanded you to do; the glory of God will then appear to you.’”<sup>21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lev. 9:6.</i> The general understanding of the verse calls for further explanation – the congregation had already fulfilled Moshe’s directive, [as the previous verse states]: “They took what Moshe had commanded to the front of the Tent of Meeting; and the entire congregation approached and stood before the Lord.” The only remaining item [to be done] was Aharon’s act [of the sin-offering calf], so what did Moshe add by telling them “to perform”? (The <i>Toras Kohanim</i> has already addressed this question with lengthy exegesis, and I have, with God’s will, expounded on this [verse] in my compilation <i>Ha’amek Davar</i>.) Tractate <i>Yoma</i> 5b states that we infer from this verse that even the reading of the <i>parasha</i> of the <i>miluim</i> [inaugural service] is essential, for “this is the <i>davar </i>(matter)” is explained to mean “this is the <i>dibbur </i>(speech).” However, the meaning of Moshe telling them <i>la’asos</i>, “to perform” remains unclear. [This may be answered by applying the definition of <i>la’asos</i>, as described in Chapter 8, to mean “analyze deeply” to enhance the Torah]. Moshe stated to those who stood and waited, anticipating the revelation of God’s glory through the sacrifices that they were told to bring: if they “analyze” His <i>dibbur</i>, one with toil and another by supporting [those who analyze the Torah], then the glory of the Lord will appear to everyone. Even without the agency of the sacrifices they will grasp the glory of the Lord, each one according to his degree [of performance]. Although there is much more that one may learn through additional explanation and exegesis, it is reserved for my above-mentioned compilation as decreed by God, blessed be He."
