                    "Nevertheless, it is certainly not likely to say that the inauguration (<i>miluim</i>) of Aharon and his sons is a commandment that is practiced for all the generations, any more than the sacrifices of the dedication of the altar. So at first glance, the words of our rabbi, the Gaon, may his memory be blessed, are very surprising! However after some analysis, this does not appear to be the path to the intent of our rabbi, the Gaon, may his memory be blessed. Rather he has a different approach regarding this matter. As certainly the essence of the section of the inauguration – whether those [sacrifices] which they were commanded to sacrifice for the priests, those which they were commanded to sacrifice to prepare the altar or the sacrifices that the chieftains sacrificed for the dedication of the altar – were all, according to his opinion, a temporary instruction, and not [to be] practiced for all the generations, as is explained in sever places. And the Rashbatz, may his memory be blessed, cited many of them (in Zohar HaRikiyah there). Rather that which our rabbi, the Gaon, may his memory be blessed, counted the inauguration of Aharon and his sons here [among the commandments] is a completely different matter. And it is based upon that which we learned (in a mishnah) in the chapter [entitled] HaTodah (Menachot 78a), “The inauguration [offerings] would come like the matzah in the thanksgiving offering: Loaves, wafers, and poached.” And we said about it [in the Gemara], “From where are these matters derived? […] It is as Rav Nachman bar Rav Chisda expounded in the name of Rabbi Tavla, ‘This is the offering of Aharon and of his sons, which they shall bring to the Lord on the day when he is anointed’ (Leviticus 6:13). And what have we learned with regard to his sons from the day that he was anointed? Rather, it compares [their] dedication with his anointment. Just as when he is anointed it is poached, so too during [their] dedication it is poached.” See there. And Rashi explained, and these are his words: And what have we learned with regard to his sons from the day that he was anointed – are his sons obligated anything on account of their father’s anointment? Rather it compares a common priest’s dedication to [Aharon’s] anointment,<b> so his dedication is his inauguration. Hence in an inauguration, it is poached.</b> As a common priest brings <i>chavitin</i> – meaning poached – on the day of his dedication, and a high priest brings it every day. So too were the oil bread loaves (Leviticus 8:26) that were in the inauguration also poached. To here are his words. See there. It is understood from his words that that which the common priest is commanded to bring a dedication offering on the day that he first draws near to the service of the Temple – as we say there later close to this – is from the laws of inauguration. For his dedication is his inauguration. And that is why we learn from this comparison, in which his dedication is compared to [Aharon’s] appointment, such that his anointment is his anointment for the high priesthood. As from then on, he has obligated himself to bring the <i>chavitin</i> offering every day, which are poached. So too with the dedication of the common priest, when he is first dedicated for [the Temple] service, his tenth of flour is poached. And so we also hear from this that the oil bread loaves that are written about in the section about the inauguration were also poached. That is because the dedication of a common priest for all the generations is also only from the laws of inauguration. And just like his tenth of flour that he is commanded to bring as his dedication offering for all the generations is poached – as we understand from this comparison – so too can we say about the oil bread loaves of the inauguration of the tabernacle, that they were poached. And even though the law of the inauguration for all the generations – meaning the dedication – was different in several things from the laws of the dedication of the tabernacle; nevertheless, we equate them in what it is possible to equate them, given that they are both inaugurations. And also the Rambam, may his memory be blessed, explains this teaching exactly like the explanation of Rashi, may his memory be blessed (see Commentary to the Mishnah, Mishnah 7:2). And see what is written in the Mishneh LeMelekh (at the end of the Laws of the Vessels of the Temple, Chapter 5), see there in particular. And in the commentary of Rabbenu Gershom, the light of the exile, may his memory be blessed, he explains even more than this there: That even anointment [of any high priest] is only from the laws of the inauguration. For the high priest is also obligated to bring a tenth of flour on the day of his anointment to the high priesthood for his dedication, as we say there later. And that is from the laws of the inauguration. And the dedication of a common priest is compared to the dedication of the high priest, concerning it being poached. And again we learn from it, that just like for all the generations – that is the dedication of the high priest and the common priest – was poached; so too was the inauguration of the tabernacle, about which it is written, “oil bread loaves,” poached. See his words there. It is true that the Shita Mekubetzet challenges the explanation of Rashi from a baraita in Torat Kohanim – as it is explained there that the dedication offering is not poached – such that he stretches to explain [the Gemara] here not like the explanation of Rashi, may his memory be blessed. Yet the Rambam, may his memory be blessed, had already anticipated his challenge; and that is why he rejected that baraita in the Torat Kohanim from being the law, on account of its contradicting our Talmud. And this is as the Mishneh LeMelekh wrote there. In any event, we see that both Rabbenu Gershom, light of the exile, and the Rambam, may his memory be blessed also explained the discussion [in the Gemara] like the explanation of Rashi, may his memory be blessed.
