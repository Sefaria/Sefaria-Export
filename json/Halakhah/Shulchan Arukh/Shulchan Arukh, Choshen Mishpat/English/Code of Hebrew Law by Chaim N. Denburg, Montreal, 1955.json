            "Nowadays<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">e., after the dissolution of the Jewish Commonwealth. Derived from Git. 88b; B.K. 84b; San. 2b-3a, according to which non-<i>Mumḥin</i> (v. <i>infra.</i> n. 13) may adjudicate cases of admissions and transaction of loans which are matters of frequent occurrence and involve a monetary loss, thereby carrying out the commission of the <i>Sanhedrin</i> of the Land of Israel. The present ruling applies today to the Land of Israel too. Cf. Git. <i>ibid., Tosa</i>f. s.v. <span>במלתא</span>. Thus also <i>Asheri</i> and <i>Tur.</i> The underlying reason for this law is given by the <i>Codifiers</i> as follows: <i>‘Judges and officers thou shalt make thee</i> in all thy gates <i>which the Lord thy G-d giveth thee</i> tribe by tribe (Deut. XVI, 18. This has reference to the Land of Israel only) — (this means that) in your gates (i.e., in Israel) tribunals should be set up in every district as well as in every city. However, outside the Land (of Israel) you should set up tribunals in every district but not in every city’ (Mak. 7a). This, of course, applied only to those times when the original form of ‘ordination’ (<i>Semikah</i>, <span>סמיכה</span>) was in vogue, but nowadays all judges have no authoritative power to adjudicate legal questions Biblically, as it is written, — <i>‘And these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them</i> (Ex. XXI, 1) — <i>before them</i> (i.e., authoritative judges, specially ordained) and not before non-<i>Mumḥin</i> (laymen judges)’ — Git. <i>ibid.</i> Consequently, today we merely act as agents of the former authoritative judges and deal only with matters of frequent occurrence which also involve a monetary loss (<i>Tur</i>) — <i>M.E.</i> On the question whether we carry out today the commission of the former duly ordained judges Rabbinically or Biblically, there is a difference of opinion among the <i>Codifiers. N</i> and <i>RaShBA</i> hold that our commission is Rabbinical. <i>Nethiboth</i> maintains that it is Biblical.</i> the Judges may adjudicate cases of admissions<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Heb. <span>הודאות</span> admissions. This refers to proceedings resting on evidence of witnesses attesting to the defendant’s admission of his indebtedness. <span>הלוואות</span> transaction of loans has reference to evidence offered by witnesses who were present at the time of the transaction of the loan. Today the judges may also deal with cases where there are no witnesses, e.g., where one has to take a consuetudinal or equitable oath (<span>שבועת היסת</span> i.e., if one who is sued for a debt denies the latter entirely (<span>כופר הכל</span>) in contradistinction to the legal or Biblical oath which is required when the defendant admits a part of the claim (<span>מודה במקצת</span>), it being presumed that nobody will go to law unless he have a claim. Consequently, it is a matter of equity to put the opponent to an oath, to which he may in turn put the claimant — <i>M.E.</i></i> and transaction of loans,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Heb. <span>הודאות</span> admissions. This refers to proceedings resting on evidence of witnesses attesting to the defendant’s admission of his indebtedness. <span>הלוואות</span> transaction of loans has reference to evidence offered by witnesses who were present at the time of the transaction of the loan.

Consequently, it is a matter of equity to put the opponent to an oath, to which he may in turn put the claimant — <i>M.E.</i></i> marriage contracts,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Containing among other things, the settlement of a certain amount due to the wife on her husband’s death or on being divorced. Heb. <i>Kethubah</i> (<span>כתובה</span>), — the wife’s settlement.</i> inheritances,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus <i>Asheri</i> and <i>Tur</i> derived from San. 3a, <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>שלא</span>.</i> gifts<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus <i>Asheri</i> and <i>Tur</i> derived from San. 3a, <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>שלא</span>.</i> and damage done to another person's chattel,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> V, 9 derived from B.K. <i>ibid.</i></i> which are matters that are of frequent occurrence and involve a monetary loss;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the case of ‘inheritances’ and ‘gifts’ which are of frequent occurrence there is also the possibility of a loss involved, for no doubt the claimant must have rendered some service to the bequeather or the donor (Thus <i>A.H.</i>). The underlying reason in the case of admissions and the transaction of loans is ‘in order not to shut the door against borrowers’ (<span>שלא תנעול דלת בפני לווין</span>). For a creditor will refuse to grant a loan should he find it difficult to collect his debt. The same reason applies to the other matters enumerated here. This (viz., that we deal only with matters of frequent occurrence which involve a monetary loss) has reference only to monetary claims. But in the case of other important matters, such as, accepting converts, although it is of infrequent occurrence, or in the case of compelling an obstinate husband to grant his wife a divorce although it does not involve a monetary loss, the law is that we may deal with such cases — <i>M.E.</i></i> but matters that are not of frequent occurrence although they involve a monetary loss,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yad <i>ibid.</i></i> e.g., cattle that injured other [cattle],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As a result of goring with the ‘horn’ (<span>קרן</span>) which is of infrequent occurrence. This, of course, refers not only to damage caused by ‘horn’ but also to all other types of injury or damage of infrequent occurrence (e.g., damage caused by ‘fire’ and ‘pit’ (<span>אש זבור</span>) — <i>Shak.</i>  Mishna B.K. I,  <i>P.Tesh.,</i> however, cites authorities who permit a Jewish Court today to deal in matters pertaining to damage caused by ‘fire’ and ‘pit’). This form of damage is called <span>חבלה</span>. Hence, the term <span>שחבלה</span> used here. In the case of damage or injury which is of frequent occurrence and involves a monetary loss, the legal term used is <span>היזק</span>.  <i>infra</i> par. 3 — <i>M.E.</i></i> or matters that do not involve a monetary loss although they are of frequent occurrence,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yad <i>ibid.</i></i> e.g., the repayment of the double amount,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">e., the additional amount to be paid as fine on restoring stolen goods (Ex. XXII, 3; 6-8). This is derived from San. 8a where it is stated that cases of fine must be dealt with by three authoritative Judges (<i>Mumḥin</i>), but not laymen Judges. The repayment of the double amount (<span>תשלומי כפל</span>), it may be asked, in any case belongs to the category of fines (<span>קנסות</span>) mentioned anon, and the payment thereof is collected only by authoritative judges (<i>Mumḥin</i>)? Furthermore, <i>Tur</i> has <span>בושת</span> i.e., payment for indignity suffered which is of frequent occurrence although there is no monetary loss involved. Likewise, in the foregoing example of matters of infrequent occurrence although there is no monetary loss involved, <i>Tur</i> has ‘e.g., if a man injured another man’ instead of <i>Caro</i>’s example (following <i>Maim.</i> in Yad <i>ibid.</i>) ‘cattle that injured other cattle’. The difficulty may be removed if we understand our text as follows: First <i>Caro</i> states examples (e.g., the repayment of the double amount and cattle that injured other cattle) which are specifically of a penal nature (<span>קנס</span>) and then the general proviso, ‘and likewise all fines’ which the Rabbis equated to these examples. Consequently, the examples cited by <i>Tur</i> are included in the general statement concerning fines — <i>M.E.</i></i> and likewise, all fines that were imposed by the Sages,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">B.K. <i>ibid.</i> dealing with a case where R. Ḥisda consulted R. Naḥman and the latter replied, ‘Ḥisda, Ḥisda, are you really prepared to order the collection of fines in Babylon?’ Cf. also B.K. 27b.

Cf. <i>infra</i> § 420, 4 <i>Caro</i> adopts <i>Maim.</i> (Yad <i>ibid.</i>) explanation of <span>תוקע</span>; <i>Isserless</i> accepts the explanation of <i>Rashi</i> and <i>RaN</i> (v. B.K. 90a and Kid. 11b, <i>Rashi</i> s.v. <span>התוקע</span> and cf. <i>RaN ibid.</i>). , B.K. 84b, <i>Rashi</i> s.v. <span>ופגם</span> whence it is implied that if the amount is not definitive it is not regarded as a fine. Yet, since it is of infrequent occurrence and does not involve a monetary loss, we cannot order its collection. The Rabbis, however, called it <span>קנס</span> (fine) because the law thereof is similar to fines. Cf. B.K. 27b, 84b, <i>Tosaf</i>, s.v. <span>קנסא</span> — <i>M.E.</i></i> — and thus also whosoever pays more than the actual damage done, or one who pays half-damages,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">B.K. 15b, 27b; Ket. 41b and v. <i>Tur.</i> E.g., the repayment of the double amount (Ex.

V, 16, 24; XXVII, 27), or half-damages done by an innocuous animal (<span>תם</span>), i.e., an animal that did not gore three times and did injury before warning had been given, opp. <span>מועד</span> (Ex.

Although there is a monetary loss involved, yet since this is of infrequent occurrence, Judges nowadays cannot order the payment thereof (v. par. 1).

Liability for blemish applies only in the case of rape (v. E.H. § 177). Blemish stands on an equal footing as injury (v. B.K. <i>ibid., Rashi</i> s.v. <span>ופגם</span>). It may, however, be asked, why blemish (<span>פגם</span>) which is of frequent occurrence and involves a monetary loss (B.K. <i>ibid.</i>) should not be adjudicated today? This difficulty may be removed if we realize that ‘frequent occurrence’ of blemish applies only to the assessment, i.e., we know how to determine the liability of blemish (the difference in valuation between a virgin <span>בתולה</span> and a non-virgin <span>בעולה</span>), but the actual <i>act</i> of rape is of infrequent occurrence — <i>M.E.</i></i> indignity,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tur citing Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> V, 10.

Mish.; B.Yos.; MaHaRIK</i> Rt. 1 a.o.) as referring to ‘injury’ (<span>נזק</span>) only, which, it is true, involves a monetary loss, but is of infrequent occurrence (v. <i>supra</i> n. 19). Hence, Raba’s dictum does not include ‘loss of time’ and ‘healing.’ Consequently, payment may be ordered by a Jewish Court today for the latter. Thus also <i>Isserlein</i> in his <i>Decisions</i> (<span>פסקים</span>) — that nowadays we may order payment for ‘healing’ and ‘loss of time’ and likewise impose a fine upon the offender. <i>Asheri</i> and <i>Alfasi</i>, however, hold that payment for the latter are not ordered today. Raba’s dictum is explained by them to refer to anything that requires valuation (<span>כל הנישום</span>). <i>Caro</i>, however, accepts the opinion of <i>Maim.</i> since it is supported by the <i>Geoninm</i> (Yad <i>ibid.</i>). Thus also <i>Hag.

Glos.</i> Thus also, [with respect to] one who stole or robbed<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to the unlawful acquisition of chattels by violence. Cf. Lev.

Hence, only the principal may be collected. , also B.K. 115a where such cases were dealt with in Babylon and B.K. 96b in the case of the man who misappropriated a pair of oxen and B.K. 21a in the case of a certain person who built a villa on the ruins that belonged to orphans and when R. Naḥman advised the defendant to make a peaceful settlement with the orphans, he refused to do so, whereupon R. Naḥman confiscated the villa. Cf. also <i>ibid.</i> 37a and 4b. In the latter reference it is stated that theft (<span>גניבה</span>) and larceny (<span>גזילה</span>) involve civil liability. A difficulty, however, presents itself, viz., in the Mishna San. I, 1 and Gemara <i>ibid.</i> 3a we are told that cases of larceny are dealt with by <i>Mumḥin</i> Judges only, which contradicts the present ruling. <i>Tosaf.</i> (ibid. s.v. <span>שלא</span>; B.K. 84b s.v. <span>אי נמי</span>; Git. 88b s.v. <span>אי הכי</span>) explain that the Mishna <i>ibid.</i> refers to cases of larceny by means of injury inflicted (<span>גזילות ע״י חבלות</span>), in which case only <i>Mumḥin</i> Judges may adjudicate the matter. Hence, in such cases of larceny we nowadays cannot act as the agents of the former authoritative Judges, since this is a matter of infrequent occurrence, but cases of larceny where no bodily injury resulted we may act as the agents of the former. Thus also <i>Kes. Mish.</i> and <i>B.Yos. N.Yos.,</i> however, removes the above difficulty as follows: <i>Caro’s</i> ruling that we may order the payment of the principal in cases of larceny refers only to matters of frequent occurrence, such as, one who denies a deposit (v. <i>Gloss</i> anon), but actual larceny is of infrequent occurrence. Hence, it is not adjudicated today (v. <i>D.M.</i> a.l.). <i>ShaK</i> advances a different opinion, viz., that in San. <i>ibid.</i> we deal with the adjudication of fines, e.g., the repayment of the double amount, the four and five-fold restitution, which require only <i>Mumḥin</i> Judges (v. <i>supra</i> par. 1 and notes), but the actual principal is recoverable even by laymen Judges (this is however, a stained interpretation, since the payment of the double etc., refers to cases of theft but not to larceny — <i>Ba’er Heteb</i>). <i>ShaK</i> also writes that the increment (<span>שבח</span>) of the misappropriated article prior to the owner’s resignation, is also recoverable today <i>contra BaḤ. RaN</i> and <i>N</i> offer an altogether different explanation in removing the above difficulty, viz., that as to San. <i>ibid.</i> that requires <i>Mumḥin</i> in cases of larceny, it has reference only to the period when such Judges were available, but if, as today, <i>Mumḥin</i> are no longer available, even laymen Judges may deal with such matters. Thus also <i>Nethiboth, K.H.</i> and <i>Tummim.</i> Otherwise, the earth will become full of violence — <i>A.H.</i></i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>And some say</i> [<i>that this applies</i>] <i>only to cases of larceny that are of</i> <i>frequent occurrence, e.g.,</i> [<i>a guardian</i>] <i>who denies</i> [<i>having received</i>] <i>a deposit and the like, but actual larceny is not</i> [<i>considered</i>] <i>of frequent occurrence and they do not adjudicate</i> [<i>this</i>] <i>unless the robbed object is</i> [<i>still</i>] <i>intact</i>, [<i>in which case</i>] <i>they order</i> [<i>him</i>] <i>to return it</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>N.Yos.</i> to B.K. 84b — <i>G.</i> , previous note.</i>",
            "[With respect to] the laws of damage caused indirectly,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">B.K. 98b; Ket. 86a where it is related that in the case of an action for damage caused indirectly, Rafram (in accord with R. Meir <i>ibid.</i> 100a) compelled R. Ashi, who in his childhood had destroyed by burning, the bond of a creditor, to make payment ‘like a beam fit for decorative mouldings,’ i.e., a proverbial expression for ‘straight and exact’ and out of the best of one’s estate (v. <i>ibid.</i> 5a), whence we see that payment for indirect damage (<span>גרמי</span>) may be collected even by laymen Judges outside the Land of Israel, and such payment is not regarded as a fine (<span>קנס</span>). , Yad <i>Ḥobel u-Mazzik</i> VII, 9. There are three expressions used in Talmudical terminology with reference to different categories of damage that require elucidation, viz., a) <span>היזק שאינו ניכר</span> — damage not discernible in the object itself, such as, leavened matter over which Passover has passed (which had been in the house during Passover) that becomes forbidden for use after Passover, although the damage is not evident here; b) <span>דינא דגרמי</span> — indirect damage which is discernible and is not the result of any action performed, such as, in the case of the fence of a vineyard that has been broken down and the owner of the adjoining cornfield requires the owner of the vineyard to restore it. If the owner of the vineyard neglects the matter and does not restore it, he thereby causes his neighbour’s produce to become forfeit (Deut.

In other words, they are proven to have been ‘schemers’ or ‘plotters,’ and they are punished by the law of retaliation (Deut. XIX, 16ff.). According to <i>W.G., Isserles</i> mentions this ruling here, since as in the aforementioned law of the ‘informer’ damage is caused by mere speech without tangible action (this is also apparent in <i>Mord</i>. to B.K. VIII, the source of this ruling) <i>contra M.E.</i> who writes that <i>Isserles</i> states this here as an independent law.</i> <i>and they</i> [<i>the Judges</i>] <i>had</i> [<i>already</i>] <i>collected payment on</i> [<i>the strength of</i>] <i>their testimony</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This applies only if money had already been collected on their testimony, although the principle, <i>as he had purposed to do</i> (Deut. <i>ibid.</i>) and not <i>as he had done</i> (v. Ḥul. 11b, <i>Rashi</i> s.v. <span>אין נהרגין</span> and <i>Torah Temimah ibid.</i>) would imply that only if the money had not yet been collected from the person against whom they plotted is payment exacted from th <i>Zomemim</i> witnesses, but not if payment had been ordered and paid, — nevertheless, in civil liability (as in the present case) the above principle (which is of a penal nature) is not applicable (v. B.K. 4b, <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>עדים</span>). The reason why the example of <span>הזמה</span> (the refutation of the witnesses by another set of witnesses by proving an <i>alibi</i>, e.g., ‘How can you offer this testimony, if, at the time you state that the alleged offence was committed, you were present with us in another locality?’) is mentioned, and not the example of <span>הכחשה</span> (counter-evidence which contradicts the testimony of the first set of witnesses), is because in the latter case when two witnesses state that So-and-So borrowed money from So-and-So, as a result of which money was collected on their testimony, and subsequently, two other witnesses came and offered counterevidence, the former set of witnesses cannot be ordered to make payment, for we may say, that the evidence offered by the second set of witnesses does not carry more weight than that of the first set. Not so, however, if the witnesses are proven <i>Zomemim</i> (v. <i>infra</i> § 31, 38; § 46, 37) — <i>M.E.</i> , also <i>infra</i> § 28, 3, <i>Gloss</i>. However, if the testimony of the witnesses, who were subsequently proven <i>Zomemi</i>m, merely exempted the defendant from taking an oath, thereby causing damage to the claimant, — for if the defendant would have had to take an oath (which, now it appears would have been a false oath), he would have made payment instead of swearing falsely, — nevertheless, the <i>Zomemim</i> witnesses are not required to make restitution, for this is not considered a case of <span>דינא דגרמי</span> (indirect damage which is discernible. , <i>supra</i> n. 35) but rather belongs to the category of <span>גרמא בנזקין</span> (indirect damage which is not evident. , <i>ibid.</i>) — <i>P.Tesh.</i></i> <i>and it is impossible to recover</i> [<i>the payment now</i>],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">e., the claimant who received payment on the testimony of the witnesses who were proven <i>Zommim</i>, had already spent the money.</i> — [<i>the law is that</i>] <i>they judge them and order them to pay</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Mord</i>. to B.K.

This, however, does not have reference to cases which involve the payment of the double amount or the four or five-fold restitution — <i>M.E., ShaK, RaShaL. ‘Ir Shushan</i> writes that when the defendant is placed under the ban, which is lifted only after he appeases the plaintiff by compensating the latter for the damage, such compensation must include not only an approximate amount of the actual damages suffered but also of the payment of the double and the four and five-fold restitution. <i>M.E.</i> rejects this ruling because as stated above the injurer is placed under the ban only in the case where there is no additional payment of fines.</i> and as soon as he<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The injurer.</i> gives him an amount which appears reasonable [to the injurer to be given] to him, they release him<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The injurer.</i> [from the ban],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This does not refer to an exact amount corresponding to the damage but rather to an approximate amount. Thus also <i>Tur</i> on the authority of <i>R. Sherira Gaon, Asheri</i> and <i>Alfasi</i>. This explains the words, ‘they release him (from the ban),’ i.e., although the injured person demands full payment. This also follows from the <i>Gloss</i> of <i>Isserles</i>, ‘whether his litigant was appeased etc.’ The following words, however, ‘if the injured person seized an amount etc.,’ refers to seizure of the full amount. The latter statement has reference to a seizure that also compensates the injured person with respect to the payment of the double amount or the four or five-fold restitution. Biblically, one who admits an act with which a fine is connected, is exempt from the fine (<span>מודה בקנס פטור</span> v. Ket. 43a). But the admission must be made in the presence of a Court duly ordained (v. <i>supra</i> par. 1, n. 1). Hence, nowadays the defendant’s admission would not exempt him from the additional fine also seized by the claimant, save that the following distinction should be borne in mind, viz., that if the defendant admitted that witnesses were present during the time that the damage was done, he is still held responsible and his admission does not exempt him, but if no witnesses were present at that time, the claimant’s seizure of the additional amount corresponding to the fine is not valid — <i>Nethiboth</i>. If the injurer died, we do not place his heir under the ban, for the main purpose of the Geonic enactment (v. <i>supra</i> n. 45) was that violent men should not be on the increase. Hence, the injurer only is placed under a ban but not his heir in the case of the former’s death — <i>Nethiboth</i> and <i>Tummim.</i></i> <i>whether his litigant was appeased</i> [<i>thereby</i>] <i>or whether he was not appeased</i>. And likewise, if the injured person seized an amount, [viz.,] whatever is proper for him to take, they do not reclaim [it] from him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Conclusion reached in B.K. 15b; Ket. 41b. This ruling applies even if the plaintiff seized an amount corresponding to the fine as well, for the law is that had we been permitted to adjudicate this matter today, the defendant would have paid an amount corresponding to the actual damage plus the fine. Consequently, the plaintiff’s seizure is considered valid. So also <i>Asheri</i> and <i>Tur</i> (<i>infra</i> § 349 end). , also <i>Isserles infra</i> § 348, 4 <i>Gloss. Caro</i> and <i>Isserles</i> state the law here without making a distinction as to whether the seizure was made at the time the damage was suffered or subsequent to that, or whether the chattel that caused the damage was seized by the injured person or other possessions of the injurer. <i>R. Tam</i> in <i>Tosaf.</i> to B.K. and Ket. <i>ibid.</i> s.v. <span>ואי תפס</span> holds that the plaintiff seized the animal that caused the damage, i.e., before it reached the owner’s hand. Thus <i>Hag. Maim.</i> to Yad <i>ibid.</i> This is substantiated by Ket. 84b according to which R. Tarfon maintains that the seizure of a man’s produce by a creditor is valid after the latter’s death, provided, — as Rab and Samuel explain — it lies in a heap in a public domain, i.e., in a place where <i>Meshikah</i> is possible. In other words, before it passes into the hands of the heirs. , <i>Hag. Derisha u-Perisha</i>. But other chattels cannot be seized by him. For if so, the plaintiff will continue to seize thereafter other items too, and we would not be able to dispossess him thereof, since this comes under the category of ‘fines’ which are not adjudicated today. <i>Asheri</i> on the other hand, maintains, that even other chattels, not necessarily the animal that caused the damage, may be seized. Should he seize more than his damage we may dispossess him of the surplus which does not come under the category of ‘fines’ since the adjudication will be for the surplus seizure which is permissible to be dealt with by the Judges. , also <i>RIDBaZ</i> to Yad <i>ibid.</i> who writes that were <i>R. Tam</i>’s explanation correct, the text should have stated <span>ואי תפסיה</span> i.e., ‘he seized it’ and would be referring to the tort-feasant animal or the like (v. B.K. and Ket. <i>ibid.</i>). Furthermore, the law is that the nuisance, in this case the animal, must be abated, as R. Nathan said, ‘Whence is it derived that a man should not breed a bad dog in his house? — From the text, <i>That thou bring not blood upon thy house</i> (Deut. XXII, 8).’ Hence, we see that <i>Caro</i> and <i>Isserles</i> in stating the law here adopt the opinion of <i>Asheri</i>. <i>Mord</i>. writes that if the damage was caused through ‘Horn’ we follow <i>R. Tam</i>, and in other cases of damage (e.g., cattle that caused damage to man even through ‘Tooth’ and ‘Foot’ which are of infrequent occurrence. Thus <i>K.H.</i>) we adopt the opinion of <i>Asheri</i>. In the case of an ‘innocuous animal’ (<i>Tam.</i> , Glos.) that caused damage, some say that the seizure is valid only if the plaintiff seized the animal proper, for the owner of such an animal pays only half-damages and the payment is made out of the body of the tort-feasant animal (v. Mishna B.K. 34a) — <i>Nethiboth</i>. The seizure spoken of here refers to one made in accordance with Jewish Law but not if carried out through non-Jewish Law (<i>RaShaL</i>) — <i>ShaK. R.A.Eger</i>, however, writes that only ‘in the first instance’ (<span>לכתחילה</span>) is it forbidden to seize through a non-Jew, but if already done (<span>דיעבד</span>) the seizure is considered valid (thus implied in <i>RaShaL</i>, the source of this ruling. Cf. <i>infra</i> § 4 <i>Gloss</i>) — <i>P.Tesh.</i> If a guardian advances the plea of theft in the case of an article which was entrusted with him for safekeeping and took the ‘guardians’ oath’ (<span>שבועת השומרים</span>) after which it was discovered that he himself had stolen the deposited article, — the law is that if the plaintiff seized an amount including the payment of the double amount or the four or five-fold restitution, since nowadays one is not required to pay the latter, the reason being that the oath must be taken before a duly ordained Court comprised of <i>Mumḥin,</i> — the seizure is not valid — <i>ShaK, Nethiboth</i>.</i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>And if the injured</i> <i>person should say</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To the Judges.</i> <i>'Assess for me my damage so that I should know up to how much I should seize,' he is not obeyed</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For otherwise it would mean that we adjudicate penal cases. But whatever he is instructed to return to the injurer does not come under the category of penal matters, since he had already seized it himself. <i>RaShaL</i> rules in accord with <i>Alfasi</i> that with respect to anything which is of a civil and not of a penal nature save that it is of infrequent occurrence, we do obey him and assess the damage for him — <i>ShaK</i>.</i> <i>save that if he had already seized, they assess for him</i> [<i>his damage</i>] <i>and instruct him, 'So much you may keep</i> [<i>as your own</i>] <i>and so much you must return</i> [<i>to the injurer</i>].'<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tur</i> on the authority of <i>Asheri</i> to B.K. VIII and to B.K. I end — <i>G.</i> This is <i>contra MaHaRIW</i> who maintains that all that was seized by the claimant must be returned. <i>Isserles</i>, as can be seen, adopts the opinion of <i>Asheri</i> that only the surplus should be restored. <i>Asheri</i> and <i>Tur</i> also rule that if the plaintiff does not produce witnesses that he is entitled to the amount seized, he must return whatever he seized. <i>Isserles</i>, however, writes that this applies only if he seized in the presence of witnesses, but if the seizure was not in the presence of witnesses, and the defendant denies having incurred any damage, the claimant is believed on the principle of <i>Miggo</i> (a legal rule according to which a deponent’s statement is accepted as true on the ground that if he had intended to tell a lie, he might have invented one more advantageous to his case, viz., he might have said, ‘I did not seize at all’). , <i>infra</i> § 87, 30. This principle applies not only to claims of civil liability but also to those of a penal nature (<i>Mord</i>. to B.K. III; <i>Tur infra</i> § 399; <i>Isserles</i> and <i>‘Ir Shushan</i>) — <i>M.E. R. Mordekai ha-Lewi</i> (cited by <i>Tur ibid.</i>) states that the principle of <i>Miggo</i> is not valid in penal cases. Thus also <i>N.Yos.</i> to B.K. III end; <i>Mag. Mish.</i> to Yad, <i>Nizke Mamon</i> IX end. In the case where the injurer died, the seizure of the orphans’ money or chattels is not valid in penal cases, for legally movable property of orhpans does not become mortgaged to a creditor save that the <i>Geonim</i> decreed that they become mortgaged. But this Geonic decree certainly does not apply to penal cases — <i>Nethiboth, A.H.</i> If the injured person seized an amount which also corresponds to the fine, after which the injurer reseized the fine, the Judges nowadays cannot order this fine to be returned to the injured person, for if so, it would mean that they adjudicate fines — <i>Nethiboth. R.A.Eger</i>, however, states that the amount corresponding to the fine may be restored to the injured person, for once the latter seized this amount it became his personal property and no longer falls under the category of fines — <i>P.Tesh.</i></i> <i>And all this</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That nowadays Judges have no authority to adjudicate fines.</i> [<i>applies</i>] <i>only to fines stated</i> [<i>in Biblical Law</i>], <i>but</i> [<i>as to</i>] <i>fines which the Sages come</i> [<i>from time to time</i>] <i>to impose of their own accord with respect to</i> [<i>one who does not observe</i>] <i>their ordinance</i>[<i>s</i>],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">e., ordinances decreed by the Sages for the sake of safe-guarding the Torah laws — <i>A.H.</i></i> <i>they may collect everywhere</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Whether in or outside the Land of Israel.

Eliezer b. Jacob stated: I heard that the Court of Law may (whenever necessary) administer punishment by lashes and impose (capital) sentences, even though not (warranted) by Biblical law; not for the purpose of disregarding the Torah but in order to make a fence around the Torah. It once happened that a man rode on horseback on the Sabbath during the Greek period and was brought before the Court of Law and was stoned, not because he was liable to this penalty, but because the needs of the hour demanded it. It also happened that a man had intercourse with his wife under a fig tree and was brought before the Court of Law and was flogged, not because he deserved it, but because the needs of the hour demanded it.’ <i>N.Yos.</i>, however, writes that the above penalties were imposed by the <i>Great Sanhedrin</i> but any other Court of Law does not have the authority to administer such punishment. He adduces the following text to prove his point: San. 52b: ‘Immarta, the daughter of Tali, a <i>Kohen</i>, committed adultery. In consequence of that, R. Ḥama b. Tobiah had her surrounded by faggots and burnt. R. Joseph said: He (R. Ḥama) was unaware of two laws. He was unaware of R. Mathna’s statement (that burning was executed by pouring molten lead down the culprit’s throat) and was ignorant of the following Baraitha: <i>And thou shalt come unto the priests, the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in those days</i> (Deut. XVII, 9). This teaches that when the priesthood operates (in the Temple), the Judge operates (with respect to capital punishment) ; but when the priesthood does not operate, the Judge may not function.’ Hence, R. Ḥama, who flourished after the destruction of the Temple had no authority to impose capital punishment. <i>N.Yos.</i> cites additional cases to corroborate his viewpoint: Nid. 13b, San. 58b: ‘R. Ḥama had the hand of one who was accustomed to strike other people cut off.’ San. 27a: ‘The Exilarch (<i>Resh Galutha</i>) said to R. Abba b. Jacob, Go and investigate the matter; if he is definitely the murderer, dim his eyes.’ In these latter cases only partial punishment was administered but not full punishment in accordance with Biblical law. However, <i>N.Yos.</i> is opposed by the <i>Codifiers</i> (v. also <i>D.M.</i>) who hold that if <i>the needs of the hour demand it</i> even full punishment may be meted out including capital sentences although it would not be in accordance with Biblical law where legal warning and valid witnesses are required which would be difficult to obtain nowadays as a result of which the world would become full of violence and ultimately destroyed.

            "A Court of Law must consist of not less than three [Judges]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishna San. 2a and Gemara <i>ibid.</i> 2b-3a in accord with R. Aḥa, the son of R. Ika that Biblically even one is sufficient to judge monetary cases. Three, however, are required Rabbinically on account of idlers who are unversed in the law (v. <i>Isserles</i> anon). Thus also Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> II, 10 (v. <i>Kesef Mishneh</i> on the authority of <i>RaShBA</i>) and <i>Asheri</i> to San. I end <i>contra ‘Ir Shushan</i> — <i>M.E. BaḤ</i> writes that in the first instance (<span>לכתחילה</span>) three who are versed in the law are required. Regarding a city wherein all the inhabitants are unversed in the law, v. <i>infra</i> § 8, 1, <i>Gloss. ShaK</i> defends <i>‘Ir Shushan</i> on the basis of the following text: San. 3a: ‘Said Raba, . . cases of indebtedness require no <i>Mumḥin</i> for the reason advanced by R. Ḥanina (v. <i>infra</i>). R. Aḥa, the son of R. Ika states: Biblically even one individual is qualified to deal with cases of indebtedness, as it is written, <i>In righteousness shalt</i> thou <i>judge thy neighbour</i> (Lev. XIX, 5). Three judges are required on account of idlers who act as judges … What is the difference between Raba and R. Aḥa, the son of R. Ika (since they both agree that laymen Judges are legally qualified to adjudicate monetary cases) ? — They differ with respect to the opinion of Samuel who said: If two laymen Judges adjudicated a monetary case, their judgment holds good but they are called an arrogant court. Raba (who requires three Biblically) does not agree with Samuel; whereas R. Aḥa, does.’ Consequently, continues <i>ShaK,</i> since we do not rule in accordance with Samuel (v. <i>infra</i> par. 2 beg.), we must say that the law agrees with Raba, viz., that Biblically three <i>Mumḥin</i> are necessary, for the term <i>‘Elohim’</i> denoting <i>‘Judges’</i> is found three times in Ex. XXII, 6-8 with respect to cases of larceny, and on the basis of the principle that there is <i>‘an interweaving of Biblical sections’</i> <span>עירוב פרשיות</span> (i.e., clauses of one section are taken over for interpretative purposes to a succeeding section, in this case the term <i>‘Elohim’</i> is taken over to the section in Ex. XXII, 24 which deals with cases of indebtedness). Hence, three <i>Mumḥin</i> Judges should be required even in cases of indebtedness. However, this requirement was relaxed and three laymen Judges suffice on account of the reason advanced by R. Ḥanina, viz., ‘in order not to close the door against borrowers’ (people would refuse to advance loans should they subsequently meet with difficulties in having to procure <i>Mumḥin</i> Judges in order to collect their debts). This is also evident from <i>Asheri,</i> for he decides in favour of R. Abbahu that the adjudication of two Judges is invalid <i>contra</i> Samuel (v. <i>supra</i> this note). Furthermore, <i>Asheri</i> states explicitly that the law follows R. Abbahu since we have an established principle that beginning with Abaye and Raba the law always rests with the <i>Later Authorities.</i> Consequently, the law is decided in favour of Raba who disagrees with Samuel. Thus also <i>Alfasi, RABaN</i> and <i>N.Yos. Maim.</i> ruling (v. Yad <i>ibid.</i>) presents the following difficulties: a) On the one hand <i>Maim.</i> rules that three Judges are required and on the other hand, he states that one <i>Mumḥeh</i> is permitted to try monetary cases, which is in agreement with R. Aḥa. But, as we have seen above, R. Aḥa accepts Samuel’s dictum, and such being the case, <i>Maim.</i> should likewise accept Samuel’s ruling that two Judges are sufficient. The same difficulty is found in <i>SeMaG.</i> b) According to B.K. 84b and Git. 88b, the reason why we may adjudicate monetary cases nowadays is because we act as agents of the former authoritative Judges (<i>Elohim</i>). Thus also Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> V, 8 and <i>SeMaG</i> (v. <i>supra</i> § 1 notes). Hence, Biblically, monetary cases are tried by <i>Mumḥin,</i> i.e., in accord with Raba, for according to R. Aḥa, one laymen Judge would be sufficient today (v. <i>Kesef Mishneh</i> to Yad, <i>ibid.</i> II, 10 who raises the same question and cites <i>Resp.</i> of <i>RaShBA</i> in order to remove the above difficulties. Cf. also <i>Leḥem Mishneh ibid.</i>). <i>ShaK</i> writes that the solution of the latter authorities is strained. <i>A.H.</i> removes the above difficulties as follows: Samuel’s dictum that ‘If two judges tried monetary cases their decision holds good,’ <i>refers only to Biblical adjudication.</i> And needless to say that the one (R. Aḥa) who maintains that Biblically one Judge is qualified to try monetary cases will certainly hold that if two adjudicated the matter, their decision is valid and they are Biblically designated a Court of Law. However, Rabbinically, all agree that three Judges are required on account of idlers who are unversed in the law. This is what is meant by the text (v. <i>supra</i>), ‘What is the difference between Raba and R. Aḥa? — They differ with respect to the opinion of Samuel who said: ‘If two Judges etc.,’ i.e., Biblically, the decision given by two judges is valid and they are designated a Court of Law according to Samuel. Therefore, the Gemara does not state that the difference between Raba and R. Aḥa centers around the difference of opinion between Samuel and R. Abbahu (the latter holding that the decision of two is invalid), for as far as a valid judgment is concerned, R. Aḥa and Samuel agree with R. Abbahu that three are required <i>Rabbinically,</i> on account of idlers. Samuel and R. Aḥa only differ Biblically.</i> and every [group of] three [Judges] is called a Court of Law even if they be laymen.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">San. 2b-3a.  previous note.</i> <i>For it is impossible that there should not be among them</i> [<i>at least</i>] <i>one who has a knowledge of</i> <i>logical inferences in</i> [<i>civil</i>] <i>laws</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">San. 3a.

The expression used here has reference to one who merely received reasons for certain laws from others, but is himself not endowed with the power of reasoning — <i>M.E.</i> (v. also <i>Perisha</i>). <i>ShaK</i> agrees with <i>M.E.</i> regarding the term <span>סביר</span>, but maintains that one of the Judges must be versed in traditions (<span>גמיר</span> used in San. <i>ibid.</i>). Thus also <i>R. Meir of Padua contra BaḤ</i> who writes that <span>גמיר</span> refers to partial knowledge. The ruling here, viz., that one is required to be versed in the law follows <i>Asheri contra Mord.</i> who requires the three Judges to be versed in the law even if they have no reasoning power.

Thus also <i>Alfasi, Asheri</i> and Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> II, 10. The following sources in Rabbinic literature indicate that R. Abbahu’s view was the accepted law: San. 29b-30a: Regarding a deed of a debtor’s admission of indebtedness in the presence of witnesses (<span>אודיתא</span>) where it is taken for granted that the document was legally drawn up in the presence of a Court of three. Ket. 22a (cf. San. <i>ibid.</i>) : If one of the three Judges necessary for the authentication of signatures on documents (<span>קיום שטרות</span>) died before signing it, the document should contain such wording. So too, in B.B. 165b. B.M. 31b: ‘Go and bring three people in whose presence you made the division (of partnership).’ San. 2b-3a: Raba agrees with R. Abbahu that if two adjudicated a monetary case their decision is not binding. Thus also the opinion of R. Joḥanan and Resh Lakish in Y. San. I, 1(18a) cited by <i>Tosaf.,</i> San. 2b s.v. <span>דברי הכל</span>. <i>Mord</i>. a.o. write that even Samuel who regards the decision of two Judges binding (v. <i>supra</i> par. 1) will agree that in the cases of <span>אודיתא</span> (admission of indebtedness) and <span>קיום שטרות</span> (authentication of signatures) mentioned above, three Judges are required. As to the statement in San. 30 and parallel references, ‘But perhaps the Rabbis of Rabbana Ashi’s academy agreed with Samuel,’ — it should be understood as refering to other cases of adjudication (v. <i>Hag. Imre Baruk</i>). This also follows from <i>Alfasi</i> and <i>Maim.,</i> the latter holding that even a <i>Mumḥeh</i> is not qualified to deal alone in the above-mentioned matters, although in other cases he is qualified. <i>BaḤ</i> writes that if two Judges adjudicated a monetary case and exacted money from one person and gave it to another person and the latter betrothed a woman with this money, — we should be stringent and consider the marriage binding and in order to dissolve the marriage a <i>Get</i> (Bill of Divorce) is required. <i>ShaK</i> opposes <i>BaḤ</i>’s <i>ruling.</i></i> even [if] they did not render an erroneous decision,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Derived from San. 6a.</i> unless the litigants accepted them [to abide by their ruling],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i></i> or [in the case of] one who is a recognized <i>Mumḥeh</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">San. 5a; Bek. 37a. <i>Tur</i> citing <i>R. Sherira Gaon,</i> writes: ‘Whoever is considered like R.

VI, 2 and <i>Gemara</i> ibid. 53b — <i>M.E.</i></i> <i>Nowadays we do not conduct proceedings of adjudication</i> [<i>of monetary cases by</i>] <i>a recognized Mumḥeh so that he judge</i> [<i>not</i>] <i>alone against the will of an individual</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>MaHaRIW</i> s. 147 — <i>G.</i> Cf.

The same ruling applies nowadays with respect to the release of vows where a single expert cannot deal with such matters, but a Court of three is required. , <i>Tur</i> and <i>Sh. ‘Ar.</i> Y.D. § 228, 1; § 243, 8, <i>Gloss.</i> The same applies to imposing the fine of a <i>‘Litra</i> of gold’ in the case where one insults a scholar (v. <i>supra</i> § 1, n. 55) — <i>M.E.</i> However, if one recognized Judge rendered an erroneous decision, he is not liable to make restitution.

Thus <i>Tur</i> on the authority of <i>Asheri. Maim.,</i> however, holds (Yad, <i>ibid.</i>) that even if they are experts and duly ordained, — as long as they are less than three, an admission made before them is not binding. But if they are three, even laymen, it would be valid. This is the meaning of <i>Caro</i>’s statement, ‘even if they are duly ordained,’ i.e., even if they are experts (although Yad has ‘even if he is a rcognized <i>Mumḥeh,</i>’ it applies equally to two experts). Consequently, <i>Isserles’ Gloss</i> is difficult to comprehend, for it should have been stated as a dissenting opinion. Perhaps <i>Isserles</i> should be understood thus: ‘and they are not Judges who are recognized by the public.’ But this is a strained interpretation — <i>M.E. ShaK</i> rejects the interpretation of <i>M.E.</i> For even if the Judges are recognized by the public, their decision would still be invalid since they are less than three. The reason, therefore, why <i>Isserles</i> does not record this as a dissenting opinion is duel to the fact that the term ‘duly ordained’ (<span>סמוכים</span>) employed by <i>Caro</i> is unclear. For Judges may be duly ordained and yet not be experts (<span>מומחין</span>). , <i>Tur</i> and <i>Asheri infra</i> § 25 that <i>‘Ordination’</i> holds good even for a non-<i>Mumḥeh.</i> The law, however, is that even if they are duly ordained and also experts, — yet, if their number is less than three, an admission of indebtedness made in their presence is not binding (<i>contra Isserles</i>). Thus also <i>‘Ir Shushan</i> — <i>ShaK. A.H.</i> rules that if the litigants accepted the Judges (although their number is less than three) or one Judge who was a recognized authority (<span>מומחח לרבים</span>), e.g., if the people accepted a Rabbi to judge all monetary matters alone, the latter has the status of a Court of Law and an admission made in his presence is binding and the litigants cannot alter their original pleas. Likewise, one who denies aught in his presence and subsequently witnesses appeared and refuted his evidence, is presumed to be a liar even in the future (v. Sh. ‘Ar. anon). So too, may this single Judge compel one to appear before him for judgment and may hear testimony, save that in one respect there is a difference between a single Judge and a Court of Law of three. For in the latter case, an admission made in their presence is regarded as an admission made in writing and another Court may adjudicate the matter in accordance with the testimony and the pleas heard by the first Court of three even if the testimony etc., is submitted by the first Court to the second Court in writing. But if one was accepted as the recognized authority, although, as stated above, an admission made in his presence is regarded as made before a Court of Law of three, and should he on the basis of the information he obtains, render a decision, it would be binding, — yet, if after hearing the testimony and obtaining all the information in the case, — for some reason, it is submitted to another Court for final adjudication, the evidence presented to the second Court for consideration is regarded as having the status of oral testimony offered by a witness testifying to what he has heard from an eye-witness’ (Bek. 36a a.e.) which is invalid. Consequently, the second Court cannot render a decision on the basis of the submitted evidence. And if this testimony is submitted in writing to the second Court, the latter would have to hear the evidence again directly from the contesting parties or the party that made the admission, for the law is that testimony must be offered by witnesses orally and not from their writing (derived from Deut. XIX, 15, <i>At the mouth of two witnesses</i> … <i>shall a matter be established</i> — Git. 71a). But if the single recognized authority completes the adjudication himself, his decision is as binding as the one given by a Court of three — <i>Nethiboth</i>. On testimony offered before a Court, v. <i>infra</i> § 39, 12 and on the authentication of documents, v. <i>infra</i> § 46, 4, <i>Gloss</i>.</i> even [if] they are duly ordained in the Land of Israel,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>supra</i> § 1, n. 1.</i> — [the law is that] an admission of indebtedness made in their presence is regarded as an admission made outside the Court<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> San. 29b and <i>infra</i> § 39, 7.</i> and they [the litigants] may alter their [original] pleas which they put forth before them [the Judges].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">B.B. 31a.</i> One who denies aught before them [the Judges] and subsequently witnesses arrived [and refuted him], is not presumed to be a liar.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">B.M. 17a and <i>Alfasi</i> a.l.

R. Naḥman said: A man may take the law into his own hands for the sake of safeguarding his interests. Where there is an irretrievable loss pending, all the authorities agree that a man may take the law into his own hands in order to protect his interests. They differ only where there is no irretrievable loss pending. R. Judah holds that a man may not take the law into his own hands in order to protect his interests, for since no irretrievable loss is pending let him go to the Judge; whereas, R. Naḥman maintains that a man may take the law into his own hands in order to safeguard his interests, for since he acts according to the law why should he trouble himself (to go to Court) ?’ The law is decided in favour of R.

Naḥman’s viewpoint. Furthermore, we might have thought that the legal principle, ‘a man may take the law into his own hands’ applies only to a case where one comes to seize aught that is in the possession of another individual, in which case, the latter, in order to safeguard his interests may take the law into his own hands, but not so in the case where the article is already in the possession of the offender.

The other said to him: This day is mine! But when the latter paid no attention, he took the blade of a hoe and struck him with it. R. Naḥman replied : He ought to have given him a hundred blows with the hoe.’ Although this case would harmonize even with R. Judah’s view (v. <i>supra</i> n. 1) since it involved an irretrievable loss (for there would be no water left in the well by the time they go to Court), — yet, we see that he was permitted to strike him, whence it follows that even according to the view that one may take the law into his own hands even where no irreparable loss is pending, he may also strike the offender.</i> until he releases it, — <i>if he cannot save</i> [<i>the stolen article</i>] <i>otherwise</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tur</i> — <i>G.</i> Thus also <i>Asheri.</i> Derived from B.K. 27a in the case of the ox that threw himself on the back of another ox with the intention to kill, where it is pointed out that one may not cause damage to a <i>tort-feasant</i> animal if it was possible to save his own chattel otherwise, even where there is an irretrievable loss involved.

Said Abaye, he should have the right to plead, When I handed over the article it was my own property that I surrendered. Said Raba to him: <i>Is he then believed if he says so?</i> — Raba therefore, said: We impose a ban upon him until he returns the net and appears before the Court.’ It follows that only if he were able to prove that it is his do we apply the principle, ‘a man may take the law into his own hands.’ Otherwise not. , also M.K. 17a where it is stated that ‘a scholar may take the law into his own hands when he is absolutely certain as to the law,’ whence it follows that one who is not a scholar must be prepared to establish that it is definitely his. For if he cannot prove that the article is his, then not only is he forbidden to strike him and seize the article, but he is forbidden to take the article even without resorting to force. This is applicable only if he seizes the article in the presence of witnesses, but if there are no witnesses present, he may seize it, since then he would be believed before the Court on the principle of <i>Miggo</i> (v. <i>supra</i> § 1, n. 50) — <i>M.E., ShaK.</i></i> Nevertheless, he has no right to seize a pledge for his debt [when it matures].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For if he takes a pledge of him, he transgresses the negative precept, <i>When thou dost lend thy neighbour any manner of loan, thou shalt not go into his home to fetch his pledge</i> (Deut.

B.M. 113a: ‘One who lends money to his fellow, may take a pledge of him (when the debt falls due) only through the Court.’ Not only is he prohibited to enter the debtor’s home in order to seize the pledge, but even outside of the home it is permitted only for the Court officer to seize it forcibly according to Samuel (<i>ibid.</i>). If, however, the borrower denies the debt, the lender may seize the pledge without witnesses in order that he be believed on the principle of <i>Miggo</i> (v. <i>supra</i> n. 6). For the reason why it is forbidden for him proper to seize the pledge is that he can seize the pledge through the Court, but in this case where he cannot collect it through Court, he may seize it himself (v. <i>infra</i> § 97, 15). Cf. also <i>infra</i> § 61, 6. Thus <i>Sha‘ar Mishpat. K.H.</i> reject this — <i>P.Tesh.</i></i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>On account of the reason which will be explained infra § 97, par. 6.

Especially according to <i>Tosaf.</i> (B.M. 113a, s.v. <span>אימא</span>) who write that the prohibition against the creditor seizing forcibly from the debtor, even outside of the latter’s home, is only a Rabbinical measure lest he seize in his (the debtor’s) home.

Consequently, seizing forcibly a pledge where both the Biblical prohibition <i>Thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge</i> (Deut. XXIV, 10) as well as the Rabbinical prohibition (v. <i>supra</i> n. 9) do not enter, would be permissible under all conditions and would not come under the category of ‘legal adjudication’ (<span>דינא</span>). Hence, the principle ‘a man may take the law etc.,’ would not be applicable in such a case. For ‘seizure’ (<span>תפיםה</span>) without ‘striking’ (<span>הכאה</span>) is not designated ‘legal adjudication’ (<span>דינא</span>). This is substantiated by B.M. 115a (v. text <i>supra</i> n. 8). The latter text would present difficulties even according to R. Naḥman (needless to say according to R. Judah), for as seen above, ‘a man may take the law into his own hands’ is applicable only where the article is intact and is certainly his (the claimant’s), but what is not specifically his does not come under this principle. Consequently, it may be asked how may the claimant enter the home of the surety etc., to take or seize an article which is not specifically his? However, if we say that seizure without striking is not ‘legal adjudication,’ he may enter the home of the surety even against the latter’s will, for this is not a case of taking the <i>law</i> into his own hands. As far as Ber. 5b (v. text <i>supra</i> n. 14) is concerned the vine twigs were taken by R. Huna not as ‘seizure’ (<span>תפיםה</span>), but rather as ‘payment’ (<span>תשלומין</span>), i.e., not with the intention to go subsequently to law.

This is substantiated by B.B. 24b on the principle that ‘a pot that belongs to two partners is neither warm nor cold,’ i.e., since the opinions of an entire community differ and each townsman would rely upon the other, the Rabbis were lenient with them and gave them the status of a scholar even if the individual townsman would suffer thereby. Furthermore, in the case of an entire community it is difficult to ascertain the matter, since they are all interested parties as in the case of a scholar who cannot ascertain his case before others being occupied with his learning.

This is substantiated by B.B. 55a : ‘If property is purchased by rich landlords (they paid to the government the tax on land, the owners of which were in arrears and thus became the owners of the land) who buy up land from the ruler or his servants and pay the tax on it, the sale is valid. This has reference, however, only to (land) which is transferred to the rich landlords because of the land tax, but if on account of the poll tax, then a purchase from them is not valid, because the poll tax is a personal liability. R. Huna, the son of R. Joshua said that even barley in the pot is seizable for the poll tax. R. Ashi said: Huna b. Nathan told me that Amram found that this view is untenable because if it were so, it would interfere with the law of the double portion to which a firstborn is entitled in the case of an inheritance (Deut. XXI, 17), for all the (inherited) property would thus become ‘prospective’ (since all the property was seizable by the government on account of the poll tax) and (the law is that) a firstborn does not receive a double portion in prospective as in actual assets.’ The Gemara concludes that the father must have paid the land tax prior to his death thereby making his assets actual. Hence, we see that the tax collectors who are authorized by the government are considered ‘actual possessors’ (<span>מוחזקים</span>). , <i>Tosaf. ibid.</i> s.v. <span>אם כן</span>. Thus also according to Yeb. 46a and <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>כי נפקי</span>. Consequently, the townsmen may say to the individual, ‘Prove your case because it is the claimant that must produce evidence’ (<span>המוציא מחבירו עליו הראיה</span>). And if he cannot produce evidence, they take an oath and are exempt, or if they wish, the individual takes the oath. However, the choice is in their hands as is the law of an ‘actual possesor’ (<span>מוחזק</span>).</i> <i>and he is required to give them a pledge before they go down with him to Court</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Mord</i>. to B.B. VI and II end — <i>G.</i> Derived from B.B. 24b: ‘Trees must be kept away a distance of twenty-five cubits from a town … If the tree was there first, it is cut down but compensation must be given (Mishna). Gemara: Why cannot the owner of the tree say, Compensate me first and I will then cut it down? … A pot with two cooks is neither hot nor cold’ (i.e., each townsman will wait for some other to compensate as a result of which the tree will still remain). Similarly, in the present case, the pledge must be given by the individual to the townsmen and the former becomes the claimant, otherwise the matter will be neglected.</i> <i>The fact that they are called actual possessors with respect to an individual applies only in matters of taxes but not in other cases</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">B.B. 24b: In the case of the tree which must be kept away from a town a distance of twenty-five feet cubits (v. previous note), the Mishna states that ‘if the town was there first, the tree is cut down (by the townsmen) and no compensation is given. If the tree was there first, it is cut down and compensation is given. If there is a doubt which was there first, it is cut down and no compensation is given. Gemara asks : Why in the case of pit (<i>ibid.</i> 25b) is it stated that (in the case of a doubt whether the pit or the tree was there first) the tree is not cut down? — With respect to pit it is stated that if the tree was certainly (there first) it is not cut down (contrary to the case of the tree that was there before the town was founded). Consequently, when there is a doubt we also do not say to him, Cut it down. However, in the present case even if the tree was there first it is cut down, consequently, if there is a doubt we also say to him, Cut it down. And should the question of compensation arise, we say to him, Produce evidence that it is yours (i.e., that the tree was there first) and take compensation.’ It follows therefrom that the fundamental reason for cutting down the tree in the case of doubt and not giving compensation is because it is obligatory to remove the tree and since we rule that even if it is certain that the tree was there first, it is cut down, consequently, the doubt remains only regarding the compensation and the townsmen are regarded as the ‘actual possessors.’ Hence, only with respect to monetary matters do they enjoy the status of ‘actual possessors,’ being empowered by the ruler or the government, but not in other matters.</i> <i>Nevertheless, he must give</i> [<i>them</i>] <i>a pledge before they go down to Court with him</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Terumath ha-Deshen</i> s. 341 — <i>G.</i> The pledge must be given by the individual even in a case where the community does not enjoy the status of a possessor, so that the individual should be the claimant.  <i>supra</i> n. 23.</i> <i>This entire</i> [<i>foregoing ruling applies only</i>] <i>where the individual</i> [<i>who is in conflict with the community</i>] <i>is not a scholar, but if he is a scholar where the</i> [<i>study of the</i>] <i>Torah is his</i> [<i>sole</i>] <i>profession and he has a claim in this</i> [<i>matter</i>] <i>on account of taxes, he is not required to give them a pledge and they too are not called actual possessors with respect to him</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>R.

On <i>Ḥol ha-Moed</i> it is permissible to hold judicial sessions and to put the decision down in writing (O.Ḥ. § 545, 5) — <i>A.H.</i></i> However, if one violated [this law] and judged [on the Sabbath or Festival], his decision is valid.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Alfasi</i> and <i>Asheri</i> state that the source of this law is the Y.

            "[Civil suits] are not tried on the eve of a Sabbath or on the eve of a Festival.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Y. San. IV, 7(22b) ; Y. Beẓ. V, 2(63a); Y. Ket. I, 1(24d) where it is stated that the Mishna in San. 32a: ‘Capital cases are not tried on the eve of a Sabbath or Festival’ (since in case of condemnation the verdict must be carried out on the following day which is impossible were the trial to be held on the eve of a Sabbath or Festival. Moreover, it would be against the law to leave judgment in suspense until after the Sabbath or Festival — San. 35a. Cf. M.K. 14b) implies that civil suits <i>may</i> be tried on the eve of a Sabbath or Festival. Hence, <i>Caro</i>’s ruling presents a difficulty. Y. (<i>ibid.</i>) therefore, explains that the prohibition against adjudication of civil suits on the eve of a Sabbath or Festival is merely a Rabbinical measure. Thus also Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> XI, 3; <i>Alfasi</i> and <i>Asheri</i> to San. <i>ibid.</i> Even if the litigants agreed to appear before the Judges on the eve of a Sabbath or Festival, the prohibition still stands. For the Judges must be deliberate in judgment and since they are busy preparing for the Sabbath or Festival, this is not possible (<i>contra ‘Ir Shushan</i> who writes that the reason is that the people are busy making the festive preparations and should therefore, not be summoned then). This is substantiated by <i>Isserles’ Gloss</i> (anon), ‘but where a prohibition is involved (e.g., divorce or <i>Ḥalizah</i> proceedings) the lenient view should not be adopted’ and in <i>D.M., Isserles</i> adds, ‘for they (the Judges) are busy with the Sabbath preparations and cannot be deliberate in judgment.’ Thus we see that it is on account of the preoccupation of the Judges. This applies only to adjudication, but as regards hearing the pleas of the litigants and issuing the verdict after the Sabbath or Festival, it would be permissible from the Judges’ standpoint to meet for this purpose on the eve of the Sabbath or Festival (Thus <i>RaN</i> to Ket. beg.). The litigants, however, cannot be compelled to appear. This is the meaning of the following statement of <i>Caro</i>, ‘If they summoned a litigant to appear . . he is not obliged to come,’ i.e., even if the summons was for the purpose of hearing the pleas only, or it may mean that even if the Judges are free (e.g., others make the festive preparations for them), yet, the litigants cannot be compelled to appear — <i>M.E. Nethiboth</i>, however, maintains that if the litigants are willing to accept the verdict even if it is erroneous, the Judges may try their case even on the eve of a Sabbath or Festival.</i> If they summoned a litigant to appear before the Court of Law [on these days], he is not obliged to come.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">B.K. 113a; Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> XXV, 9. , end of previous note.</i> Even if they summoned [him on the eve of a Sabbath or Festival] to appear after the Sabbath or Festival, and he did not come, we do not penalize him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">B.K. <i>ibid.</i> For he may offer the reason that he was busy preparing for the Sabbath or the Festival and did not take notice of the summons (Gemara <i>ibid.</i>) — <i>M.E., ShaK</i>.</i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>There is an authority who writes that nowadays we may conduct legal proceedings on the eve of a Sabbath or on the eve of a Festival on account of the neglect of</i> [<i>Torah instruction by</i>] <i>teachers</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For throughout the week if they should have to appear in Court, the study of the Torah would be neglected. Hence, on the eve of the Sabbath or Festival when they are free from teaching, it is their only opportunity to appear in Court, if necessary. Hence, if the <i>Beth Din</i> finds it necessary to adjudicate cases on the eve of a Sabbath or Festival, it is permissible. A substantiation for this leniency may be derived from the following Mishna San. 24a: ‘If one (of the contesting parties) said to the other: I accept my father or your father as trustworthy (to act as a Judge), or I accept three herdsmen as trustworthy, R. Meir says, He may (subsequently) retract; but the Sages say, He cannot retract.’ The law is in accord with the Sages, viz., that he cannot retract. It follows therefrom that no prohibition exists against a <i>Beth Din</i> which is Biblically ineligible to adjudicate the case, provided the litigants agreed to accept the ineligible Judges. This applies, of course, to a community where no eligible Judges are available, and such a <i>Beth Din</i> is valid under the circumstances (v. <i>infra</i> § 8, 1; § 22, 1). This is binding only in civil lawsuits, but not where a prohibition is involved. Hence, the ruling of <i>Isserles</i> anon — <i>W.G.</i> (in accord with interpretation of <i>Be’er Eliyahu</i>).</i> <i>And only with respect to a monetary lawsuit may we adopt this lenient view, — for an expropriation made by the Court is valid</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even if the Judges erred because they could not be deliberate in their judgment — <i>M.E.</i></i> <i>but where a prohibition</i> [<i>is involved</i>], <i>the lenient view should not be adopted</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Terumath ha-Deshen</i> s. 227 and <i>Hag.

But after the Festival a date may be fixed. The reason mentioned <i>supra</i> n. 5 does not apply here since there was ample time for him to take notice of the summons. Thus <i>Isserles</i> anon — <i>ShaK</i>. In the month of <i>Sivan</i> it would be permissible to summon one to Court because <i>Shabuoth</i> which occurs in this month consists only of two days in the Diaspora (and one day in the Land of Israel) and the question of preoccupation does not apply. On the eve of <i>Shabuoth</i> it would still be forbidden for the reasons stated above — <i>M.E.</i> Some authorities, <i>contra ShaK</i>, forbid the entire months of <i>Nisan</i> and <i>Tishri</i>. There are twenty-one days during which a Groom should not be summoned to appear in Court, viz., seven days prior to the wedding; the seven days of the wedding-feast; seven days following the wedding-feast. Other authorities hold that a Groom should not be summoned only three days before and seven days after the wedding. A widower who marries a widow is not to be summoned during the three days after the marriage (E.H. § 64). In other cases of religious duties, e.g., a circumcision, the <i>Sandek</i> or the father of the child, should they have to appear in Court, the days to be fixed for the hearing should be left to the discretion of the Judges — <i>P.Tesh.</i></i> for one who is not [a resident] in town, to appear for trial;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">But a resident in the same town may be judged.

But <i>Isserles</i> does not make any comment (<i>ibid.</i>) as in the present ruling, although <i>Mord</i>. is the source of the ruling in O.Ḥ. too. It is quite possible that <i>Caro</i> in O.Ḥ. is dealing with a case where it is permissible to bring charges in the month of <i>Nisan, e.g.</i>, where the accused was one of the townsmen or there was deliberate postponement and deception on the part of the accused party, in which case as stated here, it is permissible. Hence, in O.Ḥ. under the above conditions, it is not forbidden to bring charges — <i>M.E.</i> This interpretation is questioned by <i>Ba’er Heteb</i> a.l., for <i>Isserles</i> states here that even villagers who came from out of town are not to be tried whence we infer that much more so in the case of residents is this forbidden. <i>M.E.</i> may, however, be defended for in O.Ḥ. § 539, 3 <i>Isserles</i> does comment, viz., <i>‘He is permitted to bring charges</i> (against his fellow) <i>in</i> (the place of) <i>judgment on account of his debts.’ M.Abr.</i> rejects the interpretation of <i>M.E.</i>, for in O.Ḥ. we deal with bringing charges before a heathen Court, which is permissible during the Festival. This is what is meant by the term <span>משפט</span> (‘in the place of judgment’) employed in O.Ḥ. <i>M.E.</i> is defended by <i>Shebuth Ya‘akob</i> because <i>M.E.</i> refers to § 546 where <i>Caro</i> states the law without using the term <span>משפט</span> (‘in the place of judgment’), i.e., even before a Jewish Court. <i>Maḥaẓith ha-Shekel</i> and <i>Peri Megadim</i> defend <i>M.Abr.</i> for in O.Ḥ. § 546 too, the source is <i>Mord. Tummim</i> makes the following distinction: In the present ruling we deal with a case of one who not only brings charges against his fellow but also, demands that the matter be adjudicated, which is forbidden during this period; whereas in O.Ḥ. we deal with a case where the plaintiff demands payment and refers to a matter which is not contested by the accused party. Hence, it is permissible to be done on <i>Ḥol ha-Moed</i> — <i>P.Tesh.</i></i> <i>and if we</i> [<i>are able to detect that</i>] <i>there is</i> [<i>deliberate</i>] <i>postponement and deception</i> [<i>on the part of the summoned party in order to avoid justice</i>], <i>we may adjudicate</i> [<i>the matter</i>] <i>forthwith</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Mord</i>. to B.K. X beg. and <i>Hag. Maim.</i> — <i>G.</i> B.K. 113a: ‘R. Naḥman said: We never summon the participants of the <i>Kallah</i> (the assembly of Babylonian students in the months of <i>Elul</i> and <i>Adar</i>) to appear in Court during the period of the <i>Kallah</i> or the participants of the Festival sessions which are held during the festive season (which begins thirty days prior to the Festival). When plaintiffs would come before R. Naḥman (and requested that summonses be issued during this season) he would say to them: Have I assembled them for your individual benefit? But now that there are impostors (who take advantage of this privilege) there is apprehension (that they came to the assemblies for the sake of avoiding justice) !’ The last part of this statement, ‘and now that there are impostors’ is explained by <i>Mord</i>. to mean that we investigate the matter in order to determine whether there is a deliberate postponement or deception on their part in order to avoid justice. Hence, if we discover that this is really the case, we do fix a date for them to appear in Court during the <i>Kallah</i> and the festive sessions.</i> <i>There are some localities where the adopted custom is that if they had begun to adjudicate</i> [<i>the matter</i>] <i>before Nisan and Tishri, we may fix a date</i> [<i>for the continuation of the hearing</i>] <i>even therein</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">e., during <i>Nisan</i> and <i>Tishri</i>. Although according to the reasons mentioned above for not summoning one to a judicial session during <i>Nisan</i> or <i>Tishri</i> there is actually no difference between the commencement of the trial or the conclusion thereof, yet, there is support for the custom mentioned here, in Mishna Shab. 9a: ‘If they began, they need not interrupt.’ Cf. also anon: ‘We do not try cases at night … but if they had begun to try monetary cases during the day, they may conclude at night.’</i> <i>and wherever such is the custom it may be practiced</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Decisions of Isserlein</i> s. 207 — <i>G</i>.</i> We do not try cases at night with respect to the commencement of the trial, but if they had begun to try monetary cases during the day, they may conclude at night.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishna San. 32a. Gemara (<i>ibid.</i> 34b) : ‘Whence is this derived? R. Ḥiyya b. Papa said: From the verse, <i>And let them judge the people at all times</i> (Ex. XVIII, 22 i.e., even at night). If this is the case, then even the commencement of the trial may (be held at night) — It is as Raba expounded. For Raba pointed out an incongruity (between two verses) : It is written, <i>And let them judge the people at all times</i> (<i>ibid.</i>); but elsewhere it is written, <i>And in the day that he causeth his sons to inherit</i> (Deut. XXI, 16. Here <i>day</i> is emphasized whence it follows that not only cases of inheritance must be decided by day but likewise all civil claims. Hence, this verse contradicts the preceding one). How now is this (reconciled)? — The day is for the commencement of the trial, the night for the conclusion of the trial’ (for, <i>and they shall judge … at all times</i> implies rendering judgment which is the essential factor). In <i>Resp.</i> of <i>Isserles</i> he writes that if the contesting parties agreed to be judged at night, it is permissible to do so, for this should not be regarded different from a case where the litigants accepted as Judge a relative or one who is ineligible. For this reason we adopt the lenient practice nowadays to judge at night, for when the parties appear for trial and come willingly, it is regarded as though they accepted him. Hence, the proceedings may be held at night. Thus <i>M.E. P.Tesh</i> cites dissenting opinions. <i>Caro</i>’s ruling that ‘they may conclude at night’ has reference to cases where there was not enough time to complete the proceedings during the day — <i>P.Tesh</i>.</i> <i>Some say that if they violated</i> [<i>this ruling</i>] <i>and tried cases at night</i> [<i>even with respect to the commencement of the trial</i>], <i>their decision holds good</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>RaShBaM</i> (to B.B. 114a, s.v. <span>אפילו</span>) — <i>G.</i> Derived from Y.

Cf. <i>infra</i> § 28, 24; San. 11b: The sanctification of the month must take place during the day.

            "The time when Judges sit [in judgment] is from the morning until the end of the fifth hour.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shab. 10a: ‘Until when do they sit in judgment? — R.

According to <i>Rashi ibid.</i> s.v. <span>מנחה גדולה</span>, the major <i>Minḥa</i> begins from six and a half hours and onwards (assuming that the day begins at 6:00 a.m. and ends at 6:00 p.m. An ‘hour’ means a twelfth part of the day), i.e., from 12:30 p.m. The expression ‘close to’ (<span>םמוך</span>) used in Mishna <i>ibid.</i> means half an hour before the appointed time. This is derived from Pes. 99b where <span>םמוך למנחה</span> (close to <i>Minḥa</i>) refers to one half hour before the minor <i>Minḥa</i>. Hence, the same applies to the major <i>Minḥa</i> which begins from six and half hours and onwards. Cf. also <i>ibid</i> 100b and v. Ber. 26b: ‘Which is the major <i>Minḥa?</i> — From six hours and a half onwards. Which is the minor <i>Minḥa?</i> — From nine hours and a half and onwards,’ i.e., from 3:30 onwards. Consequently, we do not sit in judgment from the beginning of the seventh hour. Legally the beginning of the seventh hour (12 noon) is the time for reciting <i>Minḥa</i> (v. O.Ḥ. § 232, 2), only that the Sages ordained to wait an additional half an hour in order to make certain that the sun is beginning to decline, for otherwise one may err with respect to the end of the sixth and the beginning of the seventh hour — <i>M.E.</i></i> However, if they began, even the commencement of the trial, they need <i>not</i> interrupt,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishna Shab. <i>ibid.</i> Just as ‘in the first instance’ no distinction is made between the beginning of the trial (<span>תחלת דין</span>) and the conclusion of the trial (<span>גמר דין</span>), so too, if they had already begun, no such distinction is made.

For in the case of robbery of less than a <i>Perutah</i>’s worth, it is not considered ‘money’ (Gemara <i>ibid.</i>) — <i>M.E.</i> In the case of a claim of vessels, however, the Court meets even if less than a <i>Perutah’s</i> worth is involved. , <i>infra</i> § 88, 3. Thus also <i>RaN</i> to Sheb. VI, <i>R. Yeruḥam; Maim</i>. Yad, <i>To‘en we-Nit‘an</i> III, 5. Others oppose this view and maintain that even in the case of vessels a Court session meets only when at least a <i>Perutah’s</i> worth is involved, for less than that is not considered ‘money’ — <i>ShaK. Tummim</i> states that <i>Shitah Mekubeẓeth</i> writes on the authority of <i>RITBA</i> (to B.M. <i>ibid.</i>) that if the claim concerns an object that is still extant, a Court session may meet for this purpose, even if it involves a claim of less than a <i>Perutah</i>’s worth. It is only when payment is demanded that it must involve at least a <i>Perutah</i>’s worth. In the case of two partners who have a claim against an individual in the amount of a <i>Perutah</i>, the law is that although the claim involves only half a <i>Perutah</i> with respect to each partner, yet, since the claim of the partners as a whole involves at least a <i>Perutah</i>’s worth, we may hold a Court session therefor. This would not apply to two individuals (not partners) who together have a claim of a <i>Perutah</i>’s worth against the same party — <i>P.Tesh., A.H.</i> If one person has a claim of a <i>Perutah</i>’s worth against two people, a judicial session may be held therefor, since with respect to the plaintiff the claim is regarded as ‘money’ — <i>A.H.</i> If the Court held a session for a claim that involved less than a <i>Perutah</i>’s worth, such Court has the jurisdiction of a <i>Beth Din</i> insofar as admissions made in their presence are considered binding. Likewise with respect to one who was found to be a liar at such a session, the law is that he remains under such presumption — <i>Nethiboth</i>.</i> However, if they met [on account of a claim of] a <i>Perutah's</i> worth, they may conclude their trial even for [a claim] less than a <i>Perutah's</i> worth.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tur</i> citing <i>Maim.</i> Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> XX, 11 in accord with R.

Raba raised an objection: <i>And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy thing</i> (Lev. V, 16), this (redundant <i>and</i>) extends the law of making amends even to less than a <i>Perutah</i>’s worth. Hence, it applies only to <i>Hekdesh</i> but not to <i>Ḥullin!</i> (i.e., only in the case of sacred objects amends should be made even regarding less than a <i>Perutah</i>’s worth, but not in secular objects. In the latter case one may be compelled to restore aught that involves at least a <i>Perutah</i>’s worth) — But if it was said, it was said thus: R. Kattina stated, If the Court met for a claim of a <i>Perutah</i>’s worth, they may conclude (the case) even for less (i.e., if for some reason the claim was reduced to less than a <i>Perutah</i>’s worth), (because) at the commencement of the trial a <i>Perutah</i> must be involved, but at the conclusion a (claim of a) <i>Perutah</i>’s worth is not necessary.’ This latter statement viz., that ‘at the commencement of the trial … not necessary,’ should be understood as follows: Even if the defendant after the verdict is rendered puts forth a claim against the plaintiff which involves less than a <i>Perutah</i>’s worth, the Judges may conclude the trial even for this amount, the reason being that it is all regarded as one trial, for if the defendant is legally proven to be justified in his claim, he may deduct whatever is owing to him from the plaintiff’s claim. Thus <i>Rashi ibid.</i> and <i>Kesef Mishneh</i> to Yad <i>ibid.</i> It is for this reason that <i>Caro</i> in the present ruling states, ‘and they may conclude <i>their</i> trial,’ whereas <i>Maim. ibid.</i> has ‘and they may conclude <i>his</i> trial’ — <i>M.E.</i> , B.M. <i>ibid., Tosaf</i>. s.v. <span>ותנא דידן</span>; <i>W.G.</i> and <i>Be’er Eliyahu</i> a.l. <i>M.E.</i> adopts the ruling of <i>Asheri contra Maim.</i>, that even if they hold a session for a <i>Perutah</i>’s worth, they may not conclude the proceedings for less than a <i>Perutah</i>’s worth.

Melakim</i> I, 4. Derived from Yeb. 102a: ‘Raba said: A proselyte may judge a fellow proselyte according to Biblical law, for it is said, <i>Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee, whom the Lord thy G-d shall choose, one from among thy bretheren, shalt thou set king over thee</i> (Deut. XVII, 15. ‘King’ is taken to mean also ‘Judge.’  Prov. XXIX, 4); only when set <i>over thee</i> must he be <i>one from among thy brethren</i>, but a proselyte may judge his fellow proselyte.’ <i>Rashi</i> explains this passage as referring to capital cases, for as far as civil suits are concerned, a proselyte may judge even Israelites according to Mishna San. 32a: ‘All are eligible to judge civil suits’ which is explained in Gemara <i>ibid.</i> 36b: <i>‘All</i> includes a proselyte.<i>’ Tosaf.</i> (Yeb. 45b, s.v. <span>כיון</span>) however, maintain that the passage in Yeb. 102a refers to civil suits (i.e., if his mother was not an Israelitish woman he may judge only a fellow proselyte in civil suits but not an Israelite), and as to the text in San. <i>ibid.</i> it refers to a proselyte who judges a fellow proselyte only. <i>Alfasi</i> and <i>Asheri</i> write that in San. we deal with a proselyte whose mother was an Israelitish woman. <i>Caro</i>’s present ruling, viz., that even if one of the members of the <i>Beth Din</i> is a proselyte, the Court is unfit to judge an Israelite, is derived from Yeb. 101b: ‘R. Samuel b. Judah was once standing before Rab Judah when the latter said to him, Come up to this bundle of reeds (a place designated for a <i>Ḥaliẓah</i> ceremony) to be counted in the number of five (judges at the <i>Ḥaliẓah</i> ceremony) so that the matter be publicized well (i.e., in order that it become known that she is a <i>Ḥaluẓah</i> and forbidden to a <i>Kohen</i>). We have learned, the first said, <i>In Israel</i> (Deut.

Have we not already learnt this before (Nid. 49b), Whoever is fit to try capital cases is also fit to try civil suits. However, there are some who are fit to try civil suits but not capital cases … One was intended to include a proselyte, the other a bastard.’ , <i>supra</i> n. 1. Just as a proselyte may try a fellow-proselyte even if he has to compel the latter to appear before him for trial (v. <i>supra</i> n. 6), so too, in the case of a bastard-Judge. This is derived from Mishna San. 32a: ‘All are fit to try civil suits, but not all are fit to try capital cases,’ which means that as in the case of capital charges, compulsion may be used, so too, in the case of civil suits, the bastard-Judge may use compulsion — <i>Be’er Eliyahu. Caro</i>’s ruling that even if the entire <i>Beth Din</i> is comprised of bastard-Judges they are considered fit to judge, is derived from the expression (San. <i>ibid.</i>) ‘<i>all</i> (<span>הכל</span>) are eligible,’ which is meant to include not only if one of the Judges was a bastard, but even if an entire Court of three consists of bastard-Judges, they are eligible to act as Judges.

Not as in the case of a proselyte who may judge only a fellow-proselyte if the former’s mother was not an Israelitish woman. The bastard-Judge may try even Israelites. This is deduced from Kid. <i>ibid.</i> according to the interpretation of San. 36b. <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>חדא</span>. For contrary to the proselyte whose mother was not an Israelitish woman and consequently may only judge a fellow-proselyte, the bastard is of Jewish ancestry.</i> Thus also if each one of them was blind in one of his eyes, he is eligible [to act as Judge].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus Yad <i>ibid.; N; Ba‘al ha-Maor; R. Sherira Gaon a.o.</i> This refers even to the ‘commencement of a trial.’ <i>Alfasi</i> and <i>Asheri</i> state the reason as follows: Since all other people may conclude the trial by night and the eyesight of one blind in one eye is better by day, consequently, the latter may judge even at the commencement of the trial (<i>M.E.</i>), even ‘in the first instance.’ For if this applies only to the conclusion of the trial, how can there be a conclusion without a commencement of the trial — <i>Lebush</i> and <i>Tummim</i>. Here too, it refers to both one Judge or three Judges blind in one eye — <i>A.H.</i> , <i>supra</i> nn. 6 and 8. The present ruling is derived from San. 34b; Nid. 49b-50a: ‘Our Mishna (that a decision may be given at night) disagrees with R. Meir. For it has been taught, R. Meir would say, What is the meaning of the verse, <i>According to their word shall every controversy and every leprosy be</i> (Deut. XXI, 5) ? What connection is there between controversies and leprosies? Controversies are compared to leprosies: just as leprosies must be examined by day, since it is written, <i>And in the day when raw flesh appeareth in him</i> (Lev. XIII, 14) so must controversies be tried by day; and as leprosies are not to be examined by the blind (even in one eye, v. Neg. II, 3), for it is written, <i>Wherever the priest looketh</i> (<i>ibid.</i> v. 12), so controversies also may not be tried by a blind man (even in one eye only — <i>Yad Ramah</i>) … A blind man who lived in the neighbourhood of R. Joḥanan used to try civil suits and R. Joḥanan raised no objection against it. But how could he (R. Joḥanan) act so (to permit him to judge) ? Did not R. Joḥanan actually say, The <i>Halakah</i> agrees with an anonymous Mishna, and we have learnt (the following anonymous Mishna) : Whoever is fit to judge is eligible to testify. However, one may be fit to testify but not eligible to judge, and R. Joḥanan said that this includes one who is blind in one eye (consequently, R. Joḥanan should have objected to the blind man who acted as Judge) ? — R. Joḥanan found another anonymous Mishna (according to which a blind man may judge): Civil suits must be tried by day and may be concluded by night (San. 32a. Hence, according to this Mishna ‘controversies’ were not assimilated to ‘leprosies.’ Consequently, they were not compared with respect to the unfitness of a blind man either, since there are many whose eyesight is as dim by night as a blind man during the day and yet, it states that they may conclude the trial by night). Why is this anonymous Mishna (San.) preferable to the other (Nid.) ? — If you wish I might say, An anonymous Mishna which expresses the view of the majority is preferable (in Nid. the individual opinion of R. Meir is given; in San. that of the majority of the Rabbis), and if you wish I might reply that it (San.) was taught in the tractate dealing with legal procedure (whereas in Nid. it is cited only incidentally).’</i> However, one who is blind in both his eyes is ineligible [to act as Judge].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus Yad <i>ibid.</i> For only in the case of one blind in one eye is it permissible, whence it follows that one blind in both eyes is unfit to judge, since everyone agrees that it is forbidden to try cases at night (v. <i>supra</i> § 5, 2) and for one blind in both eyes the day too, is like night for him — <i>M.E. ‘Ir Shushan</i> deduces the prohibition against one blind in both eyes from the comparison made between ‘controversies’ and ‘leprosies’ (v. text <i>supra</i> n. 10). This is rejected by <i>M.E.</i>, for in San. and Nid. <i>ibid.</i> it was explained that this represents an individual opinion (R. Meir). Furthermore, on this principle, even one blind in one eye would be ineligible. <i>W.G.</i> writes <i>contra M.E.</i> that the eligibility of one blind in one eye is not on account of the comparison with ‘night’ during which a trial may be concluded, for then one blind in both eyes should be fit to judge, but it is rather derived from the general rule in the first part of the Mishna (Nid. <i>ibid.</i>), viz., ‘Whosoever is fit to judge is fit to testify,’ and since one blind in both eyes is ineligible to offer testimony, he is likewise unfit to judge. According to <i>M.E.</i> (who follows <i>Alfasi</i> and <i>Asheri</i>), a Judge whose eyesight was unimpaired at the commencement of the trial and before the trial was concluded became blind, would be eligible to judge at the conclusion of the trial (v. <i>supra</i>); whereas, according to ‘<i>Ir Shushan</i> who compares ‘controversies’ to ‘leprosies,’ he would be ineligible — <i>P.Tesh</i>. An actual case is reported in <i>Keneseth Ezekiel</i> where the litigants were tried by three Judges and after the pleas were heard and the testimony was offered, one of the Judges accidentally became blind in both eyes, whereupon one of the litigants objected to the participation of the blind Judge in the conclusion of the trial. <i>Keneseth Ezekiel</i> after stating the views of the <i>Codifiers</i>, viz., a) <i>Maim.</i> — one blind in both eyes is ineligible to judge even at the conclusion of the trial; b) <i>Tosaf., SeMaG</i> and <i>Mord</i>. — eligible even for the commencement of the trial, c) <i>Alfasi</i> — ineligible for the commencement of the trial, eligible for the conclusion, — ruled in accordance with the last opinion (<i>Alfasi</i>). Hence, the Judge in the above case who became blind in both eyes before the conclusion of the trial, is eligible to judge together with the other two judges and give a decision. <i>BaḤ</i> also states that <i>ex post facto</i> (<span>בדיעבד</span>) the decision of one blind in both eyes is valid. Moreover, the above case may be considered as <i>ex post facto</i>, since the pleas and testimony were already heard before the accident happened. In addition it may be said that since three Judges were present, then even if the decision of the now blind Judge is not valid, yet, on the basis of <i>BeHaG</i> and <i>Tosaf.</i> who accept Samuel’s dictum, ‘If two Judges tried a case, their decision holds good’ (San. 2b. Cf. <i>supra</i> § 3, 2), the recalcitrant litigant may be compelled to accept their decision. However, according to <i>Tummim, Nethiboth</i> a.o., even if the Judge became blind at the conclusion of the trial, he is ineligible — <i>P.Tesh</i>. One whose eyesight is very dim but is not blind may act as Judge. According to the majority of the <i>Codifiers</i> who rule that one blind in both eyes is unfit to judge, support for this may also be found in the following passage in Ket. 94b: ‘(R. Joḥanan) said (to R. Shesheth who was totally blind), I am a Judge and the master is no Judge,’ i.e., R. Shesheth had no right to render a decision in a certain case mentioned <i>ibid.</i> Cf. <i>Rashi ibid.</i> — <i>P.Tesh</i>.</i>",
            "Some say that one is fit to judge only from the age of eighteen and onwards,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tur</i> on the authority of ‘some say,’ derived from Shab. 56b: ‘R. Samuel b. Naḥmani said on the authority of R. Jonathan: Whoever says that Josiah sinned is mistaken, for it is written, <i>And he did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, and walked in all the ways of David his father</i> (II Kings XXII, 2). How then do I explain, <i>and like unto him there was no king before him that returned</i> (Shab) <i>to the Lord with all his heart</i> etc., (<i>ibid.</i> XXIII, 25, whence it follows that at first he sinned). This intimates that he reconsidered every decision that he rendered between the ages of eight (the time of his accession to the throne <i>Ibid.</i> v. 1) and eighteen’ (when the Book of the Law was discovered). He thus re-examined (this is the meaning of <i>Shab</i>) his decisions in the light of the Book of the Law discovered by Ḥilkiah (<i>ibid</i> vv. 1-8). ‘Eighteen’ is taken by <i>Rashi</i> to refer to the eighteenth year of his reign. Hence, it has no connection with the age of the King. Some, however, take ‘eighteen’ (and this is followed by <i>Caro</i> in the present ruling) as the age of the King, i.e., when Josiah was eighteen years of age, the Book of the Law was discovered by Ḥilkiah. At the age of eighteen a person is considered a distinguished and conspicuous individual and has the capability to save the poor from the hand of one who would rob him. This is one of the attributes of a Judge (v. <i>Tur</i> a.l.) — <i>M.E.</i> , also Aboth V, 21.</i> and [provided] he has grown two pubic hairs.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deduced from Mishna Yeb. 96b: ‘It is all one (i.e., with respect to illegal cohabitation) whether he is of the age of nine years and a day or whether he is of the age of twenty years and has not grown two pubic hairs.’ Thus we see that if one has not produced the signs of maturity, he still counts as a minor. Cf. Nid. V, 9. Hence, the present ruling.</i> And some say that from the age of thirteen years [plus one day] and onwards, one is eligible to judge, even if he has not grown two pubic hairs.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Derived from Y. San. IV, 9(22b): ‘R. Abbahu states on the authority of R. Joḥanan: Even one who is less than twenty years old and has not grown two pubic hairs, is eligible to try civil suits but not capital charges.’ Although the age of thirteen is not mentioned in this text, it goes without saying that the Judge must not be less than thirteen years and a day, for only then is one designated an adult. As to the text in Shab. <i>ibid.</i>, this viewpoint accepts the interpretation of <i>Rashi</i> (v. n. 12 <i>supra</i>). Cf. also the reading in Shab. <i>ibid., ‘until eighteen’</i> (<span>עד י״ח</span>). Were <i>‘until eighteen years of age’</i> meant the reading should have been <span>עד בן י״ח</span>. , <i>Maharsha</i> a.l. The underlying reason for the second viewpoint is that although with reference to valid testimony it is required that the witnesses possess signs of maturity, deduced from, <i>then both the men between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the Lord</i> (Deut. XIX, 17. This refers to the witnesses and it is obligatory that they be <i>men</i>, i.e., of mature age. , Sheb. 30a; B.B. 155b), this is not the case with respect to a Judge. In the latter case he must possess a reasoning mind and be versed in the intricacies of the Law. But one who is less than thirteen years old, is ineligible to judge, for being a minor he does not come under the category of observing religious duties according to Biblical Law. However, a difficulty presents itself on the basis of the principle, ‘Whoever is fit to judge is eligible to testify’ (Mishna Nid. 49b), which conversely, would mean that ‘whoever is unfit to judge is ineligible to testify.’ Consequently, it follows that according to the first opinion recorded in the present ruling, one who is thirteen years of age and has grown two pubic hairs would be ineligible to testify, and again, according to the second viewpoint, one who is thirteen years of age but has not produced two pubic hairs would be ineligible to judge. This difficulty may be removed on the assumption that the above-mentioned principle was meant to assimilate testimony and adjudication with respect to the minority age of the individual only, for in both cases, a minor, i.e., one less than thirteen years and a day is unfit — <i>M.E.</i> In civil suits involving immovable property (<span>קרקעות</span>), he may not judge until he produces two pubic hairs, for otherwise, his transaction is considered invalid in immovable property ( B.B. 155b; <i>infra</i> § 35, 3; § 235) — <i>Tummim. Mishkenoth Ya‘akob</i> supports the first view recorded in the present ruling, but concludes that a Judge should be appointed when he is at least twenty years old. <i>Shebuth Ya‘akob</i> states that in the case of one who judges alone we should adopt a stringent view and one should not judge before he is forty years old unless there is none other greater than he available in that city (v. Y.D. § 242, 31, <i>Gloss</i>). But with respect to one who is a member of a Court of three, it is permissible for him to judge even before he reaches his fortieth year, for his decision should not be regarded as inferior to that of a Court of three laymen whose decision is binding — <i>P.Tesh</i>. , also <i>P.Tesh</i>. to Y.D. <i>ibid. A.H.</i> writes that the above rulings are only added stringencies, and that according to Biblical Law, it seems that if the individual has grown two pubic hairs and is thirteen years of age plus one day, he may be a Judge. Before he produces the two pubic hairs, his decision is not binding (<i>contra</i> second opinion), for a minor’s act is ineffective.</i>",
            "A woman is ineligible to judge.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">B.K. 15a (v. parallel passages) : ‘In the School of Eleazar it was taught: <i>Now these are the ordinances which thou shalt set before them</i> (Ex. XXI, 1), — the Scriptural text places a woman on the same level with a man as regards all the judgments of the law’ (i.e., with respect to civil suits). <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>אשר</span> raises the question that <i>before them</i> refers only to those who are eligible to judge but not to those who are judged (v. <i>Torah Temimah</i> a.l.). Cf. Git. 88b: ‘<i>before them</i>, but not before laymen,’ and a woman is ineligible to judge, for the Mishna Nid. 49b states that ‘Whoever is fit to judge is fit to testify’ and since a woman is unfit to testify (v. B.K. 88a; Sheb. 30a), it follows that she is unable to judge. Consequently, the above passage that equates man and woman as regards all the judgments of the law refers to woman only from the point of view of being judged in cases where she has monetary claims against another person, but she herself may not act as Judge. As to Deborah, the prophetess concerning whom it is stated that <i>She judged Israel at that time</i> (Judges IV, 4) whence we see that a woman may judge, it may be said that it was permissible only on account of a Divine order, or that she merely taught the Law. But the text serves as no precedent that a woman may judge. , also Y. Yoma VI, 1(43b); Y. Sheb. IV, 1(35b) where it is stated that a woman may not judge because she is ineligible to testify. Cf. also Yad, <i>Melakim</i> I, 5 and <i>RIDBaZ</i> a.l.; Sifre to <i>Shofetim</i> XVII, 15. Although a woman may not judge, nevertheless, a learned woman may instruct law and offer legal directives (cf. <i>supra</i> on Deborah and <i>Sefer ha-Ḥinnuk</i> § 83 and § 152; <i>Sha‘are Teshubah</i> to O.Ḥ. § 461, n. 17 — <i>P.Tesh</i>.</i>",

Aḥa b. Ḥanina said: The Scriptural text states, <i>It is not for princes to say, Where is strong drink</i> (<i>Prov</i>. XXXI, 4), (i.e.,) those engaged in (solving) the secrets of the world (administration of justice, connecting <span>רוזנים</span> with <span>רז</span>, secret) must abstain from strong drink.’ <i>Tosaf. ibid.</i> s.v. <span>העוסקים</span> write that this refers only to the adjudication of capital charges, but not to civil suits. As to the text in ‘Er. 64a: ‘He who drank a quarter of a <i>Log</i> of wine must not render legal decisions,’ it refers to giving a legal decision in ritual law (<span>איסור והיתר</span>. Cf. the expression <span>אל יורה</span>). , also Yad, <i>Bi’ath ha-Mikdash</i> I, 3; Y.D. § 242, 13, <i>Gloss</i>. The present ruling, viz., that in civil suits one who is under the influence of wine may act as a Judge has reference only to a case where there are two other Judges present who will remind him of the law should he err, but a single Judge or three Judges under the influence of wine should not judge — <i>Tummim, Nethiboth</i>. However, according to Num. R. X, 4, one under the influence of wine may not act as a Judge even in civil suits (cf. the expression <span>אל ידון</span> <i>ibid</i>) which contradicts the present ruling. <i>BaḤ</i> and <i>Shebuth Ya‘akob</i> rule that even in civil suits one under the influence of wine is forbidden to act as Judge. Thus also <i>R. Jonah</i> in <i>Sefer ha-Yir’ah</i> makes no distinction between ritual and civil law. In both cases one under the influence of wine must not act as a Judge — <i>P.Tesh. M.E.</i> writes that since our wines nowadays are diluted, we may adopt a leniency with respect to a Judge who partakes of a quarter of a <i>Log</i> of wine.</i> A witness may not act as a Judge.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ket. 21a: ‘R. Abba sat and stated this law, that a witness may act as a Judge. R. Safra raised an objection against R. Abba: If three saw it (the new Moon) and they are of the Court (that sanctifies the new moon), two (of them) stand up and set (two) of their fellows (of the <i>Sanhedrin</i>) beside the one (Judge) and they (the two) bear witness before them (the three who constitute the Court) and (then) they may say, It is hallowed! It is hallowed!, — for a single person is not believed by himself. Now, if you entertain the opinion that a witness may act as a Judge, what is all this for? Let them sit in their places (after testifying) and declare (in conjunction with the third person), the new Moon is hallowed! — He (R. Abba) replied: That also presented a difficulty to me, and I asked R. Isaac b. Martha, and R. Isaac (asked) R. Huna, and R. Huna (asked) Ḥiyya b. Rab, and Ḥiyya b. Rab (asked) Rab, and he said to them, Leave alone the testimony regarding the new Moon (because it is) Biblical and the attestation of documents is Rabbinical (In a Biblical matter a witness may not act as a Judge; in the case of a Rabbinic enactment, e.g., the confirmation of documents this does not apply. Cf. Git. 5b).’ B.B. 113b-114a: ‘Rabbah b. Ḥanina taught a Baraitha before R. Naḥman: (It is written,) <i>Then it shall be in the day that he causeth his sons to inherit</i> (Deut. XXI, 16) — (this teaches) that you may make the division of inheritances during the day, but not at night. Abaye said unto him: But according to this (Abaye assumes that the division of an inheritance is made only when the person died in the daytime) would children inherit him who died during the day and not him who died at night? Perhaps you refer to the adjudication of inheritances (which must take place during the day. , <i>supra</i> § 5), for it was taught: (With the Biblical text), <i>but it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of judgment</i> (Num. XXVII, 11), the whole section (Num. <i>ibid.</i> vv. 1-11 on the laws of inheritance) has been proclaimed as of a judicial nature (The judicial procedure of inheritances is equated to that of civil suits in general. Those who are present form a Court of three even if the testator’s natural heirs are opposed to it. Thus <i>Tosaf.</i> who explain that this refers both to a sickbed bequest as well as to one made by a person in good health. , <i>Rashi</i> to San. 34b). And this is in accord with Rab Judah who said: If three (persons) came to visit a sick person, they may, if they so desire (either) write down (his bequest and thus act as witnesses to the document), or issue a judicial verdict (for since they are three they form a laycourt and thus attest to the instructions of the testator and execute the Will). If two (persons came), they may write down (the instructions and act as witnesses to the document), but may not issue a judicial verdict (for since they are less than three they cannot constitute a Court and merely may act as witnesses). R. Ḥisda stated: This applies only to daytime; at night, however, even three (persons) may (only) record (the instructions of the testator and act as witnesses), but may not form a Court (because at night judicial sessions are not held for the commencement of a trial. , <i>supra</i> §. 5). What is the reason? Because (at night) they (merely) become (eligible to act as) witnesses and a witness may not act as a Judge (this means that even on the following day they may not act as Judges in this matter since the instructions were recorded at night and they became qualified to act as witnesses only).’ Cf. San. 34b. Mishna R.H. 25b: ‘If three saw it … It is hallowed’ (v. first part of this note for text). Gemara <i>ibid.</i> 25b-26a: ‘This means that a witness may act as Judge. May we say that our Mishna is not in agreement with R. Akiba, for it has been taught: If the <i>Sanhedrin</i> beheld a man murder a person, some of them act as witnesses and some of them as Judges. This is the opinion of R. Tarfon. R. Akiba says: They all act as witnesses and a witness may not act as a Judge? — You may even say that our Mishna is in agreement with R. Akiba, but R. Akiba stated this only with respect to capital charges, for the All-Merciful commanded, <i>the congregation shall judge … and the congregation shall deliver</i> (Num. XXXV, 25-26), and since they saw him murder a person, they cannot find any defence in his favour. However, in this case, even R. Akiba agrees (that a witness may act as a Judge).’ Cf. B.K. 90b. , also Y. R.H. III, 1(58d); Y. San. I, 2(18c); <i>ibid.</i> V, 5(23a). There are two fundamental reasons why a witness may not act as a Judge: a) Evidence that is given must be liable to refutation by proving an alibi (<span>עדות שיכול להזימה</span>. , <i>supra</i> § 1, n. 40). Hence, if we should say that a witness may act as a Judge, this principle would not be applicable, for the Judge will never accept any refutation against himself; b) It is written, <i>then both the men between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the Lord, before the priests and the judges that shall be in those days</i> (Deut. XIX, 17), — <i>Both the men</i> refers to the witnesses; <i>between … is</i> applies to the litigants; <i>before the Lord … judges</i> means that they must stand before the Judges. Hence, if a witness may act as a Judge, this exposition would be impossible. Cf. <i>supra</i> n. 14. , Ket. 21b, <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>הנח</span> and par. ref. Consequently, if three persons beheld the incident during the day when it is permissible to hold a judicial session, they constitute a Court of three and are not designated as witnesses. Hence, they may act as Judges as stated anon — <i>M.E.</i></i> [This applies] only [to] a witness who testifies, e.g., if one of the Judges testified<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Together with another person — <i>M.E.</i></i> before his colleagues<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">e., before a Court of three, for hearing evidence is part of the adjudication which requires three Judges to be present. It means that after one of the Judges rises to testify in conjunction with another lay person, the remaining two Judges co-opt a third person to form a <i>Beth Din</i> of three. Consequently, after giving evidence, the witness may not return to sit with the Judges — <i>M.E.</i></i> about a [certain] incident which he beheld, he cannot be combined with them to hold a judicial session regarding that incident.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R.H. 25b-26a and parallel passages. , texts <i>supra</i> n. 17; Ket. 21b, <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>הנח</span> and parallel references.</i> However, if he does not testify, e.g., [in a case] where the three Judges beheld the incident,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i></i> even if they beheld [the incident] with the express intent to be designated as testimony,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i></i> — [the law is that] if they beheld it during the day,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">At which time they were eligible to act as Judges. , <i>supra</i> § 5, 3.</i> they may act as Judges and may hold a judicial session concerning that incident;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>supra</i> n. 20. A judicial session may be held in this case since we can argue that hearing the evidence should not carry greater weight than seeing the incident, and they may hold the judicial session even at a later date just as in the case of hearing evidence in general a judicial session may be held at a later date. Not so, however, when they saw the matter at night, in which case they only become witnesses and cannot act as Judges, for hearing the evidence is also not valid in the first instance if heard at night — <i>M.E.</i></i> but if they beheld it at night,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">At which time judicial sessions are not held. , <i>supra</i> § 5, 2. Likewise, if they beheld the incident on the Sabbath or Festival, they may not act as Judges, although the prohibition against trying cases on these days is only a Rabbinic measure (<i>BaḤ</i>). This question, however, requires further elucidation — <i>ShaK. Ta</i>Z opposes <i>BaḤ</i>, for on the principle that in a Rabbinic matter a witness may act as a Judge (v. <i>Isserles</i> anon and <i>supra</i> n. 17), it should be permissible. <i>Keneseth Ezekiel</i> agrees with <i>BaḤ. Tummim</i> is in agreement with <i>Ta</i>Z. <i>K.H.</i> concludes that we should adopt a leniency in this matter. Hence, they may hold a judicial session on a following day even if they beheld the incident on the Sabbath or Festival — <i>P.Tesh</i>.</i> they may not hold a judicial session on [the strength of] their own evidence.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> <i>supra</i> n. 20. For in this case since judicial sessions are not held at night, they merely become designated as witnesses and we cannot apply the principle, ‘let the hearing of evidence not carry greater weight than seeing the incident,’ since the time of seeing the incident was not the time of hearing the evidence, because we receive no evidence at night — <i>M.E.</i></i> However, on [the strength of] evidence given by others they may act as Judges.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The next day or even many days later.</i> But if they were [originally] ordered to act as witnesses [in a certain matter, — then] even on [the strength of] evidence given by others, they may not act as Judges.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For in this case it carries even lesser weight than beholding the incident at night. Thus <i>RaShBaM</i> to B.B. <i>ibid.</i>, where it is stated that ‘<i>If three persons came to visit a sick man</i> etc.’ (v. <i>supra</i> n. 17), whence it follows that they did not come at the express bidding of the testator to act as witnesses (note the words <span>נכנסו לבקר</span>), for if they were invited or ordered by the testator to come, they would be designated as witnesses, and consequently, even if they came during the day, they would not be able to act as Judges even if other witnesses give evidence.</i> Some say, however, that even if they were [originally] ordered to act as witnesses [in a certain matter], they may act as Judges on [the strength of] evidence given by others.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is similar to beholding the incident at night. Thus <i>Tosaf.</i> to B.B. <i>ibid. RaN</i> rules as follows: If they came with the express intent to act as witnesses, we adopt the view of <i>Tosaf.;</i> but if they were ordered to come and act as witnesse, we follow the opinion of <i>RaShBaM</i>.</i> <i>This entire</i> [<i>ruling</i>] <i>applies to a Biblical Law</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">E.g., the sanctification of the new Moon.</i> <i>but in</i> [<i>the case of</i>] <i>a Rabbinic matter</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">E.g., the confirmation of documents.</i> [<i>the law is that even</i>] <i>a witness</i> [<i>who testified</i>] <i>may act as a Judge</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ket. 21b, <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>הנח</span>; <i>N.Yos. ibid.;</i> San. 34b — <i>G.</i> , <i>supra</i> n. 17. To sum up this ruling, the following principles should be borne in mind: a) Mere intention to act as witnesses of an incident does not invalidate the individuals from acting as Judges; b) Once they have testified they no longer may act as Judges; c) If they beheld the incident during the day, they may act as Judges; if at night, they may act as Judges if others testify; d) If they were summoned to act as witnesses, there is a difference of opinion between <i>RaShBaM</i> and <i>Tosaf.;</i> e) In a Rabbinic matter even a witness who testified may act as a Judge.</i>",
            "[With respect to] one who is summoned to be tried before a Judge who is inferior to him [in learning, — the law is that] the Judge [who summoned him to appear in Court] cannot compel him to go [and be tried] before him, but they call a meeting of the scholars who are [present] there and look into the matter among themselves.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tur</i> on the authority of <i>R. Hai Gaon</i>. Derived from Kid. 70a: ‘A certain individual from Nehardea entered a butcher’s shop in Pumbeditha and stated: Give me meat! They replied: Wait until the attendant of Rab Judah b. Ezekiel takes his and then we shall serve you. He exclaimed, Who is Rab Judah b. Shewiskel (a nickname for Ezekiel, derived from <span>שזיסקי</span> meaning roast, i.e., the eater of roast meat) to take precedence over me and to be served before me? They went and informed Rab Judah (about this), whereupon he pronounced the ban against him. They said to him (further), He (that man) is in the habit of calling people slaves, whereupon he (Rab Judah) announced that he (that man) was a slave (himself). Thereupon that man went and summoned him (Rab Judah) to a lawsuit before R. Naḥman. When they brought the writ of summons, Rab Judah went before R. Huna and asked him, Shall I go or not? (his high office gave him the right not to recognize R. Naḥman’s authority over himself). He (R. Huna) answered: Indeed you must not go because you are a distinguished personage, but on account of the honour of the <i>Nasi</i>’s house (R. Naḥman was the son-in-law of the <i>Resh Galutha</i>) arise and go.’ From this passage it follows that one is not obliged to appear before a Judge who is inferior to him. Furthermore, it does not depend upon the age of the Judge who sent the writ of summons, for even if the latter is much older than the scholar who is summoned, nevertheless, if in learning and knowledge he is inferior to him, he cannot compel him to appear before him (cf. B.B. 142b). The same principle applies to a single Judge or a Court of three who sent the writ of summons — <i>P.Tesh</i>. The mode of expression used here indicates that <i>R. Hai Gaon</i> holds that if the defendant agrees to be tried before a Judge who is inferior to him, he may appear before the latter for trial on the principle that ‘A Rabbi who renounces his honour, it is considered renounced’ (Kid. 32a-b). For if this were not so, how can the inferior scholar summon him to law in the first place. Hence, he may summon him only because there is a possibility that the latter may agree to come — <i>P.Tesh</i>. ‘They call a meeting of the scholars … themselves,’ means that the scholars of that locality examine the case together. Consequently, it is no longer disreputable for him to be tried in their presence — <i>Tummim. BaḤ</i> explains that the words, ‘and look into the matter’ means that they investigate the case in order to determine whether it is proper for him to appear for trial or not. In a case where it is not respectable for the scholar to appear in Court with a litigant who is an uncultured person, the Court may send scribes to the scholar’s home in order to record his arguments in writing and then they adjudicate the case on the basis of the recorded information — <i>M.E.</i> , <i>infra</i> § 124.

Consequently, since the law of retaliation operates only if both witnesses are proven to be <i>Zomemim</i>, it follows that if both witnesses are related to each other, each kinsman-witness would be put to death through the testimony of his fellow kinsman-witness (which is impossible on the basis of the text, <i>The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers</i> — Deut. XXIV, 16, — which is explained anon to intimate that all relations, not only fathers and sons, are not to be put to death through the testimony of other relations. , Y. anon and cf. San. 27b-28a). (For) if you say thus (i.e., that witnesses may be related to each other, would not the result be that one kinsman-witness) is put to death on his (i.e., the other kinsman-witness) testimony? Whence is it derived that the witnesses should not be related to the Judges? — This follows from your own logical deduction, (viz.,) that if they (the witnesses who are related to the Judges) are proven to be <i>Zomemim</i>, would not (the result be that) they (the witnesses) are put to death through their (the Judges’) verdict (i.e., after the Judges receive the refutation of the testimony that was given by the witnesses who were related to the Judges) ? Whence is it derived that the Judges should not be related to each other? — Scripture states : Put to death on the testimony of witnesses (v. Deut.

Derived from Sheb. 30b: ‘Whence do we derive that a Judge who knows his colleague to be a robber or a witness who knows his colleague to be a robber should not join with him (to judge or testify) ? — Because it is said, <i>From a false matter keep far</i> (Ex. XXIII, 7).’ Hence, if the status of his colleague is unknown to him, he may sit with him in judgment. , however, <i>supra</i> § 3, 4: ‘It is forbidden for a wise man to sit in judgment until he knows with whom he sits lest he sit with people who are not suitable and is (then) found to be included in a council of conspirators and not in a <i>Beth Din</i>,’ — whence it follows that as long as one is not certain about the eligibility of his fellow-Judge, he must not join with him, which contradicts the present ruling. <i>BaḤ</i> therefore, explains that <i>supra</i> we deal with a Judge who is distinguished in wisdom and learning, in which case he should first make certain about the eligiblity of his colleague; whereas in the present ruling we treat of an ordinary Judge who is permitted to join with a colleague to sit in judgment unless it is known to him that the latter is a robber or a wicked person. <i>Tummim</i> removes the contradiction by explaining that <i>supra</i> we deal with the commencement of a trial, in which case one must make certain that his colleague is fit to judge; whereas here we deal with a case where the trial had already commenced and he thought that his colleague was an eligible person, but during the proceedings it became clear to him that his colleague was ineligible to judge, in which case the law is that if he knows him to be a robber etc., he must discontinue the proceedings (note the expression <span>לישב</span> employed <i>supra</i> and <span>להצטרף</span> used here). <i>Shebuth Ya‘akob</i> explains that <i>supra</i> we deal with a Judge who does not know his other two colleagues. Hence, he must not sit with them before he determines their eligibility. Otherwise, he is regarded as associating himself with a council of conspirators, since the majority of the members of the Court are unfit to judge. However, if two of the Judges know each other, but they do not know the third Judge, there would actually be no prohibition if they associated themselves with the latter, yet, the pure-minded of Jerusalem would refrain from sitting in judgment with such a Judge until they would be certain about his eligibility (v. <i>supra</i> § 3, n. 33). The present ruling, however, has reference to a case where one of the three Judges knows one of his colleagues to be a robber etc., in which case he must not join with him, even if the third Judge is fit, for although this Court is not regarded as a council of conspirators since the majority of its members are fit, yet, it is forbidden on account of the Biblical injunction, <i>From a false matter keep far</i>. If the litigants accepted the ineligible Judge, there is no prohibition against joining with the latter since there are two eligible Judges, and consequently, it is not considered a council of conspirators and the verse, <i>From a false etc.</i>, is not applicable — <i>A.H.</i></i>",

In the three latter sources the quality of ‘humility’ (<span>ענו</span>) is mentioned after ‘wisdom’ (<span>חכם</span>). The quality of ‘humility,’ however, is not found in the following additional sources: Deut. R. I, 10 to v. 13 <i>ibid.</i>: ‘R. Berekiah on the authority of R. Ḥaninah stated: Judges must possess the following seven qualities: (They must be) wise men (<span>חכמים</span>), understanding (<span>נבונים</span>), full of knowledge (<span>ידועים</span>). Hence we have three. And four more as it is written elsewhere (Ex.

XXXI, 10).’ In the last verse quoted it seems that the Midrash takes <i>a woman of valour</i> (<span>אשת חיל</span>) as equivalent to <i>able men</i> mentioned in Ex. <i>ibid.</i>, i.e., even if the Judges possessed only one quality, it suffices. Cf. Prov. <i>ibid.</i> v. 23: <i>Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land</i>. This refers to the gates of justice where local matter were adjudicated. Hence, the connection between the text in Prov. and that of Ex. , <i>MaHaRZaW</i> to Deut. R. <i>ibid.</i> Cf. also Sifre to Deut. <i>ibid.</i> on the seven qualities that a Judge should possess. <i>Maim.</i> (followed by <i>Tur</i> and <i>Caro</i>) considers ‘wise men’ and ‘understanding’ (<span>חכמים ונבונים</span>) as one quality. Hence, he adds the quality of ‘humility’ (<span>ענוה</span>), although it is not mentioned in Deut. R. However, it seems that he followed San.

            "Every case concerning which there results indirect benefit to the Judge, he [the Judge] cannot adjudicate.

Now if we adopt the opinion that a partner can renounce his interest (v.

Consequently, all are considered interested parties). Come and hear: If one says, Give a <i>Maneh</i> to the poor of my town (and it was stolen, the alleged culprit) … must not be tried by the poor Judges of that town, nor may the poor of that town give evidence … Cannot two of them renounce their interest and adjudicate the case? — Here too, we (treat of) a Torah scroll and the reason why the donor referred to the recipients as poor is because all are poor with respect to a Torah scroll.’ , Yad, <i>‘Eduth</i> XV, 2.</i> unless they have another Torah scroll.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the Synagogue where the Judge or Judges worship.

But if in this Synagogue there is no other Torah scroll available, though there is another Synagogue in town where they have a Torah scroll, yet, in order for the Judges to be permitted to try the case, they must renounce their interest in this Synagogue. This is derived from <i>RaShBaM</i> to B.B. <i>ibid.</i>, s.v. <span>דהכל אצל</span>: ‘All are in need of the Torah scroll, and it is customary to refer to the townspeople who have no Torah scroll as <i>poor</i> (v. text <i>supra</i> n. 58 and), for there is no greater poverty than this.’ It follows, therefore, that only when this is the only Torah scroll they possess that they are designated <i>poor</i>, but if they have in addition another scroll, then after renouncing their interest, they may adjudicate the case and are permitted to read even in the disputed Torah scroll. Thus also <i>Tur; Asheri</i> in <i>Resp.</i> and <i>R. Yeruḥam</i>. Similarly, when the controversy is regarding the Synagogue where the Judge worships, he must renounce his interest in that Synagogue and worship in the other Synagogue; but when he attends his own Synagogue, although he can go to the other Synagogue, despite the fact that he renounces his interest in his Synagogue, he is still regarded as an interested party — <i>M.E. contra ‘Ir Shushan</i>. Moreover, the circumstances must be such that all the townspeople could be accomodated at the other Synagogue. Otherwise, the Judge would still be regarded as an interested party because the law is that townspeople who are in need of a Synagogue may compel each other to build one (v. <i>infra</i> § 163, 1) and consequently, the Judge will also have to contribute. Hence, if the other Synagogue is not large enough to accomodate all the worshippers of the disputed Synagogue, they are all considered interested parties, for they all desire to regain possession of their Synagogue. However, if the Judge’s seat in the disputed Synagogue is his own property, he is not regarded as an interested party, provided the ‘seven representatives of the town’ (<span>שבעה טובי העיר</span>) have no right to sell the Synagogue or the Torah scrolls for the needs of the community (v.

Cf. Sifra to Lev.

If to teach that one must not acquit the guilty or that one must not condemn the innocent, (we may object because) it has already been stated in the Bible, <i>Thou shalt not wrest judgment</i> (Deut. XVI, 19). Hence, even if (the Judge wishes) to acquit the innocent or condemn the guilty, the Torah states, <i>And thou shalt take no gift</i>.’ <i>Ibid.</i> 105b: ‘Why is it called <i>Shoḥad</i> (<span>שוחד</span> taken as contraction of <span>שהוא חד</span>, it is one) ? — Because it is one.’ (the recipient and the donor become one person). Cf. also Sifre to Deut. XVI, 19. The prohibition against accepting bribes refers not only to Judges but to all persons who are entrusted with communal matters although no adjudication of law is involved — <i>P.Tesh</i>. Likewise is it forbidden to accept equal bribes from both litigants although the foregoing reason no longer applies — <i>M.E.</i> The Judge must not accept any gifts from the acquitted party even after the conclusion of the trial — <i>Asheri</i> to San. 27a in the case of Bar Ḥama.</i> and if he accepted it, he must return it when the donor claims it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> XXIII,  Derived from Tem. 4b: ‘Abaye stated: Every act which the Divine Law prohibits, if it has been executed, the act has its legal effect; for if you were to entertain the opinion that the act does not have its legal effect why is one punished by lashes (on account thereof)? But Raba says that the act does not have its legal effect at all and the reason why one is punished by lashes is because he has transgressed a commandment of the Divine Law.’ After a number of texts are adduced according to which in some cases the transgression of a negative command has its legal effect while in others it does not,— concerning which Abaye and Raba agree, — the Talmud continues <i>ibid.</i> 6a-b: ‘R. Aḥa, the son of Raba said to R. Ashi . . In what respect do Abaye and Raba differ? — They differ with respect to direct usury (<span>ריבית קצוצה</span> i.e., lending four <i>Denari</i> in return for five) in accord with R. Eleazar. For R. Eleazar stated: Direct usury can be collected through the Judges, whereas indirect usury (<span>אבק ריבית</span>, lit. ‘dust of usury,’ e.g., if one sells his field and says to the buyer that if he pays him forthwith the price is one thousand Z<i>uz</i>, but if at a later date the price will be more. Consequently, if the buyer pays at the later date, the additional amount is regarded as indirect usury) cannot be collected through the Judges. R. Joḥanan states: Even direct usury is not collected through the Judges (Hence, Raba will conour with R. Eleazar and Abaye with R. Yoḥanan). But do they (Abaye and Raba) differ merely in logical reasoning? Do they not differ in the interpretation of Biblical texts? For R. Isaac said: <i>He hath given forth upon usury and had taken increase</i>: <i>shall he than live? He shall not live</i> (Ez. XVIII, 13), which teaches that the taking of usury is a matter that concerns life but is not liable to restoration (consequently, even Raba who holds that a prohibited act does not have its legal effect, here he will admit that the act is valid on account of the text). R. Aḥa b. Adda says: From here: Scripture states, <i>But fear thy G-d</i> (Lev. XXV, 36), teaching that the taking of usury is a matter of fearing G-d, but is not liable to restoration. Raba stated: From here: <i>He hath done all these abominations</i>: <i>he shall surely die</i>: <i>his blood shall be upon him</i> (Ez. XVIII, 13). <i>Now, lo, if he begat a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood</i> (<i>ibid.</i> XVIII, 10). Those who lend on interest are comparable to those who shed blood. Just as those who shed blood cannot make restoration (of the lost lives), so those who lend on interest are not liable to restoration (of interest). R. Naḥman b. Isaac stated: What is the reason of R. Eleazar? (who maintains that direct usury is collectible through the Judges), for the Biblical text says: <i>That thy brother may live with thee</i> (Lev. XXV, 36) thus teaching that he must restore the interest so that he (the borrower) may live with you.’ Consequently, since the law rests with Raba (excluding certain cases), bribes are equated to usury and are collectible through the Judges, which means that the donor claims it. <i>M.E.</i> writes that if the donor does not claim the return of the gift, the Judge is not obliged to return it, because the donor gave it willingly for the purpose of being acquitted contrary to usury concerning which it is written <i>That thy brother may live with thee</i>. <i>Ta</i>Z disagrees with <i>M.E.</i> on the basis of <i>Rashi</i> to B.M. 61b, s.v. <span>ע״כ ריבית קצוצה</span> according to whom the Court may also compel him to return the usury only if he claimed it. Thus also <i>Ta</i>Z to Y.D. § 161, 5, n. 3. Even if the donor claimed the bribe after a considerable time had elapsed, yet, as long as he did not renounce his rights to it, he may still make a claim. However, it is proper that the recipient of the bribe should return it of his own accord if he wishes to do his duty towards G-d and repent — <i>P.Tesh</i>.</i> Just as the one who receives it transgresses a negative command, so does the donor transgress [the negative command], 'Thou shalt not put a stumbling block before the blind.'<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lev. XIX, 14. Thus Yad <i>ibid.</i>, derived from the law of usury, for just as we deduce the law of returning bribes from the law of usury so too do we deduce from the law of usury that the one who gives bribes transgresses the negative injunction, <i>And thou shalt not put a stumbling block before the blind</i>, i.e., the one who offers a bribe tempts the Judge and thereby places a stumbling block before him. , Mishna B.M. 75b: ‘These transgress a negative injunction : the lender, the borrower, the surety and the witnesses. And the Sages add: the scribe too. They transgress the injunction, <i>Thou shalt not give</i> (<i>him thy money upon usury</i>) [Lev. XXV, 37] and <i>Take thou</i> (<i>no usury</i>) <i>of him</i> (Lev. XXV, 36) and <i>Thou shalt not be to him as a usurer</i> (Ex. XXII, 24) and <i>Neither shall ye lay upon him usury</i> (Ex. XXII, 25) and <i>Thou shalt not put a stumbling block before the blind, but thou shalt fear thy G-d</i>: <i>I am the Lord</i> (Lev. XIX, 14).’ Gemara <i>ibid.</i>: ‘Abaye said: The lender transgresses all (the injunctions); the borrower: <i>Thou shalt not cause thy brother to take usury</i> (Deut. XXIII, 20. Heb. <span>תשיך</span> is in the <i>Hiph‘il</i> which is causitive. Hence, it refers to the debtor), <i>but unto thy brother thou shalt offer no usury</i> (ibid. v. 21), <i>and thou shalt not put a stumbling block before the blind</i>. The surety and the witnesses: only, <i>neither shall ye lay upon him usury</i>.’ One is forbidden to give a bribe to a Gentile Judge on the basis of <i>and thou shalt not put a stumbling block before the blind</i>, for civil laws are also binding upon all Noaḥides. But if it is evident that the Gentile Judge desires to pervert justice in favour of one of the litigants, it is permissible (<i>Ḥatam Sofer</i>) — <i>P.Tesh</i>.</i> And not only a bribe of money [is forbidden] but even a bribe of words [or acts].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ket. 105b: ‘Our Rabbis taught: <i>And thou shalt take no bribe</i>.

Yoḥai stated: Whence is it derived that if one is his neighbour’s creditor for a <i>Maneh</i>, the latter must not extend a greeting to him if he was not in the habit of doing this? — From the Biblical verse, <i>Usury of any word which may be usury</i> (Deut. XXIII, 20), — even speech is prohibited.’ Thus we see that it is forbidden only when the debtor was not in the habit of extending a greeting to the creditor, for then it is clearly evident that the purpose of the greeting is on account of the loan he received. But if it was his usual practice to extend a greeting, we consider the debtor’s greeting as of a mere incidental nature. Cf. B.M. 64b, Tosaf. s.v. <span>אבל חצר</span>. Similarly in the present case.

            "One who takes payment to act as a Judge, all the judgments that he pronounced are void,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishna Bek. IV, 6(29a): ‘If a man takes payment to act as a Judge, his judgments are void.’ Gemara: ‘How do we know this? — Rab Judah stated on the authority of Rab: The Biblical verse says, <i>Behold I have taught you</i> etc., (Deut. IV, 5). Just as I teach gratuitously, so must you teach gratuitously. It was likewise taught thus: Scripture states: <i>Even as the Lord my G-d commanded me</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) — (i.e.,) just as I teach gratuitously, so must you teach gratuitously.’ <i>Tosef</i> (Z). Bek. III, 8: ‘One who is suspected (<span>החשוד</span>) of taking payment and (then) judges; (or taking payment) and (then) gives evidence, all the judgments that he pronounced and all the evidences that he gave are void.’ Cf. also Y. San. I, 1(18b) beg. Thus also <i>RaN</i> to Kid. II end, since the Mishna <i>ibid.</i> states <i>‘his judgments’</i> (<span>דיניו</span>) and not <i>‘his judgment’</i> (<span>דינו</span>). In the light of these sources we may say that not only where we know for certain that he received payment for pronouncing judgment, but also with respect to those regarding which we may entertain a suspicion that payment was taken by the Judge, we rule that they are null and void. Hence, it follows that where we know for certain that the Judge did not take payment for his decision, the judgment is binding. <i>BaḤ</i> writes that if the Judge took payment for adjudication, <i>legally</i> he does not have to return the money. It is only when he received money as a bribe that he is obliged to return it, for in the latter case an explicit Biblical principle has been transgressed (v. <i>supra</i> par. 1). Others maintain <i>contra BaḤ</i> that even when accepted as payment, it must be returned — <i>P.Tesh</i>. The judgments are regarded as void only from the moment we discover that the Judge took payment to act as Judge, for we say that only now has his status been impaired — <i>Nethiboth</i>. The adopted practice for both parties to give the Judge aught prior to the pronouncement of judgment dates back to former times when a communal measure was in vogue, enacted originally for the maintenance of the Judges. Hence, even nowadays when a Rabbi or Judge is appointed by a community it is as though a stipulation were made with the community to pay something to the Judge to pronounce judgment, since this was the original custom — <i>Nethiboth</i>. The other Judges of the Court are not disqualified on account of the Judge who took payment to pronounce judgment. Furthermore, his decision are null and void only with respect to discretionary judgment (<span>שודא דדייני</span>), i.e., where the Judges use their discretion to which of the litigants to adjudicate the claim, but not in the case where an explicit law is involved — <i>P.Tesh.</i></i> unless it is known that [in certain cases] he did not take payment [to act as Judge].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">e., that particular decision is binding, although he took payment for other judgments before or after this. This should not be compared to the case of one who transgressed a Biblical injunction where the law is that all his judgments and evidences are void until he repents, for here it is different since he did not transgress any Biblical principle and the fact that his judgments or evidences are regarded void is merely a penalty imposed by the Sages — <i>M.E.</i> Cf. previous note.</i> However, if he takes payment only [to compensate] the loss of his [regular] work, it is permissible, provided it is clearly evident to all that he takes payment only [to compensate] the loss of his [regular] work, e.g., where he [the Judge] has special work to execute at the time that he has to act as Judge<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ket. 105a in the case of Karna who received compensation for loss of work that could be ascertained since he was engaged in smelling tests at wine stores for which he was paid a fee.

Similarly, if both litigants are either poor or rich. The Talmud is stating ‘a point in favour of a poor man or against a wealthy man’ contains a remarkable feature (<span>רבותא</span>), viz., that the disciple should not think that although legally the poor man has a point in his favour, nevertheless, ‘My master must feel that a wealthy man is right, for how is it possible that a wealthy man should make a false claim against a poor man.’ Notwithstanding this line of reasoning, the disciple is dutibound to speak up — <i>RaShaL, Tummim</i>.

For it has been taught: If one was (unintentionally) transgressing a precept of the Torah, his son should not say, Father you transgressed a Biblical precept, but say… Father, the following verse is written in the Torah’ (by stating the verse indirectly his father will not be put to shame). Hence, this applies much more so in the case of his master, because the accepted principle is that respect for one’s teacher takes precedence over respect for one’s father (v. B.M. 33a). Ḥag. 14b: ‘(R. Eleazar b. ‘Arak) said to him (R. Joḥanan b. Zakkai) : Master, permit me to say something before you which you have taught me.’ From the exposition that follows it appears that this was a novel interpretation that he had not heard from R. Joḥanan b. Zakkai. Nevertheless, it is a sign of respect that when one states something before his master, he should say, You have taught me. , additional references in <i>W.G.</i> and cf. <i>Be’er Eliyahu</i> a.l.</i>"

However, in Yad <i>ibid.,</i> par. 8, <i>Maim</i>. in stating the law, a) of one who was in the city (<span>בעיר</span>) and did not appear in Court after receiving a legal summons, has ‘<span>לערב</span>,’ i.e., he is placed under the ban the very same day in the evening; yet, in the same par., when stating the law of one who was in a country town (<span>בכפרים</span>) and did not appear in Court even after the third summons, <i>Maim.,</i> has ‘<span>עד למחר</span>,’ i.e., he is placed under the ban only on the morrow. On the other hand, <i>Caro</i> has both in a) and b) <span>למחרתו</span>, i.e., on the morrow and in the present ruling has <span>לערב</span> in the evening. The following explanation is advanced in order to remove the apparent discrepancy. In Yad <i>ibid.,</i> par. 8, both in a) and b), we are informed that the party is not placed under the ban before the end of the day. In a) <span>לערב</span> (in the evening) is used, i.e., the beginning of the following day; in b) <span>עד לערב</span> (on the morrow) is used, i.e., the morrow of the following day. The reason why <i>Maim</i>. uses both terms is in order to teach us the remarkable feature of this law, viz., in a) where only one day is given to him to appear in Court, since he is in the city, consequently, we adopt a stringency and pronounce the ban at the <i>beginning</i> of the following day, i.e., ‘in the evening;’ in b) where he departs from and returns to the city in which case we give the defendant three terms, we adopt a leniency and give him time until the morning of the following day. Hence, the term <span>עד למחר</span> (until the morrow). Since, therefore, legally there is no difference, for both terms refer to the next day, <i>Tur</i> has only <span>למחרתו</span> ‘on the morrow,’ and he is followed by <i>Caro</i> in rulings a) and b), who also has <span>למחרתו</span>. It is quite possible however, that in par. 1 <i>supra, Caro</i> also holds that the ban is pronounced in the evening, but the reason he mentions <span>למחרתו</span> (on the morrow) is merely to inform us that on the morrow they publicize the fact that the defendant had been placed under the ban on the preceding evening, and in our present ruling, <i>Caro</i> simply states the law of decreeing the ban in the evening following <i>Maim.</i> — <i>M.E.</i> , however, <i>W.G.</i> and <i>Be’er Eliyahu</i> a.l. for further comments.</i> <i>And so much the more</i> [<i>if he was summoned</i>] <i>by the Court messenger</i> [<i>himself</i>], <i>although he</i> [<i>the Court messenger</i>] <i>did not return</i> [<i>to Court</i>] <i>and state, 'I have carried out my commission</i>.'<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tur</i> — <i>G.</i> For we might have thought that if he does not return to the Court of Law to inform them that he had carried out their commission there is the possibility that the party was not informed thereof — <i>M.E.</i></i> When does this apply [viz., that we place him under the ban]? — Where [it is known that] he [the defendant on returning home] via the route that he is accustomed to take, does not [pass] by the locality of the Court of Law; but if his route [goes] by them [viz., the members of the Court of Law], they do not place him under the ban until the [Court] messenger himself conveys [the summons] to him, for fear that the neighbours had not informed him thereof, for they might think [that since] his route [passes] by the door of the Court of Law, he had already passed by them<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus Yad.</i> [and the summons was conveyed to him] and [then] he left.

This has reference even to a case where the Judge had not yet heard the pleas of the litigants, or even if he did hear the pleas but is in doubt which way the judgment will incline, — yet, since he was appointed by the public he is bound to try the case; whereas one who is not an appointed Judge may withdraw under these conditions. Cf. the following sources which substantiate this ruling: Sifre to Deut. I, 16: <i>‘And I charged your judges at that time saying</i>: <i>Hear the causes between your brethren</i> etc. — In former days you possessed your own authority; from now on you are slaves and subject to the community.’ Sifre to Deut. I, 17: ‘Lest you say, I am afraid of So-and-so who might put my son to death, or might set my stack of grain on fire, or might cut down my young trees, — the text reads, <i>Ye shall not be afraid of the face of any man.</i> And so too, does it state with regards to Jehoshaphat, <i>and he said to the judges</i>: <i>Consider what ye do, for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord</i> (II Chron. XIX, 6).’ The expression <i>I am afraid of So-and-so</i> etc., indicates that we deal here with a case where one of the litigants is of powerful influence, but since the Judges were appointed they could not withdraw froom the case. <i>W.G.,</i> however, disagrees with <i>Caro</i>’s ruling, viz., that in the case of an appointed Judge he may not withdraw even if he did not hear the case or even if he did hear the case, but is in doubt which way the judgment will incline, where the litigants are of unequal influence. For even in the case of an appointed Judge, <i>W.G.</i> maintains that it is only <i>after</i> he has heard the pleas and knows which way the judgment will incline that he cannot withdraw. And as to the above text in Sifre, ‘In former days (i.e., prior to your appointment as Judges),’ — it has reference even to a case where both litigants were of strong influence at which time you could withdraw before you heard the pleas, or where you had heard the pleas but were in doubt as to the verdict, — for even in such a case there is still the possibility that the litigant who will be pronounced guilty, might harass the Judge, but where only one of the litigants is of strong influence, even an appointed Judge is permitted to withdraw before the pleas are heard etc. Appointed Judges are subject to the community and cannot withdraw save where both litigants are of powerful influence. Furthermore, the text in San. <i>ibid.</i> which also adduces the Biblical verse, <i>Ye shall not be afraid of the face of any man,</i> addressed to appointed Judges, found in Sifre <i>ibid.,</i> — clearly states that we deal with a case where one litigant was of weak and the other of strong influence and only <i>before</i> the pleas are heard can the Judge wihtdraw. It follows therefrom that the exposition in Sifre <i>ibid.,</i> ‘Lest you say etc.,’ also deals with similar circumstances. Hence, <i>W.G.</i> would not agree with <i>Isserles’ Gloss</i> anon. Cf. also <i>Hag. Asheri</i> to San. III who State the case of Mar ‘Ukba who refused to act as Judge (although he was an appointed Judge. v. Shab. 55a) in a case where he knew that the litigants will not accept his decision (v. San. 29a), which is equivalent to a case where one litigant is of strong influence and the pleas had not been heard. In short, even an appointed Judge is not bound to try the case of strong and weak litigants prior to hearing the pleas or before he knows which way the judgment will incline.</i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>So too, if they were both powerful</i> [<i>litigants</i>] <i>he is required to try their case</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Hag.

If a Judge sees that his other two colleagues (who are incompetent) are perverting justice, he may, when requested to give his legal opinion in the matter, say, ‘I know not the law in this case,’ as a result of which other Judges will be co-opted to form a majority against the incompetent Judges (v.

When the matter was submitted to arbitration, it was ruled that <i>A</i> be exempt from the imposition of an oath on condition that he pay instead a certain amount of money. <i>A,</i> however, claims that <i>B</i> too, was originally obliged to take a number of oaths, — yet, in the latter case the arbitrator did not decide that he be exempt therefrom by paying money instead. In addition, <i>A</i> claims that certain oaths were overlooked entirely. b) The original agreement upon submitting the case to arbitration referred only to the elimination of oaths, but not to any other part of the case. However, according to the decision of the arbitrator, the settlement took into account the case as a whole. Hence, <i>A</i> contends that the entire decision is invalid. <i>Responsum</i>: Argument a) is not valid because undoubtedly the arbitrators have their reasons for acting thus only with respect to the oaths that <i>A</i> was required to take. Argument b), however, is a valid one and consequently, it must be reconsidered. We do not apply the principle that since one of the argument is valid then the whole case should be reconsidered. Should <i>A,</i> however, show that one argument depends upon the other, there is the possibility that the entire case must be reconsidered, but this must first be clearly established before invalidating the decision. Where the Judge is requested to arbitrate a case and render a decision that would be related to strict law (<span>פשרה קרובה לדין</span>), the law is that not more than one third less than the amount the defendant would have to pay according to strict law, is regarded a valid settlement in such a case.

Joḥanan : An expert slaughterer who did not slaughter properly (as a result of which the animal became ritually unfit for consumption) is held responsible even if he was as skilled as the slaughterers of Sepphoris… Did not Rabbah b. Bar Ḥanah state that a similar case came before R. Joḥanan in the Synagogue of Maon and he said to the slaughterer, Go and bring proof that you are an expert to slaughter hens and I will exempt you? — There is no difficulty. The latter law (has reference to a slaughterer who worked) gratuitously; the former (where the slaughterer does it) for hire… A certain woman showed a <i>Denar</i> to R. Ḥiyya and he informed her that it was good. Subsequently, she came to him again and said to him, I showed it later (to others) and they informed me that it was bad, and I could not pass it. He then said to Rab, Go and exchange it for a good one … R. Ḥiyya (although he was an expert and needed no further instruction in this matter, and consequently, would be exempt) acted beyond the requirements of the line of justice, as R. Joseph learnt: <i>And shalt show them</i> (v. Ex. XVIII, 20) refers to their livelihood; <i>the way</i> refers to acts of lovingkindness; <i>they must walk</i> refers to visiting the sick; <i>wherein</i> refers to burial <i>and the work</i> refers to law; <i>which they</i> <i>must do</i> refers to (acting) beyond the requirements of the line of justice.’ , also B.M. 30b in the case of R. Ishmael b. R. Jose. Hence, we see that acting beyond the requirements of the law, although it is derived from a Biblical text, and in the eyes of the Judges it would be the proper thing to do, yet, it cannot be enforced by the Court of Law. Cf., however, B.M. 83a: ‘Some carriers (negligently) broke a barrel of wine that belonged to Rabbah b. R. Huna (Thus <i>Alfasi.</i> Cur. edd. : ‘b. Bar Ḥanan’). Thereupon he confiscated their cloaks; so they went and told Rab about it. Give them back their cloaks, said the latter. Is this the law, he asked. Yes, he answered, <i>That thou mayest walk in the way of good men’</i> (Prov. II, 20). Hence, we may ask why this is not derived from the above-mentioned text? <i>RI of Orleans</i> in B.K. 100a, <i>Tosaf</i> s.v. <span>יפנים</span> explains that acting ‘beyond the requirements of the law’ has reference only to a) a case where others under the same circumstances would be liable to pay but not he, as in the case of R. Ḥiyya and R. Ishmael b. R. Jose mentioned above, whereas in b) a case where there is no distinction between him and others (i.e., everyone would be exempt) as in the case of Rabbah b. Bar Huna, such action is merely a case of <i>That thou mayest walk in the way of good men.</i> Consequently, in a) acting beyond the requirements of the law is considered Biblical, whereas in b) it is based on post-Mosaic tradition. Hence, our present ruling refers to a). Cf. also B.M. 24b and <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>לפנים</span>. There are thus three degrees of acting beyond the requirements of the law: a) where the responsibility is such that it does not even come within the purview of acting beyond the requirements of the law. Consequently, one who out of equity acts thus, <i>walks in the way of good men.</i> E.g., the carriers who negligently broke a barrel of wine belonging to Rabbah b. R. Huna who suffered damages; b) where everyone would be exempt and should not even come under the category of acting beyond the requirements of the law, but since no damage was caused as in a), one should act beyond the requirements of the law. E.g., the case of the ‘found asses’ in B.M. 24b (v. passage <i>infra</i> n. 17) ; c) where everyone else would be held responsible, in which case acting beyond the requirements of the law is based on a Pentateuchal text, although such action cannot be enforced. E.g., the case of R. Ḥiyya. Our present ruling refers to c). , also <i>BaḤ</i> for other interpretations.</i> <i>However, some differ with</i> [<i>this opinion</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Mord.</i> to B.M.

Judah once went after Mar Samuel in a street of whole meal dealers and asked him: What is the law if one found a purse here? — (Mar Samuel) answered: It belongs to the finder. What is the law if an Israelite came and produced an identification mark? — (Mar Samuel) answered: He would be required to return it. Both (views contradict each other)! — (Mar Samuel) answered: One should act beyond the requirements of the law. So too, the father of Samuel found asses in a desert and (yet) he returned them after a year of twelve months: he (acted) beyond the requirements of the law.’ In this passage, the expression ‘it belongs to the finder’ (<span>הרי אלו שלו</span>) indicates that <i>legally</i> it belongs to the finder. Consequently, the subsequent statement ‘he would be required to return it’ (<span>חייב להחזיר</span>) refers to doing one’s duty towards G-d. In addition the expression ‘he returned them etc.,’ (<span>אהדרינהו למרייהו</span>) indicates thhat he did this on his own. Moreover, he was only obliged to return their worth (v. <i>Tosaf.,</i> B.M. <i>ibid.</i> s.v. <span>לבתר</span>). Derived also from the case of the ‘carriers’ (B.M. 83a. Cf. passage quoted <i>supra</i> n. 16), since it is not stated that they came before Rab for trial but rather ‘they went and told Rab about it,’ i.e., to use his influence by means of words of persuasion. Thus also <i>Asheri</i> to B.M. II who considers this a case of acting beyond the requirements of the law and cites the Biblical text <i>which they must do</i> (v. <i>supra</i> n. 16) and would be <i>contra Tosaf.</i> Hence, according to this opinion all cases of acting beyond the requirements of the law are similar and in all cases mentioned above we cannot compel anyone to act beyond the requirements of the law. The interpretation here follows <i>W.G.</i> and <i>Be’er Eliyahu.</i> , <i>BaḤ</i> for other interpretations.</i>",
            "It is permissible for the Court of Law to forgo [certain] rights in property belonging to orphans [provided this is carried out by a settlement] out of Court in order to set them at peace from [entering into future] disputes.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus <i>Isserlein.</i> Derived from B.K. 21a: ‘A certain man built a mansion on the ruins belonging to orphans.

(When R. Naḥman) said to him, Go and make a peaceful settlement with the orphans, he paid no attention. R. Naḥman, therefore, confiscated the mansion from him.’ This shows that although legally the defendant was responsible in full, nevertheless, R. Naḥman suggested at first a peaceful settlement. Likewise, the legal guardian of the orphans may make a settlement on behalf of the orphans which would ultimately be advantageous to their welfare. He should, however, make the settlement in accordance with a recognized Court of Law — <i>P.Tesh.</i></i>",

Naḥman on his own stated: When they reach their majority, they cannot protest, for if so, where is the power of the authority of the Court of Law?’ Since in legal matters we adopt the ruling of R. Naḥman, it follows that the Court of Law or the guardian have the right to make a settlement for the benefit of the orphans and this remains in force even when they reach their majority. Moreover, even if the Court of Law had not issued a decree, the orphans cannot protest against the settlement when they reach their majority, because since this was done for their benefit it is tantamount to a legal transaction consumated on behalf of orphans which is binding even when they become of age — <i>Nethiboth.</i></i>",

But it had no molars or (front) teeth to eat with and it died. Said R. Rami b. Ḥama : How should Judges decide this case? Shall we say to the administrator, Go and pay; then he will retort, I committed it to the care of the cowherd (and he should have told me that it does not eat). Shall we say to the cowherd, Go and pay; then he will reply, I put it among the other oxen and I threw food before it; it was impossible to know that it was not eating anything. Now, let us see: The cowherd is a paid trustee of the orphans and should have looked into the matter (whether the ox eats or not) ? — If there were a loss to the orphans, it would be so, but here we deal with a case where there is no loss to the orphans, for they found the owner of the ox (i.e., the seller) and the orphans received their money back from him (on grounds that it was a purchase made in error). Then who is the complainant? — The owner of the ox pleads that he (the administrator) should have informed him. But what could he inform him? He certainly knows that it was a purchase made in error! — He (the owner of the ox) was a middleman who buys here and sells there (immediately). Therefore, he (the middle-man) swears that he knew not (of the animal’s condition) and the cowherd pays the lower price of meat.’ This has reference to two-thirds of the usual price and was considered a sort of settlement because the cowherd advanced the plea, ‘I put it among the other oxen etc.’ Thus <i>Rashi. Tosaf.,</i> however, state that the verdict was in accord with strict law, for if the cowherd were to inform the middleman about it, the latter would have had to slaugther it and sell it at a cheap price, not being able to wait until the market day.

B.K. 40a-b: ‘It has been stated: If a man borrowed an ox on the supposition that it is a <i>Tam</i> but was later discovered to have already been formally declared a <i>Mu‘ad</i> (then if it repeated to gore) the owner pays one half of the damages and the borrower pays (the other) half of the damages. But why should the borrower not contend against the owner, I borrowed an ox, I did not borrow a lion? — Rab said: We deal here with a case where the borrower knew that the ox was a gorer (although he knew not that the ox was formally declared a <i>Mu‘ad</i>). Let him therefore plead: I borrowed an ox in the state of <i>Tam,</i> but I did not borrow an ox that was formally declared a <i>Mu‘ad?</i> — Because the owner might retort: In any case, even if the ox had been a <i>Tam,</i> you would have to pay half-damages? Now, too, you must go and pay half-damages. Let him (the borrower) still contend against him: Were the ox in the state of <i>Tam,</i> damages would have to be paid out of its body (the indemnity would be collected from a sale of the animal and not from my best possessions. , Ex. XXI, 35) ? — Because the owner might retort: In any case, would you not have to compensate me (the full value of) the ox? Let him (the borrower), however, plead: Had the ox been a <i>Tam,</i> I would have admitted (the act of goring) and be exempt from making payment (because he who confesses an act with which a fine is connected, — in this case the half-damages which may be considered as of a penal nature — is exempt from the fine). And even according to the one who maintains (v. B.K. 15a) that half-damages is a civil liability (and by making a confession he would not be exempt), the borrower might still contend: Were the ox in a state of <i>Tam,</i> I would have caused it to flee to the meadow (and would have thus avoided payment out of its body which is the law in the case of <i>Tam.</i> , Ex. <i>ibid.</i>) ? — We deal here with a case where the Court of Law took steps first and seized the ox. If so, why should the owner pay half-damages? Let him contend: You were the cause of making my ox fall into the hands of one with whom I cannot go to law? — Because the borrower might argue against him: Were I even to have returned it to you, would they not have taken it from you? But let the owner say to the borrower: Were you to have returned it to me, I would have caused it to flee to the meadow? — Because the borrower might retort: In any case, would the damages not have been paid from the best of your possessions (since the ox was designated <i>Mu‘ad</i> while still in the possession of the owner) ? — This would be a valid argument (by the borrower) where the owner possessed property, but what can be said where the owner possessed no property? — Because the borrower can say to the owner: As well as I am obliged to pay you (i.e., to restore the ox), I am obliged to pay him (the plaintiff who is your creditor). This follows from (the dictum of) R. Nathan. For it was taught: R. Nathan stated: How do we know that if a man claims a <i>Maneh</i> (100 Z<i>uzim</i>) from another and the latter (claims a similar amount) from a third, that money is collected from the one (the last) and given to the other (the first) ? From the verse (Num. V, 7) : <i>And give it unto him whom he hath trespassed</i> (translating: And he [the last debtor] gives it unto him [the first] to whom he [the second] is indebted).’ The argument: <i>‘I would have caused it to flee to the meadow’</i> is attacked by <i>Tosaf.,</i> a.l. s.v. <span>הוה מערקנא ליה</span> because this would certainly be regarded as an illegal act according to R. Akiba (<i>contra</i> R. Ishmael in B.K. 33a) who is of the opinion that both the plaintiff and the defendant become joint owners of the ox and consequently by causing the ox to escape to the meadow the defendant is regarded as a robber. Furthermore the Court of Law has a right to pronounce the ban against the defendant if he evades payment of damages. Therefore, <i>Tosaf.</i> explain that what is really meant by this argument is this: By causing the ox to flee to the meadow the plaintiff would have made a settlement with me for a small amount. Consequently, the borrower by not returning the ox to the owner has caused the latter damages by having to pay the difference between the settlemnt and the full amount of damages. This explanation of <i>Tosaf.</i> contradicts <i>Caro</i>’s present ruling according to which one is forbidden to employ evasive means in order to obtain the consent of the plaintiff to make a settlement and to forgo the difference. <i>W.G.</i> removes this contradiction by explaining that in B.K. the circumstances are entirely different because the borrower has a valid plea against the owner, viz., that the latter can have nothing against him, since he borrowed the ox on the assumption that it was <i>Tam</i> and it was discovered that it was declared <i>Mu‘ad,</i> consequently, he is not responsible for making any payment towards a liability which is in a different category. Hence, he may employ a vague and paltry reply, namely, <i>‘I would have caused it to flee to the meadow.’</i> The same vague reply could be given by the owner, but it does not mean that it is permissible to actually do so. In short, it means that under the circumstances one may state that he would have acted thus, but not that it is really permissible to do this (v. <i>Be’er Eliyahu</i>). In the present ruling however, we are told what the final law is in such a case. <i>Tummim</i> advances another interpretation. In B.K. we deal with a case where the owner may be trying to collect an old loan from the plaintiff, but he has no witnesses to prove this. Consequently, under the circumstances he may employ evasive means to recover his debt. <i>Shebuth Ya‘akob</i> differentiates between <i>Tosaf.</i> and our present ruling as follows : In B.K. by causing the animal to escape to the meadow it would be considered merely an indirect act, which is permitted on the principle, ‘sit and do nothing’ (<span>שב ואל תעשה עדיף</span>), i.e., it is better not to act directly in doubtful cases; whereas in the present ruling the prohibition is against a direct act to force one into a settlement through evasive means. , also Sheb. 31a that it is forbidden to use evasive means even in support of the truth. <i>Tummim</i> and <i>Nethiboth</i> write that the present ruling has reference only where the plaintiff has a just claim, but where the defendant has a valid counterclaim which he cannot ascertain before the Court of Law, he may employ evasive means, provided he does not appear as a wicked person in the eyes of the Judges.</i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>And if he violated</i> [<i>this law</i>] <i>and employed</i> [<i>evasive means</i>], <i>he does not comply with the requirements of Heaven until he restores to him</i> [<i>the plaintiff</i>] <i>what rightfully belongs to him</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>RaShBA</i> in <i>Resp.</i> Cf. B.K. 55b-56a: According to R. Joshua one of the acts for which one is exempt before men but is liable before Heaven, is to hire false witnesses to offer testimony. Regarding this the Talmud says: ‘In what case? Shall we say for his own benefit, then he has to pay back the money (he thus obtained illegitimately) and should be liable even by the judgment of men? — It therefore means for the benefit of his friend.’ Hence, ‘for his own benefit’ must mean that he employed evasive methods. Yet, it states ‘he has to pay back the money’ whence it follows that the money is recovered by the judgment of men which contradicts <i>Isserles</i>’ ruling who states that ‘he does not comply with the requirements of heaven’ which implies that he is exempt by the judgment of men. <i>Isserles</i> must therefore be in in accord with <i>Tosaf</i>. <i>ibid.,</i> s.v. <span>ממונא</span> according to whom if we were to know that they are false witnesses he would have to pay, but since we are ignorant of this, the Talmud cannot very well state that he is exempt by the judgment of men. So too, <i>Isserles,</i> states that ‘he does not comply with the requirements of Heaven’ because by employing evasive means he has thereby kept the entire matter hidden from people so that we are unaware whether he has anything in his possession illegally or not. Hence, the statement, ‘he does not comply with the requirements of Heaven.’</i>",
            "Although the litigants consented [to submit their case] to arbitration before the Court of Law, they can retract so long as a formal agreement was not made with them by means of a <i>Kinyan</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Heb. <span>קנין</span>.  Glos. Thus <i>Tur; Tosaf.; Mord</i>. to San.  This is <i>contra Ra’BIaH</i> and <i>RABaN</i> who hold that if the litigants were silent after hearing the verdict of the arbitrators, <i>Kinyan</i> is not necessary — <i>M.E.</i> This applies even if at the outset the litigants agreed to resort to law <i>contra N</i> who rules that if at first they agreed to be tried in Court then subsequently if they consent to submit to arbitration, it holds good even without <i>Kinyan</i> — <i>M.E.</i> In order for the parties not to retract they must not only accept the arbitration by means of a <i>Kinyan</i> but must also expressly state that So-and-so should act as arbitrators. But if the arbitrators were not specified, they cannot arbitrate the case. However, if the contesting parties appeared before three Judges for trial and subsequently agreed to submit their case to arbitration before them, then <i>Kinyan</i> alone without expressly stating the names of the arbitrators is valid (<i>RaN</i>) — <i>Nethiboth.</i> Accordingly, writes <i>Bigde Yesha,</i> if one states to another, ‘I sell you this according to the appraisal of three persons’ (v. <i>infra</i> § 200, 7), or in the case of selling the <i>Ḥameẓ</i> to a non-Jew before the Festival of Passover (the contract containing the clause that the price of the <i>Ḥameẓ</i> will be fixed according to the appraisal of three competent persons), it would be obligatory to expressly mention the three persons. Yet, in the Talmud and the Codes we find no such requirement and even <i>RaN</i> might not be stating this as a law to be adopted. This matter, therefore, requires further study — <i>P.Tesh.</i> The present ruling that they may retract if no formal agreement was made by means of a <i>Kinyan</i> means that even the plaintiff who consented to submit to a settlement with the defendant and to forgo some of his claims and we might have thought that this comes under the heading of ‘a waiver requires no <i>Kinyan’</i> (<span>מחילה אינה צריכה קנין</span>), — yet, the following distinction should be borne in mind between ‘a waiver’ where the individual of his own accord foregoes certain claims in which case it is binding even without a <i>Kinyan</i> (v. following par. and <i>infra</i> § 241, 2) and ‘a waiver’ which is the result of a settlement through arbitration made by the Judges where a <i>Kinyan</i> is required so that the plaintiff should subsequently not be able to plead against the Judges’ settlement. Hence, even if the Judges told the plaintiff that the defendant will have to pay him a certain amount of the claim and the plaintiff foregoes the balance, a <i>Kinyan</i> is required because the plaintiff foregoes the balance of his claim not of his own accord. Consequently, this implies (Thus <i>D.M.</i>) that if the plaintiff stated <i>after hearing the settlement,</i> ‘I forego certain claims in accord with the verdict of the arbitrators’ or ‘I forego an oath which should have been imposed upon the defendant,’ a <i>Kinyan</i> is not required — <i>M.E.</i></i> for [the law is that] arbitration requires a <i>Kinyan</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">San. 6a. The arbitrators are relied upon that they effected a <i>Kinyan</i> in the event that the litigants deny this. A settlement reached by the litigants alone (i.e., effected by the plaintiff in favour of the defendant), requires no <i>Kinyan,</i> for then it comes under the heading ‘a waiver requires no <i>Kinyan’</i> — <i>ShaK, MaHaRaM Lublin.</i> Cf. however, <i>infra</i> § 22, 3 from which we see that where the plaintiff himself suggests a settlement, if there was no <i>Kinyan,</i> he may retract <i>contra</i> ruling of <i>MaHaRaM Lublin</i> — <i>P.Tesh.</i> However, if there was only one arbitrator who effected the settlement and he is contradicted, viz., that no <i>Kinyan</i> was made, he is not relied upon, on the principle that the evidence of one witness is not accepted in the case of counter-evidence — <i>Tummim.</i> Judges who state that the litigants agreed to be tried before them and the litigants deny this, — the law is that if there are no other witnesses to corroborate the statement of the Judges, the latter may not try this case, for although they are relied upon as witnesses, nevertheless, they cannot try this case on the principle that ‘a witness may not act as a Judge’ (<span>אין עד נעשה דיין</span>). However, arbitrators under the same circumstances are relied upon because a witness may act as an arbitrator — <i>A.H.</i> If they submitted the case to settlement by arbitration through ‘striking hands’ (<span>תקיעת כף</span>), although it does not have the same effect as a <i>Kinyan,</i> nevertheless, the parties may be compelled to fulfil their promise because ‘striking hands’ has the same status as an oath. Consequently, if the litigant dies, the heirs cannot be forced to submit to arbitration. However, in the case of <i>Kinyan,</i> the heirs may be forced to fulfil the <i>Kinyan</i> — <i>Nethiboth.</i> If they submit to arbitration before the representatives of the town (<span>טובי העיר</span>), <i>Kinyan</i> is not required and the parties cannot retract — <i>R.A.Eger</i> (on the authority of <i>BaḤ.</i> Actually found <i>infra</i> § 22, 1, <i>Gloss</i>). Even if the litigants originally came to Court with the express purpose of submitting their case for arbitration, <i>Kinyan</i> is required — <i>BaḤ, Tummim contra RaShaL.</i></i> even if made before three.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">e., even if three Judges effected the settlement. Thus San. 6a, <i>Rashi</i> s.v. <span>והלכתא</span>. Derived from the fact that R. Ashi (Gem. <i>ibid</i>.) who does not require <i>Kinyan</i> makes no distinction between two or three arbitrators. And since the adopted law is that arbitration requires a <i>Kinyan,</i> it follows, even if the settlement by arbitration was made by three.</i> However, if a formal agreement was made with them by means of a <i>Kinyan,</i> they cannot retract even if made before one.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">San. <i>ibid</i>. in accord with the view of the Sages that one is sufficient.

This difficulty may be removed if we realize that <i>Maim.</i> mentions two in order to indicate that in strict law their decision would not be binding (v. <i>supra</i> § 3, 1, n. 1), but in a settlement of arbitration even <i>Maim.</i> will hold that one is sufficient in accord with the Sages — <i>Be’er ha-Golah.</i></i> <i>Gloss</i>: [<i>And this has reference</i>] <i>not only to a formal agreement made by means of a Kinyan, but likewise, if he</i> [<i>the defendant</i>] <i>gave a note of indebtedness</i> [<i>thus</i>] <i>obligating himself</i> [<i>to carry out the settlement</i>],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>B.Yos.</i> on the authority of <i>Resp.</i> by <i>RITBA</i> — <i>G.</i> Ket. 101b: ‘It was taught: One who said to another, I owe you a <i>Maneh,</i> is liable according to R. Joḥanan; but Resh Lakish holds: He is exempt. Under what circumstances should this be understood? If (this has reference to a case) where one said to them (those present when he made this admission), You are my witnesses, what is the reason of Resh Lakish who rules that he is exempt? (for this would be <i>contra</i> San. 29b)? If, where he did not say to them, You are my witnesses, then what is the reason of R. Joḥanan who rules that he is liable? — Actually, this (refers to a case) where he did not say to them, You are my witnesses, but here we deal with one who said to his fellow, I owe you a <i>Maneh</i> (and in the presence of witnesses) gave him a note of indebtedness (in which he admits the debt in his handwriting but it is not attested to by his signature nor by that of witnesses — Thus <i>Rashi</i>). R. Joḥanan holds that he is liable because the items enumerated in a bond (delivered in the presence of witnesses) are as binding as if the one who delivered it said, You are my witnesses; but Resh Lakish holds, He is exempt because the items enumerated in a bond are not binding.’ Hence, we see that a bond is as binding as a <i>Kinyan.</i> Cf. also <i>Asheri</i> a.l. Although <i>Caro</i> (<i>infra</i> par. 13) already states this law, — <i>Isserles,</i> however, refers to a note of indebtedness before the settlement of arbitration is made known. So long as the defendant states in the document, ‘I hereby obligate myself to pay the amount which will be determined by the arbitrators,’ then even if there were no witnesses, it is binding even regarding aught that the defendant is not indebted to him.

He answered him: He is under the obligation of a vow, but he cannot fulfil (his duty of <i>Ḥagigah</i> thereby) ; he is a Nazirite, but he cannot shave (according to his stipulation to purchase the sacrifice with second tithe money, but only with unconsecrated funds, for once he stated, ‘ I take upon myself etc.,’ he remains under the obligation because his dedication to the Lord by word of mouth is equal to what delivery is in private transactions — <i>Rashi.</i> Consequently, the subsequent condition has no legal effect to change the vow).’ Hence, in the present ruling too, since he made a formal agreement by means of a <i>Kinyan</i> to accept the settlement of arbitration, he cannot retract from his obligation to carry out the settlement by merely paying the fine. However, if he stated, ‘Should I not fulfil the settlement of arbitration, I will pay the fine,’ the law is that if he desires he pays the fine and does not have to carry out the terms of the settlement — <i>Nethiboth.</i> Cf. also <i>Ḥelkath Meḥokek</i> and <i>Beth Shemuel</i> to E.H. § 50, 6.</i>",

VI, 3) ? — When he says, When I wish I will become a <i>Nazir.</i> But if he says, When I wish, the Biblical injunction, <i>thou shalt not delay</i> is not applicable? — Said Raba, e.g., If he says, I must not leave the world before having been a <i>Nazir,</i> for he becomes a <i>Nazir</i> from that very moment. This is similar to one who says to his wife, Behold here is your bill of divorce (to become effective) one hour prior to my death in which case she is straightway forbidden to eat <i>Terumah.</i> Hence, we say that he may die any moment. Consequently, here too, (regarding a <i>Nazir</i>) he becomes a <i>Nazir</i> at once, because we say, Perhaps he will die now.’ Thus we see that when one undertakes to fufil something without mentioning any specified time, it takes effect immediately. Consequently, the same principle operates in the present ruling. Cf. also Sifra to Lev. XV, 25. Once the arbitrators state their decision before the litigants, they must not make any changes, for their commission is then considered completed.

But this has reference only to a sale where he receives money for his article. However, in the case of a gift it is not valid because the donor receives nothing in return, and consequently, does not agree to give the recipient ownership rights in the gift (B.B. 47b, <i>RaShBaM,</i> s.v. <span>תליוה וזבין</span>). Further, in the case of a sale if he made a declaration of protest (<span>מודעא</span>) before witnesses that the sale was being forced upon him against his will, the sale is not valid, whereas in the case of a gift, it is not valid even if the donor did not make a declaration of protest as long as the witnesses know that he was under pressure, or where he issued his protest even if they knew not of his duress. Again, in the case of a gift his cancellation of the declaration of protest unlike the case of a sale, is not valid (save where we knew not of his duress and he cancelled his previous declaration of protest — B.B. 48a, <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>אמר</span>; <i>infra</i> § 242, 2). Hence, a settlement of arbitration <i>where the plaintiff has no legal grounds</i> is on the same footing as a gift. Therefore, if we know that the defendant is under pressure, his cancellation of the previous notification or declaration of protest has no legal effect. , <i>Be’er Eliyahu.</i> The present ruling is also applicable where the defendant was forced to take an oath, provided the oath was of such a nature that one could cancel or annul it mentally (although the law is that ‘a mental stipulation is not valid’ <span>דברים שבלב אינם דברים</span> [Kid 49b], in the case of pressure it is effective) and that his verbal statement of the oath should not be contradictory to his mental stipulation (v.

It is for this reason that <i>Asheri</i> (source of <i>Tur</i>’s ruling) writes (to B.B. 3a) that even if one of the partners took possession of his share in the absence of his fellow-partner and even if the latter did not say to him, ‘Go take possession and acquire ownership’ (v.

The present ruling is derived from San. 31b: ‘When R. Dimi arrived (from the Land of Israel), he stated on the authority of R. Joḥanan: One who forces his fellow to stand with him for trial (Thus <i>Yad Ramah</i>), and one of them (the more powerful one) says, Let us attend Court here, while the other says, Let us go to the place of Assembly (v. <i>supra</i> n. 3), he is compelled to go to the place of Assembly. R. Eleazar said in his presence, Rabbi! One who has a claim against his neighbour in the amount of a <i>Maneh,</i> must he expend another <i>Maneh</i> in addition to the (first) <i>Maneh</i> (in travelling expenses)? (Certainly not), but he is compelled to be tried (by the local Court) in his (the creditor’s home town.’ <i>Ibid</i>.: ‘Amemar said: The law is that he (the plaintiff) is compelled to go to the place of Assembly. Said R. Ashi to him: Did not R. Eleazar say, He (the defendant) must attend Court in his (the plaintiff’s) home town? — This applies only where the debtor demands of the creditor (to be tried at the place of Assembly); but if the creditor (demands this, the debtor must yield, because) <i>‘The borrower is servant to the lender</i> (Prov. XXII, 7).’ We thus see that only where the reason <i>‘the borrower is servant to the lender’</i> applies that we compel the debtor to go to the place of Assembly if such is the creditor’s wish; but where this reason is not applicable, e.g., where both litigants are claimants, they are tried in the local Court. This follows <i>Maim.</i> and <i>Caro</i>’s interpretation of place of Assembly (v. <i>supra</i> n. 3).</i> but if the creditor said, 'Let us go to the Supreme Court of Law,' — they compel the debtor and he goes up with him [the creditor].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For only in the case where both are claimants we do not obey the wish of the one who demands to be tried before the Supreme Court (cf. the expression <span>שנים שנתעצמו</span> in San. <i>ibid</i>.). And this applies both to a claim regarding a loan, robbery or damages, since they are both claimants concerning aught which is not in the possession of either of them. In short, it is not firmly established that one of them is a defendant (<span>נתבע</span>), but both are claimants (<span>זה טוען וזה טוען</span>), in which case we do not yield to the demands made by the one who says, ‘Let us be tried by the Supreme Court.’ However, where the litigants fall into the category of a claimant (<span>תובע</span>) and a defendant (<span>נתבע</span>), then we submit to the demand of the claimant — <i>Ta</i>Z. Cf. <i>M.E.</i></i> Likewise, if one party claimed that one injured or robbed him and the claimant wishes to go up [and have the case tried by the Supreme Court of Law], [then] the Court of Law that is in his town compels the defendant to go up with him, and so too, in all analogous cases.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> VI, 7. For in these cases too, the defendant is a servant of the claimant until he pays for the damages or establishes that he was not the cause of the damages. Cf. San. 31b regarding the message that was sent to Mar ‘Ukba in Babylon by the Court of Israel with respect to ‘Ukban, the Babylonian, who complained that his brother Jeremiah wronged him, and instructions were given to ‘Ukban to try him in Babylon, and should the latter not accept the verdict, to see to it that he appears before the Court in Tiberias. Thus we see that not only in the case of a creditor and debtor may we compel the defendant to be tried in the Land of Israel before the Supreme Court, but also in all other cases of injury.

If it is to insist that we study the case carefully, is this not obvious! Rather, it is to give preference to the case if it is first in order.’ <i>‘A lawsuit that comes before him first</i> (<i>in order</i>),’ means that the litigant pleaded his case first and the Judge prepared himself to listen to his case although the claim may have been filed in Court later — <i>M.E.</i></i> but he must give priority to a lawsuit of a scholar<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Whether he is the claimant or the defendant — <i>K.H., A.H.</i> Derived from Sheb. 30a: ‘R. ‘Ulla, the son of R.

R. Joseph, therefore suggested that if ‘Ulla’s case was of such a nature, then because he was a scholar he should give preference to his case).’ The latter alternative possibility is omitted here because we rule today that in matters pertaining to the descretion of the Judges (<span>שודא דדייני</span>) the Judge must be a <i>Mumḥeh</i> (v.

However, if the scholar’s relative came with a lawsuit and the scholar did not inform the Court concerning his relative’s case, he has no priority rights, for in this case we are not obliged to show respect for the scholar’s relative save in the case of the scholar’s wife who enjoys the same privileges as her husband — <i>A.H.</i></i>",

XXI, 21) where the <i>widow</i> is placed before the <i>orphan.</i> This presents no difficulty because the latter text speaks of <i>affliction</i> of the widow or orphan who are forlorn and heartbroken (v. Yad, <i>De‘oth</i> VI, 10) in which case the widow suffers more than the orphan (cf. San. 22b: ‘The death of a man is felt by none than his wife’). But young orphans are not mature enough to realize the gravity of their loss. Hence, in this respect the Bible gives priority to the widow. However, in the case of a lawsuit the orphans are weaker than the widow. Consequently, the orphans receive precedence — <i>Be’er Eliyahu.</i></i> and the lawsuit of the widow takes precedence over the lawsuit of a Scholar,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Whence it follows that the lawsuit of an orphan certainly takes precedence over that of a Scholar which contradicts the ruling in par. 1 <i>supra</i> which is derived from Ket. 105b-106a: where it is related that R. Anan who once accepted a gift (v. reason a.l) from a man who brought a lawsuit to him sent the latter to R. Naḥman to whom he also sent (the following communication): ‘Will the Master adjudicate (the case of) this man because I, Anan, am ineligible to act as Judge for him. Since he dispatched such a message to me, (R. Naḥman) thought, he must be his (R. Anan’s) relative (and one is forbidden to act as Judge or witness in a relative’s action). An orphan’s lawsuit was going on before him and he pondered: This one (i.e., to judge an orphan) is a positive precept and that one (to show respect for a Scholar and consequently, for his relative too) is also a positive precept, but the positive precept of showing respect for the Torah (i.e., for a Scholar on account of his learning) takes precedence. Consequently he put aside the orphan’s lawsuit and placed before him that man’s suit. When the other litigant noticed the honour he (R. Naḥman) was showing him (his opponent whom R. Naḥman thought was R. Anan’s relative) he had nothing to say (i.e., he was intimidated).’ In order to remove the contradiction between the present ruling and that of par. 1 <i>supra</i> the following point should be made: In par. 1 we deal with a case where the legal guardian (<span>אפוטרופוס</span>) of the orphans brought the lawsuit. This is substantiated by the expression <span>דינא דיתמי</span> (not <span>והוו יתמי קמיה</span>) employed in Ket. <i>ibid.,</i> the source of the ruling that we give priority to the Scholar’s lawsuit; in the present ruling we refer to the orphans themselves who appeared in Court — <i>Be’er Eliyahu.</i></i> and the lawsuit of a Scholar takes precedence over the lawsuit of an illiterate person,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">, <i>supra</i> n. </i> and the lawsuit of a woman takes priority over the lawsuit of a man.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yeb. 100a: ‘In former times, when a man and a woman (with different lawsuits) appeared before me for a legal decision, I used to settle the man’s lawsuit first, because I was of the opinion that a man (should receive precedence) being subject to the fulfilment of all the commandments (a woman is exempt from some); when, however, I heard this (the reason why a woman should be given her share of the poor man’s tithe first. , Gem. a.l), I settle a woman’s lawsuit first.

XXIII, 7).’</i> In what manner should he act? — He should investigate and inquire into the matter closely by means of [the methods employed in the] cross-examination and investigation of capital cases.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">San. 32b: ‘R. Papa stated (in reconciling the views of the Mishna [San. 32a] that both monetary and capital cases require examination and inquiry, and the Baraitha [ibid.] according to which examination and inquiry in civil suits are not necessary) … In our Mishna the lawsuit is fraudulent (therefore, there must be a thorough examination and investigation), but in the other (Baraitha) the lawsuit is not fraudulent. This accords with Resh Lakish, for Resh Lakish pointed out an incongruity (between two verses): It is written, <i>In justice</i> (E. <i>‘righteousness’</i>) <i>shalt thou judge thy neighbour</i> (Lev. XIX, 15); and (elsewhere) it is written, <i>Justice, justice shalt thou follow</i> (Deut. XVI, 20. The repetition of the word <i>justice</i> indicates a more thorough investigation). How is this possible? — The latter verse refers to a lawsuit that is fraudulent; the former verse to a lawsuit that is not fraudulent.’ However, this passage contradicts the passage in Sheb. <i>ibid.</i> (v. previous note) according to which the Judge is required to withdraw from adjudicating a fraudulent lawsuit. There are in the main three views held among the <i>Codifiers</i> in order to reconcile these two Talmudic sources. a) <i>Tosaf.</i> (San. 32b, s.v. <span>כאן</span>) maintain that in Sheb. we deal with a lawsuit that we know to be fraudulent. Hence, the Judge is obliged to withdraw from such a case; while in San. we deal with a lawsuit that is suspected of being fraudulent. Consequently, examination and inquiry are required in order to determine for certain the fraudulence in the case. b) <i>Maim.</i> (Yad, <i>ibid.</i>) holds that both in Sheb. and San. we deal with a fraudulent lawsuit only that in Sheb. examination and inquiry had already been applied (note the expression ‘A Judge who knows that a lawsuit is fraudulent).’ Consequently, we apply the verse, <i>From a false matter keep far</i> and the Judge must withdraw from the case. In San., however, we deal with a fraudulent lawsuit where examination and inquiry were not conducted as yet. Accordingly, there is no difference whether the plaintiff made a fraudulent claim or whether the defendant presents a dishonest case, — the Judge must withdraw. And although the defendant may benefit according to this view, nevertheless, we are not responsible (This perhaps explains the version found in some texts of Yad <i>ibid</i>.: <span>וידון אותו מלכו של עולם</span> ‘Let the King of the world judge him’ instead of <span>וידוננו מי שלבו שלם</span> ‘One whose heart [intelligence] is perfect should judge it.’ In other words, even if the defendant will benefit, the ‘King of the universe’ will eventually see that justice is carried out). c) <i>Asheri</i> reconciles the passages as follows: In Sheb. the plaintiff is the one who makes the false plea. Therefore, the Judge should withdraw; while in San. we deal with a case where the defendant is a fraudulent person. Hence, in order for the latter not to benefit, the Judge must not withdraw. , <i>infra</i> par. 4.</i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>Nevertheless, the law</i> [<i>of cross-examination in this case</i>] <i>is not</i> [<i>as strict</i>] <i>as</i> [<i>in</i>] <i>capital cases where if</i> [<i>a witness</i>] <i>stated during one of the inquiries, 'I know not,' that the testimony becomes void; but what is meant to be said is that he</i> [<i>the Judge</i>] <i>should inquire into a fraudulent lawsuit as much as it is possible</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>RIBaSh</i> s. 266 — <i>G.</i></i> If it appears to him [the Judge] according to his understanding that there is fraud therein, or where his common sense [directs him] not to rely upon the statements of the witnesses although he cannot [find grounds] to disqualify them, or where his [practical] judgment inclines [to assume] that this litigant is a deceiver and a cunning person and mislead the witnesses although they are eligible [witnesses] and gave evidence in ignorance of its legal bearing, and this party [the deceiving litigant] led them astray, or it appears to him [the Judge] from the general contents of the statements that there are other concealed matters therein and they are not willing to reveal them, — [then the law is that in] all these [aforementioned] matters and anything similar to these, he is forbidden to render a legal decision in that lawsuit, but he should withdraw from this case and one whose heart [intelligence] is perfect in [the examination of] such a case should judge it and these are matters entrusted to the heart [intelligence].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yad <i>ibid.</i> followed by <i>Tur</i> who also cite, <i>For the judgment is G-d’s</i> (Deut.

After <i>A</i> instituted an action against <i>B,</i> the latter stated that there were witnesses available at the time of the act who could corroborate his counter-claim, and we deal here with a case where the Court also knows that witnesses were available at the time of the act. Consequently, were it not for the Biblical text [v. anon] we might have said that under these circumstances the Court should give him ample time until he produces the witnesses. Therefore, we are informed that this is not so, but we give prior consideration to <i>A</i>’s claim)? — For it is said: <i>If any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them</i> (Ex. XXIV, 14), (i.e.,) let him cause his matters to come (first) before them.’ <i>Tosaf. ibid.</i> (according to a second interpretation) explain that we deal here with a case where <i>A</i> claims that <i>B</i> injured him, and <i>B</i> advances a counter-claim, in which case the law is that <i>A</i>’s claim is given prior consideration even if <i>B</i> states that he can produce witnesses in a day or two — because no extension of time is given in the case of injury (B.K. 91a). <i>Tosaf.</i> accept the second interpretation, viz., that we deal here with cases of injury. Consequently, the above verse refers <i>only</i> to cases of injury. Hence, according to the first interpretation of <i>Tosaf.</i> to which the above verse does not apply, <i>B</i> would be given time until he can produce his witnesses.

Judah stated: I heard that if they (the Judges) desire to permit them both to sit, they may do so.’ Although R. Judah represents an individual opinion and we would ordinarily rule in accordance with the Rabbis who represent the majority, nevertheless, since the second Baraitha (v. <i>supra</i> n. 2) and all the cases cited in Sheb. 30a,b harmonize with R. Judah’s view, the law rests with him. The litigants, however, are not permitted to sit down of their own accord, and if they did so, the Judge must ask them to rise, and subsequently, if they desire to permit them to sit, they may do so. According to this explanation it is understandable why King Jannai who was summoned to be present during the trial of his slave who killed a man (v. San. 19a) was told by Simeon b. Shetaḥ when the latter noticed that Jannai sat down after he arrived at Court, ‘Stand on your feet King Jannai and let the witnesses offer testimony against you’ (v. San. <i>ibid., Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>ינאי</span>; Sheb. 30a, <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>שאם</span> who point out a difficulty which is removed by this explanation) — <i>P.Tesh.</i></i> Nor should one [litigant] sit on a higher level and the other on a lower level, but one next to the other.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> XXI, 3.

Hence, this text contradicts our present ruling. Nevertheless, since we deal in our ruling with individuals who are considered equals, therefore our text does apply (v. <i>‘Eẓ Yosef</i> in cur. edd. of Tanḥ.). Should, however, one litigant <i>stand</i> on a higher level and the other on a lower one, it does not matter — <i>M.E.</i> The underlying reason for regarding the litigants as equals is in order to avoid disheartening on the part of a litigant who is not treated as an equal and thereby forgets his pleas.</i> When does this apply?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That if the Court desires to permit them both to sit, they may do so.</i> — At the time of the discussion <i>of the pleas,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sheb. 30b: ‘R.

Consequently, as in the case of witnesses the law that testimony must be offered while standing is applicable in the first instance, but if the evidence was given while sitting it is considered valid <i>ex post facto,</i> so too, in the case of the litigants it is valid <i>ex post facto</i> if presented in a sitting position.</i> What is considered the conclusion of the case? — [When the verdict is pronounced,] '[So-and-so, You are not guilty,' or 'So-and-so, you are guilty.'<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishna San. 29a. , <i>infra</i> § 19, 1 and cf. <i>supra</i> § 12, 2.</i> [With respect to] the witnesses [the law is that] in the first instance they must always [testify] while standing.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sheb. 30b in accord with ‘Ulla. , <i>supra</i> n. 10; Git. 71a (ref to Mishna <i>ibid.</i> 67b: ‘If one is struck dumb and they said to him, Shall we write a <i>Get</i> for your wife? and he nodded his head, they must test him three times. If for <i>no</i> he said <i>no,</i> and for <i>yes</i> he said <i>yes,</i> they write and deliver it’): ‘In the same manner as he (one who is struck dumb) is examined with reference to a <i>Get,</i> so too, is he tested regarding transactions, testimony and bequests’ (cited from Tosef(Z). VII(V), 1). <i>Testimony</i> is explained by R. Joḥanan in Y. Git. VII, 1(48d) to refer to ‘one who offers testimony while sitting.’ This according to <i>W.G.</i> refers to one who is sick, since one who is struck dumb must have become so as a result of sickness and yet, we see that his testimony is considered valid through the test of nodding the head. Hence, it follows that if one testified while sitting, his testimony is considered valid <i>ex post facto</i> (cf. Tosef. <i>ibid.</i> where <span>חולה ומשותק</span> is mentioned). , also Zeb. 16a and Tosaf. s.v. <span>מיושב</span>.</i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>And standing by being supported is indeed regarded as standing with respect to this matter</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>RIBaSh</i> s. 266 — <i>G.</i> Meg. 21a (ref. to Mishna: ‘One who reads the <i>Megillah</i> may do so while standing or sitting’): ‘A Tanna stated: This (namely, that one may read the <i>Megillah</i> while standing or sitting) does not apply to the Torah (the reading of the Torah in public). Whence is this derived? — R. Abbahu said: Because the Scriptural verse states, <i>But as for thee, stand thou here by me</i> (Deut. V, 28) … One verse states, <i>And I sat</i> (<span>ואשב</span>) <i>in the mount</i> (Deut. IX, 9) and another verse states, <i>And I stood</i> (<span>עמדתי</span>) <i>in the mount</i> (<i>ibid.</i> X, 10) — Rab said: He (Moses) stood when he learnt and sat when he reviewed (his learning). R. Ḥanina said: He was neither standing nor sitting but stooping.’ Hence, we see that stooping is designated neither standing nor sitting and yet the verse (<i>I stood</i>) refers to it as standing. Consequently, standing while leaning against something (equivalent to stooping) is still called standing. <i>Leaning</i> would therefore, include both standing and sitting. It is designated <i>standing</i> where this would be the requirement of the law as in the present ruling, and <i>sitting</i> where the law requires it as <i>infra</i> § 28, 26 where standing (in the case of Judges) by being supported is not considered standing but rather sitting in accord with the First Tanna in Zeb. 19b.

Hence, if Judges who are required to sit, stood by means of some support, or if witnesses who are required to stand, did so only by means of support, we adopt a leniency in both cases and consider standing by means of support in the case of Judges as sitting and in the case of witnesses as standing.

But, if after listening to one litigant, he gave the latter a written ruling in accordance with the majority of the <i>Codifiers and Responsa,</i> then he is forbidden to try the case because he is considered an interested party, since he will not contradict his own ruling — <i>ShaK, Tummim.</i> , Zohar <i>wa-Yesheb</i> 179b: ‘Who is regarded as a cunning knave (<span>רשע ערום</span>)? — One who pleaded his cause before the Judge before his fellow-litigant arrived (cf.

Caro</i> follows <i>Maim.,</i> viz., that after the number of Judges is increased, the one who states, ‘I know not how to decide’ does not invalidate their decision as long as there is a majority of Judges who issue the verdict. Y. San. V, 5 (23a): ‘It was taught: Why are the Judges increased (in civil suits)? — So that if two of the first (Judges) were for acquittal (and one said ‘I know not how to decide’ and they increased the number of the Judges by two) and one of the latter (Judges who were added was also for acquittal and one stated ‘I know not how to decide’), — (the law is that) the proceedings are completed (i.e., sentence is pronounced) by three (since we now have a majority and we do not say that since one stated ‘I do not know’ he is considered as nonexistent and consequently we should again increase the number by two. The point is this: At the outset there were only two Judges who concurred and since the verdict is not valid if given by two Judges, the number had to be increased; but now that there are three who agree, sentence is pronounced and it matters not whether one of the added Judges was for condemnation or was undecided). Said R. La (Heb. <span>לא</span> abbrev. of <span>אילא</span>), Since (two Judges have been added) it seems that the final verdict should be pronounced by four (Judges, because the one who was undecided is regarded as non-existent and now that one of the added Judges is also undecided, he too is regarded as non-existent. Consequently we have only three Judges who declare their opinions and therefore the law is that) we do not conclude the proceedings by three (but we should increase the number again by two more Judges). R. Jose said, You may deduce from this (i.e., from the first opinion recorded here, that we issue the verdict by three), (the law stated in Y. Shebi. X, 4(39c)) — (that) if three (Judges) confirmed (a document) and one of them dies (before they sign it), the two (Judges) sign it and they must write: Although two of us signed it, we judged (confirmed) it by three (For as in our case we do not require that four Judges offer their opinion, so too, in the case of the document we do not have to add another Judge but it suffices that two Judges sign it. Hence, this is in agreement with the First Tanna and not with R. La). Said R. Ḥaggai, the Mishna (too) states this (v. Shebi. X, 4: ‘This is the formula of a <i>Prozbul</i>: I declare before you.....................the Judges, in the place....................., that I shall collect any debt that I may have outstanding with...................., whenever I desire.’ According to Deut. XV, 2 the Sabbatical year cancels a loan and in order to protect the creditor, a declaration was made in Court to the effect, that the law of limitation by the entrance of the Sabbatical year shall not apply to the loan transacted): The Judges sign below or the witnesses (Thus we see that though the declaration was made before a Court of three, nevertheless, it is valid even if two signed the document of <i>Prozbul.</i> Likewise, in the present case where three Judges pronounced the verdict. Hence, we see that this accords with the first opinion <i>contra</i> R. La). But do we apply the rules of <i>Prozbul</i> to ordinary claims? — (Yes), he (R.

But even according to the opinion (that the verdict should be phrased): He is not guilty, he (the dissenting Judge) might argue, Had you not accepted my viewpoint, you too would not have to share in making compensation! — But they differ regarding their liability to pay his share (in addition to their own). On the view (that the verdict is worded thus): He is not guilty, they pay (the entire) liability (since their view was finally adopted); but according to the view: So-and-so (of the Judges) are for acquittal and So-and-so are for conviction, they do not pay (the share of the dissenting Judge).

Joḥanan stated, (With respect to) an unavoidable interference it is as though he did not act (and consequently in the case of betrothal a plea of unavoidable interference is invalid <i>contra</i> divorce where such a plea would be accepted, the reason being that in the case of divorce the matter depends wholly on the husband’s consent; whereas in betrothal her consent is also required. Thus <i>Korban ‘Edah</i>). R. Simeon b.

Derived from Mishna San. 24a: ‘If one (of the litigants) said to the other, I accept my father as trustworthy,’ or ‘I accept your father as trustworthy,’ or ‘I accept three oxherds as trustworthy.’ R. Meir says, He may (subsequently) retract; but the Sages maintain, He cannot retract.’ By stating ‘father’ we derive that accepting a relative is valid.</i> or an [otherwise] ineligible person<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishna <i>ibid.</i>: ‘I accept three oxherds as trustworthy,’ whence we derive the law of accepting an ineligible person. For an oxherd is ineligible to judge or to testify — v. San. 25b: ‘Raba stated: The oxherds to whom (the Sages) have made reference include the oxherds of both large and small cattle.’ Therefore, we are informed that if they were accepted by the litigants, it is valid. , also <i>ibid.</i> 24b: ‘Raba stated: If one accepted a relative or an (otherwise) ineligible person (to act as Judge or witness), he may retract before the conclusion of the trial, but not afterwards.’ Gemara concludes that Raba’s statement agrees with R.

Does this not (mean that ordinarily they are ineligible) for witnesses? — No, for Judges. This is also apparent from the expression <i>three oxherds;</i> for if it means eligible as witnesses, why three?’ Hence, if they were accepted, it is valid and according to the Sages, he may not retract.</i> or a witness<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">San. 23b whence it is derived that acceptance of an otherwise ineligible person to act as witness is on the same par as accepting him to judge. The entire Mishna in San. 24a deals with a case where the acceptance took place before a Court of three eligible Judges (v. Y. San. III, 5(21a)). For if outside of the Court and there was no formal agreement made by <i>Kinyan,</i> the law is that even after the conclusion of the trial, he may retract according to all the authorities — <i>Hag. Asheri</i> on the authority of <i>O</i>.Z. <i>N.Yos.</i> and <i>R. Yeruḥam</i> (to B.B. VIII) on the other hand, maintain that the relatives or otherwise ineligible persons were not accepted before a Court; but if their acceptance was before a Court, then even before the conclusion of the trial, he may not retract — <i>ShaK. Tummim</i> writes that actually there is no difference whether they were accepted before a Court of Law or not. For once the pleas are presented before them they enjoy the status of a Court and it is regarded as if the acceptance took place before a Court of Law. The acceptance of a relative is valid only where the litigant knew that this was his relative, but if he pleads that he was unaware that he was his relative, the law is that he must take an equitable oath (v. <i>supra</i> § 1, n. 2) and may retract (<i>BaḤ</i>). However, if the litigant used to visit him and now he states that he was unaware that he is his relative, he is not regarded trustworthy (v. <i>infra</i> § 36, 2). Where the litigant claims that he was unaware that the accepted person was ineligible, the following distinction should be borne in mind: If the person is Rabbinically ineligible, in which case a public announcement is usually made in Court proclaiming him as such — then the litigant is not believed (v. <i>ShaK infra</i> § 71, n. 31) because all judicial matters are publicized; whereas in the case of an ineligible person who does not require a public announcement proclaiming him as such — the litigant is regarded trustworthy — <i>P.Tesh.</i> If the relative reveals that he is obliged to help and support the litigant, the latter’s acceptance of him is invalid (<i>Keneseth ha-Gedolah</i>). <i>Shebuth Ya‘akob</i> reports a case concerning a woman who left instructions prior to her death that if any dissension will arise between her sons, a certain relative of hers should adjudicate their case, and the sons obligated themselves by means of ‘striking hands’ (<span>תקיעת כף</span>) to follow the decision of that relative, and now one of the sons refuses to be tried before him, claiming a) that the latter is an illiterate person who is incompetent to adjudicate such matters, or at least others should be co-opted forming a <i>Beth Din;</i> b) that this person is more favourably disposed to one of the other brothers. <i>Resp.</i>: The law is that regarding the Talmudic principle ‘It is a religious duty to carry out the instructions of a dying person’ (Ket. 68b-70a; Git. 14b, 15a, 40a), it would not be applicable in this case (v. <i>infra</i> § 252, 2; Y.D. § 232, 17, <i>Gloss</i>); but as far as the obligation effected through ‘striking hands,’ the instructions must be carried out, and as to a) he knew about this at the outset and yet accepted him; b) every vow, the release of which, brings in its wake the ‘least suspicion of sin’ (<span>נדנוד עבירה</span>), should not be annulled (v. Y.D. § 230, <i>Gloss</i>). Hence, in the present case there is still a ‘suspicion of sin’ against his mother because he should carry out the instructions of his mother, albeit in the category of ‘fulfilling his duty beyond the requirements of the law,’ although strictly speaking this is not applicable in the present case — <i>P.Tesh.</i></i> — <i>Gloss</i>: <i>the acceptance is regarded</i> [<i>valid</i>] <i>only when</i> [<i>the litigant</i>] <i>accepted him to act as Judge; but if he deposited money with him regarding which they were in dispute, it is not designated</i> [<i>valid</i>] <i>acceptance</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>RIBaSh</i> s. 311 — <i>G.</i> This refers to a case where one took an oath to pay his fellow on a certain date, and when the time for payment arrived, he deposited the money with the town Judge in order to fulfil his obligation effected through the oath, and instructed the Judge not to deliver the money to the other party because he had a claim against him and the Judge was related to him. Consequently, since the litigant did not accept the Judge explicitly, the acceptance is not valid and the judgment has no legal consequences — <i>M.E.</i></i> — even if he accepted one of those ineligible on account of sin as [equivalent to] two eligible witnesses to testify on his behalf or [he accepted him] as three of a Court of Law [of] authoritative [Judges] to adjudicate [the case] for him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> VII, 2. Derived from San. 24a (ref. to Mishna <i>ibid</i>.): ‘R. Dimi b. R. Naḥman b. R. Joseph stated: (The Mishna has reference to a case) e.g., where he (the litigant) accepted him (i.e., one of those mentioned) as one (of the three Judges).’ According to <i>Rashi</i> this refers to R. Meir’s viewpoint and it means that even if there are two other eligible Judges, R. Meir maintains that he may retract, whence it follows that according to the Sages, both if he accepted him as one of the Judges or as three, he cannot retract. ‘An ineligible person’ is mentioned here in order to introduce a remarkable feature, viz., that even one who is disqualified to offer testimony in any other case. Much more so in the case of a ‘father,’ who is eligible to offer testimony in other cases, is the acceptance considered valid where the latter was accepted as two witnesses or three Judges — <i>M.E.</i></i> <i>Gloss</i>:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This <i>Gloss</i> should come after ‘he can … legal proceedings are closed’ anon — <i>M.E.</i></i> <i>Some differ</i> [<i>with this ruling</i>] <i>and are of the opinion that</i> [<i>this is applicable</i>] <i>only if he accepted a relative or an</i> [<i>otherwise</i>] <i>ineligible person as one Judge or as one witness; but if he accepted him as two</i> [<i>witnesses or as three authoritative Judges</i>] <i>in which case there are two irregularities —</i> [<i>the law is that</i>] <i>even after the legal proceedings are closed, he may retract</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus <i>Alfasi</i> to San. III <i>contra Gaon</i> who maintains that even if a formal <i>Kinyan</i> was made before a <i>Beth Din,</i> he may retract, since it was a <i>Kinyan</i> made in error. Cf. Sheb. 42a: ‘A certain (man) said to his fellow: You are believed by me like two whenever you claim that I have not paid you. He went and paid him before three. Said R. Papa: He believed him like two but like three he did not believe him. To this R. Huna b. R. Joshua objected: Two are like a hundred and a hundred are like two! But if he said to him: Like three, and he went and paid him before four (witnesses, the lender is not believed), for since he cares to mention a certain number of opinions (that he believes him like three people) he means (exclusively) that number of opinions (for otherwise he would have mentioned only <i>two</i> who are equivalent to any number).’ There must have been a formal <i>Kinyan</i> made, for if the statement of credence was made at the time the loan was transacted it is equivalent to <i>Kinyan;</i> otherwise formal <i>Kinyan</i> is required. We thus see that as far as two are concerned the lender is believed according to all opinions, although there were two irregularities (<span>תרתי לריעותא</span>), a) he believed the lender himself; b) he considered him as two witnesses. Likewise in the present ruling there are two irregularities, a) one Judge was accepted like three; b) even he was Biblically ineligible. Hence even in the case of two irregularities, once a <i>Kinyan</i> was made he may not retract on the principle ‘nothing else is required after Kinyan is effected’ (<span>אין לאחר קנין כלום</span>). Should he, however, appoint another Court to deal with the case, the latter must adjudicate the case in accordance with the pleas and admissions presented before the first Court (provided there was a formal <i>Kinyan</i> made. Thus <i>Nethiboth</i>) — <i>M.E.</i> on the authority of <i>RaShBA Resp.</i> If he accepted one eligible Judge like three experts (<i>Mumḥin</i>) or one eligible witness like two and the trial was concluded he may not retract (since there is only one irregularity) — <i>M.E.</i> and later authorities <i>contra ShaK.</i> , <i>P.Tesh.</i> Likewise, if he accepted three ineligible persons (simultaneously. , <i>P.Tesh</i>) like three eligible ones, he may not retract, since there is only one irregularity — <i>Tummim.</i> , however, <i>K.H.</i></i> <i>Thus is the common consent of the majority of the Codifiers</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In accord with San. 23b, <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>ואמר</span> who point out that R.

R.

The point is this: In the former case money will be transferred from one party to another, and consequently more power must be exercised; in the latter case, less authority is required, since the possessor has a presumption of ownership) and with whom does the law accord? — He replied: The controversy is with reference to <i>I will pay you</i> and the law accords with the Sages.’</i> — [the law is that] if they made a formal agreement with him by means of a <i>Kinyan</i> relative to this [matter], he cannot retract; but if they did not make a formal agreement with him by means of a <i>Kinyan,</i> he can retract before the legal proceedings are closed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">San. 24b: ‘A message was dispatched from the School of Rab to Samuel as follows: Will our Master kindly teach us, (If one of the parties) made a formal agreement by <i>Kinyan</i> (not to retract), what (if he desires to retract) before the verdict is given? — He sent back word: After a formal agreement is made by means of <i>Kinyan,</i> nothing (can be done to retract from the pledge).’ Although this (i.e., not to retract) appears to be ‘a mere verbal agreement’ (<span>קנין דברים</span>), i.e., that of which ownership is acquired by means of the <i>Kinyan</i> is only a verbal promise, and does not involve any concrete article, — yet, we do find that the <i>Kinyan</i> binds him in his undertaking (v. B.M. 67b; B.B. 3a; <i>supra</i> § 12, n. 31). Thus <i>N.Yos.

Mishneh</i> explains that it does not necessarily mean that money had been exacted, but that since the legal proceedings are closed it is as though money had been exacted. The litigants are not permitted to retract even if they both agree, the reason being that out of deference to the Judge, the verdict must stand unless the litigants wish to make a complete remission to each other — <i>B.Yos.</i></i> provided it did not become known that [the Judges] erred [in their decision].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">San. 6a: ‘R. Abbahu stated: All concur that a decision given by two (Judges) in civil cases is not valid. R. Abba raised an objection (from the following): If one adjudicated a case by himself and pronounced the guilty, not guilty, and the not guilty, guilty, or the unclean, clean, his act cannot be upset, but he (the Judge) has to pay from his own pocket (This clearly shows that the decision of one Judge also stands)? — We deal here with a case where the litigants accepted the Judge. If so, why should the Judge) pay indemnity? — Because they (the litigants) said to him: Adjudicate the case for us in accordance with the law of the Torah.’ The Talmud (<i>ibid.</i>) concludes that if the Judge erred in his decision by overlooking a law stated in the Mishna, he may revoke his decision; but if he made a mistake in deciding against common pratice, his act cannot be undone and he must pay from his own pocket. It is thus evident that whenever the litigants accept the Judge, even if he is ineligible, then even if a <i>Kinyan</i> was effected, it is only on condition that no error should be made. Otherwise they may retract. Cf. Git. 14a: ‘R. Naḥman said, If a formal agreement by means of <i>Kinyan</i> was effected in error, the money must be returned.’ In a case where the Judges erred in their decision and the litigant is then permitted to retract, he is allowed to present his case anew and even alter his original pleas. Furthermore, the second Court of Law gives the litigant a new extension of time to produce his proofs or other required evidence. If the litigants accepted the Judges to adjudicate their case in accordance with strict law, and they (the Judges) made a settlement through arbitration, this too, is considered an error in judgment and even if the litigants bound themselves by a <i>Kinyan,</i> they may retract — <i>M.E., ShaK.</i></i> <i>However, if they are</i> [<i>the</i>] <i>duly appointed</i> [<i>Judges</i>] <i>in the city or the representatives of the town, he cannot retract</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For in such a case it was known that the Judges are incompetent, and consequently, when they were accepted by the litigants, it meant that their decision would be followed even if it were erroneous since they are the representatives of the town. , <i>infra</i> § 25.

What does he inform us? We have already learnt (this elsewhere. Cf.

So too, one who was not obliged to take an oath and stated, 'I will take an oath,' — [then] if they made a formal agreement with him by means of a <i>Kinyan,</i> he cannot retract; and if they did not make a formal agreement with him by means of a <i>Kinyan,</i> although he accepted in [the presence of] the Court [to take the oath], he may retract until the legal proceedings are closed and [only thereafter] he must take the oath. <i>Gloss</i>: <i>One who is under obligation to take an oath and stated before the Court of Law, 'I desire not to take an oath, I am prepared to make payment,' and</i> [<i>then</i>] <i>left the Court of Law, —</i> [<i>the law is that</i>] <i>he cannot retract for this is regarded the close of his legal proceedings</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sheb. 39a: ‘If he stated, I shall not take an oath (realizing the seriousness of swearing falsely), he is dismissed (from Court) forthwith (so as not to give him a chance to change his mind, and he pays the claim. Thus <i>Rashi</i>). According to <i>Tosaf.</i> (v. sources <i>supra</i> n. 26) the question whether we consider the legal proceedings closed after the litigant makes his statement before the Court and then leaves or whether the oath must be taken before the litigant leaves the Court, is applicable both in the case where one was under obligation to take an oath and stated ‘I desire not to take an oath etc.,’ or where the defendant transfers the oath to the claimant, or where one states ‘Vow by the life of your head.’ According to those authorities who maintain that if he said ‘I desire not to take an oath etc.,’ and then left Court, he may not retract, the same principle applies equally in the other cases. Those who differ with this opinion and hold that in the case of one under obligation to take an oath, the legal proceedings are considered closed only after the oath is taken, the same principle is also applicable in the other cases. Consequently, <i>Isserles Gloss</i> presents a difficulty. For according to the present <i>Gloss,</i> the difference of opinion between the above-mentioned authorities is only with respect to one who states ‘I will not swear,’ but not regarding the other cases (v. <i>M.E., ShaK</i> and <i>W.G</i>.). This difficulty may be removed if we bear in mind that the law of one who was under obligation to take an oath and stated ‘I desire not … he cannot retract etc.,’ was stated only in accordance with <i>Rashi</i>’s interpretation followed by <i>Asheri</i> (v. <i>supra</i> n. 29). One who was under obligation to take an equitable oath in Court and did not state that he wishes to transfer the oath to his adversary and then left Court and subsequently stated that he desires to transfer the oath, is permitted to do so — <i>Tur.</i> Even if he stated ‘I will not swear’ and then left Court, he may subsequently transfer the oath, because we assume that what he meant is this: ‘<i>I</i> will not swear but I will transfer the oath,’ provided he did not say, ‘I will not swear but I will make payment’ — <i>M.E.</i> If the defendant was under obligation to take an equitable oath and he stated in Court ‘I will swear’ and before taking the oath, he left, the law is that he subsequently cannot transfer the oath — <i>M.E. ShaK</i> rejects the latter ruling of <i>M.E.</i> For only where he stated ‘I will not swear but I will make payment’ he may not retract if he left the Court, because as soon as he says ‘I will not swear etc.,’ it is regarded as an admission of guilt; but where he stated ‘I will swear’ it is as though he said ‘I am prepared to carry out the verdict,’ but it does not mean that he actually accepted to take the oath. Hence, he may subsequently transfer the oath. And this is the adopted custom in many Holy communities (v. <i>P.Tesh</i> conflicting views regarding this custom). This holds good only with respect to an equitable oath, but in the case of a Biblical oath where legally one may not transfer it (v. <i>infra</i> § 87; Sheb. 41a), if one said to his fellow ‘Swear and collect’ and the latter stated ‘I will swear’ and then left the Court or even where he did not leave the Court but the Judges had already commenced the discussion of another case, he may not retract — <i>Nethiboth.</i></i> <i>Some</i> [<i>authorities</i>], <i>however, differ</i> [<i>with this view</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">, <i>Tur</i> — <i>G.</i> Cf. previous note.</i> <i>One who was under obligation to his fellow to take a Biblical oath and he said to the latter, 'Take an oath and collect,' and</i> [<i>then the latter hurriedly</i>] <i>took an oath without holding a</i> [<i>sacred</i>] <i>object,</i> — [<i>the law is that</i>] <i>he</i> [<i>the defendant</i>] <i>cannot retract</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And say ‘I will swear and be exempt,’ but the plaintiff must take another oath while holding a sacred object.

In this case we cannot be certain that a re-trial will result in the same decision).’ , Ket. 85b. An arbitrator is likewise not believed when he states that the settlement was according to such and such terms if the litigants are no longer before him (<i>RaShBA</i>) — <i>M.E.</i> , <i>Isserles</i> anon. This is based on the following case cited by <i>B.Yos. supra</i> § 12: <i>A</i> gave <i>B</i> a gift of bonds and took an oath that he will not collect any of the debts covered by the bonds. Subsequently <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> were in dispute concerning other claims and they accepted an arbitrator on condition that whatever settlement he reaches within a certain time limit should be effective and the latter arbitrated the case and ruled that <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> should remit their claims by means of a written document excluding the case of the bonds that <i>A</i> had made a gift to <i>B</i> which are to remain in effect as of the day of arbitration and later it was discovered that <i>A</i> had collected money on the strength of the bonds given to <i>B</i> and the latter contends that the money collected by <i>A</i> should be returned, to which <i>A</i> responds that since he collected the money prior to the date on which the document of remittal became effective, notwithstanding the fact that he presented the bonds to <i>B</i> on condition that they remain in their original force, he should be exempt from returning the collected money especially since it states in the document of remittal drawn up by the arbitrator that the settlement excludes the bonds as of the date of arbitration. The arbitrator was consulted and he agreed with A. <i>Responsum</i>: The law accords with <i>B</i>’s claim because when the other claims between <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> were submitted to the arbitrator, it was unknown that <i>A</i> had collected money on the strength of the bonds, for it was presumed that the bonds were intact since <i>A</i> took an oath to this effect. Consequently this did not enter into the remittal. And as to the statement of the arbitrator, he is not believed because he did not make this declaration when the litigants were still before him as in the present ruling with regards to a Judge. <i>Nethiboth</i> writes that the Judge is believed as long as the litigants still stand before him even if the one who was pronounced guilty could employ the principle of <i>Miggo</i> (i.e., since the the litigant could have stated ‘I did not accept you as Judge’), because since the Judge is believed as two witnesses, it would be tantamount to a <i>Miggo</i> in face of witnesses which is not effective. If the litigant contends that the Judge had pronounced judgment in his favour but the Judge and the other litigant state that the verdict had not yet been given, the Judge is believed even where the litigants are no longer before him provided that there are witnesses who testify that the litigants accepted him as Judge; but if there are no witnesses available and the litigants are no longer before the Judge, the claim of the litigant is accepted on the principle of <i>Miggo,</i> viz., that they did not accept him as Judge. And in this case the principle of <i>Miggo</i> in the face of witnesses (i.e., if we accept the statement of the Judge as equivalent to the testimony of two witnesses) is not accepted since the litigants are no longer before the Judge, in which case the latter is not regarded as equivalent to two witnesses — <i>Nethiboth.</i> However, the Judge is believed as one witness, provided he is not a relative or an otherwise ineligible person, and hence places the litigant who contradicts him under an oath and exempts the one who supports his statement from taking an oath. If the Judge died or left and the litigants contradict each other, each one stating that judgment was pronounced in his favour, — the law is that if one is the possessor (<span>מוחזק</span>) of the disputed article, the onus rests on the other party to produce evidence in order to substantiate his claim; if both are possessors, they divide the disputed article; if both are not possessors, the stronger of the two obtains possession or they make a settlement — <i>M.E.</i></i> And [this refers to a case] where the written verdict is not in his [the litigant's] possession,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kid. <i>ibid.</i> , previous note beg. This means that if the litigant has the judgment writ, the Judge is believed even if they are no longer standing before him. Accordingly, the question in the Gemara <i>ibid.,</i> ‘Let us see who holds (the document containing) the verdict in favour’ refers to the latter part of the cited Baraitha (i.e., ‘but if they no longer stand before him, he is not believed’). <i>RITBA,</i> however, refers this question to the first part of the Baraitha (i.e., ‘the Judge is believed only if the litigants are still standing before him’). In other words, why rely on the Judge if we can see the judgment writ. For if it refers to the latter part of the Baraitha, the following difficulty arises: If we do not believe the Judge, why accept the judgment writ? — <i>ShaK.</i> Where the judgment writ held by <i>A</i> contains an undefined statement, e.g., ‘The land of So-and-so belongs to you,’ and <i>B</i> claims that the judgment writ was in his possession but he lost it, then the Judge is believed when he says, ‘I ruled in favour of this party’ — <i>ShaK.</i></i> and [this ruling is applicable] only to a case of discretionary judgment;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kid. <i>ibid.</i> , <i>supra</i> n.

However, the decision of one or two laymen is not considered valid even if authorization was obtained from the <i>Resh Galutha</i> (Exilarch) and even if the decision was not given in error — <i>M.E.</i> Thus <i>Alfasi,</i> viz., that the litigant may retract even if they (one or two laymen) did not err. But if it is impossible to retract, e.g., where one left for abroad or the like (v. <i>Caro</i> anon), the Judge must make restitution from his own pocket even if he did not take aught from one litigant and give to the other litigant with his own hand. For even where the Judge took and gave with his own hand, and in reality this should be returned by the litigant who received it in error, the Judge must pay the litigant who suffered a loss, and then collect from the other litigant who received payment on account of the erroneous decision of the Judge. <i>RaZaH</i> contra <i>Alfasi</i> rules that since the decision is invalid, then even if the layman Judge took and gave with his own hand, he is exempt from making payment, for the litigant is responsible since he knew well that the decision of such a Judge is invalid. If the Judge compelled the litigant to give aught to the other litigant, he is considered a robber and must make restitution. <i>ShaK</i> rules in accord with <i>Alfasi</i> where the Judge took and gave with his own hand.</i> who adjudicated monetary cases and gave an erroneous decision — [the law is that] if he erred in evident and known matters, e.g., laws that are explicitly stated in the <i>Mishna</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yad, <i>Sanhedrin</i> VI,  Derived from Mishna San. 32a: ‘In monetary cases the verdict may be reversed (on discovering that the verdict was erroneous) either (from conviction) to acquittal or (from acquittal) to conviction.’ Gemara <i>ibid.</i> 33a: ‘But the following disagrees with it: If one adjudicated a case (by himself) and pronounced him who was guilty, not guilty, or the one who was not guilty, guilty; the clean, unclean, or <i>vice versa</i>: his verdict stands, but he must pay compensation (for any damage resulting from his erroneous decision) out of his own pocket (Mishna Bek. 28b. Thus we see that the verdict may not be reversed)? — R. Joseph stated: There is no contradiction: here it (our Mishna) has reference to a <i>Mumḥeh</i> (He had authority to upset his former decision); there (Mishna Bek.) to one who is not a <i>Mumḥeh</i> (His decision stands but he must pay indemnity). But do we reverse the verdict in the case of a <i>Mumḥeh?</i> Have we not learned: If he was recognized by the <i>Beth Din</i> as a <i>Mumḥeh</i> he is exempt from making payment! — R. Naḥman replied: Here (in our Mishna) we deal with a case where there is a Court superior to this one in learning and numbers (therefore, the superior Court can reverse the verdict of the lower Court); but in the other Mishna there is no other Court superior to this one in learning and numbers (i.e., in both Mishnahs the verdict was issued by a <i>Mumḥeh,</i> but where there is no superior Court available, one of the litigants may oppose reversing the verdict). R. Shesheth answered: Here we deal with a case where he (the Judge) overlooked a law cited in a Mishna (Hence, the verdict may be reversed); there he erred in weighing of opinions. For R. Shesheth stated on the authority of R. Assi: If he overlooked a law cited in the Mishna, the verdict is reversed; if he erred in weighing of opinions, the verdict is not reversed. Rabina asked R. Ashi: Is this also applicable if he erred in connection with a teaching of R. Ḥiyya or R. Oshaia (who were held to be the editors of the Tosefta which is not as authoritative as the Mishna)? — Yes, he answered.

Hamnunah raised an objection against R. Shesheth (v. <i>supra</i> n. 2): It once happened that a cow’s womb was removed and R. Tarfon gave it to the dogs to eat (i.e., he declared the cow <i>Terefah</i>). When the case was presented before the Sages in Yabneh, they declared her permissible (for human consumption), for Theodos (or Theodoros), the Physician said that no cow or sow leaves Alexandria of Egypt unless the womb is first cut out, in order that she may not breed (This precaution was taken so as to limit its breeding only to Egypt and thus compel buyers to come to Alexandria). Said R. Tarfon: Your ass is gone, Tarfon! (i.e., I will now have to sell my ass in order to compensate the owner of the cow for having erroneously declared it <i>Terefah</i>). But R. Akiba said to him: You are exempt from reparation, since he who is publicly recognized as a <i>Mumḥeh</i> is exempt from making compensation (Mishna Bek. 28b; San. 93a). Now, if your opinion (R. Shesheth that one who overlooks a law cited in the Mishna may reconsider his verdict) has substance, he (R. Akiba) should have said to him: You overlooked a law cited in the Mishna (cf. Mishna Hul. 54a: If the womb is gone the animal is not rendered <i>Terefah</i>) and he who overlooks a law cited in the Mishna may reconsider his verdict (Hence, even if R. Tarfon were not an expert, he should be exempt. Consequently, if the cow were still here, R. Tarfon could rescind the verdict and therefore the person who gave it to the dogs should be held responsible)! — He (R. Akiba) gave him two reasons: Firstly, you have overlooked a law cited in the Mishna, and he who overlooks a law cited in the Mishna may rescind his verdict. Secondly, Even if your error was made against common practice (Lit. ‘weighing of opinions’), you are a publicly recognnized <i>Mumḥeh,</i> and as such you are exempt from making reparation. Said R. Naḥman b. Isaac to Raba: What is the objection that R. Hamnunah raised against R. Shesheth from the case of the cow? But the cow had already been given to the dogs to eat and was no longer in existence for it to be returned to its owner (i.e., a reconsideration of the verdict would be of no avail)! — This is what he meant: Were you to say that one who overlooks a law cited in the Mishna may <i>not</i> reconsider the verdict, it is right, for then the verdict stands and R. Tarfon was fearful and (R. Akiba) said to him: You are recognized by the <i>Beth Din</i> as a <i>Mumḥeh</i> and exempt from reparation. But if you say that he who overlooks a law cited in the Mishna <i>may</i> reconsider his verdict, then (R. Akiba) should have said to him: Since if the cow were still available your verdict would have been invalid and you would have done nothing, so too, now (that the cow is no longer in existence) you have done nothing (i.e., you did not give it to the dogs yourself and it was the owner’s bad luck to have carried out your verdict [v. B.K. 100a]. Consequently, since R. Akiba did not present this argument, we conclude therefrom that if one overlooks a law cited in the Mishna, he must not reconsider the verdict).’ The present ruling accords with the interpretation of R.

However, if the Judge took and gave with his hand even without having to resort to force, he is held responsible even if he overlooked a law cited in the Mishnah — <i>ShaK. M.E.</i> and <i>BaḤ</i> differ with <i>ShaK</i> and maintain that since the Judge did not have the express intention to cause damage, then even if he took and gave with his hand, the law is that if he over-looked a law cited in the Mishnah, he is not held responsible.</i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>And some differ</i> [<i>with this opinion</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tur</i> on the authority of <i>Asheri</i> and other <i>Codifiers</i> — <i>G.</i> e., the Judge is held responsible in a case where the article cannot be returned and the Judge erred by overlooking a law cited in the Mishna and we follow R.

However, if he did not take and give with his own hand and erred in a law cited in the Mishna and is a <i>Mumḥeh,</i> — then even from the point of acting beyond the requirement of the law he is exempt as in the case of R. Akiba who exempted R. Tarfon and did not consider him liable beyond the requirements of the law. If one asks the advice of a Sage whether he should purchase certain meat or fruit, and the latter informed him that the fruit is ‘clean’ or the meat ‘Kosher’ and on the strength of this advice he purchased same and subsequently, it was found that the Sage had erred — <i>ShaK</i> holds that if he overlooked a law cited in the Mishna, the purchase is invalid and he may retract; but if he erred ‘in the weighing of opinions’ the purchaser may not retract save that the Sage or Judge is liable to make compensation if he is not a recognized authority but was only accepted by the litigants. <i>Tummim</i> disputes this ruling and maintains that the purchase is void and the vendor must return the money and take back his fruit or meat.</i> <i>And with regards to decisions in ritual law</i>, — <i>if he</i> [<i>the Judge</i>] <i>has attained</i> [<i>the age of</i>] <i>ordination, although he is not</i> [<i>officially</i>] <i>ordained, his legal status is as that of an authoritative</i> [<i>Judge</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>N.Yos.</i> to San.

This applies only to a case of a single witness, but not if there were two.’ Hence, much more so in our present case where the Jewish Court of Law bears testimony on behalf of a fellow Israelite, it would be permissible. <i>A.H.</i> writes that this is applicable whether the claimant is Jewish or not.</i> <i>This entire</i> [<i>ruling is applicable</i>] <i>only when</i> [<i>the recalcitrant person</i>] <i>refuses to heed the</i> [<i>Jewish Court of</i>] <i>Law, but otherwise the</i> [<i>Jewish</i>] <i>Court of Law is forbidden to give</i> [<i>one</i>] <i>permission to appear for trial before a heathen</i> [<i>Court</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> <i>supra</i> par. 1.</i>",

Jose the Galilean reported: With regards to every negative precept laid down in the Torah, if one performs an act (in violating it) he is punished with lashes, but if he does not perform an act (in violating it) he is exempt, save in the case of one who takes an oath, exchanges (an unconsecrated animal for one that is consecrated), and curses his fellow with the Name, in which cases, although he performed no act, he is punished (with lashes) … And he who curses his neighbour with the Name: Whence is this derived? — R. Eleazar stated on the authority of R. Oshaia: The text reads, <i>If thou wilt not observe to do</i> etc. (Deut. XXVIII, 58. The verse continues: <i>That thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, the Lord thy God,</i> which intimates that one should not utter the Divine Name in vain and likewise one who curses his neighbour with the Divine Name is included in the same category). And it is written, <i>Then the Lord will make thy plagues wonderful</i> (v. 59). Now I do not know what is the nature of this <i>wonder</i> (peculiarity of punishment). But when it says (<i>ibid.</i> XXV, 2): <i>That the judge cause him to lie down to be beaten</i> (<span>והפילו</span> which is similar to the expression <span>והפלא</span> <i>He will make … wonderful</i>), this indicates that the <i>wonderful</i> (punishment) refers to punishment with lashes … Why not say … since he transgresses two things, first in uttering the Lord’s Name in vain and then in irritating his fellow, consequently, punishment with lashes should not suffice? — You cannot say thus, for it is written, <i>Thou shalt not curse the deaf</i> (Lev. XIX, 14 whether with or without the Divine Name).’ Thus also in Y. Sheb. IV, 10(35d) in accord with R. Jose <i>contra</i> the Colleagues. , however, <i>RaBaD</i> to Yad <i>ibid.</i> who on the basis of Y. <i>ibid.</i> deduces that if one cursed with a substitute he is not punished by lashes.
