            "In these time judges judge the laws of  confessions to a loan, loans, kesuba of a woman, inheritance, gifts, and cases which damage anothers money(assets, or income) because these cases are common always. Case which are not common even though there is a loss of money for example a animal that wounds another animal, or cases which are common but don't have a loss of money  such as paying double (when fined for stealing an item) and such is the case with all fines that the sages instituted like a fine for when someone blows in into his friends ear and scares him, or hits his friend, and so to in any case where they required one to pay more then the principal amount of damage or where you would be required half the damage we don't judge them. they may only be judged by specialist who have smicha in Israel. Except in the case where you pay half the damage for damage caused by pebbles (such as when an animal walks and it kicks up pebbles and they cause damage) because this is a loss of money, and not a fine (a fine is extra punishment to the value of a principle damage) "

(Tur in the name of his father, the Rosh, in the beginning of Sanhedrin) but in any case, they are able to accept the [possibility of] error, and send them before a teacher.) (Maharam Paduah, Section 43) And they may judge a man against his will if the defendant refuses to go down to judgement or if he does not want to be judged with the prosecutor in his town. But, if he wants to be judged with him in his town, but does not want to be judged by the three judges that the prosecutor chose, then he [the defendant] chooses one judge, and he [the prosecutor] chooses one judge. Note: Like what is taught later on in Section 13. And it seems to me that this is specifically with judges that were not set, but if there are judges that were set in the city, he may not say, \"I will not be judged before them, rather with this [judge], I choose,\" and this is the practice in our town. And see later Section 22 end of paragraph 1."

If there was no custom in the city but the majority of the men in the city come from an area where there is a custom, we go according to the custom of the city from which they come. If they came from a place where the custom is to work from dawn to dusk to a place where that is not the custom, or the reverse, we go according to the custom of the place in which they were hired (Nemukei Yosef on the beginning of Chapter 7 of Bava Metzia, \"One Who Hires Worker\", based on the Talmud Yerushalmi).

If, however, the work involves an immediate loss - e.g., he hired the workers to remove flax from the vat, or he hired a donkey to bring flutes for a funeral or for a wedding or the like - neither a worker nor a contractor may retract (a maid or a servant of the employer considered an immediate loss since the employer is not able to do the work himself, therefore he suffers a loss) unless he is held back by forces beyond his control -e.g., he became ill (him or his wife or his children) or he heard that a close relative died. (However the employer does not have to pay the full wage, but only for their work, they {the workers} have the upper hand. If the employer re-employees the workers after the circumstance is over without specifying anything, and they come back to do their job then he pays them in full and does not deduct anything. If not, then the employer deducts all the sick or unfortunate days, even though he didn't back out. The same ruling is for a teacher who fell ill, you deduct the sick days. However if the worker or teacher already received their payment then some say that he does not have to return. A teacher who backs out is considered 'immediate loss' the same applies to a scribe who accepted to write a book and backed out in the middle, is considered 'immediate loss'. Teachers are classified like other workers who need to act as is customary to start and to finish work, as explained in Siman 331. He is prohibited from doing other work while he is teaching or to stay up at night excessively or to minimize or add in food, and whoever changes has the 'lower hand' and is removed. A teacher who was hired for a set period of time has the laws of a worker. If he was hired to teach a book or half a book then he has the laws of a contractor, see Siman 33, 34 &amp; 35 regarding the laws of a teacher.) If the worker is not held back by forces beyond his control, and he retracts, the owner may hire others on their account or deceive them. (If he found other workers to hire and he deceived the original workers then he has to pay them based on his last agreement.) What is meant by deceiving them? He tells them: \"I agreed to pay you a sela; take two so that you will complete your work.\" Afterwards, he is not required to give them anything more than he originally agreed. Moreover, even if he gave them two, he can compel them to return the additional amount. (A volunteer can back out, even if it causes 'immediate loss'.)", 
            "What is meant by hiring others on their account? He hires other workers who complete their task so that he will not suffer a loss. Whatever he must add to pay these later workers beyond the amount the first workers agreed upon, he may take from the first workers. To what extent are the first workers responsible? For their entire wage. Moreover, if they have money that is in the employer's possession, the employer can use that money to hire workers to complete their work until he pays each worker 40 or 50 zuz a day although he originally hired the worker at three or four zuz.

However, if the beit din sees a necessity for a preventative measure, it has the authority to institue whatever punishment they see fit (ibid., from the Responsa of the Natronai Gaon), as explained above in Siman 2.
