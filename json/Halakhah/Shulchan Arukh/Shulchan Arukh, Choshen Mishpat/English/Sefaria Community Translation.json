            "In these time judges judge the laws of  confessions to a loan, loans, kesuba of a woman, inheritance, gifts, and cases which damage anothers money(assets, or income) because these cases are common always. Case which are not common even though there is a loss of money for example a animal that wounds another animal, or cases which are common but don't have a loss of money  such as paying double (when fined for stealing an item) and such is the case with all fines that the sages instituted like a fine for when someone blows in into his friends ear and scares him, or hits his friend, and so to in any case where they required one to pay more then the principal amount of damage or where you would be required half the damage we don't judge them. they may only be judged by specialist who have smicha in Israel. Except in the case where you pay half the damage for damage caused by pebbles (such as when an animal walks and it kicks up pebbles and they cause damage) because this is a loss of money, and not a fine (a fine is extra punishment to the value of a principle damage) "

(Maharam Paduah, Section 43) And they may judge a man against his will if the defendant refuses to go down to judgement or if he does not want to be judged with the prosecutor in his town. But, if he wants to be judged with him in his town, but does not want to be judged by the three judges that the prosecutor chose, then he [the defendant] chooses one judge, and he [the prosecutor] chooses one judge. Note: Like what is taught later on in Section 13. And it seems to me that this is specifically with judges that were not set, but if there are judges that were set in the city, he may not say, \"I will not be judged before them, rather with this [judge], I choose,\" and this is the practice in our town.

            "1. Anyone who knows testimony that another has a use for, and is fit to testify, is obligated to testify if he is called to testify in court. This is true whether he is solo or has another witness with him. If he withholds his testimony, he is exempt from judgement by man but is liable by the laws of the heavens. A solo witness should only testify on monetary matters where he may require an oath or for a matter of prohibition where he is causing someone to separate from the prohibition. If the prohibition was already done, however, he should not testify because he is merely gossiping about the individual. A person is prohibited from testifying regarding a matter he does not know, even if it was told to him by a truthful person. Even if one were to tell him to merely stand with another witness, but not actually testify, in order to intimidate the borrower who will think he has two witnesses and get the borrower to confess, the witness may not do so.",

If they don’t testify, they will carry their sin. Nevertheless, if the court sees a need to have them swear to say the truth, they may do so. See earlier 17:3 and later 71:7-8. There are those that say that when a cherem is placed, even relatives and the party himself must testify. There are those that disagree and this is the primary ruling. See Yoreh Deah Siman 232 regarding a king who commands the placement of a cherem for testimony.",

If a gentile calls a Jew to secular court, and there is a Jew who is the only one that knows testimony for the gentile, and it is a situation where secular courts obligate payment based on a solo witness, the Jew is prohibited from testifying for him. If he testifies, we place a shmuti on him. The witness is not obligated to pay, however, because he can say I testified truthfully. If, however, one can determine that he testified falsely, he is obligated to pay. If the party admits that the testimony was true, we do not place a shmuti on him. If the gentile originally designated him as a witness, it is a desecration of God's name not to testify and he must testify for him.",
            "4. If a Jew calls a gentile to court who denies the claims, and the gentile has a solo witness, he may testify for him. All the more so can two witnesses testify because even a Jewish court would obligate payment based on their words. The same applies in a situation where we would take away money based on a solo witness, and he can testify. Two relatives are like one witnesses because under our laws we do not take away money based on a solo witness.",

If a scholar knows testimony for a Jew and is called to testify in front of a court that is inferior to him, he is not obligated to go and testify in a monetary case unless they send someone to him to have him testify. If, however, there is a possibility of having someone refrain from violating a prohibition, he is obligated to go and testify. Anyone who has a proof via witnesses is required to make the effort to bring them to court. If the court knows that his adversary is tough, and the plaintiff claims that the witnesses are afraid of testifying because of the adversary and he has proof to this claim, the court may force the adversary to bring those witnesses. The same applies to similar issues that arise for a tough person. Ideally, witnesses must stand while testifying. If a witness is a scholar, we have him sit. See later at the end of this Siman.",
            "6. Ideally, the judges should sit while accepting testimony. They must understand the language of the testimony and they may not hear it via a translator.

The judge must extensively investigate them. If one witnesses says his testimony and the second says \"I say the same thing,\" it would not work unless he went overseas and he cannot testify explicitly.",

We are not concerned that he does not remember it as well because of the significant passage of time, even if he only remembers the testimony via a writing provided to him. If he wrote it in his documents so as to remember, and then forgot, and now only remembers because of the writing, he can still testify, so long as he remembers the actual matter once he sees the writing. See later 46:10.",
            "14. Similarly, if the witness remembers the matter only after someone else reminded him, he may still testify. This is true even if the person that reminds him is the second witness. If, however, the party reminds him and he remembers, he may not testify. If the witness is a scholar, he may testify even if the party reminded him because the scholar certainly would not testify if he did not remember.",
            "15. We do not accept testimony if the party is not in court. If they accepted the testimony, they cannot rule based on it. They can re-testify in front of the party. If they changed their testimony from the original testimony, we follow the second testimony that was in front of the party, even if they testified originally with a cherem, because any testimony not in front of a party is as if it was given outside of court. There are those that disagree and say that once testimony has been accepted outside the court, it is okay after the fact. Therefore, if the party is strong and the witnesses are afraid to testify in front of him, we can accept the testimony not in front of the party, and judge accordingly. However, if it is possible to force the strong party in the way that was explained in paragraph 5 of this Siman, that would be preferred. There are those that say that the concept of not accepting testimony if not in front of the party is only by monetary cases, but not for quarreling and fighting where we are concerned that if they testify in front of the parties they will fight with one another and with the witnesses. The Geonim instituted that for such a case we accept testimony not in front of the parties and we do not reveal the identity of the witnesses. It seems to me that this is only where the court does not want to judge strict law and punish, but instead wants to quiet the fighting and rule based on the needs of the particular dispute. If, however, they want to punish and judge one of them, they must accept the testimony in front of him, as will be explained in Even Haezer 11:4.",
            "16. If a party or the witnesses were sick, we may accept testimony not in front of the party. If the witnesses wanted to go overseas, and the party is sent for but does not come, or he is not in the city, we may accept testimony not in front of him. If they did not tell the party, however, they may not accept, unless there was a concern that the witnesses would leave by the time they told him, as will be explained later. If the defendant is sick, we do not accept testimony if not in front of him, even if there is a concern that his properties will transfer to his orphans and the plaintiff will not be able to litigate with them, as will be explained in Siman 110. There are those that say that any time they send after someone and he does not come to court, we can accept testimony not in front of him if they began the claims in front of him, or even where they did not begin the claims if it’s a situation where he is required to be judged in front of those judges, as was explained in Siman 14. Similarly, if there is a pressing need and it is impossible to accept the testimony later, such as where the witnesses or plaintiff were sick and in danger of dying or where the witnesses are going overseas and we cannot wait to tell him, we may accept even without sending for him. This seems correct based on that which is ruled later in 140:10.",
            "17. If Reuven makes a claim against Shimon and Reuven's witnesses are in a different place, the court will tell Shimon that he can decide whether to go to the place of the witnesses so that they can testify in front of him or, alternatively, a court in the place of the witnesses will accept their testimony not in front of him and relay it to this court where the parties are and they will judge based on such acceptance of testimony. The same applies where he located his witnesses in another city and there is no time to send for the other party or they will not be able to find them again. The court may accept the testimony not in front of the parties, and judge based on that testimony. This is the widespread custom in our countries, notwithstanding the fact that there are those that argue and hold one cannot accept testimony not in front of the parties if they did not send for the party first, even in a situation where there is a concern that the testimony will be lost if they insist on accepting in front of the party. That is not our custom- rather, we have the aforementioned custom.",
            "18. The entire concept of not accepting testimony if not in front of the parties was only said where the plaintiff brings witnesses supporting his claim. We do, however, accept testimony from witnesses that are brought to exempt a party.",
            "19. We do not accept witnesses against a minor, even if in front of the minor, because in front of a minor is the equivalent of not in front of him. The specifics of this rule will be explained in Siman 110.",
            "20. Two people are not qualified to accept testimony. If they accepted testimony, it is meaningless.",
            "21. The acceptance of testimony requires three experts who are familiar with the rules of valid and invalid witnesses and are careful that each testimony conforms with the other, as the Mishna says, “one must be careful with his words lest he learn to lie from them.” Anyone who accepts testimony and is not fit to judge, is as if he accepted false testimony. One cannot judge based on such a document. Rather, they rely on the actual witnesses.",
            "22. It is appropriate for those that accepted the testimony to publicize who the witnesses are in the document of the acceptance of testimony. However, there is no harm if they did not write who the witnesses are.",
            "23. If the community wants to institute that the two scribes accept the testimony and collect based on their words or if they want the signature of the scribe to count as two witnesses if a witness that was called to testify had to leave, such rules would be valid because on all these matters the public has permission to institute as they see fit in their cities.",
            "24. If one claims that he has two sets of witnesses and one set says that they do not know anything, the party does not forfeit his rights and may be bring the second set. We only accept testimony during the day. If they accepted it at night- even where the witnesses were being chased overseas, we may not judge based on that acceptance of testimony. If, however, the parties accepted the right to accept testimony at night, we may even accept in the first instance.",
            "25. We cannot accept testimony before the defendant responds to the plaintiff because the defendant may confess and we will not need the witnesses. There is no need to burden the court.",
            "26. If the court was standing while accepting the testimony from the witnesses, what’s done is done. If they were leaning, it is even permitted in the first instance because leaning is like sitting. In Siman 17 we explained that today we have the custom to seat the witnesses."

If the witness said I erred, I made a mistake and now I remember the matter differently or I said it out of fear, we do not listen to him- even if he provides a rationale to his retraction. Similarly, he cannot add a condition to his testimony. (There are those that say he may add a condition) (Tur in the name of the Rosh). However, in a situation where it is clear that he erred, such as where the court demanded he bring witnesses to testify that he is not a fraudster, he brings them and the court asks him do you know him as a fraudster, and they say yes, and the party responds “you know that I am a fraudster?!” and they say we said you are not a fraudster, we believe their latter statement because it is assumed that a person does not bring witnesses to harm him and they certainly erred. Similarly, in any error that witnesses often make, they themselves are believed and there is no issue of re-testifying. Similarly, if they don’t contradict the substance of their words, such as where there words were vague and can be interpreted in one of two ways- one more probable than the other, we can conform their testimonies in any practical way in the same manner that we explain two witnesses that contradict each other in order that the testimonies conform. <i>RAMA: In a situation where they placed a cherem in the synagogue that anyone who has testimony should testify before he leaves the synagogue, and the witnesses come after they leave the synagogue and say we didn’t recall at the time but now we remember, they may testify since they were originally silent and never said they did not know (Mordechai). Even in a case where they said they don’t know, if they can provide a rationale as to why they said it, they may testify since they did not say the reverse of what they said later (Beis Yosef in the name of the Rambam and the Tur)</i>",

If one said he borrowed money in Nisan and the second says it was in Iyar or one said it was in Jerusalem and other said it was in Lud, the testimony is void.

Even if one says he lent him a maneh and the other says it was 200, he is obligated to pay because a maneh is included in 200.

If, however, they all testified on the same day and contradict each other, he must only pay 200.

For example, if one says it was on the second of the month and the other says it was the third of the month in a situation we can say they are both testifying about the same day and they erred regarding whether the prior month was a full month, we can combine the testimony by saying that they are testifying on the same maneh. If it is clear that they are testifying on two different maneh, one of them is clearly lying and we would have the defendant take a biblical oath and he would be exempt. <i>RAMA: If one witness testifies that Reuven gave Shimon land via a kinyan and the other witness testifies that Shimon made an appropriate chazaka, we can combine them because it is like an admission after an actual loan.

Similarly, if the lender confessed in front of one that he was paid back 100 in Nissan and confessed in front of the second that he was paid back in Tishrei, or one testifies that he paid back a maneh and the second testifies that he confessed in front of him, they can be combined and the lender cannot say it was for a different debt.",

When is this true? In a situation where they all intended to testify. If, however, they did not all intend to testify, the testimony can be sustained with the remaining witnesses. How do we investigate the matter? The court would ask them if when they saw the incident they were there with the intention to witness or merely to see the incident. The court would separate anyone who says they came to testify. If a relative or someone otherwise disqualified is found among those that intended to testify, their testimony is void (even if they were not aware of each other). If all of the witnesses were valid- both those that intended to testify and those that did not but happened to see- and their testimony conforms, we would rule based on their testimony. <i>RAMA:  They are not, however, able to write a document regarding the incident even if they witnessed a kinyan and the presumption of a kinyan is that it should be writing, because the party did not call them for that purpose.

A public regulation that has the signature of a disqualified witness or a document that contains the signature of a party, is still valid with other witnesses because these individuals did not have the intention of testifying.

If the plaintiff called valid witnesses and relatives or those otherwise disqualified were standing there, the testimony of the valid witnesses would not be disqualified even if the disqualified witnesses had the intention to testify and actually testified.

Similarly, if Reuven sold or bequeathed the stolen field to Levi and Yehuda brings a claim against Levi, Shimon cannot testify that it does not belong to Yehuda. If Shimon sold the stolen garment to Levi, Shimon gave up on reclaiming it and Yehuda brings a claim against Levi, Shimon may testify that it is not Yehuda’s if Reuven had died because this garment will never go back to Shimon since the buyer already acquired it with the giving up of hope and the transfer of possession and Reuven the thief had died, so there is no one to collect the money from. If, however, Reuven was still alive, Shimon may not even testify on the garment because there is a benefit to him for the garment not to go to Yehuda so that he can bring a proof that Reuven stole it and Reuven will have to pay. Similarly, if the garment was in the possession of Reuven’s inheritors, Shimon may not testify because it will eventually go back to Shimon if the inheritors can maintain possession. The same applies to anything similar. Even in a case where Reuven died, Shimon may only testify if the sale was unsecured. If, however, the sale was secured, Reuven’s estate would be liable and thus Shimon has a stake in the testimony. Now that the rabbis have instituted that a creditor may even collect from a moveable item, a victim of theft may not even testify in a case where the thief died and the sale was unsecured because the victim still has a stake in the testimony. <i>RAMA: This all applies only where Shimon wants to testify that the field or garment does not belong to Yehuda.

Similarly if the lender died and his heirs come to the witnesses to write a deed for them, they may write it. There are those who differ and say that if this happens after 30 days [for a debt with no specified due date], they should not write a deed, and if there is a due date specified, they should not write a deed after that date, lest the borrower has already repaid. <i>RAMA: If the borrower did not give explicit instructions to write and hand over a deed to the lender, but the witnesses did so anyway, it is worth no more than a ledger entry (Teshuvas Rashb\"a 1:211).

(Tur, in the name of the Rambam [the Rashbam] and Nikutei Yosef, Get Pashut). Witnesses testifying on a document may testify even if not in the presence of the parties. (Rabbeinu Yerucham in the name of the Rashbah).</i> The witnesses on the document themselves, however, may not write another document for the lender. They may, however, come to court and the court will verify the document. How do they verify this document? They draft another document that says, “we, the court of so and so, so and so and so and so, had produced in front of us by so and so a document that was erased and had such and such date with so and so and so and so as witnesses.” If the court wrote that they processed the witnesses’ testimony and the testimony conformed, the lender can collect with this document that they wrote for him and he would not need any other verification. If the court did not write this language, the lender would need to bring an additional proof on the original witnesses until their testimony is verified. (Until here is the opinion of the Rambam)<i>RAMA: If the witnesses are not verified, it is as if the lender produced an unverified document.(HaMagid, Chapter 23).</i> There are those that say that it must state in the verification that they tore up the original document because otherwise we are concerned that the lender will go to another court who will process another verification for him and then he can collect and recollect. With respect to a gift document that was erased, however, we would write another document even though the first has not been torn up. <i>RAMA: We would use the original date and not the date the court is writing the new document on (Beis Yosef in the name of Tosefos)</i>. In a case where the gift was secured or in a case of a transaction document, however, the court must tear up the original document or write in the second document that this document is not intended to allow for collection from properties sold to a third party or to collect from unsold properties, but simply to enable this particular field to remain in the hand of the gift-recipient or the buyer and prevent the gift-giver or seller from reclaiming it.",
            "2. If one had his loan document erased, he may arrange for witnesses who will come to court and verify the document. This is only where there are witnesses that it was erased accidentally. If, however, the lender deliberately erased the document or he left the document in an unsafe place where it was erased, they would not verify the document for him because the fact that he left it in an unsafe place indicates that it was certainly paid back.",
            "3. If one had a document and misplaced it and comes to court to have the document replaced, we would not write it, even if he brought the witnesses from the original document who testify that they wrote the document and gave it to him. Therefore, a court should not duplicate any document unless they see a particular need for it such as the case of an erased document. If the court wrote the outline of a document for someone and that person comes to court with it, the court would not collect based on that document until he produces the substance of the document unless there was a written reason as to why they made another document, such as because the previous document was erased or something similar and the witnesses knew the document was lost. If, however, the witnesses did not know it was lost, they would not write another document for him. Even if there are witnesses that a document was misplaced, we would not write another document because we are concerned the lender will find it unless there are witnesses testifying that the document was burnt. <i>RAMA: This is only true with regards to loan documents. With respect to unsecured transactional documents, however, we would write another document if the original was lost. We do not, however, duplicate a document for no purpose (Teshuvos HaRosh, Klal 68, Seif 16, 21, 23, 24). In the case of a will that contains gifts to many, where one person comes to court and asks that they document his particular gift, we would write it for him because such a document would not work to collect money with because it is not a formal document and the orphans can claim they paid it back (Teshuvos HaRashbah, Siman 978 and Teshuvos HaRamban, Siman 83)</i>. We would, however, write a new document if the original document was in the hands of a third party who misplaced it because there is no concern the lender may find it considering it was not in his possession (<i>Teshuvos HaRashbah, Siman 978 and see below 253 and see there Seif 2</i>). If the borrower was overseas, and the lender is concerned taking the document because he is afraid he may lose it on the road, he may come to court who will write another document and the lender will leave the original document in the court in his city. The court in the borrower’s city would inform the court in the lender’s city once the loan has been paid back and the court would tear up the original document in their possession.  If the duplicate document was misplaced while he was traveling to the borrower and witnesses are aware of the loss, they would go in front of court and testify that it was misplaced and they would return the document in their possession. <i>RAMA: (Tur) Any document that is duplicated is written letter for letter from the original. They would write on it that it is a duplicate. A court is not required for the duplication. Even two witnesses are able to duplicate (and even if they are related to one another).

            "4. If one had a documented debt owed by his counterparty and he lost the document but the witnesses are accessible, and the borrower claims he paid back, the borrower would be believed with a heses oath even if a kinyan was made. The borrower is believed with a heses oath to say he paid back even if the payment deadline had not passed because the lender no longer possesses the document and we are concerned that the borrower paid back, which is why the document was ripped up or burnt. Even if a third party produced the document and the borrower claims he had dropped it after paying back the loan, he would be believed with a heses oath and would be exempt from paying, even if  the deadline for payment had not yet passed, because once the lender no longer has the document we do not apply the principle that a person does not pay back before the deadline. If, however, the lender gave the document as a deposit to a third party, and the guardian is the one that produces the document, the borrower is not believed to say he paid back and the document fell from him and the third party found it, even if the guardianship was not done in front of witnesses. <i>RAMA: If one has documents in a city that was conquered, we can assume they were lost and we would write another document. Even if the borrower were to strongly protest we would not concern ourselves. (Maharik, Shoresh 116).</i>",

If they wrote the document on it, the document is invalid, even with respect to an immediate collection. <i>This is only true with respect to a loan document. With respect to a kinyan document, however, it would be valid (R\"an Perek 2 Gittin). Any document that is not made as the Rabbis instituted is invalid, even if there is no rationale to invalidate it. Therefore, if one were to make a tied-up document today it would be invalid.

            "2. A document can be written in any language and any script so long as the scribe is careful that there is no modification in that text.",
            "3. The appropriate way to draft a document is to pay attention to the vov’s and zayin’s so that they are not stuffed between words lest a party forge the document and add a vav or zayin. The letters should not be far apart from one another lest a party erase one letter like a hey or ches and leave the leg in place of a vov. One must be careful with anything similar in any other language and any other script (Tur). Therefore, a scribe must be careful when writing a document to have the letters looks similar to each other and the writing should be straight and equal in all aspects so that the letters are not too far apart from each other. The scribe should not press the writing together too much nor should he press in one area and give space in another area. Therefore, witnesses are not permitted to sign until they investigate all the words of the document well and when the document is produced in front of the judge, the judge must investigate all the words and compare each letter. If the judges sees any aberration, the party may not collect with it until (the judge) investigates the matter well. (Any issue which can be explained by an erasure, is attributed to an erasure) (Nimukei Yosef). If the judge needs to strike the document-holder to get him to confess, he may to do so in order to have the true ruling emerge. There are those that say that this only applies where we are coming to take money from inheritors or buyers in which case we rule that we may set forth claims on behalf of them. If, however, the court is taking money from a borrower, seller or gift-giver directly and the defendant does not claim that there is anything wrong with the document, we would not make the claim for him.",
            "4. The scribe must be careful not to write any number from “shalosh” to “eser” at the end of the line, lest a party turn ten into twenty or three into 30. <i> RAMA: If the scribe wrote “shlosha” or “asara” that is fine because there is no concern of forgery. (Beis Yosef in the name of Tosefos and others)</i> If the number ends up on the last line, the scribe must repeat the matter a few times until it occurs in the middle of line. Similarly, the scribe must be careful not to write it number form, such as “beis” or “daled” so that party does not turn it into a “chaf” or “reish.” <i>RAMA: If the scribe does not follow this, the document is forgeable and invalid. If, however, he wrote gematriot (i.e. math equations) or acronyms where forgery is impossible, the document is valid. (Hagahot Mordechai, Gittin)</i>",
            "5. If the top of the document says one thing and the bottom says something else and it is possible to maintain both points, we would maintain them. If, however, they contradict each other, such as where the top says a maneh and the bottom says 200 or vice-versa, we follow the bottom so long as it is not the last line in a case where the document does not conclude with “everything is affirmed and verified.” <i>RAMA: With respect to taking away from the document-owner, however, we would make a deduction from the last line. (Nimukei Yosef in the name of the Ritva and the Rama). If the sum at the bottom was deleted, the whole document is invalid because it is possible that the bottom said only one dinar. (Hagahos Ashiri).</i> There are those that say if the top was counting out the amounts and the bottom contained the sum which was less or more than the top, we would say they certainly erred in the calculation and we would follow the listed out numbers. This view appears correct. When is it true that we follow the bottom? Where one amount is not dependent on the other. If, however, the document says “100, which is 200” or “200, which is 100” the document-owner would only be able to collect 100- the lower of the two- because the document-owner is in the inferior position.",
            "6. If a letter from the bottom was erased but it was possible to deduce what was missing based on what was on top, we would make the deduction from the top. For example, if the top said a party owed Chanani and the bottom said Chanan the bottom would learn from the top and the party would pay Chanani. If, however, there were two letters missing, we would not make the deduction. For example, if the top said Chanani and the bottom said Chen- even if the top word had six letters and only two were missing from the bottom – we would not make the deduction. Given that we do not make the deduction and we know the document was erased, the document is now disqualified and one cannot collect with it. With respect to one letter, however, we would make the deduction, even if the top word only had two letters and we are using it to deduce half a word. If something was missing but there was no erasure, and the top said Chanani and the bottom said Chen, that is certainly a retraction because a scribe would not err on two letters, and the party must pay Chen.",
            "7. If the top said the measurement of safel (1.5 seah) and the bottom said the measurement of kafel (1.5 kav), we would follow the bottom because a kafel is less than a safel. If the top said kafel and the bottom said safel, we are concerned that a fly caused the leg of the kuf to turn into a samach and the party can only collect a kafel. The same applies to anything similar because the document-owner is in the inferior position.",
            "8. In all the above cases where we say the document-owner is in the inferior position, if the document-owner were to take possession of his adversary’s moveable items, we would not take it away from him. <i>RAMA: All the more so would we say that when it comes to possession of a receipt, the document-owner has the superior position because he is already the possessor, (Nimukei Yosef in the name of the Ra'ah) and not like those that disagree and say that even by a receipt we use the principle of the document-holder being in the inferior position. (There, in the name of the Ritva his student).</i>",
            "9. We do not use the principle of the document-owner being in the inferior position except in the aforementioned cases where the document has not been completely voided. If, however, the issue is one that voids the document, the principle would not apply. For example, if the document says so and so owes so and so a maneh by Pesach, the borrower must pay him by the first Pesach and he cannot say I will pay him by Pesach in years from now. The same applies to anything similar. <i>RAMA: There are those that say this is only for matters that can be attributed to a mistake. With respect to a matter that the giver erred on, however, such as where he used a language for a gift that is of no effect, the document is certainly void.(Teshuvos HaRashba; Maharik, Shoresh 94).</i>",
            "10. There are many commentators that write that today where we have the custom to write “this document is not an asmachta and not an outline,” we would say the document-owner is in the superior position for any doubt arising out of the language of the document. <i>RAMA: If language is included in a document to bolster the document-owner’s status and is understood by the average listener this way, we would judge accordingly, even though it is bolstering the document-owner’s status.

            "12. If a document says “selaim,” and the lender says it was five while the borrower claims it was two, the borrower must pay the two and take a heses oath on the rest. If the lender were to grab the difference, we would take it back from him.",
            "13. If a document says so and so borrowed from so and so silver, the borrower would need to give a minimal piece of silver of the lightest weight. If the document says silver currency and silver perutos were used in that locale, the borrower must give one perutah. If silver perutos are not used in that locale, the borrower would give the smallest amount of silver currency that is used there. If the document says dinarim of silver, the borrower would give silver that is worth two dinar of gold. If the document says gold in dinar, the borrower would give gold worth two gold dinar. If the document says silver in dinar, the borrower would give pieces of silver worth two silver dinar. If the document says gold, the borrower would give a piece of gold that is the lowest weight of gold. If the document says gold currency, the borrower would give the smallest amount of gold currency that is used. If the document says gold dinarim or dinar of gold, the borrower would give two gold dinar. If the document says gold in dinarim, the borrower would give gold that is worth two dinars of silver. (<i>In today’s age there is no distinction between saying “dinarin” or “dinari.”) (Magid, end of Melaveh)(And it seems to me that we give him the lesser one)</i>",
            "14. If one produces a document against another with a sum of 110 dinar or selaim (<i>and the currency is undefined - Tur</i>) and it was written in Bavel, the lender would collect Babylonian currency. If it was written in Israel, the lender would collect Israeli currency. If no location is written in the document and the lender produced the document in Bavel, he would collect Babylonian currency. If the lender produced the document in Israel, he would collect Israeli currency. If the lender attempts to collect the currency where he produced the document and the borrower claims he owes him silver that is worth less than this currency, the lender would take an oath and collect. <i>RAMA: If, however, the borrower proves that they originally lived in a place with a less valuable currency, he only has to give the lesser currency. (R\"an end of Ketuvot)</i> If the document says 100 silver but does not say if it is selaim or pundyon, the lender would collect whatever the borrower desires.",
            "15. If the document simply says an amount, we would follow the custom that they typically use in that locale. For example, there was a document that said 600 and zuzim and it was unclear whether it was 600 istira and a zuz or 600 zuz and a zuz, we rule that the borrower gives 600 istirii, which is less. We would not, however, entertain that it was 600 perutos because people don’t include a sum total of perutos in a document. We follow any language that is often in used documents, even if it was not an institution of the Rabbis but a language that the common-folk use in that locale. Even if the language was not written, we would judge the case as if it was. <i>RAMA: The same applies for any institution by the community or any city custom. (Rambam, Ishot Perek 23) If one raises an orphan in his home and writes “my son” in a document or the orphan writes about the individual that raised him “my father” or “my mother,” it is not considered forged and it is a valid document because it is appropriate to write this considering that he raised him.

If, however, there is a line-size space, the document is valid and we are not concerned that they had left two lines of space and the party added what he wanted in one line and left the other line-size space blank.

Nowadays, we have the custom to write the verification of erasures and hanging letters after “and they have made a kinyan” because today the practice is for all documents to say “affirmed and verified” so it is impossible to forge, we deduce from the last line and we do not need to review the content of the document on the last line. Thus, a document that does not say “affirmed and verified” would be invalid. Witnesses should not sign a document unless it says “affirmed and verified.” If the document says “affirmed and verified” twice, it is still valid <i>(but one should not do it in the first instance.

Even if the borrower confesses and says it is true that he instructed it to be written but he paid back, it was given on trust or he wrote it with the intention to borrow but he never borrowed or anything similar, he is believed because if he wanted he could have said the loan never occurred and the document is only verified on his say-so.

This is in fact the widespread custom in these countries. The rationale seems to me to be that we hold that a solo expert has the status of three laymen with respect to the rabbinical verification of documents and is therefore considered a court as was explained earlier in Siman 25.

            "7. A document can be verified in one of five ways: (i) the judges recognize the witness’ handwriting, (ii) the witnesses sign in front of the judges, (iii) the witnesses that signed on the document come and each one says, “this is my handwriting and I am a witness on this matter,” (iv) witnesses come and testify that this is the handwriting of these witnesses and they may testify this testimony in writing and do not need to testify verbally, (Rivash, Seif 382) or (v) their handwriting is produced from other documents and the court will compare this writing to the writing in other documents and determine that those witness’ handwriting is the same as these witnesses. We do not verify a document from other documents except from two documents of two fields where the owners consumed a public consumption for three years without any fear or trepidation from any claim in the same manner that all field-owners consume their fields or from two kesubos, so long as the documents are produced from a third party and not from this individual who is looking to verify the document because he may have forged all of them. <i>(We would not verify the documents if they were produced from the party’s hand, even if both documents were verified.

When a document is verified with others testifying that this is the witness’ handwriting, if one witness testifies on one signature and a second testifies on the other, the document is not verified because we require two witnesses on each one of the signatures.

If one signed on a document and comes to court to testify on his own handwriting and he recognizes his signature with certainty but does not remember the testimony at all and he cannot recall that this party ever borrowed from this one, he is prohibited from testifying on this handwriting that is in this court because a person does not testify that this is his handwriting but that this party owed that party the actual money in the document. The handwriting is merely a form of reminding him of the incident, but if he does not remember he cannot testify. Thus, if a document was produced in court and witnesses come and say this is our handwriting but we never knew of such testimony and we have no recollection that this party borrowed from or sold to the other, the document would not be verified and the witnesses have a status of the deaf until they recall their testimony. Any judge who does not judge accordingly does not know between his right and left when it comes to monetary law. If, however, the witness’ handwriting was produced from another place or there were other witnesses that testified that this was their handwriting, we would verify the document and we would not pay attention to the words of the witnesses that say we don’t recall the testimony because the document is being verified without their words. This is the reason we are able to verify all documents and we do not require to bring the witnesses and ask them if they remember the testimony or not because even if they were to come and say we don’t remember the incident, we would not listen to them since we can verify the document without their words. These were the words of the Rambam. There are those that disagree and say that even if they do not recall that the party borrowed or that they ever signed on this document and we do not have their handwriting from any other source, since they are testifying that this is their handwriting, we would verify the document based on their words. Under this approach, when the witnesses themselves are coming to testify that this is their handwriting, if they forgot the loan and do not remember signing this document at all, we would require two witnesses on each signature. Therefore, we would need each witnesses to testify on his signature and on his co-witness’ signature or a third party should join them and testify on both their handwriting in order to have two witnesses on each signature. <i>RAMA: We do not require a witness to remember his testimony except in a case of a solo witness or with two witnesses when it comes to verifying the document. With respect to two witnesses that sign on the document, however, if they did not remember the incident at all and the document was not written as was instituted, there would still be a testimony of witnesses (Mahar\"iv, Siman 94; Hagahot Mordechai, Kesuvos) and if the document was verified we would follow whatever is written in it. Although this document does not have the status of a complete document, it is considered a document with respect to not having the testimony considered as written testimony as was explained above in 28:12.

Even if we were unaware at the time of his admission that he owed others money and we only discovered this later, he would not be believed since he is coming to negatively impact others. The lender is not even believed where he is negatively impacting himself too, such as where the document is for 200 and he only owes others 100. If after the lender said the document was given on trust, he paid back his creditor and he now wants to use this document to collect from the borrower we analyze the situation. If he said it was given on trust when his creditor came to collect from this document then we say his intent was certainly just to push away his creditor. <i>(If, however, he confessed that the document was given on trust without his creditor making a claim) (Tur), then he cannot retract and collect with the document.</i>",

He can write everything that is contained in the document: the names of the borrower and lender and the description of the money. He must leave the place for the date blank so that the document will not be predated. With respect to a document that was written for one loan and was paid back, however, one cannot re-borrow with it even if it was all on the same day and was therefore not predated because once the lien is waived one cannot re-borrow with the document. If the borrower paid back a portion of the loan, he cannot use the same document to re-borrow that portion because that lien on that portion was already waived. <i>RAMA: There are those that say that concept of the lien being waived only applies for the original kinyan. Thus, if the borrower made a second kinyan, he may re-borrow with the document. (Mordechai, Perek 'Kol HaGet') This applies even if they did not actually make a kinyan but the borrower simply gave the document to the lender in front of witnesses according to the view that the witnesses of transfer are primary even with respect to ordinary documents.

If the witnesses do not recognize any of the foregoing, even a woman or relative would be believed to say that this is the individual's name. In a case where they relied on a woman or relative and it turns out the witnesses erred, we would believe this error occurred where the witness is a scholar <i>(because it is not the practice of scholars to investigate the specifics) (Beis Yosef, in the name of the Rashbam). There are those that say this is only true with respect to a woman because scholars are not familiar with women considering that it is not their practice to gaze at women, as will be explained in Even Haezer Siman 110. With respect to other matters, however, there is no distinction between a scholar and anyone else. The author of the Shulchan Aruch wrote in his sefer Beis Yosef that this view is in fact the primary view.

There are those, however, that explain the reasoning that one cannot produce a document against the other (to be used) because we write documents for a borrower even if not in the presence of the lender so we are concerned that the party that produced it is the borrower. This concern would only apply to a document that contains a kinyan as we said above at the end of Siman 39. That is why the Mechaber wrote that this only applies for a document that contains a kinyan, Thus, his words are contradictory).</i> A third party cannot produce a document on either of them because each one can say it was not written against me but against the other, unless the document’s witnesses themselves come and say that this is the document we testified on and this is the party that we testified was involved in the loan. If other witnesses testify in that way, the loan has the status of a verbal loan. If one of the Yosef ben Shimons was a minor on the date of the document, we would collect from the other. What is the way to rectify this issue? They should write the names of their grandfathers. If their grandfathers also had the same name, they should write some other sign. <i>RAMA: There are those that say that if they are from different cities then they can produce a document against each other because they must write the name of the borrower’s city or the lender’s city in the document. (Tur, in the name of Rabbeinu Yeshayah) There are those that say that we do not write the name of the city in the document (Rambam, Perek 17; Tur, Siman 61) and this is in fact the custom. However, if they are from two different cities and they wrote the name of the city of one of them, this is certainly no worse than a sign and there is no room for error. This is what appears correct to me. If there are two Yosef ben Shimons in one city and one of their fathers had died and in the document it says yv’s, shli’t or nr’v like we write for someone who is alive and the witnesses wrote “Yosef ben Shimon shli’ta told us” that would qualify as a sign. If, however, the document says, “I, Yosef ben Shimon shli’t” or something similar, “borrowed from so and so…” and the witnesses signed below, that would not qualify as a sign because perhaps the second Yosef ben Shimon wrote this with trickery and the witnesses did not pick up on it because they are not signing on everything in the document. (Beis Yosef in the name of the Rashba)</i> If, however, they were to produce a document against a third party, that third party would not be able to say 'I did not owe you but instead owed the other person who has the same name as you', because we assume that the person who produced the document is the rightful owner of the document. <i>RAMA: If, however, Yosef ben Shimon did not produce the document, he would not be able to take away money from the borrower (Nimukei Yosef in the name of the Ritva), even if the borrower confesses that he owes one of them, unless the two Yosef ben Shimons were to write a power-of-attorney to each other. </i> If the borrower is in possession of a receipt from one of them, neither of them can make a claim against the borrower because the borrower can tell each one that you wrote this receipt for me. If, however, they were to write a power-of-attorney to each other, one of them would be able to collect because the borrower admits that he only paid one back. If the borrower claims he paid back both of them but only demanded one receipt because it would suffice to show that receipt to whichever one comes to him to claim the loan, the claim would be valid and the power-of-attorney would not be effective.",

            "10. If one Yosef ben Shimon borrowed from a third party and a field that was purchased by one Yosef ben Shimon from the other was discovered or the two Yosef ben Shimons were partners in a field, the lender cannot collect from the field by saying that had he lent the current owner then he certainly can collect and had he lent the other, considering that the other did not have unencumbered land, the current owner has purchased his lien. Similarly, where the two are partners, the lender cannot claim half of the land on the basis of the fact that he is owed that amount in either instance because a debtor’s properties are only mortgaged as a co-signer to the loan and a co-signer is only indebted to the lender in an instance where the lender can claim from the borrower himself. Since in this case the lender cannot claim from the borrower himself, he cannot collect from his properties either. In effect, in a case where one is a co-signer to two Yosef Ben Shimons- whether there are two lenders or one lender- the lender cannot claim from the co-signer just as he cannot claim from the borrowers.  "

The borrower does have the power to place a general cherem on anyone who hides a document and claims that it is lost. If the borrower claims with certainty that the document is in the lender’s possession and that the lender is leaving it in his wallet, the lender must take a heses oath that he lost the document. Following the oath, the borrower will pay the debt and the receipt will be written.",
            "3. If the lender says he does not have the document in his possession right now but it is in another city and he will write a receipt, there are those that say that we do not listen to him because the document is in existence so the borrower does not have to pay back until the lender returns the document. <i>RAMA: All the more so would the borrower not be required to pay back until the document is returned in a case where the lender has the document in his possession and does not want to return it. Even if the borrower swore to pay back he would be exempt from complying with the oath. (Teshuvos Rashba, Aleph 110) If the lender says to pay him back first and then he will return the document and the borrower says to first return the document and then he’ll pay him, the borrower is in the right. (Ibid., and in Siman 113) It seems to me that if the lender does not trust the borrower he may give the document to a third party until the repayment has been completed. If one owes another a maneh in a document and confesses to 50 but has a claim on the other 50 and the possessor of the document says to give him the 50 the borrower admits to and he will bring a proof for the other 50 and the defendant says that he is not paying anything back until the lender returns the document, if the plaintiff has the ability to bring his proofs now and proceed with the case with the defendant, (See above Siman 24) then the defendant is in the right. If, however, it is impossible for the lender to bring his proofs now or be judged now, as determined by the court, and there is no trickery involved or where the court needs to be patient in ruling, the plaintiff is in the right and the borrower must pay what he admits to immediately and the lender will provide a receipt. (Ibid., Siman תתק\"ל) If a document states that it shall remain in force so long as it has not been torn up with a tear of the court and does not contain a confirmation of repayment on the document, a receipt would still be effective. (Maharik, Shoresh 89) </i>When writing a receipt, if they recall the date of the document, they would write “receipt on the document dated such and such.” If they do not recall the date, they would simply write “on the document whose amount was such and such” and they would not write a date on the receipt lest the witnesses postdated the date of the loan in the document, which may result in the date of receipt preceding the date of the document and the lender will produce the later loan document and collect with it. Therefore, witnesses should not write a date in the receipt unless they remember the date of the loan. A receipt that simply says, “so and so paid back so and so” nullifies that any document that the lender has against the borrower. <i>RAMA: Similarly, if a borrower has witnesses that so and so has a repaid document in his possession, such so and so would not be able to produce a document against the borrower and say that it was a different document that was paid back. Rather, all of this lender’s documents have the status of being repaid. (the Rosh in his Teshuvos, Klal 18, Siman 19)</i>",

            "5. If the receipt just says “dinarim,” it nullifies any document that has dinar in it. If, however, it says “such and such dinarim” and the amount was erased or if the amount was written on erasure and was not verified, we would judge it as if it had the lowest possible amount under that language."

            "1. <b>The Laws of One Who Paid Back a Portion of His Debt and One Who Gives His Document to a Third Party, 2 Seifim:</b> <i>(The words of the Rambam, Perek 11 מה' מכירה)</i>One who paid back a portion of his debt and gave the document to a third party and said “if I do not pay you back by such and such date, give the lender the document” and the borrower did not pay at that time, the third party should not give over the document because this is an asmachta, which is not a valid kinyan. [<i>Ed. Note: An Asmachta is a conditional commitment or promise that a person makes, but actually has no intention of keeping. The agreement is not considered binding, and the commitment is considered null and void.</i>] If they made a kinyan on it in a prestigious court, the party would acquire the document, so long as his rights were being held by the court and an unforeseen occurrence did not occur. How so? If the court is holding on to his document or receipt and they made a kinyan from him that if he does not come by such and such date, then it should be given to his adversary, and the day comes and he does not show up, the court would give it. If he was held up by a river or by a sickness, they would not give it. The same applies to anything similar, so long as it was in a prestigious court. <i>RAMA: There are those that say that we do not require the court to hold on to his document if they have a made a kinyan in a prestigious court, which is three individuals who are experts in the laws of asmachta. (Tur in the name of the Rosh and the Moharam) See later Siman 207. If a third party gives over a document to the lender that he was not supposed to, we excommunicate the third party until he accepts any damages that result to the borrower because of this. (Teshuvos Rashba Aleph 52) If the court is aware that it was returned illegally, they would not judge on the basis of that document. (Beis Yosef in the name of Rashba) If the court was unaware and they took all the money from the borrower and it subsequently became known that the third party returned the document illegally, the third party is exempt because it is an indirect damage. (Teshuvos Rashba Aleph 52)</i>",

Where he says, “If I do not pay back by such and such date, the money that I gave shall be considered a gift and the document shall remain in its original state,” because otherwise it would be a document whose lien was waived for the portion that was paid <i>(See Siman 100:4) (and the lender would not be able to collect anything other than unencumbered properties).

            "1. <b> Laws of a Third Party, 7 Seifim:</b> A third party, so long as he has the item that was given to him in his possession, is believed as if there were two witnesses, even if he is related. He is not required to take an oath. <i>RAMA: Even if the handing over to the third party was written in a document, we do not say that they are not relying on the concept of a third party. Rather, here too the third party would be believed. (Beis Yosef in the name of the Rashba)</i> Even if the timeframe given to hand over the document has passed and the third party has not given the document, he still is a third party and he is believed. The third party is believed even if one of the parties contradicts him and says he never made him a third party. The third party is even believed where both parties contradict him so long as there is no dispute between the parties and the third party regarding the amount of money in his possession, because otherwise the third party would have a stake in the matter and would not be believed <i>RAMA: In a case where the third party does not have a migu. If, however, the third party has a migu, he is believed. (Mordechai, Perek 'HaChovel') [Ed. Note: A migu is a reason that a claim that would otherwise be rejected by a Jewish civil court should be accepted based on the fact that the litigant could have prevailed in the case based on a different claim were he disposed to lie. To be effective, the logic underlying the migu must be impeccable and there are a variety of cases in which the Migu argument is invalid.] The parties may force him to swear, even with an uncertain claim. (Hagahos Mordechai, Gitin)</i> If the third party had the document, produced it in court and says it was paid back, he would be believed even if the document was verified because had he wanted he could have burnt or torn the document. Similarly, if the third party died and a writing was discovered in the third party’s possession saying the document that he had was paid back, the document is considered paid back even if there are no witnesses on the writing. <i>(See later Siman 65 with respect to these laws)</i>. If, however, a writing was produced from the lender’s possession saying that so and so’s document was paid back, it is treated as a joke, even if it was written in the lender’s handwriting. <i>(The plaintiff must pay the expenses of the third party). (Hagahos Mordechai)</i>",
            "2. If witnesses contradicted the third party and said this was not the condition you were made a third party over, the witnesses would be believed. When is this true? Where the third party says, “on this and this day the third-party-item was handed over to me with such and such condition,” and the witnesses contradict him. If, however, he simply says this is the condition on the item which was given to me, he would be believed, even if the witnesses say that there was no such condition when it was handed over because the parties may have come to the third party later and made the condition after it was handed over. Even if the third party does not make this claim, we make the claim for him so that he will not be contradicted by witnesses. <i>RAMA: With respect to a third party, there is no distinction between a case where both parties gave it to him or just the lender gave it to him to be a third party. (Beis Yosef in the name of Teshuvos HaRashba)</i>",
            "3. The third party should only give over the item in court and explain the terms of the handing over to the third party because a disagreement may arise among them and when the item is produced by the third party he will only be believed like a solo witness [version of the Sma]. Therefore, the court must write and sign the details. <i>RAMA: This - that the third party is believed like a solo witness even though the item is not his possession - is only where the parties have removed themselves from him and do not have any complaints against him. If, however, they have complaints with respect to the handing over of the item, the third party now has a stake in the matter and has no believability at all. The same applies if the third party was related or otherwise disqualified. (Tur)</i>",
            "4. If a document is produced by a third party and the borrower claims that the document is forged or was paid back and they cannot verify the witnesses’ signatures, the third party is not believed, even if he testified that the lender and borrower gave it to him and told him such and such amount was remaining in the document that was required to be paid back.",
            "5. If a document was given over to a third party so that the borrower would pay back by such and such date and the time has passed and the borrower claims he paid back in time or the borrower died, we assume the document has not been paid back and the third party will return the document to the lender. If the borrower had died, the lender can only collect with an oath as is the rule for anyone who comes to collect from orphans. If one obligated himself to another in a document with a kinyan and the obligated party deposited the document with another and died, the third party should not give the document to the lender nor return it to the borrower’s inheritors.",
            "6. If a third party was created via a messenger, such as where the borrower came with another who had a collateral or document in his possession and that other person tells the third party that the lender made him a messenger to bring this to you and hand it over on such and such condition, and the third party accepted the item and the lender later comes and contradicts the messengership and says he never made this individual a messenger for this matter, the third party can do what the messenger told him to. <i>RAMA: If the lender does not contradict the messengership, but the third party does not want to accept it and the item remains in the possession of the messenger, the messenger does not have the status of a third party but that of a messenger and he must return the item to the party that gave it. (Beis Yosef in the name of Teshuvos HaRashba) The third party must always comply with the terms of the handing-over, even if one of the parties later has a claim on it. How so? If Reuven agreed with Shimon, who owed him money, on a (payback) date and deposited the document with Levi on the condition that if Shimon does not pay back by a certain date then Levi will return the document and be able to collect everything in one shot and Shimon did not pay by the prescribed time, Levi must return the document even if he knows that Shimon has claims on this because he is not a judge- just a third party. Therefore, he must return the document to Reuven and before he produces it he should describe in front of witnesses how the document came to him and what the conditions were. The witnesses will write and sign the details and provide it to the third party who will give it to Shimon, and Shimon can now claim what he wants. (Tur in the name of Teshuvos HaRosh, Klal 105, Seif 6) And therefore, any third party who returns a document should not be concerned that he acted improperly or that he was not an expert in the laws of a third party unless there was some other negative factor.

If a woman was transacting within the home or a guardian was appointed on the homeowner’s properties and the homeowner died and the woman or guardian knows that the homeowner was in possession of other’s properties that was now in their possession and they know who it belongs to, the woman and guardian must return each one of their properties.

The lender may collect without an oath if the document contains a believability clause. If the borrower later brings a claim that the lender took the money illegally, the lender would take a heses oath and be exempt. If the document does not contain a believability clause, the lender may only collect with an oath. If the borrower did not personally pay back but sent the money via a messenger, the messenger is required to pay back the borrower that sent him, whether the borrower had said to take the document  <i>(And see later Siman 130, Seif 5)</i>and then give the money or give the money and then take the document. <i>(Ibid.) RAMA: There are those that say that since the messenger is required to pay, the lender cannot hold on to the money if he says the borrower owes him for something else, unless the lender claims the messenger gave it to him for that other debt. There are those that disagree and hold that the lender may claim the borrower owes him for something else in all cases. (Mordechai, Perek 'HaKotev Shtei Hedeyot') Similarly, if one gave a deposit to another, and the guardian says that the deposited item belongs to a third party who owes the guardian money and the guardian claims that such third party gave the depositor the item as a messenger, the guardian has the right to claim up to the value of the item with a migu that he returned the item, notwithstanding the fact that the depositor will need to reimburse the third party. If, however, he says that the depositor did not mention the third party and simply deposited the item with him but the guardian claims that the item really belongs to the third party, the guardian cannot hold on to the item since we cannot prove that the third party owed the guardian money. (Rivash, Siman 293) There are those that say this is only where the item came to the guardian as a deposit. If, however, he grabbed it from the depositor and he has a migu, the guardian can say that the owner of the item owed him money and the depositor would be liable to pay the owner because he was negligent. (Beis Yosef, end of Siman 84 in the name of the Ritva; and the Ritva writes more in Perek HaKotev, see there)</i> If, however, the borrower did not mention that the messenger should take the document, the messenger would be exempt <i> since the borrower did not tell the messenger to give the money in front of witnesses.

If the borrower claims he paid back in front of so and so and so and so and those individuals come and testify that he paid back but did not mention the document, and the lender responds that it was a different loan that the borrower paid him back for, the document is void. <i>RAMA: There are those that say that the document is not completely void and if the lender were to grab the money we would not take it away from him. (Tur, in the name of the Rosh and the R\"an) This seems to me to be the primary ruling. </i> When is this true? When the witnesses testify that the borrower gave the money to the lender as repayment. If, however, they saw the borrower gave the money but did not know if it was for repayment, a deposit or a gift and the lender says the payment never occurred, the lender has been established as a liar and the document is void. If the lender says the repayment was for a different debt, he would be believed and he would swear and collect what is in the document because he was not paid back in front of witnesses and since he could have said the money was a gift he is believed to say it was repayment for a separate debt. <i>RAMA: There are those that disagree and say that even in such a case the document has been weakened. (Tur, in the name of Rabbeinu Tam and the Rosh; and so writes the Rav the Magid in the name of the Ramban; and so write the R\"an) And this seems to me to be the primary ruling because the burden of proof is on the party taking away the money. This is all where the money was given in front of two witnesses. If, however, it was given in front of a solo witness, we do not say the document was been weakened.

There are those that write that even if there are no witnesses that the borrower repaid from the ox, the borrower can take a heses oath that he paid back. <i>(The primary view is the first opinion).

With respect to real property that the borrower purchased after he borrowed from this lender that he later sold or gave away, however, the lender may not collect such land. If the document states that the borrower is mortgaging properties that he has already purchased and those that he will purchase in the future, the lender may also collect from them. There is no security, however, on movable items, even those that the borrower had at the time he borrowed, which for the time being he has sold or given away, and the lender may not collect from them. If the document states, “the borrower is mortgaging the movable items that the borrower has via his real property and it is not an asmachta nor is it the outline of the document”- see later Simans 113 and 202 – then the lender may collect from movable items that he had at the time he borrowed just as the lender may collect from the real property. If the document states, “the borrower is mortgaging the movable items via the real property that he currently owns and that he will own in the future and it is not an asmachta nor is it the outline of the document,” the lender may even collect movable items that the borrower purchased subsequent to the loan which he later sold or gave away just as he may collect from real property. This is all the law under the Talmud. Today, although we have the custom to write in all documents that the borrower is mortgaging movable items via real property, the custom is not to collect from movable times which the borrower sold, gave away or gave as collateral because of a “market regulation.” Even under this custom, if the borrower had a loan document on a third party which he sold, the lender may collect from that loan because the “market regulation” is not applicable considering this is an uncommon case. Similarly, if the borrower gave away all his properties to a third party and did not retain anything for himself, it is clear circumstantial evidence that he did it just to avoid the debt and the “market regulation” is inapplicable. See later 99:6.",

If one obligated himself to an unspecified amount, such as where he obligated himself to support or clothe his friend for five years <i>(or where there is no set amount of years) (Beis Yosef, in the name of the Rashba)</i>, the Rambam is of the opinion that he is not obligated, even if a kinyan was made. All those that came after the Rambam disagreed with him and said that he would be obligated and this is how we rule. See later at the end of Siman 207.",
            "3. If one obligated himself to support his friend and the giver wants to provide fruit whereas the recipient demands money, the recipient is in the right. If the giver explicitly conditioned to support the recipient on the giver’s table and the recipient does not want to eat with him, the giver only is required to give him based on the cost of having the recipient eat in the giver’s home. <i>RAMA: If, however, the hold-up is not coming from the one being supported but from the obligated party, the obligated party must give the complete cost of the food. (Beis Yosef, in the name of the Ritva) If the recipient gets sick, the giver does not have to pay his medical expenses and must only pay the value of the food that the recipient received while healthy. (Beis Yosef, end of Siman 207 in the name of the Ritva, Perek 'HaNoseh') There are those that say that where one simply agrees to support his friend, the language implies he will support him his entire lifetime or so long as he needs it. (R\"an, Perek Mi She'Achazu; Beis Yosef in the Tur Even HaEzer Siman 114 inb the name of the Rashba) There are those that say that if one simply agrees to support the other or provide him with 100 gold coins for the year, he will be exempt from just one year of his agreement. (Teshuvos HaRosh 26, Siman 24) If one accepts to support his friend based on his prestige, the court will evaluate what the recipient was accustomed to prior to the obligation. (Teshuvos HaRosh, Klal 75; Tur Siman 207) Dress is not included in the category of food unless the giver says he will feed and support because clothing is included in support. (Beis Yosef in the name of the Rashba) If one writes to his friend that he will support him for a set amount of time or give him 100 dinar and he supported him a little bit but then stopped, the giver does not need to provide 100 dinar. Rather, he must reimburse for the difference between the value for the food given and 100 dinar, but no more than 100 dinar, because he certainly did not intend to give 100 dinar unless he did not provide any support. (Beis Yosef, in the name of the Rashba) If Reuven accepts on himself to support Shimon and his wife and began supporting them and Shimon’s wife died, Reuven is exempt from providing her support. Even if Reuven had set up a set amount for the support of Shimon’s wife, he is still exempt from that portion. (Teshuvos HaRashba) </i>",

            "6. If one obligates himself for a matter that is not yet in existence or is not available to him, he is still obligated notwithstanding the fact that one cannot make a kinyan on a matter not yet in existence because that is only with respect to a kinyan made in the language of a sale or gift. Even where one writes a lien on a field, mortgages all of his properties or even gives it as a collateral, it is of no effect. When one uses a language of being obligated however, such as where he says “you are my witnesses that I am obligated to so and so, such and such,” he would be obligated, so long as they made a kinyan from him. If Reuven produces a document with a kinyan against Shimon which says, “because I gave him 100 gold coins and mortgaged all my properties for him to collect from,”<i>( but did not obligate himself personally) (Beis Yosef)</i> and Shimon claims that at the time the document was written against him he did not have the money and a person cannot make a kinyan on something not yet in existence and the gold coins in the document are coins that people generally transact with, the coins cannot be acquired via chalipin [barter]. If that country does not generally transact with those gold coins, they could be acquired via chalipin  - see later 211:6- but they must have been in Shimon’s possession at the time of the kinyan. If it is unknown whether it was in his possession, the plaintiff has the burden of proof. <i>RAMA: If the plaintiff claims with certainty that it was in the defendant’s possession and the defendant denies it, the defendant must swear. (Tur, in the name of the R\"if) The defendant is believed to say he gave it already it with a migu that he could have said it was not in his possession at the time of the loan. However, this is all according to the reasoning of the R\"if and some others. Many others, however, disagree with this and hold that anyone who says 'I gave so and so, such and such', is an admission by a party and has the status of 100 witnesses. We do not investigate how it was given because once he was confessed we assume he gave it in an effective manner and the recipient would acquire it.

            "8. If Reuven produced a document that Shimon borrowed from Levi, Reuven claims that Levi was Reuven’s messenger and Levi just used his own name and Reuven did not object, Shimon claims that he has no privity with Reuven because Reuven does not have a power-of-attorney from Levi, (Tur) Levi admits to Reuven that he was a messenger and Levi’s admission does not cause harm to any others, we would force Shimon to pay Reuven.

If Reuven lent money to Levi and at the time of the loan Reuven tells Levi that the witnesses should write the document in Shimon’s name but give the document to Reuven, and when Reuven makes a claim from Levi at the prescribed time Levi claims that he has no privity, Reuven is in the right. If Reuven makes a claim against Shimon that he should write a sale document on this document that is written in Shimon’s name, we would not force Shimon to do so. Even if Shimon were to agree to write the sale document, he may retract. If, however, Reuven told the borrower at the time of the loan, that he is giving the loan on the condition that you write a document for me in Shimon’s name and when I decide you will replace it with one in my name, we would force the borrower on this point. Even if Reuven did not explain his words and just told the witnesses in front of the borrower that they will write another document for him, we would obligate the borrower to write another document in Reuven’s name. If a document was written in Reuven’s name and at the end before the witnesses’ signature the document states, “this money is from the congregation’s property,” and Reuven claims that since it was written in his name the congregation must have given him this document on money that he had entrusted with them and the congregation contradicts him, the congregation is in the right.",
            "10. If Shimon owed a maneh to Reuven and they compromised to have Shimon create a loan document for Levi of 20 dinar and subsequently Reuven created a waiver document for Shimon on all monetary claims, and Shimon now claims that because it was not Levi who lent him money, but Reuven, and Reuven has waived all monetary claims, this debt is included, Shimon is in the right.",
            "11. If one lends another with a collateral on real property and the lender instructs to write the property in the name of the lender’s minor son, and now the borrower is claiming that the lender has no privity with him, there is no substance in the borrower’s words.",
            "12. If a woman claims on real property that her husband left behind that half of it is from money that she inherited from her father’s home and the documents are written in both of their names, the woman is in the right. If the documents are written exclusively in her name and she claims they’re all hers, they all belong to her."

[Rema: (meaning that it was not the case that) there was not a particular custom in the city or that he said to them \"I hire you according to Torah law and you are obligated to leave from your houses at sunrise and work until nightfall\" (Tur 331:4). (In these cases) on the eve of Shabbat the worker goes home early so he can fill a barrel of water and roast a small fish and light the Shabbat candles (Tur 331:5 based on the Talmud Yerushalmi). If there was no custom in the city but the majority of the men in the city come from an area where there is a custom, we go according to the custom of the city from which they come. If they came from a place where the custom is to work from dawn to dusk to a place where that is not the custom, or the reverse, we go according to the custom of the place in which they were hired (Nemukei Yosef on the beginning of Chapter 7 of Bava Metzia, \"One Who Hires Worker\", based on the Talmud Yerushalmi). Something is not a custom unless it a common practice and has been done many times, however, something which has been done only once or twice is not considered a custom (Rivash siman 475).]",

If, however, the work involves an immediate loss - e.g., he hired the workers to remove flax from the vat, or he hired a donkey to bring flutes for a funeral or for a wedding or the like - neither a worker nor a contractor may retract (a maid or a servant of the employer considered an immediate loss since the employer is not able to do the work himself, therefore he suffers a loss) unless he is held back by forces beyond his control -e.g., he became ill (him or his wife or his children) or he heard that a close relative died. (However the employer does not have to pay the full wage, but only for their work, they {the workers} have the upper hand. If the employer re-employees the workers after the circumstance is over without specifying anything, and they come back to do their job then he pays them in full and does not deduct anything. If not, then the employer deducts all the sick or unfortunate days, even though he didn't back out. The same ruling is for a teacher who fell ill, you deduct the sick days. However if the worker or teacher already received their payment then some say that he does not have to return. A teacher who backs out is considered 'immediate loss' the same applies to a scribe who accepted to write a book and backed out in the middle, is considered 'immediate loss'. Teachers are classified like other workers who need to act as is customary to start and to finish work, as explained in Siman 331. He is prohibited from doing other work while he is teaching or to stay up at night excessively or to minimize or add in food, and whoever changes has the 'lower hand' and is removed. A teacher who was hired for a set period of time has the laws of a worker. If he was hired to teach a book or half a book then he has the laws of a contractor, see Siman 33, 34 &amp; 35 regarding the laws of a teacher.) If the worker is not held back by forces beyond his control, and he retracts, the owner may hire others on their account or deceive them. (If he found other workers to hire and he deceived the original workers then he has to pay them based on his last agreement.) What is meant by deceiving them? He tells them: \"I agreed to pay you a sela; take two so that you will complete your work.\" Afterwards, he is not required to give them anything more than he originally agreed. Moreover, even if he gave them two, he can compel them to return the additional amount. (A volunteer can back out, even if it causes 'immediate loss'.)",

Whatever he must add to pay these later workers beyond the amount the first workers agreed upon, he may take from the first workers. To what extent are the first workers responsible? For their entire wage. Moreover, if they have money that is in the employer's possession, the employer can use that money to hire workers to complete their work until he pays each worker 40 or 50 zuz a day although he originally hired the worker at three or four zuz. (If the employer does not hire other worker's on the expense of the first workers, then they are not responsible to pay for the damage. Some say, be is nly allowed to hire new workers on the previous ones expense, up to 40 or 50 zuz, is only if the employer has their tools, but nothing else. The limit of 40 or 5 zuz only applies to an 'immediate loss' that is not monetary like a teacher or similar. If the loss is monetary then the workers have to cover the cost of all of the damage.)",

How so? If he knew this animal was robbed, he is prohibited from riding on it or plowing with it. If the robber robbed a house or field, one is prohibited from passing through it or entering the property in the summer because of the sun or in the rainy season because of the rain. If he lives there he must pay rent to the owner if it was a property generally rented out. If the robber stole palm trees and made a bridge with them, one is prohibited from crossing the bridge.

Even if the king instructed his servants to cut a set amount from each person and they went and cut everything from one person, he is permitted to cross the bridge.

With respect to the what they have in the house or market, but not in the tax-collector’s box, however, that may be combined.

If the tax was set by the king and was a set amount, however- even if the king instructed that the Jew give more than the gentile, it is still considered a set amount for each person- and the king appointed a Jewish collector to collect for him and this person is known as trustworthy and would not add anything to what the king instructed, he is not presumed to be a robber because the law of the government is the law. Moreover, one who evades the tax violates “do not steal” because he has stolen the king’s gift, whether the king was Jewish or a gentile. Similarly, if a Jew acquired the tax from the king, if one evades the tax he is robbing the Jew who acquired the rights to it. There are those who say that even where it is known that the Jew takes more than the set amount, one is still prohibited from evading the set amount, because it is like he is robbing a robber, which is prohibited. If a gentile acquired the tax, however, one is permitted to evade because it is like evading a loan which is permissible where there is no desecration of God’s name.

If the king took a field or courtyard from one of his citizens not in compliance with the laws he set up, he is a robber and if one purchases it from him, the owner may remove him from the property. The general rule is that any general law that the king sets up for everyone, and not just for one person, is not robbery, and if anyone takes property from one person not known to comply with the laws that are not know to all, then it is robbery. If the law was set for just one industry, such as were he made a law that a certain item can be loaned with interest, there are those who say we do not apply the principle of the law of the land is the law because it was not set for everyone. There are those who say we do not apply the principle of the law of the land is the law except with regards to taxes and property-taxes because the king decrees that people can only live on his lands in this fashion. With respect to other matters, however, we would not apply such a principle. There are those who disagree and hold we apply the principle that the law of the land is the law on all matters. Thus, if one lends on collateral, he may sell the collateral after a year because that is the law of the land. This is the primary view, as was discussed above in 356:7.",

Rather, he may consume the fruits and pay the tax until the owner returns because the law of the king is the law, as we have said. Similarly, it is the king’s rule that whomever is discovered in the field must pay the tax for the entire valley and he will collect from the others or that he collect the annual tax from one person.",
            "Paragraph 11- Similarly, if the king decreed that anyone who pays the affixed personal tax on behalf of another, then the person that paid has rights on the person he paid for, and one paid the tax for a poor Jew, the donor may work him more than is typical because the law of the king is the law, but he may not work him like a slave. If a Jew owed a gentile, and the gentile sold the document to a Jew, although he is prohibited from litigating with the other Jews in the presence of gentiles, and although he is coming via a gentile, the Jewish judges would still rule for this Jewish creditor that which the gentile would have profited from the gentile judges because this Jew is coming via the gentile judges, which is the government law. If one marries a woman in a place where they judge with secular law, and his wife dies, the wife’s father or other inheritors cannot say that anyone who gets married does so with the understanding that they will follow local custom and that any matter should be litigated in secular courts so that if she were to die her husband would not inherit her or something similar. The principle of government law does not apply here because we do not say the principle except for something where there is a benefit to the king or it is a regulation for the citizens, but not that they litigate in secular court, because if that were to happen all Jewish laws would become void.

If [the damager] doesn't believe [the lender], he doesn't need to pay other than the value of the paper.  Gloss: This [is true] is there are no witnesses that know how much was written therein, for if there are witnesses, they can rewrite the document, as explained in ~ 41.",

The one who removed [the pillows] must pay [the damages].  So too for all similar cases. Gloss:  Some consider this causal damage and is exempt [in court but responsible by heaven].  Similarly, pushing the coin into the sea and minimizing the coin image are exempt, because they are causal damage. Therefore, even if one threw [another's] vessel from the roof while there were pillows beneath them and he himself removed the pillows, yet he is exempt [in court]. He is not liable for the throw because it wouldn't break through this action. The removal [of the pillows] is but a causal damage.  A scribe that wrote a document and wrote one hundred in place of two hundred, or if one damages another with [bad] advice, or an escrow that handed over a document [to one party] that he should not have handed over, all these are exempt [in court but responsible by heaven].  They are only causal damage.  However, [the damager] is excommunicated until he removes the damage, as in all cases of causal damage.  Some say that all common causal damage must be paid as a penalty.  Therefore, some say, if Reuven sells and item to an idolater, then Shimon says to the idolater that he overpaid [and the idolator keeps the item and the money (see Sha\"ch), Shimon] must pay him.

            "<i><b>Rema</b>: Regarding those guilty of the death penalty in our days, we have no power to give them lashes, exile them, kill them, or beat them. Instead we censure them and distance them from the community (<b>Tur 68</b> from Natronai Gaon). Thus far regarding [strictly Torah] law. However, if the beit din sees a necessity for a preventative measure, it has the authority to institue whatever punishment they see fit (ibid., from the Responsa of the Natronai Gaon), as explained above in Siman 2. This regards those instances involving capital punishment which necessitates a beit din. Cases in which the death penalty can be implemented even without a beit din, are still judged in our days, as will be explained (ibid.).</i> One who pursuses his fellow in order to kill him, and was warned, and continued in his pursuit: Even if the pursuer was a minor, every Jew is commanded to save the pursed, even at the cost of one maiming one of the pursuer's limbs. If it is impossible to save the pursued without killing the pursuer outright, then the pursuer should indeed be killed, even though he has not yet performed the act. <i><b>Rema</b>: (<b>Tur 67</b>) One who \"tunnels [into a house] in order steal\" has this rule of pursuer applied to him, however if it is understood that his only intent is monetary gain, and that he would not kill the owner in a confrontation, then it is forbidden to kill him. See further in the Tur in this paragraph regarding one who endangers the public, such as a Jew who engages in forgery in a land where the authorities take a strict approach to such action, such a person constitutes a \"pursuer\" and it is permitted to turn him over to the authorities (<b>Nimukei Maharam MiRizburg</b>), as explained above in 388:12.</i>"
