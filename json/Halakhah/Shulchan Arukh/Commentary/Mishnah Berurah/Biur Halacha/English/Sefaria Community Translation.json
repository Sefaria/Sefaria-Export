                "So that it is he who 'awakens the dawn' - It is very proper to be careful to say, prior to all three assigned prayers, the \"May It Be Your Will\" thanksgiving prayers; as is explained in chapter תפלת השחר of the Jerusalem Talmud. Prior to שחרית (morning prayers), \"I give thanks before you Hashem, Our G-d, and the G-d of our forefathers, who has taken me out from darkness to light\". And prior to מנחה (afternoon prayers), \"I gives thanks etc. Just like I merited to see the sun in the east, may I merit to see it in the west. Prior to ערבית, (evening prayers), \"May it be your will etc. Just like I was in the darkness and you took me out to light, so too may you [again] take me out from the darkness to the light\". ",
                "This is a great principle of the Torah etc- He who wishes to properly fulfill \"I Place\", should strive to fulfill what is written in the name of the Sefer HaChinuch (and which because of their great belovedness, were cited by many great scholars in their works). The Chinuch (in his introduction and in Chapters 25, 26, 417, 432, and 387) writes as follows: There are six Mitzvos which apply constantly, and which a person fulfills a positive commandment at any moment that he contemplates them. There is no limit to the reward for these Mitzvos. They are as follows:           1) To believe that there is one God in the world who brought forth all that exists and through his desire and will maintains all that currently exists, and [will cause to exist] anything that will exist, throughout time. And [to believe] that he brought us forth from Egypt and gave us the Torah. The above is a Positive Commandment, as is written (Exodus 20:2) \"I am the Lord your God, who has taken you forth from the land of Egypt....\", meaning 'Know and believe that there is a God who supervises the Universe, for he took you forth from Egypt            2) Not to believe in any God besides for Him as it is written (Exodus 20:3) \"You should not have any other Gods before me\". Even if he recognizes that God rules over everything, but it appears to him that he gave a certain angel or constellation control, he still admits to another power and transgress \"There should not be for you another God before Me\". Rather he must believe that God directly supervises the entire Universe and that no creature has the power to do anything without His will. This is why God is called the Power of Powers.             3) [Belief] In His oneness, as it is written, (Deuteronomy 6:4) \"Hear O' Israel, Hashem is our God, Hashem is One\". Meaning, Hear O' Israel - and know that all is with His will and He is our God who supervises the entire Universe, He is Hashem alone - without any aide. ",
                "And he should not be embarrassed - Refer to the Mishna Berurah quoting the Beis Yosef.  Know that the Beis Yosef is only dealing with [a case of]  where he does [an exclusively] personal Mitzvah  and men mock him, for then certainly their is no thoughtful assumption to mock them, nor to quarrel with them. However, if he is in a situation where there are heretics who rise against the Torah, and want to pass certain rules in matters of the city, and through this, detach the public from the will of Hashem, and, if one would try to negotiate peacefully, they wouldn't listen to his words- the Beis Yosef wasn't speaking about an example like this at all. Rather, it is a Mitzvah to hate them and to quarrel with them and to contradict their advice in whatever way one is able. As King David said in the verse, \"For indeed, those who hate you, O Hashem, I hate them, and with those who rise up against you I quarrel! With the utmost hatred, I hate them....\"(Psalms 139, 21)."

They are: Tosfos and the Rosh that while it stands the condition doesn't help, when it is destroyed it does.  Rashi and the Ohr Zaruah that even while standing it helps.  The Ramban, the Ran, and the Rashba hold that even in it's destruction it doesn't help unless it is a difficult situation, but in such a situation, even while standing it helps.  [Difficult situation is like needing to feed poor people at that time or let them sleep there].  Even though the Michabeir took the opinion that while standing it doesn't help, in any case, it seems from the Taz that you could rely on the Ramban that even while it stands the condition helps.  And the law is with him since that is also the opinion of the Ran and the Rashba and you can also combine them with the opinion of Rashi and the Ohr Zarua that hold even while it stands it helps.  You should also know that even according to Rashi and the Ohr Zarua that it helps even while it is standing, for full fledged frivolity like scoffing and joking etc, it is obvious that it doesn't help as the Gemara says explicitly.  See there that it says even calculations are forbidden since those are also called frivolity."

                "\"It is a good custom to bring etc.\"  Behold it certainly is that the intention of the author [R' Yosef Karo] is specifically for minors who have reached the age of education, for the smallest of minors just confuse, as the Magen Avraham [R. Abraham Gombiner] wrote, and, if so, how is this good custom not appropriate as a law obligating us to teach them in the chanting of the Megillah or, at least, listening? And it appears correct to me, and maybe in this one would fulfill their obligation if they were to read in front of others in their home, but, in order to publicize the miracle the most, it is a custom to bring them to the study hall so that they can hear in the community, in order to educate them that, even in their age of majority, they will listen in the community."
