                "[1] The reason as brought by the Ran and the secondary opinion in the Mordechai is to soften the meat in order to allow for easy removal of the blood by the salt. The Mordechai writes that the reason is in order to remove any dirt which may be on the meat because otherwise the salt will simply fill up with blood and not do its job of removing the blood. The Hagos Maimoni is of the opinion that it is to remove the blood that is on the surface of the meat, for otherwise the salt will simply fill up with it and not perform its job of removing the blood that is inside the meat. ",
                "[2] This is of course if the butcher performed a thorough rinsing as is required, such as by soaking the meat in a vessel. If so, then you need not wash it at home. However, a mere spraying is not acceptable even post facto. If we know the butcher rinsed the meat, we can assume it was done properly. ",
                "[3] Only if cut with a knife will you have to go back and re-wash, because through the pressure of a knife, blood is brought up to the surface. However, according to the Ran who holds the reason for the washing is to soften the meat, it would make no difference how many cuts are made, and re-washing would not be required. However, halacha follows the opinion that the rinsing is due to blood, therefore re-washing will be required even post facto. ",
                "[4] Re-washing is required only if the hooves were sliced off, however if they were not cut, they are as any other part of the meat, and no special washing is required. ",
                "[5] However a small rinsing is insufficient, and one is required to go back and properly rinse the meat. However if the meat has already been salted after such a small rinsing, it is acceptable post facto. ",
                "[6] However do not let the meat completely dry for then the salt will not stick to the meat or melt at ail. ",
                "[7] According to the halacha it would be permissible to use the vessel with other things, because the vessel doesn’t absorb anything since the meat does not soak for twenty four hours, and it is used for cold items. However we customarily refrain from doing so due to blood that might be stuck to the vessel. ",
                "[8] This is due to the rule that something soaked for twenty four hours, is as if it was cooked. (Kavush K’mevushal) ",
                "[9] Later it is explained that it is even forbidden to roast this meat. If there was a sixty ratio of water against the meat, it may even be cooked. ",
                "[10] The reason we permit it is because the second meat will not be in the vessel for a twenty four hour period. Even if it was soaked for twenty four hours, any taste released will be a stale one thereby not causing the meat to be forbidden. ",
                "[11] The Maharshal writes that meat that was frozen may not be salted until it is defrosted. Meat that was salted but frozen before the end of the required salting period should be re-salted when it melts. If it wasn’t re-salted but it did undergo the required salting time after having thawed and it was subsequently cooked - it is permitted, post facto. "

                "[13] This is referring to the case of cooking , however it is permissible to roast it if it hadn’t sat in the salt for the entire time requirement. ",
                "[14] This is because according to the view that the meat must be soft, surely a minimal rinsing can not accomplish that. However according to the view that it is for blood that is on the surface such a rinsing can indeed accomplish that. Even if it wasn’t cooked yet, it seems that this minimal rinsing is sufficient, and one is not required to go back and re-wash/re-salt. ",
                "[15] This is surprising because there is no piece of meat that can be sixty times the size of the blood on it. However if you do have such a piece, it would be fine. ",

                "[21] The implication is that if the meat has already been cooked it is forbidden, and nothing can be done. However if it wasn’t cooked yet, then in a case of great loss we can permit the meat by going back and salting the other side within twenty four hours. ",
                "[22] The explanation is that once it is in the process of releasing blood, it will also release anything that it possibly absorbed from the other side. This is referring to a case where the meat wasn’t washed off. However the pores on meat which has been washed off become immediately closed and further slating won’t help. ",

                "[28] It seems that the Rema is not arguing with the Mechaber, and is simply ruling that a spraying or wiping of the meat followed by two  intensive rinsings would be acceptable. Regarding the Rema’s second  view of requiring three rinsings - it is because the large quantity of water  used will nullify the intensity of the tzir and an initial wiping/spraying would  not be needed. ",
                "[29] Post facto, if one only rinsed off the meat once and then cooked  it, it is acceptable,  ",
                "[30] This is based on the Gemara in Masechet Chullin, daf 33, that says if one  slaughtered an animal and blood did not come out, then one may eat the meat  with hands that are tamay. Thisis because the meat is not susceptible to tuma  due to the fact that blood did not come out. Tosafos asks: Shouldn't the meat  become susceptible to tuma when one rinsed it out in the water'? The two  answers given are the a) the meat was to be roasted or D) it was rinsed in fruit  juice. Therefore it seems that fruit juice would be permissible even for the  preliminary washing, in contradiction to the Rema that holds it would be  permissible only for the washing after salting.   "

                "[33] What is meant is that since the vessel is clean it won’t matter if it is  treif or dairy even if there is presently no water in the vessel. However, if  the vessel is dirty the meat would be forbidden unless there was at least a little water in the vessel. It seems from the Rema that all this is true even if  the vessel is a ben-yomo. because salt won’t bring out absorbed taste.   "

The rules of chana\"n can not be applied here,  because they apply only to situations of milk and meat. You also need  sixty against the blood on the meat in addition to the salt. ",
                "[35] We can’t say that one must have sixty against this entire piece in  question, because the rules of chana\"n don’t apply here, and because  blood is not considered an issur davuk because salt dissolves once placed  into a liquid. Everyone follows the opinion of the Rema here.  ",

However, if it was cooked, we will assume that all  blood that could have come out, did indeed came out during the roasting and that  no more will come out during the cooking. The case of liver is different, in which it  may be even initially cooked after having being roasted since salting is not  adequate for liver and roasting is mandatory, therefore we assume that all blood  that would have come out has indeed been expelled. Over here though, the  blood has dried up within the meat, and it could be that the roasting did not get all  the blood out, therefore it should not be cooked even after being roasted.  ",

                "[80] The reason some forbid it is because the tzir coming from the meat after the  required salting time is absorbed into the meat because it is still considered  roseiach, however it is only absorbed through the klipah. Those who forbid it,  forbid it immediately. It seems though that if the meat was washed once before  being put into a vessel that had no holes, the meat is permitted even if it fills with  tzir, for everyone agrees that post facto one washing suffices.

The Maharshal argues on the  Rema and forbids anything in the tzir and even a klipah above it. If there is a sixty  to one ratio of meat and tzir it is permitted, however what is in the tzir does not  combine to nullify for blood does not flow upwards.  ",
                "[82] A vessel used to salt meat is forbidden to the depth of a klipah, however,  here it appears that the vessel is forbidden because a vessel can not be peeled of  its klipah, for example: if a lot of tzir has been absorbed into it, or it is an  earthenware vessel which is entirely forbidden.  ",
                "[83] From the words of the Rema it seems that when the dairy vessel is not dirty  with dairy residue, it is permitted even if it was used that day since we rule that  salt does not bring out taste that is absorbed in a vessel. The Rema forbids the  meat since there is probably not a sixty ration against the residue.  ",

                "[85] Considering that everyone agrees that the meat must be washed off after  salting, what then is the new insight that the Mechaber is trying to teach over  here? One must then say that for sure the reason for washing is to remove salt  and dirt, therefore if one sliced the meat on all sides in such a way that there is  now no salt on the meat it would be permissible to eat it without washing.  However, according to those who require the washing because the tzir is  considered as blood, one must always wash it first no matter what in order to  close up the pores.  ",
                "[86] This is only according to the view of the one who forbids it. However,  according to what the Mechaber ruled that ideally one must be careful but post  facto it is permitted, it emerges that initially one is forbidden to cut it, but if it was  cut the knife doesn’t need kashering.  ",
                "[87] Even if there are indentations in the knife, thereby not allowing for any liquid  to flow off, nevertheless it is permitted because the motions of the knife release  anything on it surface.  ",
                "[88] For the blood flows, and is not absorbed into the knife. This is for a vessel in  that we can say that the blood will flow, however for all other vessels there is  some absorption via the salt.  ",
                "[89] It seems that it is even initially permitted to cut with this knife, but afterwards  the knife must be washed, and one will usually wash a knife before the next  usage anyways so there is no need to worry. One may also be lenient in light of  the fact that no prohibitions are involved once it has gone through the required  salting time according to most poskim. However, it is initially forbidden to cut meat  with a non-kosher knife, but post facto one need not worry,  ",

This is difficult to understand for in the case of non-kosher meat  that is not salty, touching kosher meat that is salty, the Mechaber brings the  opinion that forbids them! The answer is that nevertheless, the non-salted one is  not considered roseiach enough to release blood for here the only problem is  because of blood that the poultry releases and may be absorbed in the fish. This  is not the case over there where it releases non-kosher tzir which is forbidden.",

If it did not then it is forbidden even post facto. The Maharshal and Bach  ruled that our case can even be dealing with meat that did not undergo a primary  washing, for the tzir only has the strength to absorb itself into the meat but not the  blood upon it.

It is because over there we are dealing with a different case such  as kosher and non-kosher fish that was soaked together. However regarding  meat, a whole day is required. Another possibility is because here we are dealing  with a case of a vessel with holes, in which any other way would make it  prohibited even post facto even according to the Rema. But in a vessel with holes  all would agree that it would require a full day. This requires further study.",
                "[37] This is the view of the Maharshal. Even though in the case of meat salted on  top of other meat that was already salted, one need not go back and re-salt it  because we say that as long as it expels its tzir it won’t absorb and blood, it is not  the same in a case where it fell into tzir. The Maharshal holds that re-washing  and re-salting it won’t help. However, according to the Rema one should go back  and re-wash and re-salt it, and if it was cooked without a second washing one can  permit it in a case of great loss. According to everyone, if the meat was washed  off, thus closing it's pores, and then falls into tzir, a second washing and salting  won’t help, for now it absorbs the tzir   ",
                "[38] The reason is because during the first twelve hours we rule that it is releasing  tzir even if it is not a case of great loss. So we can permit it in a case of great loss and say that as it expels its tzir it will expel blood as well. However, after twelve  hours it is forbidden even in a case of great loss.  ",
                "[39] This washing requires great caution that it not be washed thoroughly, rather  just enough to remove any dirt on its surface. If one is not careful, the pores will  close since it is after the required salting time, We do not follow the Bach who  rules that even a light washing will close its pores.  ",
                "[40] That is if it has room to flow, as in a vessel with holes. If it doesn’t have  where to flow then even within the required salting period it is forbidden and  another salting will not help. Even if the tzir has nowhere to flow, what protrudes  from the tzir is nevertheless permitted, and what is in the tzir is forbidden.  ",
                "[41] Even the Rashal would agree over here that as it releases its own blood, it  will release other blood, since it did not sit for the required salting period. Even if it  was washed before it fell into the tzir, the pores don’t close because it hasn’t gone  through the required salting period. ",
                "[42] The Maharshal writes that even initially one need not re-wash it. Even those  who want to be stringent need only pour a little water over it, for it already  underwent the primary washing. The Rema would hold like this as well.  ",
                "[43] It is not similar to meat that was salted without a primary washing, for only  regarding blood (b'eyn) do we say this since it is thick, but regarding tzir, which is  similar to blood, we can say “as it absorbed, so will it release.”  ",
                "[44] However, after the required salting period it can be permitted in a case of a  great loss or for a meal in honour of a mitzva, but if not, we rule that it is roseiach  even after the required salting period,   ",
                "[45] The reason is because blood does not flow upwards. Even the part that is in  the fatty tzir is permitted, and we don’t say that it flows upwards. One should just  remove the klipah from what is sticking out of the tzir.  ",
                "[46] The view of the Rema should be followed that if it went through the required  salting period and it is not a case of great loss, or if it is after twelve hours, it is  forbidden and a second salting will not help even if a great loss is involved.  Anything in the tzir becomes immediately forbidden.  ",
                "[47] It seems that we are dealing with a case of meat that fell onto the ground  before the passage of the required salting time. Nevertheless, one need not be  more stringent than to remove the klipah from the place where it touched the  ground in the tzir. This is because we are unsure if the ground is considered to  be a vessel with holes and may then be rectified with another salting, or if is  considered a vessel without holes in which a second salting will not help.  Furthermore, if meat that had already expelled all its blood fell into tzir that is on  the ground, in which case it would absorb the tzir even in a vessel with holes, it  therefore becomes forbidden. However, meat that wasn’t salted at all is permitted  even if it fell into a vessel without holes because tzir can’t flow from place to  place.  ",
                "[48] A salting will rectify it, and it will release it. Only meat that is in the process of  being salted that fell into a vessel without holes is forbidden immediately.  However this does not apply to meat that was never salted and then became  mixed with salty pieces in a vessel without holes which can be made permissible  by salting it, ",
                "[49] Even though we ruled stringently regarding meat that fell into tzir that is on  the ground as a precautionary measure (and of doubt) so that one will not come  to be lenient in a case of meat that fell into blood that is on the ground. This is not  the case here, rather the doubt is regarding the tzir, that it might not be present.   ",

The practical difference is that if the head was salted with meat after It had released all its blood and tzir, thereby not allowing for us to say “as it absorbed, so will it release”, even so it is permitted for it did not absorb since the bone is acting as a barrier.
