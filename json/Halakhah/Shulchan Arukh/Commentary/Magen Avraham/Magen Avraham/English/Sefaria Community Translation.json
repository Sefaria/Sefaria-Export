                "From this language we learn that even if he cannot eat, for example he has a weak constitution, still since others his age can eat, we need to distance ourselves (from the extriment to read shema). This requires analysis as we have not found this in any posek, and in addition the gemara indicates that if he was older, even though he cannot eat a kazayit in the alloted time of a Peras, we still need to distance ourselves from his excrement. This implies that for a child if he cannot eat it then it would be permissible (to say shema). Therefore it appears to me that the law is that if someone his age can eat, the assumption is he can also. And if we know that he cannot because he is weak etc, even if he is 3 or 4 years old we don't need to distance ourselves. And if he was an adult, even if he cannot eat, we still need to distance ourselves.  The Bach adds that we also don't distance ourselves from (extrement) of a minor if we know that that specific extrement did not come from grain, for example he hasn't eaten grain for days like Rashi writes. The poskim write like this. And if we know he has never eaten grain, even if he is a few years old, you don't need to distance. Rashi writes that all 5 grains are called dagan and the feces smells. In yoreh death 265:8 it seems that it is better to distance oneself from extrement, even of a minor, even if he is 8 days. The Maharshal says it is not proper to read Shema next to a baby as it is probably dirty from garbage. End of his words. It seems to me for a different reason, that they don't clean themselves properly, and feces around the anus, even though it is covered is forbidden (to read by it). Look at siman 76:6"

The Kesef Mishna writes (9:4) if one wants he can just continue standing where he ended up (after taking the steps back) and not take steps forward. However according to the one explanation of the three steps brought in the Beis Yosef you really need 6 steps (and we include the steps you take forward). Therefore according to this opinion one must take three steps forwards. For this reason were careful not to have people pass infront of others when there standing in there place (after taking three steps back) to not interrupt between the six steps (Lechem Chamudos). See siman 95 sif 1 (where the Rama brings an opinion that need to take three steps forward before Shemoneh eshrei aswell. If so you already have 6 steps, 3 before shemona esrie and 3 after). And also see siman 124 (sif 1 brings from the kesavim to take 3 steps forward at kedusha and wait there until tachanun) and siman 131 sif 2 (where he says if one doesn't have a seat where he took 3 steps to then should take the steps back to get to his seat to sit)."

                "Either way, one is not allowed to pour hot water into the wine since one is focused on being precise and that would be too much of a loss of focus (tosfot 106b, and Bach). This law applies to anything similar to this.  It is also written there in the name of Rabeinu Tam that it is forbidden to do these on a week day as one my lose focus and leave to do other things, but on the Shabbat when the table is all set, one can wash hands and then make kiddush. The same law applies to making havdala and then eating. See what is written in siman 174",
                "The Shela writes that each day, before washing for bread, a person should give a prayer for the food he receives from G-d, and if he forgot to say this prayer until after he washed he is allowed to say it before saying the beracha on bread. And the world has a custom to say tehillim 23 between washing and hamotzi (see Siman 235:2 - where the Rema says that one doesn't break within the meal but one does break before hamotzi to say Shema and other prayers that were missed).  The Rashal writes that the host should let the greatest man wash last (to allow him to talk until the end/or to not cause him to pause for too long..), but if he was asked first to wash and he chooses to wait till later, this is a transgressions since he is causing others to have a break, rather he should wash and sit down and not speak, and if they ask him a dvar tora he is permitted to stop. End of words of Rashal. See Sman 167:5 (where the SA lists thing that should be at the table in preparation for the beracha). And the Bach writes that it is forbidden to speak, even with divrei Torah, and even the sitting down is a hefsek as the Rema writes (ie, waiting more than 22 amot). With this in mind, a great man can choose not to wash first since we are more concerned when the person saying the beracha has to wait, as opposed to those that are listening. If the guests see that it is taking too long, they can take a piece of bread and recite the blessings for themselves ",
                "The tosfot in Sota prove this point from the case of a Metzora. A metzora was not able to do semicha on the sacrifice immediately before the slaughter as they were not allowed to enter the Azara. What they did was do semicha outside the entrance gates (Nikanor gates) and then the kohanim to walk the animal to the Mizbeach for the sacrifice. The distance between the gate and the alter is 22 amot and we see it was not a hefsek (the semicha needs to be just before the sacrifice). But I have a problem. This braita is brought in zevachim 33a to argue prove that a small amount that enters is not considered entering until the entire person enters (otherwise, why doesn't the metzora put his hand inside for smicha and then do shchita right there at the entrance). This question is origonally based on the assumption that we are talking about chachamim that you can shecht anywhere in the Azara, and then concludes that it is according to R Yehuda that only by the mizbeach is fine.  But I have an issue, let us just say...... (not sure), rather we must conclude that if you move from one place to another (ie the 22 amot) it should be a hefsek. Even small amount of walking. That is how the mishne in Middot (end of ch2)  seems to imply that in the place of smicha you need shchita. This needs analysis. (Look at siman 8,13 where the SA says that if you make a blessing in your home on tzitzit and then walk to shul you need another blessing for tallis as the walk is a hefsek. Look also at Siman 181:6 about waiting after mayim achronim). And it requires analysis on what it says in Yora Deah 19 where the psak is (if the slaughter house is messy) to say a bracha outside of the slaughterhouse at a distance of 4 Amon as it needs to be in its place (even bracha achrona 184 needs to be in its place. All the more so the first bracha. I looked at the Aguda in chulin (where it says 4 amot) and the 4 amot seem to be in the same house. This is what is mentioned in Shabbos \"someone who wants to drink in the washhouse, should bless in the outside room since it is like a corner to a corner\". But according to tosfot even corner to corner would be a hefsek and this is the prevailing opinion since it is no less that speaking. Therefore the position of the Rema in Yore Dea needs further analysis. "

                "I have a difficulty. How can we say on Shavuot that it is \"the day of the giving of our Torah\"?! Do we not conclude like R. Yose (Shabbat 86b) that the Torah was given on the 7th of Sivan? After all, we do conclude that separation from sexual intercourse [of man and wife, in regard to certain laws of Tumah] requires six half-days, as is written in Yore Deah 196. [R. Yose's opinion -- that the Torah was given on the 7th of Sivan -- is based on a need for husband and wife to separate a full three days. Since the Halakha today requires a 3 days for this particular separation, presumably R. Yose is correct about the date of Revelation.] (And I believe I've seen this question before in some Poseik's writings.)  But in our calendar, Shavuot is always on the 6th of Sivan!     In truth, the Rambam rules in the Laws of Avot haTumah Ch. 5, that we require only three half-days [of separation]. The Kesef Mishna comments there that in the Talmudic text of the Rambam and the Rashba, the Sages only require three half-days, and that the Rambam rules according to them. See there. If so, our custom is in line with the Rambam. What is written in Yoreh Deah, supporting R. Yose, is but stringency [chumra; it is the advised practice, but not the actual letter of the law].       A further difficulty: the Torah was given on the 51st day of their counting! For they left Egypt on the fifth of the week (Wednesday night / Thursday) and the Torah was given on a Shabbat. In this regard, the [book] HaAsarah Maamarot already answered, that it is meant to hint at the Second Day of Yom Tov of the Exiles. In fact, it’s possible that that’s the reason why Moshe added a day of his own accord, but this isn’t the place to discuss it.        ........ It says in the Zohar that the original pious ones would be awake all the night working in Torah.  And already most of those who learn do this.  It's possible to give a reason for this according to its simple understanding, that Israel slept all the night, and the Holy One Blessed be He had to wake them, as the midrash says.  Therefore, we need to fix this. ",

                "<strong>A Man and His Wife.</strong> Such is apparent from the beginning of Arakhin [Arakhin 3b] where they say that priests are exempt from the Sukkah during the <i>Avodah</i>, see there. And this requires further study, for in Sukkah 28b: Since you might have thought, sit such as you dwell, since one dwells husband and wife, so too Sukkah must be husband and wife, so you have learned that women are exempt. And it should be said, that anyway the husband is not obligated in the Sukkah but where he can dwell there with his wife, and if not, he is <i>Mitzta'er</i> (discomforted) and is exempt from sleeping there, and such wrote the Shela\"h, see there. But anyway, this is still difficult, since if he made the Sukkah in a place where he cannot sleep, he has not fulfilled his obligation [when he sits in it], as is written in the Rem\"a in Shulchan Arukh, Orach Chayyim 640:14, and if so, if he does not have a Sukkah which is isolated [so that he can sleep there with his wife modestly] he has not fulfilled his obligation at all [even when he eats therein], and another difficulty is that in the Gemara we say that \"all of Israel are fit to sit in one Sukkah\", see there. And it must be said that since he can sleep there alone, the Sukkah is valid, for it is a residence, but he is anyway exempt, for he is considered discomforted."
