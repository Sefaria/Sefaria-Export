                "16. Some say he is not definitively a mamzer. The first opinion is the Rambam but the \"some say\" is the opinion of the Hilchot Gedolot for we say maybe via a divine name he came here, similar to the story with the father of Shmuel, although [in a case] where he made something conditional on going up to the heavens we treat is a a condition that is impossible to fulfill even though he could technically go up via a divine name as it is says in the Tosefta, but [this is different] because to declare a child fit is different. And according to this view the child is fit as the Rosh wrote, and not as the Prisha who wrote that the child is a safek mamzer. The Rosh and the Tur wrote that that we attribute his arrival to be via a divine name even if she does not concur. However, Tosafot at the end of Kiddushin [73a] wrote that we don't attribute him coming via a divine name unless she confirmed that he came [via a divine name]. The Beit Yosef at the end of Cap. #179 recorded a responsum, according to the responsum one can say that Maimonides does not disagree with the Hilchot Gedolot, rather the Hilchot Gedolot is discussing a case where the husband is not in our presence and the Rambam is discussing a case where the husband is in our presence and and is not saying that he came [and visited his wife discreetly]. The Mehaber is of the view that the Rambam holds that the offspring is always a mamzer even when the husband is not here [in our presence] but if he is here and says that he did not come [and visit his wife discreetly]  then the offspring is a \"certain mamzer\" for the husband is believed to says that the he is not his son, and if the husband is present and says he visited and he denies it, the Helkat Mehokek wrote that he is believed to declare the child fit and some say the Rambam would concur in this case but in a practical case it would require further study.

                "17 [Rem\"a: During the twelve months, however, there is no concern, because we can say that this was a very long] gestation. However Tosafor Niddah 38[a] wrote that we do not accept [the explanation of a long] gestation and so too the Aguda explained and see the Makarik #103.",
                "18 [but if we did see] something distasteful we do not say that it was a long gestation[, and we are concerned for the offspring]. But she continues to have a \"fit\" status and the Helkat Mehokek wrote that if she gave birth in the tenth month then it is possible that according to everyone we would say it was [due to the long] gestation for it is frequent today and this is what is written in the responsum that the Beit Yosef cited  at the end of Cap. #178.",
                "19 [If a woman was impregnated by her husband at] the end of Sivan [and she gave birth at the beginning of Kislev, even though there are only five months between them we need not be concerned that she was impregnated before then, because the determinant is the new month, and there were seven months of gestation]. It would seem that this is challenged by the first chapter of Rosh Hashana [11a] as find there: On Passover Isaac was born. The Gemara asks: From where do we derive this? As it is written that the angel who informed Sarah that she would bear a son told Abraham: “At the appointed time [mo’ed] I will return to you, at this season, and Sarah shall have a son” (Genesis 18:14). This is understood to mean: At the time of the next Festival [mo’ed]. When did the angel say this? If we say that it was on Passover and he said to him that Sarah would have a son on Shavuot, can a woman give birth after only fifty days? Rather, say that it was Shavuot and he said that she would give birth on the Festival that occurs in the month of Tishrei, i.e., Sukkot. But still, can she give birth after only five months? Rather, you must say that it was Sukkot, and he spoke about the Festival that occurs in the month of Nisan, i.e., Passover. The Gemara asks further: But still, can a woman give birth after only six months? The Gemara answers: A Sage taught in a baraita: That year was a leap year, in which an additional month of Adar was added before Nisan, and a woman can indeed give birth after seven months. The problem is why does the Gemara assume it was six months between Sukkot [Tishre] and Pesach [Nissan] when there are seven months according to the view that the [blowing of the] shofar causes [the previous month to be counted as a full month of pregnancy regardless of the number of days that she was pregnant in that month] and it is possible to explain that according to the view that a woman who gives birth after seven months can give birth prematurely one no longer needs to assume it was a leap year but rather the [blowing of the] shofar causes [the previous month to be counted as a full month of pregnancy regardless of the number of days that she was pregnant in that month] this is the way to explain the Gemara's question but the words of Tosafot there cannot be explained this way..."
