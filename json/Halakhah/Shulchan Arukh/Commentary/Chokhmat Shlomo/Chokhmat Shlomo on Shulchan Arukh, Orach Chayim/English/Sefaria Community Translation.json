            "<b>Section 2</b> 'Even to think of a matter of Torah [in the bathroom is forbidden]...' (A marginal annotation) I was unsure whether it is permitted to think of the Blessed One or not. It seems that one could learn by a <i>kal vechomer</i> that [since it is forbidden to think of the Torah, surely] it is forbidden to think of God's reality and capability.  But according to some of the mystics, one wearing the tefillin of Rabbenu Tam is permitted to speak secular speech in them, since the power of the tefillin's holiness is great and no impure thing can take hold of them, and it's possible to say that all the more so is this true here [since God's holiness is even greater than that of tefillin]! It seems to me that there is proof of this from the Talmud (Yoma 7b) where a dispute is brought between Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Yehuda regarding the headplate (<i>tzitz</i>) of the High Priest. Rabbi Shimon's reasoning is from the verse \"...And it shall be always on his forehead, that they may always be acceptable before the Lord.\" (Exodus 28:38). If one were to say literally <i>always</i>, does he not need sleep, does he not need to use the bathroom [in which situations he does not wear the headplate]? Rather, \"it will always be acceptable\" (ibid.) [i.e., the word 'always' in the verse modifies God's acceptance, rather than the High Priest's wearing of the headplate]. But according to Rabbi Yehuda, that 'always' tells us that he may not distract himself from it, etc. And there is a difficulty that this brings to light for Rabbi Shimon - what can he do with the verse \"I set the Lord before me always\" (Psalms 16:8)? He has the same problem; people need to go to sleep and to the bathroom! This is fine for Rabbi Yehuda, since he reads the verse as saying one shouldn't distract oneself from God. But for Rabbi Shimon it's a problem -- how's he going to solve this? What does 'always' mean here? This is an undeniable proof that with regard to God's reality, may God be blessed, it's permitted to think about God, even in the bathroom. And it doesn't make sense here to raise a question about going to sleep, since one could answer that all dreams are just thoughts of the day, and if one thinks always of God, and also in the night one's ideas are on God, then it's appropriate to say 'always'. Thus it seems in my humble opinion, and study very well and you will find this clear."

            "It seems to me, that if we look at the Magen Avraham, Siman 101, that he writes that the blessing on the moon is a time bound positive commandment, and women are exempt, and he writes as such in the name of the Shelah. In my mind, this is amazing, and it is not related at all to a time bound commandment, because this category only relates to a commandment where the actual commandment can be fulfilled at any time. For example, matza or sukkah and lulav could possibly be fulfilled in Cheshvan just as in Tishrei, or in Iyyar just like in Nissan. Nevertheless, the Torah specified certain days as an obligation, and after that time one is exempt. It follows that those are time bound commandments and therefore, women are exempt. With regard to the moon, however, rather than the time preventing fulfillment of the commandment, it is the commandment itself that is not applicable at the time. For if one has already made the blessing upon seeing [the moon] one cannot make a second blessing. Similarly, a new fruit, once you have made a blessing [of shehecheyanu] when you have seen or eaten it, one is not required to make a second blessing. "
