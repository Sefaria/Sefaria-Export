            "1. The Rash\"al, Chapter 25, Siman 100 holds differently on this and on what the Rambam and the Mordechai wrote; (the Rash\"al's) opinion is to be strict regarding benefit. And all we have are the words of the Rishonim and Achronim.",
            "2. In the Tur it is written [as] \"...but Kosher meat in impure milk or the opposite...and wild animal meat, etc.\" - these prohibitions are rabbinical and it is permitted to cook them. The Beis Yosef concludes that if one Min (kind) is tamei, this is forbidden to be eaten according to Torah law. And why was a decree of Meat and Milk applied to it with regard to eating. The Drisha and my teacher and father in law, of blessed memory, reconcile that there is a practical difference that this decree was made to apply the din of \"Piece itself becomes Unkosher\" to it. That's the logic of Rabbeinu Efraim in Siman 92. That we only say this regarding Meat and Milk. The rabbis are not correct in this, their honor intact, that the primary reason that Rabbeinu Efraim was stringent regarding Meat and Milk is that each one itself is allowed. It is only prohibited when it's mixed and becomes one body. Like the Beis Yosef brings in the name of Tosefos in Siman 82. It is not relevant in a case where one of the them is impure because anyways there is a Torah prohibition on it. If so, it should be like any other prohibition. You can't say that the Rabbis enacted a decree on this to apply the law of \"piece that becomes unkosher\" because of other Meat and Milk from the Torah. For if so, the decree should have applied even regarding cooking and benefit since anyways there is a Torah prohibition against eating. They are stringent regard mixtures here too they should have been strigent in this. From these things, there is a difficulty even what my teacher and father in law, of blessed memory, wrote. That there is practical difference in the case of \"a piece fitting to be honoured\" as mentioned in Shulchan Aruch Siman 101. If it is prohibited because it receices the flavour, it is nullified excpet regard Meat and Milk. Even this is not at all right because the stringency of Meat and Milk there is a practical difference from the reason of \"a piece that becomes unkosher\", as explained by the Beis Yosef, there in the name of the Toras HaBais (Rashba) and the \"...\" and the Sefer HaTerumah. Since that the Meat and Milk become cooked, it becomes one body of prohibition. In contract to other prohibitions...",

            "3. In the Beis Yosef it is written, that in any case one should not eat fish with milk because of the danger [associated with it]. And this is done to limit the danger. And it was needed to be said \"with meat\" as that was mentioned in Orach Chaim Siman 173, and such was also written in the Darchei Moshe, in that the Beis Yosef intervenes meat and milk here with the old ways, as it was in the Beis Yosef['s time] and this is not correct.",
