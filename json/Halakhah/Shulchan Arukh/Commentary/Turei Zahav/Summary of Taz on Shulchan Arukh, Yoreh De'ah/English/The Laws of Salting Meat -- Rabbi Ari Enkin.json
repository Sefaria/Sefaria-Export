                "(1) The Bais Yosef brings two reasons for the primary rinsing, a) The Rosh  holds it is for any blood that might have dried on the surface because salt will  not absorb dry blood that is on the surface of the meat, b) The view of the  Ran is that the washing is to soften the meat, making it easier for blood to  escape during the salting. The Hagos Maimoni gives the reason that it is to  remove the blood that is on the surface of the meat, for otherwise the salt will simply fill up with blood and not perform its function of removing the  blood that is in the meat.  ",

                "(6) However if there is a sixty ratio of water against the meat, the meat would  be permissible, because even if it was cooked without being salted we are  lenient in a case of great financial loss. Therefore, we would permit the meat  even without incurring a great financial loss as long as there was sixty. The  Rashal disagrees.   "

                "(8) There are two reasons for this, a) because we are not competent enough to  be able to distinguish between a slight salting for the purpose of roasting, and one  for the purpose of cooking and b) because even a slight salting, such as in  preparation for roasting, can cause some of the surface blood to be absorbed.

However, regarding the view that the  rinsing is for the purpose of softening the meat, it would not be acceptable. Those  who permit it are relying on those who rule that the reason for the rinsing is to  remove surface blood.  ",

Anything thicker  than this must be made thinner. One should always be careful as to which  surfaces one puts his raw meat on. if meat is mistakenly placed on a surface  soiled with salt, it is as if the meat has been salted without rinsing. Also, one  should be careful not to leave salt in a place where someone might place raw  meat.   "

It is most  meticulous to cut the head open or to at least poke a hole in the skull, so that  the blood will flow out.  ",

There are cases of a great loss in which we are more lenient and  assume that meat releases fluids for twenty four hours. We can not use this  leniency here because it can not be called a case of great loss, since one can  still use the meat by roasting it. Of course, all this is speaking of a case where  the meat was not washed off after having been salted. If the meat has been  washed off then the pores of the meat close, and further salting won’t help.   "

A) What is the Rema coming to teach  us since anyway the Mechaber holds that spraying off the meat or wiping it  off followed by two washings in a vessel is enough. And b) the “or” place it  three times in a vessel is not acceptable because rinsing it by hand is  initially and ideally required! Therefore it seems that the ”or\" is a printers  mistake and everything works out well by saying that the Mechaber holds  that two rinsings is enough, and that the wiping is not for the purposes of  rinsing but rather in order to help prevent the meat from absorbing the salt  and blood which is on it.

Unsalted ox meat placed in a kli-rishon may be removed and salted if it did  not boil yet since ox meat takes a long time to cook. This applies only to meat  such as this that takes a while to cook, and not to any other meat.   "

For example, he is speaking with  regard to other matters , and indirectly provided the information needed. In  such a way is he believed. How much better if he knows the customs may he  be believed since he is an employee and wants tofulfil his masters wishes.  However if he has ulterior motives, such as wanting to be favored by a Jew, we  don’t accept his mesiach Ifi tumo. If there is someone walking in and out we  don’t even need mesiach Ifi tumo, as is how the Rema ruled. The reason a  non-Jew is believed with mesiach Ifi tumo is because the prohibitions here are  of a rabbinical nature. In a case where meat has been cooked, and you are  unsure whether it had been salted, the meat is permitted for the same reason  i.e. that is a doubt in a rabbinical law. It can also be said that there is a  chazakah that in the majority of situations one will have surely salted his meat.  A rov is stronger than a chazakah.  ",

It is also  for the reason that the taste of the blood remains in the meat and is not weakened  or nullified, therefore the entire piece is forbidden. Another reason is because the  blood is considered an issur davuk, and if the piece of meat was exposed outside  of the liquid in the pot before it let out the blood, there is now lacking sixty against  the blood, and it therefore becomes forbidden.

Meat that went  three days without being salted, and is now salted with other meat is forbidden  since even though it won’t release any blood, it still absorbs blood.

The same is also true if an unsalted piece  is mixed with two other salted pieces, then one need not re-salt them all due to  the uncertainty of which one is which.

According to Rashi if one cut the meat after the  required salting time it needs only to be washed, for the tzir is considered as a  cold substance now, not roseiach, but the Mechaber requires purging.  ",

Even though the salt on the meat is forbidden for it is mixed with blood,  nevertheless, the blood dries up into the salt and has no strength to be absorbed  into the meat, as well as the fact that the salt has no strength after the salting  period. This is all in a case of great loss, if not, one should not be lenient for many  are of the opinion that the salt is still considered roseiach.  ",
                "(48) But the Rashal holds that whatever is in the tzir is absolutely forbidden. He  also says that if this piece is mixed with others it doesn’t need sixty, only a  majority to be  nullified. It is a case where one may rely on Rashi who is lenient in any case.  ",
                "(49) For the vessel will easily absorb since it has nowhere to go.  ",

                "(51) Meaning that in a case of great loss one may be lenient as in the first opinion  that doesn’t consider the tzir roseiach after the salting period.  ",
                "(52) This is difficult to understand for even the first opinion in the Mechaber, which  is Rashi’s view, one must wash the meat well after salting. Therefore, why did he  write this law as being according to the one that forbids it? One must say that  according to Rashi one need not wash the meat off right away, and it may even  be put it into a vessel without holes until one is ready to cook it and then wash it.  However according to those who forbid it for it is considered as roseiach one must  immediately wash the meat before placing it into a vessel without holes, but this is  not mentioned in the words of the Mechaber.  ",

This poses a difficulty based on section 17 where it should  be permitted even in a vessel with holes based on this, and nevertheless the  Rema forbids it! This requires further study.   "

                "(2) The reason is because salt does not cause absorption, it only releases.  However, we have established that one of the reasons for the initial washing of  the meat is because the salt can absorb what’s on its surface. Then we must  say let that the reason that it won’t absorb over here is since the meat is in the  process of releasing tzir the second salting can not cause it to absorb. This is  indeed not the same case in sec. 69 where meat that was salted without a  primary washing and the meat will absorb from the salt since it is not in the  process of releasing. In a case later on, where we do forbid meat that had  blood fall on it while it was in the process of releasing we should also be able  to say that it didn’t absorb! The answer is that in this case the reason that it is  forbidden is not because it was absorbed by the salt, but rather because the  meat is considered roseiach and because of that reason it absorbs the blood.  ",
                "(3) The reason is that as long as the scales are on and did not absorb, they  remain entirely forbidden. Also, the fish are not forbidden because they were  salted with meat, as there is no danger in salting.   "

                "(5) In a case of doubt we forbid it.  ",
                "(6) The reason we are strict in the case of Rashi in section 69 regarding juice  after the required salting time, is only when the juice is visible and the meat is  sitting inside it. This is not the case here. Regarding any wetness on the meat  one need not be stringent and it suffices to wash the fish.  ",

                "(8) It seems that they should be forbidden as the Mechaber holds that regarding  fish we do not say that while they release their blood, they will release other blood  for four reasons: a) Fish are a permitted entity and once absorbed with blood,  become forbidden. How can they go back to permitted status? b) Blood of fish is  not considered blood for these purposes rather, tzir. In that case we can not say  that while it releases its own blood it will release other blood. c) Since there is  very little blood in fish, we can’t assume it will release all other blood absorbed. d)  Since the fish covering is soft, the blood is more saturated and the salt can not  bring it out.

                "(13) And one need not worry that it will absorb from the salt that is upon it, for  even according to those who rule stringently in the case of Rashi nevertheless  they would agree that since there is no tzir here, one need not worry. In the case  over there, the problem was because the vessel did not have holes and the meat  was sitting in the tzir which absorbs along with the salt, into the meat.   "

                "(14) Even with regards to meat that had already expelled all its blood and tzir, we  say that a second salting will cause the blood presently absorbed to be released.  The first “there are those who permit” is referring to a case of meat that wasn't  salted at all. The “those who forbid” at the beginning rule that salt can only expel  its own blood but not blood absorbed from something else.  ",
                "(15) The reason is that it has nothing to expel, for it has already expelled all its  blood.  It will only absorb what the next piece releases.  ",
                "(16) The reason that it is not forbidden is because as it releases its own blood, it  will also release whatever it absorbed from the piece that was not salted. This is  only if the meat was not washed after salting. However if it was washed off after  its salting, then a second salting will not help to release its tzir since its pores are  now closed up. This is only if it was washed after the required salting period,  however if it was washed before the required salting period we do not say that the  pores have been closed, and another salting will suffice. The Rema seems to rule  over here that a washing does not close up the pores just as the Tur rules as well,  but previously he ruled they did. It seems that if meat that has completed the  required salting time fell into meat that is in the process of being salted, it is  permitted because of the rule that “as it absorbed, so will it release.\" As it  absorbed from the pieces it fell into, it will release it as it releases its own tzir.  However, if it fell into tzir it is forbidden, even if the meat did not finish the process  of salting and was in it for the amount of time that is considered as \"cooking\" to  take effect. This is not as the Rashal who permitted the meat if it had not gone  through the required salting time and fell into tzir and even remained in it for the  length of time of “soaking”, if re-washed and salted. Rather, we follow the opinion  that the amount of time to effect “soaking” is considered as “cooking\" and another  salting will not help.  ",
                "(17) The “entire day” measurement is actually a printing error. It should say “if it  did not soak in it for the prohibition of ‘soaking’ to take effect,” If it did soak for this  amount of time than it is forbidden even if it didn’t soak for a whole day. It seems  that we are dealing with a case regarding a vessel with holes. For the purposes of  halacha, the ruling should be that if it fell into tzir during the salting period but was  immersed for less than the soaking’ period, one should re-wash and re-salt it. If  not, it is forbidden and there is no way of permitting it. If the meat did conclude  the salting period and fell into tzir, it becomes immediately forbidden for it is  considered roseiach. ",
                "(18) The reason is because it was washed before its first salting. One need not  soak the meat in water, simply pouring water over it will suffice. We don’t say that  it is like meat that was salted without its primary washing.  ",

                "(20) Meaning after it sat the required salting time in a case in which a second  salting will not help. For example: when there is no great need or loss. However,  in a case where a second salting is permitted it only becomes forbidden if it sat  for the 'soaking’ period regarding tzir, which is the time it takes water to boil.   "

The cutting stated here is for those who want to be more  meticulous, however the halacha does not require it for the head is as any other  thick piece of meat.

The Darchei Moshe writes that one may be lenient and cook it after salting. So too the Rahsal writes that one should be lenient because this stringency is not found in the Talmud or the writings of the great sages. "

We only say that rule concerning blood that was released not from  blood that is present before us. The answer is that since the blood dries up from  the roasting it is considered to be as blood that was released. It is possible to say  that as a result of salting as well the blood dries up.  ",
                "(3) Not like the Rambam who rules that it should be permitted.  ",
                "(4) As for the halacha, it seems that one should be stringent as the Rema in  Toras Chatas, that sixty is required against the heart, even in a case of salting.  The Maharshal writes that a goose whose skin has been removed, salted whole,  and then cooked is forbidden for there is not even sixty against the blood in the  heart.  ",
                "(5) The reason is because the blood in the heart dries up and will not come out.  ",
                "(6) Even though we said earlier that blood that was gathered is as blood that was  released, that is true only in regards to the heart, however with all other meat it is  as actual blood.  ",
                "(7) Meaning that the custom to be lenient is true for meat salted with the heart,  and the heart itself is permitted. This is because it is considered as blood that was  released, and due to the rule “as it absorbed so will it release”. However, if it was  cooked, even if there would be sixty, the heart remains forbidden. When the  Rema wrote in sub-¬section 3 that if the poultry was whole everything is  permitted, his intention was that everything except the heart is permitted.  ",
                "(8) Meaning that even if the top was closed during the salting, cutting it afterwards  will rectify the situation. Even if it was open on top, it must now be cut open,  because what was open is not considered equal to it actually having been cut  open. If the heart's opening was placed facing down, allowing for blood to escape,  some say that it is as if it had been cut open, and is permitted.   "

                "(9) In his Responsa R”y Mintz rules that even if its wings and legs are removed, it  is still considered whole. The reason the Rema didn’t say that even if it is missing  its wings, is because in that case it would have to be measured for the sixty ratio.  The Rema brought parameters where the bird would not have to be measured for  the sixty ratio. If the bird was stuffed with meat and vegetables and the like, they  too combine to form sixty. This is because the issues regarding something  attached are simply stringencies, it seems that a goose lacking its skin will still  have sixty against its heart.  ",
                "(10) There are two reasons that we are more strict regarding an item that is  attached. A) The piece it is attached to will absorb more from it than other items in  the pot. B) We fear that this piece may have been outside of the liquid, in which  case there would not have been sixty against the heart and then became nveilah.  However we only say this rule in the case of something biblically forbidden.  Regarding something that is rabbinically forbidden, we rule more leniently. A bird  that was stuffed with eggs, salted, and it is then discovered that the heart is still in  the chicken is subject to the following rule: if the heart is not attached, the eggs  cause the bird to be considered as if cooked and combine to form the required  sixty. If there is sixty, everything is permitted. If the heart was still attached, the  eggs do not count, and sixty is needed from the bird alone, in order to permit  everything.   "

The Sharei Dura writes that even post facto it is  forbidden, however if a Rav ruled like the Rabbeinu Tam we don’t contradict his  ruling. It appears to me that even if it wasn’t cooked yet. the Rav may be relied  upon. However if it was cooked with other meat, without having been salted,  everything including the pot becomes forbidden unless there is sixty against the liver. The Tur writes that post facto, a liver that was cooked alone even without  having been salted is permitted. Therefore, if a Rav ruled like the Tur we do not  contradict his ruling.  ",

However according to those who require it even for roasting,  merely piercing it is unacceptable. One should be stringent even with the liver of  poultry to at least make holes in it. It is best however even regarding the liver of  poultry to cut it along its length and width, it seems to me that for the liver of  poultry, it suffices simply to remove its gall even if it is to be cooked after roasting.  Regarding the liver of other animals however, it must be cut along it’s width and  length if it is to be cooked after being roasted. If it is only to be roasted, piercing  holes in it will suffice.
