            "It is a positive commandment for a master to circumcise his slaves, If the master fails to circumcise them then it is a mitzvah on the Beit Din to circumcise them. A slave boy born in a Jewish household or one purchased from an idolater, you are (still) required to circumcise. A slave not born in your home is circumcised the same day, even if you acquired him the day he was born, you circumcise him the same day. There are slaves who are purchased  that are circumcised on the eighth day as well as slaves born in your home that you circumcise the same day. What do we mean?Should one purchase a maidservant and purchase the rights to her fetus (separately), when she gives birth, the baby should be circumcised on the eighth day.Although the fetus itself was purchased alone, since he purchased the mother before the child was born, the child should be circumcised on his eighth day.If one acquires a maidservant or her offspring or one acquires (purchases) a maidservant with the intent of not immersing her for the sake of slavehood, even though her offspring is born in his home, the child should be circumcised on the day he was born,This is because the child is considered as if he alone had been purchased , and it is as if he purchased him this day.His mother is not among the maidservants of the Jewish people, so that the child could be considered home-born slave. And if she immerses after she gives birth,  the child should be circumcised on the eighth day. Although the fetus itself was purchased alone, since he purchased the mother before the child was born, the child should be circumcised on his eighth day. If one acquires a maidservant or her offspring or one acquires (purchases) a maidservant with the intent of not immersing her for the sake of slavehood, even though her offspring is born in his home, the child should be circumcised on the day he was born, This is because the child is considered as if he alone had been purchased , and it is as if he purchased him this day. His mother is not among the maidservants of the Jewish people, so that the child could be considered home-born slave. And if she immerses after she gives birth,  the child should be circumcised on the eighth day.",
            "Just as the circumcision of sons supersedes the Shabbat, so too, the circumcision of those slaves who are circumcised on the eighth day supersede Shabbat, with the exception of one born in your home and or purchased whose mother did not immerse herself until after she gave birth. Although such a slave is circumcised on the eighth day, his circumcision does not supersede Shabbat.",

If he agrees we inform him of the fundamentals of the faith, some of the minor commandments and some of the more severe ones and punishments and rewards, like we do with a convert. Then we immerse him like we do with a convert and inform him while he is in the water. [And the slave recites the blessing over the immersion, not the master.] ",

If for whatever reason we purchase him before and then immerse him (it will end up being) for the sake of attaining his freedom, he therefore will be a free man. For this reason we need impose any form of servitude on him while in the water, so that it will look like he is a slave, if not beforehand he will say, I am immersing  for sake of becoming a free man.

And if we immerse one for slavery, hes a slave and obligated to the mitzvot that pertain to woman, and because its a slave it is permitted to give him oppressive labor. Although this is the law according to our standards of decency and the ways of our sages which expects a person to be merciful and not make his slave carry a heavy yoke nor cause him distress, He should also allow them to partake of all the food and drink he serves, Similarly, we should not embarrass a slave by our  words nor should one shout or vent anger upon them but rather speak with them pleasantly, and hear their complaints.",

However  if  the master cut it out, even if he wasn't able to use it at all the slave goes free because the master caused him to lose an organ. The same law applies with regard to any other of the tips of the organs that are not functional and cannot be used for labor, if they are cut the slave is released because of losing an organ/limb.",

Thus if the master intended to hit an animal with a rock but instead hit the slave and cut a finger or knocked out a tooth the slave does not go free. And If the master inserted his hand into the womb of his maid-servant and blinded the eye of the fetus within, he is not granted his freedom, for he was not aware of the entity thus he could intend to strike it. However if the Master is the slaves doctor and the slave told him: \"Treat my eye for me,\" and he ends up blinded it, the slave goes free because his intention/attention was on the Limb/Organ.",

            "If one knocks out the tooth of his slave and blinds his eye, he goes free and does not have to pay damages for his eye. If he seizes the money owed to him we don't remove it from his hand. And if he (his master) writes him a bill of release in the middle of  knocking his tooth and blinded his eye, he is obligated to pay damages for his eye.",

The master must write to him on a paper or on a shard: \"Behold, you are a free man,\" \"Behold, you are your own property,\" \"I no longer have anything to do with you,\" And handed over to him or to another for him, Even without the knowledge of the slave because it is benefit to him to be freed from under the master's hand to freedom, however if he protests when he receives it he does not go free.",
            "If others informed him with those expressions (verbally)  “ it is of no consequence”.",
            "For his female slave if he writes: Behold you are permitted to anyone, it is of no consequence.",
            "If he is given the document in the presence witnesses. or, if witnesses have signed on the bill of release and he gives the slave the bill of release in private, he attains his freedom. There are those who say that it needs to be given to him in the presence witnesses. And if we see it signed, there is no need for us to receive testimony ascribing that it was legally delivered.",
            "There are six things in where a bill of release given to a slave is equivalent to a bill of divorce. With regard to other matters, a bill of release is equivalent to other legal documents. These are the six: 1) they are not acceptable if prepared by the courts of idolaters; 2) they are acceptable if one witness is a cuthean, 3) they must be written for the sake of the slave who is being freed; 4) they may not be written on an article that is attached to the ground; 5) the witnesses may sign only in the presence of each other; and 6) the same laws apply to a bill of divorce and a bill of release with regard to bringing these legal documents from one place to another.",
            "What is implied? All legal documents that are composed by idolaters are acceptable provided they conform to all the conditions stated in Hilchot Halva'ah with the exception of bills of divorce for women and bills of release for slaves.",
            "Any legal document that is signed by even one witness who is a cuthean is not acceptable, with the exception of bills of divorce for women and bills of release for slaves, provided the Cuthean is known to be precise in his observance. In the present age, when the Cutheans are considered as gentiles with regard to all matters, we apply the laws stated with regard to them to the Sadducees. For the Sadducees in the present era are considered like the Cutheans of the previous era, before it was decreed that they would be considered like gentiles.",
            "With regard to a woman's bill of divorce, Deuteronomy 24:1 states: \"And he shall write to her, “for her sake” and a document free a female (canaanite) slave reads “Nor was freedom given to her,\" Leviticus 19:2 teaching that the bill of release must be written for her sake.",
            "With regard to a woman's bill of divorce, Deuteronomy 24:1 states: \"And he shall write to her, he who does not (the bill should be written) on a substance that is lacking only to be given. This excludes a bill of divorce that is written while the article on which it is written is attached and afterwards detached. For it is lacking both being detached and being given. Similarly, with regard to a bill of release, it is written: \"given to her,\" (Lev 19:2) teaching that the bill of release should be lacking only being given.",
            "Witnesses may not sign bills of divorce for women and bills of release for slaves outside each other's presence. ",
            "What is meant by the statement that the same laws apply to bills of divorce and bills of release with regard to bringing these legal documents from one place to another? When an agent brings a bill of release from one place to another in the land of Israel, he does not have to testify that it was written and signed in his presence. And in the diaspora, if there are no witnesses present to verify the authenticity of the bill of release, and the agent states that it was written and signed in his presence, its authenticity is considered as verified. Afterwards, if the master comes and protests, no attention is paid to him, as we have explained with regard to a bill of divorce.",
            "Just as when a woman brings a bill of divorce, she does not have to have the authenticity of the document verified, because the bill of divorce is in her possession so when a servant's bill of release is in his possession, he does not have to have the authenticity of the document verified.",
            "Just as the woman must say: \"It was written and signed in my presence,\" when it was stipulated that she do so, as we have explained in that context, the same applies for a servant/slave.",
            "Everyone who is acceptable to bring a bill of divorce to a woman (as the husband's agent) is also acceptable to bring a bill of release for a slave (as the agent of the master.)",
            "A slave may receive a bill of release for another slave from that slave's master, but not from his own master.",
            "If one transfers a bill of release for a servant with the intention that he be released in a court, we  do not differentiate if it says: Yourself and the assets you purchased, we  do not differentiate if it says: all my property is acquired by you, he acquired his own person by saying: Before me it was written and signed; However he does not acquire it until the authenticity of the document is verified.",
            "If someone writes over all his assets to his slave, the slave acquires his freedom, for he is included in assets and acquires himself  in all those assets. However if is left over small assets, whether its attached to the ground or his personal belongings, whether he specifies a portion or not, whether he has other assets of those leftover whether they werent other assets, even if he writes to him : yourself and all my assets should be acquired to you besides one object, he does not go out free and does not acquire the assets.",
            "Regarding a document for erusin of a maidservant, although it states: go out to freedom and go be betrothed, these are not the words of release, (thus) she is not betrothed nor released.",
            "One who liberated two slaves with one document,  they do not acquire their freedom. Therefore if a person writes a single legal document transferring all his property to two slaves, they do not acquire their freedom. If the master wrote two documents, one for each slave, they acquire their freedom. When does the above apply? When the master wrote in each legal document: \"All my property is given to so and so and so and so, my slaves. If, however, he writes: \"Half of my property is given to so and so, my slave, and the other half is given to so and so, my slave,\" even if the owner wrote two documents, the slaves do not acquire anything.",
            "If one free his slave halfway with a bill of release, the slave does not acquire half of his person, and he is a slave just as he was before. However if he releases half of a slave, because of a monetary payment - e.g., he took money for half his worth with the intent of freeing that half - he acquires (half his freedom). Thus, he is half slave and half free man. When does the above apply? When the master released half of the slave (with a bill of release) and retained half. If, however, he sold half the slave and gave away the other half after, whether the liberation was through the selling or as a gift likewise whether the sale preceded it or after the release the slave acquires half of his person, and acquires or accepts the other. Similarly, when a slave is owned by two partners, and one frees his half - whether through money or through a legal document - the slave acquires his half, and he is half slave and half free man.",
            "When a master writes a bill of release for his maidservant who is pregnant, stating \"You are free, but your child-to-be remains a slave,\" his words are binding. If, however, it states: \"You remain a maid-servant, but your child- to-be is free,\" it is of no consequence.",
            "A person who is a half slave and half free is not permitted to marry a maid-servant or a free woman. Therefore, we compel his master to write a bill for the other halfs value. And if he still doesn't write him a bill of (full) release, his talents (work of his hands) belong to himself, and if his bull kills he doesn't have to pay a fine or the kofer. When does the above apply? For a male slave. For a male is commanded to be fruitful and multiply. A maid-servant, however, should remain in her immediate state and serve her herself one day, and the master the next. If a man strikes her on the hand and it withered, but it will eventually return and heal, if he struck her on a day she was serving her master he is liable for the damages if on another day she is liable, however if he severs the hand, as well as all any body part that does not return or heal itself, the portion of the damage is split between her and her master. If the she dies we give half of the fine to the master and exempt him half of the kofer.",
            "A slave owned by two masters. One set him free as to his half. We thus compel the second one to also free his share. However if he thought to himself: If the Rabbis hear of it, they will compel me to set him free. So he transferred him to his minor son, For no beit din can force his son to release the slave, however the court can appoint a guardian for the minor who will entice the child with coins and then the guardian will write a bill of emancipation in the child's name. And certainly like this intentionally take away the enactment of the sages, however if the father dies and minor son inherits his half, we do not appoint a guardian to the minor in order to free the slave, (what do we do) The slave will remain only half free and thus work for himself one day and one day for the minor until he (the minor) grows up (and the court could then compel him.) ...",
            "If someone declare his slave ownerless, the slave is granted his freedom. A bill of release is composed for him. If the master who declared him ownerless dies, his heir should compose the bill of release.",
            "A convert who dies without heirs, and they were older slaves, they acquire themselves and are free, however regarding children they cannot acquire themselves and thus are not freed.",
            "A slave who is captured and then escapes, If his master despaired of regaining ownership of him, he is granted his freedom and we compel his master to write him a document of release.",
            "A slave that is captured and his first master despaired of regaining ownership of him, anyone who redeems him with the intent that he remain a slave may subjugate him, and he becomes his property. If he redeemed him with the intent that he become free, he is granted his freedom. If the slave's first owner did not despair of regaining ownership, one who redeems the slave with the intent that he remain a slave should take back the money he spent to redeem him from his owner, and the slave is returned to his original owner. If he redeemed him with the intent of freeing him, he is returned to his original owner without any owing anything.",
            "If a master makes a slave as collateral  for his creditor and then frees the slave, the slave is freed, because he was expropriated from slavery he is free, and thus the value must be paid to his debtors, and we compel his debtors to write him a document of freedom.",
            "When Israelite has relations with a female slave, even though she is his slave her offspring is also (his) slave. Some say that if he has relations with his maid servant or a prostitute, the child is born free, for all who say this (Rav Nitrona Gaon and other poskim). there are (also) those who say that the rest of the things are similar to a male slave's freedom (however) it's not allowed for a free maidservant until she's receives a document of freedom.",
            "If a master marries his slave to a free woman, places tefillin on his head, or tells his slave to read three pesukim from a sefer torah in front of others, regarding matters that only a freed person is obligated to he becomes a free man. (if his master refuses) We compel him to compose a bill of release for him. If, however, a person borrows money from his slave, makes him a guardian, if the slave puts on tefillin before his master, or reads three verses in the synagogue in his master's presence, and his master does not protest against him, he does not obtain his freedom.",
            "It is forbidden for a master to teach his slave Torah. If he teaches him, he is not granted his freedom",
            "There are those who say that if a slave takes a vow that obligates him on something,  such as he vowed not to eat meat or the like, and his master says: \"The vow is annulled.\" (in other words) because he did not compel him in a situation (in which he should have compelled him,) he was showing that he was releasing him.",
            "One who frees his slave speaking in any language and uttered words which state that his intentions are that he no longer has any authority over him, and he has resolved to accept this step, he cannot retract and we compel him to write a bill of release even though he has not written one already..",
            "When a person writes a document that states: I’ll make my slave free, and he gives it to him he does not receive his freedom but if he writes I have made or he may go free or behold he is free or he will be free and then the document is given to him he goes free. However if he says this to him in one of these other languages he does not go free and in a case where the master is deathly ill person if he says it to him in one of these languages, he goes free and will need a document of release to be permitted to marry a free woman and we compel the heirs to write it. Even though he is healthy, if they told him through a confession he goes free and needs a bill of release and we compel his master to write one.",
            "When one says: that he released his slave and the slave says has not been released, we suspect that the master had another person acquire the bill of release on behalf of the slave. If the he said: \"I composed a deed of release and gave it to him,\" and the slave says: \"You didn't write it nor did you give it,\" the admission of a litigant is equivalent to that of a 100 witnesses, and thus he remains a slave.",
            "If he says afterwards take possession of this bill of release to free my slave, the slave goes free although he doesn't come near to the slave however if he says give this bill of release to my slave, he cannot change his mind, and the slave will not be free till the document reaches his hand. Therefore he who says: Give this document to my slave (and the master dies) the document is not given after his death.",
            "When a master commands at the time of his death: \"My heirs should not subjugate so and so, my maid-servant,\" she is still considered a maid-servant as before, but it is forbidden for his heirs to subjugate her. And if he says: \"cause her to be content,\" we compel the heirs not to make her perform any tasks other than the ones that she desires to perform. If he commanded them to free her, we compel them to free her.",
            "A deathly ill person who wrote that all his possessions be given to his slave, and then recovers from his illness, the statement regarding the possession is retracted. If this happened regarding giving the slave his freedom it is not retracted, for he has already gained the reputation of being a free man.",
            "One who releases his slave transgresses a positive commandment (Lev 15:26) “forever you will make them work for you.\" it is permitted to free a slave for the sake of a Mitzvah, even a rabbinic one, for example if one was short a man in the synagogue for a making a minyan, if one only had 9 one should free his slave to make 10, and so forth. As well as a maid servant if it is customary for her to behave inappropriately with others we compel her master to free her, in order that the barrier be removed.",
            "If one sells his slave to an idolater or  Ger toshav he goes free, and if he escaped from a gentile, the master could not enslave him again. If he didn't escape We compel the previous owner to buy him back from the gentiles at even ten times his value. He then composes a bill of release for him, and the slave is released from slavery. This fine is only collected and brought to judgment in a court of expert judges.If the seller dies, we do not require his heir to return the slave so that he can free him.",
            "A slave who has been circumcised and immersed himself to become a slave, but afterwards he is captured by gentiles and his master cannot get him back and they refuse to sell him back it is permitted to take money and one can write a bill of sale for them.",
            "If one sells his slave outside of the land of Israel, Syria or Acco he goes free, we compel his new master to write him a bill of release and he forfeits the sale at a loss. Even if he says: I won't take him out of the land, I will enslave him in the land of Israel we do not listen to him.",
            "When a slave follows his master to Syria, and his master sells him there, the slave is considered to have forfeited his privilege. When does the above apply? When his master took him to the diaspora with the intent not to return to Eretz Yisrael. If, however, his master's intent was to return, and the slave followed him with that intent, should the master sell him there, he is granted his freedom, and we compel the purchaser to release him.",
            "When a slave asks his master to move to Eretz Yisrael, we compel his master to move there with him or to sell him to someone who is moving there. When a master living in Eretz Yisrael desires to move to the diaspora, he cannot compel the slave to move with him against his will. This law applies in all times, even in the present era, when the land is ruled by gentiles.",
            "When a slave flees from the diaspora to Eretz Yisrael, he should not be returned to slavery. Concerning such a person, it states: \"Do not return a slave to his master.\" His master is told to compose a bill of release for him, and he writes a promissory note for his master for his worth, which the master holds until the freed slave earns that money and gives it to him. If the master does not desire to free him, the court invalidates his ownership of him, and the slave is free to go on his way."
