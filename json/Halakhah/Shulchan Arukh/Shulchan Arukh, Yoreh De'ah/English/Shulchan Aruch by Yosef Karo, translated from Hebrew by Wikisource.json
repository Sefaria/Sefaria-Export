So too if we find that he is red it is a sign that his blood is not in his limbs but in his flesh and we don't circumcise him until his blood returns. We need to be very careful in these matters so that we don't circumcise him or have a suspicion of ilness.

            "Seif 1 - The circumciser blesses “who sanctified us with his commandments and commanded us regarding circumcision.” The father blesses between the cutting of the foreskin and peeling back: “who sanctified us with his commandments and commanded us to bring him into the covenant of Abraham, our father.” HAGAH – If the father of the boy is not at the Bris, there are those who say that another man makes this blessing because the court is obligated to circumcise him and our practice is that the one who holds the boy makes this blessing. So too if the father is at the Bris, but does not know how to make the blessing. The father and the mohel need to stand when they bless, but the one holding the boy customarily sits when he blesses. There are those who say that all people at the Bris must stand because it says that “all the nation stood in covenant.” This is our custom except for the one holding the boy who sits down. And if others are standing there, they say “just as you brought him into the covenant, so too should you bring him in to Torah, to the wedding canopy, and to good deeds.” The father or the mohel, or one of the people there blesses on a cup: “who creates the fruit of the vine.” And some have the custom to take a myrtle in their hands, to bless on it and to smell it. He says “BAA EMH who sanctified his dear one from the womb etc.” Our custom is when we reach “BeDamayich Chayii” to put wine on his finger and in the mouth of the baby. (And when the mohel makes the blessing, he should wipe his hands and mouth first so that he does it in cleanliness.)",

Similarly, one possessing both male and female genitalia, their circumcision does not require a blessing because they are not a male for certain. Rema: But when going back (to cut) flaps of skin that prevent the circumcision [from being kosher], one is required to go back and bless all of the blessings, but one does not say the phrase: “keep this child…”",

And we make it public knowledge during his circumcision that he is a mamzer). During Yom Kippur and the other 4 fasts one should not make the blessing over a cup [of wine], however, during the three fasts where a woman who has recently given birth does not need to fast, it is permissible to make the blessing over a cup [of wine], and the woman should taste it if she hears the blessing and intends not to make an interruption between hearing the blessing and drinking the wine, but during Yom Kippur and the 9th of Av, when the woman who has recently given birth is not allowed to drink, we do not make the blessing over a cup [of wine], and during the 9th of Av we do not bring a myrtle, because the reasoning being that we (similarly) don’t make the blessing over the spices when the 9th of Av falls on Saturday night. Rema: And there are those who say that one makes the blessing over the cup [of wine] on all of the fasts, and he gives the blessing (i.e. the wine on which the blessing was made) to the small children. And this is how we practice, and during Yom Kippur, our practice is to give [some wine] to the child who was circumcised. And there are those who say that this is sufficient even when it is not a fast day, but we don’t practice accordingly; rather, the sandek should drink [from the cup] when it is not a fast day.",

And in these places, the custom is not to bless שהחיינו, even when the father himself is circumcising his son, unless he is circumcising his firstborn son who is obligated in being redeemed, then he makes the blessing שהחיינו during the circumcision and does not make the blessing during the redemption, but when the child is exempt from being redeemed, he does not make the blessing שהחיינו.",
