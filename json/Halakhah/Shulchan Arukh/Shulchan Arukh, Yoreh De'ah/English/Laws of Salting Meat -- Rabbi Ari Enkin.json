            "(1) [1] One must rinse the meat before salting it. [2] (2) <i>And if the butcher rinsed it, one need not rinse it at home, </i>and if after rinsing the meat [3] another cut was made, [4]<i> or the hooves (3) were removed after being rinsed, </i>one must go back and re-rinse. <i>Rema: And if the re-rinsing was not performed it is as if the meat was never rinsed. Ideally, the most proper way to rinse the meat is to have it soak in water for about half an hour, and then to wipe it in the water. [5] However if one simply rinsed the meat without soaking, it would be sufficient. Afterwards [6] (4) wait a little so as to allow some of the water to evaporate so that the salt will not immediately dissolve from the water once placed on the meat, and thereby not remove any blood. [7] (5) It is customary not to use the vessel used for soaking meat for any other purpose. (6) If the meat was left soaking for twenty four hours then [8] the meat, and vessel are both forbidden to be used. [9] (see further on in this chapter) but one need not worry if it has been less than twenty four hours. Even in the case were the vessel has become forbidden, [10] one may use it for the purposes of soaking. [11] For the laws of frozen meat see chapter 78. </i>",
            "[12] If one salted without first rinsing the meat, then wash it now and then (7) re-salt it, however some forbid this. Rema: And this is our custom even if it was (8) only slightly salted as in preparation for roasting, and [13] even if it wasn’t sitting in the salt for the entire time requirement, (9) however in the case of a great loss we can permit it. (10) If the meat was rinsed only slightly before having been salted, it is [14] permissible post facto. [15] The same is true if there was a sixty to one ratio of meat against the blood on it. If one salted a piece of meat without previously washing it with other pieces, (11)[16] the other pieces are permitted, but this piece is forbidden. ",
            "The salting is not performed with [17] salt that is as (12) thin as flour nor with salt that is too thick so that it will fall off the meat<i> however if the [18] only salt you have is thin then it may be used. </i>",
            "The salt should be spread over the meat so that no place on the meat is without salt and salted to the extent that it would not be edible with such an amount of salt. [19] More salt than this is not needed. The salting must be done on both sides of the meat, (13)<i> and the insides of poultry must also be salted. In a case where one only salted the inside or outside, or only one side of the meat, it is acceptable. </i>Rema: [20] And there are those who forbid it even post facto, and this is how one should act (14) unless there is a great need. [21] This is only if it was cooked already, but if it wasn’t cooked yet, it may not be cooked as is. [22] Rather, if it is within (15) twelve hours of having been salted one must go back and salt the side that was not salted and then cook it. If it is after twelve hours, then roast the meat [23] and through this process the heat and fire will draw out the blood. The side that was already salted won’t absorb blood from the side that wasn't. ",
            "(16)[24] If one cuts the meat after having salted it one need not re-salt the place of the cut. ",
            "The required salting time is no less than the time it takes to walk a mil, which [25] is about a third of an hour. <i>Rema: [26] This can be relied upon post facto, or even initially in honour of guests or Shabbos. However, in other circumstances the custom is to leave the meat sitting in the salt for at least an hour. One should not deviate from this. </i>",
            "Before one puts the meat into the vessel in which it is to receive its final rinsings [27] the salt should be wiped off or the meat should be sprayed with water, and then the meat should be placed in the vessel to be used for rinsing. The meat is rinsed off twice and the vessel should be <i>sprayed off </i>as well between the two rinsings. [28] <i>And some say that one must rinse off the meat three times, [29] and this is indeed the custom to be followed initially. (17) Therefore, rinse or wipe the meat well and then rinse it in water twice, and this will be considered as a total of three rinsings, or place water in a vessel, and then deposit the meat in that and then rinse it off three times, and this is the custom. Ideally one should use a lot of water in the first rinse so as to nullify the potency of the salt that may be in the tzir/remaining fluids. [30] (17*) It is permissible to rinse the meat in fruit juice, and one does not need water. </i>",
            "If one did not wipe off the salt, nor rinse it we don’t forbid the meat [31] because the water in the vessel will nullify the potency of the salt. Rema: Even if only a small amount of water is used, nevertheless the tzir’s strength will be nullified. Some will even permit the meat if it was placed in a vessel with no water [32] because we need not fear problems in the short period of time used for rinsing the meat, and one may rely on this and not worry except for the first rinsing, after the first rinsing there are no fears. (18) [33] it makes no difference if the rinsing took place in a kosher pot, treifa pot, or even a dairy pot, and even a small amount of water in the pot nullifies the potency of the salt, and it is no longer considered to be 'roseiach'. Even if the vessel is dairy or still dirty from treif remains, it is permitted....",
            "Meat that was salted and then cooked without a final washing must  have a sixty ratio (19) [34] against the salt that is upon it.  <small>Rema: (20) [35] And the entire pot is included in the sixty, [36] and if  there is a piece of meat in the pot of equal size to this piece that was  not washed off, everything is permitted for there must be sixty times  the amount of salt on the piece (21), for the piece is certainly at least  thirty times its salt. And if there is not sixty times against the salt  [37], even if only placed in a <i>kli sheini</i> everything is forbidden (23)  since [38] there is salt and <i>tzir</i>, it has cooked somewhat.  [39] Dried meat can be permitted even in a <i>kli rishon</i>, for it must  certainly be sixty times the size of the salt that is upon it since it has  dried. However, initially one must be careful even with dry meat that it should not be cooked or even washed in hot water without being first washed of it’s salt. All this is referring to a case where meat has not been washed off of it's salt at all, however if even only slightly washed once, and then cooked, it is permitted, post facto, for post facto one washing is sufficient. Salt used once, [40] may not be used again, [41], and it goes without saying that it is forbidden to eat used salt.</small>   ",
            "[42] A non-Jew who works in Jew’s home, who is cooking a piece of  meat that we’re not sure if it was washed off is subject to the following  halacha: If the non-Jew knows Jewish customs, we may believe to say he  washed it off if there was an adult Jew occasionally walking in and out, or  if there was a knowledgeable child. Rema:  One of these is sufficient (24) [43] either mesiach Ifi tumo that he washed  it well, or a Jew, even a child was around walking in and out for he has  some respect for Jewish customs. However if he told the non-Jew not to  wash meat without permission, and the non-Jew went and did so, it is  forbidden for we see that he has no fear and he should not be relied on.   ",

If a piece of meat was not salted (30) properly it is as if it  was never salted. Any meat that stood for three days without having been  salted remains forbidden even if salted and if it is [48] cooked we require  sixty against it.",

[52] Meat should not be left for three days for fear  that it may be cooked.   ",
            "(33) [53] If the meat was soaked in water within three days, it may go  another three days (34) (54) less half an hour. Meat that we are not sure if  it was salted within three days is permitted. ",
            "Meat that was left unsalted for three days [55] and was then mixed up with  other pieces is [56] nullified [57] among the permissible majority, and [58]  all the pieces may be cooked (35) [59] even if it was a chaticha ha’ruya  I’hischabed. This is also the rule for pieces cooked without being salted,  and then mixed with others.  ",
            "(36) [60] Meat covered in blood that was sitting in water for twenty four hours is  forbidden by some unless it is roasted (37) [61] or unless there is sixty in the  water against it, [62] Some even forbid it to be roasted, and this is how we should  act. ",
            "We perform the salting only in a vessel with holes or upon straw or shavings or in  a diagonal position insuring that if water was spilled onto it, it would flow off  immediately. Rema: An especially smooth surface that water would flow from  need not be placed in a slanted position. however if it’s not this smooth it must be placed slanted so that the water flows out. Even in a vessel with holes, one  should be careful to make sure the holes are open, therefore it should not be  placed on the ground, for then it is as a vessel without holes. As a result of this  some people are stringent and place straw or shavings because even the meat  can close up the holes. (38) Post facto, one need not worry about all this. If one  performed the salting in a vessel without holes (39) [63] it is forbidden to use the  vessel with very hot items. Rema: [64] And if it was used then one must take off a  klipah for a dry item, and if it was a liquid we need sixty against the klipah of the  vessel. [66] Some say that even with cold items it is forbidden to use the vessel  unless it is washed down well, and if it was used without first being washed off,  the item used should be washed off. (40) [67] However, it is permissible to re-use  this vessel for salting once holes are made in it (41) [68] or even without holes if  meat has been salted and washed off. ",
            "(42) But if it has holes [69] it is permissible to eat boiling hot food from it, and there are some that forbid boiling hot [70]One should be careful  initially (43) but post facto, it is permitted. ",
            "Meat [71] that was salted in a vessel without holes [72] and was left for as  long as it takes for water to begin boiling is subject to the following rules:  Anything in the tzir is forbidden even for roasting, and what is outside the  tzir is not forbidden [73] expect for a klipah’s worth, even if it is fatty.  Rema: (44) [74] Some forbid the entire piece, even that which is outside  the tzir, even if only salted slightly as is done in preparation for roasting  [75] and even if it was not left for the required salting time rather only for a  little while allowing for tzir to be seen [76] this is the custom, and it should  not be changed. Nevertheless, only the actual piece that is touching the  tzir is forbidden (45) [77] but the other pieces that are upon it and salted  with it are permitted, and this is indeed the custom. ",
            "After meat has been salted and washed, it may even be placed in water that is not boiling [78] and there are those that require it to be placed in boiling water. Rema: The custom is to follow the first opinion. ",
            "Meat that was salted for as long as required and then placed in a vessel without holes without being washed off [79] and then filled up with tzir is permitted. (46) According to this, meat that fell into tzir that came out of the meat (47) after the required salting time is permitted. There are those who forbid it no matter what, and they should be followed initially. Rema: [80] And some forbid even post facto (48) [81] a klipah and this is the custom, regarding that which is in the tzir. However, anything outside the tzir is permitted. (49) [82] The vessel into which the tzir fell is forbidden, [83] Therefore if the vessel was dairy (50) and is dirty, the meat is forbidden since even after the salting time it is considered roseiach [84] however if it is a case of great loss and needed for a mitzvah (51) one may be lenient and say that once the required salting time has passed, it is no longer considered roseiach. (52) [85] According to his words even though meat sat in salt its required time, one may not eat it until it is washed off well. It is forbidden to cut it with a knife before it gets washed [86] and if cut, the knife must be kashered. Rema: [87] And some permit it to be cut with a knife after it went through it’s required salting time [88] for salt can not affect vessels [89] and it is indeed permitted [90] but the knife must be washed off [91] or thrusted into the ground if the tzir has already dried. Even if it is before the required salting time has passed (53) there is no prohibition on the knife, rather the problem is now that blood had come out from the meat to its surface, if one wants to now wash off that spot and go re-salt it one may do so. If one wants to then go and perform a salting in order to preserve the meat after it has been property salted for blood in a vessel with holes, [92] then the meat must be washed off well and re-salted. It may even be re-salted in a vessel without holes. If one wants [93] to salt meat and eat it roasted without washing one may do so and we are not worried about the blood that is on the salt, for the fire sucks out the blood and the salt can not absorb it. This is when it is salted and put on to be roasted, but if it sat in the salt, the salt absorbs blood, and the meat becomes forbidden. Therefore, it must be washed off well, then roasted, and then it may be eaten. See later on in section 76 regarding the law for meat that was salted without being washed off, and then roasted) ",
            "In a place where salt is not easily found, one should roast the meat (54) until its blood has come out, and then one may cook it. "

        [
            "One is permitted to salt many pieces of meat together, one on top of the other,  even though the lower pieces will finish releasing their blood before the upper  pieces. We do not assume that the lower pieces will now absorb blood from the  upper pieces. This is because meat releases tzir for a long period of time and as  long as (1) it is releasing it can not absorb. Even if a lot of tzir is gathering and  sitting in the crevices of the meat, it is permitted. When do we say this rule? When  meat is being salted with other pieces of meat, even if it is meat from one animal  with the meat of another animal, even if it is poultry [1] which can not expel all its  tzir before the meat of an ox can expel its blood. Rema: Nevertheless it is  customary to initially be stringent with a piece of meat that has a pocket and invert  it inside out as to allow the blood to flow out, however post facto one need not  worry, [2] A piece of meat salted twice is permitted [3] and we are not worried that  this second salting will cause it to absorb any remaining blood from the first  salting. However meat with fish, and even poultry with fish are forbidden to be  salted together for fish release all their tzir before even poultry can release its  blood. [4] If one did salt them together, the poultry is permitted, but the fish must  have a klipah removed [5] and if (3) one did not remove the scales when they  were salted - it is permitted. Rema: There are those who forbid all the fish if there  is not sixty against the poultry for we measure all cases of salting with sixty, and  this is the custom. This is only if there are no scales, for they are soft and  immediately release tzir, bur if there are scales it is permitted for they do not  release immediately nor absorb from the poultry because as long as they are in  the process of expelling they won't absorb and it is like any other case of meat  being salted together   ",
            "In which cases is this said? When they were salted together, or if the  poultry was salted and the fish was not. (4) However if the fish is salty and  the poultry is not and they were placed beside each other [6] or on top of  each other, even the fish is permitted without removing a klipah. <i>Rema: (5)  [8] And so too if the fish [9] are placed on the poultry </i>they are permitted  even if they were salted together since the blood does not flow from  bottom to top, and it is no worse then a piece placed in the tzir in which  what is protruding from the tzir is permitted. If the fish were placed beside  the poultry [11] only (6) after the [12] poultry lay in their salt for the required  salting time, then even the fish are permitted even though they are both  salty. [13] If fish were salted in a vessel in which meat was salted, the fish  are permitted (7) for the fish do not absorb the blood in the vessel because  the salting has no effect on a vessel [14] That which we say that the fish  are forbidden if salty and the poultry is salty, is only when the fish [15] had  released all of their blood and have been washed, (8) but if they still did  not release their blood and were never salted, they are permitted because  when they release their own blood, they will release the blood they  absorbed from the poultry just like a piece that fell into tzir before being  salted. It is permitted for this reason as will be explained below. [16] See  further in section 91 regarding which salting is considered as roseiach.   ",
            "(9) Kosher meat that was salted with non-kosher meat, or non-kosher  meat that is salty with kosher meat that is not salty, [17] require the  removal of a klipah if they are touching [18] because even though it does  not absorb from the non-kosher blood, it absorbs from it’s tzir. However, if  the kosher meat is salted and the non-kosher meat is non-salty then it is  permitted even without removing a klipah as long as it is washed. This is  true whether the kosher piece is on the top or on the bottom. (10) There  are those who forbid it if they touch ,[19] and rule that the meat is not  permitted even if they were merely standing close to each other if it  allowed for their juices to touch. Rema: When the non-kosher meat is salty  and the kosher one is not-salty it is still forbidden. [20] See later in section  105 regarding these laws.   ",
            "(11) That in which we say that it is only forbidden to the extent of a klipah  is dealing with cases where the pieces of meat are lean. However if one of  them is fatty, [21] even if the non-kosher piece is lean and the kosher  piece is fatty, the forbidden juice spreads throughout the meat [22] if the  non-kosher salty piece was on the bottom. This is based on the rules of  tatai gavar. [23] See later on in section 105 how one should act.   ",
            "[24] There are those who say that meat that was salted is forbidden to  remain sitting in the salt after all its tzir has been released, which is after  twelve hours. This is because it begins to absorb from the drops of blood  that are upon it and on the salt, (12) There are also those that permit it to  lay in its salt for even several days. Initially one should follow the stricter  opinion. (12) but post facto it is permitted.   ",
            "There are those who forbid placing meat [25] that was not salted at all, [26]  or that was salted and had released all of its blood, with already salted  meat prior to its releasing of its blood. This is because the meat that wasn’t  salted or that was salted and had already released all of its blood now  absorbs what the other piece releases. [27] There are those who permit it  if another salting will take place later since then it will release all of this  newly absorbed blood. (14) [28] And there are those who permit it in any  case. [29] Initially one should follow the stricter opinion. Rema: (15) [30]  Even post-facto we customarily forbid meat [31] that has released all of its  blood and tzir and fell into meat that still did not complete the required  salting time. Some say that meat can release tzir for an entire twenty four  hour period after being salted. (16) [32] If during this time it touched meat  that had not completed the required salting time period, the meat is not  forbidden, and this is indeed the custom. [33] However, if there is no great  loss it should be forbidden if it is after 12 hours, but before this time one  need not be stringent at all, and surely if it had not been salted yet for even  if it had fallen into actual tzir it wouldn’t be forbidden for we say [34] that  when it releases it’s own blood, it will release anything else that it could  have absorbed. Even if the meat has been salted but has not sat for the  required salting time and fell into tzir [35] it may be permitted,[36] if it did  not sit in the tzir for an entire day. [37] If it had sat for the entire salting time  and then fell into tzir, some forbid it even though the releasing of tzir has  not been completed. Nevertheless, in a case of great loss it may be  permitted during the entire time that the meat releases tzir [38] which is  twelve hours [39] if it is re-washed and salted. [40] If it fell into tzir [41]  before the end of the required salting period re-wash and re-salt it. (18)  [42] However, if it was salted without being washed after it had fallen into  tzir [43] it is permitted post facto. All these cases are referring to tzir that  has the status of roseiach as explained in section 69. but blood (dam  b’eyn) that fell on meat [44] during the salting period that is considered  roseiach as explained later on in section 91, causes the meat to be  forbidden, for regarding this blood we don’t say that since the meat is now  in the process of releasing blood, it will release this blood as well, nor do  we say that “as it absorbed so will it release.\" (19) Regarding the case in  which we forbid it when it fell into tzir is only true for the part that is actually  in the tzir [45] but whatever is protruding from the tzir is permitted, [46]  however (20) what is in the tzir becomes forbidden immediately. Meat that  fell into tzir that is on the ground [47] is as if it was in a vessel without  holes. Meat that touched a piece that was salted in a vessel without holes  and became forbidden [48] has the same law as if it had touched tzir. In a  case of doubt of water or tzir, it is permitted, [49] for tzir is of rabbinical  origin so in a case of doubt we are lenient. Tzir mixed with water, [50] even  with only a little water, is no longer considered roseiach and cannot cause  meat to become forbidden. For the laws of soaking see section 105.   "

The thigh bone, as well as other bones that have marrow  inside of them [9] must be salted [10] and the salting of the bone suffices  for the marrow as well. The bone need not be pierced.

There are those who rule  stringently even in a case of it having been salted. [9] and forbid  all meat that was salted with it for they say that we can not  assume the rule of \"as it absorbed, so wilt it release” regarding  blood gathered within it. (6) This is because of the actual blood  and not simply blood that was released from it. (7) [10] The  custom however is to be lenient, and we rule that this blood is  considered blood that was released and it is possible to say that  ׳׳as it absorbed so will it release” since it was blood of the veins,  as was explained earlier in section 22. There are those who are  stringent and rule that a piece must be peeled from the place the  heart was touching. [ 11] It is proper to heed to their words and to peel a bit from anything that was around the heart, making  everything permitted, [12] There is no difference between meat  that is with the heart, or the heart itself. [13] There is also no  difference (8) whether the heart was closed or open at the top. It is  customary to cut the foreskin of the heart and to cut the sinews  inside of it.

If it is not whole and it is lacking  sixty against the heart that is attached (10) [18] some say that the piece  becomes as ‘nveilah', and now sixty is required from the other items in the  pot against the whole bird, and this is indeed the custom. Even if there is sixty in the pot, the bird itself remains forbidden for it doesn’t have sixty  against the heart that is still attached. If the heart is not attached to the  bird, then everything in the pot can combine to achieve sixty against the  heart. See later in section 92 regarding the laws of a piece that becomes  nveilah.

Rema: (2) [3] If one makes many holes in it with a knife, it  is as if cut lengthwise, and widthwise. As well as if the gall was removed  from the liver allowing for the blood to flow out.

Nevertheless, if it is found that the liver was salted, whether alone or with  other meat, even if on top of the meat, everything remains permitted.  Some say that a slice should be cut from around the liver [17] if it is  attached to poultry, and this is only a stringency.

Therefore if the liver is whole and attached to the poultry, the poultry  becomes nveilah, and now sixty is needed against the entire poultry to  permit everything else in the pot. The same is true if you have a piece of  liver attached to a piece of poultry, for we have established that in all  forbidden items chaticha na’asis nveilah as is later in section 92.

However the fat that is upon them is as any other meat.
