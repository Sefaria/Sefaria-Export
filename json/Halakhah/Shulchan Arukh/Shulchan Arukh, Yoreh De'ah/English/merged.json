            "1.\tAll may slaughter (shecht), at the outset, even women . Rema: {There are those that say that women should not be permitted to shecht, as we have already established a custom that (women) are not to shecht, and thus the tradition (holds) that women do not shecht.} Slaves and anyone, even if you do not know that he does not faint (because of shechting), even if you do not know if he is an expert that knows the laws of shechita (kosher slaughter), it is permitted from the outset to let him shecht and it is permitted to eat from his shechita. This is because the majority of those that regularly shecht are under the presumption of being tested experts (in shechita). What situation are we talking about here? (We are talking about  a situation) where that person is not in front of us, only then is it permitted to eat from his shechita, and we rely on the presumption (referenced to above). However if he is before us we need to check him, if he is an expert and knows the laws of shechita, however we do not need to ask if he faints. Rema: {There are those that say that one should only rely on the presumption after the fact,and that initially the presumption should not be relied upon if you are in a place where you can clarify him (the Shochet's [kosher slaughterer's] abilities). All this applies to those that aren't proficient and need to know if this Shochet is proficient. But the Shochet himself shall not shecht, even if he knows the laws of shechita and is proficient, until he has shechted 3 times in front of a learned man and one that is proficient in the laws of shechita. Therefor we practice that a man shall not shecht without having obtained kabalah (ordination) from before a learned one.      And the learned one should not give kabalah until he knows that he (the Shochet) knows the laws of shechita and is proficient with his hands. Therefor we practice that all who come to shecht we trust them initially and we don't check them before or after. Because all that are found to be shechting have already received kabalah from before a learned one. And in a few places they are more stringent. That the one who received (kabalah) also gets a written letter from the learned one, as proof that he has given him kabalah. And every Shochet, even though he has recieved kabalah, it is fitting that he should return to the chapters of laws of shechita. That they (the laws of shechita) should live in his mouth and in his heart, so that he will not forget them. And like in the laws of shechita and with one that comes to shecht thus is the ruling in the laws of bedikaht hare'ah (checking the lungs for disqualifying sickness) and one that comes to check (the lungs). And their (shechita's and behikah's) rules and customs are all equal in all of this. And it is fitting for a Jewish court to investigate and the bodkim (checkers of disqualifying sickness) and shochtim (kosher slaughterers). Because large is the transgression in bedikot and shechitot, that are applicable to all. And if they checked some Shochet or bodek and it is found that he does not know, if at one time he received kabbalah we do not deem all everything he has shechted in the past to be treif (unkosher), for we say that only now did he become bad. But if one has never received kabalah, everything that he has shechted will become treif, and also all the dishes on which what he shechted was cooked would need to be kashered}...",

Rema: {And we check him about the laws of shechita that will be explained later in the beginning of S23 and in the rules of checking of the knife and in the rules of checking the simanim after shechita that will be explained in S25. And if he shechts and is not here in front of us to check, we none the less check the simanim to see if the majority of them was shechted, because whatever is possible to check we do. And this is all in places where there is not a custom to get kabbalah, but in places where the custom is to get kabbalah, like the sons of Ashkenaz and others that follow them, we do not customarily check after him at all, as will be explained (later)}...",
            "3.\tA person who we know that he does not know the laws of shechita, even if he shechts in front of us 4 or 5 times a proper and fitting shechita, and afterwards shechts privately his shechita is not kosher. Even if they ask him, \"did you do such and such?\" and from his answer it seems he shechted correctly, we do not rely on him. And even if he says \"It is clear to me that I shechted beautifully.\" Rema: {a person who regularly faints, and we know he is not muchzak (established as not fainting), and he shechts and says \"It is clear to me that I did not faint\", (he is) believed. This is because he knows the laws of shechita.} And someone who we know does not know the laws of shechita, we can let him shecht if someone supervises him. This is only if he watches him from the beginning of the shechita until the end of it (the shechita). Rema: {And some are strict and forbid to let him shecht lehathila (initially). This is because he does not know the laws of schechita, and thus is the practice.}.",

Even if others are standing over them. And if they (none the less) shechted, their shechita is kosher if others were standing over them. But we do not allow them to shecht lehat’hila when others are not stand standing over them, even if we want to feed (the meat) to dogs. If a minor knows how to train his hands, if others are standing over him, he can shecht lehat’hila and it is allowed to eat from his shechita. Rema: { However, if he shechts for himself, than his shechita is disqualified, even if he knows the laws of shechita; he is considered a minor with regards to this matter (of shechita) until he has become bar-mitzvah, which is 13 years and 1 day [old]. There are those that are strict to not give kabalah to anybody less than 18 years old. For then he is a “man with wisdom”, and knows to be careful.}",

Also there is concern that perhaps he might cut elsewhere on the gullet. And even if he does not lift up his knife but for a moment, there is still concern since the amount pausing in fowl is very small. Accordingly if he slaughters most of one of the sign in the fowl, he should do so quickly.

Anyone who \"breaches the fence\" to eat meat without checking the lungs should be bitten by a snake.  Rema- We have the custom to also inflate every lung, even if there is nothing wrong with it.

The sircha is not considered \"in order\" except when it is connecting two lobes one next to the other from chituch (flat side overlapped by the neighboring lobe) of one to the chituch of the other, even if the sircha is diagonal or penetrates into the neighboring lobe. However, if the sircha goes from the back of a lobe to the back of the neighboring lobe or even from the chituch to the back of the neighboring lobe, or from the outer edge of the lobe to the outer edge of the neighboring lobe or from the edge of the lung to chituch of the other, or even from the point of one to the point of the other that is next to it, or even from the point of one the chituch of the other that is next to it, it is called \"out of order.\" Rema- There are those who say that even when the sircha is \"in order\" it needs to be checked to make sure there is no hole in the lung. Because we are not experts in checking for things that can be problems one should consider any sircha (including \"in order\") treifa, and there are those who say it is kosher if the sircha extends from the origin of the lobes up to the middle of them (by width) even if it is open on both sides.

We do not assume that the lower pieces will now absorb blood from the  upper pieces. This is because meat releases tzir for a long period of time and as  long as (1) it is releasing it can not absorb. Even if a lot of tzir is gathering and  sitting in the crevices of the meat, it is permitted. When do we say this rule? When  meat is being salted with other pieces of meat, even if it is meat from one animal  with the meat of another animal, even if it is poultry [1] which can not expel all its  tzir before the meat of an ox can expel its blood. Rema: Nevertheless it is  customary to initially be stringent with a piece of meat that has a pocket and invert  it inside out as to allow the blood to flow out, however post facto one need not  worry, [2] A piece of meat salted twice is permitted [3] and we are not worried that  this second salting will cause it to absorb any remaining blood from the first  salting. However meat with fish, and even poultry with fish are forbidden to be  salted together for fish release all their tzir before even poultry can release its  blood.

Rema: There are those who forbid all the fish if there  is not sixty against the poultry for we measure all cases of salting with sixty, and  this is the custom. This is only if there are no scales, for they are soft and  immediately release tzir, bur if there are scales it is permitted for they do not  release immediately nor absorb from the poultry because as long as they are in  the process of expelling they won't absorb and it is like any other case of meat  being salted together   ",

If the fish were placed beside  the poultry [11] only (6) after the [12] poultry lay in their salt for the required  salting time, then even the fish are permitted even though they are both  salty. [13] If fish were salted in a vessel in which meat was salted, the fish  are permitted (7) for the fish do not absorb the blood in the vessel because  the salting has no effect on a vessel [14] That which we say that the fish  are forbidden if salty and the poultry is salty, is only when the fish [15] had  released all of their blood and have been washed, (8) but if they still did  not release their blood and were never salted, they are permitted because  when they release their own blood, they will release the blood they  absorbed from the poultry just like a piece that fell into tzir before being  salted.

This is  true whether the kosher piece is on the top or on the bottom.

Rema: (15) [30]  Even post-facto we customarily forbid meat [31] that has released all of its  blood and tzir and fell into meat that still did not complete the required  salting time. Some say that meat can release tzir for an entire twenty four  hour period after being salted. (16) [32] If during this time it touched meat  that had not completed the required salting time period, the meat is not  forbidden, and this is indeed the custom. [33] However, if there is no great  loss it should be forbidden if it is after 12 hours, but before this time one  need not be stringent at all, and surely if it had not been salted yet for even  if it had fallen into actual tzir it wouldn’t be forbidden for we say [34] that  when it releases it’s own blood, it will release anything else that it could  have absorbed. Even if the meat has been salted but has not sat for the  required salting time and fell into tzir [35] it may be permitted,[36] if it did  not sit in the tzir for an entire day. [37] If it had sat for the entire salting time  and then fell into tzir, some forbid it even though the releasing of tzir has  not been completed. Nevertheless, in a case of great loss it may be  permitted during the entire time that the meat releases tzir [38] which is  twelve hours [39] if it is re-washed and salted. [40] If it fell into tzir [41]  before the end of the required salting period re-wash and re-salt it. (18)  [42] However, if it was salted without being washed after it had fallen into  tzir [43] it is permitted post facto. All these cases are referring to tzir that  has the status of roseiach as explained in section 69. but blood (dam  b’eyn) that fell on meat [44] during the salting period that is considered  roseiach as explained later on in section 91, causes the meat to be  forbidden, for regarding this blood we don’t say that since the meat is now  in the process of releasing blood, it will release this blood as well, nor do  we say that “as it absorbed so will it release.\" (19) Regarding the case in  which we forbid it when it fell into tzir is only true for the part that is actually  in the tzir [45] but whatever is protruding from the tzir is permitted, [46]  however (20) what is in the tzir becomes forbidden immediately. Meat that  fell into tzir that is on the ground [47] is as if it was in a vessel without  holes. Meat that touched a piece that was salted in a vessel without holes  and became forbidden [48] has the same law as if it had touched tzir. In a  case of doubt of water or tzir, it is permitted, [49] for tzir is of rabbinical  origin so in a case of doubt we are lenient. Tzir mixed with water, [50] even  with only a little water, is no longer considered roseiach and cannot cause  meat to become forbidden. For the laws of soaking see section 105.   "

But if they placed a drinking vessel between themselves, and if not for this purpose it is not normal for it to be on the table, it would be a sign even if they drink from the vessel. And of course if they place on [the table] a candelabra or other items on the table that they are [valid] signs. And they should be careful not to drink from a single vessel because food sticks to the vessel. And of course they should not eat from the same bread. And so is our custom to have individual salt-vessels for each person themselves, because sometimes when they dip into the salt there remains leftovers of the food in the salt.</i>"

            "One who eats meat, even of a wild animal or fowl, does not eat cheese afterwards until he waits six hours.  Even if he waits that period, if he has meat between his teeth he has to remove it.  One who chews food for a child has to wait. <i>If afterwards he finds meat between his teeth and removes it, he has to wipe his mouth out before eating cheese (Ran chapter 25).  There are those that says  that he doesn't have to wait six hours, but rather immediately if he finishes the meal and says the concluding blessing, it is permissible after wiping and rinsing his mouth (Tosafot Hullin 105a - \"At the next meal\", Mordechai chapter 25, Haga'ot Ashri, Haga'ot Maimoniot chapter 9 of forbidden foods, and Ravya).  The simple custom in our countries is to wait after eating meat one hour and to eat cheese afterwards, but you have to say the concluding blessing after the meat (HaAruch, Haga'ot Shaarei Dura) because then it's like a new meal and permissible to eat according to the lenient view.  But with no blessing, waiting alone does not good.  It doesn't matter if you waited before the blessing or afterwards (his own reasoning, from the Mahari, as opposed to the Issur v'Heter).  If he finds meat between his teeth after the hour, he has to pull it out (his own reasoning, from the Ran above).  And there are those that say not to say the concluding blessing in order to eat cheese (Aruch in the name of Maharach) but we're not careful about this.  And some are careful to wait six hours after eating meat before eating cheese, and it's proper to do so.</i> ",

One must clean one's mouth and rinse it out. One cleans it by chewing bread, thereby thoroughly cleaning his mouth with it, and one can do this with anything that one chooses, except with flour, dates, or vegetables, because they attach to the palate (the area above the esophagus close to the teeth) and do not wipe well. Afterwords one should rinse ones mouth with water or wine. This was all stated in regard to meat of domestic or wild animals, but if one wishes to eat poultry after cheese there is no need for cleaning or rinsing.       Comment (Ramah): some are stringent (to wait six hours) even with meat after cheese (Mordechai in the name of the Maharam and Bet Yosef, Bach siman 173) and so is the custom with hard cheese, we do not eat afterwords even poultry, like with cheese after meat (and so it is in the Zohar).

However, there is [reason] to wash ones hands between them, and this is even [in a case where] one didn't eat actual meat but rather only a cooked dish made with meat after a cooked dish made with cheese if he touched them with his hands.

And if one tore it lengthwise and widthwise, and pressed it against a wall until there no longer remains the moisture from the milk, it is permitted to cook it with meat.

And if it was roasted with meat, if it was torn lengthwise and widthwise and pressed against a wall, both of them are permitted, and if not, the top one is permitted and the bottom one is forbidden. And we don't forbid both of them [from the concern] that maybe the spit flipped, because after the fact we don't make it forbidden. But, from the onset we don't roast it with meat at all.

And if there are not there any substantial pieces of the forbidden item, but rather its taste alone, even if there is a much of the forbidden item and a little of the permissible item, it is permissible if it is only a little detrimental. And there is one who <i>hokheikh</i> (the meaning is [this <i>posek</i>] hopes to be stringent, and he forbids) to say that if the forbidden item has raised the measurement of the permissible one until it is better when it is eaten in its measure than how much it worsens in missing its flavor, forbidden until [the point at which] is becomes unfit for human consumption. About what things do we speak, those that make detrimental from beginning to end, but those that [initially] improve [the flavor] and at the end make it worse, or [a food that] makes worse [initially] and at the end makes better, [these items are] forbidden. <small>NOTE: There are those who say that even though the forbidden item gives a taste [that is] detrimental and the food is permitted, in any event the pot is forbidden, and if one cooked in it within 24 hours a food that the original forbidden item will got a positive taste, the second food is forbidden if there were not 60 parts against the first forbiddenness. But if one stirred the first mixture with a spoon, and afterwards thrust the spoon into the second mixture that it will also be detrimental to that, then the pot is not forbidden. And likewise, for a thing that does not have any taste at all, for example the cauldron in which one melts honey, even if there are bees’ legs in it, the cauldron is not forbidden and other things like this.</small>",

The law the roasting is only forbidden a n'tila applies in cases like a sinew roasted with the hind leg, because the sinew is lean (or thin) and therefore it does not have the strength to spread to the entire piece. However, a fatty sinew that is roasted with its fat, if there is not in the entire sinew 60 against all the fat, it is forbidden to eat even from the tip of its ear, because shuman is spread completely (until 60). But if it is lean, even though there is not 60 against all the fat, it is only forbidden a thumbnail's worth since the fat of a lean animal is also lean. Even if the forbidden piece is lean and the permitted piece that is roasted with it is fatty, the issur (forbidden) will be spread throughout. Anything that has the ability to spread, and we know the exact place it fell during roasting, even though there is 60 to nullify the issur, that area is (still) forbidden a thumbnail's worth. (Mordechai in the name of several sages, and the Smak, and the Issur v'Heter Rule 14 and iggur in the name of the Maharil). <i> Rama: Anything cooked without gravy or baked has the law of roasting (Tur and Beis Yosef). And there are those who say that we are not experts in knowing what is lean and what is fatty, therefore we forbid in all cases until 60. Even if there is 60, the area of contact is forbidden a thumbnail's worth (Aruch) and this is the custom. This (law) is specifically (applied to) fats, or other issurim that can be considered fatty. However, in a case where the issur is not at all fatty, and without question it is lean, the area of contact is only forbidden a thumbnail's worth.

But if the oven is large enough to hold 12 <i>esronim</i>, and its mouth is open, then it is permitted to roast them in it as long as they do not touch one another. And if one of them is covered with a bowl or with dough or the like, it is permitted to roast them, even in a small oven with a closed mouth. <i>Comment: The same is true for meat with milk - the ruling is also thus. And it is customary to be strict before the fact, even with a large oven, and after the fact to be lenient even with a small oven. But, if one baked a loaf of bread with meat, it is forbidden to eat it with milk if he has another loaf. And thus if an idolator baked a loaf of bread with something prohibited, it is prohibited to buy that loaf if he has another loaf - because all this is an instance of \"before the fact.\" But if he has no other loaf available, both are permitted, because this is an instance of \"after the fact.\" There are some who say that we do not permit on the basis of smell not being an issue, even after the fact, unless the oven is open from the side or above where the smoke can escape. But in a case of financial loss we are not stringent after the fact, even if the oven is completely closed. If the prohibited thing is pungent, and all the more so if the permitted thing is pungent, smell is an issue and even after the fact it is prohibited, if the two of them are uncovered. But if one of them is covered, even as is common with dough, it is permitted. If they baked or roasted a prohibited thing and a permitted thing under one (covered) frying pan, uncovered (from one another) this is prohibited even after the fact. The same is true if they baked a loaf of bread with meat in such a manner, it is prohibited to eat it with milk. But one after the other there is no concern, unless there was sweat from the pan in both of them, because this is like the cover of a pot. There are some who say that any time we say smell is an issue and prohibit after the fact, that is specifically because there is not 60 times as much of what is permitted as what is prohibited. But if there is 60 times what is permitted, even among everything that is in the oven, the prohibited thing is nullified. And for the sake of loss this is the custom. Three are some who say that a prohibited thing that prohibits something, for example leavening on Passover, smell is an issue and it prohibits even after the fact, if the oven is small and closed, and the prohibited thing and the permitted thing are uncovered within the oven.

Rema: Initially, it is necessary for the Jew to be there are the beginning of the milking and check to make sure that the bucket is empty and does not contain non-kosher milk. And it is our custom to be stringent and not milk with vessels which are usually used for milking by non-Jews, lest some of their [non-Kosher] milk remain in the vessel. In any case, after the fact there is no need to be concerned for this. And regarding maidservants that milk domestic animals in the Jew's house or in his [animal] pen, any instance in which it is not a house of a non-Jew, that is enough and there is no need to be concerned about a non-kosher matter, and it is permitted even initially to leave them to milk even there is not a Jew around, because the non-Jewish milker is in his house or neighborhood, they are not suspected of milking non-kosher animals. But if a non-Jew takes a break, the Jew needs to be there, because it is like the case of the non-Jew's house. And even a Jewish child will suffice, because the non-Jew appears before him. In any case, if a Jew is not present until after he has finished milking, this milk is considered the milk of non-Jews that is forbidden, even thought no non-kosher animal exists in his herd. Milk of a non-Jew makes vessels non-kosher when they are cooked in them, just as any prohibited food, even though this is only an uncertainty whether he has mixed in something non-kosher. And so too with non-Jewish cheese, but not non-Jewish butter, even in a place where it is considered prohibited it does not prohibit vessels when cooked, and it is not a problem if it becomes mixed; if it is mixed in that which is permitted, everything is permitted, like above regarding the bread of non-Jews. See above in chapter 112. Milk of non-Jews that is forbidden, it will not work to make it into cheese or butter afterwards, rather it remains forbidden, and everything that is made from it is forbidden.",

And if a Jew oversaw the making of the cheese, but not the milking, it is permitted after the fact, because there is no concern that perhaps something non-kosher was mixed in after the cheese was made from the milk, because non-kosher milk will not allow the cheese to form, and of course the non-Jew did not mix anything in once he knew it was for making cheese. And in any case, it is forbidden to eat such milk.",

Rema: Also it is permitted to cook it in this fashion initially in order to get the milk solids. And if a non-Jew cooked it, it is permitted, because most vessels have not been used in the past 24 hours. And if one goes from a place where this is not eaten, to a place where they do eat it, he should eat it with them, but it is forbidden to bring it with him and eat it in a place where they are accustomed to forbidding it.

And one who goes from a place where this is forbidden, to a place where it is permitted, it is forbidden to eat it there.

And this can only be done in temporary circumstances such as when he is in the house of an idol-worshipper or it is after the fact. But if he wants to use these vessels on a regular basis, there  are some who are stringent and say that even to use it with cold, dunking in boiling water or whitening through heat is required. It is decreed lest once come to use it with hot, and this is our custom. And even vessels which were used for cold, if there is a concern that they were used to heat wine such as a vessel made of silver, our practice is to dunk in boiling water and it should not be changed. And even chests and tables which were acquired from idol-worshippers, it is our custom to dunk them in boiling water, for they may have spilled something hot on them, and this is specifically from the outset, but after the fact there is no need to worry about all of this. And an earthenware vessel which was used for cold, which is impossible to dunk in  boiling water, we consider 'after the fact' and we say that it is enough to empty it and scrub it well, and it is permitted to place in it afterwards even sharp foods like vinegar and others like that.

And every single thrust must be into hard ground. Therefore one may not thrust into a place where there was already another thrust. And even if you cut a sharp food like a raddish this is sufficient (REMA: And to use it regularly don't diminish that which is done for other vessels, for which we dunk in boiled water even for cold). (As it was explained) if there are dimples (or) you want to cut something hot or slaughter [with the knife], whiten it through fire, or sharpen with a whetstone of a blacksmith well on every surface. GLOSS: There are those who say that sharpening this way is only to cut something cold, not something hot, and this is the custom a priori. And if you are not able to whiten the knife through fire well because of the handle, whiten it through fire and dunk in boiling water after. However, if you whitened but did not dunk in boiling water, even if there are dimples, or if you dunked but did not whiten and there are not dimples and you cut something warm it won't be forbidden even if the knife has been used in the previous day, and if you sharpened it well with a whetstone in every place, and dunk it in boiling water afterwords it is effective like whitening through fire if you are able to clean the dimples in it.

A vessel which is not bat yoma, meaning that the vessel has sat for 24 hours since prohibited substance was cooked in it, this gives a detrimental taste, but even so, the sages forbade cooking in it initially. This is a decree on account of a bat yoma [vessel], whether it absorbed [taste] from a forbidden substance and one wanted to cook something permitted in it, or whether it absorbed some dairy and one wanted to cook meat in it, or the opposite [it absorbed some meat and one wanted to cook some dairy in it].",

There are those who say that the negative taste created by the passing of 24 hours is only relevant when the utensil is washed well and all unwanted residue is removed, however if it was not washed well and the unwanted residue is present (be-en),  24 hours does not make the food stale (pagum). Rashba, Tur, and Raavad: Rama: Nevertheless if there is 60 times the food which is present (be-en) the mixture is all permitted because that which was swallowed in the walls of the pot became stale (pagum) and does not require bitul. (this is also implied in siman 95) There are those who say when cooking  sharp food, we don't say the food swallowed in the wall has a status of stale as explained above in Siman 95 and 96. Therefore if you cooked in a forbidden pot a dish which is mostly vinegar or spices  or other sharp foods, it is forbidden. However we don't consider the dish sharp if it only contains a small amount of spices. (Mordechai 81:40 and Rashba Siman 449) And this is the custom. Look above in Siman 95 and 96. However if the forbidden food was sharp and the pot rested for 24 hours and you cooked something permitted in it which is not sharp, the food is permitted because the first sharp food doesn't revitalize forbidden taste.

            "Shulchan Aruch: All of the transgressions which are in the Torah, with the exception of idolatry, sexual prohibitions, and murder: If someone is told to transgress them or he will be killed, so long as he is in private, he should transgress and not be killed. If he wants to be stringent upon himself and be killed, he may do so if the idolater intends to make him violate his religion. Rama: If he can save himself with all he has, he must give it all rather than transgress one of the negative commandments (Ran in Sukkah, Perek Lulav haGazul, and Rashba and Raavad and Rivash Siman 387). When they [Chazal] said that anyone who has the ability to protest and does not, he is seized in the same sin - here, where there is a chance of danger, he does not need to give up his money over this (Mahariv Siman 156). Shulchan Aruch: If he is in public - that is, in front of ten Jews - he must allow himself to be killed rather than transgress, providing the idolater intends to make him violate his religion (even if this is over a minhag such as the way one ties one’s shoes) (Beis Yosef). But if he [the idolater] intends only for his own benefit, he [the Jew] should transgress rather than be killed. If, however, it is a time of legislation (only against Jews) (Beis Yosef in the name of the Nimukei Yosef), even about the strap of one’s shoes he should be killed rather than transgress. Rama: And this is only if they wish to make him violate a negative commandment; if they made a law that one should not fulfill positive commandments, however, he does not need to fulfill it if he will be killed (Ran Shabbos Perek BaMeh Tomnin and Nimukei Yosef Sanhedrin Perek Sorer uMoreh). Nonetheless, if the hour requires it and he wishes to fulfill it and be killed, he may do so (Maharik Shoresh 88). Shulchan Aruch: And by idolatry, sexual prohibitions, and murder, even in private and not a time with legislation and even if the idolater intends it only for his own benefit, he must be killed rather than transgress. Rama: And this is only when they tell him to do an action: for instance, if they tell a man to transgress a sexual prohibition or he will be killed. If they force a woman to have sex or throw him over a child to murder it or he is already erect and they force him to have forbidden sex, he need not be killed (Beis Yosef in the name of Tosfos and Ran Psachim Perek Kol Sha’ah). All prohibitions of idolatry and sexuality and murder - even if they are not punishable by death, just prohibitions without explicit punishment - he must be killed rather than transgress. On the prohibition of “Do not put a stumbling block before the blind” he may transgress rather than be killed (Ran Psachim Perek Kol Sha’ah and Sanhedrin Perek Ben Sorer uMoreh). An idolater sleeping with a Jewish woman is not included as a sexual prohibition (Beis Yosef in the name of the Ramban and the authorities cited above). Idolaters who told a Jew, “Give us one of you so we may kill him” - they may not give him over unless they [the idolaters] singled him out and said, “Give us Ploni” (Mishnah Trumos 8, Rambam Yesodei haTorah 5). There are those who say that even in this case, one should not give him over unless he is already liable for death like Sheva ben Bichri (Beis Yosef in the name of Rashi and the Ran). Likewise, women who were told by idolaters, “Give us one of you so we may rape [lit. make impure] her” - they must all be raped rather than hand over one Jewish life (Rambam ibid). Any place where it is said, “Be killed rather than transgress,” if he transgressed and was not killed, even though he has desanctified the Name, nonetheless he is considered forced and is not liable. This is only where he could not have fled - if he could have fled, and did not do so, he is like a dog sitting on his vomit and is considered to have transgressed deliberately (Beis Yosef in the name of the Rambam Yesodei haTorah 5).",
            "Shulchan Aruch: It is forbidden for a man to claim that he is an idolater so that they will not kill him; if, however, so that they will not know he is a Jew, he changes his clothes during a time of legislation, this is permitted, since he does not say that he is an idolater. Rama: Even if he must wear shaatnez (Nimukei Yosef Bava Kama Perek haGozel (the second one)). Even though it is forbidden to say that he is an idolater, nonetheless he may say things that can be interpreted multiple ways (Nimukei Yosef Bava Kama Perek haGozel) and the idolaters will understand that he has said that he is an idolater while he means something else. Likewise, if he can trick them so that they will think he is an idolater, this is permitted (Trumas HaDeshen Siman 197). In the same vein, one who desires another man’s wife - if his wife can sleep with him such that he will believe he is sleeping with the forbidden woman, this is permitted (ibid in the Nimukei Yosef). All of this is permitted only where there is a danger, but where there is no danger - for instance, he wears idolaters’ clothes so they will not recognize that he is a Jew so that he can avoid the tax or suchlike - that is forbidden (Hagahos Ashiri and Nimukei Yosef Bava Kama Perek haGozel (the second) and Trumas haDeshen Siman 196 and other authorities).",

And how many are the days of her ritual impurity? Now, in this time, all of the childbearers are considered as those delivering in a flow and require to count seven clean days; it follows to say that one who delivers a male sits seven for the birth and seven clean (day)s for the blood-flow, and one who delivers a female sits two weeks for the birth and seven clean (day)s for the blood flow.

Likewise, the law is that if she sees blood for 2 or 3 days and subsequently stops seeing blood, she should do an internal examination on the day she stopped seeing blood in order to establish her tahara status. This internal examination should be done just prior to the onset of halachic twilight (ie. just before sunset). [And this is the way one should ideally act; but if, after the fact, even if she only did an internal examination in the morning and found no blood, that would suffice.] A person should always teach his wife to [be stringent for the ideal ruling and] do internal examination on the day she stops seeing blood using a compressed wad of cloth which should be inserted for the entire time of halachic twilight, because this type of internal examination frees us from doubt. [Gloss: There are authorities who say that if the local community has prayed the evening prayer while it is still early in the day, a woman is no longer able to do an internal examination and begin counting and wearing her white garments the following day, because of the fact that the local community has already established it as nighttime. There are also authorities who say that she would be permitted to do so even if the local community had accept the Sabbath; our practice is to ideally be stringent, but after the fact one does not have to worry about the stringent opinions. There are some women who act as follows: If she did an internal examination before the Chazzan says \"Barchu\" (at the evening service which the local community said while it was still daytime), but then during the course of her days of counting she saw some blood (and had to start her count over with a new internal examination) in that situation she would be able to do an internal examination even after the Chazzan says \"Barchu\" (at the evening service which the local community said while it was still daytime) if this blood was seen close to the onset of nighttime. This practice is not considered ideal, but one should not protest women who behave this way as they have received this ruling from a sage who ruled this way for them, and it is an old custom.]",

On the following day she begins counting her seven blood-free days. [Gloss: It is an upright practice that before a woman does the internal examination that she wash herself and wear white garments. Even if she only washes her genital area, that is enough. This is the way our communities act and one should not depart from this practice; however, in a dire situation, such as a woman who is going on a trip and doesn't have (white) clothing, she is still able to begin counting her seven blood-free days. She should, however, do her best to wear clothing which have been checked beforehand and found free of any blood stains.

But, if she didn't do any internal examinations during the entire seven days but only did an internal examination on the eighth day and found it to be clean from blood, she can only begin counting from the eighth day (ie. the eighth day becomes the first day).

It is not sufficient for her to merely wipe herself and enter the vaginal cavity slightly. If she finds it very difficult to insert the cloth to such a depth, at the very least she should do so for the internal examination of the day on which she sees her bleeding stop and the internal examination on the first day of her seven blood-free days. [Gloss: But, if she did not do so for the internal examination on the first day of her seven blood-free days, she should do so for at least one of the internal examinations of the remaining days. However, after the fact, if she didn't do any internal examinations to such a depth, but she did check the crevices and openings within the vaginal cavity well as deep as she is able, even though she didn't reach the depth that the male organ reaches during intercourse, it is sufficient.]",

One who establishes presumed sightings for these women, should do so according to the rules for all other women. If they do not have an established day of presumed sighting, they must be careful for the 30th days from the previous sighting and be examined by mentally sound women.",

            "The seven blood-free days must be consecutive days on which she does not see blood. If she saw blood even at the end of the seventh day, all the previous days are cancelled and she must do a hefsek tahara to re-establish her status and start counting a full seven blood-free days again. [Gloss: There are authorities who say that during the first three days of her seven blood-free days if she finds a stain we do not attempt to hang it on an outside source in order to be lenient in the way that we attempt to hang other stains, because the first three days should be completely clean, but on the subsequent days stains which are found may be treated like all other stains, and this is the way we behave. And this is specifically referring to a stain which is larger than the size of a \"gris and more\", but a stain which is smaller than this size can be blamed on a louse even within the first three days. This is also true if she has a wound on her body which she knows is actively bleeding, in this case she would be able to blame a stain which is larger than a \"gris and more\" on this wound. During the first three days, however, we would not blame a stain on a wound which she is not sure whether it is actively bleeding or on other things which we would normally attempt to blame a stain on, as is outlined in Section 190 above.]"

Rather, one should make his Torah fixed and his work contingent, and should reduce business and engage in Torah.  He should put aside temporary pleasures from his mind and do work all day for his livelihood if he does not have enough to eat, and the rest of the day and the night he should engage in Torah.  And it is a great quality to generate one's sustenance from the work of his hands, as it says, \"The product of your hands you shall surely eat\" (Ps. 128).  Anyone who puts in his mind occupying himself with Torah and not working, but supporting himself from tz'dakah, behold, this one desecrates the Divine name and dishonors the Torah.  For it is forbidden to derive benefit from words of Torah, and any Torah that does not have work along with it, it attracts sin and he winds up robbing people.  And all of this applies to one who is healthy and can engage in his work or in a profession a little and provide for his livelihood.  However, an elder or a sick person is permitted to derive benefit from his Torah such that they will provide for him.  And some say that it is permitted even for a healthy person.  And therefore the practice in all Jewish communities has been that the Rav of the city has an income and provisions from the other people of the city, so that he will not have to engage in work in front of other people, so that the Torah becomes degraded in front of the multitude.  And [this applies] specifically to the sage who needs it, but for a wealthy person it is prohibited.  And some are more lenient, saying that it is permitted for a sage and his students to accept subsidies from those who donate in order to strengthen the hands of those who study Torah, since in this manner they can engage in Torah in affluence.  Nevertheless, one who is able to provide for himself well from the work of his own hands and to engage in Torah, it is a pious quality and a gift of God, but this is not the nature of all persons, for it is impossible for everyone to engage in Torah and to become wise in it and to provide for himself by himself...."

            "It is a positive commandment for a master to circumcise his slaves, If the master fails to circumcise them then it is a mitzvah on the Beit Din to circumcise them. A slave boy born in a Jewish household or one purchased from an idolater, you are (still) required to circumcise. A slave not born in your home is circumcised the same day, even if you acquired him the day he was born, you circumcise him the same day. There are slaves who are purchased  that are circumcised on the eighth day as well as slaves born in your home that you circumcise the same day. What do we mean?Should one purchase a maidservant and purchase the rights to her fetus (separately), when she gives birth, the baby should be circumcised on the eighth day.Although the fetus itself was purchased alone, since he purchased the mother before the child was born, the child should be circumcised on his eighth day.If one acquires a maidservant or her offspring or one acquires (purchases) a maidservant with the intent of not immersing her for the sake of slavehood, even though her offspring is born in his home, the child should be circumcised on the day he was born,This is because the child is considered as if he alone had been purchased , and it is as if he purchased him this day.His mother is not among the maidservants of the Jewish people, so that the child could be considered home-born slave. And if she immerses after she gives birth,  the child should be circumcised on the eighth day. Although the fetus itself was purchased alone, since he purchased the mother before the child was born, the child should be circumcised on his eighth day. If one acquires a maidservant or her offspring or one acquires (purchases) a maidservant with the intent of not immersing her for the sake of slavehood, even though her offspring is born in his home, the child should be circumcised on the day he was born, This is because the child is considered as if he alone had been purchased , and it is as if he purchased him this day.

For this reason we need impose any form of servitude on him while in the water, so that it will look like he is a slave, if not beforehand he will say, I am immersing  for sake of becoming a free man.

When an agent brings a bill of release from one place to another in the land of Israel, he does not have to testify that it was written and signed in his presence. And in the diaspora, if there are no witnesses present to verify the authenticity of the bill of release, and the agent states that it was written and signed in his presence, its authenticity is considered as verified.

When the master wrote in each legal document: \"All my property is given to so and so and so and so, my slaves.

Thus, he is half slave and half free man. When does the above apply? When the master released half of the slave (with a bill of release) and retained half. If, however, he sold half the slave and gave away the other half after, whether the liberation was through the selling or as a gift likewise whether the sale preceded it or after the release the slave acquires half of his person, and acquires or accepts the other.

A maid-servant, however, should remain in her immediate state and serve her herself one day, and the master the next. If a man strikes her on the hand and it withered, but it will eventually return and heal, if he struck her on a day she was serving her master he is liable for the damages if on another day she is liable, however if he severs the hand, as well as all any body part that does not return or heal itself, the portion of the damage is split between her and her master.

So he transferred him to his minor son, For no beit din can force his son to release the slave, however the court can appoint a guardian for the minor who will entice the child with coins and then the guardian will write a bill of emancipation in the child's name. And certainly like this intentionally take away the enactment of the sages, however if the father dies and minor son inherits his half, we do not appoint a guardian to the minor in order to free the slave, (what do we do) The slave will remain only half free and thus work for himself one day and one day for the minor until he (the minor) grows up (and the court could then compel him.) ...",

If he says, I know this and I will still become a part of your people, receive him immediately and tell him the principles of the faith, that God is one and idol worship is forbidden, and tell him a lot about this, and teach him a few of the lighter mitzvot and a few of the more stringent mitzvot, and teach him about some of the punishments of the mitzvot, as it says, \"Before you came to learn this, if you ate the forbidden fat, you would not be punished with excommunication, you transgressed Shabbat and you were not punished with stoning; but now, if you eat forbidden food, you will be punished with excommunication; and if you transgress Shabbat you will be punished with stoning.\" Don't say too much about this, and don't get too specific either. And when you teach him about the punishment of the mitzvot, also teach him about the rewards of the mitzvot and teach him that in the doing of certain mitzvot that will merit life in the world to come. There isn't a complete righteous person, rather a master of wisdom, that does the mitzvot and understands them. And say to him: \"You should know that the world to come is hidden from the righteous, who are Israel. As for what you see that Israel is in distress in this world, because it is not granted them to receive the abundance of good things in this world like other peoples, lest their hearts should be indulged loftily and they should go astray and squander the reward of the world to come. But God didn't bring to them too much destruction, so that they would not observe. Rather, all of the idolators stand. And you explicate this idea so that he feels the dearness of it. If he receives this, circumcise him immediately and wait until he is fully healed, and afterwards, immerse him without a barrier. <i>(Some say that you cut or shave his hair and you cut his fingernails and his toenails before immersion.)</i> And three learned scholars stand at his back and teach him some of the light mitzvot and some of the more stringent mitzvot a second time, and he stands in the water. And if it is a woman, women sit her in the water up to her neck and the beit din is outside and they teach her some of the easy mitzvot and some of the more stringent mitzvot and she sits in the water and afterwards, she immerses before them and they turn their faces and leave in order that they do not see her when she is getting out of the water, and they bless the immersion after she comes out of the water. And once he has immersed, it is as if he is a Jew, but if he goes astray, he is like an apostate Jew - he is still sanctified, and his marriage is sanctified.",

So this all applies to the immersion and the circumcision but it does not apply to receiving the mitzvot, which prevents [conversion] unless it was during the day and in front of three [witnesses]. However, the Rif and the Rambam [say that] even after the fact [one who] immersed or was circumcised before two [witnesses] or at night prevents [conversion], and [marrying] an Israelite woman is forbidden.

Whether he is a minor who is converted on behalf of his father, or whether he was converted by a beit din [in the absence of a father], when he is older he can protest his conversion - we don’t treat him the way we would treat an adult convert- he is not like an apostate Jew, rather like an idol worshipper.",

But if you see them behaving in customs worthy in the way of Israel and they do all of the mitzvot, they are presumed to be righteous converts, in spite of the fact that there were no witnesses to bear witness about who converted them. And if this is the case, if they come to mix [marry] into Israel, do not marry them until the witnesses come, or until they are immersed before us, since they initially had a known status as idol worshippers. However, one [whose status was never known] who comes and says that she is an idol worshipper and was converted by a beit din, believe her, for the mouth that forbids [and admits, “I am an idol worshipper” when she didn’t have to] is the mouth that permits [and says “but I was converted by a beit din.”]. And the Rambam writes that this ruling only applied in former days, and even then, only in the land of Israel, but outside the land one needs to bring evidence before he can marry an Israelite - because [the Sages] enhanced the strictures when it came to lineages [in Jewish communities outside Israel].

And if he is a man, check after him perhaps he placed his eyes on a Jewish woman.  And if she is a woman, check after her perhaps she placed her eyes on the single men of Israel.  And if you do not find to them [such] a cause, inform them of the weight of the yoke of the Torah, and the  difficulty of fulfilling it on the nations of the world in order that [the potential converts] leave.  If they accept and do not leave, and you see them that they are returning out of love, accept them.  And if you did not check after him or you did not inform him of the rewards of the commandments and their punishments, and he was circumcised and immersed before three ordinary people, this is a convert.  Even if you are informed that it is because of some thing (like those discussed above) that he converted, since he was circumcised and immersed he has left the category of Idol Worshippers (i.e. Non-Jews), and we are worried for him until his righteousness is clarified.  And even if he returns and serves Idols, he is like an apostate Israelite that his marriages are marriages.  [Rama]: An apostate Israelite that repents does not need to immerse.  Just that rabbinically he should immerse and accept words of joining (strict observance) before three. "

And in any case, the practice to take an olive-size (Maharil). And the one [i.e. priest] who eats challah, even in the Diaspora, blesses first according to the type [of food] that one wants to eat, and after than blesses \"who makes us holy with the holiness of Aaron and commands us to eat terumah [a contribution]\". And there are those who say that when they burn challah, they make an inference because of it that an Israelite [i.e. non-priest] is forbidden to derive benefit from it (Maharik, and so also in Tosafot \"Kol Sha-ah\"), and they practice to throw it into the oven before they bake the bread."

            "<b>LAWS OF RENDING GARMENTS</b><br>One who suffered a bereavement, namely, [one] of [his] near-of-kin<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> <i>infra</i> § 374.</i> [died], for whom he is required to observe mourning rites, must rend [his garments] for him.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">M.K. 24a: ‘A mourner who does not rend his garments, is guilty of a mortal offense.’ The requirement is Rabbinical and the Rabbis gave it support by reference to a Biblical verse — <i>ShaK.</i> It is customary that another person rends the garment, for then the mourner endures more grief, and on seeing a stranger rend his garment, and remaining silent he thereby acknowledges Divine Justice. The stranger must not rend more than is required. Otherwise, he is held responsible for damages. Even when the mourner himself rends the garment, he must not rend more than the law requires. If he rends more, he transgresses the law forbidding one to ruin anything wantonly (v. Deut. XX, 19) — <i>P.Tesh.</i> One must also rend garments when he collects the bones of a near-of-kin — <i>G.Mah.</i> (v. <i>infra</i> § 403, 2). The benediction recited when rending garments must contain the <i>‘Divine Name’</i> and the word <i>‘King’</i> — <i>Bir. Yos.</i></i> One must rend [his garments] while standing;<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">M.K. 20b, derived from the verse, <i>‘Then Job stood up and rent his mantle’</i> (Job I, 20).  also II Sam. XII, 31.</i> and if one rent [his garments] while sitting, he has not discharged his duty;<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">M.K. <i>ibid.</i></i> <i>and he must rend again</i>.<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tur</i> citing <i>Ghayyat; Asheri; Hag. Maim.; B.Yos.</i> according to opinion of <i>RaBaD; N; Mord. M.K. III</i> — <i>G.</i> Some authorities state that if he had already rent in a sitting position, the reading is considered valid.  <i>A.H.</i></i> <i>In the first instance one must rend</i> [<i>his garments</i>] <i>before he conceals the face of the corpse</i>.<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>B.Yos.</i> citing <i>SeMaK</i> — <i>G.</i> Cf. <i>supra</i> § 339 according to which the mourner rends his garments when he reaches the words, ‘<i>Judge of Truth</i>.’ There is no contradiction between these rulings, since the former rule is in accordance with the custom to recite the <i>Ẓidduk Haddin</i> when the soul departs — <i>Ba’er Heteb.</i> If one has not rent garments after death, he may still do so throughout the seven days of mourning, for during this period it is still regarded as a ‘moment of excitement’ (v. M.K. 24a).</i>",
            "The region for rending is all along the neck of the garment in the forepart; but if he rent in the back part, <i>or in the lower parts of the garment</i>,<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tur</i> — <i>G.</i></i> or on the sides, he has not discharged his duty.<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">M.K. 26b.  Yad, <i>Ebel</i> VIII, 1. Likewise if the garment is rent widthwise, one does not discharge his duty — <i>P.Tesh.</i></i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>Some say that one discharges his duty if he rends in the lower parts of the garment; and thus is the common practice to adopt the more lenient view</i>, [<i>viz.</i>,] <i>to rend in the lower parts of the garment</i>,<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These customs you will find in <i>SeMaK, MaHaRIW, Ḥid. Agud.</i> and <i>Kol Bo</i> — <i>G.</i></i> <i>when rending for all other dead, for whom one does not observe mourning rites;</i><sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When one is present during the departure of the soul — <i>ShaK.</i></i> <i>but for near-of-kin, for whom one must observe mourning rites, he does not discharge his duty with this rending, but must rend in the neck of the garment. And thus is the common practice</i>.<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>SeMaK</i> on the basis of Sem(H). IX, 18: ‘One who rends in the lower parts or on the sides of the garment has not discharged his duty. R. Judah says, that he has discharged his duty.’ In the case of other dead, who are not his near-of-kin, we accept R. Judah’s view.</i>",
            "The extent of rending is a handbreadth.<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">M.K. 22b: ‘Said R. Abbahu, what text teaches this? <i>Then David took hold on his clothes and rent them</i> (II Sam. I, 11), and there is no taking hold of anything by less than a hand-breadth. Cf. Suk. 32b; Nid. 26a.</i> If he rent [his garment] upon suffering a bereavement, and extends the rent, on sustaining another bereavement; if [the second bereavement] is after the seven [days, the additional rent] may be as small [as he wishes]; if during the seven [days], a handbreadth is required.<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">M.K. 26b.  <i>infra</i> par 21.</i> However, for his father and mother, [after having suffered a previous bereavement], even after seven [days], he rends until he bares his chest.<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">M.K. <i>ibid.</i>  <i>infra</i> par. 18 and 2</i>",
            "Just as he rends for his near-of-kin, for whom he observes mourning rites, so does he rend in the presence of his near-of-kin, when the latter sustains a bereavement. In what respect?

            "For a scholar or a disciple who is questioned on a matter of <i>Halachah</i> in any reference and is able to answer it, one rends garments,<sup>36</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tur</i> from <i>Asheri</i> who derives this from <i>RaBaD</i>, based upon the case of R.

Safra for whom the Rabbis did not rend their garments. Their reason was that they did not learn from him directly. When Abaye reported to them the teaching that when a scholar dies all are considered his near-of-kin, the Rabbis took the view that what was done was done. However, Abaye said to them, ‘we learnt that if a scholar dies, as long as they are still engaged in a lament for him one is dutibound to rend garments for him. Hence, the ruling here. This is also derived from the case of Samuel (<i>ibid.</i> 24a) who, when informed that Rab died, rent thirteen garments for him, and said that the man before whom he trembled is gone. The same was done by R. Joḥanan when the death of R. Ḥanina was reported to him.</i> if it is within thirty days [from death];<sup>38</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i> 20b. If he did not rend garments for him at the time the death report was brought to him, he must rend at the time the lament is made, provided it takes place within the thirty days from death; but after the thirty days one does not rend even at the time that the lament is held — <i>ShaK.</i></i> and one rends [garments] for him at the time of his lament.<sup>39</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i> 25a, ‘A scholar is honoured at the time of the lament.’</i> <i>If one did not rend</i> [<i>garments</i>] <i>on the day the</i> [<i>death</i>]-<i>report</i> [<i>is received</i>], <i>and the time of the lament had already passed and he</i> [<i>still</i>] <i>had not rent, he no longer rends</i>.<sup>40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus implied in <i>Tur</i> and <i>B.Yos.</i> — <i>G.</i> This follows also from the case of R.

In such a case only do we apply the aforementioned principle, ‘There is no rending without mourning.’ However, when near tidings are received during <i>Ḥol ha-Moed</i>, when rending garments is permissible (v. <i>supra</i> par. 31), he rends even if it becomes distant tidings after the Festival. For the Festival merely interrupts the mourning rites but not the rending — <i>Ta</i>Z and <i>ShaK.</i></i>",

Consequently, he mends the rent — <i>Ta</i>Z and <i>ShaK.</i></i> and returns the garment to him and compensates him for the damage done by the rent.

This is applicable only to a case where one suffered a loss on the Sabbath before the night set in, so that the obligation of reciting the evening <i>Tefillah</i> never took effect. If, however, the loss was sustained after the night had already set in, in which case the obligation of reciting the evening <i>Tefillah</i> had already taken effect prior to the occurrence of death, one must recite the morning <i>Tefillah</i> twice — <i>D.Merb.</i>  <i>P.Tesh.</i> for further comments.</i> and this is not similar to the case of one who forgot to recite the evening <i>Tefillah</i>, who may recite the morning <i>Tefillah</i> twice,<sup>30</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> O.Ḥ §. 108, </i> since he was not dutibound to recite the <i>Tefillah</i> during the [previous] night.<sup>31</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Derisha</i> holds that similarly one who occupies himself with communal needs which interfere with the prescribed time to pray is exempt from a complementary <i>Tefillah</i> at the following service (v. previous note). For in both cases, viz., in the case of the sustained loss mentioned above, and in the case of preoccupation with communal needs, there is unavoidable interference. <i>Ta</i>Z opposes this and makes the following distinction between the two cases : In the case of a sustained loss the interference is a result, not of the individual’s incapacity to recite prayers, but rather of external circumstances, namely, the <i>Aninuth</i> which exempts him. Under such conditions one is not required to recite a complementary prayer at the following service. But in the case of preoccupation with communal needs, the individual proper is busily engaged. Hence, he is dutibound to make up the prayer when he becomes free. <i>Nek. Hak.</i> refutes <i>Ta</i>Z and agrees with <i>Derisha</i>, by showing that both cases are on an equal footing insofar as in both instances the individual is legally exempt on the principle that, ‘One who is engaged in a religious act is exempt from other religious duties’ (Suk. 25a). When, however, the person is legally not exempt, but there it an unavoidable interference, the <i>Tefillah</i> is temporarily suspended until the following service at which time a complementary prayer is said.</i> With respect to the <i>Habdalah</i>, one should recite [it] after the corpse is buried.<sup>32</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>R.

The words, ‘anytime during the week,’ are explained to mean until after the third day is ended. Cf. <i>ibid., Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>אמימר</span> and O.Ḥ. § 299, 6. <i>Asheri</i> in his <i>Resp.</i> accepted the ruling which he followed in a similar case (v. <i>supra</i> n. 26). Later in his <i>Decisions</i>, he abandoned this view and accepted the view of R. Judah (<i>ibid.</i> Cf. <i>Tur</i> a.l.) who held that one should not recite the <i>Habdalah</i> after (burial.  <i>Ta</i>Z <i>infra</i> § 396 who disagrees with both views and advances another explanation. After burial when the <i>Habdalah</i> prayer is recited it is said only over a cup of wine without the fragrant spices and the candle. If the bereavement was sustained on a Festival day, the <i>Habdalah</i> prayer may be said only on the following day after burial, but not as in the case of the Sabbath where the law is that it may be said even until the third day. An <i>Onen</i> who was ignorant of this ruling and recited the <i>Habdalah</i> on the night following the Sabbath is not required to recite it again after burial — <i>P.Tesh.</i> On the question whether an <i>Onen</i> who has a child to be circumcised should perform the circumcision before or after burial, a difference of opinion exists among the <i>Codifiers. RaShaL</i> maintains that the circumcision should be performed first. <i>Isserles</i> (in <i>Resp.</i>) holds that first the burial should be held, for being an <i>Onen</i> he cannot recite the benediction, ‘Blessed art Thou … and commanded us to introduce my son into the covenant of Abraham our father.’ <i>Ta</i>Z rules that if possible, the burial should be held in the morning. However, if this is not feasible, the circumcision is performed first and the <i>Sandek</i> recites the benediction, and it matters not whether the circumcision is held during the prescribed time, i.e., on the eight day or later. <i>Ḥatam Sofer</i> accepts <i>RaShaL’s</i> ruling. <i>Bir. Yos.</i> and others agree with <i>Ta</i>Z. A <i>Kohen</i> who is an <i>Onen</i>, and there is no other <i>Kohen</i> available, may officiate at the redemption of a firstborn.

If he is regularly called to the reading of the Torah, he may called up even when he is an <i>Onen</i> (i.e., on the Sabbath).

If there is apprehension that the <i>Onen</i> may have contracted a contagious disease through his contact with the corpse, he may bathe and change his garments — <i>Sede Ḥemed.</i> On cutting the hair, v. <i>Ta</i>Z <i>infra</i> § 398 from which it seems that he may cut his hair prior to burial.

All the laws of <i>Aninuth</i> apply to the weekday of the Festival (<i>Ḥol ha-Moed</i>) — O.Ḥ. § 548.

The same is applicable to a Reader of the Torah — <i>Beth Leḥem Yehudah.</i> An <i>Onen</i> is forbidden to recite the Priestly Benediction. On the question whether an <i>Onen</i> may search for leaven on the night of the fourteenth of <i>Nisan</i> preceding the Passover Festival, the law is that he should appoint another person to do this for him. The <i>Onen</i> may, however, recite the declaration <span>כל חמירא</span> — <i>Bir. Yos.</i> He may not recite the <i>Haggadah</i> himself but may hear it from another person. If another person is not available, he may recite it himself — <i>Pri Megadim.</i> He must eat <i>Maẓẓah</i> and drink the four cups at the <i>Seder</i> service — <i>MaHaRaM Lublin.</i> On <i>Ḥanukkah</i> the lights should be kindled, and the benediction pronounced, by another person. If another person is not available, he may kindle the <i>Ḥanukkah</i> lights himself without pronouncing the benediction —<i>Eliya Rabba.</i> An <i>Onen</i> does not count the <i>Omer</i> during the night of his <i>Aninuth</i> period. But on the next day after burial he counts the <i>Omer</i> without reciting the benediction, and on the following nights he continues to count the <i>Omer</i> with the benediction.

Otherwise, the wedding should be postponed. <i>ShaK</i> rejects this on the ground that a loss will still be incurred even if only part of the preparations were completed.</i> [viz.,] he baked his bread and prepared his meat and mixed his wine,<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Their wine was too strong to be taken undiluted.</i> and the father of the bridegroom<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Who made the preparations for the wedding-feast.</i> died, and he was in a locality where it is unlikely to sell [the food], and should the wedding be postponed he will lose whatever he prepared; or the mother<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It was she who prepared the bride’s trousseau.</i> of the bride died,<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ket. 3b-4a. Even if the groom’s mother died or other near-of-kin, in which case there is still his father available to make all the preparations at a future date, nevertheless, since the bride has no one available to make her preparations in addition to the loss involved at present, the wedding is not postponed, and they are brought into the bridal chamber as stated anon. Nowadays if a parent dies the wedding is postponed until after the seven days of mourning — <i>Ba’er Heteb, Ḥatam Sofer.</i> On the eve of Passover after midday it is permissible for a groom or bride who are in mourning to be married, since with the advent of the Passover Festival and the period of counting the <i>Omer</i> that follows it is forbidden to hold marriages. This is in accord with <i>Isserles’</i> ruling (v. <i>infra</i> § 399) that after midday on the eve of a Festival mourning rites have no legal effect, <i>contra ShaK</i> (<i>ibid.</i>). This applies to a groom who was never married before and did not yet comply with the duty of propagation — <i>Zekor le-Abraham, Net’a Sorek.</i> If they suffered a loss after the marriage was already performed, the groom must not perform the marital act until after the seven days of mourning, after which, follow the seven days of the wedding-feast (v. <i>infra</i> § 383). One who was in a dying condition and instructed his daughter’s marriage to take place and he died after the dutiful marital act had already been performed, the law is that the daughter is not permitted to attend the funeral, since it is already regarded as a Festival period for her, and were she to attend the funeral, it would be considered tantamount to observing mourning rites publicly on a Festival which is forbidden — <i>P.Tesh.</i></i> and there are womens' perfumes and toilet [prepared] which are not durable,<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>RaN ibid.</i> Cf. <i>Rashi ibid.</i> s.v. <span>ואביו של חתן</span>.</i> — [<i>the law is that</i>] <i>since there is no one</i> [<i>available</i>] <i>who will prepare for them a second time</i><sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Derived from Gemara <i>ibid.</i> — <i>G.</i></i>, they bring the corpse into a room and the bridegroom and the bride into a bridal chamber, and he performs the dutiful marital act and [then] separates [himself from her and they bury the corpse forthwith].<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gemara <i>ibid.</i> This applies even if he married a woman who was married before. If the death occurred after the bride’s head was covered, the seven days of the wedding-feast take effect. Thus <i>Derisha</i>, but is rejected by <i>Ta</i>Z.</i> However, since the marital precept rests upon him, it is regarded as a Festival day for him, and he observes [first] the seven days of the [wedding-] feast,<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The law is that on the first day mourning rites are Rabbinical (v. <i>infra</i> § 399, 13). Hence, he is permitted to observe first the seven days of the wedding-feast, for were the first day of mourning Biblical, ‘matters pertaining to joy’ would be forbidden — <i>ShaK.</i> Cf. <i>G.Mah.</i> and <i>R. A. Eeger</i> a.l. It may be asked, however, how is it possible for the seven days of the wedding-feast to override a case of Biblical mourning, for the day of death and burial is considered Biblical (it is only when the burial is not held on the same day as death that the first day of mourning is Rabbinical)? This difficulty may be removed because the first day of a groom’s marriage is considered Biblical, for it is written, <i>‘In the day of his espousals and in the day of the gladness of his heart’</i> (Song of Songs III, 11) — <i>Asheri.</i> Although an <i>Onen</i> is forbidden the use of the conjugal couch (v. <i>supra</i> § 341), the Rabbis were lenient in this case and put it on an equal footing with one who had given up hope of burying his dead in which case he is permitted to eat meat and drink wine and use the conjugal couch — <i>RITBA.</i></i> and after this he observes the seven days of mourning.<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As to the question of rending garments, there is a difference of opinion among the authorities. <i>MaHaRIL</i> (Laws of Mourning) states that the garments are rent after the seven days of the wedding-feast. <i>She’elath Yabeẓ</i> maintains that garments should be rent forthwith since it is not a Biblical Festival. <i>Sede Ḥemed</i> accepts <i>MaHaRIL’s</i> ruling. <i>Mishmereth Shalom</i> agrees with <i>Yabeẓ.</i></i> And the entire seven days of the [wedding-] feast he observes matters pertaining to private [mourning], and he is forbidden to use the conjugal couch.<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yad, <i>Ebel</i> XI, 8. <i>Tur</i> on the authority of <i>RaBaD</i> writes that he is only forbidden to use the conjugal couch or to be alone with her, but the mixing of the cup, the making of the bed and the washing of his face, hands and feet are permitted to be done in each other’s presence. <i>ShaK</i> rejects this on the basis of numerous sources in the Talmud and Codes and extends the prohibition to embracing and kissing as well.</i> Therefore, the entire seven days of the [wedding-] feast and the seven days of mourning, he sleeps among the men and she sleeps among the women.<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ket. <i>ibid.</i> According to our ruling today (v. <i>supra</i> c. 193 end) that after the dutiful marital act she is considered a <i>Niddah</i>, no guarding should be necessary.

Jewish dead are forbidden to be put to profitable use, Biblically; heathen dead only Rabbinically — <i>P.Tesh.</i></i> or an Israelite, his shrouds are forbidden [to be employed] for profitable use,<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is deduced from the similar expression ‘there’ used both in connection with the heifer whose neck was to be broken (Deut.

Just as the heifer was forbidden to be employed for profitable use, so also in the case of a dead person and his shrouds, the same prohibition applies — <i>ShaK.</i>  A.Z. 29b.

This prohibition stands even if only one of the above reasons applies. <i>Ḥatam Sofer</i> rules that even if one agreed during his lifetime that after he dies an autopsy be performed on him, it is still forbidden. Others, however, permit under these conditions.

But if there are no special groups arranged to carry the bier, only those who are in proximity of the bier are exempt, since they participate in carrying the bier, but not those who are at a distance — <i>M.Abr.</i> and Mishna Ber. <i>ibid.</i></i> and the others who follow the corpse, who are not needful for the bier, are not exempt.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> O.Ḥ. § 72 — <i>G.</i> Although escorting the dead (<span>הלוית המת</span>) is a religious duty which falls into the category of ‘deeds of love’ (<span>גמילות חסדים</span>) which is Biblical and should alone suffice to exempt one from the reading of the <i>Shema</i>, yet, since those who merely escort the dead are not regarded as being busily engaged or troubled (<span>טרודים</span>), they can manage to read the first verse of the <i>Shema</i> in a standing position with the proper intention, and the rest of the <i>Shema</i> while walking.

Hence, in the morning, since the time for reading the <i>Shema</i> in the first instance (<span>לכתחילה</span>) is ‘when one sees his friend at a distance of four cubits and recognizes him,’ until the ‘sparklings of the rising sun’ appear (Ber. 9b; O.Ḥ. § 58, 1; § 89, 1), a corpse may be taken out for burial at least half an hour before this period. Otherwise, we apprehend that there will be insufficient time to complete the burial and read the <i>Shema</i> in time — <i>Disciples of R. Jonah</i> (Ber. 19a). In Y.Ber. III, 2(6b) one hour is mentioned, which is explained (v. <i>R. Jonah ibid.</i>) to mean, as long as there is sufficient time to complete the burial before the prescribed period arrives. Hence, ‘close to’ does not refer to the half hour period. In Y. <i>ibid.</i> the following question is raised: Since we learn in the following Mishna (Ber. <i>ibid</i>.): ‘When they have buried the dead and returned, if they can begin (the <i>Shema</i>) and complete it before reaching the (mourners’) line, they begin it; but if they can not, they do not begin it,’ it follows that the <i>Shema</i> is never read during the time that the corpse is borne for the purpose of burial (for as we have seen one must take the corpse out for burial prior to the prescribed time for reading the <i>Shema</i>). Consequently, we may ask, why does the Mishnah make a distinction with respect to the <i>Shema</i> at the time the corpse is carried out for burial? In order to remove this apparent difficulty, Y. <i>ibid.</i> explains that it applies only to a case where they thought that there was ample time to complete the burial before the prescribed time for reading the <i>Shema</i> arrived, and they erred. In Ber. <i>ibid.</i> it is stated that it refers to a distinguished person who may be taken out for burial even close to the prescribed period for the reading of the <i>Shema.</i> The custom today is to take out the corpse for burial after the morning Service at the Synagogue is over, so that many people will be able to attend the burial — <i>B.Hillel.</i> Cf. <i>G.</i> anon.</i> whenever there is no time to bring him out [and] to bury him before the time for the reading of the <i>Shema</i> arrives; but if they had [already] commenced to bring him out, they do not desist<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> <i>supra</i> n. 3.</i> in order to read [the <i>Shema</i>].<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ber. 19a; Y.Ber.

It is only in the case where the wedding ceremonies had already taken place that visiting the house of mourning takes precedence over the wedding-feast that follows the marriage. This applies only if the duty of attending the wedding-feast will not be neglected entirely, but should one not be able to attend to both, as a result of which, one precept will be completely neglected, attending the wedding-feast takes precedence. Cf. however, Yad, <i>Ebel</i> XIV, 8 according to which a bride takes precedence over a corpse only where the two processions meet each other, but otherwise, one must attend to the needs of the corpse first — <i>A.H.</i>  also <i>B.Yos.</i> and <i>W.G.</i> who had a different reading in Sem. <i>ibid.</i></i> [<i>If</i>] <i>a groom and a mourner are in the Synagogue, the groom and his friends</i><sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">His groomsmen or attendants.</i> <i>leave first and then the mourner and the comforters; and thus</i> [<i>also</i>] <i>their guests may eat with the groom if they so desire, and not with the mourners</i><sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Or if they wish, they may eat with the mourners — <i>A.H.</i></i>,<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>B.Yos</i> on the authority of <i>Hag.

III, 19). Cremation is forbidden according to Jewish Law.  <i>Beth Yiẓḥak</i>; <i>Eben Yekarah; ‘Arugoth Habosem; Imre Yosher</i> and others who strongly prohibit cremation. One who left instructions to be cremated after death is regarded as one who dissociates himself from the practices of the Congregation and is considered a heretic.

Hence, the thickness of the wall of the grotto was half a cubit. Accordingly, some rule (v. <i>R. A.

This follows the opinion of the First Tanna in the Mishna ibid. <i>Caro</i> here and in <i>B.Yos.</i> seems to rule in accord with the opinion of R. Simeon b. Gamaliel (<i>ibid.</i>  <i>W.G.</i> a.l.) that everything depends upon the quality of the intervening earth or rock. If it is hard, one may make more sepulchral chambers, since less intervening space for the walls would be required. On the other hand, if the earth is soft, more space would be required for the intervening walls. Hence, the number of grottos would be less. <i>P.Tesh.</i> states that the custom to bury the dead close to each other stems from the fact the land available to us for cemeteries is quite limited.  <i>Ta</i>Z § 364, n. 2. <i>A.H.</i> rules that legally no specific thickness for the intervening wall is required.

            "A built grave is forbidden for profitable use, but natural<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lit. ‘world.’</i> earth of a grave is not forbidden.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">San. 47b regarding the earth of Rab’s grave. This is derived (<i>ibid.</i>) from, <i>‘And he cast the dust thereof</i> (i.e., of the <i>Ashera</i>) <i>upon the graves of the common people’</i> (II Kings XXIII, 6) whence we learn that the graves of the common people are compared to idols. And just as idols are not prohibited when they are attached, as it is written, <i>‘Ye shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nations that ye are to dispossess served their gods, upon the high mountains’</i> (Deut. XII, 2), i.e., their gods which are <i>upon</i> the high mountains (are forbidden for use), but not the mountains which themselves are their gods, — so too, whatever belongs to the dead, i.e., attached, is not prohibited. However, a built grave is not considered attached to the soil, and as in the case of detached idols, is prohibited (v. <i>supra</i> § 145, 3).  Meg. 29a and <i>infra</i> § 363, 1, according to which even natural soil of burial grounds is forbidden for profitable use and consequently contradicts the present ruling. <i>B.Hillel</i> therefore, explains that in our case (Gemara San. <i>ibid.</i>) where it is reported that Samuel permitted people to take earth from Rab’s grave and apply it as a remedy on the first day of an attack of fever, we deal with natural soil taken from a grave and applied as a remedy only, which is permissible; whereas in the other passage (Gemara Meg. <i>ibid.</i>) the natural soil was not used for a remedial purpose, and consequently, is forbidden for profitable use, not because legally this is so, but rather because this is considered disrespectful treatment of the dead.

A.H.</i> elucidates the ruling here as follows: An object originally loose and subsequently attached (<span>תלוש ולבסוף חברו</span>) is forbidden only if it was removed from one place and attached in another place, as in the case of idols. For this reason a built grave is forbidden for use. Not so, however, in the case of earth which was dug out for burial purposes and then put back into the same grave. In the latter case it should be considered ‘natural soil’ <i>contra R.

            "If they found a slain Israelite, they may bury him [in the same condition] as they found him, [viz.,] without shrouds, and they do not even remove his shoes.<sup>37</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>B.Yos.</i></i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>Thus they do</i> [<i>with respect</i>] <i>to a woman in confinement who died, or regarding a person who fell down</i><sup>38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">E.g., from a roof top.</i> <i>and died</i>.<sup>39</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>MaHaRIL</i> s. 65 — <i>G.</i> If there was bleeding, the <i>Tohorah</i> (v. Glos.) should not be performed, for the blood which also requires burial (v. <i>infra</i>) will thereby be removed. The dead person should therefore be buried in his clothes. This applies only if the person died while wearing his clothes, but if after suffering a fall, the person was confined to bed and died some days later, after his clothes were removed, and there was no bleeding, the <i>Tohorah</i> is performed and the corpse is wrapped in shrouds as usual. There is however, a distinction to be made between the case of one who fell from a roof top and one who was murdered. In the latter case, even if the blood flow had ceased when the corpse was found, he is buried in the condition he was found in order ‘to raise our anger’ and possibly avenge the slain person; whereas in the former case where the person fell from a roof top, this is not applicable. Similarly, in the case of a woman who died in confinement, and the blood flow still continues, we bury her in the garments she wore at the time of death. But if death occurred some days or weeks later, at which time the blood flow had already ceased, we deal with her as with other dead and bury her in shrouds. A further reason for burying a slain person in his clothes is that there is fear that at least a fourth of a <i>Log</i> (v. Glos.) of blood that escaped, — the smallest quantity required to sustain life, — is absorbed in the clothes. Hence, he should be buried in his clothes. For the very same reason even the shoes should not be removed, since there may be a similar quantity absorbed in them. Even the earth surrounding him, which absorbed blood, should be buried. The same principle would therefore apply to one who fell from a roof top, or in the case of a house which collapsed upon a person, or a confinement case, where there was a flow of blood, and consequently there is an absorption thereof in the garments, — in all these cases, since there is an absorption of blood in the garments, — they should be buried with the corpse. This would not apply to one who froze to death or was drowned, for since there was no flow of bloood, they are buried in shrouds as usual — <i>MaHaRIL</i> (<i>ibid</i>.), <i>Ta</i>Z and <i>ShaK</i>.  <i>P.Tesh</i>.</i> <i>Some say that they wrap them over their garments</i> [<i>with</i>] <i>shrouds</i>.<sup>40</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Hag.

The minimum size of such an exit must be one handbreadth square for an olive’s bulk from a corpse in the room, to prevent uncleanness from spreading to the other exits, and a minimum of four handbreadths square opening will prevent the uncleanness from spreading to the other exits in the case where an entire corpse is present in the room. The reason for the different sizes regarding the openings, depends upon the size of the uncleanness, for it is feasible to remove an olive’s bulk from a corpse through an opening one handbreadth square, and an entire corpse through an opening four handbreadths square (v. also Ohol. VII, 3); b) If there are two adjoining houses or rooms and in the intervening wall there is an opening of one handbreadth square, and in one of the houses or rooms there is a corpse or an olive’s bulk from a corpse, the uncleanness passes to the adjoining room or house in which all objects become unclean. In this case the opening need not be more than a square handbreadth in order to give passage to the uncleanness of an entire corpse; c) An object (e.g., a board) which is one handbreadth square and one handbreadth high (i.e., between the board above and the olive’s bulk from a corpse which lies beneath, there is a space of not less than one handbreadth), brings uncleanness to other objects in the same space and forms a partition against uncleanness to objects above it. But if the roof (i.e., the top of the board) is less than one handbreadth high, the uncleanness breaks through the solid matter and rises and goes down. Cf. Ohol. VI, 6; VII, 1-2; IX, 13, 14, 16; X, 6-7; XII, 6-7; XV, 1, 3, 7. <i>ShaK</i> states that the wife of a <i>Kohen</i>, who is pregnant may enter the ‘tent of a corpse’ and there is no fear that she may give birth to a male child who would then be forbidden to be present there, for a double doubt exists: a) perhaps it will be a non-viable birth to which this apprehension does not apply, or b) if it is a viable birth, perhaps it will be a female child. This point, however, is questioned on the principle that ‘a clean object that has been swallowed (in this case, the child within the mother) cannot be rendered unclean’ (<span>טהרה בלועה</span>) (Hul. 71a). Consequently, the following explanation of the above case is offered: We deal here with a case where the time for giving birth has already approached, and there is fear that the child might push out its head and be regarded as born and hence is not regarded as a ‘swallowed object.’ Consequently, since there is a double doubt, the pregnant wife of the <i>Kohen</i> may enter the ‘tent of a corpse’ — <i>P.Tesh.</i> Uncleanness is not conveyed through many openings which together make up one square handbreadth, e.g., in the case of trellis-work. The square handbreadth must be open in one spot for the uncleanness to pass through. Otherwise, the opening is considered stopped up (cf. Ohol. XIII, 1) — <i>Ta</i>Z, <i>ShaK.</i></i> But if one stopped up the opening, it is permissible for him to enter the other [adjoining] house, for the closure forms a partition [against the uncleanness], even if one has not renounced ownership therein<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">e., in the object which serves as a closure.</i> so that it remain there forever.<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Mishna and Gemara Shab. 157a and <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>,הלקטי קטנה</span>. Cf. Meg. 26b. This applies only if one stops up the opening with a vessel that does not contract uncleanness (e.g., a wooden object that is not considered a vessel if it is intended merely for resting things thereon (<span>כלי עץ העשוי לנחת</span>) but if one stops up with foodstuffs even the entire opening, he must renounce his ownership therein — <i>P.Tesh., R. A.

Samson of Sens</i> and <i>Maim</i>. to Ohol. VI, 2 and cf O.Ḥ § 629, 8. <i>Ta</i>Z reports the ruling of a certain authority in the following case which he analyses and rejects: There was an uncleanness in a house adjoining a Synagogue, which passed through the [Synagogue window in the women’s section, and a ruling was given by a certain authority, that in order to form a partition against the uncleanness, the window opening should be stopped up by the curtain which served as a partition between the men’s and women’s section, and was suspended on iron hooks. <i>Ta</i>Z opposes this ruling (v. however, <i>Ḥid. ha-Gershuni</i> who accepts it) and claims that it is erroneous for the following reasons: a) According to the Mishna Ohol. VIII, 1, a sheet or a mat form a partition against uncleanness only if spread out tentwise, which is not the case here, and hence, the curtain cannot form a partition against the uncleanness of the adjoining house (v. <i>R. Samson of Sens ibid.</i> and Yad, <i>Tumath Meth</i> XIII); b) The reason that the curtain cannot form a partition against the uncleanness is because the law states that vessels (in this case the curtain hooks) cannot form a partition, since the curtain without the hooks would not remain suspended. Consequently, the main items are the hooks and not the curtain (v. Yad <i>Tumath Meth</i> XVIII; B.B. 19b s.v. <span>רואין</span>  this note beg.) c) A partition formed by a door or window that cannot stand without the support of metal hinges is not considered valid (although the hinges are considered as attached to the ground and do not contract uncleanness.  Kel. XI, 2 and cf. Ohol. VI, 2). Hence, the same applies with respect to the curtain and the hooks. <i>ShaK</i>, however, rejects this. Cf. <i>G.Mah.</i> A closure of trellis-work in a metal door does not prevent passage of uncleanness (v. <i>ShaK</i> who modifies this ruling) — <i>Ta</i>Z. It is permissible for a <i>Kohen</i> to travel by train, although there is a possibility that a corpse is being transported. Likewise, is it permitted for a <i>Kohen</i> to travel by plane, although the plane passes over burial grounds — <i>Sh.M.B.</i> (vol IV, p. 278-9).</i>",
            "A hatchway<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ohol. X, 1ff. Quite a number of laws are enumerated <i>ibid.</i> with respect to overshadowing in connection with hatchways, yet the present law is stated because it contains a novel ruling, viz., that it is permissible to enter the ground floor where the uncleanness is found, and not the upper storey — <i>B.Yos.</i></i> that is between a house [a ground floor] and an upper storey, and there is not in it an opening of a [square] handbreadth [in size], and an olive's bulk from a corpse is in the house directly beneath the hatchway, — [the law is that] the house [ground floor] is clean and the upper storey is unclean<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For the uncleanness breaks through and rises (<span>טומאה בוקעת ועולה</span> v. Ohol. VI, 6), since it lies directly under the hatchway, despite the fact that the hatchway is less than a square handbreadth in size. The uncleanness does not spread to the sides of the ground floor, for it has an opening above in order to rise — <i>ShaK.</i> The uncleanness does not cleave downwards, back into the lower floor, since the opening is less than a square handbreadth (<i>Asheri</i>). And again, since there is only an olive’s bulk from a corpse in the ground floor, the law is that although the uncleanness will eventually be removed through the door opening, the ground floor does not become unclean now, because the uncleanness which rose to the upper storey, is already regarded as present in the public domain, for the opening is less than a square handbreadth. Hence, we may infer that if a room in a ground floor has no roof space over it (but there is a roof over the upper storey. Thus <i>Ḥid. ha-Gershuni</i> on <i>Ta</i>Z), it is forbidden for a <i>Kohen</i> to be present in any part of the ground floor, for since the uncleanness will ultimately be removed through the door opening of this uncovered ground-room, the uncleanness cleaves back into it and thence through the door opening, for it must be borne in mind that the entire ground-room is uncovered unlike above where the hatchway is less than a square handbreadth in size (v. <i>Ḥid. ha-Gershuni</i>) — <i>Ta</i>Z.</i>.",

But if the corpse is in the inner room, the <i>Kohen</i> is forbidden to be present in the outer one, even if he locked up the doors of the inner room. However, if each room has a separate door leading to the outside, and it is intended to remove the corpse through the door of the inner room the <i>Kohen</i> is permitted to remain in the outer room. Likewise is it permissible to keep the corpse in a cellar which has a separate door leading to the outside. But if the cellar has no door leading to the outside, and the corpse will ultimately be removed through the house, two conditions must be fulfilled in order to permit the <i>Kohen</i> to remain in the house above the cellar, viz., a) that there should be an opening in the cellar at least four handbreadths square, and b) that there should be no overshadowing space a handbreadth in width over the cellar opening.

If, however, the family chief accompanies the corpse, then even those who remain at home count from the time that the corpse is interred. b) <i>Tosaf.</i> adopts a stringent view, viz., that if the family chief accompanies the corpse, everyone counts from the time of burial (similar to <i>Asheri</i>), but if he remains here, then those who remain with him commence the observance of mourning forthwith, and those who accompany the corpse are required to begin the observance of formal mourning from the time of burial. However, those who accompany the corpse should observe some mourning rites forthwith out of respect to the family chief, although the seven day period of formal mourning begins for them after burial. c) <i>Caro:</i> If the chief of the family accompanies the corpse, then even those who remain here count from the time of burial, from which it follows that if the family chief remains here, we revert to the first ruling recorded at the outset of this par. viz., that those who remain here begin to count the seven days of mourning forthwith, and those who accompany the corpse from the time of burial. Hence, <i>Caro</i>’s interpretation is in accord neither with a) nor b). For according to b) even if the family chief remains here, those who accompany the corpse, it is true, commence the observance of formal mourning from burial, but they are also required to observe some mourning rites forthwith out of respect to the family chief, and according to a) if the family chief remains here, then all, — even those who accompany the corpse, begin the counting of the seven days of mourning from the time the corpse leaves. <i>Caro</i>’s interpretation may be the result of a) a different reading in Y. <i>ibid.</i>, or b) he follows <i>Maim</i>. in Yad <i>ibid</i>. and makes no distinction regarding the family chief and consequently does not take into consideration the stringency of <i>Tosaf.</i> — <i>ShaK. A.H. Caro</i>’s ruling, viz., that when the family chief accompanied the corpse, even those who remain here count from the time of burial, applies only if the family chief will reach the burial place within three days, otherwise they begin counting forthwith and the family chief from burial (v. M.K. 22a) — <i>ShaK.</i>  <i>infra</i> § 399, 14 where <i>Caro</i> rules that ‘one who suffered a bereavement on the eve of a Festival day and he was afraid lest he have not sufficient time to bury the corpse prior to the advent of the Festival whilst it is still day and gave the corpse over to Gentiles to attend to the burial, the law is that as soon as they carry the corpse out of the city and he can no longer be seen by the near-of-kin, mourning takes effect upon him, and if it is one hour prior to the Festival and he observed mourning rites therein, the restrictions of the seven days become annulled although he was buried on the Festival proper.’ This means that even if the corpse was buried on the Festival, in which case mourning is usually postponed until after the Holiday period is over, yet, since the corpse was transferred to the Gentiles prior to the advent of the Festival, it is considered as if the burial had taken place before the Festival and the seven days of mourning become annulled. This presents a difficulty. For in the present ruling it is implied (v. <i>supra</i> n. 7) that if the burial takes place on the outskirts of the city, the mourning period begins from the time of burial. How is it possible for <i>Caro</i> (<i>infra</i> § 399) to rule that the entire period of mourning becomes annulled even if the burial attended to by the Gentiles took place after the advent of the Festival? This apparent contradiction is removed only if we assume that <i>Caro</i> holds that in the case of a Festival the law is different, since from the moment the Jew transfers the corpse to the Gentiles for burial we regard the corpse as having been already interred which is similar to the case of one who is taken out for burial to another city where mourning rites begin from the moment they turn away their faces — <i>D.Merb.</i></i> The chief of the family<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">M.K. 22a.</i> means the one upon whom [the people of] the household depend and who are guided by him, irrespective whether he is a brother or a young son.<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus <i>Asheri, Tur</i> a.o.

As to the observance of mourning rites, the above principle applies (v. <i>infra</i> § 395) ; e) One who is within his thirty days of mourning and one observing <i>Yahrzeit</i> each have a right to recite one <i>Kaddish;</i> f) One who is within his thirty days of mourning takes precedence over one observing <i>Yahrzeit</i>, although the latter has a right to recite one <i>Kaddish</i> (v. however, <i>supra</i> n. 45) ; g) If there are many observing <i>Yahrzeit</i>, the one who is within his thirty days is overridden; h) If there are many observing <i>Yahrzeit</i> and one who is within his seven days of mourning, the latter has a right to one <i>Kaddish</i> and the others cast lots; i) If there are many who are within their thirty days of mourning, one observing <i>Yahrzeit</i> and one within his twelve month period of mourning, the latter is overridden entirely, and all the <i>Kaddishim</i> of that day belong to the one observing <i>Yahrzeit;</i> j) The <i>Kaddish</i> recited after the daily Psalm (<span>שיר של יום</span>) and after the Sabbath Psalm (<span>מזמור שיר ליום השבת</span>) belong to the mourners.

Hence, it is most important for one to lead the services and be afforded the opportunity to recite the <i>Kaddishim</i> during the service. Many people err in this and are under the impression that the <i>Kaddish</i> recited at the conclusion of the services is fundamental — <i>A.H.</i></i> <i>And one who knows not how to lead the entire Service, should lead the Service</i> [<i>at least</i>] <i>from</i> [<i>the section beginning with</i>] <i>'For the chief musician etc.,'</i><sup>57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ps. </i> <i>'And a redeemer shall come to</i> Z<i>ion etc.'</i><sup>58</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span>ובא לציון</span>.

            "A mourner is forbidden to eat of his own at the first meal [after burial],<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">M.K. 27b in accord with R. Judah on the authority of Rab. Derived from the words of God to Ezekiel, <i>‘And eat thou not the bread of men’</i> (Ezek. XXIV, 17) whence it follows that for others it is done. Should others, however, not provide him with the first meal, or in the case where he is the only Jewish resident in town, he may eat of his own — <i>Ta</i>Z. Some explain that the reason the first meal is provided by others is that usually the mourner immediately after burial refuses to eat and in some cases prefers death — <i>Perisha.</i> The main part of the mourner’s meal is the bread as may be seen from the verse in Ezek. <i>ibid.</i>, but he may eat other dishes of his own even at the first meal — <i>A.H.</i> It is customary to bring him bread with eggs or lentils. Cf. B.B. 16b where it is stated that on the day that Abraham our father died, Jacob made a broth of lentils to comfort his father Isaac (v. Gen. XXV, 29-30 and <i>Rashi</i> a.l.), and the reason it was of lentils is that ‘just as the lentil has no mouth (i.e., no cleft), so too, the mourner has no mouth (i.e., for speech)’. Others say, ‘Just as the lentil is round, so too, mourning rolls and goes around to all the denizens of this world.’ The practical difference between these two explanations is whether we should comfort with eggs, which have no cleft, but are not perfectly round. Hence, according to the first reason offered in the Talmud (B.B. <i>ibid.</i>) one may provide the mourner’s meal with eggs. Some of the <i>Later Authorities</i> hold that also beverages should be provided by others at the first mourner’s meal — <i>Leḥem ha-Panim</i>.</i> but at the second [meal] he is permitted [to eat of his own] even on the first day [of mourning].<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus also <i>Tur</i> and <i>Asheri</i> who explain that the words, ‘on the first day’ mentioned in M.K. <i>ibid.</i> apply only to the first meal. Cf. Pes. 36a where the expression ‘first day’ (<span>יומא קמא</span>) refers to one meal. So also <i>Hag. Maim. Ebel</i> IV, 9 citing <i>SeMaG</i>, for the underlying principle is that we follow the lenient authority in laws of mourning (M.K. 18a; ‘Er. 46a a.e.). <i>Tosaf.</i> (M.K. 20b s.v. <span>שכבר</span> and 27b s.v. <span>יום</span>) maintain that the mourner must be provided with all the meals he requires on the first day, for they take ‘first day’ to mean the meals of the entire day.</i> A religious duty rests upon his neighbours to provide food for him of their own in order that he should not eat of his own.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Y.M.K III, 5(82b).

When she provides other women with the mourner’s meal, she does not have to obtain her husband’s consent, for this is considered a small matter for which the husband’s approval is unnecessary.  Ḥ.M. § 358 and <i>supra</i> § 248. However, if the husband refuses, she may not bring the mourner’s meal to other women. If both the husband and the wife are mourners, men are permitted to provide the mourner’s meal for both, since the meal in this case is provided mainly for the husband, and indirectly she eats too — <i>A.H.</i> For the same reason, one who obligated himself to feed his son and daughter-in-law or his daughter and son-in-law, and mourning befell them, the latter may not eat of his food — <i>A.H.</i></i> So too, one who has [in his employment] a scribe or a hired man, if [each of them] receives meals as his payment, and mourning befell him, he should not eat the first meal of his employer.

III, 5(82) bot. where the ruling is mentioned that ‘two partners … must close their shop.’ However, from M.K. 11b in the case of Marion, the son of Rabin and Mar, the son of R. Aḥa, it appears that only in the case of a distinguished person we would rule thus, but not in other cases. This apparent contradiction is removed by <i>RaBaD</i> as follows: In Y. we deal with work done publicly (cf. the term <span>חנות</span> -shop used <i>ibid.</i>), whereas in B. it refers to work carried on privately. Hence, Caro’s ruling here. There are many authorities who adopt a lenient view with respect to partnership. Moreover, the leniency is extended even to cases where the shop belongs to the mourner alone, on the principle that it is impossible to keep one’s shop closed for the entire week which would entail great losses. The question, however, may be raised, — on what basis is such a leniency adopted? For even drawing up a bill of sale between the mourner and his partner or any other person, would not be helpful since the reason for the prohibition is on account of ‘appearance sake’ (<span>מראית עין</span>) and consequently, people will still know that the shop belongs to the mourner. <i>RaShaL</i> (<i>Resp.</i> 66) is lenient in this matter after three days (and part of the third day is considered a full day). Yet <i>Maim.</i> in Yad, <i>Ebel</i> V, 9 states that the prohibition remains in force for seven days. <i>A.H.</i> advances the following argument in favour of the lenient practice: With respect to a matter which entails an irretrievable loss if postponed, we find that mourning and <i>Ḥol ha-Moed</i> are on an equal footing (v. O.Ḥ. § 539 where it is stated that if the market day falls on <i>Ḥol ha-Moed</i> the individual may sit in his shop). Hence, we see that if a loss is involved, the question of conducting business publicly does not enter. Similarly, in the case of mourning. In Prague it was customary to dissolve the partnership or to transfer one’s business by means of <span>קנין סודר</span>, i.e., a legal form of acquisition by handing over an article (e.g., a scarf) from one party to the other as a symbol that the object itself has been transferred.

The undefined term <span>רחיצה</span> (bathing) refers to warm water (v. Y.M.K. III, 5(82d) ; cf. <i>infra</i> § 399 and O.H. § 549).

Or Zaru‘a</i> explains that this prohibition regarding bathing within the thirty days is on account of combing the hair, which is forbidden within the thirty days. But since we permit combing of the hair today (v. <i>infra</i> § 390), it would be permissible to bathe after seven days. <i>RaShaL’s</i> reason for the prohibition of bathing is on account of hair-cutting. Hence, bathing should be forbidden just as hair-cutting is. On <i>Ḥol ha-Moed</i>, however, we find that hair-cutting is forbidden and bathing is permitted. This difficulty may be removed on the grounds that on <i>Ḥol ha-Moed</i> the prohibition of hair-cutting applies to everyone as a result of which people will remember and be careful. Consequently, bathing is permitted. But in the case of mourning, it applies only to the individual mourner. Hence, there is fear lest he forget (cf.

            "A mourner is required to overturn the couch.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">M.K. 15a-b, 27a: ‘A mourner is required to overturn his couch (bed), for Bar Kappara taught. “I (the Lord) had placed my image among you, and for your sins I upset it; upset now your beds”’ (cf. Ez. XXIV, 23). In Y.Ber. III, 1(6a); Y.M.K. III, 5(83a) this is derived from Job. II, 13, <i>‘So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days.’</i> It was customary in those days for people to sit on couches or beds throughout the year. Hence, the mourner is required to overturn his couch and sit on the ground. Cf. however, M.K. 27a where it is stated that in a case of mourning, on the eve of the Sabbath, from the time of the <i>Minḥa</i> (afternoon) service and onwards, the couches were placed in erect position, but the mourner did not sit down on them until it was dark. This shows that the overturning of the couches or beds was on account of the prohibition against sitting on them (v. ibid., Tosaf. s.v. <span>מן המנחה ולמעלה</span>). According to the opinion of Bar Kappara, even if the mourner sat or slept on the ground, he had to overturn all the beds or couches in his home save a couch used specifically for vestments (<i>ibid.</i> 27a).</i> When the time for sleeping or eating [arrives], he may sit [or sleep] on an overturned couch, but during the entire day he may not sit even on an overturned couch save on the ground. So too, the comforters are not permitted to sit save on the ground.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On overturning the couch, consult the following sources: Sem(H). XI, 10-19; Tosef. M.K.

            "A mourner is forbidden to wash his garment during the entire seven days [of mourning],<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Talmudic days there were two kinds of washing: a) <span>כיבוס</span> i.e., plain washing, and b) <span>גיהוץ</span> i.e., laundry work. In Ket. 10b it is stated that ‘our (i.e., Babylonian) laundry work is like their (i.e., Ereẓ Israel) washing.’ In the Land of Israel the plain washing was superior to the Babylonian, because they had either better water or better ingredients for washing. In order to procure satisfactory results, they would have to do fine laundry work in Babylonia, and that would include smoothing the cloth or garment with a stone, or according to <i>Rashi</i> (<i>ibid</i>.) with a gloss-stone.  S. <i>Krauss T.A.</i> I, 156, 581 and cf. Ta‘an. 29b. There are two main views held among the authorities regarding these terms. 1) During the seven days of mourning every type of washing is forbidden for two reasons — a) It entails work. Hence, not only the mourner is forbidden to wash his clothes, but others are also forbidden to do this for him (v. <i>supra</i> § 380); b) There is a prohibition against wearing even garments that were washed prior to the time that mourning sets in. <i>This is derived from, ‘And Joab sent to Tekoa and fetched thence a wise woman and said unto her: I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner and put on mourning apparel, I pray thee, and annoint not thyself with oil but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead’</i> (II Sam. XIV, 2) — M.K. 15a. With respect to the thirty days of mourning, no prohibition against washing (<span>כיבוס</span>) is found in the Talmud; only the prohibition against laundry work (<span>גיהוץ</span>) applies then. During the entire thirty days the mourner is forbidden to wear laundried garments (M.K. 23a), and R. Eleazar b. R. Simeon forbade only new white linen clothes, and Raba (<i>ibid.</i>) rules in accord with the latter.  also <i>ibid.</i> 27b; Yeb. 43a and <i>Rashi</i> a.l.; Yad, <i>Ebel</i> V, 1, 3; VI, 4. This represents the view of <i>Rashi, Maim.</i> and <i>Alfasi.</i> 2) Even washing (<span>כיבוס</span>) is forbidden for thirty days. This is derived from Sem(H). VII, 4, where it is stated, ‘One who did not wash garments on the eve of a Festival should not wash for thirty days.’ The Talmudic texts (cited <i>supra</i> 1) are explained as follows: Yeb. <i>ibid.</i> is interpreted according to this viewpoint as referring only to those persons enumerated in Mishna, M.K. III, 2. Regarding M.K. 27b, the text should be emended to read, ‘thirty days for washing (<span>כיבוס</span>), and as to M.K. 15a, it should be understood as referring to washing in water only, which is permitted during the thirty days save the seven days of mourning. However, washing with natron and lye is forbidden (M.K. 23a, Tosaf. s.v. <span>כל</span>). — This is the viewpoint held by <i>RIBA.

Consequently, he may even prepare a feast, despite the fact that he is in mourning for a parent.

Maimonides’ reason is that M.K. <i>ibid.</i> mentions only marriage, but not betrothal. Therefore, since in Yeb. <i>ibid.</i> there is a difference of opinion between R. Judah and R. Jose, the latter maintaining that it is forbidden to betroth, — yet, since M.K. would harmonize with R. Judah’s view, who permits betrothal, this is the law — <i>Leḥ. Mish.</i> Furthermore, just as we find that on the fast day of the ninth of Ab, one may betroth lest another man get ahead of him in proposing to the woman he desires to marry (<span>שמא יקדמנו אחר</span>), the same applies according to Maim. to mourning rites. However, most of the authorities dispute this ruling of <i>Maim</i>., for they hold that the law is in accord with R. Jose (Yeb. <i>ibid</i>.), and this law cannot be derived from the ninth of Ab, since in the latter case it is considered ‘an ancient mourning’ (<span>אבילות ישנה</span>). Accordingly, the reason M.K. <i>ibid.</i> mentions only marriage, is primarily for the sake of introducing a remarkable feature, viz., marriage during mourning, but this does not exclude betrothal from the same ruling. <i>Isserles</i>, therefore, rules (v. anon) that even betrothal is forbidden for the entire thirty days.</i> provided he does not make a feast [of betrothal], unless thirty days have gone by [at which time a feast is permissible].<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> <i>Kes.

            "If his wife died, he is forbidden to take another [wife] until three Festivals have gone by her [death].<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">M.K. 23a in accord with the First Tanna; Sem(H). VII, 15. Thus also Yad, <i>Ebel</i> VI, 5 cited by <i>Tur, contra</i> second opinion stated by R. Judah (M.K. <i>ibid.</i>) that the prohibition extends only until the second Festival, but before the third he is permitted. <i>Tosaf. ibid.</i> s.v. <span>ער</span> state on the authority of <i>R. Jonah</i> that R. Judah’s opinion cannot be accepted on the principle that in all matters pertaining to mourning the law is in accord with the lenient authority (this is in fact the ruling of <i>Ghayyat, N</i> and <i>Asheri</i> that we we must accept R. Judah’s view since he represents the lenient opinion), for in the case of remarriage after his former wife’s death, the days of mourning (i.e., the thirty days) have already gone by and the reason for the requirement of three Festivals has no bearing upon mourning rites. <i>Tosaf. ibid.</i> advances various reasons why the husband must wait until three Festivals have passed prior to remarriage, — a) that by waiting for three Festivals to pass without the joy of marital life, he will not forget his former wife’s love and consequently, he will be inspired to remarry; b) to give the husband a chance to forget his former wife’s love, so that when he remarries, he will not mention his former wife’s love and devotion to his second wife, and thereby will avoid domestic friction. The law of three Festivals applies whether his former wife was at the time of marriage a spinster or a widow, or whether it was his first or second marriage. Likewise, whether his former wife was healthy or sick, or whether he lived peacefully or had disputes with her — <i>A.H.</i> The lenient view of R. Judah that two Festivals suffice, may be relied upon in a case of emergency — <i>A.H.</i> In the case where her husband died, she mourns only for thirty days, but she is forbidden to become engaged or to remarry before three months go by, in order to determine whether she is with child by her former husband or not (v. E.H. § 13). <i>Mord.</i> states that the reason why a woman does not have to wait until three Festivals have gone by before remarriage, is that she is satisfied to lead a married life than to remain single (v. Kid. 7a), and consequently, she is more apt to forget her former husband after thirty days of mourning and to devote herself to her new partner. If it happened that he married her within her thirty days of mourning for other near-of-kin, she should not cohabit with him before the thirty days of mourning are over. Thus opinion of <i>Maim.</i> (Yad, <i>ibid</i>), in accord with <i>BaḤ’s</i> interpretation — <i>Ta</i>Z, <i>ShaK</i>. <i>Shemini Aẓereth</i> is considered an independent Festival with respect to the waiting period of three Festivals — <i>D.Merb. R.A.Eger</i>, however, disagrees with the latter. One whose wife died on <i>Ḥol ha-Moed</i> of the Passover Festival, and he wishes to remarry on the twentieth of Adar II, i.e., after twelve months will have gone by, the law is that although three Festivals will not have elapsed, he is nevertheless, permitted — <i>P.Tesh.</i></i> <i>However, as to entering a house of feasting, the law regarding him is as</i> [<i>in the case of</i>] <i>other near-of-kin</i>.<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tur</i> — <i>G.</i>  Yeb. 43b, <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>שאני</span>.

This is not to be compared to a Festival, in which case mourning is postponed until after the Festival (v. <i>infra</i> § 399), for in the latter case the individual proper was obligated to observe mourning rites, only that the Festival interrupts this. Moreover, on a Festival private mourning is still observed.

Furthermore, the principle is that in ‘any matter which eventually will be exposed people do not lie’ (v. R.H. 22b; Yeb. 93b). Although we compare mourning to the laws of evidence on which a woman is permitted to remarry, we may ask the following: In the case of a woman there is an additional reason (excluding the reason of evidence) for granting her permission to remarry, viz., ‘A woman is careful to make inquiries prior to remarriage’ (<span>דיקא ומנסבא</span>) (Yeb. 116b), which is not so in the case of mourning. How can we therefore, compare the two cases? There are, therefore, some authorities who hold that the permission granted the woman is based mainly on the evidence of the single witness. It may, however, be possible that in the case of the woman we adopt a stringent view and require both the principle of evidence plus the fact that she also makes her own inquiries, whereas in the case of mourning a lenient view is adopted and the principle of evidence alone suffices — <i>A.H.</i> (Evidence offered in writing is also accepted in the case of permitting a woman to remarry.

From this we conclude that the Sabbath must have been the thirtieth day, and since one observes on the Sabbath only mourning pertaining to private matters, formal mourning cannot continue after the Sabbath. Hence, with the termination of the Sabbath the death report is regarded as distant tidings. Were the Sabbath the twenty-ninth day, the entire seven days of formal mourning would have to be observed. Consequently, we may conclude that a death report received on the thirtieth day (excluding the Sabbath) is regarded as near tidings. The thirtieth day is calculated according to the locality of the mourner and not the place of death, e.g., if one who lives in United States or Canada receives a death report from Europe on the thirtieth day, although in Europe at that time it was already the thirty-first day, we follow the locality of the mourner with respect to determining whether it is near or distant tidings — <i>Resp.

The same ruling is derived from the case of R. Ḥinena (<i>ibid.</i> 20a) who received tidings from Be Ḥozai about the death of his father, and after consulting R. Ḥisda, the latter told him, ‘On (receiving) distant tidings, mourning is observed for one day only.’</i> And this, — [viz., that even in the case of receiving distant tidings about the death of one's parents, one hour of mourning suffices], applies only with respect to the restrictions of the seven [days of mourning which fall away in the case of distant tidings],<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tur</i> on the authority of <i>N</i> in <i>T.H.</i> on the basis of a logical deduction.</i> but as to the restrictions of the thirty [which apply in the case of other dead],<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">e., whatever restrictions obtain in the case of other near-of-kin with respect to the thirty days, e.g., laundry-work, hair-cutting, obtain in the case of one’s parents until he is rebuked etc. — <i>Ta</i>Z.</i> — he observes [in the case of receiving distant tidings] about [the death of] his father and/or mother the [prohibition against] hair-cutting until his friends rebuke him, and with respect to laundry work, — until the Festival arrives and they rebuke him, and likewise, with respect to extending a greeting of peace or entering a house of feasting.

If at the place of death it was already night when the person died and at the place of the near-of-kin it was still day, the <i>Yahrzeit</i> day is fixed according to the place of death — <i>Sh.M.B. contra Kol Bo</i>(<i>G</i>).

Consequently, if one dies on <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Kislev</i> when <i>Rosh Ḥodesh</i> is observed only one day, — the law is that in a subsequent year when <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Kislev</i> consists of two days, the <i>Yahrzeit</i> should be observed on the second day of <i>Rosh Ḥodesh</i>, which is the first day of the month of <i>Kislev.</i> However, if one died on the first day of <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Kislev</i> when <i>Rosh Ḥodesh</i> consisted of two days, the question is — when should one observe <i>Yahrzeit</i> in a subsequent year when <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Kislev</i> consists of one day only? Should one observe the <i>Yahrzeit</i> on the twenty-ninth day of <i>Ḥeshvan</i>, since the death took place on the last day of <i>Ḥeshvan</i>, or do we say that since in matters pertaining to vows (v. end of <i>Gloss anon</i>) we follow the language of the people, he should observe <i>Yahrzeit</i> on <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Kislev?</i> — The following procedure should be adopted: If during the first year following the death, <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Kislev</i> is observed for one day only, the <i>Yahrzeit</i> should be observed on the twenty-ninth day of <i>Ḥeshvan.</i> Thus also whenever the month of <i>Ḥeshvan</i> is defective, then on the following day (i.e., <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Kislev</i>), if there are no mourners in the Synagogue, he should also recite the <i>Kaddish</i> and lead the services. But if during the year following the death, <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Kislev</i> consists of two days, consequently, the <i>Yahrzeit</i> becomes fixed for <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Kislev</i> and he should observe it thus every subsequent year, even when <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Kislev</i> consists of one day. The same principle applies to other months which are sometimes full and sometimes defective — <i>M.Abr.</i> Since <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Tebeth</i> is sometimes observed one day, in which case the sixth day of <i>Ḥanukkah</i> is the first of <i>Tebeth</i>, the seventh day, — the second of <i>Tebeth</i> and the eighth day, — the third of <i>Tebeth;</i> and sometimes <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Tebeth</i> consists of two days, i.e., the sixth and seventh day of <i>Ḥanukkah</i>, in which case the seventh day of <i>Ḥanukkah</i> is the first day of <i>Tebeth</i> and the eighth day, — the second day of <i>Tebeth</i>, — consequently, one who observes <i>Yahrzeit</i> during these days should not err by counting the days of <i>Ḥanukkah</i>, but one must always count the days of the month — <i>M.Abr.</i></i> <i>and  O.H.</i> § 568, 8. <i> supra</i> § 391 <i>that one should not eat at a feast on the night of</i> [<i>which the following</i>] <i>day is the death anniversary of one's father or/and mother</i>.<sup>53</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> <i>supra</i> § 391, 3, <i>Gloss</i> n. 38.</i> [<i>If</i>] <i>this fast falls on the eve of the Sabbath, the law is as</i> [<i>on</i>] <i>other fastday</i>[<i>s</i>]. <i> O.H. § 249</i>. <i>In any case</i>, — [<i>the law is that</i>] <i>if the first time one fasted the whole day, one should adopt this practice all the days of his life</i>.<sup>54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For it is then regarded as a vow. Hence, he must always fast on that day. Should one, however, be ill or should there be any other reason which prevents him from observing the fast-day, he must first be released from his vow. But if, prior to observing the first fast-day, one explicitly stated that he fasts on the condition that this should not be regarded as a vow for the following year, he does not require any release (v. O.Ḥ. § 568 and <i>Ḥ. Adam</i>).</i>"
