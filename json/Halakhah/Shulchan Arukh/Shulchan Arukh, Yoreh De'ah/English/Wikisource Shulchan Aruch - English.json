            "The sages forbade eating the bread of idol worshippers because of the concern of intermarriage. Rema: and even in a situation where there is no concern of intermarriage, it is [nonetheless] forbidden. (Rashb\"a §248) However, they only forbade bread made from the Five Grains (wheat, barley, oats, rye, spelt), but bread made from legumes or from rice or millet is not in the category of \"regular bread\" which they forbade. Rema: It is also not forbidden on account of [being] \"Idolaters' Cooking,\" if it would not be served at kings' tables (Tur and Beit Yosef in the name of the Rosh's responsa).",
            "There are places that are lenient about this, [where] they buy bread from an idolater's bakery in a situation where there is no Jewish bakery, since this is considered a \"time of pressing need.\" Rem\"a: And some say that even in a place where \"Jews' bread\" can be found, it is permitted (Beit Yosef following the Mordechai; Sefer Mitzvot Hakatan; Hagaot Ashri; Mahar\"i; Issur VeHeter §44). But regarding personal bread, no-one rules leniently, since the essence of the decree is because of the concern of intermarriage, and if one eats the bread of [idolatrous] home-owners, he will come to dine by them. Rem\"a: However, it is not called \"personal bread\" unless he made it for the people of his own household, but if he made it to sell, it is called commercial bread, even if he doesn't normally [sell bread]; conversely, a baker who made [bread] for himself, it is considered \"personal [bread].\""

            "If one mixed a food that is eaten even raw with a thing that is not eaten when raw and a non-Jew cooked them – if the essence is of the food is subject to the prohibition of non-Jewish cooking, it is forbidden. If not, it is permitted. Rema: And it is permitted to eat roasted peas of a non-Jew, and also the roasted legumes (which are called “arbiss”), for they are not served at the kings table And thus they treat them leniently if it is not in a place where they grease the metal frying pan with forbidden fats, then the custom is that they are prohibited. But otherwise it is permitted, and one need not worry about the vessels of non-Jews because most vessels have not been used in the last 24 hours. And any fruit that is eaten raw, even if a non-Jew cooked it, and it was mashed up and made into a cooked dish in their hands, it is permitted. Therefore, we eat the fruit mash made by non-Jews.",

And even initially, we are accustomed to be lenient with a Jewish house that has non-Jewish maidservants and menservants that cook in the Jewish house because, inevitably, one of the household members will be doing some stirring.",

A non-Jew that lights a fire in a swamp in order to chase away the locusts, and some of those locusts become cooked, these are permitted, even in a place where they are served on a kings table. And thus if he singed the head of an animal, it is permitted to eat the tips of the ears that became roasted at the time of the singeing. But if the non-Jew intended to cook, for example that he lit the oven to cook in it, and there was some meat in there already which became roasted, even though he did not intend to cook the meat, as he did not know it was there, it is forbidden.",

However, in other types of cooking, the lighting of the fire nor the lit of the oven hold any significance. It is only the actual act of placing the food in the oven that qualifies it as \"bishul Israel\". Therefore, if one wants to cook in a pan in an oven of non-Jews, it is necessary that the Jew puts the pan in himself, to a place in the oven that is appropriate to cook in. Rema: And there are those that disagree and believe that lighting a fire or stoking the coals in any way with regards to cooking, as with bread, is sufficient, and that is our custom. And even stoking the fire without any particular intentions works. And there are those that say that even if the Jew did not stoke the fire, and did not throw in any wood chips, only that the non-Jew lit the oven from a fire that was lit by a Jew, that is permitted.",

What are we talking about? When one buys in a shop; but if he sees the shopkeeper bring it from the barrel, it is permitted, and we are not concerned that perhaps wine was mixed in, because if wine would be mixed inside the barrel, it would ruin the product.

Rema: Because after they have been soaked they are spicy and shall absorb flavors from the knife. But if they are soaked in non-Jewish containers, they are permitted because after they put water in them to nullify the spice. And so too with anything similar, and see above in chapter 96.",

            "It is forbidden to buy asafoetida from non-Jews if it is cut with their knives which have come into contact with non-kosher food, and so too with mixtures of fish, because small unkosher fish gets into the mixers and it is impossible to separate them, and they sometimes place wine to soak in the mixture.

And so too for anything like this that is forbidden rabbinically. And if it is known with certainty that some non Jews mix wine in, and some do not mix wine in, then we go according to the majority, as it is unusually for a person to deviate from the norm.

If it was milked in his house and a Jew was sitting outside, if it is known that there is no non-kosher animal in his herd, it is permitted, even if no Jew is able to see him at the time that he milks the animal. If he has a non-kosher animal in his heard, and the Jew sits outside, and the non-Jew is milking only for the sake of the Jew, even if the Jew is unable to see him when he is sitting, if he is able to see him when he stands, this is permitted, because the non-Jew fears that perhaps he will stand and be seen, and he knows that non-kosher milk is forbidden to the Jew. Rema: Initially, it is necessary for the Jew to be there are the beginning of the milking and check to make sure that the bucket is empty and does not contain non-kosher milk. And it is our custom to be stringent and not milk with vessels which are usually used for milking by non-Jews, lest some of their [non-Kosher] milk remain in the vessel. In any case, after the fact there is no need to be concerned for this. And regarding maidservants that milk domestic animals in the Jew's house or in his [animal] pen, any instance in which it is not a house of a non-Jew, that is enough and there is no need to be concerned about a non-kosher matter, and it is permitted even initially to leave them to milk even there is not a Jew around, because the non-Jewish milker is in his house or neighborhood, they are not suspected of milking non-kosher animals. But if a non-Jew takes a break, the Jew needs to be there, because it is like the case of the non-Jew's house. And even a Jewish child will suffice, because the non-Jew appears before him. In any case, if a Jew is not present until after he has finished milking, this milk is considered the milk of non-Jews that is forbidden, even thought no non-kosher animal exists in his herd. Milk of a non-Jew makes vessels non-kosher when they are cooked in them, just as any prohibited food, even though this is only an uncertainty whether he has mixed in something non-kosher. And so too with non-Jewish cheese, but not non-Jewish butter, even in a place where it is considered prohibited it does not prohibit vessels when cooked, and it is not a problem if it becomes mixed; if it is mixed in that which is permitted, everything is permitted, like above regarding the bread of non-Jews. See above in chapter 112. Milk of non-Jews that is forbidden, it will not work to make it into cheese or butter afterwards, rather it remains forbidden, and everything that is made from it is forbidden.",

And if a Jew oversees the production of the cheese and the milking, it is permitted. And thus is the custom that spread in all of our countries. And if a Jew oversaw the making of the cheese, but not the milking, it is permitted after the fact, because there is no concern that perhaps something non-kosher was mixed in after the cheese was made from the milk, because non-kosher milk will not allow the cheese to form, and of course the non-Jew did not mix anything in once he knew it was for making cheese. And in any case, it is forbidden to eat such milk.",

Rema: Also it is permitted to cook it in this fashion initially in order to get the milk solids.

And one who goes from a place where this is forbidden, to a place where it is permitted, it is forbidden to eat it there.

There are those who permit him to eat at that meal of fish that is made after the wedding, for since they have already ended saying “that the joy that we have is in God’s midst,” there is a reminder that there is not festivity in that meal, so it is permitted.
