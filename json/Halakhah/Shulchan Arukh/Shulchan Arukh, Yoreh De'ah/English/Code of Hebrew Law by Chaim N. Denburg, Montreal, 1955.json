            "<b>LAWS OF VISITING THE SICK; HEALING; THE APPROACH OF DEATH AND ONE IN A DYING CONDITION.</b><br>It is a religious duty to visit the sick.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shab. 127a; B.M. 30b; B.K. 100a; Ned. 39b-40a; Sot. 14a.</i> Relatives and friends<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Who are intimate with him and are on an equal footing as relatives.</i> may enter at once and strangers after three days. If the sickness overtakes him<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lit. ‘springs upon him.’</i> both may enter forthwith.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tur</i> in abridged form from <i>T.H.</i> — <i>G.</i> Y. Peah III, 9(17d); <i>ibid.</i> Git. VI, 7 (48a-b) ; Sem. de R. Ḥiyya (H) I, 1;  also Sem. (H). Int. pp. 17-19 and cf. Ber. 55b; Yad, <i>Ebel</i> XIV, 5 and <i>Kes. Mish. ibid.</i> Strangers are not permitted to visit the sick person before three days elapse, for prior to this period their visit indicates that the patient’s luck is shaky and that he is designated a sick person. This, however, does not apply to relatives and intimate friends who are much closer to him. Hence, if the sickness overtakes him even strangers are permitted to visit him immediately — <i>BaḤ.</i> A <i>Kohen</i> is permitted to visit a sick person in a hospital, although it is quite likely that a corpse is present there. However, he should first make inquiries from the hospital authorities whether there is a corpse there or not. Where this is impossible to be determined, the <i>Kohen</i> may visit the patient in order to fulfil the religious duty of visiting the sick. The <i>Kohen</i> should not fear that there are sick people in the hospital who are in a dying condition, for we apply the principle that the majority of sick people recover — <i>Resp. Teshurath Shai.</i></i>",
            "Even a prominent person must visit a humble one;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ned. 39b.</i> even many times a day and even if the visitor is of his affinity.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Of the same age as the invalid. Thus <i>Rashi.</i> According to <i>Asheri</i>: ‘under the same planetary influence.’ ‘For a master said: ‘A man’s affinity takes away a sixtieth of his (the sick person’s) illness’ (Ned. <i>ibid</i>.; B.M. 30b).</i> One who increases [his visits] is considered praiseworthy,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In accord with Raba’s dictum (Ned. <i>ibid</i>.), ‘Even a hundred times a day.’</i> provided he does not trouble him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i> The visitor should not come empty-handed — <i>Sefer Yesh Noḥalin.</i></i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>Some say that an enemy may visit a sick person</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Maharil</i> s. 197 — <i>G.</i></i> <i>However, this does not seem plausible to me; but he should not visit a sick person nor comfort a mourner whom he hates, so that</i> [<i>the latter</i>] <i>should not think that he rejoices at his misfortune, and thereby feel depressed</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One may, however, follow the funeral procession of his enemy since this is the end of every human and ‘rejoicing at one’s misfortune’ does not apply (<i>BaḤ</i>). But as to visiting the sick or offering comfort to a mourner, it depends upon the degree of enmity. — <i>ShaK</i>. One should therefore, use his judgment, especially if the sick person gives him permission to visit him — <i>Sefer ha-Ḥayyim.</i></i> <i>Thus seems to me</i> [<i>to be the correct view</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">San. 19a — <i>G.</i>  also <i>Me’iri ibid.</i></i>",
            "One who visits the sick may neither sit upon a bed, nor upon a chair, nor upon a stool, but must [reverently] wrap himself and sit in front of him [the invalid], for the Divine Presence is above the top-side of his bed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For it is written, <i>‘The Lord supports him upon the bed of illness’</i> (PS. XLI, 4).  Shab. 12b, and <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>לא</span>; Ned. 40a and <i>RaN</i> s.v. <span>לא</span>.</i> <i>Gloss</i>: [<i>This applies</i>] <i>only if the sick person lies on the ground so that he who sits</i> [<i>near him</i>] <i>will be on a higher level; but when he lies upon the bed, it is permissible</i> [<i>for the visitor</i>] <i>to sit on a chair or a stool</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>B.Yos</i>. citing <i>RaN; Hag.

            "One must not visit the sick during the first three hours of the day, — for every invalid's illness is alleviated in the morning and [consequently] one will not trouble himself to pray<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lit. ‘to ask for mercy.’</i> for him; and not during the last three hours of the day, — for then his illness grows worse and one will give up hope to pray for him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ned. <i>ibid.</i> This is not a prohibition but only general advice. Hence, people are not particular with respect to this requirement — <i>A.H.</i></i> <i>Gloss</i>: <i>One who visited</i> [<i>a sick person</i>] <i>and did not pray for him has not fulfilled the religious duty</i> [<i>of visiting the sick</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>B.Yos.</i> citing <i>N</i> (in <i>T.H.</i>) — <i>G.</i></i>",
            "When one prays for him, — if in his presence,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">e., the invalid’s.</i> one may pray in any language one desires; if one prays, not in his presence,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">e., the invalid’s.</i> one should pray only in Hebrew.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shab. <i>ibid.</i> according to which the Divine Presence is with the invalid and supports him (v. <i>supra</i> n. 12). Hence, the visitor may pray in any language since he is in the presence of God. But when he is not in the presence of the invalid he requires the angel’s intercession who according to tradition understands only Hebrew (v. Sot. 33a). This should not be confused with the notion that Judaism advocates praying to angels to intercede on our behalf. The angel merely acts as a carrier of prayers to God.  Y.Ber. IX, 1(13a), “If a misfortune befalls a person, he should not cry to Michael or Gabriel, but let him cry to me and I will answer him forthwith, as it is written, <i>‘whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered</i>’” (Joel III, 5).</i>",

            "One must visit the sick of the Gentiles in the interests of peace.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Git. 61a. Cf. <i>W.G.</i> a.l.</i>",

We are therefore, informed in this par. otherwise.

Hence, the laws of mourning do not apply to an <i>Onen.</i> b) <i>N</i> in <i>T.H.; R. Pereẓ</i> (quoted in <i>Tur</i>) hold that they are on an equal footing. Consequently, an <i>Onen</i> must observe all the laws of mourning.</i> If one must go to await nightfall at the Sabbath limit to [be ready] to attend to the preparations needed for the dead [at the exit of the Sabbath], the observance of <i>Aninuth</i> rests upon him, insofar as the prohibition extends to everything from the moment he begins to go to await nightfall at the Sabbath limit.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Y. <i>ibid.</i> in accord with <i>Asheri.</i> Cf.

This is applicable only to a case where one suffered a loss on the Sabbath before the night set in, so that the obligation of reciting the evening <i>Tefillah</i> never took effect. If, however, the loss was sustained after the night had already set in, in which case the obligation of reciting the evening <i>Tefillah</i> had already taken effect prior to the occurrence of death, one must recite the morning <i>Tefillah</i> twice — <i>D.Merb.</i>  <i>P.Tesh.</i> for further comments.</i> and this is not similar to the case of one who forgot to recite the evening <i>Tefillah</i>, who may recite the morning <i>Tefillah</i> twice,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> O.Ḥ §. 108, </i> since he was not dutibound to recite the <i>Tefillah</i> during the [previous] night.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Derisha</i> holds that similarly one who occupies himself with communal needs which interfere with the prescribed time to pray is exempt from a complementary <i>Tefillah</i> at the following service (v. previous note). For in both cases, viz., in the case of the sustained loss mentioned above, and in the case of preoccupation with communal needs, there is unavoidable interference. <i>Ta</i>Z opposes this and makes the following distinction between the two cases : In the case of a sustained loss the interference is a result, not of the individual’s incapacity to recite prayers, but rather of external circumstances, namely, the <i>Aninuth</i> which exempts him. Under such conditions one is not required to recite a complementary prayer at the following service. But in the case of preoccupation with communal needs, the individual proper is busily engaged. Hence, he is dutibound to make up the prayer when he becomes free. <i>Nek. Hak.</i> refutes <i>Ta</i>Z and agrees with <i>Derisha</i>, by showing that both cases are on an equal footing insofar as in both instances the individual is legally exempt on the principle that, ‘One who is engaged in a religious act is exempt from other religious duties’ (Suk. 25a). When, however, the person is legally not exempt, but there it an unavoidable interference, the <i>Tefillah</i> is temporarily suspended until the following service at which time a complementary prayer is said.</i> With respect to the <i>Habdalah</i>, one should recite [it] after the corpse is buried.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>R. Meir of Rothenberg; Mord</i>. and <i>Hag. Maim.</i> — <i>G.</i>  Pes. 107a: ‘Raba said, the law is that he who has tasted food recites the <i>Habdalah.’</i> ‘He who did not recite the <i>Habdalah</i> at the termination of the Sabbath proceeds to recite it anytime during the week.’ (<i>ibid</i>.). The words, ‘anytime during the week,’ are explained to mean until after the third day is ended. Cf. <i>ibid., Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>אמימר</span> and O.Ḥ. § 299, 6. <i>Asheri</i> in his <i>Resp.</i> accepted the ruling which he followed in a similar case (v. <i>supra</i> n. 26). Later in his <i>Decisions</i>, he abandoned this view and accepted the view of R. Judah (<i>ibid.</i> Cf. <i>Tur</i> a.l.) who held that one should not recite the <i>Habdalah</i> after (burial.  <i>Ta</i>Z <i>infra</i> § 396 who disagrees with both views and advances another explanation. After burial when the <i>Habdalah</i> prayer is recited it is said only over a cup of wine without the fragrant spices and the candle. If the bereavement was sustained on a Festival day, the <i>Habdalah</i> prayer may be said only on the following day after burial, but not as in the case of the Sabbath where the law is that it may be said even until the third day. An <i>Onen</i> who was ignorant of this ruling and recited the <i>Habdalah</i> on the night following the Sabbath is not required to recite it again after burial — <i>P.Tesh.</i> On the question whether an <i>Onen</i> who has a child to be circumcised should perform the circumcision before or after burial, a difference of opinion exists among the <i>Codifiers. RaShaL</i> maintains that the circumcision should be performed first. <i>Isserles</i> (in <i>Resp.</i>) holds that first the burial should be held, for being an <i>Onen</i> he cannot recite the benediction, ‘Blessed art Thou … and commanded us to introduce my son into the covenant of Abraham our father.’ <i>Ta</i>Z rules that if possible, the burial should be held in the morning. However, if this is not feasible, the circumcision is performed first and the <i>Sandek</i> recites the benediction, and it matters not whether the circumcision is held during the prescribed time, i.e., on the eight day or later. <i>Ḥatam Sofer</i> accepts <i>RaShaL’s</i> ruling. <i>Bir. Yos.</i> and others agree with <i>Ta</i>Z. A <i>Kohen</i> who is an <i>Onen</i>, and there is no other <i>Kohen</i> available, may officiate at the redemption of a firstborn.

Even if the groom’s mother died or other near-of-kin, in which case there is still his father available to make all the preparations at a future date, nevertheless, since the bride has no one available to make her preparations in addition to the loss involved at present, the wedding is not postponed, and they are brought into the bridal chamber as stated anon. Nowadays if a parent dies the wedding is postponed until after the seven days of mourning — <i>Ba’er Heteb, Ḥatam Sofer.</i> On the eve of Passover after midday it is permissible for a groom or bride who are in mourning to be married, since with the advent of the Passover Festival and the period of counting the <i>Omer</i> that follows it is forbidden to hold marriages. This is in accord with <i>Isserles’</i> ruling (v. <i>infra</i> § 399) that after midday on the eve of a Festival mourning rites have no legal effect, <i>contra ShaK</i> (<i>ibid.</i>). This applies to a groom who was never married before and did not yet comply with the duty of propagation — <i>Zekor le-Abraham, Net’a Sorek.</i> If they suffered a loss after the marriage was already performed, the groom must not perform the marital act until after the seven days of mourning, after which, follow the seven days of the wedding-feast (v. <i>infra</i> § 383). One who was in a dying condition and instructed his daughter’s marriage to take place and he died after the dutiful marital act had already been performed, the law is that the daughter is not permitted to attend the funeral, since it is already regarded as a Festival period for her, and were she to attend the funeral, it would be considered tantamount to observing mourning rites publicly on a Festival which is forbidden — <i>P.Tesh.</i></i> and there are womens' perfumes and toilet [prepared] which are not durable,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>RaN ibid.</i> Cf. <i>Rashi ibid.</i> s.v. <span>ואביו של חתן</span>.</i> — [<i>the law is that</i>] <i>since there is no one</i> [<i>available</i>] <i>who will prepare for them a second time</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Derived from Gemara <i>ibid.</i> — <i>G.</i></i>, they bring the corpse into a room and the bridegroom and the bride into a bridal chamber, and he performs the dutiful marital act and [then] separates [himself from her and they bury the corpse forthwith].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gemara <i>ibid.</i> This applies even if he married a woman who was married before. If the death occurred after the bride’s head was covered, the seven days of the wedding-feast take effect. Thus <i>Derisha</i>, but is rejected by <i>Ta</i>Z.</i> However, since the marital precept rests upon him, it is regarded as a Festival day for him, and he observes [first] the seven days of the [wedding-] feast,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The law is that on the first day mourning rites are Rabbinical (v. <i>infra</i> § 399, 13). Hence, he is permitted to observe first the seven days of the wedding-feast, for were the first day of mourning Biblical, ‘matters pertaining to joy’ would be forbidden — <i>ShaK.</i> Cf. <i>G.Mah.</i> and <i>R. A. Eeger</i> a.l. It may be asked, however, how is it possible for the seven days of the wedding-feast to override a case of Biblical mourning, for the day of death and burial is considered Biblical (it is only when the burial is not held on the same day as death that the first day of mourning is Rabbinical)? This difficulty may be removed because the first day of a groom’s marriage is considered Biblical, for it is written, <i>‘In the day of his espousals and in the day of the gladness of his heart’</i> (Song of Songs III, 11) — <i>Asheri.</i> Although an <i>Onen</i> is forbidden the use of the conjugal couch (v. <i>supra</i> § 341), the Rabbis were lenient in this case and put it on an equal footing with one who had given up hope of burying his dead in which case he is permitted to eat meat and drink wine and use the conjugal couch — <i>RITBA.</i></i> and after this he observes the seven days of mourning.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As to the question of rending garments, there is a difference of opinion among the authorities. <i>MaHaRIL</i> (Laws of Mourning) states that the garments are rent after the seven days of the wedding-feast. <i>She’elath Yabeẓ</i> maintains that garments should be rent forthwith since it is not a Biblical Festival. <i>Sede Ḥemed</i> accepts <i>MaHaRIL’s</i> ruling. <i>Mishmereth Shalom</i> agrees with <i>Yabeẓ.</i></i> And the entire seven days of the [wedding-] feast he observes matters pertaining to private [mourning], and he is forbidden to use the conjugal couch.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yad, <i>Ebel</i> XI, 8. <i>Tur</i> on the authority of <i>RaBaD</i> writes that he is only forbidden to use the conjugal couch or to be alone with her, but the mixing of the cup, the making of the bed and the washing of his face, hands and feet are permitted to be done in each other’s presence. <i>ShaK</i> rejects this on the basis of numerous sources in the Talmud and Codes and extends the prohibition to embracing and kissing as well.</i> Therefore, the entire seven days of the [wedding-] feast and the seven days of mourning, he sleeps among the men and she sleeps among the women.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ket. <i>ibid.</i> According to our ruling today (v. <i>supra</i> c. 193 end) that after the dutiful marital act she is considered a <i>Niddah</i>, no guarding should be necessary.

But if there are no special groups arranged to carry the bier, only those who are in proximity of the bier are exempt, since they participate in carrying the bier, but not those who are at a distance — <i>M.Abr.</i> and Mishna Ber. <i>ibid.</i></i> and the others who follow the corpse, who are not needful for the bier, are not exempt.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> O.Ḥ. § 72 — <i>G.</i> Although escorting the dead (<span>הלוית המת</span>) is a religious duty which falls into the category of ‘deeds of love’ (<span>גמילות חסדים</span>) which is Biblical and should alone suffice to exempt one from the reading of the <i>Shema</i>, yet, since those who merely escort the dead are not regarded as being busily engaged or troubled (<span>טרודים</span>), they can manage to read the first verse of the <i>Shema</i> in a standing position with the proper intention, and the rest of the <i>Shema</i> while walking.

Hence, in the morning, since the time for reading the <i>Shema</i> in the first instance (<span>לכתחילה</span>) is ‘when one sees his friend at a distance of four cubits and recognizes him,’ until the ‘sparklings of the rising sun’ appear (Ber. 9b; O.Ḥ. § 58, 1; § 89, 1), a corpse may be taken out for burial at least half an hour before this period. Otherwise, we apprehend that there will be insufficient time to complete the burial and read the <i>Shema</i> in time — <i>Disciples of R. Jonah</i> (Ber. 19a). In Y.Ber. III, 2(6b) one hour is mentioned, which is explained (v. <i>R. Jonah ibid.</i>) to mean, as long as there is sufficient time to complete the burial before the prescribed period arrives. Hence, ‘close to’ does not refer to the half hour period. In Y. <i>ibid.</i> the following question is raised: Since we learn in the following Mishna (Ber. <i>ibid</i>.): ‘When they have buried the dead and returned, if they can begin (the <i>Shema</i>) and complete it before reaching the (mourners’) line, they begin it; but if they can not, they do not begin it,’ it follows that the <i>Shema</i> is never read during the time that the corpse is borne for the purpose of burial (for as we have seen one must take the corpse out for burial prior to the prescribed time for reading the <i>Shema</i>). Consequently, we may ask, why does the Mishnah make a distinction with respect to the <i>Shema</i> at the time the corpse is carried out for burial? In order to remove this apparent difficulty, Y. <i>ibid.</i> explains that it applies only to a case where they thought that there was ample time to complete the burial before the prescribed time for reading the <i>Shema</i> arrived, and they erred. In Ber. <i>ibid.</i> it is stated that it refers to a distinguished person who may be taken out for burial even close to the prescribed period for the reading of the <i>Shema.</i> The custom today is to take out the corpse for burial after the morning Service at the Synagogue is over, so that many people will be able to attend the burial — <i>B.Hillel.</i> Cf. <i>G.</i> anon.</i> whenever there is no time to bring him out [and] to bury him before the time for the reading of the <i>Shema</i> arrives; but if they had [already] commenced to bring him out, they do not desist<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> <i>supra</i> n. 3.</i> in order to read [the <i>Shema</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ber. 19a; Y.Ber.

This is derived (<i>ibid.</i>) from, <i>‘And he cast the dust thereof</i> (i.e., of the <i>Ashera</i>) <i>upon the graves of the common people’</i> (II Kings XXIII, 6) whence we learn that the graves of the common people are compared to idols. And just as idols are not prohibited when they are attached, as it is written, <i>‘Ye shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nations that ye are to dispossess served their gods, upon the high mountains’</i> (Deut. XII, 2), i.e., their gods which are <i>upon</i> the high mountains (are forbidden for use), but not the mountains which themselves are their gods, — so too, whatever belongs to the dead, i.e., attached, is not prohibited. However, a built grave is not considered attached to the soil, and as in the case of detached idols, is prohibited (v. <i>supra</i> § 145, 3).  Meg. 29a and <i>infra</i> § 363, 1, according to which even natural soil of burial grounds is forbidden for profitable use and consequently contradicts the present ruling. <i>B.Hillel</i> therefore, explains that in our case (Gemara San. <i>ibid.</i>) where it is reported that Samuel permitted people to take earth from Rab’s grave and apply it as a remedy on the first day of an attack of fever, we deal with natural soil taken from a grave and applied as a remedy only, which is permissible; whereas in the other passage (Gemara Meg. <i>ibid.</i>) the natural soil was not used for a remedial purpose, and consequently, is forbidden for profitable use, not because legally this is so, but rather because this is considered disrespectful treatment of the dead.

A.H.</i> elucidates the ruling here as follows: An object originally loose and subsequently attached (<span>תלוש ולבסוף חברו</span>) is forbidden only if it was removed from one place and attached in another place, as in the case of idols. For this reason a built grave is forbidden for use. Not so, however, in the case of earth which was dug out for burial purposes and then put back into the same grave.

Glos.) should not be performed, for the blood which also requires burial (v. <i>infra</i>) will thereby be removed. The dead person should therefore be buried in his clothes. This applies only if the person died while wearing his clothes, but if after suffering a fall, the person was confined to bed and died some days later, after his clothes were removed, and there was no bleeding, the <i>Tohorah</i> is performed and the corpse is wrapped in shrouds as usual. There is however, a distinction to be made between the case of one who fell from a roof top and one who was murdered. In the latter case, even if the blood flow had ceased when the corpse was found, he is buried in the condition he was found in order ‘to raise our anger’ and possibly avenge the slain person; whereas in the former case where the person fell from a roof top, this is not applicable. Similarly, in the case of a woman who died in confinement, and the blood flow still continues, we bury her in the garments she wore at the time of death. But if death occurred some days or weeks later, at which time the blood flow had already ceased, we deal with her as with other dead and bury her in shrouds. A further reason for burying a slain person in his clothes is that there is fear that at least a fourth of a <i>Log</i> (v. Glos.) of blood that escaped, — the smallest quantity required to sustain life, — is absorbed in the clothes. Hence, he should be buried in his clothes. For the very same reason even the shoes should not be removed, since there may be a similar quantity absorbed in them. Even the earth surrounding him, which absorbed blood, should be buried. The same principle would therefore apply to one who fell from a roof top, or in the case of a house which collapsed upon a person, or a confinement case, where there was a flow of blood, and consequently there is an absorption thereof in the garments, — in all these cases, since there is an absorption of blood in the garments, — they should be buried with the corpse. This would not apply to one who froze to death or was drowned, for since there was no flow of bloood, they are buried in shrouds as usual — <i>MaHaRIL</i> (<i>ibid</i>.), <i>Ta</i>Z and <i>ShaK</i>.  <i>P.Tesh</i>.</i> <i>Some say that they wrap them over their garments</i> [<i>with</i>] <i>shrouds</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Hag.

            "A <i>Kohen</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Glos.</i> is forbidden to enter beneath an overshadowed space<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lit. ‘a tent.’ Uncleanness through overshadowing (<span>טומאת אהל</span>) takes place in one of three ways: a) when a person or a vessel or food are present together with a corpse (or an olive’s bulk from a corpse) under the same roof space. In this case another object (the roof) forms a tent over the person etc. and the corpse (<span>דבר אחר מאהיל עליו ועל המת</span>); b) when a corpse or an olive’s bulk from a corpse overshadow from above, a person or vessels beneath. In this case the corpse forms the tent; c) when the person is present above the corpse or the olive’s bulk from a corpse. In this case the person overshadows. Cf. Num. XIX, 14.</i> under which there is a corpse, even if it is very large;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Meg. 26b a.e.</i> and [he is] even [forbidden to enter] into another [adjoining] house or another [adjoining] upper storey, which open into that house by means of an opening a square handbreadth in size, and [the prohibition also applies to entering] a house [which opens] into that [latter] house ad infinitum.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Ohol. III, 6-7 from which the following principles are derived: a) If a corpse lies in a room, whatever is within the room suffers corpse-uncleanness, and if the room has many doors or exits, even if they are closed, all objects which lie beneath the lintels of these doors or exits become unclean, because we assume that the corpse may be removed through any one of the exits, at which time the corpse and the objects will be together under the lintels, and the objects will suffer uncleanness through overshadowing (v. <i>supra</i> n. 1a). Hence, we regard the objects and the corpse as if they were already present under the lintels of the door or exits. But if we know through which exit the corpse will be removed, then only that particular exit suffers uncleanness, not the others. This means that that particular exit saves the objects beneath the other exits from uncleanness through overshadowing. The minimum size of such an exit must be one handbreadth square for an olive’s bulk from a corpse in the room, to prevent uncleanness from spreading to the other exits, and a minimum of four handbreadths square opening will prevent the uncleanness from spreading to the other exits in the case where an entire corpse is present in the room. The reason for the different sizes regarding the openings, depends upon the size of the uncleanness, for it is feasible to remove an olive’s bulk from a corpse through an opening one handbreadth square, and an entire corpse through an opening four handbreadths square (v. also Ohol. VII, 3); b) If there are two adjoining houses or rooms and in the intervening wall there is an opening of one handbreadth square, and in one of the houses or rooms there is a corpse or an olive’s bulk from a corpse, the uncleanness passes to the adjoining room or house in which all objects become unclean. In this case the opening need not be more than a square handbreadth in order to give passage to the uncleanness of an entire corpse; c) An object (e.g., a board) which is one handbreadth square and one handbreadth high (i.e., between the board above and the olive’s bulk from a corpse which lies beneath, there is a space of not less than one handbreadth), brings uncleanness to other objects in the same space and forms a partition against uncleanness to objects above it. But if the roof (i.e., the top of the board) is less than one handbreadth high, the uncleanness breaks through the solid matter and rises and goes down. Cf. Ohol. VI, 6; VII, 1-2; IX, 13, 14, 16; X, 6-7; XII, 6-7; XV, 1, 3, 7. <i>ShaK</i> states that the wife of a <i>Kohen</i>, who is pregnant may enter the ‘tent of a corpse’ and there is no fear that she may give birth to a male child who would then be forbidden to be present there, for a double doubt exists: a) perhaps it will be a non-viable birth to which this apprehension does not apply, or b) if it is a viable birth, perhaps it will be a female child. This point, however, is questioned on the principle that ‘a clean object that has been swallowed (in this case, the child within the mother) cannot be rendered unclean’ (<span>טהרה בלועה</span>) (Hul. 71a). Consequently, the following explanation of the above case is offered: We deal here with a case where the time for giving birth has already approached, and there is fear that the child might push out its head and be regarded as born and hence is not regarded as a ‘swallowed object.’ Consequently, since there is a double doubt, the pregnant wife of the <i>Kohen</i> may enter the ‘tent of a corpse’ — <i>P.Tesh.</i> Uncleanness is not conveyed through many openings which together make up one square handbreadth, e.g., in the case of trellis-work. The square handbreadth must be open in one spot for the uncleanness to pass through. Otherwise, the opening is considered stopped up (cf. Ohol. XIII, 1) — <i>Ta</i>Z, <i>ShaK.</i></i> But if one stopped up the opening, it is permissible for him to enter the other [adjoining] house, for the closure forms a partition [against the uncleanness], even if one has not renounced ownership therein<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">e., in the object which serves as a closure.</i> so that it remain there forever.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Mishna and Gemara Shab. 157a and <i>Tosaf.</i> s.v. <span>,הלקטי קטנה</span>.

Samson of Sens</i> and <i>Maim</i>. to Ohol. VI, 2 and cf O.Ḥ § 629, 8. <i>Ta</i>Z reports the ruling of a certain authority in the following case which he analyses and rejects: There was an uncleanness in a house adjoining a Synagogue, which passed through the [Synagogue window in the women’s section, and a ruling was given by a certain authority, that in order to form a partition against the uncleanness, the window opening should be stopped up by the curtain which served as a partition between the men’s and women’s section, and was suspended on iron hooks. <i>Ta</i>Z opposes this ruling (v. however, <i>Ḥid. ha-Gershuni</i> who accepts it) and claims that it is erroneous for the following reasons: a) According to the Mishna Ohol. VIII, 1, a sheet or a mat form a partition against uncleanness only if spread out tentwise, which is not the case here, and hence, the curtain cannot form a partition against the uncleanness of the adjoining house (v. <i>R. Samson of Sens ibid.</i> and Yad, <i>Tumath Meth</i> XIII); b) The reason that the curtain cannot form a partition against the uncleanness is because the law states that vessels (in this case the curtain hooks) cannot form a partition, since the curtain without the hooks would not remain suspended. Consequently, the main items are the hooks and not the curtain (v. Yad <i>Tumath Meth</i> XVIII; B.B. 19b s.v. <span>רואין</span>  this note beg.) c) A partition formed by a door or window that cannot stand without the support of metal hinges is not considered valid (although the hinges are considered as attached to the ground and do not contract uncleanness.  Kel. XI, 2 and cf. Ohol. VI, 2). Hence, the same applies with respect to the curtain and the hooks. <i>ShaK</i>, however, rejects this. Cf. <i>G.Mah.</i> A closure of trellis-work in a metal door does not prevent passage of uncleanness (v. <i>ShaK</i> who modifies this ruling) — <i>Ta</i>Z. It is permissible for a <i>Kohen</i> to travel by train, although there is a possibility that a corpse is being transported. Likewise, is it permitted for a <i>Kohen</i> to travel by plane, although the plane passes over burial grounds — <i>Sh.M.B.</i> (vol IV, p. 278-9).</i>",

Quite a number of laws are enumerated <i>ibid.</i> with respect to overshadowing in connection with hatchways, yet the present law is stated because it contains a novel ruling, viz., that it is permissible to enter the ground floor where the uncleanness is found, and not the upper storey — <i>B.Yos.</i></i> that is between a house [a ground floor] and an upper storey, and there is not in it an opening of a [square] handbreadth [in size], and an olive's bulk from a corpse is in the house directly beneath the hatchway, — [the law is that] the house [ground floor] is clean and the upper storey is unclean<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For the uncleanness breaks through and rises (<span>טומאה בוקעת ועולה</span> v.

The uncleanness does not spread to the sides of the ground floor, for it has an opening above in order to rise — <i>ShaK.</i> The uncleanness does not cleave downwards, back into the lower floor, since the opening is less than a square handbreadth (<i>Asheri</i>). And again, since there is only an olive’s bulk from a corpse in the ground floor, the law is that although the uncleanness will eventually be removed through the door opening, the ground floor does not become unclean now, because the uncleanness which rose to the upper storey, is already regarded as present in the public domain, for the opening is less than a square handbreadth. Hence, we may infer that if a room in a ground floor has no roof space over it (but there is a roof over the upper storey. Thus <i>Ḥid. ha-Gershuni</i> on <i>Ta</i>Z), it is forbidden for a <i>Kohen</i> to be present in any part of the ground floor, for since the uncleanness will ultimately be removed through the door opening of this uncovered ground-room, the uncleanness cleaves back into it and thence through the door opening, for it must be borne in mind that the entire ground-room is uncovered unlike above where the hatchway is less than a square handbreadth in size (v. <i>Ḥid. ha-Gershuni</i>) — <i>Ta</i>Z.</i>.",

Thus <i>Ḥatam Sofer</i> Y.D. § 340, 2), forms a partition against the uncleanness (Ber. 19b).

This ruling applies only where they sent the corpse for burial in another city, but if the burial takes place on the outskirts of the same city, the law is that those who return from the city gates, commence their mourning rites only after they are informed that the corpse had already been buried. Thus <i>N</i> in <i>T.H.</i> and <i>B.Yos.</i> — <i>ShaK.</i> However, if after returning from the city gates where the corpse was buried on the outskirts of the city, they removed their shoes and commenced the observance of mourning rites, and later, after nightfall, those who accompanied the corpse to the graveyard, returned and reported that the corpse was interred when it was still day, the law is that although the mourners commenced their mourning whilst being unaware of the time of burial, the day is regarded as part of the mourning period. This follows from <i>Isserles</i> ruling <i>supra</i> par. 1, where one is required to begin the observance of mourning anew, only when he discovered later that he was mistaken, from which it follows, that if subsequently, as in the present case, it was found that mourning rites began at the proper time, the mourning already observed counts as part of the required period — <i>P.Tesh.</i></i> and those who accompany<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lit. ‘go.’</i> him [the corpse], count [the days of mourning] from [the time] that he is buried.

III, 5(82c) cited by <i>Tosaf.</i> M.K. 22a s.v. (<span>מהדריתן</span>) and <i>Asheri ibid.</i>, although both had different readings in Y. There are three interpretations on this ruling, viz., a) <i>Asheri</i> followed by <i>Tur:</i> If the chief of the family remains here, then even all those who accompany the corpse to the burial place, count the period of mourning from the time that the corpse leaves. If, however, the family chief accompanies the corpse, then even those who remain at home count from the time that the corpse is interred. b) <i>Tosaf.</i> adopts a stringent view, viz., that if the family chief accompanies the corpse, everyone counts from the time of burial (similar to <i>Asheri</i>), but if he remains here, then those who remain with him commence the observance of mourning forthwith, and those who accompany the corpse are required to begin the observance of formal mourning from the time of burial. However, those who accompany the corpse should observe some mourning rites forthwith out of respect to the family chief, although the seven day period of formal mourning begins for them after burial. c) <i>Caro:</i> If the chief of the family accompanies the corpse, then even those who remain here count from the time of burial, from which it follows that if the family chief remains here, we revert to the first ruling recorded at the outset of this par. viz., that those who remain here begin to count the seven days of mourning forthwith, and those who accompany the corpse from the time of burial. Hence, <i>Caro</i>’s interpretation is in accord neither with a) nor b). For according to b) even if the family chief remains here, those who accompany the corpse, it is true, commence the observance of formal mourning from burial, but they are also required to observe some mourning rites forthwith out of respect to the family chief, and according to a) if the family chief remains here, then all, — even those who accompany the corpse, begin the counting of the seven days of mourning from the time the corpse leaves. <i>Caro</i>’s interpretation may be the result of a) a different reading in Y. <i>ibid.</i>, or b) he follows <i>Maim</i>. in Yad <i>ibid</i>. and makes no distinction regarding the family chief and consequently does not take into consideration the stringency of <i>Tosaf.</i> — <i>ShaK. A.H. Caro</i>’s ruling, viz., that when the family chief accompanied the corpse, even those who remain here count from the time of burial, applies only if the family chief will reach the burial place within three days, otherwise they begin counting forthwith and the family chief from burial (v. M.K. 22a) — <i>ShaK.</i>  <i>infra</i> § 399, 14 where <i>Caro</i> rules that ‘one who suffered a bereavement on the eve of a Festival day and he was afraid lest he have not sufficient time to bury the corpse prior to the advent of the Festival whilst it is still day and gave the corpse over to Gentiles to attend to the burial, the law is that as soon as they carry the corpse out of the city and he can no longer be seen by the near-of-kin, mourning takes effect upon him, and if it is one hour prior to the Festival and he observed mourning rites therein, the restrictions of the seven days become annulled although he was buried on the Festival proper.’ This means that even if the corpse was buried on the Festival, in which case mourning is usually postponed until after the Holiday period is over, yet, since the corpse was transferred to the Gentiles prior to the advent of the Festival, it is considered as if the burial had taken place before the Festival and the seven days of mourning become annulled. This presents a difficulty. For in the present ruling it is implied (v. <i>supra</i> n. 7) that if the burial takes place on the outskirts of the city, the mourning period begins from the time of burial. How is it possible for <i>Caro</i> (<i>infra</i> § 399) to rule that the entire period of mourning becomes annulled even if the burial attended to by the Gentiles took place after the advent of the Festival? This apparent contradiction is removed only if we assume that <i>Caro</i> holds that in the case of a Festival the law is different, since from the moment the Jew transfers the corpse to the Gentiles for burial we regard the corpse as having been already interred which is similar to the case of one who is taken out for burial to another city where mourning rites begin from the moment they turn away their faces — <i>D.Merb.</i></i> The chief of the family<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">M.K. 22a.</i> means the one upon whom [the people of] the household depend and who are guided by him, irrespective whether he is a brother or a young son.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus <i>Asheri, Tur</i> a.o.

I shall go to him, but he will not return to me’</i> (II Sam. XII, 23), which implies that were it possible to bring him back again, he would have done so. <i>Ta</i>Z opposes <i>MaHaRShaL</i> and defends this ruling on the grounds that in the case of King David he merely expressed the fact that after death, fasting etc. is of no avail, but prior to death, needless to say, one should engage in prayer and fasting in order to counteract impending death. But once a person has suffered a bereavement, prayer and fasting no longer help. Hence, if one says to a mourner, ‘What could you have done etc.’ it is tantamount to blashphemy.  also <i>P.Tesh.</i> For this very reason the <i>Taḥanun</i> prayer is not recited in a mourner’s home, since it contains the words, ‘I have sinned etc.,’ nor the penitential prayer (<span>והוא רחום</span>) which contains, ‘deal not with us according to our sins’ — <i>A.H.</i>  <i>infra</i> par. 3 and notes.

It is customary, however, that <i>Hallel</i> is said in a house of mourning, only that the mourners leave the room when the <i>Hallel</i> is recited. There is a further reason why the <i>Hallel</i> is omitted by mourners. For it contains verses such as, <i>‘This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will be glad and rejoice thereon,’</i> which is not in keeping with mourning rites. A mourner may recite the <i>Habdalah</i> prayer during the mourning period, but should omit the introductory verses which express joy. Only the benediction of this prayer should be recited by him. If the seventh day of mourning coincides with <i>Rosh Ḥodesh</i>, the mourner should recite the <i>Hallel</i> after the morning services are over, for then he is no longer a mourner — <i>P.Tesh.</i> Cf. <i>supra</i> par. 2 and notes.

Aboth III, 1). The same symbolism may be seen here. An additional reason is that it alludes to purification from uncleanness through water, ashes and the hyssop (Num.

Judah on the authority of Rab. Derived from the words of God to Ezekiel, <i>‘And eat thou not the bread of men’</i> (Ezek. XXIV, 17) whence it follows that for others it is done. Should others, however, not provide him with the first meal, or in the case where he is the only Jewish resident in town, he may eat of his own — <i>Ta</i>Z. Some explain that the reason the first meal is provided by others is that usually the mourner immediately after burial refuses to eat and in some cases prefers death — <i>Perisha.</i> The main part of the mourner’s meal is the bread as may be seen from the verse in Ezek. <i>ibid.</i>, but he may eat other dishes of his own even at the first meal — <i>A.H.</i> It is customary to bring him bread with eggs or lentils. Cf. B.B. 16b where it is stated that on the day that Abraham our father died, Jacob made a broth of lentils to comfort his father Isaac (v. Gen. XXV, 29-30 and <i>Rashi</i> a.l.), and the reason it was of lentils is that ‘just as the lentil has no mouth (i.e., no cleft), so too, the mourner has no mouth (i.e., for speech)’. Others say, ‘Just as the lentil is round, so too, mourning rolls and goes around to all the denizens of this world.’ The practical difference between these two explanations is whether we should comfort with eggs, which have no cleft, but are not perfectly round. Hence, according to the first reason offered in the Talmud (B.B. <i>ibid.</i>) one may provide the mourner’s meal with eggs. Some of the <i>Later Authorities</i> hold that also beverages should be provided by others at the first mourner’s meal — <i>Leḥem ha-Panim</i>.</i> but at the second [meal] he is permitted [to eat of his own] even on the first day [of mourning].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus also <i>Tur</i> and <i>Asheri</i> who explain that the words, ‘on the first day’ mentioned in M.K. <i>ibid.</i> apply only to the first meal.

            "[With respect to selling] his wares in [the case of] business [which if postponed] might entail a loss, [namely], if he should not sell [now] he would suffer the loss of the principal, — [the law is that] the sale may be made through [the agency of] others. However, if he should not suffer the loss of the principal, only that if he sells it now, he will make more profit than if he sells it later, it is forbidden.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Asheri</i> to M.K. 10b (v. <i>Tosaf. ibid.</i> s.v. <span>ובדבר</span>) after an analysis of Y.M.K. II, 3(81b). (<i>Asheri</i>’s version of Y. <i>ibid.</i> is different from cur. edd.). If a buyer should suffer a loss on account of the seller who is in mourning, the latter is permitted to sell through the agency of others, and it is quite possible that even the mourner himself may sell directly — <i>P.Tesh.</i> A distinction should be made between two kinds of business deals, viz., a) In the case of a business deal in which the mourner became interested only incidentally, but his main livelihood is derived from other sources, the law is that he is permitted to transact this incidental deal through the agency of others only when he suffers a loss if it is postponed; b) In the case of one, however, whose permanent source of income depends upon such transactions, even the prospective profit may be considered on the same footing as the principal, for the individual depends upon it for his livelihood. Consequently, the prohibition applies only in the case where he would make more profit now than later. But if, at present, he would make the same profit as later, it is permissible to sell through the agency of others, since there is also the possibility that later he will not make any profit at all — <i>A.H.</i></i> Yet, if caravans or ships arrived,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Similarly, if the market day coincides with his seven days of mourning, even if it is on a small scale, he is permitted to transact business through the agency of others. If a mourner has a shop, and should he keep it closed, it would entail a heavy monetary loss, his wife may keep it open for him — <i>Later Codifiers.</i> One who suffered a bereavement while he was out of town, and was unaware of this, the law is that his friends (or his wife and children, who normally would be forbidden to do his work, since their labour belongs to him) may carry on his work — <i>Ḥok. Adam.</i> If, while he was away from home, it became known to him that he had suffered a bereavement, but those at home were unaware of this, the law is that he is not required to inform them thereof in order that they close his store or business— <i>Resp.

But if the mourner is a prominent person and the partnership is called by his name, so that even if [the other partner] will do work in his own house it is known that the mourner has a share in it, — [the law is that] the other partner is forbidden to do work even in his house.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Y.M.K. III, 5(82) bot. where the ruling is mentioned that ‘two partners … must close their shop.’ However, from M.K. 11b in the case of Marion, the son of Rabin and Mar, the son of R. Aḥa, it appears that only in the case of a distinguished person we would rule thus, but not in other cases. This apparent contradiction is removed by <i>RaBaD</i> as follows: In Y. we deal with work done publicly (cf. the term <span>חנות</span> -shop used <i>ibid.</i>), whereas in B. it refers to work carried on privately. Hence, Caro’s ruling here. There are many authorities who adopt a lenient view with respect to partnership. Moreover, the leniency is extended even to cases where the shop belongs to the mourner alone, on the principle that it is impossible to keep one’s shop closed for the entire week which would entail great losses. The question, however, may be raised, — on what basis is such a leniency adopted? For even drawing up a bill of sale between the mourner and his partner or any other person, would not be helpful since the reason for the prohibition is on account of ‘appearance sake’ (<span>מראית עין</span>) and consequently, people will still know that the shop belongs to the mourner. <i>RaShaL</i> (<i>Resp.</i> 66) is lenient in this matter after three days (and part of the third day is considered a full day). Yet <i>Maim.</i> in Yad, <i>Ebel</i> V, 9 states that the prohibition remains in force for seven days. <i>A.H.</i> advances the following argument in favour of the lenient practice: With respect to a matter which entails an irretrievable loss if postponed, we find that mourning and <i>Ḥol ha-Moed</i> are on an equal footing (v. O.Ḥ. § 539 where it is stated that if the market day falls on <i>Ḥol ha-Moed</i> the individual may sit in his shop). Hence, we see that if a loss is involved, the question of conducting business publicly does not enter. Similarly, in the case of mourning. In Prague it was customary to dissolve the partnership or to transfer one’s business by means of <span>קנין סודר</span>, i.e., a legal form of acquisition by handing over an article (e.g., a scarf) from one party to the other as a symbol that the object itself has been transferred. Some would transfer the business while still in the observance of <i>Aninuth;</i> others, whilst the person was in his dying condition.  also <i>P.Tesh.</i> and <i>Later Authorities.</i></i>",

The undefined term <span>רחיצה</span> (bathing) refers to warm water (v. Y.M.K. III, 5(82d) ; cf. <i>infra</i> § 399 and O.H. § 549).

But since we permit combing of the hair today (v. <i>infra</i> § 390), it would be permissible to bathe after seven days. <i>RaShaL’s</i> reason for the prohibition of bathing is on account of hair-cutting. Hence, bathing should be forbidden just as hair-cutting is. On <i>Ḥol ha-Moed</i>, however, we find that hair-cutting is forbidden and bathing is permitted. This difficulty may be removed on the grounds that on <i>Ḥol ha-Moed</i> the prohibition of hair-cutting applies to everyone as a result of which people will remember and be careful. Consequently, bathing is permitted. But in the case of mourning, it applies only to the individual mourner. Hence, there is fear lest he forget (cf.

            "A mourner is forbidden to wash his garment during the entire seven days [of mourning],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Talmudic days there were two kinds of washing: a) <span>כיבוס</span> i.e., plain washing, and b) <span>גיהוץ</span> i.e., laundry work. In Ket. 10b it is stated that ‘our (i.e., Babylonian) laundry work is like their (i.e., Ereẓ Israel) washing.’ In the Land of Israel the plain washing was superior to the Babylonian, because they had either better water or better ingredients for washing. In order to procure satisfactory results, they would have to do fine laundry work in Babylonia, and that would include smoothing the cloth or garment with a stone, or according to <i>Rashi</i> (<i>ibid</i>.) with a gloss-stone.  S. <i>Krauss T.A.</i> I, 156, 581 and cf. Ta‘an. 29b. There are two main views held among the authorities regarding these terms. 1) During the seven days of mourning every type of washing is forbidden for two reasons — a) It entails work. Hence, not only the mourner is forbidden to wash his clothes, but others are also forbidden to do this for him (v. <i>supra</i> § 380); b) There is a prohibition against wearing even garments that were washed prior to the time that mourning sets in. <i>This is derived from, ‘And Joab sent to Tekoa and fetched thence a wise woman and said unto her: I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner and put on mourning apparel, I pray thee, and annoint not thyself with oil but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead’</i> (II Sam. XIV, 2) — M.K. 15a. With respect to the thirty days of mourning, no prohibition against washing (<span>כיבוס</span>) is found in the Talmud; only the prohibition against laundry work (<span>גיהוץ</span>) applies then. During the entire thirty days the mourner is forbidden to wear laundried garments (M.K. 23a), and R. Eleazar b. R. Simeon forbade only new white linen clothes, and Raba (<i>ibid.</i>) rules in accord with the latter.  also <i>ibid.</i> 27b; Yeb. 43a and <i>Rashi</i> a.l.; Yad, <i>Ebel</i> V, 1, 3; VI, 4. This represents the view of <i>Rashi, Maim.</i> and <i>Alfasi.</i> 2) Even washing (<span>כיבוס</span>) is forbidden for thirty days. This is derived from Sem(H). VII, 4, where it is stated, ‘One who did not wash garments on the eve of a Festival should not wash for thirty days.’ The Talmudic texts (cited <i>supra</i> 1) are explained as follows: Yeb. <i>ibid.</i> is interpreted according to this viewpoint as referring only to those persons enumerated in Mishna, M.K. III, 2. Regarding M.K. 27b, the text should be emended to read, ‘thirty days for washing (<span>כיבוס</span>), and as to M.K. 15a, it should be understood as referring to washing in water only, which is permitted during the thirty days save the seven days of mourning. However, washing with natron and lye is forbidden (M.K. 23a, Tosaf. s.v. <span>כל</span>). — This is the viewpoint held by <i>RIBA.

Consequently, the mourning rites must be observed after the Festival. However, this excludes rending of garments which must be done immediately after death from the moment of excitement’ (<span>שעת חימום</span>), and the entire seven days are considered a ‘moment of excitement.’ Hence, the ruling here.

Likewise, if one received a report that his father died and a relative of his informed him that the death report was incorrect and after two days elapsed the relative informed him that the original report was correct, the law is that the mourner counts from the time he received the first death report — <i>P.Tesh.</i></i>",

This is not to be compared to a Festival, in which case mourning is postponed until after the Festival (v. <i>infra</i> § 399), for in the latter case the individual proper was obligated to observe mourning rites, only that the Festival interrupts this. Moreover, on a Festival private mourning is still observed. Nor is this case be compared to the law of <i>Habdalah</i> with respect to a mourner (v. <i>supra</i> § 341, 23 and notes), for the <i>Habdalah</i> prayer may be recited during the first three days of the week (v. <i>ibid</i>.), whereas mourning rites take effect from the moment the tomb is closed by the <i>Golel</i>, and since at that moment the minor was exempt, mourning no longer takes effect.  <i>Ta</i>Z for lengthy discussion on this ruling who finally agrees with <i>Caro.</i></i> and he is not obligated therein.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The twelve month period, however, should be observed by the minor who became of age after burial, since this is done out of deference to one’s parents and is considered an independent mourning rite not connected with the seven and thirty days of mourning.

Furthermore, the principle is that in ‘any matter which eventually will be exposed people do not lie’ (v. R.H. 22b; Yeb. 93b). Although we compare mourning to the laws of evidence on which a woman is permitted to remarry, we may ask the following: In the case of a woman there is an additional reason (excluding the reason of evidence) for granting her permission to remarry, viz., ‘A woman is careful to make inquiries prior to remarriage’ (<span>דיקא ומנסבא</span>) (Yeb. 116b), which is not so in the case of mourning. How can we therefore, compare the two cases? There are, therefore, some authorities who hold that the permission granted the woman is based mainly on the evidence of the single witness. It may, however, be possible that in the case of the woman we adopt a stringent view and require both the principle of evidence plus the fact that she also makes her own inquiries, whereas in the case of mourning a lenient view is adopted and the principle of evidence alone suffices — <i>A.H.</i> (Evidence offered in writing is also accepted in the case of permitting a woman to remarry.  E.H. <i>ibid</i>). One who received a letter informing him that his near-of-kin died, and in the letter it is not stated whether it is still within or after the thirty days of mourning, the law is that if the sender is not a learned person, we presume that the deceased person was alive until the time that the letter was written and dispatched (for an exposition of this type of presumption v. <i>A.H.</i> a.l.). Hence, the receiver of the letter must observe mourning rites. But if the sender was a learned person, we presume that the thirty day period is over, for were it possible for the letter to reach the mourner within the thirty days of mourning, the sender would not have stated the death report without defining the matter — <i>ShaK.</i> But if the deceased person was his father or mother, since the adopted custom is to inform the mourner about the death of a parent forthwith, in any case, the mourner is required to observe mourning rites — <i>Birke Yos.</i> If it happened that in a doubtful case it was ruled for one not to observe mourning, and subsequetly it became known to the individual that originally when the doubt was entertained regarding the death of his near-of-kin, the latter had really died, and it was still at the time the doubt was entertained within the thirty days, the law is that the mourner does not have to observe mourning rites (thus corrected text of <i>ShaK</i> in <i>Nek.

Consequently, we may conclude that a death report received on the thirtieth day (excluding the Sabbath) is regarded as near tidings. The thirtieth day is calculated according to the locality of the mourner and not the place of death, e.g., if one who lives in United States or Canada receives a death report from Europe on the thirtieth day, although in Europe at that time it was already the thirty-first day, we follow the locality of the mourner with respect to determining whether it is near or distant tidings — <i>Resp.

One may light a <i>Yahrzeit</i> lamp on a Holiday — <i>Ketab Sofer.</i> One who is in doubt whether the <i>Yahrzeit</i> should be observed on the fourth or the fifth day of the month, — the law is that if he has other brothers elsewhere who know the exact day when <i>Yahrzeit</i> falls (it is understood that he is unable to contact them in order to determine the correct day), he should observe the <i>Yahrzeit</i> on the fourth day (i.e., the first doubtful day). But it there is no one else in the family to observe the <i>Yahrzeit</i>, he must observe both days — <i>Ḥatam Sofer.</i></i> <i>If this day occurred on a day during which Taḥanun</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Glos.</i> <i>is not recited, one does not fast at all</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus also if the <i>Yahrzeit</i> day falls on the day when one’s child is to be circumcised, the father or the <i>Sandek</i> or the <i>Mohel</i>, who may be observing <i>Yahrzeit</i>, do not fast. Likewise, in the case of the redemption of a first-born child, the father or the <i>Kohen</i> who may be observing <i>Yahrzeit</i>, do not fast — O.Ḥ. <i>ibid.</i> par. 9.  <i>Ta</i>Z and <i>Sha‘are Tesh. ibid.</i> So too, a groom during the seven days of his wedding-feast, does not fast on the <i>Yahrzeit</i> day. However, one observing <i>Yahrzeit</i> is not permitted to eat at the feast held on the completion of a Talmudical tracate (<span>סיום</span>) — <i>ShaK.</i> One who does not know the day of his father’s or mother’s death, should select a certain day during the year on which to observe the <i>Yahrzeit</i> and fast, but he may not encroach upon the rights of others with respect to the <i>Kaddish</i> — <i>M.Abr.</i> (O.Ḥ. § 568, n. 20). If one who has to observe <i>Yahrzeit</i> is unable to say Kaddish, e.g., when he is on the road, he may recite <i>Kaddish</i> at the evening service (<i>Ma‘arib</i>) following the <i>Yahrzeit</i> day — <i>Matte Efrayyim</i>. If at the place of death it was already night when the person died and at the place of the near-of-kin it was still day, the <i>Yahrzeit</i> day is fixed according to the place of death — <i>Sh.M.B. contra Kol Bo</i>(<i>G</i>).

Consequently, if one dies on <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Kislev</i> when <i>Rosh Ḥodesh</i> is observed only one day, — the law is that in a subsequent year when <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Kislev</i> consists of two days, the <i>Yahrzeit</i> should be observed on the second day of <i>Rosh Ḥodesh</i>, which is the first day of the month of <i>Kislev.</i> However, if one died on the first day of <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Kislev</i> when <i>Rosh Ḥodesh</i> consisted of two days, the question is — when should one observe <i>Yahrzeit</i> in a subsequent year when <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Kislev</i> consists of one day only? Should one observe the <i>Yahrzeit</i> on the twenty-ninth day of <i>Ḥeshvan</i>, since the death took place on the last day of <i>Ḥeshvan</i>, or do we say that since in matters pertaining to vows (v. end of <i>Gloss anon</i>) we follow the language of the people, he should observe <i>Yahrzeit</i> on <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Kislev?</i> — The following procedure should be adopted: If during the first year following the death, <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Kislev</i> is observed for one day only, the <i>Yahrzeit</i> should be observed on the twenty-ninth day of <i>Ḥeshvan.</i> Thus also whenever the month of <i>Ḥeshvan</i> is defective, then on the following day (i.e., <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Kislev</i>), if there are no mourners in the Synagogue, he should also recite the <i>Kaddish</i> and lead the services. But if during the year following the death, <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Kislev</i> consists of two days, consequently, the <i>Yahrzeit</i> becomes fixed for <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Kislev</i> and he should observe it thus every subsequent year, even when <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Kislev</i> consists of one day. The same principle applies to other months which are sometimes full and sometimes defective — <i>M.Abr.</i> Since <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Tebeth</i> is sometimes observed one day, in which case the sixth day of <i>Ḥanukkah</i> is the first of <i>Tebeth</i>, the seventh day, — the second of <i>Tebeth</i> and the eighth day, — the third of <i>Tebeth;</i> and sometimes <i>Rosh Ḥodesh Tebeth</i> consists of two days, i.e., the sixth and seventh day of <i>Ḥanukkah</i>, in which case the seventh day of <i>Ḥanukkah</i> is the first day of <i>Tebeth</i> and the eighth day, — the second day of <i>Tebeth</i>, — consequently, one who observes <i>Yahrzeit</i> during these days should not err by counting the days of <i>Ḥanukkah</i>, but one must always count the days of the month — <i>M.Abr.</i></i> <i>and  O.H.</i> § 568, 8. <i> supra</i> § 391 <i>that one should not eat at a feast on the night of</i> [<i>which the following</i>] <i>day is the death anniversary of one's father or/and mother</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> <i>supra</i> § 391, 3, <i>Gloss</i> n. 38.</i> [<i>If</i>] <i>this fast falls on the eve of the Sabbath, the law is as</i> [<i>on</i>] <i>other fastday</i>[<i>s</i>]. <i> O.H. § 249</i>. <i>In any case</i>, — [<i>the law is that</i>] <i>if the first time one fasted the whole day, one should adopt this practice all the days of his life</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For it is then regarded as a vow. Hence, he must always fast on that day. Should one, however, be ill or should there be any other reason which prevents him from observing the fast-day, he must first be released from his vow. But if, prior to observing the first fast-day, one explicitly stated that he fasts on the condition that this should not be regarded as a vow for the following year, he does not require any release (v. O.Ḥ. § 568 and <i>Ḥ. Adam</i>).</i>"
