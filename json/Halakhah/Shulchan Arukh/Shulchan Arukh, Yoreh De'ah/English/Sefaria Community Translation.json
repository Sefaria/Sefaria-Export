It is forbidden to cut it with a knife before it gets washed [86] and if cut, the knife must be kashered.

Even if it is before the required salting time has passed (53) there is no prohibition on the knife, rather the problem is now that blood had come out from the meat to its surface, if one wants to now wash off that spot and go re-salt it one may do so. If one wants to then go and perform a salting in order to preserve the meat after it has been property salted for blood in a vessel with holes, [92] then the meat must be washed off well and re-salted. It may even be re-salted in a vessel without holes. If one wants [93] to salt meat and eat it roasted without washing one may do so and we are not worried about the blood that is on the salt, for the fire sucks out the blood and the salt can not absorb it. This is when it is salted and put on to be roasted, but if it sat in the salt, the salt absorbs blood, and the meat becomes forbidden. Therefore, it must be washed off well, then roasted, and then it may be eaten. See later on in section 76 regarding the law for meat that was salted without being washed off, and then roasted) ",

Rema: And if they  were salted in a vessel that does not have any holes, they are permitted.  (2) [5] Nevertheless, initially they require salting in a vessel with holes and  a preliminary washing as any other meat. Some disagree regarding the  paunch and say that it does contain blood, [6] even post facto the paunch  and reticulum of the ruminant stomach is forbidden as any other meat.  However the fat that is upon them is as any other meat. Therefore when  the rectum and other intestines are salted [7] they are not salted on the  inner part over the actual food, (3) rather on the outside where the fat is  attached. Rema: If the rectum was salted on the inner side and not on the  outer side it is as if it wasn’t salted. [8] if it was cooked this way it is not  kosher [9] if it has fat on the outside. If it wasn’t cooked yet (4) [10] go back  and salt the outer part [11] and it is then permitted. Eggs that are found in  poultry after being slaughtered if only the yolk was formed but not the white  part of the egg, then it must be salted as any other meat. (5) [12] and it  may be salted with other meat, if even the white part has been formed,  even if the shell on it is as hard as the shell on eggs which are sold in the  market, it is customary to salt it. However one must be careful not to salt it  with other meat, put post facto one need not worry. All fat, even of poultry  is considered as all other meat for the purposes of salting and washing. ", 
            "Intestines without fat on them, even though not containing blood (6) [13]  may be salted with other meat. Rema: Some forbid them to be salted with  other meat (7) and this is initially how one should act, however post facto it  is permitted.   ", 
            "The fat of the winding coil that is on the bowel is full of vessels containing  blood. Therefore some forbid it to be cooked, even if cut and salted, but  now we customarily permit it. Those blood vessels, which if someone is  expert in, may be stretched and properly hung until not even one remains.   "

Furthermore, if it is withheld from someone, it is equivalent to murder [lit. spilling blood].

Someone should not occupy themselves with practicing medicine unless they are an expert, and there is not a greater [physician] available.

They do not die his cheeks, and they do not annoint him, and they do not wash him, and they do not stuff up his orifices, and they do not remove the pillow from under him, and they do not place him on sand nor on clay nor on earth, and they do not place a pot or a trowel or a pitcher of water or a grain of salt on his stomach, and they do not announce about him to the cities, and they do not hire flautists and lamenters, and they do not close his eyes, until his soul departs.

And they do not tear over him and they do not remove their shoes and they do not eulogize over him and they do not bring a coffin into the house with him until he dies.  And they do not open about him with [the post-death blessing of] justifying the judgment until his soul departs.  Gloss: and some say that they do not dig a grave, even tough it is not with him in the house, until after he dies.  (Rivash 114)  It is forbidden to dig any grave to be open until the next day, that they not bury him in it on that day, and there is danger in the matter.  (Rabbenu Yeruham in the name of R. Yehudah he-Hassid, ob\"n)  And so it is forbidden to cause the dead person to die quickly.  Such as one who was dying for a long time and he could not separate, it is forbidden to remove the pillow or the mattress from underneath hum, because they say that there are feathers of some birds that cause this, and similarly they should not move him from his place.  And similarly it is forbidden to place the keys of the synagogue under his head, in order that he take leave.  But if there is something there that is causing delay in the departure of the soul, such as if there is a banging noise next to that house, such as a wood chopper, or there is salt on his tongue, and thes eare preventing the departure of the soul, it is permmitted to remove it from there, that in this there is no activity at all, rather he removes the barrier (it is all in the glosses of Alfasi in the chapter \"these shave\")...."
