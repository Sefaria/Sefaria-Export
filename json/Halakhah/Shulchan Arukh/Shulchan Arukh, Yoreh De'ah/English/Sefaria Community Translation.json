            "1.\tAll may slaughter (shecht), at the outset, even women . Rema: {There are those that say that women should not be permitted to shecht, as we have already established a custom that (women) are not to shecht, and thus the tradition (holds) that women do not shecht.} Slaves and anyone, even if you do not know that he does not faint (because of shechting), even if you do not know if he is an expert that knows the laws of shechita (kosher slaughter), it is permitted from the outset to let him shecht and it is permitted to eat from his shechita. This is because the majority of those that regularly shecht are under the presumption of being tested experts (in shechita). What situation are we talking about here? (We are talking about  a situation) where that person is not in front of us, only then is it permitted to eat from his shechita, and we rely on the presumption (referenced to above). However if he is before us we need to check him, if he is an expert and knows the laws of shechita, however we do not need to ask if he faints. Rema: {There are those that say that one should only rely on the presumption after the fact,and that initially the presumption should not be relied upon if you are in a place where you can clarify him (the Shochet's [kosher slaughterer's] abilities). All this applies to those that aren't proficient and need to know if this Shochet is proficient. But the Shochet himself shall not shecht, even if he knows the laws of shechita and is proficient, until he has shechted 3 times in front of a learned man and one that is proficient in the laws of shechita. Therefor we practice that a man shall not shecht without having obtained kabalah (ordination) from before a learned one.      And the learned one should not give kabalah until he knows that he (the Shochet) knows the laws of shechita and is proficient with his hands. Therefor we practice that all who come to shecht we trust them initially and we don't check them before or after. Because all that are found to be shechting have already received kabalah from before a learned one. And in a few places they are more stringent. That the one who received (kabalah) also gets a written letter from the learned one, as proof that he has given him kabalah. And every Shochet, even though he has recieved kabalah, it is fitting that he should return to the chapters of laws of shechita. That they (the laws of shechita) should live in his mouth and in his heart, so that he will not forget them. And like in the laws of shechita and with one that comes to shecht thus is the ruling in the laws of bedikaht hare'ah (checking the lungs for disqualifying sickness) and one that comes to check (the lungs). And their (shechita's and behikah's) rules and customs are all equal in all of this. And it is fitting for a Jewish court to investigate and the bodkim (checkers of disqualifying sickness) and shochtim (kosher slaughterers). Because large is the transgression in bedikot and shechitot, that are applicable to all. And if they checked some Shochet or bodek and it is found that he does not know, if at one time he received kabbalah we do not deem all everything he has shechted in the past to be treif (unkosher), for we say that only now did he become bad. But if one has never received kabalah, everything that he has shechted will become treif, and also all the dishes on which what he shechted was cooked would need to be kashered}...",
            "2.\tOne does not need to know all of the different details of the laws (of shechita), rather if one says \"concerning this matter I would be in doubt and ask (a competent authority)\", such an individual is called \"knowledgeable\", until he calls that which is forbidden permitted. Rema: {And we check him about the laws of shechita that will be explained later in the beginning of S23 and in the rules of checking of the knife and in the rules of checking the simanim after shechita that will be explained in S25. And if he shechts and is not here in front of us to check, we none the less check the simanim to see if the majority of them was shechted, because whatever is possible to check we do. And this is all in places where there is not a custom to get kabbalah, but in places where the custom is to get kabbalah, like the sons of Ashkenaz and others that follow them, we do not customarily check after him at all, as will be explained (later)}...",
            "3.\tA person who we know that he does not know the laws of shechita, even if he shechts in front of us 4 or 5 times a proper and fitting shechita, and afterwards shechts privately his shechita is not kosher. Even if they ask him, \"did you do such and such?\" and from his answer it seems he shechted correctly, we do not rely on him. And even if he says \"It is clear to me that I shechted beautifully.\" Rema: {a person who regularly faints, and we know he is not muchzak (established as not fainting), and he shechts and says \"It is clear to me that I did not faint\", (he is) believed. This is because he knows the laws of shechita.} And someone who we know does not know the laws of shechita, we can let him shecht if someone supervises him. This is only if he watches him from the beginning of the shechita until the end of it (the shechita). Rema: {And some are strict and forbid to let him shecht lehathila (initially). This is because he does not know the laws of schechita, and thus is the practice.}.",
            "4.\tIf his goats or chickens are lost or stolen, and he found them properly slaughtered; in a place where the majority of people are Jews (and also the majority of the thieves in the city are Jews), they are permissible (to eat) - whether he found them in the market or he found them in the refuse heap of a home. But if he found them in the refuse heap in the market, they are forbidden.",

Even if others are standing over them. And if they (none the less) shechted, their shechita is kosher if others were standing over them. But we do not allow them to shecht lehat’hila when others are not stand standing over them, even if we want to feed (the meat) to dogs. If a minor knows how to train his hands, if others are standing over him, he can shecht lehat’hila and it is allowed to eat from his shechita. Rema: { However, if he shechts for himself, than his shechita is disqualified, even if he knows the laws of shechita; he is considered a minor with regards to this matter (of shechita) until he has become bar-mitzvah, which is 13 years and 1 day [old]. There are those that are strict to not give kabalah to anybody less than 18 years old. For then he is a “man with wisdom”, and knows to be careful.}",

Anyone who \"breaches the fence\" to eat meat without checking the lungs should be bitten by a snake.  Rema- We have the custom to also inflate every lung, even if there is nothing wrong with it.

The sircha is not considered \"in order\" except when it is connecting two lobes one next to the other from chituch (flat side overlapped by the neighboring lobe) of one to the chituch of the other, even if the sircha is diagonal or penetrates into the neighboring lobe. However, if the sircha goes from the back of a lobe to the back of the neighboring lobe or even from the chituch to the back of the neighboring lobe, or from the outer edge of the lobe to the outer edge of the neighboring lobe or from the edge of the lung to chituch of the other, or even from the point of one to the point of the other that is next to it, or even from the point of one the chituch of the other that is next to it, it is called \"out of order.\" Rema- There are those who say that even when the sircha is \"in order\" it needs to be checked to make sure there is no hole in the lung. Because we are not experts in checking for things that can be problems one should consider any sircha (including \"in order\") treifa, and there are those who say it is kosher if the sircha extends from the origin of the lobes up to the middle of them (by width) even if it is open on both sides.

If one wants [93] to salt meat and eat it roasted without washing one may do so and we are not worried about the blood that is on the salt, for the fire sucks out the blood and the salt can not absorb it. This is when it is salted and put on to be roasted, but if it sat in the salt, the salt absorbs blood, and the meat becomes forbidden. Therefore, it must be washed off well, then roasted, and then it may be eaten. See later on in section 76 regarding the law for meat that was salted without being washed off, and then roasted) ",

When one quickly removes the piece before it exudes the milk that it absorbed, meaning before the pot rests from its boiling.  But if he didn't remove it before it was able to exude the milk it absorbed, even if a non Jew tastes it and it has no taste at all, (Rama) it's forbidden unless there is sixty.  <i>See chapter 98 (Shulchan Arukh, Yoreh De'ah 98) that we aren't accustomed to rely on the tasting of a non-Jew and we need sixty every time.</i> ",

And also if it was stirred at the beginning or covered immediately even though it wasn't stirred or covered at the end, all of the pot joins together, if it was stirred or covered immediately when the prohibited matter fell in (Tur and Bet Yosef in the name of the Ri N Haviv.)</i>  Therefore, if [the milk] fell into the soup or onto a piece and we don't know onto which piece it fell, stir the whole pot until it's all mixed.  If in the whole pot there is a taste of milk, it's prohibited, and if not, it's permitted.

However if the piece was in the gravy – according to Rashi [all] [according to the R”Y] even partially - or even it is completely out of the gravy and the pot is stirred or covered the gravy will spread the taste and mix it into the entire mixture.",
            "5. The law the roasting is only forbidden a n'tila applies in cases like a sinew roasted with the hind leg, because the sinew is lean (or thin) and therefore it does not have the strength to spread to the entire piece. However, a fatty sinew that is roasted with its fat, if there is not in the entire sinew 60 against all the fat, it is forbidden to eat even from the tip of its ear, because shuman is spread completely (until 60). But if it is lean, even though there is not 60 against all the fat, it is only forbidden a thumbnail's worth since the fat of a lean animal is also lean. Even if the forbidden piece is lean and the permitted piece that is roasted with it is fatty, the issur (forbidden) will be spread throughout. Anything that has the ability to spread, and we know the exact place it fell during roasting, even though there is 60 to nullify the issur, that area is (still) forbidden a thumbnail's worth. (Mordechai in the name of several sages, and the Smak, and the Issur v'Heter Rule 14 and iggur in the name of the Maharil). <i> Rama: Anything cooked without gravy or baked has the law of roasting (Tur and Beis Yosef). And there are those who say that we are not experts in knowing what is lean and what is fatty, therefore we forbid in all cases until 60. Even if there is 60, the area of contact is forbidden a thumbnail's worth (Aruch) and this is the custom. This (law) is specifically (applied to) fats, or other issurim that can be considered fatty. However, in a case where the issur is not at all fatty, and without question it is lean, the area of contact is only forbidden a thumbnail's worth. (See Seif 9) (This is what is stated in the Beis Yosef).</i>"

But if you did roast them, this is permitted - and even if the piece of forbidden meat was very fatty and the piece of permitted meat was lean. But if the oven is large enough to hold 12 <i>esronim</i>, and its mouth is open, then it is permitted to roast them in it as long as they do not touch one another. And if one of them is covered with a bowl or with dough or the like, it is permitted to roast them, even in a small oven with a closed mouth. <i>Comment: The same is true for meat with milk - the ruling is also thus. And it is customary to be strict before the fact, even with a large oven, and after the fact to be lenient even with a small oven. But, if one baked a loaf of bread with meat, it is forbidden to eat it with milk if he has another loaf. And thus if an idolator baked a loaf of bread with something prohibited, it is prohibited to buy that loaf if he has another loaf - because all this is an instance of \"before the fact.\" But if he has no other loaf available, both are permitted, because this is an instance of \"after the fact.\" There are some who say that we do not permit on the basis of smell not being an issue, even after the fact, unless the oven is open from the side or above where the smoke can escape. But in a case of financial loss we are not stringent after the fact, even if the oven is completely closed. If the prohibited thing is pungent, and all the more so if the permitted thing is pungent, smell is an issue and even after the fact it is prohibited, if the two of them are uncovered. But if one of them is covered, even as is common with dough, it is permitted. If they baked or roasted a prohibited thing and a permitted thing under one (covered) frying pan, uncovered (from one another) this is prohibited even after the fact. The same is true if they baked a loaf of bread with meat in such a manner, it is prohibited to eat it with milk. But one after the other there is no concern, unless there was sweat from the pan in both of them, because this is like the cover of a pot. There are some who say that any time we say smell is an issue and prohibit after the fact, that is specifically because there is not 60 times as much of what is permitted as what is prohibited. But if there is 60 times what is permitted, even among everything that is in the oven, the prohibited thing is nullified. And for the sake of loss this is the custom. Three are some who say that a prohibited thing that prohibits something, for example leavening on Passover, smell is an issue and it prohibits even after the fact, if the oven is small and closed, and the prohibited thing and the permitted thing are uncovered within the oven.

But if he [the idolater] intends only for his own benefit, he [the Jew] should transgress rather than be killed. If, however, it is a time of legislation (only against Jews) (Beis Yosef in the name of the Nimukei Yosef), even about the strap of one’s shoes he should be killed rather than transgress. Rama: And this is only if they wish to make him violate a negative commandment; if they made a law that one should not fulfill positive commandments, however, he does not need to fulfill it if he will be killed (Ran Shabbos Perek BaMeh Tomnin and Nimukei Yosef Sanhedrin Perek Sorer uMoreh). Nonetheless, if the hour requires it and he wishes to fulfill it and be killed, he may do so (Maharik Shoresh 88). Shulchan Aruch: And by idolatry, sexual prohibitions, and murder, even in private and not a time with legislation and even if the idolater intends it only for his own benefit, he must be killed rather than transgress. Rama: And this is only when they tell him to do an action: for instance, if they tell a man to transgress a sexual prohibition or he will be killed. If they force a woman to have sex or throw him over a child to murder it or he is already erect and they force him to have forbidden sex, he need not be killed (Beis Yosef in the name of Tosfos and Ran Psachim Perek Kol Sha’ah). All prohibitions of idolatry and sexuality and murder - even if they are not punishable by death, just prohibitions without explicit punishment - he must be killed rather than transgress. On the prohibition of “Do not put a stumbling block before the blind” he may transgress rather than be killed (Ran Psachim Perek Kol Sha’ah and Sanhedrin Perek Ben Sorer uMoreh). An idolater sleeping with a Jewish woman is not included as a sexual prohibition (Beis Yosef in the name of the Ramban and the authorities cited above). Idolaters who told a Jew, “Give us one of you so we may kill him” - they may not give him over unless they [the idolaters] singled him out and said, “Give us Ploni” (Mishnah Trumos 8, Rambam Yesodei haTorah 5). There are those who say that even in this case, one should not give him over unless he is already liable for death like Sheva ben Bichri (Beis Yosef in the name of Rashi and the Ran). Likewise, women who were told by idolaters, “Give us one of you so we may rape [lit. make impure] her” - they must all be raped rather than hand over one Jewish life (Rambam ibid). Any place where it is said, “Be killed rather than transgress,” if he transgressed and was not killed, even though he has desanctified the Name, nonetheless he is considered forced and is not liable. This is only where he could not have fled - if he could have fled, and did not do so, he is like a dog sitting on his vomit and is considered to have transgressed deliberately (Beis Yosef in the name of the Rambam Yesodei haTorah 5).",
            "Shulchan Aruch: It is forbidden for a man to claim that he is an idolater so that they will not kill him; if, however, so that they will not know he is a Jew, he changes his clothes during a time of legislation, this is permitted, since he does not say that he is an idolater. Rama: Even if he must wear shaatnez (Nimukei Yosef Bava Kama Perek haGozel (the second one)). Even though it is forbidden to say that he is an idolater, nonetheless he may say things that can be interpreted multiple ways (Nimukei Yosef Bava Kama Perek haGozel) and the idolaters will understand that he has said that he is an idolater while he means something else. Likewise, if he can trick them so that they will think he is an idolater, this is permitted (Trumas HaDeshen Siman 197). In the same vein, one who desires another man’s wife - if his wife can sleep with him such that he will believe he is sleeping with the forbidden woman, this is permitted (ibid in the Nimukei Yosef). All of this is permitted only where there is a danger, but where there is no danger - for instance, he wears idolaters’ clothes so they will not recognize that he is a Jew so that he can avoid the tax or suchlike - that is forbidden (Hagahos Ashiri and Nimukei Yosef Bava Kama Perek haGozel (the second) and Trumas haDeshen Siman 196 and other authorities).",

Likewise, the law is that if she sees blood for 2 or 3 days and subsequently stops seeing blood, she should do an internal examination on the day she stopped seeing blood in order to establish her tahara status. This internal examination should be done just prior to the onset of halachic twilight (ie. just before sunset). [And this is the way one should ideally act; but if, after the fact, even if she only did an internal examination in the morning and found no blood, that would suffice.] A person should always teach his wife to [be stringent for the ideal ruling and] do internal examination on the day she stops seeing blood using a compressed wad of cloth which should be inserted for the entire time of halachic twilight, because this type of internal examination frees us from doubt. [Gloss: There are authorities who say that if the local community has prayed the evening prayer while it is still early in the day, a woman is no longer able to do an internal examination and begin counting and wearing her white garments the following day, because of the fact that the local community has already established it as nighttime. There are also authorities who say that she would be permitted to do so even if the local community had accept the Sabbath; our practice is to ideally be stringent, but after the fact one does not have to worry about the stringent opinions. There are some women who act as follows: If she did an internal examination before the Chazzan says \"Barchu\" (at the evening service which the local community said while it was still daytime), but then during the course of her days of counting she saw some blood (and had to start her count over with a new internal examination) in that situation she would be able to do an internal examination even after the Chazzan says \"Barchu\" (at the evening service which the local community said while it was still daytime) if this blood was seen close to the onset of nighttime. This practice is not considered ideal, but one should not protest women who behave this way as they have received this ruling from a sage who ruled this way for them, and it is an old custom.]",

Even if she only washes her genital area, that is enough. This is the way our communities act and one should not depart from this practice; however, in a dire situation, such as a woman who is going on a trip and doesn't have (white) clothing, she is still able to begin counting her seven blood-free days.

If she finds it very difficult to insert the cloth to such a depth, at the very least she should do so for the internal examination of the day on which she sees her bleeding stop and the internal examination on the first day of her seven blood-free days.

And this is specifically referring to a stain which is larger than the size of a \"gris and more\", but a stain which is smaller than this size can be blamed on a louse even within the first three days. This is also true if she has a wound on her body which she knows is actively bleeding, in this case she would be able to blame a stain which is larger than a \"gris and more\" on this wound.

Containing 75 sections: The woman does not rise up from her impure status through washing in a bathhouse, and even if all the waters in the world passed over her, she is still in her impurity, and those (who have sex with her) are deserving of spiritual excision, until she immerses her whole body at once in the waters of a mikveh or spring which has the volume of 40 se'ah, with a size of one amah by one amah and a height of three amot square, where an amah equals six tefachim and half an etzbah. And if it is wider but not as tall, that is valid, as long as she is able to get her whole body covered by them (the water) at once. And the geometric values must add up to 44,118 and a half etzba'ot in size. And the container where the water is located must be larger than this size, so that the immersee can enter and and when the water is displaced, 40 se'ah will still remain. ",
            "Spring water purifies even when it is flowing. Rain water only purifies when in a still body, but when it is flowing, it is Biblically invalid, if it is detached from a spring. If the flowing water from a spring mixed with downflow which derives from rain, then the whole mixture has the status of the spring for all purposes. But if the downflow is greater than the spring flow, or similarly if rain water makes up the majority of the water in a river, they do not purify while flowing but only while still. Therefore one must set up a barrier or something like it in the mixed river, until the water gathers together and one can immerse in it. [Comment of Rema: And thus it is correct to teach and to be stringent. But some permit immersion in rivers all year round, even during rain and snowmelt season, when the downflow is greater than the spring flow, because the essence of the river's size is from its source location. This is the practice in most places where there is no mikveh, and we should not reprimand those who have the custom to be lenient, because they have authorities to rely on. However, one must be careful not to immerse in a river that appears entirely through rain, and when there is no rain it stops completely. Even if other rivers pour into it during the rainy season and it appears through them, in any case, since it stops entirely during the season when there is no rain, it is forbidden to immerse in it while it is flowing, until the waters are gathered together. But a river that does not stop, even even if during the rain it swells and and expands over its banks, it is permissible to immerse in it in any case, according to the lenient opinions and the common practice.]",

If we observed a partly empty mikveh, and then came and found it full, and we do not know who filled it- if it was already mostly valid, meaning that 21 se'in were present (of the necessary 40) we proceed leniently. And if the majority was not valid, then now we have a Biblical-level doubt: whether we should suspect that the idolater filled it up for bathing, and it is invalid, or whether rather an Israelite filled it up for immersion in it, and it is valid. Since most of the people who are around a mivkeh and work to make it valid are experts, certainly they have filled it properly. And even more so, if the Israelite is before us and says that they filled it properly, they are trustworthy, given that they have the ability to fix it.

But any time that the mikveh does not (yet) contain 40 se'ah, even if it is only missing a small amount, if 3 lugin of drawn water fall inside, they have invalidated it, and it makes no difference if they were drawn in a container or squeezed from one's garment and held up so the water in it would fall from many locations. Likewise if one pours from the jug and drips from many locations into it, or if one threw them with the palms, and even if they fell in from two or three containers, a bit from one and a bit from the other, they combine (to comprise a volume of 3 lugin).

And we do not need to worry that perhaps the force of the moisture has made hollows in them and they are containing, because even if there is a hollow in them, it is not considered a container, since it was not made intentionally by anyone. And if the waters come into the pipe by way of containers that are fixed on a wheel, which are punctured in a way that makes them not considered containers, it is permissible to immerse in them if the mikveh contains 40 se'ah.

In which cases is this said? When they flow down their legs. But if one was riding on the back of an animal and the waters flowed down the animal's legs, they have not invalidated it, even though they flowed from the animal that one is riding on, this is not considered the same as flowing down one's own legs. (It has been explained already that some disagree with this, see above Section 15.)",
            "A container that has a puncture in its base, even a very small one, is not considered a container enough to invalidate the mikveh. But in any case, one should not be lenient and in an ideal case make the mikveh with water brought in punctured containers like this. And if the puncture is on the sides, it does not nullify the status of a container until the puncture has a width of the tube of a waterskin, which is approximately the width of the first two fingers from the parallel portion of the hand, folded over, within the opening of the puncture, whether it is square or round. And it must be close to its base so that it cannot hold any water from there downward, but if it can hold any water below it, its status as a container has not been nullified. And if one mixed plaster with clumps of mud and sealed the puncture with them, it is not considered sealed enough to return it to the status of a container. Or if one set it on the ground or even on plaster or gypsum, it is not considered sealed. However, if one mixed plaster and gypsum and sealed it, it is considered sealed. Therefore, if one wants to draw water from the mikveh to clean it, but fears dripping 3 lugin back from the container used to remove the water into the mikveh after less than 40 se'ah remain and invalidating it, one should puncture the utensil in its base a little bit, so then the waters within it will not be considered drawn. But if the waters are flowing, there is no need for this, as a spring is not invalidated by drawing. [Comment of Rema: But in any case, they have customarily been strict even about a spring, because some disagree even about a spring and say that drawing does invalidate it, and therefore, ideally, we should be stringent and puncture the container that we are drawing water with, even in a spring. And if they did not do this and drew the water with a complete container, and 3 lugin of drawn waters fell in and the mikveh was invalidated and they now want to clean it and make it valid, if the dripping punctures can be easily stopped up, it is best to be stringent and to do so, but if this is a very difficult task or after the fact if they did not do it, we should rely on the lenient opinions, who think that drawing water does not invalidate a spring, because this is the basic rule. And even in a mikveh that does not have a spring, if the container is not so large that it will certainly drip 3 lugin of drawn waters, but we might suspect that the drips are sequential etc., we follow the lenient opinion because a doubt about the 3 lugin of drawn water is a doubt about a Rabbinic-level rule, and we do not need to be suspicious after the fact.]",

Because drawn water that has been made to flow is valid if most of 40 se'ah of valid (water) was already present. Similarly, if a roof had 20 se'ah plus a small amount of rain waters, and one filled it manually and added less than the 20 that were present - the whole thing is invalid - and then opened the pipe and the waters all flowed to one place, this is a valid mikveh. Because drawn water that has been made to flow is entirely valid, therefore a majority of the water present is valid. [Comment of Rema: But if one first made the invalid waters flow, and then after brought to them the majority of valid water, this was not effective.]",
            "The length of this flowing portion must be no less than three hand-widths.",
            "Causing the flow does not work unless it is over the earth or a pipe that does not have a separate container. But if one made it flow over containers, even containers made of dung etc. this does not constitute flowing. [Comment of Rema: And some say that making it flow only works specifically on the earth, which is able to absorb it, but if one made if flow over stone flooring which is not absorbent, and even more so over a board or container, even one that does not invalidate a mikveh, this does not work. And ideally it is good to be stringent.]",
            "A mikveh that flows that dried out in the summer, and the cistern was somewhat far from it, and one filled it (the cistern) with drawn water and the mikveh filled up from under the ground with those same drawn waters, the mikveh is just as valid as if it was flowing. ",
            "One trying to cause waters to flow to the mikveh must not use an item that can contract impurity. So for example, if one wants to make rain waters flow to another place to make a mikveh, they must not grab a board by hand and pass them over it. Instead, they should place the board on the earth and take their hand off of it before the waters pass over it. And similarly, it is forbidden to cause the waters to flow through a metal pipe into the mikveh, because it can contract impurity. This is when the waters fall directly from the item that can contract impurity into the mikveh. But if they fall on its (the mikveh's) edge, outside, and flow into it, or if one connects a small tube of wood or pottery to the lead pipe, through which the water cascades into the mikveh, this is valid. And if the metal pipe is connected to the earth, even if it cascades directly into the mikveh, it is valid, because it cannot contract impurity, because it is rendered insignificant by the earth. [And it does not make a difference whether it is buried under the ground or not.]",
            "In what cases was this said? When one causes regular rain water to flow. But if one is causing it to flow from a spring or a mikveh, even using something that can contract impurity, it is valid. Because we consider this mikveh that is receiving the flow as if it were connected to that spring or to that mikveh that is originating the flow of waters. And some do not differentiate between these. ",
            "A rain water mikveh that had one of its walls break, and the waters are exiting through the crack- if 40 se'ah are left after the portion next to the crack exit, it is valid, but if not, it is invalid. Because it has become flowing, and a mikveh does not purify while flowing. [Comment of Rema: And some are stringent, even if 40 se'ah will remain until the crack is reached, and ideally one should be sensitive to their concerns, and seal the cracks. And all this is specifically in a mikveh that does not come from a spring, but if it comes from a spring, one does not need to worry about its flow. And waters' exit is not considered 'flowing' unless they do not return to the mikveh. But if they go out a little and come back there, it is not considered flowing.] And if one tries to seal the crack so that 40 se'ah will remain, they must not seal it manually, or with anything that can contract impurity. And some permit sealing with any item that can contract impurity. ",
            "If the mikveh is punctured and its waters drip little by little, or are absorbed into the earth little by little, it is valid, because their flow is not identifiable.",
            "One trying to mix an invalid or too-small mikveh with a valid mikveh to make it valid, or when both are too small and one is trying to mix them to make them valid- the opening between them must be as wide as the tube of a waterskin (and the stream of water must be as wide as the opening) and after the invalid has been mixed with the valid, even for a moment, it remains valid forever, even if the puncture is later sealed up. Anything located near the waterskin-tube-width can reduce its size, even materials originating from the water. If it is doubtful whether the opening is as wide as the tube of a waterskin or not, it is invalid. If it has many small punctures, they combine to add up to the width of a waterskin tube, if the one mikveh is complete and the second is too small. [Comment of Rema: And it is permissible to dig a mikveh next to a river and to immerse in it, even if there are not 40 se'ah, since the soil is continuously percolating, and since it is close to the river and we can observe the percolation between them, in which the waters come from the river by way of percolation, meaning, through tiny openings in the earth, this is considered a connection.] But if both are too small, the small punctures do not add up to the width of a waterskin tube. (And the rule is the same if a part of the mikveh is in a basket or bag, if neither side has enough volume, it is invalid.)",
            "One trying to validate a mikveh of drawn water with a full, non-drawn mikveh- even if one only connects them by a hair's breadth, it is valid. And even if the waters at that connection do not contact the surface. [Comment of Rema: This is specifically relating to the invalidation of drawing water, which is Rabbinic-level. But a Biblical-level invalidation requires the width of the tube of a waterskin, as was explained. Even the invalidation of drawn water is disputed, and it is proper to teach it this way.]",
            "A wall between two mikvaot that has cracked from one side to the other, even a very small amount, if it is in \"warp thread\" direction, they combine to mix the two mikvaot and make them valid. But if it is in the \"weft thread\" direction, they do not combine until one area has the diameter of the tube of a waterskin. And if the wall was split at the top between one and the other, with a height of a garlic peel and width of the tube of a waterskin, it is valid. [Comment of Rema:  And it would be the same rule if there was a pile of dirt between the two mikvaot- if one removed a little from the height of the pile until they flow into each other with a width of the tube of a waterskin and the height of a garlic peel, this is enough, since we only require the full diameter of the tube of a wineskin for a puncture.]",
            "Three mikvaot, where two of them have twenty se'ah each of valid waters and one has twenty se'ah of drawn waters, and they are standing side by side, and three people descend and immerse in them, and through this, they fill up and overflow and mix together- all three of them become valid, since at one point 40 se'ah of valid water were connected together, and those people who immersed in them are purified. But if the drawn water was in the middle, so the two valid ones could only mix through it, they have not become valid, but rather remain as they were originally, and those people who immersed in them have not been purified.

[Comment of Rema: And therefore, for a utensil placed on the edge of the mikveh, one may splash their hand in the mikveh to make a wave in the water, which will pass over the utensil, and the immersion has counted for it. However, one must not disconnect the wave from its place, and it must rather be attached to the mikveh.] ",

But if it cannot support itself, even if they are only mixed a tiny amount, one may immerse in them. ",
            "Three pits along a riverbed, where the bottom and top are of 20 se'ah, and the middle is of 40, and a flood of rainwater passes through the riverbed- even though it enters and exits them, this is not considered mixing, and one may only immerse in the middle one, as flowing waters do not mix unless they stand still.

            "A mikveh that contains 40 se'ah exactly- a person who immerses in it must not jump in, so as not to reduce the water by their jumping in, and must not immerse twice in a row. If two people immersed one after the other, even if the feet of the first are still touching the water, the second remains in their impurity, as the water has been reduced from 40 se'ah. ",
            "If one immerses a thick fabric that absorbs water- the whole time that the fabric is touching the mikveh, it is valid, even if three lugin have flowed back into the mikveh. If one removes it (the wet fabric) from it (the mikveh), it is invalid, as it has been made \"drawn\" by the waters that flow from the fabric into it. And if one immerses a kettle or other utensils, they should lower it into it by the mouth, so that the waters will not splash when they enter it, making it (the mikveh's volume) reduced, and they should raise it out by the sides, so that the water will not stay in it and be missing from the mikveh. [Comment of Rema: All the water that is in the utensil. Also the water in the utensil becomes drawn, and if it falls after this into the mikveh, it can invalidate it, since there is no longer the necessary volume for a mikveh.]",

But if it is not known that the water volume grows smaller to that degree that it will ultimately have less than 40 se'ah, even if its waters sometimes rise and sometimes fall, they do not need to return and immerse.

But if one did this with utensils, it is invalid. [Comment of Rema: And even if one could cover themselves with water- if the water is not one fingerspan higher than the immersee's navel, ideally one should not immerse in it, in case they do not immerse nicely. However, if there is no other mikveh, and it is not possible to fix it, even if one needs to lie down flat on their face because the waters are not deep enough- if they can cover their whole body in this way at once, they may immerse there.]",

            "A mikveh that was empty when one left it, but one has arrived and found it full- this is valid, because this case is doubtfully drawn water in a mikveh. (And see above, at the beginning of this section what I wrote about this.)",

And one who make all of one's dough challah has done nothing until one leaves over some. And from the words of the Sages, we separate 1/24 of the dough, and a baker who makes [it] to sell in the market separates 1/48. And if the dough becomes ritually impure by accident or compulsion [i.e. forces out of one's control], even the householder separates 1/48. ",
            "We are not obligated in challah from the Torah other than in the land of Israel alone, as it is said: \"and it shall be that when you eat from the bread of the land...\" (Num. 15:19). And [it applies] at a time that all of Israel is there, as it is said: \"when you [plural] come\" (Num. 15:18) - the coming of all of you and the coming of some of you. Therefore, [the obligation of ] challah at this time - even in the days of Ezra in the land of Israel - is only from their [i.e. the Sages'] words [i.e. it is of Rabbinic force only].",

All of the land [of Israel] that those who came up from Babylonia held - up to Keziv - separate in it one challah according to its [specified] amount, and it is eaten by priests. And the rest of the land of Israel that those who came up from Egypt, but not those who came up from Babylonia held - from Keziv to Amana - separate in it two challot. The first is 1/48 and it is burnt, and the second has no [specified] amount, and they give it to the priest to eat it. And all the land from Amana onward, whether in Syria or in the rest of the [foreign] lands separate two challot. The first has no [specified] amount, and it is burnt, and the second, 1/48, and is eaten. And it is permitted to those who are ritually impure, even to zavim and zavot [males and females ritually impure due to abnormal genital emissions]. And in this time, when there is no ritually pure dough because of the ritual impurity of the dead body [a status which all are considered to have], they separate one challah in all of the land of Israel, 1/48, and burn it because it is ritually impure. And from Keziv to Amana, they separate a second for the priest for eating, and it does not have a [specified] amount, as was the case in previous times.",
            "Challah of the Diaspora [in our day], even though it is ritually impure, since its essence is an obligation from their [the Sages'] words, it is not forbidden for eating other than  for those [priests] whose ritual impurity goes out upon one from one's body, namely those who have emitted semen, zavim and zavot (males and females ritually impure due to abnormal genital emissions], menstruants, and those who have given birth. But the rest of those who are ritually impure through touching what is ritually impure, and even those who are ritually impure, are permitted for eating it. Therefore, whether in Syria or whether in the Diaspora, if one wanted to separate [only] one challah, one separates 1/48 and it is eaten by a male minor [priest] who still has not seen a seminal emission or a female minor [daughter of a priest] who has not yet menstruated, and there is no need to separate a second [challah]. And it is [also] so if there was an adult priest there who immersed [in a mikveh] from his emission of semen or from his zivah (abnormal genital emission), even though the sun has not set on him (and there are some who say that the sun needs to set - the Ran on Eilu Ov'rin), behold this one is permitted to eat the first challah, and there is no need to separate a second in the Diaspora. Gloss: And there are some who say that since there is no challah eaten in this time in the land of Israel, also [it should be so] in the rest of the places. There is no need to separate [other than] only one challah and to burn it (Tur in the name  of \"there are those who say\" and other decisors). And such is the basic practice in all these lands, that they do not separate [other than] only one challah that has no [specified] amount, and they burn it like they used to do when they separated two challot, in that the challah of the fire did not have a [specified] amount. And in any case, the practice to take an olive-size (Maharil). And the one [i.e. priest] who eats challah, even in the Diaspora, blesses first according to the type [of food] that one wants to eat, and after than blesses \"who makes us holy with the holiness of Aaron and commands us to eat terumah [a contribution]\". And there are those who say that when they burn challah, they make an inference because of it that an Israelite [i.e. non-priest] is forbidden to derive benefit from it (Maharik, and so also in Tosafot \"Kol Sha-ah\"), and they practice to throw it into the oven before they bake the bread."

            "One whose relative died, but he did not know, it is not required to tell him.  eEven if it was a parent who died.  And on this it was said: \"One who spreads a rumor is a fool\" (Prov 10:18), and it is permitted to invite him to a meal for a wedding or any festivity, since he does not know.  However, if he asks, one shouldn't lie and say 'He is alive', as it says  \"Keep far away from falsehood.\" (Ex 23:7) GLOSS: With males, it is customary to tell them, so that they will say kaddish, but with daughters there is no custom to tell them.  It is a mitzva to fast on the anniversary of a parent's death, and one fasts on the date of death, not the date of burial, unless one was present for both death and burial.  If this falls on a day tachanun is not said, one does not fast at all.  If the person died in Adar, one fasts in the first Adar in leap years, and although there are those who dispute this, this is primary. If the person died in the second Adar in a leap year, one fasts in the second Adar in leap years.  See Orach Chaim 568:7, and above 391, that one should not eat at a (festive) meal on the night of the anniversary of the death of a parent.  If this fast falls on Friday, its rule is like other fasts, and see Orach Chaim 249.  But if the person finished his fast the first time this occurred, he should do likewise in all future occurrences.    "
