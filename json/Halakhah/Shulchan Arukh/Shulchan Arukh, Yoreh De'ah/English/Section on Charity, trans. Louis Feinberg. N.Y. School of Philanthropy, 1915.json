But if the donor's name is associated with the gift, it cannot be commuted for a non-religious purpose, but it may, for a religious purpose. If the donor is a heathen, the gift cannot be commuted even for some other religious purpose, as long as his name is associated with the gift.

            "If a heathen donates a candelabrum or other object to the synagogue, we accept it, if he says, \"I have consecrated this according to the intentions of the Israelites\"; but if he does not say this, it must be put away.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For we fear he might have consecrated it for idol-worship.</i> (See Art. 254.)",

For the burden of proof rests with the Charity officials who are interested in changing the present status of the property; and as long as they cannot bring proof, the property in question continues in the possession of the heirs.</small>",
            "The community has no right to assess or tax charity funds.<br><small>RMI.—If one finds a purse in his chest with the word \"charity\" written over it, we depend upon the written word and it is Charity. So, too, if one said to his children, \"This is Charity,\" and it seems to them now that he said this to inform them of a fact, the money is Charity. But if it seems to them that he told them this so that they should not take any, or so that they should not consider him wealthy, then we put no stock in his words. So also, if one is informed in a dream that his father concealed money in a certain place<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And it is actually found in the place designated.</i> and that the money is Charity, we put no trust in these words, because the words of dreams are of no account either one way or the other. If one handles a box of charity funds and one of other funds, and money is later found on the floor, we say it belongs to the chest he used last. If he used both simultaneously, we say it belongs to the larger sum. But if he finds it in a crevice or hole, where, we might say, it has been lying for a long time without being noticed, then we give it to the larger fund even if he handled them successively. </small>"
