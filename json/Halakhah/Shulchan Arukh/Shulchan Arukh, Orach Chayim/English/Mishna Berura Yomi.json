After- wards he may recite the berachos in the other houses and they will drink the cup of kiddush and magid and eat the vegetables and matzah and he will not eat with them. He may then leave them to finish their meal and they will recite birkas hamazon for themselves and if they do not know how they should repeat each word after him. He may then go to another house and repeat this procedure. Afterwards he may return home, recite hallel and drink the fourth cup. If he wants to visit the other homes first, he should recite the berachos without eating or drinking and then return to his house to recite kiddush. He may also complete the seder at home and then go to the other houses to recite kiddush without eating or drinking with them."

One may not use an ax, sickle, or a saw; rather one should use a chopper (A butcher’s knife and some make it with two heads resembling an ax) but one should use the narrow head rather than the wide head. Some prohibit even the use of a chopper since we are not experts to identify what is a chopper and only permit the use of a knife."
