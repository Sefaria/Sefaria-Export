            "<b>“The order of the Eve</b><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">All Jewish days, holidays, and festivals begin and conclude at sundown. The “Eve” of a holiday is considered any day which precedes the sundown marking the beginning of that holiday.</i> <b>of Yom Kippur</b><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yom Kippur, or the Day of Atonement, falls on the tenth day of what, during our time, is the first month of the Hebrew calendar, the month of <i>Tishrei</i>. During the biblical period it was referred to as the seventh month. Yom Kippur follows by ten days the actual Jewish New Year, or Rosh HaShanah, which falls on the first day of the month of <i>Tishrei</i>. Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur are called the Days of Awe, <i>Yamim ha-Noraim</i>, because of their demand upon a religious Jew for special piety and self-reflection during this period of time devoted to repentance and self-improvement. These days which usually occur in the Fall of the year (September-October) and are referred to as the High Holydays. Yom Kippur is considered the most sacred day of the entire Jewish year and its commemoration involves a special, unique set of laws which are enumerated in the body of this thesis. For the biblical ordination of this holiday see: Leviticus 16 (all, but especially 16:29-34) and Numbers 29:7-11.</i> <b>(the Day of Atonement)” - Containing two paragraphs.</b><br>It is a commandment to eat on the Eve of Yom Kippur and to increase (one’s eating) at the meal.<br><i>Hagah</i>:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hagah, <span dir=\"rtl\">הגה</span>, introduces the notes added to the text of Joseph Caro by Rabbi Moses b. Israel Isserles. Isserles is also known as “the Rema”, an acronym for <i>R</i>abbi <i>M</i>oses <i>I</i>sserles. He was a Polish rabbi, codifier and halakhic authority, who lived from 1525 or 1530 until 1572. He was born in Cracow under the name of Isserel-Lazarus which was later shortened to Isserles. He studied in Lublin at the yeshivah of Sholom Shachna. Isserles obtained such a fine reputation that he became known as the “Maimonides of Polish Jewry”. Isserles was in the middle of writing a code himself following the pattern of the four <i>Turim</i> by Jacob b. Asher which he called <i>Darkhei Moshe</i> which was to assemble the halakhic material of his time in a short, synoptic form so that a <i>dayyan</i>, a decision maker, could more easily find the material he needed to formulate a ruling on a particular issue. In the middle of his writing of the <i>Darkhei Moshe</i> he received a copy of the <i>Beit Yosef</i> of Joseph Caro which in essence had already accomplished this goal. But Isserles decided to complete his work operating a bit differently than did Caro. Isserles did not always agree with Caro’s selection of the “three pillars of halakhic decisions”, Alfasi, Maimonides, and Asher b. Jehiel to decide issues. He followed the principle which stated that laws should be decided according to later scholars. He also often agreed with Asher b. Jehiel and his son Jacob b. Asher even when they were in the minority, unlike Caro. Also Isserles realized that Caro ignored in his work Ashkenazi practices that were very much a part of his Polish and European community but were not included in Caro’s work in the world of Sephardi Jewry.<br>Isserles wrote other halakhic works, such as <i>Torat Ḥattat</i> which focused on mainly Jewish dietary laws. Finally Isserles received the Shulḥan Arukh by Joseph Caro. Like the earlier and more extensive <i>Beit Yosef</i>, it lacked many halakhic contributions and customs, <i>minhagim</i>, of Ashkenazi Jewry and was therefore not an adequate code for this segment of the Jewish world. Isserles decided to add notes (<i>hagah</i> or <i>hagahot</i>) to the body of the Shulḥan Arukh which has also been referred to as the “<i>mappah</i>” or “tablecloth” over the “Shulḥan Arukh” or “prepared table”. In his glosses, Isserles added his conclusions which he drew in his work <i>Darkhei Moshe</i> to the Shulḥan Arukh. In many cases he disagreed with Caro and he stated his disagreement, or he would cite an Ashkenazi custom not found in Caro’s work. He maintained the brief style employed by Caro, and he provided the existence of differing points of view by later scholars and Ashkenazi Jews which he felt were needed for a <i>dayyan</i> to be able to arrive at a correct decision. He often modified the views of the <i>meḥabber</i>, the author, as he referred to Caro, he explained, contradicted, added to and refined the structure.<br>Isserles put much emphasis on the custom, the <i>minhag</i>. He often gave it the same force as the <i>halakhah</i>. If there was no halakhah in existence, or in some cases where a <i>minhag</i> and a <i>halakhah</i> conflicted with each other, he decided according to the <i>minhag</i>, the custom which the people actually followed in their daily lives. If Isserles disagreed with a particular custom he would state so and he would urge against following such a custom.<br>Isserles was very lenient in cases of stress or in cases which would involve considerable financial loss. His leniency, which was seldom found in the works of others, was the subject of criticism by many of his contemporaries particularly Ḥayyim b. Bezalel who studied with him under Sholom Shachnan in Lublin. Even in view of the extensive criticism Isserles received, his notes to the Shulḥan Arukh became accepted and his rulings and customs were binding on Ashkenazi Jewry. The <i>mappah</i> of Isserles made the Shulḥan Arukh of Caro acceptable to Ashkenazi Jews and the authoritative code that it remains to this day.<br>The Shulḥan Arukh which was first published in Venice in 1565, was first published with the <i>mappah</i> of Isserles in Cracow in 1569-71 and it has been a part of the accepted text ever since.<br>Louis Ginzberg in Menachem Elon, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., “Codification of Law” v. 5. pp. 628-56;<br>Simḥa Katz, “Isserles, Moses ben Israel”, v. 9, pp.1081-85.</i> It is forbidden to fast on it (the Eve of Yom Kippur), even a dream fast<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A fast was recommended to be observed as the result of an ominous dream (or a nightmare), <i>ta’anit ḥalom</i>, <span dir=\"rtl\">תענית חלום</span>, to avert the evil consequences dreamt. In talmudic times and later it was believed that bad dreams could have pernicious effects. The fast was regarded of such urgency that the rabbis permitted it even on the Sabbath, but one was to fast on a weekday as well, as a repentance for having dishonored the Sabbath Joy through fasting. A fast as the result of a bad dream, though, is not to be observed on Yom Kippur Eve.<br>Editorial Staff, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 6, p. 1196<br>(What amends shall he make (for having fasted on the Sabbath)? - He should observe an additional fast.)<br>B.

His real name was Jacob ben Moses Moellin. He lived from around 1360 until 1427. He was born in Mainz and became the foremost talmudist of his generation and the head of the Jewish communities of Germany, Austria, and Bohemia. He studied under his father and later went to Austria where he was ordained after studying under Meir ha-Levi and Sholom b. Isaac. After the death of his father, Maharil established a yeshivah from which came the greatest rabbis of Germany and Austria.<br>Moellin was famous and halakhic questions were asked of him throughout Europe. Many of his rulings became the foundation of the Jewish way of life for German Jewry. His decisions were characterized by the fact that he took into account the conditions of the time including the economic situation of a particular community. He would often decide to be strict in a case where a community had no rabbinic leadership. Moellin was concerned about leaders who did not possess the proper authority and the neglect of proper Torah and talmudic study that resulted from decisions arrived at using codified halakhic works instead of thorough original investigation. He placed a great deal of importance on charity and the honor of the poor.<br>Moellin was an accomplished <i>ḥazzan</i> and fought for the preservation of traditional melodies for the liturgy. His known works were two, <i>Minhagei Maharil</i>, (<i>Sefer Maharil</i>), which was first published in Sabionetta in 1556 and compiled by his student Zalman of Saint Goar, was a collection of halakhic statements, customs, and explanations which Zalman had heard from Moellin. It was these customs of Germany that Moses Isserles used so often in his glosses to the Shulḥan Arukh. The second work was a collection of responsa arranged by Eleazar b. Jacob and published in Venice in 1549.<br>Ephraim Kupfer, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 12, pp. 210-11.</i> And if one vows to fast on it, see above (in the Shulḥan Arukh, <i>Oraḥ Ḥayyim</i>), chapter  570, paragraph 2.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Oraḥ Ḥayyim</i> chapter 570, Paragraph 2: “One who vows to fast on the Sabbath, on a festival, or on the Eve of Yom Kippur or on Ḥanukkah or Purim, the laws are the same as for one who vows to fast on so and so many days and these (holy) days happen to occur on them. If he expressed it using the word “vow”, the law is as if one has taken them upon himself, with the expression, a vow (it has the legal character of a vow). But if he expressed it merely with the (ordinary) expression of accepting a fast then the law is as if one has taken upon himself (the fast) with the expression of accepting a fast”. That is if one “vows” to fast on the Eve of Yom Kippur then he must if he uses the words “vow” and “fast”. If he only says I am going to fast, without using the word “vow”, it is not serious and he can postpone it. (Acceptance of a fast by a) vow is more serious than accepting a fast without it.”</i>",

It is normally part of the daily Morning, <i>Shaḥarit</i> (see footnote 17), and Afternoon, <i>Minḥah</i> (see footnote 40), Services. It is recited after the reader’s repetition of the <i>Amidah</i> (see footnote 43). The <i>taḥanun</i> begins silently with a selection from II Samuel 24:14 which was uttered by King David after he was rebuked by the prophet Gad for sinning by numbering the people: “let us fall, I pray thee, into the hand of the Lord, for his mercies are many, but let me not fall into the hands of man.” The prayer is referred to literally as the “prostration prayer” because the Bible mentions the fact that one prostrates oneself during petitions (Deuteronomy 9:18; Joshua 7:6), and the prayer <i>taḥanun</i> was therefore customarily recited in the prostrate position. Today the prayer is recited while one is seated with one’s head bowed into the bend of one’s arm when a Torah Scroll is present to indicate the sanctity of the location. The Sephardi ritual begins the <i>taḥanun</i> with a silent confession of sins, <i>viddui</i> (see footnote 39) followed by the verse from II Samuel 24:14. The central part of the prayer for the Ashkenazim is Psalm 6 and for the Sephardim the penitential psalm, Psalm 25. In addition to this there are penitential prayers of <i>piyyutim</i>, or liturgical poems (see footnote 149). The <i>taḥanun</i> prayer is omitted on the Sabbath, festivals, semiholidays, New Moons, and from the <i>Minḥah</i> Service preceding these special days, during the month of <i>Nisan</i> and on the Ninth of <i>Av</i>. The <i>taḥanun</i> is also omitted at a circumcision in a synagogue, when a bridegroom attends the service during the first seven days following his wedding, and at the prayers held at the homes of mourners since the theme “I have sinned before thee” is deemed inappropriate.<br>Meir Ydit, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 15, p. 702.</i> prayers) on the Eve of Yom Kippur.<br><i>Hagah</i>: They also do not say “<span dir=\"ltr\">למנצח</span><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"ltr\">למנצח</span>, “For the Chief Musician, a Psalm of David” is Psalm 19, and it is recited normally during the <i>Shaḥarit</i>, Morning prayers on the Sabbath and festivals (see footnote 17).

Additions such as these gave Ashkenazi Jewry the possibility of accepting the Shulḥan Arukh as a binding and authoritative code of Jewish law in that the additions of Isserles enabled the total Shulḥan Arukh to be a work common to all of world Jewry. There was no one book from which Isserles drew his <i>minhagim</i>, his customs, but rather he drew them from various <i>minhagim</i> books available to him and from customs he was familiar with in daily life. Many of the <i>minhagim</i> from which Isserles drew were contained in a book entitled <i>Minahage Maharil</i> or <i>Sefer Maharil</i> published in 1556 in Sabionetta which was compiled by Zalman of Saint Goar. It contained halakhic statements, explanations, and customs that Zalman heard from his great teacher the Maharil, Jacob ben Moses Moellin (see footnote 8).</i> Also they do not say before dawn many “<i>seliḥot</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Seliḥot</i>, <span dir=\"ltr\">סליחות</span>, means “prayers of forgiveness”.

When the term is used in the plural, <i>seliḥot</i>, it refers to a special order of service which consists of non-statuatory additional prayers which are recited on all fast days, on occasions of special intercession, and during the Penitential season which begins with a special <i>Seliḥot</i> Service usually held at midnight on the Saturday night immediately preceding Rosh HaShanah and concludes with Yom Kippur. The Mishna (Ta’an 2:1-4) gives the order of the service for public fasts which were often proclaimed during periods of drought and it provided for six additional blessings inserted into the daily <i>Amidah</i> after the sixth blessing which is a prayer for forgiveness of sins (see footnote 43).<br>The first mention of any kind of definite order of <i>Seliḥot</i> is found in <i>Tanna de-Vei</i>, Eliyahu Zuta (23 end). The order of <i>Sheliḥot</i> was not found until the ninth century in the <i>Seder</i> of R. Amram which included “May He Who answered” and the biblical verse “Thee Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious longsuffering and abundent in goodness and truth” (Exodus 34:6) along with others.<br>Over the centuries many more <i>piyyutim</i> with the theme of forgiveness have been added to the <i>Seliḥot</i> prayers. Because of the many liturgical poems added at various times, many Jewish communities have had their own distinct rites evolve. It became a Palestinian custom not to say the <i>Seliḥot</i> prayers during the <i>Amidah</i> but after it, and this became the custom generally accepted (Shulḥan Arukh, <i>Oraḥ Ḥayyim</i>, 566:4).<br><i>Seliḥot</i> prayers were originally confined to fast days. God was just, and it was felt that if one confessed one’s sins and prayed for forgiveness, calamities which were the result of Israel’s sins, would be averted. In modern times the <i>Seliḥot</i> prayers were first recited in conjunction with the six fast days prior to Rosh HaShanah and then they were extended to include the ten days of Penitence including Yom Kippur but not Rosh HaShanah in the Ashkenazi ritual. Among Sephardi Jews it was a custom to recite <i>Seliḥot</i> for forty days from Rosh Ḥodesh Elul (the New Moon of the month of Elul, the last month of the Hebrew year preceding the New Year beginning with Rosh HaShanah on the New Moon of Tishrei) until Yom Kippur. The Ashkenazi custom was evolved in our day to recite <i>Seliḥot</i> from midnight on the Saturday night prior to Rosh HaShanah or the week before that should Rosh HaShanah fall on a Monday or a Tuesday. (Shulḥan Arukh, <i>Oraḥ Ḥayyim</i>, 581 with the Isserles). Only on the first night is <i>Seliḥot</i> recited at midnight. On all other days it is recited in the Morning Service.<br>Present day customs also allow individuals to recite <i>Seliḥot</i> on semi-official voluntary fasts.<br>Louis Isaac Rabinowitz, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 14, pp. 1133-34.</i>” (prayers of forgiveness), but there are places where it is customary to increase <i>seliḥot</i>. All (this should be done) according to the (local) custom.

The prayer is not said during Friday <i>Minḥah</i> Afternoon, on the Sabbath, or on the day before Yom Kippur. If the day before Yom Kippur is a Friday then the prayer is recited during the Morning, <i>Shaḥarit</i> Service (see footnote 17). Each of the forty-four invocations of the prayer begins “<i>Avinu Malkhenu</i>”, “Our Father our King”. This litancy has the elements of a confessional and petitionary prayer. The prayer is quite old and the Talmud attributes some of the lines to Rabbi Akiba when they were spoken on a fast day due to a drought. The prayer was expanded over the centuries to include prayers for life, pardon, and the needs and trials of human existence. Toward the end are references to the terrible massacres during the Black Death in the fourteenth century where much of German Jewry was annihilated.<br>Hertz, <i>op</i>. <i>cit</i>., pp. 161-67.</i>”, (Our Father, our King”), on the Eve of Yom Kippur, there is a disagreement among the <i>aḥronim</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Aḥronim</i>, <span dir=\"ltr\">אחרונים</span>, the later scholars or authorities. This term is used to designate the later rabbinic authorities as opposed to the <i>rishonim</i> or the earlier authorities. There is no clear line of demarkation separating the <i>aḥronim</i> from the <i>rishonim</i>. Some scholars date the <i>aḥronim</i> as early as the tosafists in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries while others start the period in the beginning of the fourteenth century where the appearance of the <i>Sha’arei Dura</i> of Isaac ben Meir Dueren. Most scholars agree that the period of the <i>rishonim</i> ends with the death of Israel Isserlein in 1460 (see footnote 96) and that the <i>aḥronim</i> begin with the Shulḥan Arukh including the glosses of Isserles (1525-30-1572). The later authorities are therefore thought of as the collection of all the predecessors of the Jewish world of sages in both the Sephardi and Ashkenazi communities included by both Caro and Isserles. When Isserles then referred to the <i>aḥronim</i>, he referred to his contemporaries and those authorities immediately preceding him.<br>Some of the greatest <i>aḥronim</i> were produced in Poland during the end of the sixteenth century where the study of the Torah and Talmud became quite intensive.<br><i>Aḥronim</i> is a term now used to refer to all rabbinic authorities after 1500 who decide <i>halakhah</i> even to this day.<br>Yehoshua Horowitz, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 1973 Year Book, pp.153-57.</i>, (later scholars). The custom in my city is not to say it unless Yom Kippur falls on Shabbat; since we do not say on the Shabbat “<span dir=\"rtl\">אבינו מלכנו</span>”, therefore we say it in the <i>Shaḥarit</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shaḥarit</i>, <span dir=\"ltr\">שחרית</span> Morning Service, or actually the dawn prayer. The <i>Shaḥarit</i> prayers are the most elaborate of the three daily prayer services (the Shaḥarit, Morning; <i>Minḥah</i>, Afternoon; and <i>Aravit</i>, Evening). It has been traditionally attributed to Abraham. “And Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord,” (Genesis 19:27). After the destruction of the Temple the rabbis made the recitation of the <i>Shaḥarit</i> prayer obligatory to replace the daily morning sacrafice called the <i>Tamid</i> which had been performed in the Temple (Ber. 26b).<br>There are basically eight parts to the <i>Shaḥarit</i> Service and they are the following: (1) The Morning Benedictions or <i>Birkhot ha-Shaḥar</i>, <span dir=\"ltr\">ברכות השחר</span>, these are preliminaries to the Morning Service and they consist of hymns, blessings, and meditations, the themes of which are generally concerned with the change of night to day and of sleep to wakefulness. There are also readings from the Torah and rabbinical writings to get the soul ready for worship. Originally this part of the service was to be read at home before coming to the synagogue for communal prayer.<br>Hertz, <i>op</i>. <i>cit</i>., p. 4.<br>(2) The Psalms and Passages of Song or <i>Pesukai de-Zimra</i>, <span dir=\"ltr\">פסוקי דזמרא</span>. This section of psalms and anthems is intended to serve as the transference from private worship in the first section to public prayer. The tradition says that pious men during the days of the Second Temple would completely read the entire Book of Psalms everyday. This was an ideal that men with necessary work could never emulate, thus it became the custom to read at least six psalms in the morning, Psalms 145-150. There have been additions to this nucleus. Prior to the above mentioned psalms, are recited other psalm-like selections, I Chronicles 16:8-36, a collection of Biblical verses, Psalm 100, and more Biblical verses. Psalms 145-150 are followed by responses of adoration (“doxologies”), the benediction of David, I Chronicles 29:10-13; the prayer of Nehemiah 9:6-11; and the Song of Moses, Exodus 14:30 - 15:18. Therefore this section contains no formal prayers but only psalm-like material.

This is truely the central part of the Morning (and the Evening) Service. It is Israel’s confession of faith in the One God. The worshipper, by reciting it, proclaims his allegiance to the Kingdom of Heaven and his submission to God’s commandments. The <i>Shema</i> is preceded by two blessings; (1) The <i>Yotzer</i>, <span dir=\"ltr\">יוצר</span>, Prayer which is a prayer of thanksgiving for the creation of physical life, for the actual light of day and for God’s renewal of creation which is demonstrated by the fact that the sun, the light, returns; and (2) The <i>Ahavah Rabbah</i>, <span dir=\"rtl\">אהבה רבה</span>, a gracious prayer of thanksgiving, gives thanks to God for the light of Torah which he gave to Israel and its moral teachings.<br>The <i>Shema</i> in the <i>Shaḥarit</i> Service is followed by two prayers; (1) the <i>Emet Veyaẓiv</i>, <span dir=\"ltr\">אמת ויציב</span>, which means (True and Firm).

(2) and the prayer <i>Go’el Israel</i>, <span dir=\"ltr\">גואל ישראל</span>, the Redeemer of Israel which praises God.<br><i>ibid</i>., p. 108.<br>The <i>Shema</i> itself consists of three Torah sections, Deuteronomy 6:4-8; 11:13-22; and Numbers 15:37-42. It is a proclamation of God’s Unity and Oneness, Israel’s total loyalty to God and his commandments, the belief in Divine Justice, the rememberance of the liberation from Egypt, and the choosing of Israel. Together these form the foundation of Jewish faith.<br><i>ibid</i>., p. 116.<br>(4) The Amidah, <span dir=\"ltr\">עמידה</span>, is the most central and important part of the service next to the <i>Shema</i>. It is also referred to as the <i>Tefillah</i>, <span dir=\"ltr\">התפילה</span>, “The Prayer” and the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. <span dir=\"ltr\">שמונה עשרה</span>, or eighteen benedictions because it originally contained eighteen separate benedictions but which has come down to us as a prayer consisting of nineteen benedictions during the regular daily worship service. The Prayer is recited three times a day silently while standing, therefore the name <i>Amidah</i> which means “standing” became associated with it. The benedictions contain expressions of praise, thanksgiving, confession, and petition to God.<br>The <i>Amidah</i> contains three basic parts. The first part consists of three opening benedictions which are praises. They glorify God, His everlasting love and His infinite holiness. The second part of the weekday <i>Amidah</i> contains thirteen blessings (which were originally only twelve) which are petitions for the individual as well as for the nation. This middle section of the <i>Amidah</i> is different on the Sabbath and festivals. On the Sabbath there is only one benediction in the middle of the <i>Amidah</i> (therefore only a total of seven benedictions) and it concerns the special nature of the day. A <i>Kedusha</i> or a sanctification of the name of God, is included in this section of the Sabbath morning <i>Amidah</i>. On the festivals this is also the case with a special middle benediction which concerns the unique nature of the holiday. This is true of all festivals except Rosh HaShanah which contains three central blessings in its <i>Musaf Amidah</i> (see footnote 166), thus making a total of nine benedictions.<br>The third part of the <i>Amidah</i> consists of three closing benedictions whose theme is one of thanksgiving. The first three and last three benedictions never change regardless of which service the <i>Amidah</i> is found in or on what day it is recited. The prayer is first recited privately in silence and it is then repeated out loud by the reader (except for the Evening Service, see footnote 144) for the benefit of those who are unable to say it themselves (see also footnote 42).<br><i>ibid</i>., pp. 130-31.<br>(5) The <i>Taḥanun</i>, <span dir=\"ltr\">תחנון</span>, prayers of confession; see footnote 10.<br>(6) The Torah reading on the mornings that it is required, namely on the Sabbath, festivals, Mondays, Thursdays, New Moons, the intermediate days of Passover and Succot, Purim and public fast days. Normally, that is on most Sabbaths, Mondays and Thursdays the Torah is read according to its regular weekly division of fifty-four (on a leap year and fifty on a non-leap year) portions. On special Sabbaths, festivals, and other occasions specially designated portions are read which have a relationship with that particular occasion.<br>(7) <i>Ashrei</i>. <span dir=\"ltr\">אשרי</span>, “Happy are they” is basically Psalm 20 and a collection of Biblical quotations.

It is usually preceded by a full <i>Kaddish</i> (see footnote 177) read by the reader and it is followed by a Mourner’s Kaddish. The <i>Aleinu</i> or adoration prayer since the fourteenth century has been a proclaimation of God as the Supreme King of the Universe and the God of a United Humanity. In the first part Israel aknowledges that it has been selected for service to God and the second half proclaims Israel’s faith and hope that all idolatry will disappear and that all activity will be turned to God. All will be united under the Kingship of God.<br>Hertz, <i>op</i>. <i>cit.</i>, p. 208.<br>The <i>Shaḥarit</i> Service remains fairly constant in the prayers recited every morning except for the <i>Amidah</i> which changes according to the occasion as described above. There are also additions to the <i>pesukei de-zimra</i> (2) on Sabbaths and festivals, and on festivals and New Moons the <i>Hallel</i> (special psalms of praise and thanksgiving which consist of Psalms 113-118 with various Psalms omitted on certain festivals) is added. Special <i>piyyutim</i> (see footnote 149) are also inserted on certain Sabbaths and festivals during the <i>Shaḥarit</i> Service.<br>The Mishna and Talmud discuss when the <i>Shaḥarit</i> Service should be recited. The <i>Shema</i> must be recited from the period of time which begins with daybreak and ends after a quarter of the day has passed (Ber. 1:2; Shulḥan Arukh, <i>Oraḥ Ḥayyim</i>, 58:1). One must recite the <i>Amidah</i> during the hours encompassed by sunrise and a third of the day (Ber. 4:1; Shulḥan Arukh, <i>Oraḥ Ḥayyim</i>, 89:1). If by chance the recitation of the daily prayers was delayed they could be recited until midday (Ber. 4:1; Shulḥan Arukh, <i>Oraḥ Ḥayyim</i> 89:1). If the <i>Shaḥarit Amidah</i> is not recited, an extra Amidah is added during the <i>Minḥaḥ</i>, Afternoon Service.<br>During the daily weekday <i>Shaḥarit</i> Service the <i>tallit</i>, prayer shawl, and the <i>tefillin</i>, phylacteries, are worn. On the Sabbath and festivals only the <i>tallit</i> is worn. One wears neither <i>tallit</i> nor <i>tefillin</i> on the Ninth day of Av for the <i>Shaḥarit</i> Serivce but wears them instead for the <i>Minḥah</i> Service. One must not interupt one’s prayer by speaking from the prayer “<i>Barukh she-Amar</i>” which precedes the <i>pesukei de-zimra</i> until after the <i>Amidah</i>.<br>Editorial Staff, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 14, pp. 1257-58.</i> (Morning Prayers) on the Eve of Yom Kippur."

            "<b>“The custom of “<i>kapprot</i></b><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Kapparot,</i> <span dir=\"ltr\">כפרות</span>, which is plural for <i>Kapparah</i>, meaning expiation. This is a custom where the sins of a person are symbolically transferred to a fowl. This practice is mostly done on the day before Yom Kippur and in some congregations it is also performed on the day before Rosh HaShanah or on Hoshana Rabba. During the ceremony Psalms 107;10,14,17-21 and Job 33:23-24 are recited. Following this a cock is taken for a male and a hen for a female, the fowl is swung around one’s head three times while the person says: “This is my substitute, my vicarious offering, my atonement; this cock (or hen) shall meet death, but I shall find a long and pleasent life of peace”. It is thought by some (erroneously) that the fowl assumes the punishment for sins that the person would normally receive. Often the fowl is donated to the poor minus the intestines which are given to the birds. Some people substitute the monetary value of the fowl and donate that to the poor.<br>The custom is not a talmudic one. It first appears in the writings of the <i>geonim</i> (see footnote 19) in the ninth century. The connection between a man and a cock is that both can be referred to as a <i>gever</i>, so a <i>gever</i> (man) can transfer his sins on to another <i>gever</i> (cock). Another reason for the use of a cock or a hen was due to the fact that after the destruction of the Temple, no animal used in the sacrificial rite could be used for a similar purpose outside the Temple. The cock and the hen had no Temple cultic connection. Caro, along with R. Solomon b. Abraham Adret and Naḥmanides opposed this custom but Isserles included it because of its practice in the Ashkenazi community where it had taken on mystic interpretations from the Kabbalists.<br>Editorial Staff, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 10, pp. 756-57.<br>The basic Hebrew sources and comments on <i>Kapparot</i> are the following:<br><i>Tur</i>, <span dir=\"rtl\">טור</span>, (see footnote 23) 605 - There are places where it is customary to slaughter a rooster as atonement (for <i>Kapparah</i>). And thus it is (related) in geonic (see footnote 19) responsa: “You asked; we customarily slaughter a rooster on the Eve of Yom Kippur, and we do not know the reason for this custom. If it is an “exchange” (substitute) for a sacrifice (if it symbolizes a sacrifice), then what is the difference between a rooster and cattle or a beast, but certainly there is a problem. However, there are two reasons: (1) a rooster is found more commonly in a household than any cattle, beast, or fowl; (2) There are places of wealthy people who substitute rams; and the main horned animal (for the Yom Kippur ceremony) is analogous to the ram of our father Isaac (which was substituted for him (Isaac) as a sacrifice), therefore the matter (of using a rooster) is not established (determined).”<br>In addition we have heard from the early scholars that even though the price of a cattle is higher than that of a rooster, nevertheless a rooster is chosen because its designation is <i>gever</i> (man, rooster) as is said in (<i>Yoma</i> 20a): What is the meaning of <i>Kara Gavra</i>, R. Sila says the meaning is that the rooster crows and since its designation is <i>gever</i> and the exchange is of one <i>gever</i> (rooster) for another <i>gever</i> (man), therefore it (using a rooster) is effective and superior (to any other animal). And this is the custom here, the congregational reader holds the rooster and lays his hand on its head (in the manner in which a sacrifice was performed in the Temple) and then he takes it (the rooster) and lays it upon the head of the one seeking atonement and says (the verses in the Prayer Book used in this service (<i>Oẓar ha-Tefillot</i>, volume 2, pp. 1090-91)). “This (<i>gever</i>, rooster) for this (<i>gever</i>, man), this substitutes this, this is in exchange for this,” and he (the reader) returns it upon him once (swings it around his (the one seeking atonement’s) head one time) and says (psalms 107:10,14,17,19-21) “Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron…He brought them out of darkness and and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder…Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities are afflicted… Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble and He saves them out of their distress. He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions. Oh, that men would praise the Lord for His goodness, and for His wonderful works to the children of men.” “Thou shalt give life for life”, (Exodus 21:23). And he (the reader) does this according to this order three times, and after this he lays his hand on the head of the rooster in the way of the <i>Semikhah</i>, putting the hands on it (the animal’s head before slaughtering) and slaughter it immediately after the <i>Semikhah</i>, and they customarily give it (the slaughtered rooster) to the poor so there would be atonement for his own soul (for the one who gives it).<br>That it was customary to throw the insides of it (the rooster) on the roof in order to give them to the birds, there is some proof (indication, justification) for this from the Talmud tractate <i>Ḥulin</i> (95a) 110a: “Rami b. Tamri… once happened to be in Sura on the Eve of Yom Kippur. When the townspeople took all the udders (<i>Tur</i>: Liver and Kidneys) (of the animals) and threw them away, he immediately went and collected them and ate them”.<br>In the Prayer Book <i>Oẓar ha-Tefillot</i>, <span dir=\"ltr\">אוצר התפילות</span> Published by Sefer, New York, 1946, page 1089, there is an extensive, detailed note with Rashi’s (description of) the custom of the <i>Kapparot</i> ceremony on the Eve of Yom Kippur. Rashi already described this custom meaning it was a common practice during his time.<br>The <i>Kapparot</i> ceremony is not mentioned in the Talmud, only in Rashi. It is mentioned in <i>Maḥzor Vitry</i> by R. Shimḥa bar Samuel, a disciple of Rashi who quotes the ceremony from the <i>Pesikta</i>, <span dir=\"ltr\">פסקתא</span>, but our text of the <i>Pesikta</i> does not have it. The first mention of the <i>Kapparot</i> ceremony is by the geonic Sheshna in <i>Sha’are Teshuvot</i>, Responsum 299, and by Natronai Gaon in <i>Bet Nekhot ha-Halakhot</i> 50a. paragraphs 15 and 16.</i>” <b>(atonement ceremony) on the Eve of Yom Kippur” - Containing one paragraph.</b><br>The custom regarding the “<i>kapparah</i>” (atonement ceremony) on the Eve of Yom Kippur by slaughtering a rooster for each male and to say biblical verses over it should be stopped.<br><i>Hagah</i>: There are some <i>geonim</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Geonim</i>, (singular <i>gaon</i>) is the formal title for the heads of the academies in Sura and Pumbedita in Babylonia from around the end of the sixth century until the middle of the eleventh century. The <i>geonim</i> were the highest Jewish authorities. In the tenth and eleventh centuries heads of academies in Ereẓ Israel were also called <i>geonim</i>. The geonic period proper ended in 1040. The heads of the academies in Baghdad, Damascus, and Egypt were also called geonim and later it became a term applied as an honor to any rabbi who had great toraitic knowledge.<br>It cannot exactly be determined when the term <i>gaon</i> came into use. Prior to its use generally the term <i>rosh yeshivah shel golah</i>, the head of the academy of the Diaspora, was used. The heads of these academies were appointed by the exilarchs, the political leaders of the Jewish people in exile. People rose to the office of <i>gaon</i> often through an hierarchy of offices, thus not always did the most learned reach the position. Often the office was used for political purposes by the exilarch. An assistant to the <i>gaon</i> was referred to as the <i>av bet din</i>. The position of <i>gaon</i> usually fell upon an elderly man who could only serve for a rather short period of time, and therefore did not always make a great impression.<br>Babylonia was the center of world Jewry and the Jews looked to the <i>geonim</i> as a source of instruction for Jews and also as the deciders of Jewish law. The <i>geonim</i> formed many new halakhic decisions which evolved in the Diaspora. They formulated <i>takkanot</i> or ordinances which altered Jewish law according to the new situations. The <i>geonim</i> and their academies were supported by taxes levied against the people for this purpose.<br>The halakhic decision of a <i>gaon</i> generally had the effect of law and it was binding. Due to the new situation which the Diaspora provided many halakhic decisions of the <i>geonim</i> were based on <i>minhagim</i>, or customs, that took on the force of a law (the principle under which Isserles operated). Their responsa to halakhic questions were followed as law. The goal of the <i>gaon</i> in the Diaspora was mainly to interpret the Babylonian Talmud for the Babylonian Jews and to lessen their emotional attachment to Ereẓ Israel. This created much political animosity between the Jews of Babylonia and those left in Ereẓ Israel. Since the major scholars of the time where exiled to Babylonia, the center of Jewish leadership was in the hands of the <i>gaon</i> for a long period of time, more than four centuries.<br>The goanate, though, did lose its power even though some of the greatest geonim were among the later ones. From the late ninth century onward, most of the <i>geonim</i> did not live in the cities of the academies, Sura and Pumbedita, they lived in Baghdad along with the exilarch. Competition between the two academies and political disagreements over the appointment of <i>geonim</i> lessened their effectiveness as did the rise of new academies and their leaders. Scholars stopped sending them halakhic questions preferring their own ability to arrive at a decision. Jewish communities outside of Babylonia began taking on independence from the original center of the Diaspora. As the caliphate in Baghdad weakened, financial support from other Jewish communities ceased for the Babylonian academies. The gaonate ended as an institution around 1040.<br>The religious leaders of Baghdad and later Ereẓ Israel took on the title of <i>gaon</i> after the fall of the gaonate in Babylonia. The position of the <i>gaon</i> in Ereẓ Israel was one passed on by heredity. The geonim in Ereẓ Israel had to manage all Jewish affairs in addition to heading the academy. They ordained rabbis, appointed judges, and managed the economic affairs of the Jews. The title of <i>gaon</i> finally spread to Damascus and Egypt where it eventually died out in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.<br>Simha Assaf and Editorial Staff, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 7, pp. 315-24.</i> who listed this custom (as a proper custom) and likewise many of the <i>aḥronim</i> listed it thusly.

David ben Samuel was born in the Ukraine. He married the daughter of Joel Sirkes, the author of <i>Bayit Ḥadash</i> (see footnote 20b.) in whose yeshivah he studied. The commentary <i>Turei Zahav</i> is found to all four parts of the Shulḥan Arukh. It is not a running commentary, but includes discussions of various points found in the <i>Tur</i> of Jacob Asher (see footnote 23) and in the Talmud and its commentators. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> is found in the inside margin of the <i>Oraḥ Ḥayyim</i> section of the Shulḥan Arukh opposite the commentary of Abraham Abel Gumbiner called <i>Magen Avraham</i> (see footnote 33), which is a running commentary but which has a closer relationship to the material found in the <i>Tur</i> than it does to the Shulḥan Arukh;<br>Shmuel Ashkenazi, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 5, pp. 1354-55.<br>605:1 - “And so is the custom in all these lands”: In the <i>Tur</i>, <span dir=\"rtl\">טור</span>, (see footnote 23 and the translation to this section of the <i>Tur</i> found in footnote 18) are written the verses that are recited and the following verse is mentioned there (in addition to the verses found in Psalms 107:10,14,17,-21), “Thou shalt give life for life” (Exodus 21:23).</i>. and it is not to be changed because it is a custom of the pious.

Caro began writing the <i>Beit Yosef</i> in 1522 and completed it in 1542 in Safed. It was first published in 1555. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> followed the format of the four <i>Turim</i> established by Jacob b. Asher in his book by that title. Caro included in the <i>Beit Yosef</i> all the halakhic material in use during his time which included the talmudic sources and also the post-talmudic scholars which he used to reach an halakhic decision. Caro linked himself to the <i>Turim</i> and did not repeat halakhic material already cited in the <i>Turim</i>. Caro employed the method of determining <i>halakhah</i> by following the majority decision of his “three pillars of halakhic decisions”, Alfasi, Maimonides, and Asher b. Jehiel. If there was no majority decision by these three he consulted and decided according to the majority of another five scholars, Naḥmanides, Solomon b. Abraham Adret, Nissim Gerondi, Mordecai b. Hillel, and Moses b. Jacob of Coucy. If none of these men dealt with a particular law he decided according to the opinions of the majority of “famous” scholars. Caro consulted thirty-two works in his research. In this extensive work Caro created a book of Jewish law. He wanted to create then a companion book that would truly be a code. Therefore he wrote the Shulḥan Arukh which basically listed only the decisions that Caro reached in the <i>Beit Yosef</i> and not all the arguments and sources. The Shulḥan Arukh merely stated what the <i>halakhah</i> was and how it was practiced. (For a more extensive explanation of the <i>Beit Yosef</i> and how it fits into the broad scope of code literature, see the introduction to this work.)<br><i>Tashbaẓ</i>, <span dir=\"rtl\">תשב״ץ</span>, is an abbreviation for <i>Teshuvot Shimon ben Ẓemaḥ</i>, which is a collection of responsa in three parts by Simeon ben Ẓemaḥ Duran who was also known as the “<i>Rashbaẓ</i>”, an acronym for <i>R</i>abbi <i>S</i>himon <i>ben Ẓ</i>emaḥ, who lived from 1361 until 1444. The <i>Rashbaẓ</i> was born in Spain and later moved to North Africa and settled in Algiers where he became a <i>dayyan</i>, a rabbinic judge and the Chief Rabbi of Algiers in 1408. The <i>Rashbaẓ</i> was against formulating strict decisions, <i>ḥumrot</i>, which did not have talmudical basis. He argued that one could be stringent with oneself but had to be lenient with others.<br>In his decisions he would exhaust all existing sources and discuss all opinions. His decisions became the authoritative laws of North African Jewry. His <i>takkanot</i>, his changes in the law, were followed for many centuries. He was often quoted by later halakhic scholars and was well respected. His writings were extensive and they included philosophical and liturgical works as well as halakhic literature.<br>Hirsch Jacob Zimmels, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 6, pp. 302-06.</i> For a pregnant woman to take two roosters<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20a</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The following is a comment found in the commentary to the Shulḥan Arukh, <i>Oraḥ Ḥayyim Magen Avraham</i> by Abraham Abele Gumbiner (see footnote 33): 605:2 - “Two roosters”: That is to say a rooster and a hen.

The Shulḥan Arukh appeared which was basically a digest of the larger <i>Beit Yosef</i>, but the <i>Levush</i> was completed so as to include the laws observed by the Ashkenazi Jews of Behemia. Mordecai ben Abraham Jaffe (1535-1612) wrote the <i>Levush</i>. He was born in Prague and studied under Solomon Luria and Moses Isserles. While he was writing the <i>Levush</i> he learned that Isserles was attempting the same goal he was to include the Ashkenazi laws in the Shulḥan Arukh so he put aside his work. When Jaffe received the glosses of his teacher Isserles he thought it was too brief and therefore he set about completing his <i>Levush</i>. There are ten <i>levushim</i> in all, five are devoted to the <i>Beit Yosef</i> and the other five to other works; Ephraim Kupfer, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 9, pp. 1263-64). And this is the custom even with two persons, and this is the implied meaning at the end of chapter 12 in (the Talmud Tractate) <i>Menaḥot</i>. And Ashkenazi R. Isaac (who was called Adoneinu R. Yitzḥak by the <i>Ḥasidim</i>, referring to Isaac Luria the Kabbalist) prescribed that she take three (chickens), (<i>Shenei Luḥot ha-Berit</i>, <span dir=\"ltr\">של״ה</span>, “Two Tablets of the Covenant”; which is an extensive halakhic work including homily and <i>Kabbalah</i> giving directions as to how to live an ethical life. The vast work contains two parts, the <i>Derekh Ḥayyim</i> contains laws according to the order of the festivals in the calendar, and the <i>Luḥot ha-Berit</i> summarizes the 613 commandments in the order in which they appear in the Bible. The work was written by Isaiah ben Abraham ha-Levi Horowitz who lived from around 1565 until 1630. He was born in Prague but lived and studied mostly in Poland. He later moved to Ereẓ Israel and lead the Ashkenazi community in Jerusalem. He was greatly influenced by Kabbalistic works and philosophy which is evident in his writings; Haim Hillel Ben-Sasson <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 8, 990-994).</i> for the possibility she might give birth to a male (infant). The (custom is to) chose white roosters<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20b</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A commentary by <i>Magen Avraham</i> (see footnote 33): 605:3 - “White roosters”: Anyhow, one should not try to get only white (chickens), which is similar to the practice of the Amorites (meaning, idol worshippers). If there happens to be a white one available he should buy it, (<i>Bayit Hadash</i>, <span dir=\"ltr\">בית חדש</span>; which is a critical and comprehensive commentary on the <i>Arba’ah Turim</i> of Jacob b. Asher (see footnote 23), where each law is traced to its talmudic source, and the development of the law through successive generations of interpretation is followed. The work was prompted by the over-reliance on codes, especially the Shulḥan Arukh for halakhic decisions, without using the basic sources. The work was written by Joel Sirkes who lived from 1561 until 1640. He was born in Lublin but came to be the head of the <i>bet din</i>, the rabbinical court, in Cracow where he also headed a yeshivah in 1619. He was an adherent of <i>Kabbalah</i> but he rejected kabbalistic practices when they were contrary to the <i>halakhah</i>; Max Jonah Routtenberg, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 14, pp. 1619-20.). And if there is no chicken, he should buy another kind of animal, and there are those who say even fish (can be used), (<i>Levush</i>, <span dir=\"rtl\">לבוש</span>, see footnote 20a.). It seems to me that one should not take a thing (an animal that was used) for the sacrificial cult like doves so that it should not appear that one sacrifices holy animals outside the Temple, see in the <i>Tur</i>, <span dir=\"rtl\">טור</span>, (see footnote 23), and we find it in <i>Shabbat</i> 81b, in the Rashi, that it was a custom to take a pot with seeds and to swing it around one’s head on the Eve of Yom Kippur, and one says the words: “This is the exchange for me, the substitute for me, the atonement for me”, which is an abbreviation meaning, <span dir=\"rtl\">חת״ך</span>, which is the name of an angel, (<i>Darkei Moshe</i>, <span dir=\"rtl\">ד״מ</span>, see footnote 6, and <i>Hagahot Minhagim</i>, <span dir=\"rtl\">הגמ״נ</span>, which are commentary notes on the Minhagim, see footnote 13).<br>The following is a comment found in the <i>Turei Zahav</i>, (see footnote 19a.): 605:2 - “And the (custom is to) chose white ones”; My father-in-law (meaning the <i>Bayit Ḥadash</i>, Joel Sirkes, see above), may his memory be blessed, wrote that this is a bit like the way of the Amorites (idol worshippers), even though this is (found in) the <i>Maharil</i>, <span dir=\"rtl\">מהרי״ל</span>, (see footnote 8), it is possible that one should not ask for it intentionally, rather if (the white chicken) just happens to him thus (if he can buy a white one) he choses it, but to ask for a white chicken and to pay a higher price, this is the way of the Amerites (idol worshippers), and this (tradition) I received from my father (Samuel ha-Levi), may his memory be blessed.<br>I found written that one should say, “This is your exchange, your substitution, and your atonement” which is an abbreviation for <span dir=\"rtl\">חת״ך</span>, which means God will cut (<span dir=\"rtl\">חתך</span>) (or determine) life for every living thing.

And even though the rooster is not proper as a sacrifice, since we found that it is a forbidden practice in chapter 469 (of the Shulḥan Arukh, <i>Oraḥ Ḥayyim</i>) concerning the matter of such meat for the Passover for which the <i>Maharil</i>, <span dir=\"rtl\">מהרי״ל</span>, (see footnote 8) forbid even a rooster, and how much the more so here, where one does it explicitly as a sacrificial matter, that this fear is present (this consideration that it might be prohibited is present). This being so it is better to prevent this matter, (following the dictum to sit and not do it is better. (This expression, <span dir=\"rtl\">ושב ואל תעשה</span>, is found in <i>Erubim</i> 100a: if by performing a <i>mitzvah</i> you might transgress a law, you should not do it. In a case of doubt do not do such a thing.) And so it seems to me in my humble opinion.</i> on it like (it was done with) the Sacrifice<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The “laying of the hands” of the priest onto the animal that was sacrificed was part of the rite which transformed the animal from a mere profane animal into a holy sacrifice to God. Sacrifice from the biblical through the temple Period in Jerusalem was the way in which man communicated with God. Extensive rituals and practices developed around the sacrifice which was performed by the special priestly class, the <i>cohanim</i>. The main thrust behind a sacrifice was the fact that man was surrendering to God a living thing of some value to man. This brought out vividly the fact that all things man has on earth are given by God and ultimately God has complete control over man and all He has given to man. Special concern was placed on the blood of an animal sacrifice for <i>dam</i>, <span dir=\"rtl\">דם</span>, blood, was the symbol of life. “For the life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it for your souls; for it is the blood that makes atonement, by reason of the life (that is in it)”, (Leviticus 17:11). The people were therefore forbidden to eat the blood of an animal since it belonged to God. The offering to God of a sacrifice had to be an animal which was owned by the person offering it and the animal had to be domesticated and proper for food. In other words, it had to have some worth. Work animals were excluded from this. An animal had to be at least eight days old and totally without blemishes, (Leviticus 22:17-25).<br>A very large portion of the Bible, especially the Pentateuch, is concerned with the extensive ritual, ceremony, and material that went into a sacrifice. Also different types of sacrifices were outlined for different purposes. The following are separate types of sacrifices present in the Bible: Propitiatory, both Sin and Guilt Offerings, Dedicatory, Burnt, Meal, Libation, Fellowship, Peace and Thanksgiving, Wave, Votive, Freewill, and Ordination Offerings.<br>During the period of the First and Second Temple, elaborate sacrificial services took place twice daily, <i>Shaḥrit</i>, Morning and <i>Minḥah</i>, Afternoon, along with special sacrifices for Sabbaths, festivals, and special circumstances.<br>Yom Kippur, being the holiest day of the year had associated with it a special and unique sacrificial atonement ritual. The <i>Avodah</i>, <span dir=\"rtl\">עבודה</span>, which means literally “service” was the name applied to the ritual, during the Temple period, which was the central part of the <i>Musaf</i>, <span dir=\"rtl\">מוסף</span>, additional, sacrifice on the Day of Atonement. With the <i>Avodah</i>, which is a poetical recounting of the Temple ritual, became the central part of the <i>Musaf</i> liturgy (see footnote 166) for the Day of Atonement. The ritual itself was based on the sixteenth chapter of Leviticus where the special sacrifical ritual for atonement is described. After the detailing of the ritual is completed, the Bible established that the tenth day of the seventh month (the tenth of Tishrei which today is considered the first month) would be set aside as a special Sabbath for the purpose of atonement, (Leviticus 16:29-31). The extensive details associated with the sacrifice on the Day of Atonement are described in the Talmud in tractate <i>Yoma</i>.<br>It was on Yom Kippur, and only on Yom Kippur, that the high priest would enter the very center of the Temple, the Holy of Holies. He had to make special preparations for this ritual. One week prior to the Day of Atonement, the high priest would begin living in a special apartment in the Temple court where he studied with the scholarly elders all the special laws of Yom Kippur. Another priest would also stand-by and study in case something happened to the high priest. The day prior to Yom Kippur the high priest would enter the Temple and perform all the minute details involved in a sacrifice along with the other priests who were used to sacrificing. The high priest rarely performed the regular daily sacrifices, he only functioned on special occasions. On the Day of Atonement, the high priest himself would perform all the sacred and sacrificial duties.<br>After proper cleansing for the <i>Musaf</i>, or <i>Avodah</i> Service the high priest would first sacrifice a bull as his own personal sin offering after which he would confess and purify the sins of his own family, those of the priests (the tribe of Aaron), and finally those of the whole congregation of Israel, (Leviticus 16:6). The high priest, in the Holy of Holies, would carefully sprinkle and dispose of the animal’s blood as was prescribed. It was at this time, and only at this time, that he would utter the holy name of God, the Tetragrammaton, <span dir=\"rtl\">יהוה</span>, and when he uttered this the people outside would prostrate themselves and respond, “Blessed be His Name whose glorious kingdom is forever ever and ever.” This was repeated ten times according to the Babylonian Talmud, (Yoma 2:2) and thirteen times according to the Jerusalem Talmud (Yoma 3:7).<br>The high priest then drew lots, one marked for “Azazel” and the other marked as a “sin offering for the Lord”. Depending upon the drawing of the lots, two he-goats had different parts to play in the remaining ritual. The goat marked “for Azazel” would be lead out of the Temple into the wilderness called Azazel. This he-goat symbolically carried the sins of Israel away and was lost over a cliff in the wilderness along with Israel’s sins. A red ribbon which had been tied to the goat was brought back to the people to display to them that the goat had been lost in Azazel. The he-goat marked as a “sin offering for the Lord” was offered as such. This was followed by a special incense-offering and a prayer for good weather, prosperity, and the sovereignty of Judah, whereupon the high priest would come out from the Holy of Holies marking the end to the <i>Avodah</i> ritual.<br>The <i>Avodah</i> liturgy expanded in its development from simply a description of the Temple service and the reading of Mishna <i>Yoma</i>, chapters 1-7 to an elaborate service rich with special liturgical poems, <i>piyyutim</i> (see footnote 149), most of them acrostics, their beginning word following the alphabet. Different Jewish communities developed separate rites. Most rites contain a brief synopsis of the history of Israel and the purity of its early generations culminating in a description of the Temple ritual on the Day of Atonement and the Holy of Holies. Some communities and rites even still call for a prostration on the floor of the synagogue during the <i>Avodah</i> Service as was done at the Temple upon the prononciation of the Tetragrammaton.<br><i>Piyyutim</i> also close the <i>Avodah</i> Service expressing the misfortune of Israel who, because of her sins, is deprived of the Temple and its sacrificial cult and must suffer persecution and exile. The <i>piyyutim</i> call for the reestablishment of the Temple, which is followed by the <i>seliḥot</i> (see footnote 14) prayers (penitential prayers of forgiveness) of the <i>Musaf</i> Service.<br>Anson Rainey, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 14, pp. 599-602; Hanoch Avenary, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 3, pp. 976-80.</i>; and they (it is customary) throw their intestines on the roofs or in a courtyard, a place from where fowls are able to take (the intestines of the slaughtered chickens), (<span dir=\"ltr\">טור</span>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tur</i>, <span dir=\"rtl\">טור</span>, is the singular for the word <i>Turim</i> or the <i>Arba’ah Turim</i>, the four columns, the major halakhic work of Jacob ben Asher who lived from around 1270 until 1340. He was the son of a famous halakhic authority, Asher b. Jehiel, known as the “<i>Rosh</i>”. Jacob ben Asher studied under his father and moved with him from Germany to Toledo in 1303. His work on the <i>Turim</i> was the result of the fact that in his time there was no one halakhic work free from controversy. Different opinions were present and there were no clear and authoritative halakhic decisions. Jacob ben Asher wanted to compose a work which would include all the laws and customs which applied in his day. He divided his work into four sections or <i>turim</i>, “rows”. Part one was called <i>Oraḥ Ḥayyim</i>. It contains 697 chapters on the laws of blessings, prayers, Sabbaths, festivals, and fasts. The second part was called <i>Yoreh De’ah</i>. It contains 403 chapters on the laws of ritual, <i>Issur ve-Hetter</i> (that which was forbidden and that which was permitted), and laws of mourning, idolatry, and usury. Part three, <i>Even ha-Ezer</i>, has 178 chapters on the laws affecting women; marriage, divorce, wedding contracts (<i>Ketubbah</i>), and childless widowhood (<i>ḥaliẓah</i>). The fourth part, <i>Ḥoshen Mishpat</i>, contains 427 chapters on civil law and personal relations.<br>Jacob ben Asher used the Talmud and its commentaries as well as the opinions of other authorities before him. He usually decided according to the opinion of Maimonides and his father, Asher b. Jehiel. He did though differ with Maimonides on questions of faith and belief.<br>The <i>Turim</i> was first published in 1475 and it became a widely accepted halakhic code. Joseph Caro used it and its organization as the basis for the <i>Beit Yosef</i> and the Shulḥan Arukh.

Each time he should take three men with him, and if on the third time he does not become reconciled he (no longer) is obligated to him, (nevertheless afterwards he should say before ten (people) that he did request forgiveness from him), (<span dir=\"ltr\">מרדכי דיומא ומהרי״ל</span>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Mordekhai</i> in <i>Yoma</i> and <i>Maharil</i>, <span dir=\"rtl\">מרדכי דיומא ומהרי״ל</span>.<br>Mordecai ben Hillel ha-Kohen, the author of <i>Mordekhai</i>, <span dir=\"rtl\">מרדכי</span>, lived from approximately 1240 until 1298. Not much is known personally about this German author and rabbinic authority. He was a descendant of Eliezer b. Joel ha-Levi, a relative of Asher b. Jehiel, a brother-in-law to Meir ha-Kohen who wrote <i>Hagahot Maimuniyyot</i> (see footnote 27) and he was a pupil of Meir b. Baurch of Rothenburg, Isaac b. Moses of Vienna (author of <i>Or Zaru’a</i>, see footnote 118), and Perez b. Elijah of Corbeil. He died as a martyr along with his wife and five children in the Rindfleisch massacres. He is mostly known for his great work, <i>Sefer Mordekhai</i>, which is referred to as the “<i>Mordekhai</i>”. It is a huge collection which expanded upon talmudic problems in the style of the <i>tosafot</i> but which followed the arrangement of the laws established by Isaac Alfasi. Even though Mordecai does not include all of Alfasi’s laws, he included over three hundred books and authors and employed much material from the <i>Or Zaru’a</i> and responsa of Meir of Rothenburg. The <i>Mordekahi</i> was probably completed before 1286 when Meir was imprisoned because his writings are included in the book. The book was compiled by students of Mordecai who refer to him as “my master, Rabbi Mordecai”.<br>The book was widely distributed in two versions. The first version, the “Rhenish” contained customs of French, English, and eastern German communities. The “Austrian” version reflected the customs of south-eastern Europe, including Austria, Hungary, Bohemia, Saxony, and Moravia. Commentaries grew up around the <i>Mordekhai</i> including the <i>Hagahot Mordekhai</i> by Samuel Schlettstadt in 1376 (see footnote 198).<br>The <i>Mordekhai</i> became widely accepted even in the Sephardi Jewish communities. In fact, <i>Mordekhai</i> was one of the few Ashkenazi works that Joseph Caro cited in the <i>Beit Yosef</i> and the Shulḥan Arukh. The Mordekhai was the final halakhic ruling for most Jews until Moses Isserles came along.<br>The section of <i>Mordekhai</i> that is cited in this section of the Shulḥan Arukh is part of the commentary found in the <i>Mordekhai</i> on the Talmud tractate <i>Yoma</i>.<br>Israel Moses Ta-Shma, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 12, pp. 311-14.<br><i>Yoma</i>, <span dir=\"rtl\">יומא</span>, is the fifth tractate in the order of <i>Mo’ed</i> found in our Mishna and Tosefta. It concerns the laws of Yom Kippur. The word <i>Yoma</i> means “The Day” in Aramaic, referring to the Day of Atonement. The first seven chapters of the Mishna <i>Yoma</i> describe the elaborate Temple service performed by the high priest (see footnote 22), and the eighth and final chapter concerns primarily the laws of fasting.<br>Moshe David Herr, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 16, pp. 844-45.<br>For <i>Maharil</i>, <span dir=\"rtl\">מהרי״ל</span>; see footnote 8.</i> If he (i.e., the person who was wronged) was his teacher, he must go to him many times until he becomes appeased.<br><small><i>Hagah</i>: The person to forgive should not be cruel by refusing forgiveness (to the one seeking forgiveness), (<span dir=\"ltr\">מהרי״ל</span>)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Maharil</i>, <span dir=\"rtl\">מהרי״ל</span>; see footnote 8.</i>, unless his intent is for the good of the one requesting forgiveness, (<span dir=\"ltr\">גמרא דיומא</span>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Gemara Yoma</i>, <span dir=\"rtl\">גמרא דיומא</span>, is a reference to the Babylonian tractate of <i>Yoma</i> concerning the laws of Yom Kippur; see footnote 24.</i> But if one caused him (the wronged person) a bad name, there is no necessity in forgiving him, (<span dir=\"ltr\">מרדכי וסמ״ק והגה״מ פ״ב מהלכות תשובה ומהרי״ו</span>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Mordekhai</i> and <i>Sefer Mitzvot Katan</i> and <i>Hagahot Maimuniyyot</i> chapter two from “The Laws of Repentance” and <i>Mahariv</i>, <span dir=\"rtl\">מרדכי וסמ״ק והגה״מ פ״ב מהלכדת תשובה ומהרי״ו</span>.<br>For <i>Mordekhai</i>, <span dir=\"rtl\">מרדכי</span>; see footnote 24.<br>The acronym “SeMaK”, <i>Sefer Mitzvot Katan</i>, <span dir=\"rtl\">סמ״ק</span>, was written by Isaac ben Joseph of Corbeil who died in 1280. He was one of the greatest French codifiers of the thirteenth century. His “Small Book of Commandments” reflected his famous piety. This is the book for which he is known. His SeMaK is a collection of all the <i>halakhot</i> of his time period, along with ethical homilies, parables and legends, <i>aggadot</i>. He divided his work into seven “Pillars” corresponding to the seven days of the week where laws normally associated with a particular day were included under that day’s section. Isaac b. Joseph or Corbeil used as a guide for his work, though not his particular divisions, the previous work, <i>Sefer Mitzvot Gadol</i> (SeMaG, <span dir=\"rtl\">סמ״ג</span>, the “Big Book of Commandments”) by Moses of Coucy. The SeMaK, though, did not include the extensive halakhic arguments of the SeMaG.<br>The SeMaK became such a popular work in France and Germany that parts of it were inserted in the daily prayer-books to be read instead of the prayers of supplication and the psalms. It became an accepted source used by later codifiers. Commentaries on the SeMaK arose and were attached to it. The book was first published in 1510 in Constantinople. Isaac also wrote decisions to responsa and <i>tosafot</i> to several talmudic tractates. (For the place of the SeMaK in code literature, see the introduction to this thesis).<br>Israel Moses Ta-Shma, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 9, pp. 21-2.<br><i>Hagahot Maimuniyyot</i>, <span dir=\"rtl\">הגהות מיימוני</span>, was written by Meir ha-Kohen of Rothenburg who lived at the at the end of the thirteenth century and was a pupil of Meir b. Baruch of Rothenburg. <i>Hagahot Maimuniyyot</i> was written as a supplement and as notes of explanation to the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> by Maimonides (see the introduction to this paper for a description of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. See also footnote 59). The purpose of the glosses to this work was to add to the rulings of Maimonides the opinions and decisions of Germany and France in addition to the views and responsa the author brought from his teacher Meir b. Baruch of Rothenburg. With the addition of these <i>hagahot,</i> the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> became a halakhic work which could be an authoritative code in many of the different centers of Judaism of both Ashkenazi as well as Sephardi communities.<br>The <i>hagahot</i> were first published together with the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> in the edition that was printed in Constantinople in 1509 and they have been included ever since. There are fourteen books in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> but <i>hagahot</i> are not included with the following: <i>Hafla’ah Zera’im</i> (except for a small part at the end), <i>Avodah</i>, <i>Korbanot</i> and <i>Tohorah</i>.<br><i>Hagahot Maimuniyyot</i> was divided into two parts. One was a glosses and notes attached to the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> itself, and the second part was called <i>Teshuvot Maimuniyyot</i> (first published in Venice in 1524). It was added on to the end of each book of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> and it contained the responsa of German and French scholars relevant to the topics dealt with in the book. Some brief responsa, though, were included directly in the glosses if they had to do with the specific <i>halakhah</i>. Also non-responsa material was included in the <i>Teshuvot</i> section.<br>There were many differences between the 1509 Constantinople version and that published in Venice in 1524. It is obvious that this work underwent significant editing and additions.<br>The note cited by Isserles where he gave credit to <i>Hagahot Maimuniyyot</i> was taken from the notes of Meir ha-Kohen on the section of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> entitled <i>Hilkhot Teshuvah</i>, “the Laws of Repentance”, chapter two.<br>Shlomoh Zalman Havlin, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 7, pp. 1104-12.<br><i>Mahariv</i>, <span dir=\"rtl\">מהרי״ו</span>, is an acronym for <i>M</i>orenu <i>h</i>a-Rav <i>R</i>abenu Jacob (<i>Y</i>a’akov) <i>W</i>eil, who is also known as Jacob ben Judah Weil who died in 1456. He was a German rabbi and an halakhic authority in the first half of the fifteenth century. He lived in the town of Weil. Weil was a pupil of the <i>Maharil</i>, Jacob Moellin (see footnote 8). <i>Maharil</i> ordained him and made him the rabbi of Nuremberg after which he went to Augsburg, Bamberg, and finally Erfurt. Scholars addressed many halakhic questions to him and he published responsa to them. His decisions particularly on laws of slaughtering and examination of animals, <i>hilkhot sheḥitah u-vedikah</i>, were accepted Ashkenazi practice. His responsa were socially and historically valuable in that through the types of questions and answers, one can get a good picture of what German Jewish life was like at this time and how it functioned. He wrote a great deal on the office of the rabbi in Germany and included his suggestions to improve the responsibility and purify the practices of many rabbis.<br>Moses Isserles, especially, and others placed a great deal of importance on Weil’s decisions and relied on them as binding. His works, especially <i>Hilkhot Sheḥitah u-Vedikah</i> inspired many commentaries and additions by later authorities which became the basic work for <i>shoḥatim</i>. ritual slaughterers of animals for food.<br>Yehoshua Horowitz, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 16, pp. 395-96.</i></small>",

The Torah considers the following to be <i>ḥerem</i>: Israelites who worship other gods and idols. People who commit this idolatry were to be put to the sword and the objects burned. These people and objects contaminated those they came in contact with; The seven nations inhabiting the land promised to Israel - the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites (Deuteronomy 7:1-2; cf. 20:17). These people were to be totally destroyed; Whatever one privately devoted to the Lord as <i>ḥerem</i> is the most sacred, <i>Kodesh Kodashim</i>, and these objects were never to be sold nor was their status revokable (Leviticus 27:28). Cases of <i>ḥerem</i> in the rest of the Bible follow from these Torah laws. The term later came to mean total destruction.<br>The term <i>ḥerem</i> began to take on different meanings from the Biblical ones as time passed. Even the term <i>ḥerem</i> in the Bible changed its meaning. In Deuteronomy declaring an enemy as <i>ḥerem</i> was done to gain God’s favor by totally devoting to Him, one’s own nation and the total nation of the enemy.<br>After Saul the rise of the enemy <i>ḥerem</i> seems to have disappeared. <i>Ḥerem</i> came to mean, when referred to a nation that the other nation’s religion practiced evil ways that would badly influence the Israelites and therefore these people were to be separated from Israel to preserve their true belief in God (Exodus 34:11ff; Numbers 33:51ff; Deuteronomy 7:1-5; 20:16ff).<br>In later Jewish law the concept of <i>ḥerem</i> changed radically. The <i>ḥerem</i> of Ezra is the first indication that meant banishment and persecution. The term <i>niddui</i> was used in tannaitic literature to mean the punishment of an offender by his isolation from and his being held in contempt by the community at large. The term <i>niddui</i> was used in the Bible (Numbers 12:14) as an isolation punishment. The Pharisees employed <i>niddui</i> if a person did not follow their prescribed standards. A scholar was isolated for his non-compliance with the majority and no one was permitted to contact him lest they too became defiled. <i>Niddui</i> was a Punishment employed by the courts on the heads of the academies.<br>Later in the talmudic laws the term <i>ḥerem</i> was used again as an aggravated form of <i>niddui</i>. A <i>niddui</i> could last for two 30 day periods. After 60 days passed and the person did not satisfy the courts or the academies by changing his ways, a <i>ḥerem</i> was declared which was a total banishment and isolation. Another type of punishment was also established. That was a <i>nezifah</i>, a “reprimand”, which lasted for seven days. It was intended for shame and remorse and automatically expired while a <i>niddui</i> and a <i>ḥerem</i> had to be lifted by the courts.<br>A <i>niddui</i> differed from a <i>ḥerem</i> in that one who was declared <i>niddui</i> could have social intercourse for purposes of study or business, but one placed in <i>ḥerem</i> had to study alone and earn money from the small shop he was permitted to maintain. One punished by <i>niddui</i> or <i>ḥerem</i> was considered in a state of mourning and was therefore not permitted to cut his hair, do laundry, or wear shoes, except for out-of-town walks. He was forbidden to wash himself except for his face, hands, and feet but he did not have to rend his clothes. He had to live in confinement with his family only, no outsider was permitted to come near him, eat or drink with him, greet him, or give him any enjoyment (Shulḥan Arukh, <i>Yoreh De’ah</i> 334:2). He could not be counted as part of the three for grace after the meals nor as one of the ten for a prayer <i>minyan</i>. After his death, his coffin would be stoned, (one stone could be symbolically placed on the coffin). The <i>niddui</i> was actually considered a rather light penalty for minor offenses since it could be so easily lifted. <i>Niddui</i> was during talmudic times put on people by laymen and individual scholars for various reasons, not only by the courts, for reasons such as debt. Only a court designated <i>niddui</i> would necessitate the whole community from disassociating with the isolated person. A non-judicial <i>niddui</i> did not require this. A person had to be warned about a possible <i>niddui</i> for a non-religious offense, but for a religious one no warning was necessary. The <i>niddui</i> had to be publically announced but no evidence was required. The court was considered fair. A <i>niddui</i> by a court could be lifted by any court. A personal <i>niddui</i> had to be lifted by the person who imposed it and, if he was unavailable, by the <i>nasi</i> or leader of the community. The courts tended not to pronounce a <i>niddui</i> against a judge or a scholar. Flogging (see footnote 31) was considered a more appropriate punishment.<br>In post-talmudic times the threat of a <i>niddui</i> or a <i>ḥerem</i> was considered a way of future law enforcement. As time went on the conditions put on one who was excommunicated in the Talmud became the minimum. They became more and more severe. One who was banned could not have his sons circumcised or their children married, their children and wives were expelled from the synagogue, and they were not to be buried with any honor. He was considered as a non-Jew; his <i>ẓiẓit</i> fringes, were cut off, his <i>mezuzah</i> removed from his door, his food proclaimed unfit for Jews, and his books considered trash. The <i>ḥerem</i> became actually, a civil death. The man was dead to the community.<br><i>Ḥerem</i> became more and more frequent as the punishment of excommunication by the Church increased. Jewish courts were influenced by civil courts of the land to impose <i>ḥerem</i> on Jews for monetary reasons, but the Jewish courts remained independent in religious matters. Rabbis became more and more reluctant to impose a <i>ḥerem</i> on an individual especially without the consent of the entire congregation due to the extreme hardship it imposed on the family of the isolated man. This caused the development of partial <i>ḥerem</i> which was less severe and only isolated the person in synagogue worship but not in daily life, for example. <i>Niddui</i> was then imposed for major offenses such as a man refusing to divorce his wife when it was felt that he should, a bridegroom refusing to marry his bride, or offenses such as theft or fraud.<br>Minor forms of <i>ḥerem</i>, <i>niddui</i> or <i>nezifah</i> were pronounced by the head of the rabbinical court, but a severe <i>ḥerem</i> was pronounced in the synagogue either before the open ark or while holding the Torah scroll. The proclaimation was made with the sounding of the <i>shofar</i>, the ram’s horn (see footnote 221). The people held candles and put them out symbolically when the excommunication was declared. Several Biblical verses were recited against the one excommunicated and people were warned against associating with the person put in <i>ḥerem</i>. The ceremony concluded with a prayer for the faithful of the congregation.<br>In later times the <i>niddui</i> and <i>ḥerem</i> became so frequent and common that it lost almost all of its significance and force. It became the standard rabbinic reaction to all forms of deviation from the norm of Orthodoxy. Although still pronounced they are no longer binding on the person involved or the community, nor do they carry the terror they once did.<br>Haim Hermann Cohn, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 8, pp. 344-55.</i>”, ban, that the living should not slander the dead.",
            "One may immerse (inaritual bath<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Mikveh</i>, <span dir=\"rtl\">מקוה</span>, is a pool or a bath of clear water. When a person immerses in it, it renders ritual cleanliness to one who has become ritually unclean through contact with the dead (Numbers 19) or any other defiling object, or through an unclean flux from the body (Leviticus 15), especially for a menstruant. The <i>mikveh</i> is also used to purify vessels (Numbers 31:22-23). Today the <i>mikveh</i> is used for the menstruant since the laws of ritual purity no longer apply due to the destruction of the Temple. A woman must immerse in the <i>mikveh</i> and purify herself following her menstruation in order to again participate in marital relations. It is also obligatory for proselytes to immerse as part of the ceremony for conversion. Many people still use the <i>mikveh</i> for spiritual purification and thus immerse in it on the eve of the Sabbath, festivals, and especially on the eve of the Day of Atonement. The mikveh serves to purify the spirit, not the body, as described by Maimonides. One has to have a mental intention to purify oneself by immersing in the <i>mikveh</i>.<br>According to Biblical law any collection of water whether drawn or collected naturally is suitable for a <i>mikveh</i> as long as one person can immerse himself, but the rabbis later stated that only water which has not been drawn, that is not collected in a vessel or recepticle, could be used. The rabbis also established a minimum for the amount of water to be used, that is the amount of water needed to fill a square cubit to the height of three cubits. This is between 250-1,000 liters depending on various calculations. If it contains at least this much undrawn water, any amount of drawn water can be added to it. A whole talmudic tractate <i>Mikva’ot</i>. is devoted to <i>mikvehs</i> and how they are to be constructed.<br>A <i>mikveh</i> cannot be prefabricated and just installed on a site since this makes it a vessel and constitutes water that has been drawn or collected. It may be built anywhere and out of any material that is water-tight. No water may leak from it, and it must contain the minimun of forty <i>se’ah</i> (250-1,000 liters) of valid, undrawn, water. Originally its height had to be one-hundred and twenty centimeters so one could stand and be totally immersed (even if bending was required). Later it was established that any height was valid if a person could be immersed laying down provided the minimum quantity of water was there.<br>All natural spring water provided it was not discolored by any admixtures is valid. Rain water or melted snow or ice is ideal for the <i>mikveh</i> provided that it flows unstopped into the <i>mikveh</i>. Pipes may be used to carry this water provided they touch the ground and are thus not considered vessels. A <i>mikveh</i> must be emptied by any means, even a pump, from above. No drain in the bottom is permitted as it makes the <i>mikveh</i> a vessel and subject to leakage. As long as the <i>mikveh</i> has contained at least forty <i>se’ah</i> of valid water, all water added to it, even drawn water is valid.<br>David Kotlar and Editorial Staff, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 11, pp. 1534-44.<br>A prayer is normally recited after the immersion called al <i>ha-tevilah</i>, “Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the Universe, who hast sanctified us by His commandments, and commanded us concerning the immersion”.</i>) and accept lashes<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lashes and <i>Malkkut Ar’ba’im</i>, <span dir=\"rtl\">מלקות ארבעים</span>, forty lashes is also known as flogging which is a Biblical form of punishment. When no other form of punishment was specifically prescribed, flogging became the standard form of punishment (Deuteronomy 25:2). Flogging was the only punishment in the Bible used as a general rule and not in relation to any particular offence except for the slandering of a virgin where the lashes as well as a fine were prescribed (Deuteronomy 22:18).<br>The maximum number of stripes to be administered in any one case are forty (Deuteronomy 25:3) for any further flogging the Bible stated, would degrade your brother in your eyes (Deuteronomy 25:3). The intent of the Bible seems to be that forty is the maximum number of stripes allowed, but that each offense and its seriousness could determine the number of stripes from one to forty provided the maximum number was not exceeded.<br>Talmudical law detailed how the Biblical punishment of flogging was to be administered. All the laws are found in the Talmudic tractate <i>Makkot</i>, <span dir=\"rtl\">מכות</span>. The rabbis altered the Biblical law of flogging reducing the number of the maximum number of stripes to ever be received from forty to thirty-nine (Mak. 22a) so as to avoid the danger that the flogger accidentally might exceed the number of forty lashes. If he were permitted to administer forty lashes, the flogger might have given an extra one before he could have been stopped thus administering forty-one lashes which exceeds the maximum number of lashes allowed by the Bible and disgracing the man in the eyes of his brothers and thus also would the flogger be made subject to flogging for his transgression. Therefore the rabbis ruled that the maximum number of stripes they would allow was thirty-nine, for even if the flogger made a mistake he could be stopped before he exceeded the maximum number of forty stripes even if he gave an extra one as he was being stopped. (This is the reason for the comment by Isserles to this law given by Caro, see footnote 55).<br>The rabbis carefully defined all the offenses for which flogging would serve as a punishment. The number thirty-nine became the maximum number of stripes for offenses for which flogging was administered. The rabbis though, were careful not to cause death by flogging which would have exceeded the Biblical law. Therefore all people to be flogged were first examined to see if they could physically withstand the punishment. The examiner would then determine the safe number of stripes to be inflicted (Mak. 3:11). Flogging would be stopped if it appeared during the stripes that the man could not take anymore (Mak. 17:5). Flogging could also be postponed a day until a person would be fit to under-go the punishment (Mak. 17:3).<br>Floggings were administered with a whip made of calfskin to the bare upper body of the offender. One-third of the lashes were given on the breast and the other two-thirds on the back. The one being flogged would stand in a bowed position and the flogger would stand on a stone above him. As the stripes were being given admonitory and consolatory verses from the Bible would be recited (Mak. 3:12-14). If death did result and the flogging had been conducted according to the law, the flogger was not liable. If though, he had not faithfully followed the law, he had to flee to a city of refuge which was the case in any accidental homocide.<br>Flogging for disciplinary reasons as well as for punishment for other than transgressing actively a prohibition of the Torah was also prescribed by the rabbis and this was usually done in a public place so as to be a deterrent to others to violate laws. Usually disciplinary stripes were given in lesser numbers (that is less than thirty-nine) and were not administered to the bare upper body nor were they given with a leather whip. As time passed, people were more often allowed to pay fines rather than be whipped and whipping all but replaced capital punishment in Israel.<br>On Yom Kippur a custom arose that after the <i>Minḥah</i> Afternoon Service, forty stripes (according to Caro, but only thirty-nine in Ashkenazi communities as pointed out by Isserles) were administered while the victim repeated the confession, <i>viddui</i> (see footnote 39). The one who administered the flogging was to say “And He (God) pities and will atone sins”, (Psalms 78:38). The purpose of this custom was to increase one’s awareness of his need for confession to atone for his sins. This was a visual and physical admission of sins and it was believed to help one receive complete atonement.<br>Haim Hermann Cohn, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 6, pp. 1348-51; Moshe David Herr, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 5, p. 1381.</i> (to effect atonement) whenever desired provided that it is before nightfall, but one does not bless over the immersion.<br><small><i>Hagah</i>: One needs to immerse one time without a confession because of pollution (urinary emmission).

It was highly accepted in Poland and Germany where it became the model for halakhic decisions by the scholars of that country who often differed from other codifiers. The <i>Magen</i> Avraham was written by Abraham Abele ben Ḥayyim ha-Levi Gombiner who lived from 1637 until 1683. He was of Polish birth but he moved to Lithuania after the death of his parents in Chmielnicki Massacres in 1648. After studying there with his relative Jacob Isaac Gombiner he moved to Kalisz where he was appointed head of the yeshivah and <i>dayyan</i>, judge, of the <i>bet din</i> rabbinical court.<br>Abraham’s commentary is evidence of his vast knowledge of halakhic material. The goal of his work, <i>Magen Avraham</i> was to provide a compromise between the decisions of Joseph Caro and the glosses of Moses Isserles. When no compromise could be arrived at Abraham usually sided with his fellow Ashkenazi, Isserles. Abraham felt that all Jewish customs were valid and sacred and he attempted to justify them even when there was a disagreement among the codifiers. Abraham highly regarded the Zohar and Kabbalists and he occasionally accepted their opinions over that of the codifiers.<br>Gombiner was also the author of a commentary on the <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> called <i>Zayit Ra’anan</i> and a collection of homilies on Genesis called <i>Shemen Sason</i> in addition to a short commentary of the <i>Tosefta</i> of <i>Nezikim</i>.<br>Shmuel Ashkenazi, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 7, pp. 766-67.</i>), this is also effective, (<span dir=\"ltr\">מהרי״ו וכל בו ותשב״צ</span>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Mahariv</i> and <i>Kol Bo</i> and <i>Tashbaẓ</i>, <span dir=\"rtl\">מהרי״ו וכל בו ותשב״ץ</span>.<br><i>Mahariv</i>, <span dir=\"rtl\">מהרי״ו</span>, see footnote 27.<br><i>Kol Bo</i>, <span dir=\"rtl\">כל בו</span>, which when translated means “everything within” is an anonymous work which contained both halakhic decisions and explanations of <i>halakhot</i> arranged according to subject matter. The book, <i>Kol Bo</i>, was written either at the end of the thirteenth century or at the beginning of the fourteenth century. The work is very similar to a commentary on <i>Oraḥ Ḥayyim</i> called <i>Orḥot Ḥayyim</i> written by Aaron b. Jacob ha-Kohen of Lunel and published in Florence in 1750-51. The fact that they were so similar and covered the same material except that the <i>Orḥot Ḥayyim</i> contained more material than did the <i>Kol Bo</i> caused some scholars to believe that the <i>Kol Bo</i> was a later abridgment to the <i>Orḥot Ḥayyim</i>. But this may not be true due to the differences in their arrangement, the <i>Orḥot Ḥayyim</i> being more systematic. There is another view that the <i>Kol Bo</i> was, the first edition to the <i>Orḥot Ḥayyim</i> and probably by the same author, Aaron b. Jacob ha-Kohen; the material in the <i>Kol Bo</i> certainly preceded that of the <i>Orḥot Ḥayyim</i>.<br>There are one-hundred and forty-eight sections to the <i>Kol Bo</i> which cover many subjects of Jewish ceremonial, ritual, civil, personal, and community life. The anthology includes collections of laws from numerous and varied halakhic works. The <i>Kol Bo</i> was basically patterned after the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> of Maimonides together with the additions of the scholars of Germany, France, and Provence. There were in addition a few rulings by Spanish scholars included. Many of the laws included in the <i>Kol Bo</i> are from books no longer in existence today. It is possible that the <i>Kol Bo</i> never had much original material, but was mainly an anthology of rules from various sources. The <i>Kol Bo</i> was first printed in Naples in 1490-91.<br>Shlomoh Zalman Havlin, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 10, pp. 1159-60.<br><i>Tashbaẓ</i>, <span dir=\"rtl\">תשב״ץ</span>, see footnote 20.</i> One who incurs a death between Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur, it is permissible to wash and to immerse on the Eve of Yom Kippur because Yom Kippur cancels the “<i>shiva</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shiva</i> is a seven day mourning period which begins immediately after the funeral. The mourners traditionally gather in the house of the deceased where they sit on low stools or over-turned couches with their heads enrobed. This is obligatory for close relatives of the deceased, be it husband or wife, mother or father, son or daughter, or brother or sister. The mourners must perform <i>keri’ah</i>, a rending of their garments as a symbol of mourning and they are required to recite the blessing <i>dayyan ha-emet</i> proclaiming God as the true judge. During the <i>shiva</i> period, mourners are not permitted to work physically, conduct financial transactions, bathe, annoint the body, cut the hair, cohabit, wear leather shoes, wash clothes, greet acquaintances, and study the Torah.

            "<b>“The order of confession (of sins)</b><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Viddui</i>, <span dir=\"rtl\">ודוי</span>, confession of sins, is a prerequisite for expiation and atonement in the Bible for sins committed individually or collectively. In the Bible there is usually a pardoning by God following the confession. Examples of this are found in the stories of Cain, (Genesis 4:13) David, (Psalms 32,41,51, and 69), Judah with Tamar (Genesis 36:26), Achan and the spoils of Jerico (Joshua 7:19-21), Saul and the Amalekite booty (I Samuel 15:24-25). There are also examples of Biblical confessions made for the nation; Moses and the golden calf worshipping (Exodus 32:31), the high priest’s confession on the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16:6, 11, 21) and the confession of Ezra (9:6, 7, 15) and Nehemiah (1:6,7;9:2,33-35).<br>Prior to the destruction of the Temple confessions had to precede special sin and guilt sacrificial offerings. The person confessing had to place his hands upon the head of the animal sacrifice to transfer his sins to the animal (Leviticus 1:4). The Bible gives no wording for these confessions but there is in the Mishna the wording for the confession of the high priest on Yom Kippur: “O God, I have committed iniquity, transgressed, and sinned before Thee, I and my house. O God forgive the iniquities and transgressions and sins which I have committed and transgressed and sinned before Thee I and my house as it is written in the Law of Thy servant Moses, ‘For on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins shall ye be clean before the Lord’” (Leviticus 16:30; Yoma 3:8).<br>In rabbinic times it became an accepted custom to confess one's sins before seeking atonement and the confession of sins became an integral part of the synagogue ritual. On the Day of Atonement it became a focal point of the service. According to the Talmud (Yoma 87b) the simple statement \"Truly, we have sinned\" is sufficient for confession, but elaborate formulas of confession have evolved. The <i>Ashamnu</i> \"We have incurred guilt\" is the prayer on Yom Kippur that is inserted into the fourth benediction of the reader's repetition of the <i>Amidah</i> (see footnote 43). The prayer consists of two parts, each of which contains an alphabetical listing of sins probably committed by people during the year for which they are seeking atonement on Yom Kippur. The first alphabetical confession is known as the <i>Viddui Katan</i>, the \"Small Confession\". The second part of the <i>Ashamnu</i> is known as the <i>Viddui Gadol</i>, the \"Great Confession\". It is also known as the <i>Al Ḥet</i> \"For the sin which I committed before Thee\" which is the statement that precedes each specified sin. These confessionals are first mentioned in geonic liturgy (see footnote 19). Additions to the enumerated sins have evolved to include all possible transgressions since a person might have unintentionally forgotten about a sin during the year which must be confessed in order to receive atonement. The sins are all confessed in the first person plural, \"we\", communally, thus a person may even confess a sin he is sure he did not commit.<br>In addition to Yom Kippur, the <i>Ashamnu</i> is also recited during the <i>Seliḥot</i> Services prior to Yom Kippur (see footnote 14). It is also recited in the <i>Minḥah</i> Afternoon Service on the Eve of Yom Kippur and ten times during the Day itself.<br>The <i>Ashamnu</i> is also included in the daily service of the Ḥasidic rite, and on Monday and Thursday it is recited by the Sephardi, Italian, and Yemenite communities.<br>The <i>viddui</i>, confession of sins, can also be said by individuals silently at appropriate occasions especially when one is about to die. The <i>viddui</i> said on the Day of Atonement in the singular has become acceptable as a death confessional. A bridegroom also recites this <i>viddui</i> in the singular during the <i>Minḥah</i> Service before his wedding, the wedding day being considered a day of judgment for the bride and groom.<br>Editorial Staff, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 5, pp. 878-80.</i> <b>during <i>Minḥah</i></b><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Minḥah</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">מנחה</span>, is the Afternoon Service which is one of the three daily services, the Morning Service being called the <i>Shaḥarit</i> (see footnote 17) and the Evening Service being called the <i>Arvit</i> or <i>Ma'ariv</i> Service (see footnote 144). The <i>Minḥah</i> Service possibly derives its name from the <i>minḥah</i> sacrificial offering performed at the Temple in Jerusalem in the afternoon. A lamb was sacrificed at the Temple at dusk. The <i>Minḥah</i> Service consists of the following parts: the <i>Ashrei</i> (Psalm 145 preceded by Psalms 84:5 and 144:15 and closed by Psalm 115:18); the <i>Amidah</i> (see footnote 17); the <i>Taḥanun</i> (see footnote 10); and it is concluded with the <i>Aleinu</i> (see footnote 17).<br>On the Sabbath and on fast days a portion of the Torah is read before the <i>Amidah</i> and in some rites portions dealing with daily sacrifices are read before the <i>Ashrei</i>. On Sabbaths part of the portion from the Torah of the coming week is read.<br>The <i>Minḥah</i> Prayer can begin any time after the sixth and one-half hour of the day, which mean any time after 12:30 P. M. If <i>Minḥah</i> is prayed at this time of the day it is called <i>Minḥah Gedolah</i> or the \"major\" <i>Minḥah</i>. If <i>Minḥah</i> is prayed after the nine and one-half hour, which means after 3:30 P. M., it is called <i>Minḥah Ketannah</i> or the \"minor\" <i>Minḥah</i>. The <i>Minḥah</i> Service must though be completed before the twelfth hour, that is, before sunset, (Ber. 4:1; Ber 26b-27a).<br>The Shulḥan Arukh, <i>Oraḥ Ḥayyim</i>, 324 states that one may pray both <i>Minḥah Gedolah</i> and <i>Minḥah Ketannah</i> provided that one is obligatory (<i>ḥovah</i>) and the other is a voluntary act (<i>reshut</i>). But this is only allowed for the extremely pious.<br>The third meal on the Sabbath, <i>Se'udah Shelishit</i> is usually eaten between the <i>Minḥah</i>, Afternoon Service, and the <i>Ma'ariv</i>, or Evening Service. It has become the custom during the daily service to wait and begin the <i>Minḥah</i> Service shortly before sunset, so that the congregation can wait a few moments and then not have to reassemble (for a third time, having also assembled in the morning for <i>Shaḥarit</i>) for the Evening, <i>Ma'ariv</i> Service which on Sabbaths and holidays can be recited immediately following the sunset. On weekdays, it can be recited even before sunset.<br>cf., Aaron Rothkoff, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 12, pp. 31-32.</i> <b>(the Afternoon Prayer) on the Eve of Yom Kippur” - Containing six paragraphs.</b><br>One needs to confess during <i>Minḥah</i> (the Afternoon Prayer) before the (last) meal before fasting.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Se'udah ha-Mafseket</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">סעודה המפסקת</span>, is the term given to the last meal which is eaten immediately prior to the fast of Yom Kippur and the fast of <i>Tishah be-Av</i>.

It is the term given to an individual in public synagogue worship who officiates as the reader or the cantor, <i>ḥazzan</i>, the one who chants the liturgy. The main function of the <i>sheli'aḥ ẓibbur</i> is to lead the congregation in communal worship by chanting (or reading) aloud certain prayers or parts of them. He also recites the doxology of calling the congregation to worship (<i>Barekhu</i>) and he repeats the <i>Amidah</i> (see footnote 17 and 43). He also recites most <i>Kaddish</i> (see footnote 177) prayers which is a prayer in praise of God, and he leads the congregation in responsive readings and hymns. The Shulḥan Arukh, <i>Oraḥ Ḥayyim</i>, 53:4-9 lists the qualifications of a <i>sheli'aḥ ẓibbur</i>. He must have humility, be acceptable to the congregation, know the rules of prayer, and the proper pronunciation of the Hebrew text, have an agreeable voice, be properly dressed, and have a beard. The beard however was later not required except on the High Holydays. Except for the recital of hymns and psalms (e.g., <i>pesukei de-zimra</i>, see footnote 17) the <i>sheli'aḥ ẓibbur</i> had to be a male past the age of bar mitzvah, thirteen years old.<br>c.f., Editorial Staff, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 14, pp. 1355-56.</i> says his (confessional) on Yom Kippur during the Silent Prayer,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ha-Tefillah</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">התפילה</span>, \"The Prayer\" is a synonym for the <i>Amidah</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">עמידה</span>, the Silent Prayer said standing which is recited individually during each of the daily services, the <i>Shaḥarit</i>, Morning Service (see footnote 17), <i>Minḥah</i>, Afternoon Service (see footnote 40), and the <i>Arvit</i> (or <i>Ma'ariv</i>), the Evening Service (see footnote 144). It is also recited for the <i>Musaf</i>, the Additional Service (see footnote 166) on the Sabbath and festivals, and on Yom Kippur for a fifth time during the <i>Ne'ilah</i>, the concluding prayer (see footnote 191). During a congregational prayer that is when there is a <i>minyan</i>, a quorum of at least ten adult males, the reader (see footnote 41) repeats the <i>Amidah</i> outloud and on festivals a number of additions are made. Originally the repetition was for the uneducated people who did not know the prayers. Upon hearing each blessing they could respond, \"Amen\" and thus fulfill their religious obligation of reciting the <i>Amidah</i>. The <i>Amidah</i> of <i>Arvit</i>, the Evening Service, was originally optional but it long ago became obligatory to recite it silently but it is not repeated outloud except on the Sabbath eve when an abbreviated version of it in one single benediction is recited.<br>The word Ha-Tefillah for this prayer originated in the Talmud where it was referred to as \"The Prayer\" <i>par excellence</i>. It is also known as the <i>Amidah</i> for it is said \"standing\" and as the <i>Shemoneh-Esreh</i> (18) for it originally had eighteen benedictions in the daily worship while today it contains ninteen.<br>The <i>Amidah</i> takes on various forms for different occasions. On weekdays there are ninteen benedictions, on fast days an additional benediction is added when the reader repeats the prayer, (in ancient times on some public fasts six prayers were added to the regular ones, Ta'an. 2:2-4). On Sabbaths and festivals there are only seven benedictions in the <i>Amidah</i> except for the <i>Musaf</i> Service (see footnote 166) on Rosh HaShanah where there are nine. All the various forms of the <i>Amidah</i> have six blessings in common, the first and last three, with the middle changing according to the occasion. The first three benedictions praise God and the last three basically express thanksgiving. On the weekdays the intermediate benedictions are petitions and the <i>Amidah</i> is therefore predominantly a prayer of supplication where praise, petition, and thanksgiving are included. In most of the benedictions the one praying addresses God as \"Thou\" for it is through the <i>Amidah</i> that one communicates with God. The pronoun, \"we\" is also used throughout the <i>Amidah</i> which indicates that it is to be a communal prayer. Even though at times it is said individually, the worshipper is considered a member of the congregation. On Sabbaths and on festivals the central prayer concerns the specialness of the day or one aspect of that part of the day (that is, morning, afternoon, or evening on the Sabbath), and there is no petition, only praise, the special blessing of the day, and thanksgiving.<br>On the Day of Atonement the central blessing called <i>Kedushat ha-Yom</i>, the sanctification of the day, is concluded specially as follows: \"<i>Barukh</i>…<i>Melekh moḥel ve-sole'aḥ le-avonoteinu</i>…<i>mekaddesh Yisrael ve-Yom ha-Kippurim</i>,\" \"Blessed…King who pardons and forgives our iniquities…who sanctifies Israel and the Day of Atonement\". On Yom Kippur also the third blessing (of the first three standard blessings of praise) is elaborated to contain the prayer \"<i>u-Vekhen Ten Paḥekha</i>\", \"Now therefore impose Thy awe\", which is an ancient petition for the eschatological Kingdom of God. On the Day of Atonement the silent recital of the <i>Amidah</i> is followed by the <i>viddui</i>, a confession of sins (see footnote 39) which is not written as a benediction. When the reader repeats the <i>Amidah</i> the <i>viddui</i> is inserted into the fourth, the central, benediction. Two confessions are recited, one short and one long which are both arranged in alphabetical order. The sins which every person might have committed during the year are included and enumerated upon. Since this prayer is part of community worship, the pronoun \"we\" is used, \"we have transgressed, etc.\" (see also footnote 17).<br>Joseph Heinemann, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 2, pp. 838-45.</i> (<span dir=\"ltr\">טור</span>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tur</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">טור</span>, see footnote 23.</i></small>",
            "There is no need to itemize (to detail) (the description of) the sin, but if one wants to detail it<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44a</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The following comment is found in <i>Magen Avraham</i>, (see footnote 33): 607:2 - \"And if one wants to detail (one's sins)…\": This means that we speak (that he may confess his sins) even outloud, and it seems to me that this is so only if the sin is commonly known but a sin which is not common knowledge, in everyone's opinion it is forbidden to say it outloud, as it is written, \"Happy is the one whose transgression is forgiven…\" (Psalms 32:1), (and this is what is written in a <i>Hagah</i>, note). Certainly the <i>Amoraim</i> did not oppose the <i>Tannaim</i> as it is written in Sotah 32, that they ordained the prayer to a wisper so as not to embarrass the transgressors who are confessing about their sins, but rather R. Judah b. Baba decided that before God there was no need to detail (one's sins), and in this there is no difference whether the sin is publically known or not because all is revealed before Him (God), see in the <i>Gemara</i> and in <i>Bayit Ḥadash</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">ב״ח</span>, (see footnote 20b.) that it is not according to the <i>Beit Yosef</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">ב״י</span>, (see footnote 20.)

It is written in scripture \"Happy is the one whose transgression is forgiven whose sin is covered,\" (Psalms 32:1), and the sin was an unintentional one.</i> he has the permission to do so, but if one confesses silently (i.e., just moving one’s lips but not speaking audibly), it is appropriate to detail the sin.<br><small><i>Hagah</i>: But when one prays outloud or the reader, when he repeats the prayer, they do not detail the sin.

The <i>Al Ḥet</i> is also known as the <i>Viddui Gadol</i>, the \"Great Confession\". It is an alphabetical listing of all possible sins which one may have committed during the year. Each sin is preceded by the statement <i>Al Ḥet</i>, \"For the sin which we have committed before Thee\" and then the sin is enumerated. The sins are all confessed in the first person plural \"we\" so that every person can confess all possible sins, even those he may have forgotten, or those he surely did not commit, together with the whole congregation so as not to overlook a sin which requires specific confession to achieve atonement. The <i>Al Ḥet</i> is found along with the <i>Viddui Katan</i>, the Small Confession, which is also an alphabetical listing of sins and precedes the <i>Al Ḥet</i> in the <i>Ashamnu</i>. The <i>Ashamnu</i> is recited by the reader in his repetition of the <i>Amidah</i> (see footnote 43) during the <i>Minḥah</i>, Afternoon Service, on the Eve of Yom Kippur and in every repetition of the <i>Amidah</i> on the Day itself, except that of the <i>Ne'ilah</i>, Concluding Service, (see footnote 191). It is included in the fourth, the central, benediction; (see also footnote 39).<br>In the alphabetical listing of the sins in the <i>Al Ḥet</i>, two sins are included under each letter. Each line begins the same: \"For the sin we have sinned before Thee…\" There are a total of forty-four sins (two for each of the twenty-two Hebrew letters) in alphabetical order. Another nine lines are included to enumerate sins according to their prescribed punishments. The recitation is divided into four parts. After each part the following formula is recited: \"And for all these, O God of forgiveness, forgive us, pardon us, grant us atonement.\" This is chanted during the reader's repetition of the <i>Amidah</i>. In the list of sins, there are specific as well as general sins stated to cover any unknown transgressions. Sins of a ritual nature are not included. The \"we\" represents collective responsibility that every member of a community should feel. The author of the <i>Al Ḥet</i> is unknown.<br>The Sephardi ritual has only one sin per letter and in some communities the order of the letters is reversed. The Yemenites use a shortened version.

He lived from around 1310 until approximately 1375. He was one of the most important Spanish talmudists. Nissim was born in Gerona but settled in Barcelona. He never held any official rabbinical office but he functioned as a rabbi and a judge, a <i>dayyan</i>, in his community. Many of the <i>takkanot</i>, the ordinances supplementing the law, which were enacted in Spain originated with Rabbenu Nissim. He was considered an authoritative <i>posek</i>, halakhic decision maker, and he received questions on Jewish law from Ereẓ Israel and Syria as well as from his own community. His main teacher was Perez ha-Kohen. Rabbenu Nissim served mainly as the head of the yeshivah in Barcelona.<br>Nissim wrote many halakhic works. The method and system he followed was established basically by Naḥmanides, Solomon b. Abraham Adret, Aaron ha-Levi of Barcelona, and their contemporaries although in his decisions, Nissim did not name the scholars whose sayings he quoted. He also added much of his own thought to the material he received from others. One of Nissim's main works was his commentary on the <i>halakhot</i> of Isaac Alfasi, a code based on the Talmud. His work is included in the margins of Alfasi's commentary in all printed versions of this work. This commentary is found with the following tractates (the section quoted by Isserles in this footnote is included): <i>Shabbat</i>, <i>Pesaḥim</i>, <i>Beẓah</i>, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i>, <i>Yoma</i>, <i>Ta'anit</i>, <i>Megillah</i>, <i>Sukkah</i>, <i>Ketubbot</i>, <i>Gittin</i>, <i>Kiddushin</i>, <i>Shevu'ot</i>, <i>Avodah Zarah</i>, <i>Ḥullin</i>, and <i>Niddah</i>. Nissim also wrote novellae to parts of the Talmud. The commentary that Rabbenu Nissim wrote to the Talmud tractate <i>Nedarim</i> is his best known work and his commentary has become the standard one instead of that by Rashi. Some of the commentaries attributed to Nissim might not be his, as the acronym, RaN, was used by many. Only a few of Nissim's responsa are still in existence along with a collection of twelve sermons and a commentary to the Pentateuch where he wanted to prove the superiority of prophecy and the Bible over philosophy. This was to give people strength and faith during difficult periods of persecution. Nissim also wrote <i>piyyutim</i>, liturgical poems, (see footnote 149).<br>Leon A.

He is also known as Maimonides. This twelfth century intellectual is one of the most famous Jewish philosophers, halakhists, and writers of all times in addition to being a famous physician. His most famous work is called the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> which means \"The Repetition of the Law\" or a second Torah. It is a code of Jewish law. Maimonides wanted to collect and organize Jewish law so it could be easily found and understood by people not as well versed as he was in the law. Maimonides' goal was to concentrate all of Jewish law from the Written Law until his time in a scientific and systematic way. His knowledge of and commentaries on halakhic material was phenomenally extensive. He wanted to subdivide and classify all of Jewish law according to subject matter which had not been done since the Mishna of Judah ha-Nasi. He divided his work into fourteen books (the letters, <span class=\"rtl\">י״ד</span>, equal fourteen and therefore the alternate name for his work is <i>ha-Yad ha-Hazakah</i>, \"The Strong Hand\"). Each book has eighty-three further divisions called <i>halakhot</i>, the construct form being <i>hilkhot</i> (the reference made by Isserles in this footnote is to one of these divisions called <i>Hilkhot Shegagot</i>), these parts were further divided into one thousand chapters, <i>perakim</i>, made up of some fifteen thousand paragraphs, each called a <i>halakhah</i>. Maimonides gave a single halakhic rule in his work in clear, legal Hebrew without stating different opinions or the sources for his decisions except when they originated in the Torah. For this he is criticized. (For a further explanation of Maimonides and the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> as part of the whole of codification literature, see the introduction to this thesis.)<br>Maimonides' work as a halakhist was not limited to the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, although that is his most famous legal work. He wrote commentaries to some tractates of the Talmud, and mention is also made to his commentaries on the Palestinian Talmud as well as the Mishna. His <i>Mishneh Torah</i> contains the whole of Jewish law, both practical and theoretical. Maimonides also wrote responsa where we learn of the life of the Jewish community in Egypt and its neighboring countries during his lifetime. There are 464 responsa of Maimonides in Hebrew and Arabic. Many of his decisions became the accepted <i>halakhah</i>. Another famous work of Maimonides is his <i>Sefer ha-Mitzvot</i>, the \"Book of the Commandments\". In this halakhic work Maimonides decided to arrange the traditional 613 commandments in a new way. He gave his own enumeration of the 248 positive and the 365 negative commandments. The book, originally written in Arabic and translated into Hebrew by Moses ibn Tibbon, received much criticism for the methodology employed, but it later became an accepted work. The <i>Sefer ha-Mitzvot</i> served as an introduction to the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> which he worked on for ten years. Although the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> is an halakhic work, and even though Maimonides' philosophic work, <i>The Guide of the Perplexed</i>, was written after the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the Rambam still managed to include philosophic ideas in his code. Maimonides felt that philosophy and science are handmaidens to theology. Mainmonides in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> included a system of metaphysics (Book One), the astronomical calculations for the calendar (Book Three), and the doctrine of the Messiah and a refutation of Christianity, Islam and their founders (Book Fourteen).<br>Even though the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> received much criticism by the contemporary scholars of Maimonides because it was such a novel way or arranging <i>halakhah</i>, since it did not give all the sources, and because it was feared that students would use it and no longer study the original talmudical sources, the book became one of the most creative sources of <i>halakhah</i> in all Jewish literature.<br>Jacob I.

The tractate deals with the laws of festivals, especially those laws common to all festivals in general. This tractate is therefore also called <i>Yom Tov</i>, \"festival\". The tractate contains five chapters in the Mishna and Talmud but only four in the Tosefta.<br>Zvi Kaplan, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 4, pp. 785-86.<br>The Rosh, (Ha-Rosh), is an acronym for <i>R</i>abbenu A<i>sh</i>er. He is also known as Asheri. His real name is Asher ben Jehiel and he lived from around 1250 until 1327. This famous talmudist studied under his father, Jehiel, one of the Ḥasidei Ashkenaz and his older brother. He lived for a short while in Troyes, France and then lived in Cologne and Coblenz. From there he moved to Worms and studied under Meir b. Baruch of Rothenburg who appointed Asher as a member of the local rabbinic court, <i>bet din</i>. When Meir was imprisoned, Asher became the leader of German Jewry. During the Rindfleisch massacres of 1298 Asher distinguished himself by giving respected halakhic decisions which were raised due to the disruption of family and communal life.<br>Asher left Germany in 1303 and went to Barcelona. He was a colleague of Solomon b. Abraham Adret and in 1305 became the rabbi of Toledo. Asher fought for a long time the study of philosophy which had become popular. His dislike of philosophy was the result of what he saw on his move through different countries to Toledo. He saw that people were abandoning the study of Torah for the study of philosophy. He enacted a ban against the study of philosophy and against those practices which resulted from Christian influences.<br>The responsa of the Rosh reflect both the modesty and humility of Spanish scholars. Asher had a great deal to do with meshing German <i>minhag</i>, custom, with Spanish <i>halakhah</i>, law. Asher, an outstanding halakhic authority, thereby gave authority to the French and German codifiers. Rabbenu Asher was not afraid to disagree with the <i>rishonim</i> (early authorities, see footnote 16) or the <i>geonim</i> (see footnote 19) when the talmudic source disagreed with them. Asher was known to be lenient in matters not specifically forbidden in the Torah if it was for the sake of peace, but he was strict against developments that harmed communal life.<br>Asher wrote the following halakhic works: <i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i> (known also as <i>Hilkhot ha-Rosh</i> and <i>Sefer ha-Ashrei</i>), a work modeled after Alfasi. He summed up decisions of earlier codifiers and it covered most of the Talmud tractates; a collection of responsa, which was published in Constantinople in 1517, contains over one thousand responsa in one hundred, eight chapters. These responsa give a picture of what German and Spanish life was like during his time; commentaries on the <i>Mishnayot</i> to the orders of <i>Zera'im</i> and <i>Tohorot</i>; <i>Tosafot</i> which is basically what he taught at the yeshivah and covered virtually all the tractes of the Babylonian Talmud. (See the introduction to this thesis for a placing of Asher b. Jehiel and his work among the other codifiers of Jewish law.)<br><i>Encyclopaedia Hebraica</i>, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 3, pp. 706-08.<br><i>Sefer ha-Ittur</i> was written by Isaac ben Abba Mari of Marseilles who lived from approximately 1120 to approximately 1190. He was a rabbinic scholar in Provence and Spain who studied under his father Abba Mari b. Isaac. He later went to Barcelona as an honored and respected halakhic authority. He wrote a number of halakhic commentaries but he is best known for his <i>Sefer ha-Ittur</i> which is an encyclopedic work of the main halakhic laws which are of practical application. The first part deals with financial and divorce bills. It is arranged according to subject matter but following a mnemonic acrostic <i>Tashkef be-Geza Ḥokhmah</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">תשקף בגזע חכמה</span>, \"Consider the Root of Wisdom\". Each letter represents a certain concept. \"<span class=\"rtl\">ת</span>\" stands for <i>tenai</i>, \"condition\", \"<span class=\"rtl\">ש</span>\" for <i>shover</i>, \"receipt\", and \"<span class=\"rtl\">ק</span>\" for <i>kiyyum</i>, \"authentication\", etc. The second part includes laws for the preparation of meat, <i>sheḥitah</i> (animal slaughter for food), circumcision, tefillin (prayer phylacteries), marriage benedictions, <i>ẓiẓit</i> (prayer shawl), and a separate section entitled \"Ten Commandments\" which contains ten positive commandments which must be performed at specific times. This arrangement is unique to halakhic literature. Isaac b. Abba Mari used a vast knowledge of <i>geonic</i> (see footnote 19) literature in his work as well as decisions of scholars from Spain, Germany, and northern France. He made great use of the Jerusalem Talmud. <i>Sefer ha-Ittur</i> became an authoritative halakhic work for rabbinic authorities of Spain and Germany. Naḥmanides often made use of it.<br>Editorial Staff, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 9, pp. 12-13.</i> But if one knows that his words would not be listened to he should not say publically that they (the women) should be admonished except once.

Even though a transgressor may be punished by <i>karet</i>, he is still liable for any civil claims that may have arisen from his actions (Ket. 30a).<br>It was believed that natural death took place after sixty and if one died before that or one's life span was in any way curtailed this was considered \"death by the hand of heaven\" even though it had no fixed time. There was also discussion regarding the speed of death. Death in one, two, or three days before the age of sixty, or for those committing a transgression after the age of sixty was considered a sign of <i>karet</i>.<br>The medieval scholars who were very concerned with reward and punishment decided that a death from <i>karet</i> meant the absolute end, the maximal punishment, while ordinary sinners after being punished in Gehinnom, lived again in the world to come, a world not shared by those punished with <i>karet</i>. This was the view of Maimonides while Naḥmanides felt that those who died by <i>karet</i> continued to suffer in the world to come since the soul can never be annihilated and perish. <i>Karet</i> was degradation of the soul and the negation of spiritual pleasures awaiting the souls of the righteous.<br>Israel Moses Ta-Shma, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 10, pp. 788-89.</i> except for working, eating, and drinking.",
            "All (types of) work (for whose transgression) a person is guilty on the Sabbath is also guilty on Yom Kippur. And all types of work for whose transgression on the Sabbath a person is free from punishment but are still prohibited, are also prohibited on Yom Kippur in a like manner except that on the Sabbath a conscious sin is punishable by stoning,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">79</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Stoning, <i>sekilah</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">סקילה</span>, is a Biblical form of capital punishment which was the standard penalty for crime in all ancient civilizations. In the Torah there are two explicit methods of executing a criminal or a sinner; stoning and burning. According to the Talmud, the Torah has four methods of execution: stoning, burning, beheading, and strangling, (See B. Sanhedrin 49b., ff).<br>Stoning was an instinctive violent expression of popular wrath, (Exodus 17:4, 8:22; Numbers 14:10; I Samuel 30:6; I Kings 12:18; II Chronicles 10:18) and often in the Bible it is the prescribed mode of execution (Leviticus 20:2, 27, 24:16; Numbers 15:35; Deuteronomy 13:11, 17:5, 21:21, 22:21, et al). Originally, the whole community participated in the stoning and were required to throw stones at the guilty person. Stonings were probably the standard form of judicial execution in Biblical times, (Leviticus 24:23; Numbers 15:36; I Kings 21:13; II Chronicles 24:21).<br>The Mishna (Sanh.6:4) states that a \"stoning place\" was established where instead of a person being pelted by stones, the convicted person would be pushed down from a high place to his death provided it was not too high so as to mutilate the body which was a concern of the rabbis. It also was not to be too low so the death would be instantaneous. The reason for the stoning place was that the scriptural rule states \"The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death,\" (Deuteronomy 17:7) and then afterwards the \"hand of all the people (should be on him)\", (Deuteronomy 17:7). To insure that the witnesses put him to death they were the ones to push him and thereby be first to put him to death. Thus this method of \"stoning\" became acceptable as opposed to the actual throwing of stones. This also seemed the more \"humane\" way of carrying out capital punishment as the convicted person died more quickly and the danger of mutilation was reduced. In Maimonides' comment to Sanhedrin 6:4 he stated that it really made no difference if stones were thrown at one or if one were thrown at stones.<br>cf., Haim Hermann Cohn, v. 5, pp. 142-43.</i> but on Yom Kippur it is punishable by <i>karet</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Karet</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">כרת</span>; see footnote 78.</i> Everything that is forbidden to be moved (or handled) on the Sabbath is also forbidden to be moved (or handled) on Yom Kippur, (but it is permitted to clean vegetables and to open (shell) nuts from the <i>Minḥah</i> time<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">81</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Minḥah</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">מנחה</span>, a time designating afternoon, meaning after the six and one half hour or after 12:30 P.M. according to our present day time system.

The language of the <i>Agudah</i> is very concise and it is evident that it was written quickly under the threat of the persecutions of the time since Suslin died a martyr's death in Erfurt.

This German talmudic scholar was born Erfurt where he taught, as well as in Worms, Cologne, and Frankfort.<br>The <i>Agudah</i>, Suslin's most famous work, gives halakhic rulings in concise form and it ignores differences of opinion.

He was one of the foremost Jewish scholars of his day and he was a member of a well-to-do family in Barcelona where he lived all his life. He studied principlely under Jonah b. Abraham Gerondi and also under Naḥmanides. After a short career in business he became a rabbi in Barcelona for over forty years. He quickly became a well respected authority among Spanish Jewry and beyond. Adret gave responsa to questions addressed to him from all over the Jewish world. His responsa were gathered into collections and served as sources of guidance. He had the ability to simplify and clarify difficult material, and he wrote over one thousand responsa. His responsa serve as a picture of the type of life around his time both for Jews and non-Jews because of his knowledge of Roman law and local Spanish legal practice. Adret knew philosophy and science but was fearful to let the masses study it and not the Torah. He therefore placed a ban on secular studies for Jews. He criticized the influence of mysticism in Judaism and the allegorical method of interpreting the Bible which was popular in southern France and Spain. Adret also defended Judaism against non-Jewish challengers.<br>In addition to his numerous responsa Adret headed a yeshivah to which students flocked from as far away as Germany. Adret wrote novellae to seventeen tractates of the Talmud that made up his academy lectures. Adret commented on <i>aggadot</i> (non-legal material) in the Talmud and he wrote a special work on the subject called <i>Ḥiddushei Aggadot ha-Shas</i>, published in Tel Aviv in 1966. Adret also wrote two legal manuals. <i>Torat ha-Bayit</i> deals with most ritual observances such as ritual slaughter of animals for food, forbidden foods, gentile wines, and laws of <i>niddah</i>. It was published in Venice in 1607. The second and lesser work is called <i>Sha'ar ha-Mayim</i>, which contains the laws of the <i>mikveh</i>, (see footnote 30) first published in Budapest in 1930. These two sections which comprise one book are divided into seven parts which contain detailed halakhic discussions. Adret decided between opposing views and added his own opinion. As a practical guide Asher wrote a shorter version which he called <i>Torat ha-Bayit ha-Kaẓer</i>, published in 1556 in Cremona. Adret wrote a code on the laws of the Sabbath and festivals called <i>Avodat ha-Kodesh</i> and one on the laws relating to <i>ḥallah</i> called <i>Piskei Ḥallah</i> published in Constantinople in 1516.<br>The responsa of Adret had great influence and were a major source used by Caro in his compilation of the Shulḥan Arukh.<br>Simha Assaf and Editorial Staff, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 2, pp. 305-08.</i>",

It was written by Moses ben Jacob of Coucy, a thirteenth century French scholar and tosafist. Moses of Coucy was the first French Jew to serve as an itinerant preacher, who wandered from town to town and from country to country trying to inspire Jews to renew their faith in God. He began his work in Spain in 1236 apparently after he received some mystical revelation. He excited people to renew their following of the commandments of <i>tefillin</i> (prayer phylacteries), <i>mezuzah</i> (<i>Shema</i> prayers placed on the doorpost), and <i>ẓiẓit</i> (garment fringes) which they had been lax in observing. He also spoke against a practice that had become common among Jews of Spain, having sexual relations with Gentile women. He stressed the value of the study of Torah and all positive commandments which had declined in Spain along with the allegorization of the Bible as a result of the philisophic writings of Maimonides which had become popular in the thirteenth century. Because of his vast sermonizing he received the name of Moses ha-Darshan, Moses the Sermonizer.<br>The SeMaG, <i>Sefer Mitzvot Gadol</i>, is Moses of Coucy's most extensive and important work, and it was first published before 1480 probably in Rome and again in Italy in 1547. The work is unique among the rabbinic writings of the period because of its style and arrangement. It contains the essence of the Oral Law, and it is arranged in order of the precepts divided into two parts, the positive and the negative precepts. Coucy based his work on the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> of Maimonides (see footnote 59) and he quoted from it directly on almost every page. He basically added to the words of Maimonides using as his source the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds as well as many <i>midrashim</i>, halakhic and aggadic commentaries on the Bible. He also employed the works of French and German <i>rishonim</i>, early scholars (see footnote 16). Coucy changed the language of the <i>midrashim</i> to fit in with the style of Maimonides. The order to the SeMaG is different than that of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> and even different than Maimonides' <i>Sefer ha-Mitzvot</i> (see footnote 59) which also lists the 613 commandments in positive and negative precepts because Coucy was not familiar with this work by Maimonides. At the end of his book Coucy included rabbinic precepts so as to instruct the people in the way of the Lord, which had been his original aim. To reach this aim, Coucy also separated those precepts which had practical value from those which were no longer applicable. The work of Moses of Coucy, because of his travels in Spain and his discovery of the works of Maimonides, helped bring Maimonides to the awareness of the French Jewish community. It is ironic that the allegorization of the Bible that Moses of Coucy fought so hard against was the result of the philosophy of Maimonides whom, as a halakhist, Moses of Coucy respected so much.<br>Moses of Coucy employed the following style in <i>Sefer Mitzvot Gadol</i>: he began with a scriptural verse touching on the subject, he then sighted interpretations of the verse found in the Talmuds and the halakhic <i>midrashim</i>. He then gave explanations based on commentators and halakhic scholars, and finally he summarized the <i>halakhah</i>. He weaved into the discussions aggadic and homiletic aspects, many of which were his own creation that displayed a love of God and his fellow man. The SeMaG became quite a popular and well known work among Jewish scholars for many generations. Isaac of Corbeil who had the title of \"Head of the Yeshivot of France\" compiled a book that was completely dependent on the SeMaG and he called it <i>Sefer Mitzvot Katan</i>, SeMaK, (see footnote 27), and he made it compulsory daily learning for every Jew. The SeMaG was the most accepted halakhic code among Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jewry until its position was taken over by the Shulḥan Arukh. (For an explanation of the SeMaG and how it fits into the entire picture of codification literature, see the introduction to this thesis).<br>Israel Moses Ta-Shma, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 12, pp. 418-20.<br>The <i>Tur</i>, on the laws concerning the Ninth Day of the month of Av, <span class=\"rtl\">טור הלכות ט״ב</span>.<br><i>Tishah Be-Av</i> is a fast day which commemorates the destruction of both the first Temple (586 B. C. E.) by the Babylonians and the second Temple (70 C. E.) by the Romans in Jerusalem which traditionally occurred on this date, (M. Ta'anit 4:6). (Actually records show that the major destruction of both Temples was on the tenth of <i>Av</i> but the Talmud proclaimed the Ninth Day of <i>Av</i> as the official day of mourning). It is a national day of mourning for the Jewish people. The rules regarding washing one's feet only if they are dirty (for cleansing purposes) are the same on <i>Tisha Be-Av</i> as they are on Yom Kippur.<br>The Mishna, <i>loc</i>. <i>cit</i>., also points out other calamities that befell the Jewish people on the Ninth Day of <i>Av</i>. It was on that day that the children of Israel were told they could not enter the Promised Land following their exodus from Egypt. On the Ninth of <i>Av</i> Bethar, the last stronghold of the leaders of the Bar Kokhba revolt was captured in 135 C.E. and exactly one year later the Roman Emperor, Hadrian, established a heathen temple on the site of the Temple in Jerusalem and made the city a pagan city which the Jews were not permitted to enter. The Jews later were expelled from Spain in 1492 on <i>Tishah be-Av</i>. This day then became a symbol for the persecutions and misfortunes of the Jews throughout history.<br>Fasting on the Ninth Day of <i>Av</i> as a day of mourning might have even been in practice during the second Temple period, and it was certainly part of the Jewish life in mishnaic times. It is a fast like Yom Kippur, from sunset to sunset.<br>In some places it is customary to eat a boiled egg during the last meal before <i>Tishah be-Av</i> sprinkled with ashes to symbolize mourning. No meat or wine is to be included prior to the fast. It is a day of national fasting and mourning. The laws of fasting are very similar to those of Yom Kippur and the laws of mourning parallel those that apply to one who has just lost a close relative after the burial. Lamentations are read as part of the Evening Service. While studying is prohibited, the Book of Job, curses in Leviticus (26:14-42) Jeremiah 39, and stories in the Talmud on the destruction of Jerusalem (Git. 55b-58a) may be read.<br>Supposedly <i>Tishah be-Av</i> will eventually again become a day of joy as the Messiah is to be born on this day.<br>Meir Ydit, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 3, pp. 936-40.<br>For thr <i>Tur</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">טור</span>; see footnote 23.</i></small>",

There is not total agreement on what the exact time demarkation is for the <i>Soferim</i>, but some say that the era of the <i>soferim</i> of the Talmud began with the time of Ezra and continued until the time of Simeon the Just who was the last of the men of the Great Synagogue. The names of all these scribes are not known but they were active during the Persian rule and they laid the foundations for the Oral Law. They placed restrictions on the people socially and religiously. They also interpreted the Torah and explained it to the people. They taught <i>halakhot</i> and established new ones through their study of and interpretation of the Bible. Through the teachings of the <i>Soferim</i>, the Torah was no longer just the book of the priests and levites, but scholars could arise then from any class.<br>The words <i>divrei soferim</i> come from the Talmud, Sanhedrin 88b where these scribes were considered scholars of the Torah for they would count (<i>sofer</i> from the same root as scribe) all the letters in the Torah and were therefore meticulous with the text of the Bible and its transmission.<br>Other scholars (Kaufmann, <i>Toledot ha-Emunah ha-Yisre'elit</i> volume 4, part 1, 276ff. and 481 ff.) argue that there is no evidence in the Talmud for an era of <i>soferim</i>, and there is no talmudic tradition which attributes any <i>halakhot</i> to this period. The Talmud does mention regulations by Ezra and the men of the Great Synagogue, but it does not attribute any decrees or <i>halakhot</i> to scribes between Ezra and the tannaitic period. The word <i>sofer</i> in various eras meant Torah scholars and those who copied Torah scrolls. The meaning of the term <i>sofer</i> has varied over the years. Sometimes it meant scholars and other times simply a scribe. Occasionally <i>soferim</i> was a term applied to those who taught the Bible.<br>In talmudic sources the expression \"<i>divrei soferim</i>\", \"the words of the scribes\" always refers to statements of earlier scholars of the Oral Law and it can just as easily apply to Moses as it does to those of the generation immediately preceding the compilation of the Mishna.

He lived from around 1180 until approximately 1250. He was born in Bohemia and in his wanderings he came into contact with many German and French scholars. He studied under some of the greatest men of his age and was highly influenced by such men as Simḥah b. Samuel of Speryer, Eliezar b. Joel ha-Levi, and Judah b. Isaac Sir Leon of Paris.<br>The <i>Or Zaru'a</i> is a most extensive work and because of its size it was not extensively copied nor circulated. The first two parts of the work were not published until 1862 before which it remained in manuscript form. The first part of the <i>Or Zaru'a</i> deals with blessings, the laws connected with the land of Israel, <i>niddah</i> (the laws of menstruation), <i>mikva'ot</i> (see footnote 30), laws of marriage, and finally a collection of responsa. The second part of the <i>Or Zaru'a</i> basically covers the material covered in the <i>Oraḥ Ḥayyim</i> section of the Shulḥan Arukh. Other sections published later (1887-90) contain halakhic rulings derived from the talmudic tractates <i>Bava Kamma</i>, <i>Bava Meẓia</i>, <i>Bava Batra</i>, <i>Sanhedrin</i>, <i>Avodah Zarah</i>, and <i>Shevu'ot</i>.<br>An abridgment of the work was written by Isaac's son, Ḥayyim b.

The work gives a systematic and comprehensive summary of all the laws in the Talmud. It basically follows the order of the tractates except it will group several <i>halakhot</i> having to do with the same subject even though they are scattered throughout the books. <i>Halakhot Gedolot</i> works the opposite way of the Talmud. It first states the general principle and then it gives the details. <i>Halakhot Gedolot</i> gave new names to laws no longer in existence because of the destruction of the Temple. It based its decisions on those found in the Talmud and on principles laid down by the sages. Most of the book is based on the Babylonian Talmud but reference is made to the \"Talmud of the West\", that is the Jerusalem Talmud. There are many responsa of Babylonian <i>geonim</i> and the book was widely known.<br>The book has an introduction which was a totally new feature at that time. It stated that the work was against the Karaites and others who rejected the Oral Law. It is in two parts. The first part has aggadic statements which praise the Torah and its students, and the second part enumerates the 613 commandments mentioned in the Talmud (Mak 23b) for the first time. They are listed according to the degree of punishment one receives for violating them which is their common character.<br>There is no agreement on who wrote <i>Halakhot Gedolot</i>. It has been attributed to Sherira Gaon, Simeon Kayyara (Spain and Provence), and Yehudai Gaon (northern France and Germany). Some scholars say that it was originally two parts which later were combined. The original <i>Halakhot Gedolot</i> they say was written by Simeon Kayyara and the extra was written by Yehudai Gaon in his <i>Halakhot Pesukot</i>. Yehudai Gaon used Aramaic and used the word for a legal decision, <i>pesak</i>, in his sections.<br>Other scholars say the whole work was written by Simeon Kayyara who lived at the beginning of the tenth century, one hundred and fifty years after Yehudai Gaon and that the <i>Halakhot Pesukot</i> was used as a source as was Aḥa of Shabḥa'a <i>She'eltot</i> for the <i>Halakhot Gedolot</i>. The second recension then supposedly came out in 900, seventy-five years after the first one.<br>Simeon Kayyara came from Boziah in Babylonia according to Hai Gaon. The city is mentioned twice in the work, and the city was under the influence of the Gaonate in Sura.<br>Yehoshua Horowitz, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 7, pp. 1167-70.<br><i>Sefer ha-Roke'aḥ</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">ספר הרוקח</span>, was written by Eleazar ben Judah of Worms who lived from approximately 1165 until around 1230. He was a scholar in the fields of <i>halakhah</i>, theology and biblical exegesis in medieval Germany. He was the last great scholar of the movement known as Ḥasidei Ashkenaz. He was born in Mainz but traveled and studied all over Germany and northern France until he settled and spent most of his life in Worms. Eleazar studied <i>halakhah</i> with R. Moses ha-Kohen, R. Eliezar of Metz, and his father Judah b. Kalonymus. He studied esoteric theology with his father and with Judah b. Samuel, he-Ḥasid. Eleazar witnessed much persecution of Jews at the hands of the Crusades at the end of the twelfth and the beginning of the thirteenth century. His wife, daughter and son were killed in one of these persecutions and he was badly injured. He wrote a book, <i>Sefer ha-Ḥokhmah</i>, the \"Book of Wisdom\" in 1217 where he felt compelled to put his knowledge into writing since he felt that oral tradition was dieing out in Germany as the situation of Jews there got worse and worse.<br>Eleazar wrote five types of works: halakhic, <i>piyyutim</i> (liturgical poems), theology, ethics, and exegesis. <i>Sefer ha-Roke'aḥ</i>, published in Fano in 1505, is his halakhic work that follows the pattern of the tosofists of Germany and northern France. The book was to educate the common reader in the details of Jewish law. He explained the law and its talmudic basis. Unlike the tosofists, Eleazar included recommended <i>minhagim</i>, customs, in his work. They were not strictly halakhic but were practices followed. He relied a good deal on German scholars who preceded him, and he quoted more than forty of them.<br>He wrote many <i>piyyutim</i>. They expressed devotion to God but also protested to God about Israel's suffering. His theological work is called <i>Sodei Razayya</i>, \"Secrets of Secrets\". It is about creation based on the alphabet, angels, revelation, and prophesy. Eleazar wrote on psychology, <i>Ḥokhmat ha-Nefesh</i> analyzing the connection of the soul and the divine world, dreams, and life after death. Eleazar's work on ethics is found in the first two chapters of the <i>Roke'aḥ</i>. He discussed the central values of Ḥasidism, love and fear of God, prayer, humility, and he detailed the way of repentance. Eleazar wrote many exegetical works. He commented on the Torah, on the Passover <i>Haggadah</i> as well as prayers from the liturgy. He explained the content, interpreted the theology and tried to find the hidden harmony in the <i>gematriot</i>, the numerical equivalents of the letters. Over the years, Eleazar became a Ḥasidic legendary hero.<br>Joseph Dan, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 6, pp. 592-94.<br>Rabbi Elijah Mizraḥi, <span class=\"rtl\">רא״ם</span>, who lived from around 1450 until 1526 was one of the greatest rabbis of the Ottoman Empire in his time. He was of Turkish origin and was born in Constantinople. He studied under Elijah ha-Levi in rabbinic studies and Mordecai Comitiano in general studies. Mizraḥi taught publically until 1475 when he became the most famous religious authority in the entire Ottoman Empire and questions on <i>halakhah</i> were addressed to him from all over. He was well respected as an halakhic decision maker, <i>posek</i>, in Turkey by his contemporaries and those who came after him.<br>In addition to teaching and heading the yeshivah he also wrote commentaries to religious as well as scientific works. He collected money to help absorb the exiles of Spain and Portugal. He respected the knowledge of the exiles, but he refused to allow them to bring in their customs foreign to Turkey. He helped teach the Karaites secular subjects as well as Oral Law, but he refused to allow Karaites to marry Rabbanites.<br>Mizraḥi had a very clear halakhic style. He presented the fundamental principles and then he raised possible objections to them and then he examined and clarified each one. His responsa were thus considered authoritative even by those who opposed his views.<br>He is known to have had a very sad, poor life, with much family misfortune, but that did not hamper his work. His most famous halakhic accomplishment was his super-commentary to Rashi published in Venice in 1527. He discussed every word of Rashi and often disagreed with him, yet he defended Rashi against Naḥmanides. The combined works were studied by most biblical rabbinical commentators from the sixteenth century onward.<br>Jacob Haberman, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 12, pp. 182-84</i> You may rely upon this (lenient decision of the <i>Yeish Omrim</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">119</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yeish Omrim</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">יש אומרים</span>; When this expression was used in the Shulḥan Arukh it referred to a source which was transmitted anonymously.

Puberty along with age in Judaism indicated adulthood and the religious responsibilities that it brought. Isserles changed this ruling and made it more strict deciding that age alone would mark adulthood and its religious obligations even for one who reaches puberty later than most normally do. The reason Isserles gave is that the person might actually have grown some pubic hairs but, because of their fragility, they might have fallen off before they could be noticed.

Its authorship has been attributed to Jonah ben Abraham Gerondi. It contains laws on forbidden foods which is the meaning of the title, but it also has laws which are connected with the duty of saving lives.<br>The term <i>issur ve-hetter</i> designates all halakhic rulings on forbidden foods and topics related to that. From the second half of the twelfth century onward it came to specify a literary genre dealing with the subject of forbidden foods. Many books dealing with the subject were produced. As Jews moved and settled in Germany, different customs arose which had not been dealt with before and this produced a need, especially relating to food, as to what was and what was not permitted to Jews.<br>Many of the <i>issur ve-hetter</i> books are anonymous and many glosses and notes have been added to the original texts to make them relevant to new customs. Some of the best known works in this category are: <i>Sefer ha-She'arim</i> or <i>Sha'arei Dura</i>, called \"<i>Issur ve-Hetter</i>\" by Isaac b. Meir of Dueren; thirty-six <i>She'arim</i> on laws of <i>issur ve-hetter</i> by Israel Isserlein (see footnote 96) along with his glosses to <i>Sha'arei Dura</i>; the laws of <i>issur ve-hetter</i> at the end of <i>Minhagei Maharil</i> (see footnote 8) which is an abridgment of the <i>Sha'arei Dura</i> as is the <i>Torat Ḥattat</i> by Moses Isserles, and the most well known, the <i>Issur ve-Hetter he-Arokh</i>.<br>Jonah Gerondi was born around 1200 and died in 1263. He was a Spanish rabbi, author and moralist. He studied in France where he learned from his teacher Solomon b. Abraham of Montpellier who had an intense hatred for the philosophical works of Maimonides. He helped burn the books of Maimonides but repented later when Talmud books were burned in the same square a few years later. He saw this as divine retribution.<br>Jonah was influenced by Kabbalah and he later returned to his home town of Gerona in Spain where he publically preached his doctrine of ethics and morality, <i>torat ha-musar</i>. He finally settled in Barcelona and became a very popular teacher. He established a large yeshivah in Toledo and died there.<br>He was known as a scholar involved with piety, humility, and ascetism. He wrote on ethics and the bad state of Spanish Jewry which was ignoring the <i>mitzvot</i> especially in matters of sexuality. He inspired public responsibility for each person for his fellow man. He based his ideas and decisions on the <i>halakhah</i> and popular <i>aggadah</i>. He wrote ethical works on social justice and social ethics.

Food or drink on Yom Kippur must take longer to consume than one would normally take to ingest them. If one must eat on Yom Kippur, then one must eat and drink slowly so that the transgression which results is a minor transgression and not a more serious one. The prohibition of eating and drinking is within a certain time period. A transgression does result, but not as severe a one as would result from eating quickly or even normally. The amount of time one must wait between one drink and the next is at least as long as it takes to drink two <i>revi'it</i>, the amount of one <i>revi'it</i> being one and one-half egg.

The animals must be killed in a specially prescribed way and be prepared so that all the blood is removed.

A person is sick and for his illness he needs to eat meat. On the Sabbath as on Yom Kippur it is forbidden to slaughter an animal for food under normal circumstances, nor is it permitted to cook food. The question is whether one is able to violate the Sabbath on Yom Kippur to save a life (which is permitted) by killing an animal according to the laws of <i>Kashrut</i> for this person's needs, or is it better to permit the sick person to eat non-Kosher meat that would not require a slaughtering on the Sabbath or Yom Kippur. Which would be more preferable among these two options? The law is that if there was time to do it, that is, if the sick person could wait for the meat, they would slaughter the animal and eventually feed him Kosher meat and not meat from a ritually impure animal. But if the sick person needed the meat immediately and the ritually impure meat was ready, and the slaughtering of a Kosher animal would postpone the sick person from being able to eat too long, then they were permitted to feed him meat from a ritually impure animal in that case to save his life.</i></small>",
            "A sick person who ate on Yom Kippur and recovers to such a degree so that he is able to bless (the food he ate, to say the Grace after the meal<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">137</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Grace after meals, <i>Birkhat ha-Mazon</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">ברכת המזון</span>, is a central part of the home liturgical service. Its obligation is considered biblical from the verse: \"Thou shalt eat and be satisfied and bless the Lord thy God for the good land which He has given thee\", (Deuteronomy 8:10). It has four parts to it and it should be said only after bread has been eaten. When bread has not been eaten, a shorter version of the Grace is recited.<br>The first blessing, <i>Birkhat ha-Zan</i> praises God for providing food for all His creatures. The second blessing, <i>Birkhat ha-Areẓ</i>, expresses Israel's special thanks for the good land God has given it. It speaks of the redemption from Egypt, the covenant of circumcision and the revelation of the Torah. The third benediction, <i>Boneh Yerushalayim</i> and also <i>Neḥamah</i>, consolation, asks God to have mercy on Israel and to restore the Temple and the Kingdom of David. These blessings also include a plea for God to always sustain and support Israel. This was the core of the Grace after Meals, but after the destruction of Bethar during the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 C.E. a fourth blessing was added, <i>Ha-tov ve-ha-metiv</i>. It thanks God for His goodness praying that He may fulfill specific desires. This is followed by special petitions which begin with the word <i>Ha-Raḥaman</i>, \"May the All-Merciful…\" This part of the prayer was once for personal desires but it then became standardized. The number of petitions vary. The Sephardi rite has fifteen while the Ashkenazi only has nine.<br>The Talmud (Ber. 48b) ascribes the origin of each of the benedictions to different Jewish heros and events. The first was originated by Moses when he saw manna fall, the second by Joshua when he conquered Ereẓ Israel, the third by David and Solomon and the fourth by the rabbis at Jabneh although it might actually date back to as early as the reign of Hadrian.<br>The <i>Birkhat ha-Mazon</i>, on Sabbaths and festivals is usually preceded by Psalm 126, which reminds us of Zion and its restoration among our earthly delights. Whenever three or more men have eaten together one of the men begins the Grace by summoning the others, (Ber. 7:1-5), \"Gentlemen, let us say Grace\", (in the Sephardi rite it is \"with your permission\"), and the others reply \"Blessed be the name of the Lord henceforth and forever.\" The leader repeats that statement and says, \"With your consent (the Sephardim say, \"With the permission of heaven\"), let us now bless Him of whose food we have eaten.\" The others respond, Blessed be He whose food we have eaten and through whose goodness we live.\" This whole introduction is called <i>zimmun</i> (Ber. 45b). The Talmud states that this must be said also by three women who eat together. The <i>zimmun</i> becomes somewhat longer when the number of people together goes to ten, a hundred, a thousand, and ten thousand. Now we insert the word <i>Elohenu</i>, \"Our God\" in the third line when ten or more eat together. Grace used to be followed by a cup of wine and there was a discussion if this was only when the grace was said with <i>zimmun</i> or also individually, (Shulḥan Arukh, <i>Oraḥ Ḥayyim</i>, 182:1). The custom now is to have the wine only on Sabbaths, festivals, and special occasions.<br>On Sabbaths and festivals special sections are added to the third blessing, <i>Boneh Yerushalayim</i>, these are <i>Reẓeḥ</i> and/or <i>Ya'aleh ve-Yavo</i> and an additional petition is added in series of <i>Ha-Raḥaman</i>. Special <i>Ha-Raḥaman</i> petitions are inserted for New Moons, Rosh HaShanah, Sukkot, Passover, and Shavuot. On Ḥanukkah and Purim the special <i>Al ha-Nissim</i>, \"about the Miracles\", section is said during the second blessing which is devoted to the thanksgiving.<br>The Grace at a wedding feast is slightly different. The third line of the <i>zimmun</i> is supplemented by \"Blessed he our God in whose abode is joy, of whose food we have eaten, and through whose goodness we live\" and then the seven wedding benedictions are recited at the end of the Grace. The Grace at the house of a mourner is also changed. The end of the third benediction has a special prayer substituted, the text of the fourth blessing is changed as is the <i>zimmun</i>. At a circumcision ceremony, the wording of the <i>zimmun</i> changes to fit the occasion. The <i>Ha-Raḥaman</i> petitions also allow for passages to be inserted by children, guests or masters of the house.<br>The <i>Birhat ha-Mazon</i> is the only prayer commanded by the Torah but the words were developed by man. Therefore under certain circumstances and for children different, shorter versions have been developed which at least mention the land and Jerusalem. When bread is not eaten another form of Grace is said. It is called <i>Berakhah Aḥronah</i>, a \"final benediction\" and what is said depends on what is eaten. When one eats of food from the five species of grain; wheat barley, rye, oats, and spelt, wine, or fruits of Ereẓ Israel, a short Grace is said, which consists of one benediction with an insertion for the type of food eaten and for the special nature of the day if it is the Sabbath or a festival. It is called <i>Berakhah Me'ein Shalosh</i>, \"a benediction summarizing the three\" regular benedictions. For any other food a short benediction called <i>Ve-Lo-Khelum</i>, \"nothing\" is said. It is also known by its first two words, <i>Bore Nafashot</i>.<br>Editorial Staff, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 7, pp. 838-41.</i>) he has to mention Yom Kippur in “<span dir=\"ltr\">יעלה ויבא״</span><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">138</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ya'aleh ve-Yavo</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">יעלה ויבא</span>, \"May our Remembrance rise and come and be accepted before Thee\" is a special insertion made to the third blessing of the Grace after the Meal, <i>Birkhat ha-Mazon</i>, (see footnote 137) called <i>Boneh Yerushalayim</i>, which speaks about the restoration of the Temple and the Kingdom of David. It also asks God to have mercy on Israel. The blessing includes a plea for God to sustain and support Israel. The insertion of the <i>Ya'aleh ve-Yavo</i> is made on the festivals and New Moons and the <i>Reẓeh</i> on the Sabbaths. Both are inserted when the Sabbath falls on a festival. Since Yom Kippur is a fast day, there is no special insertion which specifically mentions Yom Kippur in the <i>Birkhat ha-Mazon</i> which is the Grace after Meals, of which there are not to be any on Yom Kippur. According to the Shulḥan Arukh if one must eat on Yom Kippur for reasons of health and then is able to, he must recite the Grace after Meals, and in the third blessing, the <i>Boneh Yerushalayim</i> he must insert the <i>Ya'aleh ve-Yavo</i> prayer which states that it is indeed a holiday, and at the time in the prayer when the specialness of the festival is mentioned, the person must also say \"<i>Yom ha-Zikharon ha-Zeh</i>, \"This Day of Remembrance\" which indicates it is Yom Kippur.</i>” in his Grace after the meal, namely in the benediction called “<span dir=\"ltr\">בונה ירושלים</span><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">139</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Boneh Yerushalayim</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">בונה ירושלים</span>, the third blessing in the Grace after Meals; see footnotes 137 and 138.</i>”"

The prayer is a supplication for annulment of vows. The congregants pray that all the personal vows, oaths, and obligations that will be made during the coming year should be null and void. This applies to vows made between man and God. The recitation of the <i>Kol Nidrei</i> begins while there is still daylight and is prolonged until the sun sets. It has become the custom to repeat the chant three times so that late comers can be sure and hear it. The prayer relieved anxieties of a person who worried that he might have violated the sanctity of some pledge. The rabbis were concerned with the ease of annulling a vow and put certain restrictions on the procedure.<br>The origin of the <i>Kol Nidrei</i> is not know for sure. It is mentioned in the responsa of Babylonian <i>geonim</i> (see footnote 19) in the eigth century. It was condemned by the <i>geonim</i> of Sura. Some theorize that it originated in Palestine as a Rabhanite practice against the Karaites. Some feel that prayer has mystical origins like other Aramaic prayers which annul curses and oaths which had touched off evil forces in the community. By 1000 C.E. the prayer had been generally accepted by the Pumbedita <i>geonim</i> as a way to invoke pardon, forgiveness and atonement for failing to keep a vow from the previous Day of Atonement to this one. Rabbenu Tam's version changed the wording to read from this Day of Atonement to the next, the wording accepted by most Ashkenazim while most Sephardim except for the oriental and Yemenites, refer to past vows not future ones.<br>Anti-Semites have often used this prayer as evidence that the vow of a Jew was worthless, even though the prayer does not refer to man's vows with his fellow man, only with God.<br>Bathja Bayer, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 10, pp. 1166-68.</i> (and the entire prayer that follows) and afterward he says (the prayer) “<span dir=\"ltr\">שהחינו</span><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">142</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The prayer <i>Sheheḥayanu</i> is a prayer recited at the beginning of festivals, minor holidays, and at special times which mark a new, significant event and also when acquiring and putting on new clothing.

Originally the <i>Arvit</i> Service was an optional one since there was not an evening Temple sacrifice that corresponded to it as was the case with the <i>Shaḥarit</i> (see footnote 17), <i>Minḥah</i> (see footnote 40) and <i>Musaf</i> (see footnote 166) Service. Traditionally this Service was attributed to Jacob who prayed and Evening Service (Genesis 28:11).<br>The <i>Arvit</i> Service basically consists of a <i>Barekhu</i> which is a call to worship followed by the <i>Shema</i> and its benedictions and the <i>Amidah</i> (see footnote 43). After nightfall Psalm 134 begins the Service. On weekdays the Service begins with Psalms 78:38 and 20:10.<br>The blessings around the <i>Shema</i> are a bit different for the <i>Arvit</i> Service. The theme of the first blessing before the <i>Shema</i> is the change from evening to night and the second blessing is one of thanksgiving for the love shown by God for Israel in revealing his Torah. The blessing which follows the <i>Shema</i> in the <i>Arvit</i> Service is a <i>Ge'ullah</i> prayer which praises God as the Redeemer who redeemed Israel from Egyptian slavery. This is all followed by a special night prayer called the <i>Hashkivenu</i>, \"Grant us to lie down in peace\", which asks for God's help and protection from various mishaps and dangers that can happen in the mysterious night.<br>There were two versions of the final prayer, a Babylonian and a Palestinian. The Babylonian version is now used on weekdays and it speaks of God \"who guards His people Israel forever.\" The Palestinian version is used on Sabbaths and festivals which is a prayer for peace and Zion; God \"who spreads out the tabernacle of peace\".<br>In the Ashkenazi rite several scriptural verses beginning with Psalm 89:53, \"blessed by the Lord for evermore\", are inserted between the <i>Hashkivenu</i> and the <i>Amidah</i>. The Sephardi rite does not have this.<br>The <i>Amidah</i> (see footnote 43) during the <i>Arvit</i> Service is only prayed silently. It is not repeated by the reader as it is in the other Services. The <i>Amidah</i> is preceded by a half reader's <i>Kaddish</i> (see footnote 177) and it is followed by the full reader's <i>Kaddish</i>. The prayer, <i>Aleinu le-Shabbe'aḥ</i> (see footnote 182) concludes the Service.<br>On the evenings of Sabbaths and festivals there are a few changes in the <i>Arvit</i> Service. On the Sabbath it is preceded by a special set of prayers and Psalms which welcome the Sabbath, called <i>Kabbalat Shabbat</i>. The <i>Amidah</i> changes to the special Sabbath <i>Amidah</i> of only seven benedictions. Also a <i>Kiddush</i>, a blessing over wine, is also inserted into the Service. At the conclusion of the Sabbath a special <i>Havdalah</i> (see footnote 226) section is added to the fourth benediction of the <i>Amidah</i> and readings are added to the end of the Service. The <i>Arvit</i> Service usually follows the <i>Minḥah</i> Service immediately after sunset, but it can be recited up until dawn, and under special circumstances, even as late as after twilight.<br>Alexander Carlebach, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 3, pp. 664-66.</i> It is customary to recite “<i>Kol Nidrei</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">145</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Kol Nidrei</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">כל נדרי</span>; see footnote 141.</i>” while it was still day and to lengthen it with melodies until nightfall, and (“<i>Kol Nidrei</i>”) is said three times, and each time (the cantor) raises his voice “higher” (says it louder) than before, (<span dir=\"ltr\">מהרי״ל</span>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">146</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Maharil</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">מהרי״ל</span>; see footnote 8.</i> And likewise the reader says the following prayer sentence three times; “And the entire congregation will be forgiven, (etc.)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">147</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a prayer from Numbers 15:26 and 14:19-20 which follows the chanting of the <i>Kol Nidrei</i> (see footnote 141).<br>Ben Zion Bokser. <i>The High Holyday Prayer Book</i>, New York, Hebrew Publishing Company, 1959, p.259.</i>” And the congregation says three times, “And God said I forgave you according to your word”, (<span dir=\"ltr\">מנהגים</span>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">148</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Minhagim</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">מנהגים</span>; see footnote 13.</i> A man must not deviate from the custom of his city even in the melodies or <i>piyyutim</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">149</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Piyyutim</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">פיוטים</span>, is a Hebrew word derived from Greek which means a lyrical composition which was intended to embellish an obligatory prayer in the liturgy, or any other religious service whether communal or private. The word refers to liturgical compositions in Hebrew from the first century of the Common Era until the beginning of the Enlightenment, the <i>Haskalah</i>. Originally <i>piyyutim</i> meant to replace the set versions of prayers, expressing the same basic ideas, mainly on the Sabbath and festivals. When prayers became fixed, <i>piyyutim</i> were inserted into or around a set prayer. Most <i>piyyutim</i> were used to adorn and make beautiful the holy days, but there are many which were written for the Sabbaths, fast days, and even weekdays. There are also <i>piyyutim</i> for weddings, curcumcisions and mourning.<br><i>Piyyutim</i> are characterized from regular prayers by their lofty style and rythm. We know the authors of many <i>piyyutim</i> while others remain anonymous. <i>Piyyutim</i> were produced at one time or another in every land where Jews lived, each area producing its own style. There are <i>Kerovah</i> types of <i>piyyutim</i> which usually are found in the <i>Amidah</i> prayer and <i>Yoẓer piyyutim</i> found in the benediction before and after the <i>Shema</i> in the Morning Service (see footnote 17 and 173). <i>Piyyutim</i> used in the <i>Amidah</i> of <i>Musaf</i> and <i>Arvit</i> for Sabbath and holy days are called <i>shivata</i> because of this <i>Amidah</i> having seven (<i>Shevah</i>) blessings. The Morning Service <i>Amidah</i> for Sabbaths and holy days contains a sanctification prayer, therefore the <i>piyyutim</i> associated there are called <i>Kedushata</i> (sanctification is <i>Kedushah</i> in Hebrew, see footnote 213). Different holy days have special <i>Kerovot piyyutim</i> associated with the characteristic of the holiday. On Yom Kippur the special section of the service describing the Temple Sacrificial Service has many <i>piyyutim</i> associated with the <i>Seder ha-Avodah</i> (see footnote 22). There are many <i>seliḥot piyyutim</i> for the fast days (see footnote 14).<br>Styles and vocabulary of the various <i>piyyutim</i> stretch Hebrew to its fullest in creativity and made the language rich. Many <i>piyyutim</i> are difficult to understand because of the freedom of style and vocabulary that was employed.

He as a result finally moved to Valencia in 1385 where he served as the rabbi. In 1391 there were anti-Jewish riots which forced him to move to North Africa, and he settled in Algiers where he became the communal rabbi and was well respected even though at first his appointment was challenged by Simeon b.

In addition to the vast amount of halakhic material, the responsa also reveal much about the life and customs of the Jews of Spain and North Africa in the fourteenth century. Perfet was the first to discuss the status of the Marranos (Spanish Jews who converted to Christianity so as not to be expelled in 1492) from an halakhic point of view. This became a quite crucial and painful problem for the Jews of Spain and North Africa. Perfet also wrote commentaries on many talmudic tractates and the Pentateuch.

In the Bible (Numbers 28-29) additional offerings are prescribed to be brought on Sabbaths, the three pilgrimage festivals, Sukkot, Pesaḥ, and Shavuot, Rosh HaShanah, Yom Kippur, and Rosh Ḥodesh (New Moons). Talmud tractate <i>Yoma</i> 33a states that this Additional Sacrifice was to be made after the regular Morning Sacrifice. After the Temple was destroyed the <i>Musaf</i> Service found its place after the <i>Shaḥarit</i> (see footnote 17) Service in the prayers on these Sabbaths and festivals. The <i>Musaf</i> Service now comes immediately after the Torah Service, where the Torah and <i>Haftarah</i> (see footnote 170) are read, which follows the Morning Prayers on Sabbaths, festivals, and New Moons. <i>Musaf</i> can be recited anytime during the day, but one who recites it after the seventh hour (1:00 P.M. according to our time system except on Yom Kippur, see footnote 167) is considered a transgressor.<br>The <i>Musaf</i> Service begins with the reader's recitation of the half-<i>Kaddish</i>, or praise of God (see footnote 177), which is followed by the <i>Musaf Amidah</i> (see footnote 43). This <i>Amidah</i> normally consists of seven benedictions, the first and last three being the same as is always said, and the middle benediction known as <i>Kedushat ha-Yom</i>, \"Sanctity of the Day\". In the case of the <i>Musaf</i> Service the middle benediction has an introductory paragraph followed by a prayer for the restoration of the Temple Service, and it concludes with the section from the Torah which deals with the particular Additional Sacrifice made on that Sabbath or festival.<br>On Rosh HaShanah the <i>Musaf Amidah</i> takes on a unique configuration. It has three central benedictions, thus making a total of nine benedictions in the <i>Amidah</i>. The three benedictions cover the theme of the holy day, <i>malkhuyyot</i> (kingships), <i>zikhronot</i> (remembrances), and <i>shofarot</i> (Ram's Horns, see footnote 221).<br>The <i>Musaf Amidah</i> after being recited silently is repeated outloud by the reader (see footnote 42).

The <i>Musaf Amidah</i> takes on a slightly different form for each festival. On the Day of Atonement, the <i>Amidah</i> opens with the usual three benedictions. This is followed by the description of the Additional Sacrifices made on Yom Kippur found in Numbers 29:7-8. After this a prayer for the forgiveness of sins is found. The Confession, the <i>Al Ḥet</i> and <i>Ashamnu</i> Prayers (see footnote 45), form the most important part of the <i>Amidah</i> as they do in the other <i>Amidot</i> of Yam Kippur.

On Sabbaths and festivals the <i>haftarah</i> is read during the Morning, <i>Shaḥarit</i> Service (see footnote 17), but on fast days it is read only during the Afternoon, <i>Minḥah</i> Service (see footnote 40). The exception to this is Yom Kippur and <i>Tishah be-Av</i> (see footnote 102) where there is a <i>haftarah</i> after the Torah reading in both the Morning and the Afternoon Service.<br>The Torah in its regular portions is read straight through during the year but such is not the case on festivals and some special Sabbaths. The <i>haftarot</i> are selected in parts from both the Former and Latter Prophets. Only two prophetic books are read in their entirety as <i>haftarot</i>, the Book of Obadiah which has only twenty-one verses and is read after the Torah portion <i>Va-Yishlaḥ</i> (Genesis 32:4-36-43) according to the Sephardi rite, and the Book of Jonah which is the <i>haftarah</i> for the <i>Minḥah</i> Service on Yom Kippur (see the Shulḥan Arukh, <i>Oraḥ Ḥayyim</i> 622:2).<br><i>Haftarot</i> were usually selected so there would be some similarity in content between the Pentateuchal and the Prophetic portions, but often this did not happen and <i>haftarot</i> were chosen because of historical events or because of some special date. Special <i>haftarot</i> are read on special Sabbaths and the <i>haftarah</i> for each festival is based on the nature of the festival.<br>When the custom of reading the <i>haftarah</i> got started is not known for sure, but it is thought that it began during the persecutions of the Antiochus Epiphanes which preceded the Hasmonean revolt. The Torah was not permitted to be read by the Jews during the persecution for it was felt that the reading of it kept the Jews together and gave them a special strength. As a substitute for the Torah reading, sections form the Prophets were chosen that would remind the Jews of the corresponding Torah portion. Appearantly when the ban against reading the Torah was lifted, the practice of reading the <i>haftarah</i> continued. The first mention of the practice of the reading of the <i>haftarah</i> is found in the New Testament. Acts 13:15 states, \"after the reading of the law and the prophets\". <i>Haftarot</i> are also discussed in the Talmud as to which are to be read at specific times and festivals. In Mishnaic times different communities read different <i>haftarot</i>, and a set order was probably not established until talmudic times. Some <i>haftarot</i> today differ from those recorded in the Talmud, and there are differences in the Sephardi and Ashkenazi rites.<br>The <i>maftir</i>, the one who reads the <i>haftarah</i> also reads the last part of the weekly portion, (i.e., the Torah reader reads it for him). On the Sabbath, after the seventh reader from the Torah, the <i>maftir</i> usually rereads the last three verses of the weekly portion. On festivals and the four special Sabbaths, the <i>maftir</i> reads the special section from the second scroll which is usually a short description of of the festival found in the Torah. Before the <i>haftarah</i> is read (or chanted) the <i>maftir</i> precedes the <i>haftarah</i> with two blessings and after he ends the <i>haftarah</i> he recites three blessings to which a fourth one is added on Sabbaths and festivals. This fourth blessing changes with the nature of the day. The Sabbath <i>haftarah</i> usually has a minimum of twenty-one verses while the festival has at least fifteen verses.

It is the first word and the name of a prayer in the liturgy composed from the Book of Psalms. The prayer is made up of the following: Psalms 84:5, 144:15, 145, and 115:18. The Talmud (Ber. 4b) states that anyone who recites the <i>Ashrei</i> three times a day will be assured of a life in the world to come. Therefore the prayer is read three times a day in the liturgy. It is read twice during the <i>Shaḥarit</i> Service, once in the preliminary psalms, <i>Pesukei de-Zimra</i> (see footnote 17), and once toward the end, and it is read at the beginning of the Afternoon, <i>Minḥah</i> Service (see footnote 40). The <i>Ashrei</i> is also recited before the <i>Seliḥot</i> (see footnote 14), prayers of forgiveness, in the months of Elul and Tishrei. On Yom Kippur the Sephardim recite the <i>Ashrei</i> both at <i>Minḥah</i> and <i>Ne'ilah</i> (see footnote 191) whereas the Ashkenazim only recite it at the <i>Ne'ilah</i> Service.<br>Raphael Posner, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 3, p. 736.</i>” But the custom is to circumcize after the “<span dir=\"ltr\">אשרי</span>”, (<span dir=\"ltr\">מנהגים</span>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">176</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Minhagim</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">מנהגים</span>; see footnote 13.</i> And if the circumcision takes place in a location where it is necessary to leave the synagogue, we do not circumcize him until after the Torah scroll is returned to the ark, and then they return (to the synagogue) and say the (reader’s) <i>Kaddish</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">177</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Kaddish</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">קדיש</span>, which literally means \"holy\" is a doxology, mostly in Aramaic which is recited by a reader with responses made throughout it by the congregation at the close of individual sections and at the conclusion of the whole prayer. There are four principal types of the <i>Kaddish</i>; the whole or complete <i>Kaddish</i>, the half <i>Kaddish</i>, the <i>Kaddish de-Rabbanan</i> (the scholar's <i>Kaddish</i>), and the Mourner's <i>Kaddish</i>.<br>The whole <i>Kaddish</i> basically glorifies God and prays for peace. It is recited by the reader after the <i>Amidah</i> except for the Morning Service when it comes after the prayer <i>U-Va le-Ẓiyyon</i> (see footnote 187). The half <i>Kaddish</i> omits the conclusion of the prayer which consists of the last three blessings. The half <i>Kaddish</i> is recited by the reader between different sections of the service. The <i>Kaddish de-Rabbanan</i> is the whole Kaddish except for a substitution which prays for those who study Torah and teach it. It is recited after communal study, after the reading of the lighting the Sabbath candles in the synagogue (<i>Be-Mah Madlikin</i>, <i>Shabbat</i> 2), after the early Morning Service, and after the song <i>Ein Kh'Elohenu</i> praising God. The Mourner's Kaddish is recited by the close relatives of a deceased person for eleven months following the death and every year on the day which marks the anniversary of that death. It is basically the whole <i>Kaddish</i> with the exception of one line concerning supplications. It is said at certain points of the service, e. g., after the <i>Aleinu</i> (see footnote 182) and may be repeated after the reading of additional psalms.<br>All versions of the <i>Kaddish</i> are said standing facing Jerusalem. The Sephardi form has an additional verse which is not found in the Ashkenazi concerning the coming of the Messiah. At first the <i>Kaddish</i> was not part of the daily synagogue worship but by the geonic period (see footnote 19) it was an established part of the Service and it required ten men (a <i>minyan</i> constituting a congregation) to be recited.<br>The <i>Kaddish</i> did not become a Mourner's prayer until around the thirteenth century as a result of the persecution of German Jews by the Crusades. The prayer is not for the soul of the departed, but rather an expression of the justification of judgment proclaimed by those who have suffered a loss.

Originally it introduced the <i>Malkhuyyot</i> (Kingships) section of the Rosh HaShanah <i>Musaf Amidah</i> (see footnote 166). It is also found in the <i>Musaf</i> section of the liturgy for Yom Kippur.<br>The form of the <i>Aleinu</i> is like an early liturgical poem, <i>piyyut</i> (see footnote 149). It has short lines, each having about four words with marked rhythm and parallelism. Some traditions say it was written by Joshua while others give authorship to the men of the Great Assembly during the period of the Second Temple. It probably dates back to the time of the Second Temple because of two reasons. First of all there is no mention of the restoration of the Temple in it, which is unusual for this type of prayer it was written after the Temple was destroyed. Secondly, the prayer demands prostration which was a Temple practice abandoned after the Temple was destroyed except during this prayer on Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur in the Ashkenazi rite. At all other times it is customary to simply bow when reciting the words \"we bend the knee…\"<br>The main theme of the prayer is the Kingdom of God. God is praised in it for singling out the people of Israel as a nation of God worshippers not idolaters. The second paragraph expresses a hope for the coming of the Kingdom of God when all mankind will recognize the one and only true God, this being a universal ideal.<br>The prayer was censored over the years by the Christians who felt, due to a misunderstanding of the words, that it insulted Christianity even though it pre-dated that religion. Throughout the centuries different parts of the prayer were left out due to outside pressure. The Sephardim for the most part retained the entire original text which has not been restored throughout most of the Ashkenazi rites.<br>Hanoch Avenary, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 2, pp. 556-59.</i> But the reader is forbidden to move from his place at the time of the prayer in order to prosstrate, and one should object to those who do this (prostrate).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">183</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Prostration was part of the Temple Service.

After the Temple was destroyed it became the custom to only bend one's knee at this above stated line in the <i>Aleinu</i>. In the Ashkenazi rite, the reader would actually prostrate himself when he read this line during the <i>Musaf</i> Service on Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur.

The name <i>Ne'ilah</i> was derived from a ritual during the time of the Second Temple. Even though the service is now only recited at the conclusion of the Day of Atonement, it was originally recited on all public fast days including Yom Kippur.<br>The full name of the service is <i>Ne'ilat She'arim</i> which means the \"Closing of the Gates\". This referred to the daily closing of the Temple gates at night. On Yom Kippur this terminology is symbolically associated with the closing of the heavenly gates which are open until sunset to receive the atonement of a person who truly repents.<br>According to the Talmud, during Temple times <i>Ne'ilah</i> was recited daily one hour before sunset at which time the Temple Gates were closed as there was no evening sacrifice only an Afternoon <i>Minḥah</i> Sacrifice (see footnote 22). On Yom Kippur <i>Ne'ilah</i>, because of the length of the Temple Service and the special rituals involved, could not begin until close to sunset. After the destruction of the Temple and when <i>Ne'ilah</i> became only associated with Yom Kippur, it became the practice for the service to begin close to sunset, before twilight and to end at nightfall.<br>In the third century the <i>Ne'ilah</i> Service consisted of an <i>Amidah</i> of seven benedictions which were parallel to the other <i>Amidot</i> of the day (see footnote 43) and a confession of sins, the <i>Al Ḥet</i> (see footnote 45). The confession of sins though was later replaced by two prayers that are unique to the confession made during the <i>Ne'ilah</i> Service: <i>Attah noten yad le-foshe'im</i>, \"Thou stretchest forth Thy hand (in forgiveness) to sinners,\" and <i>Attah hivdalta enosh</i>, \"Thou has distinguished man (from the beast).\" These prayers remind man that God eagerly forgives one who is genuinely penitent. There is a basic rabbinic idea that divine judgment is inscribed in the \"Book of Life\" on Rosh HaShanah, but it is not sealed until the end of the Day of Atonement. Therefore at the end of the <i>Amidah</i> in the <i>Ne'ilah</i> Service the root for the word inscribe, <i>ktv</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">כתב</span>, is replaced by the root for the word seal, <i>ḥtm</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">חתם</span>, when reference is made to the \"Book of Life\". To help set off the <i>Ne'ilah</i> Service and its uniqueness on Yom Kippur, the <i>Ashrei</i> (see footnote 175) and the <i>U-Va Le-Ẓiyyon Go-el</i> (see footnote 187) prayer which normally come at the beginning of the <i>Minḥah</i> Service on Sabbaths and festivals, come at this time before the <i>Ne'ilah</i> Service.<br>Beautiful liturgical poetry has become associated with the <i>Ne'ilah</i> Service especially prayers of forgiveness, <i>seliḥot</i> (see footnote 14). The central theme of the Service is to give one a final chance and effort to seek forgiveness before the heavenly gates symbolically close at sunset. The Service ends with a feeling of confidence.<br>The <i>Ne'ilah</i> Service contains <i>piyyutim</i> (see footnote 149), an <i>Amidah</i> and a reader's repetition of it, <i>seliḥot</i>, <i>Ashamnu</i> (see footnote 45), <i>Avinu Malkenu</i> (see footnote 15), and the <i>Kaddish</i> (see footnote 177). The entire ritual culminates with a responsive proclamation of the <i>Shema</i> once (see footnote 173, but only the one line \"Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One\") followed by its response three times, <i>Barukh shem kavod malkhut</i>o <i>le'olam va'ed</i>, \"Praised be His glorious Kingdom forever and ever\", and <i>Adonai Hu ha-Elohim</i>\", \"The Lord He is God\" (I Kings 18:39) seven times. Finally in the Ashkenazi rite a final single <i>shofar</i> blast (see footnote 221) marks the end of the Day of Atonement, the Sabbath of Sabbaths.<br>Herman Kieval, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 12, pp. 943-44.</i>, and so wrote a few of our rabbis, (<span dir=\"ltr\">מרדכי והגהות מיימוני סוף ספר אהבה, וסוף הלכות יו״כ, כל בו ומנהגים</span>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">192</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Mordekhai</i> and <i>Hagahot Maimuniyyot</i> at the end of the book <i>Ahavah</i>, Love, (which is the name of the second book of Maimonides' <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, see footnote 59) and the end (of the section) of the Laws of Yom Kippur, and <i>Kol Bo</i> and <i>Minhagim</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">ומנהגים מרדכי והגהות מיימוני סו ״ס״ אהבה וסוף הלכות יו״כ וכל בו</span>.<br>For <i>Mordekhai</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">מרדכי</span>; see footnote 24.<br>For <i>Hagahot</i> Maimuniyyot, הגהות מיימוני; see footnote 27.<br>For <i>Kol Bo</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">כל בו</span>; see footnote 34.<br>For <i>Minhagim</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">מנהגים</span>; see footnote 13.</i> We do not say “<span dir=\"ltr\">אין כאלהינו</span><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">193</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>En Kh'Elohenu</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">אין כאלהינו</span>, is one of the most popular chants connected with the Jewish liturgy.

He was the head of the yeshivah in his home town of Schlettstadt. Little is known of his life other than the fact that he apparently had to hide for a number of years due to the revenge caused by his sentencing to death two conspirators who were working for the knights of Andlau. One of the conspirators was killed and the other fled and apostatized. It seems as if a number of Jews were involved in the affair for financial gain and Samuel eventually made his way to Babylonia where he obtained deeds of excommunication (see footnote 29) from the <i>nesi'im</i>, the heads of the academies, against those who were involved in the affair.<br>Samuel's best known work, <i>Hagahot Mordekhai</i> is also referred to as <i>Ha-Mordekhai ha-Katan</i>, <i>Ha-Mordekhai ha-Kaẓer</i>, and <i>Kiẓẓur Mordekhai</i>.

It was mentioned in numerous halakhic works by such scholars as Isserlein (see footnote 96), Weil (see footnote 27), Moellin (see footnote 8), and Landau (see footnote 223).<br>Samuel added notes containing rulings and additions from the work of various <i>posekim</i>, halakhic decision makers, to the <i>Mordekhai</i>, and the notes have appeared as an appendix to the major work since the edition published in 1559 of Riva di Trento.<br>Shlomoh Zalman Havlin, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 14, pp. 974-75.</i></small>",

The word is mentioned sixty-nine times in the Bible as well as numerous times in talmudic and post-talmudic literature.<br>The <i>shofar</i> was used to proclaim significant events in Judaism. It proclaimed the Jubilee Year (Leviticus 25:9-11) every fiftieth year proclaiming freedom throughout the land. Its most noted use is on Rosh HaShanah which is also called <i>yom teru'ah</i>, \"a day of blowing\", (Numbers 29:1). It was also used to declare war (Judges 3:27) and to induce fear (Amos 3:6).<br>In Temple times the <i>shofar</i> was not exclusively a ram's horn. Any curved animal's horn from a sheep, goat, mountain goat, antelope, or a gazelle was possible. The use of the ram's horn became popular because of its association with the <i>Akedah</i>, the sacrifice of Isaac read on Rosh HaShanah when the <i>shofar</i> is sounded. A ram was substituted for Isaac in the biblical account (Genesis 22) which is read on the second day of Rosh HaShanah. The <i>shofar</i> may have carved designs on it as long as the mouthpiece is natural. It may not be painted. It may not have a hole.<br>The Bible only refers to two trumpet sounds, teki'ah and <i>teru'ah</i> (Numbers 10: 5-8) the Mishna (RH. 4:9) describes <i>teki'ah</i> as one long blast and <i>teru'ah</i> as three wavering crying blasts. It prescribes three sets of <i>shofar</i> sounds since the word <i>teru'ah</i> is mentioned three times in the Bible, (Leviticus 23:24, 25:9, and Numbers 29:1). In talmudic times there was a disagreement about what exactly the sounds of the <i>shofar</i> should be and Rabbi Ahbahu decided the issue by compromise. The <i>shofar</i> was to be sounded three times which included different notes of <i>shevarim</i>, which are broken sounds and <i>teru'ah</i>, nine staccato notes. The sounding is one set of <i>teki'ah</i>, <i>shevarim</i> - <i>teru'ah</i>, t<i>eki'ah</i>, and two sets of the following: <i>teki'ah</i>, <i>shevarim</i>, <i>teki'ah</i>, and <i>teki'ah</i>, <i>teru'ah</i>, <i>teki'ah</i>. The <i>teki'ah</i> begins as a low note swelling to a higher one. The <i>teru'ah</i> is a series of staccato blasts and the <i>shevarim</i> alternates higher and lower notes. The concluding note of each of the two series is a <i>teki'ah gedolah</i>, a great, long blast, which derives its origin from Exodus 19:13, \"When the ram's horn soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.\"<br>The <i>shofar</i> used to be sounded on the second day of the month of Elul marking the beginning of the penitential season. Today it is sounded daily except for the last day of the month of Elul at the Morning Service until Rosh Ha-Shanah is over and it is sounded at the end of the <i>Ne'ilah</i> Service at the conclusion of Yom Kippur.<br>On Rosh HaShanah, Psalm 47 is recited seven times before the <i>shofar</i> is sounded. This is a reminder of the walls of Jericho being circled seven times before they fell to the sound of the <i>shofar</i>.<br>The <i>shofar</i> may only be sounded during the day. It is not sounded when Rosh HaShanah falls on the Sabbath, lest one violate the laws of the Sabbath by carrying the <i>shofar</i> into the synagogue. When the Temple was in existence the <i>shofar</i> was blown there on the Sabbath.<br>Throughout Jewish history the <i>shofar</i> was blown to announce a death, on fasts, at excommunications (see footnote 29), and at funerals. On Friday afternoons it was sounded six times to announce various work stopping times and the times to light the candles and usher in the Sabbath. Today it is used to inaugurate a new president in Israel.<br>According to the Sephardi rite the <i>shofar</i> is sounded at the end of the <i>Ne'ilah</i> Service as follows: <i>teki'ah</i>, one rising blast; <i>shevarim</i>, three blasts alternating high and low; <i>teru'ah</i>, seven staccato blasts; and <i>teki'ah</i>, one rising note.<br>Albert L. Lewis, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 14, pp. 1442-47.<br>The following comment is given by <i>Magen Avraham</i>, (see footnote 33.): 623:4 - \"And they blow (the shofar)\": Even though they still have not \"separated\" (said <i>Havdalah</i>, see footnote 226) in the prayer (and it is still not actually night), nevertheless since (the blowing of the <i>shofar</i> is a matter of) wisdom (art and know-how) and not work, and the rabbis were not too strict about it, (did not prohibit it at this occasion), since the day has already passed (<i>Tur</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">טור</span>, see footnote 23).

It was written by Jacob b. Judah Landau, a fifteenth century German talmudist. He was educated in Germany by his famous father Judah who died in 1464. Judah was a favorite pupil of Jacob Moellin (see footnote 8) and a relative of Jacob Weil (see footnote 27) who was the head of a large yeshivah and a well respected <i>posek</i>, an halakhic decision maker.<br>Jacob emigrated at some time in his life to Italy along with the great wave of Jewish emigration from Germany and in Pavia in 1460 he met Joseph Colon from whom he drew many rulings and quotes. While in Pavia he wrote <i>Ḥazon</i> a work introduced by the words \"How could it be?\" In 1487 Jacob went to Naples. He worked there as a proofreader for the new Hebrew Press established there, which published his work, <i>Ha-Agur</i> along with <i>Ḥazon</i>.<br><i>Ha-Agur</i> is an anthology and a summation of German-Jewish scholarship on the laws contained in <i>Oraḥ Ḥayyim</i> and <i>Yoreh De'ah</i> down to Jacob's own time. He based himself on the <i>Tur</i> of Jacob b. Asher (see footnote 23). Jacob wanted to assemble all the data on a particular <i>halakhah</i>, (but omitted the arguments), lay down the <i>halakhah</i>, and then include any new rulings by people such as Israel Isserlein (see footnote 96), Jacob Weil (see footnote 27), Joseph Colon, and particularly his father Judah. The work is organized similar to the <i>Tur</i> and is distinguished by the interweaving of varied material from many different works. Landau, who was well versed in Kabbalah interlaced those theories together with the halakhic material as an aid to arriving at decisions.

It is a blessing that is recited at the termination of Sabbaths and festivals in order to help distinguish the holy of the holiday from the profane or ordinary nature of the regular weekday. According to the Talmud (Ber. 33a) the men of the Great Synagogue instituted these prayers. At times the prayer was said in the <i>Amidah</i>, but when Israel got richer and could afford it, the prayer was said over a cup of wine and, therefore taken out of the <i>Amidah</i> and placed at the end of the Service. The location of the prayer varied through the tannaitic period. In different rites, different prayers begin the ceremony. Most Ashkenazim recite Isaiah 12:2-3, \"Behold, God is my salvation\". The introduction is followed by three blessings, over wine, spices, and light, the order varied before it was set down in the Mishna.<br>The blessing over light was to display that work (lighting fire) was now permitted as the Sabbath or festival was over. The blessing over wine comes from the early established duty to recite the prayer over wine. There is no agreement as to the origin of the blessing over the spices. The <i>rishonim</i> (see footnote 16) state that it is to compensate the Jew for the loss of his \"additional soul\" which traditionally accompanied him throughout the Sabbath and festivals, although other reasons have also been given.<br>The actual <i>Havdalah</i> blessing itself, the blessing over the separation of holy from profane, is the fourth blessing in the ceremony. It developed over the years into various versions. It was decided that the prayer must mention at least one distinction, that between holy and profane. When a festival is followed immediately by the Sabbath the distinction mentioned is between the holy and the holy. When a festival is followed by a weekday, <i>Havdalah</i> may be recited over wine alone without the candle and spices. Many local customs developed around this mystical ceremony as did many special songs and hymns.<br>Editorial Staff, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 7, pp. 1481-82.</i> (the “separation”) in the benediction “<span dir=\"ltr\">חונן הדעת</span><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">227</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the Sephardi ritual, the <i>Havdalah</i> ceremony was part of the <i>Arvit</i> Service (see footnote 144) and the recitation of the <i>Havdalah</i> was done during the <i>Amidah</i> (see footnote 43).

It was written by a Spanish rabbi known as Vidal Yom Tov of Tolosa who lived in the second half of the fourteenth century. He came from Tolosa, Catalonia where he wrote his commentary. The commentary does not cover the entire <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, only Books 3; 4; 5, chapters 1-9; 11; 12, chapters 1-3; and 13 are in existence. Some of his commentaries may have been lost, but it is also possible that he only commented on laws that were practical during his time. His purpose was to clarify the difficult passages of Maimonides and to indicate the sources Maimonides used. Vidal also dealt with criticisms, <i>hassagot</i>, of Abraham b. David of Bosquieres and tried to answer them. He often found both men right attributing the differences to different versions of the text. He also explained the order of the <i>halakhot</i> of Maimonides in each book. He felt that a misunderstanding of Maimonides' order was the reason for the book being so severly criticized. Vidal was quite strict in his rulings where he quoted extensively from Naḥmanides and Solomon b. Abraham Adret and others.

He was a communal leader in Toledo, and he was inspired to write his book because of the fact that customs connected with prayer varied from country to country where the Jews lived. Most of the Jews at this time did not understand the words of the prayers, nor the correct procedures and the reasons for saying them. Abudarham based his decisions on the Talmuds, the decisions of the <i>geonim</i> (see footnote 19), and early and late commentators of Spain, Provence, France and other Ashkenazi origins. Abudarham made much use of the prayer book of Saadiah Gaon. He also used several customs based on the <i>Manhig</i> of Abraham b. Nathan ha-Yarḥi of Lunel and the <i>Minhagot</i> of Asher b. Saul. He derived legal material from Asher b. Jehiel and the <i>Turim</i> of Jacob b. Asher (see footnote 23).<br>Abudarham traced the various customs in different countries of each prayer and commented on them. He included in his commentary an examination of the Passover <i>Haggadah</i>. He also discussed the weekly division of the Torah readings and their corresponding <i>Haftarot</i> (see footnote 170). He added to his book the rules of various benedictions, dividing them into nine categories and explaining and interpreting them. <i>Sefer Abudarham</i> was first published in Lisbon in 1490.

On the intermediate days, <i>ḥol ha-mo'ed</i>, work is permitted. Immediately after <i>Sukkot</i>, on the eigth day is the festival of <i>Shemini</i> Aẓeret, \"The eighth day of solemn assembly\" which is again a <i>yom-tov</i>. In the Diaspora a second day of <i>Shemini Aẓeret</i> is observed called <i>Simḥat Torah</i>, \"Rejoicing over the Torah.\"<br>The holiday is called the feast of Tabernacles or Ingathering is mentioned often in the Bible, especially in Leviticus 23:39-43. It marks the Fall harvest.<br>The holiday is celebrated by living in temporarily constructed or completed booths, <i>Succot</i>, of which at least the roof is made especially for the holiday. These booths have a roof which enables those in them to see the sky but more of it has to be covered than not. Dwelling in these booths is to remind the Jews of the wandering of the Israelites through the desert. All meals are to be eaten (by the men) in the <i>Succah</i>, and one (i.e., the men) was supposed to live in the <i>Succah</i> throughout the holiday if the weather permitted this. During the time of the Temple Jews would make <i>Sukkot</i> one of their minimal of three pilgrimages to offer a special sacrifice in honor of the harvest and the festival.<br>The rabbis established four species of plant, <i>arba'ah minim</i>,to celebrate the festival with based on Leviticus 23:39-43; the citron, <i>etrog</i>; myrtle twigs, <i>hadasim</i>; palm branch, <i>lulav</i>; and willows, <i>aravot</i>.<br>Louis Jacobs, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 15, pp. 495-502.</i> (the Festival of the Booths), and the meticulous ones begin immediately at the close of Yom Kippur to build the <i>Succah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">249</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One is to build a <i>Succah</i> for the holiday of <i>Sukkot</i> (see footnote 248). <i>Succah</i> must be at least three sided and its roof must be made of leaves and branches. The roof should be such that it will not be able to withstand a heavy down-pour. One is to dwell in the <i>Succah</i> during the holiday of <i>Sukkot</i> to remind the Jew of the wandering of the Israelites in the desert following the Exodus from Egyptian slavery. If it rains or the weather is severe one is only required to eat meals in the temporary booth of this harvest festival. According to tradition preferably each household is to have its own <i>Succah</i> and the building of it should begin immediately following Yom Kippur.</i> so they can go from one commandment to another commandment,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">250</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is a talmudic principle that one goes from <i>mitzvah</i> to <i>mitzvah</i>, from commandment to commandment. That means that when one is through completing his religious obligations in one area or a good deed, he must immediately begin fulfilling another commandment or doing another good deed. <i>Sukkot</i> is the next festival, following Yom Kippur by only five days. The concern with the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> must occupy the thoughts and the life of a pious person immediately upon the termination of Yom Kippur. Therefore the next day, if it is not the Sabbath, one should begin constructing his <i>Succah</i> (see footnote 249).</i> (<span dir=\"ltr\">מהרי״ל ומנהגים, והגהות מיימוני פרק ב‘ דברכות, מהרי״ו</span>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">251</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Maharil</i> and <i>Minhagim</i> and <i>Hagahot Maimuniyyot</i>, chapter two of the section <i>Berakhot</i>, Blessings, and <i>Mahariv</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">ומנהגים והגהות מיימוני פרק ב‘ דברכות, מהרי״ו מהרי״ל</span>.<br>For <i>Maharil</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">מהרי״ל</span>; see footnote 8.<br>For <i>Minhagim</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">מנהגים</span>; see footnote 13.<br>For <i>Hagahot Maimuniyyot</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">הגהות מיימוני</span>; see footnote 27.<br>For <i>Mahariv</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">מהרי״ו</span>; see footnote 27.</i></small>"
