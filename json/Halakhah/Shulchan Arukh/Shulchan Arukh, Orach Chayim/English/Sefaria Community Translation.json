Containing 4 Se'ifim:</b><br>When one leaves the bathroom he should recite the blessing of \"Who formed man with wisdom\", as the creation of man was done with great wisdom. There are those who interpret this to mean, that the body is similar to a sack full of air, and is full of holes, as is [mentioned shortly] below [in this siman].  Others understand \"with wisdom\" [to mean], that G-d prepared the food of Adam HaRishon [before he was created] and afterwards he was created. \"And created in him openings, openings, empty spaces, empty spaces\" -  Meaning: many holes, like the mouth,  nose, and anus, and also created in him many organs with empty spaces, like the heart, belly and intestines. \"If <b>one</b> of them were to close up\" - Meaning: that regarding the holes [of the body], there is one hole, which is the mouth, that when he (ie. the person) is inside his mother's womb, it is closed, and if, when he comes into the air of the world, it (his mouth)  would remain closed, it would not be possible to remain alive even for one moment. And regarding the organs with empty spaces, if one of them were to open, it would not be possible to remain alive for even one moment.  There is another interpretation: That there is a limit in regards to a person - that the openings [in his body] can close up and [yet] the person will not die; but once that limit is surpassed, it is impossible to remain alive for even a moment. And since, in general, the openings [made reference to in the blessing] are the anus and [urethra] hole of the male organ, and, in general, the hollow organs [mentioned in the blessing], which if they were to open [even for a moment] it would be impossible to live, are the stomach and intestines - it is fitting that this  praise is in the context of relieving oneself. And another possible [interpretation] is that since, if one were to defecate so much, to the extent that if it would surpass the [normal] limitations [of relieving oneself] he would die, this falls under the category of \"if one of them were to open\", This [demonstrates] that [the phrase] \"if one of them were to open\" is also, literally, in the context of relieving oneself. [The phrase] \"The healer of the sickness of all flesh\" refers to the holes that G-d created in him to take out the waste of his food, because if it spoils while inside his stomach he will die - and [therefore],  taking [the waste] out of him is the remedy. \"And does wondrous things\" [is in the text] because man is compared to a sack full of air, and if one were to make a hole in the sack as small as the tip of a needle, the air would escape, and the fact that man has many holes in him and his spirit is still kept inside him, this is a wondrous thing. Another explanation is that it is referring to [how the body] selects the good parts of food and pushes out the waste. <small>Rem\"a: Another explanation is that  \"does wondrous things\" refers to [the fact] that [G-d] keeps the spirit of man within his body  and binds something spiritual to something physical, and all this [is possible] because He is the healer of all flesh, because then man stays healthy, and his soul is maintained within his body (His (ie. the Rem\"a's) own opinion).</small>",

And one  who learns before he enters the synagogue or prays before, should recite the blessing at home and not recite it in the synagogue.

            "1. The Laws of Kirah and a Tanur, placing pots on them on Erev Shabbos:  A Kirah is one which is constructed in the shape of a (large) kettle. Pots are placed on top of it, where it has its mouth, and there is room for placing two pots. If this Kirah was fired by means of Gefes [olive waste], or with wood, one may not place food on it to cook in the evening (on Erev Shabbos) with the intention of leaving it there (until after Shabbos arrives) – unless the food has already been fully cooked and is shrinking (i.e., continually getting bigger and smaller as a result from the cooking) to its detriment, in which case it need not be feared that the coals in the stove will be stirred. It is also permitted to place the pot on the stove if the food is raw, i.e. it has not been cooked at all. Since it is raw, one will not pay attention to it until the next morning, as it is can finish cook during the night without stoking the coals. However, if the food is cooked a little bit, or even if it is fully cooked but shrinking through cooking will benefit it, we are concerned that the coals might be stoked. Therefore, leaving it on the stove is forbidden unless the stove is raked, in other words, all the coals are removed from it or are covered with ashes, in other words the coals are covered with ashes to lessen the heat’s intensity. If a raw piece (of meat) is put into the pot, it is permitted just as if it would consist entirely of raw (meat), since now he will not pay attention to the entire pot. But even if the coals were not raked (meaning the coals were taken out of the oven) or covered with ashes (meaning the coals were covered with ashes) it is permitted to place a pot next to it, on the outside. If it was fired with straw or stubble, it is permitted to allow a pot to stay on it even if it was not Gerufa (raked from the stove) or Ketuma (the coals are covered with ashes). <i> RAMA: If two Kirah stoves are joined one beside the other, with an earthenware partition between them: if one is Gerufa or Ketuma and the second is not Gerufa or Ketuma, it is permitted to allow a pot to stay on the one which is Gerufa or Ketuma, even though the one which is not Gerufa or Ketuma will add to its heat. </i> However, as for a Tanur stove even if it was fueled by straw or stubble, it is forbidden to place (a pot) even adjacent to it – even if it is Garuf ve’katum <i> RAMA as long as it is Yad soledes bo. (Haga'ot Mordechai) </i> It goes without saying that it is forbidden to let a pot stay within it or on it. As for a Kupach-stove which has room for placing one pot on it, where it was fueled by straw or stubble, it has the status of a Kirah; where it was fueled by Gefes or wood, it has the status of a Tanur. <i>(Our types of ovens have the status of a Kirah) (R\"an).</i> And if he forgot and left it (on the stove) if it is a Tavshil that is cooked all the way it is permitted even if it is food that improves as it condenses (called 'Mitztamech v'Yafeh Lo'). But if it is a dish that is beginning to cook and is not cooked all the way it is forbidden until Motzei Shabbos. Where one deliberately leaves a pot of food, it is forbidden in both cases<i> RAMA: until a time period has elapsed (after Shabbos) during which the cooking done on Shabbos could be done (after Shabbos) (Ha'agahot Ashiri and Rambam). But if a Non-Jew puts it back on on Shabbos the law is the same as one who forgot and left it on (Ha'agahot Ashiri). And if a Jew puts it back on the law is the same as one who intentionally left it on. (Ha'agahot Mordechai). And if the food condensed through more cooking to its detriment it is permitted because he receives no benefit from the forbidden thing. (Beis Yosef, and see the beginning of Siman 237) </i> There are those who say that where it has already been cooked to the degree of <i>Ma’achal ben Derusa’i (i.e. the name of a thief who ate his food semi-cooked) </i> or it is completely cooked and further cooking will improve it, it is permitted to leave it on a Kirah. <i> RAMA: or even on a Tanur (HaMagid; Ha'agahot Mordechai; the beginning of the paragraph Kirah in the Beis Yosef) </i> even one fired with Gefes (olive waste) or wood, and even if it was not Gerufa or Ketuma. In this opinion, Garuf ve’katum and firing with straw and stubble were mentioned only when the cooking process has begun but has not reached the stage of <i>Ma’achal ben Derusa’i; </i>or, where one has removed the pot from the stove and desires to return it on Shabbos. Where one forgets and leaves a pot of food, which has begun to cook, but has not reached the stage of <i>Ma’achal ben Derusa’i </i>, it is forbidden to eat it. It goes without saying where one intentionally leaves it there that it is forbidden to eat.  <i>RAMA: The people’s custom is to be lenient and follow this last opinion </i>...........",

A Kirah that is <i>Gerufa </i>or <i>Ketuma</i>, if one removes a pot from it even on Shabbos, he may return it as long as it is boiling hot <i>RAMA:  and it is still in his hand (Tur) </i> and he has not placed it on the floor <i> RAMA: and his intention is to return it (Tur).</i> This is specifically to the top [of the stove] but to the inside it is forbidden. It is forbidden to return [a pot] to a Tanur even if it is raked and covered up. Similarly, a Kupach when fired with Gefes [olive waste] and wood. <i> RAMA: This is specifically when the food is fully cooked (Beis Yosef). It is then permitted to return it, even to another Kirah. But if it is not fully cooked it is forbidden even to return it to the same Kirah. There are those who say that all is forbidden only where one removes it from the Kirah while it is still day and wishes to return it after dark. However, if he removes it after dark it is permitted [to return] even if in the meantime he places it on the floor. (R\"an Perek Kirah). This is our custom to be lenient for our [type of] ovens, that have the status of a Kirah, because the lenient opinion is relied upon. And it is better to be more stringent. But in all opinions where it has cooled off it is forbidden [to return it] [Beis Yosef]. There are those who say that if one removes the food from the Tanur on Shabbos it is forbidden to wrap it up in pillows or blankets. There are those who say that close to dark or close to Barchu which for us constitutes an acceptance of Shabbos (Ha'agahot Mordechai), where it is so close to Shabbos that if the pot would be cool it would be impossible to boil it up while still day, the same law (of Chazora) applies as to Shabbos itself. Some are lenient in this, and such is the accepted practice. Nevertheless it would be  preferable to be stringent where there is no real need. But this refers only (to returning) directly onto a Kirah, however placing it next to it (the stove) or even next to a fire where the heat is Yad soledes bo is permitted even close to dusk. For a Tanur there is no difference between returning a pot onto it or next to it when that area is at a temperature of Yad soledes bo, but if that area is not Yad soledes it is permitted even on Shabbos, as will be stated below in Siman 318.</i>",

One should be careful not to place the pot (containing the food) on the ground and it should be boiling hot.

            "5. On Shabbos, it is permissible to place onto a pot of hot water, a dish of food that is already fully cooked such as Panades or the like, in order to warm it, since he is not cooking in a usual manner. However it is definitely forbidden to place (food) under cloths that cover a water kettle. <i> RAMA: similarly it is forbidden to place (food) on a Kirah even if it is Gerufa and Ketuma, as the sages only permitted Chazora (but not placing a pot for the first time), as has been explained above. Some (authorities) permit placing (a pot of food) into a Tanur used for baking on Erev Shabbos, when no food was left warming in it (it was merely used for baking on Erev Shabbos), only a small amount of heat remains and there need be no concern that this will cause it (the pot) to be cooked – provided (the food) has not cooled completely. Some, however, are stringent here, and (hold that) if the heat of the Tanur is so intense that it is of Yad soledes bo, it is forbidden. See below Siman 318. One may not tell a non-Jew to do anything that is forbidden to do himself. It is therefore forbidden to tell a non-Jew to heat up the pot (of food) that has cooled. If one does so, it is forbidden to eat it even cold. [Beis Yosef and the Teshuvos HaRashba] However, if the food has not cooled below the temperature at which it is edible, it may be eaten if the non-Jew heats it up. For this reason it is common practice to have non-Jews remove pots of food from ovens in which they have been stored to retain their heat, and place them next to or on top of a heating stove, and then have the (non-Jewish) maidservant light the stove, whereupon the food will become boiling hot once again. However it is forbidden to do this through a Jew. (Terumas HaDeshen) If, however, the pots are still hot they may be placed next to the heating stove. The reason is that, as has been explained, our ovens have a status of a Kirah, and placing it next to a Kirah, which is not Garuf Ve’katum, has the same law as placing directly on top of it when it is Garuf Ve’katum (which is permitted). It has already been stated that the customary practice is to be lenient (and permit) to do Chazora [returning a pot to the stove] even if the pot has been placed on the ground. Similarly, placing (a pot) next to an oven, which is not Garuf Ve’katum (is permitted) if the food is still hot and fully cooked. It is a widespread, accepted practice to permit this.

The Laws of Food Prepared Erev Shabbos in order to complete on Shabbos, containing 9 Seifim:  Although it is permitted to do She’hiya [leaving a pot on the stove over Shabbos] with raw meat, this refers to {meat cooked} in a pot, but placing meat for roasting next to a fire close to Shabbos is forbidden, since it it roasts quickly and one might stir the coals. However, this is only for beef or goat meat; but kid or fowl, cut up into sections, are permitted (to be placed next to a fire for roasting). We do not fear that the coals might be stirred, since such meat will burn (i.e., go beyond the stage of roast and become burned meat) if the coals are stirred, for they require no more than the heat of the fire. However, (if roasting is done) in an oven whose mouth is sealed with clay, then even a whole kid or fowl, as well as beef or goat meat are permitted. We need not fear that anyone will stir up the coals, for if the stove will be opened for stirring air will enter, cooling the stove and causing the meat to harden and spoil. <i> RAMA: There is no difference here whether it is completely raw or somewhat cooked. [Beis Yosef]. As long as the body (of the animal) is whole, even if its head or feet are not attached to it, it is considered whole (Hagahos Mordechai). There are some who are stringent and hold that everything is permitted in a stove that is sealed with clay, and, (on the other hand) everything is forbidden over an open fire. The distinction made between a kid and fowl and other meat, exists only where the mouth of the oven is closed but not sealed with clay. Common practice is in accordance with this opinion (Tur, Hagahos Ashiri, Beis Yosef in the name of Rashi, the Smag, the Smak). </i>",

It is forbidden to roast onions, eggs, or meat on coals unless there is enough time in the day for them to be roasted on both sides, to the degree of Ma’achal ben Derusa’i, which means half-cooked, even if it is kid meat. The reason is that since one placed them on coals, one’s principal concern is that the roasting be done quickly – even if the meat gets scorched, and we therefore fear that the coals will be stirred. However when it is already roasted to the degree of Ma’achal ben Derusa’i, then even in the case of beef, we do not fear that the coals might be stirred, for since it is already edible, there is no reason that anyone would want to stir the coals and ruin it.",

One may tell others who do not have anything else to eat to come and remove the food for the Third Meal; and when removing the bread, he should not remove it with a baker’s peel, but rather with a knife or something similar so that he doesn't do it the same way he does during the weekdays. If one cannot remove the bread in a different way, he may remove it with a baker's peel. And if one waited the amount of time it takes for it to crust, so that he will not perform a forbidden task and it is a Shabbat need, he may remove it like he normally does; if not for a Shabbat need, he may not do so even in a different way. <i>RAMA: All of this applies regarding an oven that is not sealed with clay (Hagahos Ashiri). However if it is sealed with clay, or he is not baking it for the needs of Shabbat, but rather for Motzei Shabbat where it has time to bake, it is permitted because we do not make a Gezeirah in this situation due to (worrying) he might rake the coals (Kol Bo)</i>",

However, during the time-frame that is questionable if it’s night (Bein Hashemashos), Hatmana may be done.  Hatmana may not be done in a substance that adds heat, even while it is yet day (before Shabbos). If one did Hatmana in a substance that adds heat, the food is forbidden even after the fact. But this specifically refers only to cold food heated (by Hatmana) or (cooked food) improved by further cooking, but if it only retained its original warmth, it is permitted (to eat the food). <i> RAMA: There are those who say that if one forgot and did Hatmana accidentally with a substance that adds heat, it is permissible to eat.

The following three substances add heat when wet: straw, zagin (definition: Grape refuse after pressing), mochin definition: according to the Mishnah Berurah, this is any soft material, such as cotton, soft tufts of wool torn from lambs, or shredding of worn clothing), and grasses. The following substances do not add heat: clothing, fruits, dove downs (or other feathers), worn linen fibers, and carpenter’s shavings (the fine scraps of wood that fall from wood when planed). <i> RAMA: There are those who say that Hatmana is permitted with rocks, even though they add heat, since rabbinical decrees were not enacted in unusual circumstances.

This holds true whether the first (coverings) retain more heat than the second, or whether the second retain more heat than the first. Even if (the pot) was only covered with a sheet, he may remove and replace it with a thick woolen cloak.

Even though it is permitted to leave a pot standing on a Kirah containing coals according to the conditions explained in Siman 253, however, if the pot is covered with soft materials, even though they do not add heat, they will nevertheless add heat because of the fire underneath [and it is forbidden]. However, in a way that the soft materials do not touch the pot, even though there is fire underneath them, it is permitted since this is not the normal manner for Hatmana. Therefore, where one places a pot on a Kirah or Kupach that contains coals, and the bottom of the pot does not touch the coals, it is called She’hiya and permitted according to the rules laid down in Siman 253. If one places a wide utensil over the pot in such a way that it overlaps the pot and then puts cloths over the wide utensil, this is permissible. Since the cloths do not touch the pot as the utensil is wider than the pot, it is not considered Hatmana. Similarly, it is permitted to place a pot into our ovens by putting a raw piece into it, provided that the pot is not touching the coals. Even if the mouth of the oven is covered with cloths, since the cloths are not touching the pot it is not considered Hatmana and it is permissible. <i> RAMA: The Hatmana which is done in these regions, whereby food is stored in the oven and the mouth of the oven is sealed with clay, is permitted according to all opinions, as explained above in Siman 254 and will be explained below at the end of Siman 259. It is a mitzvah to wrap food for Shabbos so that he will have hot food to eat on Shabbos, for this is an honor and delight of Shabbos.

Rather, he should shake the cover and it will fall (on its own) e.g, its muktzah is uncovered, and this is not considered 'moving'. However, if it was insulated with fleece wool, even if it was not designated for that purpose, it is permitted to move it. This refers to fleece that is not set aside for commerce. However if they are for merchandise they must be set aside. If one insulates with them without them being set aside, one shakes the cover and they fall off, that is to say, when the cover of the pot is considered as a k’li. Even though they are on top of it, we are not worried about it, because we do not make a Basis for them.",
            "2. Those who place stones and bricks around a pot (for insulation) must permanently designate them for that purpose (so that it will be permitted to move them on Shabbat). For as long as they are not designated for that purpose, they are not considered important to a person and he may cast them away. Therefore, it would be forbidden to move them if they were not set aside and designated for that purpose",

When a person insulated [a pot of food] in a container full of muchin that are forbidden to be moved, once he removed the pot from there in the prescribed manner, he may return it there, as long as the hollow [in which the pot had been placed] remains intact. If, however, the hollow did not remain intact, it is forbidden to return it. Nevertheless, as an initial preference, one may remove the pot with the intent of returning it, [provided the hollow remains intact]. We are not concerned that he may widen the hollow if it does not remain intact. There are those who say that even if one insulates with a substance that is permissible to move, if the hollow remains intact one may not return it, because the pot would need to have a place made for itself to be grasped, as we find regarding one who insulates on Shabbat.",

If it is possible to have a minor Jew do it, an adult Jew should not do it. If it is not possible, then an adult can do it in a slightly different manner than usual, and this is our custom. And it seems to me that it is permitted to return it and seal the over, in other words during the day, for then all the pots have been cooking like they have needed. However at night, close to the time he insulates it - for there is a doubt that maybe the pots have not yet cooked fully - it is forbidden to seal the oven because one will cause [the food] to cook more quickly as is explained in Siman 257 Seif 4. Even doing so via a non-Jew is forbidden, as explained above at the end of Seif 253 (and for other laws regarding Chazarah on Shabbat see later Siman 318).</i>"

And some say that if she stipulates before she ignited that she is not accepting the Sabbath until the cantor says \"Bless,\" it works. And some say it does not work. And some dissent (from the author Halakhos Gedolos) and say that she does not accept the Sabbath by igniting the lamp but rather by the evening prayer, because when the cantor says \"Bless\" all refrain from their labor; and according to these, when we begin with \"A song for the Sabbath Day,\" that is like \"Bless.\" <i>RAMA: And the practice is that a woman who ignites accepts the Sabbath in that ignition if she has not before stipulated, and even a  mental stipulation counts. (Mordechai) But the rest of the house's residents are permitted labor until \"Bless.\" And the essence of the ignition resides in the lamps ignited on the table but not in the rest of the lamps in the house. (Or Zarua) And it is necessary to place the candles at the ignition site, and not to ignite them in one place and move them to another. (Mordechai's commentary on Bava Metzia)</i>",

And as regards the matter of doing labor -- in both the case of the congregation and the individual they are permitted, because the acceptance of the Sabbath was in error. And some say that those who ignited lamps are prohibited from doing labor, and the rest of the house's residents are permitted.

            "1. <b>The Laws Pertaining to a Woman’s Ornaments, 27 Seifim:</b> A woman may not go out [to the public domain on Shabbat] with strands of wool, strands of flax, or strips [of leather] wound around [the hair on] her head. This is a decree [enacted by our Sages] lest she be [required] to immerse herself [in the mikveh]on Shabbos. If she would be granted license to go out wearing these strands or strips, she might also go to the mikveh while [wearing] them. We are concerned lest she walk 4 amos in the public domain. If the strands and straps are braided into her hair, she is permitted to go out wearing them. There is one [opinion] who forbids this. If the strands are (hollow and formed like a net) ([and] woven) it is permitted because she would not be required to remove them during immersion. <i>RAMA: And also so they will not be soiled or gilded, because in that instance as well, she is careful to remove them before immersion so that the mud will not dissolve in the water [and soil her body when she emerges from her immersion]. </i>",
            "2. A woman is allowed to go out [wearing] strands wound around her neck which are loose, and she is not required to remove them at the time of immersion. However, [going out] with a choker is forbidden because she must remove it at the time of immersion; [Why?] since she “chokes” herself with this strap in order to appear plump. (Note: In that era, it was considered attractive for a woman to appear plump. Some explain the rationale: Hunger was prevalent and being well-fed was a sign of prestige). And we worry that maybe she will travel little by little 4 amos in the public domain. Similarly, a woman should not go out wearing a totefes. [That term refers to an ornament] like a forehead plate that extends from ear to ear. Nor may she go out with a sharvitin. This is also a type of headband wrapped around her head, [with strands] hanging down on her cheeks from both sides. The restriction applies provided these strands are not sewn into her hairnet, for then there is room for concern that she might remove them to show to her friends and walk thusly 4 amos in the public domain. By contrast, there is no such concern if [the strands] are sewn into her hairnet, for she will certainly not remove them together with her hairnet, so as not to reveal her hair. (Note: For a married woman’s hair is considered as “nakedness” (Berachos 24a). Uncovering it is a sign of immodesty (Kesubos 72a). <i>RAMA: And there are those who say that regarding an unmarried woman, who is not concerned about her hair being uncovered, it is forbidden to go [wearing such strands] even if they are sewn to her hairnet, because it is possible that she will remove them [together] with the hairnet to display their beauty and afterwards forget [that it is Shabbos]and carry them by hand.</i>",

Its width is two fingerbreadths wide, the width of [the Kohen Gadol’s] forehead plate. [A woman should] not [go out wearing] an itztima, a cloth from which are hung multi-colored [woolen] strands.

Therefore, it is prohibited to say 'I will do such and such tomorrow' or 'I will purchase this and this merchandise tomorrow'. Even idle talk should be curbed. <i>RAMA: People who enjoy hearing stories or the latest news may speak these things on Shabbos but one who does not enjoy them may not speak them for the sake of giving pleasure to someone else.</i>",
            "2. It is prohibited to hire workers or to ask a Gentile to hire workers on Shabbos, even if the Jew only requires the work to be done after Shabbos. This is because everything that one is forbidden to do it is forbidden to tell a Gentile to do. It is also prohibited to ask a Gentile before Shabbos to do something on Shabbos. Nevertheless one is permitted to say to him after Shabbos “why did you not do so and so last Shabbos”, even though he will understand that one wishes he should do that particular Melacha next Shabbos.",
            "3. It is prohibited to give money to a Gentile before Shabbos for him to make a purchase on Shabbos but one may say to him “purchase it for yourself and if necessary I will buy it from you after Shabbos.”",
            "4. It is permitted to give money to a Gentile before Shabbos for him to make a purchase provided that one does not say to him “purchase it on Shabbos”. <i>RAMA: Likewise it is permitted to give him clothes to sell provided that one does not tell him to sell them on Shabbos. (Beis Yosef in the name of the Sma\"g). One who hired a Gentile to transport merchandise and the Gentile arrived on Shabbos in order to take it from the Jew’s house, it is forbidden to allow him to take it and it is proper to punish the perpetrator. (Rabbeinu Yerucham).</i>",
            "5. One may instruct a Gentile to do an action that is not a Melacha but which is prohibited on account of a rabbinical prohibition, provided that it is needed in a case of minor illness, or it is greatly needed, or for the sake of a Mitzvah. For example, a Jew may instruct a Gentile to climb a tree to bring down a Shofar needed to blow for the sake of a Mitzvah, or to bring water through a yard that was not included in an Eiruv in order to wash someone suffering. There are those who prohibit it. <i>RAMA: Further in Siman 686 the Mechaber ruled that it is permitted, and see above in Siman 276 that there are those who permit it even for a Melacha de’Oraissa (work forbidden Biblically).</i>",
            "6. One may not calculate one’s expenses, even ones from the past. For example, to say I spent such and such an amount on something. However this is only when one must still pay the workers, but if one has already paid them it is permitted.",

The same applies to similar cases where there is a permissible manner to accomplish it today, one may instruct someone else to do it tomorrow provided that one does not mention his terms for hire. However, something that cannot be done today, even when it is only prohibited rabbincally, for example one has fruit that are muktze outside of the Techum, since it is not possible to bring them into the Techum it is prohibited to give instructions to bring them tomorrow. Likewise one may not position oneself at the end of the Techum in order to hurry and bring them after Shabbos. <i>RAMA: Likewise one may not say that one will do such and such tomorrow [Rosh, Perek HaShoel and see above at the beginning of the siman].</i> However, one may position himself at the end of the Techum in order to hurry and guard them because that could be done on Shabbos were they within the Techum.

            "16. One may not read on Shabbos secular books of phrases and parables, books of passion (such as Emanuel) and war books. One may not read them during the week as well because it is a “sitting of scoffers” and because one is  “removing Hashem from one’s mind”. Books of passion have an extra prohibition of arousing one’s evil inclination, and therefore the authors, the duplicators and of course the publishers cause the masses to sin. <i>RAMA: It is noteworthy that it is only prohibited to read secular writings and war books when they are written in foreign languages, but when written in Lashon Hakodesh it is permitted. That is what I see from Tosefos in Perek Kol Kisvei (Shabbos 116b), and people are accustomed to being lenient with this.</i>",

The same applies to any heter that has an issur on top of it. If the bed does not have money on it now, nor was it there Bein Hashemashos, it may be handled, even if it was reserved for money and money was placed on it before Shabbos, since the money was removed before Bein Hashemashos. <i>RAMA: There are those who forbid it if it was reserved and money was placed on it, even though it was removed before Shabbos. (Tur, in the name of Rabbeinu Tam). Therefore it is forbidden to handle a purse even though the money was removed before Shabbos, unless something was done to it, i.e. it was opened from underneath and its function was changed. Such is the custom. However, to be moved le’tzorech gufo or mekomo is permitted. As for a pocket sewn onto a garment, since the garment is mainly used for wearing, if the money was removed one is permitted to wear the garment, because the pocket is inferior to the garment. If money was left inside, although the garment may be handled because we do not say that the garment is a Basis to the money,  since the money is not on the actual garment, however it may not be worn on Shabbos lest one walks out with it, as mentioned above Siman 301 se’if 33.

For example: a scoop that has ashes on it from before Shabbos, which are permitted to carry to cover saliva or filth, when it has flakes of wood that are Muktze on it as well, it may be carried as is. This is true when the heter is more significant than the Muktze, but if the Muktze is more significant, then the heter is inferior to the Muktze and it is forbidden to carry. The grounds for this heter are because the ashes cannot be carried by themselves even if one were to tip them to the ground, [or because one needs the space of the scoop as explained above in Siman 309:3]. If one only requires the actual scoop one should not carry it as it is, rather one should tilt the ashes and the flakes of wood off in their place and take the scoop. <i>RAMA: Also, if one is able to tip the Muktze, one should do so and not carry it together with the heter. [Beis Yosef in the name of the Teshuvas of the Rosh]. All of this is true when the heter was together with the Muktze before Shabbos, but if the Muktze was on it by itself, it does not help by placing the heter adjacent to it on Shabbos.

When the heat oppresses from above, one of them fetches a sunshade and spreads it above him, and the other follows suit. One of them stands his bed upright and slips away and the other follows suit, the result being an automatic screen, since the sunshades are in proximity of each other with the bottom parts on the ground on either side of the body.",

And a reed that was designated to be used as a lock does not need to be tied to the door but it is more similar to building than a window plug, and having it in mind from yesterday is not sufficient, and he needs to designate it for that use. According to Rashi, this means that he designates it for the sake of a utensil that is fit for some use, such as turning olives with it or cracking nuts with it. And according to R\"T, there is no need for it to be fit for something else, but since he designated it and did an action and prepared it for that use, it is sufficient. Rema: And by doing so, it is considered a utensil whose function is permitted, and it is allowed to move it as explained above in section 308 paragraph 2 (Beit Yosef and Rambam). And for a carpenter’s peg, which is used to lock with it and inserted into a hole below and is more like building this is not enough, and one may not lock with it unless it is tied. And how should it be tied? If there is a knob at its head, which means that it is thick at one of its ends and fit for crushing with it, which makes it similar to a utensil, then it is enough even if it is tied with a thin rope that is not fit for carrying with it, and even if it is not tied to the door itself but to the door bar, and even if the rope is long and not hanging at all in the air but all lying on the ground. And if there is no knob at its head, if it is tied to the door itself, then it is enough even with a thin rope that is not fit for carrying with it, and even if all of it is lying on the ground. And if it is not tied to the door but to the bar, then it needs to be a strong knot that is fit for carrying with it, and even so, it does not need to be hanging but even if all of it is lying on the ground, then it is permitted because there is no prohibition unless when they drop it and place it in a corner:",

Rema: And certainly if they still have a hinge; but he should not put back the hinge in its place, as will be clarified later in section 519 (Beit Yosef).

For example, the camel riders knot, the sailors knot and the knots tying shoe and sandal straps tied by the leather workers when manufactured etc. However, one who ties a permanent knot that is not a craftsman’s knot is patur. <i>RAMA: There are those who disagree and say that one is chayav for tying a permanent knot even if it is a layman’s knot. [Rashi; Rosh; R' Yerucham; Tur] Others say that any knot that is not intended to be opened that very day is called a permanent knot. [Kol Bo, etc] Others are lenient and say that a knot tied for less than seven days is not called a permanent knot. [Tur; Mordechai]</i> One is initially permitted to tie a knot, provided it is neither a permanent nor a craftsman’s knot. <i>RAMA: The same rule applies to untying a knot as with its tying (Tur).</i> How is this applied? If one’s strap tore and one tied it, or if a rope snapped and one tied it, or if one tied a rope to a bucket, or if one tied an animal’s rein one is patur. The same applies to all such knots which are simple but made to last. Any craftsman’s knot tied temporarily is forbidden (but not chayav). Tying a temporary knot for the sake of a mitzvah is permitted, for example in order to measure a halachic requirement. <i>RAMA: Some say that one should not untie any double knot, because we are not certain as to the definition of a craftsman’s knot and even such a temporary knot is forbidden to tie or untie and such is the custom. (Hagahos Alfasi) Nevertheless when it causes distress it may be untied, being it just a rabbinical prohibition and when distress is involved Chazal did not impose a prohibition. The prohibition of a double knot applies to the tying of two ends but tying a single knot in the same string or thread is equivalent to tying a double knot. (Sma\"g)</i>",

Regarding telling a non-Jew to procure the tools, if it is something that were a Jew to do it, it would only be a rabbinic violation, one can tell a non-Jew to procure them, but if it is something for which it is Toraitically forbidden for the Jew to do, one cannot tell the non-Jew to do it (And see above chapter 307).",

One may not dab up oil, dipping his fingers in it and rubbing it off on the sides of a container [so that the oil runs down the sides and is thereby collected]. Rem\"a: There are some who restrict this to a broken barrel, because in that case, he is panicked, and if he is allowed to save its contents we fear that he will fix it. However, if it is cracked and slowly dripping, he is less panicked, and is allowed to save the contents in containers, collecting and combining (Hagahot Mordechai and Tosafot Perek Kol Kitvei and Hagahot Maimoni Chapter 22).

However, using a panel is allowed, because something falling its own force is allowed in every karmelit. <i>RAMA: There are some who say that if the toilet is higher than ten tefachim, it is always permitted because he is moving something from the private domain to the karmelit through a place of exemption.

And see above chapter 345 that some disagree and think that there is no place of exemption in the karmelit. And according to what was explained above in chapter 345 that all agree that there is no place of exemption in the private domain, if a toilet is between two houses, it is forbidden to use it if the houses are not conjoined (eruv) and nothing has been done during the day on Friday. If such had been done, as was explained in paragraph 2, it is permitted, but otherwise it is considered a non-enclosed yard, as will be explained below in chapter 357.

Those who use boats go to the bathroom from the paddle wheel to the sea.

Because it is not four [by four] amot, two seah of water that someone would use everyday cannot be contained by the yard, and it is as if he pours water to the public domain. Therefore, it is necessary to make a pit that will be able to hold two seahs of water. <i>RAMA: Every pit that is one half amah by one half amah and three-fifths amah deep can hold two seah (Ramba\"m).</i> This is true whether he makes the pit in the yard or outside. If he makes it outside, he must cover it with boards to make it a place of exemption, and therefore the water will be falling from his hand to a place of exemption. Once he makes the pit, he can pour as much as he wants in. If it doesn't hold two seahs, he may not pour anything. If the yard is four by four square amot, even if [this square amot count is fulfilled in a yard that is] exceptionally long or wide, or if it is winter, one is permitted to pour as much water as he likes. A yard and an exedra (meaning a house with three walls, and the fourth wall that would have the door does not fully enclose the the house. Sometimes there are columns every amah, according to the Aruch, and columns are bits of walls that are straight and even) that individually are not four [by four square] amot can join together to complete this four [by four square] amot area and allow pouring in it. <i>RAMA: This is the case for two upper-level rooms that are in front of two chambers that have a ceiling that can hold water. If they are adjacent to one another, they can be combined for this purpose (Beit Yosef in the name of Rabbenu Yonatan).</i> What are we talking about? When a yard is adjacent to the public domain, but if it is adjacent to the karmelit, even if it is tiny, it doesn't need a pit even in the summer (and see below chapter 377).",

If a drain is covered for four amot in the public domain and it is four by four, it is permitted to pour water into the drain even in the summer, even though the water travels from your hand to the outside. This is true as long as the drain is not wooden because such a drain cannot hold enough. But if it is made of stone, it is allowed. The Ramba\"m says that even if the drain or pipe is 100 amot long, one should not pour into it during the summer; rather, one should pour just outside of it and the water will descend into the drain.",
            "3. What are the parameters? The water must be exiting to the public domain, but if it exits to the karmelit, it is permitted to pour into the drain even during the summer. <i>RAMA: There are those who say that there is no distinction between the karmelit and the public domain (Beit Yosef in the name of the Tosafot and the Ros\"h in Chapter Keitzad Mishtatfin). This is only with regards to a karmelit that is inside the city, because it is similar to the public domain, even in our day when there is no public domain. However, a karmelit outside of the city or a non-enclosed yard is permitted (Mordechai Chapter Hazorek and the Sma\"g and his own opinion) (Responsa of the Mahara\"m chapter 90). If a city is surrounded by a wall but has no eruv, it is treated like a non-enclosed yard (Mordechai at the end of Chapter HaDar and Trumat HaDeshen chapter 73 and 74).

If the dirt is not ten [tefachim] tall, it will be as if he broke the wall, because there are not ten tefachim above the ground, and it is considered the ground of the yard.

One should not go from beside it in a straight line and measure there, but rather measure opposite the city. When he reaches a hill, if the incline is so steep that if a plumb line were lowered from the top [of the incline], it would descend in a relatively straight line and would not diverge on an incline at the lower end of the hill for a distance of four cubits, it is not necessary to measure the ascending or descending slope [of the hill] at all. If the hill has a flat area at its top, he does not measure at all. If the plumbline moves away from being opposite him by four cubits and then contracts by ten out of fifty, meaning that in a walk of five cubits of incline, ten handbreadths rise, then he can see if the edge of the rope reaches his lip, but if it cannot be spanned by a rope of fifty cubits, he measures with a rope of four cubits. One person stands at the foot of the mountain and one above it at a distance of four cubits, and the lower one gives the rope opposite his heart and the upper one opposite his feet, and the lower one ascends to where the upper one stands and the upper one ascends four cubits, and they measure as before. If he is more inclined, for every four cubits of incline, ten handbreadths rise, so they give up on him and estimate the distance based on their judgment. If it is only fifty cubits, they estimate how much it is based on their judgment, and if it is more than fifty cubits, they measure with a rope of four cubits. ",

If not, it is measured in a rope of four cubits, and it should not be deeper than two thousand cubits. However, if it is deeper than two thousand cubits, the descent and ascent of the entire slope are measured. If the plumbline does not move away from him by four cubits, it can be spanned in a rope of nine cubits from its starting point. If not, the slope of the descent and ascent is not measured at all, but only the plain of the bottom, even if it is deeper than two thousand cubits. ",

If one arrives at a hill (or valley) and the entire portion of the hill or valley that is opposite the town is more than 50 cubits wide and thus it cannot be spanned, for example, [the hill or the valley] is [situated] to the east of the town, and [the person measuring] is not able to span [the hill or valley] along the entire length of that side, if [the person] can span [that distance] by proceeding within the 2000 [cubits of the Shabbos limits] to the north or to the south, he should proceed there and span [the hill or the valley], as long as it is still within the boundary of the city. If, however, [the person] cannot span [the hill or the valley] within 2000 [cubits] on the town’s sides, he should not proceed further [away from the town] to span that area. {<i> Ed.

If two experts came and measured [a town’s] Shabbos limits, one [arriving at] a larger measure and the other [arriving at] a smaller one, we [accept the ruling of] the one who arrived at the larger measure. [The above applies] provided that [the larger measure] does not exceed [the smaller measure by] more than [the difference between the measuring along a diagonal from the corner of the town [and measuring from the perimeter of the town]. What is implied? It can be said that the larger measure was arrived at [for the following reason]: Perhaps the first [expert] measured the 2000 [cubits] diagonally from one corner of the city, [proceeding outward] along the diagonal, and he did the same [when measuring] from the other corner. Therefore, when a [measuring] rope is extended from the end of the Shabbos limits from one corner to the end of those limits [measured] from the other corner, the distance between this line and the city will be less than 2000 [cubits]. The [second expert, however,] measured properly, [i.e., perpendicularly] from the [border] of the city. We do not presume that the first [expert] erred by more than this amount. {<i>Ed. Note: Therefore, if the second [expert] added a greater distance than this, [his ruling is not heeded</i>}",
            "10. The Shabbos limits around a city are configured like a square tablet, i.e., 2000 cubits are measured outward along the entire length of the eastern side of the city and the same is done on its northern side. Afterwards, it is viewed as a square tablet [measuring] 2000 [cubits] by 2000 [cubits] to fill up the corners. Thus, the corner of the Shabbos limits of 2000 cubits on a diagonal will be 2800 [cubits distant from the city]. The same pattern should be followed for all the other corners. However, one should not measure 2000 cubits [outward] diagonally from the center of one corner and do the same from the opposite corner, and then extend a [measuring] rope from one to the other. [The rationale is that] were [the person taking the measurements] to do so, he would forfeit 800 [cubits] on the diagonal, and moreover, the Shabbos limits from the [edge of the] city would be 1428 [cubits].",

Even a Canaanite bondman or maidservant {who accepted the observance of the mitzvos in which women are obligated} is [considered as] trustworthy when [he or she] says: “The Shabbos limits extend until here.” A minor, by contrast, is not considered as trustworthy [regarding this matter].

And those who bring them [objects] into a city may move them within the entire city, which is like an area of four cubits, provided that the city is surrounded for dwelling purposes. Small, walled towns are considered to be surrounded for dwelling purposes, even if the houses were built first and the walls were erected around them later.

And when it is a Rabbinic law, its doubt will be resolved leniently. <i>RAMA: However, if one was walking on this path or by jumping there from within twelve cubits outside of twelve cubits, we follow the more stringent opinion, which states that the boundaries are twelve cubits according to Torah law (see my own words and Responsa of the Rambam).</i>All authorities agree that the Scriptural prohibition [against going beyond] the Shabbos limits does not apply [to travel] on seas and rivers even [when one goes] beyond twelve mil, because [these bodies of water] do not resemble the encampment [of the Jews] in the desert. When a person is traveling in a ship on Shabbos and arrives at a harbor [on that day], if [the ship] was always traveling ten handbreadths above seabed or riverbed from the commencement of the Shabbos until [the time when] the ship reached the harbor, [the person] is not considered [as one who] went beyond his Shabbos limits, and this person has 200o cubits from the place where he was lower than 10 tefachim.  <i>{Ed.

In those cases, we equate this pain to that pain, and that is why the later authorities discuss this. However, somebody who vows to fast forty days must fulfill his vow, because it isn't any weaker than saying \"this day,\" where he cannot borrow and repay. Even those who hold that when he says \"this day,\" he can borrow and repay, would concede here that he must fulfill his vow. This applies even more to the forty days before Yom Kippur when people fast in remembrance of Moses's ascent of the Mountain [Sinai].

Therefore one should not kindle one from another. (Hagahot Maimoniot and Mordechai) And all this is only while they are still alight for the mitzvah, but after the time of the mitzvah has passed, it is permitted to benefit from them, [so] all the more so it is permitted to kindle from them.

Therefore, a lamp that was burning all day that was kindled on Sabbath Eve for the Hanukkah mitzvah, after Sabbath one extinguishes it and [re]kindles it for the purpose of the mitzvah. In any case, one needs to kindle it in the location of its placement, for if one kindled it inside and brought it outside he has not fulfilled [the mitzvah], for one who sees [this] will say [that] he kindled it for his own needs.
