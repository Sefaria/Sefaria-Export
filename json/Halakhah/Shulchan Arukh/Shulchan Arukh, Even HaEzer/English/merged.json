Rem\"a: He who does not marry is not allowed to make a blessing or to engage in Torah etc. and he is not called a man, and when he marries a woman, his sins are cast into doubt, as it is said: \"One who has found a wife has found goodness and obtains favor in the eyes of God.\" (Proverbs 18:22)",

If 20 years go by and he has not taken a wife and he who lets 20 years pass, or he who does not want to marry, the courts can force him to marry in order to fulfill the mitzvah of being fruitful and multiplying. What are the things that might delay marriage? If he is busy with Torah, or if it is too burdensome and he fears to marry a women in order that he is not burdened in his livelihood and he will not fail in Torah it is permitted to delay. Rem\"a: In this time, its custom that one does not force in regards to this. Likewise he who does not fulfill the mitzvah of being fruitful and multiplying and he comes to marry a woman who is not a bat banim, for example...",

And a ben siris (castrated son) and a nekivah ayalonit (girl who doesn't achieve signs of puberty) do not count. Rem\"a: The ram is the male of the flock, in other words, that the woman has a male nature and those signs she does not have like breasts of a woman and her voice is thick...doesn't stick out from her body like women]",

What are the circumstances for this case? When there are grandchildren, a male and a female, and they came from the son and the daughter (of the obligated individal of halakha 5) despite the fact that the male grandchild comes from the daughter and the female grandchild comes from the son, since they came from his two kids, they fulfill the mitzvah of being fruitful and multiplying. But if he has a son and a daughter and they die and only one grandchild remains he still has not fulfilled his obligation. Rem\"a: if the son is a mamzer or deaf-mute, or an idiot, or a minor, he has fulfilled the mitzvah.",

He may sell a sefer Torah in order to do so if he has a doubt that he has enough children or if he has a doubt that he has married a women of child bearing capability. If he does not have children he sells so that he can marry a woman capable of bearing children but if he has children he should not sell it and marry a woman who is capable of bearing children, but he should not be without a wife. And some say, that even if he has sons, he sells the sefer Torah to marry a woman capable of bearing children. Isserless: However, if it is recognized that the will not be more grandchildren and it is not appropriate that more will not be born to him, he marries a women who is not capable of bearing children, and thus if he has many sons and he fears that if he marries a woman of child bearing age an altercation will come and discord will come between the children and his wife he is permitted to marry a woman who is not capable of bearing children but it is forbidden to settle down without a wife because of this fear.",
                "A man may marry a number of women provided that he has the means to sustain them, and what we find is that the sages gave worthy suggestion that a man marry no more than four women so that he may fulfill his sexual obligation once a month. In a place where they are accustomed to only marry one woman they are not permitted to marry another woman. Note: it is forbidden to marry two women in two places.",
                "RABBEINU GERSHOM DECREED CHEREM for one who marries [another] in addition to his wife, but in regards to a Leverite marriage, he did not decree cherem, and such is also the case with a betrothed woman. Rema: If he doesn't want to marry another, but rather to release her, and this is the rule in any place that a mitzvah would be delayed -- for instance, if he was married to his wife for ten years and she didn't give birth (Mordechai, Perek 'Hacholetz' Rashba siman 280 and Maharam Padua Siman 19). However there are those who disagree and say that Rabbeinu Gershom's decree applies even in a case in which a mitzvah is involved, and even in the case of a Levirite marriage, and one must do Chalitza (see Hagahot Mordechai in Yebamot and Ketubot). And in the case where the first wife is not easily divorceable, e.g. she became mentally infirmed, or the husband is legally allowed to divorce her but she won't accept a Get from him, one should be more lenient and allow him to marry another (see Rashb\"a). And this case if she is betrothed and neither wants to marry him nor to be released from the betrothal. AND HIS [Rabbeinu Gershom's] DECREE was not unilaterally accepted in all the lands. Rema: Particularly in a plce where it is known that his decree wasn't unilaterally accepted, but basically it applies everywhere. See Section 14 Siman 228 for what one should do if he moved from a place where they are stringent on this ruling to a place where they are more lenient. AND HE ONLY EXTENDED THE DECREE until the end of the 5th centure (i.e. 500 years from when he said it). Rema: In any case, in all of these lands, the decree and the custom stand in their place, and we don't marry two women, and this is a punishable offense, and we force someone who did marry two wives to divorce one of them. And there are those who say that in this day and age, we shouldn't punish one who disobeys this decree because the fifth century [since it was declared] has already passed [and so it is expired], but this is not our custom. There are those who say that one whose wife refuses to accept a Get, he can serve it to her through someone else and then marry another, and this is the custom in some places. And in a place where this is not the custom, one should not be stringent, and a man may marry a second [wife] without divorcing the first.",

Nevertheless, if you see two families that always irritate one another [Isserless: or two individuals that irritate one another]or you see a family that are upholders of mitzvot and argue always or you see a man that argues disputes with everyone and especially brazen, then we should suspect their lineage and it is fitting to distance oneself from them b/c these are disqualifying characteristics. Similar a person who always invalidates others, for example he puts a stain on the lineage of families or on individuals and he says about them, that that they are mamzerim then we suspect him of being a mamzer. And if he says that they are slaves then we suspect that he is a slave. And all who invalidates others, that blemish (actually) invalidates him. And likewise he who is brazen, cruel, and hates others and he doesn't show them loving kindness we suspect him the most, lest he is gibionite (see Mishnah Torah, Isuri Biya 19:17).",

And if it is a family of priests no one may marry a women from them until they will check about her up through four generations because there are eight involved: her mother, her maternal grandmother, the mother of her maternal grandfather, the maternal grandmother of her maternal grandfather. And likewise we check the mothers of the fathers side: the mother of her paternal grandmother, the mother of her paternal grandfather, and the mother of the mother of her paternal grandfather. And if the family that was called into question is a Levite or Israelite they add to the checking of them another one and we find that they check 10 mothers.

[Isserless: There are some that say this applies only to a family that is known to blend with one of these psulim (inappropriate ones), but an individual that is called thus and keeps quiet, means nothing. There are others who say that all this (from the Mechaber) only applies to earlier generations where Beis Din would keep track of the yichus of families and appropriately apply punishments, so if someone is silent, it can be considered that he admits since he knows that the truth will be revealed. But now, silence is an indication only that he does not want to argue or fight and is thus praiseworthy, so rather today, we accept this as a sign of good yichus as long as he does not cause an argument. Others say that we do not say at all that 'silence is like an admission' and that all this only goes as a sign against the accuser himself and we question his Yichus (not the accused one). Yet, if he is trying to Possel his children in front of him and he remains silent, the silence is never considered and admission (not even by the Mechaber) although, it does raise some concern and reason to check his family. And in all cases, someone who hears troubling words about other matters (aside from Yichus) and he remains silent, this is a clear sign of proper upbringing and that he is appropriate to marry.]",

Even if you say that she is a widow maybe he is not chalal. [Isserless: And some hold this is Davka for a the widow herself, since she has a chazaka of Kashrus (having been married to a Kohen) but this does not apply to her daughter and if she is already married, he must divorce her. But, others are Maikel and make no distinction between the widow and her daughter)] But if someone who was certainly a chalal marries into a family, then every women in that family is forbidden (to a priest) until he the priest does an investigation. If she was married (without an investigation), she is then divorced. And this is also the rule if a doubtful or certain mamzer marries into a family. [Isserless: Yet all this is particularly for someone about whom it is known, but a family that is blended with (at least one known) passul that is not known to the public, for example this one or that one was tamei and the knowledge of this passul is not appropriate for public exposure, rather we assume a Hazakah of Kashrut that all the families that become tamei in Israel are Kosher in the days of the Messiah and in every place, this is kosher to reveal and demonstrates their modesty. This is davka for a family that is blended with tameiim, but any time that this tuma is not blended (and the passulim are known) then the tameiim should be revealed and publicly announced about them so that kosher people will keep away from them.]",

Note: Only if  they owe money to the kidnappers, in which case they fear to touch the woman so that they do not lose [their money] from their pocket. But if they grabbed her in order to ransom her for money, in which case there would be no out-of-pocket loss, she is forbidden to her priestly husband (Toldot Adam V'Chava / Rabbenu Yerucham chapter 23, and as suggested in Tosafot in  chapter Ain Maamidin Avoda Zara 23a).   If she was kidnapped for capital reasons, she is forbidden to the priesthood, and therefore if her husband was a priest, she is forbidden to him.   Note: Some say that if she was kidnapped for capital reasons, she is forbidden even to her Israelite husband, because we fear that she acceded to the kidnappers to save her life (Tosafot, Rosh, Tur, Ran, and Piskei Maharai chapter 92). This is only when she is accused of capital crimes and she fears dying (Hagahot Maimoni chap. 18 in the name of \"some say\"). But those captured on their husbands' account are not forbidden unless the husband was sentenced to death ( Piskei Maharai chapter 92). Some say that any place that she can presume to live by being redeemed and returned, she is not forbidden to her Israelite husband, for she does not accede [to the kidnappers] even when she is captured on her own account (ibid.). And in times of anger and widespread murder, our Rabbis permitted her to her Israelite husband, following the first approach. If she is captured by Kuthites, and Jews are coming in and out by her, she is permitted to her husband (Hagahot Maimoni chap. 18). An Israelite who became apostate along with his wife, and then both returned [to Judaism], she is permitted to him and we do not worry that she committed adultery, even if the husband was a priest. If the wife became apostate herself, she is forbidden to her husband, even an Israelite (Responsa Rashba, Hagahot Mordechai Ketuboth), unless she has [at least] one witness that she did not commit adultery, similar to a captive. And some are lenient and say that we do not worry about adultery in this case (ibid.). In times of inquisition, when people converted under threat, and then returned after the threat had passed, it is appropriate to be lenient and permit women to return even to their priestly husbands (Rosh, rule 32). If a woman vowed to convert but did not yet convert, and then retracted, she is permitted to her husband (Maharik, root 160).   Under what circumstances? When Israel rules over the Kuthites and they fear Israel, but when the Kuthites are stronger, even if [she was kidnapped] for financial matters, since it was done under the rule of the Kuthites she is forbidden [to her husband] unless someone testified on her behalf, similar to the case of a [war] captive.  Note: All this applies to one who was incarcerated at the hands of the Kuthites and under their control. But if she was alone with Kuthites, even if she owes them money, we do not forbid her for sequestering alone [with the Kuthite] even though she violated religious law. Even if a rumor of adultery circulated, all rumors after marriage are insufficient to forbid her to her husband (Responsa Rosh). However, if she sequestered with the intent of adultery, it is appropriate to be stringent (Maharik, root 160). ",

This applies to an individual expert, but a court [of three] is not suspected [of not releasing her from her vow so that one of them could marry her].

With a woman who is definitely married. However, is she is doubtfully married, or doubtfully divorced, then kiddushin is valid by doubt, and she needs a writ of divorce from both men.  The same law applies to writs of divorce which are invalid by Rabbinic decree, that if another man came and gave her kiddushin, she needs a writ of divorce from both, from the first (original husband) by Rabbinic decree, and from the second by Biblical law.

Hagah: There are those who say that this is specifically with regard to the fact that betrothal avails and she is believed and she requires a get, but she is not believed to marry someone else (Ran, ch. 2 of Ketubot in the name of \"there are those who say\") or to receive her ketubah (Hagahot Maimoniyot, ch. 2 of Divorce Laws). But there are those who disagree and hold that she is believed for all matters (Rambam).  And there are those who further say that in our time when brazenness and licentiousness are rampant, she is not believed except when the result is a stringency, for the presumption that she would not be brazen has been weakened (Bet Yosef in the name of Orah Hayyim).  But if another betrothed her not in front of her husband, the betrothal is not valid until she brings proof that she was divorced from her husband before she accepted her betrothal. For any woman not in front of her husband will act brazenly.  And the Rosh wrote that in any case when the husband is in the city when the other betrothed her, this is considered \"in his presence.\" But there are those who disagree and hold that she must actually be in his presence (Maharik, root 72 and Ribash siman 127).  And that which we say: A woman would not be so brazen as to say in front of her husband, \"You divorced me\" is only in a case where there is no one to support her, but if there is someone to support her, she will certainly be brazen. And if she is married to another when she is not in her husband's presence, even if she says to her husband when he arrives, \"You divorced me,\" she is not believed for since she has already been married [to the second] one, she will certainly be brazen, so that she doesn't make herself into a prostitute. And there is one who says that even if she had not yet been married to another but had been betrothed to him while not in her husband's presence, and then her husband comes and she says to him, \"You divorced me,\" she is not believed. And there are those who say that if there was some strife between them, or if she has asked for her ketubah, she is not believed to say: \"You divorced me,\" even in his presence.  There are those who say that if she is believed to remarry, she also collects her ketubah (Maharik, root 72 and Ribash, siman 127).

But if the witness or woman or witness said: \"So-and-so died, and I saw him die,\" we ask him: \"How did you see, and how do you know [he died]?\"  If he testifies clearly in the matter, he is believed.

Note: If he heard professional weepers who mentioned his name among the dead and eulogized him, we allow the wife to remarry (so wrote Magid Mishna in the name of Tosefta). Therefore we caution women not to eulogize someone on the basis of accepted suppositions (i.e. circumstantial evidence) that a man died, and not to weep for him until we know [certainly] that he died.  Similarly, his wife is forbidden to mourn him or to wear black clothes as long as there is no definitive evidence sufficient to allow her to remarry (logical derivation of the Rav, and so writes Rivash chaper 508).  Similarly no court should give a writ of testimony to a woman as to what the witnesses testified in front of them, if that testimony is insufficient to allow her to remarry, unless the explicitly write why they did not permit her to remarry on the basis of that testimony, for we worry of potential pitfalls which may occur with inexpert courts (ibid. in Responsa Rivash).",

However, if he fell into the sea and they threw a net and pulled out a single leg from the knee up, or the like, we will not allow his wife to remarry, for I say: \"that was the leg of someone else\" However, if there was a very distinct sign on the leg, we rely on it, saying that it is the leg of the man who fell.

Note: Even if a court permitted her to remarry, but she has not yet remarried, she may not remarry (Rivash chapter 379).   If she remarried on the basis of this testimony, she does not require divorce.  Note: Only is she remarried on the ruling of a wise man or by mistake, that she thought she was permitted to remarry. But if she purposely transgressed and remarried, she must undergo divorce (Responsa Moharam, brought in Hagahot Mordechai end of tractate Yevamot).

But if they testified that he was on a boat breaking up in the sea or something similar, or even if the testified that he drowned but they did not testify that he stayed underwater for a time that would cause death, then she must divorce.

Even if it was a Kuthite (non-Jew) conversing innocently who said, \"So-and-so drowned,\" and she married on this basis, she does not need to undergo divorce.

Note: Nevertheless, because of the risk of slander she should not remarry (Tur).  However, if the second witness came before the court permitted her to remarry, she is not permitted to remarry, and if she did remarry, she must divorce, because it is doubtful.  If she married the witness who testified that her [previous] husband had died, and she says, \"It is clear to me that he died,\" she need not divorce. But some authorities say that [even in this latter case] she must divorce. If two witnesses came forward and said, \"He did not die,\" even if she already remarried, all authorities agree that she must divorce.    Note: This applies when she is silent, but if she says, \"He died,\" it is considered as two witnesses (i.e. the wife and her supporting witness, c.f. Bet Shmuel) against two witnesses as long as all the witnesses are women.  But the husband who married is not considered as reliable for himself [against the two subsequent witnesses] (Nimukei Yosef, chapter haIsha Kamma).    What are the circumstances of this ruling? When the single witness upon whose word she remarried can be considered as two witnesses against the two witnesses who later came and contradicted, as in the case where she remarried on the word of an adult male who was contradicted by two adult males saying, \"He did not die;\" or she remarried on the word of an adult female or her own assertion, and two subsequent female witnesses or two Rabbinically invalid male witnesses came and said, \"He did not die.\"  But if a kosher (valid adult male) witness said, \"He died,\" and numerous women said, \"He did not die,\" or invalid male witnesses said, \"He did not die,\" this is viewed as half against half.  Note: This applies when the witnesses arrived together before the court permitted her to remarry on the testimony of the first witness. But if the court had permitted her to remarry on the testimony of the kosher witness, and then the invalid witnesses arrived, she is not removed from her permission to remarry (Tur).  If she married one of her witnesses, and she says, \"It is clear to me that he died,\" she does not need to divorce.

But if he stipulated with her that she cohabit with someone forbidden to her, that's called \"impossible to fulfill\" since the other person won't want her (ibid). But if he stipulated with her that so-and-so will give him his courtyard, or marry his daughter to his son, that's called \"possible to fulfill\" since she can give a lot of money to so-and-so until he wants the matter (this too ibid). And see later on Siman 143:12.",
                "If he stipulated with her at the time of the marriage that she will not have food and clothing, his condition is established and he's not obligated in them to her. But if aahe stipulated that he won't be obligated in \"time\" (marital relations), his condition is void and he's obligated in it. Rama: Since anyone who stipulates against that which is written in the Torah, and it's not monetary, his condition is void (Rama's own opinion). And some say that anything the Rabbis decreed is as if it was written in the Torah (the note of the Mordechai).",

If he said, \"on the condition that I will give you a manah during the next 30 days,\" the betrothal takes effect retroactively if he gave it to her during the 30 days.  If he did not give it to her during the 30 days, she is not betrothed.  If she accepted betrothal from another during the 30 days, she is partially betrothed to him during the 30 days.  After the 30 days passed, if the first man did not fulfill his condition, his betrothal is removed and the second betrothal is finalized, and she does not need a writ of divorce from the first.  If the first man did fulfill his condition she does not need a writ of divorce from the second.",

And there is no difference whether the witness says she was married in front of him alone, or if he says she was married in front of two and he alone saw, and the others say they didn't see (Beit Yosef, and similarly it's implied in the Responsa of the Rashb\"a).

And [this is true] only if she said that she only intended to play, but if she denies that she accepted at all, and the witnesses testify that she accepted, she can no longer say, \"I intended to play,\" and it is a betrothal (Mahara\"m Padawa - Siman 32).",
                "Marriage in front of witnesses, even if he didn't say, \"You are witness\", the marriage is effected. Rama: Even if witnesses were specified, others can see the act and testify (Rivash Siman 479). The witnesses need to see the actual giving to her hand or her property. But if they didn't see the actual giving to her hand, even though they heard him say, \"Marry me with this certain object,\" and after ward she walks out with it under her hand, it is not a marriage until they see the actual giving (Responsa Rashba Siman 680). One cannot go after guesses and logical proofs in this regard. One who marries through a hole in the wall, such as she stretching her hand through a hole and someone comes along and puts into it [an object for] marriage, and the hole is narrow, and it is impossible to see the moment of marriage, and she says she didn't hear that she was being married, she is believed since she could have said [a better claim] that it wasn't her hand but it was someone else's (Rashba 1179), as long as there aren't witnesses which prove her wrong. Any testimony that cannot be examined in a court of law is not considered testimony for marriage [either] (Inferred from the Mordecha at the beginning of laws of money). Therefore, even if witnesses say outside of a court of law that she is married, the court of law can respond to them saying \"She is NOT married.\" And so too the opposite case (Responsa Rashba brought by the Bet Yosef). Marriage witnesses do not need to be scrutinized and inspected if there is no reason to suspect trickery (Rashba 1209). If they find it wrotten in the document, \"A certain man married a certain woman\" and witnesses signed it, when the document no longer available, the marriage is not suspected (Hagahot Mordechai to Kiddushin). And it is not like those who are stringent about the matter (Makarik Shoresh 74).",

But witnesses who are invalid on a rabbinical level, or the witnesses are invalid according to the Torah on a doubtful level, if he wants to enter [into marriage] he should go back and marry with kosher witnesses. If she does not want to enter, he needs to give a divorce document for the doubt. Even if the woman denies and says, \"I was not wedded,\" we force him to give a divorce document. So is the law with all marriages of dount, if she wants to enter he goes back and marries definitively, and if she does not want to enter she needs a divorce document from him because of doubt. And if another comes and marries her, she is now married to the second on a doubtful level, and she needs a divorce document from both of them, or the first one must divorce and she can marry the second. But to divorce the second and marry the first, no. Rama: Someone who is suspected of sexual impropriety (arayot), even if there is no witnesses of the sexual act, but it is just a suspicion (Tosafot and the Rosh), he is invalid for testimony for woman's issues, whether for marriage or divorce (Rambam). Someone who marries using witnesses who are invalid on a Torah level because of their wickedness, such as in front of rapists or other wicked people, some say the marriage is suspected to have taken effectm for perhaps they repented (R\"Y Mintz Siman 11, and so in Orchot Chaim in the name of Rashi). And some are lenient (Bet Yosef, and Maharam Padawa Siman 37). However, those who are forced to convert through fear [of reprisal], and they cannot get out of it, but in hiding keep the commandments, they are kosher witnesses (Rivash Siman 11). Some say that that which we say that one who marries using those who are invalid witnesses on a rabbinical level are suspected to have effected the marriage, this is for a Torah-level marriage, but a rabbinical marriage, and the witnesses are invalid on a rabbincal level, the marriage is not suspected as haven taken effect at all (Bet Yosef in the name of the Harashbetz in a Responsa)."

[and the witnesses] saw gifts, we do not worry [about possible marriage]. Rashi explained that the doubt regarding gifts was that the gifts themselves may have constituted the kiddushin money.\n\nRama: And therefore even if there are witnesses that she has not been previously married, we would worry [according to Rashi] that the gifts were kiddushin money.  It is appropriate to be concerned for both interpretations, and to rule stringently (Tur).  This is the rule if the gifts were sent without explanation.  However if he said explicitly that the gifts were pre-wedding presents, we do not need to be concerned with Rashi's explanation (Ran, Kiddushin chapter 2). And certainly if  he said that he merely sent a gift (unrelated to marriage), and even if he said that the groom had sent a gift to the bride-to-be (Maharik, root 171).  And these concerns are only an issue when  he (the groom) had made shiduchin (engagement contract, prior to kiddushin), but if there was no shiduchin, we do not worry about these possibilities (of gifts indicating actual marriage) (Responsa Rashba, part 1, number 1,123).  In situations where we are concerned, even if both parties said that there was no intention of marriage (Ran and Maharik root 28), and swore to this effect, they are not believed (Terumat haDeshen, chapter 207).  Some authorities say that all gifts sent immediately after shidduchin, or one or two days afterward, there is no concern for these at all.  Even if he [the groom] sent additional gifts after this, since he also sent her gifts immediately after the shidduchin we see that his intention was to send gifts and perform kiddushin only afterward and we do not worry about the gifts (Maharik root 171). The concern regarding gifts is only to require a get (divorce) a priori, but if she already married (another man), she does not need to leave the second man and we take the lenient approach in this case of doubt (ibid).  Some authorities say that if he sent her gifts without witnesses, we do not worry about the opinion of Rashi that the gifts are the actual kiddushin money, and even according to the opinion that where marriage took place with one witness we are concerned about possible valid kiddushin, in the case of gifts there is no concern (Maharik roots 28, 101, and 171). Some authorities are stringent where he sent gifts with witnesses even if they did not witness the transfer of the gifts to the woman (Terumat haDeshen chapter 207). Some authorities limit the concern to cases where the bride accepted the gifts directly, but in places where it is customary that the brides do not accept the gifts directly except via an intermediary, there is no concern of gifts indicating marriage (Maharik root 171).  Some authorities do not differentiate whether the groom sent her gifts (through an intermediary) or gave them to her directly, and this is the primary interpretation (Responsa Rosh 180 and 189), as opposed to one who is stringent and rules that where the groom gave the gifts directly we always are concerned for possible marriage (Responsa Rav Maharash). Some say that in situations where we might be concerned that he would have transgressed by sending gifts had it been his intention to accomplish kiddushin with the gifts, as in a case where he sent the gifts on the Sabbath (Maharik root 171), or there is a decree enforced by cherem (social excommunication) forbidding marriage except in the presence of 10 men (Beit Yosef in the name of Ritva), then we are not concerned that the gifts may have constituted the actual wedding money.  If the groom did not send gifts himself, but the father of the groom sent gifts (Rivash chapter 479), then we do not worry about the opinion of Rashi that the gifts constituted the actual wedding money, even if the messenger stated, \"The groom has sent you [these gifts].\"  All of the preceding applies only where we know certainly that gifts were sent, but if there is only a rumor of gifts being sent, we do not worry about possible marriage (Piskei Maharai chapter 226).",

If it was not customary in a city, such as  the case of a new city, we judge it 50/50 (Ran Chapter 2 of Kiddushin). Some say that there is what to be stringent even in a place where everyone sends gifts and then proposes later, unless there is a reason to permit it in a particular case (Terumat Hadeshen Siman 207, and in his rulings Siman 74). It seems to me that if the groom said he only sent the gifts as plain gifts, nobody should suspect of it [that it caused the marriage to take effect]. And it happens all the time, that sometimes the marriage arrangement doesn't go through, and the gifts are returned, and the custom is not to require a divorce document [on the suspicion the marriage took place through the gifts], and this occurs in places today where everyone exchanges gifts and then proposes later, and the groom never said he sent it for the sake of marriage.",

But for everything else, she is still considered married.

This is the same law if he [the husband] did not write the <i>ketubah </i>. Nevertheless, initially, it should be written beforehand. \nA woman who is sick with a deathly illness, even though she entered with the bed under the <i>chuppah </i> so that her husband would inherit her, it is not considered a <i>chuppah </i> since she is not fitting for relations, so her husband does not inherit her (Responsa of the R\"SH, rule 54). \nShe entered the <i>chuppah </i> and he did not make the bridegroom blessing, it is a complete <i>chuppah </i> sine blessings do not prevent and he can eventually make the blessing (Tur Siman 62). Initially, he should bless her before he secludes himself with her (this is implicit in the R\"SH's responsa). See earlier siman 55.Nowadays, we customarily recite the blessing under the <i>chuppah </i> before he secludes himself with her. \nIt is customary that the bride and the groom fast the day of the <i>chuppah </i> (see Orach Chaim siman 573).\nIf he mistakenly engaged her, and he had the marriage ceremony with her, and afterwards it was found out that the engagement was a mistake, even though he returned and engaged her, he does not need to make a second <i>sheva brachot </i>, it is enough with the first blessings. \nThere are those who say to make a <i>chuppah </i> under the sky as a good sign that their children will be like the stars of the heaven. \n\n\n",

Note: See Yoreh Deah chapter 294 and 305 for the value of a dirhem coin.

Other authorities opine that we write, \"...that you deserve\" (Hagahot Maimoni, Hilchot Ishut chapter 10). The custom is that for a virgin we write, \"...that you deserve by Biblical law, \" but not for a widow.

Other items, however, are not treated similarly to the Ketubah, as is explained later.  In some places the groom may add to the Ketubah and write [an amount] greater than that which he received.  In such cases we follow local practice.  The standard rule is that the level of responsibility assumed over the dowry is that of 'iron sheep property' (i.e., the husband must return the principal in full), but if he wishes to leave the property rights with his wife and to not assume responsibility for it, he may do so.  See (beginning of Shulchan Arukh, Even HaEzer 93 and Shulchan Arukh, Even HaEzer 100 for more on this subject).  When the father is alove and marries off his daughter, we write, \"this is the dowry that has been bestowed with her from her father's house\"; if the father is not alive, we write, \"from the house of marriage.\" Sill, if they change it, it is not an issue.  In the Ketubah of a divorcee we write, \"divorce\" so that we know that she is a divorcee and may not marry a Kohen.  When the time comes for her to collect the Ketubah, we collect whatever amount is customary in that place.  Rem\"a: If she says that [her husband] added more than the standard practice, she must provide proof for her claim.  If, however, she produces a Ketubah contract that has not been properly verified, or if one of the signatories is not qualified to testify, even though she shows us the pre-marital contract that committed him to adding to the Ketubah, she is only entitled to collect according to the standard practice.  See (Shulchan Arukh, Even HaEzer 100:30).   In all these matters and those similar to them, the primary determinant is the local practice, and on that basis we form our judgement, provided that the practice is poplar throughout the region.  Rem\"a: Nevertheless, if he wishes to create a condition with his wife that [obligates him] in less than the standard practice, he may do so, provided that he does not go below the amount that was prescribed by the Sages.  It seems to me that it is necessary for him to set the condition at the time of engagement.  If, however, they engage without specifying, and they obligated themselves in [the usual] financial penalties, he must write [the Ketubah] according the standard practice and he has no right to change it.  In some places the local practice is to write every Ketubah identically, even if she brings nothing into the marriage, and if he wishes, he may add something, and if he wishes to reduce the amount, she must write to him, \"I have already received such-and-such amount from my Ketubah.\"  This is the practice in our countries.",

Note: Some authorities say that if he wants to divorce her immediately and give her ketuba, we do not add on to the ketuba (so it appears in Rambam Hilchot Ishut chapter 14).

                "A woman who refused to have sexual relations with her husband is called \"rebellious\"/moredet; she is asked why she rebelled. If she says: I despise him and cannot knowingly have sex with him--Rem\"a: and specifically seeks a get without her dower--but if she says: he should give me a get and my dower, we suspect that she has her eyes on another, she has the status of a moredet who wishes to torment him (Beit Yosef citing Responsa Ran; Rashi's commentary on the Talmud)--if the husband wishes to divorce her, she does not receive her dower at all. She may take her extant worn clothes, whether they are among the assets that she brought [into the marriage] for her husband and he is responsible for them, or whether they are milog assets for which he is responsible; she takes nothing of her husband's. Even if she took the shoes on her feet or the kerchief on her head, she removes them and gives them to him. Anything he gave her as a gift, she returns. Some say that she does not even get the tzon barzel assets, except for whatever she seized. And some say that she does not even get the milog assets except for whatever she seized (Beit Yosef citing Responsa Ran in the name of Rashba). If she rebelled against her husband in order to torment him, and says: \"I am tormenting him thus because he did such-and-such to me,\" or \"because he cursed me,\" or \"because he fought with me,\" or the like, we send her away from the court and tell her: \"Know that if you continue your rebelliousness, you will lose even the 100 mana of your dower.\" Then they make proclamations about her every day in the synagogues and study halls for four weeks--Rem\"a: some say that the proclamations need not be made every day, but only on Shabbat (Ran and Hagahot Maimuniyot, and it is also implied by Tur), and this seems to be the predominant opinion--saying: \"This woman so-and-so rebelled against her husband.\" After the proclamation she is sent to the court a second time: \"If you continue your rebellion, you will lose your dower.\" If she continued rebelling and did not return, she is advised that she will lose her dower, and will not have any dower at all. She is not granted a get until 12 months have passed, and she gets no alimony all 12 months--Rema: even if she is pregnant (Beit Yosef citing Responsa Rashba); yet what she produces belongs to her, though he gets usufruct (Tur).  If she dies before receiving the get, her husband inherits her--Rem\"a and is obligated to redeem her [if she is captured] and bury her (Tur). After 12 months, her husband has no duties toward her, nor she to her husband. Since she caused the loss of her dower, she gets none of her prenuptial stipulations [for rights within the marriage], since he may divorce her without giving the dower, but retains her at his will (Divrei Harav, also implies by Maharin no. 20).  This is the routine prescribed if she rebelled in order to torment him.  Rem\"a: After 12 months, it does not matter if she returns to him. Rather, she has lost her dower, and if he wishes to retain her, he must write another. However, within 12 months she may return to him and is entitled to her dower. If he dies within the 12 months, she gets her dower from his inheritors (Ran on Ketubot ch. 5). If he wishes to divorce her within the 12 months, he gives her the tzon barzel assets, her dower, and everything that he stipulated to give her (Beit Yosef citing Responsa Rashba). Some say that nowadays, since one may not marry two wives, we do not wait twelve months if he wishes to divorce her. If she does not want to divorce, we allow him to marry another woman (Mordechai at the end of Ketubot ch. 5, citing Raavan). Some disagree, stating that he must not be permitted to marry a second woman (ibid. in the glosses; Responsa Rashba no. 860; Maharik no. 63). This is the predominant position. This all applies to a married woman. A betrothed woman, however, who rebels against her husband and refuses to move into his home may be divorced against her will. Alternatively, he may marry another woman, and is given permission to do so (ibid.). It seems to me that this all applies within 12 months. After 12 months, if he wishes to divorce her, she must accept the get even against her will, or else he is permitted to marry another woman, for a woman does not have the power to chain him forever. This seems correct to be the correct ruling. Some say that even within 12 months, if he transgressed and married another woman due to [the first wife's] rebelliousness, we do not compel him to divorce [the second woman] (Maharik no. 29).  Even if she was a menstruant or ill, and thus unavailable for sexual relations--Rem\"a: and there is no difference whether she began her rebellion before or after she took ill (Ran on Ketubot ch. 5; also implied by Mordechai citing Raavyah and by Hagahot Alfasi), but some disagree (idib., citing Maharam)--or even if her husband was a seaman with a six-month season, and even if he has another wife. Similarly, a betrothed woman whose time came to consummate that marriage, and she rebelled to torment him and did not consummate, is considered sexually rebellious. Some say that even a sister-in-law who does not wish to consummate levirate marriage in order to torment [the brother-in-law] is subject to this prescription.",
                "This rebellious woman, when she is divorced after 12 months without her dower, she must return everything that belongs to the husband. However, if she seized assets that she brought into the marriage and her extant worn clothes, we do not confiscate them from her. Rem\"a: She takes real estate tzon barzel assets (Tur).  Similarly, if anything that has been lost of her assets for which the husband is responsible, he need not repay her anything.  Rem\"a: This all applies to tzon barzel assets. But milog assets are hers. She owns them and takes them (Tur). Some say that all this applies when she gives no rationale or excuse for why she claims to despise him. However, when she gives a rationale for her words, for example, she says that he acts improperly, wastes his money, or the like, then we rule in accordance with the enactment of the Geonim (Tur citing Maharam of Rotherburg). This is called \"dina de-metivta\": The husband must return everything that she brought him in her dowry, i.e., tzon barzel assets if they are extant and fit for their initial use; and certainly if they were stolen or lost the husband must pay for it all. Milog assets are hers if they or something that exists by virtue of them is extant, and she takes them. But if they are entirely gone, the husband need not repay (Dina De-mitivta; Tur citing Rif). However, she does not take anything he gave her or contracted to give her, and even if she seized it she must return it (Mordechai, Ketubot ch. 5). He is not compelled to divorce, nor is she compelled to remain with him (Tur citing Responsa Maharam). If he acted improperly, e.g., he betrothed her with lies and guile, we compel him to divorce (Rosh no. 35). Some further say that we impose excommunication (Tur, citing Maharam). If people coached her to rebel, or if she did so out of anger or strife, or to take his money, then even if she seized her own assets, we confiscate them from her and return them to her husband (Mordechai, Ketubot ch. 5). It makes no difference whether or not she seized them unless she claims to despise him but does not give a substantiated rationale, though if she gave a rationale and it is not deceitful the court may decide this at their discretion (Mahari Weil no. 20). They may administer an oath to ascertain the truth of her claim to despise him (ibid.), and this is the proper ruling. As long as he has not given her a get, he has no hold or claim on her, but she should nevertheless not give what is hers to others, and he may even protest, since if she dies he inherits her (ibid.). Even in a case where we compel him to divorce his rebellious wife, if she dies before he divorces her, he inherits her, for her inheritance is only released by divorce (Tur citing a Gaon). If her father seized some of the dowry she brought for her husband, it is as effective as if she had seized it herself (Mordechai on Ketubot ch. 5 citing Responsa Maharam; Hagahot citing Responsa Maharam). The clothing brought by the bride do not have the status of tzon barzel assets. Tzon barzel assets are only the appraised assets that the woman brings [into the marriage] for her husband (Tur citing Rosh).",

She and I are together in the manner of the whole world: we first excommunicate the one who rebels and does not admit it in court.

If he borrowed with a loan document, she says the money was not hidden, and he says that the loan money had been hidden, she must bring proof that the money was not hidden, or he is exempt from paying (Nimukei Yosef chapter Chezkat haBatim in Bava Bathra).

Some authorities say that if she buys and sells within the house the husband is believed and the [buyer or lender] must return the items to the husband even without repayment (Rabbenu Yerucham, path 23). It seems to me that this applies only to circumstances in which it is not typical for her to collateralize or sell without the permission of her husband, but if this is typical for her, what is done is done, and so it should be taught.

And similar if she owed taxes and married, it is like the case of the sender of bridal gifts, because these are subject to a leniency because there is no way to produce written agreements about them, and so we treat them as if they were loans that did have written agreements (Maharam of Padua, section 95).  But tort damages and negotiated business debts and other things, he is not obliged to pay (Nimukei Yosef, the chapter \"Some inherit\").  A woman who arranged a marriage for her daughter to a man and committed to a dowry, and later herself married: the daughter's prospective husband may claim what the mother committed to from her husband against the assets she brought to the marriage, just as if it were a loan with a written agreement; even though at the time that she arranged her daughter's marriage she had not yet  engaged the vows of her ketubah, still since she eventually engage that vow, we consider her words even out of the order they happened, since what she did originally was justified. (Beit Yoseph quoting a responsum of the Rashba).  Some say since it is as if it was a written loan we collect from the husband out of the assets she brought to the marriage, that is, if she brought him real property or movable property and wrote a debt to her husband of the movable property against the value of the real property; but if she did not write about it, and only brought the movable property to the marriage, even one who had loaned her money with a written agreement may not collect it from her husband, as a debt-holder may not seize movables that are already subordinated (responsum of Nachmanides paragraph 56).  And it is logically reasonable.  And it is apparently a reasonable negogiation, since in propertly she brought to the marriage but that she doesn't hold title to, for example if she took more than her holding in the ketubah, he must in any case return it.

Rem\"a:  See the details of this rule in (Shulchan Arukh, Choshen Mishpat 108).  Some authorities say that though her heirs do not inherit her Ketubah, this is only true is she did not seize it.  If she did seize it, the heirs do inherit it because the properties are possessed.  Other authorities dispute this.  See (Shulchan Arukh, Choshen Mishpat 108).  If the heirs say, \"she took an oath,\" they must provide proof.  If they paid part of her Ketubah and produced a contractual debt on the remainder, her heirs inherit this debt even though she took no oath.   A widow that became mute and hinted before her death that she had not collected anything, this is sufficient to be considered an oath.  Rem\"a: If a woman became mute and was subsequently widowed, her heirs may not collect her Ketubah because she is unable to take the oath.  See (Shulchan Arukh, Even HaEzer 105:3). If however, she was divorced and then died, her heirs may take the oath, \"that we were not commanded [*verify*].\"  They may even collect form his heirs, if he died after her.",

And some say that the court must collect it for her.\n\nNote: And some say that even in movable property [cases] her sale or gift is void, despite her having sworn at the end, because she did not swear at the beginning. And some say that the judge should decide according to his discretion (Mordochai, chapter \"One who writes\"), because where the judge concludes that she has not been seized by troubles, such as [her husband's] having died suddenly or such, it may be right to judge that her sale or gift stand (Rosh, rule 85).  And similarly if the receiver or buyer are well-established and it seems right to him to such this way. And all of this is when the woman retracted [her agreement to the transaction] after she swore, but if she has not retracted, her sale and gift stand ab initio (Maharik, root 18); and therefore a widow who did not swear against her ketubah, and marries bringing to her new marriage much wealth from her first husband, should still swear.

If the orphans wish her to take a vow (of abstinence - instead of an oath; vow = \"neder\"], she vows what they request, and they administer the vow in court and she collects her ketuba monies. The vow must forswear something that results in personal (fleshly) hardship, and must be lifelong.

For at the moment she takes the oath, her oath becomes false. Rem\"a: She must swear before three who are fit [to be judges]; if she swore before three who are relatives, she must take another oath (Beit Yosef, citing Responsa Rashba and Responsa Maharam at the end of Hafla'ah). She should preferably take the oath in the presence of the orphans, but if she swore away from their presence, or if the orphans do not want to be present for the oath, we accept her oath outside their presence (Rashba ibid.).

By decree of the Geonim, they can be collected even from movable property.  This is also true for all of the conditions of the marriage, other than the document of the male sons [a document stating that a woman's sons from prior marriages will inherit from her current husband].  Therefore, therefore, if the inheritors collected money while in their father's debt, [the wife] may collect from them.  However, the inheritors may remove her [from the movable property] by giving her land (R' Alfas).  This applies only to free movable property [i.e. movable property in his possession], but if the husband sold them or gave them as a gift while healthy, she may not collect from them.\nRem\"a:  There are those who say that this applies only if the husband gave them to others, but if he gave them to his inheritors as a gift while healthy, his wife may collect her marriage contract from them (Hagahot Maimoni 16, Mahara\"i 96, Mahari\"v 156), as anything he gave to the inheritors was given only as an inheritance, and his wife may collect her marriage contract from there (Mordekhai citing Mohara\"m).  Someone who commanded that his belongings be given to another after his death, even though he gave the command while healthy, his wife may collect her marriage contract from there, for it is considered to be the gift of one who is deathly ill, from which a wife may collect her marriage contract (viz. Choshen HaMishpat 251, 252, and 257).\nIf the inheritors sold them after his death, she may collect from them.  Nowadays our custom is to write in all marriage contracts that she has a lien on all his property--land, movable objects, and movable objects acquired via land--which he has and will acquire.  Nonetheless, our custom is not to collect from movable property sold by the inheritors due to the decree of the market.  See Choshen Mishpat 113.

They are not collected from the betterments made to the property after his death, regardless of whether the betterments were made by the inheritors or by the buyers who she comes to repossess. They are only collected from the possessions [of the late husband], not from potential assets. Rem\"a: If a father willed a gift to be given to his son after two or three years, or willed that he not be given his portion of the inheritance for two or three years, the property is considered \"potential,\" not \"possessed,\" and the son's wife may not collect her dower from it (Mahar\"i Weil no. 40). Some say that if Jacob dies while his son Reuben is alive, and he left a widow who is supported by his estate, Reuben's widow does not collect her dower from those assets, since they are subordinated to his father's widow upon Reuben's death (Mordechai). This is only if the inheritors have no right to clear the widow's alimony [with a lump sum payment], but if they can pay off the widow, Reuben's widow may collect from there (ibid.). Work wages that never reached his hands are called \"potential\" (Mordechai on Bava Batra). If an object of his was stolen, then he died, and the stolen object was then recovered, it is considered \"possessed\" (Responsa Maharam). \n\nA loan due to the husband is considered \"possessed,\" and she may collect from it, even if the debtor is a Samaritan.

If the currency of the place where they divorced was more valuable than the currency of the place they wed, he gives her the currency of the place they wed. This is specifically if the value of the money he makes available for her collection is two hundred and one hundred. But less than that, he may not.

Where it is normal to write a dower contract, but where they do not normally write a dower contract and rather rely on court stipulation, she collects the main part of her dower even though she does not have her dower contract, whether she was widowed or divorced. Rem\"a: If there are witnesses that her dower contract was lost or incinerated, even a place where they normally write a contract is akin to a place where they do not write a contract (Hagahot Alfasi on Ketubot). Some say that even where they normally write a dower contract she collects her dower without a contract, and they have no credibility to claim that they paid it off (Tur, citing R\"i). This is not only for the main part of the dower, but even the part that it is customary to add in all places (Mordechai and Responsa Maymuni, end of Laws of Marriage). This seems to be the rationale of later authorities as well (Maharik nos. 18 and 114; Mahara\"i no. 229). But in our countries it is not customary to collect without a dower contract, and according to all if there is no clear custom, even if she has her dower contract but it is not court-validated, she cannot collect anything (Mahara\"i ibid, Mahar\"i Weil no. 113, Mahari\"k no. 18). However, if the widow seized it and she has a strong claim based on the fact that she could have denied the assets, she is believed when she says that he added to her dower (Mahar\"i Weil no. 232). See above section 66. Some say that if she already married another, she no longer has credibility to collect without her dower contract (Mordechai). In any case where she has credibility, she must swear that she was not already paid. In cases where she has no credibility, if the husband is alive he must swear that he paid her [dower]. If he is not alive, the orphans are exempt [from paying her] even without an oath (Divrei Harav, also implied by Tur).

Rama: if the [male] orphans have not yet collected (Tur).  Mechaber: ... and from expected income. If the brothers wished to give her money instead of the one tenth share of the land itself, they may do so. Rama: It is only the collection that is limited to real estate, but when the estate is assessed to calculate the tenth, the entire estate is assessed, including movables, and then one tenth [of the entire estate] is collected from the real estate.

If there were creditors, and the sons wished to pay them off with lands, and the daughters say that they should be paid off with movables so that the lands will remain in the hands of the [male] orphans, and the daughters will take their tenth from the orphans, the law sides with the sons (Mordechai chapter Metziat haIsha in the name of Responsa Moharam).

Some authorities disagree and say that they may even increase over 10% (Tur in the name of Gaonim).

Rama: The decree of the \"Shu\"m\" communities (Speyer, Worms, and Mayence) which are accepted custom nowadays with respect to the dowries of grooms, as explained supra end of chapter 53, some authorities say that the decree was promulgated only with respect to dowry, but not with respect to inheritance received by the woman while married to him (Responsa Rosh rule 54), and similarly with respect to gifts given to the groom. At the time that the properties are returning as per the guidelines of the decree, some say that they return to the grantors of the dowry (Responsa Maimoni to Hilchot Ishut, and so implied in the language of the decree), and some say that the properties fall to the heirs (Responsa Maimoni #35), and this [latter rule] is the custom of our communities. There is no difference whether the father gives the dowry or others grant the dowry (Terumat haDeshen chapter 321). But with respect to women who bring in the dowry [from their own property], they did not make this decree (Mahariv 64). Every place there is a custom, we follow the custom. Even if they did not explicitly make the [customary] conditions at the time of the marriage, it is as if they did make the conditions, for all who marry, do so with the understanding that they will follow the local customs (Rama's own opinion, and so also in Responsa Rashba chapter 1307 and Responsa Maimoni end of Ishut #35). Even if he went to a place which does not follow the customs of the [Shu\"m] communities, we follow the customs prevalent in the locale in which the marriage took place (Rivash chapter 105). If the son or daughter did not die a natural death but were murdered or became apostate, some say that in these circumstances the rule of grooms does not apply in these circumstances, and even if the father did not already give the dowry he must still do so (according to GR\"A this is referring to the customs described in Even haEzer siman 53:3). But if there is no viable issue that the money needs to return according to the decree [of Shu\"m] there is no difference whether they were murdered or died, but if they became apostate, the monies do not need to be returned.

If we have previous knowledge that the slave belonged to the husband, yet the slave with the tattooed get is in her possession, and she says, \"It was delivered to me before witnesses,\" she is doubtfully divorced, for maybe the slave just came to her of his own accord.

He should etch the lines before he starts to write the get. He should etch from the sides, and the lines of the get should be equal, not one long and one short. If he did not etch lines at all, it is valid. Likewise, if he made more or less than 12 lines [it is valid] (this is all in Seder Gittin, also in Mordechai beginning of Tractate Gittin). Some say that we should not validate them (gets with atypical number of lines)  except where we are worried about \"anchoring\" (leaving the woman unable to remarry), that the agent arrived from a distant land and caravans are uncommon.  It seems to me that the same rule applies to etching lines. He must start the etched lines outside the text (Beit Yosef in the name of Kuntres and in Seder Gittin).  He should write the get on the flesh side of the parchment and not the skin side.  If he wrote it on the skin side, some invalidate the get (Maharil). It seems to me that if there is a fear of anchoring, we should not be stringent.  When the scribe writes, it is preferable that he should be careful not to touch (i.e. to write) the etching at the sides.  It is customary ex-ante to leave a space of 1/2 finger on the sides, and one whole finger on the top (Seder Gittin), and at the bottom space to grasp with the hand (Maharil) or more (Rama's own opinion).",

                "The text should not be twisted or contorted such that one letter can be confused with another and as a result the meaning will change.  Rama: If the feet of the heh and the kuf touch together, it is invalid even ex post facto (Terumat haDeshen chapter 236 and in his rulings chapter 45). However, if a minor can read the text, some authorities still validate when there is a concern for anchoring (putting her in limbo of not married, but not able to remarry) the woman (Maharik root 71).  At the outset it is forbidden to separate [the feet of the letters] with a knife, but he should write another get (ibid. root 98). But only where there is no concern for anchoring, but in times of oppression in which there is a concern for anchoring, he may fix the print (opinion of Rama), and see Orach Chaim chapter 32 how to correct. See chapter 126 se'if 48.  If he needs to fix letters that do not touch in places where they should touch, or they are short and need to be lengthened, he should fix them before he writes (at the end of the get) the words \"k'dat Moshe v'Yisrael\" (Hagahot Seder Gittin, a tradition from Mahariv, and so I also found written in the name of Maharam Meor Einayim); or he should at least fix the letters before the witnesses sign (Maharam Padua). He should be careful that everything that needs to touch does touch, and things that should not touch do not touch, just as in writing a scroll of Torah, tefillin, and mezzuzot (Seder Gittin, and so implied in Hagahot Mordechai Gittin). If letters that should be touching are not touching, such as the yud of the tzadi (facing rightward) or the yud of the aleph, and other similar letters, some authorities say that even if a young child who is neither wise nor stupid can still read it, is is nevertheless invalid even ex post facto (Terumat haDeshen and in his rulings chapter 43).  Some authorities say that where there is a concern for anchoring the woman, it is appropriate to validate in such a case.  If the error is in the \"tofes\" (form text of the get except for names, date, place) it is appropriate to be lenient even when there is no concern for anchoring (Beit Yosef). If he wrote the lamed and aleph of Yisrael together as a single letter (this is a common contraction), some say that it is valid if it was in the tofes of the get (Responsa Rosh), and where there is a concern for anchoring, it is appropriate to be lenient. If the anterior point of the yud on the aleph also touches in front, it is still valid (found written in the name of Mahari Maribor = R. Israel Isserlein, author of Terumat haDeshen). If the letters spread out because of wateriness of the ink that is called \"Giplasen\", so that it appears that the letter may be touching but it can be seen that they are not actually touching, it is valid (found written in the name of Mahari Bruna =Brno in the Czech Republic).

Rama: [When checking readability] it is not necessary to cover around the sides of the letter in question, rather they show him the document as is, and if he can read it, it is kosher (found written in an old arrangement).  It is customary to mix (or pour) the lines, which is to extend the inferior extensions of the nun sofi and peh sofi from the upper line until the line below, or the head of the lamed from the line below into the line above. If he did not intermix the lines, some say that it is invalid, but to me it appears that if there is a concern for anchoring the woman, it is not appropriate to be stringent. He should be careful not to extend the head of a letter from a lower line into the inner space of a letter from the line above or vice versa (Ran chapter 2 of Gittin, in the name of \"some say\"), and if he did this and the shape of the letter has been changed, for example he extended the head of a lamed into the space of a dalet, and the dalet now looks like a heh, then it is invalid.

There is an authority who requires two writs of divorce with two names (i.e. one divorce for each name). If he has a definitive name with which he is called to the Torah, and with which he signs his letters and contracts, that name is primary.  Rama: If he is called to the Torah with both (either of the) names, we write the second (new) name as primary, and identify the original name by \"who is called,\" but a witness who has two names and is signing a document should use both names without [writing] \"who is called.\"  Someone whose name was changed due to illness, and he has a new nickname because of the new name, they write [both] the new name and its nickname before the original name.

The same is true for men's nicknames, any nickname which is in Hebrew is written with heh, and those that are not in Hebrew are written with an aleph.

But it is not necessary to be precise in these matters how the names and nicknames are written, for everyone wrote according to the pronunciation of their country. Therefore the order of divorces varies from country to country in this matter, and the main point as I wrote above is how it appears to me proper to rule. If the pronunciation of the countries is not known, one should not change from the words of the predecessors.

A witness need not include his nickname with his signature (sic, Siman 234) even in the best case scenario [meaning: as opposed to being preferable to include one's nickname, but if one didn't it would not invalidate the signature].

Because if he gives over his belongings in front of two people and says: the <i> get</i> that I want to give to my wife, know that I am forced to give, and therefore, I am saying that in front of you, it should be nullified, so it's nullified, although he did not take from his belongings. The Rama Comments that even though he gave it over in front of two witnesses at different times, only this one and not that one, alone they are kosher (Rivash Siman 232). Even if you say there is not a source for the rape. And even if the rape reported was a lie. And even if you say that it is possible after this, we do not say that this testimony was nullified, until proof is given that this report is nullified. And there is no need for an acquisition. ",
                "Therefore, he needs to nullify before the writing of the bill of divorce any protest(of annulment) that he  has made, and he should say as such: behold I am nullifying any protest I informed on this bill of divorce. And so too I am nullifying any thing that will cause, when they are established, the nullification of the establishment of this bill of divorce. And so too I am testifying on myself that I did not inform any matter that will cause this bill of divorce to be nullified, and behold I am invalidating any witness or witnesses that will testify that I informed or said anything that will cause the bill of divorce to be nullified or that will weaken the power of the bill because of this protest or speech. Rem''a: And there are those that say it is enough if he says he is canceling any protest or protest of a protest until the end of all possible protests. And so too we practice, but it is better a priori to be cautious and to hold like the first position. ",
                "They practiced to require a nullification of a protest that even the divorcer made on his own accord. Rem''a: However, if he forgets to nullifying, it is Kosher, since he divorced on his own accord. They practiced also to nullify a protest before he commands to write, before the giving. Despite the fact that there are those that say that even if he cancels the bill of divorce between the writing and the giving, it is not effective after nullification of the protest to divorce with that same bill. Therefore, we do not suggest to him to leave until he gives the bill of divorce. Even in this case, there are those who are stringent to nullify the protest even in the time of giving. ",
                "If the husband takes an oath to give a bill of divorce, they need to make him renounce it beforehand, in order that it not look like he is being compelled. But if it was just a pledge he made, he can give it if he wants, because this is not similar to being compelled. Rem''a: and this is the ruling if he receives an acquisition to divorce. But if he accepts fines if he does not divorce, this is not called compulsion, since his bill of divorce was dependent on another thing and he will be able to give the fine and not divorce. And there are those that are stringent even in a case like that. And it's better to worry a priori and exempt him from the fine. But if he already divorced(her) because of this, and even did so from the strength of the oath he made to divorce, the bill of divorce is kosher, since, from the outset, they did not compel him by this. There are those that say that say that it is not called compulsion unless they compel the man himself, but if they compel someone else until his friend divorces, even a son for his father or vice versa, this is not called compulsion. There are those who are stringent in the case of a father and son. See later on in 152 for these laws. ",
                "This, that is not considered a bill of divorce when he is forced, this is discussing a case when he declared a protest. But, if he did not declare a protest, if they forced him illegally, it is invalid. And legally, for example, if he is obligated to dismiss(divorce her)and he does not want to, and the Beit Din forces him until dismisses, this is a valid bill of divorce. And it is a commandment upon each Beit Din, at all times, to force the divorcer to nullify the protest. ",
                "Someone who delivered a document (\"moda'a\") invalidating a get (writ of divorce) in advance (typically stating that he is being forced to grant a get against his will, and the get is therefore invalid), the court administers (Rabbinically sanctioned) lashes of \"rebellion\", for he has caused there to be bastards (mamzerim), for when the get arrives in her hands and she remarries, and after time witnesses arrive who testify that he [had previously] voided the get in their presence, or that he had delivered an invalidating document to them prior to his writing the get, the outcome is that her child from the second marriage is a bastard.  Rama: Even if he voided the moda'a at the time he gave the get (and the divorce is therefore valid), we nevertheless ostracize him out of concern that some people will know of the moda'a, but not know of its abrogation (Responsa Rosh rule 52, and similarly Beit Yosef in the name of Tosafot).",

Even so, he invalidates her from [marrying into] the priesthood (because of the hint of being a divorced woman).",

But if the law requires him to divorce her, there is not even the scent of a get in it, and she has not been disqualified from marrying a kohen.

If he was not bound, she is not divorced. Some authorities say that two [qualifications] are needed: Binding - so that he will not be a mobile courtyard; and sleeping - so that he will be watched as per her volition (and not the slave's volition).",

If he was not bound, and he was awake, she acquires the slave, but is not divorced until the writ of divorce actually arrives in her hands.  Similarly, if he put the get into his courtyard, and sold her the courtyard, or gave her the courtyard as a gift, since she has acquired the courtyard with a document of sale or with monetary acquisition, or by making an improvement in the courtyard (a form of acquisition protocol), she is divorced.  But if he put the get in another man's courtyard, and the other man subsequently gave her the courtyard, or she bought it from him, she is not divorced (because there was never any delivery of the get from husband to wife).

Rem\"a: Therefore, if the writ that designates the agent is lost or disqualified, if it is an urgent moment, we give the Get without the writ (Mahari\"k, Shoresh 26). The agent is trustworthy with regard to his agency and to say that he was designated as an agent in the presence of witnesses, just like he is trustworthy to say, \"it was written and sealed in front of me.\" Look also later in 142:3. A priori, however, one should write the writ of agency carefully, and be cautious not to use acronyms (in tikkun Mahar\"i of Mintz in the name of the Mahara\"i). Also one should not change things that are written in the Get, such as if the name \"Zanvil\" is written with a bet, he should not write in the writ of agency with a vav (G\"Z ibid.) etc. The language of the writ of agency can be found in Even Haezer 141:30. The other rules and the order of the agency, look later in the order of the Get. The witnesses to the writ of agency should not be related to each other, nor to the husband or the wive, nor to the witnesses of the Get (Seder Gittin 73). If the witnesses to the writ of agency are invalidated, the entire agency is cancelled because they are testifying to the essence of the agency and that in front of them the husband appointed the agent, which is different than the other possible invalidations of the writ of agency [itself] as it seems to me. The custom is that the Rabbi who is arranging the Get establishes the writ of agency also. Some have the practice that one should establish it with [a beit din of] three. In any case, even if only one of the signatures is recognizable (this is also acceptable). Some have the practice to write a writ (or in the handwriting) (of) [to] the place where it is being given to advise if there is a change in anything having to do with the writ of agency (there, in the name of the Mahara\"r Za\"kh).",

And there are those who say that if the agent has authority and wrote in it who are the get's witnesses, that this is considered the upholding of the signatures, and if so the agent need not say: It was written and signed in front of me (Rashba siman 561, and Mordecai, beginning of ch. hitkabel).  And there are those who disagree and say that authority is not considered upholding (Ribash siman 318 and in the sedarim).

Rama: Therefore, a mute person is unable to bring a get, even though he is capable of writing \"before me it was written and before me it was signed,\" for he is required to speak the phrase by mouth (Rivash chapter 240). Some authorities say that he must say the phrase in Hebrew, to wit: \"befanai nichtav uv'fanai nechtam,\" (so apparent in Rosh first chapter of Seder Gitin).  If he is an ignoramus, he repeats (the phrase) word for word after a reader, and they inform him the interpretation in the vernacular (this also in the sedarim). Nevertheless, if he said the phrase in the vernacular, it appears to me that the get is valid ex post facto.  ",
                "If the agent did not say \"before me it was written and before me it was signed,\" and the husband died, there is no possible fix of taking the get back from her and re-delivering it accompanied by the statement of \"before me it was written and before me it was signed,\" and there is no solution other than to validate the signatures of the witnesses on the get. ",
                "If one agent designates another agent, he should designate him before a court. {This should consist of three judges, but there can be an alternative:} i.e., two people {serving as judges}, and he joins them {to be the third}—if he is qualified to be a judge. And {the first agent} says, “{The get} was written in my presence, and it was signed in my presence,” at the time that he gives it to the {second} agent. And that {second agent may give the get} to another {agent}—up to a hundred. And each {designating agent} says before the court (at the time of the transfer of {the get} or within a time span in which one can speak {a brief formula} &lt;unclear&gt; [Seder Gittin]), “I am an agent of the court.” And so should the last {agent} say when he places {the get} in the woman’s hand. (Rema: And {he need} not necessarily {use} this phraseology. But the same applies if he says, “I was made the agent before the court.” That {too} suffices [Matnot Kehunah , Tikun Yashan]. But even if he says nothing, as long as he has a harsha’ah {a document testifying to his credentials} and the alternative is {the woman becoming} an agunah {a grass widow}, one should be lenient [Rivash 318]. And so should each {agent} say to his compatriot: “I, So-and-so son of So-and-so, appoint you, So-and-so son of So-and-So, to be an agent in my place, in my stead, and your hand should be as my hand, etc., to divorce Woman-so-and-so daughter of So-and-so, the wife of So-and-so son of So-and-so, wherever you may find her. And I give you permission to appoint an agent, and that agent an agent, etc. And as soon as the get comes into the hand of Woman-So-and-so daughter of So-and-so, she will be divorced, etc.” [all in Seder Gittin], as is explained below in Seder HaGet, 30. And the {latter} court agent does not need a harsha’ah as does the first agent. But the custom is for him to have such a document, as does the first agent [Rivash 53]. And see above 141:24. And {in addition} even if only two people signed the authorizing document {instead of three}, and {even if} they wrote as witnesses and not as judges, {even then} the second agent is believed if he says that there were three or that he was with them {to make three}. And in this case, the principle that a witness is not made a judge is not germane (Rivash 318). And we are not concerned about the court [judges] being in error unless we know that those who produced the get are not expert. In such a case, even if {the get} is written properly, we are concerned about {the judges} [ibid.].)",
                "When {one agent} comes to appoint another agent, {the new agent} does not need to be in his presence. Instead, {the first agent} declares in court: “So-and-so is my agent”—even if {the latter} is not in his presence. And similarly, {the agent} can transfer agency to the court to appoint other agents. And {the judges} can appoint an agent not in the presence of the previous agent. (Rema: And some say that it is not effective for {the new agent} to say, “I am an agent of the court,” because he did not hear the {first} agent say, “It was written before me and it was signed before me.” Rather, he must have a harsha’ah or else the signatures on the get must be validated [Rivash 53].)",
                "A person blind in both eyes cannot bring a get {that comes from} outside the country, because he cannot say: “It was written before me and it was signed before me.” Therefore, if it was written and signed before him when he had sight, and then he became blind, he says (before {a court of} three people): “It was written before me and it was signed before me,” and he gives it to her. And that is the case if he recognizes the woman’s voice. But if he does not recognize her voice, it does not help for others to tell him that she is the woman, although that would help with someone who is sighted. (Rema: And in regard to a sighted person, we need two kosher witnesses {to testify to her identity} who are not {her} relatives and not disqualified [Terumat Hadeshen  248].)",
                "If there are witnesses that the husband handed over the get to a blind man for purposes of divorce, it is kosher; for since there are witnesses, the blind man does not need to state \"before me it was written and before me it was signed,\" and he gives her the get in the presence of those two witnesses themselves. If the signatures of the witnesses to the divorce document were validated, it is kosher in all circumstances.  ",
                "If a man gave a get to his wife, and it was written and signed in her presence, and he told her, “You are an agent to bring it to Court So-and-so, and they will appoint an agent and give you this get and {then} you will be divorced with it,” she is believed when she tells {the judges of that court}, “It was written before me and signed before me.” (And she must say this at the time that the get leaves her hand [Tur and the Rosh].) And {the judges} take it and give it to an agent to give to her in keeping with the statement of {her} husband. And if the husband did not did not impose this condition upon her, and she gives the get {to the court}, she need not say anything, and she is assumed to be divorced, and {that is the case} even though the signatures of the witnesses have not been validated; {that is} because witnesses that sign the get are considered like people whose testimony was validated by the court, as long as there is no challenger. And even if {the husband} told her, “Only get divorced with it before Court So-and-so,” that is a mere condition&lt;unclear?&gt;; and when she comes to that court and the get is in her possession, she is divorced {retroactively} with her initial receiving {of it}. And she does not need to say, “It was written before me and signed before me.”",
                "And some disagree and say that she should not be allowed to marry with a get that she has produced unless its signatures have been validated, even if there are no challengers to it, for no one has ever heard of anyone who employed such a leniency. (Rema: A husband who brings a get to his wife, and he himself transported it from where it was written to the place that {he} gives {it} must transfer it to her as an agent, and he must say: “It was written before me and it was signed before me” like the agent, so as not to come to err with another agent&lt;unclear&gt;, since at present people are unlearned [Beit Yosef in the name of A.Ch.).)",

And if {the agent} wishes to be strict and insist that all of it should have been written {in his presence}, we do not listen to him, so as not to cast into doubt {the legitimacy of} previous gittin. And all of this is in regard to its writing. But in regard to its being signed, {the agent} must be present with the {signatories} from beginning to end.",

Even if {the agent} is one of the {signed} witnesses of the get, and he said, “One witness signed before me, and this is my signature,” {but he did not see the second witness sign}, its signatures must be validated. And if he and another person testified regarding the signature of the second witness who did not sign before him, that is fine. And there is no need to say that if two others testified regarding the signature of that witness who did not sign before him {that that is fine as well}.",

And that is the case if they are fit to give testimony, for the husband cannot challenge this get even though it is not validated, for his agents are his witnesses. (And some say that if the husband came and challenged {the get}, its signatures must be validated [Tur, and so too Maharan as understood by the Beit Yosef].) And some say that even if {the husband} only appointed one {person as an} agent, and a second {person} testifies that in his presence the husband gave this one {person} the get to transport to his wife, {the agent} does not need to say, “It was written before me and it was signed before me.” And there is an authority who does require that in such a case he  should transmit it before people who witness the transfer.",
                "If two people bring a get, and one says, “It was written before me,” and the other one says, “And it was signed before me,” if one of them is the {sole} agent, it is not given to her until its signatures are validated. And similarly, if two people say, “It was written before us,” and a third person says, “It was signed before me,” if there is only one agent, it is not given to her until its signatures are validated. If one says, “It was written before me,” and two say, “It was signed before us,” even though it does not leave their hands, it is kosher, for its signatures are validated. (Rema: Some say that if the agent brought a get with its signatures validated, even though {the judges} do not recognize the signatures of the judges giving the confirmation, at any rate, in a pressing situation and possibility {of a woman being an} agunah, one should be lenient and rely upon it, although the agent did not say, “It was written before me and it was signed before me,” because it is impossible to return and say, one should rely upon the signatures, because according to the Torah the signed witnesses to a contract are considered as though their testimony has been investigated {and accepted} by the court (Beit Yosef in the name of Rashbatz).)"

When the condition is fulfilled, they were divorced from the time <i>get</i> was given to her hand.

Initially, she should not marry before the condition is met, but if she marries, he should separate from her, until the condition is met. However, with a condition that she can control and passively fulfill, we do not suspect that she will violate it. Therefore, she is allowed to marry immediately, on the condition or \"from now\". There are those who say even if he did not say \"from now,\" and not \"from today,\" and not \"on condition,\" the law is as one who said \"from today,\" because the time [written in] the <i>get</i> proves [his intention].

And if he admits he divorced her with it, and she requests of him that she should collect her ketubah, and he said that he already paid her and returned it to her and [the bill of divorce] fell from him, he returns it to her, even if she doesn't say, \"This hole is next to this letter,\" but any other sign (<i>that does not so much</i>) show intimate knowledge [of what the bill of divorce looks like], such as her saying, \"Such and such fingers are the length of the bill of divorce,\" or \"[Such and such fingers are the width of the bill of divorce,\" or she says the measurement of the string-tie for it, or [whether] the string is white or black, or she says it was placed in a box or in a chest, those are not sign that are enough for him to return it to her."

                "These are the [reasons] we force him to divorce her and to give her the ketubah: One who develops bad breath of the mouth or nose, or goes back to become a collector of dog feces, or a tanner, or to a scraper of copper from its source [i.e. a miner]. If she wants, she can stay with her husband. <i> Rem\"a: And if she knew [about this problem] before she was married, we do not force him to divorce her, for she understood and accepted it (Tur in the name of the Ramah).</i> If the man becomes afflcited with boils, we force him to divorce her and to give her the ketubah. Even if she wants to stay with him (<i> Rem\"a: Or [even] if she stipulated [that she knew about this] </i>) we don't listen to her, rather we make them separate against their will, for she exacerbates his condition [if they have sex]. And if she says, \"I will stay with him with witnesses [about], so that he does not have sex with me [because they are around],\" we listen to her. <i> Rem\"a: Some say that [if he becomes] an apostate, we force him to divorce her through non-Jews (Bet Yosef Siman 134 in the name of the O\"Ch and the Mordechai Perek Hamegaresh), as long as he voids it at the time of the bill of divorce (ibid Mordechai). Some argue and say that we do not force an apostate [to divorce], or any transgressor against the faith (Teshuvat Mora\"m), unless he makes her transgress, for example feeding her prohibited food (Mohry\"V Siman 22), or he violates a promise that he made upon himself that he would not tease her or hit her, or he makes a promise and he does not fulfill it, for sons die [as a result] of sins of [violating] vows (Hagahot Maimoni end of Ishut). One who pimps prostitutes, and his wife complains about it, if there are witnesses, and they see him with adulterers or he admits, some say we force him to divorce her, but we do not suspect he caused the bringing of gentile children, for perhaps they are lying about him (Chiddushei Aggudah D'Yevamot).</i>",
                "If a woman has a husband with bad breath of the mouth or nose, or he collected dog feces, or the like, and he died [childless, causing his wife to be obligated to fulfill the mitzvah of either yibbum or chalitzah]. If [the yavam] has the same blemish of his brother, she can say: \"With your brother, I could accept this. With you, I am not willing to accept this.\" He does chalitzah and he gives her her ketubah[-worth].",
                "If someones says, \"I will not give food nor provide for [my wife],\" we force him to give food. And if the court cannot force him to give food, such as one who doesn't have anything to provide and doesn't want to make money to become profitable and provide food [that way], if she wants, we force him to divorce her immediately and giver her her ketubah. The law is such to someone who does not want have sex. <i> Rem\"a: Similarly, a man who gets angry often and consistently kicks out his wife from his house, we force him to divorce her, for because of this he will not provide food for her sometimes, and he will separate from her from sexual relations more times than her rights to conjugal relations, and that is like refusal to provide food and sex [which are grounds for divorce] (Teshuvat HaRashba Siman 693). And see earlier Siman 70 and Siman 77. A man who hits his wife, has a transgression in his hand as much as striking his fellow. If he does this often, the court had the right to cause him pain and to excommunicate him, to whip him, to use all types of force, and to make him swear he will not do it again. And if he does not obey the court, some say we force him to divorce her, as long as he is warned one or twice, for it is not the way of Jews to hit their wives, that is the actions of the gentiles. This only applies when he starts it, but if she curses him for no reason, or mocks his father and mother, and she contradicts what he says and he has no authority over her, some say it is permitted to hit her. And some say that a bad wife is [also] prohibited to strike. The first opinion is the essential one. If it is not known who started it, the husband is not believed to say that she started it, for all women are assumed kosher, and they place others among them to see who is the bad one. And if she curses him for no reason, she is divorced without her ketubah. And it seems to me that this is only when this happens often, and after warning, as was explained earlier siman 115. If she left his house and borrowed [money] and ate [food], if she left because of him hitting her so often, he must pay her back (all of this note can be found in the Mordechai Perek Naara in the name of the Mohar\"am and the B\"Z Siman 88), and as is explained earlier Siman 70.</i>",

Haga: There are those who say this law only applies if one of his hands or feet is amputated, or one eye is blinded, but in a case where he loses both, he must divorce his wife. (Tur and Rosh) ",

Rama: An epileptic, some say that it is not a blemish, and we do not force him to divorce.  On the other hand, we do not force her to be with him, since she has a [reasonable] claim (Mordechai, chapter haMadir, in the name of Ra'aviya).  Some say that it is a blemish in a man, and we force him to divorce (Rosh, rule 42). ",
                "If a woman demanded a divorce because she cannot produce children with this man we so not listen to her.  If she demands a divorce because she want a son to lean on [in her old age], and she does not yet have any son, and she she says that he is the cause of the infertility because he cannot ejaculate with force, if she has lived with him for ten years and she ah not become pregnant, and she does not demand her Ketubah (such that we would have reason to suspect that she is only demanding to divorce to collect the Ketubah), and there is also no other reason that she might be demanding the divorce, we do listen to her, even if he has children from another woman, for perhaps his physical state deteriorated later.  We force him to divorce her and give the primary 100 or 200 [of the Ketubah], but not any additions.  He must also return the dowry that she brought into the marriage.  He should issue a generic ban against the fact that she is making a claim without certain knowledge, and then he must giver her the Ketubah.  If he said, \"I will marry another woman and inspect myself,\" we listen to him.  If the second woman becomes pregnant, the first is divorced without a Ketubah.  If she does not [become pregnant], both women must be divorced and given their Ketubah, or he can marry a third woman, if he can afford to support them.  Some authorities say that if the second woman also said that he cannot ejaculate with force, he must divorce both and give the Ketubah.  In all cases, if it is known that he is sterile, and she comes with this demand, he must divorce immediately.  Rem\"a: The same applies if they were married for ten years with no children, and she comes with this claim, we then force him to divorce and give the Ketubah.  In that case it will not help for him to say, \"I will inspect myself with another woman,\" because the first will still not lose her Ketubah since she has not been inspected with three men [and found barren].  The rule that she must claim that he cannot ejaculate with force is only if we know that he already had children, for we then assume that [the infertility] is from her unless she makes the claim that he cannot ejaculate with force, or if this is her third husband such that it is already established [that she is infertile].  So appears to be the view of the Tur, and it is from the conclusions of the Tosafot and the Hagahot Ashri. ",

If he divorced her without being coerced, he must give her the Ketubah.  Rem\"a: Some sauthorities say that even though he can have intercourse with another woman he still mist give this woman her Ketubah; since he cannot have intercourse with her she can say, \"I have given myslef to you, what more can I do for you?\" When is this the case?  When she does not demand the Ketubah.  If, however, she demands the Ketubah, she is not believed, and we do not even force him to divorce.  Rem\"a: Some authorities say that these days when some woman are impudent, she is not believed.  Nevertheless, if there are reasons to suspect (or circumstantial evidence) that she is telling the truth, she is believed.  If we suspect that he cannot have intercourse with her because she has a narrow womb and she is a virgin, or that he cannot have intercourse with her because he is aged or weak, we rely on this we do not force him to divorce her.  Some authorities say that even in cases where we do not force him to divorce, we still do not force her to make peace with him, and we do not consider her to be a rebellious wife.  Instead, we allow time to pass such that they either make peace or wait ten years without children.  The same applies if he betrothed a woman and she may not marry him or another, he must divorce her.  If she claims that he husband refuses to lie with her or have intercourse with her, it is judges as if she said he had erectile dysfunction.",

I will live with her with witnesses so that I will not be secluded with her.\"  Whether she said this, or he said it, we do not listen; instead we require him to divorce or marry a child bearing woman.  Rem\"a: Some authorities say that this is true if they had no children at all.  If, however, she birthed a viable child, even though he has not yet fulfilled obligation to be fruitful, we do not force him to divorce her.  See (Shulchan Arukh, Even HaEzer 1), that these days we never force a divorce.  A man is believed to say that he knows himself to be sterile, and we do not force him to marry a woman.",

Rem''a: And since there is a disagreement of many, it is fitting to be stringent and not force him with whips, in order that there won't be a bill of divorce given under duress. But if he has a wife through sexual immorality, according to everyone, we do force with whips. And in every situation where we do not force with whips, we also do not excommunicate him. And in any case, they can decree on any Jew to not do any kind deeds to him or do any business with him, to circumcise his sons or to bury them until he divorces (her). And any stringency which a Beit Din wants to enact, they can in this type of case, so long as they don't excommunicate him. But one who does not perform his marital duties, we can excommunicate him and banish him in order that he perform this duty or divorce her, because there is no forcing when it comes to marital relations, and so too in similar cases. And so too he who divorces with a kosher bill of divorce and he discredits it a bit, it is permissible to force him to give another bill of divorce. And any situation where we have a disagreement about whether or not to force him, despite the fact that we don't force him to divorce, in any case, we force him to give the value of the bill of marriage immediately, and so too the value of the wedding equipment that he provides for her.

But he may give a pledge if he wishes. Rem\"a: See above ch. 134:4. But regarding the divorce document of an apostate, there is no need to ask whether he swore or vowed, since he is legally required to divorce; but they ask him whether he is divorcing of his own free will, and likewise they ask his wife.",

Furthermore, even if the first divorced her and took her back, and she did mi'un with him, and she married someone else after she gave him mi'un, and the other divorced her, she may return to the first. For whoever goes out with mi'un, even if there was a divorce beforehand, it as  if she was never divorced from him with a divorce document and she may return to him. But if one divorces a female minor with a divorce document, she receives a ketubah, and he is forbidden to her relatives, and she is forbidden to his relatives, and she is forbidden to priesthood, and she needs to wait for three months. And if she married another and did mei'un to him, she may not return to the first because she left him with a divorce document, even though she left the last one with mei'un. And this obviously applies if the last one divorced her or died. She is also forbidden to the father of the first one and to his son, and to his brothers, like other divorced women, even though she left the last one with mei'un.  And if she did mei'un with the first, and he took her back and divorced her and she married another and became a widow or was divorced or did mi'un to him, she may not return to the first  or to his relatives. For whoever left him with mi'un in the end, her law is that of a woman who did mi'un. And whoever left him with a divorce in the end, her law is that of a divorced woman.  ",

The [engagement via] speech of a nine year old is not accounted as that of a man of majority age, and it is not effective, except in the first case (i.e. not to render the situation unfit), and not as the second one. How is this? A minor does [engagement via] speech, this is effective to render her unfit for the other brothers. But, if the older brother did [engagement via] speech, and then the nine year old came along and did [engagement via] speech with her or her co-wife, this is not effective in rendering her forbidden to his older brother. But [engagement via] speech of a nine year after [engagement via] speech of a nine year old - there are those that say that it is effective since the first one was nine years old.

But the halitsa of the co-wife exempts the holder of the bill of divorce completely, and the one who was [engaged via] speech is exempt from halitsa, and she requires another bill of divorce from her [engagement via] speech. And if her had done [engagement via] speech with this one and given a bill of divorce to the other one, he may do halitsa with whomever he wishes and thereby exempt the other one, as we shall explain.

If one of them had inferior halitsa, the one who did halitsa is permitted to non-family members, but her co-wife is forbidden until she too does halitsa, or until all the brothers to halitsa with the one who had inferior halitsa, for inferior halitsa does not remove the obligation of the brother from this household, until she has gone to all the brothers, or until she has done halitsa with each of them.

And when they give an amount of money to him that is appropriate, we release their excommunication. And as for a daughter, as long as she is in her father's domain, her father get's everything (ibid). See Tur in this paragraph who discussed this matter at length, and the Shulkhan Arukh abbreviated them, for this is not common.",

Hagah: If an evil report goes out about her, for instance witnesses came and testify that she asked them to engage in fornication, she gets no fine. But if it is just a rumor that a bad name went out about her, she doesn't lose the fine (Tur). If he rapes her and then seduces her, it is called rape, even though afterward she agreed [to have relations] with him (Maharik, root 129). ",
                "One about whom it has been claimed [that he had relations] with an unmarried woman, there are those who say that he shouldn't marry her because of the bad talk [that will result] for it looks like they are confirming the rumor. But there are those that say it is a mitzvah to marry her.\nHagah: The first reasoning is the main one. And if there is fear that she will go out to an \"evil culture\" (i.e. marry out of Judaism), he may marry her. And all of this refers to a simple rumor, but if he certainly had relations with her, it is a mitzvah to marry her, but we don't enforce that (ibid). \nBut if a rumor went out concerning that she had relations with two men, the first only a rumor and the second added to her insult, the second has a mitzvah to marry her. But if the rumor is of equal strength with regard to both, one is married and one is not married, the second has a mitzvah to marry her (ibid).\nSee above siman 22, whether she is trustworthy in this matter.\nA prostitute that was requested of one who promised to pay her a price and he denies it, he must take an oath as is true in other suits (Ribash, siman 41). This is what the Torah  obligated the rapist and the seducer to pay money, when it just happened. But a father is not allowed to give his daughter to be a harlot, and about this it is written, \"Do not defile your daughter to make her a harlot\" (Leviticus 19:29). And anyone who prepares herself to be a harlot, whether on her own accord or her father's  is considered a \"kedeshah\" and there is no distinction in this matter between a virgin and a non-virgin. And a court may fine prostitutes in order to erect a fence. \nAnd it happened with one who fornicated with a non-Jew, that they cut her nose off, in order to disfigure her (Responsa of the Rosh 18).

But if he said to her: Don't be secluded with so-and-so, and he is a minor or an animal, this is not legally performed jealousy. And he may profess jealous over her whether she is betrothed or married or awaiting levirate marriage.  ",

Therefore,  they can profess jealousy over her, in  order to cause her to lose her ketubah. And there are those who say that she is not prohibited to her husband unless he is a priest.  Hagah: An adult who accidentally fornicated, thinking he was her husband but he was someone else, is permitted to her Israelite husband (Rambam, chapter 24, Hilkhot Ishut). But if she thought it was permitted to fornicate, this is like one who does so intentionally and she is forbidden to her husband (Maharik, root 167).  A woman who was secluded with men on the road and she came back and said: \"I was secluded and I was raped\" there are those who say she is believed with a \"since\" argument, for [she could have said] I did not have relations.  And there are those who said she loses the ability to make such an argument, since she was illicitly secluded (both opinions are found in the Mordecai, second chapter of Ketubot). ",

Similarly, if he says to her: Do not be secluded with so-and-so, and she speaks with him in front of witnesses, she is permitted.  And similarly if she is secluded in front of witnesses and stays with him long enough to be defiled, and he didn't profess jealousy in front of witnesses, she is permitted. For they don't prohibit a man to his wife even if they were secluded with the intent of engaging in prohibited relations, unless he professed jealousy at the outset in front of two witnesses.

Hagah: And not that we don't have the sotah waters, if she is secluded after a profession of jealousy she is forbidden to him forever (Tur, in the name of the SMG). And if he forgot and professed jealousy, he should forgive her immediately for the jealousy, as will be explained below in this chapter, section 12. ",

And if not, she is permitted to him. And if he himself saw her secluded with him and she was with him long enough to be defiled, she is forbidden to him and he should divorce her and give her the ketubah.

Hagah: This also applies if she herself said that she committed adultery as was explained earlier in chapter 115:6. There are some who say that nowadays when the ban of Rabeinu Gershom not to divorce one's wife without her consent is upheld, [the husband] can not believe her testimony or the witness's testimony [about her promiscuity], because we are concerned that [the husband] may have been keeping his eye on another woman [and that he is divorcing his wife only to marry another woman], without actually believing the wife or the witness.(Hagaot Maymoni Chapter 24 and the Maharik rule 110 in the name of 'those who say'). We ostracize the husband [in such a case] because he tried to break the ban of Rabeinu Gershom by saying that he trusted her (i.e his wife's testimony).

Margoliyot of blessed memory.) Rem\"a: In the days of the Talmudic Sages they used to appoint an expert sage over divorce documents, and likewise it is found in the words of the ancestors that they would only give a divorce document before the great [sage]s of the generation (Rivash 389). Therefore no person other than an expert in divorce documents should attempt to give them. And anyone who is not an expert in the nature of divorce and marraige should have nothing to do with them. And if someone transgressed and gave divorce documents or performed halitza without obtaining permission, see Yoreh Deah 242:14. A divorce document arranged by non-experts should be invalidated as I wrote above in ch. 141:30 and 142:9.",

Ideally one should select witnesses who have no relationship at all, even a 4th-level one (in the name of the Maharil), nor through marriage. Also there should no rumors that they are suspected of forbidden sexual relations (that is the implication of chapter \"Zeh Borer\" -- Sanhedrin ch. 3), nor any other invalidating matter. Nor should one select a witness who is deformed. Also be careful that the witnesses and the scribe not be related to the rabbi organizing the divorce document; but in an emergency, one needn't be careful about the scribe['s relationship to the rabbi] if he is fitting. Some say that the rabbi should say to the witnesses that they should repent in their hearts for sins that they have committed, even if they are presumed to be completely righteous, lest they committed a sin that would disqualify them in this (Mahara\"m Yafe and R\"Y Mintz). And one should select witnesses who understand the divorce document, and if they don't now how to read, teach them and explain to them, and to the scribe and the husband what is a divorce document for its own sake and not for its own sake (M\"K).

Rem\"a: But we don't act according to him. His reasoning is specious, because he compares this matter to that which they said: 'One who takes money to judge, his rulings are void.' That is no proof, because organizing divorce documents isn't judging, but generic teaching. See above ch. 130 the reason that the witnesses get paid. And the husband should equalize himself with the scribe and the rabbi and the witnesses before they begin to write (M\"K in the name of Mahara\"n of blessed memory).",

Rem\"a: And there are those who say that, before the scribe cuts the sheet of parchment, he should announce in front of the witnesses that he wishes to write with the intent [that it will be used by the particular man in question to divorce the particular woman in question], as will be explained later on in Se'if 55 [(Se'if 80 in this version)]. And this is our custom in these lands.",
            "[The scribe] should cut the sheet of parchment according to the measurements [needed to write the] bill of divorce, so that he won't need to cut off anything from [the sheet] after the bill of divorce is written.",
            "If the scribe erred after he wrote part of it, and he begins another [bill of divorce] on the same sheet, he should first cut off the bit that he wrote.",
            "The length of the sheet of parchment must be longer than it is wide. And \"length\" refers to the direction that it is read from its beginning to its end.

Rem\"a: And he should etch two [horizontal] lines on the sides of the bill of divorce, one from the right and one from the left, in order to align the writing (Seder HaGet). And he should align the writing to be next to the lines and not on the lines themselves.",

(Rem\"a) Note: and they are precise with it [in reviewing it] as to whether a word was omitted, as well as for spelling errors and all other corrections to the gett.It is good to check the gett against another gett, because then if there is a mistake he will notice immediately (from the Seder MaHariv); also [it is good to] send it to the rest of the important people in the city to review it and determine whether it was written properly, and they should be careful not to smudge it in sending it. Afterwards the husband returns and give the leftover parchment to the scribe as well as the ink and other writing materials, as a gift, so that he [the scribe] may write other bills of divorce (gittin) (from Sedarim). They are accustomed to bring ten people to the delivery of a gett, so as to publicize the event (R\"I Mintz). Relatives can be counted as part of the quarum. We take [select] two qualified witnesses to be witnesses to the delivery. They are accustomed to take the witnesses that signed as the witnesses for delivery as well. They are also accustomed that the officiating rabbi stands in the middle and the two witnesses of delivery stand one to his right and one to his left, and the scribe stands in front of him and the husband and wife in front of him. Everyone stands and does not sit (in Tikkun Yashan and in the Or Zarua in the Chapter Ze Borrair). Some say (the one should) be careful not to give the gett in the house of the officiating rabbi; and I have not seen that people are careful to do so (in the abovementioned Tikkun cited as an oral transmission). [end of Rem\"a Note - the Shulchan Aruch resumes:] After they have finished reading the officiating rabbi should ask the scribe: \"Is this the gett that you have written? Rem\"a Note: Did he give you all the writing instruments, the parchment and the ink? [end of Rem\"a note] Did you write it with the command of the husband for his sake and for the sake of divorce of is wife so-and-so daughter of so-and-so?\" and he says: \"Yes\" Rem\"a Note: \"Did he tell you these things before witnesses?\" [end of Rem\"a Note] He then asks one of the witnesses: \"Did you hear that the told the scribe to write for his sake and for the purpose of the divorce of his wife so-and-so daughter of so-and-so?\" ",

            "And he answers yes to each question. The second witness is also questioned in the same manner.  Rama: He also asks the scribe and the witnesses if they stated explicitly, when they began to write the get, that they are writing it in his (the husband's) name and her (the wife's) name and for the purpose of divorce. If each party heard the testimony of the other parties and they said yes (i.e. \"likewise\") they are re-questioned explicitly as to how they spoke (when writing the get) (in the Sedarim). The Sage should instruct the husband, the scribe, and the witnesses not to say \"yes yes\" or \"no no\" in their answers, rather only a single yes or no (Seder of Maharam Yaffe).",
            "...74: afterwards when he will give her the writ of divorce, he then asks if it was given with his knowledge and with his consent, as we mentioned earlier. Ramah's Gloss: ...In Sif 14. There are formats of divorce documents that contain within them a nullification of these assertions before the sage reads the divorce document, and they confer with the scribe and the witnesses, as we have explained, prior to the reading of the divorce document. It is our local custom to act this way, but it essentially makes no difference. And when the sage reads the divorce document, he should read it punctiliously; not in a manner that would be more understood in another language.",
            "75: He should also nullify these assertions a second time, and he should also disqualify the witnesses as we discussed previously. Rama: ...in section 20.

For after it is given over we institute a ban against anyone attempting to disqualify this divorce document. See above in this section, paragraph 22 as it has relevance to our case. ",

And he asks her if she is accepting the <i> Get </i> willingly and she says: yes. And there those who are stringent and say that they should ask if she swore so that [the elder] can annul them for her. And the elder who has arranged the <i> Get </i> says: Know that with this <i> Get </i> you will be divorced from your husband. And the Rabbi asks about the <i> Ketubah </i> [to obtain it] and that she should return the <i> Ketubah </i> to her husband or relinquish [the right to the money], so that they won't come to an argument later because of the <i> Ketubah </i> and so that the husband doesn't say: It was because of this that I didn't divorce her (This reason is brought from the Mahri Mintz).",
            "He [the elder] should be careful that her friends or anyone else don't help her [at the time of reception of the <i> Get </i>]. And that an overall (???) or any other object doesn't come to her hand at the time of the reception.",

You are divorced from me because of the Get from now, and you are now allowed to be with any other man\".  Rama: Before he gives it to her, the Rabbi should tell witnesses to witness the handing over of the Get. The Rabbi should also tell the husband the meaning of the words he is saying. Some have the custom to fold the Get before he hands it over, and that is our custom. Some write not fold it, rather give it to her with the writing on the outside, so everyone sees that it is a Get.",

            "And so too, if the community has  said the evening prayer, although it is still day, one may still not deliver a _get_, since it is already considered night, [and this all applies] if it is not consider a situation of urgency, [that if it is a situation of urgency] even at actual nighttime you may write it and you may give it. One needs to give the _get_ on the very same day it is written, however [if this is not possible] he sends it to another city, in the event that it is impossible for him to give it to her on the  [same] day it was written.",
            "90: Her husband must not seclude himself with her between the writing and the giving [of the get]. And if he did seclude himself with her,  then the get is an old get, and he cannot use it to divorce her. (See above, siman 149).",
            "A messenger who comes to bring a get[=writ of divorce] gives to her in front of two [witnesses].  If the messenger is a relative or impermissible as a witness, he gives to her in front of three [witnesses]. He [the messenger] says to her at the time of giving [the get]:   'This your get that your husband x son of y, also known as z; and behind your are divorced from him through it And you are permitted to any man. And this get was written and signed in front of me. Comment: And also for a writ of divorce from engagement; the messenger says to her: 'This your writ of divorce sent by your husband.' And then the name of the husband is written in the permission area. But in questions that the rabbi asks the messenger the name of the engaged man is mentioned, for example if he asks if this is the get sent by engaged man x. The rabbinical court in front of him the get is to be given reads it [the get] before it is given and if there is a condition regarding the get [without thich the fulfillment of the condition the get is invalid], the messenger says at the time of giving, '[this get is given] on conditions of x and y [being fulfilled].'and see above #142 about the order of the messenger giving it to the hand of the women and above # 140, 2. There are those who arrange divorces and this is how they act:  the seated [rabbis acondition. ask the messenger what he wants and he replies: 'I send x son of y to divorced my wife z, etc.' And they [the judges] ask him if the husband stipulated a time to divorce or if he did not stipulate any other condition. And he [the messager says [the condition/s] to them. Bthen they ask the women if she wants to receive the get. After this they ask about the permission and they read it to her if she fixed it and if she fulfills it as usual. After this the judges ask the messenger if the husband was healthy at the time it was sent or if he [the messenger] heard that he [the husband] died or canceled the sending and he [the messenger] answers about all of it.  Translation incomplete.",
            "If the divorced woman is a naarah[=young woman], whether engaged or married, she is divorced when she receives the get[=writ if divorce] itself. If her father receives it [the get], if she was engaged as long as she has not reached maturity, she is divorced. However, if she reached maturity, even though she was only engaged, or if she was married while still a minor, she is not divorced through the receipt of her father.",
            "If she is a minor, and she married, she is not divorced [with the get] accepted by her father. [I.E he receives the money on her behalf]",
            "And if she is an engaged minor, according to all she is divorced through her father. There is a disagreement if she is divorced through herself [i.e. she does it], and it is advisable to be stringent, that she does not receives it except through her father.",
            "A minor may be divorced only when she can tell the difference between her get and some other object, such that she will take a bundle and throw it away, or take a nut and keep it, or when she has reached the age of children, which is six or seven. But younger than that, she may not be divorced, according to Rashi, even by her father. But according to Rabbenu Tam, this ruling is specific to being divorced by herself and she may be divorced by her father, and the Ro\"sh agreed with this. ",
            "A minor who was divorced with her father as agent: we should be strict and write two bills of divorce and give them to her. One should be in the formula of all other bills of divorce and the second, \"your daughter plonit that you married to etc....\" Rem\"a: but if the bill of divorce is passed to the minor with her father's knowledge, only one bill of divorce is needed, just like all other bills of divorce. See sections 141 and 37 above. ",
            "If one passes his bill of divorce to a messenger to deliver to his wife, [the messenger] should be appointed in front of two witnesses. ",
            "Afterward, the rabbi should return the get to the husband, and the husband should give it to his agent and say: \"You, Ploni son of Ploni, called Ploni, bring this get to my wife Plonit daughter of Ploni, in whatever place she may be found, and let your hand be as my hand, and your mouth as my mouth, and your words as my words, and your deeds as my deeds, and your giving as my giving. I give you permission to appoint additional agents, even a hundred, without force, until this get arrives in the hand of my wife or her agent, and as soon as this get arrives in her hand or that of her agent, let her be divorced from me and permitted to marry any man as mentioned above.\"  Rem\"a: The wife's agent should take the get as she herself would. And then the rabbi should read the get and ask all of the questions and impose a ban on anyone who has spread rumors about this get, as described in Even HaEzer 154:85. And he should fold it like a letter and give it to the agent, and after that they should write the authorization and not earlier, because the authorization says that it was written in our presence, as detailed in Even HaEzer 141:30. For the laws of a second agent, see Even HaEzer 141:40 and 142:9. And the procedure for the authorization may be found in the order of Gitin. But the precise language does not invalidate it, as I wrote above in 141:30. And when the first agent makes a second one, it seems to me that one should ask him all of the questions that they ask him when he gives the get to the woman, because the second agent says nothing else besides \"I am an agent of the court.\" Therefore, the first court should investigate thoroughly, as described above in Even HaEzer 154:91.",
            "If he gives her the get on a condition, he should say when he gives it to her: \"This is hereby your get, and you are hereby divorced from me and permitted to any man, on the condition that I have not come to you between today and the 12th of the month, and you will have been divorced starting now. But if I come within the aforementioned time, and am seen by so-and-so, let this not be a get, and she is hereby trusted to say that I have not come and not appeased her.\"",
            "If the divorcer is critically ill, he should say to his wife when giving her a get: this is hereby your get and you are divorced by it from me from now, and permitted to marry any man on the condition that if I have not died by such-and-such a day inclusive, it will not be a get, but if I have died by that day, this get will have been in force starting now.  Rem\"a: See above 145:5. And afterwards, she should not be secluded with him unless another is with them, even a servant of a maid, not including her family or her minor son (Tur Siman 148).",
            "A person should be very careful not to complicate matters concerning gittin, unless he is skilled in the laws of gittin, because the laws are full of intricacies, and a person could easily make a mistake that would cause a mamzer. And may the Rock of Israel save us from errors, Amen. Rem\"a: The beginning of this siman details the wording of the get that is customary in this region, especially in this city. And this is the wording: \"On Tuesday, on the third day of the month of Sivan, in the year 5340 since the creation of the world, in the city of Kazmar, which is called Kazimiraz, the city that sits on the Vistula and Wilga rivers (Krakow?) and on spring water-- I, so-and-so called so-and-so, son of so-and-so called so-and-so, standing today in Kazmar, which is called Kazimiraz, the city that sits on the Vistula and Wilga rivers and on spring water, willingly consent, without coercion, to release, send away, and divorce you, my wife so-and-so daughter of so-and-so, who is present today in Kazmar, which is called Kazimiraz, the city that sits on the Vistula and Wilga rivers and on spring water, who has been my wife until now. And I release, send away, and divorce you, such that you are permitted and have authority over yourself to marry any man you want with no interference from now on, because you are hereby permitted to any moan. This is hereby your bill of dismissal, document of sending-away, and letter of divorce from me, in accordance with the Law of Moses and Israel. Signed, so-and-so and so-and-so, witnesses\""

            "THE CONDENSED ORDER OF HALITZA WHICH CONTAINS FIFTY-SEVEN PARAGRAPHS:<br> 1) The commandment of halitza [requires] three judges, even if they are laypeople, as long as they are able to read. REMA: from the outset the custom is to have the wisest of the city along with two of repute from the city, and they are the judges. We also take the two that are added on from the important men of the congregation; and they should not be blind, even in one eye. And there are those that are strict that there not be any blemishes in them at all. And it is praiseworthy for them to ponder repentance in their heart lest they may have sinned and are disqualified from judgement.",
            "2) Each of them must be Israelites; that is, that none of them have a mother or father who converted.",
            "3) Nor should they be relatives of one another, nor of the widow or the brother in law; and even if they have married daughters of two brothers or of two sisters, or a woman and the daughter of her sister, we are strict because of false impressions. REMA: see above at the beginning of this section paragraph 1. ",
            "4) Nor should any one of them be disqualified from judging financial cases. REMA: see above in paragraph 2 at the beginning of this section. ",
            "5) Once the three judges have met together another two are added to publicize the facts. Even if they are simpletons who do not know how to read, or if they are close-relations, the type that would not disqualify them from being judges; but all other factors would disqualify them as it would the first three. REMA: from the outset these two should not be relations of the judges. ",
            "6) A place for halitza should be established, the first three should say to the additional two [judges]: tomorrow we shall go to 'this' place to do halitza there. REMA: and the custom is to go to the place where they will sit the next day and sit there a bit. And the custom is for the additional two to go with the court, but this is not hinder [the halitza if it wasn't done], rather the court just informs the two where they should go and the three [judges] go (so it seems from the Haggahot Mordechai). Yet there are those that say that even the visit does not hinder, just that they say one to another - that tomorrow we will go and do halitza in this particular place (Ohr Zarua). And it isn't required that all three judges speak of it, just that the senior amongst them say it on behalf of the other two (Beit Yosef - so I found it written). Nonetheless, there are those who are strict that each of the three say it. See below in the commentary on the Order of Halitza paragraph 12. ",
            "7) The setting of the place, needs to be on the evening of the day before the halitza. REMA: see below in the commentary to the Order of Halitza paragraph 15. ",
            "8) If the halitza is on Sunday, we do not set the place on the  Sabbath, rather it is done on the eve of the Sabbath. ",
            "9) The place that they set for the halitza, it needs to be at the heights of the town, that is: a well-known place.",
            "10) On the day that they set the place, they send [a message/messenger] to the widow to inform her that on the day of the halitza she should not eat REMA: or drink, anything until she has had halitza. REMA: nor should she spit in front of the court in front of whom she will be having halitza, nor should she speak a lot, nor should she pick her teeth before the halitza. And we repeat these warnings to her on the morning before the halitza as well. And it is the custom for the brother in law to wash his leg the day before the halitza so that it will be easy to wash it on the day of the halitza. It is also good for him to cut his toenails. They [the judges] shall also check on that day if they are of majority age and fitting for halitza. Everything else that needs to be checked - it is better for them to be checked the day before the halitza. They should also teach the brother in law and the widow to read properly, in one breath (all this is explained in the Order(s)).",
            "11) We do not do halitza at night, nor on the Sabbath or a Holy Day, nor on Sabbath or Holy Day eves REMA: but on the intermediary days of a festival we do halitza. (Beit Yosef) ",
            "12) On the day of the halitza the five judges should come to the place they set, and the three primary judges sit on one bench REMA: the senior one sits in the middle. And the two additional (judges) sit in front of them on another bench, REMA: there are those that say they sit on the side, and so is the custom. And the brother in law and the widow stand in the middle. REMA: the brother in law and the widow should go to the judges, and not the judges to them, as it says \"his brother's wife shall go up to the gate to the elders\" Deuteronomy 25:7. Nonetheless, if the judges went to them, the halitza is not negated.",
            "13) Other people are brought in to be there at the time of the halitza, there should be at least five, along with the judges the total should be ten. REMA: therefore the custom today is to go to do the halitza immediately after the end of synagogue morning services, for at that time there are a lot of people, and the senior amongst them should say to his counterpart amongst the community members: let us go to do halitza in the place that we set yesterday.

            "And all of those coming there are required to sit at a distance from the judges. (HaMapach: And no person should sit upon the benches where the judges sit when they perform chalitzah in before them. Also, they must arrange for two competent witnesses and stand them [the witnesses] next to the benches so the judges may inquire concerning the brother-in-law and the widow, to see whether it is appropriate to perform chalitzah. The brother-in-law must dress himself as a mourner, and so too the widow.)",
            "The court should warn the yevama (levirate wife) not to spit in front of the yavam until she removes [the shoe]. Rama:  They should be extremely careful that they do not arrive at [lit.: it shall not arise in their hands] an invalid chalitza, so that she should not need to receive chalitza afterward from all the brothers (Hagahot Alfasi, end of laws of Chalitza), and see infra chapter 170. ",
            "16 - It is necessary that neither the brother-in-law nor the widow be a minor, deaf so as to be unable to hear and speak, mute, or a simpleton. ",
            "It is necessary that the yavam performing chalitza (i.e. undergoing the chalitza ceremony) should not be blind, if he has a brother who is not blind.",
            "It is required that the yavam's foot should not be twisted backward or turned on its side, and also that he does not walk on his toes.",
            "If the yavam is a convert, it is required that the court knows whether his conception and the deceased brother's conception and their birth were in sanctity (from Jewish parentage).",
            "The court must know whether the deceased brother left viable seed. Rama: All these investigations are asked of the witnesses at the time of the chalitza ceremony, so that the matter shall be publicized. And so it is organized here in the text of the Seder Chalitza above from section 16 through section 28. They (the court) also announce publicly that they had already inquired the day before regarding the signs (sexual characteristics) of the man and woman to confirm that they are adults.",
            "The court must know whether this yavam is the paternal brother of the deceased, and whether they \"sat together\" (i.e. if they ever lived at the same time) in the world. ",
            "The court must know if this yavam is the eldest of the [surviving] brothers.",
            "They must know if this woman was the wife of the yavam's deceased brother.",
            "Testimony on these matters is believed from a single witness, even a woman, or [Canaanite] slave or maidservant, or a minor who is aware and wise.",
            "Court should know whether 92 days have passed since the death of the husband. See infra in explanation of the Seder Chalitza section 39.",
            "The court must know if he is left-footed.",
            "The court must know if the yevama is left-handed.",
            "They initially seat the yavam and yevama. Rama: The judges or the chief among them asks the yavam what he requests, and the yavam should tell them that he comes to release the yevama via chalitza, and judge asks the yevama is she desires to undergo chalitza (remove the shoe), and she says, \"yes\".  He then tells them, \"Arise\". The yevama stands to the right of the yavam.",
            "The yavam and yevama stand on their feet. If the yevama desires to undergo levirate marriage, they (the court) say to the yavam, \"If you so desire, release [the yevama] via chalitza, if you desire take her in levirate marriage.\"  He answers that he does not desire levirate marriage. If the yavam prefers levirate marriage and the yevama does not, or she is one of the women who require chalitza release, but (by Rabbinic law) may not undergo levirate marriage, they initially teach him to respond that he does not desire levirate marriage. They say thusly to him, \"Do you desire to release this [woman] your yevama with chalitza?\" and he answers, \"Yes\". Rama: Some say that they always ask whether he wants to perform levirate marriage or to release the woman via chalitza.  Even though chalitza is preferable, they nevertheless ask him so that he explicitly states that he wants to release the woman with chalitza, and they should determine that he was already satisfied with chalitza, and he says that he desires chalitza, and this is the proper custom.  Some add that if the yavam already has a wife, the court tells him that he is still permitted to \"marry\" (i.e. take the yevama in levirate marriage) and this would not run afoul of the excommunication of Rabbenu Gershom [against bigamy]. See also in the Seder Chalitza sections 44 and 46.",
            "The yavam and yevama must know that with this chalitza ceremony she will permitted to marry freely.",
            "He may not be forced into the chalitza ceremony against his will.",
            "If he previously swore to release with chalitza or not to release, they (the court) first release him from his oath. Rama: They should warn the husband (yavam) and wife (yevama) not to answer \"yes, yes\" or \"no, no\", but rather a single yes for a positive response and a single no for a negative response. The should also communicate in the vernacular so that all understand. See also in explanation of Seder Chalitza, chapter 68.",
            "He must first invalidate any prior disclaimers delivered regarding this chalitza. Similarly he must invalidate any witnesses who might testify that he delivered disclaimers regarding this chalitza. The sage should say to the yavam, \"Say: (i.e. repeat after me) I hereby invalidate any disclaimer, and any disclaimer of a disclaimer and so on unto eternity that I may have delivered regarding this chalitza. And any words (conditions) which if they were to be fulfilled would cause this chalitza to be invalidated are hereby invalidated. Similarly I testify regarding myself that I have not delivered any item by which this chalitza would become invalidated. And I hereby disqualify any witness or witnesses who may testify that I delivered or spoke any item that would cause this chalitza to be invalidated or would weaken its strength.  ",
            "The court must take care to avoid (lit.: that there should arise in their hands) any invalid chalitza. ",
            "[The judge] must ask the yevama if she ate or drank today.",
            "The sage shall take the shoe in his hand and inspect it that there shall be no mud stuck on the inside -- Note: and that it is made according to halachic requirements. ",
            "He shall instruct the yavam to carefully wash his right foot. Rama: He shall dry it well, wrap it in a cloth, and walk in it. ",
            "The yavam shall tie the corner of his pants above his foreleg (tibia).  Rama: The judges shall inspect to see that his foot is clean of any dirt. ",
            "The owner of the shoe shall give the shoe to the yavam as a gift -- Note: and the yavam shall make a formal acquisition by lifting [up the shoe]. ",
            "The yavam shall put the shoe on his bare right foot, without any socks, but rather directly contacting his flesh. Note: It should be the proper size for the yavam's foot, and should not reach above the knee.",
            "He shall put the clasps of the shoe into the loops. Rama: There are arrangements (chalitza how-to texts) in which it is written that the arranging Rabbi puts the shoe on to the yavam and ties it properly, but if the yavam is capable of doing it himself there is no reason for concern and it is acceptable. ",
            "He shall tie the straps twice around his foreleg, from the knee and below, and insert them in the eyelets of the shoe such that the straps reach the flesh of his foreleg posteriorly. Note: He shall ascertain that the straps are adjacent one to another as much as possible (all of the above is found in various chalitza arrangement texts). And see further in the explanation of the Seder Chalitza section 58 and section 59.",
            "He shall tie the two straps on the flesh of the foreleg anteriorly, one knot atop the other, tight, with the ends twisted (i.e. tucked and wrapped into the straps).",
            "The yavam must walk four cubits while wearing the chalitza shoe on his foot. Note: He should walk in front of the judges so they can see which is his dextrous foot (ibid). And see also in the explanation of Seder Chalitza section 62.",
            "They stand the yavam next to a wall or pillar so that he may support himself. Note: He should take care not to lean so much that if they removed the pillar he would fall, for this is not called standing.",
            "In all matters of the chalitza ceremony, whether with respect to the recitation, the taking off of the shoe, or the spitting, the judges should be sitting, while the yavam and yevama should be standing. Note: The yevama should be placed facing the yavam so that her speech is directed at him, in front of the court. ",
            "They teach her (the yevama) and the yavam to read, so that he and her will be fluent (in reading the required texts aloud) and able to recite \"lo avah\"  (Deuteronomy 25:7 - he does not desire) in one breath. Note: They explain the nature of the proceedings to the yavam and the yevama, that she will be released from the yavam, and permitted to marry any man, and we ask them to have this intention, and they answer, \"yes\".",
            "They have the yevama recite (in Hebrew): \"My yavam refuses to establish for his brother a name in Israel, he declines levirate marriage\" (Deuteronomy 25:7). The words are narrated one at a time, except [the two words] \"lo avah\" (he declines) are read together. This recitation and the other recitations must be in the holy language. Note: if they (the yavam or yevama) in a word, he should return to the beginning of the text (Seder Maharil).",
            "They have the yavam say, \"I do not want to take her\" (Deut. 25:8). And they say the word, \"to take her,\" with a mappiq in the \"he.\" Moreover, he must say these words in one breath.",
            "The yavam must understand the words of the yevamah, as well as what he [says in] response.",
            "The yavam should lean against the wall or the pillar behind him, and press his leg against the floor. Note: they should warn him not to help the yevama remove his shoe. ",
            "\"And the yevama shall approach him\" (Deuteronomy 25:9), and loosens the knots of the shoe with her right hand, without the assistance of the left. She then opens the clasps, the lowest one first [and proceeding to the top]. She grasps his foot with her left hand, lifts it from the floor, removes the shoe from the heel, and takes off the entire shoe using her right hand without assistance from the left, and without assistance from the yavam, whether from his hand or his leg, and throws the shoe to the ground, at some distance. The yevama remains standing throughout this procedure, bent over but not sitting or kneeling. The Rabbi tells her to gather a large quantity of spittle in her mouth, not a yawn or a sneeze. She should not spit plain water, but only actual spittle. ",
            "The yevama stands opposite the yavam, and shall spit on the floor a large spit in front of his face. The five judges must see the spittle as it leaves her mouth and until it lands on the ground in front of the yavam.",
            "They narrate to her in Hebrew [and she says]: \"Thus shall be done to the man who will not establish his brother's house, and it shall be named in Israel the house of the shoe removal\" (Deuteronomy 25:9-10). [They repeat] \"the house of the shoe removal, the house of the shoe removal\".",
            "Everyone present responds and says, \"the shoe is removed\" three times.",
            "The yavam returns the shoe to the judges. The judges say, \"May it be [G_d's] will that the daughters of Israel shall not come to require chalitza or levirate marriage.\"",
            "I have found written in an Ashkenazic chalitza arrangement: When the yavam and yevama arise, the Rabbi says (a blessing): \"Blessed are you, Lord, our G_d, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with his commandments, and charged us in the commandments and laws of our father Abraham.\" And the reason, as stated in chapter \"Kisui hadam\" (Chullin chapter 6) as reward for Abraham saying \"and to a shoelace\" (Genesis 14:23), his descendents merited the shoe of chalitza. It should be said without saying the name of G-d or his kingship. Rama: There are chalitza arrangements in which it is written to declare excommunication on those who slander the chalitza, but I have not seen people follow this custom. "
