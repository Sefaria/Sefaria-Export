Rem\"a: He who does not marry is not allowed to make a blessing or to engage in Torah etc. and he is not called a man, and when he marries a woman, his sins are cast into doubt, as it is said: \"One who has found a wife has found goodness and obtains favor in the eyes of God.\" (Proverbs 18:22)",

If 20 years go by and he has not taken a wife and he who lets 20 years pass, or he who does not want to marry, the courts can force him to marry in order to fulfill the mitzvah of being fruitful and multiplying. What are the things that might delay marriage? If he is busy with Torah, or if it is too burdensome and he fears to marry a women in order that he is not burdened in his livelihood and he will not fail in Torah it is permitted to delay. Rem\"a: In this time, its custom that one does not force in regards to this.

What are the circumstances for this case? When there are grandchildren, a male and a female, and they came from the son and the daughter (of the obligated individal of halakha 5) despite the fact that the male grandchild comes from the daughter and the female grandchild comes from the son, since they came from his two kids, they fulfill the mitzvah of being fruitful and multiplying. But if he has a son and a daughter and they die and only one grandchild remains he still has not fulfilled his obligation. Rem\"a: if the son is a mamzer or deaf-mute, or an idiot, or a minor, he has fulfilled the mitzvah.",

He may sell a sefer Torah in order to do so if he has a doubt that he has enough children or if he has a doubt that he has married a women of child bearing capability. If he does not have children he sells so that he can marry a woman capable of bearing children but if he has children he should not sell it and marry a woman who is capable of bearing children, but he should not be without a wife. And some say, that even if he has sons, he sells the sefer Torah to marry a woman capable of bearing children. Isserless: However, if it is recognized that the will not be more grandchildren and it is not appropriate that more will not be born to him, he marries a women who is not capable of bearing children, and thus if he has many sons and he fears that if he marries a woman of child bearing age an altercation will come and discord will come between the children and his wife he is permitted to marry a woman who is not capable of bearing children but it is forbidden to settle down without a wife because of this fear.",

If someone wants to marry an inappropriate wife, his family members may protest him. If he does not want to be supervised by them, he may make a type of sign such that their offspring will not intermingle with that of his family; and someone who offered a lot of money for him to get married and then took back the offer (even though they got married) he should not hold his wife like a hostage because of this and he should not quarrel with her over her family's property, and someone who does this will not be successful and the relationship will not be a good one because the money that a man takes along with his wife is not appropriate money; and anyone who does this is called someone who \"marries for money\".

Nevertheless, if you see two families that always irritate one another [Isserless: or two individuals that irritate one another]or you see a family that are upholders of mitzvot and argue always or you see a man that argues disputes with everyone and especially brazen, then we should suspect their lineage and it is fitting to distance oneself from them b/c these are disqualifying characteristics. Similar a person who always invalidates others, for example he puts a stain on the lineage of families or on individuals and he says about them, that that they are mamzerim then we suspect him of being a mamzer. And if he says that they are slaves then we suspect that he is a slave. And all who invalidates others, that blemish (actually) invalidates him. And likewise he who is brazen, cruel, and hates others and he doesn't show them loving kindness we suspect him the most, lest he is gibionite (see Mishnah Torah, Isuri Biya 19:17).",

When the purity of a families lineage has been disputed, whoever two people testify that there was intermingled with one another, a mamzer or a challal or that they have slaves in their lineage, behold this is doubtful. And if it is a family of priests no one may marry a women from them until they will check about her up through four generations because there are eight involved: her mother, her maternal grandmother, the mother of her maternal grandfather, the maternal grandmother of her maternal grandfather. And likewise we check the mothers of the fathers side: the mother of her paternal grandmother, the mother of her paternal grandfather, and the mother of the mother of her paternal grandfather. And if the family that was called into question is a Levite or Israelite they add to the checking of them another one and we find that they check 10 mothers. But a women that is brought to be married doesn't need to check (her husband's family) because kosher women are not warned against marrying blemished men.",

[Isserless: There are some that say this applies only to a family that is known to blend with one of these psulim (inappropriate ones), but an individual that is called thus and keeps quiet, means nothing. There are others who say that all this (from the Mechaber) only applies to earlier generations where Beis Din would keep track of the yichus of families and appropriately apply punishments, so if someone is silent, it can be considered that he admits since he knows that the truth will be revealed. But now, silence is an indication only that he does not want to argue or fight and is thus praiseworthy, so rather today, we accept this as a sign of good yichus as long as he does not cause an argument. Others say that we do not say at all that 'silence is like an admission' and that all this only goes as a sign against the accuser himself and we question his Yichus (not the accused one). Yet, if he is trying to Possel his children in front of him and he remains silent, the silence is never considered and admission (not even by the Mechaber) although, it does raise some concern and reason to check his family. And in all cases, someone who hears troubling words about other matters (aside from Yichus) and he remains silent, this is a clear sign of proper upbringing and that he is appropriate to marry.]",

But [after the fact] if she is married [to a priest], she doesn't need to be divorced because of these two doubts: Maybe she became a widow of this chalal and maybe she is not a widow. Even if you say that she is a widow maybe he is not chalal. [Isserless: And some hold this is Davka for a the widow herself, since she has a chazaka of Kashrus (having been married to a Kohen) but this does not apply to her daughter and if she is already married, he must divorce her. But, others are Maikel and make no distinction between the widow and her daughter)] But if someone who was certainly a chalal marries into a family, then every women in that family is forbidden (to a priest) until he the priest does an investigation. If she was married (without an investigation), she is then divorced. And this is also the rule if a doubtful or certain mamzer marries into a family. [Isserless: Yet all this is particularly for someone about whom it is known, but a family that is blended with (at least one known) passul that is not known to the public, for example this one or that one was tamei and the knowledge of this passul is not appropriate for public exposure, rather we assume a Hazakah of Kashrut that all the families that become tamei in Israel are Kosher in the days of the Messiah and in every place, this is kosher to reveal and demonstrates their modesty. This is davka for a family that is blended with tameiim, but any time that this tuma is not blended (and the passulim are known) then the tameiim should be revealed and publicly announced about them so that kosher people will keep away from them.]",

Thus, it is established as our universal custom not to accept tithings in our time and thus, we have no concern for this practice (of allowing him to read first from the Torah and raising his hands)] And we do not feed him from the kodshim of Israel unless there is at least one witness (that his is in fact a Priest). Nonetheless, he would make himself Assur to marry a divorcee a harlot or a Hallal and he would not be allowed to Metamei himself by the dead, but if he did marry or become tamei, he would suffer whiplashes and the woman whom he married (improperly) [who is for him pasula for Cohanim] a safek H'llala. If he was questioned in a way as to not reveal the purpose of the discussion (L'fi Tumo and reveals that he knows for sure that he is a Cohen) he would be believed.

If then 2 more witnesses came to testify together that he is a Hallal (disqualified) we take him down again. Then, if one more witness came to testify that he is Kosher, we raise him up once again since this last witness combines with the first witness and we have two witnesses that testify that he is Kosher versus two who testify that he is passul.

In which cases do these apply? where the marriage was proper, but if this was through harlotry (or another forbidden relation, but certainly with a Cohen) we silence him from the category of priesthood as we would do if we don't know for certain who is the father (but we are certain that he is a Cohen and not a Halal). What is this case? for example, there are 10 Cohanim out of which one of them and had relations with her (the widow or pnuya); even though he is certainly a priest, such that if he intentionally metameis himself with the dead or marries a divorcee, he would get whiplashes but he would not perform the holy services at the Temple or eat priestly tithings (since he does not know exactly who is his father).

A father is permitted to hug his daughter, kiss her, and sleep next to her with flesh touching, and so too a mother with her son, as long as they are minors. When they grow up, so that the son is an adult, and the daughter is an adult until \"her breasts are formed and her hair grows\" (Ezekiel 16:7), they must sleep clothed. If the daughter is embarrassed to stand before her father naked, or she is betrothed, and likewise if the mother is embarrassed to stand before her son naked – even if they are minors, when they reach the point of being embarrassed, they may not sleep together except clothed."

                "We do not suspect Jewish men of lying with another man or with beasts. Therefore, we do not prohibit them from being alone with them, and if one wants to distance themselves from men or beasts, it is a praiseworthy thing. For the great sages (of old) used to keep beasts at a distance in order that they would not be alone with them. But in these generations because such corrupt people exist one should (therefore) try not be alone with a man."

                "A woman is not considered to be married except by way of betrothal in which the kosher betrothal was done appropriately. However, if he were to lie with her by way of harlotry, without the name of betrothal, it is nothing (towards her status as being a married woman). Even if he lies with her with the intent of marriage, mutually agreed between him and her, she is not considered as his wife and even if she dedicated herself only for him, rather the opposite is true and he must be forced (by Beis Din) to send her away from his home. Rem\"a: For certainly she would be considered an embarrassment for immersion in a mikveh and he will lie with her in ritual impurity (niddah); however, if she dedicates herself exclusively for him as his wife and she immerses for him, there are those who would say that this is allowed and she would be a Pilegesh as described in the Torah and there are those who say that this is forbidden and they should both get whiplashes from the Torah as they have transgressed the precept \"don't be a harlot.\" A Kuti who marries a Kutis and even a Mumar who marries a Mumerres in their (non-Torah) customs and they convert (or want to follow Halacha) afterwards, we are not at all concerned that they had an appropriate betrothal and he is permitted to send her out her without a Get, even though he remained together with her many years, this relationship is not considered anything but simple harlotry (Rivash 6 and Terumat HaDeshen, Part I 209), see Halachah 149:6.",

                "A betrothed woman is considered as a man's wife in that if another lies with her, they will be guilty of adultery and she would need a divorce in order to marry another man.",
                "The woman is betrothed in 3 ways; with money, a document or with intimate relations, as learned from the Torah, but our sages prohibited betrothal by having relations because of impropriety, and if they transgressed this and he betrothed her with relations, he receives rabbinically decreed whiplashes and she is still betrothed. Even if he betrothed her with money or with a document and they did not arrange the marriage agreement beforehand or he betrothed her in the market place, he receives rabbinically decreed whiplashes and she is still betrothed. Rem\"a: There are those who say that we don't give whiplashes if he betrothed her with money or a document, even in the market and without any arrangement and in my life, I never saw someone given whiplashes for becoming betrothed without arrangement.
