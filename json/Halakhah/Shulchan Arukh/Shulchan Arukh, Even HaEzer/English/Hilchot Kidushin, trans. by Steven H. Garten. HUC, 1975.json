In later times it became simply a canopy which was erected out of four sticks and a piece of cloth. There is still debate as to the legal consequences of a <i>Ḥuppah</i>. One view is that the <i>Ḥuppah</i> represents the groom’s home and this fulfills the need for the bride to be brought to the groom’s home for <i>Nissuin</i>.
