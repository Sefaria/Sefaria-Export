                    "A tree has a trunk that lives for many years, which grows branches that bear fruit. And even if it is short and is commonly called a bush - since its trunk lives on from one year to the next - it is considered a tree. For example, we recite the blessing of, \"<i>haetz</i> (the tree),\" on blueberries, since they grow on bushes the trunk and branches of which live for several years. So it is [correspondingly] clear that we recite the blessing of, \"<i>haadamah</i> (the ground),\" over the fruits of a plant that needs to be sown or planted each year.",
                    "A question arose about a plants that live several years, like bananas and pineapples. On the one hand, their trunks wither completely at the end of each year, like fruits of the ground; on the other hand, there is no need to sow them each year, since they grow anew from their roots, and they [also] rise to a height of four meters like big trees. According to the opinion of the Rosh, since its roots live from one year to the other, their blessing is \"<i>haetz</i>.\" But according to the opinion of the Geonim, since its trunk does not live [more than a year], their blessing is \"<i>haadamah</i>\"; and the law been has been determined like that (Shulchan Arukh, Orach Chaim 203:2-3). And a question even came up about papayas. As even though the trunk of the papaya lives many years, it is hollow like a type of thick stalk; and it also already gives off fruit in its first year, like a vegetable. So since there is a question about it, we recite the blessing of \"<i>haadamah</i>\" upon the papaya as well. And we also recite the blessing of \"<i>haadamah</i>\" upon raspberries and blackberries, since they sprout new branches from the ground each year, which give off fruit in the second year and then wilt. And that is why they also do not have a prohibition of <i>orlah</i> (consuming fruit of a tree in its first three years).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Berakhot 40b: \"Where, when you take the fruit, the <i>gevoza</i> does not remain and again produce [fruit], we do not recite the blessing, 'Who creates fruit of the tree'; but rather, 'Who creates the fruit of the ground.'\" In Peninei Halacha, Kashrut 2:8 (pp. 12-13 in the print edition), it is brought down that there are however those who reason that the early commentators disagreed about the definition of <i>gevoza</i>. According to them, it follows that there is a disagreement concerning <i>orlah</i> and the correct blessing for several species. Nevertheless, regarding the law and the correct practice, it appears that all agree that a tree is a plant that that has a trunk and roots that survive and grow stronger from one year to the next, and that this is what gives them the power to have more fruit each year. And that is why we recite the blessing of, \"<i>haetz</i>,\" on capers - even though their branches sometimes all wilt form one year to the next - since its trunk grows stronger from year to year. And in the opposite way, it is understood why we recite the blessing of \"<i>haadamah</i>\" on bananas, eggplant, peppers, papayas and passion fruit. And they accordingly do not have the law of <i>orlah</i>, since their trunk does not get stronger from year to year, but is either regenerated or weakens. Many have erred [about this] concerning raspberries or blackberries, however it is clear that it is a specie that [only] grows for two years at the most. And that is why its law is like fruit of the ground, as explained there in footnote 13.</i> "

                    "And to add to the issue that overeating is harmful to health, it is forbidden for a person to overindulge in physical cravings. And the Ramban explained that therefore the Torah commanded \"you shall be holy\" (Lev. 19:2). If the Torah had not commanded us to be holy, a person could become \"a scoundrel with the permission of the Torah\", to gorge in meat with no limits, and to get drunk in wine and other strong drinks, all the while affirming that they are not doing any transgression, since the meat and wine are kosher to the best degree. Therefore the Torah commanded \"you shall be holy\", that one should not eat like an animal.",
                    "And the Torah has not defined precisely the limits of what eating like an animal looks like because the needs of people differ, there are those with big bodies and those with small bodies, there are those in whom food passes quickly, and therefore they need more food, and there are others in whom food passes slowly, and so they need less food. And there are those whose bodies are similar, but who work in different jobs, one who works hard with manual labor, and so needs more food, and one's friend works in an easy job, and so needs less food."
