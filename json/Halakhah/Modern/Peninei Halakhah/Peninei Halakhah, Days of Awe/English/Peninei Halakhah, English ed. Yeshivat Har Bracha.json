        "Introduction": [
            "A. “Halleluyah! I praise the Lord with all my heart in the assembled congregation of the upright.” (Tehilim 111:1) I thank God for giving me the privilege of learning and teaching Torah. In His great kindness, He has helped me to write about the laws of the <i>Yamim Nora’im</i>, the Days of Awe.",
            "B. As in my previous books, first I discuss generalities and only then go into detail. Within each topic, I first emphasize the underlying principles to which all agree. Thus, the laws are explained clearly and logically from both the halakhic and the philosophical perspectives. (For an illustration of this, see chapter 4, where the laws of <i>teru’a</i> and their significance are discussed.) This methodology makes it clear that often disagreements are not as serious as they may seem at first glance. Examples of such disagreements include the discussion of the time of judgment (1:3-4), the question of what Yom Kippur alone atones for, and what requires repentance as well (chapter 6), the laws pertaining to confession (7:6-7), and the parameters of the mitzva to fast (9:1).",
            "C. The idea of Jewish collectivity is a major theme in the <i>halakhot </i>of the Days of Awe. God chose us from among all peoples to be His special people, designated to manifest His presence and repair the world. The idea of Jewish chosenness is the foundation for repentance and atonement. True, many learned people emphasize the private, individual aspects of repentance. As a result, despite all their intellectual and emotional endeavors, their perspectives remain limited. They ignore the passages of the <i>Seliḥot</i> (penitential prayers), which speak of the redemption of the Jewish people from exile and destruction (below, 2:2-3), as well as the prayers of the Days of Awe, in which the honor of God and Israel are a central theme (3:6). The repentance that we are meant to engage in during the Days of Awe is the repentance of the Jewish people collectively. Just as the Kohen Gadol would confess on behalf of the entire Jewish people, so too, each individual confesses for the entire community, in the plural (7:4). Similarly, in my explanation of the Thirteen Divine Attributes of Mercy, I show that the basis for atonement is embodying and connecting to the attributes through which God is manifested in this world (2:8). I also address the significance of Israel’s unique ability to repent and sustain the world (1:9); the certainty of ultimate repentance (3:4-5); the broader meaning of Yom Kippur (chapter 6); the <i>avoda</i> of the Kohen Gadol (chapter 10); and the special place of the <i>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</i>, which corresponds to the highest level of divine unification (10:2).",
            "It is apparent that the dispersal of the Jewish people across the globe often caused many to neglect the collective basis of repentance and the Days of Awe. However, by studying Torah sources without preconceptions we can see that the roots and foundations of repentance and the Days of Awe lie within the principles of faith in God, the election of Israel, and the promise of redemption, as Rav Kook explains with great elaboration and depth. May it be God’s will that by studying the laws of the Days of Awe and their meaning, we will understand all these fundamental and profound concepts.",
            "D. I still remember walking with my father and teacher, R. Zalman Baruch Melamed, from our home in the Givat Mordechai neighborhood to Yeshivat Mercaz HaRav in Kiryat Moshe on the Days of Awe. Though I was a child, the glorious, awe-inspiring prayers made an indelible impression on me. As long as I could, I prayed there. As the years go by, it becomes clearer to me how deeply its exalted atmosphere continues to influence me. The <i>beit midrash</i> was permeated by the spirit of the yeshiva’s founder, the great luminary of recent generations, our master, Rav Kook, and that of my master and teacher R. Zvi Yehuda Kook. True, R. Zvi Yehuda prayed in the yeshiva’s old building in central Jerusalem, because how could he not pray where his father prayed? Nevertheless, his influence upon those praying in Kiryat Moshe was enormous. I have a vague memory of the prayers of the <i>tzadik</i>, R. Aryeh Levin. On the first day of Rosh Ha-Shana, he led the <i>Musaf</i> service, and on Yom Kippur<i> </i>he led <i>Ma’ariv</i>, <i>Musaf</i>, and <i>Ne’ila</i>. <i>Musaf</i> on the second day of Rosh Ha-Shana was led by R. Mordechai Fromm, a <i>rebbi </i>at the yeshiva and Rav Kook’s grandson-in-law. According to R. Levin, he was recreating the prayers as he heard them in the Volozhin Yeshiva, which trace back to Maharil. After R. Levin passed away, R. Zvi Yehuda asked my father to serve as <i>ḥazan</i> in his place. I heard from our relative, R. Mordechai Sternberg, that the prayers of my father were so similar to the prayers of R. Levin, both in voice and style, that if R. Steinberg closed his eyes it seemed like R. Levin was leading the prayers. My father intoned his prayers in a humble and beseeching manner, like a son trying to appease his father.",
            "In the front, to the right of the <i>ḥazan</i>, sat R. Avraham Shapira, R. Shaul Yisraeli, R. Fromm, and then my father. To the left, facing the <i>ḥazan</i>, was R. Kook’s grandson, R. Shlomo Raanan, may God avenge his blood. I will never forget how he encouraged me to recite together with him the description of the Kohen Gadol’s counting: “One, one and one, etc.” As a child, I wondered about this counting, as it seemed to be very important in light of its prominence in the <i>avoda</i>. As an adult, I continued to wonder about it and its significance. The explanation I offer for it (10:11 below) is dedicated to his memory.",
            "I still remember R. Shabtai Shmueli, the yeshiva’s administrator and one of its first students, chanting “<i>Ha-Melekh</i>” in a trembling voice from his seat, and then walking up to the front to lead <i>Shaḥarit</i>. Later he would also blow the shofar. When he became too weak, my uncle, R. Eitan Eiseman (who walked with us from Givat Mordechai), took his place, becoming the regular shofar blower. My uncle also taught me how to blow the shofar. This provided him with the opportunity to fulfill the words of the Sages: “We do not prevent children from blowing [the shofar on Rosh Ha-shana]. Rather, they may be helped until they learn how to blow” (Rosh Ha-shana 33a; Rema 596:1). I remember the <i>kiddush</i> that the <i>rebbe’im</i> made before <i>Musaf</i> in a classroom with R. Fromm, and the tension in the air in anticipation of the upcoming <i>Musaf </i>prayer.",
            "After Rav Levin passed away, my teacher and master, Rav Shapira, served as the <i>ḥazan</i> for <i>Ne’ila</i>. Following the death of R. Fromm, R. Shapira led <i>Musaf</i> on one of the days of Rosh Ha-Shana as well. When my father moved to Beit El, R. Shapira served as <i>ḥazan</i> for every <i>Musaf</i>. His heartfelt, emotional prayers inspired awe and touched everyone’s heart.",
            "Generally, we prayed <i>Kol Nidrei</i> and <i>Ne’ila</i> in Givat Mordechai. There I had the privilege of praying with laymen, some of whom were Holocaust survivors, and of hearing R. Yehuda Amital <i>zt”l</i> lead the services. His melodies, full of warmth and longing for closeness to God, had an impact on me. Eventually, after R. Amital began to pray at Yeshivat Har Etzion, my father would lead the <i>Ne’ila</i> prayer, which he was doing when the Yom Kippur War broke out and people were called out of synagogue and sent to the front.",
            "When I try to unpack the special atmosphere of Mercaz HaRav, I think that in addition to the enthusiasm found in all yeshivas, there was a unique spirit of earnestness, simple fear of God, tremendous love for all Jews, and idealism. The Torah scholars and students there had a heartfelt connection with soldiers in the army, with settlers making the wastelands of our land flourish, with all the residents of Israel, and with the Jews of the diaspora. Above all, they longed for the dissemination of the Torah of Eretz Yisrael, which would bring redemption to the world. My teacher R. Zvi Yehuda emphasized this in his classes, which I had the privilege of attending during my years in yeshiva.",
            "With this book, I hope to convey some of the inspiration that I was privileged to experience in Rav Kook’s yeshiva during the Days of Awe.",
            "E. Here I wish to thank R. Maor Cayam, who teaches at Yeshivat Har Bracha and who studied with me and supported me throughout. With his talents and diligence, he brought to my attention many sources which helped clarify issues and served as the basis for key explanations and interpretations. He also worked hard preparing the volume of <i>Harḥavot</i>, which provides additional sources and explanations. I also would like to thank R. Bar’el Shevach, who helped clarify various topics, and R. Yonadav Zar, who helped edit the entire book. I thank R. Maor Horowitz for his help in editing the language and content of the book and preparing it for publication. I would also like to thank R. Netanel Rosenstein for writing the index. Thanks to R. Ze’ev Sultanovitch for his advice and enlightening comments. R. Azarya Ariel’s input regarding the <i>avoda</i> of the Kohen Gadol was very helpful, as were R. Yisrael Ariel’s <i>Maḥzor Ha-Mikdash</i> and R. Moshe Odess’s <i>Ve-hashev et Ha-avoda</i>.<br>It is not easy to translate <i>halakha </i>with precision and clarity. I am thankful to the translator, Dr. Yocheved Cohen, to the primary editor, R. Elli Fischer, to the copy editor, Nechama Unterman, and to R. Maor Cayam for reviewing the halakhic contents in translation.",
            "The students of Yeshivat Har Bracha (current and former) and the members of the Har Bracha community are full partners in this book. Experiencing the Days of Awe with them year after year provided me with the opportunity to develop my thinking about the holidays and to put the pertinent laws into practice. While writing this book, the input of yeshiva students and community members helped me clarify many issues. I presented a first draft of this book in a series of lectures whose audience provided important feedback and insightful comments about its content and formulations. The audience was comprised of Sephardim, Ashkenazim, and Yemenites, enabling me to incorporate a wide range of customs. “I learned much from my teachers, even more from my friends, and most of all from my students” (<i>Ta’anit</i> 7a).",
            "F. I would like to express my heartfelt appreciation to my father and teacher, Rav Zalman Baruch Melamed, Rosh Yeshiva of the Beit El Yeshiva, and to my mother and teacher. They have provided me with the foundations of my Torah and my worldview. Special thanks to my dear wife Inbal, who dedicates all her energy to amplifying and glorifying the Torah and encourages my learning and the publication of my books for the public good. May it be God’s will that we have the privilege to see all our sons and daughters, our grandsons and granddaughters, advance in Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>, establish wonderful families, and increase truth, <i>ḥesed</i>, and peace forever.",
            "Finally, I would like to thank all those who dedicate themselves to the holy task of developing the yeshiva and publishing its books: R. Yaakov Weinberger, the yeshiva’s director; Yoni Buzaglo, responsible for printing and distributing; Avishai Greenstein, responsible for marketing; Nechama Rosenstein, who typesets the volumes (including the one before you) and prepares it for print; Yonaton Behar, who actively maintains the strong English social media presence of <i>Peninei Halakha</i>; and R. Elli Fischer, who manages the relationships with our distributors in the English-speaking world<i> </i>and with Sefaria, the latest channel for accessing <i>Peninei Halakha </i>alongside so many other Torah works. May God grant all who help and facilitate the project the necessary wisdom and strength to succeed in their work. May they be privileged to establish fine families. May God fulfill all their hearts’ desires in the best possible way.",
            "And so may Your name be sanctified, Lord our God, through Israel Your nation and Jerusalem, Your city, and Zion, the dwelling place of Your honor, and through the royal house of David Your anointed, and Your Sanctuary and Your Temple. And so instill Your awe, Lord our God, upon all Your works, and Your dread upon all You have created, and all your works will stand in fear of You, and all of creation will worship You, and they will be bound all together as one to carry out Your will with an undivided heart…. And so grant honor, Lord, to Your people, praise to those who fear You and hope to those who seek You, the confidence to speak to all who long for You, gladness to Your land and joy to Your city, the flourishing of pride to David Your servant, and a lamp laid out to his descendant, Your anointed, soon, in our days.<br>(From the <i>Amida</i> of the Days of Awe)",

                    "Each year, God recreates life for every one of His creations. So that His kindness does not reach the wicked, He judges all creatures on Rosh Ha-Shana, granting life<i> </i>and blessing to the good and minimizing them for the wicked. In addition to this being proper and just, it is also necessary to improve the world, for if the wicked were to continue receiving life and blessing, it would reinforce their wickedness, and they would bring harm and curses to the whole world (<i>Shlah</i>).",
                    "Thus, the days on which God draws close to His creations and grants them new life are also the days on which He judges them. These are also the times when repentance is most readily accepted, since God is closer to His creations then. Therefore, even though it is appropriate to repent all year round, repentance is more readily accepted during the ten days between Rosh Ha-shana and Yom Kippur. As the verse states: “Seek the Lord while He can be found; call to Him while He is near” (Yeshayahu 55:6). Accordingly, this period is known as the Ten Days of Repentance (Rosh Ha-shana 18a; MT, Laws of Repentance 2:6).",
                    "Even though judgment does not begin until Rosh Ha-Shana and the Ten Days of Repentance, it is better to begin thinking about repentance beforehand. This way, by the time the Ten Days of Repentance arrive, we can truly return to God. Additionally, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. For as a general rule, before a person is called to account for his sins, it is relatively easy for him to express remorse for them, to rectify them by repenting, and to neutralize the charges against him or at least to minimize them. (This is true for human courts as well.) However, once the time of judgment has arrived and the prosecutor has already laid out his case, it is harder to get the charges dropped (<i>Sifrei</i>, <i>Naso</i> §42). Therefore, Jewish practice is to begin repenting in Elul.",
                    "Each year anew, we approach these days of repentance with fear and joy. We are fearful because we do not know if we will be vindicated before God, nor what sentence we will receive if found guilty. For many people who were complacent at the beginning of the previous year are no longer alive at year’s end, or are alive but suffering. At the same time, we are joyful because we have the opportunity to return to God through repentance, to pray before Him and offer supplications, to cleanse ourselves of the wickedness that stains us, and to reconnect with the principles we believe in. Even if we are condemned to suffer, this is good for breaking sinful habits, allowing us to improve ourselves and our lives.",
                    "Without an annual accounting, the grind of daily life would cause us to forget all the great ideals to which we aspire. Without a vision, we would be overcome by our evil inclination, slaves to our desires, and hostages to our animalistic side. The Days of Awe are our annual reminder of all the great hopes we had, all the topics and books which we wanted to study, and all the good deeds that we wanted to do. We become disgusted with the sins to which we have fallen prey. We are sorry for having committed them, and we confess to them; we re-examine our priorities. All this in hope that the upcoming year will be a good one, during which we will increase our Torah, <i>mitzvot</i>, and good deeds, and dedicate ourselves to improving our families, society, and nation. As a result, we ascend higher and higher each year, improving the world and contributing to it."

                    "The belief that God created and sustains the world is a foundation of faith. Were He to stop infusing the world with life, even momentarily, it would cease to be. God also gave human beings free will. If a person chooses good, he draws down life and blessing upon himself and upon the world. If he chooses evil, he causes suffering and death. This is the judgment according to which God bestows His <i>shefa</i> (a kabbalistic term referring to the bounty or abundance that flows from God to the world) on the world. For when He created the world, He determined that one who draws near to Him will benefit from a <i>shefa</i> of blessing, while one who distances himself will receive less <i>shefa </i>and life, leading to his suffering and death. A person who studies Torah and performs <i>mitzvot</i> clings to God, but one who distances himself from Torah and transgresses its commandments clings to death.",
                    "Thus we read:<br>See, I set before you this day life and prosperity, death and adversity. For I command you this day to love the Lord your God, to walk in His ways, and to keep His commandments, His laws, and His rules, that you may thrive and increase, and that the Lord your God may bless you in the land that you are about to enter and possess. But if your heart turns away and you give no heed, and are lured into the worship and service of other gods, I declare to you this day that you shall certainly perish; you shall not long endure on the soil that you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess. (Devarim 30:15-18)<br>God wants us to choose life, as we read:<br>I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day: I have put before you life and death, blessing and curse. Choose life – if you and your offspring would live – by loving the Lord your God, heeding His commands, and holding fast to Him. For thereby you shall have life and shall long endure upon the soil that the Lord your God swore to your ancestors, Avraham, Yitzḥak, and Yaakov, to give to them. (<i>Ibid</i>. 19-20)",
                    "It is only right and just that one who draws near to God, the Source of life and blessing, consequently merits additional life and blessing. In contrast, one who distances himself from the Source of life is moving away from life, and is thus overcome by disease, suffering, and catastrophe.",
                    "God gave people a wonderful gift when He granted them free will, as this means the good which they receive from God is theirs justly and by right. This knowledge provides them with joy and satisfaction, as they have earned everything through their own efforts. If God just gifted everything to people, they would not experience the same joy and satisfaction (Ramḥal, <i>Derekh Hashem</i> 1:2).",
                    "To that end, God’s judgment must be true, precise, and specific, taking into account each and every deed, each and every word, and each and every thought. True, a person is judged in accordance with the majority of his deeds and is vindicated in judgment if his deeds are mostly meritorious. Nevertheless, he is punished for every sin he does not rectify through repentance. Similarly, even if a person is condemned because most of his deeds are evil, he still receives reward for every mitzva he does. The just King knows how to make these calculations, and He determines when reward and punishment will be meted out (<i>Bava Kama</i> 50a; <i>Ḥagiga</i> 5a).",
                    "God wishes to bestow benefit on His creations, as we read, “The Lord is good to all, and His mercy is upon all His works” (Tehilim 145:9). The purpose of punishment is to correct, not to avenge. Punishment in this world is meant to direct a person so that he leaves sin and returns to the proper path, as we read, “The Lord your God disciplines you just as a man disciplines his son” (Devarim 8:5). If one has not repented in this world and is still stained by evil, even if he has merits, he cannot be the recipient of divine goodness. Therefore, he is condemned to suffer in Gehinom, where he is purged of evil. Only then can he ascend to Gan Eden, as we read: “The Lord deals death and gives life, casts down into Sheol and raises up” (1 Shmuel 2:6). Those who are entirely wicked are eradicated in Gehinom (Rosh Ha-shana 17a; <i>Pesikta Rabbati</i> §40; <i>Nefesh Ha-ḥayim</i> 1:12)."

                    "As we have seen (section 1 above), blessing and judgment are linked, for when God bestows life upon the world, He also passes judgment upon it, determining who will be granted life and blessing, and who will not. Since God recreates life on Rosh Ha-shana for the next year, it is the primary time of judgment for the whole world.",
                    "Thus, the Sages state, “On Rosh Ha-shana, all of humanity pass before Him like sheep, as we read (Tehilim 33:15), ‘He who fashions the hearts of them all, Who discerns all their doings’” (Rosh Ha-shana 16a). They also state: “Just as a person’s earnings are determined on Rosh Ha-shana, so are his losses” (Bava Batra 10a).",
                    "Even though judgment primarily takes place and is inscribed on Rosh Ha-shana, it is sealed on Yom Kippur. Therefore, the days between them are a time for repentance and prayer to improve the judgment. R. Meir states: “All are judged on Rosh Ha-shana, and the verdicts are sealed on Yom Kippur” (Rosh Ha-shana 16a). Similarly, the Sages state: “All of a person’s earnings are determined between Rosh Ha-shana and Yom Kippur” (<i>Beitza</i> 16a).",
                    "Even though the judgment is sealed on Yom Kippur, in exceptional circumstances it is still possible to improve or annul it until Hoshana Rabba and Shemini Atzeret. This is because the angels responsible for carrying out sentences receive their instructions then, so it is the final stage of the yearly judgment (<i>Zohar</i> III 33b; <i>Peninei Halakha: Sukkot</i> 6:1).",
                    "While Rosh Ha-shana is the general day of judgment for the entire year, the Mishna states that the three festivals are days of judgment for particular features. On Pesaḥ, judgment is passed about grain; on Shavu’ot, judgment is passed about fruit; and on Sukkot, judgment is passed about water (Rosh Ha-shana 16a). Since holy days are a conduit for divine blessing to descend to the world, there is consequently judgment then associated with the blessings they convey. The timing of the holidays reflects natural processes. Sukkot is at the start of winter (the rainy season in Israel), so it is the conduit for the blessing and judgment of water. Pesaḥ is when crops grow, so it is the conduit for the blessing and judgment of the crops. Shavu’ot is when fruit begin to grow and ripen, so it is the conduit for the blessing and judgment of fruit. In other words, on Rosh Ha-shana the general fate of water, crops, and fruit is determined, while the detailed judgment is reserved for later: water on Sukkot, grain on Pesaḥ, and fruit on Shavu’ot (<i>Peninei Halakha: Festivals</i> 1:2).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Gemara (Rosh Ha-shana 16a) explains that the Mishna accords with the academy of R. Yishmael, which states: “The world is judged four times a year: on Pesaḥ for grain, on Shavu’ot for fruit, and on Sukkot for water. People are judged on Rosh Ha-shana, and the judgments are sealed on Yom Kippur.” In contrast, R. Yehuda states, “Everything is judged on Rosh Ha-shana, but each judgment is sealed at its own time: grain on Pesaḥ, fruit on Shavu’ot, and water on Sukkot. People are judged on Rosh Ha-shana, and the judgments are sealed on Yom Kippur.” It would seem that their disagreement is minor. The academy of R. Yishmael maintains that the specifics of water, grain, and fruit are determined during the holidays, although of course they are influenced by the general judgment of Rosh Ha-shana. (Ramban makes a similar point in his Rosh Ha-shana sermon: the general judgment is on Rosh Ha-shana, while the specifics of water are determined on Sukkot, etc. This is how I formulated it above.) In contrast, according to R. Yehuda, everything is determined on Rosh Ha-shana, including the specifics of water, grain, and fruit. It is only the sealing of the judgment that takes place on the various holidays. Ran, in his commentary on <i>Rosh Ha-shana</i> 16a, has a different approach. He writes that the general judgment for water is on Sukkot, the one for grain is on Pesaḥ, and the one for fruit is on Shavuot; it is only what each individual will be allotted of these three that is determined on Rosh Ha-shana.</i>"

As it manifests, it can be diverted toward good or evil. The principle is that the holy days are meant to draw blessing into the world, each day in accordance with its special character. Accompanying the blessing is judgment, so that the blessing reaches the deserving.",
                    "Since the blessing descends via <i>Rashei Ḥodashim</i>, they, too, are days of judgment and thus propitious times for repentance, atonement, and forgiveness. There is a custom among the pious to repent on the day before Rosh Ḥodesh (also known as Yom Kippur Katan).",
                    "Shabbat, too, is holy and blessed, and through it, blessing extends to the six weekdays. So that this blessing manifests properly, one should repent on Shabbat – albeit out of love, good cheer, and optimism, without pain.

Accordingly, each day a person is judged with regard to the unique <i>shefa </i>of that day. As R. Yose said: “A person is judged every day” (Rosh Ha-shana 16a). In fact, every hour presents a unique opportunity to reveal a certain aspect of holiness, and thus there is an element of ever-present judgment. This is the meaning of R. Natan’s statement: “A person is judged every hour” (<i>ibid.</i>). Because of the blessing and judgment that take place daily, we recite <i>Shaḥarit</i>, <i>Minḥa</i>, and <i>Ma’ariv</i> daily, to improve the blessing and judgment specific to that day.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Similar ideas appear in a responsum attributed to Rif; R.

Rav Kook explains that while the judgment passed on Rosh Ha-shana is not immutable, the judgments of Rosh Ḥodesh and weekdays have far more impact (<i>Midbar Shur</i>, <i>derush</i> 9).</i>",
                    "The judgments passed on Rosh Ḥodesh, Shabbat, and every other day do not alter the judgment inscribed and sealed at the beginning of the year, for while judgment is inscribed and sealed at the beginning of the year, the way it is implemented is not, and the implementation has significant ramifications, for better and for worse. Consider a national budget; it is passed by the legislature at the beginning of the year, and the government has no authority to alter it. Nevertheless, every minister can determine how it will be distributed, and even bureaucrats have the power to direct funding toward one project or another. (See <i>Berakhot</i> 58a.)",
                    "Similarly, the deeds done all year can direct the judgment for better or for worse. The Gemara elaborates (Rosh Ha-shana 17b):<br>What is an example of “for better”? Let us say the Jews were completely wicked as of Rosh Ha-shana, and therefore were allotted only a small amount of rain. Later, they repented. It is not possible to send more rain, for the decree has already been made. Rather, God brings [the rain] at the optimal times, on the land that needs it, depending on the land. [Thus, minimal rains can still bring great blessing.] What is an example of “for worse”? Let us say that the Jews were completely righteous as of Rosh Ha-shana, and therefore a lot of rain was allotted to them. Later, they relapsed. It is not possible to send less rain, for the decree has already been made. Rather, God brings it at the worst times, on land that does not need it [so they do not benefit from the rains].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sometimes it is impossible to divert judgment for the better because the verdict was so decisive; for example, if so little rain was allotted that even if it is optimized, there will be a severe drought. Nevertheless, a community has the great power that if they repent wholeheartedly and pray to God concerning it, they can tear up even a final verdict (Rosh Ha-shana 17b). An individual cannot completely tear up a verdict, but he can improve it by repenting and crying out to God from the bottom of his heart – such that if there is any possible interpretation of the judgment that would minimize the punishment, it will be minimized. For example, if death was decreed for a person, there is still some leeway. Through his repentance and prayer, it is possible that death will be replaced by poverty, exile, or very humiliating experiences, all of which are compared to death. This is why R. Yitzḥak says, “Prayer is helpful to a person, whether before or after judgment has been rendered” (Rosh Ha-shana 16a and 18a). This means it is admirable and has an effect, even though it does not invalidate the judgment (Ran and Maharal <i>ad loc.</i>). There is a tradition passed down by the house of King David that “even if a sharp sword is resting upon one’s neck, one should not stop praying” (<i>Berakhot</i> 10a).</i>",
                    "The ideal sequence is as follows. We repent during the month of Elul, and accept God’s kingship on Rosh Ha-shana, leading to a good initial judgment. We continue to ascend spiritually by repenting on Yom Kippur, leading to a better final judgment. With this momentum, we continue to walk in God’s ways. We absorb the <i>shefa </i>of holiness on Shabbat, holidays, and Rosh Ḥodesh, thus increasing the illumination and blessing present in every day, hour, and minute."

                    "<b>Judgment, Reward, and Punishment / Judgment and the Next World</b>",
                    "How a person is judged on Rosh Ha-shana relates to his life in this world and the next. We have discussed the implications for this world in the previous sections and will yet discuss them further, but at present we will explain how the judgment of Rosh Ha-shana relates to the next world. First, we must explain that life in the next world has two stages. The first stage begins with a person’s death, when his soul ascends to the world of souls, where there is Gan Eden (heaven) for the righteous and Gehinom (hell) for the wicked. The next stage is after the world reaches its perfection with the resurrection of the dead. At that time, souls will reunite with bodies, and together they will experience an infinite ascent (Ramban, <i>Sha’ar Ha-gemul</i>; Ramḥal, <i>Derekh Hashem</i> 1:3; <i>Shelah</i>, <i>Toldot Adam</i>, <i>Beit David</i>).",
                    "The next world, including both its stages, is also called the “World of Truth,” because, in contrast to this world, where falsehood dominates and external appearances obscure internal essence, in the next world the true stature of a person and the true worth of his deeds become clear.",
                    "Since the next world is incomparably more important than this world, as “this world is like a corridor leading to the next world” (<i>Avot</i> 4:16), the judgment which occurs on Rosh Ha-shana primarily relates to the next world. This judgment can be divided into two parts. The first takes into account all the deeds of the past year. For a person’s good deeds, reward awaits him in the next world; for his evil deeds, punishment awaits him. But the judgment passed on Rosh Ha-shana is not final. If he repents over the years, he can save himself from Gehinom and increase his reward in the next world. If, God forbid, he regrets the good deeds he has done and wishes them undone, he will go to Gehinom and lose the reward that had been reserved for him in the next world.",
                    "The second aspect of judgment that relates to the next world concerns opportunities to draw close to God in the upcoming year. One who has been judged to life on Rosh Ha-shana will have opportunities during the year that will help him continue to ascend in Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>, through which he will merit life in the next world. When he studies Torah, he will attain greater enlightenment and understanding; when he is engages in <i>mitzvot</i> and good deeds, he will attain greater happiness and blessing, a foretaste of the next world. If, God forbid, his judgment is for death, then during the next year he will face trials and difficulties likely to distance him from God and lose him his place in the next world. Even when he studies Torah, it will be hard for him to absorb the divine light within it; even when he engages in <i>mitzvot</i>, he will not properly feel the sanctity and joy they bring. This is the meaning of the Sages’ statement (<i>Avot</i> 4:2): “A mitzva brings another mitzva and a sin brings another sin, for the reward for a mitzva is a mitzva, and the punishment for a sin is a sin” (<i>Nefesh Ha-ḥayim</i> 1:12).",
                    "In general, reward is called “life” and punishment, “death.” Life means closeness and connection with God, the Source of life. This closeness allows a person to experience all the goodness that God brings to this world and the next. God is the Source of all the goodness of life; all the pleasures and delights of this world flow from His <i>shefa</i>. But they are only a pale reflection of the ultimate pleasure, namely closeness to God. The Sages state, “One hour of spiritual bliss in the next world is better than all of life in this world” (<i>Avot</i> 4:17). This is because in the next world, one can enjoy the radiance of the <i>Shekhina</i> and take pleasure in God; life there is intensified immeasurably. In contrast, the divine light which reaches us in this world is filtered and constricted. Nevertheless, by drawing closer to God through Torah study and mitzva observance, a person can experience the equivalent of the next world in this world, taking pleasure in his closeness to God.",
                    "While reward is referred to as “life,” punishment is referred to as “death,” meaning distance from the Source of life. The distance leads to the suffering and death of the body in this world, and the suffering of the soul in the next.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Gemara (<i>Rosh Ha-shana </i>16b) states:<br>Three books are opened on Rosh Ha-shana: one for those who are entirely wicked, one for those who are entirely righteous, and one for those in between. The entirely righteous are immediately inscribed and sealed for life, the entirely wicked are immediately inscribed and sealed for death, and those in between are in limbo from Rosh Ha-shana until Yom Kippur. If they merit it, they are inscribed for life; if not, they are inscribed for death.<br>What do the Sages mean by “life” and “death”? According to <i>Tosafot</i>, they are speaking of life in the next world. This is also the position of R. Yosef Gikatilla (<i>Sha’arei Ora</i>, Gate 8). However, Ramban, Ran, Rashba, and others maintain that the Sages are referring to life in this world. It would seem that these positions are not truly in conflict, as reward in this world primarily affects life in the next world, since this world is but a corridor leading to the next (Rama Mi-Fano, <i>Asara Ma’amarot</i>, <i>Ḥikur Ha-din</i> 2:21; Ramḥal, <i>Derekh Hashem</i> 2:2; Vilna Gaon, <i>Bi’ur Ha-Gra</i>, OḤ 582:24; R. Ḥayim of Volozhin in his exposition at the end of <i>Nefesh Ha-ḥayim</i>). Being inscribed for life may also include experiencing a bit of the illumination of the next world while in this world. This is a fulfillment of the blessing, “May you see your world in your lifetime” (<i>Berakhot</i> 17a). See <i>Orot Ha-kodesh</i> 3:122.</i>"

                    "The broad principles of judgment are straightforward. One who walks in God’s ways is blessed in both this world and the next, while one who is wicked is punished in both this world and the next. However, the specifics of judgment are immeasurably deep and complex. Therefore, there are instances of the righteous suffering poverty, disease, and untimely death, while sometimes the wicked prosper and endure. There are many possible reasons for this, as we will explain below, all of which are meant to improve the world.",
                    "First of all, one must know a fundamental principle: To perfect the world, people must have free choice. As long as the world has not been perfected, it runs according to the laws of nature and fate that God determined, so it is not possible for all the righteous to thrive and all the wicked to suffer. Therefore, judgment, as it applies to individuals, is incredibly complex and involves myriad details. There are always righteous people suffering and wicked people appearing to enjoy the pleasures of this world. Thus, free choice is unimpaired, and one who chooses good improves himself and the entire world.",
                    "Nevertheless, over the long term, for example, when it comes to families and true happiness in life, we find that in this world, too, usually the righteous experience blessing while the wicked suffer. The crux of our challenge is to disregard our evil inclination, which urges us to take a superficial, myopic view of the world, and instead to follow our good inclination, which encourages us to look further and more deeply. Thus, even though in this world, too, the righteous, over the long term, attain benefit and the wicked suffer, free choice remains intact, because this truth is not discernible over the short term.",
                    "Let us begin to explain some specifics. One person may be destined to be wealthy and face the challenges that accompany wealth. Even if he sins greatly, he will remain rich. His judgment on Rosh Ha-shana is about the circumstances of his life as a wealthy person. Will he find joy in his wealth, or will it cause him endless worry? With respect to the next world, will his wealth help him to withstand trials, be they minor or major? Might it even help him in serving God? Another person may be destined for poverty. Even if he is righteous, he will remain poor. The question is simply whether his poverty will be bearable or unbearable. With respect to the next world, will his impoverishment help or hinder his service of God? In rare cases, a person can change his destiny through outstanding merits or grave sins.",
                    "Sometimes a person’s destiny is not absolute, but only determines a direction that allows for change. In such cases, the judgment of Rosh Ha-shana can determine whether someone destined to have money will be comfortable, rich, or fabulously wealthy, or whether someone destined to be needy will be needy, poor, or destitute.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Children, life, and sustenance do not depend upon merit but upon fate (<i>mazal</i>)” (<i>Mo’ed Katan</i> 28a). The Gemara’s proof is that Rabba and R. Ḥisda were both righteous; when there was a drought, the prayers of both were answered. Yet R. Ḥisda lived to the age of 92, while Rabba died at 40. R. Ḥisda’s household celebrated 60 weddings, while Rabba’s home suffered 60 bereavements. R. Ḥisda’s home was wealthy, and even the dogs were fed the highest grade of wheat. Rabba’s home was poor, and people did not always have enough of even cheap barley bread. Another Gemara sheds light on this. R. Ḥanina asserts that Jews are subject to <i>mazal</i>, while R. Yoḥanan and Rav maintain that they are not (<i>Shabbat</i> 156a). According to <i>Tosafot</i>, even those who maintain that Jews are not subject to <i>mazal</i> do not mean that it has no effect, but rather that someone with great merit can change his fate (as explained in <i>Yevamot</i> 50a). However, sometimes, even with great merit, <i>mazal</i> does not change, as we see in the case of R. Elazar b. Pedat (<i>Ta’anit</i> 25a).<br>It is important to note that only individuals are subject to <i>mazal</i>, not the collective. The reward and punishment discussed in the Torah are collective (<i>Responsa Rashba</i> 1:148). However, individuals, with great spiritual effort, can ascend to the level of the collective, beyond the reach of <i>mazal</i>. It should be further noted that the Torah’s this-worldly rewards and punishments are primarily promised to Israel as a people, to be delivered naturally. Thus, free will is not compromised, since individuals are still subject to fate. (See section 8 below.)</i>"

                    "Sometimes a person is destined to be neither rich nor poor. Rather, his destiny is not fixed; if he chooses well in matters of money and charity, then he deserves to be wealthy so that he can continue to improve his piety and charity. Yet sometimes it is known to the Knower of secrets that if a certain person were to become wealthy, his evil inclination would overcome him and perhaps make him arrogant, lustful, and stingy; he would no longer be righteous. Since people’s relationship to God is the most important thing and their eternal life depends on it, heaven has mercy upon him and sentences him to struggle to make a living. This way he avoids the difficult challenge and is more likely to earn a place in the next world. Without such mercy, he may become wealthy in this world but face challenges likely to corrupt him.",
                    "Another consideration is how difficult it is for a person to choose good or avoid evil. Some people are born with a very strong evil inclination or grow up in very difficult and toxic environments. If they manage to study a bit of Torah and do a few good deeds, it is extremely impressive, and they will receive immense reward. As the Sages say, “In accordance with the pain is the reward” (<i>Avot</i> 5:23). Other people are born with a strong good inclination or grow up in a supportive environment. If they nevertheless sin, they will be punished severely.",
                    "Another consideration is that sometimes a wicked person who has done a few <i>mitzvot</i> is rewarded for them in this world, so that he is utterly destroyed in Gehinom. Similarly, sometimes a righteous person who has committed a few sins receives his punishment in this world, so that he can ascend, pure and clean, to Gan Eden. Even though reward and punishment in this world are trivial compared to the next, these judgments are still just and proper, for the wicked person performed <i>mitzvot</i> with superficial motivations, because he wanted to show off and impress people, so it is fitting that his reward be given in this superficial, transient world, rather than in the World of Truth. In contrast, the primary interest of the righteous person was closeness to God. If he sinned accidentally, just as his sin was superficial, so is his punishment. This will purify him and he will enter the next world without blemish (<i>Kiddushin</i> 39b; <i>Derekh Hashem</i> 2:2:6).",

The main point from the human perspective is to repent and return to God, for even if we do not understand the profundity of the judgment, we are certain that repentance and good deeds are always good for a person. Reward is primarily in the next world and secondarily in this world. As long as a person is alive in this world of free choice, his actions are of incalculable value and earn him eternal reward. This is as the Sages say, “One hour of repentance and good deeds in this world is better than the whole of life in the World to Come” (<i>Avot</i> 4:17)."

                    "It is important to know that even though on Rosh Ha-shana the Jewish people as a whole as well as each individual are judged, the judgment of the individual is strongly impacted by the general state of whichever nation that person belongs to. This is as we learned about the nation of Israel in the section dealing with blessings and curses:<br>If you follow My laws and faithfully observe My commandments, I will grant your rains in their season so that the earth shall yield its produce and the trees of the field their fruit. I will grant peace in the land…. You shall give chase to your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword…. I will be ever present in your midst; I will be your God, and you shall be My people…. But if you do not obey Me and do not observe all these commandments…I in turn will do this to you: I will wreak misery upon you – consumption and fever, which cause the eyes to fail and the body to languish; you shall sow your seed to no purpose, for your enemies shall eat it…. I will break your proud glory. I will make your skies like iron and your earth like copper, so that your strength shall be spent to no purpose. Your land shall not yield its produce, nor shall the trees of the land yield their fruit…. I will lay your cities to waste and make your sanctuaries desolate, and I will not savor your pleasing odors…. And you I will scatter among the nations, and I will unsheathe the sword against you. Your land shall become a desolation and your cities a ruin…. You shall not be able to stand your ground before your enemies but shall perish among the nations; and the land of your enemies shall consume you…. (Vayikra 26:3-38)",

For even if the nation as a whole merits a <i>shefa</i> of blessing, this does not mean that a few individuals cannot be punished for their sins. Similarly, if the nation as a whole is punished, this does not mean that a few individuals cannot be rewarded. However, sometimes there is a contradiction between the judgment of the nation and that of the individual. For example, if a harsh decree such as destruction or exile has been issued against the nation, the righteous, perforce, will also suffer. Nevertheless, the judgment stands, and the righteous will receive their reward in the world of souls, in Gan Eden. Similarly, if the nation as a whole is good, the wicked will not receive their punishment in this world but in the world of souls, in Gehinom.

This division is the “death” that was Adam’s punishment. His soul and body were separated. As a result, reward and punishment cannot be fully realized in the physical world. Rather, a small part is meted out in this world and a larger part in the World of Souls (i.e., in Gan Eden and Gehinom). Reward and punishment are completed at the time of the resurrection of the dead, when the physical world will be perfected, the worlds will be reunited, and body and soul will become one again. Part of the uniqueness of the Jewish nation is that it represents the unity of body and soul, vision and deed, even in our current imperfect world. Even when the Jewish people are damaged spiritually or physically, their spiritual and physical core remain. Therefore, even in this world, they experience true life. See the next section.</i>",

It appears as if God has left the earth and evil rules the world; the wicked prosper and the righteous suffer. The same forces of evil that destroyed the Temple allow the wicked to prosper. Just as the <i>Shekhina</i> is suffering in exile, so too, the righteous are drowning in pain and suffering. Additionally, when harsh decrees are passed against the Jews, all individual Jews suffer as a result.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Similarly, <i>Tanya </i>(<i>Igeret Ha-teshuva</i>, ch. 4-6) explains that at a time of destruction and exile, we can fathom “neither the tranquility of the wicked nor the suffering of the righteous” (<i>Avot</i> 4:15), for God’s role is concealed, and the power of impurity is strengthened by sins. This is the meaning of the exile of the <i>Shekhina</i>. It is imprisoned by the husks of impurity, and the goodness directed toward it is hijacked by the <i>sitra aḥra </i>(the “other,” demonic side) to strengthen the wicked and harm the righteous.

Thus, the Gemara declares, “God made a condition with the act of creation and said, ‘If the Jews accept the Torah, you will continue to exist; if not, I will return the world to chaos’” (<i>Shabbat</i> 88a). Ever since the Torah was given to the Jews, the world’s existence has depended upon their adherence to it. Furthermore, the redemption of the world depends upon the repentance of the Jews. Since Israel bears such a great responsibility, when they sin, their punishment is more severe than the punishment that other nations would incur for the same sin.

                    "The month of Elul and the Ten Days of Repentance are particularly auspicious for repentance, as this is the period when God agreed to forgive the Jewish people for the sin of the Golden Calf. Forty days after the Torah was given, when Moshe had not yet descended from Mount Sinai, a group of sinners persuaded the people to make a golden calf as a replacement for God’s authority. At that moment, a great anger was kindled against Israel. It was serious enough that God said to Moshe, “Now, let Me be, that My anger may blaze forth against them and that I may destroy them, and make of you a great nation” (Shemot 32:10). Moshe prayed fervently and reminded God of the merits of the patriarchs and matriarchs, thus delaying the punishment. Then he descended the mountain, shattered the Tablets, and, together with the tribe of Levi, executed the sinners. He melted down and pulverized the calf, mixed the ash with water, and made all the Israelites drink from it. The water served as a litmus test, and those who had worshipped the calf died. Nevertheless, the threat of destruction still hovered over Israel. Displaying a spirit of self-sacrifice, Moshe stood before God and declared, “Now, if You will forgive their sin [well and good]; but if not, erase me from the record which You have written” (<i>ibid</i>. v. 32). Following this declaration, the decree was lifted. However, Israel was still disgraced and distant from God. It was as if they were no longer His children, His servants, or His special nation. Furthermore, the first Tablets lay in pieces.",

On Yom Kippur, their repentance was fully accepted. Moshe descended to give the Jews the second set of Tablets and to inform them that they were forgiven. As an indication of their renewed closeness and specialness, God commanded them to erect a <i>Mishkan</i> (Tabernacle), through which the <i>Shekhina</i> would be revealed to them. Since the timing of important events is not accidental, we see that the forty days from Rosh Ḥodesh Elul until Yom Kippur are particularly auspicious for repentance.",

The shofar was then blown in the camp, to let it be known that Moshe was ascending the mountain again and that Israel must not repeat their mistake. God ascended on that day through those same shofar blasts, as we read, “God ascends with a blast (<i>teru’a</i>); the Lord, with the sound of a shofar” (Tehilim 47:6). Therefore, the Sages ordained that the shofar be blown each year on Rosh Ḥodesh Elul.

Many Sephardim also blow the shofar when reciting the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy. Blowing the shofar in Elul is not obligatory, but it is proper for communities to try to do so.

Yemenites, too, blow at the end of <i>Seliḥot</i>, with some also blowing during the recitation of the Thirteen Attributes. In contrast, Ashkenazic custom is to blow four shofar blasts (<i>tashrat</i>) at the end of <i>Shaḥarit</i>. R. Waldenberg points out that this is the custom during communal prayer, not individual prayer (<i>Tzitz Eliezer</i> 12:48). From Rosh Ḥodesh Elul until Shemini Atzeret, Ashkenazim customarily recite <i>Le-David Hashem Ori Ve-yish’i </i>(Tehilim ch. 27) following the shofar blowing, as well as at the end of <i>Ma’ariv</i> (or <i>Minḥa</i>).</i>"

This is done primarily to inspire people to repent, ask God for forgiveness and atonement, and beg Him to be merciful to His exiled and suffering people. We ask that He not look at our sins and transgressions, but rather that He remember His covenant with our ancestors and with us. We ask Him to remember the sacrifice of Yitzḥak and all the martyrs who sacrificed their lives to sanctify His name. We also pray for the ingathering of the exiles, the rebuilding of Eretz Yisrael, Jerusalem, and the Temple, and the return of the <i>Shekhina</i> to Zion. It is customary to recite <i>Seliḥot</i> specifically during the Ten Days of Repentance because it is a time of judgment and prayer is more readily accepted then. It is proper for every individual to join the community and pray fervently for the Jewish people, for the <i>Shekhina</i> to dwell among us, and for God’s name to be sanctified in the world. Through this, one’s personal prayers will be accepted as well.",

Bring together the old, gather the babes and the sucklings at the breast. Let the bridegroom come out of his chamber, the bride from her canopied couch. Between the portico and the altar, let the priests, the Lord’s ministers, weep and say: “Oh, spare Your people, Lord! Let not Your possession become a mockery, to be taunted by nations! Let not the peoples say, ‘Where is their god?’” Then the Lord will be roused on behalf of His land and have compassion upon His people. (Yoel 2:15-18)",

                    "When the Jews returned from Babylonia with Ezra, they had serious spiritual problems, similar to those we are experiencing today. Through repentance, though, they merited to build the Second Temple. The Book of Ezra makes this clear. Ezra left Babylonia for Eretz Yisrael only to discover that many Jewish men, including officials and dignitaries, had married non-Jewish women. In Ezra’s own words:<br>When I heard this, I rent my garment and robe, I tore hair out of my head and beard, and I sat desolate. Around me gathered all who were concerned over the words of the God of Israel because of the returning exiles’ trespass, while I sat desolate until the evening offering. At the time of the evening offering, I ended my self-affliction; still in my torn garment and robe, I got down on my knees and spread out my hands to the Lord my God, and said, “O my God, I am too ashamed and mortified to lift my face to You, O my God, for our iniquities are overwhelming and our guilt has grown high as heaven. From the time of our fathers to this very day, we have been deep in guilt. Because of our iniquities, we, our kings, and our priests have been handed over to foreign kings, to the sword, to captivity, to pillage, and to humiliation, as is now the case. But now, for a short while, there has been a reprieve from the Lord our God, Who has granted us a surviving remnant and given us a stake in His holy place; our God has restored the luster to our eyes and furnished us with a little sustenance in our bondage. For bondsmen we are, though even in our bondage God has not forsaken us, but has disposed the kings of Persia favorably toward us, to furnish us with sustenance and to raise again the House of our God, repairing its ruins and giving us a hold in Judah and Jerusalem. Now, what can we say in the face of this, O our God, for we have forsaken Your commandments…. After all that has happened to us because of our evil deeds and our deep guilt – though You, our God, have been forbearing, [punishing us] less than our iniquity [deserves] in that You have granted us such a remnant as this – shall we once again violate Your commandments by intermarrying with these people who follow such abhorrent practices? Will You not rage against us till we are destroyed without remnant or survivor? O Lord, God of Israel, You are benevolent, for we have survived as a remnant, as is now the case. We stand before You in all our guilt, for we cannot face You because of this.” (Ezra 9:3-15)",
                    "Ezra’s anguish, fasting, and prayers awakened the nation to repentance, as we read, “While Ezra was praying and making confession, weeping and prostrating himself before the House of God, a very great crowd of Israelites gathered about him, men, women, and children; the people were weeping bitterly.” They accepted God’s covenant, and the men agreed not to remain with the women and children who were unwilling to convert. “So Ezra at once put the officers of the priests and the Levites and all Israel under oath to act accordingly, and they took the oath” (<i>ibid</i>. 10:1-5). Nevertheless, since many Jews did not repent, and many did not come to Eretz Yisrael but remained in Babylon, the presence of the <i>Shekhina</i> was not as strong in the time of the Second Temple as in the First, and ultimately the Second Temple, too, was destroyed on account of our sins.",

Some are even worried that there is an element of falsehood in reciting such <i>Seliḥot</i>. However, if we see the Jewish people as a nation that transcends history, with each and every one of us linked to all Jews in all times and all places, we can recite even these exilic selections and identify deeply with them. For we identify with our ancestors who lived in exile and suffered such horrible tribulations and degradations that they almost lost hope. We identify with the Jews who experienced anti-religious persecution by Muslims and Christians, and who were tortured and martyred during the Crusades, the Inquisition, and the Chmielnicki Massacres. Most recently and most devastating of all, we identify with the victims of the terrible Holocaust which took place less than eighty years ago. How can we be so complacent as to say that the supplications of the <i>Seliḥot</i> are no longer appropriate, when there are still survivors among us who endured the ghettos and the concentration camps, and the world is still filled with monsters who openly proclaim that they hope to continue the work of the Nazis?

Nevertheless, there is a basic framework that all communities follow and which appears in <i>Seder R. Amram Gaon</i>.

Accordingly, one should not recite “<i>Makhnisei Raḥamim</i>” (“Purveyors of Mercy”), which is mentioned in <i>Seder R.

Likewise, according to this view, one may not recite the <i>piyut</i> “<i>Midat Ha-raḥamim aleinu hitgalgeli</i>” (“Attribute of Mercy, Descend upon Us”) as it is addressed to a divine attribute and not directly to God. However, most <i>poskim</i> permit the recitation of these <i>piyutim</i>, which were composed long ago by Torah giants, and which Jews have been reciting for hundreds of years. The rationale seems to be that as long as the supplicant knows that everything is in the hands of God, he may ask the angels to fulfill their mission, namely, to transport our prayers to God and remind Him of our merits (R. Sherira Gaon; R. Eliezer of Worms; <i>Shibolei Ha-leket</i> §252: Mahari Bruna). Indeed, this is the practice of most communities, which have not expunged such <i>piyutim</i> from the <i>siddur</i>. Others maintain that fundamentally the stringent position is correct. Nevertheless, they do not want to eliminate these <i>piyutim</i> entirely, because of the long-standing custom to recite them. To resolve the dilemma, they adjust the formulations of the prayers slightly, rephrasing them so that it is clear that the prayers are addressing God, asking Him to teach the angels how to transport our prayers to Him (Maharal, <i>Netivot Olam</i>, <i>Netiv Ha-avoda</i> ch. 12; this was the practice of R. Zvi Yehuda Kook). Alternatively, some rabbis took their time reciting the prayers earlier in <i>Seliḥot</i> in order to ensure that they would not have time to recite the problematic ones.

By reciting the Thirteen Attributes we deepen our faith, connecting with God in such a profound way that it becomes clear that our sins are peripheral and external to us, and thus we can easily repent for them.

Kabbalistic sources usually call them <i>ze’er anpin</i> (smaller face) and <i>arikh anpin</i> (greater face). In <i>Da’at Tevunot</i> §134 and many other places, Ramḥal calls them governance through law (<i>hanhagat ha-mishpat</i>) and governance through unification (<i>hanhagat ha-yiḥud</i>). Normally God relates to Israel through law, according to which everything depends on a person’s actions. If he chooses good, he receives blessing; if he chooses evil, God’s <i>shefa</i> is withheld from him. However, God also relates to the world in a more elevated, hidden way. It is through this relationship, referred to as unification, that the world constantly advances and progresses toward its redemption. Even at low points of sin and punishment, God directs matters behind the scenes to ensure the continued elevation of the world. This relationship is dependent upon God’s covenant with Israel, which is expressed in the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy.

He told his servants and soldiers, “Let’s go there!” By the time the king and his entourage had traveled ten parasangs, the residents heard of his journey, and were frightened. What did they do?

He asked, “Who are you?” They responded, “We are people from such and such a city, to which you sent tax collectors, but we cannot pay.

If someone would like to maintain the custom of fasting on Erev Rosh Ha-shana, but he finds it difficult, he should give charity instead.

The term “<i>zikaron</i>” (remembrance) in reference to God means that He comes to someone’s aid and grants them life. So that His kindness is not turned into wickedness by wicked people who would use it for evil, God ordained that blessing would be granted based on one’s deeds throughout the year. If one chooses good, he merits a <i>shefa </i>of goodness and blessing, whereas if he chooses evil (God forbid), the <i>shefa</i> of goodness is minimized, and the person consequently suffers much grief and pain.

We see this with Shabbat, <i>Shemita</i>, and many other important sevens (<i>Ḥiddushei Aggadot</i> on <i>Rosh Ha-shana</i> 10b, commenting on <i>Vayikra Rabba</i> 29:11). Taking Rabbeinu Tam’s approach one step further, we can suggest that while the world was actually created in Nisan, every year it takes seven months before the Jews can appreciate its deep significance. Accordingly, God judges His creations on the first of Tishrei, which is referred to as <i>Yom Ha-zikaron</i>, corresponding to the time the world was created in thought. Rosh Ha-shana was established on the day of man’s creation even though this did not take place until the sixth day, because humankind is the main purpose of creation (<i>Shlah</i>, <i>Toldot Adam</i>, <i>Beit Yisrael</i> §1).</i>",
                    "The halakhic significance of Rosh Ha-shana as the “new year” pertains to the dating of contracts, counting years for <i>Shemita</i> and <i>Yovel</i>, and separating <i>terumot</i> and <i>ma’asrot</i>. We shall now explain.",
                    "Every contract must be dated, as it must be clear when the obligations it entails begin; pre-dated contracts are invalid. The first of Tishrei is the new year for documentary purposes (Rosh Ha-shana 8a). During the times of the Amora’im and Ge’onim, contracts were dated according to the Seleucid era (<i>minyan shtarot</i>). At the end of this era, Jews began dating documents from the world’s creation. This is the current practice for all contracts, including marriage and divorce documents.",
                    "Likewise, when the years are counted to determine Sabbatical and Jubilee years, the year begins in Tishrei (Rosh Ha-shana 8b). We are also commanded to separate <i>terumot</i> and <i>ma’asrot</i> from the produce of each year; one may not tithe from the produce of one year for the produce of another, as we read: “You shall set aside every year a tenth part of all the yield of your sowing that is brought from the field” (Devarim 14:22). Rosh Ha-shana is when the new year begins for this purpose (Rosh Ha-shana 12a).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The year to which vegetables are assigned is determined by when they are picked, while the year to which grains are assigned is determined by when they have reached a third of their full growth. This also has implications for whether one must take <i>ma’aser sheni </i>(on years 1, 2, 4, and 5 of the <i>Shemita </i>cycle) or <i>ma’aser ani </i>(on years 3 and 6 of the<i> Shemita</i> cycle). While the year for vegetables and grains begins with Rosh Ha-shana, for fruit trees it begins with Tu Bi-Shevat. That is, on Tu Bi-Shevat, the age of the tree is incremented by one.<br>The parameters of the mitzva of <i>orla </i>are a bit different. We are commanded not to eat a tree’s fruits during its first three years, and the fruits of the fourth year are to be eaten in purity in Jerusalem. These years are counted from the first of Tishrei. For example, let us say that someone planted a tree on the fifteenth of Av. It takes two weeks for a tree to take root. After taking root, the tree is alive for an additional month before Rosh Ha-shana. These six weeks are the minimum amount of time necessary for the tree to be considered to have completed a year, so Rosh Ha-shana marks the beginning of its second year. Two more years must pass before its fruits are no longer deemed <i>orla</i>. However, since the new year for trees is Tu Bi-Shevat, one must wait from Rosh Ha-shana until Tu Bi-Shevat to eat the fruits. The fruits themselves are assigned to a year based on when they blossom (SA YD 294:4).<br>According to tradition, the first year of <i>minyan shtarot </i>corresponds to the year Alexander the Great became emperor (MT, Laws of Divorce 1:27), in 3449 from creation (312 BCE). This was the conventional dating system in the Seleucid Empire. It was in use throughout the latter part of the Second Temple era, and Jews used this system until medieval times. In fact, some Yemenite communities still record this date in <i>ketubot</i>. For more on the laws discussed in this section, see R. Shlomo Yosef Zevin, <i>Ha-mo’adim Ba-halakha</i>, Rosh Ha-shana, section 2.</i>"

                    "While Rosh Ha-shana is a <i>yom teru’a</i> and a day of judgment, it is also a sacred occasion, which we are commanded to sanctify though food and drink and honor with nice clothes (<i>Sifra</i>, Emor 12:4; <i>Peninei Halakha: Festivals</i> 1:7). Half the day should be devoted to God, as on Shabbat and holidays. However, since the prayer services are very long on Rosh Ha-shana, they reduce the time available to study Torah, though it is important that prayer and study together amount to at least nine hours (as explained in <i>Peninei Halakha: Festivals</i> 1:5-6).",
                    "Based on textual similarities in the Torah’s description of the various holidays, the Gemara concludes that the holidays share several features (<i>Shevu’ot</i> 10a), and just as there is a mitzva to rejoice on the three pilgrimage festivals, so too, there is a mitzva to rejoice on Rosh Ha-shana by eating meat and drinking wine. It, too, is therefore called a “festival,” as we read: “Blow the shofar on the new moon, the covered moon for our festival day” (Tehilim 81:4).",
                    "However, since it is also a day of <i>teru’a</i> and judgment, the level of happiness is not the same as on the rest of the festivals. This is why in the <i>Amida</i> we do not add the phrase “festivals for rejoicing, holy days and seasons for joy” as for other festivals (SA 582:8), nor do we recite <i>Hallel</i>. The angels asked God about this: “‘Why don’t the Jews sing [<i>Hallel</i>]<i> </i>before You on Rosh Ha-shana and Yom Kippur?’ He replied: ‘Is it conceivable that the King is sitting on the throne of judgment with the books of the living and the dead opened before Him, yet the Jews burst into song?’” (Rosh Ha-shana 32b; <i>Arakhin</i> 10b; SA 584:1; see <i>Peninei Halakha: Festivals</i> 2:7).",
                    "Therefore, there is a mitzva to serve two festive meals, one at night and one during the day, and joyfully consume meat and wine. However, Rishonim write that a person should not eat to satiety on Rosh Ha-Shana, so that he does not come to act frivolously. Rather, he should stand in awe of God (SA 597:1). We see that the meals on Rosh Ha-shana should be better and more joyful than those of Shabbat, but not as lavish as those of the pilgrimage festivals.",
                    "Similarly, there is a mitzva to wear nice clothes and to wash them before the holiday. However, we do not wear our nicest clothes as we do on the other festivals, because of the fear of judgment. Some have a custom to wear white on Rosh Ha-shana (SA 581:4; MB <i>ad loc.</i> 25). One whose hair is too long and looks disheveled must get a haircut in honor of Rosh Ha-shana. One who is normally clean-shaven must shave before Rosh Ha-shana (SA 581:4).",
                    "The dual nature of Rosh Ha-shana can be learned from Ezra the Scribe, who, in addition to encouraging the people to repent, instructed them to rejoice on Rosh Ha-shana, as it is a day consecrated to God. Early in the time of the Second Temple, when the Jewish community in Eretz Yisrael was becoming established after returning from the Babylonian exile, many of the simple people did not observe <i>mitzvot</i> properly. On Rosh Ha-shana, Neḥemia the political leader and Ezra the spiritual leader gathered the nation together, men and women, to inspire them to repent. Ezra read from the Torah, starting in the morning and continuing until midday, explaining the Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> to them. When the listeners understood that they had sinned, they were inspired to repent, and they began to mourn and cry. Ezra and Neḥemia emphasized that it was a day to rejoice in addition to repenting:<br>“This day is holy to the Lord your God; you must not mourn or weep,” for all the people were weeping as they listened to the words of the Torah…. “Go, eat choice foods and drink sweet drinks and send portions to whoever has nothing prepared, for the day is holy to our Lord. Do not be sad, for your rejoicing in the Lord is the source of your strength.” The Levites stilled the people, saying, “Hush, for the day is holy; do not be sad.” (Neḥemia 8:9-11)<br>Ezra and Neḥemia instructed the people to eat delicacies and drink sweet drinks in fulfillment of the mitzva of eating meat and drinking wine. Additionally, this would serve as a good omen for abundance and sweetness for the entire year (Rosh, <i>Rosh Ha-shana</i> 4:14). “Then all the people went to eat and drink and send portions and make great merriment, for they understood the things they were told” (Neḥemia 8:12). They understood that God was not interested in punishing them, but rather was happy with their repentance.",
                    "Nevertheless, in the times of the Ge’onim and Rishonim there were pious and wise people who fasted on Rosh Ha-shana. It stands to reason that given the tribulations of exile, they felt the need to identify with the pain of the <i>Shekhina</i>. How could they joyfully eat on the day of judgment while the <i>Shekhina</i> was in exile? They wished to facilitate a more profound repentance by indulging in certain ascetic practices in the hopes of neutralizing evil. In practice, though, the accepted <i>halakha </i>is that even during the bitter days of exile, there is a mitzva to have festive meals on Rosh Ha-shana, and it is certainly forbidden to fast.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As we have seen, the Gemara (<i>Shevu’ot </i>10a) compares all holidays to one another, Ezra instructed the people to rejoice on Rosh Ha-shana (Neḥemia 8:9-12), and the Mishna mentions that on Erev Rosh Ha-shana, the people slaughtered a large number of animals for the holiday. <i>Yere’im</i> §227 and <i>Responsa Maharil</i> §128 therefore maintain that there is a mitzva to rejoice on Rosh Ha-shana. This is why Rosh Ha-shana cancels the mourning periods of <i>shiva</i> and <i>shloshim</i> (SA YD 396:6). <i>Sha’agat Aryeh</i> §102, <i>Yafeh La-lev</i> 2:1, and other Aḥaronim agree that there is a mitzva to be happy on Rosh Ha-shana.<br>In contrast, others maintain that since Rosh Ha-shana is not a pilgrimage festival and no <i>shalmei simḥa</i> are offered on it, there is no specific mitzva to be happy then. However, since it is a sacred occasion, when it comes to honor (<i>kavod</i>) and pleasure (<i>oneg</i>) it is similar to Shabbat. This is the opinion of <i>Maḥzor Vitri</i> §322; <i>Yam Shel Shlomo</i>, <i>Beitza</i> 2:4; SAH 529:5-6. They base themselves on the fact that in the Rosh Ha-shana <i>Amida</i>, we do not say “festivals for rejoicing, holy days and seasons for joy.” (True, there are some Ge’onim who say that we do recite “festivals for rejoicing” in the <i>Amida</i>, but they are not followed in practice, as pointed out by R. Hai Gaon; Rambam; Rosh, end of Rosh Ha-shana; and SA 582:8.)<br>Rambam writes (MT, Laws of<i> </i>Yom Tov 6:17) that there is a mitzva to rejoice on all the festivals, including Rosh Ha-shana. However, elsewhere he writes that the joy of Rosh Ha-shana is not as intense (MT, Laws of Ḥanuka 3:6). Similarly, <i>Sefer Ha-aguda </i>states that people should eat and drink and rejoice, but should not eat to satiety, so that they will feel lacking and thus stand in awe of God. This is also the position of <i>Shulḥan Arukh</i> (597:1) and many Aḥaronim. We see that there is an obligation to drink wine and eat meat on Rosh Ha-shana, but not in as great quantities as on other festivals. If, however, one prays with the proper awe, and afterward wishes to fulfill the mitzva of joy to the utmost and to eat and drink in quantity as on other festivals, it would seem that he may do so, since many Rishonim and Aḥaronim permit this, in accordance with Ezra’s instruction to rejoice greatly.<br>Some Ge’onim maintained that it is a mitzva to fast on Rosh Ha-shana (<i>Otzar Ha-Ge’onim</i>, <i>Beitza</i> 4b), and some Rishonim did so, as recorded in <i>Or Zaru’a</i> 2:257. It is reasonable to assume that they agreed that there is a mitzva to rejoice on Rosh Ha-shana, and that they did so at night. Nevertheless, they felt that it was proper to fast during the Ten Days of Repentance because of the anguish of the Jews in exile. They felt that this would be permissible even on Shabbat and Rosh Ha-shana, just as it is permissible to fast on Shabbat or festivals following a bad dream. Many other Ge’onim, including R. Sa’adia and R. Hai, forbade fasting, and <i>Shulḥan Arukh</i> cites their view (597:1). There is an opinion that someone who fasted once on Rosh Ha-shana is obligated to continue this custom for the rest of his life, even if he fasted only because of a bad dream. If he chooses to eat, he endangers his life (<i>Sefer Ha-agur</i>). <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> cites this as well (597:2-3), although <i>Kol Bo</i> and R. Yitzhak Tyrnau in his <i>Sefer Ha-minhagim</i> say that one does not have to take this into account. Rema writes that someone who is not worried about this may eat on Rosh Ha-shana in subsequent years, as long as he does <i>hatarat nedarim</i>. This is the position of MB <i>ad loc.</i> 9 and the general custom.</i>"

The way of the world is that a person facing judgment wears black, wraps himself in black, and lets his beard and nails grow, because he does not know what the outcome will be. But Israel do not do this.

The simplest understanding of this is that God will bless us with a good year, as usually happens. But we also know that sometimes, because of a sin’s gravity or the world’s imperfection, God sees that it is best for a person to suffer or die, so that the person refines and corrects his deeds, thus earning true life in the next world. Even though we would like God’s goodness to reveal itself to us in this world without suffering, we have yet to deserve this. Nevertheless, we know that the judgment is for our own good, and we should celebrate it (<i>Shlah</i>, <i>Masekhet Rosh Ha-shana</i>, <i>Torah Or</i> §17).",

A day of sanctity is one on which we abstain from weekday work and worries and manifest the holiness of the day through Torah, prayer, and rejoicing in the mitzva with festive meals. Had we not been commanded to celebrate Rosh Ha-shana, we would likely spend the whole day making personal requests, dreading judgment. This would not help our case. On the contrary, it would harm us, for sin happens when people forget their sacred mission and focus on personal issues. Instead, the sanctity of the day is a vehicle for the Jewish people to manifest God’s kingship in the world. This inspires them to repent out of love, meriting a favorable judgment and a blessed new year."

For this reason, the third <i>berakha</i> of the <i>Amida</i> concludes with “<i>ha-Melekh ha-kadosh</i>” (the holy King) instead of the usual “<i>ha-Kel ha-kadosh</i>” (the holy God). We continue using this alternative conclusion throughout the Ten Days of Repentance. This change is so significant that if one forgets to make it, and concludes with “the holy God,” he has not fulfilled his obligation and must repeat the <i>Amida</i> (SA 582:1; 5:2 below). On Rosh Ha-shana, we add sections to this <i>berakha </i>to pray for God to reveal His kingship:<br>And so may Your name be sanctified, Lord our God, regarding Your people Israel, regarding Your city Jerusalem, regarding Zion, the dwelling place of Your glory, regarding the royal house of David, Your anointed, and regarding Your place and sanctuary… Every creature will revere You, and all of creation will bow before You, and they will be bound together to carry out Your will with an undivided heart… All wickedness will dissipate like smoke when You remove wanton governance from the earth. And You will reign – You, Lord our God, alone – over all that You made, on Mount Zion, the dwelling place of Your glory, and in Jerusalem, Your sacred city.",
                    "The conclusion of the holiday-themed fourth <i>berakha</i> in every <i>Amida </i>as well as in <i>kiddush </i>on Rosh Ha-shana is: “King over all the earth, Who sanctifies Israel and the Day of Remembrance.” In <i>Musaf</i>, the main prayer of Rosh Ha-shana, during which we blow the shofar, our Sages instituted three central <i>berakhot</i>,<i> </i>each of which comprises an entire section of the <i>Amida</i>: <i>Malkhuyot</i>, <i>Zikhronot</i>, and <i>Shofarot. Malkhuyot</i>, the first of these <i>berakhot</i>, is the foremost of these <i>berakhot </i>and mentions the holiness of the day. It, too, concludes: “King over all the earth, Who sanctifies Israel and the Day of Remembrance.” We see that the primary theme of <i>Yom Ha-zikaron</i> is crowning God king. In truth, <i>Zikhronot</i> also relates to God as the King of the world, Who remembers all of His creations. Similarly, <i>Shofarot</i> deals with the manifestation of His kingship in the world by means of the shofar. This is both reminiscent of Sinai and a foreshadowing of the future, for it is the blowing of a great shofar that will gather all the exiles, who will then bow before God in Jerusalem. Our shofar blasts manifest His kingship as well; due to the dread they instill, we stand before Him broken and repentant.",

However, the Jews are unique in that their deeper desire is for God’s kingship to be manifest and for the whole world to be repaired and redeemed, even if they will need to suffer to attain that goal. This is the great, awe-inspiring path that the Jewish people have chosen, from the times of our patriarchs and matriarchs, who chose to believe in God despite all the idolatry around them, through the long exile when, despite all their suffering, the Jewish people chose not to assimilate and instead continued to carry the banner of faith and Torah, to establish the world under the kingship of God.",

Thus, Israel is granted a new year in which they will take another step toward repair and redemption.

During the second half of the month, the moon wanes progressively until, at the end of the month, it is invisible to us for about twenty-four hours. It then once again appears as a tiny sliver, and a new month begins. There is a mitzva, practiced in times past, for those who saw the new moon on the thirtieth night of the month to testify before the supreme <i>beit din</i>, and based on this testimony, the <i>beit din</i> would sanctify the month. Since the moon’s cycle is about twenty-nine and a half days, sometimes a month has twenty-nine days and sometimes thirty. (See <i>Peninei Halakha: Zemanim</i> 1:1-2.)",

Based on this, people knew when the holiday would take place. However, because these messengers did not have time to reach distant diaspora communities before the holiday, in those communities there was doubt about its date. Therefore, the Sages ordained that holidays in the diaspora should be celebrated for two days (<i>Peninei Halakha: Festivals</i> 9:1-4).",
                    "Rosh Ha-shana is the only holiday that coincides with the beginning of a month. When the <i>beit din</i> sanctified the month, it meant that very day was a holiday. Messengers could not set out to let people know when the month was sanctified, since travel outside of the <i>teḥum</i> was now forbidden.

Therefore, due to uncertainty, the people had to observe the holiday starting the night of the thirtieth of Elul. If witnesses later arrived (on the thirtieth) and testified that they had seen the new moon, the <i>beit din</i> sanctified the month, and it was clarified retroactively that the day was indeed Rosh Ha-shana. The next day was a weekday. If the witnesses did not arrive on the thirtieth, it became clear that the thirtieth was really a weekday and the holiday would be the next day. Thus, when the <i>beit din</i> sanctified the month on the thirtieth, in Jerusalem the holiday was celebrated for one day; when the new moon was sanctified on the following day, two days were observed even in Jerusalem.",

Since the court theoretically could convene anywhere in Eretz Yisrael, only one day should be celebrated there. In practice, though, the opinion of the decisive majority of Rishonim is that even in Eretz Yisrael, Rosh Ha-shana should be celebrated for two days, because in practice, even when the month was sanctified based on witnesses, in most of Eretz Yisrael two days were observed. Even in Jerusalem, where the court was located, if witnesses did not arrive on the first day, Rosh Ha-shana was observed for two days. True, witnesses almost always arrived on the first day.

Furthermore, the Sages did not want to make a distinction between Jerusalem and the rest of Eretz Yisrael. Therefore, they ordained that two days should be celebrated everywhere. This is similar to the way they ordained that all Jews living outside Eretz Yisrael should celebrate the festivals for two days, even though there were areas where the messengers did arrive before Shemini Atzeret and the last day of Pesaḥ.

This can be compared to a flashlight: When illuminating a nearby location, the light is strong and focused on a small area. In contrast, when it is used to illuminate a distant location, the light is weaker and more diffuse (<i>Derekh Mitzvotekha </i>114:1).

                    "Perhaps we can suggest that the prayers of the first day are primarily directed toward collective matters – that we may merit that God’s kingship manifests over His people, Israel, and over Zion, the dwelling place of His glory, so that every living being will say, “The Lord, God of Israel, is King, and His kingship has dominion over all.” Through this, the whole world will attain blessing and peace. In contrast, in the prayers of the second day (which was established by the Sages), we ask for all these lofty ideals to be realized in our individual lives as well. We ask to be partners in revealing God’s glory in the world in our day-to-day lives, and thus to merit divine blessing.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Zohar</i> (Pinḥas 231b) explains that the first day is one of uncompromising judgment (<i>dina kashya</i>), while the second is one of milder judgment (<i>dina rafya</i>).

                    "Nowadays we have a calendar and know when Rosh Ha-shana is. Thus, the first day of Rosh Ha-shana is Torah-mandated, while the second day is rabbinic. This is true for all the holidays in the diaspora as well – the first day is Torah-mandated and the second is rabbinic. Therefore, if doubts arise concerning the laws of Yom Tov or shofar, on the first day we are stringent, following the principle, “When there is uncertainty about Torah law, we are stringent.” In contrast, on the second day we are lenient, following the principle, “When there is uncertainty about rabbinic law, we are lenient.” Thus, the Sages permitted performing burials on the second day of Yom Tov and Rosh Ha-shana, for the sake of the dignity of the dead (SA 526:4; <i>Peninei Halakha: Festivals</i> 7:5).",
                    "It is also forbidden to prepare on the first day of Rosh Ha-shana for the second day. This prohibition includes cooking, setting the table, and washing the dishes. These laws are the same as those concerning preparing on the first day of Yom Tov for the second day in the diaspora (SA 503:1; <i>Peninei Halakha: Festivals</i> 9:5, 2:12).",
                    "However, there are some differences between the two days of Yom Tov celebrated in the diaspora and the two days of Rosh Ha-shana. The two days in the diaspora were grounded in uncertainty as to which day the court had sanctified the month. In contrast, Rosh Ha-shana was sometimes celebrated for two days even when there was no doubt as to its date. This happened when the witnesses arrived in the late afternoon of the first day. In this case, the Sages ordained that their testimony not be accepted lest the <i>beit din </i>sanctify the month without leaving enough time to offer all the holiday sacrifices and to recite the special psalm for Rosh Ha-shana. However, since the first day was worthy of being sanctified, the Sages ordained that the day continue to be observed as a holiday, even once it was decided that it would not be sanctified. Since Rosh Ha-shana sometimes extended to two days due to this law, the Sages called the two days of Rosh Ha-shana “one long day” (“<i>yoma arikhta</i>”).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An egg laid on the first day of Yom Tov may be eaten on Yom Tov Sheni. The egg is prohibited on the first day due to <i>muktzeh</i>, but on the second day, no matter which side of the uncertainty is correct, the egg is no longer <i>muktzeh</i>. If the first day was the true Yom Tov, then the second day is a weekday, and thus the egg may be eaten. If the second day is the true Yom Tov, then the first day was a weekday, and the egg laid on it is not <i>muktzeh</i>. The same applies to fish caught on the first day and fruit that fell from a tree on the first day: None of them are <i>muktzeh</i> on the second day. In contrast, since Rosh Ha-shana sometimes had to be observed for two days even when there was no doubt as to its date, we relate to the two days as one long day. Therefore, if an egg is laid, fish are caught, or fruits fall from a tree on the first day, they remain <i>muktzeh</i> on the second day (SA 600:1). Despite the fact that for these purposes the two days of Rosh Ha-shana are regarded as one long day, we are not lenient when it comes to preparing on the first day of Rosh Ha-shana for the second. In that case, the rules are the same as for holidays in the diaspora: It is forbidden to prepare from the first day to the second, as is explained in SA 503:1. Thus, the two days of Rosh Ha-shana are considered to be one day only when it comes to stringencies, but not when it comes to leniencies (Rabbeinu Peretz, <i>Hagahot Smak</i> n. 10 on <i>Smak</i> §294).</i>",
                    "For this reason, it is unclear whether the <i>berakha</i> of <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> should be recited on the second day. In the diaspora, on the second day of Yom Tov, the <i>berakha</i> is recited; since the second day was established on account of uncertainty, its <i>mitzvot</i> are the same as those of the first day. In contrast, on Rosh Ha-shana, since the two days are considered one long day for some purposes, some say that <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> should be recited only on the first day.

These women were so exceptionally righteous that they were destined to give birth to children whose souls were radically new. These souls could not be born naturally, which is why their mothers remained barren for so long. It was only through the renewal of Rosh Ha-shana that they could be helped. Most of the Torah reading, however, tells of the banishment of Yishmael. We can learn two principles from this: 1) Despite the pain it caused, the banishment of Yishmael was not in any way immoral. Had it been, the Sages would not have ordained its reading on Rosh Ha-shana, as they would not have wanted to provide the accusers with material. 2) Especially on Rosh Ha-shana, the day of judgment, it is important to distinguish between the Jewish people and the rest of the nations, who are not willing to accept upon themselves the great and awe-inspiring mission of repairing the world under the kingship of God – just as it was necessary to separate Yishmael from Yisrael.",

Additionally, water symbolizes purity and life. When a person elevates himself through repentance, he is purified and cleansed. It is as if his sins are washed away in purifying waters. Furthermore, <i>Tashlikh </i>includes a petition to God to cast all the accusers created by our sins into the depth of the seas and never be recalled.

You shall observe it as a day of blasts (<i>yom teru’a</i>)” (Bamidbar 29:1), and “In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall observe complete rest, a sacred occasion commemorated with loud blasts (<i>zikhron teru’a</i>)…” (Vayikra 23:24).",
                    "The word “<i>teru’a</i>” denotes brokenness. Thus, we read, “Smash them (<i>tero’em</i>) with an iron mace; shatter them like potter’s ware” (Tehilim 2:9). The word “<i>tero’em</i>” means breaking. Similarly, we read, “The earth is breaking, breaking (<i>ro’a hitro’a’a</i>). The earth is crumbling, crumbling. The earth is tottering, tottering” (Yeshayahu 24:19). It also says, “They shall lay waste (<i>ve-ra’u</i>) to the land of Assyria with the sword” (Micha 5:5), meaning they will smash the land of Assyria (Rashi). Similarly, Onkelos translates “<i>yom teru’a</i>” as “a day of wailing.”",
                    "While <i>teki’a</i> expresses joy and stability, <i>teru’a</i> alludes to brokenness, fear, tears, and radical change. Similarly, God instructed the Israelites in the desert to blow a <i>teki’a</i> on the trumpets when they needed to gather the people, as <i>teki’a</i> expresses joy and togetherness. In contrast, when they needed to go out to war or leave their encampment and move on, they were instructed to blow a <i>teru’a</i> (Bamidbar 10:1-7), for a <i>teru’a </i>represents brokenness, tears over that which is finished but imperfect, and apprehension about what comes next (3:2 above).",

We face the accuser, and we do not know who will live and who will die, who will be healthy and who will suffer. God, in His mercy, commands us to blow <i>teru’ot </i>with the shofar and thereby mitigate the judgment, for by accepting His kingship and judgment, we are inspired to repent. Therefore, even though the <i>teru’a</i> is short, it expresses the character of the day. This is why Rosh Ha-shana is referred to as <i>Yom Teru’a</i> – a day of brokenness and tears, fear and trepidation.",

The Torah commandment is to hear three sets of <i>teki’a</i>-<i>teru’a-teki’a</i> (Rosh Ha-shana 32b, 34a).",
                    "The first <i>teki’a</i> of each set expresses the natural uprightness of the soul, as that of small children who have yet to sin and who are still innocent and pure. As a child matures, though, he is exposed to the complexities and dilemmas of this world; he struggles and is tested; he fails and sins. This is expressed by the <i>teru’a</i>, sighing or crying about our character defects and the sins to which we have succumbed. After this, another simple <i>teki’a</i> completes the set. It again expresses goodness and rectitude, but this time it is the goodness that follows repentance and asking forgiveness. Thus, each blast expresses a different part of life: the positive beginning, the struggle with life’s challenges, and the concluding corrective. At the end of all the blasts, the custom is to blow a particularly long <i>teki’a</i>, expressing the ultimate corrective, when all struggling and suffering is over. (See <i>Shlah</i>, <i>Masekhet Rosh Ha-shana</i>, <i>Torah Or</i> §55.)",
                    "Even though Rosh Ha-shana is referred to as <i>Yom Teru’a</i> because of the judgment and trembling inspired by the <i>teru’a</i>, we still blow a <i>teki’a</i> before and after the <i>teru’a</i>. This is because, like the positive <i>teki’a</i>, judgment’s goals are positive: to distance us from evil, to lead us to self-improvement, and to grant us ultimate reward (Rabbeinu Baḥya, <i>Kad Ha-kemaḥ</i>, <i>Rosh Ha-shana</i> 2; <i>Akeidat Yitzḥak</i>, <i>Sha’ar</i> 67).",

Other congregations blew shorter blasts, like someone heaving with convulsive sobs (what we now call <i>teru’a</i>). Still others blew both types of blasts, imitating a person in pain who starts by sighing and continues with sobbing (what we now call <i>shevarim</i>-<i>teru’a</i>). Even though one fulfills the obligation with any of these variations, it can seem to unlearned people that there is a dispute about this matter.",
                    "Therefore, R. Abahu instituted that in his city (Caesaria) all three types of <i>teru’ot</i> would be blown (Rosh Ha-shana 34a; R. Hai Gaon). There was another reason for his ordinance: each type of <i>teru’a</i> has a unique value, and it is proper to hear all types of <i>teru’a </i>(<i>Zohar</i> III 231b). This ordinance was then accepted by all communities; ever since, the medium-length blasts are called “<i>shevarim</i>” and the short blasts are called “<i>teru’a.</i>” The order of blowing is as follows: We begin with three sets of <i>tashrat</i> (<i>teki’a</i>, <i>shevarim-teru’a</i>, <i>teki’a</i>). We follow this with three sets of <i>tashat</i> (<i>teki’a</i>, <i>shevarim</i>, <i>teki’a</i>). We conclude with three sets of <i>tarat</i> (<i>teki’a</i>, <i>teru’a</i>, <i>tekia</i>) (SA 590:2).",

Thus, even though according to the Torah we are obligated to blow nine blasts, nowadays we are obligated to blow thirty: nine for the three sets of <i>tashat</i>, nine for the three sets of <i>tarat</i>, and twelve for the three sets of <i>tashrat</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Originally, one could fulfill his obligation with any of the <i>teru’ot</i>, as R.

However, Rambam writes, “Over the course of time and the lengthy exile, we have become uncertain as to what the sound is that the Torah calls <i>teru’a</i>…. Therefore, we do them all” (MT, Laws of Shofar 3:2). We see that because this uncertainty developed, we are required to hear all the possible types. This is also the position of Ramban (<i>Milḥamot Hashem</i>) and <i>Smag</i> (<i>Aseh</i> 42). It seems to me that Rambam and those who follow him might agree that originally, before <i>teru’a</i> was precisely defined, the obligation could be fulfilled by hearing any type of <i>teru’a</i>, as R. Hai Gaon maintains, since all the types express anguish. At some point, however, we began to relate to this as a matter of uncertainty, not just different ways of fulfilling the mitzva. Now that there is uncertainty, the Torah obligation cannot be fulfilled with only one type. Moreover, it seems to me that R. Hai and those who follow him would agree that nowadays we are rabbinically obligated to hear all three types of <i>teru’ot</i>, since R. Abahu’s ordinance has been accepted.<br>There is still room to discuss whether someone who only knows how to blow a <i>shevarim</i> should recite a <i>berakha</i> before doing so. Those who follow Rambam would certainly say no, as nowadays it is uncertain whether this fulfills the obligation. It is possible that R. Hai and his followers would agree, since the shofar-blower is not following R. Abahu’s binding ordinance. In fact, BHL 593:2, s.v. “ve’im,” states this explicitly. It is also implied by Me’iri (Rosh Ha-shana 34a), who follows R. Hai Gaon but nevertheless writes that nowadays we cannot fulfill the obligation without blowing all three types of <i>teru’a</i>. On the other hand, some say that the <i>berakha</i> should be recited in this case, as the <i>halakha</i> follows R. Hai Gaon and his followers. For further discussion, see <i>Harḥavot</i>.</i>"

This enhances both the shofar-blowing and the prayers. This is not a prerequisite for fulfilling the mitzva, though; when the shofar-blowing cannot be integrated into the prayers, prayers and shofar-blowing may be separated. Moreover, the integration of the <i>berakhot </i>and the shofar-blowing was ordained only for communal prayer; someone praying alone may not blow the shofar during the <i>Amida</i> (Rosh Ha-shana 32a, 34b; SA 592:1-2).",

Later, at a time of anti-religious persecution, shofar-blowing was outlawed by the government. Enemy soldiers would try to catch Jews blowing shofar on the morning of Rosh Ha-shana. So the Jews instituted that the shofar be blown, and the special <i>berakhot </i>recited, at <i>Musaf</i>, which can be prayed in the afternoon. Even after the ban on shofar-blowing ended, the time did not revert back, out of fear that the persecution would be renewed. Eventually the custom of blowing the shofar during <i>Musaf</i> took root (Rosh Ha-shana 32b; <i>Tosafot</i> and Ritva <i>ad loc</i>.). Some maintain that it is actually preferable to blow during <i>Musaf</i>, since the <i>Musaf </i>offering was a central mitzva of the holiday, and the <i>Musaf</i> prayer corresponds to it (one view in <i>y. Rosh Ha-shana</i> 4:8).",
                    "The Sages also instituted shofar-blowing before <i>Musaf</i> and permitted sitting for these blasts; they are therefore known as <i>teki’ot di-meyushav</i> (sitting <i>teki’ot</i>). Even though <i>le-khatḥila</i> it is preferable for both shofar-blower and listeners to stand while the mitzva is being fulfilled, the Sages permitted the listeners to sit before <i>Musaf</i> in order to show that the <i>teki’ot</i> blown later, during <i>Musaf</i> (<i>teki’ot di-me’umad</i>), are the primary ones, for which one must stand. Indeed, the custom of Sephardim and Yemenites is to sit for the <i>teki’ot </i>before <i>Musaf</i>. Nevertheless, Ashkenazim commonly stand for these <i>teki’ot</i> because they are the first shofar blasts and one fulfills his basic obligation with them (SA 585:1; MB <i>ad loc.</i> 2).",
                    "According to the Gemara (Rosh Ha-shana 16a-b), the reason the Sages instituted shofar-blowing while sitting before <i>Musaf</i> and then again while standing during <i>Musaf</i> is “to confound the accuser (<i>satan</i>).” Rashi explains that when the <i>satan</i> sees that the Jews love the <i>mitzvot</i> so much that they blow even more blasts than the Torah requires, he is silenced. Ramban explains that the shofar blasts have the special power to bind the Jews to their Father in Heaven. This confounds the <i>satan</i> during the first <i>teki’ot</i>, and thus he is unable to prosecute during the <i>Amida</i>. Others say that the prosecutor can prosecute only once. When the shofar-blowing starts before the <i>Amida</i>, he lays out his case, so he has nothing left to say during the <i>Amida</i> (Raavad). Still others say that the primary manifestation of the <i>satan </i>is as the evil inclination. This inclination is thwarted by the many shofar blasts, which inspire us to repent (Ran). Perhaps during the first set of blasts, one is so excited that he is unable to focus properly; later, after he has heard thirty blasts, he is calmer and can focus properly."

This last custom is the one that prevails today.<br>The first two customs are problematic for, as we have seen, the <i>teki’ot</i> blown during <i>Musaf </i>are primary, and due to uncertainty, we must blow three sets of each of the three types of <i>teru’a.</i> Yet, according to the first custom, each type of <i>teru’a</i> is sounded only once, and, according to the second custom, only one type of <i>teru’a</i> is blown three times. Two possible arguments in support have been suggested. Rabbeinu Ḥananel explains, based on the view of R. Hai Gaon, that even nowadays one fulfills the Torah obligation with any type of <i>teru’a</i>. Rif and Rambam explain that once all three types of <i>teru’ot</i> were blown three times each before <i>Musaf</i>, fulfilling the Torah obligation, it is not necessary to burden the congregation by requiring them to hear them all again during <i>Musaf</i> (cited in <i>Beit Yosef</i> 590:2). The custom to blow a hundred blasts is cited by <i>Arukh</i> (s.v. “erev”) in the name of the Yerushalmi, which in turn is cited by <i>Tosafot </i>(<i>Rosh Ha-shana </i>33b), Raavya, and <i>Shibolei Ha-leket</i>. Arizal bases his <i>kavanot </i>on this, and this is also the opinion of <i>Shlah</i>.</i>",

                    "Regarding the silent <i>Amida</i>, there are different customs. Some blow the shofar during the silent <i>Amida</i> as they do during the repetition. By integrating the blasts and the prayers, both are more readily accepted. This is the custom of Sephardim and Ḥasidim. For those who follow this custom, the shofar-blower sets the pace of prayer, and worshippers do their best to pray at his pace so that they hear the blasts at the proper place, at the end of a <i>berakha</i>. To that end, the shofar-blower must pray at a steady pace. Anyone who finishes a <i>berakha </i>before he does should wait for him to blow the shofar before continuing, but those who wish to pray a bit faster or slower may do so. Those who choose to do this recite the paragraph “<i>Ha-yom Harat Olam</i>” following their conclusion of each <i>berakha</i>. Then, when the shofar is blown, even if they are in the middle of a different <i>berakha</i>, they stop to listen to the blasts and then continue with their prayers.

Others say that one may fulfill other <i>mitzvot </i>that require listening by means of an electronic hearing aid, but when it comes to shofar, one should be stringent, because if one heard the echo of the shofar, he did not fulfill his obligation (Rav Kook, <i>Oraḥ Mishpat </i>§48; R. Frank writes accordingly in <i>Mikra’ei Kodesh</i>, Purim §11, with regard to hearing the <i>megilla</i>; <i>Beit Avi</i> 3:92; <i>Igrot Moshe</i> EH 3:33). However, some are lenient and consider hearing the shofar by means of a device to be the equivalent of regular hearing (Rav Orenstein, <i>Assia </i>77-78; <i>Yabi’a Omer </i>OḤ 7:18; this is also the inclination of <i>Minḥat Yitzḥak </i>3:11; see <i>Peninei Halakha: Berakhot </i>12:9).<br>In practice, since most <i>poskim</i> maintain that one does not fulfill his obligation by hearing through an electrical device, one who has such a device must remove it, for as long as it is in his ear, he cannot hear the original sound of the shofar. However, one who cannot hear the shofar without the device should leave it in, because according to some <i>poskim</i> he fulfills the mitzva in this way. He cannot be the shofar-blower, though, because according to most <i>poskim</i> he is not obligated in this mitzva.<br>The same applies to someone with cochlear implants.

                    "In many places, the rabbi or another Torah scholar quietly prompts the shofar-blower, telling him which blast to blow, to make sure that he does not get confused (Rema 585:4). The custom is to prompt even for the first blast. Although there is no concern for mistakes, some maintain that the prompt also helps focus (<i>Shlah</i>; see SHT 585:31).",

This is also why a <i>lulav</i> is not taken on the first day of Sukkot if it is on Shabbat, and why the <i>megilla</i> is not read on Purim if it is on Shabbat. See MT, Laws of Shofar 2:6.<br>In contrast, the Yerushalmi (Rosh Ha-shana 4:1) maintains that according to the Torah itself the shofar is not blown on Shabbat, i.e., that the derivation from the verses is not a mere allusion but a <i>bona fide </i>inference. The Yerushalmi then asks how they could blow the shofar in the Temple and answers (based on a close reading of the verses) that wherever people know exactly when the first of the month is and they offer the daily sacrifice, they blow the shofar even on Shabbat. Additionally, it offers a derivation from what is said regarding the Jubilee year, “Then you shall sound the horn loud; in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month – the Day of Atonement – you shall have the horn sounded throughout your land” (Vayikra 25:9). We see that it is specifically on Yom Kippur that a shofar is blown throughout the land. In contrast, if Rosh Ha-shana is on Shabbat, the shofar is blown only at the Sanhedrin. This answer also appears in <i>Sifra</i>, Behar §2.<br>It should be noted that in the Rosh Ha-shana prayers we refer to the day as <i>yom teru’a</i> when it is on a weekday, and as <i>zikhron teru’a</i> when it is on Shabbat (SA 582:7).

His rationale was that the original law permitting shofar-blowing in Jerusalem and its environs was still in effect even after the destruction. Additionally, we saw that the Sages did not wish to put an absolute end to blowing the shofar when Rosh Ha-shana was on Shabbat. Thus, he felt that in his time, when there were no ordained judges, the shofar must be blown in the <i>beit din</i> of Jerusalem. Furthermore, since the mitzva of blowing the shofar is from the Torah, and the prohibition of blowing on Shabbat is rabbinic, whenever doubt arises we should blow the shofar, thus fulfilling the Torah commandment. R. Schlesinger also took great pains to explain how to implement shofar-blowing in a way that would eliminate the risk of people carrying on Shabbat. Although several rabbis expressed limited support for his position, those who disagreed prevailed, and the shofar was not blown on Shabbat. The main reason is as we established: License to blow the shofar on Rosh Ha-shana which is on Shabbat is limited to a <i>beit din</i> of ordained judges that is the central court of the time. The fact that none of the Torah greats who have lived in Jerusalem since the destruction have blown the shofar on Shabbat supports this understanding (<i>Ir Ha-kodesh Ve-hamikdash</i> 3:20)."

In practice, every community should continue its custom. Those who are especially meticulous make efforts to listen to the shofar-blowing of all the different communities.</i>",
                    "The <i>shevarim</i> is made up of three medium-length blasts, like a sigh or groan. Each individual blast (<i>shever</i>) is about the length of three <i>tromitin</i>. <i>Le-khatḥila</i>, we do not add to the three blasts, but <i>bedi’avad</i>, one who does has fulfilled his obligation (SA 590:3; MB <i>ad loc.</i> 11). Some blow each <i>shever</i> with a rise, like a sigh in a broken voice. This is the Lithuanian custom.",
                    "If one blows a <i>shever</i> which is the length of two <i>tromitin</i>, he fulfills his obligation, for it is clear that the blast is similar to sighing rather than crying, since it is still twice as long as a <i>teru’a</i>’s <i>tromit</i>. If, however, a <i>shever</i> lasts for less than the length of two <i>tromitin</i>, he has not fulfilled his obligation. One who blows each <i>shever</i> for four <i>tromitin</i> fulfills his obligation, as this is very similar to the normal <i>shever</i>. Even one who extends a <i>shever</i> up to six <i>tromitin</i> fulfills his obligation <i>be-di’avad</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Some say that a <i>shever</i> that is 3 <i>tromitin</i> long is invalid. Why? Because a <i>shevarim</i> is a type of <i>teru’a</i>, and we know that the <i>teki’a</i> and the <i>teru’a</i> must be the same length<i>.</i> According to Rabbeinu Ḥananel and Rashi, a <i>teru’a</i> of 3 <i>tromitin</i> is acceptable. Therefore, 3 <i>tromitin</i> is the length of a <i>teki’a</i> within the set of <i>tarat</i>. True, within the set of <i>tashrat</i>, the <i>teki’a</i> is longer, to match the length of the <i>shevarim-teru’a</i>. Nevertheless, since a <i>teki’a</i> within <i>tarat</i> is 3 <i>tromitin</i>, a <i>shever</i> that is 3 <i>tromitin</i> can be confused with a <i>tekia</i> (<i>Tur</i>’s understanding of <i>Tosafot</i> and Rosh; first opinion in SA 590:3). According to Rivam, Riva, and <i>Smag</i>, a <i>teru’a</i> is 9 <i>tromitin</i> (as is a <i>teki’a</i>). Accordingly, <i>be-di’avad</i>, a <i>shever</i> can be longer or shorter than the prescribed 3 <i>tromitin</i>, as it will not be confused with a <i>teru’a</i> or <i>tekia</i> (second opinion in SA).<br>Others maintain that there is no connection between the different sets; in each set, each <i>teki’a</i> must be the same length as the adjacent <i>teru’a</i>. Thus, within the set of <i>tashrat</i>, the <i>teki’a</i> must be the length of a <i>shevarim-ter’ua</i>, while within <i>tashat</i> it must be the length of a <i>shevarim</i>. Since there is no connection between the different sets, even according to Rabbeinu Ḥananel and Rashi a <i>shever </i>that is longer than 3 <i>tromitin</i> is acceptable (<i>Mordekhai</i>; <i>Hagahot Asheri</i>; Rema). This is the common practice (MB 590:15).<br>Some maintain that we must take into account the first opinion of SA, so for at least thirty blasts we should make sure that each <i>shever</i> is less than 3 <i>tromitin</i> (MA <i>ad loc</i>. 2; see <i>Kol Teru’a</i> 8). In my humble opinion, this is not necessary. First, it is a case of a triple doubt, where we can be lenient: (a) It may be that those who maintain that a <i>teru’a</i> is 9 <i>tromitin</i> are correct; (b) even among those who believe that it is 3 <i>tromitin</i>, it is possible that <i>Mordekhai</i> and <i>Hagahot Asheri</i> are correct that there is no connection between the different sets; (c) there are other opinions as to the length of a <i>teki’a</i>: Rambam says that it is half the length of a <i>teru’a</i>, while Raavad says that a <i>teki’a</i> is always 9 <i>tromitin</i>. Second, it is very difficult to guarantee that each <i>shever</i> be less than 3 <i>tromitin</i>, as the difference between a <i>shever</i> of 2 <i>tromitin</i> and 3 is approximately a quarter of a second. It is next to impossible to discern this difference, and we have a principle that the Torah was not given to the ministering angels (who have superhuman capabilities). Third, if the shofar-blower tries to blow a <i>shever</i> of 2 <i>tromitin</i>, he may in fact end up blowing it a little shorter. That would make the <i>shever</i> into a <i>teru’a</i> sound, which all would agree does not fulfill the obligation. Therefore, it would seem that as long as the <i>shever</i> sounds like a sigh, it is acceptable <i>le-khatḥila</i>. Some say that people who follow the Lithuanian custom when blowing have removed themselves from any doubt; since the blast they blow has a rise, there is no way to confuse it with a <i>teki’a</i>. (See <i>Hilkhot Ḥag Be-ḥag</i> 12:64.)<br>How long may a <i>shever</i> be? Those who say that a <i>teru’a</i> is 9 <i>tromitin</i> say that a <i>teki’a</i> is the same length, and a <i>shever</i> must be shorter than this (SA 590:3, second opinion). However, this requires further inquiry, because if a <i>shever</i> is too long, it approximates the joyful sound of a <i>teki’a</i>. I therefore wrote that a <i>shever</i>, to be acceptable <i>be-di’avad</i>, must be no longer than 6 <i>tromitin</i>. (See <i>Mateh Ephraim ad loc</i>. 11; <i>Elef La-mateh ad loc</i>. 14.) According to Rambam’s view that a <i>teki’a</i> is half as long as a <i>teru’a</i>, after 4.5 <i>tromitin</i> a <i>shever</i> cannot be distinguished from a <i>teki’a</i>. Thus, a <i>shever</i> must be less than 4 <i>tromitin</i>. <i>Le-khatḥila</i>, one should defer to Rambam’s view.</i>"

We must say that in his opinion a <i>teru’a</i> is 9 <i>tromitin</i> and not 3, since it is inconceivable that a <i>teki’a</i> would be only 1.5 <i>tromitin</i>. Alternatively, if Rambam’s <i>teru’a</i> is that of the Yemenites, then each <i>tromit</i> is much longer than the generally accepted length of the <i>tromit</i>, which would make his position more understandable.

Each shofar-blower must calibrate his <i>teki’a</i> and <i>shevarim</i> based on the length of his <i>tromitin</i>.

But in fact, he simply writes that one should not intentionally insert a rise at the end of the <i>teki’a</i>. Indeed, some who are meticulous avoid rises in the <i>teki’a</i> (R. Ḥarlap). However, technically, such an irregularity does not disqualify the blast. (This is the position of all the <i>poskim</i>, and R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach rules this way in <i>Halikhot Shlomo</i> 2:9.) Nevertheless, it would seem that if a <i>teki’a</i> rises or goes up and down repeatedly, so much so that it mimics a <i>shevarim</i>, it is proper to redo it.<br>Yemenites traditionally incorporate a rise in tone at the end of a <i>teki’a</i>.

God said, ‘Use a ram’s horn to blow before Me so that I will be reminded of the binding of Yitzḥak, son of Avraham, and I will consider it as if you sacrificed yourselves before Me’” (Rosh Ha-shana 16a). A mature male sheep is called a ram (<i>ayil</i>), while a female is called a ewe (<i>raḥel</i>).

Later on we learn, “The Rosh Ha-shana shofar should be the straight horn of an ibex…. R. Yehuda says, ‘On Rosh Ha-shana we blow rams’ horns’” (<i>ibid. </i>26b). R. Yehuda is referring to curved rams’ horns, as horns from a ram are generally curved. R. Levi in the Gemara rules that on Rosh Ha-shana and Yom Kippur the mitzva is to use curved horns, because during those days the humbler a person is, the better. Thus, the first <i>mishna</i> teaches us that a cow’s horn is invalid because it is called a <i>keren</i> and not a shofar. In contrast, all other <i>shofarot</i> are kosher. The second <i>mishna</i> teaches us that it is preferable to use a curved shofar, but that a straight one is kosher as well. From R. Abahu’s statement in <i>Rosh Ha-shana</i> 16a we derive that the ideal shofar to use is a ram’s horn. This is the ruling of Raavad, Ramban, Rosh, Rashba, Ran, and many others. In contrast, Rambam rules that only a curved ram’s horn is kosher (MT, Laws of Shofar 1:1). According to him, R. Yehuda disagrees with the statement in the first <i>mishna</i> that all <i>shofarot</i> are kosher, believing that only a shofar from a bent ram’s horn is acceptable. This is also the opinion of R. Levi. R. Sa’adia Gaon and <i>Yere’im</i> follow this as well. However, the Aḥaronim rule in accordance with the majority of Rishonim that all <i>shofarot</i> are kosher. Therefore, one may recite a <i>berakha</i> before blowing a straight ibex horn or the like. This is also the ruling in SA 586:1.

                    "However, if someone heated it up and reshaped it so that the narrower end of the shofar became the wider end, he has invalidated the shofar. Similarly, if he turned a shofar inside out, it is invalid (SA 586:12). Such things can happen, because when a shofar is heated up it becomes very pliable; those who supply <i>shofarot</i> sometimes prefer to turn them inside out, because it is easier to smooth and beautify them that way. Therefore, a shofar must be bought from a trustworthy person, who can be believed when he says that he did not turn it inside out.

                    "A shofar must be at least a <i>tefaḥ</i> long, so that when the shofar-blower is holding it in his hand, both ends of the shofar can be seen (SA 586:9).",
                    "Even if the sound of a shofar is very high-pitched, very low-pitched, or very rough, it is acceptable, in accordance with the principle: “All shofar sounds are acceptable” (SA 586:6).",
                    "If one glued together pieces of several <i>shofarot</i> to form a new shofar, it is invalid. Even if one glued only one broken piece of a shofar onto an existing one to lengthen it, he has invalidated it, for a shofar must be a single piece as it is found naturally, with no additions. Thus, if one added to the length of a shofar with metal or plastic, it is invalid (SA 586:10-11).",
                    "However, if one sawed down a shofar and as a result its sound changed, it is kosher as long as a <i>tefaḥ</i> of the shofar remains. Similarly, if one sanded the shofar outside and inside, making it thinner and thus changing its sound, it is kosher (SA 586:13-14).",
                    "If one coated the outside of a shofar with gold or any other material, and this changed its sound, it is invalid, because the sound is not being produced exclusively by the shofar. Therefore, one should refrain from painting a shofar, lest the paint change its sound. However, it is permitted to carve designs into a shofar (SA and Rema 586:17).",
                    "If the inside of a shofar is coated with gold or any another material, the shofar is invalid, because the blasts blown do not pass through the shofar, but rather through a different material. Similarly, if the shofar’s mouthpiece is coated with gold or another material, even if they do not add to the length of the shofar, it is invalid, because the coating separates between the shofar-blower’s mouth and the shofar (SA 586:16, 18).",
                    "If a shofar was pierced but the sound did not change, it may be used even <i>le-khatḥila</i>. If the sound did change, some maintain that the shofar is invalid. <i>Le-khatḥila</i>, one should defer to this opinion. If no other shofar is available, one may rely on the position of most <i>poskim</i>, that as long as the hole does not extend over most of the shofar, it is kosher, and one can recite a <i>berakha</i> when using it. This is true even if the length of the shofar without the hole is less than a <i>tefaḥ</i>.",
                    "If one plugged the hole by gluing on a piece from a different shofar, if the sound returned to what it was, and the hole does not cover most of the shofar, it is kosher. In pressing circumstances, even if the sound is affected, the shofar may be used, and the <i>berakha</i> may even be recited before blowing it (MB <i>ad loc.</i> 35).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If a shofar has a hole which has not been plugged, even if its sound has been affected, it is still kosher according to most <i>poskim</i> (<i>Tosafot</i> based on Yerushalmi; Ramban; Rosh; Ran; Rabbeinu Yeruḥam; and others). This is also the ruling of SA (586:7). Others say that if the quality of the sound has changed, it is invalid (Ritva; <i>Kol Bo</i>). <i>Le-khatḥila</i> one should defer to their opinion (Rema). However, if the sound has not changed, it would seem that all agree that it may be used (MB <i>ad loc.</i> 28). When we speak of its sound changing, it must be a clear difference, because a minimal change is difficult to discern.<br>According to the Mishna and Gemara (Rosh Ha-shana 27a-b) as understood by Rambam and Ran, three requirements must be met in order for a shofar to remain kosher: A) The hole extends over less than half of the shofar’s surface; B) If the hole is plugged, it must be fixed with something of its type, meaning a piece from another shofar (or the two sides of the shofar may be stuck back together); C) Its sound must remain unchanged. If any one of these conditions is not met, the shofar is invalid. In contrast, according to <i>Tosafot</i> and Rosh, the shofar must meet condition A and either B or C. In other words, the area with the hole must not be more than half of the surface. Additionally, either the shofar’s hole must be plugged with something of its type (in which case it is kosher even if the sound has changed), or the sound must be unchanged (in which case it is kosher even if the hole was plugged with some other material). <i>Pri Ḥadash</i> and Vilna Gaon state that the latter position is accepted. <i>Pri Megadim</i> and MB 586:35 add that at times of necessity, the <i>berakha</i> may even be recited before blowing such a shofar. It is preferable, though, to remove the plug, because then, even if the sound has changed, more <i>poskim</i> would agree that the shofar is kosher.</i>",
                    "If a shofar has a crack lengthwise that was not glued or tied, some maintain that even if it is a very small crack, it invalidates the shofar, as blowing the shofar is liable to crack the entire shofar. However, according to most <i>poskim</i>, if the crack extends over less than half of the shofar, the shofar is kosher. If necessary, one may rely upon them and even recite a <i>berakha</i>. However, if the crack runs along most of the shofar’s length, the shofar is invalid (SA 586:8; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 43; see BHL there). If someone heated up the shofar and repaired the crack, the shofar is kosher. If the crack extends the entire length of the shofar, the shofar is absolutely invalid. There is no way to fix it, since this object no longer qualifies as a shofar (SA 586:8). If a shofar is cracked widthwise, and the crack does not extend most of the way around, the shofar is kosher even if the sound is affected. If the crack does extend most of the way around the shofar and there is less than a <i>tefaḥ</i> from the mouthpiece to the crack, the shofar is invalid (<i>ibid</i>. 9).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Additional laws: It is forbidden to blow a stolen shofar. One who transgressed and blew a stolen shofar has nevertheless fulfilled the mitzva, because the mitzva is to hear the shofar, and it was not the sound that was stolen (SA 586:2). If the shofar’s owner has given up hope of getting it back, and the thief passed the shofar on to someone else, the shofar is no longer considered stolen, and it is permissible to blow this shofar. (The thief, though, is still obligated to pay the original owner the value of the shofar.) Nevertheless, since it was stolen, some Aḥaronim write that one may not recite the <i>berakha</i> before blowing it (MB 586:9; <i>Peninei Halakha: Sukkot</i> 4:13).<br>If the owner of a shofar is not present, and there is no way to ask his permission to use his shofar, one may nevertheless use it for a hundred blasts, as there is a presumption that he would want his shofar to be used for the mitzva (MB 586:9). Afterward, the person who used it must wash and clean the shofar well. If it is known that a shofar’s owner is repulsed by others blowing his shofar, then no one may do so.<br>One may not blow a shofar that was used for idolatry. (See SA 586:3-4.)</i>"

                    "During the ten days between Rosh Ha-shana and Yom Kippur, God creates life for the upcoming year. So that His kindness does not reach the wicked, He judges all His creations during these days. Since He wishes to benefit all His creatures, and especially His people, through whom He channels <i>shefa </i>and blessing to the world, He is close, during this period, to all who sincerely call out to Him, and He extends His hand to penitents. Therefore, though repentance is always welcome, during these ten days it is more pleasing and is immediately accepted, as we read (Yeshayahu 55:6), “Seek the Lord while He can be found; call to Him while He is near” (Rosh Ha-shana 18a; MT, Laws of Repentance 2:6). During this period, individual repentance is accepted as readily as communal repentance (<i>Pesikta Rabbati</i>).",
                    "Therefore, it is proper during this period for a person to examine his actions in order to repent and correct his misdeeds from the past year (Rema OḤ 603:1). One should especially make an accounting of interpersonal matters, as Yom Kippur does not atone for interpersonal sins unless one first placates the person he offended (<i>ibid</i>. 603:4). If one has a disagreement with another about money, he should not decide for himself that he is in the right, as self-interest may blind him. Rather, he should approach a rabbi and ask for guidance. Before going to sleep each night, the pious engage in soul-searching, confess their sins, and return to God (<i>Zohar</i> III, 178a). During the Ten Days of Repentance, everyone should do so (MB 603:2).",
                    "Since it is primarily at this time that the world and humanity are judged, Jews customarily take special care to avoid anything prohibited and to increase Torah study, prayer, charity, and good deeds. Additionally, it is customary to wake up early to recite <i>Seliḥot</i> and supplications in the synagogue (MT, Laws of Repentance 3:4).",
                    "It is said in the name of Arizal that the seven days between Rosh Ha-shana and Yom Kippur contain one of each day of the week, so on each day, one should try to improve himself through repentance, Torah study, and good deeds, to rectify whatever spiritual damage he did on that day throughout the year. On Sunday he should correct his misdeeds of Sundays, on Monday of Mondays, and so on (<i>Sha’ar Ha-kavanot</i> 90:3; MB 603:2).",
                    "Some have a custom to be more meticulous about various areas of <i>halakha</i>, like <i>kashrut</i>, during this time period (SA 603:1 based on <i>y</i>. <i>Shabbat</i> 1:3). People who rely on a lenient minority opinion during the year, due to various pressures, observe the proper, <i>le-khatḥila</i> practice according to most <i>poskim </i>during this period. For example, during this period it is proper to eat only <i>glatt</i> meat and wash <i>mayim aḥaronim</i> before reciting <i>Birkat Ha-mazon</i>.",
                    "The Sages said that one should always view himself – and the world as a whole – as being halfway between guilt and innocence. Since both the world and the individual are judged in accordance with the majority of deeds, a person doing one mitzva can tip the scales toward the side of merit for himself and for the whole world. And woe unto him who does one sin; he may have tipped the scales toward the side of guilt for himself and for the whole world. We read (Kohelet 9:18), “A single sin destroys much good.” One sin can withhold so much good from the perpetrator and from the whole world (<i>Kiddushin</i> 40b)."

                    "<b>The Ten Days of Repentance / Changes to the <i>Amida</i></b>",
                    "Since when reciting the <i>Amida</i> one must see himself as standing before the King, during the Ten Days of Repentance he must make mention of God’s kingship, which is manifest during these days when He judges His world. If one does not make mention of this, it is as though he is paying mere lip-service to God’s kingship, which is revealed during the Ten Days of Repentance. Accordingly, the Sages changed the conclusion of the third <i>berakha</i> of the <i>Amida</i> from the usual “<i>ha-Kel ha-kadosh</i>” (“the holy God”) to “<i>ha-Melekh ha-kadosh</i>”<i> </i>(“the holy King”). Additionally, the <i>berakha</i> of <i>Hashiva Shofteinu</i> (“Restore our Judges”) ends with “<i>ha-Melekh ha-mishpat</i>” (“the King of justice”) instead of “<i>Melekh ohev tzedaka u-mishpat</i>” (“King Who loves righteousness and justice”).",
                    "If someone accidentally concluded the third <i>berakha</i> with “<i>ha-Kel ha-kadosh</i>,” and did not realize his mistake almost immediately (<i>tokh kedei dibur</i>, i.e., within the time it takes to say “<i>Shalom alekha rabbi</i>”), he must begin the <i>Amida</i> again, because the first three <i>berakhot</i> are considered one unit, and one who erred in any of the three must return to the beginning of the <i>Amida</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Some say that as long as one has not yet begun the next <i>berakha</i>, he may correct himself, even if it is no longer “<i>tokh kedei dibur</i>” (<i>Eshel Avraham</i> [Buczacz]; <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 582:9). However, the accepted ruling is that of SA, which states that one who did not realize the mistake almost immediately must repeat the prayer.</i> If after finishing the <i>Amida</i> one is uncertain about whether he said “<i>ha-Kel ha-kadosh</i>” or “<i>ha-Melekh ha-kadosh</i>,” he should assume that he said “<i>ha-Kel ha-kadosh</i>” out of habit and must repeat the <i>Amida</i>. However, if he remembers thinking just before reciting the <i>berakha</i> that he must say “<i>ha-Melekh ha-kadosh</i>,” or if he remembers that he inserted “<i>Mi khamokha</i>” (see below), he can assume that he recited “<i>ha-Melekh ha-kadosh</i>,” and need not repeat the <i>Amida</i> (<i>Taz</i> 422:1; MB 582:4).",
                    "If one mistakenly concluded the <i>berakha</i> of <i>Hashiva Shofteinu</i> with “<i>Melekh ohev tzedaka u-mishpat</i>” instead of “<i>ha-Melekh ha-mishpat</i>” and did not correct it almost immediately, then according to some Sephardic <i>poskim</i> he has not fulfilled his obligation. Therefore, if he has not yet finished the <i>Amida</i>, he goes back to <i>Hashiva Shofteinu</i>, concludes it correctly, and continues with the <i>Amida</i>. If he has already finished the <i>Amida</i>, he must repeat it from the beginning, but he should stipulate that if he is not actually obligated to repeat it, his prayer should be considered voluntary (SA 118:1; <i>Yeḥaveh Da’at</i> 1:57). In contrast, according to Ashkenazic and some Sephardic <i>poskim</i>, even if he mistakenly concluded “<i>Melekh ohev tzedaka u-mishpat</i>,” he has fulfilled his obligation <i>be-di’avad</i>, since the word “<i>Melekh</i>” is mentioned in this formulation as well. Therefore, even if he did not quickly correct himself, he need not repeat the <i>Amida</i> (Rema 118:1; <i>Ben Ish Ḥai</i>, Nitzavim §19; <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim ad loc</i>. 1). Since this is the majority custom, it is the appropriate ruling for one who is unsure of his family’s custom.",
                    "In addition to the above changes, there are four insertions in the <i>Amida</i> during the Ten Days of Repentance: “<i>Zokhreinu le-ḥayim</i>” in the first <i>berakha</i>, “<i>Mi khamokha</i>” in the second <i>berakha</i>, “<i>U-khetov le-ḥayim</i>” in the <i>berakha</i> of <i>Modim</i>, and “<i>Be-sefer ḥayim</i>” in the final <i>berakha</i>. One who forgot any or all of these additions need not repeat the <i>Amida</i> (SA 582:5).",

                    "Torah study is an important basis for repentance, for as a result of Torah study, one comes to observe <i>mitzvot</i>, as the Sages said: “Study is greater, for study leads to action” (<i>Kiddushin</i> 40b). The Sages further said (<i>Berakhot </i>16a) that just as a stream elevates one who immerses in it from a state of impurity to a state of purity, so too, one who enters the tent of Torah to study diligently is elevated from guilt to innocence.",

Therefore, it is proper for every person to set up a time each day to study works of <i>musar</i>,<i> </i>dedicated to self-improvement and character development (Arizal; Vilna Gaon; MB 603:2).

One who studies Torah becomes one with God’s will. Since Torah study is the most sublime of all <i>mitzvot</i>, it has a special power to atone for sins. Thus, our Sages say that even if a person has transgressed a prohibition whose punishment is death at the hands of heaven, he can save himself by increasing Torah study. If he was accustomed to study one page, he should study two; if he usually studied one chapter, he should study two. If he does not know how to study, he can help himself by becoming involved with charitable causes (<i>Vayikra Rabba</i> 25:1).",
                    "The Rishonim list regimens of fasting and mortifications in penance for specific sins. Aḥaronim explain that these fasts and mortifications are for those who do not toil in Torah study. Those who study Torah assiduously and whose fear of God is greater than their wisdom find atonement and correction through diligent Torah study (Arizal; <i>Sefer Ḥaredim</i> ch. 65; <i>Shlah</i>; BHL 571:2; <i>Noda Bi-Yehuda</i> OḤ 141:35; below 6:7).",
                    "R. Ḥayim of Volozhin also writes that Torah study atones for all sins, including very serious ones for which even sacrifices cannot atone (<i>Nefesh Ha-ḥayim</i> 4:31). The <i>midrash</i> states: “If a person committed many sins and was condemned to death [in the heavenly court]…but repented, read from the Torah, Prophets, and Writings, studied Mishna, Midrash, <i>halakhot</i> and <i>aggadot</i>, and apprenticed under the sages – even if a hundred evil decrees had been made against him, God nullifies them” (<i>Tanna De-vei Eliyahu Rabba </i>5).",
                    "This accords with what our Sages tell us about the children of Eli. As a punishment for desecrating God’s name in the <i>Mishkan</i> at Shilo, they and their descendants were condemned to die young. No offering could atone for their offense. Nevertheless, when their descendants studied Torah, they lived longer. When they also performed kind deeds, they lived even longer (Rosh Ha-shana 18a).",

During this period, it is proper for everyone to engage in soul-searching, particularly with regard to kindness and charity. People should recommit to tithing their earnings to support Torah study and the poor. Those who are well-off should extend their charity and give a fifth of their earnings."

The Mishna states, “Yom Kippur atones for sins that are between man and God; however, Yom Kippur does not atone for sins which are interpersonal, until the offender has placated his friend” (<i>Yoma</i> 85b).

Every thought of repentance increases the happiness and satisfaction in his soul…. If he has committed interpersonal sins but is not strong enough to ask forgiveness from his friend and correct them, he should not be discouraged from repenting altogether. After all, the sins relevant to his relationship with God, for which he has repented, are forgiven. The remaining sins that he has not yet corrected are only a small minority in comparison…. Nevertheless, he should continue to try very hard to avoid sinning within the interpersonal realm and make every effort to rectify what he can with wisdom and great courage… (<i>Orot Ha-teshuva </i>7:6)<br>If one makes a serious resolution to avoid future sins in the interpersonal realm and does his best to rectify what was already done…spiritual light will continue to illuminate his soul. Eventually his spiritual courage will present him with many ways to complete the practical aspect of <i>teshuva</i>, so that spiritual light, in all its grandeur and goodness, will be able to dwell in his soul, which yearns for it. (<i>Ibid</i>. 10:6)<br>Even though one must do complete <i>teshuva</i> for any sin…even more so for interpersonal ones including theft and the like…nevertheless even if he was unable to do complete <i>teshuva</i>, even in the interpersonal realm…because something prevents him, he should not let it confound his expanded consciousness and the spiritual joy of understanding the supernal light and clinging to it. He should always think that he is benefiting the whole world by increasing divine light in his soul, which is a part of all the worlds and all the souls in general, and all the Jewish souls in particular.

If the wronged party was not aware of the offense, the person requesting forgiveness must confess it to him and ask his forgiveness (<i>Baḥ</i>). However, if he knows that detailing the sin will cause the wronged party pain and embarrassment, it is better that he not specify it (MA; MB 606:3). He should also do his very best to neutralize the impact of the negative things he said.

R. Yisrael Salanter objected strongly to this ruling; because of it he refused to give his approbation to the book. His reasoning was that the wronged party might be hurt by this revelation, in which case the offender will have compounded his sin. Rather, according to R. Salanter, the person should ask forgiveness without detailing what he said, in order to avoid adding to his victim’s pain. R.

If the injured party still refuses to forgive, the original offender does not have to do anything further. The unforgiving party is now the sinner.

If he does not grant forgiveness, his sins will not be forgiven in heaven. However, if his intention is to help the offender by teaching him to be more careful in the future, our Sages allow him to make the sinner request forgiveness several times.

The idea is that whatever was supposed to befall the person should befall the chicken instead, sparing the person. (A rooster is a “<i>gever</i>” in Hebrew, the same as the word for “man.”)<i> </i>Some say that we should not perform this ceremony, as it is considered to be “<i>darkhei emori</i>,” a gentile custom based on foreign beliefs, with no Torah source. Rashba writes that when he first arrived in his city, he found that <i>kaparot</i> was widely practiced, along with other strange customs which the Jews had learned from the non-Jews. He explained to the community that this custom was disgraceful and ordered them to stop it (<i>Responsa Rashba</i> 1:395). This is also the ruling of <i>Shulḥan Arukh</i> (605:1).",

Due to his influence, many people, both Ashkenazim and Sephardim, perform <i>kaparot</i>. This is how it is done: On Erev Yom Kippur, in the early morning, a chicken is acquired for each member of the household. It is passed over their heads, and they say, “Let this be my exchange, let this be my substitute, let this be my atonement, etc.” The chicken is then slaughtered. When possible, a rooster should be acquired for each male, and a hen for each female. A pregnant woman should use a hen for herself, and both a rooster and a hen for her fetus. If white chickens are available, they should be used, to recall the verse, “Be your sins like crimson, they can turn snow-white” (Yeshayahu 1:18). While the chicken is being slaughtered, the person should have in mind that the chicken is his stand-in; everything happening to the chicken really should be happening to him. Afterward the custom is to give the meat or its monetary equivalent to the poor, so that they will have food for proper meals before and after the fast. Someone who cannot obtain chickens can fulfill the custom using geese or fish. There are only two requirements: that the animals are kosher, and that they cannot be offered as sacrifices (so that it does not look as if one is offering a sacrifice outside the Temple precincts).",

This led to concern that they might not check their knives properly or slaughter correctly. As a result, <i>poskim</i> ruled that it was preferable either to delay the slaughter until after morning services or to have it done a day or two early, since any time within the Ten Days of Repentance is an appropriate time for the ritual.",

                    "There is a mitzva to eat heartily on Erev Yom Kippur (SA 604:1), and according to most <i>poskim</i>, the mitzva is of Torah origin (MA and MB 604:1). The Sages said, “One who eats and drinks on the ninth [of Tishrei] – the Torah considers it as though he fasted on the ninth and tenth” (<i>Yoma </i>81b). Even though fasting is harder than eating, God wants to increase our reward, so He considers our eating on the ninth as if it were fasting.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Torah says, “The tenth day of this seventh month is the Day of Atonement…you shall afflict yourselves” (Vayikra 23:27). A few verses later, we read, “You shall afflict yourselves on the ninth day of the month” (<i>ibid</i>. 32). Didn’t we just read that the fast is on the tenth? Rather, the second verse teaches that there is a mitzva on the ninth to prepare for the fast by eating and drinking. We thus learn that one who eats on the ninth in preparation for the fast is considered to have fasted on the ninth, too.</i>",
                    "The reason for this mitzva is to prepare for the fast (Rashi) and to have the strength to pray properly on Yom Kippur (<i>Sha’arei Teshuva </i>4:10). Therefore, one should eat heartily especially at the <i>se’uda ha-mafseket</i>, the last meal before the fast. This mitzva also expresses God’s love for us. He commands us to fast only one day a year to atone for our sins, but out of His abundant concern for our well-being, He commands us to eat and drink before the fast so that we will have the strength to get through it unharmed (Rosh; <i>Tur</i> OḤ 604). According to another view, even though eating before the fast is helpful physiologically, it has an element of <i>inui </i>(affliction), as it is difficult to transition from the pleasure of eating to the challenge of fasting (<i>Shibolei Ha-leket</i>; AHS 604:4).",
                    "Additionally, excessive eating is indeed an <i>inui </i>from the perspective of human spirituality, as it places an emphasis on the body. This, then, is precisely the point of the mitzva – to purify and improve the body as well as the soul, for perfect service of God is with the body and soul together. On the one hand, we must be wary of the evil inclination, which draws a person toward physical desires. On the other hand, we should not conclude that holiness is revealed only when the soul is alienated from the body and the physical world. It is specifically by highlighting the sacred value of physical enjoyment on Erev Yom Kippur that we can wholly repent on Yom Kippur (<i>Shlah</i>, <i>Masekhet Yoma</i>, <i>Torah Or</i> §136).",
                    "There is another important reason for eating on the ninth. All the Torah’s commandments must be undertaken with wholehearted joy, which includes physical enjoyment. Certainly, the mitzva of repentance should be done joyfully, since through it we are purged of all our sins – sins which demean us and depress our spirits. For this reason, Yom Kippur is a Yom Tov, which deserves to be celebrated with food and drink. However, while repenting, open joy is inappropriate, as one of the main components of repentance is sorrow and regret – which is why Yom Kippur is a fast day. We are therefore commanded to give physical expression to the joy of the mitzva of repentance on Erev Yom Kippur. Thus, we can repent completely on Yom Kippur, despite the somber nature of the day (<i>Sha’arei Teshuva</i> 4:8; R. Moshe Cordovero).",
                    "This mitzva entails eating and drinking more than usual. Some say that on Erev Yom Kippur one should eat two days’ worth of food. <i>Le</i>-<i>khatḥila</i>, one should eat at least one bread-based meal; many have two such meals. (See MB 608:18; <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 604:2.) Arizal says that eating for the sake of heaven on Erev Yom Kippur allows a person to make up for any spiritual imperfection connected with his eating during the year. This eating is so important that one should study less Torah to fulfill this mitzva maximally (MA 604).",
                    "Even though there is a mitzva to eat and drink large amounts, one should eat light, easy to digest foods, rather than heavy ones. We must also be careful not to get drunk, as prayer requires sobriety (SA 608:4; MB <i>ad loc. </i>18).",
                    "The primary mitzva is to eat during the day, not the preceding night (Vilna Gaon; AHS 604:5). Still, several <i>poskim</i> write that eating at night is something of a mitzva as well (<i>Baḥ</i>; <i>Birkei Yosef</i>).",

If he does not have the strength to eat very much, he should at least be careful not to fast, as fasting on Erev Yom Kippur is prohibited, even for those trying to neutralize a bad dream (Rema 604:1). Someone who eats even a small amount of food (the volume of a <i>kotevet</i>, a large date) or drinks a small amount of liquid (a cheek-full) is no longer considered to be fasting (<i>Minḥat Ḥinukh</i> 313:15)."

Thus, if the person who made the vow did not tell at least one of the three people its specifics, they may not annul it (<i>Gittin</i> 35b; SA YD 228:14). This is why the formulation of the annulment ceremony of Erev Rosh Ha-shana is effective only for vows which one does not remember.

Without this exception, the disclaimer would annul any resolution to fast, and even if he does in fact fast, it will not have the elevated status of a fast. Yet the wording of <i>Kol Nidrei</i> does not mention this exclusion. We must say that the rabbi and congregants tacitly agree that the disclaimer in <i>Kol Nidrei</i> does not apply to fasts accepted at <i>Minḥa</i>.</i>",
                    "According to most <i>poskim</i>, the disclaimer is effective as long as the person making the vow has forgotten that he made such a declaration. However, if he makes a vow while aware of the disclaimer, his vow takes effect, for by making the vow, he implicitly annuls his disclaimer (SA YD 211:2).",
                    "In practice, one who made a vow does not rely on the disclaimer to annul it. Rather, if he does not want to fulfill the vow, he must go to three men to annul it. There are two reasons for this: First, some maintain that a disclaimer is effective only in the unusual case where the person remembers it immediately (<i>tokh kedei dibur</i>)<i> </i>following the vow and intends for the declaration to nullify the vow. However, if the person making the vow did not recall the disclaimer immediately, the vow remains valid. In practice, we take their position into account (SA YD 211:2). Second, even though most <i>poskim</i> say that the disclaimer is effective and nullifies the vow, they still require the person to have the vow annulled before three men. This is because there are cases where the vow takes effect according to the majority opinion, such as if he makes it while remembering that he had issued the disclaimer, and the Sages were concerned that the seriousness of such vows would be undermined if most vows are automatically annulled by the disclaimer (Mahari Weil; Rema YD 211:1). It should also be noted that all agree that the disclaimer is not effective in the case of a vow that one person makes to another, because such a vow is not solely under his control (SA 211:4).",
                    "The disclaimer effectively ensures that good practices that one carried out three times are not considered like vows. Without the disclaimer, unless someone explicitly stipulates that he is not making a vow (e.g., he says “<i>bli neder</i>”), doing something three times consecutively is considered a vow. Likewise, a disclaimer is effective for one who resolves to give charity or do another mitzva and does not explicitly state that it does not have the force of a vow. Without the disclaimer, since he did not say “<i>bli neder</i>,” his resolution is considered a vow (<i>Da’at Torah</i> YD 211:2).",
                    "Technically, if one issues a disclaimer out loud, it is effective even if he is alone, and his vows are thus nullified. Nevertheless, it is better to issue the disclaimer in the presence of three men. In fact, this is how we nullify vows on Erev Rosh Ha-shana (Ritva, <i>Nedarim</i> 23b; <i>Kol Nidrei</i> 81:10).",
                    "If a woman attends <i>Kol Nidrei</i> and understands the meaning of the disclaimer, her vows are annulled with its recitation. If she does not attend, it is proper for her to recite the disclaimer to herself. Thinking it is not enough; she must actually verbalize it."

                    "In His great love for the Jewish people, God took us out of Egypt, forged an eternal covenant with us, and designated and sanctified a special day each year for us, to atone for our sins. Thus, we read: “For on this day, atonement shall be made for you to purify you of all your sins; you shall purify yourselves before the Lord” (Vayikra 16:30). Purity and atonement are from God. Without them, no matter how much a person regrets past actions, he can only improve his actions in the future, but can never annul what he did in the past. Yet God, in His abundant mercy and kindness, established the Day of Atonement and the mitzva of repentance to allow us to actually erase previous sins, transgressions, and misdeeds. Thus R. Akiva proclaims:<br>Fortunate are you, Israel – for before Whom do you purify yourselves and Who purifies you? Your Father in heaven, as we read: “I will sprinkle pure water upon you, and you shall be pure” (Yeḥezkel 36:25), and “God is the hope (<i>mikveh</i>) of Israel” (Yirmiyahu 17:13). Just as a <i>mikveh</i> purifies the impure, so too, God purifies Israel. (<i>Yoma</i> 85b)",

However, on Yom Kippur the gates of heaven open, and a beam of divine light shines at the roots of Jewish souls, purifying them. The elevated souls immerse themselves in this light as if it were a <i>mikveh</i>, and they are purified from the filth of sin.",
                    "Since atonement, in its essence, is granted by God and at His will, even when Israel does not repent, Yom Kippur illuminates their inner goodness and thus cleanses the roots of their souls. However, the sins remain, so in order to neutralize their effects, suffering is necessary. This is the purpose of suffering in this world and the next. The more people regret their sins and return to God, the more effectively Yom Kippur purifies even the ramifications of sins, rendering further suffering unnecessary.",
                    "This is reflected in the central <i>berakha</i> in the Yom Kippur <i>Amida</i>:<br>And You, Lord our God, have lovingly given us this Yom Kippur for pardoning, forgiving, and atoning – to pardon all our iniquities – a sacred occasion commemorating the exodus from Egypt…. Our God and God of our forefathers: pardon our iniquities on this Yom Kippur; wipe away and remove all our transgressions and sins from before Your eyes, as it is said: “I, I am the One Who shall wipe away your transgressions for My sake, and I shall not recall your sins” (Yeshayahu 43:25). And it is said: “I have wiped away, like mist, your transgressions, and like a cloud, your sins; return to Me, for I have redeemed you” (<i>ibid</i>. 44:22). And it is said: “For on this day, atonement shall be made for you to purify you of all your sins; you shall purify yourselves before the Lord” (Vayikra 16:30). Sanctify us through Your <i>mitzvot</i> and grant that our lot be in Your Torah. Satisfy us with Your goodness, delight our souls with Your salvation, and purify our hearts to serve You in truth. For You are the Forgiver of Israel and the Pardoner of the tribes of Yeshurun in every generation, and without You we have no king who pardons and forgives but You. Blessed are You, Lord, King Who pardons and forgives our iniquities and those of all His people the house of Israel, and removes our guilt each year, King of all the earth, Who sanctifies Israel and Yom Kippur."

                    "<b>Yom Kippur / The Atonement of Yom Kippur</b>",
                    "In Biblical Hebrew, the Day of Atonement is called “<i>Yom Ha-kippurim</i>”; colloquially, we call it “Yom Kippur.” The root of “<i>kippurim</i>,” <i>K-P-R</i>, has many meanings, all of which are relevant to Yom Kippur. First, “<i>kapara</i>” can indicate covering. This was the function of the <i>kaporet</i>, the lid that covered the ark in the Temple; likewise, <i>kapara </i>covers up sins. A second meaning of “<i>kapara</i>” is an exchange or ransom (<i>kofer</i>). Sin, which originates in impure forces, is “exchanged” and returned to its place via the goat of Azazel. Third, “<i>kapara</i>” can mean cleansing or wiping clean. Atonement wipes us clean of the foulness of sin. Fourth, “<i>kapara</i>” can indicate neutralization or renouncement. As Yaakov says, “I will neutralize (<i>akhapra</i>) [Esav’s anger]” (Bereishit 32:21); Yaakov sought to counter Esav’s wrath with gifts (Rashi <i>ad loc</i>.). Fifth, “<i>kapara</i>” indicates appeasement. Neutralizing a sin can appease an injured party or heavenly accuser. (See Rashi, Mishlei 16:14.) Finally, “<i>kapara</i>” can connote fragrance, as one might understand the phrase “<i>eshkol ha-kofer</i>” (Shir Ha-shirim 1:14) to mean “a spray of fragrant blooms.” So too, repentance out of love transforms unknowing sins into merits, releasing a pleasant scent.",
                    "Commenting on the verse, “Days will be created, and one of them will be His” (Tehilim 139:16), our Sages suggest that “one of them” refers to Yom Kippur, the most unique day of the year:<br>For it is a happy time for God, Whose word brought the world into being, Who lovingly gave [Yom Kippur] to the Jewish people. This can be compared to a king of flesh and blood whose servants and household members collected the palace garbage and threw it in front of his doorway (in order to remove it from the city). When the king saw the garbage, it made him very happy. Similarly, God gave Yom Kippur to the Jews out of love and with great joy…. When He forgives the sins of Israel, He is not sad, but rather very happy. He tells the mountains and hills, the rivers and valleys: “Celebrate with Me! Let all rejoice, for I am forgiving Israel’s sins!” (<i>Tanna De-vei Eliyahu Rabba</i> 1)",
                    "Our Sages tell us that Yom Kippur’s special power is hinted at in the name of the accusing angel – <i>ha-satan</i> – whose name has the numerical value of 364. For 364 days of the year, the prosecuting angel is permitted to block the divine light from manifesting in the world and to prosecute the Jewish people. But a year has 365 days, so there is one day a year on which the <i>satan </i>may not prosecute Israel: Yom Kippur, when root of the sanctity of Israel, connected with God, is revealed (<i>Yoma</i> 20a).",
                    "Had God not established a day of atonement and forgiveness, sins would accumulate year after year. Eventually, Israel and the whole world would deserve destruction. (See <i>Sefer Ha-ḥinukh </i>§185.)",
                    "The entire day of Yom Kippur atones. Therefore, even if someone dies during Yom Kippur, his sins are forgiven (<i>Keritot</i> 7a). However, atonement is completed at the end of Yom Kippur, when the fast reaches its peak and all the prayers and meditations of Yom Kippur merge together (y. <i>Yoma</i> 4:7). This accounts for the intensity of <i>Ne’ila</i>, the closing prayer.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Keritot</i> 7a explains that each and every hour of Yom Kippur atones. Rashba, Rash Mi-Shantz, and <i>Gevurat Ari</i> all cite this. According to <i>Keritot</i> 7a and <i>Shevu’ot </i>13a, the atonement is limited to the daytime. Rashi explains that this is derived from the verse, “For on this day atonement shall be made for you” (Vayikra 16:30). Additionally, the fast is not really felt at night. In contrast, the Yerushalmi (<i>Yoma</i> 8:7) records two other opinions: R. Zeira says that from the start of Yom Kippur at night, every single minute atones, and R. Ḥananya maintains that atonement is achieved at the end of the day. Even according to R. Ḥananya, though, when the scapegoat was cast into the wilderness during Temple times, it atoned even though it was cast off before day’s end. The Yerushalmi’s conclusion is in accordance with R. Ḥananya; Ramban and Ran write this as well. Since we are speaking of spiritual matters (which do not require specific actions to be taken), we can easily apply the principle that “these and those are the words of the living God” and harmonize the different opinions by saying that there are different stages of atonement. At night, the process of atonement begins, as preparations are undertaken for it. The atonement takes place primarily during the day. With each passing hour, the atonement intensifies. It is completed at the end of the day, when the fast is at its peak. <i>Itur</i> states this explicitly, saying that the whole day atones, but the completion of the atonement is achieved during <i>Ne’ila</i>.</i>"

                    "Yom Kippur is founded upon the covenant that God forged with our forefathers Avraham, Yitzḥak, and Yaakov, sustained through the mitzva of circumcision, strengthened when God delivered Israel from Egypt, and sealed when God gave us the Torah. The continued existence of the world depends on this covenant, as the Sages say, “God made a condition with creation and said, ‘If Israel accepts the Torah, you will continue to exist; if not, I will return the world to chaos’” (<i>Shabbat</i> 88a). This is because the entire purpose of creation is for Israel to reveal God’s word, as we read, “This people I formed for Myself that they might declare My praise” (Yeshayahu 43:21). Similarly, the Sages say, “The heavens and the earth were created only in the merit of Israel” (<i>Vayikra Rabba</i> 36:4).",
                    "This covenant was revealed to the Jews on Yom Kippur, when God completely forgave the sin of the Golden Calf and renewed His covenant with Israel by giving them the second set of Tablets and commanding them to build the <i>Mishkan</i> so that His presence could dwell in their midst (<i>Pirkei De-Rabbi Eliezer</i> 46; <i>Tanḥuma</i>, Teruma §8 and Ki Tisa §31).",
                    "This covenant is not dependent upon the deeds of Israel. Rather, it is linked to the unique soul with which God endowed Israel, a soul that, at its root, longs to improve the world by revealing divine light. This is the meaning of the verse, “For you are a people consecrated to the Lord your God; of all the peoples on earth, the Lord your God chose you to be His treasured people” (Devarim 7:6). Similarly, we read, “For the Lord has chosen Yaakov for Himself, Israel, as His treasured possession” (Tehilim 135:4). Therefore, no matter how much Israel sins, the covenant will never be invalidated, as we read, “For the Lord will not forsake His people; He will not abandon His very own” (<i>ibid</i>. 94:14), and “For the sake of His great name, the Lord will never abandon His people, seeing that the Lord undertook to make you His people” (1 Shmuel 12:22).",
                    "However, if Israel sins they are punished with terrible suffering, and the more they sin the more terrible and severe the punishments are. This is in order to purify them and lead them to repent. But the Jews will never be able to abrogate the divine covenant. As we read:<br>And what you have in mind shall never come to pass – when you say, “We will be like the nations, like the families of the lands, worshiping wood and stone.” As I live – declares the Lord God – I will reign over you with a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm and overflowing fury. With a strong hand and an outstretched arm and overflowing fury I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you from the lands where you are scattered, and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples; and there I will enter into judgment with you face to face…. I will make you pass under the shepherd’s staff, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant. (Yeḥezkel 20:32-27).",
                    "In general, the world is governed by the principles of justice, for God ordained at the time of the world’s creation that the world would be governed according to people’s actions. When they choose good, goodness is increased; when they choose evil, goodness is minimized and suffering increases. Based on this, it would seem that if sin were to increase beyond a certain point, it would destroy the world. Yom Kippur precludes this; the gates of heaven are opened, supernal divine rule is revealed, the sins of Israel are forgiven at their roots, and the world endures and progresses toward its ultimate redemption. Nevertheless, the rule of justice is not abrogated. Any sin or iniquity that was not corrected through repentance is punished. If the sins are great and many, the punishments will be very hard to bear, but they will improve and refine Israel. This is explained in the Torah, <i>Nevi’im</i> (the Prophets), and the Sages: Even if Israel does not repent, the promised redemption will arrive. The choice is ours whether it will arrive speedily and joyfully or (God forbid) at the end of a long, hard road of terrible suffering.",

They are collective, asking God to forgive our sins, draw us closer to His service, and reveal His presence to us so that we can reveal His glory and guidance to the world. As a result, blessing flows in the world to the Jewish people, to each individual Jew, and to all the earth’s inhabitants."

Accordingly, there is a distinct mitzva for each and every individual to repent on Yom Kippur, as we read, “For on this day, atonement shall be made for you to purify you of all your sins; you shall purify yourselves before the Lord” (Vayikra 16:30). The repentance and atonement of each individual is an extension of the collective atonement that this verse describes (<i>Sha’arei Teshuva</i> 4:17; MT, Laws of Repentance 2:7).",
                    "On Yom Kippur, repentance is more readily accepted than it is during the rest of the year. The severity of a sin depends upon the degree of wantonness with which it was done, which indicates how distant a person is from God and Torah. On Yom Kippur, when the gates of heaven are open, the covenant between God and the Jews is revealed, and the soul’s light shines brightly, it becomes clear that fundamentally every Jew wishes to be close to God, do His will, observe His <i>mitzvot</i>, be good, and study Torah. When he stumbles and sins, it is due to the seductions of the evil inclination, the daily grind, and material needs, all of which hide the divine light. Even if someone sins knowingly, the knowledge is not absolute, as he lacks awareness of his innermost desires. The more a person connects with the sanctity of the Jewish people as a whole on Yom Kippur, the more he uncovers his innermost desires, flowing from the root of his soul. This lessens the severity of his sins, iniquities, and transgressions. Knowing sins are reclassified as unknowing, and unknowing sins as though committed under duress. Therefore, it is easier for him to regret his sins and repent, undertaking to be better.",
                    "While the primary focus of Yom Kippur and its prayers is the Jewish people as a whole, this does not detract from the individual’s repentance. On the contrary, by tapping into the sanctity of <i>klal Yisrael</i>, the individual is able to fully repent. Similarly, the individual’s repentance for his sins need not detract from his prayers for the revelation of the <i>Shekhina</i> and the well-being of <i>klal Yisrael</i>, as each individual who returns to God increases the holiness and blessing of <i>klal Yisrael</i>.",

This fast is connected to atonement for sins, as we read:<br>And this shall be to you a law for all time: In the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you shall deprive yourselves; and you shall do no manner of work, neither the citizen nor the stranger who resides among you. For on this day, atonement shall be made for you to purify you of all your sins; you shall purify yourselves before the Lord. (Vayikra 16:29-30)<br>A question arises. If the Torah wanted to establish a day for repentance and atonement, wouldn’t it have made more sense to allow us to eat and drink a little, so that we would be clear-headed and able to concentrate on prayer and repentance?",
                    "In fact, however, fasting discloses something deeper. Throughout the year, the soul is enveloped by a cloak of physicality, of various bodily desires, which make people forget their inner aspirations and sin. God commanded us to fast on Yom Kippur so that our soul can disconnect itself somewhat from the bonds of the body and materiality, thus allowing its true, noble aspirations to be free and to express themselves. Through this sublime connection to the root of our souls, our sins fall away and are cast into Azazel (<i>Derekh Hashem</i> 4:8:5).",

                    "Fasting also serves a purpose akin to that of sacrifice. During Temple times, when a person offered an animal sacrifice, its blood and fat were burnt on the altar, bringing him atonement. Likewise, when we fast on Yom Kippur, our blood and fat, which decrease with the fast, bring us atonement. We should therefore imagine that we are sacrificing ourselves on the altar. Our blood and fat decrease, ascend to God as a sweet-smelling fragrance, and atone for us. Thus, one ascends to the highest level, beyond thought and comprehension, where there is only the desire for and simple awareness of doing the will of our Father in heaven.

Additionally, on Shabbat seven people are called up to the Torah, while on Yom Kippur only six are (<i>Megilla</i> 22b). This higher level of holiness is because Shabbat unites the body and soul, revealing the holiness of both. On the other hand, in a certain sense Yom Kippur is more spiritual, as we abstain then from all physical pleasures. Not only that, but even if Yom Kippur is on Shabbat we still fast, as fasting is necessary to achieve atonement for the Jewish people.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Gemara (<i>Megilla</i> 22b-23a) states that according to R. Yishmael, six people are called up to the Torah on Yom Kippur, while seven are called up on Shabbat (since stoning, the punishment for desecrating Shabbat, is more severe than <i>karet</i>, the punishment for desecrating Yom Kippur). R. Akiva, on the other hand, maintains that six people are called up on Shabbat while seven are called up on Yom Kippur (since Yom Kippur’s restrictions are more comprehensive, including cessation of eating, and since Yom Kippur had a special <i>avoda</i>). In line with this, elsewhere R. Yishmael says it is permitted to prepare for Shabbat on Yom Kippur, since Shabbat is more important. R. Akiva disagrees (<i>Shabbat</i> 113a). In practice, the law follows R. Yishmael regarding how many people are called up (six on Yom Kippur, seven on Shabbat), and R. Akiva regarding preparation (not preparing for Shabbat on Yom Kippur).<br>The kabbalists speak of two perspectives as well. On the one hand, Yom Kippur is a manifestation of the <i>sefira</i> of <i>bina</i>, from which repentance and freedom flow. This <i>sefira</i> is close to the seven lower <i>sefirot</i>, and they draw upon it for atonement and forgiveness (<i>Sha’arei Ora</i>, <i>Sha’ar</i> 8). Shabbat is a manifestation of the higher <i>sefira</i> of <i>ḥokhma</i>, through which divine unity, whose holiness is expressed in body and soul together, is revealed in the world. On the other hand, Yom Kippur is rooted in the <i>sefira</i> of <i>keter</i>, which expresses the supernal divine will, the foundation of the covenant between God and Israel. Accordingly, Yom Kippur is the day of the soul, with the power to purify and to atone for sins, which stem from the physical. In the words of <i>Shlah</i> (citing <i>Tola’at Ya’akov</i>, <i>Sitrei Yom Ha-kippurim</i>): “Yom Kippur is the day when the supernal light is revealed [alluding to the higher <i>sefira</i> of <i>keter</i>, which shines upon and exerts influence over everyone, and becomes known through <i>bina</i>...] from which all other luminaries shine, and this is the secret of the next world…” (<i>Shlah</i>, <i>Masekhet Yoma</i>, <i>Torah Or</i> §138). Based on this, the punishment for desecrating Yom Kippur should be more severe than for desecrating Shabbat. Nevertheless, since Yom Kippur is when the supernal light is revealed and washes clean the sins of Israel, its punishment reflects mercy as well (<i>Magid Meisharim </i>cited by <i>Shlah</i>, <i>ibid</i>.).</i>"

                    "As we have seen, on Yom Kippur, the holy root of the souls of Israel are revealed, and purity and atonement spread from this spiritual root to its branches. The more a person repents, the purer he becomes, and the greater the atonement granted for his sins and transgressions. However, there are sins that cannot be completely rectified by the purity of the root of the soul and the repentance of Yom Kippur. As long as these sins are not fully rectified, the person will need to be punished for them, whether in this world or the next (1:7 above).",
                    "Therefore, someone who committed a sin for which one is liable to bring a sin offering or a guilt offering must offer the sacrifice even if he fully repents and undergoes Yom Kippur (except for an <i>asham talui</i>; see n. 4 below). Similarly, if someone commits a sin whose punishment is lashes or death (assuming that he transgresses in front of kosher witnesses after being duly warned), he would be punished by the <i>beit din </i>even if he repents fully on Yom Kippur (<i>Keritot</i> 25b-26a; MT, Laws of Sin and Guilt Offerings 3:9). Repentance is effective in repairing his soul, but the atonement or punishment prescribed by the Torah must be upheld; if they are not carried out by the <i>beit din</i>, he will be punished, either in this world or the next. Nowadays, when we can neither offer sacrifices nor mete out punishments in a<i> beit din</i>, the way to rectify sins is to give charity and study Torah in amounts corresponding to the weightiness of the sins committed. In the past, many people also fasted for many days, commensurate with their sins, but nowadays the accepted ruling is to give charity and study Torah instead.",
                    "The Mishna states, “Yom Kippur atones for sins that are between man and God; however, Yom Kippur does not atone for interpersonal sins until the offender has placated his friend” (<i>Yoma</i> 85b). This is derived from the verse, “For on this day, atonement shall be made for you to purify you of all your sins; you shall purify yourselves before the Lord” (Vayikra 16:30), which can alternatively be translated, “For on this day atonement shall be made for you to purify you of all your sins before the Lord; purify yourselves.” In other words, it is specifically sins “before the Lord” that are forgiven. Thus, when a sin is against the divine glory, complete repentance before God rectifies it entirely. But when a person is the victim of a sin, if the person has not been placated, the sin remains. Repentance on Yom Kippur helps only to mitigate its severity, transforming the sin from knowing to unknowing and from unknowing to the product of duress. This purifies the root of the soul, but the damage to the branches of the soul remains as long as one has not placated his friend.",
                    "The same <i>mishna</i> states, “One who declares, ‘I will sin and then repent; I will sin and then repent’ is not given the opportunity to repent. ‘I will sin and Yom Kippur will atone’ – Yom Kippur will not atone” (<i>Yoma</i> 85b). The reason is clear: Repentance is meant to help a person repair what he has damaged. When a person sins because he is relying upon repenting afterward, the idea of repentance actually leads to his feeling free to sin. Therefore, “he is not given the opportunity to repent,” meaning, it will be difficult for him to motivate himself to correct his deeds. Nevertheless, if despite the difficulty, he makes every effort to repent, his repentance will be accepted.",
                    "Similarly, when a person sins because he is relying upon Yom Kippur to atone for him, he demonstrates that he does not understand the profound holiness of the day. Yom Kippur is meant to reveal the good root of his soul. Thinking about it is supposed to prevent a person from sinning. But this person has it backward – thinking of Yom Kippur leads him to sin more. Therefore, it doesn’t matter how much he prays and cries; since he subverts the essential sanctity of the day, Yom Kippur does not atone for him. Only if he makes every effort to repent, understands the magnitude of his mistake, and resolves not to sin again, will his repentance be accepted."

As a result, the world continues to exist and advances toward redemption. However, the Gemara records a dispute as to how this relates to the atonement of the individual. R. Yehuda Ha-Nasi maintains that an individual is forgiven without repentance, while the other Sages maintain that repentance is a prerequisite for Yom Kippur’s atonement (<i>Yoma</i> 85b).",
                    "According to R. Yehuda Ha-Nasi, the fundamental atonement of Yom Kippur extends to each and every Jew, even if he neither repents nor observes the day. Since he has undergone the day, he is absolved from punishments such as <i>karet</i> or death at the hands of heaven. (See <i>Keritot</i> 7a.) This is because the atonement is the result of divine fiat, rooted in the eternal connection between God and His people Israel. Therefore, even if someone declares that he does not want Yom Kippur to atone for him, he is forgiven against his will. For a person cannot say to his king, “I do not want you to rule over me” (<i>y. Shevu’ot</i> 1:6). God has decided to forgive the sins of the Jews on Yom Kippur, and so it is.",
                    "However, it is clear that even according to R. Yehuda Ha-Nasi, when a person sins, he damages his soul. This prevents him from drawing close to God and taking pleasure in the glory of the <i>Shekhina</i> in this world and the next. The extent of the distance depends on the extent of the damage. In the absence of repentance or suffering, this damage is not erased even after he undergoes Yom Kippur.",
                    "It is important to be aware that there are three types of suffering in this world: The first type of suffering is meant to purify a person and purge him of his sins. The second type of suffering is meant as a wake-up call, encouraging a person to repent and directing him toward the right path. Fundamentally, these types of suffering are motivated by love. R. Yehuda Ha-Nasi and the other Sages do not disagree about them. R. Yehuda Ha-Nasi agrees that these types of suffering will not be obviated by Yom Kippur, since their purpose is to help people. The more a person purifies himself by repenting on Yom Kippur, the more able he is to avoid these, as they are rendered unnecessary.",
                    "The third type of suffering is meant to punish and stems from divine justice. God created good and evil. He created forces of good, empowering them to reward those who perform <i>mitzvot</i>, and He created forces of evil, empowering them to punish sinners. There are many detailed rules pertaining to the punishments, all in accordance with the severity of the sin. It is true that these punishments also purify a person and may even direct him toward the proper path. However, their primary purpose is to carry out justice, punishing sinners who damage the world and the honor of heaven. Even though sometimes a delay in punishment would allow a person time to repent and correct his failings, that is irrelevant if the rules of justice demand that he be punished. What is good for him is no longer part of the equation. Rather, he is punished in accordance with strict justice.",
                    "According to R. Yehuda Ha-Nasi, this type of suffering is obviated on Yom Kippur even without repentance. If a person is deserving of heavenly<i> </i>punishment, undergoing Yom Kippur erases it. He can turn over a new leaf, and he is not held accountable for his earlier sins. He is subject only to those punishments that will be most helpful for his correction and purification – about which there is no disagreement between R. Yehuda Ha-Nasi and the other Sages.",
                    "Additionally, R. Yehuda Ha-Nasi agrees that if someone denies one of the three fundamentals of faith, Yom Kippur does not atone for him and does not save him from the third type of suffering, as we read, “Because he has spurned the word of the Lord and violated His commandment, that person shall be cut off – he bears his guilt” (Bamidbar 15:31). Those deemed to be denying fundamentals of faith are: A) One who casts off the yoke of heaven, meaning he denies the God of Israel; B) one who misrepresents the Torah, meaning he dares to falsify and degrade it; C) one who violates the covenant of circumcision, meaning he does not circumcise his son or tries to hide the fact that he himself is circumcised. In other words, Yom Kippur does not atone for someone who denies God, misrepresents the Torah, or denies his Jewish identity (<i>Yoma</i> 85b; <i>Shevu’ot</i> 13a).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This explanation of R. Yehuda Ha-Nasi’s position is based primarily upon the discourses of my master and teacher R. Zvi Yehuda Kook <i>zt”l</i> and the works of R. Tzadok Ha-Kohen in his writings (for example, <i>Resisei Laila</i> 54:22). We should add that even R. Yehuda Ha-Nasi agrees that Yom Kippur does not atone for someone who says, “I will sin and Yom Kippur will atone,” as explained in <i>Yoma</i> 87a. It also does not atone for interpersonal sins (<i>Be’er Sheva</i>; <i>Minḥat Ḥinukh</i>; R. Yosef Engel).<br>The first two types of suffering, which come to atone, purify, and inspire repentance, are addressed in <i>Sha’arei Teshuva</i> 2:3-5 and <i>Derekh Hashem</i> 2:3, 5. It seems clear that R. Yehuda Ha-Nasi would agree that Yom Kippur does not eliminate these two types of suffering, since they are meant to help people. Along these lines, <i>Tosafot Yeshanim</i> state that R. Yehuda Ha-Nasi would agree that Yom Kippur does not bring about complete atonement if it is not accompanied by repentance (<i>Yoma</i> 85b, s.v. “teshuva”). R. David Pardo says something similar as well (<i>Ḥasdei David</i>, <i>Tosefta Yoma</i> 4:8). He explains that according to R. Yehuda Ha-Nasi, the atonement of Yom Kippur obviates punishment in this world, but not in the next, as punishment in the next world is necessary for purification.<br>The third type of suffering is the work of the accusing angel (<i>satan</i>)<i> </i>and his forces of evil, which God created in order to eliminate evil from the world. In the heavenly court, they testify to people’s evil deeds and demand that they be punished. Thus, <i>Zohar</i> explains that the prosecutor has the power to block the <i>shefa</i> at the beginning of the year and to demand justice. God provided the Jews with a strategy to combat this – blowing the shofar (<i>Zohar</i>, <i>Ra’aya Mehemna</i> III 98b). Mabit in <i>Beit Elokim</i> (<i>Sha’ar Ha-teshuva</i> 9) writes something similar, as does R. Ḥayim of Volozhin in <i>Nefesh Ha-ḥayim</i> 1:12.<br>On the collective level, it would also seem that everything that happens to the holy Jewish people always serves to purify them and improve the world. This is true even when the Jews are being tormented and it seems that God has deserted them. This is true even when the suffering seems like vengeance being exacted by a very unforgiving justice that does not distinguish between the righteous and the wicked. All of it is rooted in mercy and compassion; its goal is to purify and improve. This idea can explain the root of the suffering of an individual Jew as well.</i>"

Even if it is possible that a delay in the punishment would allow a person time to repent and correct his deeds, if he fails to repent on Yom Kippur, he will feel the full force of the law. However, even these Sages agree that a person does not have to achieve perfect repentance for Yom Kippur to atone. The fact that on Yom Kippur he refrained from <i>melakha</i>, fasted, prayed, and showed his inner wish to be good and not sin, is enough to protect him from the punishment due to him according to the letter of the law (3:5 above, based on <i>Shlah</i>, <i>Masekhet Rosh Ha-shana</i>, <i>Torah Or</i> §17).",

Initially, we might ask: Why is it necessary to rule here at all? Do we not say, “These and those are the words of the living God”? Only when there are practical ramifications is it necessary to hand down a ruling. Nevertheless, this ruling is of critical importance. A person should not rely upon Yom Kippur alone to atone for him, but rather must repent. (Although Rambam rules in accordance with the Sages, he adds that the scapegoat atones for minor sins even without repentance.)<br>Everyone agrees on the following. If someone was obligated to offer an <i>asham talui</i> (as he was uncertain about whether he had committed a sin requiring a sin offering), Yom Kippur wiped out this obligation. Even if he did not repent, and even if he desecrated Yom Kippur by working and eating then, simply undergoing the day exempted him from bringing the offering (<i>Keritot</i> 25b; MT, Laws of Sin and Guilt Offerings 3:9).</i>"

For example, complete repentance on its own can fully atone for failure to fulfill a positive mitzva. However, for serious transgressions that involve desecration of God’s name, atonement requires a combination of repentance, Yom Kippur, suffering, and death.",
                    "Regular repentance is motivated by fear – fear of being punished or fear of losing one’s reward, in this world or the next. This type of repentance transforms knowing sins into unknowing ones. However, in order to erase the impression left by unknowing sins, atonement must include regret, sorrow, and suffering in accordance with the severity of the sin. In the times of the Rishonim, many people would undertake fasts and ascetic practices to ensure complete atonement. The more a person studies Torah diligently, gives charity, and performs acts of kindness, the fewer tribulations he must undergo to cleanse himself of sin (<i>Sha’arei Teshuva</i> 4:11). One who desecrated God’s name must make a point of sanctifying it and bringing greater glory to God (<i>Sha’arei Teshuva</i> 1:47 and 4:16).",
                    "A higher level of repentance is motivated by love. It is done out of love for God, identification with divine ideals, and concern for the Jewish people. This repentance is accomplished by studying Torah in order to repair the world by its light; giving charity and acting kindly in order to enable the poor to be self-reliant; settling Eretz Yisrael; sanctifying God’s name; and doing everything possible to draw the <i>Shekhina</i> and redemption closer. When one repents from love, even his unknowing sins become merits, so his atonement is complete. As a rule, though, even someone who repents from love does not attain its highest level, so he must still repent out of fear, which involves some mortification. It is better for one to accept upon himself that these mortifications will come through toiling in Torah and making do with little, in order to give more charity.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tosefta Yoma </i>4:6-8 (and <i>Yoma </i>86a) states:<br>R. Yishmael says: There are four grades of atonement. If one fails to perform a positive mitzva and later repents, he is forgiven on the spot, as we read, “Turn back, O rebellious children, I will heal your afflictions!” (Yirmiyahu 3:22). If one transgresses a negative mitzva and later repents, repentance holds his punishment in abeyance, and Yom Kippur atones, as we read, “For on this day, atonement shall be made for you…” (Vayikra 16:30). If one committed sins that incur <i>karet </i>and the death penalty and repented, repentance and Yom Kippur hold the punishment in abeyance, and suffering during the rest of the year cleanses, as we read, “I will punish their transgression with the rod, their iniquity with plagues” (Tehilim 89:33). If, however, one knowingly desecrates the name of God, repentance does not hold the punishment in abeyance, nor does Yom Kippur atone. Rather, repentance and Yom Kippur atone for a third, suffering atones for a third, and death cleanses (together with the suffering). This is the meaning of “This iniquity shall never be forgiven you until you die” (Yeshayahu 22:14). We see that the day of death cleanses.<br>There are many disagreements about the details of these levels of atonement. The Rishonim debate whether atonement for transgressing a positive or negative mitzva is complete or not (<i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Shevu’ot</i> 12b, s.v. “lo”; <i>Roke’aḥ</i>, <i>Hilkhot Teshuva</i> §28; <i>Sha’arei Teshuva</i> 4:6). They also disagree about the Sages’ statement that the transgression of a negative mitzva is not atoned for by repentance alone, but requires Yom Kippur as well. According to Rambam (in his <i>Commentary to the Mishna</i>), this refers specifically to knowing transgressions, but according to <i>Minḥat Ḥinukh</i>, it applies to unknowing transgressions as well. There are other <i>mitzvot </i>whose level is debated by the Rishonim, for example, the punishment for transgressing a positive mitzva that entails <i>karet</i>. (See MT, Laws of Repentance 1:4; <i>Tosefet Yom Ha-Kippurim</i> 85b.) According to a student of Rashba, these distinctions are not absolute, as some positive and negative <i>mitzvot </i>are severe – publicly embarrassing someone, for example – and atonement for them is as difficult to achieve as for a transgression whose punishment is <i>karet</i>. Other severe sins, such as abrogating the covenant of circumcision or misrepresenting the Torah, do not involve the public desecration of God’s name, yet are as severe as sins that involve the desecration of God’s name (<i>Ḥidushei Talmid Ha-Rashba</i>, <i>Inyanim Shonim</i> §2). Rosh adds that numerous mild transgressions have the status of a severe transgression (Rosh, <i>Yoma</i> 8:17). Me’iri suggests that in certain circumstances it is possible to achieve atonement without going through all of the stages delineated above (Me’iri, <i>Yoma</i> 86a). Mabit writes that since the destruction of the Temple, transgressions are considered less severe than they were. Since the Divine Presence is in exile, less damage is done to the honor of heaven when someone sins (<i>Beit Elokim</i>, <i>Sha’ar Ha-teshuva</i>, end of ch. 2).<br>It is important to know that repentance, at the most basic level, takes place in the mind. The Sages therefore ruled that if a man betroths a woman “on condition that I am righteous,” they are considered betrothed even if he is wicked, as he may have entertained thoughts of repentance (<i>Kiddushin</i> 49b). This means it is uncertain whether they are betrothed, as we do not know whether he considered repentance (MT, Laws of Marriage<i> </i>8:5).<br>All of the above ways of achieving atonement (repentance, Yom Kippur, suffering, and death) are relevant to repentance from fear; but when repentance is motivated by love, atonement is achieved more easily. This is mentioned by R. Elazar Azikri (<i>Sefer Ḥaredim</i>, ch. 65); Ḥida in many places; and our master Rav Kook (<i>Olat Re’iya</i>, vol. 2, p. 357). Rav Kook adds that repentance emerging from “eternal love” transforms unknowing sins into merits, but the sin still leaves an impression; in contrast, repentance which arises out of “great love” uproots the sin retroactively (<i>Me’orot Ha-Re’iya</i>, <i>Yeraḥ Ha-eitanim</i>, p. 73). It is further said that increasing one’s Torah study as well as giving charity and performing kind acts can be very helpful in achieving atonement for sins (Rosh Ha-shana 18a; <i>Vayikra Rabba</i> 25:1; <i>Sha’arei Teshuva</i> 4:11). Similarly, studying the offerings takes the place of sacrificing them (<i>Menaḥot</i> 110a).<br>Many Torah giants in recent times have encouraged repentance out of love. Accordingly, I did not go into details about all the gradations of atonement when repenting out of fear. Not only are there many such details, but they depend on a variety of factors, including the severity of the sin, the degree of wantonness, the intensity of the regret, the degree of suffering, and the state of the generation. Even though each of these factors is very important, they are not connected with the atonement of Yom Kippur, which is primarily about communal atonement. As a collective, we pray for the world to experience God’s glory and for its repair at the hands of Israel. This extends to the repentance of the individual, who accepts the yoke of Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> generally and repents from, and experiences regret over, his personal sins.</i>"

In the natural course of events, sometimes people are forced to sell their land, whether due to laziness, lust, or other troubles. Sometimes they are even forced to sell themselves into slavery. The Torah teaches people to be industrious and not allow themselves to give in to their desires and become enslaved to debt. Nevertheless, some people are overcome by their urges. They mortgage their future for a fleeting present, and ultimately, they sell their fields and enslave themselves. God has pity on them and even more so on their families, so He gave us the mitzva of the Jubilee, the fiftieth year, when all Jewish slaves go free and all fields return to their original owners. We read:<br>You shall count off seven weeks of years – seven times seven years – so that the period of seven weeks of years gives you a total of forty-nine years. Then you shall blast the shofar loud; in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month – the Day of Atonement – you shall sound the shofar throughout your land, and you shall hallow the fiftieth year. You shall proclaim freedom throughout the land for all its inhabitants. It shall be a Jubilee for you: each of you shall return to his holding and each of you shall return to his family…. In this year of Jubilee, you shall return, each to his estate. (Vayikra 25:8-13)",

Rather, slaves ate and drank and rejoiced while wearing crowns (of freedom). Once Yom Kippur arrived and the <i>beit din</i> blew the shofar, slaves were sent home and fields were returned to their owners. (MT, Laws of <i>Shemita</i> and <i>Yovel</i> 10:14)",

The return of the body to the soul is like the return of a field to its owner. When a person gives in to his urges, the body disconnects from the soul, enslaves itself to foreign desires, and squanders its strength on alien transgressions. But through the repentance of Yom Kippur, the body is restored to the soul, and they can rejoice together in the joy of a mitzva as they reveal God’s word in the world.

R. Akiva said, “No other day was as precious as the day the Jews were given Shir Ha-shirim. For all of the Writings are holy, but Shir Ha-shirim is the holy of holies” (<i>Tanḥuma</i> Tetzaveh §5). Similarly, the <i>keruvim</i> (cherubim) on the top of the ark in the <i>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</i> were in the form of a male and female being intimate. This was to teach that holiness does not constrict life but intensifies it. When the Jews stopped doing what God wanted, the <i>keruvim</i> turned their backs on each other and faced outward (<i>Bava Batra</i> 99a).",
                    "These ideas lie at the root of the custom of young Jewish men and women seeking their match on Yom Kippur. They drew upon the unity of God and the Jewish people to find their own union and love, to create holy Jewish homes. Accordingly, married couples must repent on Yom Kippur for any failure to love and pleasure each other properly. True, on the physical level, a couple must separate on Yom Kippur, as they do when the wife is a <i>nidda</i> (9:7 below). Nevertheless, on the spiritual level, their connection is stronger than usual, due to the holiness of the day. This concept is reflected in the laws pertaining to the Kohen Gadol serving in the Temple on Yom Kippur. On the one hand, he was required to separate from his wife for a week before Yom Kippur. On the other hand, an unmarried <i>kohen</i> was not allowed to serve on Yom Kippur at all (10:4 below).",
                    "The young women would wait to dance in the vineyards until after the scapegoat was cast away. Since the sins of Israel were forgiven then, it was an especially joyous time. This custom was appropriate at a time when the <i>Shekhina</i> dwelled with the people, and the Temple linked heaven and earth. But since the destruction of the Temple, heaven and earth are not as close together. If people today engaged in matchmaking on Yom Kippur, they would miss out on the primary expression of the day’s holiness.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As we cited above, the Mishna states, “There were no happier days for the Jews than the fifteenth of Av and Yom Kippur. On those days, the young women of Jerusalem would go out…” (<i>Ta’anit</i> 26b). This clearly indicates that the custom was practiced on both Yom Kippur and the fifteenth of Av. We find statements to this effect in <i>y. Ketuvot</i> 2:1, Ritva (<i>Bava Batra</i> 121a), and Maharshal (<i>Yam Shel Shlomo</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 1:18) as well. Indeed, this is the understanding of many commentators and <i>poskim</i>. However, many other works cite R. Hai Gaon and R. Sherira Gaon as maintaining that while the young women danced in the vineyards on the fifteenth of Av, they did not do so on Yom Kippur. <i>Tiferet Yisrael</i> on <i>Ta’anit</i> 4:8 is one such commentary.<br>Perhaps we can reconcile the positions by saying that while the young women did not dance in the vineyards on Yom Kippur, people did engage in matchmaking then. Alternatively, <i>Birkei Yosef</i> suggests that the women danced in the fields at night right after Yom Kippur. R. Shlomo Goren presents a different approach: In the days of the First Temple, the presence of the <i>Shekhina</i> was palpable, and the red thread tied to the horns of the scapegoat, which indicated whether <i>klal Yisrael </i>achieved atonement, would always turn white (<i>Yoma</i> 39a). The Sages had not yet formulated the prayers, so the Kohen Gadol’s <i>avoda</i> and <i>vidui</i> atoned for everyone. Thus, the mood on Yom Kippur was one of joy, and the young women would dance in the vineyards then. In contrast, in the time of the Second Temple, the <i>Shekhina</i> was not perceptible, the red thread did not always turn white, and the Sages had formulated the prayer service. Thus, the mood on Yom Kippur was one of awe, emphasizing judgment, and matchmaking was not undertaken then (<i>Mo’adei Yisrael</i>, pp. 65-66). R. Ḥayim David Halevy says something similar, but the distinction he draws is between Temple times and post-Temple times.<br>The same <i>mishna</i> states that the phrase “His wedding day” (Shir Ha-shirim 3:11) refers to the giving of the Torah. Rashi explains that “this refers to Yom Kippur, when the second Tablets were given.” R. Tzadok Ha-Kohen of Lublin elaborates: “On Shavu’ot, the [first] Tablets were given through divine initiative, and they were shattered; on Yom Kippur, the second Tablets were given through human initiative, and those tablets endured” (<i>Pri Tzadik</i>, Tu Be-Av §2). The central feature of this “wedding day” of Yom Kippur is that the second Tablets left space for the Sages of the Oral Torah to come up with novel interpretations and enact regulations.</i>",
                    "Nevertheless, it is still proper on Yom Kippur for all singles to pray for a good match, as the very holiness of the day can help in their quest. Often, negative character traits such as arrogance and lust prevent people from finding their true match. On Yom Kippur, when the pure soul is revealed, a person can see his life goals more clearly. He can better determine what type of person would suit him best, and with whom he would be able to build a home of Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>, so that together they will add life and joy to the world."

It shall be a sacred occasion for you” (Vayikra 23:27). With regard to Shabbat and festivals, this means enjoying and honoring them, as our Sages say (<i>Sifra</i>, Emor 12:4), “How does one sanctify a festival? With food, drink, and clean clothes” (codified in MT, Laws of Yom Tov 6:16; SA OḤ 529:1). However, we cannot say the same for Yom Kippur, when we must fast. Thus, our Sages (<i>Shabbat </i>119a) expound the verse “The Lord’s holy day (should be) honored” (Yeshayahu 58:13) as referring to Yom Kippur. “There is no eating and no drinking on it, so the Torah says: Honor it with clean clothes” (Rif; Rosh on <i>Yoma</i> 8:9).",

On Yom Kippur we are not seduced by temptations of the flesh; we are sin-free, like the angels. Women, even those who do not wear white, avoid wearing jewelry and fancy clothes on Yom Kippur, due to the dread of impending judgment (<i>Mordekhai</i>; Rema 610:4; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 16-17). Many Ashkenazic men wear a white cloak called a <i>kittel</i>, which, in addition to being angelic, is also similar to a burial shroud. The <i>kittel </i>reminds us of death, leaving us contrite and humble, and inspiring us to repent. A <i>kittel</i> must be removed before using the bathroom, unless one is only urinating (<i>Mateh Ephraim ad loc</i>. 12; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 18).",

There is also a mitzva to take a shower in honor of Yom Kippur, just as one does for Shabbat. Some immerse in a <i>mikveh</i> as well (5:10 above).",

In contrast, on Yom Kippur some make a point of smelling aromatic spices and reciting the <i>berakha</i> over them.

If one works on Yom Kippur, not only is he not fulfilling the positive mitzva to desist from <i>melakha</i>, but he is also violating the negative mitzva, “You shall do no <i>melakha</i> throughout that day” (<i>ibid</i>. 23:28). Since Yom Kippur is referred to as Shabbat, the thirty-nine categories of <i>melakha</i> prohibited on Shabbat are also prohibited on Yom Kippur. It is only regarding punishment that there is a difference between Yom Kippur and Shabbat. While someone who knowingly undertakes <i>melakha</i> (in the presence of witnesses after being duly warned) is subject to stoning on Shabbat, he is subject to <i>karet</i> on Yom Kippur. (One who unknowingly does <i>melakha</i> on either day must offer a sin offering.) Thus we read (<i>ibid</i>. v. 30), “And whoever does any <i>melakha</i> throughout that day, I will cause that person to perish from among his people” (MT, Laws of Resting on the Tenth 1:1-2; SA 611:2).",

That is, in addition to refraining from <i>melakha</i>, one is meant to refrain from doing burdensome activities. One must not open a store or move heavy items in preparation for weekday activities. Even though one who does so is not engaging in one of the thirty-nine <i>melakhot</i>, he is negating the mitzva to rest on Yom Kippur, as it is written, “It shall be a Shabbat of complete rest for you” (Vayikra 23:32). The mitzva is to preserve the sanctity and character of the day. One’s entire demeanor is meant to be different than on a weekday (<i>Peninei Halakha: Shabbat</i> 22:1). In general, all laws of Shabbat apply to Yom Kippur, and there is the additional mitzva of fasting on Yom Kippur, so it involves a more complete withdrawal from mundane affairs."

Therefore, a mitzva is incumbent upon every individual to repent and to confess his sins on this day (MT, Laws of Repentance 2:7).",
                    "The process of repentance is completed when a person explicitly verbalizes a confession. As is the case with our mission in this world in general, here too, we must actualize the good intentions present in our thoughts and hearts. Explicit, verbal confession clarifies and crystalizes the thoughts and emotions accompanying repentance. Regret is deeply and keenly felt, and the penitent’s resolution to refrain from sin is reinforced. This is why the Torah commands those bringing an offering to confess their sins, as we read, “Speak to the children of Israel: When a man or woman commits any wrong toward a fellow man, thus breaking faith with the Lord, and that person realizes his guilt, he shall confess the wrong that he has done” (Bamidbar 5:6-7). Similarly, we read, “When he realizes his guilt in any of these matters, he shall confess that wherein he has sinned” (Vayikra 5:5). Just as someone offering a sin offering must confess, so too, any penitent must confess. This is the final step of his repentance (MT, Laws of Repentance 1:1).",
                    "Confession should also be practiced all year round. If one sinned unknowingly, he should say “I have sinned” (<i>ḥatati</i>); if he sinned knowingly, he should say “I have done wrong” (<i>aviti</i>); and if he sinned spitefully, he should say “I have rebelled” (<i>pashati</i>). By doing so, he has fulfilled the mitzva of confession, even though he has not detailed specific sins. In general, it is preferable to specify sins, although there are some situations where it is preferable not to do so (SA 607:2; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 5; SHT <i>ad loc</i>. 11; see sections 4-6 below for details).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Many authorities consider <i>vidui</i> to be the primary element of repentance, for it completes the process of repentance (<i>Sha’arei Teshuva</i> 1:40; Ramban; <i>Smak</i>; <i>Sefer Ḥaredim</i>). Ramban explains that repentance must be expressed in thought, speech, and action. “Thought” refers to regret for past misdeeds. “Speech” refers to <i>vidui</i>. “Action,” in Temple times, referred to leaning on a sacrificial animal before offering it (Ramban on Vayikra 1:9; <i>Sefer Ha-ikarim</i> 4:26). Nowadays, when there are no sacrifices, the verbal confession, which involves moving the lips, is considered to be action as well as speech (<i>Yad Ketana</i>).

Many understand Rambam to be saying that repentance is not a positive mitzva <i>per se</i>, as the necessity for it goes without saying; rather, the mitzva is <i>vidui</i> which is part of the process of repentance (<i>Pri Ḥadash</i>; <i>Minḥat Ḥinukh</i>; <i>Mishpat Kohen</i> §128).

According to the <i>maḥzor</i>, this was the formula of the <i>vidui</i>:<br>Please, Lord, Your people, the house of Israel, have sinned, have done wrong, have rebelled before You. Please, by Your name, grant atonement for the sins and for the wrongs and the rebellions that they have sinned, and done wrong, and rebelled before You – Your people, the house of Israel. As it is written in the Torah of Moses Your servant, at the word of Your glory, ‘For on this day, you will be atoned for and made pure of all your sins before the Lord.’”<br>“Sins” are unknowing, “wrongs” are knowing, and “rebellions” are spiteful. This order is logical, as it is reasonable to ask for forgiveness beginning with the less serious offenses (<i>Yoma</i> 36b; SA 621:5).",
                    "With this <i>vidui</i>, the Kohen Gadol fulfilled the mitzva of <i>vidui</i> on behalf of all Israel, even though presumably it was still valuable for each individual to confess his personal sins. An advantage of the Kohen Gadol’s <i>vidui</i> was that it allowed the entire nation to participate in repentance. This made the repentance deeper and more comprehensive. For this reason, after the Temple was destroyed, the Sages ordained that every Jew confess in the plural. During this recitation, each individual should keep in mind his personal sins as well (<i>Yere’im</i>; R. Sa’adia Gaon).",
                    "The minimum mandated <i>vidui</i> on Yom Kippur is: “But we have sinned, wronged, and rebelled” (<i>Yoma</i> 87b; MT, Laws of Repentance 2:8; <i>Pri Ḥadash</i>; MB 607:12). Common practice is to add a more extensive list of sins in alphabetical order (R. Amram Gaon):<br>We have sinned (<i>ashamnu</i>), we have acted treacherously (<i>bagadnu</i>), we have robbed, we have spoken slander. We have acted perversely, we have acted wickedly, we have acted presumptuously, we have been violent, we have framed lies. We have given bad advice, we have deceived, we have scorned, we have rebelled, we have provoked, we have turned away, we have committed iniquity, we have transgressed, we have persecuted, we have been obstinate. We have done wrong, we have corrupted, we have acted abominably, we have strayed, we have led others astray. We continue with another list of sins, each of which is introduced by the phrase “For the sin we have sinned before You” (<i>al ḥet she-ḥatanu lefanekha</i>). Taking these as a starting point, each ethnic/geographical community has its own version.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Some maintain that one does not fulfill the obligation of <i>vidui</i> simply by reciting “I have sinned, I have wronged, I have rebelled.” Rather, one must specify the sins, and so one must recite “<i>Ashamnu</i>, <i>bagadnu</i>, etc.” (<i>Shlah</i>; <i>Perisha</i>). Even though this list, too, is not specific, since it specifies more types of sin in alphabetical order, it includes, explicitly or implicitly, all sins.<br>It is proper to confess for our ancestors’ sins as well (<i>Sha’arei Teshuva</i> 1:40). Therefore, our <i>vidui</i> includes the line, “For in truth, we and our fathers have sinned” (<i>Shlah</i>). There is a profound wisdom here. Alongside the mitzva to honor one’s parents, one must also repair his family’s bad habits. When one confesses his ancestors’ sins, he can free himself of them and repair them. If he does not confess them, we are afraid that he will repeat them inadvertently. This <i>vidui</i> is also fulfilled with the general formula (“we and our fathers have sinned”); but if someone feels it will facilitate his repentance, he should specify the sins, as explained below in section 6.</i>",

How can someone who is careful with other people’s money declare, “We have robbed”? The answer is that the mitzva of <i>vidui</i> on Yom Kippur is communal.

Sometimes he was in a position to object to their behavior but did not do so. Other times, he could have inspired them to repent, had he made the effort. It is also possible that had he been a better role model, he would have positively influenced them, so they would not have sinned. Finally, all Jews bear responsibility for one another. We are like one body made up of many parts. Therefore, the sin of any Jew is the responsibility of all. Thus, even the righteous must confess.

                    "Since Yom Kippur is the time of forgiveness, atonement, and acceptance of the Jews’ repentance, and since repentance requires <i>vidui</i>, it is a mitzva to confess as soon as Yom Kippur begins, meaning, at <i>Ma’ariv</i>. However, the Sages were concerned that something might go wrong at the pre-fast meal – someone might get drunk and be unable to confess during <i>Ma’ariv</i> or might choke during the meal and die before confessing. Therefore, they ordained that each person confess at <i>Minḥa</i>, prior to the pre-fast meal. Nevertheless, <i>vidui </i>must be repeated at <i>Ma’ariv</i> on Yom Kippur, as that is still the primary time for <i>vidui</i> and atonement. Despite having confessed at <i>Ma’ariv</i>, we confess again at <i>Shaḥarit</i>, <i>Musaf</i>, <i>Minḥa</i>, and <i>Ne’ila</i> (<i>Yoma</i> 87b). Given that we have just confessed and have not had time to sin, this would seem to be unnecessary. Nevertheless, whenever we stand in prayer before God on Yom Kippur, it is appropriate to confess, as repentance is the mitzva of the day. (This is different from the rest of the year, when even those who confess every day do not do so during the <i>Amida</i>.) Additionally, it is possible that one sinned after <i>Ma’ariv</i>, so he must confess again at <i>Shaḥarit</i>. Similarly, he may have sinned after <i>Shaḥarit</i>, so he must confess during <i>Musaf</i>, and so on. For Yom Kippur continues to atone until the end of the day, when it gets dark (<i>Levush</i>,<i> </i>SAH 607:1).",

Technically, an individual is not required to confess during the repetition, though he must stand (SA 607:3). However, in practice, the Rishonim write that it is proper for the members of the congregation to recite <i>vidui</i> together with the <i>ḥazan</i> (Ran; Rema) so that everyone recites <i>vidui</i> ten times over the course of the day, corresponding to the ten times that the Kohen Gadol uttered the Tetragrammaton (10:15-16 below). The ten confessions are: one before the fast during the silent <i>Amida</i> of <i>Minḥa</i>, one at night during the <i>Amida</i> of <i>Ma’ariv</i>, and eight more during the four prayer services of the day: <i>Shaḥarit</i>, <i>Musaf</i>, <i>Minḥa</i>, and <i>Ne’ila</i>. In each of these four services, one <i>vidui</i> is recited during the silent <i>Amida</i> and a second is recited during the <i>ḥazan</i>’s repetition. The <i>vidui</i> that we recite during the <i>Seliḥot</i> after the <i>Amida </i>of <i>Ma’ariv</i> does not count, as it is not recited within an <i>Amida</i> (<i>Tur</i> 621; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 2).",

Aḥaronim write that it is proper to follow this stringency (<i>Shlah</i>). However, there is concern that some people will not be able to recite it because they drank during the meal. Therefore, they ordained the recitation of <i>vidui </i>at <i>Minḥa </i>as well, before the meal. The main purpose, however, is to enter Yom Kippur with the right mindset. One may fulfill this <i>vidui </i>by reciting the minimum: “But we have sinned, done wrong, and rebelled.” In practice, two customs have developed to fulfill the stringency right before Yom Kippur: Ashkenazim recite <i>Tefila Zaka</i>, which contains detailed confessions (MB 607:1), while Sephardim recite the poem <i>Lekha Keli Teshukati</i>, which includes confessions.

He bases it on the confession of Moshe Rabbeinu following the sin of the Golden Calf: “Moshe went back to the Lord and said, ‘Alas, this people is guilty of a great sin in making for themselves a god of gold’” (Shemot 32:31). At the same time, specifying one’s sins, on some level, impinges on the honor of heaven, for the goal of repentance is to minimize the importance of sins, and speaking about sins grants them significance. Additionally, shame over one’s sins is fundamental to repentance, as the Sages say, “If one sins and is ashamed of it, he is forgiven for all his sins” (<i>Berakhot</i> 12b). One who specifies his sins may seem as though he is not ashamed of them. Thus, R. Akiva maintains that one who confesses need not specify his sins, as it says, “Happy is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered over” (Tehilim 32:1).",

One who knows that specifying his sins will deepen his repentance should specify them silently. For example, if he ate non-kosher food, he should say, “I have eaten non-kosher food” (SA 607:2; Vilna Gaon <i>ad loc</i>.; SHT <i>ad loc</i>. 3).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Beit Yosef</i> infers from Rif and Rosh that the <i>halakha</i> follows R. Akiva, and one who confesses need not specify his sins. <i>Itur</i>, <i>Or Zaru’a</i>, Me’iri, and <i>Tur</i> seem to rule this way as well. However, Rambam follows R. Yehuda b. Bava and requires that the sins be specified (MT, Laws of Repentance 2:3). This is also the position of <i>Smag</i>, Raavya, <i>Roke’aḥ</i>, and <i>Sefer Ḥasidim</i>. Moreover, there is disagreement about how to understand R. Akiva’s view. Some take it to mean that specifying one’s sins is actually forbidden (<i>Pri Ḥadash</i>), while others say that it is permissible to do so silently, and sometimes even preferable (<i>Beit Yosef</i>). It would seem that R. Akiva himself would agree that there are two sides of this: On the one hand, it expresses profound regret; on the other hand, it indicates shamelessness and impinges on the honor of heaven. Therefore, R. Akiva says that it is not necessary to specify sins, but he would agree that when specifying sins will enhance one’s repentance, he should do so silently. This understanding accords with the ruling of <i>Shulḥan Arukh</i> (607:2). <i>Halakha </i>accords with R. Akiva that one is not required to specify his sins, but it is proper to do so silently.<br>But how can we accept the ruling of <i>Shulḥan Arukh</i> when several Rishonim say that one must specify his sins? It could be that we fulfill both views by reciting <i>Ashamnu</i>. On the one hand, it is quite specific and thus meets the requirements of R. Yehuda b. Bava (<i>Tosfot Yeshanim</i>, <i>Yoma</i> 86b). On the other hand, since everyone recites the same list, there is still an element of the individual covering up his sins and showing that he is ashamed of them (Rema in <i>Darkhei Moshe</i> 607 and on <i>Shulḥan Arukh</i> 607:2). I therefore wrote above that it is not necessary for an individual to detail his sins, but that it is good to do so if it will help him repent. See <i>Harḥavot</i>.</i>",
                    "There is a disagreement among the Sages as to whether one who confessed his sins the previous Yom Kippur should confess the same sins again (<i>Yoma</i> 86b). Some say, “Of him, Scripture says, ‘As a dog returns to his vomit, so a dullard repeats his folly’ (Mishlei 26:11).” In contrast, R. Eliezer b. Yaakov says, “He is certainly praiseworthy, as we read, ‘For I recognize my transgressions and am ever conscious of my sin’ (Tehilim 51:5).” <i>Shulḥan Arukh </i>rules that one may confess again for sins to which he confessed the previous year (SA 607:4).",
                    "Perhaps we can suggest a guideline: If one feels that his repentance is incomplete, and that he has not yet managed to erase the sin from his heart completely, it is better for him to confess again. But if one feels that his repentance is complete and the sin is erased from his heart, it is not appropriate to confess, as doing so displays a lack of faith in the power of repentance. Sometimes a person repents completely and erases a sin from his heart, but a few years later suddenly thinks about it again and is distressed by it. This happens because his repentance was sufficient for his former spiritual stature; no trace of the sin was discernible. However, after he attains a greater, more illuminated spiritual stature, his previous repentance is no longer sufficient to cleanse him of any trace of sin. Therefore, he must confess again to erase the faint but lingering impression of his sin (<i>Tzidkat Ha-tzadik</i> 134:67)."

                    "The Gemara (<i>Yoma </i>86b) raised another important question in the context of <i>vidui</i>: Is it proper for a sinner to confess publicly? On the one hand, we have seen that a person should be ashamed of his sins and not confess them in the presence of others, as it says, “Happy is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered over” (Tehilim 32:1). On the other hand, we have learned that a sinner should not try to cover up his crimes. Rather, he should publicly confess them, as it says, “He who covers up his faults will not succeed; he who confesses and gives them up will find mercy” (Mishlei 28:13).",
                    "The Gemara records two views. Rav explains that if a sin was committed in private, it should be confessed in private as well, as public confession impinges on the honor of heaven and publicizes that some people brazenly violate Torah commandments. However, if the sin was committed in public, it was a desecration of God’s name. The sinner can only rectify this by confessing publicly, so that the masses know that he repented. This will sanctify God’s name (<i>Sha’arei Teshuva</i> 1:18).",
                    "R. Naḥman explains that one should confess interpersonal sins publicly, so that everyone sees that his friend’s honor is important to him, which will also help his efforts to placate his friend. However, one who proudly hurts his friend publicly but asks for forgiveness privately has not repented adequately. In contrast, when sins are between man and God, generally it is preferable to confess privately, to avoid further desecration of God’s name.",
                    "In practice, one should consider both factors, namely, God’s honor and his friend’s honor and appeasement. In general, sins between man and God should preferably be confessed privately, though if the sin was committed publicly, in a way that desecrated God’s name, the confession should be public as well, as this restores divine honor. In contrast, interpersonal sins should generally be confessed publicly, as this is a better way for the offender to placate the injured party. However, in cases where a public confession would make things worse (for example, when only the two of them are aware of the offense, or when the injured party would prefer that the whole embarrassing incident be forgotten), clearly it is forbidden for the offender to confess publicly.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Some say that Rav and R. Naḥman disagree (<i>Leḥem Mishneh</i>, based on its understanding of Rambam, Laws of Repentance 2:5), while others maintain that they generally agree, except in rare cases (<i>Kesef Mishneh</i>). Still others argue that their views are complementary (<i>Sha’arei Teshuva</i> 1:18; this would seem to be the position of Raavad as well). This last approach is the one I present above, because each position has merit, and many <i>poskim</i> understand them this way. Additionally, even according to those who maintain that there is a disagreement between Rav and R. Naḥman, in most cases they still agree with one another. For example, they may disagree about an interpersonal sin that was committed in public (when Rav says it is preferable to confess in public, while R. Naḥman maintains it is preferable to do so in private – <i>Kesef Mishneh</i>). But when the sin involves a desecration of God’s name, even R. Naḥman agrees that the <i>vidui</i> should be public. Similarly, they may disagree when an interpersonal sin was committed in private (when Rav says it is preferable to confess in private, while R. Naḥman maintains it is preferable to do so in public). But when a public confession could further hurt the injured party, it is clear that R. Naḥman would agree that the confession should not be public. Therefore, I focus on the cases where both agree. In a case where they might disagree, the offender must weigh the factors and determine which approach is better in the particular instance.<br>The Sages say that one who tells others of a sin he committed in private is called brazen, as he desecrates God’s name. They then ask: How could Reuven have confessed to changing his father’s sleeping arrangements? They answer that a sinner must confess when there is a possibility that not doing so will result in someone else being wrongfully suspected (<i>Sota</i> 7b). With this precedent, some Aḥaronim say that it is permitted to publicly admit to one’s sins when there is a legitimate need to do so (<i>Pri Ḥadash</i>; <i>Sha’arei Teshuva</i> 607:2).</i>"

                    "For all Torah matters, night precedes day, so Yom Kippur begins at night and concludes at the end of the following day. However, it is unclear as to precisely when day ends and night begins. Does the day end when the sun sets and is no longer visible, or when it gets dark enough to see three medium-sized stars? In Eretz Yisrael, the difference between these times is about twenty minutes, with some seasonal variation. The twilight period between <i>shki’a</i> (sunset) and <i>tzeit ha-kokhavim </i>(nightfall) is referred to as <i>bein ha-shemashot</i>. Since the mitzva to refrain from work on Shabbat and Yom Tov is of Torah origin, we are stringent about the timing, in accordance with the well-known principle, “We are stringent in cases of uncertainty about Torah law.” Thus, Shabbat and Yom Tov begin at <i>shki’a</i> and end at <i>tzeit</i>.",
                    "There is also a mitzva to extend Shabbat and Yom Tov, meaning to accept the sanctity of the day a little before its starting time and extend it a little past its ending time. Accordingly, it is a mitzva to accept the day’s sanctity a few minutes before <i>shki’a</i>, and to end it a few minutes after <i>tzeit</i>. The custom is to wait about ten minutes past <i>tzeit</i> (SA 608:1; <i>Peninei Halakha: Shabbat</i> 3:1-2). Adding time shows that these days are beloved and very precious to us. Furthermore, by taking mundane moments and transforming them into sacred ones, we show the potential of the mundane. This transformation extends the day’s holiness to all the weekdays and elevates them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>halakha</i> that requires adding time from the weekday to sacred occasions is derived from a verse about Yom Kippur: “It shall be a Shabbat of complete rest for you, and you shall deprive yourselves; on the ninth day of the month at evening, from evening to evening, you shall observe this your Shabbat” (Vayikra 23:32). The Sages expound: On the one hand, it is impossible that we are meant to fast on the day of the ninth, as the verse says “at evening.” On the other hand, it cannot be that the fasting begins only at night with the onset of the tenth, as the verse clearly prescribes deprivation on the ninth. Rather, the verse is teaching us that we must add from the mundane to the holy, accepting Yom Kippur upon ourselves while it is still day. We also lengthen Yom Kippur at its departure, since “from evening to evening” implies that the holiness of the day is to be extended into the night. The fact that the verse says “observe this your Shabbat” (<i>tishbetu Shabbatḥem</i>) teaches us that on all the days we desist from labor – Shabbat and holidays – we must extend the day’s sanctity (Rosh Ha-shana 9a).</i>",
                    "It is a mitzva to verbally accept the holiness of the day. Women generally accept the sanctity of Yom Kippur when they recite the <i>berakhot </i>over candle lighting, when the day is invoked (see the next section). Men accept the sanctity of the day either upon reciting the <i>berakha</i> of <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> in the synagogue or by verbally accepting Yom Kippur (section 10 below).",

Though the main reason for lighting Shabbat candles is to enhance and honor the festive meal (which is why the candles are lit where we eat), nevertheless, even on Yom Kippur when eating is forbidden, lighting candles still honors the day. Additionally, it helps promote a peaceful household, as it allows the household members to see where things are and to avoid tripping over them.",

Since people dress nicely in honor of Yom Kippur, there was concern that candlelight might create a romantic ambience and arouse sexual desire (and sexual relations are forbidden on Yom Kippur). Others said that, on the contrary, it is better to light candles, since sexual relations are forbidden where there is light; the candles actually deter sin. The Sages declared that each community should follow its custom: Where the custom is to light, one should light, and where it is not to light, one should not light (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 53b; SA 610:1). The Sages added that the custom to light is more praiseworthy, so where there is no custom, it is better to enshrine the custom to light (<i>y</i>. <i>Pesaḥim</i> 4:4). This is the longstanding widespread custom.",
                    "All the laws that apply to lighting Shabbat candles apply to lighting Yom Kippur candles as well. The usual <i>berakha</i> recited is “<i>Barukh ata Hashem Elokeinu Melekh ha-olam</i>,<i> asher kideshanu be-mitzvotav ve-tzivanu le-hadlik ner shel Yom Ha-Kippurim</i>” (“Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, Who sanctified us with His <i>mitzvot</i> and commanded us to light Yom Kippur candles”).

Nevertheless, in practice we do recite the <i>berakha</i>, since lighting candles on Yom Kippur is a mitzva in honor of the day and to maintain domestic tranquility (Rosh, <i>Yoma</i> 8:9 and 8:27). In some places, even though it is a mitzva, people did not light out of concern that it would result in sexual relations. But everywhere else, the <i>halakha </i>reverts to the original practice, as it is a mitzva to light and recite the <i>berakha</i>. Indeed, this is the practice today (Rema 610:2; <i>Levush</i>; <i>Baḥ</i>; SAH; <i>Ben Ish Ḥai</i>, Vayelekh §9; <i>Ḥazon Ovadia</i>, p. 256; SSK 44:13).<br>Since one of the reasons for the custom to light Yom Kippur candles is to prevent a couple from engaging in sexual relations, it would seem that the candles should be lit in the bedroom (Rema 610:1) and that they should burn all night. Yet no one seems to be concerned about these issues (<i>Shulḥan Gavo’ah</i> 610:1). I would like to offer two possible explanations for this. First, most people in the past lived in small houses without separate bedrooms; everyone ate and slept in the same room. Those who felt that having light would prevent them from being tempted to sin could have made sure that their oil or candles would last until they fell asleep. Nevertheless, the concern about intimacy is not the primary reason why the Sages instituted lighting Yom Kippur candles. Lighting has intrinsic value, namely honoring Yom Kippur (as we indicate by reciting a <i>berakha</i>). Therefore, even people who have large homes with bedrooms (as most people do nowadays) are not obligated to light additional candles in their bedroom. A second reason that there is no custom to light in the bedroom is that it was customary on Shabbat and Yom Tov to fulfill the mitzva of marital intimacy. The nice clothes and candles in the main room contributed to a celebratory atmosphere and facilitated intimacy. However, in later years when it became apparent that candles do not really lead to marital intimacy, it was deemed unnecessary to light a candle in the bedroom on Yom Kippur, just as it is unnecessary to light a candle when the wife is a <i>nidda </i>at other times of the year. Nevertheless, many Aḥaronim write that it is a good idea <i>le-khatḥila</i> to have a little light in the bedroom on Yom Kippur night, as a subtle reminder of the prohibition of sexual relations.</i>",
                    "Women generally accept the sanctity of the day with candle lighting. Therefore, those who recite the <i>berakha</i> on the candles should recite <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> immediately afterward.

On Yom Kippur, though, <i>kiddush</i> is not recited, so the assumption is that women accept the sanctity of Yom Kippur when they light candles, and they recite <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> at that point (<i>Ben Ish Ḥai</i>, Vayelekh §9). However, one who wants to drive to the synagogue after lighting candles may have in mind that she is not yet accepting the sanctity of the day, as she can do on any Shabbat (<i>Peninei Halakha: Shabbat</i> 3:3). She then recites the <i>berakha</i> of <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> in the synagogue, for if she recites it at home after lighting the candles, she has accepted Yom Kippur and must refrain from any further <i>melakha</i> (MB 619:4; <i>Ben Ish Ḥai</i>, Vayelekh §9; SSK 44:14).<br>As we explained in <i>Peninei Halakha: Shabbat</i> 4:4, Ashkenazim and some Sephardim light Shabbat candles first and then recite the <i>berakha</i>, because some say that with the recitation of the <i>berakha</i>, they have accepted Shabbat and are no longer allowed to light the candles.

In practice, we nullify past vows and disclaim future vows, as explained above in section 5:11-12. <i>Kol Nidrei</i> may be recited during twilight (after <i>shki’a</i>) and even after <i>tzeit</i>, since it serves a Yom Kippur need – cleansing people of the sin of unfulfilled vows. See <i>Responsa Rivash</i> §394; <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 619:25; <i>Yeḥaveh Da’at</i> 1:59. An additional reason to permit annulling vows on Yom Kippur can be extrapolated from the laws of Shabbat. After an individual has accepted Shabbat, the Sages permit him to disregard rabbinic decrees for the sake of a mitzva (<i>Peninei Halakha: Shabbat</i> 3:4). Some maintain that this permission applies even after the entire community has accepted Shabbat upon itself (<i>ibid</i>. n. 4).

We immediately follow this with the quiet recitation of the sentence, “Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom forever and ever (<i>Barukh shem kevod malkhuto le-olam va-ed</i>).” Even though this sentence does not appear in the portion of <i>Shema</i>, or in the<i> </i>Torah at all, the Sages ordained its silent recitation (<i>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</i> 15:7 n. 1). The Talmud recounts the origin of this sentence: Before our patriarch Yaakov died, he gathered all his sons around him and wanted to reveal to them the end of days, but the Divine Presence left him. He said to his sons, “Perhaps one of you is not worthy. After all, Avraham had Yishmael, and Yitzḥak had Esav. Is that why I cannot reveal the end to you?” They responded by declaring unanimously, “‘Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God, the Lord is one.’ Just as the one God alone is in your heart, so too, the one God alone is in our heart.” At that point Yaakov said, “Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom forever and ever.” This story posed a dilemma to the Sages: What to do? Should we recite the sentence? It does not appear in the Torah! Yet how can we not recite it? Our patriarch Yaakov said it! Therefore, they ordained that it be recited quietly. “This is like a princess who smelled food stuck to the bottom of the pot (and craved them). If she were to admit to the craving, she would embarrass herself; if she were to say nothing, she would miss out. So her servants started sneaking them to her” (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 56a).",
                    "Another tradition maintains that Moshe Rabbeinu ordained this recitation. When he ascended to heaven, he heard the ministering angels praising God by saying, “Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom forever and ever.” Upon his descent, Moshe ordained that the Jews recite it quietly. The question was raised: Why did he not ordain that they recite it aloud? A parable was offered in response: To what can this be compared? To a confidant of the king who stole a very nice cloak from the royal palace and gave it to his wife, saying, “Do not wear this in public; only at home.” Only on Yom Kippur, when Israel is as pure as the ministering angels, may they recite it aloud (<i>Devarim Rabba</i> 2:36).",
                    "To understand the meaning of these ideas, we must first explain two levels of faith in one God. The first statement, the <i>Shema</i>, expresses the highest level of absolute unification, referred to as <i>yiḥud elyon </i>(“higher unification”). At this level, every aspect and detail unites to reveal God. The second statement, <i>Barukh shem kevod</i>, expresses the plane which came into being after the world’s creation, referred to as <i>yiḥud taḥton </i>(“lower unification”). This involves acceptance of the yoke of heaven based on God’s manifestation in this world, where every creature and every aspect has a real place; God gives them all life and rules over them in accordance with their deeds. This is called the revelation of His name (<i>shem</i>) and kingship (<i>malkhut</i>). That is, His name and His governance are manifest in the world, but not His essence. If He would reveal His essence, all of creation would be annulled and melt away before His great light. (See <i>Tanya</i>, <i>Sha’ar Ha-yiḥud Ve-ha’emuna</i>.)",
                    "The higher level of faith is extremely lofty, revealed only at the root of the soul and only at times of self-sacrifice. Accordingly, we are commanded to tap into <i>yiḥud elyon</i> only twice a day, with the recitation of <i>Shema</i>. The Sages ordained pairing it with <i>yiḥud taḥton</i>, which acknowledges God’s manifestation within this diverse world. (See <i>Nefesh Ha-ḥayim</i> 3.) <i>Yiḥud taḥton</i> is very precious to God, as the purpose of creation is for God to be recognized within this material world, with all its beauty and glory, colors and sounds, urges and inclinations. Thus, the ministering angels praise God with the amazing paean, “Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom forever and ever.” However, saying it out loud is improper, because alongside the positives of revealing the Divine Presence in this world, there are also negatives – evil impulses that can draw us to sin. Therefore, one must first connect to <i>yiḥud elyon</i> and only then quietly recite the praise of <i>yiḥud taḥton</i>, to avoid the temptations of this world.",
                    "Only on Yom Kippur, as we fast and desist from occupation with our bodily needs, to the extent that we become like ministering angels, impervious to the evil inclination, can we utter <i>Barukh shem kevod</i> aloud, knowing that we are privileged to sanctify His name in this world. Even though we sometimes stumble into sin, on Yom Kippur it is revealed that ultimately, we draw down His light into this world, in all its complexity. As a result, God judges the Jews with love and mercy. (See <i>Derekh Hashem</i> 4:4:6-7.)"

                    "After <i>Shaḥarit</i>, two Torah scrolls are removed from the ark. From the first scroll we read the description of the Kohen Gadol’s <i>avoda </i>on Yom Kippur, which is found in the portion of Aḥarei Mot (Vayikra 15). Six people are called up to the Torah. The number of people called up to the Torah for an <i>aliya</i> changes in accordance with the holiness of the day. On Yom Tov, when <i>melakha</i> is forbidden but food preparation is permitted, five people are called up. On Yom Kippur, when all <i>melakha</i> is prohibited, six people are called up. On Shabbat, when all <i>melakha</i> is prohibited and the punishment for desecration is greater, seven people are called up.

Thus, when Yom Kippur is on Shabbat we fast, as explained above in section 6:6 and n. 2.</i>",
                    "The <i>maftir</i> is read from the second Torah scroll. It is taken from the portion of Pinḥas and deals with the additional (“<i>musaf</i>”)<i> </i>sacrifices offered on Yom Kippur (Bamidbar 29:7-11). The <i>haftara</i> is from Yeshayahu (57:14-58:14), which is an appropriate choice because the prophet exhorts the people to repent, and the verses mention resting on Shabbat and Yom Kippur.",
                    "At <i>Minḥa</i> there are three <i>aliyot</i>, and we read a section of the Torah dealing with prohibited sexual relations (Vayikra 18). It is meant to inspire the people to repent for and refrain from these extremely tempting but very serious transgressions that impair our holiness. The <i>haftara</i> is the Book of Yona, which teaches us about divine providence, from which no one can hide. It also teaches us about the great power of repentance, which is effective even when incomplete, as God does not wish to punish sinners (<i>Megilla</i> 31a; SA 621:1).",
                    "On Yom Kippur, it is customary to pledge money to the poor and to those dedicated to Torah study, in order to elevate the souls of parents and family members who have passed away. For the dead also achieve atonement on Yom Kippur when charity is given on their behalf (<i>Mordekhai</i>; SA and Rema 622:4). This is why the day is called Yom Ha-kippurim (in the plural), as it atones for both the living and the dead. But haven’t those who have died already been judged? How can charity help them? When their children and family members are inspired to donate money and do good deeds in their memory, it shows that the departed souls continue to have a positive influence on the world. Therefore, they earn the right to be judged again in the heavenly court, taking into account the additional merits they have accrued.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Another answer is that in the heavenly court it is said that if the deceased were still alive, they, too, would give charity. Ashkenazim recite <i>Yizkor</i>, the memorial prayer, on Yom Kippur, Pesaḥ, Sukkot, and Shavu’ot. The prayer is meant to be recited with the congregation but may also be recited by an individual praying alone (<i>Gesher Ha-ḥayim</i>, vol. 1, 32:1). Generally, before the prayer is recited, the <i>gabbai</i> announces “<i>Yizkor</i>”, and those whose parents are both still alive leave the synagogue temporarily. Several reasons are given for this practice. The primary one is that it is unpleasant to have some members of the congregation recite the prayers while others stand silent. Additionally, there are those who are concerned about bad omens. There is a common custom that the first time one is mourning a parent, he does not recite <i>Yizkor</i> during the year of mourning. This is out of concern that if he did recite <i>Yizkor</i>, his powerful grief might make it impossible for him to fulfill the mitzva of rejoicing on the holiday.

                    "During <i>Musaf</i>, it is customary to bow down at various points during the description of the Yom Kippur <i>avoda </i>(Temple service), just as the <i>kohanim</i> and the spectators in the Temple courtyard bowed and fell to the ground when the Kohen Gadol uttered the Tetragrammaton. As we will see (10:15-16), the Kohen Gadol uttered it ten times: nine of them in the course of three confessions, and the final one when he announced which goat was for God. The three confessions were on behalf of himself and his wife, on behalf of his fellow priests, and on behalf of the nation. Nowadays, the general custom is to bow four times during the prayer service. We bow once during the descriptions of each of the three confessions. The timing of the fourth bow, however, is the subject of dispute. Sephardim bow when they mention the goat for God (<i>Beit Yosef</i>; see 10:9 below). Ashkenazim bow when reciting “we bow” (“<i>va-anaḥnu kor’im</i>”) in <i>Aleinu</i>, preceding the description of the Kohen Gadol’s <i>avoda</i> (Raavya; Rivash; Rema 622:4). Yemenites do not bow at all during <i>Musaf</i>.",
                    "There are three types of bows: prostration (<i>hishtaḥavaya gemura</i>), in which a person lies flat on the ground with hands and feet outspread; <i>kida</i>,<i> </i>a deep bow in which a person remains standing but bows his head all the way to the ground; and <i>keri’a</i>, when one first kneels and then bends forward until his face reaches the ground (<i>Berakhot</i> 34b; <i>Shevu’ot</i> 16b). Nowadays, most people do <i>keri’a</i>, while some do <i>hishtaḥavaya</i>.",
                    "It is customary to place something on the ground as a barrier between the floor and the worshipper’s face. This is because it is forbidden to bow on a stone floor, as we read, “You shall not place figured stones in your land to worship upon” (Vayikra 26:1). The reason for the prohibition may be that idolaters would worship nature and bow to stones in an attempt to become one with them. The Torah forbids bowing on stone so that no alien ideas infiltrate our prayers. Only in the Temple, where it was clear that all creations – animate and inanimate – were subservient to God, yearned for Him, and bowed to Him alone, was it permitted to bow on a stone floor (<i>Sefer Ha-ḥinukh</i> §349).",
                    "The Torah prohibition applies when two conditions are met: the person is lying prostrate, and his head is on a stone floor. The Sages extend the prohibition and forbid bowing when either one of these conditions is met. Thus, <i>hishtaḥavaya</i> is prohibited even on a dirt floor, and even <i>kida </i>and <i>keri’a </i>are forbidden on a stone floor. For this reason, people spread something as a barrier between the floor and their heads (Rema 131:8).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Both <i>keri’a</i> and <i>kida</i> are permitted on a dirt floor. Bricks, which are made of sand, cement, and the like, have the same status as dirt (MB 131:41). One may perform <i>keri’a </i>or <i>kida </i>on a stone floor as long as something separates his head from the floor. It is not necessary to have something separating the rest of the body from the floor (MT, Laws of Idol Worship 6:7; <i>Levush</i> 131:7; MB 621:14). Alternatively, a person may kneel and incline his head toward the ground without actually touching it. One who does not have anything to use as a barrier between his head and the floor may do this. If the floor is made of stone, Aḥaronim disagree as to whether one may fully prostrate himself if he puts something down to separate himself from the floor (SHT 131:44). This may be why many people bow rather than prostrate themselves. It is also possible that the reason most people do not prostrate themselves is because there is usually not enough room in the synagogue for everyone to do so.<br>If the flooring is made of a material other than stone, even if it looks like stone, all agree that one may put down a separation and then prostrate himself.</i>"

But since God is so exalted and mighty, great and awesome, one becomes overwhelmed and awestruck when confronting His tremendous grandeur. He naturally bows and prostrates himself in self-negation before God. As we have seen, there are three types of bowing. Each has its own significance.",
                    "Prostration (<i>hishtaḥavaya</i>) means lying prone with one’s hands and feet extended, expressing absolute self-effacement before God. This is not a self-effacement of non-existence, but a self-effacement born of clinging to God, through which one can draw down blessing upon himself from the Source of life. King David frequently bowed to God, thanking Him for His help, as we read, “But I, through Your abundant kindness, enter Your house; I bow down in awe at Your holy Temple” (Tehilim 5:8). And similarly, “I bow toward Your holy Temple and praise Your name for Your kindness and faithfulness, because You have exalted Your name, Your word, above all. When I called, You answered me, You inspired me with courage…. High though the Lord is, He sees the lowly…” (<i>ibid</i>. 138:2-8).",

As in prostration, one’s entire body is near the ground; like in <i>kida</i>, one bends in submission to his Creator.",
                    "The Sages tell us that good things happen as a result of prostration:<br>Avraham returned unharmed from Mount Moriah together with Yitzḥak only in the merit of his prostration, as we read, “We will worship (<i>ve-nishtaḥaveh</i>) and we will return to you” (Bereishit 22:5). Israel was redeemed from slavery only in the merit of their prostration, as we read, “When they heard that the Lord had taken note of the Israelites and that He had seen their plight, they bowed low in homage (<i>ya-yikdu va-yishtaḥavu</i>)” (Shemot 4:31). The Torah was given only in the merit of prostration, as we read, “Then He said to Moshe, ‘Come up to the Lord, with Aharon, Nadav and Avihu, and seventy elders of Israel, and bow low from afar’” (<i>ibid</i>. 24:1). Ḥanna was remembered only in the merit of prostration, as we read, “And they bowed low there before the Lord” (1 Shmuel 1:28). Only in the merit of prostration will the exiles will be gathered in, as we read, “And on that day, a great ram’s horn shall be sounded; and the strayed who are in the land of Assyria and the expelled who are in the land of Egypt shall come and worship (<i>ve-hishtaḥavu</i>) the Lord on the holy mount in Jerusalem” (Yeshayahu 27:13). The Temple will be rebuilt only in the merit of prostration, as we read, “Exalt the Lord our God and bow down to His footstool; He is holy!” (Tehilim 99:5). The dead will be brought back to life only in the merit of prostration, as we read, “Come, let us bow down and kneel (<i>nishtaḥaveh ve-nikhra’a</i>), bend the knee before the Lord our Maker” (<i>ibid</i>. 95:6).

                    "When a person repents and confesses before God, it is proper that he prostrate himself, following the example of Moshe who prostrated himself when he prayed to God to forgive Israel’s sins (Bamidbar 14:5, 16:22; Devarim 9:25). For this reason, the Jews standing in the courtyard would prostrate themselves when the Kohen Gadol uttered the Tetragrammaton during the Yom Kippur confessions (<i>Yoma</i> 66a).",
                    "Following this line of thought, the Sages ordained that people bow five times during every <i>Amida</i>. This bowing is done while standing but bending deeply at the waist – similar to <i>kida</i> (<i>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</i> 17:6). It was also customary to prostrate oneself after the <i>Amida</i>, while confessing and offering supplications to God. This became known as <i>Nefilat Apayim</i> (“falling on the face”) and was a precursor to today’s <i>Taḥanun</i> (MT, Laws of Prayer 5:1, 13-14; <i>Tur</i> OḤ 131; <i>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</i> 21:1).",
                    "However, several concerns led to the discontinuation of the custom of actually “falling on the face.” On the halakhic level, besides the problem of prostration on a stone floor, there is an additional concern as well. A prominent person is permitted to “fall on the face” only when he is certain that God will respond, as He did to Yehoshua bin Nun (<i>Megilla</i> 22b; SA 131:8), and who can be certain of this? However, the primary concern is based on <i>Zohar</i>. It speaks extensively about the power of <i>Nefilat Apayim</i>, during which the supplicant must truly devote himself to God and see himself as if he is dead. It continues:<br>This must be done with intense concentration; then God is merciful and forgives his sins. Fortunate is the person who knows how to appeal to and worship his Master willingly and intentionally. Woe is to one who tries to appeal to his Master when his heart is distant and unwilling. He is the subject of the verse, “Yet they deceived Him with their speech, lied to Him with their words; their hearts were inconstant toward Him” (Tehilim 78:36-37). If the person says, “O Lord, I set my hope on You” (<i>ibid</i>. 25:1) while his heart is distant, this will be responsible for his premature death. (<i>Zohar</i>, Bamidbar 121a)<br>Since we are concerned about not being fully focused when we petition God, and about not being deserving, we no longer prostrate ourselves during <i>Taḥanun</i>. Instead, Ashkenazim and some Sephardim sit, leaning forward and resting the forehead on the forearm. Other Sephardim avoid even that (<i>Peninei Halakha</i>: <i>Prayer</i> 21:3).",

When Yom Kippur coincides with Shabbat, Rambam maintains that we still do not recite the <i>berakha</i> over spices. Ra’ah explains that the soul is comforted by the food that we may once again eat after Yom Kippur, rendering the spices unnecessary. Rashi (<i>Beitza</i> 16a and <i>Ta’anit</i> 27b, s.v. “neshama yeteira”) explains that the <i>neshama yeteira</i> is expressed through our increased capacity to delight in eating and drinking; therefore, following a fast, there is no need to comfort the soul. This is the ruling of SA 624:3.<br>Others say that we recite the <i>berakha</i> over spices after Yom Kippur that coincides with Shabbat, because the <i>neshama yeteira </i>is also expressed in an enhanced spirituality, which is now gone (Maharil; Avudraham).

To commemorate this, we too thank God for fire on <i>Motza’ei Shabbat</i>. However, after Yom Kippur, we recite the <i>berakha</i> over fire because during Yom Kippur we were not allowed to utilize fire, but it is now permitted to us once again. Therefore, the <i>berakha</i> must be recited specifically over a flame that was burning on Yom Kippur but could not be used because of the prohibition of using fire.

For on this day, atonement shall be made for you to purify you of all your sins; you shall purify yourselves before the Lord. It shall be a Shabbat of complete rest for you, and you shall deprive yourselves; it is a law for all time. (Vayikra 16:29-31)<br>One who does not fast fails to fulfill a positive commandment and violates a negative one. Even though the mitzva of <i>inui </i>(deprivation) is primarily about refraining from life-sustaining food and drink, it also includes four other prohibitions, discussed in the next chapter.",
                    "The mitzva is to refrain from eating even the tiniest amount and from drinking even a drop of water. One who eats or drinks in any amount violates a Torah prohibition. One who knowingly eats the volume of a large date (<i>kotevet</i>) or drinks a cheek-full of water is punishable by <i>karet </i>(extirpation), as we read, “Any person who does not deprive himself throughout that day shall be cut off from his kin” (Vayikra 23:29). If one transgresses unknowingly, he is liable to bring a sin offering. These punishments apply only if one eats or drinks an amount large enough to put his mind at ease, as then he is no longer considered to be experiencing <i>inui</i>. These <i>shi’urim</i> (minimum quantities, namely a cheek-full of drink and a <i>kotevet </i>of solid food) were received by Moshe at Sinai as the amounts that put one’s mind at ease. Still, one who eats or drinks anything at all transgresses a Torah prohibition.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">77</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Gemara explains that according to R. Yoḥanan, all Torah prohibitions related to eating apply even to less than a <i>shi’ur</i>, as we read, “You shall eat no fat” (Vayikra 7:23) – even in the smallest amount (<i>Yoma</i> 73b-74a). This is because any amount of eating, even just a tiny amount, may ultimately contribute to the <i>shi’ur</i> for which one is punishable (Ritva; see <i>Tosafot</i> 74a s.v. “keivan,” which explains that the rationale of “it may contribute” reinforces the inference from the verse). In contrast, according to Resh Lakish, eating less than a <i>shi’ur</i> is rabbinically prohibited. The <i>halakha</i> accords with R. Yoḥanan (MT, Laws of Resting on the Tenth 2:3 and Laws of Forbidden Foods 14:2). The Yerushalmi maintains that even Resh Lakish concedes that on Yom Kippur one who eats less than a <i>shi’ur</i> transgresses a Torah prohibition (<i>y. Terumot</i> 6:1). This is based on the verse, “It shall be a Shabbat of complete rest for you, and you shall deprive yourselves” (Vayikra 23:32). We see that one is meant to abstain entirely from anything which will detract from <i>inui</i> (Vilna Gaon).<br>When it comes to all other prohibitions pertaining to eating, one who eats an olive’s bulk (<i>kezayit</i>) is liable, as a <i>kezayit </i>is the minimum quantity that is considered “eating.” However, on Yom Kippur the criterion is what amount puts one’s mind at ease and negates the state of <i>inui</i>. The Sages have a tradition passed down by Moshe that for food this amount is that of a <i>kotevet</i>, and a cheek-full for drink (<i>Yoma</i> 80a-b).</i>",
                    "One who eats something that is not generally considered edible – such as leaves, twigs, an extremely sharp spice, or rotten food – does not transgress a Torah prohibition, as this is not the normal way to “eat.” Similarly, one who drinks a non-potable beverage – such as an extremely bitter or rotten liquid – does not transgress a Torah prohibition (SA 612:6-8; Rema <i>ad loc</i>. 9). Nevertheless, all of the above are prohibited rabbinically. Since this person has chosen to eat or drink them during the fast, he has made it clear that from his perspective they are edible or potable. Therefore, it is forbidden for him to eat or drink them. <i>Le-khatḥila </i>one must even avoid consuming less than a <i>shi’ur</i> (MB <i>ad loc</i>. 15).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Several Aḥaronim write that one who is fed via feeding tube due to a damaged esophagus may continue such feeding on Yom Kippur. They maintain that the prohibition applies only when someone gets pleasure from the taste and from the feeling of fullness that one obtains from food (<i>Ḥelkat Ya’akov</i>, OḤ 52; <i>Nishmat Avraham</i> 612:7 n. 2, based on <i>Eglei Tal</i>, <i>Minḥat Ḥinukh</i>, and others). But this is problematic because, in fact, this person does not experience <i>inui</i>, and the Torah does not directly command us not to eat or drink, but to experience <i>inui</i>. It seems, therefore, that one who is fed this way violates a rabbinic prohibition because he has negated the experience of <i>inui</i>, albeit in an irregular way (<i>shinui</i>). Maharsham (1:124) is of a similar opinion. <i>Ḥatam Sofer</i> OḤ 127 seems to say that one fed in this way violates a Torah prohibition as he does not experience <i>inui</i>. <i>Aḥiezer</i> 3:61 limits <i>Ḥatam Sofer</i> to cases where one derives pleasure from ingestion. Nevertheless, it seems to me that since the person ingests food in an irregular way, the prohibition is rabbinic.<br>Some claim that one may not take pills before Yom Kippur to ease the fast, as the mitzva is to experience <i>inui</i>, and doing this negates that experience (minority opinion in <i>Sdei Ḥemed</i>; R. Ḥayim David Halevy, <i>Mayim Ḥayim</i> 2:40). However, the leading view is the permissive one, since these pills have only a mild effect in creating a feeling of satiety. Their purpose is the same as eating before the fast, namely, to minimize the difficulty of the fast (majority opinion in <i>Sdei Ḥemed</i>; <i>Ḥelkat Ya’akov</i> 2:52; <i>Tzitz Eliezer</i> 7:32:4; <i>Yabi’a Omer</i> 9:54). Nevertheless, it would seem to be prohibited to take pills before Yom Kippur which make one feel especially good (such as strong painkillers which contain opioids), if the purpose is to alleviate the <i>inui</i>. However, one who must take such pills for medical reasons, to avoid severe pain, may take them before the fast and even on the fast (without water). Even though they alleviate some of his suffering, this is not his intention; this will be explained in the next section, in the discussion of caffeine pills.</i>"

Similarly, a migraine sufferer may take a pill to prevent the onset of a migraine.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">79</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Sages forbade taking medicine on Shabbat, lest it lead one to pulverize herbal ingredients to prepare medication. The <i>poskim</i> disagree as to whether this applies to medications produced today by factories as opposed to individuals. In practice, if one is really suffering, he may take pills; if he is just experiencing discomfort but not real pain, it is forbidden (<i>Peninei Halakha: Shabbat</i> 28:4-5, n. 3). One may also take pills that are taken regularly, such as sleeping pills and medications that must be taken for several consecutive days (<i>ibid</i>. 28:6).<br>The same applies to Yom Kippur. Though we have learned that the Sages forbade eating foul-tasting things on Yom Kippur, in this case, where the purpose of ingestion is not to eat but to take medicine or alleviate pain, the prohibition does not apply (<i>Igrot Moshe</i> OḤ 3:91; <i>Minḥat Shlomo</i> 2:58:25; SSK 39:8). One who suffers severe caffeine withdrawal and has no pills containing caffeine may swallow coffee grounds. Since their taste is extremely bitter, they have the same status as medicine.<br>One who is in pain and needs medicine that tastes sweet must add something bitter to it to ruin its taste and then swallow it. It is preferable to mix in the bitter substance before Yom Kippur. If only the coating of the medicine is sweet, and, medically speaking, it will not lose its effectiveness if crushed, he should crush it; the bitter taste of the medicine from the inside will ruin the flavor of the coating, and it may all be swallowed. This does not violate the prohibition of grinding, as grinding something that has already been ground is not considered <i>toḥen </i>(<i>Peninei Halakha: Shabbat</i> 12:1).<br>One who suffers migraines must still fast, even though fasting may trigger a miserable headache, since it entails no threat to life. It is important to realize that, in most cases, there are medications that can prevent the onset of a fasting-induced migraine. In rare cases, a migraine can trigger a stroke, which is indeed life-threatening. One is in this risk category, and thus exempt from fasting, if three conditions are met: 1) He has been diagnosed with fasting-induced migraines; 2) the migraine is preceded by an aura (symptoms that precede a migraine headache) that lasts over an hour; 3) there is no medication (like suppositories or sprays) that can prevent the migraines. Since the patients do not need to eat much at once to prevent the migraine, he should eat and drink in minimal quantities (“<i>le-shi’urim</i>”).

In that case, the Jew is not required to sacrifice his life to avoid transgressing, but he may choose to do so in order to sanctify God’s name (<i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Avoda Zara</i> 27b, s.v. “yakhol,” even though Rambam in MT, Laws of Torah Principles 5:1, disagrees and writes that he may not choose death). In our case (of someone dangerously ill), all agree that he may not fast, as doing so does not involve any element of sanctifying God’s name. Rather, just as God commands him to fast, here He commands him to take care of his health.</i>"

                    "The problem is that many doctors, whether out of excessive caution or lack of respect for the mitzva of fasting on Yom Kippur, always tell anyone who is sick to eat and drink. Some doctors mistakenly believe that if they tell a sick person to eat or drink only minimal quantities (<i>le-shi’urim</i>), there is no prohibition. In truth, the Torah forbids eating and drinking even in small quantities. Only in the case of a patient deemed dangerously ill enough to eat and drink is it preferable, when possible, to eat and drink <i>le-shi’urim</i> (as explained in the next section).",
                    "Therefore, questions about fasting must be posed to a God-fearing doctor. This does not mean asking a doctor who wears a particular type of head-covering; rather, the doctor must be moral and ethical, and reach decisions responsibly, factoring in both the sanctity of the day and the sanctity of human life. Patients have the responsibility to approach the doctor out of reverence for God, for if they pressure the doctor to permit them to eat and drink, they are putting the doctor in a very difficult position: He already bears great responsibility, and they are now making it difficult for him to determine whether they are really at risk, or if they simply want to get out of fasting even though there is no risk to life at all. A critical amount of the doctor’s information comes from patient input, so when a patient presses for a dispensation, the doctor may conclude that he is in bad shape and permit him to eat and drink minimal quantities, whereas if the patient had reported honestly, it may have clarified that the situation is not life-threatening at all. In cases of misrepresentation, responsibility for the erroneous ruling lies primarily with the patient.",
                    "A God-fearing doctor who is uncertain as to whether a person must fast should consider: “What would I do on Yom Kippur were I to find out that this person was fasting? Would I be willing to violate Yom Kippur by driving for ten minutes to instruct the patient to eat and drink, thus possibly saving his life?” If the answer is yes, it indicates that the doctor believes that there is a true danger to life, and he should instruct the patient beforehand to eat and drink on Yom Kippur. If, however, despite the responsibility he feels for his patient’s well-being, he would not be willing to drive on Yom Kippur for him, it indicates that the doctor believes there is no real danger to life, and he should instruct the patient to fast. This suggestion is effective for the average doctor, who is not lazy but also prefers not to rush from one patient to another.",

If the patient did not ask, and Yom Kippur has begun, he should eat and drink. Although we are uncertain whether the doctor answered in accordance with <i>halakha</i>,<i> </i>it nevertheless remains a case of uncertainty (<i>safek</i>)<i> </i>in which life is at stake. We therefore are stringent and instruct the patient to eat and drink.",
                    "It is important to know that even though these halakhic decisions are in the hands of doctors, if a patient thinks that his life may be in danger, and that eating and drinking can save him, then even if the doctors disagree, he should eat and drink. This is because sometimes a person can sense the gravity of his condition more than doctors can, as it is written, “The heart alone knows its bitterness (Mishlei 14:10)” (<i>Yoma</i> 83a; SA 618:1). However, if the patient says he must eat, and the doctor thinks that eating would endanger his life, we pay heed to the doctor (AHS 618:5-6; SSK 39:4).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">81</sup><i class=\"footnote\">With respect to these <i>halakhot</i>, there is no difference between a Jewish and a non-Jewish doctor. The key factor is trustworthiness (MB 618:1). The Gemara (<i>Yoma </i>83a) and Rishonim (<i>ad loc</i>.)<i> </i>address cases in which the doctors disagree. In practice, if one doctor says the patient needs to eat, and another says he does not, it is a case of uncertainty, and he should eat (SA 618:2). If two doctors maintain that he does not need to eat, and one says that he does, we follow the majority (SA 618:3). If two doctors say he must eat, we listen to them, even if a hundred other doctors say he need not eat (SA 618:4). If the doctors who say he need not eat include those who are clearly more expert, then since that group has both the majority and the greater expertise, we listen to them and require him to fast, even if two doctors say he must eat (<i>Mateh Ephraim ad loc. </i>3; see MB <i>ad loc. </i>12).<br>Accordingly, if conventional medicine dictates that one should fast, while alternative practitioners say he should eat, we disregard the alternative practitioners, and the patient must fast; conventional doctors are considered more expert because they rely on comprehensive research, and they also constitute a majority. However, if the patient is convinced that the alternative practitioner is correct, he may eat. (See Rema 618:4.)<br>In <i>Peninei Halakha: Shabbat</i> 27:2, I explain that we listen to the patient over the doctors as long as there is some logic to the patient’s claims. However, if the disease and its treatment are known, but the patient demands treatment that the doctors deem ineffective and that entails Shabbat desecration by someone other than the patient, we listen to the doctors (BHL 328:10 s.v. “ve-rofeh”). Likewise, if the patient is known to be excessively fearful, and the attending caregiver is certain that he is not in danger, the patient should not eat. If, despite the doctor’s view, and despite being aware of his own tendency to worry excessively, he remains sure that he must eat, he may act accordingly. (See <i>Tzitz Eliezer</i> 8:15:7:25, which states that sometimes it is permissible for the patient to desecrate Shabbat on his own behalf, even when it would be forbidden for a doctor.)</i>"

Although eating or drinking even tiny amounts is prohibited by the Torah, ingesting a full <i>shi’ur </i>increases the gravity of the transgression: Doing so knowingly incurs the punishment of <i>karet</i> (extirpation) and doing so unknowingly obligates him to bring a sin offering. Therefore, ingesting less than a <i>shi’ur</i> is preferable.",

                    "Likewise, diabetics whose condition has no stable treatment must be very cautious. If there is concern that eating and drinking <i>le-shi’urim </i>will lead them to be neglectful and not eat as much as they need, they should eat normally. It is also better that they pray in the synagogue with a <i>minyan</i> and eat substantial amounts every few hours, rather than eating minimal amounts over an extended period of time and thus be unable to come to synagogue.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">82</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ramban infers from the Gemara in <i>Keritot</i> 13a that a pregnant woman who is in danger and needs to eat on Yom Kippur should eat less than the minimum punishable quantities. He extrapolates from this case to all sick people and concludes that they should all eat and drink <i>le-shi’urim </i>when possible. This is also the position of Rosh, <i>Hagahot Maimoniyot</i>, <i>Tur</i>, and SA 618:7. On the other hand, Rif, Rambam, and many other Rishonim do not mention the idea of <i>le-shi’urim</i> at all, nor is this mentioned in <i>Yoma</i>. In their view, the Gemara in <i>Keritot</i> does not apply to a pregnant woman on Yom Kippur, but rather to a pregnant woman who needs to eat something prohibited. Indeed, several Aḥaronim write that a dangerously ill person should eat and drink whatever he needs on Yom Kippur, with no limitations (Netziv; <i>Or Same’aḥ</i>; R. Ḥayim of Brisk). Nevertheless, the accepted ruling is that when possible, it is preferable to eat and drink <i>le-shi’urim</i>. This is somewhat difficult to understand, as we know that when it comes to danger to life on Shabbat, we do not instruct people to try to minimize the prohibition by asking a non-Jew or minor to carry out a lifesaving <i>melakha</i>, as we are concerned that it will cause people to be neglectful in their lifesaving efforts (<i>Tosafot</i>). We are also concerned that at a future time, if no non-Jew or child is present, people will waste time looking for them, and in the interim the sick person will die (Ran). Based on these concerns, the Sages teach that one should not try to use a <i>shinui</i> when undertaking lifesaving activities, lest it cause delay or negligence. If, on Shabbat, the Sages do not require people to attempt to downgrade from Torah prohibitions to rabbinic prohibitions out of concern for negligence, why is the accepted ruling to try to minimize the severity of the prohibition, particularly since eating minimal quantities still entails violation of a Torah prohibition? (See <i>Peninei Halakha: Shabbat</i> 27:4-5.)<br>It seems that since the status of the dangerously ill person is known before Yom Kippur, and we can prepare in advance in an orderly fashion, there is no concern for negligence. On the other hand, it is possible that those Rishonim who do not mention eating <i>le-shi’urim</i> are concerned that precise instructions to minimize the prohibition would adversely affect people’s lifesaving efforts. This provides an answer to a question raised by R. Yaakov Ettlinger. He writes that we permit the sick to eat only precisely what is necessary; anything more than that is biblically prohibited. He then expresses surprise that the <i>poskim</i> do not mention this (<i>Binyan Tziyon</i> §34). We can answer that they do not mention it because in practice it is difficult to establish exactly how much a patient must eat or drink, so to avoid any possibility of endangering life, we permit someone dangerously ill to eat and drink as much as he needs. <i>Hilkhot Ḥag Be-ḥag</i> quotes R. Elyashiv as saying this (ch. 26 n. 33), and it is similar to the ruling that we take care of the sick on Shabbat exactly as we would on a weekday (SA 328:4; see <i>Peninei Halakha: Shabbat</i>, ch. 27 n. 4). It should be noted that there have been tragedies in which diabetics who needed to eat on Yom Kippur did not do so and died as a result. Since many diabetics can function normally, they come to synagogue, but there it is difficult for them to eat <i>le-shi’urim</i>. Some have become weak and, without realizing the danger they were in, ended up passing out and dying. When there is any shadow of a doubt concerning danger, diabetics should eat as usual and then go to the synagogue, as the value of eating <i>le-shi’urim</i> does not take precedence over the value of going to the synagogue.</i>",
                    "Let us now explain the details of eating and drinking minimal quantities (<i>le-shi’urim</i>). For drinking, the minimum punishable quantity is a mouthful, that is, the interior of the mouth plus one cheek is filled with the liquid. This amount varies from person to person. Therefore, the patient must determine how much water fills his mouth by spitting a mouthful into a cup and marking where the water reaches. <i>Le-khatḥila</i>, he should do this before the fast begins. On the fast, he should drink less than this amount each time.",
                    "For solid food, the minimum punishable quantity is the volume of a large date (<i>kotevet</i>) – smaller than an egg but larger than an olive, it is approximately 30 cc or one ounce (SA 612:1-5, 9-10).",
                    "These <i>shi’urim </i>also contain a time component. That is, to be punishable, one must eat or drink the requisite <i>shi’ur </i>in the time it takes to eat a half a loaf of bread (<i>akhilat pras</i>). Some maintain that this is nine minutes, and <i>le-khatḥila</i> it is good to follow this opinion. One who must eat and drink more frequently may suffice with a seven-minute break. When it comes to drinking, one may even suffice with a break of one minute, because some maintain that for drinking this is enough of a break (SA 618:7-8). There is no halakhic difference between water and other liquids; therefore, if drinking <i>le-shi’urim </i>suffices for a patient, it is recommended that he drink high-calorie beverages, which may make it unnecessary for him to eat.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">83</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For more on “<i>akhilat pras</i>,” see <i>Peninei Halakha: Pesaḥ </i>16:25 and <i>Peninei Halakha: Berakhot</i> 10:7. There are many opinions about its duration, ranging from 4 to 9 minutes. MB 618:21 says that on Yom Kippur we should be stringent in accordance with the opinion of <i>Ḥatam Sofer</i> and consider it 9 minutes. However, in times of need, one may be lenient and wait 7 minutes, which is longer than most opinions require. (In <i>Peninei Halakha: Berakhot</i> 10:7 I rule that eating a <i>shi’ur </i>within 7 minutes requires a <i>berakha aḥarona</i>.)<i> </i>In terms of drinking, Rambam uses a different criterion: the time it takes to drink a <i>revi’it</i> in a relaxed and continuous manner (MT, Laws of Resting on the Tenth 2:4). This is no longer than a minute. However, SA 618:8 states that <i>le-khatḥila</i> one should be stringent and follow Raavad, who equates drinking with eating. (Accordingly, one should wait 7 minutes.) In times of necessity, it is better to follow Rambam rather than drink more than <i>shi’ur</i> at once.</i>"

This fear is usually exaggerated, as fasting and the attendant weakness are generally not dangerous. (There are even some serious illnesses for which fasting may be helpful.) Nevertheless, it is possible that a person does have some issue which might make fasting dangerous. Therefore, if someone is so afraid he might die that he asks for food and drink despite the holiness of the day, we give it to him. However, since the need is sometimes simply psychological, we begin by giving him only a little. Sometimes this is enough to calm him and bring about a recovery. If this does not work, we continue giving him small quantities of food, spread out over time (as explained in the previous section). If this, too, does not work, he may eat and drink until he is reassured (SA 617:2-3).",

Many <i>poskim</i> use this strategy (<i>Kol Bo</i> §69, cited by <i>Beit Yosef</i> 618:1).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">84</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Zevin tells a remarkable story. Once, before <i>Ne’ila</i>, there was a commotion in the <i>beit midrash</i> of R. Ḥayim Halberstam, the Sanzer Rebbe. A rich congregant, desperately thirsty, almost passed out. This rich man was known to be very stingy. At first, some mocked him: “Throughout the year, this wealthy man is unwilling to give a poor person a little water to drink. Let him now experience thirst!” However, when the people standing around realized that he was truly in danger, they went to the <i>dayanim </i>to ask what they should do. The rabbis instructed them to give him a spoonful of water (less than a cheek-full). However, each spoonful they fed him seemed to make him thirstier, until he asked for a cup of water. The head of the <i>beit din</i>, Rav Berish,<i> </i>did not trust himself to rule on this, so he approached R. Ḥayim for a ruling. He interrupted R. Ḥayim’s holy worship, told him the whole story, and asked him what to do. R. Ḥayim said, “Tell him that for each cup that he drinks now, tomorrow he must donate a hundred guilder (a substantial amount) to charity. If he agrees to this, give him as much as he wants to drink.” When the wealthy, weak man heard this ruling, it revived him. He got to his feet, stood up straight, and continued to pray as if he was not thirsty at all (R. Shlomo Yosef Zevin, <i>Sipurei Ḥasidim: Mo’adim</i>, p. 101 [<i>A Treasury of Chassidic Tales on the Festivals</i>, vol. 1, pp. 117-118]).</i>",

Hopefully, he will merit long life as a reward for observing this mitzva. Torah giants made it a practice to admonish the sick about this. If they knew that a particular patient was likely to disregard medical advice and fast, thus endangering his life, they would visit him on Yom Kippur to persuade him to eat and drink."

                    "From the moment labor begins, or from the moment a woman must be rushed to the hospital to give birth, she is considered to be dangerously ill, and she must eat and drink as needed. She retains this status for seventy-two hours from the moment of birth. If these seventy-two hours end during Yom Kippur, she may eat and drink as needed until seventy-two hours have passed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">88</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to <i>Terumat Ha-deshen</i> §148 (cited in SA 617:4), we count until the end of the third day, regardless of the hour of birth. Thus, if a woman gave birth at any point on the seventh of Tishrei, she must fast on Yom Kippur. However, MB 330:10 states that some Rishonim calculate three days – 72 hours – starting from the exact time of the birth. These include Rosh, Ritva, and <i>Hagahot Asheri</i> based on <i>Behag</i>. This is how we rule in practice (SSK 39:15; <i>Yabi’a Omer</i> 7:53:7).</i> As we have seen, it is preferable for anyone dangerously ill to eat and drink <i>le-shi’urim</i> if it will not be harmful. However, if a woman postpartum wants to sleep, and eating and drinking <i>le-shi’urim</i> will make it hard for her to get the rest she needs, then she should eat and drink normally.",

                    "<b>The Laws of the Fast / Nursing Women</b>",
                    "As we have stated, pregnant and nursing women are obligated to fast on Yom Kippur (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 54b; SA 617:1). True, some contemporary <i>poskim</i> maintain that nursing women may drink <i>le-shi’urim</i>, so that the fast does not cause them to stop nursing. Nevertheless, according to most <i>poskim</i>, nursing mothers must fast on Yom Kippur and even Tisha Be-Av. Even though nursing makes the fast more difficult because of the additional loss of fluids, this is not life-threatening. It does not endanger the baby either, because even if the mother’s milk decreases or dries up, milk substitutes are available. In reality, women who fast are generally able to continue nursing.",
                    "Good advice for nursing mothers is to skip every other feeding. This will help them make it through the fast relatively easily. In other words, a woman who normally nurses every three hours should nurse at 10 AM. At 1 PM she should use formula or another substitute, and then nurse again at 4 PM. At 7 PM she should once again use a substitute. This way, she will not suffer too much during the fast, and she will not produce less milk. Some babies will not accept a substitute from their mother, in which case someone else needs to feed them formula.",
                    "Nevertheless, if the baby is small, weak, and sickly, and the doctor thinks that the baby has a special need for mother’s milk, and there is concern that if the mother fasts, her milk will dry up or be considerably depleted, she may drink <i>le-shi’urim</i> based on the instruction of a God-fearing doctor (BHL 617:1). However, this is rare; if a nursing mother drinks a lot the day before the fast, her milk will almost certainly not be depleted from fasting. It is even better if, starting three days before the fast, she drinks and sleeps more than usual. This will increase her milk supply. She can also pump in the days before the fast, so the baby will have plenty of milk during the fast, and there is no concern that the mother’s milk will be depleted.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">89</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If there is a reasonable chance that a mother’s milk will dry up or be seriously depleted due to fasting, some permit her to drink <i>le-shi’urim</i>, because, in their view, mother’s milk is necessary for the baby’s survival. (This is cited in the name of <i>Ḥazon Ish</i>.) They add that one should not take into account that good milk substitutes are available nowadays (<i>Halikhot Shlomo</i> 6:2; <i>Si’aḥ Naḥum</i> §36). Others testify in the name of various rabbis that even though the <i>sefarim </i>advise to be stringent, in practice we are generally lenient when questions arise. However, these claims are very difficult to sustain, because even though mother’s milk certainly has beneficial properties, and the prevailing medical view strongly encourages nursing, nevertheless, many women do not nurse at all, and we never hear of doctors being up in arms about this and claiming that nursing is necessary to save the babies’ lives. According to an Israeli national health survey from 2000, 10% of Jewish mothers in Israel do not nurse at all, about 70% nurse beyond one month, partially or entirely, only about 50% nurse longer than three months, and only about 32% nurse longer than six months. It stands to reason that many women who stop nursing do so for their own convenience, to facilitate their professional lives or studies. If these factors are sufficient for women to stop or cut down nursing, and the medical establishment does not strenuously object (as would be expected if this were truly life-threatening), then the facts indicate that cessation of nursing is not seen as jeopardizing babies’ lives.<br>Furthermore, in the past, infant mortality during the first year was very high, and no good milk substitutes were available. Yet the clear ruling was that nursing women were obligated to fast, even on Tisha Be-Av. How then can we even raise the possibility that nowadays this is life-threatening? Good substitutes are available, and we have never heard of a baby who died because his mother stopped nursing him. Even in the past, when there were no milk substitutes, leniencies were granted only in cases where the baby was sick. We see this in <i>Devar Shmuel</i> §107 (cited in <i>Responsa Ḥatam Sofer</i> 6:23); BHL 617:1; <i>Da’at Torah ad loc.</i>; and <i>Har Tzvi</i> (OḤ 1:201:1 toward the end). Therefore, a nursing mother may drink on Yom Kippur only if there is a specific medical reason that her sick baby needs mother’s milk, and there is a concern that fasting will deplete her supply. <i>Torat Ha-yoledet</i> (ch. 51 n. 11) and <i>Piskei Teshuvot</i> (617:2) incline this way as well.<br>As we stated, the leniencies stem from times when there were no milk substitutes. Back then, if a mother’s milk dried up, she had to hire a wet nurse. If she did not have money for this, the baby’s life was truly in danger due to the likelihood of malnutrition. Today, milk substitutes are available, so it would seem reasonable to be stringent even with sick babies. In practice, though, the ruling is made by a doctor. If the doctor feels that there is a certain danger to the baby’s life if he cannot have mother’s milk, and there is a reasonable fear that the mother’s milk will dry up as a result of the fast, one can rule leniently. However, if the doctor is one of those who instructs many nursing mothers to drink <i>le-shi’urim</i> on Yom Kippur, then most <i>poskim</i> say one cannot rely on his judgment. Rather, one should ask a doctor who proceeds from the assumption that stopping nursing is not normally life-threatening.<br>We must add that the possibility that a mother’s milk will dry up due to the fast is remote. Generally, fasting does not force a woman to stop nursing. That is, if one is careful, in the days before the fast, to drink at least three liters a day and sleep for eight (or at least seven) hours a day, it is very unlikely that her milk supply will be depleted. On the contrary, many women report that proper preparation for the fast improves their milk supply; they discover how helpful extra drinking and sleeping are for nursing. Moreover, even if a nursing woman did not prepare properly for the fast, if she drinks and rests a lot after the fast, her milk supply will generally return to normal. (Nevertheless, if a nursing woman is in the process of reducing the number of feedings, or has trouble nursing in general, lack of proper preparation for the fast may make it hard for her to replenish her milk supply.)<br>To sum up, the Torah commands us to fast on Yom Kippur. The Gemara and <i>poskim</i> explicitly state that a nursing woman is included in this obligation. (Even on the rabbinic fast of Tisha Be-Av, pregnant and nursing women are required to fast.) There is no justification for not observing this mitzva based on the unsupported claim that it is life-threatening for nursing women to fast.</i>"

                    "<b>The Other Deprivations / The Mitzva to Fast</b>",
                    "There is a positive commandment to fast on Yom Kippur, as we read, “In the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you shall deprive (<i>ve-initem</i>)<i> </i>yourselves” (Vayikra 16:29). The primary expression of this deprivation (<i>inui</i>, which may also be translated “affliction” or “suffering”) is refraining from life-sustaining food and drink, and the punishment of <i>karet </i>(extirpation) in the case of a knowing transgression and a sin offering in the case of an unknowing transgression apply only to one who eats or drinks. Nevertheless, the mitzva of <i>inui</i> includes four additional prohibitions, all of which are forms of deprivation. Together with the prohibition on eating and drinking, there are a total of five prohibitions: a) eating and drinking; b) washing; c) anointing; d) wearing shoes; e) sexual relations (<i>Yoma </i>73a).",
                    "The mitzva of <i>inui </i>does not require us to do things that inflict pain, like sitting in the midday sun. Rather, the mitzva is to desist from certain things whose deprivation causes suffering (<i>Yoma</i> 74b and 76b-77b). The basis for this understanding is the verse, “It shall be a Shabbat (<i>Shabbat</i>) of complete rest (<i>Shabbaton</i>) for you, and you shall deprive yourselves” (Vayikra 23:32). Our Sages expound: “<i>Shabbat</i>” – you should refrain (<i>tishbetu</i>) from eating and drinking; “<i>Shabbaton</i>” – you should refrain from other activities that would reduce <i>inui</i> (<i>Yoma</i> 74a). The Sages also infer from the fact that the Torah commands us to “deprive ourselves” five times that there are five activities from which one must desist.",
                    "The <i>poskim </i>disagree about how severe the additional four prohibitions are. Some say that since the Torah never explicitly states that eating and drinking are prohibited, but rather states, “You shall deprive yourselves,” it means that all five deprivations are included in the Torah’s commandment. According to most <i>poskim</i>, however, only eating and drinking are prohibited by the Torah, because the primary expression of <i>inui</i> is to be deprived of them. Still, the Torah did not explicitly state that the mitzva is to refrain from eating and drinking, but commanded us to deprive ourselves, to teach us that there must be additional expressions of our deprivation. Based on this, the Sages enacted the other four prohibitions.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">90</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Gemara (<i>Yoma</i> 76a) states:<br>What do these five deprivations correspond to? R. Ḥisda says: They correspond to the five<i> </i>times that the Torah mentions “<i>inui</i>”: “On the tenth [day of the same seventh month, you shall observe a sacred occasion when you shall deprive yourselves” (Bamidbar 29:7)]; “But the tenth [day of this seventh month is the Day of Atonement. It shall be a sacred occasion for you; you shall deprive yourselves” (Vayikra 23:27); “It shall be] a Shabbat of complete rest [for you, and you shall deprive yourselves” (<i>ibid</i>. v. 32); “It shall be] a Shabbat of complete rest [for you, and you shall deprive yourselves; it is a law for all time” (<i>ibid.</i> 16:31)]; “And this shall be to you [a law for all time: In the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you shall deprive yourselves” (<i>ibid</i>. v. 29).]<br>It would seem from this exegesis and that of “<i>Shabbat Shabbaton</i>” (<i>Yoma </i>74a) that all five prohibitions are from the Torah. Indeed, this is the position of <i>She’iltot</i>, <i>Behag</i>, <i>Itur</i>, and <i>Yere’im</i>.<br>However, other Rishonim maintain that the additional four afflictions are rabbinic. When the Torah speaks of the punishment of <i>karet</i> in the context of Yom Kippur (Vayikra 23:30), it says, “I will cause that person to perish (<i>ve-ha’avadeti et ha-nefesh</i>).” The Sages explain that liability to punishment by <i>karet</i> is limited to the type of deprivation that would lead to death (<i>ibud nefesh</i>) if continued for an extended period (<i>Yoma</i> 74b). This implies that it is only eating and drinking that are prohibited by the Torah. Furthermore, we find that R. Eliezer permits a king and a new bride to wash their faces and permits a postpartum woman to wear shoes. Moreover, washing minors and applying cream to them is permitted. If these actions were prohibited by the Torah, we would not find these leniencies. For these reasons, Rabbeinu Tam, Ri, Riva, Rashba, Rosh, Ritva, Me’iri, and <i>Sefer Ha-ḥinukh</i> maintain that the additional four prohibitions are rabbinic, and the prooftexts simply support the rabbinic laws (“<i>asmakhta</i>”)<i> </i>rather than serve as their source. Those who nevertheless maintain that all the deprivations are Torah prohibitions explain that the Torah authorizes the Sages to delineate their parameters. Therefore, the Sages can choose to be lenient in certain cases (Ran). If the additional deprivations are from the Torah, why do they not carry the punishment of <i>karet</i>? Because as long as one fasts, he is observing the primary deprivation.<br>I would like to suggest that all agree that these four prohibitions are rooted in the Torah, while the details are rabbinic. This is why the Torah obliquely describes the mitzva of the day as “<i>inui</i>,” which includes all types of deprivation, not just eating and drinking. According to most <i>poskim</i>, the Torah requires us to desist from eating and drinking (the primary form of deprivation), and leaves other matters which have an aspect of deprivation to the discretion of the Sages, while alluding in the verses that there are grounds to prohibit five things. Others say that even the four additional prohibitions are absolutely included in the Torah commandment, for desisting from them is part of the mitzva of <i>inui.</i> However, since they are not the primary forms of <i>inui</i>, their parameters were given to the Sages to delineate.</i>"

Similarly, after changing a diaper, one may wash one’s hands with soap and water to remove filth and dirt.

However, one who had a nocturnal emission on Yom Kippur should not immerse himself, even if he would normally do so, because the pious practice of immersing after a seminal emission does not override the prohibition on washing. Similarly, a <i>nidda</i> whose time to immerse coincides with Yom Kippur should postpone visiting the <i>mikveh </i>until the night after Yom Kippur (SA 613:11-12).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">93</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to <i>Yoma</i> 88a, one who experienced a nocturnal seminal emission may immerse on Yom Kippur. In practice, this is permitted by R. Yehuda ben Barzilai of Barcelona. One who normally immerses in this situation and is very uncomfortable not doing so may immerse according to Maharil, Mahari Weil, <i>Responsa Mahari Bruna</i> §49, and <i>Rav Pe’alim</i> OḤ 2:61. Some Ḥasidim also rule this way (<i>Piskei Teshuvot</i> 613:6 n. 23). However, many Rishonim prohibit immersion, maintaining that the Gemara’s leniency applied only when Ezra’s ordinance (requiring anyone who experienced a nocturnal emission to immerse before praying or studying Torah) was in force. Now that this is no longer required, the immersion is merely a pious custom and thus does not override the prohibition of washing on Yom Kippur (MT, Laws of Resting on the Tenth 3:3; Rabbeinu Tam; Maharam; <i>Mordekhai</i>; <i>Hagahot Maimoniyot</i>).

Even though normally we enhance this mitzva by washing the entire hand, on Yom Kippur we wash only to the base of the fingers, because technically this is adequate for both cleanliness and the removal of <i>ru’aḥ ra’a</i> (SA 613:2).

There is uncertainty regarding the status of one who relieves himself without touching any part of the body that is usually covered, as perhaps he does not need to wash, since he did not touch any filth. In order to avoid this uncertainty, when one relieves oneself it is best to touch a part of the body that is usually covered. This way, all agree that one may wash his hands until the base of his fingers, including the knuckles, in order to recite the <i>berakha</i> of <i>Asher Yatzar</i> in a state of cleanliness (SA 613:3, MB <i>ad loc. </i>4).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">94</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Many of these laws are the subject of disagreement. We will mention some of them and then clarify the <i>halakha</i>. According to most <i>poskim</i>, one is only required to wash each hand once after using the bathroom, but many have the custom of washing each three times. (See MB 4:39.) Similarly, on Yom Kippur, according to most <i>poskim</i> one washes once, while others say three times (R. Mordechai Eliyahu, <i>Hilḥot Ḥagim</i> 45:25). See <i>Peninei Halakha: Prayer</i> 8:3-5 n. 2. Some say that one who touches an area of the body that is usually covered should wash only that hand until the base of his fingers (<i>Ḥayei Adam</i> 40:18, MB 613:6). Others maintain that he must wash both hands (<i>Shlah</i>, <i>Yafeh La-lev</i>; see also <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 4:86). They also disagree about a case in which one touches his shoe – even if it is made of cloth – with one finger. Some say he must wash just that hand, while others say he must wash both hands. There are many other uncertainties regarding these laws. For example, does one who touches an area that is usually covered, but which nonetheless is not sweaty, need to wash his hands? (See <i>Peninei Halakha</i>: <i>Prayer,</i> ch. 5 n. 2.)<br>There is an apparent question pertaining to the view that one may wash on Yom Kippur in these circumstances. Technically, one who touches a sweaty part of the body may simply rub his hands on any sort of cloth and then recite sacred words (SA 4:23, MB <i>ad loc. </i>61). Why, then, do we not do so on Yom Kippur? It seems that whenever a person would wash his hands ritually under normal circumstances, he may wash them on Yom Kippur as well, even if technically it would be sufficient for him to rub his hands clean, because he is washing for the sake of a mitzva. If, however, he sometimes suffices with rubbing his hands on his clothing or the like, he may not wash on Yom Kippur, since for him this hand-washing is not a mitzva. Consequently, most discussions of this subject deal with people’s behavior during the year. Accordingly, we may ask: Why does <i>Shulḥan Arukh </i>permit washing only to the base of the fingers in the morning and after using the bathroom on Yom Kippur, if during the rest of the year, people normally wash to the wrist? I would like to suggest the following answer: Unlike most of the disagreements raised in the previous paragraph, where the <i>halakha </i>itself is the subject of dispute, according to <i>Shulḥan Arukh</i> washing to the wrist during the year is not a law but rather a mere stringency. Thus, on Yom Kippur we revert to the basic law and do not wash to the wrist. Most Aḥaronim agree with <i>Shulḥan Arukh</i>. Arizal, though, takes a different approach. According to him, washing the entire hand is required all year to remove <i>ru’aḥ ra’a</i>. However, on Yom Kippur, the power of the <i>ru’aḥ ra’a </i>is weakened, so it is sufficient to wash to the base of the fingers (<i>Ben Ish Ḥai</i>, Toldot 2; <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 4:14; see <i>Minḥat Yitzḥak</i> 10:45).</i>"

According to <i>Baḥ</i> and <i>Taz</i>, however, the laws pertaining to washing and applying ointment are the same. Both are forbidden if they are just to remove a little dirt, and both are permitted to remove real filth. MB (613:2) follows MA. In any case, nowadays no one uses oil to remove filth. If one changed a diaper and his hand smells bad, he may wash his hand with liquid soap. He need not worry about the prohibition of applying ointment, because soap is not oil which will be absorbed into the body, and the soap’s fragrance is simply meant to neutralize the bad odor. However, one may not use soap that contains enough moisturizing cream that it can be felt on the hand after use, as this constitutes anointing.<br>Some forbid using perfume and deodorant, but they do not explain whether this is because of the prohibition of washing or the prohibition of anointing (R. Ben-Zion Abba Shaul; R. Seraya Deblitzky). <i>Piskei Teshuvot</i> states that the problem is one of applying ointment (614:1). <i>Shemesh U-magen</i> similarly states that spraying perfume on the hand is considered applying ointment. However, the prohibition of anointing would seem to apply only to something that is meant to nourish the skin, in which case it would pertain neither to perfume nor to deodorant. Therefore, it seems, the relevant concern is only of washing. Interestingly, Ḥida permits <i>kohanim</i> to wash their hands in water to which rose water has been added for fragrance (<i>Ḥayim She’al</i> 1:74). We see that the fact that something makes a person smell good is not intrinsically prohibited. Therefore, if deodorant leaves enough residue that it could wet something else, it may not be used, as it constitutes washing. However, if it is not that wet, and the goal is simply to remove a bad odor, it is permitted. (This would seem to be the opinion of R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach in <i>Halikhot Shlomo</i>, <i>Bein Ha-metzarim</i>, ch. 14 n. 56, and is quoted in his name by R. Ovadia Yosef in <i>Ḥazon Ovadia: Arba Ta’aniyot</i>, p. 295, and by R. Avigdor Nebenzahl in <i>Yerushalayim Be-mo’adeha: Bein Ha-metzarim</i>, p. 274.) It seems to me that if a woman is worried that not using perfume will make her smell bad and repel her husband, she may use perfume or roll-on deodorant. Spray deodorant, which does not leave enough residue to wet something else, may also be used on Yom Kippur. However, stick deodorant is prohibited, because applying it is considered spreading (<i>Peninei Halakha: Shabbat</i> 14:5 n. 3).</i>"

                    "Neither shoes nor sandals may be worn on Yom Kippur. In the past, these were generally made of leather, because people did not know how to craft strong, durable, and flexible shoes from other materials. Shoes made of cork, rubber, or wood were often used at home, as slippers, and poor people, who would normally go barefoot, would sometimes wear them outdoors. The question arises: May one wear non-leather footwear on Yom Kippur?",
                    "Some Rishonim forbid walking in wooden shoes, because one walking in them does not feel the roughness of the ground beneath his feet. However, they permit cork and rubber shoes, because one walking in them feels the roughness of the ground and suffers accordingly (Rashi; Rambam; <i>Tosafot</i>; Rabbeinu Yeruḥam).",
                    "Other Rishonim permit wearing all non-leather shoes. They maintain that, by definition, non-leather footwear cannot be shoes. Rather, such “shoes” are just items of clothing, and as such they may be worn on Yom Kippur (Ramban; Rosh; Rashba). Indeed, most Aḥaronim rule this way in practice (SA 614:2).",
                    "However, it seems clear that this view presumes a reality in which non-leather shoes were uncomfortable for walking, and thus it could be claimed that these were not considered proper shoes. Nowadays, however, when manufacturers commonly produce high-quality non-leather shoes, one may not wear shoes of any material on Yom Kippur if it is a kind of shoe that people would wear year-round to walk on rocky and rough terrain.",
                    "A generation ago, when it was still uncommon to find high-quality shoes made from other materials, some <i>poskim</i> permitted walking in comfortable shoes as long as they were not made from leather or synthetic leather. However, with the passage of time, excellent non-leather shoes are becoming more and more readily available, so the numbers of those who permit wearing such shoes on Yom Kippur are decreasing.",
                    "Therefore, one may not wear non-leather shoes on Yom Kippur if they are worn year-round on rocky or rough terrain, regardless of what material they are made from. Thus, footwear such as “Crocs,” “Keds,” and “All-stars” may not be worn on Yom Kippur. One may wear cloth slippers or basic rubber shoes, however, since they are not normally worn on rough terrain. Nevertheless, since some <i>poskim</i> are still permissive and permit non-leather shoes, one should not object if someone else relies on them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yoma</i> 78b states that several Amora’im permit walking in cork shoes and the like. Following these statements, a <i>mishna</i> is cited which considers a wooden leg to be a shoe. The Gemara explains that a wooden shoe is prohibited, while a cork shoe and the like is permitted. This is the position of Rashi, <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Itur</i>, and Rabbeinu Yeruḥam. The rationale is that wooden shoes are strong and protect the feet, whereas cork shoes and the like do not properly protect the feet. Therefore, they are not considered shoes. Rambam writes something similar when speaking about cork and rubber shoes: “For his feet sense the hardness of the ground, and he feels like he is barefoot” (MT, Laws of Resting on the Tenth 3:7). Several Aḥaronim adopt this opinion, including <i>Panim Me’irot</i> 2:28, Ḥida, and Vilna Gaon, who all state that one may not wear shoes if they keep him from sensing the hardness of the ground. (Ba’al Ha-Ma’or, though, maintains that there is no difference between cork shoes and wooden shoes. The only thing he permits is wrapping cloth around the feet.) In contrast, Ramban writes that only a shoe made of leather is considered a shoe, following the opinion of R. Yoḥanan ben Nuri (<i>Shabbat</i> 66a). A shoe made of any other material is not deemed a shoe, and thus may be worn on Yom Kippur. This is the position of Rosh, Rashba, Ritva, and Me’iri, and this is how they understand the Rif. This is also the ruling in SA 614:2. Most Aḥaronim (including <i>Zera Emet</i> and <i>Responsa Maharshag</i>) follow SA. Indeed, this was the common ruling. MB 614:5 states that although most <i>poskim</i> agree that a non-leather shoe is considered simply an item of clothing and may be worn, and those who are lenient should therefore not be rebuked, nevertheless, since some <i>poskim</i> are stringent about any shoe that protects the foot well, those who can should be stringent and simply wear thick socks or slippers, as was common practice. Most contemporary <i>poskim</i> agree that while it is permitted to wear non-leather shoes, it is proper to be stringent and avoid wearing them if they are comfortable and protect the wearer from feeling the roughness of the ground. This is the view of <i>Halikhot Shlomo</i> 5:16-17 and R. Eliyahu in <i>Hilkhot Ḥagim</i> 45:38-39. <i>Ḥazon Ovadia</i>, p. 313, is lenient even <i>le-khatḥila</i>.<br>It seems clear, however, that those who were lenient in the past assumed that no material could compete with leather in terms of durability, strength, and flexibility. All the substitutes were either cloth used as slippers or extremely low-quality shoes that only the poor would wear sometimes, as the poor usually went barefoot. They would wrap their feet for protection only if they had injured a foot or if they had to traverse particularly rough terrain. It is this type of “shoe” that the Amora’im and Rishonim argued about. Those who were stringent forbade wearing these shoes since they did offer a degree of protection. Those who were lenient permitted them because they were not comfortable to walk in and people did not generally do so. For example, Ritva on <i>Shabbat</i> 66a writes explicitly that he permitted wooden shoes because they were not normally worn. Ran, too, (<i>Yoma</i> 2b) offers this as the reason for the lenient position. Other Rishonim state that any shoe worn throughout the year may not be worn on Yom Kippur (<i>Yere’im</i> §420; <i>Tosafot</i>,<i> Yevamot</i> 103a, s.v. “be-anpilya”). Maharshag writes that we rule leniently when it comes to non-leather shoes, because quality shoes that people regularly wear are usually made of leather. Therefore, even in the rare case of good shoes that are made of another material, they may be worn (<i>Responsa Maharshag</i> 2:110). However, now that shoes are made from a variety of materials, Maharshag, too, would be stringent.<br>To summarize, it seems to me that there would be no disagreement among the Rishonim about shoes nowadays; all would agree that if the shoes are good quality and worn year-round, they may not be worn on Yom Kippur. Indeed, this is the ruling of R. Ariel (<i>Ohala Shel Torah</i> 2:81) and R. Elyashiv<i> </i>(cited in <i>Hilkhot Ḥag Be-ḥag</i> 22:25). It seems that as time goes on and people get more used to wearing shoes made from a variety of materials, more <i>poskim</i> are stringent and consider all of them as shoes. The law as it applies to flip-flops, Crocs, and the like is a bit unclear. On the one hand, many people do wear them in the street. However, it seems that the criterion to determine whether they are prohibited is whether people wear them on rough terrain. If almost no one wears them in such areas, they may be worn on Yom Kippur. (True, according to <i>Baḥ</i> one must walk barefoot, but we do not take his opinion into account.)<br>Perhaps we can justify the position of those who are lenient and wear good non-leather shoes. They may be following the view of the Rishonim who maintain that the prohibition on wearing shoes is a rabbinic enactment limited to leather. So even if nowadays all would agree that a non-leather shoe is good and sturdy, it does not become prohibited, as we do not make new enactments. Additionally, shoes made of leather are still considered to be of a higher quality than those made of any other material. Finally, Arizal offers a kabbalistic explanation for the prohibition, related to the “garments of leather” that God gave to Adam and Ḥava to appease their animal souls (<i>Pri Etz Ḥayim</i>, <i>Sha’ar Yom Ha-kippurim</i>, ch. 4). This rationale would not apply to non-leather shoes. Nevertheless, it seems to me that there is no room for leniency, and the prohibition applies to all shoes worn outside on rough terrain, whether or not they are leather.</i>"

Furthermore, orthotics are not part of the shoe, so wearing them is like standing on a leather pillow, which is permissible (Rema 614:2; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 9). SSK 39:37 and <i>Nishmat Avraham</i> 614:4 rule this way as well. In contrast, <i>Ḥut Ha-shani</i> (p. 137) is uncertain: perhaps orthotics should be considered part of the shoe. Nevertheless, he permits them for those who would otherwise be unable to walk. In practice, those who suffer greatly without orthotics may wear leather inserts.

Healthy children start fasting part of the day at the age of nine, and weaker ones start at ten. By the age of eleven, all healthy children are encouraged to fast a full day. Only children who are sickly should wait to fast until their Torah obligation sets in. (This second position follows a different understanding of R. Naḥman.)<br>Others follow R. Yoḥanan, who maintains that we never train minors to fast a whole day. Only when their Torah obligation sets in do they fast a full day. Training to fast part of the day begins two years before halakhic adulthood. This is the position of R.

The Sanctuary (<i>heikhal</i>) was comprised of an entrance hall (<i>ulam</i>) and two chambers. The outer chamber, called the Holy (<i>Kodesh</i>), contained the <i>menora </i>(candelabrum), symbolizing wisdom; the <i>shulḥan </i>(table), symbolizing material sustenance and wealth; and the <i>mizbaḥ ha-ketoret </i>(incense altar), symbolizing prayer and the yearning to be close to God. The inner chamber, called the Holy of Holies (<i>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</i>), is where the basis of faith and Torah are revealed. In other words, it is there that the divine foundation of the Torah and the holiness of the congregation of Israel illuminate, and through their light, God animates the entire world. For this reason, the <i>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</i> housed the Ark of the Covenant, which contained the stone tablets (<i>luḥot</i>) that Moshe received at Mount Sinai and the Torah scroll he wrote. Atop the Ark was the <i>kaporet</i> (golden cover), with two cherubs rising from it, symbolizing the covenantal relationship and love between God and Israel. The location of the <i>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</i> within Jerusalem was atop the Foundation Stone (<i>Even Ha-shetiya</i>), which, our Sages tell us, was the rock from which the world was created (<i>Yoma</i> 54b). A <i>parokhet</i> (curtain) separated the <i>Kodesh</i> from the <i>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</i>, to demarcate different levels of holiness. For the sanctity of the <i>Kodesh</i> derives from that of the <i>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</i>.

(See above, 2:8 n. 4; 7:12; 6:4.) God’s governance of the world through justice is expressed in the laws of reward and punishment He embedded in the world, under which both the natural and spiritual worlds operate. Just as one who neglects to work becomes poor, so too, individuals and communities that choose evil are punished in this world and the next. According to these laws, it seems, at first glance, that human beings are irredeemable, since as a rule they tend to follow the evil urge. Even if there are righteous people, power is generally concentrated in the hands of those who crave power and money, following their evil impulses. It seems that there is no way to redeem the world from suffering. Death, which destroys every living being, will ultimately destroy the world as well.",

Goodness will ultimately come even from the evil intentions and actions of despots and other wicked people. This form of governance exists by virtue of Israel, who are bound to God in an eternal covenant, and whose innermost desire is always to improve the world. It is thanks to this mode of divine governance that redemption is assured, as stated in the Torah and the Prophets. However, this <i>hanhaga </i>is hidden and can work only through the <i>hanhaga </i>of justice. Accordingly, <i>how</i> redemption will take place depends on the choices made by Israel. If they choose goodness, redemption will come quickly and painlessly; if they choose evil (God forbid), redemption will be delayed and accompanied by terrible suffering.",

This is the reason one may not enter there. Moreover, an attempt to enter it without permission is fraught with risk, because one who connects with this exalted level is prone to thinking that since all is anyway for the best, it is unnecessary to choose good and overcome the evil impulse. In the dazzling light of the <i>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</i>, one may find justification for pursuing his impulses, claiming that everything is for the best and for the sake of heaven.",

However, this is an incomprehensible secret, which is revealed gradually, over the course of time. Therefore, only on the holy and awe-filled day of Yom Kippur, when the Jews abstain from <i>melakha</i> and detach from everything related to this world – eating, drinking, washing, applying cream, wearing shoes, and engaging in marital relations – was the Kohen Gadol able to reach such a lofty level that he could enter the <i>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</i> on behalf of the nation. From there, he was able to draw down purity and atonement for any impurities that may have contaminated the Jewish people superficially.

Finally, in 7:12 above we use these concepts to shed light on the Yom Kippur custom of reciting “<i>Barukh shem kevod</i>” out loud.<br>Ramḥal describes the <i>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</i> as “the place of the powerful light and the tremendous blessing.” Its measurements “extend from the beginning to the end and from the end to the beginning, with twenty [<i>amot</i>] in each direction, so the dimensions of this chamber were twenty by twenty. When we add twenty and twenty, we get forty, which hints at the minimum amount of water required for a <i>mikveh </i>– forty <i>se’ah</i>” (<i>Mishkenei Elyon</i>, ch. 3). In other words, the <i>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</i> purified the Jews like a <i>mikveh</i>. Compare R. Akiva’s exposition in the Mishna, “Happy are you, Israel – for before Whom do you purify yourselves and Who purifies you? Your Father in heaven, as we read…‘God is the hope (<i>mikveh</i>) of Israel’ (Yirmiyahu 17:13). Just as a <i>mikveh</i> purifies the impure, so too, God purifies Israel” (<i>Yoma</i> 85b). Even though we no longer have the Temple, the intrinsic power of Yom Kippur is comparable to the <i>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</i>, while the fasting and praying are comparable to the <i>Kodesh</i>.</i>"

He shall not go in where there is any dead body; he shall not defile himself even for his father or mother.

To emphasize his devotion to God, the words “Holy to God” were engraved on the <i>tzitz</i>. To express the Kohen Gadol’s feelings of love and responsibility for <i>klal Yisrael</i>, the names of the patriarchs and tribes of Israel were engraved on the stones of the <i>ḥoshen</i>, which he wore over his heart. The shoulder straps of his <i>ephod </i>also featured two precious stones on which were engraved the names of the tribes (MT, Laws of the Temple’s Vessels and Its Workers 9:1, 7-9). Additionally, the Kohen Gadol had to be superior to others in strength, wisdom, beauty, and wealth. If he possessed all of these except for wealth, his fellow <i>kohanim</i> would give him money, so that he would possess all these attributes (<i>Yoma</i> 18a).",
                    "If a Kohen Gadol was appointed who was neither pious nor virtuous, <i>be-di’avad</i> the appointment was valid, and the laws pertaining to the Kohen Gadol applied to him. However, it should be obvious that the more righteous the Kohen Gadol was, the more successful he would be in his work to draw Israel closer to their heavenly Father.",
                    "The Sages tell us that during the 410 years of the First Temple, eighteen Kohanim Gedolim served. Most of them were righteous, and accordingly were blessed with longevity. In contrast, during the 420 years of the Second Temple, there were over three hundred Kohanim Gedolim. Three of them were righteous and served for extended periods. Almost all the rest were not righteous. They bought their positions from the ruling powers, and their lives were cut short.

This category also included the offering of the incense (which was done on the incense altar twice daily, morning and afternoon), as well as preparing and lighting the <i>menora</i>.

This is despite the Kohen Gadol’s obligation to separate from his wife for a week before Yom Kippur, to purify and sanctify himself in preparation for the <i>avoda</i>. The reason he was required to be married is that someone who is not married is considered incomplete (<i>Yevamot</i> 63a), lacking joy, blessing, goodness, Torah, protection, and peace (<i>ibid</i>. 62b). The Kohen Gadol had to have one wife only; if he had two wives, he was disqualified from serving (<i>Yoma</i> 13a). For only within a monogamous relationship can ideal unity and love be achieved.

As detailed in Shemot, chapter 28, they were: the <i>ketonet</i>, <i>mikhnasayim</i>, <i>mitznefet</i>, <i>avnet</i>, <i>ḥoshen</i>, <i>ephod</i>, <i>me’il</i>, and <i>tzitz</i>. The <i>ketonet</i>, <i>mikhnasayim</i>, and <i>mitznefet</i> were white, while the other vestments were various colors, some also threaded with gold.

The bells on the <i>me’il</i> were made of gold, as were the <i>tzitz</i>, the straps and rings of the <i>ḥoshen</i>, and the <i>ephod</i>. The settings of the stones on the <i>ḥoshen</i> were also made of gold. Thus, the Kohen Gadol’s vestments were rich in color, expressing the spread of sanctity in this very diverse world. Each vestment represented a specific idea and atoned for a corresponding sin (section 3 above). Therefore, if the Kohen Gadol was not wearing every single one of these items, his <i>avoda</i> was compromised and therefore invalid.",
                    "In contrast, for the part of the Yom Kippur <i>avoda</i> performed in the <i>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</i>, he wore only his four white linen vestments, as we read, “Thus only shall Aharon enter the holy place…. He shall be dressed in a sacral linen tunic, with linen breeches next to his flesh, and be girt with a linen sash, and he shall wear a linen miter. They are sacral vestments” (Vayikra 16:3-4). If he performed this <i>avoda</i> while wearing his golden vestments, the <i>avoda</i> was invalid. For the special <i>avoda</i> of Yom Kippur, the Kohen Gadol had to raise himself entirely beyond this-worldly concerns. Even though every aspect of this world has positives, alongside these positives are negatives and sins. To atone for them, he had to raise himself to the level of simple unity, beyond the world’s diversity. This unity is symbolized by the color white (Maharal, <i>Gevurot Hashem</i>, ch. 51, and <i>Netivot Olam</i>, <i>Netiv Ha-Torah</i> ch. 10).",
                    "There is another reason why the Kohen Gadol changed out of his golden vestments before entering the <i>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</i>. “Why doesn’t the Kohen Gadol enter the <i>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</i> on Yom Kippur while wearing his golden vestments? Because the prosecutor cannot become the defender” (Rosh Ha-shana 26a). Gold is the most glorious of metals. This is the reason that Temple items were made of it – to reveal the glory of sanctity in this world. However, along with its glory, gold also leads people to chase after money and desires, as we see from the episode of the Golden Calf. The Sages tell us that it was the wealth and gold that Israel acquired when they left Egypt that led them to follow their evil inclination and look for a physical representation of the divine, which they then worshipped (<i>Berakhot</i> 32a). Therefore, when the Kohen Gadol entered the <i>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</i> to purge any impurity from Israel’s faith, he needed to remove his golden vestments and wear his white vestments instead."

The Sages further require that he immerse his entire body (in accordance with R. Yehuda in <i>Yoma</i> 30a; MT, Laws of the Yom Kippur Service 2:3). He need not wash or immerse again as long as he serves continuously. If he urinates, he must wash his hands and feet again. If he defecates or leaves the Temple environs for a significant amount of time, he must immerse his body and wash his hands and feet again (MT, Laws of Entering the Temple 5:3-5).",
                    "For immersing, there was a <i>mikveh</i> adjacent to the Temple courtyard (<i>azara</i>), and for washing the hands and feet water was used that came out of the faucets affixed to the <i>kiyor </i>(laver), located between the Sanctuary and the outer altar. The <i>kohen</i> would place his right hand on top of his right foot and wash them together, and then place his left hand atop his left foot and wash them together. A <i>kohen</i> who served in the Temple without first washing his hands and feet was liable to punishment by death at the hands of heaven, as we read:<br>Make a laver of copper and a stand of copper for it, for washing; and place it between the <i>Ohel Mo’ed</i> (Tent of Encounter) and the altar. Put water in it and let Aharon and his sons wash their hands and feet from it. When they enter the <i>Ohel Mo’ed</i> they shall wash with water, that they may not die; or when they approach the altar to serve, to turn into smoke an offering by fire to the Lord… (Shemot 30:18-20)",

He shall bathe his body in water in the holy precinct and put on his vestments…” (<i>ibid</i>. 23-24).",

Thus, the Kohen Gadol immersed five times and washed his hands and feet ten times on Yom Kippur (<i>Yoma</i> 32a). During the year, he used the laver like the rest of the <i>kohanim</i>. On Yom Kippur, in his honor, the water was brought to him, in a golden ewer, so that he would not have to return repeatedly to the laver (<i>Yoma</i> 43b).",
                    "The idea behind immersing is to become pure and to extricate oneself from an existing state to rise to a new, more elevated state. The white vestments were of a higher rank in that they could bring one to a higher, more abstract plane, and the golden vestments were higher in that they revealed sanctity within the full variety of this world. In order to transition to new, higher states, as expressed in the changing of clothes, the Kohen Gadol had to immerse.",

The ten fingers hint at this as well. They correspond to the ten statements with which God created the world (<i>Avot </i>5:1). Human beings, created in the divine image, use their ten fingers to repair and improve the world.",

An intense divine light courses through him, protecting him from the amplified desires which might lead him astray. But when he finishes the work, those same desires may snare him. To protect him from them, the Kohen Gadol was commanded to wash his hands and feet before removing the garments. This allowed him to seal in all his energies with holiness, which he tapped into during the <i>avoda</i>. The second time he sanctified his hands and feet was after he put on the new garments. This was to purify all his energies prior to undertaking the next element of the <i>avoda</i>, and to ensure that they were not still preoccupied with his previous <i>avoda</i> (based on <i>Orot Ha-teshuva</i> 14:33)."

The eleventh ingredient was galbanum, which smells bad, corresponding to the negative aspects of the world. However, once the galbanum was ground up and mixed with the other ingredients, not only did it not ruin the incense – it actually improved its fragrance. This teaches us that when all the energies of Israel are united in the service of holiness, the inner positives of Israel’s sinners are revealed; they join with the rest and help repair the world.

Thus, we read, “The cloud covered the mountain. The Glory of the Lord dwelt on Mount Sinai, and the cloud hid it for six days. On the seventh day, He called to Moshe from the midst of the cloud” (Shemot 24:15-16). The cloud connotes an exalted and sublime divine revelation, beyond human comprehension. Yet through the fog and cloud, one can reach an understanding of the divine, albeit only partially, in accordance with his capabilities. Thus, we read that after the <i>Mishkan</i> was completed, “The cloud covered the <i>Ohel Mo’ed</i> and the Presence of the Lord filled the <i>Mishkan</i>. Moshe could not enter the <i>Ohel Mo’ed</i>, because the cloud had settled upon it and the Presence of the Lord filled the <i>Mishkan</i>” (Shemot 40:34-35). Similarly, when the First Temple was dedicated, we read, “The <i>kohanim</i> brought the Ark of the Lord’s Covenant to its place underneath the wings of the <i>keruvim</i>, in the Shrine of the House, in the <i>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</i>…. When the <i>kohanim</i> came out of the <i>Kodesh</i>, the cloud had filled the House of the Lord, and the <i>kohanim</i> were unable to stand and serve because of the cloud, for the Presence of the Lord filled the House of the Lord” (1 Melakhim 8:6, 11). First was a sublime, exalted revelation that no human being could endure, and only afterward, from within the cloud and fog, would the divine idea become revealed gradually, according to the abilities of the <i>kohanim</i>.",

He shall put the incense on the fire before the Lord, so that the cloud from the incense screens the <i>kaporet</i> that is over [the Ark of] the Covenant, lest he die” (Vayikra 16:12-13).

It did not atone for someone who later became aware of his impurity; that was achieved by the goat offered as a sin offering on the outside altar on Yom Kippur.

This was atoned for by the bull and goat whose blood was sprinkled in the <i>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</i>. The bull atoned for the <i>kohanim</i>, while the goat atoned for the rest of Israel.",

All the sins in the Torah can be forgiven with one goat (which is sent to Azazel), while the impurity of the Temple and its sacrifices requires thirty-two goats (offered on Rosh Ḥodesh, festivals, and Yom Kippur) to atone for it. Furthermore, all the sins in the Torah are atoned for once a year (through the scapegoat), while the defilement of the Temple and its sacrifices is atoned for every month, as we read, “Assuredly, as I live – said the Lord God – because you defiled My Temple with all your detestable things and all your abominations, I in turn will shear [you] away and show no pity. I in turn will show no compassion” (Yeḥezkel 5:11). Abominable and repugnant sins were bad enough, but defiling the Temple and the sacrifices was worst of all. (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Shevu’ot</i> 1:3)",

For when a person’s faith is pure, free of any defect and imperfection, he clings to God’s attributes, and the life within him prevails. His every desire is directed toward increasing life and blessing to the world in accordance with the Torah’s guidance; his evil impulse cannot overcome him. However, when his faith is defective, there is a gap between his desires and faith, corresponding to its defects. He imagines that in order to enjoy life he must act against the Torah’s guidance; his evil impulse overpowers him, causing him to sin.",
                    "One might say that erroneous ideas about faith are akin to entering the Temple while impure. Thinking about faith is like entering sacred precincts, and when one’s understanding of faith is flawed and defective, whether because he did not study Torah properly or because of bad character, he is entering the Temple of faith while impure. If he then acts upon his mistaken beliefs, he is like someone who eats from the sacrificial meat while impure.",

Sometimes, one is not aware of the contradictions and defects in his faith, but after he has acted upon them, he knows that he has not yet properly clarified his faith. He needs a more serious atonement, which is provided by the sin offering of the goat on the outer altar on Yom Kippur.",

If, despite one’s awareness that his faith lacks the proper clarity, he continues in his habits, without trying to understand Torah more deeply, to improve his character traits, and to clarify his beliefs, he is like an impure person who enters the Temple knowingly. If he continues on his familiar path, based on his defective faith, without engaging in soul-searching, he is like someone impure who eats from the sacrificial meat knowingly. This is the most terrible sin, because it leads to the destruction of his spiritual world. A divine light suddenly illuminated his soul, for a moment he entered the Temple within his soul, but instead of taking this opportunity to purify himself, clarify his faith, and redirect his life, he chose to remain impure and to continue with his routine. Therefore, only the sprinkling of the blood of the bull and the goat in the <i>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</i>, together with repentance, can atone for him."

One and seven’” (m. <i>Yoma</i> 5:4). The first sprinkling was upward, to connect with the singular root of faith, the eternal covenant between God and Israel. The other seven sprinklings were downward, to draw down the power of faith and the covenant, thus enabling it to infuse the seven facets of the world, which was created in seven days – so that faith and the covenant, which are the root of redemption, can manifest in the world pleasantly and peacefully, without suffering. The Kohen Gadol always repeated the initial count of one sprinkling upward before each of the seven sprinklings downward, because all seven facets of the world must be connected to the heavenly root of faith, from which they stem.",

If we choose good, goodness and blessing will abound; if we choose evil, good will be minimized while suffering is maximized.

The Sages explain that the two goats are introduced together to teach that they must be of identical appearance, size, and worth (<i>Shevu’ot</i> 13b).

                    "The Kohen Gadol again approached the bull designated as his sin offering, leaned on it, and confessed the sins of the rest of the <i>kohanim</i>. He then slaughtered the bull so he could sprinkle its blood in the <i>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</i>.

                    "There are two reasons why goats specifically were used for atonement. First, from an interior perspective, goat blood resembles human blood more than that of any other animals. This finds expression in the exceptional vitality of he-goats, and the sprinkling of their blood in the <i>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</i> expresses Israel’s yearning to cling to God devotedly. Second, from an external perspective, goats tend to be wild and destructive. The angel of destructive forces and the guardian angel of the wicked Esav are called “<i>se’ir</i>” – goat – because their specialty is destruction and mayhem. When idolaters wanted to save themselves from destruction or wreak destruction on their enemies, they offered sacrifices to goat-like deities, gods of evil and destruction. Therefore, the Torah warns Israel that they must offer their sacrifices to God alone: “They may offer their sacrifices no more to the goat-demons after whom they stray” (Vayikra 17:7; Ramban on 16:8).",
                    "On the holy and awesome day of Yom Kippur, when the eternal covenant between God and Israel is revealed, and Israel elevate themselves by fasting and refraining from all bodily desires, the Kohen Gadol could enter the <i>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</i> in the name of all Israel and sprinkle the blood of a goat before God, thus expressing the inner desire of all Israel to cleave devotedly to God, His Torah, and His <i>mitzvot</i>. Israel were thereby purified from the defilement of the Temple and its sacrifices. As a result, the <i>kelipot </i>(“husks”) that prevent the light of faith from illuminating their souls were removed. Good and evil, which had been intermingled within them, were now distinct. It became clear that all the sins they had committed were external to them, the result of evil influences that misled them to believe that they would gain by sinning. In truth, these sins wasted their energies, while providing them with no benefit at all. Once evil is separated from good, it loses its power and can no longer lead people astray. For it is only when evil is intermingled with good and life that it can destroy and devastate; when evil is isolated, it returns to its desolate place and fades away. This was expressed in the sending of the scapegoat with Israel’s sins to Azazel in the desert, a desolate and isolated place.",
                    "Another profound idea is expressed through the scapegoat sent to Azazel: It was a gift that God commanded us to send on Yom Kippur to Samael, the angel of destruction and mayhem, who dwells in the desert, a place of desolation and devastation. To make it clear that this was not an act of worship, the Torah emphasizes: “The goat designated by lot for Azazel shall be left standing alive before the Lord, to make atonement with it and to send it off to the wilderness for Azazel” (Vayikra 16:10). We see that the goat stood “before the Lord,” and it was God Who commanded us to send it away in order to atone for Israel. In the formulation of the Midrash:<br>Samael said to the Holy One: “Master of all worlds, You gave me power over all the nations of the world, but not over Israel?!” God responded, “You have power over them on Yom Kippur if they have any sin; but if they do not, you have no power over them.” Therefore, we bribe [Samael] on Yom Kippur so that he will not prevent Israel from offering their sacrifice. (<i>Pirkei De-Rabbi Eliezer</i> 46)",
                    "Let us delve deeper into this. All year long we struggle with the evil impulse, but on Yom Kippur, when the Kohen Gadol enters the <i>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</i> to bind all Israel to the root of faith, it becomes possible for Israel to consider the entire world from a broad, complete perspective. We can see that the forces of evil are also created by God and have a function; it is because of them that human beings have free will, so it is due to them that people can grow, attain higher levels, and give expression to the image of the divine within them. Nevertheless, these thoughts about the positive value of evil can end up being destructive. People can fool themselves into thinking that when they sin, they are really doing something good. Therefore, only on Yom Kippur, when we deprive ourselves and refrain from all bodily pleasures, did God command us to send a goat to Azazel. Only on Yom Kippur can we show Samael that we understand his importance without being tempted by him. At that moment, Samael is gratified that Israel finally understands him. For the rest of the day, he no longer wants to tempt and accuse us, for he really wants Israel to choose good. He even joins in the effort of defending us.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">102</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>midrash</i> goes on to describe Samael’s defense of the Jews:<br>Samael saw that they were without sin on Yom Kippur. He said to God: “Master of all worlds, You have one nation that is like the ministering angels in heaven. Just as the ministering angels do not eat or drink, so too, the Jews do not eat or drink on Yom Kippur. Just as the ministering angels go barefoot, so too, the Jews go barefoot on Yom Kippur…. Just as peace reigns among the ministering angels, so too, peace reigns among the Jews on Yom Kippur. Just as the ministering angels are free of all sin, so too, the Jews are free of all sin on Yom Kippur.” God hears the prosecutor petitioning on Israel’s behalf, and he forgives them… (<i>Pirkei De-Rabbi Eliezer</i> 46)<br>Maharal, at the end of his homily for <i>Shabbat Shuva</i>, emphasizes an interpretation of evil that views it as absence and lack, as I write in my first explanation in the main text. So states <i>Sefer Ha-hinukh</i> §95 as well. Ramban’s commentary to Vayikra 16:8 follows <i>Pirkei De-Rabbi Eliezer</i> in emphasizing the bribery theme.<br>R. Levi in the Talmud also understands the accuser in a positive light: “The accuser and Penina both had good intentions. When the accuser saw that God was inclined to favor Iyov, he objected: ‘God forbid that He should forget His love for Avraham and Israel!’ (This is why the accuser argued that Iyov was not as perfect as Avraham.) Penina, as it is written (1 Shmuel 1:6), ‘her rival would taunt her to make her miserable” (i.e., Penina taunted Ḥanna so she would pray to God). R. Aḥa taught this idea in Epiphania, and the accuser came and kissed his feet (<i>Bava Batra</i> 16a) – in gratitude for explaining his good intentions.<br>Nevertheless, the plain meaning of the <i>midrash </i>is that the scapegoat is a bribe in the ordinary sense of the word. Since the forces of evil follow the path of falsehood, trickery, and flattery, we give them a taste of their own medicine with the scapegoat, and they forget their accusations and enjoy the bribe. Thus, we read in the <i>Zohar</i> on Aḥarei Mot, “When the goat reached the mountain [in the wilderness], how happy [the evil forces were]. They were all intoxicated and became sweet-tempered from it, and the accuser who went to prosecute Israel reversed himself and praised them instead. The prosecutor became a defender” (<i>Zohar</i> III 63a). However, this, too, can be understood in a deeper way: The evil forces are elevated to a higher level and remove their masks, showing that they, too, want what is best for the world. Since they are permitted to take a day off from their evil mission, they are happy to come to the defense of Israel.<br>Perhaps both interpretations of this <i>midrash </i>are correct, each applying to a different scenario. If Israel repent out of fear, then the scapegoat served as a bribe in the plain sense, but if they repent out of love, then just as knowing sins are transformed into merits, so too, the forces of evil are turned into good. This idea may be implied by <i>Zohar</i>, <i>Ra’aya Mehemna</i> on Aḥarei Mot (III 63a-b), which declares that the evil inclination is “very good” (Bereishit 1:31). However, the <i>Zohar</i> goes on to say that the accuser continues to fulfill his role on Yom Kippur, but since all of Israel’s sins were cast to Azazel, the accuser finds Israel free of sin, and he thus comes to their defense. This leads to the cancellation of harsh judgments against the Jews. An additional passage from <i>Zohar</i> (II 184b-185a, on Tetzaveh) compares the scapegoat to a banquet given to an accuser so that he does not disturb the king’s joy in spending time with his son. This banquet is also a sort of bribe, as it blinds the accuser. His accusations rebound on him and his wicked legions. The <i>midrash </i>is thus correct on both levels. As long as the world has not reached ultimate perfection, the inner goodness of evil – the essence of repentance out of love – remains secret. What is recognizable is repentance out of fear. On that level, the scapegoat served as a bribe, tricking the accuser into defending Israel against his will.<br>Since the person who took the scapegoat to the wilderness encountered the forces of evil, he had to purify himself afterward, as we read, “He who set the Azazel-goat free shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water; after that he may re-enter the camp” (Vayikra 16:28). <i>Zohar</i> on Aḥarei Mot states that the person chosen for this job was especially capable of dealing with the forces of evil (<i>Zohar</i> III 63b), which would explain why he had to purify himself afterward. Even if we contend that the positive aspect of evil was revealed at that moment, as long as the world has not reached ultimate perfection, this is a dangerous secret. Therefore, the man who carried the scapegoat still had to immerse before returning to the camp. See further on this in the book by my friend R. Moshe Odess, <i>Ve-hashev et Ha-avoda</i>, ch. 5. In chapters 2 and 3 he presents a comprehensive overview of the Yom Kippur <i>avoda</i> and explains that the functions of the bull, the goat, and the incense are intertwined. Each stage is a prerequisite for the next one. I have incorporated his important explanations into this chapter.</i>"

In addition, throughout the night, people would sing prayers and praises to God before the Kohen Gadol. If he started falling asleep, young <i>kohanim</i> would snap their fingers to wake him up. If that did not work, they would suggest that he stand (barefoot) on the cold floor. If that did not work either, they would suggest that he do <i>kida</i> – that is, bow so deeply that his head touched the ground while he remained standing on his feet (<i>Yoma</i> 19b; above, 7:14).",

As on every other day, the first offering was the morning <i>tamid</i>, and the last was the afternoon <i>tamid</i>. When dawn broke and the time came to offer the <i>tamid</i>, the Kohen Gadol stripped off his weekday clothing and immersed in preparation for the day, then donned the gold vestments and washed his hands and feet. He slaughtered the <i>tamid</i>, received its blood, and sprinkled it on the altar, like on any other day. He then entered the Sanctuary to offer incense on the golden altar. He then cleaned and prepared the <i>menora</i> for lighting. He went back out to the copper altar and placed the limbs of the <i>tamid </i>in the fire.

The Gemara explains, “This is how the divine attribute of <i>din</i> (judgment)<i> </i>works: Better for someone innocent to come and atone for someone guilty than for someone guilty to come and atone for someone else who is guilty” (<i>Shevu’ot</i> 14a). Therefore, the Kohen Gadol was commanded to first bring a bull as a sin offering and confess his sins and his wife’s sins over it, as we read, “Thus only shall Aharon enter the <i>Kodesh</i>: with a bull of the herd for a sin offering” (Vayikra 16:3). Unlike the other Yom Kippur offerings, which were bought with communal funds, the Kohen Gadol had to pay with his own money for the bull of the sin offering and the ram of the accompanying burnt offering. Thus, his personal atonement would be complete, as we read, “Aharon is to offer his own bull of sin offering, to atone for himself and for his household” (<i>ibid</i>. v. 6)."

                    "The Kohen Gadol positioned his bull between the Sanctuary’s entrance hall and the copper altar, with its head to the south and facing west toward the Sanctuary. The Kohen Gadol stood to the east of the bull, facing the Sanctuary, placed his two hands on the head of the bull and leaned on it. It was as if he was saying, “What should have been done to me, as punishment for my sins, will be done to this bull which I am bringing to atone for my sins.” Then he recited the first <i>vidui</i>.",
                    "The Kohen Gadol’s <i>vidui </i>on Yom Kippur was unique, as in it he would pronounce the Divine Name, which is normally prohibited. Some say that the name he pronounced was the Tetragrammaton (the four-letter name, <i>yud</i>-<i>heh</i>-<i>vav</i>-<i>heh</i>, as written in the Torah), while others maintain that it was the forty-two-letter name (R. Hai Gaon). Each of the three times the Kohen Gadol pronounced the name, the <i>kohanim</i> and the people standing in the courtyard would kneel, prostrate themselves, and proclaim, “<i>Barukh shem kevod malkhuto le-olam va-ed</i>.” This was a profound articulation of self-effacement and repentance. The formulation of the <i>vidui</i> was as follows:<br>Please, Lord, I have sinned, I have done wrong, I have rebelled before You – I and my family. Please, by Your name, grant atonement for the sins and for the wrongs and the rebellions that I have sinned, and done wrong, and rebelled before You – I and my family. As it is written in the Torah of Moshe Your servant, at the word of Your glory: “For on this day, you will be atoned for and made pure of all your sins before the Lord.”",
                    "Following his personal <i>vidui</i>, the Kohen Gadol could atone for all of Israel. First, he cast lots over the two goats: the one “for God” to atone for Israel’s sins against the sanctity of the Temple, and the other, “for Azazel,” to atone for all other sins. The Kohen Gadol declared the goat designated by lot to be for God as “a sin offering to the Lord” using the Tetragrammaton. Thereupon, the <i>kohanim</i> and the people standing in the courtyard would kneel, prostrate themselves, and proclaim, “<i>Barukh shem kevod malkhuto le-olam va-ed</i>.” He then tied a scarlet ribbon around the neck of this goat and another around the horns of scapegoat.",
                    "However, the Kohen Gadol still could not atone for Israel, because he had not yet atoned for his fellow <i>kohanim</i>, who were responsible for all sacred matters in Israel. To that end, he returned to his bull, leaned on it with both hands, and confessed on behalf of the <i>kohanim</i>. This was the formulation of the second <i>vidui</i>:<br>Please, Lord, I have sinned, I have done wrong, I have rebelled before You – I and my family and the children of Aharon, Your holy people. Please, by Your name, grant atonement for the sins and for the wrongs and the rebellions that I have sinned, and done wrong, and rebelled before You – I and my family and the children of Aharon, Your holy people. As it is written in the Torah of Moshe Your servant, at the word of Your glory: “For on this day, you will be atoned for and made pure of all your sins before the Lord.”",
                    "After confessing, the Kohen Gadol slaughtered the bull and collected its blood in a vessel, but he still could not enter the <i>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</i> to sprinkle it, because he had not yet offered the special incense of Yom Kippur, which expressed the covenantal bond between God and Israel. Yet he could not enter the <i>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</i> with the incense until he had confessed over the bull and slaughtered it. Now that he had done so, he could enter the <i>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</i> and perform both the incense offering and the sprinkling. The Kohen Gadol handed the vessel of blood to another <i>kohen</i> and entered the <i>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</i> to offer the incense, as the Torah describes:<br>He shall slaughter his bull of sin offering. And he shall take a panful of glowing coals scooped from the altar before the Lord, and two handfuls of finely ground aromatic incense, and bring this beyond the <i>parokhet</i> [into the <i>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</i>]. He shall put the incense on the fire before the Lord, so that the cloud from the incense screens the <i>kaporet</i> that is over [the Ark of] the Covenant, lest he die. (Vayikra 16:11-13)",
                    "After the smoke from the incense covered the <i>kaporet</i> (as explained above in sections 7-8), the Kohen Gadol left the <i>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</i> and briefly prayed in the Sanctuary. His prayer had to be brief, because had he stayed inside for too long, people would have panicked, thinking that he had died in the <i>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</i>.",
                    "The Kohen Gadol then took the vessel of bull’s blood and re-entered the <i>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</i>. He stood facing the two poles of the Ark and sprinkled the blood toward (but not on) the <i>kaporet</i> – once upward and seven times downward. As we read, “He shall take some of the blood of the bull and sprinkle it with his finger over the <i>kaporet</i> on the east side; and in front of the <i>kaporet</i> he shall sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times” (Vayikra 16:14). He would count the sprinklings out loud (as explained in section 11). Unfortunately, near the end of the First Temple period, the Ark was hidden away. From then on, and during the Second Temple period, the Kohen Gadol would sprinkle toward the <i>Even Ha-shetiya</i>.",
                    "Though he had not yet completed the sprinkling of the bull’s blood to atone for himself and his fellow <i>kohanim</i>, he put down the bowl of bull’s blood on a golden stand in the Sanctuary and left it in order to slaughter the goat for God on behalf of Israel. This interruption was necessary because atonement for the <i>kohanim</i> and atonement for Israel were integrated. The atonement of the <i>kohanim</i> was for the sake of Israel, so it was inconceivable to complete their atonement without combining it with the atonement of Israel."

As we read, “He shall then slaughter the people’s goat of sin offering, bring its blood beyond the <i>parokhet</i>, and do with its blood as he has done with the blood of the bull: he shall sprinkle it over the <i>kaporet</i> and in front of the <i>kaporet</i>. Thus he shall atone for the <i>Kodesh</i> from the impurity and transgression of the Israelites, whatever their sins” (Vayikra 16:15-16).",
                    "The Kohen Gadol then exited the <i>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</i>, placed the vessel of goat’s blood on a second stand, and picked up the vessel of bull’s blood. He sprinkled it toward the <i>parokhet</i> separating the <i>Kodesh</i> from the <i>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</i>, upward once and downward seven times. He then did the same with the goat’s blood.

                    "After that, the Kohen Gadol took the vessels and mixed the blood of the two animals together. He walked from the <i>parokhet</i> to the golden altar in the <i>Kodesh </i>and sprinkled blood on its four corners. He cleared away coal and ash from the altar until its golden color became visible, whereupon he sprinkled it with blood seven times. As we read:<br>He shall go out to the altar that is before the Lord and atone for it: he shall take some of the blood of the bull and of the goat and apply it to each of the horns of the altar; and the rest of the blood he shall sprinkle on it with his finger seven times. Thus he shall cleanse it of the impurity of the Israelites and consecrate it. (Vayikra 16:18-19)",
                    "He then went out to the copper altar and spilled what was left of the blood on the western side of its base. Having finished atoning for the defilement of the Temple and its sacrifices, the Kohen Gadol began the process of atoning for all other sins. He approached the scapegoat, placed both hands on it, and confessed in the name of all Israel, as we read:<br>When he has finished atoning for the <i>Kodesh</i>, the <i>Ohel Mo’ed</i>, and the altar, the live goat shall be brought forward. Aharon shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat and confess over it all the iniquities and transgressions of the Israelites, whatever their sins, putting them on the head of the goat.

Together with the prostration when the Kohen Gadol pronounced the Divine Name upon casting the lots, we reach a total of ten prostrations.",
                    "The Kohen Gadol then sent the scapegoat to the wilderness with a designated agent, as we read, “It shall be sent off to the wilderness through a designated man. Thus the goat shall carry on it all their iniquities to an inaccessible region; and the goat shall be cast away in the wilderness” (Vayikra 16:21-22). The man walked to a mountain that was approximately twelve <i>mil</i> (about 11 km) into the wilderness. He then divided the ribbon that was tied to the goat’s horns in two, leaving one part on the goat’s horns and tying the other part to a rock. He cast the goat off the cliff; before it got halfway down the mountainside, it was already dashed to pieces (<i>Yoma</i> 67a)."

Later he would offer them on the outer altar, together with the other offerings of the day.

When he was informed that the scapegoat had arrived at its destination in the desert, he began reading aloud from a Torah scroll. He read the three sections of the Torah which relate to Yom Kippur: 1) The description of the Kohen Gadol’s <i>avoda</i> on Yom Kippur, in <i>Parashat Aḥarei Mot</i> (Vayikra 16); 2) the section beginning “On the tenth” that deals with the <i>mitzvot</i> of Yom Kippur, in <i>Parashat Emor</i> (Vayikra 23); 3) the section dealing with the <i>musafim </i>of Yom Kippur in <i>Parashat Pinḥas</i> (Bamidbar 29).

He did not remove them immediately after sprinkling the blood in the <i>Kodesh Ha-kodashim</i>, because the incense expressed the covenantal bond between God and Israel, so it was necessary for its smoke to continue ascending throughout the Yom Kippur <i>avoda</i>.

According to the Gemara, the <i>ḥazan</i> must be careful and precise in his recitation, to ensure that it conforms with the views that are accepted as <i>halakha </i>(<i>Yoma</i> 36b and 56b), for the recitation of the order of the sacrifices is considered a substitute for actually offering them.",
                    "The Sages tell us, “Whoever engages in the study of the sin offering – it is as if he offered one; whoever engages in the study of the guilt offering – it is as if he offered one” (<i>Menaḥot</i> 110a). The Sages also tell us that when our patriarch Avraham learned that Israel continues to exist by virtue of the sacrificial offerings, which keep them bound to God, he asked, “What will happen if the Temple is destroyed?” God responded, “I have already established the sacrificial procedures for them; whenever they recite them, I will consider it as though they are sacrificing to Me, and I will forgive all their sins” (<i>Ta’anit</i> 27b; <i>Megilla</i> 31b). The idea is that every action has a soul, and the soul of each mitzva is what the Torah says about it. Therefore, when it is impossible to offer the sacrifices, if we recite the Torah’s words pertaining to them, it is, in a certain sense, as if we have offered them. This is especially true when we do so publicly, at the time when they would have been offered. The more we understand the halakhic and philosophical meaning of a sacrifice, the greater the value of our recitation.",

The prayers and intentions of all worshippers will be combined with the <i>avoda </i>of the Kohen Gadol in the Temple. Those <i>kohanim</i> and people fortunate enough to secure a place to stand in the Temple courtyard will represent all Israel as they witness the <i>avoda</i> with their own eyes. These observers will not need to recite the prayers, because they will be participants in the <i>avoda</i> itself – for they, too, take part in the mitzva.
