        "Introduction": [
            "<b>1</b> I am grateful to God for helping me complete this book on Sukkot, thus completing the unit of Shabbat and the Pilgrimage Festivals (<i>Mo’adim</i>). This follows <i>Peninei Halakha: Zemanim</i> on Rosh Ḥodesh and the Rabbinic holidays. All that remains is to complete a book on the <i>Yamim Nora’im</i>, the Days of Awe, and all the holidays will be covered. Originally, I thought I would deal with all the Tishrei holidays in one volume. However, when it became clear that I would not finish the <i>Yamim Nora’im</i> material this year (2013), I made particular efforts to at least publish a book on Sukkot. I hope that with the approach of next Rosh Ha-shana, I will have the privilege of publishing the <i>Yamim Nora’im</i> volume. Having an entire book devoted to them should allow me to discuss the laws of repentance in depth, covering both principles and details.",
            "In the current book, I have written at some length about the laws pertaining to Temple commemorations. This is particularly fitting for Sukkot, as it is replete with such commemorations. They include taking the <i>lulav</i> beyond the first day of the festival (5:1), holding a <i>Simhat Beit Ha-sho’eva</i> (1:10-12), circling the <i>bima</i> with the <i>lulav</i> (5:9-10), and beating the <i>aravot</i> on Hoshana Rabba (6:2-3). Continuing this theme, I included a chapter on the mitzva of <i>Hak’hel</i> (ch. 8), another Temple practice, which in recent times has also been commemorated.",
            "In addition to <i>halakha</i>, I address matters of faith. This focus is appropriate for Sukkot, about which the Torah states: “In order that future generations may know that I made the Israelites dwell in <i>sukkot</i> when I brought them out of the land of Egypt” (Vayikra 23:43). Furthermore, belief is linked with joy, which is a special emphasis of Sukkot. In this book, I write extensively about joy and how to achieve it.",
            "<b>2</b> As I did in earlier books, I start with general principles and go on to explain details. For example, after defining a <i>sukka</i> as a temporary residence (1:6), I spend the second chapter detailing the <i>sukka</i>’s laws. Starting from the general principle that we should reside in the <i>sukka</i> the way that we normally reside in our home (3:1), I go on to detail all the laws pertaining to sitting in the <i>sukka</i> (3:2-14). After establishing the five general disqualifications pertaining to the four species (4:4), I interpret the laws in light of the general principle that to be kosher, each of the species must retain its natural form.",
            "<b>3</b> This volume, like the earlier ones, has a supplemental volume (<i>Harḥavot</i>) with additional source material and halakhic explanations, particularly relating to anything novel. Earlier <i>Harḥavot</i> volumes were written reactively, in response to questions asked by Torah scholars who were studying <i>Peninei Halakha</i> in depth and requested more information about the sources and rationales presented. Therefore, the earlier <i>Harḥavot</i> were not methodical. Sometimes they contained extensive, in-depth explanations, and sometimes just short lists of sources on a subject. Sometimes philosophical elaborations were included as well.",
            "<b>4</b> In contrast, the <i>Harḥavot</i> volume for <i>Peninei Halakha: Sukkot</i> has a wonderful new feature. We were honored to have most of the supplemental material methodically written by a team of serious Torah scholars. With great care and precision, they deftly derive correct halakhic decisions from the raw source material. And, with God’s help, they are home-grown, products of our holy yeshiva in Har Bracha. I am referring primarily to Rav Maor Cayam, Rav Oren Dachbash, and Rav Bar’el Shevach. In earlier <i>Harḥavot</i> volumes, I needed to apologize for the supplemental material being less smooth than the main text; but this is no longer the case, thanks to the division of labor (cf. <i>Sanhedrin</i> 7b). Each writer takes responsibility for his own contribution, while Rav Maor Cayam serves as the overall editor for the supplemental material. This enables various subjects to be treated at length without delaying the next volumes of <i>Peninei Halakha</i>. The result is the glorification of the Torah.",
            "<b>5</b> Instead of beginning with my usual thanks, this time I will reprint the speech I gave in 2013 at the ceremony where I was awarded the Prize for a Torah Work (in memory of R. Zvi Yehuda Kook) by the Cathedra for Torah and Wisdom in Givat Shmuel:",
            "“I wish to express my gratitude . . . (to the Cathedra for granting me the prize). This prize does not truly belong to me. It belongs to my parents – my father and teacher, my mother and teacher – and to Yeshivat Mercaz HaRav and its Rosh Yeshiva when I was there, R. Zvi Yehuda HaKohen Kook zt”l. I do my best to follow in their ways.",
            "“It also belongs to the residents of the settlement where I have served as rabbi for twenty-five years. They have the privilege of guarding our nation and land in a front-line settlement at the top of Har Bracha. Their idealism-infused actions inspire me, while their questions challenge me. It is thanks to them that I have the opportunity to delve into the Torah in order to illuminate and provide guidance for life. The <i>Peninei Halakha</i> series is the fruit of our interactions.",
            "“The prize belongs to all the students and teachers at the yeshiva as well. Studying with them regularly has allowed me to explore in breadth and depth the topics dealt with in <i>Peninei Halakha</i>. Therefore, with God’s help, I will donate the prize money to the yeshiva.",
            "“I would like to mention those who have especially helped me: Rav Yonadav Zar, Rav Maor Cayam, Rav Eyal Moshe, Rav Oren Matza, Rav Oren Dachbash, Rav Bar’el Shevach, Rav Shlomi Badash, R. David Witzner, R. Maor Horowitz, R. Netanel Rosenstein, and all the other kollel and yeshiva students who provided helpful comments. I would like to thank my old friend Rav Ze’ev Sultanovitch, with whom I have had the honor to study and clarify complicated topics for the last thirty-five years. My thanks to all the rabbis of the yeshiva, who look after the yeshiva and its students, allowing me to devote myself to writing books.",
            "“It is also a great privilege to thank the talented and industrious people who facilitate all of the yeshiva’s holy initiatives, not least of which is bringing these books to publication. They include: the yeshiva’s first administrator, former MK Yaakov Katz (Ketzaleh); the notable administrator, Dudu Sa’ada (who went on to run the Basheva newspaper); and the current administrator, Yaakov Weinberger. I would also like to thank board members Yechezkel Amber and Yoni Hayisraeli, as well as those responsible for publishing the books over the years: Shmuel Avital, Alon Ba’al Tzedaka, Yisrael Sa’adia, Shalev Cayam, Yogev Cohen, Yisrael Baum, and Keren Fogel.",
            "“A special thanks to my in-laws R. Tuvia and Penina Katz, and to my dear wife Inbal. She encourages and helps me with my work in every possible way. This includes helping me clarify some fundamental topics, especially those that involve applying spiritual concepts to everyday life.",
            "“I would also like to thank the readers of my books. In a certain sense, they are with me in my room when I learn Torah. They make comments and ask questions. They wrinkle their foreheads when the explanation is not clear enough, and their faces light up when issues are clarified. Often, they appear as specific friends, students, or acquaintances, who I know would definitely be bothered by a given topic. I try to discuss it with them and work it out for them. I do not always succeed, and sometimes the readers I conjure up remain unsatisfied. Yet I have no choice but to write the truth as I understand it.",
            "“That little room is filled with the images of many people. There are ordinary people, who wake up early to face a full day of work, and who would like to know what their mission is in life. There are movers and shakers, who are engaged in developing the world, and who want the Torah to illuminate and elevate their lives. There are children and teens, who have open minds, and who want a clear understanding of the <i>halakha</i>, without complications. There are Torah scholars, who are looking for a central idea that they can trace, in a straight line, from the original sources through the later commentaries, right down to the <i>halakha</i> in practice. There are academics, some who are close to the Torah and some who are far, who want to understand the logic and harmony of the Torah. There are students in pre-army academies, who are searching for the ideals of the <i>halakha</i> and the reasons informing them. There are soldiers and others who are pressed for time, and who just want to know what is obligatory, what is optional, and what is the minimum required in pressing circumstances.",
            "“Women who are trying to understand how <i>halakha</i> applies to them are also partners in these books. Most Torah books are directed at men, so women who study them are left wondering whether the laws apply to them or not. Sometimes I compose a paragraph and realize that women might find it offensive. So, I dig deeper, and often I discover that with a deeper understanding and a more precise formulation, the objections fade away. Sometimes, though, I do not have a good explanation. I imagine myself apologizing shamefacedly and adding, ‘I have no choice. This is what <i>halakha</i> says. We must strengthen our faith that the Torah’s ways are good and correct. What we do not currently understand, we hope to understand at some future point.’",
            "“I also have in mind those truth-seekers among the nations of the world. This is especially relevant now that the books are being translated into many languages and are available to all on the internet. I try to ensure that I do not use formulations that will hurt them, while simultaneously making certain not to change any of the Torah’s truths. When I present the unique mission of the Jews, whom God chose as His special nation, I explain that this is not at the expense of non-Jews, but rather for their benefit.",
            "“I will conclude with a personal note. It is natural that someone writing halakhic works is likely to feel pressure. On the one hand, some wish me to be lenient in order to make <i>halakha</i> fit better with the spirit of the times and the prevailing culture. On the other hand, others wish me to be stringent in accordance with every opinion mentioned in halakhic literature, even one held by only a single Torah scholar.",
            "“There is pressure from those who want me to keep things very brief and deal only with generalities, and pressure from those who wish me to present endless details, as is often done in halakhic works. In my humble opinion, to withstand all this pressure and find the correct balance, it is necessary to have a safe space. Thank God, the residents of Har Bracha and my family members have provided me this safe space and given me maximal support. I do not know if I could have managed without it.",
            "“May it be God’s will that we have the privilege to study His holy Torah in depth, and through it to continue building up the Land of Israel and Jerusalem. May we have the privilege of rebuilding the Temple and seeing the arrival of the redeemer, speedily in our days. May Torah go forth from Zion and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.”",
            "<b>6</b> I would like to take this opportunity to single out those who helped with this volume: Rav Maor Cayam, Rav Bar’el Shevach, and Rav Yonadav Zar. They are also credited in the <i>Harḥavot</i>, each one for the material he contributed. Thanks to R. Maor Horowitz for his help with editing and preparing the book for publication, and to R. Netanel Rosenstein for writing the index.",

                    "<b>1. The Names and Foundations of the Festival</b>",
                    "There are three names for the festival which begins on the fifteenth of Tishrei: 1) <i>Ḥag Ha-Sukkot</i>, the Festival of Booths, after its primary mitzva; 2) The Festival of Ingathering (<i>Ḥag Ha-asif</i>), as it falls during the time of year when the gathering in of the harvested grain and fruit is finished; 3) The Festival (<i>He-ḥag</i>), as it is the festival par excellence. It is sometimes referred to this way without any further elaboration, as we read, “At that time Shlomo kept the Festival (<i>He-ḥag</i>) for seven days” (2 Divrei Ha-yamim 7:8). This is because it is the most joyous and festive of the festivals; it has the added joy of dancing at the <i>Simḥat Beit Ha-sho’eva</i> celebration (<i>Tosefot Yom Tov</i> to <i>m. Rosh Ha-shana</i> 1:2; below, section 10), and Israel would offer more sacrifices on Sukkot than on the other festivals (<i>Ha’amek Davar</i> to Devarim 16:13). The special joy of Sukkot will be explained below (section 8).",
                    "There are three fundamental and interrelated elements of the festival of Sukkot: 1) The intrinsic holiness of the days (including Shemini Atzeret), which conclude the annual cycle of festivals, and during which we rejoice and give thanks to God for the year’s crops. This sanctity is expressed in the mitzva to refrain from <i>melekhet avoda</i> (occupational work; see <i>Peninei Halakha: Mo’adim</i> 11:1) on the first and eighth days, which are holidays, and in the partial abstention on the intermediate days of <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i>. The sanctity of these days is also expressed in the extra sacrifices that we are commanded to offer on this festival, as described in Bamidbar (29:12-34). 2) The mitzva of the <i>arba’at ha-minim</i> (four species), which adds to the joy of gathering in the year’s produce and of the repentance and atonement achieved during the Days of Awe. 3) The mitzva of <i>sukka</i>, which gives the festival its name, so that every generation knows that God redeemed Israel from Egypt and watches over His people. The <i>sukka</i> also alludes to a time in the future, when God will spread His <i>sukka</i> of peace over us, over all of Israel, and over the entire world.",
                    "These three elements are introduced in the section of the Torah that deals with the holidays (Vayikra 23:33-44). In contrast to other festivals, which are each described as a single unit, Sukkot is described in three stages. First: The Lord spoke to Moshe saying: Say to the Israelites: On the fifteenth day of this seventh month there shall be the Lord’s seven-day festival of Sukkot. The first day shall be a sacred occasion: you shall not work at your occupations; seven days you shall bring offerings by fire to the Lord. On the eighth day you shall observe a sacred occasion and bring an offering by fire to the Lord; it is a solemn gathering; you shall not work at your occupations. (33-38)",
                    "Second: Mark, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the yield of your land, you shall observe the seven-day festival of the Lord; a complete rest on the first day, and a complete rest on the eighth day. On the first day you shall take the fruit of a <i>hadar</i> tree, branches of palm trees, boughs of dense-leaved trees, and willows of the brook, and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days. (39-40)",
                    "Third: You shall observe it as a festival of the Lord for seven days in the year; you shall observe it in the seventh month as a law for all time, throughout the ages. You shall dwell in <i>sukkot</i> seven days; all citizens in Israel shall dwell in <i>sukkot</i>, in order that future generations may know that I made the Israelites dwell in <i>sukkot</i> when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, I the Lord your God. (<i>Ibid</i>. 41-43)"
                ],
                [
                    "<b>2. The Festival of Ingathering</b>",
                    "Sukkot is also called the Festival of Ingathering – “the Festival of Ingathering at the turn of the year” (Shemot 34:22) – because it occurs when the grain and other crops are gathered in from the fields and brought into homes and storehouses. Thus, the verse states: “Hold a seven-day festival of Sukkot when you gather in from your threshing floor and your winery” (Devarim 16:13, and similarly Vayikra 23:39).",
                    "The three pilgrimage festivals are connected to the agricultural seasons during which they occur, as the Torah states: Three times a year you shall hold a festival for Me: the Festival of Unleavened Bread…at the ordained time of the month of Aviv…. The Festival of the Harvest of the first fruits of your work, of what you sow in the field; and the Festival of Ingathering at the end of the year, when you gather your handiwork in from the field. (Shemot 23:14-16) Pesaḥ is in <i>aviv</i> (spring), when everything is beginning to bloom; Shavu’ot is at the end of the grain harvest and the beginning of the fruit harvest; and Sukkot is at the completion of the ingathering of the year’s yield. The mitzva of each festival is to rejoice and thank God for the bounty with which He has blessed us. Sukkot, when we finish gathering in the produce of the whole year, is therefore the most joyful of all (<i>Peninei Halakha: Mo’adim</i> 1:2; 13:4-5).",
                    "These natural processes of this world reflect the spiritual processes that occur in the supernal worlds. Pesaḥ is a time of beginning and renewal, so we left Egypt then and became a nation. Shavu’ot is a time when the growth process reaches maturity, so we received the Torah then. Sukkot is when we finish gathering the grain and fruit into the house, so spiritually, it is a time to collect the spiritual fruits that Israel gained during the Egyptian bondage and the wanderings in the desert – and bring them into the home, that is, into Eretz Yisrael, Israel’s home. As Abarbanel wrote (Devarim 16:13), the primary joy of Sukkot is inheriting the land of Israel. Thus, Pesaḥ celebrates the uniqueness of Israel revealed at the time of the Exodus; Shavu’ot celebrates the giving of the Torah; and Sukkot celebrates inheriting Eretz Yisrael.",
                    "Two cycles culminate with Sukkot. The longer cycle is that of the three pilgrimage festivals, which correspond to the agricultural cycles and seasons, and which will begin anew with the winter planting.",
                    "The second cycle is the repentance and atonement that we experience during the months of Elul and Tishrei. We do many wonderful things in the course of the year, but by our very nature, we are also prone to sin. In order to complete the year on the most positive note possible, we must repent, cleanse, and purify ourselves from any evil still clinging to us. This is our spiritual undertaking during Elul, Rosh Ha-shana, the Ten Days of Repentance, and Yom Kippur. By virtue of this repentance, atonement, and purification, the good we have absorbed during the course of the year is further refined, cleansed of the evil that has clung to it. This enables us to multiply our joy on Sukkot.",
                    "Rav Kook explains that although repentance is tremendously important, as it cleanses hearts and purifies disgraceful actions, it is also accompanied by pain, which causes the dulling of good will and saps vitality. Therefore, the season of repentance culminates with the joy of Sukkot, which restores our will to do good and our bold vitality (<i>Orot Ha-teshuva</i> 9:10)."

                    "The mitzva of the four species is connected to the joy of Sukkot, as we read, “On the first day you shall take the fruit of a <i>hadar</i> tree, branches of palm trees, boughs of dense-leaved trees, and willows of the brook, and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days” (Vayikra 23:40). The Sages explain that the joy in taking the <i>lulav</i> (which represents all four species) is related to both aspects of the Ingathering Festival – the material and the spiritual.",
                    "The material milestone celebrated is the end of the ingathering of all the year’s produce, when people experience abundant joy. To sanctify and connect this joy to recognizing the One Who created and sustains the world, we are commanded to take the four species as a symbol of our gratitude to God (Ramban on Vayikra 23:39; <i>Sefer Ha-ḥinukh</i> §324). The Sages ordained the shaking or waving of the four species upward, downward, and in all four directions, to express our faith in the Lord of the heavens, the earth, and everything in all four directions. It also conveys an implicit prayer for the upcoming year: May our crops flourish, and may God save us from harmful weather (<i>Sukka</i> 37b; below, 5:4).",
                    "The spiritual aspect of the celebration relates to our completion of the process of repentance for the past year’s sins. Waving the <i>lulav</i> is waving a banner to signify victory, for the success of our repentance and our drawing closer to God. The Sages compare this to two litigants who presented their cases in court. At the conclusion of the trial, no one knew who had won. Only after one of the litigants waved his sword did everyone know that he had won. Similarly, each year during the Days of Awe, the wicked of the world accuse Israel, claiming that they have not been fulfilling their mission, do not deserve to represent God in this world, and are not even worthy of preserving. The deliberations are tense, and no one knows whose claims prevailed – until Israel emerges holding their <i>lulavim</i> and <i>etrogim</i>, signifying that they prevailed, that they are God’s children and people. The nations of the world even celebrate with them, which is why we offered sacrifices on their behalf on Sukkot. This is why we were commanded, “On the first day you shall take” (based on <i>Vayikra Rabba</i> 30:2; <i>Zohar</i> I 221a).",
                    "The Sages also said that the four species tied together allude to the four types of Jews who must unite in serving God. Their unification sanctifies God’s name in the world (as elaborated in 4:2-3 below) and also leads to great joy. Thus, by taking the four species, we can rejoice before God for seven days."

                    "<b>4. The <i>Sukka</i> as Commemoration of the Booths in the Wilderness and the Clouds of Glory</b>",
                    "The Torah explains the mitzva to dwell in the <i>sukka</i> for seven days: “In order that future generations may know that I made the Israelites dwell in <i>sukkot</i> when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, I the Lord your God” (Vayikra 23:43). There is a disagreement in the Mishna as to what is meant by “<i>sukkot</i>.” According to R. Eliezer, they refer to the clouds of glory (“<i>ananei ha-kavod</i>”) that sheltered Israel in the wilderness; according to R. Akiva, they refer to the actual booths in which the Israelites dwelt when they left Egypt (<i>Sukka</i> 11b). Both positions can be supported by the verses: Now when Pharaoh let the people go…they set out from Sukkot [i.e., they had built <i>sukkot</i>] and encamped at Etam, at the edge of the wilderness. The Lord went before them in a pillar of cloud by day, to guide them along the way, and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light, that they might travel day and night. The pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night did not depart from before the people [i.e., they were protected by the clouds of glory]. (Shemot 13:17, 20-22)",
                    "In the opinion of R. Akiva, the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> commemorates the booths that Israel built to shelter themselves from sun and rain, reminding us of our humble beginnings, when God took us out of Egypt and led us from slavery to freedom, and when we wandered in the wilderness for forty years, sheltering in temporary booths to protect us from the sun and rain, without houses or inherited estates. By commemorating this, we will thank God for bringing us to the good and spacious land, a land where we could build homes and plant trees. Remembering our humble accommodations in booths helps ensure that the bounty of the good land will not cause us to become arrogant and forget God. Rather, we will recall that all is in His hands; He gave us the strength to conquer and settle the land, to eat its fruits and be satisfied by its bounty (Rashbam, Vayikra 23:43). This commemoration also redounds to the credit of Israel, who followed God into the uncultivated wilderness (Rabbeinu Baḥya <i>ad loc.</i>).",
                    "In the opinion of R. Eliezer, the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> commemorates the great miracle that God performed for Israel by providing clouds of glory to protect and guide them in the wilderness, as we read, “The Lord’s cloud kept above them by day, as they moved on from the camp” (Bamidbar 10:34). The clouds of glory expressed God’s love for us. Not only did He provide us with all our needs in the wilderness for forty years, with manna, quail, and the well, but His <i>Shekhina</i> also dwelt in our midst, and He covered us with clouds of glory, sheltering and protecting us (Ramban, Vayikra 23:43). The Sages state, “There were seven clouds of glory with Israel…one in each of the four directions, one above, one below, and one in front, clearing the way for them” (<i>Mekhilta De-Rashbi</i>, Shemot 13:21; <i>Sifrei</i>, <i>Be-ha’alotekha</i> 83). They further state that due to the merit accrued by Israel in following God into the wilderness, He enveloped them in clouds of glory (<i>Zohar</i> III 103b).",
                    "A cloud both reveals and conceals. On one hand, it is an expression of the <i>Shekhina</i>, but at the same time it conceals the intense divine illumination so that we can absorb it gradually. This is how God reveals Himself to us. First, He radiates a powerful illumination upon us, but since it is too powerful for us to comprehend, He masks it, so the light reaches us in accordance with our ability to absorb it. It is like the sun, which provides the world with energy, but since we cannot withstand its intensity, God created the atmosphere to protect us from its rays. This idea is alluded to in the verse (Tehilim 84:12), “For the Lord God is sun and shield.” (See <i>Tanya</i>, <i>Sha’ar Ha-yiḥud Ve-ha’emuna</i>, ch. 4.)",
                    "The <i>sukka</i>’s <i>sekhakh</i> also alludes to this. Physically, it protects us from most of the sun’s light, but it is not completely impenetrable, so that we can enjoy the light. Spiritually as well, the <i>sekhakh</i> protects us from most of the “enveloping light” (<i>or makif</i>) revealed on Sukkot, allowing us to absorb it according to our abilities (below, section 7)."

                    "In addition to the reasons for <i>sukka</i> given above – commemorating the booths in the wilderness according to R. Akiva, and the clouds of glory according to R. Eliezer – residing in a <i>sukka</i> also reminds us of the Exodus from Egypt, as the verse states: “In order that future generations may know that I made the Israelites dwell in <i>sukkot</i> when I brought them out of the land of Egypt” (Vayikra 23:43). Not only Sukkot, but every Shabbat and holiday commemorates the Exodus from Egypt, as we acknowledge in <i>kiddush</i> and in our prayers. The Exodus is so important because the uniqueness of Israel, whom God chose as His treasured people and took out of Egypt, from bondage to freedom, was revealed through it. On a deeper level, He liberated our spirits from enslavement to materialism, for Egypt was a materialistic civilization. When we went free from Egypt, our spirits were freed from enslavement to the material, and we were free to accept the Torah (see <i>Peninei Halakha: Pesaḥ</i> 1:3).",
                    "It would seem that, if the <i>sukka</i> commemorates the Exodus, it should be built in the spring, the season when the Exodus took place. However, were we to build a <i>sukka</i> then, it would not be clear that it was to fulfill a mitzva, as during the spring there are people who sleep in booths or tents because they enjoy it. Therefore, we are commanded to reside in the <i>sukka</i> in the fall, to make it clear that we are doing so in order to fulfill a mitzva (<i>Tur</i>, OḤ 625).",

The Aḥaronim add that we must also keep in mind that the <i>sukka</i> is to commemorate the Exodus (MA; SAH; <i>Pri Megadim</i>; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 1). Some suggest that this is actually what R. Akiva meant – that we must remember the booths that Israel made when they left Egypt (Rabbeinu Ḥananel; <i>Taz</i>).

In the land, we live our entire lives in holiness, thus fully revealing the divine, through body and soul, in all areas of life.",

We are thus reminded of the fleeting nature of human life, of being slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt, and of the forty years we wandered in the wilderness and resided in makeshift booths (based on Rashbam to Vayikra 23:43).",
                    "Let us elaborate further. Comfortably living at home is likely to mislead a person to believe that the walls of his home can protect him from all trials and tribulations. However, in truth, one’s life in this world is temporary, and even the strongest and best homes cannot protect one from disease, natural disaster, and war. And even if someone survives all these and lives to a ripe old age, eventually his time runs out; it becomes clear that his stay in this world was temporary. And even during all the years when he was privileged to reside tranquilly in his secure home, the tranquility and protection were from God. One who does not live with this awareness is living a lie; he thinks that the more he invests in the frivolities of this world, the more stable and the better his life will be. The truth is that the more he connects his activities in this world to the Source of life and to eternal values, the more meaningful, good, and truly happy his life will be. (See section 9, below, about Kohelet.)",

It is for this reason that the <i>sukka</i> is referred to as “the shade of faith” (<i>tzila di-mehemnuta</i>). The timing of Sukkot is precise. Just before the winter arrives, and just as we are about to return to our homes for protection from the cold, wind, and rain, we are commanded to sit in the <i>sukka</i> and remember that God is our true guard and protector. “Unless the Lord builds the house, its builders labor in vain on it; unless the Lord watches over the city, the watchman keeps vigil in vain” (Tehilim 127:1).",

We will live securely in permanent homes in the good land that God promised to our ancestors and to us, as we read: On that day, I will set up again the fallen booth of David, I will mend its breaches and set up its ruins anew. I will build it firm as in the days of old…when the mountains shall drip wine and all the hills shall wave [with grain]. I will restore My people Israel. They shall rebuild ruined cities and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and drink their wine; they shall till gardens and eat their fruits.

                    "The mitzva to dwell in a <i>sukka</i> is special in that it sanctifies routine life. When one eats and drinks, converses and sleeps in a <i>sukka</i>, it exalts and sanctifies these mundane acts, turning them into a mitzva. The kabbalists allude to this when they explain that the light of the <i>sukka</i> is an “enveloping” or “surrounding” light (“<i>or makif</i>”), as contrasted with the light of most <i>mitzvot</i> (including the four species), which is an “inner light.” Let us explain further:",
                    "The light that radiates from God is above and beyond our capacity to absorb and contain. We can thus speak of two parts: inner light (“<i>or penimi</i>”) and enveloping light. Inner light is the less powerful part, which we can absorb through thought and emotion. The more powerful part, which is beyond our ability to absorb, becomes a light that envelops us; although we cannot contain it, it surrounds us and gives us inspiration that deeply affects our lives.",
                    "The inner light allows us to exalt and sanctify the more obviously spiritual aspects of our lives. It is revealed by means of Torah study, prayer, and primarily <i>mitzvot</i> between one and God, which connect people to that which is beyond the mundane; their sanctity is more apparent. From the perspective of the inner light, the more spiritual something is, the higher a level it is on, and in contrast, the more practical and routine something is, the lower a level it is on. The four species allude to this, as we take them solely to fulfill a mitzva (below, 4:2-3).",
                    "Through the much greater <i>or makif</i>, on the other hand, we can repair and elevate the material and routine parts of life as well. This great light is revealed when faith and Torah illuminate mundane life: eating, drinking, sleeping, family life, interpersonal relationships, work, commerce, and scientific research. This is the primary mission of the Jewish people: to reveal to the world that God is one, in heaven and on earth, and that even mundane matters are connected to holiness. The mitzva of <i>sukka</i> alludes to this, as everything we do inside the <i>sukka</i> is sanctified and transformed into a mitzva, thus revealing a profound secret of faith (<i>Zohar</i> II 186b).",
                    "In this way, the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> is similar to the mitzva of settling Eretz Yisrael. Both of these <i>mitzvot</i> envelop us. When we enter into their holy atmosphere, our mundane activities are sanctified. The Vilna Gaon (<i>Kol Ha-tor</i> 1:7) says that there is an allusion to this connection in the verse, “Salem became His abode (<i>sukko</i>); Zion, His den” (Tehilim 76:3). Similarly, as we said above (section 2), the primary joy of Sukkot is celebrating our inheriting the land (Abarbanel to Devarim 16:13). These two <i>mitzvot</i> in particular reveal the special qualities of Israel, for the unique aspect of Israel is revealing sanctity on earth (see <i>Avoda Zara</i> 3b).",
                    "These two <i>mitzvot</i> complement one another. The <i>sukka</i> commemorates the clouds of glory, through which the <i>Shekhina</i> was revealed in the wilderness, as we read, “They turned toward the wilderness, and there, in a cloud, appeared the glory of the Lord” (Shemot 16:10). Similarly, we read that at Mount Sinai there was “a dense cloud upon the mountain” (<i>ibid</i>. 19:16), and that when God revealed Himself to Moshe, “The Lord came down in a cloud; He stood with him there” (<i>ibid</i>. 34:5). The reason the <i>Shekhina</i> revealed itself in the wilderness in the thick of the cloud is because we had not yet merited entering the Holy Land, where everything is linked to holiness. After we entered the land, our job became revealing the <i>Shekhina</i> in the land, such that everything we do is infused with the Divine Presence. However, there is a risk that when we busy ourselves with the practicalities of daily life in Eretz Yisrael, we will forget to focus on the holy. God gave us Sukkot as a constant reminder of the clouds of glory, the presence of the <i>Shekhina</i>, and the sacred mission of the Jewish people to reveal holiness within the world of action.",
                    "Revealing the holiness of Sukkot and Eretz Yisrael will bring the world to its complete perfection, as it is written: “In all of My sacred mount nothing evil or vile shall be done; for the land shall be filled with devotion to the Lord as water covers the sea” (Yeshayahu 11:9). This will also lead to world peace, as we read, “The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, the leopard lie down with the kid” (<i>ibid</i>. 11:6). A similar sentiment is expressed in the chapter of Zechariah dealing with redemption and Sukkot: “And the Lord shall be king over all the earth; in that day there shall be one Lord with one name” (Zechariah 14:9). The nations of the world will ascend to Jerusalem and celebrate Sukkot with us. Even items which seem distant from holiness, like the bells of horses, will be designated “holy to God” (<i>ibid.</i> 14:20)."

                    "There is a mitzva to rejoice on all the festivals, as the Torah says, “You shall rejoice in your festival” (Devarim 16:14). On Sukkot, though, we are to be extra joyful. Therefore, the mitzva to rejoice on all the festivals was stated in context of Sukkot: After the ingathering from your threshing floor and your vat, you shall hold the seven-day festival of Sukkot. You shall <b>rejoice</b> in your festival, with your son and daughter, your male and female slave, the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow in your communities. For seven days you shall hold a festival for the Lord your God, in the place that the Lord will choose; for the Lord your God will bless all your crops and all your undertakings, and you shall have nothing but <b>joy</b>. (Devarim 16:13-15) Similarly we read, “Mark, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the yield of your land, you shall observe the seven-day festival of the Lord…and you shall <b>rejoice</b> before the Lord your God seven days” (Vayikra 23:39-40).",
                    "Joy is not explicitly mentioned in context of Pesaḥ. The Sages explain that this is because Pesaḥ is the time of judgment for the grain for the upcoming year. Additionally, since many Egyptians died then, our joy is incomplete. In reference to the festival of Shavu’ot, joy is mentioned once: “Then you shall observe the Festival of Weeks…and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God” (Devarim 16:10-11). By this point of the year, we already know that the grain has grown, and we are happy about it, but we are still worried about the rest of the produce. The word “joy” is not used in reference to Rosh Ha-shana, because it is a time of judgment for the entire world. But on Sukkot, after all the grain and fruits have been gathered in, and after we have repented and been atoned, we can truly and completely rejoice. This is why the verses speaking of Sukkot mention rejoicing three times (<i>Pesikta De-Rav Kahana</i>, Sukkot; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, OḤ 490:4; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 7).",
                    "The extra joy of Sukkot, then, is an end-of-year celebration, marking the ingathering of all the year’s produce – a material and spiritual ingathering of grain and fruits as well as of everything we learned and all the good things we did during the year. This ingathering is especially pure since it follows the season of repentance and atonement (as explained in section 2 above). The mitzva of taking the <i>lulav</i> also expresses the joy of the material and spiritual ingathering (section 3 above). Thus, we are elevated toward the Source of Life in ecstasy, and we gather to celebrate before the Lord our God. The <i>sukka</i>, surrounding us on all sides, symbolizes the ingathering of all the good things we did during the year. They all come together perfectly and envelop us, bathing us in divine light.",
                    "When we gather together every aspect and degree of goodness, even those which seem at first glance to be incompatible with one another, God spreads His canopy of peace over us, and Israel becomes cohesive and unified. For as long as each element stands on its own, there is no unity. But on the ingathering festival, all elements come together, revealing their unity. This is the meaning of the Sages’ statement: “All Jews can sit in one <i>sukka</i>” (<i>Sukka</i> 27b). Similarly, the four species hint at the different types of Jews who come together on Sukkot (below, 4:2-3).",
                    "Through the relative perfection that we attain on Sukkot in this world, we will reach the greater perfection in the messianic future, as the Sages said: “Of one who fulfills the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> in this world, the Holy One says, ‘He fulfilled the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> in this world; I will shelter him from the intense heat of the days to come’” (<i>Pesikta De-Rav Kahana</i>, Sukkot). This echoes a statement from the Gemara: There will be no Gehinnom in the future. Rather, God will remove the sun from its sheath and intensify its heat. The wicked will be brought to justice by it, and the righteous will be healed by it. The wicked will be brought to justice by it, as it is written: “For lo! That day is at hand, burning like an oven. All the arrogant and all the doers of evil shall be straw, and the day that is coming – said the Lord of Hosts – shall burn them to ashes…” (Malakhi 3:19-20). The righteous will be healed by it, as it is written: “But for you who revere My name, a sun of victory shall rise to bring healing” (<i>ibid</i>.).

This is very important for people to learn, as we are naturally predisposed to find happiness in the trivialities and vanities of this world, thinking that the richer we are, the larger our homes, the fancier our clothes, the finer our food, the more expensive our drinks, the more exotic our gardens, and the more numerous our staff of servants, the happier we will be. In truth, all these things are merely instrumental; they can help us toward the ultimate objective, which is our spiritual stature, faith, and good character. But when material possessions become primary, it makes us forget our inner wellbeing and values, detaches us from the Source of Life, and leaves us hollowed out, empty, and joyless.",

We achieve this by reinforcing our awareness that everything that we gathered was due to God’s kindness, and that its main purpose is to help us grow stronger in our faith and moral fiber and to give us the means and desire to help others and repair the world. We leave our secure, permanent homes for the temporary <i>sukka</i>, a place of mitzva and sanctity, and thus return to the foundations of the Jewish faith. We learn that our homes and possessions are tools to realize divine ideals.",
                    "This idea is expressed in Kohelet, which clarifies for us that wisdom, wealth, beauty, and other worldly virtues are trivial, “<i>hevel</i>.” Only one thing is important: “The sum of the matter, when all is said and done: Revere God and observe His <i>mitzvot</i>, for this is the entirety of humanity” (Kohelet 12:13). I heard a nice explanation of this from my uncle. “<i>Hevel</i>” means “nothing” or “zero,” while reverence of God is “one” – it is the first among virtues like one is the first number (<i>Shabbat</i> 31b). If reverence of God comes first and it is joined by wisdom, the 1 joined to the 0 makes 10. If wealth, which is also a 0, is added, we reach 100. If beauty, which is also a 0, is added, we reach 1000. And so on. However, if reverence for God does not lead off, then all the other virtues are meaningless, a big fat zero (R. Avraham Remer <i>zt”l</i>).",

But about the joy of a mitzva, it is written, “I therefore praised enjoyment. For the only good a man can have under the sun is to eat and drink and enjoy himself” (<i>ibid</i>. 8:15). The Sages expound: “The <i>Shekhina</i> does not dwell with someone who is feeling sad, lazy, frivolous, or silly, or who is speaking nonsense.

Sukka</i> 5:1). The celebration began after the afternoon <i>tamid</i> offering and continued all night long. As dawn approached, an official would make a declaration, and two <i>kohanim</i> standing at the upper gate would blow <i>teki’a-teru’a-teki’a</i> blasts on trumpets. They would lead everyone in a procession descending from the upper gate of the Temple. When the <i>kohanim</i> reached the tenth step, they blew <i>teki’a-teru’a-teki’a</i> blasts again. When they reached the women’s courtyard, they blew yet again. They continued blowing the trumpets until they arrived at the gate which exited the courtyard to the east. From there, the procession continued down to the Shilo’aḥ spring. There they drew water to be used for the libation that would accompany the morning <i>tamid</i> offering (<i>Sukka</i> 51b). When they ascended back to the Temple, they entered via the Water Gate, and the <i>kohanim</i> blew the trumpets once again. All of these blasts were celebratory, as we read (Yeshayahu 12:3), “Joyfully shall you draw water from the fountains of salvation” (<i>Sukka</i> 48a-b). The entire event was called the <i>Simḥat Beit Ha-sho’eva</i> (lit. “the Celebration of the Water-Drawing Place”) on account of this water-drawing procession. The Sages further report that the joy of this mitzva imbued Israel’s leaders with divine inspiration. This was an additional reason for the name – “for they ‘drew’ divine inspiration from there” (<i>y. Sukka</i> 5:1).",
                    "This joy rested on two foundations: the joy that typifies Sukkot, and the special mitzva of the water libation that took place only on Sukkot. During the year, all offerings, both individual and communal, were accompanied by a wine libation, which was poured on the altar. Only on Sukkot, at the morning <i>tamid</i>, was there a special mitzva of pouring water, in addition to wine, on the altar. They would fill two receptacles – one with wine and the other with the water brought from the Shilo’aḥ – and pour them out simultaneously into the Shitin, a natural hollow space under the Temple floor, through two adjacent holes in the surface of the altar. During the construction of the Temple, they built the altar above the Shitin and left a narrow opening between the altar and its ramp, so that the water libations could be poured into the Shitin (<i>Sukka</i> 49a). The Shitin was in place from the moment of creation, designated for use in this mitzva, to ensure that the water libations reach the very foundations of the earth; all other wine libations could simply be poured onto the altar (Maharsha, <i>Sukka</i> 3b).",
                    "The water libations express the uniqueness of Sukkot, in which the sanctity of natural life and existence is revealed – just as the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> transforms natural activities like sleeping and eating into <i>mitzvot</i>. All year long, only wine libations accompanied the offerings, because normally, only the special elevation to which wine alludes can reveal sanctity. But on Sukkot, after the observance of all the festivals and days of repentance, and after the gathering in all the year’s produce, sanctity is manifest in routine life as well, which is sustained by water. This is the greatest, most complete joy, as it incorporates all facets of life.",
                    "The Sages tell us that on Sukkot we are judged concerning water and that through the water libations, the incoming year’s rainfall is blessed (RH 16a). We must note that water alludes to God’s great kindness, which sustains everything, without exception: grass and trees, fruits and vegetables, fish and fowl, wild and domesticated animals, Israel and the nations of the world. Usually we are not worthy of ascending to the level of this great kindness, but on Sukkot, after we have completed the entire cycle of festivals and repentance, we become worthy of pouring water on the altar, thus connecting with the very foundations of the world’s existence and thereby opening the gates of blessing to all creatures. The joy that accompanies the drawing of the water is therefore very great indeed."

Every celebration held during the festival is a mitzva, as we read, “You shall rejoice in your festival” (Devarim 16:14). These commemorative celebrations, also called “<i>Simḥat Beit Ha-sho’eva</i>,” fulfill an additional mitzva by invoking the Temple celebrations and thus hasten the Temple’s rebuilding (<i>Sukka</i> 41a).",
                    "This custom has become stronger in recent centuries, as Jews from all over the world began to gather in Eretz Yisrael, and the light of salvation began to glimmer. Originally, these celebrations were held only in Eretz Yisrael, but they spread to the Diaspora as well. As R. Ḥayim ibn Attar (the “Or Ha-Ḥayim”) wrote in a letter from Jerusalem in 5503 (1742): “On <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i> we had a <i>Simḥat Beit Ha-sho’eva</i>. I was the one who lit [the torches] one night, and we held a great celebration.” Elsewhere it is recounted that people would dance in circles, holding torches.

He described how in the Kahal Tziyon Synagogue they set up a special device that shot water upward during the celebration. R. Yehuda Leibish Orenstein (head of the Ḥasidei Yerushalayim rabbinical court) wrote (in 5633/1872) that the Sadigora Ḥasidim who immigrated to Jerusalem hired non-Jewish musicians to play every night of <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i> at their <i>Simḥat Beit Ha-sho’eva</i> (<i>Responsa Moharil</i>, p. 8). However, the general Ashkenazic custom was not to light torches (<i>Ir Ha-kodesh Ve-hamikdash</i> 3:25:8-9).",

Ḥayim Abulafia instituted a <i>Simḥat Beit Ha-sho’eva</i> in the synagogue in Izmir, Turkey, to commemorate the Temple, in which they lit many candles in the synagogue and played hymns for about two hours, with dancing by elders and notables (<i>Ḥayim Va-ḥesed</i> 497:11). Similarly, the Rabbi of Tripoli in 5570/1810, R. Avraham Ḥayim Adadi, wrote that they customarily celebrated on <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i> nights, following the practice instituted by an emissary from Jerusalem. They sang and danced for two or three hours, with the sexton handing out candles to the dancers. Each dancer began by bowing in front of the holy ark (<i>Vayikra Avraham, Kuntres Makom She-nahagu</i>, p. 123). Some even permitted a mourner to play music at the <i>Simḥat Beit Ha-sho’eva</i>, since its joy is that of a mitzva and it commemorates the Temple (<i>Zera Emet</i> 2:157).

The custom is based upon the story that when King David opened the Shitin, the waters of the deep threatened to rise and flood the earth. David wrote the Tetragrammaton on a potsherd and placed it upon the water. The water sank 16,000 <i>amot</i>, and the world became very dry.

                    "Sukkot is special in that the nations of the world also have a part in it. The Sages say that the seventy bulls that we are commanded to sacrifice during the seven days of Sukkot correspond to the seventy nations of the world (<i>Sukka</i> 55b). As we have already learned (section 7 above), on Sukkot it is revealed that nothing is not connected to sanctity, so the positive value of the world’s nations is illuminated as well. The order in which the sacrifices are offered is unusual. On the first day we offer thirteen bulls, on the second day twelve. The numbers continue to descend each day, until on the seventh day we offer seven bulls (Bamidbar 29:12-34). The idea is that on the inside, deep down, the root of every nation in the world is good, though sometimes their actions manifest terrible evil. It is therefore necessary to separate the good from the bad. By gradually decreasing the number of sacrificial bulls, the negative forces dissipate until, on the seventh day, we offer only seven, the number that is most suitable for revealing sanctity in this world, which was created in seven days (<i>Ein Ayah</i> on <i>Shabbat</i> 2:7).",
                    "The prophet Zechariah teaches us that in the future, Sukkot will serve as a litmus test for the nations of the world. Those who ascend to Jerusalem to worship God and to celebrate with the Jewish people will merit great blessing, as we read: All who survive of all those nations that came up against Jerusalem shall make a pilgrimage year by year to bow low to the King, Lord of Hosts, and to observe the festival of Sukkot. Any of the earth’s peoples that do not make the pilgrimage to Jerusalem to bow low to the King, Lord of Hosts, shall receive no rain. If the Egyptian people do not go up…the Lord will bring on them the plague He inflicts on the nations that do not go up to celebrate the festival of Sukkot. Such shall be the punishment of Egypt and of all other nations that do not come up to observe the festival of Sukkot…. (Zechariah 14:16-19)",
                    "Our relationship with non-Jews is complicated. Over the course of our long history, they have often treated us very badly; nevertheless, our basic attitude toward them is positive. The Sages tell us, “Woe to the non-Jews, who sustained a loss that they are not even aware of. During Temple times, the altar atoned for them. Now, what atones for them?” (<i>Sukka</i> 55b). A <i>midrash</i> makes a similar point. “Israel said: ‘Master of the world, we sacrifice seventy bulls on their behalf. By rights they should love us. Yet they hate us!’ The verse (Tehilim 109:4) attests to this, stating, ‘They repay my love with accusations, but I continue to pray’” (<i>Bamidbar Rabba</i> 21:24).",
                    "<i>Zohar</i> explains in many places that we offer seventy bulls for the seventy nations out of love, in order to increase abundance and blessing for them (<i>Zohar</i> I 221a; III 256a). Even if they hate us, by offering the bulls on their behalf, we ensure that they are too preoccupied with their bounty to torment us (<i>ibid.</i> I 64a; II 187a). Ultimately, though, if they are ingrates and still hate us out of wickedness, the abundance they receive will become a stumbling block for them. Mishlei (25:21-22) attests to this: “If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat; if he is thirsty, give him water to drink. You will be heaping live coals on his head, and the Lord will reward you” (<i>Zohar</i> III 259a and 24a-b).",
                    "The responsibility that we show for the entire world reveals more of Israel’s special qualities. These qualities find expression on Shemini Atzeret, when we experience the special love between God and Israel. For this reason, we offer only one bull then. In the words of our Sages (<i>Sukka</i> 55b), “Why do we offer only a single bull on Shemini Atzeret? It corresponds to a singular nation. This can be compared to a king of flesh and blood who told his servants, ‘Make me a big feast.’ Then on the last day of the celebration he said to his favorite, ‘Make me a small banquet, so that I can enjoy your company alone.’” (See 7:2 below.)"

According to <i>Zohar</i>, it is also appropriate to invite “supernal guests” (“<i>ushpizin ila’in</i>”) into the <i>sukka</i>.

If one sits in the shelter of faith and invites supernal guests of faith but does not give their share to the poor, these righteous guests get up to leave. They are not interested in being hosted by a miser, as Scripture states: “Do not eat of a stingy man’s food; do not crave his dainties” (Mishlei 23:6-7). The table he set for the meal is his own table, not God’s table, and of him it is written: “I will strew dung upon your faces, the dung of your festival sacrifices” (Malakhi 2:3). Woe to this host when the supernal guests desert his table. When our patriarch Avraham – who spent his whole life standing at the crossroads inviting guests and setting the table for them – sees that this person has set his table without including the poor, he gets up and announces, “Move away from the tents of these wicked men” (Bamidbar 16:26). All the rest of the supernal guests then file out after him. On their way out, Yitzḥak says, “The belly of the wicked will be empty” (Mishlei 13:25), and Yaakov says, “The morsel you eat you will vomit” (<i>ibid</i>. 23:8). The rest of the righteous say, “For all tables are covered with vomit and filth without the Omnipresent” (Yeshayahu 28:8).",
                    "<i>Zohar</i> further states that one should not say, “First I will eat and drink to satiety, and then I will give what is left to the poor.” Rather, he should first give to the poor. If he acts properly, bringing joy to the poor and filling them to satiety, God delights in him. Avraham says of him, “Then you can seek the favor of the Lord. I will set you astride the heights of the earth” (Yeshayahu 58:14), and the rest of the righteous apply various positive verses to him. Happy is the person who merits this (<i>Zohar</i> III 103b-104a).",

Nevertheless, hosting them in his <i>sukka</i> is a greater mitzva. Nowadays it is particularly important to make a point of inviting people, as there are very few people today who are actually starving, but there are many people who are sad and lonely.

                    "If a <i>sukka</i> is more than 20 <i>amot</i> (c. 9 meters) tall, it is invalid, because a <i>sukka</i> must be a temporary residence, while <i>sekhakh</i> placed at such a height needs the support of a permanent structure. Note, however, that the main expression of the <i>sukka</i>’s impermanence is the <i>sekhakh</i>; the walls may be permanent, as long as this is not necessary to support the <i>sekhakh</i>. Thus, one may retract the roof in the home and place <i>sekhakh</i> instead of a ceiling; since the <i>sekhakh</i> is less than 20 <i>amot</i> high, it does not need the support of a permanent structure.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to R.

(According to <i>Noda Bi-Yehuda</i> and Ḥazon Ish, a <i>tefaḥ</i> is 9.6 cm and an <i>ama</i> is 57.6 cm.) More recent measurements showed that the <i>tefaḥ</i> of Rambam and other Rishonim is 7.6 cm and an <i>ama</i> is 45.6 cm, as explained in the <i>Harḥavot</i>. The <i>halakha</i> follows this latter measurement, as we explain in <i>Peninei Halakha: Shabbat</i> ch. 29 n. 1 and the <i>Harḥavot</i> there. Nevertheless, in the text above I use R. Naeh’s measurements, for several reasons: 1) for two generations or so, this was the accepted measure; 2) to avoid any uncertainty, one should measure a <i>tefaḥ</i> generously (<i>Sukka</i> 7a; MB 633:2). According to most <i>poskim</i>, this “generosity” means adding c. 2% (SHT 363:60), which already brings us halfway to R. Naeh’s measurements. Some maintain that the addition should be more than 2% (as explained in the <i>Harḥavot</i>); 3) the main reason to use R. Naeh’s measurements is his <i>tefaḥ</i> is a round number in the metric system: 8 cm. The more precise measurement of 7.6 is unwieldy. In order to make things easier for the reader, it is proper to use round numbers. Indeed, this is why the Sages themselves used round measurements like <i>tefaḥim</i> (handbreadths) and <i>amot</i> (arm-lengths). However, when pertinent, the more precise measurement remains primary. Thus, when following R. Naeh’s position results in a leniency, such as when calculating 20 <i>amot</i> and <i>lavud</i> (section 7 below), I use the more precise (smaller) measurements. Even then, I round down. For example, I write that 20 <i>amot</i> are c. 9 meters when the exact measurement is 9.12 meters (9.6 meters according to R. Naeh), and I write that <i>lavud</i> applies up to 22 cm, when the exact figure is 22.8 cm.</i>",

In truth, however, as long as there are openings in the <i>sekhakh</i>, the <i>sukka</i> is <i>mehudar</i>; the stars are not visible because the area is lit up or because one’s pupils have not yet adjusted to the dark.<br>According to Rabbeinu Tam, if rain cannot penetrate the <i>sekhakh</i>, the <i>sukka</i> is invalid, while according to Rosh, Rashi, and <i>Yere’im</i>, it is kosher. The lenient ruling is also implicit in all the Rishonim who do not mention this new requirement. Nevertheless, several Rishonim and Aḥaronim write that it is proper to follow the stringency of Rabbeinu Tam, though under pressing circumstances one may be lenient (<i>Birkei Yosef</i> 631:2; MB 631:6). The implication is that one may even recite the <i>berakha</i>, following Radbaz’s view (2:229) that once a <i>sukka</i> has been deemed kosher, one recites the <i>berakha</i> in it, and we do not apply the rule that “when uncertain about <i>berakhot</i> we are lenient.” This is also the opinion of <i>Shevet Ha-Levi</i> (7:60) and <i>Ḥazon Ovadia</i>, p. 37. See <i>Harḥavot</i>.</i>",
                    "If the shade exceeds the sun for most of the <i>sekhakh</i>’s coverage, but the sun exceeds the shade in a small part, the entire <i>sukka</i> is kosher, and even those sitting beneath the sparse <i>sekhakh</i> may recite the <i>berakha</i> over sitting in a <i>sukka</i>.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The shade must be greater than the sun in two different senses: 1) the shade must exceed the sun for most of the area of the <i>sekhakh</i>’s coverage; 2) there must be an outright majority of shaded areas. Some say that one must ensure that there is no area of 7x7 <i>tefaḥim</i> (53.2 cm x 53.2 cm) with more sun than shade, as that large an area is significant and therefore disqualified (Rema 631:2; <i>Levush</i>; SAH). Others are lenient even in such a case (Me’iri; the implication of SA). To uphold both views, one should ensure that the <i>sukka</i> contains no 7x7 <i>tefaḥim</i> area where the sun exceeds the shade, but <i>be-di’avad</i> one may recite the <i>berakha</i> even while sitting there.</i>",
                    "Sometimes <i>sekhakh</i> is not laid out flat, so at certain times of the day the sunny areas are larger, and at other times the shady areas are larger. In practice, we determine the status of the <i>sukka</i> based on the situation at noon. If it is mostly shaded, it is kosher; if not, it is invalid. (In some instances, even when there is more sun, we consider the <i>sekhakh</i> as though it were laid flat, and if that would make it so that it has more shade than sun, it is kosher; see SA 631:5.)"

Accordingly, the <i>sekhakh</i> may not be supported directly by iron poles, beams that are susceptible to <i>tum’a</i>, or other materials that are invalid for <i>sekhakh</i>, such as plastic, which does not grow from the ground.

Therefore, one who uses a metal frame for the walls of the <i>sukka</i> should not, <i>le-khatḥila</i>, lay the <i>sekhakh</i> directly on the metal, but rather should lay wooden beams across the metal and then place the <i>sekhakh</i> on the wooden beams. However, one who wants to be lenient may place the <i>sekhakh</i> directly on the metal, and the <i>sukka</i> is still kosher, and he may recite the <i>berakha</i> in it.<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The basis of this disagreement is in <i>Sukka</i> 21b. The Sages permit supporting the <i>sekhakh</i> with the posts of a bed, while R. Yehuda forbids. The Amora’im disagree as to R. Yehuda’s rationale. Some maintain that it is because a <i>sukka</i> may not lean on something impermanent like a bed, while others maintain that it is because the <i>sekhakh</i> may not be supported by something susceptible to <i>tum’a</i>. If we rule in accordance with R. Yehuda and also accept the second interpretation of his reasoning, then it would be prohibited to support <i>sekhakh</i> with something susceptible to <i>tum’a</i>. This is the ruling of Ramban, Ran, and Ritva. However, according to the vast majority of Rishonim, it is not prohibited. Firstly, many Rishonim maintain that the <i>halakha</i> follows the Sages (R. Yitzḥak ibn Gi’at, Rambam in <i>Peirush Ha-mishnayot</i>, <i>Ha-ma’or</i>, and Rid), in which case there is no reason for concern about using something susceptible to <i>tum’a</i> as a support. Many other Rishonim maintain that the <i>halakha</i> follows R. Yehuda, since the Gemara discusses his position, but they maintain that the first rationale is the primary one. <i>Terumat Ha-deshen</i> states that according to Rif and Rosh, R. Yehuda prohibits this <i>sukka</i> because of its impermanence; there is no prohibition on supporting <i>sekhakh</i> with something susceptible to <i>tum’a</i>. <i>Le</i>-<i>khatḥila</i>, it is proper to show concern for the view of Ramban and those who follow him (see SA 629:7), but the <i>halakha</i> is that one may support the <i>sekhakh</i> with something susceptible to <i>tum’a</i> and recite the <i>berakha</i> in such a <i>sukka</i>, as this is the position of the decisive majority of <i>poskim</i>. This is the ruling of SA 630:13. Furthermore, even according to Ramban and those who follow him, the prohibition is rabbinic (SHT 630:60), and we rule leniently when there is uncertainty about a rabbinic law.<br><i>Ḥazon Ish</i> (OḤ 143:2) has a unique explanation of the view that prohibits supporting <i>sekhakh</i> with something susceptible to <i>tum’a</i>. In the author’s reading, even if the supports of the supports are susceptible to <i>tum’a</i>, the <i>sukka</i> is invalid, since the <i>sukka</i> could not stand without those indirect supports. Accordingly, one may not reinforce the walls with nails or screws if the <i>sukka</i> would collapse upon their removal. However, even according to <i>Ḥazon Ish</i>, this stringency applies only to items which are not kosher as <i>sekhakh</i> on the Torah level. Therefore, planks more than 4 <i>tefaḥim</i> wide may still be used as support for the <i>sekhakh</i>, even though they may not be used as <i>sekhakh</i> due to the decree against ceiling material. In practice, the rest of the Aḥaronim do not follow this novel view (MA 629:9; <i>Pri Megadim</i>,<i> Eshel Avraham</i>,<i> ad loc</i>. 9; <i>Bi’ur Ha-Gra</i> <i>ad loc</i>. 11; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 25, all based on Ritva, Ramban, and others), nor does common practice.

If there is concern that a normal wind would blow the <i>sekhakh</i> off, one should place beams that are kosher as <i>sekhakh</i> on it. If there is still concern that the wind will blow off the beams, he should tie them down or nail them to the walls. In this way, only the supports of the supports are susceptible to <i>tum’a</i>, and this is permitted even according to those Rishonim who forbid supporting the <i>sekhakh</i> with something susceptible to <i>tum’a</i>, as explained in the previous note. Only according to Ḥazon Ish is this forbidden for the Rishonim who adopt the stringent view, and even Ḥazon Ish agrees that, when necessary, one may rely on the majority view of Rishonim that one may support the <i>sekhakh</i> with something susceptible to <i>tum’a</i>. This is proper practice to avoid a situation where an unusually strong wind might blow off the <i>sekhakh</i> on Shabbat or Yom Tov (when it would be forbidden to replace it because of the prohibition of <i>Boneh</i>). If the ropes are only helpful in a case of an unusual wind, they are not considered supports at all.<br>We should add that the decree against ceiling material is not grounds to forbid driving nails into large beams whose purpose is to prevent the <i>sekhakh</i> from flying off (see MA 627:2, based on <i>Tosafot</i>), because only when the nails are used to reinforce the planks that are the primary <i>sekhakh</i> is this a concern, as explained in AHS 629:32 and SHT 633:6. However, when the nails are only in the beams holding down the <i>sekhakh</i>, there is no reason for concern. (This goes against the stringent ruling in <i>Piskei Teshuvot</i> 629:11 and nn. 26 and 62, that the nails may not pass from the beam to the walls through the mat or slats; see <i>Ha-sukka Ha-shalem</i> pp. 290 and 335, which states that some say that even nailing down the <i>sekhakh</i> itself does not invalidate it.<br>When tying down the <i>sekhakh</i> is necessary so that a normal wind does not blow it off, rope is preferable to plastic zip ties, because rope is invalid as <i>sekhakh</i> only rabbinically, and most <i>poskim</i> (even those who are stringent) allow supporting the <i>sekhakh</i> with something invalid only rabbinically.

Therefore, one may use plastic, glass, or mesh netting (SA 630:1). Stone walls are also kosher, as only the <i>sekhakh</i> must be characteristic of a temporary residence; the walls can be permanent. Indeed, in some places, the common practice is to open the ceiling and roof of a room in the home and place kosher <i>sekhakh</i> there, resulting in a beautiful <i>sukka</i>, pleasant to sit in even in the cold.",
                    "<i>Le-khatḥila</i> it is better to build a <i>sukka</i> with four full walls and a door that can be closed, so the <i>sukka</i> is comfortable and provides shelter from the sun and wind (see Rema 630:5.) Technically, however, since a <i>sukka</i> is a temporary residence, it is not required to have four walls; three suffice. Moreover, the third wall need not be full; technically, one <i>tefaḥ</i> suffices. The Sages said that this <i>tefaḥ</i> must be within 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> of one of the other walls, and the one-<i>tefaḥ</i> wall must extend by means of a doorway (<i>tzurat ha-petaḥ</i>, explained in the note). Since this law is complicated, someone who wants to save on <i>sukka</i> walls should be advised to put up two complete walls, and a third one which is 7 <i>tefaḥim</i> long (about 56 centimeters). Then, even if his <i>sukka</i> is large, and even if the two walls aren’t connected to one another but rather face each other, the <i>sukka</i> is kosher (Rema 630:3).<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torah law requires that a <i>sukka</i> has three walls, and there is a tradition received from Moshe at Sinai that one <i>tefaḥ</i> is sufficient for the third wall (<i>Sukka</i> 6b). The Sages tell us that this <i>tefaḥ</i> must be “generous” (slightly more than a <i>tefaḥ</i>) and within 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> of one of the perpendicular walls, as any gap of less than 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> is considered connected (this is the law of <i>lavud</i>, explained in the next section). Thus, the third wall is considered to have 4 full <i>tefaḥim</i>, which is the majority of the minimum length of a <i>sukka</i> wall (7 <i>tefaḥim</i>). To extend the wall to the full 7 <i>tefaḥim</i>, one must create a <i>tzurat ha-petaḥ</i> – an opening that has two doorposts (<i>leḥayayim</i>) and a lintel (<i>kora</i>), the basic elements of a doorway – that is at least 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> wide. Some say that the <i>tzurat ha-petaḥ</i> must be at least 4 <i>tefaḥim</i> wide, as this is the minimum size of a doorway. In this view, the third wall, together with the <i>tzurat ha-petaḥ</i>, comes to eight <i>tefaḥim</i> (SA 630:2; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 9-10).<br>If the two walls are parallel, since the <i>sukka</i> that they form is open-ended and flush, the Sages require that the third wall be a little more than 4 <i>tefaḥim</i> long and placed within 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> of one of the parallel walls. The <i>poskim</i> disagree as to whether there is an additional requirement to make a <i>tzurat ha-petaḥ</i> until the end of that side of the <i>sukka</i> (SA 630:3). Rema writes that if one makes a third wall of 7 <i>tefaḥim</i>, the <i>sukka</i> will be kosher in any case, with no need for <i>lavud</i> or a <i>tzurat ha-petaḥ</i>. However, if the third wall has a gap of 10 <i>amot</i> or more, it requires a <i>tzurat ha-petaḥ</i> (MB 630:18).</i>"

                    "As we have seen (section 1), the minimum height of the walls is 10 <i>tefaḥim</i> (c. 80 cm). They must be close to the ground; if there is a gap of 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> (c. 22 cm) between the ground and the walls, the wall is invalid. However, there is no maximum gap between the top of the wall and the <i>sekhakh</i>, as we view the wall as if it continues up to the <i>sekhakh</i> (SA 630:9).<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are three principles handed to Moshe at Sinai that relate to the validity of <i>sukka</i> walls:<br><b><i>Lavud</i></b>, lit. “joined,” discussed above, means that we view gaps of less than 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> to be solid and filled in.<br><b><i>Gud asik meḥitzta</i></b>, lit. “extend the wall upward,” means that once a wall reaches the minimum height of 10 <i>tefaḥim</i> we treat it as though it extends upward in a straight line, <i>ad infinitum</i>. Thus, it is not necessary for the wall to reach the height of the <i>sekhakh</i>; rather, as long as the wall is 10 <i>tefaḥim</i> high, it is kosher, and we view it as if it continues straight up to the <i>sekhakh</i>. The straight line is measured from the top of the wall. That is, even if the wall is at an angle, the principle of <i>gud asik meḥitzta</i> means that we view it as continuing perfectly vertically. (See <i>Ḥazon Ish</i>, <i>Eruvin</i> 71:6.)<br><b><i>Dofen akuma</i></b>, lit. “bent wall,” means that if less than 4 <i>amot</i> of <i>sekhakh</i> at the side of the <i>sukka</i> (next to the wall) is invalid, we view the invalid <i>sekhakh</i> as a horizontal continuation of the adjacent wall – i.e., we view it as part of a “bent wall.” If the invalid <i>sekhakh</i> extends 4 <i>amot</i> (c. 1.8 meters) or more away from the wall, that wall is invalid, as <i>dofen akuma</i> does not apply to <i>sekhakh</i> that is 4 <i>amot</i> or more from the wall. In this case, the invalid <i>sekhakh</i> constitutes a barrier between the wall and the kosher <i>sekhakh</i>. Thus, for instance, in a home where the roof caved in and <i>sekhakh</i> was placed over the resulting hole, if there is less than 4 <i>amot</i> of residual roofing between the hole and the walls of the house, the walls of the house can be considered walls of a <i>sukka</i>. But if 4 <i>amot</i> or more of roof and ceiling remains around the hole, they cannot be considered <i>dofen akuma</i>, and it is necessary to erect walls directly under the hole in order to validate the <i>sukka</i> (<i>Sukka</i> 17a; SA 632:1).<br>Can these three principles be applied in combination? When it comes to <i>gud asik</i> <i>meḥitzta</i> and <i>dofen akuma</i>, that is, if the wall does not reach all the way up to the <i>sekhakh</i>, and the <i>sekhakh</i> directly over the top of the wall is invalid, the <i>poskim</i> disagree (MB 632:4).<br>There is agreement, however, that <i>gud asik</i> <i>meḥitzta</i> and <i>lavud</i> can be applied in combination. If the <i>sekhakh</i> does not go directly over the top of the wall but reaches within 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> of the wall’s vertical extension, it is valid. In this case, <i>gud asik</i> <i>meḥitzta</i> is applied to treat the wall as though it extends vertically to the level of the <i>sekhakh</i>, and <i>lavud</i> is then applied to close the horizontal gap between the <i>sekhakh</i> and the “wall” – the plane extending vertically from the top of the physical wall. However, if there are more than 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> (c. 22 cm) between the <i>sekhakh</i> and the plane extending vertically from the top of the wall, the <i>sukka</i> is invalid, because the <i>sekhakh</i> and the walls are disconnected (SA 630:9).</i>",
                    "One can erect walls by setting up poles or stretching lengths of rope within 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> of one another, because in such a case the law of <i>lavud</i> applies: since there is less than 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> (c. 22 cm) between the components, we treat the entire area between them as being solid. Even though the sun and wind enter through the gaps in the wall, the poles or strings are still considered a wall. It makes no difference whether the string or poles are arranged horizontally or vertically; as long as there is less than 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> between one pole or string and the next, <i>lavud</i> applies. However, some maintain that since <i>lavud</i> walls are inferior, they must surround the <i>sukka</i> on all four sides (MA; of course, a doorway does not invalidate this <i>sukka</i>). If the wall is made from crisscrossing components, like from mesh netting or chain link fence material, it is not considered inferior, and two walls plus a <i>tefaḥ</i> suffice (as explained in the previous section).

These <i>sukkot</i> are popular because they are cheap to make, easy to market, simple to put up and take down, and convenient to store.

The Rishonim objected to fabric walls that were not fastened at the bottom, so when wind blows, the walls rose more than 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> from the ground, invalidating them as walls. There was also the possibility that the wind would blow them away entirely. However, neither of these concerns applies to contemporary <i>sukkot</i>, since the fabric is fastened well all the way around. Therefore, these <i>sukkot</i> are kosher and the <i>berakha</i> may be recited in them. Those who are fastidious may add poles to create <i>lavud</i> walls.<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sukka</i> 24b states that walls made of tree branches that sway in the wind are invalid, so they must be fastened so they do not sway. Rambam and <i>Shulḥan Arukh</i> codify this ruling (MT, Laws of Shofar, <i>Sukka</i>, and <i>Lulav</i> 4:5; SA 630:10). Based on this, some wish to claim that any movement of a <i>sukka</i> wall invalidates the <i>sukka</i> (<i>Mishkenot Yaakov</i>, OḤ 123; <i>Yeḥaveh Da’at</i> 3:46). However, this is a very difficult position to defend, as it is impossible to fasten tree branches so that they do not sway at all. Indeed, all of the Rishonim who comment on this passage imply that the walls are invalid only when a normal wind causes a gap of 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> between the wall and the ground. In such a case, the wall is invalid even when there is no wind. However, a bit of motion that does not create such a gap does not invalidate the wall. See <i>Harḥavot</i>, which explains that this view emerges from the words of R. Sa’adia Gaon, Me’iri, Rashba, <i>Hagahot Asheri</i>, and R. Yonatan of Lunel. Rabbeinu Peretz (cited in <i>Tur</i> and SA 630:10) states explicitly that only when there is concern that the fabric will become completely detached from the frame is it proper not to use it for walls. Mabit, <i>Tosefet Shabbat</i>, <i>Pri Megadim</i>, <i>Ḥazon Ish</i> (OḤ 77:6), and <i>Melumdei Milḥama</i> (§96) write accordingly.<br>Those who wish to show concern for the stringent view should place horizontal bars no more than 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> (22.8 cm) from one another, up to a height of 10 <i>tefaḥim</i> (c. 80 cm). The gaps of under 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> are considered <i>lavud</i>, and so the bars constitute a wall even without the fabric. However, many make a mistake when they implement this stringency, relying on R. Ḥayim Naeh’s view that 3 <i>tefaḥim</i> is 24 cm, whereas it is actually only 22.8 cm. If the distance between the bars is greater than that, <i>lavud</i> no longer applies to them (as we explained in note 1). Nevertheless, the <i>sukka</i> is unquestionably kosher, as the <i>halakha</i> here follows the lenient view.</i>"

Further study is required to decide whether this 10 <i>tefaḥim</i> is measured from the bottom mattress or from the board on which it rests. It seems more plausible to say that one measures from the mattress, because it is an integral part of the bed. The possibility has also been raised of measuring from the floor (R.

Without such intent, the <i>sukka</i> is invalid. However, the <i>halakha</i> follows Beit Hillel’s view that one need not put up the <i>sukka</i> specifically for the mitzva of the festival.

Therefore, a <i>sukka</i> built by shepherds or guards to protect themselves from the sun is kosher, as is a <i>sukka</i> made by a non-Jew to provide himself with shade (<i>Sukka</i> 8a-b; SA 635:1). However, the Sages say that if a <i>sukka</i> was not built for the mitzva of the festival, <i>le-khatḥila</i> something should be added to it before the festival. For example, one could add a square <i>tefaḥ</i> of <i>sekhakh</i> or a strip of <i>sekhakh</i> that extends the length of the <i>sukka</i> (Yerushalmi; MB 636:4). The same applies to an “old <i>sukka</i>” – a <i>sukka</i> from a previous year that was never taken down. Technically it is kosher, but since it was put up for a previous year, it does not count as having been put up for this year’s mitzva.

The Yerushalmi also states that if a <i>sukka</i> was not built for the purpose of the mitzva, there is a mitzva to add something to it. <i>Binyan Shlomo</i> 1:43 explains that the Yerushalmi’s reason is that it is a mitzva to put up a <i>sukka,</i> and by adding something he participates in the mitzva of putting up the <i>sukka</i>.

                    "Since the <i>sukka</i> is a temporary residence, living in it will naturally not be as comfortable as living at home. Indeed, this is the mitzva – to reside in a temporary residence for the week of Sukkot. Therefore, we are not commanded to build impermeable, insulated, thick walls and <i>sekhakh</i> to protect its residents from cold, heat, and rain (as we would do in our normal homes). As a result, sometimes being in the <i>sukka</i> entails discomfort, in which case one is exempt, for one who is experiencing discomfort (a “<i>mitzta’er</i>”) is exempt from the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> (3:8-10 below). Thus, when it is very hot, or during very cold nights, or when it is raining, one is exempt from sitting in the <i>sukka</i>. A sick person for whom sitting in the <i>sukka</i> causes discomfort is exempt from sitting in the <i>sukka</i> and has no obligation to build a spacious, robust <i>sukka</i> so that he can remain there while experiencing the comforts of home (<i>Maharaḥ Or Zaru’a</i> §194).",
                    "However, one who was lax about building his <i>sukka</i>, so that he experiences discomfort in it even in normal weather, has not fulfilled the mitzva; it has become clear in hindsight that he failed to build a <i>sukka</i> that is worthy as a temporary residence, for even under normal conditions he experiences discomfort in it. One who knows that he can stay in a small, rickety <i>sukka</i> without experiencing discomfort may build such a <i>sukka</i> and fulfill the mitzva, as long as he resolves not to claim in the middle of Sukkot that he is <i>mitzta’er</i> because the <i>sukka</i> is too small or rickety. (See <i>Bikurei Yaakov</i> 640:13; MB 640:24.)",
                    "According to many, if one built a <i>sukka</i> that is not fit to sleep in – for instance, if it is in a windy place, and he built walls made of screens, so the wind and cold penetrate – then the <i>sukka</i> is invalid for eating as well. Likewise, if he built the <i>sukka</i> in a bad neighborhood where criminals roam around at night, making it dangerous to sleep there, then the <i>sukka</i> is invalid for eating as well. This is because the mitzva is to build a <i>sukka</i> that will serve as a temporary residence, for eating and sleeping, and since his <i>sukka</i> is not fit for sleeping, it is not considered a residence, so it is invalid for eating as well (<i>Yere’im</i>; Rema 640:4). Others say that even a <i>sukka</i> unfit for sleeping is kosher for eating; even though he sinned by building a <i>sukka</i> unfit for sleeping, since it is fit for eating in, it can be used to fulfill the mitzva of eating in the <i>sukka</i> (<i>Ḥakham Tzvi</i>). If one builds a normal <i>sukka</i> that is fit for sleeping in Eretz Yisrael, but he cannot sleep there because he lives in a cold climate, all agree that it is kosher, as the Torah does not obligate us to build a permanent structure as a <i>sukka</i>.

That is, he should think to himself: “If I had to leave home for a week, how much trouble would I go to, and how much money would I spend, to arrange comfortable lodgings?” That is how much he must invest in building a <i>sukka</i> or getting to somewhere he can build a <i>sukka</i>.

Thus, throughout the festival, one may not use any part of the <i>sukka</i>, whether from the <i>sekhakh</i> or from the walls (<i>Sukka</i> 9a).

Even if the <i>sukka</i> collapses, it is forbidden to use its broken parts and decorations until after the festival.

In practice, however, even if the <i>sukka</i> has not yet been used, they may not be moved on Shabbat and Yom Tov and are <i>muktzeh</i> due to the prohibition of <i>Soter</i> (<i>Mor U-Ketzi’a</i>; BHL 638:1 s.v. “lo”).</i>",

The prohibition applies only to taking something from the <i>sukka</i> and using it, for example taking a beam from the <i>sukka</i> to build something else or even pulling off a splinter to use as a toothpick (Rema 638:1; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 4). It is also forbidden to remove the wall hangings, the decorations, or the fruit hung from the <i>sekhakh</i> in order to use them for some other purpose.

This obligation is based on a <i>gezera shava</i> from the identical language used by the Torah to describe the first night of Sukkot and Pesaḥ, from which the Sages derive that just as there is an obligation to eat matza on the first night of Pesaḥ, so too there is an obligation to eat bread in the <i>sukka</i> on the first night of Sukkot (<i>Sukka</i> 27a; SA 639:3). This also teaches us the importance of the first night of Sukkot, which lays the foundation for the entire festival.",
                    "To ensure that people fulfill the mitzva with appetite, one must avoid filling foods for the three hours before <i>shki’at ha-ḥama</i> on the eve of the festival (MB 639:27).",
                    "The obligation can be fulfilled from <i>tzeit ha-kokhavim</i> onward. Since this mitzva is derived from the mitzva of eating matza on the first night of Pesaḥ, one should eat the bread before midnight. <i>Be-di’avad</i>, one who did not manage to eat by midnight may do so until dawn (MB <i>ad loc</i>. 25-26; <i>Peninei Halakha: Pesaḥ</i> 16:31).",
                    "Before beginning to eat bread on the first night, one should have intent that this eating is to fulfill God’s commandment to us to eat in the <i>sukka</i> as a commemoration of the Exodus and of the clouds of glory with which He sheltered us in the wilderness. <i>Le-khatḥila</i> one should have this intention throughout the festival, but, <i>be-di’avad</i>, even on the first night one discharges his obligation as long as he knows he fulfills a mitzva by eating in the <i>sukka</i> (MB 625:1; see above, 1:4-5).",
                    "Just as we make sure to eat a <i>kezayit</i> of matza according to all opinions on the first night of Pesaḥ, so too we make certain to eat a <i>kezayit</i> of bread according to all opinions on the first night of Sukkot. Thus, one should eat at least half an egg’s bulk (<i>keveitza</i>) of bread, and some are stringent and eat more than a <i>keveitza</i>; this is an admirable practice. It is not necessary to squash the challah when calculating the volume of an egg; one may estimate based on the normal state of the challah. One should eat the necessary quantity of bread unhurriedly but steadily. If one stopped eating in the middle for longer than <i>shi’ur akhilat pras</i> (6-7 minutes), he must start again.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to <i>Sukka</i> 27a, the obligation to eat bread in the <i>sukka</i> on the first night of Sukkot is derived from the obligation to eat matza on the first night of Pesaḥ, based on a <i>gezera shava</i>. The implication is that the minimum quantity required is a <i>kezayit</i>. This is found in <i>y.</i> <i>Sukka</i> 2:7 as well as in Rambam, Rosh, and other Rishonim, and is the ruling of SA 639:3. The <i>poskim</i> disagree as to the parameters of a <i>kezayit</i>. Many Ge’onim and Rishonim maintain that it is the size of a present-day olive. According to Rambam it is almost 1/3 the size of an egg, and according to <i>Tosafot</i> it is about half the size of an egg. Out of uncertainty, SA (OḤ 486:1) rules in accordance with <i>Tosafot</i>. Thus, someone who eats the volume of half an egg has fulfilled his obligation according to the vast majority of <i>poskim</i>.<br>Nevertheless, there are three reasons to be stringent and eat a bit more than a <i>keveitza</i> on the first night: <b>1)</b> According to Ran, it is a mitzva to eat more than a <i>keveitza</i> of bread, because this is the quantity that obligates one to eat in the <i>sukka</i>. MB 639:22 states that <i>le-khatḥila</i> it is proper to follow this opinion. <b>2)</b> According to <i>Noda Bi-Yehuda</i>, eggs nowadays are only half the size of the eggs in the time of the Sages, so the equivalent of eating half of a <i>keveitza</i> is eating the volume of an entire modern egg. Ashkenazim generally follow this position when it comes to Torah obligations. <b>3)</b> Even though Sephardim do not generally give weight to the opinion of <i>Noda Bi-Yehuda</i>, they end up requiring a similar amount, because most Sephardim base their measurements on weight rather than volume, and it emerges that this quantity is more than an egg’s volume of bread. According to some, the reason for calculating based on weight rather than volume is that to calculate the volume of the bread properly, one would have to squash it (<i>Peninei Halakha: Berakhot</i> 10:5-6, and <i>Peninei Halakha: Pesaḥ</i> 16:23-24.) We see that <i>le-khatḥila</i>, there are three good reasons to eat a little more than a <i>keveitza</i> of bread or challah, approximately the size of a normal slice. Anyone who eats calmly but steadily will certainly be able to finish eating this amount of bread within the required amount of time (<i>Peninei Halakha: Berakhot</i> 10:7).</i>",
                    "If it rains on the first night, some say there is no mitzva to eat a <i>kezayit</i> of bread in the <i>sukka</i>, as a <i>mitzta’er</i> (one who experiences discomfort) is exempt from the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> (Rashba; <i>Smag</i>). Others say that on the first night, even a <i>mitzta’er</i> must eat a <i>kezayit</i> of bread in the <i>sukka</i> (Rosh; Ran). In practice, it is proper to wait an hour or two in hopes that the rain will let up and it will be possible to fulfill the mitzva according to all. If the rain continues, or if the rain stopped but the water dripping from the waterlogged <i>sekhakh</i> makes it unpleasant to sit in the <i>sukka</i>, one should recite<i> kiddush</i> and <i>She-heḥeyanu</i> (on the festival itself) in the <i>sukka</i> and eat a <i>kezayit</i> of bread to fulfill the mitzva according to those who maintain that a <i>mitzta’er</i> is obligated to eat in the <i>sukka</i> on the first night. However, one should not recite the <i>berakha</i> of <i>Leishev</i>, since some maintain that even on the first night, a <i>mitzta’er</i> has no mitzva to eat in the <i>sukka</i> (Rema 629:5; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 35). If the rain stopped before midnight, and one would still get some enjoyment from eating bread, he should go to the <i>sukka</i>, recite “<i>ha-motzi</i>” and <i>Leishev</i>, and eat bread, thus fulfilling the mitzva according to those who maintain that the mitzva is to eat without discomfort."

However, people sometimes eat light meals and snacks (<i>akhilat ara’i</i>) when not at home. Therefore, one may eat an <i>akhilat ara’i</i> outside the <i>sukka</i>.

Even if this quantity does not fill him up entirely, since we normally satiate ourselves with grains, and since a quantity greater than a <i>keveitza</i> is somewhat satisfying, this is defined as <i>se’udat keva</i>. However, a <i>keveitza</i> or less is considered <i>akhilat ara’i</i>, which may be eaten outside of the <i>sukka</i>.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Gemara (<i>Sukka</i> 26a) states that eating bread as a snack is permitted outside the <i>sukka</i>. Abaye illustrates: a student grabbing something to eat as he rushes out to the <i>beit midrash</i>. The reason for this exemption is that all year long one would eat an <i>akhila ara’i</i> outside the home (Ran and Ritva). Rashi explains that <i>akhilat ara’i</i> is any quantity up to a mouthful, which is a <i>keveitza</i>. Thus, more than a <i>keveitza</i> is considered a proper meal. This is the view of <i>Tosafot</i>, Rosh, and Ran as well. In contrast, Rambam and R.

As for grain-based dishes, Rosh, Tur, and SA 639:2 maintain that these must be eaten in the <i>sukka</i> only if eaten in significant quantity, i.e., what one would eat for a meal, or if they are being eaten with a group. In contrast, according to <i>Magen Avraham</i> and <i>Shulḥan Arukh Ha-Rav</i>, if one is eating more than a <i>keveitza</i>, it must be eaten in the <i>sukka</i>. <i>Yeḥaveh Da’at</i> 1:65 states this as well, and this is what I write above.

It is possible that there is no disagreement; rather, each discussed what is considered <i>akhilat keva</i> in his milieu.

According to Ashkenazim and some Sephardim, one recites the <i>berakha</i> over the food first, followed by <i>Leishev</i>. Since it is the eating that obligates us to sit in the <i>sukka</i>, the <i>berakha</i> on the food comes before the <i>berakha</i> on the <i>sukka</i>.

The custom of some Sephardim is first to recite the <i>berakha</i> of <i>Leishev</i> while standing, and then sit down and recite the <i>berakha</i> over the food. People should continue their family’s tradition.<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>berakha</i> of <i>Leishev</i> is the subject of a passage in the Gemara (<i>Sukka</i> 45b-46a). There are two parts to the discussion: 1) According to Rambam, one should stand when reciting <i>Leishev</i> because the mitzva is formulated as “<i>teshvu</i>,” which he takes to mean “sit.” Since <i>berakhot</i> are generally recited right before the action, one should recite the <i>berakha</i> while standing and immediately sit down. This is the Yemenite custom. According to Raavad and Rosh, “<i>teshvu</i>” means “dwell” and refers to spending time in the <i>sukka</i>. Therefore, one who stands in the <i>sukka</i> also fulfills the mitzva. Since the custom is to recite <i>Leishev</i> before eating, one recites it while sitting down, right before eating. 2) According to Maharam of Rothenburg, one should recite <i>Leishev</i> before reciting the <i>berakha</i> over food, because one becomes obligated to recite <i>Leishev</i> immediately upon entering the <i>sukka</i>. Nevertheless, Rosh writes that the custom is to recite the <i>berakha</i> on bread first, because according to the custom of reciting <i>Leishev</i> only when one eats, the food triggers <i>berakha</i> on the <i>sukka</i>. <i>Taz</i> 643:2 suggests that “<i>ha-motzi</i>” (or “<i>mezonot</i>”) should be recited first, as <i>birkhot ha-nehenin</i> (blessings when deriving physical benefit) take precedence over <i>birkhot ha-mitzvot</i> (blessings over commandments). In practice, those from Morocco, Tunisia, most Sephardic countries, and all Ashkenazic countries recite the <i>berakha</i> on the food before <i>Leishev</i> (Rema 643:2-3; <i>Alei Hadas: Minhagei Tunis</i> 11:3). In contrast SA 643:3 rules that the <i>halakha</i> follows Rambam and Maharam, that one recites <i>Leishev</i> first, followed by the <i>berakha</i> on the food. This is also the view of <i>Ben Ish Ḥai</i> (Ha’azinu §5); <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 643:9, 16; and <i>Yeḥaveh Da’at</i> 5:47.

If he remembered only after he was basically finished eating, then if he can eat or drink a bit more before reciting <i>Birkat Ha-mazon</i>, he should recite <i>Leishev</i> and then eat or drink something. If he remembered after the meal was over, according to most <i>poskim</i> he should recite the <i>berakha</i> even though he does not intend to continue eating (MB 639:48); Sephardic practice is not to recite the <i>berakha</i> (<i>Yeḥaveh Da’at</i> 5:48).",

However, if he left for something significant – for example, to go to the synagogue or to take care of his business – when he returns, he must recite <i>Leishev</i> again.

However, according to <i>Levush</i>, <i>Shlah</i>, and <i>Magen Avraham</i> (<i>ad loc.</i> 17), he does not repeat the <i>berakha</i>, since the <i>sukka</i> never left his consciousness.

Others say that even in this case, he does not recite the <i>berakha</i> again (<i>Derekh Ha-ḥayim</i>; SAH; and others).

                    "Sleeping in the <i>sukka</i> is obligatory, whether one is going to sleep for the night (<i>sheinat keva</i>) or taking a nap (<i>sheinat ara’i</i>). In this, sleeping differs from eating; <i>akhilat ara’i</i> is permitted outside the <i>sukka</i> because people snack outside the home all year long (explained above, section 4). Sleeping is stricter because even <i>sheinat ara’i</i> is significant, as even a short nap can be refreshing, and people generally do not nap outside the home. Therefore, even <i>sheinat ara’i</i> must be in the <i>sukka</i> (<i>Sukka</i> 26a; SA 639:2).",
                    "Some people tend to doze off unintentionally while traveling or during lectures. This type of involuntary dozing off is not considered <i>sheinat ara’i</i> and is not prohibited outside the <i>sukka</i>. The difference between the cases is clear: In the case of <i>sheinat ara’i</i>, one puts his head down on a desk or some other support in order to sleep for a little while, and many people are careful not to sleep like this in public. In contrast, one who is dozing off actually wishes to remain awake but dozes off involuntarily and jolts awake periodically.<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If someone is dozing off during the Torah reading, <i>Ben Ish Ḥai</i> (<i>Haazinu</i> §8) states that he should be woken up. Others maintain that one is not required to wake up someone who dozed off involuntarily in the <i>sukka</i>, since one who is asleep is exempt from performing <i>mitzvot</i> (<i>Halikhot Shlomo</i> 9:17). Others say that the reason one should not wake him up is because he has the status of <i>mitzta’er</i> (Maharil Diskin; <i>Ḥazon Ovadia</i>, p. 201). Some maintain if the dozing off is brief (less than the amount of time it takes to walk 100 <i>amot</i>, which some estimate at 54 seconds), there is no prohibition involved. (See MB 639:11, which states that this is implied by R. Yitzḥak ibn Gi’at.) It would seem the primary distinction in practice is between one who intends to take a nap and puts his head down, who should be woken up since he is neglecting a Torah commandment, and one who dozes off involuntarily while sitting up; his sleep is not considered <i>sheinat ara’i</i> because he does not intend to sleep.<br>If one is traveling to perform a mitzva or to avoid a financial loss, he may lie down on a bench to sleep a little if this is his usual practice, because his travel is for a permissible purpose, the status of the <i>sukka</i> is the same as the status of the home all year long, and some people regularly nap while traveling. However, if one is on a trip or traveling for another non-mitzva reason, he may not sleep a <i>sheinat ara’i</i> outside of a <i>sukka</i> (as explained below, section 14), though involuntary dozing is not forbidden. See Rema 640:3 and <i>Harḥavot</i>.</i>",

                    "Sick people and their attendants are exempt from the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>. This exemption is not limited to the dangerously ill; even someone who is in no danger – for instance, someone who has a headache and finds sitting in the <i>sukka</i> difficult – is exempt. If a sick person needs help, his aide is exempt as well (<i>Sukka</i> 26a; SA 640:3).",
                    "Likewise, a <i>mitzta’er</i> (one who experiences pain or discomfort in the <i>sukka</i>) is exempt, because the mitzva is to reside in the <i>sukka</i> as one resides at home during the year. Just as one would not reside in a place that causes him pain and discomfort, so too on Sukkot, he is not obligated to dwell in the <i>sukka</i> if it causes him discomfort. True, a <i>sukka</i> is a temporary residence and therefore, by its nature, is not as comfortable as a house. This lesser comfort does not exempt someone from <i>sukka</i>, for this is precisely the mitzva. But when an additional factor causes staying in the <i>sukka</i> to entail pain and actual discomfort, one is exempt. The most common case of <i>mitzta’er</i> is rain.",
                    "The level of discomfort that warrants exemption from the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> must be significant, of the type that would lead one to move out of his home to a considerably less comfortable place nearby. For example, if one has a very minor leak in his roof, he would prefer to remain at home. Similarly, if there is a minimal amount of rain, one must remain in his <i>sukka</i>. If the rain persists, so the point that it would ruin his food and disturb his sleep, he would move elsewhere, despite the bother of moving, and even if his new quarters were smaller and shabbier. In such a situation, one is considered <i>mitzta’er</i> and is exempt from the <i>sukka</i>. He remains exempt as long as the <i>sekhakh</i> continues dripping enough to ruin his food (SA 639:5; <i>Eshel Avraham</i> [Buczacz] 640:4). If he is <i>mitzta’er</i> with respect to sleeping but not eating, he is exempt from sleeping in the <i>sukka</i> but obligated to eat there (MB 640:16).<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>mishna</i> (<i>Sukka</i> 2:9) states: “At what point is one permitted to leave the <i>sukka</i>? At the point when the <i>mikpa</i> is ruined.” The Gemara (<i>Sukka</i> 29a) explains that <i>mikpa</i> was a dish made of groats, and Rashi explains that it easily spoils with a bit of rain. SA 639:5 rules accordingly. This level of spoilage applies to the average person, but one who is particularly delicate has a lower threshold of becoming <i>mitztza’er</i>. When it comes to sleeping, though, even the average person is bothered by a minimal amount of rain, so he is exempt from sleeping in the <i>sukka</i> even if there is not enough rain to ruin the food (Rema 639:7). Certainly, optional activities such as studying and chatting may be moved inside on account of minimal rain (<i>Eshel Avraham</i> [Buczacz] 639:7). The comparison to the home found above is mentioned in Rema 639:5, citing several Rishonim. <i>Eshel Avraham</i> (Buczacz) 640:4 defines the threshold as follows: “The threshold is such that if one has a small place near his home, even though his home is larger and more comfortable, he would move to the smaller one to avoid the discomfort. The threshold is determined by what most people would do given the situation. If the person is elderly – by what other elderly people would do.” This is cited in <i>Halikhot Shlomo</i> 9:18. It would seem that if the meteorologists are predicting that it will definitely rain at night, and this causes someone worry and stress, he is exempt from sleeping in the <i>sukka</i>. (See <i>Harḥavot</i>.)</i>",
                    "If one left the <i>sukka</i> on account of rain, started eating inside, and then the rain stopped, he need not return to the <i>sukka</i>. Rather, he may finish eating in the house. Similarly, if he went to sleep in the house because it was raining, and then the rain stopped, he is not required to return to the <i>sukka</i>. He may sleep at home until morning (SA 639:6-7).<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The basis of this <i>halakha</i> is in <i>Sukka</i> 29a. Also see <i>Beit Yosef</i> and SA 639:6-7, which state that the exemption applies only until he wakes up and dawn breaks. However, if he wakes up after dawn and wants to continue sleeping, he must move to the <i>sukka</i>. Some rule this way in practice. But it seems more reasonable to assume that this is limited to one who regularly wakes up close to dawn. However, one who generally sleeps for another hour or two is not required to move into the <i>sukka</i> before the time he normally wakes up. (See <i>Piskei Teshuvot</i> <i>ad loc</i>. 16; <i>Hilkhot Ḥag Be-ḥag</i> ch. 17 n. 42.) This is certainly true for someone who is worried that if he moves into the <i>sukka</i> he will not be able to fall back asleep, in which case he would have the status of <i>mitzta’er</i> and need not relocate to the <i>sukka</i>. On the other hand, if moving to the <i>sukka</i> is only a minor inconvenience for someone, it would seem that even if he wakes up in the middle of the night, it is proper for him to move into the <i>sukka</i> to sleep.

Even though women are exempt from the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>, a woman who sleeps in the <i>sukka</i> fulfills a mitzva. Moreover, if the spouses sleep separately, it diminishes their festival joy.

This is because the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> is for a man to sleep in the <i>sukka</i> in the way that he normally sleeps in his home, which is with his wife. If they cannot both sleep in the <i>sukka</i>, he is exempt (Rema 639:2).

Indeed, many people put up a <i>sukka</i> which enables this. If it is very difficult to build such a <i>sukka</i>, he is exempt from sleeping in the <i>sukka</i>, because being apart takes away from their joy and causes sorrow to one or both of them. This leniency applies even when the woman is a <i>nidda</i>, all the more so when she is not and being apart would cause them to neglect the mitzva of having marital relations (<i>ona</i>). <i>Taz</i> (639:9) similarly states that if a man wants to make his wife happy by sleeping in the same room as her even when she is a <i>nidda</i>, he is considered to be engaged in one mitzva (<i>ona</i>), and thus exempt from another (sleeping in the <i>sukka</i>).

Vilna Gaon and <i>Sha’ar Ephraim</i> maintain that the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> does not entail sleeping in the <i>sukka</i> along with his wife. Similarly, <i>Nishmat Adam</i> (147:1) states that the mitzva to make one’s wife happy on Yom Tov is fulfilled by buying her clothing, not by sleeping in the same room as her. This is also the position of <i>Bikurei Yaakov</i> (639:18) and MB (<i>ad loc.</i> 18).

If they decide to go somewhere without a <i>sukka</i>, they should make sure not to eat <i>se’udot keva</i> during the trip. Rather, they should make do with fruits, vegetables, and a little bit of <i>mezonot</i> (above, section 5). Some disagree and maintain that when traveling, one may eat even <i>se’udot keva</i> outside of a <i>sukka</i>. Just as during the year, one who is traveling is not meticulous about eating in a house under a roof, so too on Sukkot, a traveler need not take care to eat in a <i>sukka</i>. Nevertheless, it seems that being lenient in this case is not appropriate. Only someone who is compelled to travel is exempt from <i>sukka</i>. But someone who decides to go on a pleasure trip is making a conscious decision to neglect the mitzva for no compelling reason, so he may go on a trip only if he takes care to eat all <i>se’udot keva</i> in a <i>sukka</i>.<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Our Rabbis taught: Travelers by day are exempt from <i>sukka</i> by day and obligated by night; travelers by night are exempt from <i>sukka</i> by night and obligated by day. Travelers by both day and night are exempt from <i>sukka</i> by both day and night” (<i>Sukka</i> 26a). Some maintain that those on an outing or pleasure trip have the same status as any travelers who are exempt from <i>sukka</i>, because one must treat his <i>sukka</i> as he treats his home; just as all year round, when one goes on a nature hike, he does not take care to eat at home, so too if one goes hiking on Sukkot, he is exempt from eating in a <i>sukka</i>. This is the opinion of R. Yosef Shalom Elyashiv (<i>He’arot Be-Masekhet</i> <i>Sukka</i>, 26a), R. Dov Lior (as quoted in R. Moshe Harari’s <i>Mikra’ei Kodesh: Hilkhot Sukkot</i>, p. 587), and R. Shlomo Aviner (<i>Responsa She’elat Shlomo</i> 2:98). In contrast, according to many, when the Sages exempted travelers from <i>sukka</i> based on the principle of “‘<i>teshvu</i>’ – <i>ke’ein taduru</i>,” they were referring to a situation where one was compelled to travel for his livelihood or another important necessity. In that case, he may behave as he does all year, when travelers eat outside the home. However, when it is not necessary to travel, this is precisely the situation about which the Torah commands us to dwell in the <i>sukka</i> and not go elsewhere to exempt oneself from the mitzva. Thus, if one decides to travel for pleasure on <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i>, he must make sure a <i>sukka</i> is available. (We saw something similar at the end of section 13: If one decides to have a medical procedure on <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i> when it could have been safely delayed, Rema rules he must sit in a <i>sukka</i> even if he is in pain.) This is the opinion of R. Moshe Feinstein (<i>Igrot Moshe</i> OḤ 3:91), R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (<i>Halikhot Shlomo</i> 9:21), R. Ovadia Yosef (<i>Yeḥaveh Da’at</i> 3:47), and R. Yaakov Ariel (<i>Be-ohalah shel Torah</i> 2:93). Additionally, those who travel on <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i> are not living the way they live normally; most people can travel only occasionally or during vacation, so they take advantage of <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i> to travel. But the days of <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i> are not simply vacation days. They are sacred days that are meant to be devoted to enjoying the festival through festive meals and Torah study. Therefore, those who decide to travel must at the very least make sure to eat in a <i>sukka</i>. If they planned the trip properly, and because of some mishap out of their control they ended up somewhere without a <i>sukka</i> and are hungry, it would seem that they may eat. After all, during the year if someone hungry gets stuck somewhere away from home, he eats there.</i>",
                    "As a rule, one should make sure not to waste <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i> on outings, as these holy days are meant for Torah study and festive meals. As I have written elsewhere, half the day should be dedicated to God, i.e., spent on study and prayer (<i>Peninei Halakha: Mo’adim</i> 10:6). The reason that <i>melakha</i> is forbidden on <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i> is to enable Torah study (<i>y</i>. <i>Mo’ed Katan</i> 2:3). When one devotes the holidays to his own pleasures, God says to him, “These are not My festivals, but rather yours.” About such people it says, “Your new moons and fixed seasons fill Me with loathing; they have become a burden to Me; I cannot endure them” (Yeshayahu 1:14). However, those who dedicate <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i> to Torah, prayer, and festive meals are beloved of God (<i>Shelah</i>, <i>Sukka</i>, <i>Ner Mitzva</i> 31).",
                    "Some trips have a mitzva element. One example is visiting one’s rabbi whom he does not see on a monthly basis. Another example is visiting Jerusalem in order to enjoy its courtyards, come close to the Temple Mount, and pray at the Western Wall; this is a quasi-fulfillment of the mitzva to make a pilgrimage to the Temple (<i>Peninei Halakha: Mo’adim</i> 1:16-17; 10:6). When people are on these types of trips and it is difficult for them to find a <i>sukka</i>, they may eat <i>se’udot keva</i> without one."

As we read: “On the first day you shall take the fruit of a <i>hadar</i> tree, branches of palm trees, boughs of dense-leaved trees, and willows of the brook, and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days” (Vayikra 23:40). The Gemara elaborates: “The fruit of a <i>hadar</i> tree” refers to an <i>etrog</i>; “branches of palm trees” to a <i>lulav</i>; “boughs of dense-leaved trees” to <i>hadasim</i>; and “willows of the brook” to <i>aravot</i> (<i>Sukka</i> 35a; see Me’iri and Ritva <i>ad loc</i>. and Rambam’s introduction to<i> Peirush Ha-mishnayot</i>).",

Our Sages say that just as among the four species there are two that produce fruit (<i>lulav</i> and <i>etrog</i>) and two that do not (<i>hadas</i> and <i>arava</i>), so too, in Israel there are Torah scholars and people of action. Just as the presence of all four species is necessary to fulfill the mitzva, so too the presence of both scholars and doers is necessary for the nation to thrive. Scholars cannot survive without doers, who help support them; and doers cannot survive without scholars, who enrich their lives with spiritual content and help connect them to the next world (based on <i>Menaḥot</i> 27a; <i>Ḥullin</i> 92a; <i>Tanḥuma</i> Emor; R.

The <i>arava</i>, which has neither taste nor smell, represents simple Jews who do not have much Torah or many good deeds.

The Sages ordained that the <i>berakha</i> is recited on the <i>lulav</i>, indicating that there is nothing more exalted than the Torah.",
                    "The basic condition for Torah study is that it must remain connected to, and united with, the entire Jewish people. Even though Torah contains different opinions and perspectives, it all comes from a single source, and the pieces will ultimately join together again. The unique form of the <i>lulav</i> expresses this unity. Its leaves grow on opposite sides of the spine, but they remain close to it, in unity. There are many leaves, but they are not separate. Rather each one overlaps with the next and just adds a little bit of its own. Together, the leaves cover the spine. Furthermore, each leaf is actually two leaves, held together at the tip (the <i>tiyomet</i>, as explained in section 6). The straightness of the <i>lulav</i> also expresses unity, as it is entirely oriented toward one goal. If a <i>lulav</i> is crooked, it is invalid because it faces in two directions. Thus, our Sages state, “Just as the palm has only one heart, so too Israel has only one heart, for their Father in Heaven” (<i>Sukka</i> 45b). Additionally, our Sages state, “The palm branches (<i>kapot</i>) are Torah scholars, who force (<i>kofin</i>) themselves to learn Torah from one another” (<i>Vayikra Rabba</i> 30:11). Thus, the <i>lulav</i> alludes to Torah, which has disagreements and different views that all stem from one source and share a common goal. This idea should inspire Torah scholars to increase peace and unity in the world. (See <i>Berakhot</i> 64a and <i>Ein Aya ad loc.</i>)",

The Sages say that the righteous are referred to as <i>hadasim</i>, and it is in their merit that the world endures (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 93a). It is through the practice of <i>mitzvot</i> that holiness is revealed in the activities of daily life. This discloses the value of this world, and it thus is worthy of enduring. The <i>hadasim</i> also allude to the mitzva to procreate and to educate one’s children. Its threefold leaves express increase, and the Sages say that the <i>hadas</i> alludes to our forebears Yaakov and Leah: “Just as the <i>hadas</i> is surrounded by leaves, so Yaakov was surrounded by children…and so Leah was surrounded by children” (<i>Vayikra Rabba</i> 30:10). Women who undertake the difficult jobs of having children, bringing them up, and educating them are the ones who primarily have the privilege of revealing the holiness of daily life.",

But it has incredible growing power and expresses the vitality and beauty of this world, the “common decency” which precedes Torah study. Therefore, the <i>arava</i> has great value, just as the vitality of simple Jews sustains Torah scholars and doers. Out of this vitality, Torah giants grow. We are witness to this frequently – people who are notable for their Torah knowledge or good deeds emerge from simple families.",
                    "Furthermore, the <i>arava</i> expresses the condition of Israel in this world. On the one hand, this world naturally has tremendous potential for growth, and through it God’s name can be sanctified in incomparable ways. On the other hand, holiness does not regularly manifest itself in this world. So too, the <i>arava</i> has no taste or smell, and when it does not receive water, which alludes to Torah and faith, it withers rapidly, just as when our Temple was destroyed, and we were exiled. We also find the Sages stating (<i>Vayikra Rabba</i> 30:10) that the <i>arava</i> alludes to Raḥel and Yosef: On the one hand, the existence of the Jews in this world is thanks to them, for all of Yaakov’s children were born because of his desire to marry Raḥel, and Israel’s continued existence in Egypt was thanks to the actions of the righteous Yosef, who laid the groundwork there that allowed them to flourish. On the other hand, since Raḥel and Yosef were connected to this-worldly life, which tends to distance people from the spiritual source of life, they both died younger than their siblings. Nevertheless, they are the ones who take the primary role in uncovering the redemptive elements in this world. Raḥel and Yosef’s extraordinary beauty alludes to this. This is also what the Sages mean when they say that during the future redemption, all trees will start bearing fruit (<i>Ketubot</i> 112b).",

The “fruit of a <i>hadar</i> tree” is an <i>etrog</i> and not a lemon. Even a hybrid <i>etrog</i> is invalid (section 10 below). “Boughs of dense-leaved trees” are <i>hadasim</i> with threefold leaves, not wild <i>hadasim</i>. One must take a willow branch, not a poplar branch.",
                    "2) They must retain their natural form. Thus, if the leaves of the <i>lulav</i> grow on only one side, or most of the leaves of the <i>hadas</i> or <i>arava</i> have fallen off, they are invalid.",
                    "3) They must be of the required size. If they are too small, they would not be referred to as “the fruit of a <i>hadar</i> tree” or “branches of a palm tree” or “boughs of dense-leaved trees” or “willows of the brook” (as explained in sections 7-9 and 12 below). If a specimen does not meet these three requirements, it is invalid for the entire festival.",
                    "4) They must possess <i>hadar</i> (beauty, aesthetic pleasantness), that is, they have not lost their natural form and beauty – for example, by completely drying out, even if they retain their basic shape. Most <i>poskim</i> invalidate specimens that lack <i>hadar</i> only on the first Yom Tov (Rambam; Ramban). Others say that this invalidates them all seven days (Rosh).",
                    "5) They must be whole. When it comes to an <i>etrog</i>, this means it must not be missing any flesh (section 11 below); regarding a <i>lulav</i>, it means the <i>tiyomet</i> must not be split (section 6 below). These defects invalidate the <i>lulav</i> and <i>etrog</i> on the first Yom Tov, but do not invalidate them during the rest of the festival. (See <i>Sukka</i> 34b; <i>Tosafot ad loc</i>. s.v. “she-tehei”; Rashi on 36b, s.v. “u-meshaninan.”)",
                    "Thus, to disqualify a specimen, it must have undergone a significant change. It follows that the stress that some people feel when choosing their specimens is unwarranted. True, in the upcoming sections we will deal extensively with the various defects that invalidate the four species, but these issues rarely come up. Even though most of the specimens on sale are kosher, Jewish practice is to enhance the mitzva by choosing beautiful specimens, as the Torah says, “This is my God and I will glorify Him (<i>ve-anvehu</i>)” (Shemot 15:2), which the Sages expound to mean: “Beautify (<i>hitna’eh</i>) yourself before Him through <i>mitzvot</i>: Make a beautiful (<i>na’ah</i>) <i>sukka</i>, a beautiful (<i>na’eh</i>) <i>lulav</i>…” (<i>Shabbat</i> 133b). This, however, should not be a source of stress.",

According to most <i>poskim</i>, one even recites the <i>berakha</i> when taking them; others say that one does not recite it.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“R.

Thus, even the Sages agree that a dry <i>lulav</i> may be used under pressing circumstances. According to Raavad, they would use dry <i>lulavim</i> only so that the mitzva would not be forgotten, but they did not recite the <i>berakha</i>. SA 649:6 shows concern for this position. In contrast, Rambam maintains that one does recite the <i>berakha</i> over a dry <i>lulav</i>, but not over a <i>lulav</i> disqualified for one of the other reasons.

                    "The <i>poskim</i> disagree about how to define a split <i>tiyomet</i>. Some say the <i>lulav</i> is invalid only if most of the <i>tiyomot</i> of most of the leaves are split (Rif and Rambam). Others say the law of the split <i>tiyomet</i> applies only to the upper, central leaf, since it is the most prominent and discernible of the leaves; if most of this <i>tiyomet</i> is split, the <i>lulav</i> is invalid (Ge’onim and Ran). The <i>halakha</i> in practice follows the latter view: on the first Yom Tov, if most of the central <i>tiyomet</i> is split, the <i>lulav</i> may not be used. In truth, in the vast majority of <i>lulavim</i>, most of the central leaf is closed, so almost all <i>lulavim</i> are kosher for use even on the first Yom Tov. Some are meticulous to avoid, <i>le-khatḥila</i>, a <i>lulav</i> whose central <i>tiyomet</i> has even a small split. However, there are very few <i>lulavim</i> where the <i>tiyomet</i> is completely closed, and the more developed and beautiful the <i>lulav</i>, the more likely that a bit of its uppermost leaf will be open. It would seem preferable to use a large, beautiful <i>lulav</i> with a slightly open central leaf than a small, shriveled <i>lulav</i> with a closed upper leaf. If one is concerned that the central leaf will continue to open and be mostly open by the first Yom Tov, he may glue it together to prevent its disqualification.",

However, if these two leaves separate from one another, the <i>lulav</i> is kosher since they are two different leaves (MB 645:15; <i>Pri Megadim</i>, <i>Mishbetzot Zahav ad loc.</i> 4).",

In their view, as long as there is a <i>korei</i> on the leaves, they are considered closed. However, others say that <i>le-khatḥila</i> it is preferable to take a <i>lulav</i> without a <i>korei</i>, for two reasons: First, they maintain that the <i>korei</i> does not ensure that the central leaf is closed. True, it is not necessary to worry that it is mostly split underneath the <i>korei</i>, because that is extraordinarily rare, but it is possible that a small split is hidden underneath, which is not <i>mehudar</i> according to some. Second, Ashkenazic custom is to shake the <i>lulav</i> in such a way that it rustles. When a <i>lulav</i> has <i>korei</i>, this cannot be done.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to most Rishonim, including Rabbeinu Ḥananel, Rif, Rambam, and Ramban, a split <i>tiyomet</i> invalidates a <i>lulav</i> if the majority of the leaves are split most of the way down. SA 645:3 rules this way. According to R. Paltoi Gaon and Ran, if the central leaf’s <i>tiyomet</i> is split, the <i>lulav</i> is invalid. Even though most Rishonim are lenient, on the first Yom Tov almost no Aḥaronim allow using a <i>lulav</i> if the <i>tiyomet</i> of its central leaf is split. Within that view, some say the <i>lulav</i> is invalid only if the <i>tiyomet</i> is split all the way down (Rema; SAH; <i>Ḥayei Adam</i>; <i>Ḥazon Ovadia</i>), while others invalidate it even when it is split only most of the way down (Ran; <i>Yam shel Shlomo</i>; <i>Baḥ</i>; Vilna Gaon; MB 645:19). Some write that a <i>lulav</i> whose central leaf has not opened is most <i>mehudar</i>, but there is a disagreement about this <i>hidur</i>. <i>Taz</i> says it means it is not split more than a <i>tefaḥ</i>, while <i>Ḥayei Adam</i> and <i>Bikurei Yaakov</i> say it cannot be split at all. In any case, since we are talking about a <i>hidur</i>, and it is the subject of dispute, it is better to look for <i>lulavim</i> that are beautiful in other ways.<br>In the opinion of <i>Bikurei Yaakov</i> 645:9, when the middle leaf is closed by the <i>korei</i>, it is considered closed even if it turns out after the <i>korei</i> is removed that it was open. From this perspective, a <i>lulav</i> with <i>korei</i> is <i>mehudar</i>. This is the ruling of R. Mordechai Eliyahu. However, <i>Ma’amar Mordekhai</i> 645:4 maintains that having <i>korei</i> does not mean the <i>lulav</i> is considered closed. Many defer to this opinion. Therefore, those who want to ensure that the <i>lulav</i> is closed according to all opinions prefer one without <i>korei</i> (Ḥazon Ish; <i>Ḥazon Ovadia</i>; <i>Piskei Teshuvot</i> 645 n. 13). For those who follow Ashkenazic custom, there is another reason that a <i>lulav</i> without <i>korei</i> is better: it rustles when shaken (<i>Bikurei Yaakov</i> 645:2). However, according to SA (651:9), there is no need for it to rustle.</i>"

Have a beautiful Torah scroll, written for the sake of heaven by a skilled scribe using quality ink and a quality quill, and wrap it in a beautiful silk covering” (<i>Shabbat</i> 133b). Along these lines, we find that God accepted the offering of Hevel, who brought his best and fattest sheep, while He did not accept Kayin’s stingy offering of simple fruits and vegetables (Bereshit 4:3-5; MT, Laws of Altar Prohibitions 7:10-11).",

For example, if one went to the market and found kosher <i>lulavim</i> at different prices, it is a mitzva for him to add a third to the price of the simplest <i>lulav</i> in order to buy a nicer one. If he wishes to further beautify the mitzva by spending even more for an even better <i>lulav</i>, God will reward him. This is on condition that the additional spending will not be at the expense of his fulfilling other, more important <i>mitzvot</i> or of his ability to pay his bills or provide for his household.",

If he wants to beautify the mitzva even more, he may buy the $50 set, and God will reward him.",

Conversely, if one is fortunate enough to be wealthy, it is appropriate for him to pay more than an additional third to beautify the <i>mitzvot</i>. This is especially true of someone who generally buys expensive clothing and furniture and is prepared to pay several times the basic price of those items. He should be prepared to spend similarly on <i>mitzvot</i>.<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Gemara (<i>Bava Kamma</i> 9a) discusses whether the extra third is calculated by the final price (<i>milevar</i>, “from the outside”) or the basic price (<i>milegav</i>, “from the inside”). Calculating <i>milegav</i> means that one must add 1/3 of that basic price, so, for instance, if the basic set costs $30, one must add a third of that, or $10, and buy a $40 set. Calculating <i>milevar</i> means that the additional spending must come to 1/3 of the final price, so, for instance, if the basic set costs $30, one must add $15, which is 1/3 of the final price of $45. Most Rishonim rule that we calculate <i>milevar</i> (Rabbeinu Ḥananel, Ran, Raavan, and others), but Rosh rules leniently, that we calculate <i>milegav</i>. <i>Beit Yosef</i> (656:1) rules accordingly since we are lenient in cases of uncertainty about rabbinic law. This is also the position of most Aḥaronim, and I follow this method of calculating in the text above.<br>If one bought a basic set and later has an opportunity to buy a better one, the mitzva of <i>hidur</i> requires him to buy it and pay more, but only if he can find someone to buy the basic set from him.

If the first day of the festival was on Shabbat, those living in Eretz Yisrael still took the <i>lulav</i>, but to ensure that people would not carry the <i>lulav</i> in the public domain (thus desecrating Shabbat), the Sages instituted that it be taken at home (<i>Sukka</i> 42b). Those who lived outside of Eretz Yisrael did not take the <i>lulav</i> if the first day was on Shabbat, because they did not know with certainty when the month had been sanctified by the <i>beit din.</i> Due to the resulting uncertainty about when the festival begins, they observed two consecutive days of Yom Tov. The extra day is called <i>Yom Tov Sheni shel Galuyot</i>. Since the people did not know for certain that the first day was indeed on Shabbat, the Sages ordained that outside of Eretz Yisrael, the <i>lulav</i> should not be taken at all on Shabbat, not even in the home, lest people mistakenly violate Shabbat by carrying the <i>lulav</i> in a public domain (<i>Sukka</i> 43a). However, because Diaspora Jews observed a second day of Yom Tov, even if one day coincided with Shabbat, they would take the <i>lulav</i> on the other day, and in years when neither day of Yom Tov coincided with Shabbat, Diaspora Jews would take the <i>lulav</i> on both days.",

On the other hand, the Sages were very concerned about impinging on the sanctity of Shabbat, for after the destruction, Shabbat remained as the foundation of the vitality and blessing of continued Jewish existence; on Shabbat, we can say, the sanctity of the day accomplished what taking the <i>lulav</i> accomplished on the other days. So to ensure that no one desecrate Shabbat (God forbid), the Sages decreed that on Shabbat, even when it coincides with Yom Tov, the <i>lulav</i> is not taken. In practice, this means that when the first day of Sukkot is on Shabbat, we do not fulfill the Torah commandment of taking the <i>lulav</i>, as taking the <i>lulav</i> during the rest of the festival is rabbinic."

                    "The procedure for shaking the four species is as follows: The bundled species in the right hand and the <i>etrog</i> in the left are brought together and held close to the body. Some are careful to pull them all the way to the chest. From there, the <i>lulav</i> and <i>etrog</i> are moved in a given direction, with the top of the <i>lulav</i> pointing upward but angled toward that direction. Then the four species are brought back to the body. This is repeated three times for each of the six directions (east, west, north, south, up, down). When shaking the <i>lulav</i> in the downward direction, one does not turn it upside down; rather, the top continues to point upward, and the person moves the <i>lulav</i> downward from the chest.",
                    "Some begin by shaking eastward and then continue moving rightward – south, west, north – and then upward and downward (SA 651:10). Some follow this order but begin with the direction that worshippers are facing.",

Others face east the whole time but angle the <i>lulav</i> according to the procedure for shaking. All of these customs are acceptable, and each person should continue his family’s custom. If the custom is unclear, he may do as he wishes.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Gemara (<i>Sukka</i> 37b), as we saw, says: “One moves it forth and back, up and down. Forth and back – for the sake of the One to Whom the four corners of the earth belong; up and down – for the sake of the One to Whom heaven and earth belong.” Many interpret this to mean that one must shake the <i>lulav</i> in all four directions plus up and down (<i>Shibolei Ha-leket</i>; Rosh 3:26). This is the widespread custom (SA 651:9). Others read it more simply – one moves it away from himself, then back toward himself, and then up and down, with no requirement to turn to the four directions (MT Laws of Shofar, <i>Sukka</i>, and <i>Lulav</i> 7:10; Ritva). This is the custom of some Yemenites (Maharitz). Regarding the number of shakes, we learn: “One must shake three times in each case” (<i>y. Sukka</i> 3:8). Some interpret this to mean that when the <i>lulav</i> is away from the body, one jiggles it three times, and after bringing it back to the body, one jiggles it another three times (SA 651:9). Others take it to mean that it is moved away from the body and back toward the body three times in each direction (Rema). Arizal supported the latter custom, which is the widespread practice. Some take care to fulfill both views. They move the <i>lulav</i> forth and back three times in each direction, and during one of those times, they jiggle it three times while it is away from the body and three more times when it is close (<i>Baḥ</i>; Maharshal; <i>Taz</i>; <i>Bikurei Yaakov</i> 651:33). Some stay facing forward and simply shake the <i>lulav</i> in each direction without turning (Maharil; <i>Eliya Rabba</i> 651:24; MB <i>ad loc</i>. 37). Others turn their bodies in each direction (<i>Ma’amar Mordekhai</i> <i>ad loc</i>. 13; <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> <i>ad loc</i>. 96). Arizal’s custom of beginning each shake at the chest fits better with the latter custom. (See SHT <i>ad loc</i>. 49.)</i>",

                    "In addition to the shaking after the recitation of the <i>berakha</i> on the <i>lulav</i>, the Sages ordained holding the <i>lulav</i> during the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> and shaking it when reciting the verses of “<i>Hodu la-Shem ki tov ki le-olam ḥasdo</i>” (“Thank the Lord for He is good, for His kindness endures forever”) and “<i>Ana Hashem hoshi’a na</i>” (“Lord, please, save us”) (<i>Sukka</i> 37b). They linked their enactment to a verse: “Then shall all the trees of the forest shout for joy…. Thank the Lord for He is good, for His kindness endures forever. Declare: Save us (<i>hoshi’enu</i>), O God, our deliverer, and gather us and save us from the nations, to acclaim Your holy name, to glory in Your praise” (1 Divrei Hayamim 16:33-35). How can trees “shout for joy”? When they sway and rustle. And when is that? When they recite “<i>hodu</i>” and “<i>hoshi’enu</i>.” The end of this verse may allude to an additional function of shaking the <i>lulav</i> – it may serve as a prayer for the ingathering of the exiles from the four corners of the earth.",
                    "Since Sukkot is when we are judged concerning rain, shaking the four species – which grew from the rains of the previous year – expresses thanks for the blessings of the previous year and a prayer for the upcoming one: that from the heaven, the earth, and the four winds will come beneficial rain and dew, not harmful precipitation and destructive winds.",

The shaking is parsed according to the words, and when saying God’s name, one stops and concentrates on the holiness of His name. Thus, when reciting “<i>Hodu</i>,” which contains six words apart from the name of God, one shakes in one direction with each word. When reciting “<i>Ana</i>,” which has only three words apart from the name of God, one shakes in two directions with each word (MB 651:37).",

There is no difference between the <i>ḥazan</i> and the congregation in this respect. Sephardim and some <i>Ḥasidim</i> follow this practice.

When the <i>ḥazan</i> recites “<i>Hodu</i>” and the next three verses (“<i>Yomar Na</i>,” “<i>Yomru Na Beit Aharon</i>,” and “<i>Yomru Na Yir’ei Hashem</i>”), the congregation responds with “<i>Hodu</i>.” The <i>ḥazan</i> shakes the <i>lulav</i> only to accompany the first two verses, “<i>Hodu</i>” and “<i>Yomar Na</i>”: the first because he is praising God, and the second because he is calling on all of Israel to praise God, and he is part of their subsequent praise. In contrast, the last two verses are not all-inclusive but are limited to the house of Aharon and God-fearers; he is not included among them, so he does not shake the <i>lulav</i> then (SA and Rema 651:8). The ninth shake (the <i>ḥazan</i>’s seventh) is at the end of <i>Hallel</i>, when Ashkenazim recite the verse of “<i>Hodu</i>” twice and shake the <i>lulav</i> each time, whereas, as we said in the previous paragraph, the kabbalistic practice is to shake only once then.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In some Ashkenazic synagogues, the <i>ḥazan</i> also shakes the <i>lulav</i> during the congregation’s recitation of “<i>Yomru Na Beit Aharon</i>” and “<i>Yomru Na Yir’ei Hashem</i>” (as described in <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Sukka</i> 37b, s.v. “be-hodu”). <i>Bikurei Yaakov</i> 651:32 states that this custom should not be annulled.

                    "The seventh day of Sukkot is also known as Hoshana Rabba. It is an especially significant day because on Sukkot, God renders judgment about how much water there will be during the upcoming year, so on the seventh day of Sukkot, the final verdict is sealed. Since all plant, animal, and human life depends upon water, on this last day of judgment, we multiply our pleas of “<i>hosha na</i>” (“please save”) to God. On this day, we take <i>aravot</i> (sometimes called <i>hoshanot</i>), because they require more water than the other species, and it is easily discernable when they dry out. The Sages made sure that Hoshana Rabba never falls on Shabbat, so that we have the opportunity to plead and cry out for water (<i>Roke’aḥ</i> §221).",
                    "Just as water sustains physical life, the Torah sustains the life of the spirit. In the words of the Sages, “Water refers to Torah” (<i>Bava Kamma</i> 17a). Accordingly, the judgment concerning water on Hoshana Rabba includes judgment about human life in its entirety, the physical and the spiritual. This is the meaning of <i>Zohar</i>’s statement that there are three times of judgment: Rosh Ha-shana, Yom Kippur, and Hoshana Rabba (<i>Zohar</i> II 142a). Similarly, there is a tradition that God told Avraham, “If your children are not forgiven on Rosh Ha-shana, they will be forgiven on Yom Kippur; and if not on Yom Kippur, then on Hoshana Rabba” (<i>Mateh Moshe</i> §957; <i>Kaf Ha-ḥayim</i> 664:2).",
                    "This is also expressed in another way: Even though verdicts are recorded (“written”) on Rosh Ha-shana and finalized (“sealed”) on Yom Kippur, the directive to execute the verdict takes place only on Hoshana Rabba. This can be compared to a human court. Even after a verdict has been handed down, if it has not yet been written in an execution order and conveyed to the agents of justice responsible for carrying it out, it is still possible to work for its reversal. This is the idea of Hoshana Rabba, when each verdict is written on an execution order, or “<i>petek</i>,” and given to messengers to convey to the angels in charge of carrying it out. Until then, it is still possible to reverse the judgment, as the execution orders have not yet been written and sent out with couriers. Therefore, it is appropriate to repent on Hoshana Rabba (<i>Zohar</i> III 31b). Furthermore, even after the verdict is conveyed to the angels on Hoshana Rabba, they are not permitted to carry it out until the end of Shemini Atzeret. Therefore, repentance is still effective in reversing or improving one’s verdict until then (<i>Zohar</i> I 220a and II 142a; <i>Sha’ar Ha-kavanot</i>, <i>Derushei Ḥag Ha-Sukkot</i>, pp. 314-316).",

There is a pious custom to stay awake all night studying Torah on Hoshana Rabba, to repair and purify the soul before judgment is final. Some have the custom to read the entire Torah on this night (<i>Shibolei Ha-leket</i> §371).

                    "In addition to the Torah’s commandment to take <i>aravot</i> as one of the four species (4:1 above), there is another mitzva, which originates as <i>halakha le-Moshe mi-Sinai</i>, to bring long <i>aravot</i> branches to the Temple and stand them next to the altar with their tops bent over onto the altar. When the <i>aravot</i> were brought, the <i>kohanim</i> sounded a <i>teki’a</i>-<i>teru’a</i>-<i>teki’a</i> blast on the shofar. This was done on each day of Sukkot except for Shabbat. However, if Hoshana Rabba coincided with Shabbat, it was done, because the main significance of the mitzva of <i>arava</i> was on this day. To avoid Shabbat desecration, the <i>aravot</i> were picked before Shabbat and left in golden vases filled with water to prevent their withering. Then, on Shabbat, the <i>kohanim</i> would simply stand up the <i>aravot</i> next to the altar (<i>Sukka</i> 45a).<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Technically, the concern for Shabbat desecration was only regarding the <i>lulav</i>. Since everyone fulfilled that mitzva, there was reason to be concerned that some people would end up carrying the <i>lulav</i> 4 <i>amot</i> in the public domain. In contrast, the mitzva to bring <i>aravot</i> to the altar, which was <i>halakha le-Moshe mi-Sinai</i>, was fulfilled by the <i>kohanim</i> in the Temple. Even the custom later established by the prophets for everyone everywhere to take <i>aravot</i> would not have led to a concern about Shabbat desecration, since the <i>gabbai</i> would have brought the <i>aravot</i> to the synagogue before Shabbat. And there was no reason to be concerned that people would desecrate Shabbat by carrying the <i>aravot</i> to ask if they were kosher for use, since there was no concern that they are invalid. Nevertheless, if the <i>arava</i> ritual had been done in the Temple on Shabbat, it might have led people to mistakenly conclude that the mitzva of <i>arava</i>, which is not explicit in the Torah, was more important than the mitzva of <i>lulav</i>, which is explicit in the Torah, so they did not perform the <i>arava</i> ritual on Shabbat (<i>Sukka</i> 44a). Hoshana Rabba, though, was different. If it was on Shabbat, the mitzva of <i>arava</i> was practiced in the Temple. This way, everyone would be aware that it carried the significance of <i>halakha le-Moshe mi-Sinai</i>, and from a certain perspective it is considered a mitzva from the Torah (<i>Sukka</i> 43b).</i>",
                    "Extending this practice, the prophets instituted that <i>aravot</i> be taken not only in the Temple, but by Jews everywhere. They also instituted that the <i>aravot</i> are beaten. After the destruction, the Jews continued this custom in commemoration of the Temple. Even though in Temple times they took <i>aravot</i> every day, after the destruction it became the custom to do so on one day only. The seventh day was chosen, as it had been the primary day for the mitzva in the Temple, when they circled the altar seven times. According to the kabbalists, there is a hidden link between the mitzva of <i>arava</i> and the seventh day.",
                    "The mitzva of <i>arava</i> is so important that according to some Amora’im, after the destruction, when the Sanhedrin was still sanctifying each month, it avoided declaring Rosh Ha-shana on Sunday, so that Hoshana Rabba would never be on Shabbat, and people would always be able to take the <i>aravot</i> (<i>Sukka</i> 43b). Likewise, when the last <i>Sanhedrin</i> in Eretz Yisrael fixed the Jewish calendar as we know it, they made sure that Hoshana Rabba would never fall on Shabbat (Ran; <i>Levush</i>; see <i>Peninei Halakha: Zemanim</i> 1:3).",
                    "It would seem, at first glance, that since an <i>arava</i> has neither taste nor smell, it represents the simplest Jew, who has neither Torah nor good deeds. The Torah commands us to bundle the <i>aravot</i> with the other species in order to protect this type of Jew (<i>Vayikra Rabba</i> 30:12; 4:2-3 above). Given this, we may ask: Why take the <i>arava</i> on its own? Clearly, the <i>arava</i> has another dimension. Precisely because it lacks both taste and smell, it represents the penitent, who is aware of his limited value and many deficiencies, and who realizes that God alone can help him. From this perspective, a penitent is closer to God than someone who is completely righteous. The latter has earned his right to exist in the merit of his good deeds; he does not need special help from heaven. In contrast, a penitent is aware that he is totally dependent upon God, Who extends a hand to him despite his sins and accepts his repentance. This connects him to God more profoundly. Of this, the Sages declared: “Where penitents stand, even completely righteous people cannot stand” (<i>Berakhot</i> 34b).",
                    "By the time Hoshana Rabba arrives, after we have already done our best to repent, praying extensively on Rosh Ha-shana and Yom Kippur, we now approach God to humbly ask for help. We take the <i>aravot</i> to show that, like penitents, we know that our salvation is dependent upon God alone. Perhaps this is why the <i>aravot</i> are called <i>hoshanot</i>, which allude to our repeated plea to God to “save us.” For if we deserve to be saved, it is in the merit of the humility that they represent. The custom of beating the <i>aravot</i> also expresses our willingness to disregard ourselves and our evil inclination in order to serve God wholeheartedly."

If he completed the <i>Amida</i> before realizing his mistake, some say that <i>be-di’avad</i> he has fulfilled his obligation, since in some ways Shemini Atzeret is a part of Sukkot (<i>Beit Yehuda</i>, OḤ §4; <i>Ḥayei Adam</i> 28:15).

                    "<i>Zohar</i> (III 104b) presents a third variation on the analogy. All throughout Sukkot, Israel offered sacrifices on behalf of the seventy nations. Shemini Atzeret, though, is the King’s day to celebrate exclusively with Israel. It can be compared to a king who invited guests. Everyone in the palace worked on their behalf. Later on, the king said to them, “Thus far, you and I have made efforts on behalf of all the guests. You have brought all these offerings for the seventy nations. Now we will celebrate for one day, just us.” This is the meaning of: “On the eighth day you shall hold a joyous gathering <b>for yourselves</b>” – these offerings are for you.",

Rabbi Avin asked: [The Hebrew word <i>bo</i> is ambiguous, so] we do not know whether to rejoice on the day or to rejoice in God. King Shlomo came and resolved it: ‘Let us delight and rejoice in You’ (Shir Ha-shirim 1:4) – in You, through Your Torah; in You through Your salvation…” (<i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Pinḥas §782).",

                    "The word “<i>atzeret</i>” derives from “<i>atzara</i>,” a gathering, for on this day, we gather together to bid farewell to the annual holiday cycle. This cycle begins with Pesaḥ, when we left Egypt, continues to Shavu’ot, when we were given the Torah, goes on to Rosh Ha-shana and Yom Kippur, times of remembrance, repentance, and atonement, and culminates with Sukkot, the Festival of Ingathering, when we gather in all the physical and spiritual fruits of the year and rejoice in them, thus spreading joy and blessing throughout the world. On Shemini Atzeret, which wraps everything up, we have a farewell get-together. “This can be compared to a king who invited his children to a party that was scheduled for a certain amount of time. When the time for departure arrived, he said, ‘My children, please stay with me for one more day. Saying goodbye is hard for me” (Rashi on Vayikra 23:36).",
                    "From this perspective, it is appropriate to be happier on Shemini Atzeret than on any other holiday. It is on this day, which concludes the yearly cycle of uplifting holidays, that we reach the pinnacle of closeness and connection to God. The joy we experience on Shemini Atzeret does not hinge on a specific mitzva, such as the <i>sukka</i> or four species, but stems from the very fact that we are God’s children and people. Thus, the Vilna Gaon says that the mitzva is to rejoice in God exclusively, as it is written, “You shall have nothing but joy” (Devarim 16:15). It is told that the Vilna Gaon rejoiced greatly on Sukkot and was even more joyful on Shemini Atzeret, because, according to esoteric teachings of the Torah, it is the happiest day of all (<i>Ma’aseh Rav</i> §233).",
                    "In this festive farewell get-together, when we draw especially close to God, He gave us the opportunity to permanently conserve and preserve in our souls forever all the illumination that we absorbed over the previous year. This makes it possible for us to continue to ascend in the upcoming year. There is another holiday that the Torah calls an <i>atzeret</i>, namely the seventh day of Pesaḥ: “You shall hold a joyous gathering (<i>atzeret</i>) for the Lord your God on the seventh day” (Devarim 16:8). It is described as an <i>atzeret</i> <b>for God</b> because all the light we gather and absorb during Pesaḥ we give back to God to guard it for us, as we are not yet on the level to permanently store it within us. But six months later on Shemini Atzeret, after completing all the year’s festivals, we have reached a point where we can store within ourselves, forever, all the light and goodness that we absorbed during the year. Thus, it is written: “On the eighth day you shall hold a joyous gathering (<i>atzeret</i>) <b>for yourselves</b>.” (See <i>Peninei Halakha: Moadim</i> 13:6 for why Shavu’ot is also called <i>Atzeret</i>.)",
                    "The eighth day is fitting for this celebration, as this world, the natural world, is linked with the number seven. It was created in seven days, and everything in it is temporary and finite. In order to store all of the goodness and divine illumination that manifests in it, we must sanctify ourselves and ascend to a level beyond nature and time, a level that is linked to the number eight. The power of this level that is beyond nature makes it possible to improve the world. We are similarly commanded to perform a <i>brit mila</i>, which improves upon nature, on the eighth day, for the covenant is eternal, beyond nature and time. God also gave us the eternal Torah on an “eighth day” of sorts – the day after we finished counting seven weeks of seven days. For this reason, it is appropriate to associate Simḥat Torah with Shemini Atzeret, the holiday correlated with the number eight (Maharal, <i>Tiferet Yisrael</i> ch. 2)."

                    "Rain brings water to the world, allowing all plants, animals, and people to survive. Therefore, it is proper to praise God and pray to Him for beneficial rain. The Sages thus instituted two mentions of rain into the <i>Amida</i>, to be recited during the rainy season, between Sukkot and Pesaḥ.

This invocation is called “<i>hazkarat geshamim</i>” (“the mention of rain”).

For those who follow this custom, the <i>gabbai</i> must declare loudly, before the silent <i>Amida</i>: “<i>Mashiv ha-ru’aḥ u-morid ha-geshem</i>!” By virtue of this announcement, the congregants recite this phrase during their silent <i>Amida</i>, even though they have not yet recited <i>Tefilat Geshem</i>.",

In Eretz Yisrael, this is the same day as Shemini Atzeret, whereas outside of Eretz Yisrael, Simḥat Torah is the day after Shemini Atzeret.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Talmudic times, there were two customs governing the weekly Torah reading. In Eretz Yisrael, the Torah was completed every three years, whereas in Babylonia, it was completed every year. Additionally, since Babylonia is outside of Eretz Yisrael, Jewish communities there kept a second day of Yom Tov. It was ordained by Ezra that the <i>Tokhaḥa</i>, the curses of <i>Parashat Ki Tavo</i> (Devarim 28), be read during the weeks leading up to Rosh Ha-shana (<i>Megila</i> 31b). Since the <i>Tokhaḥa</i> is just before the end of the Torah, the custom emerged in Babylonia to divide the remainder of the Torah into four <i>parshiyot</i>, so that the Torah would be completed each year on the second day of Shemini Atzeret, which thus became known as Simḥat Torah. Over time, the Babylonian custom came to predominate, and by the end of the Geonic era, all Jewish communities – even the communities of Eretz Yisrael – completed the annual reading of the Torah each year on Simḥat Torah (MT, Laws of Prayer 13:1).<br>In order to ensure that the Torah is completed each year on Simḥat Torah, there is some built-in flexibility regarding how the <i>parshiyot</i> are broken up. For instance, leap years have four more <i>Shabbatot</i> than regular years, and when Yom Tov coincides with Shabbat, the Torah reading for Yom Tov takes precedence, so there is a varying number of <i>Shabbatot</i> on which the regular Torah reading takes place. Finally, certain <i>parshiyot</i> are linked with certain times of the year: <i>Parashat Beḥukotai</i> is read before Shavu’ot, <i>Parashat Ki Tavo</i>, as noted, is read before Rosh Ha-shana, and so forth. To keep the Torah reading cycle “on schedule,” certain <i>parshiyot</i> are doubled up.</i>",

To this end, the first five <i>aliyot</i> are read over and over, until everyone present has been called up, except for the four people who will be called up later: two for the last two <i>aliyot</i>, one for the beginning of Bereishit, and one for <i>maftir</i>.",

However, if it would be obvious that a mourner is avoiding the dancing (as in the case of a rabbi whom people always dance with, or one whose dancing usually stands out), he may dance, for if he does not do so, it will look like he is mourning on Yom Tov. (<i>Minḥat Yitzḥak</i> 6:62 gives this as the reason to be lenient in the case of the rabbi.) It would seem that if people from different communities pray together, an Ashkenazi who wants to rely on the Sephardic practice may do so. I also heard from my father and teacher, Rav Zalman Baruch Melamed, that there are grounds for leniency when it can reasonably be assumed that the parents would not want their child to miss out on Simḥat Torah because of them, since all the customs of mourning parents are to honor them.</i>",
                    "It is customary for women and children to come to synagogue in honor of Simḥat Torah. Some say that there is a certain similarity between Simḥat Torah and the mitzva of <i>Hak’hel</i>, which took place on Sukkot every seven years. (See chapter 8 below.) Just as all Israel assembled to hear the king read the Torah, so too all Israel assembles to honor the Torah.",
                    "Many Torah giants would dance their hearts out on Simḥat Torah. It is told of the Vilna Gaon: He was very happy on Sukkot, and even happier on Shemini Atzeret, because it is the happiest time of all according to esoteric teachings.... He would march before the Torah scroll joyously and energetically, his face alight with wisdom like a burning torch. He clapped and twirled and leapt with all his might before the Torah scroll. The song leaders would sing a verse, and he would repeat after them…. (<i>Ma’aseh Rav</i> §233; see <i>Harḥavot</i>)",
                    "Some do not stand on their dignity during the dancing. They are following the example of King David. When he escorted the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem, he wore his best clothing, made with links of gold; he danced and leapt with all his might before the Ark, kicking his legs high, even exposing himself a bit, while the gold links of his clothing clanked and jingled (<i>Bamidbar Rabba</i> 4:20). When his wife, Michal the daughter of King Shaul, saw this, she was disgusted with him. When he returned home, she greeted him with rebuke, because she felt he had degraded the honor of the monarchy by acting like riffraff in the presence of his slaves and maidservants. King David responded that he was not dancing for his honor. Rather, he danced “before the Lord, Who chose me instead of your father and all his family, and appointed me ruler over the Lord’s people Israel! I will dance before the Lord and dishonor myself even more, and be low in my own esteem, but among the maidservants that you speak of I will be honored” (2 Shmuel 6:21-22).",
                    "It is said that anyone who dances and rejoices with all his might in honor of the Torah is guaranteed that the Torah will not be alien to his descendants (Rabbi Yisrael Yaakov<b></b> Algazi, <i>Shalmei Ḥagiga</i> 17:16). Others say that all of our imperfect prayers and supplications, which could not ascend to heaven during the year and even during the Days of Awe, now ascend and are well received thanks to our dancing on Simḥat Torah (Rabbi Shalom Rokeach, the first Belzer Rebbe). It is also said that the holy Arizal attained the highest levels of insight into the esoteric aspects of the Torah because he rejoiced with all his might when performing <i>mitzvot</i> (MB 669:11)."

Sections of the Torah that encourage faith, reverence, Torah study, and mitzva observance are then read to them, as it is written: And Moses instructed them as follows: Every seventh year, at the time of the <i>Shemita</i> year, at the Festival of Sukkot, when all Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God in the place that He will choose, you shall read this Torah aloud in the presence of all Israel. Assemble (<i>Hak’hel</i>) the people – men, women, children, and the strangers in your communities – that they may hear and so learn to revere the Lord your God and to observe faithfully every word of this Torah. Their children, too, who have not had the experience, shall hear and learn to revere the Lord your God as long as they live, in the land that you are about to cross the Jordan to possess. (Devarim 31:10-13)",

There was no grander, more impressive event than this, in which all of Israel participated – young and old, men and women, and most esteemed of all, the king, who would read from the Torah to the people. This spurred everyone to ask: What is the point of this large assembly? The answer was self-evident: “To hear the words of Torah, which is our foundation, our glory, and our grandeur. This would lead them to speak its great praises and its esteemed glory. They would all be implanted with desire for it, and from this desire they would learn to know God, earn the ultimate goodness, and God would be pleased with their actions” (<i>Sefer Ha-ḥinukh</i> §612).",
                    "Every participant benefited greatly from <i>Hak’hel</i>. Those able to study Torah in depth were inspired to increase their study. Those able to listen and understand were inspired to listen avidly to the Torah’s words and to live by them. Children who were old enough to understand listened to the words, and the sanctity of the occasion inspired and encouraged them to study Torah and keep <i>mitzvot</i>. As for those children who were too young to understand, their souls absorbed the tremendous value and incomparable importance of Torah, when they saw that everyone was gathering together to hear it. Their parents were inspired too, recognizing the monumental mission incumbent upon them: to educate their children to Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> (Ramban on Devarim 31:12-13; Maharal, <i>Gur Aryeh</i>, <i>ad loc</i>.; see <i>Harḥavot</i>).",

This is followed by a lengthy section about the revelation at Sinai and the prohibition of idol worship, and an admonition to future generations to keep Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> and teach them to their children. As a reward, they will endure in the land. The first selection concludes with <i>Shema</i> (<i>ibid</i>. 6:4-9), which expresses the foundation of faith and includes the commandment to love God.",

Based on the phrase “when all Israel comes,” the Sages extrapolate that the verse refers to the beginning of the festival, as that was when everyone came to Jerusalem (<i>Sota</i> 41a). However, the Sages did not want to hold the assembly on the first day of the festival, because that day is Yom Tov, and it would be forbidden to erect the platform on which the king stood. Putting it up before the festival was not a good option either, because that would have led to crowding in the Temple courtyard when everyone came to offer sacrifices. Therefore, <i>Hak’hel</i> was postponed until right after the first Yom Tov (Rashi). Alternatively, it can be derived from the verse’s use of the word “<i>ba-mo’ed</i>” (translated above “at the time”), which can be understood to mean “in the festival,” that <i>Hak’hel</i> took place in the middle of the festival, not at the very beginning (<i>Tosafot</i>).",
                    "Some say that <i>Hak’hel</i> took place at night, right after the first Yom Tov (<i>Tiferet Yisrael</i>). Others maintain that it took place the next day, on the first day of <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i> (Aderet).",
                    "The <i>Hak’hel</i> assembly put the stamp of sanctity on the concluding <i>Shemita</i> cycle. The gathering of the entire nation then to hear the Torah conveyed a powerful message: everything connected to Torah has eternal value, while everything else is eventually lost and forgotten. This message strengthened and enlightened Israel to continue following the Torah’s ways for the next seven-year cycle.",
                    "Since <i>Hak’hel</i> took place on a pilgrimage festival, the Sages derived from a <i>gezera shava</i> that men who are exempt from making the pilgrimage and offering the festival sacrifices (<i>Peninei Halakha: Mo’adim</i> 1:15) are also exempt from <i>Hak’hel</i>. Therefore, the deaf, mute, blind, lame, and <i>tamei</i> are exempt from <i>Hak’hel</i>, as are slaves. Elderly and sick men unable to walk from Jerusalem to the Temple Mount are exempt as well. However, women are obligated in <i>Hak’hel</i> even though they are not obligated to make the pilgrimage.",

                    "In preparation for the assembly, the <i>kohanim</i> walked through Jerusalem blowing trumpets to gather everyone to the Temple Mount. A large wooden platform was erected in the middle of the women’s courtyard. The king ascended and sat there so that everyone could hear and see him as he read (MT, <i>op. cit.</i> 3:4). If he wanted to honor the Torah by standing up during the reading, this was deemed praiseworthy. (See <i>Tosafot</i> on <i>Sota</i> 41a, s.v. “mitzva.”)<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the Gemara, the event took place in the women’s courtyard (<i>Sota</i> 41a). The Tosefta (<i>t. Sota</i> 7:8) also records the view of R. Eliezer b. Yaakov that it took place on the Temple Mount. Rambam writes that <i>Hak’hel</i> took place in the women’s courtyard (MT, <i>op. cit.</i> 3:4). This would seem to be problematic, since the women’s courtyard was too small for the entire nation to assemble there. R. Yisrael Ariel writes that the women’s courtyard could hold, at most, 10,000 people. This leads him to conclude that generally there was not a very big crowd, and the mitzva could be fulfilled in the women’s courtyard. But when the crowds were larger, <i>Hak’hel</i> was held on the Temple Mount, in accordance with the view of R. Eliezer ben Yaakov (<i>Maḥzor Ha-Mikdash</i>, Sukkot volume).<br>This leads to another question: How could all the people assembled hear the king without a microphone? Perhaps in the women’s courtyard, which was closed off, 10,000 people could hear the king if his voice was strong. But if there were more than that, they would not have been able to hear him for such a long reading. Evidently, it was not necessary for everyone to hear him. This idea is supported by the requirement for the hard of hearing to attend (<i>Leḥem Mishneh</i> on MT, <i>Ḥagiga</i> 3:6). Even though they would not have been able to hear, they were expected to be there and imagine that God was issuing these commands at that moment. If this is correct, we may conclude that the <i>halakha</i> follows the opinion of the Sages (and Rambam) that the event took place in the women’s courtyard. Ten thousand people were there, and the rest of the nation stood on the Temple Mount. Even though an individual might not hear, he still completely fulfilled the mitzva. Alternatively, according to <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Ḥagiga</i> 3a s.v. “af”), the mitzva does require each and every person to hear, which leaves open the question of how the masses could fulfill the mitzva. In any case, people in the future Temple will certainly fulfill the obligation, because the king will be able to use a microphone. See <i>Peninei Halakha: Berakhot</i> 12:9 n. 8.</i>",
                    "To honor the Torah and the king, the people assembled would pass the Torah scroll from person to person until it reached the king. The attendant of the synagogue on the Temple Mount took the scroll and gave it to the head of the synagogue, who passed it to the Deputy Kohen Gadol, who gave it to the Kohen Gadol, who passed it to the king. The king accepted the Torah scroll while standing (<i>Sota</i> 41a; MT, <i>op. cit.</i> 3:4).",

                    "In recent times, the great of rabbis have encouraged the Jews of Eretz Yisrael to hold a commemoration of this precious mitzva, to honor the Torah and commemorate the Temple. We have learned that the Sages enacted several ordinances to commemorate Temple practices. They derived the impetus for these commemorations from a verse: “But I will bring healing to you and cure you of your wounds, declares the Lord. Though they called you ‘Outcast, that Zion whom no one seeks out’” (Yirmiyahu 30:17). The Gemara elaborates: “whom no one seeks out” implies that we should seek Zion and remember it. Doing so will help it heal (<i>Rosh Ha-shana</i> 30a).",
                    "All agree that there is no way to fulfill the mitzva of <i>Hak’hel</i> nowadays, because it is linked to the mitzva of making a pilgrimage to the Temple for the festival, as it is written: “At the Festival of Sukkot, when all Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God in the place that He will choose” (Devarim 31:10-11). As long as the Temple is in ruins and it is impossible to offer the festival sacrifices, the mitzva of making the pilgrimage does not apply (<i>Peninei Halakha: Mo’adim</i> 1:16). The Sages derived this from a <i>gezera shava</i>, as the Torah speaks of “appearing” in the context of both <i>mitzvot</i> (<i>Ḥagiga</i> 3a). Rambam codifies this succinctly: “All who are exempt from the pilgrimage are exempt from <i>Hak’hel</i>, except for women and children…” (MT, <i>op. cit.</i> 3:2).",
                    "Nevertheless, the greatest of rabbis considered it important to make a nationwide commemoration of <i>Hak’hel</i>, especially in our generation, as the Jewish people continue to gather in its land. The first person to put forth this idea was R. Eliyahu David Rabinowitz-Teomim, “the Aderet,” who composed a booklet called <i>Zekher Le-Mikdash</i> and then moved to Jerusalem at the end of his life to serve as its chief rabbi. His son-in-law, our master Rav Kook, supported the idea as well, but neither of them lived to see it happen. Other rabbis who were in favor of a <i>Hak’hel</i> commemoration included R. Yeḥiel Michel Tikochinsky (<i>Ir Ha-kodesh Ve-hamikdash</i> 4:15) and two chief rabbis of Israel – R. Yitzḥak Ha-Levi Herzog and R. Ben-Zion Uziel – as well as R. Yaakov Moshe Charlap and R. Zvi Yehuda Kook. Two rabbis who worked hard to turn it into a reality were R. Shlomo David Kahana, who served for decades as the head of the Warsaw <i>beit din</i> and later as Chief Rabbi of the Old City of Jerusalem, and his son, R. Dr. Shmuel Zanvil Kahana, who served for two decades as the Director General of Israel’s Ministry for Religious Services. It was during his tenure there he organized the <i>Hak’hel</i> commemoration.",
                    "In 1945, after the Holocaust and before the founding of the State of Israel, the initiative of these rabbis came to fruition, and the first <i>Hak’hel</i> commemoration took place, with the participation of the chief rabbis and other leading rabbis. It was organized by the cultural division of Hapoel Hamizrachi, a political party of Religious Zionist workers. Every seven years since then, at the end of every <i>Shemita</i>, there has been a <i>Hak’hel</i> commemoration. The one exception was in 1973, at the height of the Yom Kippur War, when the men had been called up to fight and risk their lives to protect the land and its people. In 1987 there was an especially impressive <i>Hak’hel</i> commemoration, led by Chief Rabbis R. Avraham Shapira and R. Mordechai Eliyahu. Tens of thousands gathered at the Kotel and the porches overlooking it. The Western Wall Plaza was filled to capacity, and the crowds overflowed into the alleyways. The event was broadcast live on TV. The President of Israel, Chaim Herzog, participated in the reading, along with the chief rabbis. Many of the country’s luminaries participated in the ceremony, including the Prime Minister, many other ministers, and the President of the Supreme Court. Ever since then, at the end of each <i>Shemita</i> on the first day of <i>Ḥol Ha-mo’ed</i>, a <i>Hak’hel</i> commemoration takes place at the Kotel, drawing huge crowds and bringing great honor to God and His Torah.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See R. Yehuda Zoldan’s article “<i>Le-toldot ‘Zekher La-Hak’hel’</i>” in the collection <i>Sefer Hak’hel</i> (pp. 653-678). Some Ḥaredi rabbis were opposed to a <i>Hak’hel</i> commemoration. Their reasoning was similar to the reason for their opposition to settling Eretz Yisrael and establishing the State of Israel – fear of breaking with tradition – which was popularly expressed in the proverb, “Anything new is prohibited by the Torah.” Since their position does not have a strong halakhic basis, most of the great rabbis dismissed it. See R. Yehuda Amichai’s article “<i>Takanot Zekher La-Mikdash</i>” in that collection (pp. 606-617), where he puts forth the thesis that anywhere the Temple can be commemorated, it should be done, as long as there will not be negative halakhic consequences.<br>Should a <i>berakha</i> be recited on a commemoration of the Temple? If a mitzva still applies after the Temple’s destruction (such as the <i>lulav</i>, where there is a mitzva everywhere to take it on the first day, even without the Temple), and the Sages expanded its scope as a commemoration of the Temple (ordaining that the <i>lulav</i> be taken everywhere during the rest of the festival as well), a <i>berakha</i> is recited on the commemoration. In contrast, if there is no mitzva remaining after the destruction, then its commemoration is performed without a <i>berakha</i> (as would seem to be the case with the mitzva of <i>Hak’hel</i>, which applies only when the Temple stands). Nevertheless, R. Herzog, in his article “<i>Hatza’ot Le-ma’amad Zekher Le-Hak’hel</i> 5713” tentatively presents a halakhic justification for the Torah reader at the <i>Hak’hel</i> commemoration to recite the <i>berakhot</i> that are normally said before and after an <i>aliya</i> (p. 620 in that collection). R. Ovadia Yosef gives his support to the custom of commemorating <i>Hak’hel</i> but says not to recite <i>berakhot</i> (<i>Yabi’a Omer</i>, YD 10:22). This was also the position of the other chief rabbis.</i>"
