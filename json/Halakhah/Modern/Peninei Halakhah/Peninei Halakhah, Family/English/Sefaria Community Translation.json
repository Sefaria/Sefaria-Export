The commandment of honoring father and mother connects us to all of the generations of the past; whereas the parents' education of [their] children connects them to all of the future generations. Through the education that they grant their children, they will be connected to continuity, to their grandchildren, their great-grandchildren and their children, to the end of all the generations.",
                    "With these two commandments, the Torah guides us to uplift our lives towards eternity and to connect to all generations through our individual lifespans. By honoring parents, we draw upon and learn from the wisdom and experience of previous generations. And through the commandment of educating [our] children, we bequeath and grant everything that we have learned, augmented by our own personal contribution. And so through the short and fleeting present, we succeed in connecting to eternity; with the generations that have passed and with the generations that are still to come. "

And so our sages said that Yaakov our Father was punished through his son Yosef abandoning him for 22 years, because he himself abandoned his parents and went to Haran for 22 years. And even though Yaakov was compelled to flee his brother, who wanted to kill him, and did this because his parents commanded him to; due to the fact that nevertheless he did not honor his parents during that many years, and also due to the fact that he did not return quickly when he was able to, he was punished. Despite all this, for the needs of studying Torah a person can leave their parents: we find that Yaakov our Father went to the house of study of Shem and Ever, and learned there for 14 years, and was not punished for that (see Megilah 17a)."

                    "(2) One of the saddest questions regarding honoring parents is what should one behave towards parents whose awareness has been taken from them?",
                    "(3) Answer: Even if the parents do not have awareness anymore, one should never disgrace them,and one should always try to behave towards them with honor and love according to their ability, until heavens have pity on them. And if the parents loose their minds completely to the point that the child cannot see them in that state, and whenever they see each other the child gets to a state of anger and fighting, if it is possible for the parent to be left in another place and be taken care properly by others, this is preferable.",
                    "(4) An example is brought in the Talmud (Kiddushin 31b): Rabbi Asi had an old mother who became senile. She asked for jewellery, and he bought it for her. After some time she wanted to marry, and entreated him that he should find a match for her. And even though he could not find a groom for such elderly and senile woman, Rabbi Asi would always answer that he would make an effort to find one. However, when she began demanding that he should find a groom that was exactly like him, young, kasher and handsome, Rabbi Asi could not stand to see her like this, and left the place where she lived.",
                    "(5) And this is provided that the parents can take care of themselves. Meaning, they can feed and clothe themselves, and do all their needs to proper exist, and only their awareness is diminished, and whenever they see their child they make strange requests and the child can't stand seeing them like this. However, when parents are so weakened, whether in body or in mind, that they cannot take care of themselves, it is forbidden to abandon them. Rather, if the child has money enough, the child should pay another person to take care of the parents, or make arrangements in for a nursing home. And if a nursing home won't take them, and if the child has no financial ability to pay a caregiver, the child should give care to their parents, and through maximal efforts to behave towards them with patience and pleasantness. (Shulchan Aruch Yoreh De'ah 240:10; Taz on the Shulchan Aruch 240:14; Aruch HaShulchan, Yoreh De'ah 240:32)."

                    "(1) Honoring Parents /Attitudes of parents towards children, no hitting",
                    "(2) Even though the mitzvah of honoring parents is very important, the Shulchan Aruch wrote (Yoreh De'ah 240:19): \"It is forbidden [for the parent] to make their yoke heavy upon their children and to be exacting with them about their honor, so as not create a hindrance for the children. Rather the parent should forgive and avert their eyes from them; since a parent who foregoes their honor, their honor is forgiven.\"",
                    "(3) Maybe from the side of judgment the parents could demand more honor from their children, but this will not help. No positive result comes from this, parents that always complain that their children do not honor them enough. On the contrary, children love to honor their parents willingly from love, and not from being forced. Thoughtfulness towards children's honor and needs is what contributes for children honoring their parents in great measure.",
                    "(4) Aside from that, a parent who forgoes their honor has their honor forgiven. That is to say, in the instance that parents concede that the child shouldn't devote themselves to the honor of the parents, the child is exempt. It is understood that when the parents concede, if the child honors them the child fulfills the mitzvah, but if the child does not, the child has not transgressed. And are there parents who would want their children to be punished because of the sin of not honoring the parents?!",
                    "(5) The most successful way to educate children to honor their parents is when they see a personal example, how do the parents honor their own parents. And someone who is negligent with their parents while they are still alive should not be surprised when their own children do not honor them; and when they need help, that the children do not help them - they learned this from the parents.",
                    "(6) In the past, in the case of a parent who hit their grown children, even if the parent's actions were completely righteous, the beit din would punish and ostracize the parent, since the parent transgressed the prohibition of \"do not put a stumbling block in front of the blind\" (Leviticus 19:14), since obviously the child will be angry and bear a grudge, and even return a double portion (see Shulchan Aruch Yoreh De'ah 240:20, see above 1:3 and 1:16 regarding the seriousness of not hitting parents).",
                    "(7) Even though in the past good parents would educate their children also with physical punishments, and even though it is written \"He who spares the rod hates his son\" (Proverbs 13:24), and even though the sages said \"one who holds back from hitting their children, at the end [the children] will go to a bad culture and the parent will hate them\" (Shemot Rabbah 1:1) nowadays one should be sparing in physical punishment."

                    "(1) Honoring parents / Evil parents",
                    "(2) Question: Does the mitzvah of honoring parents apply to parents who are evil, who transgress constantly, or maybe there is the case of parents who destroyed their virtues so much that the children are exempt from honoring them?",
                    "(3) Answer: The halachic decisors have been divided in this question. (SA 240:18) According to the author of the Shulchan Aruch, Rabbi Yosef Karo, even if the parent is a transgressor the child is still obligated to honor and fear the parent. Not only that, even if the child is a mamzer, meaning, the parent conceived the child by transgressing the prohibition against adultery, and through this rendered the child defective, making it impossible for the child to ever marry a Jewish person,  even in this case the child is obligated to honor their evil parent, meaning, to honor and support the parent in times of old age, when the parent needs help.",
                    "(4) On the other hand, according to Rabbi Moshe Isserles, (the Ram\"a), who authored the glosses on the Shulchan Aruch, there is no mitzvah for a child to honor their evil parent, since all the mitzvot of the Torah regarding honoring parents apply to regular parents, who are not evil, but the Torah would not command someone to honor evil people. And one should make clear that the evil parent spoken of is a person who clings to evil actions and sins aplenty, hurts and insults intentionally other people, or transgresses just to cause others to anger. But regular people, who sometimes stumble and sin, it is clear that the mitzvah of honoring and fearing them applies. And even in the case where everyone sees and understands that the parent is evil, and according to the Ram\"a there is no mitzvah of honoring and fearing such a person, it is forbidden for the child to insult the parent or cause any harm.",
                    "(5) Every so often those who return [ba'alei teshuvah] make the mistake to think that they do not owe their parents any honor, given that their parents are secular. However the halakha is, in our times, that every person that behaves properly and decently, even if they do not observe mitzvot, is not considered evil, and obviously the mitzvah of honoring and fearing them applies. And this is because in our times, most people who do not observe mitzvot don't do this out of spite, but due to the general atmosphere of the generation. Therefore, a ba'al teshuvah is obligated in honoring their parents, even though the parents are not observant."

                    "(2) There is the need, indeed, to distinguish between parents who are prone to loose their understanding and give in to anger, raising their children in an uncompromising rigid fashion, and yet whose basic intent is positive and between those who are cruel and behave in a sadistic form towards their children. To the first group, honoring and judging giving the benefit of doubt is due. However, sadistic behavior endangers body and soul, and therefore it is imperative to stop it. And we need to support and strengthen the child that suffers sadistic abuse, and make clear that this suffering has nothing to do with the child being guilty of anything. All the more so when we are speaking of sexual abuse. It is clear that we need to rescue such children from such expected dangers. (And it is important to be aware that there is also need to differentiate between disgusting and ugly behavior and sexual abuse, and there are those who err on this and create difficult problems.)",
                    "(3) Indeed, even in such a terrifying and complicated reality, one needs to find a way to give the evil parent the benefit of doubt, and explain to the child that the behaviors that the parent engages in are forbidden from the outset, and one should never ever repeat them, and yet that the parent seems to suffer from a condition or illness, whether physical or spiritual, and so the parent sinned. The more the child can understand that the parent that abused them is sick, the more the child will be able to make sense of the moments of kindness that the parent engaged as if the parent was a regular parent. The child will be able to remember fondly those moments, and they might form the basis of the child's strength for forming good and healthy bonds with their own future children."

                    "<b>The Marriage and the Ketuvah/<i>Irusin</i> (Betrothal) and <i>Nissuin</i> (Nuptials)</b>",
                    "The concept of marriage, together with all of its spiritual and legal significance, changed with the [giving of the] Torah. Before the giving of the Torah, the practice was that when a man and a woman met and they they agreed to come together, they would enter the man's house and begin married life without a wedding ceremony. Likewise were children born. There was also no formal divorce ceremony. Rather, when one of the spouses wanted to dissolve the connection between them, the spouse would separate and go their own way. Once the Torah was given to the Jewish people, we were commanded with a positive commandment, that if a man and a woman want to come together, they should do this with <i>kiddushin</i> (sanctification) and <i>chupah</i> (the wedding canopy). And likewise, divorce should be done with a divorce bill (<i>get</i>). (Rambam, Mishneh Torah, Laws of Marriage 1:1).",
                    "The wedding consists of two stages, <i>irusin</i> (betrothal) and <i>nissuin</i> (nuptials), which are <i>kiddushin</i> and <i>chupah</i>. Betrothal is <i>kiddushin</i> and nuptials are <i>chupah</i>. However, today people commonly call the party at which the couple celebrates their decision to get married (engagement), betrothal (<i>irusin</i>); and after this party, they call the bride and groom, betrothed. Yet according to Jewish law, they are not truly betrothed, but rather just engaged (<i>mesudakhim</i>); since betrothal is <i>kiddushin</i>, meaning the stage at which the groom sanctifies the relationship with the bride. Technically, the man can sanctify the relationship with his wife in three ways: With money, with a contract or with intercourse (Mishnah Kiddushin 1:1). However, in practice, everyone is accustomed to do the sanctification with the acquisition of money, which is done by the groom giving the bride a ring and saying the formula, \"Behold you are designated (<i>mekudeshet</i>) to me with this ring, according to the law of Moshe and Israel.\" From the betrothal onwards, the bride is considered a married woman; so if they want to separate, the groom will need to give the bride a bill of divorce. However even after the betrothal, it is forbidden for the groom and bride to begin living together. It is only permitted for them to live together after the nuptials which are performed by way of standing under a canopy and saying the seven blessings (of marriage).",
                    "In the past, it was customary to wait twelve months between the betrothal and the nuptials, meaning between <i>kiddushin</i> and <i>chupah</i>. During that year the couple would prepare for the wedding from an inner perspective, and also ready the house, the wedding banquet and their outfits. It is not difficult to pick up on the special beauty of the couple's prolonged one-year wait, during which they looked ahead and longed for the wedding day, on which they would begin to live together. That year would deepen the inner and spiritual connection between them.   ",
                    "But with the passage of time and exile, it became necessary to combine the betrothal and the nuptials. To begin with, there were cases in which the family of the bride or groom was forced to run away from where they lived between the betrothal and the nuptials, such that the couple remained bound to each other with the betrothal, but unable to fulfill that bond with the nuptials or to sever it with a bill of divorce. There were [also] cases in which the couple was not careful to remain chaste with one another between the betrothal and the nuptials. Due to these reasons, the Jewish people took on the custom to combine the time of the betrothal and the time of the nuptials and make it one, the wedding day. So during the wedding, we perform the betrothal - which is <i>kiddushin</i> with a ring; as well as the nuptials, by standing under the canopy."

                    "Alongside the joy of the wedding and the optimism that accompanies the couple, Jewish law did not forget to take a responsible and regulatory stance and concerned itself with the rights of the woman in the event that the marriage doesn't work out. It is for this reason that we write a ketuvah in which the groom obligates himself to give his wife a set amount of money in the event that they get divorced or that he dies before her, so that she can be sustained as a divorcee or a widow. And once we are already writing a ketuvah, the Sages added all of the other obligations that the Torah made incumbent upon the husband - to concern himself with his wife's provisions and with all of her needs - to the formula of the ketuvah. Hence it comes out that the ketuvah is a declaration of a woman's rights.",
                    "The ketuvah itself is written in the form of a declaration of the witnesses who testify about the obligation of the groom towards his bride. Since at the time of the ketuvah's formulation, during the Second Temple period, the spoken language was Aramaic - such that uneducated people knew Aramaic better than Hebrew - the Sages ordained that the formula of the ketuvah would be in Aramaic , so that all of the grooms and brides would understand what it was about. From then on, the formula was preserved even when Aramaic was no longer used as a spoken language. We will translate the part that itemizes the groom's obligations towards the bride into [English]: We testify that the groom, so and so the son of so and so, said to the bride, so and so the daughter of so and so, \"Be my wife, according to the law of Moses and Israel. And, with God's help, I will work to honor, feed, support, maintain and clothe you, according to the laws of Jewish men who faithfully support their wives. And behold I obligate myself to [provide] your food, clothing and needs and to have marital relations with you in the way of the whole world.\" Afterwards, they mention the value of the ketuvah which the groom obligates himself to give to the bride in the event that they get divorced. Then the witnesses conclude and declare, \"And the bride consented to the groom and became his wife.\"",
                    "One of the central functions of the ketuavh is to prevent unnecessary divorces. Since, as a result of an angry husband remembering the amount he would have to pay to his wife if he divorces her, he calms down and thinks, \"Perhaps it would be better to live with her peacefully and lovingly rather than having to pay for her ketuvah.\" It is as the Sages said (Ketuvot 39b), \"So that it not be easy in his eyes to cast her out.\" In order to ensure the wife's rights, Rabbi Shimon ben Shetach ordained that all of the husband's property be liable for the payment of the ketuvah. That is that even if the husband does not have cash at the time of the divorce, all of his properties are frozen, such that the value of the ketuvah is paid from there. This decree as well is aimed at preventing angry husbands from hastily divorcing. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Tractate Ketuvot (82b), it explains the gradual process until the ideal balance was struck.... </i>",
                    "The value of the ketuvah is set according to three components: The main ketuvah, the dowry and the addition to the ketuvah. The amount of the main ketuvah is 200 <i>zuz</i>, with which it is possible to be sustained for at least a year; and if the bride was a divorcee or a widow, the main ketuvah is 100 <i>zuz</i>. The second part is the dowry. That is that we make a calculation of the money and property that the bride's side brought in to the husband's domain. And since the groom acquired it, it is incumbent upon him to add it to the value of the ketuvah, so that her property not stay in his domain should they get divorced. And the third part is the addition, which the groom would add on his own, in addition to the main ketuvah and the dowry that he received. So we calculate these three components together, and that is the value of the ketuvah; meaning the amount the bride would receive in the event that the groom divorce her or die before her. "

She then stands on his right. The seven circles are meant to express that the wedding is for the sake of Heaven; and corresponding to the Holy One, blessed be He, revealing Himself in the seven firmaments, the bride walks around the groom seven times.",
                    "The deeper reason is that every time we make circles, it hints to a level that is greater and higher than what we can understand. That is the difference between the status of a line and the status of a circle: A straight line has a beginning and end, something which expresses our ability to contemplate any linear idea in a systematic way. For it has a postulate from which another postulate is derived, until we reach a concluding thought. But a circle has no beginning nor end, to hint at our dealing with an infinite idea that we cannot fully absorb, but which has a powerful influence upon us. As behold it completely surrounds our awareness and provides it with  inspiration. Speech is hinted to by a line, but what is beyond speech is hinted to by a circle. Hence when we finish reading the Torah on Simchat Torah, it is customary to have <i>hakafot</i> (dancing in circles around the bimah), to hint that after all that we have merited to study and understand, we still have only absorbed a tiny fraction of the Torah's divine wisdom. Yet since we have merited to occupy ourselves with it, it surrounds us and we then merit to acquire inspiration that directs our thoughts and elevates our ways. So too at the time of a wedding, the excitement is so great and its meaning so deep and sublime; so much so that all of the blessings and all of the words that we say at the wedding are not able to express the greatness of its importance. So because of that, we have these circles; to express what is above and beyond words and to allow for inspiration from it."
