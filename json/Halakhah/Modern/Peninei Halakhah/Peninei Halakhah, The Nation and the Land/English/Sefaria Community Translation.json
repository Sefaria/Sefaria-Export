                    "... Guarding The Land / From Foreigners in the Land of Israel",
                    "The great vision of the people of Israel in God's land is that the land will be settled by the people of Israel, and the Temple will stand on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, and all of national life will be arranged and conducted according to the ways of Torah, ethical instruction, and holiness.  Israel will be a light unto the nations, that they will come to visit to land and receive inspiration for the improvement of the nations and the world.  According to the Prophet Isaiah (2:2-4) \"In the days to come, The Mount of the LORD’s House Shall stand firm above the mountains And tower above the hills; And all the nations Shall gaze on it with joy. 3And the many peoples shall go and say: “Come, Let us go up to the Mount of the LORD, To the House of the God of Jacob; That He may instruct us in His ways, And that we may walk in His paths.” For instruction shall come forth from Zion, The word of the LORD from Jerusalem. 4Thus He will judge among the nations And arbitrate for the many peoples, And they shall beat their swords into plowshares And their spears into pruning hooks: Nation shall not take up Sword against nation; They shall never again know war.\""
