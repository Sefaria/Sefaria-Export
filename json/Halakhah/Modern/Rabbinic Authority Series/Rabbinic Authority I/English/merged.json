            "In referring to the highest level of truth finding in a judicial proceeding, our Sages use of the phrase, “<i>Ha-dan din emet la-amito</i>.” What is being conveyed here is that knowledge of the law is not sufficient to render a verdict of truth. In order for the <i>dayan</i> to arrive at the correct verdict, the precise facts of the case must be discovered as well.",
            "A beth din panel is not only thoroughly versed in the relevant hala­khot, but is also well-equipped by virtue of educational background and professional work experience to grasp the reality on the ground. This entails a relentless commitment to relevant fact finding, taking nothing at face value, and understanding the implications of the facts for the commercial behavior of the parties.",
            "A second characteristic of the halakhic-judicial process dealing with monetary matters consists of the documentation that must accompany the verdict that the panel hands over to the litigants at the conclusion of the proceedings. The claims of the plaintiff, as well as the respondent’s rebuttals and counterclaims, are meticulously recorded. Next, a thorough discussion of the issues from a halakhic perspective is presented. Finally, the verdict is rendered, and this verdict is demonstrated to have flowed from the halakhic discussion.",
            "R. Dr. A. Yehuda Warburg has assumed a vital role in implementing this vision of a “double level” of truth in the Beth Din of America and on other panels. In the present work, <i>Rabbinic Authority: The Vision and the Reality</i>, R. Warburg presents a number of his judicial rulings. What stands out in these decisions is the halakhic framework, legal perspective, and “reasoned opinions” R. Warburg sets up to support his decisions.",
            "For a number of decades, I have been involved on an ad hoc basis as a <i>dayan</i>, including serving on judicial panels for the Beth Din of America<i>.</i> In this capacity, I have often crossed paths with R. Warburg and served together with him on the same judicial panel. In each panel we served on together, R. Warburg’s outstanding Torah scholarship was always in evidence, scholarship motivated by a perfectionist’s drive to achieve new vistas in advancing the “double dimension” of truth that stands as the ideal for the halakhic-judicial process.",

        "Preface": [
            "The present volume is intended as an introduction to a subject unfamiliar to many – rabbinic authority as reflected in our halakhic sources. Its subtitle – “The Vision and the Reality” – indicates the two perspectives from which we will approach this topic.",
            "In discussing the halakhic “vision” of rabbinic authority, we will address a number of questions. How does Halakhah (Jewish law) envision rabbinic authority? What are the credentials for being a rabbinic authority? What is the difference between a rabbi who is “an authority” and one who is “in-authority”? What is the status of a congregational rabbi? How does a rabbi arrive at a halakhic decision? Is a rabbi bound to follow the opinions of his predecessors, or may he choose to render his own independent opinion? Under what conditions can he choose to issue his own judgment?",
            "The author of <i>Sefer Ha-Arukh</i>, the first halakhic lexicon, defines Halakhah concisely:",
            "<span class=\"poetry indentAll\"><small>Something that travels from the beginning of time until the end, or the path that the Jewish community walks.</small></span>",
            "Halakhah embodies the traditions transmitted throughout the generations; it is the path that the Jewish People have chosen to follow. But how wide is that path?",
            "John Stuart Mill, the father of modern liberalism, famously claimed:",
            "<span class=\"poetry indentAll\"><small>The only purpose for which power can be exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>On Liberty</i>, (NY: 1956) chap. 1, para. 9.</i></small></span>",
            "Does Halakhah endorse such a perspective, which would lead “socially harmless” matters to the individual conscience, even when it comes to business affairs?",
            "This question leads us to many others. Are directors and employees in the corporate world halakhically and/or legally accountable for all their decisions? Should a halakhic arbiter or a civil court defer to a decision rendered by an employee or director, or should we scrutinize the propriety of their decision? To answer these questions, we will examine how two different legal systems – Halakhah and American law – approach the application of the business judgment rule in the profit and not-for-profit corporate world.",
            "The final component of my discussion of the “vision” of rabbinic authority is an attempt to solve a particularly vexing problem faced by the contemporary Jewish court in some cases of divorce – the problem of one spouse refusing to execute a <i>get</i>, a bill of Jewish divorce. Coercing a recalcitrant spouse to grant a <i>get</i> results in a <i>get me’usah</i>, a forced <i>get</i>, which is invalid. In this volume, I present a viable halakhic solution to this problem in an expanded version of an article that originally appeared in the <i>Jewish Law Annual</i> (vol. 18), entitled, “Recovery for Infliction of Emotional Distress: Toward Relief for the <i>Agunah</i>.” Our contribution is an attempt to invoke the halakhot of <i>nezikin</i> (monetary damages for injury caused) to reduce the problem of “chained spouses” in our community.",
            "The “reality” of rabbinic authority presented in this volume deals with one type of that authority – the Jewish court, or <i>beit din</i>. As members of our covenant-faith community, we are obligated to resolve our differences in a <i>beit din</i> rather than resorting to litigation in civil court.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Midrash Tanhuma</i>, <i>Mishpatim</i>, <i>piska</i> 6; <i>Gittin</i> 88b; <i>SA</i>, HM 26:1–3.</i> The parties who appear before a <i>beit din</i> sign a <i>shtar borerut</i> (arbitration agreement) that empowers the panel of <i>dayanim</i> to resolve the matter in contention according to the norms of Halakhah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Rema</i>, <i>Hoshen Mishpat</i> (HM) 12:7; <i>Sma</i>, HM 12:18.</i> Assuming the <i>beit din</i> process and its decision comply with the rules of secular arbitration law, the judgment will be enforceable in a competent civil jurisdiction in the United States.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Uniform Arbitration Act, sec. 1. A <i>dayan</i> is responsible not only to render a judgment in accordance with Halakhah, but equally to ensure that the decision will be enforceable in civil court; see <i>Hiddushei ha-Ritva</i>, <i>Mo’ed Katan</i> 14b; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:18; <i>Perush ha-Gra</i>, <i>Mishlei</i> 31:9; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, HM 177.</i>",
            "Interestingly, as central as the <i>beit din</i> system is in vision and reality, it is an institution whose workings and contributions to the “path of Halakhah” are largely unknown to most segments of the Jewish community. One of the primary reasons for unfamiliarity with the <i>beit din</i> can be traced back to a Mishnaic ruling:",
            "<span class=\"poetry indentAll\"><small>Upon finishing their deliberations, they would bring the litigants back to the courtroom, and the senior member of the panel would state: Mr. X, you are acquitted, and Mr. X, you are liable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sanhedrin</i> 3:7.</i></small></span>",
            "A review of relevant passages in the Talmud and rulings throughout the ages and until today demonstrates that Jewish courts generally took this Mishnaic ruling to heart, limiting their decisions to identifying the innocent and responsible parties, but not offering much in the way of reasoning.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 84b; <i>Shavuot</i> 30b; <i>Sanhedrin</i> 6b; <i>Shulhan Aruch</i> (SA), HM 19:1.</i> However, prior to a <i>beit din</i>’s <i>psak din</i> (final decision), a litigant may request that the panel provide a reasoned opinion if he is concerned that one or more of the judges are ignorant of a relevant <i>halakhah</i> or that they are biased in some way.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tur</i>, HM 14; <i>SA</i> and <i>Rema</i>, HM 14:1, 4; <i>Sma</i>, HM 14:25; <i>SA</i>, HM 12:2; <i>Teshuvot Sha’ar Yehoshua</i> 1–2. Cf. <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, HM 12.</i> According to some authorities, this is true not only of a standing <i>beit din</i> that requires litigants to appear before them regarding a contentious matter, but also when the <i>beit din</i> is an ad hoc panel, known as <i>zabla</i> (“<i>zeh borer lo ehad</i>” – “one chooses one”)<i>.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the absence of a standing <i>beit din</i> or when one or more of the litigants do not want to appear in front of a standing <i>beit din</i>, each party may choose one <i>dayan</i>, and the two <i>dayanim</i> (arbitrators) choose a third; see <i>SA</i>, HM 13:1–2.</i>",
            "<i>Maharah Or Zarua</i> and <i>Havot Ya’ir</i> are of the opinion that each and every <i>dayan</i> should provide the grounds for his decision.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Maharah Or Zarua</i> 13; <i>Teshuvot Havot Ya’ir</i> 165.</i> In our day especially, many litigants question a <i>dayan</i>’s credibility, halakhic expertise, and/or business acumen; therefore, if at all possible, a reasoned opinion should be forthcoming.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Tzvi Yehuda ben Ya’akov, “The Obligation of Giving a Reasoned <i>Psak Din</i>” [Hebrew], 19 <i>Tehumin</i> (5759), 223, 234.</i>",
            "Due to the fact that halakhic court procedure does not mandate the issuance of a reasoned opinion, however, contemporary <i>dayanim</i> have generally refrained from submitting reasoned judgments. Nevertheless, certain <i>dayanim</i> who sit on the Beth Din of America in New York City and others who serve in the Israeli <i>beit din</i> networks under the aegis of Israel’s Chief Rabbinate and Eretz Hemdah-Gazit have done so.",
            "During the last thirteen years, I have served as a <i>dayan</i> on the Beth Din of America and appeared on various <i>zabla</i> panels as well as a single arbitrator for the Hassidic, Modern Orthodox, Sephardic, and <i>yeshiva</i> communities in the New York-New Jersey metropolitan area. In numerous instances, I have rendered reasoned opinions in commercial matters and domestic relations. Among other matters, these decisions touch on issues of employment termination and severance awards, partnership dissolution, the validity of <i>minhag ha-soherim</i> (commercial practice), civil law, contractual agreements and preliminary agreements, the interpretation of contracts, the principle of indemnity in insurance law, recovery of economic loss of funds, consequential damages, lease, construction, and loan agreements, self-dealing in non-profit organizations, and copyright infringement. In addressing family matters, I have dealt with the grounds for issuing a divorce judgment, dividing up marital assets upon divorce, spousal support, child support and placement, filial obligations to one’s parents, and <i>yerushah</i> (inheritance) issues, such as guidelines for drafting a halakhic will and the validity of a civil will and a trust agreement.",
            "The cases chosen for this volume cover the range of subjects characteristic of all modern legal systems – <i>dinei mamonot</i> (civil matters), public and administrative law, family law, and philosophy of law. Given that Halakhah is a religious legal system, the impact of <i>issur ve-heter</i> (ritual law) upon the monetary issues under investigation is equally dealt with in our judgments.",
            "In this volume, I have included ten presentations inspired by reasoned opinions handed down as a member of a <i>beit din</i> panel. Two of these, dealing with drafting a halakhic will and labor relations, are expanded versions of my decisions that have recently appeared in the journal <i>Hakirah</i> (vols. 10 and 12). In each presentation, I offer a rendition of the facts of the case, followed by the claims of the <i>Tove’a</i> (plaintiff), the reply of the <i>Nitva</i> (defendant), and any counterclaims. Subsequently, there is a discussion of the halakhic issues emerging from the parties’ respective claims and counterclaims, followed by a decision rendered by the <i>beit din</i> panel. To preserve the confidentiality of the parties involved in these cases, all names have been changed, and some facts have been changed and/or deleted.",

                "<span class=\"poetry indentAll\"><small>Natural man, moving straight forwards, comes suddenly to a stop, turns around, and casts as an outsider, a contemplative gaze upon his environment … He discovers an awesome and mysterious domain of things and events which is independent of and disobedient to him, an objective order limiting the exercise of his power … In the wake of this discovery, he discovers himself. Once self-discovery is accomplished, and a … I-awareness of an existence which is limited and opposed by a non-I outside emerges, something new is born – namely the divine norm … “And the Lord God commanded the man” … Man attains his unique identity when, after having been enlightened by God that he is not only a committed but also a free person, endowed with power to implement his commitment, he grasps the incommensurability of what he is and what he is destined to be.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joseph B.

                "Furthermore, being a liberal-democratic society, legal authority in American life has been seen as appropriate for the public square, but limited in the private realm. An American inquires of a lawyer about his rights and their infringement.

So too, if one of the <i>Ge’onim</i> taught that a certain way of judgment was correct, and it became clear to a court at a later date that this was not in accordance with the view of the Gemara, the earlier authority is not necessarily followed, but the view is adopted which seems more reasonable, whether it be that of an earlier or of a later authority.

Chajes, <i>Kol Sifrei Maharatz Hayut</i> (Jerusalem: 5718), 109. Whereas <i>Rambam</i> maintains that the authority of the Talmud is due to the assent of the Jewish community and that it was part and parcel of an unbroken tradition dating back to Moshe, R. Chajes and R. Elhanan Wasserman argue that the finality is attributed to a decision by all or the majority of scholars, whose status is akin to the <i>Sanhedrin ha-Gadol</i>.

Hayyim Soloveitchik contends that there is actually no prohibition for Talmudic and post-Talmudic scholars to overrule their predecessors, but they refrain from doing so in practice. For an overview of these approaches and others, see Shlomo Havlin, “On ‘Literary Sealing’ as the Foundation for the Division of Halakhah into Epochs” [Hebrew], in <i>Mehkarim be-Safrut ha-Talmudit</i> (Israel: 1983), 148, 169–83.<br>Acceptance of the Talmud’s rulings was not limited to courts and arbiters, but equally affirmed by the Jewish community.

Consequently, it is no wonder that after its compilation, divergent interpretations of this corpus were to be found among the <i>dayanim</i> and decisors throughout the various communities.",
                "Decentralization of the Jewish community coupled with an acute need to resolve halakhic indeterminacies were factors in the emergence and proliferation of rabbinic authorities who made decisions for particular Jewish communities. Such rabbinic personalities were referred to as the “<i>mara de-atra</i>,” literally, the “master of the place.” Upon acceptance of his authority, his rulings are authoritatively binding upon the members of his community. Briefly sketching this role, Professor Aharon Kirschenbaum observes:",
                "<span class=\"poetry indentAll\"><small>Traces of such rabbinic authority … for the inhabitants of a limited geographic area may be found among the <i>Tanna’im</i>. Thus, although his colleagues limited the suspension of Sabbath restrictions to the circumcision itself, “in the place of R. Eliezer they used to cut wood [on the Sabbath] to make charcoal in order to forge an iron instrument.” R. Eliezer held that all necessary requisites for the circumcision … superseded the Sabbath prohibition. Hence, even the charcoal necessary for the forging of the circumcision knife was permitted to be prepared. Although R. Eliezer was overruled by the other <i>Tanna’im</i>, his position was accepted as valid “in his place.”<br>Similarly, R. Jose the Galilean’s opinion that the cooking of the flesh of fowl in milk was totally permitted was rejected by his colleagues … Nevertheless, the Talmud states that, “in the place of R. Jose the Galilean, they used to eat fowl’s flesh cooked in milk” …<br>On the basis of these Tannaitic precedents, the <i>Amora’im</i> ruled that the opinion of the <i>mara de-atra</i> was binding on the <i>atra</i> even where it was in opposition to the normative Halakhah. For example, there is a well-known dispute in the matter of <i>muktzah</i>, wherein R. Simeon rejected the rules of <i>muktzah</i> as we know them. Although R. Hamnuna agreed with R. Simeon, he excommunicated a certain disciple who gave a practical decision in accordance with R. Simeon’s position. He did so because the disciple had made that decision in an area that was within the jurisdiction of Rav. Since Rav opposed R. Simeon’s position, the disciple should have acted accordingly. Thus, the Talmud defends the excommunication declared by R. Hamnuna even though the latter agreed with the substance of the disciple’s decision.

Second, given that the minority members of the community and out of town residents (under certain circumstances) must still adhere to the <i>mara de-atra</i>’s rulings of a public nature (see text below), outward unity as reflected in public acceptance of the <i>mara de-atra</i> would still exist. Alternatively, in our contemporary context, due to the breakdown of communal structures and various other factors (see text below), the role of the <i>mara de-atra</i>’s authority is limited <i>de facto</i> to certain public matters; consequently, every member, even the minority, must accept his authority for these matters.

However, this rationale is specifically applicable to a <i>mara de-atra</i>, rather than every <i>moreh hora’ah</i>.<br><i>Berakhot</i> 63b states that concerning <i>issur ve’heter</i>, ritual matters, “if a scholar prohibited something, his colleague has no authority to permit it after it already has been forbidden.” Most legists understand this to mean that once something has been declared forbidden, it can no longer be declared permissible. See <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 7a; <i>Perush ha-Ra’avad</i>, <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 7a; <i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba</i>, ad loc.; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 1:66. Cf. the views of <i>Rashi</i>, <i>Niddah</i> 20b, and <i>Hiddushei ha-Ran</i>, <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 2a (<i>Rif</i> pagination), who claim that “<i>kevod ha-Rav</i>,” deference and respect, precludes the second decisor from overruling the first decisor. (<i>Ran</i> notes that he lacks the status to counter the majority position, which disagrees with this view. See <i>Teshuvot ha-Ridbaz</i> 1:362). For other approaches which bar overruling a previous decisor – either to preclude the conception that there are two systems of Halakhah or because the questioner has accepted the first decisor’s decision – see <i>Ran</i>, <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 7a; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 379.<br>Based upon this debate, <i>Shiltei ha-Gibborim</i>, <i>Avoda Zarah</i> ad loc., argues that if the original <i>posek</i> issued a permissive ruling, according to Ra’avad et al., a second decisor may forbid the matter; according to <i>Rashi</i> et al., the second decisor must refrain from issuing such a ruling. A cursory glance at the works of <i>Poskim</i> will attest to the fact that legists frequently overrule and forbid what colleagues have previously permitted, thus corroborating the majority position. Moreover, numerous authorities have sanctioned overruling of colleagues; see <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Avodah Zarah</i>, ad loc.; <i>Rema</i>, YD 242:31; <i>Shakh</i>, YD 242:58; <i>Teshuvot Tzemach Tzedek</i> (Lubavitch), YD 197; <i>Teshuvot Maharit</i> 86. This conclusion extends even to being stringent against the Halakhah; see <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:112; <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 3:188. Finally, some have argued that the rule “if a scholar prohibited something, his colleague has no authority to permit it after it already has been forbidden” is inapplicable today. See <i>Arukh ha-Shulhan</i> YD 242:63, <i>Teshuvot ha-Rama me-Pano</i> 108; <i>Teshuvot Maharsham</i> 9:79. Cf. <i>Rema</i>, YD 242:34; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ridbaz</i> 1:362; <i>Teshuvot Meishiv Davar</i>, YD 9.<br>This conclusion, however, is limited to a non-institutional rabbinic authority. A scholar must refrain from deciding in a more stringent fashion than a living <i>mara de-atra</i>; see <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:253. Hence, the fact that a <i>mara de-atra</i>’s ruling is final is a unique <i>halakhah</i> regarding deference to his rulings and inapplicable to every <i>moreh horo’ah</i>. While a scholar’s issuance of a more stringent opinions – except in matters of <i>ishut</i>, personal status – is not generally perceived as an affront to his lenient predecessor (“<i>la’az al ha-rishonim</i>”), one must refrain from deciding in a stringent manner contrary to a <i>mara de-atra</i>’s lenient opinion.

In monetary matters, may one rely upon a minority lenient opinion in emergency circumstances, as is the case in ritual matters (“Rabbi X is worthy to be relied upon in a dire need”)? Can one analogize from one piece of legislation to another, from <i>hilkhot mikveh</i> to <i>hilkhot Sukkot</i>?",
                "These questions and many others pose significant challenges to the arbiter as he begins the process of reasoning by analogy.

In Part I, we will review the state of American corporate law liability for acts of negligence by directors of for-profit and non-profit businesses. Part II explores whether Halakhah (Jewish law) endorses the business judgment rule for a Jewish profit or non-profit corporation or for Jewish managers and/or directors employed by American corporations. Part III offers a comparative analysis of how the two legal systems addressed this topic by examining the issue of the stakeholder debate and corporate social responsibility.",

Whereas the board supervises management and the day-to-day operations and establishes corporate policy, the shareholders vote regarding the election of directors, sale of corporate assets, and approval of the corporate charter and amendments. In carrying out their managerial roles, directors are charged with approving, modifying, or disapproving corporate plans and financial objectives of the firm.",
                "The general standard of conduct applicable to gauge the performance of the directors who actually manage the business of the corporation is “the business judgment rule.” As will be shown, this rule is a judicial creation that imparts recognition and deference to a board decision. It is generally used after a corporate decision has been made and as a defense to a challenge of the soundness of a corporate decision. Much attention has been focused on the proper understanding of the specific content of this rule.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Harold Marsh Jr., “Are Directors Trustees?

However, if he fails to set information systems in place, then he breaches his duty of good faith.

In an even stronger statement of the business judgment rule than <i>Puma v. Marriot</i> and <i>Caremark</i>, the Court in <i>Kamin</i> argues that directors are not liable for making mistakes, even if those errors result in substantial costs to the corporation and its shareholders.

First, maintaining that baseball is a daytime sport, the defendant refused to host night baseball. Second, Wrigley alleged that instituting night baseball might cause the neighborhood surrounding the stadium to deteriorate. While these factors were not directly related to the corporation’s economic well-being, the defendant claimed that Wrigley’s long-term financial interests would be best served by continuing to furnish only daytime games.

This is unlike a business corporation, in which there is an infrastructure of information gathering mechanisms and systems for reporting management operations. Moreover, whereas in the corporate world profits are distributed among the stakeholders, such as directors, managers and the like, in the not-for-profit sector, earned profits are reinvested or earmarked for expenses or salaries rather than distributed among its members. Furthermore, whereas corporate directors are remunerated and accountable for their decisions, the majority of non-profit directors are public-minded individuals who serve without compensation on self-perpetuating boards who frequently either lack the information to arrive at informed judgments or who rubberstamp management decisions.",

Unless stipulated otherwise, all profits and losses are to be divided equally between the two partners. The agreement stipulates that on a specified date, the MP must repay the amount of the loan – that is, fifty percent of the funds advanced to him – regardless of any losses he may have incurred.

The concept of “half loan, half investment” is based on the principle that each partner in a business is entitled to profits which are generated by his money. The <i>iska</i> agreement entitles the managing partner to receive 50% of the profits, despite the fact that he did not actually invest money into the business. This means that the agreement treats 50% of the invested funds as if they were the managing partner’s. This is because half of the money which was given by the investing partner is considered a loan to the managing partner, which he then uses to realize profits. The agreement also calls for the investing partner to receive 50% of the profits which are generated. This means that 50% of the business funds are considered his. Although he has actually advanced all of the business funds, the agreement treats only half of the money as the investing partner’s.

Stated somewhat differently, the third party who is engaged in business with the MP does not necessarily assume that the MP is the owner of the money, but views him rather as the agent of a principal who is the real owner and will receive the money from the transaction.

One approach is that the principal may decide to consent to the agent’s act and direct him to correct the harm. Another approach is that the principal must choose between the two options: either to accept the agent’s action and accept the loss, or rescind the agency and initiate a claim for redress for the harm caused by the agent. However, the principal may not choose both options. A third approach advocates that the agency is void and the agent is personally liable for any losses.

The legal consequences of this assumption of liability will vary depending upon a legal system’s view regarding the scope of the business judgment rule. According to American law, such liability reinforces the business judgment rule as an abstention doctrine developed by the courts to refrain from scrutinizing directors’ decisions. On the other hand, although Halakhah looks askance at the director’s or officer’s improper conduct and would require scrutiny of their decisions, barring any grounds (such as commission of fraud) for piercing the corporate veil should they fail to comply with basic halakhic norms, corporate liability may ensue pursuant to their duties as an employee.",

However, funding such projects for the sake of advancing the common good is beyond the ambit of corporate life and thus beyond halakhic reproach. Whereas American law, as expressed in <i>Shlensky v.

Both appeared before a <i>beit din</i>, a rabbinical court, and it was resolved that it was proper that the parties divorce. However, the husband initially refused to give his wife a bill of divorce. According to the Halakhah (Jewish law), dissolution of the matrimonial bond requires the voluntary agreement of both spouses, and failure of one party to assent to the divorce action precludes execution of the divorce. Coercing a recalcitrant spouse to grant a <i>get</i> produces a divorce that is arguably invalid (<i>get me’useh</i>)<i>.</i> Without a valid divorce or rabbinic dispensation (in the case of a recalcitrant wife), neither party may remarry without violating the norms of Halakhah.",

Pursuant to the other view, the <i>get</i> must be delivered immediately upon the issuance of a divorce judgment.

                "The rule of non-liability in the case of fright and shock is predicated on the fact that the slave did not attempt to escape the consequences of the blow. As such, if he is held down by the injurer (<i>mazik</i>) and cannot escape the blow’s impact, the injurer is liable. Commenting on this passage, <i>R. Moshe Margaliot</i> concludes that if the owner holds him and frightens him, he is liable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Pnei Moshe</i>, ibid., s.v. <i>teida she-hu ken.</i> In fact, Yerushalmi <i>Bava Kama</i> 8:6 provides for recovery for embarrassment (absent physical impact) if the injured party is a great scholar. Such a provision is not found in the Bavli.</i> In his opinion, although frightening is equiva­lent to physically holding him down, liability for the ensuing mental anguish is incurred only if the injurer holds down the slave, and not if he merely frightens him. <i>R. Meir Halevi Abulafia</i> (<i>Rama</i>), disagrees, arguing that if the injury could not have been prevented, there is liabil­ity for fright and shock even absent direct physical contact.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shita Mekubetzet</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 91a, s.v. <i>u-le-inyan psak.</i></i>",

Is not the reason for this rule that assessment [of the plausibility that injury was caused by the blow] is required [and it is assumed that the said activity might not have caused the injury to the slave]? No. The absence of tort liability is predicated on the fact that he [the slave] frightened himself. As it was taught: If one frightens another, he is not liable by the law of man, but he is liable by the law of heaven.

Hence, although a husband’s refusal to engage in conjugal relations with his spouse may generate feelings of emotional stress, the absence of an act causing these feelings precludes liability even according to the laws of heaven.

Accord­ing to R. Shimon Shkop, the status of the violation – biblical or rabbinic – determines whether abstinence from conjugal relations is deemed to create severe emotional distress for the wife. R. Shkop’s contention has been explained as follows: “All biblical prohibitions are proscribed because higher wisdom recognizes that this is as bad for Israel as poison, and the fact is that the prohibition and the warning exist because the matter is bad … And rabbinic prohibitions are the exact opposite. The matter is good … and the proof is that given the Torah did not proscribe it, it isn’t bad – but rather, the Torah mandated that we listen to the rabbis” (<i>Rabbi Hayyim Shmuelevitz Memorial Volume</i> [Hebrew] [Jerusalem: 1979], 285). See also <i>Sha’arei Yosher</i>, <i>sha’ar</i> 1, ch. 10. Cf. <i>Sefer Yerei’im</i> 191 and <i>Smag</i>, negative pre­cept 81, which maintain that failure to fulfill this duty violates a Rabbinic prohibition. On the view espoused by R. Shkop, such a violation does not cause the said harm to the wife.</i></small></span>",
                "Withholding sexual intercourse (<i>onah</i>) causes emotional scarring and may have repercussions for the future of the marriage. This aware­ness of emotional hurt is underscored in other contexts. For example, the Talmud debates whether, given the tension and mental anguish that arises from spousal conflict, the execution of a divorce is a boon for the wife, or whether, notwithstanding marital tensions, the wife none­theless prefers the gratification of her bodily desires (<i>niha de-gufa</i>) to divorce.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yevamot</i> 118b. The initiation of conjugal relations by the husband is for the wife’s pleasure (<i>simhat ishto</i>), while a husband’s pleasure is a beneficial consequence of imparting pleasure to his wife; see <i>Devarim</i> 24:5 and <i>Rashi</i> ad loc.; <i>Pesahim</i> 72b; <i>Ra’avad</i>, <i>Ba’alei ha-Nefesh</i>, <i>Sha’ar ha-Kedushah</i>; <i>Smak</i>, positive commandment 285. This need to instill joy applies to a pregnant and/or barren wife as well. As R. Moshe Feinstein notes, “Conjugal relations do not depend on the possibility of conception, but are part of a husband’s obligation toward his wife, to give her pleasure and not cause her pain;” see <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, EH 1:102. See also <i>Maggid Mishnah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Nisu’in</i> 15:1. Regarding whether a husband is obligated to sleep in a <i>Succah</i> on <i>Succos</i> without his spouse and the implications of this issue for <i>simhat ishto</i>, see <i>Taz</i>, OH 639:9; <i>Bikurei Ya’akov</i>(Ettlinger), <i>Aruch la-Ner</i> Succah(end), OH 639:18.<br>The halakhic literature suggests that the proscribed pain is not only physical pain, but rather emotional anguish as well. The subtext to the duty to engage in sexual relations is reflected in the requirement that a husband refrain from sexual relations with his wife when intoxicated, angry at her, or intending to divorce her; see <i>Yevamot</i> 37b; <i>SA</i>, OH 240:3, 10. Similarly, the notion of bringing joy to one’s wife entails recognition of the wife’s right to emotional integrity and equanimity. Hence, the with­holding of sexual relations, unless requested by the wife, is deemed to cause mental anguish, and serves, according to some decisors, as potential grounds for compelling a divorce. In <i>Rambam</i>’s formulation, it is grounds for the claim, “My husband is repulsive to me (<i>ma’is alai</i>);” see <i>Hilkhot Nisu’in</i> 14:8. For others who endorse <i>Rambam</i>’s position, see Yuval Sinai, “Coercion of a <i>Get</i> as a Solution for the Problem of Agunah,” 20 <i>Jewish Law Association Studies</i> (2010), 246, which records a substantial number of heretofore unknown decisors who subscribe to <i>Rambam</i>’s view. See R. Avraham Gatinieu’s review of the <i>Poskim</i> concerning this matter and his conclusion that most <i>Rishonim</i> endorse <i>Rambam</i>’s view. See <i>Teshuvot Tzel ha-Kesef</i> 13–14.<br>Although some decisors do not endorse this position as grounds for compelling a <i>get</i>, my proposal to recognize claims for <i>tza’ar boshet</i> in cases of spousal refusal of conjugal relations (see below at nn. 109–118) may have the indirect effect of encouraging recalci­trant husbands to grant a <i>get.</i></i> The Talmudic conclusion is, “<i>tav le-meitav tan du mi-le-meitav armelu”</i> (It is better for two to dwell together than to dwell alone). The underlying idea here is that a woman has a compelling desire for mar­riage, such that she will even accept a degree of routine quarreling and marital strife. The assumption is that given that a woman’s need for sexual relations through the husband’s fulfillment of the “conjugal rights” precept is an existential fact and not conditioned by contingent social or cultural factors, a woman prefers to remain married.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This understanding of the <i>“tav le-meitav tan du”</i> dictum was developed in a talk by R. Joseph Soloveitchik, “Surrendering to the Almighty,” summar­ized in <i>Light</i> (17 Kislev, 5736 [1976]), 11–15, 18. Cf. <i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, vol. 4, EH 83. This is, however, a halakhic presumption, and not applicable to every marriage; see Bleich, supra n. 70, 102–8. Whether the “<i>tav le-meitav tan du</i>” presumption assumes the need to engage in sexual relations or can refer to a woman’s desire for companionship and security merits further analysis. On the notion of mental torment (<i>inui nefesh</i>) as denoting, in certain contexts, abstention from conjugal relations, see <i>Bereishit</i> 31:50; <i>Vayikra</i> 16:29; <i>Yoma</i> 76a, 77b.</i> Hence, a husband’s refusal to engage in sexual relations undermines his wife’s ongoing emotional stability.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">74</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note that the emotional harm ensuing from a wife’s refusal to engage in conjugal relations is likewise deemed infliction of emotional distress on the husband, and is likewise a violation of Halakhah; see <i>Teshuvot Ri Migash</i> 186; <i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Nisu’in</i> 14:9, 11–12; <i>Hiddushei ha-Rashba</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 73a, s.v. <i>ve-ha-amar rav</i>; <i>Hatam Sofer</i> on <i>Taz</i> OH 639:9.</i>",

Clearly, the analogy to someone about to die (<i>goses</i>) is metaphorical.

In both cases, there is objective pain that is not self-induced; see <i>Rashi</i>, <i>Sukkah</i> 25a, s.v. <i>tirda de-reshut.</i></i> While withholding a <i>get</i> does not constitute murder per se, in the eyes of <i>R.

Rather, shame is the feeling of humiliation accompanied by the knowledge that others are aware of the event causing the victim’s discomfiture, and the resulting diminution of his sense of worth. The Talmud asks whether, if the victim is unaware of the humiliation (as for instance, if, while asleep, someone disrobed him, and he subsequently died in his sleep, unaware of the incident), other parties who have been indirectly humiliated, such as family members of the directly humbled party, can sue for <i>boshet</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">84</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bava Kama</i> 86b.</i> Can the heirs sue for family humiliation? If liability depends on third party awareness, there should be no liability in such a case; if liability is grounded in the victim’s feelings of shame, then given his unawareness, the injurer should be exempt.

                "Antecedents for this type of <i>boshet</i> can be found in a Jerusalemite practice from Talmudic times: If someone entrusted preparation of a meal to someone else, who spoiled it, the latter had to compensate the host for the insult to him and to his guests.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">92</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bava Batra</i> 93b. The fact that the act in question generates <i>boshet</i> liability according to the laws of heaven (<i>dinei Shamayim</i>), if not according to the laws of man, entails that the Halakhah recognizes embarrassment that does not ensue from physical contact.</i> Liability for the host’s embarrassment ensues from his being publicly embarrassed by the spoiled meal. Liability for guests’ embarrassment is grounded in their mental anguish for the host who wanted to serve a delicious meal; the Talmud identifies these “third-party” feelings as <i>boshet</i> too.",

                "Given that intentional infliction of mental anguish is akin to <i>boshet devarim</i>, can this claim be resolved by a rabbinical court? While, accord­ing to the strict law, there is no remedy in cases of <i>boshet</i> involving no physical contact, a rabbinical court, whether or not its members are ordained judges, does have the extrajudicial power, “in every locale and at all times,” to benefit the community by imposing criminal sanc­tions and holding the wrongdoer liable for damages for <i>boshet devarim.</i>",
                "At first glance, such a conclusion might seem unfounded. The <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> rules that only ordained arbiters residing in the Land of Israel can assess a specified penalty established by the Torah (<i>kenas katzuv</i>)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">95</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Halakhah distinguishes between cases in which the offender is liable to pay monetary compensation (<i>mamon</i>), and cases of offenses that incur fines (<i>kenas</i>). Whereas one who confesses to an act commission of which incurs liability for monetary restitution is obligated to pay, this is not so with regard to fines. Here, admitting to an act does not render one liable to payment of the fine; see <i>Bava Kama</i> 64b, 75a. Since a litigant’s con­fession regarding humiliation is admissible in evidence, <i>boshet</i> payments fall into the category of <i>mamon</i>; see <i>Rashi</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 42a; <i>Tosafot Rid</i>, <i>Ketuvot</i> 41a; <i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Nedarim</i> 8:3. Nevertheless, in some Tal­mudic and post-Talmudic sources, <i>boshet</i> is arbitrarily designated a fine; see <i>Sma</i>, HM 1:5; <i>Shakh</i>, HM 1:3. Given that non-ordained arbiters may adjudicate only matters that occur frequently and involve a loss of money, injuries such as <i>boshet</i>, if they that do not occur frequently and do not entail a loss of money, are deemed to fall under the category of offenses incurring fines, and as such, cannot be adjudicated; see <i>Teshuvot Rav Natronai Gaon</i> (Brody edition) 329, 363; <i>Otzar ha-Ge’onim</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 64–68; <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i> 84b; <i>Maggid Mishnah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Hovel u-Mazik</i> 5:6; <i>Beit Yosef</i>, HM 1; Amihai Radzyner, “Foundations of ‘<i>Dine Qena­sot</i>’ in Talmudic Law” (unpublished doctoral dissertation, Bar Ilan University, 2001), 229–36.</i> for personal injuries, and today, all arbiters are non-ordained and hence lack the authority to mete out such penalties.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>SA</i>, HM 1:1.</i> How, then, can a rabbinical court today award damages for <i>boshet</i>? As we have explained, on the strength of exigency law, even non-ordained arbiters are empowered to mete out penalties known as “fines imposed by the Rabbis” (<i>kenas hakhamim</i>), such as payments for <i>boshet</i>-related injury.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">97</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Piskei ha-Rosh</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 4:41; <i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 384. See Radzyner, n. 95 above, 281–2. In our presentation, we have focused upon the exigency jurisdiction of a contemporary <i>beit din</i>’s authority to address a wife’s claim for tort damages; see <i>SA</i>, HM 2 and supra, text accompanying nn. 26–59 and infra, text accompanying nn. 98–101. A <i>beit din</i> is empowered to render an award for two types of damages: compensatory damages and punitive damages. Compensatory damages represent the financial equivalent of the loss or harm suffered by the victim, to restore the injured victim to the position he was in prior to the <i>nezek</i>. The scope of the compensatory damages includes economic damages, such as <i>nezek</i>, and non-economic damages, such as <i>boshet</i>; see <i>SA</i>, HM 420:15–18, 24. Unlike compensatory damages, punitive damages consist of an assessment of damages above and beyond compensating the victim for the harm suffered. The goal of punitive damages is to punish the <i>mazik</i> for his or her conduct, deter the <i>mazik</i> from repeating his or her improper act, and prevent others from engaging in similar behavior. For a contemporary application of the imposition of punitive damages in a case of physical assault, see File no. 9326-35-1, SRC, Aug. 25, 2008. Regardless of whether the award is compensatory or punitive in nature, the justification of the award is based upon the exigency jurisdiction of a <i>beit din</i>, namely the assessment that the community must deter such improper behavior rather than satisfying a claim due to the fact that the wife is personally entitled to such relief.<br>Should a <i>beit din</i> today deem it necessary to award damages for <i>boshet devarim</i>, it has the option to either award compensatory damages calculating the shame based upon the societal status of the offender and the offended or award punitive damages that would exceed a compensatory damage award. See <i>SA</i>, HM 420:24, 35, 43; <i>Sma</i>, HM 420:25. Since the calculation of the compensatory damages for <i>boshet devarim</i> is subjective, should a <i>beit din</i> determine to render such an award, the panel must be careful to render an assessment that reflects a compensatory damage award, lest one blur the lines between a compensatory damage award and a punitive damage award. Regarding a contemporary <i>beit din</i>’s authority to render an award for <i>boshet devarim</i>, see <i>Teshuvot ha-Rosh</i> 101:1, 8, 9; <i>SA</i>, HM 420:38; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ridbaz</i> 3:480; <i>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</i>, HM 181.<br>Regardless of whether the damages are compensatory or punitive in nature, the awarding of such damages is viewed as a vehicle to appease the victim and is grounded in the <i>beit din</i>’s exigency jurisdiction. See <i>Tur</i>, HM 1:11; <i>Rema</i>, HM 1:2, 5; <i>SA</i>, HM 420: 38; <i>Teshuvot ha-Mabit</i> 1: 93; <i>Teshuvot ha-Ridbaz</i> 4:1291.</i>",

Whether R. Elyashiv’s justification for invoking this exigency power rests on the court’s status as a community court (see above at nn. 45–50) or a non-ordained panel of arbiters (see above at nn. 51–58), or is based on the signing of an arbitration agreement (see supra n. 59) is unclear from the ruling in question. But given that in other decisions, R. Elyashiv ascribes to the view that the Israeli rabbinical courts are communal courts, mandating submission to their authority (see <i>PDR</i> 7:225, 227 and E. Shochetman, <i>Civil Procedure in Jewish Law</i> [Hebrew] [Jerusalem: 1988], 169, n. 34), it is clear that he deems the exercise of such authority by community courts fully legitimate. Moreover, given that a community court is a non-ordained panel of arbiters, R. Elyashiv would presumably conclude that any lay panel may exercise such powers.

                "It remains to identify the specific reason infliction of emotional distress by refusal to engage in conjugal relations serves as grounds for awarding <i>boshet</i> damages. Is it a “<i>le-migdar milta”</i> (a protective measure) or is it due to “the needs of the time?” Is the emotional fallout from spou­sal refusal of conjugal relations like the mental anguish resulting from a broken engagement? On the one hand, this type of distress does not result from any physical injury or impact. Is it, then, like being spat on (where the spittle lands on one’s clothing and does not touch one’s skin), being called derogatory names, or being jilted by a fiancé? On the strength of a court’s authority to invoke its exigency jurisdiction in all these aforementioned situations, the injurer can be fined.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">102</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>SA</i>, HM 420:38.</i> It would seem that this should apply to our scenario as well.",
                "The Talmud and halakhic authorities, however, exhort us to refrain from making rules that impose a fine in one realm on the basis of laws pertaining to a fine in another realm.

One school of thought argues that since monetary penalties are involved, the list cannot be added to, as this would constitute establishing a new penalty. Despite putative similarities between two situations, arbiters are not to derive new pen­alties by analogical inference from existing penalties. On this view, though absence of physical contact appears to be a common feature of spitting on someone else’s clothing, defamation, and emotional distress due to spousal refusal to engage in conjugal relations, this putative analogy cannot serve as a basis for expanding the sphere of exigency law to encompass the latter.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yad Malakhi</i> 550–551; <i>Shakh</i>, HM 385:1; <i>Tosfot Yom Tov</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 5:4.</i>",

                "Having considered this debate, it is my opinion that, given that emotional distress due to spousal refusal to have conjugal relations may have more severe psychological impact than a physical act of injury, it should indeed be handled like <i>boshet devarim</i> and spitting on clothing. The court’s discretion to impose extrajudicial fines can provide monetary relief for this type of emotional anguish.",
                "We saw that a husband’s denying his wife conjugal relations contravenes the biblical directive, “Devise not evil against your neigh­bor, seeing he lives securely by you” (Proverbs 3:29).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See supra text accompanying n. 60.</i> A husband’s deny­ing his spouse sexual relations occurs when the spouses reside under the same roof, and either have an ongoing marriage in other respects, or are de facto separated from each other and the marriage is factually “dead,” but the husband is delaying the granting of a divorce.

Warhaftig (ed.), <i>Collected Rulings of the Rabbinical High Court of Appeals</i> [Hebrew] (Jerusalem: 1950), 30. Nevertheless, Israeli rabbinical courts have at times recommended separate bedrooms in order to facili­tate reconciliation in the hope of the couple’s eventual return to shared quarters; see <i>PDR</i> 4:267, 274.</i> This is done by issuing a divorce judgment that it is “proper” or “recommended” that “the parties divorce each other.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">124</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although in the period of the <i>Rishonim</i>, such judgments were for­mulated in terms of an “obligation to divorce” (<i>hiyuv le-garesh</i>) rather than “compelling” divorce (<i>kofin le-garesh</i>), Kaplan argues that today, rabbinical courts, in particular in Israel, use even weaker terms, saying that divorce is “recommended” or “a mitzvah.” See Yehiel Kaplan, “Enforcement of Divorce Judgments by Imprisonment: Principles of Jewish Law,” <i>Jewish Law Annual</i> 15 (2004), 57, 77–80, 134–8.

A secular legal system might ask: Ought not the husband to have foreseen the injury that would result from his conduct? Did the wife have an “eggshell personality,” resulting in unforeseeable mental injury? The halakhic system does not ask these questions. The doctrine that a hus­band’s denying his spouse conjugal relations is a violation of the prohibitions against <i>ona’at devarim</i> and <i>boshet</i> enables the court to assume that long term abstinence from conjugal relations engenders anguish in every wife, and does not reflect psychological fragility, but is rooted in the very essence of her humanity. Similarly, the forseeability of the harm ensuing from the husband’s failure to engage in sexual relations need not be proven in order to establish liability.",

As we saw, it imposes liability for a type of injury not covered by the strict law, namely, non-physical injuries unaccompanied by direct physical contact.

See the reading of <i>Mabit</i>’s position advanced in <i>Teshuvot Simhat Kohen</i>, vol. 2, EH 9.<br>On the consistency of these <i>teshuvot</i> by <i>Mabit</i> with other <i>teshuvot</i>, he wrote on the matter (2:138 and 206), see R. Zvi Gartner, <i>Kefiyat Get</i>, 376–77. R. Gartner’s conclusion differs from my own. He contends that <i>Mabit</i>’s true position, expressed in 2:206 and 3:212, is that a husband’s inability or unwillingness to satisfy an independent financial claim does taint any subsequent execution of a divorce; see R. Gartner, ibid., EH 134, 379. Though the <i>teshuvot</i> on which R. Gartner bases his conclusion reflect a minority view and stand in con­tradiction to <i>Mabit</i>’s <i>teshuvot</i> 1:22 and 76, on which I base my own reading of <i>Mabit</i>, and though R. Gartner, in a written com­munication to this author, acknowledges that this minority view is not supported by other <i>Aharonim</i>, some contemporary decisors nonetheless concur with R. Gartner’s understanding of Mabit’s position. See Bleich, supra n. 138, 339; Izirer, n. 140 above, 312; Yosef Goldberg, “Duress Unrelated to Divorce” [Hebrew], 7 <i>Shurat ha-Din</i> (2002): 353; <i>Teshuvot Mayyim Tehorim</i>, EH 15; Uriel Lavi, “Arranging a <i>Get</i> after the Husband has Been Obligated to Pay His Wife Monetary Damages” [Hebrew], 26 <i>Tehumin</i> (2006), 160, 165. In endorsing R. Gartner’s interpretation of <i>Mabit</i>’s view, these decisors argue that we must show deference to the minority view due to the seriousness of the halakhic consequences of an invalid divorce. See J. David Bleich, “Monetary Agreement for the Purpose of Avoidance of <i>Get</i> Recalcitrance” [Hebrew], 41 <i>Or ha-Mizrach</i> (1992), 272–80.<br>In light of the internal contradictions in 2:138 as well as its inconsis­tency with two of <i>Mabit</i>’s other <i>teshuvot</i>, as well as the fact that other <i>Aharonim</i> reject this position or uphold the reading of <i>Mabit</i>’s pos­ition I have endorsed, I see no reason to factor it into decision-making on this matter. Indeed, neither R. Feinstein nor R. Rafael invoke this view. Though <i>argumenta ex silentio</i> of this sort are inconclusive, this silence of major authorities does serve to support the lenient position.</i></small></span>",

Some argue that even if divorce is merely mentioned, this indicates that the intent of the independent financial claim is to induce the husband to grant the divorce. If divorce is not mentioned, we can assume that the intent of advancing the finan­cial claim is to have it settled, rather than for it to serve as leverage toward procuring a <i>get</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">148</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Iggerot Moshe</i>, EH 1:137, s.v. <i>veto muvan</i>; <i>Teshuvot Ein Yitzhak</i>, EH 2:33:1–6; Gartner, ibid., 379, 386.</i>",

Claims for compensation for these injuries are related to the <i>get</i> and therefore contravene the requirement that the <i>get</i> be freely given. However, mental anguish due to the absence of conjugal relations is an independent claim, and therefore may be grounds for granting an award. The point in time at which the wife submitted the claim or her verbal remarks linking the claim to receiving a <i>get</i> need not be considered by the court. As we have seen, such a claim may be advanced even where divorce is not contemplated.",

Though the wife would have liked to engage in conjugal relations with her spouse, her husband willfully refused to have rela­tions. For the sake of their children, the couple remained outwardly married while in actuality living separately. In principle, at any time during this period of separation, the wife could have chosen to submit a claim against her husband for intentional infliction of mental anguish. For various reasons, she chose to refrain from advancing such a claim prior to deciding to be divorced, but the grounds for such a claim did exist throughout the five years of de facto separation. In other words, this claim is inextricably linked to the emotional stress engendered due to the absence of conjugal relations within their mar­riage, and not introduced merely for the sake of pressuring her hus­band to grant the divorce. The fact that subsequent to her years of anguish, the wife is being held hostage by her husband’s recalcitrance, financial coercion, and blackmail ought not impact the legitimacy of her claim, and should not serve to invalidate any subsequent execution of a divorce. Her intent in advancing the claim at this time, three years after the court’s issuance of a divorce directive, is halakhically insignificant.",

They maintain that even though a self-standing claim, such as a claim for payment of a monet­ary debt or the amount specified in the <i>ketuba</i>, is not linked to a request for execution of a divorce, nevertheless, if there is an established pre­sumption (<i>umdena de-mukhah</i>) that these claims were put forward pri­marily to procure a divorce, any subsequent delivery of a <i>get</i> is invalid.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">149</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Teshuvot Maharashdam</i>, EH 63; <i>Teshuvot Rav Pe’alim</i> 2:3.

Only a rabbinical court may determine whether this claim impacts the propriety of the <i>get</i>. (7041-21-1, SRC, Mar. 11, 2008)<br>If, in the eyes of the court, the claim is self-standing and not intended to coerce the granting of a divorce, any subsequent granting of the divorce is proper.

In our case, even if the ostensibly independent claim for damages for emotional distress was motivated by the desire to procure a divorce, it is a claim, and not an existing obligation. In the other situations, the husband grants the divorce in exchange for the wife’s agreement to release him from a financial duty, in effect saying to him, “Pay up or grant a <i>get</i>.” Our case deals with the advancement of a claim that may or may not result in the awarding of damages.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">150</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Many decisors contend that a husband who gives a divorce due to a threat is deemed to have been forced to grant the <i>get</i>; see <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 2:276; <i>Teshuvot Maharival</i> 2:77; <i>Teshuvot Shem Aryeh</i> 93–94; <i>Teshuvot Avnei Nezer</i>, EH 178:2–3; <i>Pithei Teshuvah</i>, EH 134:15 in the name of the Ridbaz. But these rulings are readily distinguishable from our case, since all deal with situations of “clear and present danger” – that is, these are cases in which a husband is being threatened with harm, imprisonment, or death if he refuses to consent to a divorce, and hence all are indeed instances of unlawfully coerced divorce. By contrast, in our case, the husband is threatened by a monetary claim too remote to rise to the level of compulsion, and especially since the amount of the potential award to the wife is, as we saw, highly variable. As <i>Tashbetz</i> comments, “If he has a remote fear of financial loss and therefore desires to give a <i>get</i>, ought one label this a coerced <i>get</i>?” See <i>Teshuvot Tashbetz</i> 2:69. Indeed, the wife may threaten to submit a claim and never follow through with her threat; see <i>Mordekhai</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 395; <i>Teshuvot Maharik</i> 185; <i>Mikhtav me-Eliyahu</i>, gate 7, no. 18. But cf. <i>Teshuvot ha-Rashba</i> 1:883; <i>Teshuvot ha-Rivash</i> 27 and 32; and <i>Teshuvot Betzalel Ashkenazi</i> 15, which argue that even a mere threat constitutes duress. See also Kaplan, supra n. 124, 98.<br>Obviously, if the rabbinical courts do begin to award damages for this claim, and it becomes a “clear and present danger” akin to the threat of imprisonment, the threat that such a claim will be submitted may render execution of the <i>get</i> coerced. However, even were such an award to become commonplace, the amount of the compensation would not be known in advance, and hence the threat remains remote; see Breitowitz, supra n. 140, 248. Moreover, if a wife threatens to cause her husband financial loss out of spite, and the husband, of his own initiative, decides to give her a <i>get</i>, her threat is not deemed duress, and the <i>get</i> is valid. See <i>Pithei Teshuvah</i>, EH 134:11; <i>Iggerot Moshe</i> 1:137. A fortiori, in our case, a wife’s submission of an independent claim for damages unrelated to the divorce ought not impugn the validity of a subsequent <i>get.</i> Similarly, if there has been no threat to submit such a claim, but the husband grants the divorce because he fears that such a claim will be made if he fail to do so, this is not deemed to be duress; see <i>Teshuvot Bnei Hayai</i>, HM 2:81.</i> Since the consequences of the suit are not spelled out in advance, the putative “coercion” is too remote to rise to the level of duress. Whereas the said authorities invoke an established presumption in the context of an existing independent outstanding debt, which does entail coercion of a <i>get</i>, in our case there is no such existing debt, but only the threat that a claim for damages may be presented to the court.",

Sack, <i>Sack on Defamation: Libel</i>, <i>Slander and Related Problems</i>, 3rd ed. (NY: 2005), §13.6, pp. 13–45. It appears that no action for damages for precluding a spouse from engaging in sexual relations has ever been brought before an American court. Whether American courts would rec­ognize such emotional harm is an open question. Many jurisdictions are increasingly recognizing IIED tort actions between spouses; see L. Karp, <i>Domestic Torts: Family Violence</i>, <i>Conflict and Sexual Abuse</i> (rev. ed. 2005), vol. 1, 116. New York does not allow such claims; see <i>Xiao Yang Chen v. Fisher</i>, 843 N.E. 2d 723 (N.Y. 2005). Some jurisdictions have concluded that the defendant’s conduct failed to be outrageous enough to allow the plain­tiff’s claim for IIED; see <i>Hassing v. Wortman</i>, 333 N.W. 2d 765 (Neb. 1983); <i>Nagy v. Nagy</i>, 210 Cal. App. 3d 1262 (Cal. 1989); <i>Alexander v. Inman</i>, 825 S.W. 2d 102 (Term. 1991); <i>Ruprecht v. Ruprecht</i>, 599 A. 2d 604 (N.J. 1991); <i>McCul­lob v. Drake</i>, 24 P. 3d 1162 (Wyo. 2001). Other states have held husbands liable for emotional distress, provided there was harassment or assault and battery; see Karp, 118–135. Recently, a court awarded damages for IIED to a wife whose husband refused to grant her a <i>get</i>; see <i>Tessler v. Zadok</i>, #2:08-cv-05695-R-RC (California District Ct., May 11, 2009).<br>Some states have, for public policy reasons, refrained from permitting such suits in general, and in particular those that emerge from marital differences; see Linda Berger, “Lies Between Mommy and Daddy: The Case for Recognizing Spousal Emotional Distress Claims Based on Domestic Deceit that Interferes with Parent-Child Relationships,” 33 <i>Loyola of Los Angeles Law Rev.</i> (2000), 459, 467–70; I. Ellman and S. Sugarman, “Spousal emotional abuse as a tort?” 55 <i>Maryland Law Review</i> (1996), 1269, 1285–89; B. Redman, “Jewish Divorce: What Can Be Done in Secular Courts to Aid the Jewish Woman?” 19 <i>Georgia Law Review</i> (1985), 389, 422–23; R. Orsinger, “Assert­ing Claims for Intentionally or Recklessly causing Severe Emotional Distress in Connection with Divorce,” 25 <i>St. Mary’s Law Journal</i> (1994), 1253, 1293–94. In a written communication, Marc Stern, formerly General Counsel of the American Jewish Congress, observes that given that certain states have a policy of precluding interspousal damage awards, a court may decline to enforce an arbitration award based on public policy grounds; see <i>Aleem v. Aleem</i>, 2008 WL 1945345 (MD 2008).<br>Numerous proposals for and against limiting recovery for emotional distress have been put forward. On the grounds for recognition of the tort, see <i>Restatement</i> (<i>Second</i>) <i>of Torts</i>, sec. 46, comments d, e, f and j (1965). As to the argument that First Amendment problems of entanglement of law and religion preclude the possibility that a civil court will offer relief to a recalci­trant spouse in the context of a Jewish divorce, it has been argued that there is a compelling secular interest to afford such relief; see S. Friedell, “The first amendment and Jewish divorce: A comment on <i>Stern v. Stern</i>,” 18 <i>Journal of Family Law</i> (1979–1980), 525; Redman, 416–25; David Cobin, “Jewish Divorce and the Recalcitrant Husband: Refusal to Give a <i>Get</i> as Inten­tional Infliction of Emotional Distress,” 4 <i>Journal of Law and Religion</i> (1986), 405, 425–29; Michelle Greenberg-Kobrin, “Civil Enforcement of Religious Prenuptial Agreements,” 32 <i>Columbia Journal of Law and Social Problems</i> (1999), 359. On the other hand, Marc Stern contends that entertaining such claims entails entanglement of law and religion on two separate grounds: (a) Awarding such a claim involves addressing the threshold issue of whether the Halakhah mandates the grant­ing or receiving of a <i>get</i>; (b) The granting of such an award amounts to the state’s coercing an individual to comply with a religious act.<br>In Israel, given that the dissolution of Jewish marital ties is effected via execution of a Jewish divorce, the constitutional issue of establishment of religion does not arise. In fact, commencing with 2001, four judges have awarded tort damages against a recalcitrant spouse; see 19480/05, Jerusalem Family Court, Apr. 30, 2006. For additional cases after 2006, see Addendum A.</i> Furthermore, even if it can be demonstrated that the civil court will award more damages than a rabbinical court would, the wife may retain the entire award handed down by a civil court.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">165</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Kesef ha-Kodshin</i>, HM 26:2. In the view of Rabbis Daichovsky, Elyashiv and Z. Goldberg, prior to accepting an award from a civil court, one must ascertain the appropriateness of the amount of the award. Generally speaking, one must ask his rabbi whether the amount of the award would have been granted in a rabbinical court. If a rabbinical court would have awarded a smaller amount, then only that amount may be accepted; see M. Ralbag, “Litigating in Civil Court with the Rabbinical Court’s Permis­sion,” [Hebrew] 25 <i>Tehumin</i> (5765), 249, 251–52. However, in our case, given that it is permissible to accept a civil court award for an amount larger than may have been awarded in a rabbinical court, there is no requirement that one’s rabbi be consulted about the propriety of accepting the civil award.</i>",
                "<b>V. Concluding Remarks</b>",
                "We have focused on a particular type of contemporary <i>agunah</i>: the wife who seeks damages for mental anguish caused by her husband's refusal to engage in conjugal relations while a divorce is being withheld. This raises a question: given that the primary emotional trauma is due to her husband’s recalcitrance in granting a divorce rather than the denial of conjugal relations, may the wife put forward a claim for damages for this period without rendering a subsequent divorce unlawfully coerced (<i>get me’useh</i>)? More broadly, may a con­temporary <i>agunah</i>, even one who shares a domicile with her husband, but decides to seek a divorce due to irreconcilable differences or spou­sal abuse, and is met by intransigence on the part of her husband, advance a claim for mental anguish incurred during the period of her husband’s recalcitrance? In effect, may an <i>agunah</i> seek claims for emotional stress from her husband for the period of her inability to remarry and engage in conjugal relations with her husband?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">166</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This claim may be grounds for an award in one of the following ways. First, there is a woman’s compelling desire to be married. Alternatively, an individual who prevents another individual from performing a mitzvah can receive damages <i>min ha-din</i> (black-letter Halakhah) rather than as a <i>kenas</i> (fine). For a discussion of these claims, see the addendum at the end of this chapter.</i> We have argued that as long as the monetary obligation is not linked to the divorce, but independent, and the penalty will remain in place after the <i>get</i> has been granted, execution of the <i>get</i> will be deemed proper. In the words of <i>Torat Gittin</i>:",
                "<span class=\"poetry indentAll\"><small>If he obligated himself with a penalty, should he fail to divorce her by a specific date, and he retracted and refused to divorce her until after the stipulated date, once the stipulated date passes he becomes obligated to pay the penalty even if he divorces her … And the court can mandate the penalty, and it is akin to coercing someone to pay his debt, and if he divorces her in order to free himself from paying the debt, the <i>get</i> is not deemed a forced <i>get</i>, as noted by <i>Rashbatz</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">167</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Torat Gittin</i>, EH 134:4.</i></small></span>",
                "The reasoning is that while monetary pressure is improper if the granting of the <i>get</i> will free the husband of his monetary obligation, if the penalty will have to be paid regardless of the giving of the <i>get</i>, then financial pressure is not the motivating factor in his granting the <i>get</i> and will not taint its execution. The wife may be willing to waive her right to the money in exchange for the <i>get</i>. Such a waiver is proper and no different from what transpires when the court has mandated that a husband pay a debt unrelated to the divorce, such as the <i>ketubah</i> pay­ment, and the couple mutually agree to waive payment of the <i>ketubah</i> in exchange for the <i>get</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">168</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Bleich, supra n. 147, 272–6.</i>",
                "In light of <i>teshuvot</i> dating back to <i>Rivash</i>, and in light of <i>Torat Gittin</i>’s exposition of the Halakhah, <i>R. Daichovsky</i> argues that a wife may collect <i>tza’ar-boshet</i> damages for the mental anguish caused by her hus­band’s conduct. As these damages relate to the husband’s conduct in the past, even if he decides to grant his wife a divorce, the damages stand and must be paid. And even if the wife waives her right to these damages, this decision will in no way impair the fitness of the <i>get</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">169</sup><i class=\"footnote\">S. Daichovsky, “Rabbinical Courts and Civil Courts: Thoughts on Their Overlapping Boundaries in Family Matters” [Hebrew], 4 <i>Moznei Mishpat</i> (2005), 261, 295–98; idem. 2006, supra n. 156, 173–7. But cf. <i>Shevet ha-Levi</i> and <i>Minhat Yitzhak</i>, supra n. 163, who argue that secular legislation mandating an award for a husband’s recalcitrance in granting a <i>get</i> is improper monetary pressure that would taint subsequent execution of the <i>get</i>. Recent Israeli rabbinical court rulings have refused, on similar grounds, to mandate delivery of a <i>get</i> in the face of such tort claims presented by women in the Israeli civil courts. See Tel Aviv District Rabbinical Court, 031783426, Aug. 4, 2005, 02786214-2, Dec. 6, 2006; Netanya District Rabbinical Court, 054568514, Jan. 29, 2007. These decisions and others can be found in <i>ha-Din ve-ha-Dayan</i> 19 and 27. For the most recent decision, see Netanya Rabbinical Court, 272088/6, Jan. 23, 2011. (In a situation in which it is clear that the husband is voluntarily delivering a <i>get</i> to his wife, the presence of a tort claim for <i>get</i> recalcitrance will not impact the validity of the <i>get</i>. See Tel Aviv Rabbinical Court, 364836/1, Nov. 24, 2009). However, given that the award is based on a free-standing obligation to compensate the wife for <i>tza’ar-boshet</i>, these decisors may well concur with R. Daichovsky’s view. On other potential challenges to R. Daichovsky’s position, see Daichov­sky, op. cit., 299–301.</i> Should a husband refuse to submit to the rabbinical court’s authority, a claim for damages due to <i>tza’ar-boshet</i> may be submitted to a civil court, and given the husband’s failure to heed the rabbinical court’s recom­mendation that he divorce his wife, R. Hadaya suggests that monetary penalties may be imposed on the husband for contempt of court.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">170</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Teshuvot Yaskil Avdi</i> 6:96. In addition to being in contempt of court (<i>mesarev le-din</i>), the husband is also violating proscriptions against deni­grating a Torah scholar and <i>dayan</i>; see <i>SA</i>, YD 243:6–7, 334:47; HM 27:1–2. In fact, in serving as a <i>dayan</i> in the Israeli rabbinical courts, R. Daichov­sky has, pursuant to Jewish and Israeli law, directed the civil authorities to imprison recalcitrant husbands. See S. Daichovsky, “Divorce Enforce­ment” [Hebrew], 25 <i>Tehumin</i> (5765),132, 138–43. The underlying premise of this position is that imprisonment in contemporary prisons does not render a divorce unlawfully coerced; see <i>Amud ha-Yemini</i> 19 (R. Yitzhak Herzog’s opinion); <i>Mishpetei Shaul</i> 36; <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, EH 3:20:34.</i>",
                "What is the purpose of providing an award for emotional distress to this present-day <i>agunah</i>? First, it is an opportunity to bring an action that provides public recognition of the intrinsic value of human dignity by formally acknowledging its violation. By invoking exigency Hala­khah, the rabbinical court is attempting to mitigate the emotional suffer­ing, and particularly the humiliation, of a vulnerable victim who is denied conjugal relations and whose husband’s intransigence pre­vents her from in receiving a divorce and remarrying.",
                "The avoidance of shame and psychological torment is a central principle of other realms of Jewish living.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">171</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Alfred Cohen, “The Valance of Pain in Jewish Thought and Practice,” 53 <i>Journal of Halacha and Contemporary Society</i> (2007), 25, 30–35, 47–50.</i> For instance, despite the proscription against hurting and endangering oneself, to avoid shame and relieve mental discomfort, certain types of cosmetic and plastic surgery are permissible.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">172</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tosefot</i>, <i>Shabbat</i> 50b, s.v. <i>bishvil; Teshuvot Helkat Ya’akov</i> 3:11; <i>Teshuvot Mishnah Halakhot</i> 2:246–247; <i>Teshuvot Minhat Yitzhak</i> 6:105:2.</i> Protec­tion of a woman’s dignity should also be extended to her emotional persona. The awarding of these damages for mental anguish gives symbolic recognition to the significance of a wife’s bodily and emo­tional integrity. Though monetary damages may not be equivalent to the emotional injury experienced, they can serve as a symbolic means of restoring a sense of personal security and autonomy.",
                "Furthermore, a successful suit can publicly reprimand and eco­nomically penalize a recalcitrant husband who unjustifiably withholds conjugal relations (<i>onah</i>) and/or a <i>get</i>, thereby deterring other members of the community from committing the same offenses. Realizing that there may be a suit filed for this action, a husband may think twice before refusing to engage in sexual relations with his wife or withhold­ing a <i>get</i>. Finally, if the suit is successful, the award will compensate the wife to some degree for the emotional loss caused by the said assaults on her psyche.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">173</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The primary function of tort damages is to compensate the victim for injuries, restoring him to the position he occupied prior to the tortious act; see <i>Hiddushei Rabbi Hayyim ha-Levi</i>, <i>Hilkhot Toein ve-Nitan</i> 5:2; Yisrael Gustmann, <i>Kuntresei Shiurim</i>, <i>Bava Kama</i>, <i>shiur</i> 6. Com­pensation for medical expenses falls under this rubric; see <i>Maggid Mishnah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Hovel u-Mazik</i> 2:16; <i>SA</i>, HM 420:23. In contrast, <i>tza’ar and boshet</i>, which are non-physical injuries, are compen­sated by imposing a monetary penalty; see <i>Mishnah Torah</i>, <i>Hilkhot Hovel u-Mazik</i> 3:3. Clearly, given that there is no possibility of restoring the wife’s emotional persona to its state prior to the hus­band’s denial of conjugal relations, the only compensation can be a mon­etary penalty.</i>",
                "For all these reasons, prior to endeavoring to resolve a divorce situation, the court should inform the parties that adjudicating spousal claims for emotional distress is within its purview.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">174</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, the claim or the possibility of a future claim will be incorporated into the arbitration agreement accompanied by a provision empowering the rabbinical court to obligate the parties to deal with a husband’s refusal to engage in conjugal relations; see supra at n.156.</i> Indeed, rabbinical courts should insist that resolving end-of-marriage issues includes addressing spousal claims for mental anguish. Should a party refuse to arbitrate such a claim, a court should decline to address the other issues pertaining to termination of the marriage. Failure to insist on an all-or­ nothing approach simply encourages the already pervasive phenom­enon of shopping around for the “right” rabbinical court – namely, one that serves the husband’s needs rather than addressing all the issues in an honest and forthright fashion. Just as the court should insist on hearing all claims associated with the end of marriage, a woman should insist that all of her claims be heard in court.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">175</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the decisional standards have failed to establish that there is “an exigency situation” in order for a <i>beit din</i> to hear claims for <i>tza’ar-boshet</i> (see supra, text accompanying nn. 22–59), an arbitration agreement (as well as a prenuptial agreement; see supra n. 156) may be drafted to entail the undertaking of an obligation (<i>hithayvut</i>) by the parties to advance such claims. In effect, the parties obligate themselves to pay tortuous damages such as <i>tza’ar</i> and <i>boshet</i> based upon a <i>hithayvut</i> rather than the laws of damages. Such a stipulation would not necessitate the need to address the systemic issue of meting out damages in contemporary times. See Avraham Sheinfield, <i>Torts</i> [Hebrew] (Jerusalem: 1991), 362–3 (R. Zalman N. Goldberg’s opinion). For the underpinning of such a view in the <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> and <i>Rema</i>’s rulings, see <i>SA</i>, HM 55:1; 175:40; <i>Rema</i>, HM 386:3; 388:2. For additional sources, see Sheinfeld, ibid., 74–75, 246, 377.<br>In principle, such an obligation may be executed via a mutual verbal commitment of the parties; see <i>Teshuvot Divrei Hayyim</i> 1: 42; <i>Teshuvot Maharash Engel</i> 7:168. In practice, to preempt the possibility of a potential future challenge to the authenticity and veracity of this commitment, this mutual obligation should be recorded into writing. The text of such an arbitration agreement or prenuptial agreement would include the following:<br>The parties acknowledge that the <i>beit din</i> is authorized to resolve all disputes related to a spouse’s refusal to engage in conjugal relations, coercion of the other spouse to engage in conjugal relations against her will, and a spouse’s refusal to grant or receive a Jewish divorce from the other spouse according to their discretion, pursuant to the circumstances, and obligate themselves now (<i>meshabed nafshei mei-achshav</i>) to pay tortuous damages such as <i>nezek</i>, <i>tza’ar</i> and <i>boshet</i>, should they be imposed by <i>beit din</i>.”<br>In effect, the parties obligate themselves to pay tortious damages on the strength of this undertaking (<i>hithayvut</i>), rather their covenantal duty to comply with the laws of damages. See <i>Aruch ha-Shulhan</i>, HM 1:13; <i>Teshuvot Imrei Bina</i>, HM 2; <i>Teshuvot Beit Yehuda</i> 1; <i>Mishpatekha le-Ya’akov</i> 2:32:3; R.

                "On the other hand, a court’s refusal to hear the claim – and if justi­fied, to award damages – effectively bestows on the injurer a kind of “halakhic entitlement” to cause the injury. The perceived weakness of the rabbinical courts can only lead to increased violation of the law, because others are seen to violate the law with impunity. Given the prevalence of the phenomenon of chained wives in contemporary soci­ety, it is not surprising that twentieth century decisors such as <i>Rabbis Herzog</i> and <i>Hadaya</i> stress the obligation to heed the words of Torah scholars (<i>mitzvah li-shmo’a le-divrei hakhamim</i>) regarding compliance with a court’s issuance of a divorce judgment.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">176</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Teshuvot Heikhal Yitzhak</i>, EH 1:1:5; <i>Teshuvot Yaskil Avdi</i> 6:96.</i>",

In other words, the fact that a <i>get</i> was withheld does not invalidate the right to advance various <i>nezikin</i> claims. We only construe it as financial coercion if the giving of the <i>get</i> will exempt him from the financial burden. However, if he has to pay the financial debt even if he delivers a <i>get</i>, in such a situation the financial pressure is not the cause for giving the <i>get</i>. Subsequently, should his wife waive the debt in exchange for delivery of the <i>get</i>, we are dealing with <i>kefiyah le-devar aher</i> and therefore the halakhic issue of <i>get me’useh</i> does not arise.

                    "Based on such an understanding, should spouses create a family business, we neither seek to identify who infused the most capital into the venture nor who invested more time and effort in developing its growth.

The differing conceptions of the <i>umdana</i> has practical consequences. For the <i>Poskim</i> who view the parameters of the <i>umdana</i> through the prism of secular law, the result will be that the nature of the economic partnership as perceived by the couple will vary from state to state. Those couples who reside in a state which recognizes community property principles relating to the division of marital assets will expect that both spouses are entitled to an equal share of the marriage. Other couples who reside in a state which have adopted equitable distribution rules for dividing up marital assets will expect that both spouses are entitled to an equitable share of the marriage, each share being equal or a certain percentage of the value of the marital asset. And depending on the individual state law, the assets which are to be divided up may be limited to tangible assets such as a home, a car or a business to the exclusion of career assets. On the other hand, in accordance with <i>R.

While adopting one model of “<i>isha noseit ve-notenet betokh ha-bayit</i>” leads one to the conclusion that a husband is solely responsible for any debt incurred even if his wife cosigned the loan, recognizing the notion that marriage is an economic partnership – based upon the validity of the <i>tena’im</i> or an <i>umdana</i> that the parties agreed to abide by secular law – indicates that the wife is responsible for half of the business debts, provided that the capital investment was the same for both spouses, and that she should receive half of the business’s net value. While recognizing the wife’s contribution to the business or as a homemaker leads to the conclusion that she should receive a fair portion of the business, adopting the tripartite marital property classification would entail awarding the entire net value of the business to her husband. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For an identical conclusion reached by a Tel Aviv Rabbinical Court regarding stock shares owned by a husband, see Avraham Sheinfeld, “Special Circumstances in Property Division” [Hebrew], 3 <i>Shurat ha-Din</i> (5755), 136.

Accordingly, if two parties … enter into a contract and stipulate that any dispute with regard to fulfillment of the terms of the contract is to be resolved by a rabbinic court in accordance with, for example, the laws of the State of Delaware, the stipulation is void by virtue of being inconsistent with biblical law (<i>matneh al mah she-katuv ba-Torah</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">J.

Alternatively, one may argue that one may not stipulate against what is written in the Torah only when one wishes to nullify what is written there. However, if one stipulates for himself that he does not want to avail himself of a benefit accorded by Halakhah, such a stipulation is understood to mean that the individual waives a privilege accorded to him by Halakhah, and therefore such an agreement is valid.

                    "Had the couple in this case agreed to have their affairs governed by secular law, the issue of how marital assets and debts would be divided between them would vary from state to state.

If they had been residents of an equitable distribution system state, such as New Jersey and New York, where marital property is divided “fairly” based on a weighing of various factors, the <i>beit din</i> would have arrived at an equitable determination regarding how to address the matter of the outstanding debt and distribution of the net value of the venture between the divorcing couple."

In fact, Dr. Springlass confirmed (in writing and via the telephone during a <i>beit din</i> hearing) that R.

Consequently, the reconfirmation of the alleged <i>shtar matanah</i> in the presence of witnesses, which took place in 2007, had no validity. Hence, in the absence of an authenticated <i>shtar matanah</i> to the contrary, their father’s assets ought to be divided according to the Torah laws of inheritance.

Quite to the contrary, he crafted this document (which he intended to be a <i>shtar matanah</i>) in total privacy from his family. By his own admission, the <i>Tove’a</i> knew of its existence many years before the execution of the addendum and lodged no protest of fraud.

Consequently, the <i>Tove’a</i>, as trustee, is to be construed as a <i>shomer</i>. Moreover, given the fact the <i>Tove’a</i> receives remuneration for his services, whether a trust is subject to the laws of bailment is irrelevant; he is a <i>po’el</i> (a worker), and is therefore accorded the responsibility of a <i>shomer</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">316</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Baruch Kahane, <i>Shomerim</i> [Hebrew] (Jerusalem: 1998), 1334.</i>",

In our case, in which the <i>Tove’a</i> is a potential heir as well, the need to be above suspicion is of paramount significance.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">319</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Teshuvot Maharit</i>, HM 2:1, who writes that for this reason, among others, a trustee of a charitable foundation may not sell some of its assets to a relative.
