            "Coercing a Husband to Give a Get": [
                "Unfortunately, in the midst of a bitter divorce, a husband might sometimes withhold a <i>get </i>(Jewish bill of divorce) from his wife. This chapter discusses when a <i>beit din </i>(religious court) may coerce a husband to give his wife a <i>get </i>and defines what the Halachah considers coercion. Although coercion generally invalidates a <i>get</i>, sometimes a <i>beit din </i><b>is </b>halachically permitted to coerce the husband even \"with whips.\"",
                "<i><b>Talmudic Background</b></i>",
                "The Mishnah (Ketubot 77a) states:",
                "And these are forced to divorce: one who is afflicted with boils, one afflicted with severe halitosis, one who gathers dog excrement, a copper miner, and a tanner, regardless of whether these blemishes developed before or after the marriage.",
                "According to the accepted view in the Mishnah, a <i>beit din </i>does not force the husband to divorce if the woman specifically stated before the marriage that she would tolerate a husband with these defects. The Shulchan Aruch (E.H. 154:1) codifies these laws as normative. The Gemara (<i>ad. loc.</i>) adds that a <i>beit din </i>coerces a husband to give a <i>get </i>when his marriage contravenes Halachah, such as the marriage of a <i>kohein </i>to a divorcee.",
                "In addition to the cases enumerated in the above Mishnah, where the husband is <b>forced </b>(<i>kofin</i>) to divorce, there are other cases (e.g. Ketubot 70a-71a) where the Mishnah states that a husband should divorce his wife (<i>yozti</i>). In these cases, it is not clear if a <i>beit din </i>may force him to do so. Examples of these cases include one who forbids his wife to wear jewelry and one who forbids his wife to visit her father. The Shulchan Aruch (E.H. 154:21) first cites <i>Rishonim </i>that permit coercing a husband to give a <i>get </i>even in a <i>yotzi </i>situation. He then cites an opinion that the husband may merely be told that the rabbis require him to give a <i>get</i>. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Both these opinions appear in <i>Tosafot </i>(Ketubot 70a s.v. <i>Yotzi</i>) and the Rosh (Yevamot 6:11). <i>Tosafot </i>believe that the husband may be coerced, and they cite Rabbeinu Chananeil as forbidding coercion. The Rosh rules that we must follow Rabbeinu Chananeil's view in order to avoid any concern of invalidating a <i>get</i>.\\</i> If he refuses, he may be called a sinner, but he may not be coerced. The Rama rules in accordance with the latter opinion.",
                "<i><b>Ma'us Alai</b></i>",
                "Beyond listing specific cases, the Mishnah does not specify any guiding principles for determining when to coerce a husband. Great debate thus exists among <i>Rishonim </i>regarding the ability to coerce a husband to divorce in other cases where the marriage appears doomed.",
                "One extreme position is that of the Rambam (<i>Hilchot Ishut </i>14:8). He rules that whenever a woman claims <i>ma'us alai </i>(that she cannot tolerate her husband), the husband can be physically coerced to divorce her. He explains that a woman \"is not a captive that she must cohabit with a man whom she hates.\"",
                "<i>Tosafot </i>(Ketubot 63b s.v. <i>Aval</i>) cite Rabbeinu Chananeil, Rashi, and Rabbeinu Tam as opposing the Rambam's position. Rabbeinu Tam argues that a woman who claims that her husband is \"intolerable\" may simply desire to leave her husband for another man. The Mishnah's detailed list of which men are coerced appears to support Rabbeinu Tam's view. It only makes sense to have such a list if most husbands <b>cannot </b>be coerced, whereas according to the Rambam, any husband may be coerced if his wife is unhappy. Most authorities accept Rabbeinu Tam's view (Beit Shmuel 77:8 and Chelkat Mechokeik 77:5).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See, however, <i>Teshuvot Heichal Yitzchak </i>(E.H. 1:2) who, while he does not fully adopt the Rambam's position, considers employing it to a limited extent.</i>",
                "<i><b>Coercing a \"Rebellious\" Husband</b></i>",
                "Although the Halachah does not follow the Rambam's view, there are certain cases beyond those specifically listed in the Mishnah where some authorities permit forcing the husband to divorce. The Shulchan Aruch and Rama (E.H. 154:3) rule that a husband who refuses to support or cohabit with his wife should initially be ordered to do so. If he persists in his refusal, the Halachah considers him \"rebellious\" and <i>beit din </i>may coerce him to give a <i>get</i>. In his <i>Beit Yosef </i>(E.H. 154 s.v. <i>Ha'omeir</i>), the author of the Shulchan Aruch explains that the Gemara (Ketubot 77a) cites a dispute regarding whether it is better to force such a husband to support his wife or to coerce him to divorce her. While the <i>Rishonim </i>debate which view to accept, the <i>Beit Yosef </i>cites the Ran and Rambam, who claim that all would permit coercing the husband to divorce once attempts to make him support his wife have failed. In the Shulchan Aruch, he extends this ruling to a husband who refuses cohabitation.",
                "Despite the cogency of the <i>Beit Yosef</i>'s reasoning, the Pitchei Teshuvah (E.H. 154:7) cites the author of the Shach (<i>Gevurat Anashim </i>28 and 48) as prohibiting coercion even when the husband refuses support and cohabitation. He argues that perhaps those authorities that rule that the husband should be coerced to <b>support </b>his wife would not permit coercing a <i><b>get </b></i>even when the husband resists the pressure to support her.",
                "In practice, the <i>Aruch Hashulchan </i>(E.H. 154:20-21), Rav Yitzchak Elchanan Spektor (<i>Teshuvot Be'er Yitzchak </i>1:10), and Rav Moshe Feinstein (<i>Teshuvot Igrot Moshe</i>, E.H. 1:137) all rule in accordance with the Shulchan Aruch and Rama and permit forcing such a husband to give a <i>get</i>.",
                "<i><b>Additional Cases that May Warrant Coercion</b></i>",
                "Beyond those cases that the Gemara specifies, it is difficult to establish what warrants coercion, so disputed cases abound. Examples include a husband who converts out of Judaism but does not prevent his wife from observing <i>mitzvot</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the husband obstructs his wife's observance of <i>mitzvot</i>, such as if he prevents her from keeping the laws of family purity or feeds her non-kosher food, all agree that he may be coerced to give a <i>get </i>(Rama, E.H. 154:1).</i> an epileptic husband<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For a discussion of epilepsy in Halachah, see <i>Techumin </i>(14:352-365).</i> (see Rama, E.H. 154:1,5), a husband whose wife committed adultery (see <i>Teshuvot Heichal Yitzchak</i>, E.H. 1:1), and a husband whose wife gives a convincing explanation (<i>amatla mevoreret</i>) of why she finds him intolerable (<i>ma'us alai</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For a summary of the debate on this issue, see <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer </i>(vol. 3, E.H. 18).</i> A case in the Shulchan Aruch (E.H. 154:5) best illustrates the reluctance to coerce when the Gemara does not explicitly mandate it. In this case, a woman claims that her father married her off to a mentally unstable husband because he lacked the financial status to find her anyone better. She says that she thought she could tolerate marriage to this man, but now she finds it intolerable, as he is deranged, and she fears that he will kill her. The Shulchan Aruch rules that such a man cannot be coerced to give a <i>get</i>, \"for we only coerce those whom the Rabbis have mentioned.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Of course, the <i>Aruch Hashulchan </i>(E.H. 154:11) notes that the woman is not required to continue living with such a husband.</i>",
                "<i><b>Executing the Coercion</b></i>",
                "Even when coercion is mandated, the Mishnah (Gittin 88b) states that it is only valid when done under the auspices of a Jewish (rabbinical) court. If non-Jews force the husband, the <i>get </i>is unacceptable. Nevertheless, the Mishnah does permit a non- Jew to administer the actual coercion, provided that he orders the husband to \"do what the Jews are telling you to do.\" <i>Rishonim </i>and <i>Acharonim </i>debate how explicitly the non-Jew must link his actions to the <i>beit din</i>'s ruling.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Rav Tzvi Gartner's <i>Kefiyah B'get </i>14.</i>",
                "The parameters of acceptable non-Jewish involvement in coercion are critical in many situations today. For example, it is common for couples (before or after marriage) to sign binding arbitration agreements that submit any divorce proceedings to the jurisdiction of a particular rabbinical court. If the <i>beit din </i>subsequently rules that the husband may be coerced to give a <i>get</i>, it is halachically acceptable for a civil court to enforce the <i>beit din</i>'s ruling. Although the civil court system is implementing the coercion, it is merely ordering the husband to obey the <i>beit din</i>. On the other hand, if the judge orders a husband to give a <i>get </i>absent the instructions of a <i>beit din</i>, the subsequent <i>get </i>is very problematic.",
                "<i><b>Conclusion</b></i>",
                "The Halachah does not always permit coercing a husband to give a <i>get</i>. As <i>Tosafot </i>(Ketubot 70a s.v. <i>Yotzi</i>) write, \"No man can be coerced to divorce until clear proof [to permit this] is found.\" Accordingly, coercion must be used sparingly and only under eminent rabbinical guidance."

                "Prenuptial agreements are fast becoming an increasingly common phenomenon at Orthodox weddings. This chapter addresses the prenuptial agreement formulated by Rav Mordechai Willig, in cooperation with two Israeli authorities, Rav Zalman Nechemia Goldberg and Rav Chaim Zimbalist.",
                "<i><b>Introduction</b></i>",
                "The need for a halachically valid prenuptial agreement is well documented. Often, a spouse withholds a <i>get </i>(Jewish divorce document) as leverage in seeking money or child custody, or simply to inflict pain on an estranged partner. As a member of the Beth Din of Elizabeth since 1993, this author has witnessed many situations in which both women and men have suffered at the hands of recalcitrant spouses. Twice, a recalcitrant husband agreed to give a <i>get </i>only because he had signed a proper prenuptial agreement. Other rabbis and laymen report similar experiences.",
                "<i><b>The Problem of Coercion</b></i>",
                "Formulating a halachically sound agreement is far from simple. One cannot simply sign an agreement to give or receive a <i>get </i>in case of a civil divorce. Such an agreement is not halachically valid, because it is a <i>kinyan devarim</i>, a commitment merely to perform an action, and lacks any monetary consideration.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Rambam (<i>Hilchot Mechirah </i>5:14), Biur Hagra (Even Ha'ezer 134:12), and Beit Shmuel (E.H. 134:7). The Tel Aviv Rabbinical Court has twice refused to enforce this type of commitment by a husband to give a <i>get </i>(<i>Piskei Din Rabbaniyim </i>8:179 and 8:358-361).</i> Furthermore, a husband must give a <i>get </i>without coercion. If a man is wrongly coerced to give his wife a <i>get</i>, the <i>get </i>is not valid, and the couple remains married.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rambam, <i>Hilchot Geirushin </i>2:20 and Shulchan Aruch, Even Ha'ezer 134:7-8. We discuss this topic at greater length in the chapter entitled \"Coercing a Husband to Give a <i>Get</i>.\"</i> Accordingly, a rabbinical court may not coerce a husband to give his wife a <i>get </i>even if he promised to do so before their marriage. In addition, Rabbeinu Gershom instituted that a wife’s consent is necessary in a <i>get </i>proceeding (Rama, Even Ha’ezer 119:6). In fact, Rav Akiva Eiger (Even Ha’ezer 119:4) cites the opinion of the Maharam of Mintz that, following Rabbeinu Gershom’s enactment, a woman who is coerced to accept a <i>get </i>is not divorced.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Also see <i>Teshuvot Noda Biy'hudah </i>(Even Ha'ezer 1:75), <i>Aruch Hashulchan </i>(E.H. 119:16), and Rav Yehuda Amital's article in <i>Daf Kesher </i>(1:141-142).</i> Therefore, a prenuptial agreement must be formulated in a way that does not inappropriately coerce either party to participate in the <i>get </i>procedure.",
                "<i><b>The Problem of Monetary Penalty</b></i>",
                "One possible formulation obligates whichever party refuses to take part in a <i>get </i>ceremony to pay a set sum of money to the aggrieved spouse on a daily basis. Such an agreement goes beyond a mere <i>kinyan devarim</i>, as it includes a monetary commitment. Nevertheless, this agreement remains halachically questionable, because it may constitute improper coercion to participate in a <i>get</i>. Nearly all authorities consider financial pressure to be coercion and only permit its use when Halachah permits coercion.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Kefiyah B'get </i>(Chapters 95-100) for a thorough discussion of the status of financial coercion.</i>",
                "<i>Rishonim </i>debate the Halachah regarding one who gives a <i>get </i>only for fear of paying a fine imposed upon himself (see <i>Beit Yosef, </i>E.H.134). The Maharik rules that the husband is giving the <i>get </i>of his own free will, because he voluntarily agreed to pay this monetary penalty. The Rashba, on the other hand, asserts that this constitutes coercion. The Rama (E.H. 134:5) cites, as a normative compromise approach, that initially (<i>lechatchilah</i>) the penalty should be eliminated before the husband gives the <i>get</i>. However, if the husband already gave a <i>get </i>to his wife out of fear of monetary penalty (<i>bedi'eved</i>), the <i>get </i>is considered acceptable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Taz (E.H. 134:6), Gra (E.H. 134:14), and <i>Chazon Ish </i>(E.H. 99:5), who endorse the Rama's decision, and Pitchei Teshuvah (E.H. 134:10) and <i>Aruch Hashulchan </i>(E.H. 134:26-29) for a critique of this ruling from <i>Teshuvot Mishkenot Yaakov </i>(38). Also, see Pitchei Teshuvah (E.H. 50:8).</i>",
                "Due to the controversy surrounding it, halachic authorities have not endorsed an agreement that includes a self-imposed monetary penalty. In fact, this author saw Rav Zalman Nechemia Goldberg (in 1993, as a member of the Jerusalem Rabbinate District Court) refuse to perform a <i>get </i>for a couple with a separation agreement that penalized the husband for withholding a <i>get</i>.",
                "<i><b>Binding Arbitration Agreements</b></i>",
                "Despite the potential pitfalls, at least two ways of constructing a halachically acceptable prenuptial agreement do exist.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For a discussion of two alternative formulations, see Rav J. David Bleich's <i>Bintivot Hahalacha </i>pp. 3-20 and <i>Contemporary Halakhic Problems </i>3:329-343.</i> The first is a binding arbitration agreement in which husband and wife bind themselves to the jurisdiction of a particular <i>beit din</i>. This agreement requires a recalcitrant party to obey the ruling of the chosen <i>beit din</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The agreement requires specifying the <i>beit din </i>to be used, because a New York court (Pal v. Pal, 45 A.D.2d at 739, 356 N.Y.S.2d at 673) has ruled that the secular courts may not convene a <i>beit din </i>on behalf of the parties. See Rav J. David Bleich's discussion of this point in <i>The Journal of Halacha and Contemporary Society </i>(p. 38) and Rav Willig's essay in <i>The Prenuptial Agreement: Halakhic and Pastoral Considerations </i>(pp. 29-35).</i> and a secular court would presumably enforce the <i>beit din</i>’s ruling. This agreement is halachically acceptable because it does not coerce either side to give or receive a <i>get</i>. The couple does not agree to participate in a <i>get </i>ceremony; rather, they merely agree to obey the ruling of a particular <i>beit din</i>. Rav J. David Bleich drafted an example of such an agreement (<i>The Journal of Halacha and Contemporary Society </i>7:25-41). In fact, Rav Moshe Feinstein (<i>Teshuvot Igrot Moshe</i>, Even Ha’ezer 4:107) finds no halachic problems with this type of document. This agreement empowers a <i>beit din </i>by making it likely that a civil court will enforce its ruling. For example, if a <i>beit din </i>rules that a husband must give a <i>get</i>, the wife may petition the civil court to force him to honor the arbitration agreement that he signed. This coercion is halachically acceptable, as the civil court merely enforces the ruling of the <i>beit din</i>, and the <i>beit din </i>may sometimes coerce a man to give a <i>get</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In limited instances, Halachah permits a <i>beit din </i>to physically coerce a man to give a <i>get</i>; see Ketubot (77a), Gittin (88b), and Shulchan Aruch (Even Ha'ezer 134:7 and 154). Physical coercion is illegal according to United States law, but American courts can compel a husband to obey the <i>beit din </i>when he has signed a binding arbitration agreement. While Halachah never permits civil courts to independently coerce a husband to give a <i>get</i>, it does permit civil courts to enforce the rulings of a proper <i>beit din </i>(Shulchan Aruch, E.H. 134:9; Beit Shmuel 134:15). For further discussion of the interface between halachic prenuptial agreements and American law, see Rav Yitzchak (Irving) Breitowitz's <i>Between Religious and Civil Law: The Plight of the Agunah in American Society </i>(pp. 77-162).</i>",
                "<i><b>A Financial Arrangement for Separation</b></i>",
                "Rabbis Goldberg, Willig, and Zimbalist added a financial agreement to supplement the binding arbitration agreement.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Willig notes that a husband who feels uneasy with the financial agreement should still sign a binding arbitration agreement. Nonetheless, Rav Willig stresses that there is a \"substantial advantage\" to signing a prenuptial agreement with the financial component (<i>The Prenuptial Agreement: Halakhic and Pastoral Considerations</i>, pp. 34-35).</i> It is based on an agreement formulated by the famed Rav Yaakov of Lissa to provide financial motivation for giving a <i>get, </i>but in a manner that does not constitute coercion (<i>Torat Gittin </i>134:4 s.v. <i>Kenasot</i>; cited in Pitchei Teshuvah 134:9).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Yaakov of Lissa's document differs slightly from the current prenuptial agreement in one notable way. Couples signed his agreement as part of the divorce settlement, whereas couples sign the current agreement before the marriage. This does not appear to impact the efficacy of the prenuptial agreement, as the time of its signing is irrelevant.</i> The husband waives his halachic rights to his wife’s earnings (<i>ma’asei yadayim</i>) while maintaining his obligation to support her. The man is thus motivated to give a <i>get </i>in order to release himself from his financial obligation to his estranged wife. This is not coercion because the husband’s financial obligations are a result of the marriage and are <b>not </b>a punishment for withholding a <i>get</i>. Therefore, he gives a <i>get </i>out of dissatisfaction with his marriage and not because of outside coercion. Concerns of invalidating a <i>get </i>only arise when a financial penalty is <b>directly linked </b>to the <i>get </i>(see next chapter).",
                "Based on Rav Yaakov of Lissa’s idea, the three contemporary rabbis devised a prenuptial agreement for use today. The husband agrees to pay $100 per day<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This sum can vary depending on the couple's financial status and geographical location. For instance, Rav Yaakov Kermaier (of Hong Kong) told this author in 1998 that $300 a day was necessary for daily support in Hong Kong, due to the high cost of living. Such an amount would likely invalidate a prenuptial agreement in New York, except for unusually wealthy people.</i> to support his wife in case they do not maintain domestic residence.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As a possible alternative, Rav Elazar Meyer Teitz has suggested that the obligation commence after the completion of a civil divorce. This formulation would allow for reconciliation after the separation without any financial pressure. Additionally, it could help prevent an unscrupulous wife from separating without a <i>get </i>in order to collect money from her husband. Rav Teitz's suggestion is not viewed as linking the financial agreement to the <i>get</i>, because the civil divorce is halachically insignificant.</i> This obligation remains in effect for the duration of the halachic marriage. In addition, the husband waives his rights to the <i>ma’asei yadayim </i>of his wife. The document carefully avoids linking the husband’s support obligation to his giving a <i>get</i>.",
                "The wife cannot sign a parallel agreement, obligating herself to support her husband after separation, as the Halachah does not require a woman to support her husband. The husband is protected in most instances by the binding arbitration agreement, as <i>batei din </i>are more willing to rule that a wife must receive a <i>get </i>than to rule that a husband must give a <i>get</i>. The husband’s consent is biblically mandated, whereas requiring the wife’s consent was instituted much later by Rabbeinu Gershom. Since <i>dayanim </i>are extremely hesitant in forcing a husband to give a <i>get</i>, it is more important that a financial incentive be given to the husband to participate in a <i>get</i>.",
                "One potential danger of this agreement is that an unscrupulous wife may refuse to accept the <i>get </i>in order to collect more money. The husband is protected from this by a clause that ends the monetary obligation if the wife refuses to follow a ruling or recommendation of the specified <i>beit din</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Aryeh David Klapper of Boston has suggested adding the following clause to further protect husbands from unscrupulous wives: \"Furthermore, the sum shall be deemed forfeit unless Bride actually notifies Groom in writing on the first day of the weekly period that she intends to collect the sum. Said written notification must include her notarized signature.\" Rav Basil Herring of the Orthodox Caucus told this author that the Caucus is currently attempting to further refine the prenuptial agreement.</i>",
                "<i><b>Avoiding Asmachta</b></i>",
                "Another possible problem with a prenuptial agreement is <i>asmachta</i>. This term refers to a financial obligation that someone accepts out of the mistaken belief that he will never have to pay it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We discuss the issue of <i>asmachta </i>at greater length in the chapter entitled \"The Torah's View of Gambling.\"</i> The Halachah invalidates any agreement deemed to constitute <i>asmachta</i>. The clauses “<i>mei’achshav</i>” (that the obligation begins as of the signing of the agreement) and “<i>kanu beveit din chashuv</i>” (that the husband accepts the obligation in an esteemed <i>beit din</i>) have been added to overcome this problem. By beginning the obligation immediately, the husband shows that he takes the obligation seriously and accepts that he might actually have to pay it (Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat 207:14- 15). The effect of declaring that the agreement was made before an esteemed <i>beit din </i>is beyond the scope of our discussion.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Encyclopedia Talmudit </i>(2:111-112) for a review of the different theories.</i> Although an esteemed <i>beit din </i>is not necessarily present at every wedding, the Rama (C.M. 207:15) rules that the husband’s acceptance <b>as if </b>such a <i>beit din </i>is present suffices (<i>hoda’at ba’al din kemei’ah eidim dami</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Nachalat Shivah </i>(23) presents a <i>shetar chatzi zachar </i>(document to grant a daughter inheritance) in which <i>mei'achshav </i>is employed to avoid a problem of <i>asmachta</i>. In fact, Rav Zalman Nechemia Goldberg told this author that this formula is accepted by the <i>Ketzot </i>(281:6), the <i>Netivot </i>(281:9), and the <i>Chatam Sofer </i>(<i>Teshuvot</i>, C.M. 144). Both Rav Feivel Cohen (<i>Kuntress Midor L’dor </i>pp. 13-14 in the Hebrew section) and Rav Yaakov Blau (<i>Pitchei Choshen </i>8:175 note 5) use \"<i>kanu beveit din chashuv</i>\" to avoid a problem of <i>asmachta </i>in their respective versions of a <i>shetar chatzi zachar</i>. See, however, <i>Bintivot Hahalachah </i>1:21-31. Rav Zalman Nechemia suggested to this author that even if one considers his and Rav Willig’s prenuptial agreement to constitute an <i>asmachta, </i>the agreement would not create a problem of an improperly coerced <i>get</i>. He explained the document carefully avoids linking the husband's support obligation to his giving of a <i>get</i>.</i>",
                "Rav Hershel Schachter has told this author another reason why this prenuptial agreement is not an <i>asmachta</i>. The problem of <i>asmachta </i>only arises when one commits to an <b>exorbitant </b>sum, which he undoubtedly does not plan on paying. In this case, however, the husband is agreeing to pay a <b>reasonable </b>sum for supporting his wife.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Bava Metzia (104a), <i>Tosafot </i>(Bava Metzia 66a s.v. <i>Uminyumei</i>), and Shulchan Aruch (C.M. 207:15). Even when the money is punitive, not all authorities consider small monetary penalties to be coercion (see Pitchei Teshuvah, E.H. 134:11, and <i>Teshuvot Heichal Yitzchak</i>, E.H. 1:1:52).</i>",

Rav Yosef Eliyahu Henkin (<i>Eidut Leyisrael </i>46) writes that \"one who withholds a <i>get </i>because of unjust monetary demands is a thief\" and compares such behavior to murder. Rav Yaakov Kaminetsky (in a letter printed in the beginning of Rav Tzvi Gartner's <i>Kefiyah B'get</i>) derides men who unfairly withhold <i>gittin </i>as \"oppressors\" and urges helping their wives.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This attitude appears to be rooted in a ruling of Rabbeinu Yerucham (<i>Sefer Mei'sharim </i>23:8).</i> The Rama describes one possible way to help obtain a <i>get </i>without coercion (E.H. 154:21):",
                "[In] any situation where the Halachah does not permit the husband to be coerced with whips [to give a <i>get</i>], the husband may not be excommunicated. Nevertheless, [the <i>beit din</i>] can issue a decree that all Jews must withhold any favors from the recalcitrant spouse and refrain from engaging in business with him, circumcising his sons, burying his deceased relatives, and any other sanction which <i>beit din </i>wishes short of excommunication.",
                "Rabbeinu Tam initiated these sanctions, so they are known as <i>harchakot d'Rabbeinu Tam</i>. The halachic basis for these sanctions is that a man cannot be <b>coerced </b>to give a <i>get</i>, but <b>withdrawing favors </b>from him is allowed. Coercion refers specifically to threatening a husband with physical harm or with having his property taken away. Here, no harm is done; rather, things that might have been bestowed are withheld.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are also other theories of why <i>harchakot d'Rabbeinu Tam </i>do not constitute coercion. See Rav Tzvi Gartner's <i>Kefiyah B'get </i>(118:3-4).</i>",
                "Not all authorities agree with Rabbeinu Tam and the Rama. The author of the Shach (<i>Gevurot Anashim </i>72, cited by Pitchei Teshuvah, E.H. 154:30) believes that these sanctions <b>are </b>coercive. The <i>Chazon Ish </i>(E.H. 108:12) rules in accordance with the Shach’s strict view. On the other hand, the <i>Aruch Hashulchan </i>(E.H. 154:63) rules in accordance with Rabbeinu Tam and the Rama that these sanctions do not constitute coercion. This is also the view of Rav Bezalel Ashkenazi (<i>Teshuvot </i>6 and 19), the Maharam Lublin (<i>Teshuvot </i>1), the <i>Eliah Rabbah </i>(13), and Rav Yitzchak Herzog (<i>Techukah Leyisrael Al Pi Hatorah </i>3:202,209 and <i>Teshuvot Heichal Yitzchak </i>E.H 1:1).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Herzog even suggests that placing someone in American prison does not constitute coercion, noting that the classical coercion described in rabbinical sources is flogging, and being imprisoned in America is not as bad as being flogged.

                "Moreover, a student of this author suggests that the Shach’s argument does not apply today. He argues that imposing <i>harchakot d'Rabbeinu Tam </i>in the Shach's time (seventeenth-century Poland) was as severe as excommunication (<i>nidui</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The excommunication described by the Shulchan Aruch (Yoreh De'ah 3:34) is more severe than <i>harchakot d'Rabbeinu Tam</i>. It precludes counting the excommunicated person in a <i>minyan </i>or eating with him and prohibits him from washing his clothes, wearing leather shoes, or cutting his hair. As we have cited from the Rama, excommunicating a recalcitrant husband in this manner for refusing to give a <i>get </i>constitutes coercion.</i> During that period, Jews depended on each other for earning a livelihood. However, <b>sanctions </b>in our communities certainly have less impact than <b>excommunication </b>in previous generations, due to our lack of communal unity. Thus, it is likely that even the Shach would not object to imposing <i>harchakot d'Rabbeinu Tam </i>in our communities. However, it is possible that they remain coercive according to the Shach in a cohesive Chassidic community.",
                "In practice, many <i>batei din </i>adopt a compromise approach. They impose <i>harchakot d'Rabbeinu Tam </i>only when the wife unilaterally decides to end the marriage (<i>to'enet ma'us alai</i>) and provides a reasonable basis (<i>amatla mevoreret</i>) for her actions (see <i>Birurim B'hilchot Hareiyah</i>, p.243). In such a case, many authorities permit full coercion of a husband to give a <i>get </i>(see <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 3, E.H.18). Thus, a double doubt (<i>safeik s'feika</i>) exists regarding the permissibility of <i>harchakot d'Rabbeinu Tam</i>. First, It may be that <i>harchakot d'Rabbeinu Tam </i>are not coercive. Second, perhaps if a woman has an <i>amatla mevoreret </i>for her claim of <i>ma'us alai</i>, then the Halachah permits coercion.",
                "Accordingly, a <i>beit din </i>may impose strict sanctions on many recalcitrant spouses. An example of implementing these sanctions appears recorded in Rav Ovadia Yosef's <i>Teshuvot Yabia Omer </i>(vol. 7, E.H. 23) and Rav Eliezer Waldenberg's <i>Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer </i>(17:51). Rav Ovadia and Rav Waldenberg present a decision of the <i>Beit Din Hagadol </i>of the State of Israel where they, along with Rav Yitzchak Kulitz, imposed <i>harchakot d'Rabbeinu Tam </i>on a recalcitrant husband.

                "Rav Moshe Feinstein (<i>Teshuvot Igrot Moshe</i>, E.H. 4:106) further clarifies precisely what constitutes coercion. He explains that if the judge <b>fines </b>a husband for failing to give a <i>get</i>, this constitutes illicit coercion and invalidates a <i>get</i>. If, however, the civil judge, wanting the husband to give a <i>get</i>, makes the husband pay his wife a great deal of <b>financial support </b>(<i>demei mezonot</i>), the <i>get </i>is undoubtedly valid in Rav Moshe's opinion. Since no <b>formal </b>link exists between the alimony order and the giving of the <i>get</i>, the judge's order is not considered coercive (see Pitchei Teshuvah, E.H.134:11, and 154:4).

It may be, however, that Rav Moshe requires not only that there be no <b>formal </b>linkage between the <i>get </i>and payment, but also that the <b>substantive </b>reason for the payment be to support the wife and not to fine the husband. This difference is critical, should a judge decided to obligate the husband to \"support\" his wife by paying a sum that is well above the cost of living. Rav Yitzchak Breitowitz (<i>Between Civil and Religious Law</i>, p. 137) presents several possibilities of how to understand Rav Moshe's ruling.</i>",
                "This issue is the crux of the debate concerning the halachic validity of the 1992 New York state law. This law (DRL 236B) states that a judge shall consider the effect of either side's refusal to remove barriers to remarriage (in other words, to give or receive a <i>get</i>) when dividing the couple's property and establishing the sum of alimony.",
                "This law can be read as a financial <b>penalty </b>imposed on the husband for his refusal to give a <i>get</i>. According to such a reading, a husband who gives a <i>get </i>to avoid the ramifications of this law is considered coerced, and the <i>get </i>is invalid. Alternatively, one may interpret the law not as a penalty but as a provision for a recalcitrant husband to provide his wife with <b>monetary support</b>. Indeed, Rav Kenneth Auman told this author that he asked two judges how they interpreted this law, and each judge responded by offering one of the two possible interpretations. Rav Tzvi Gartner (<i>Tradition </i>32:3:93) cites two actual court cases that highlight this problem. In the first case, a New York judge used the <i>get </i>law to penalize a recalcitrant spouse for only belatedly participating in a <i>get </i>ceremony. In the second case, the same judge ruled that the <i>get </i>law merely \"addresses the parties' status as they come before the court and how that status will affect their economic futures.\"",
                "Considering that the <i>get </i>law's vagueness is its obvious flaw, Rav Zalman Nechemia Goldberg told this author that the solution to this problem is simple. The law must be amended so that it will unambiguously be a support provision, making its implementation halachically valid according to Rav Feinstein's ruling.",
                "However, this solution is not as easy as it seems. When a civil court judge awards financial support in the form of alimony, Rav Moshe permits performing a <i>get </i>even if the alimony was not warranted according to Halachah. However, halachic authorities hotly debate this matter. Many of them disagree with Rav Moshe and believe that any monetary obligation that a <i>beit din </i>would not impose constitutes coercion to give a <i>get</i>. For example, they believe that if the judge raises the alimony of a recalcitrant husband (which the judge will reduce if the husband gives a <i>get</i>), he is coercing the husband to give a <i>get</i>. Indeed, both Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach and Rav Yosef Shalom Eliashiv (<i>Moriah </i>19:1-2:58-61) rule that the 1992 New York State <i>Get </i>Law is halachically unacceptable and urge its immediate repeal.

If he gave a <i>get</i>, the <i>beit din </i>would recommend early release. Since Halachah does not permit coercing this man to give a <i>get</i>, the question is how to define such a recommendation. One could argue that it constitutes coercion, as it is a punishment of imprisonment for withholding a <i>get</i>. Alternatively, perhaps the <i>beit din </i>is merely offering to do the husband a favor and forgive the husband for his misbehavior if he gives his wife a <i>get</i>.

One who defaults on a debt in America does not receive particularly harsh punishments, so the choice between giving a <i>get </i>or facing the penalties for defaulting on financial obligations is a legitimate choice.</i> Nonetheless, Rav Dichovsky did not concern himself with this responsum of the Mabit, because the Mabit seemingly contradicts himself elsewhere (1:22). In that responsum, he rules that a man who was imprisoned for being a heretic may be denied release from prison until he gives a <i>get</i>. The <i>Simchat Kohein </i>(vol. 3, E.H. 9) suggests a resolution to the contradiction. He claims that even the Mabit permits pressuring the husband with other punishments if the <i>dayanim </i>sincerely desire to punish the husband for his other offenses. The Mabit's strict ruling only relates to situations where the <i>dayanim </i>pursue the unrelated charges in a veiled attempt to obtain a <i>get</i>.

                "The Talmudic concept of <i>hafka'at kiddushin</i>, annulling a marriage, often arises in discussions about how to help <i>agunot</i>, although its practical applications virtually do not exist.",
                "<i><b>The Basis for Hafka'at Kiddushin</b></i>",
                "The notion that <i>Chazal </i>can annul a marriage appears six times in the Gemara.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yevamot 90b, Yevamot 110a, Ketubot 3a, Gittin 33a, Gittin 73a, and Bava Batra 48b.</i> There are two categories of <i>hafka'at kiddushin</i>. One is where the rabbis declare a marriage void due to the unethical behavior involved (see <i>Tosafot</i>, Yevamot 110a s.v. <i>Lefichach</i>). For example, the Gemara in Yevamot (110a) and Bava Batra (48b) describes a husband who physically coerced a woman into consenting to marry him. While such a marriage should technically take effect, the rabbis annul it in response to the man's improper conduct.",
                "The second category consists of cases where the original marriage contained no problems, but a problem arose when the husband attempted to send his wife a <i>get</i>. For example, the Gemara (Ketubot 3a) addresses a husband who embarked on a long journey. Before leaving, he gave his wife a <i>get </i>and stipulated that it would only take effect if he did not return within thirty days. The husband made every effort to return home on time, but he was unable to fulfill the condition due to circumstances entirely beyond his control (<i>oneis</i>). Since the husband had a legitimate excuse for not returning, the <i>get </i>was biblically invalid. Nevertheless, <i>Chazal </i>effected the <i>get </i>through the mechanism of <i>hafka'at kiddushin</i>. In such a situation, it is unclear if the marriage is nullified retroactively<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the opinion of the Ri (<i>Tosafot</i>, Gittin 33a s.v.<i>Ve'afk'inhu</i>), as he indicates that such a <i>get </i>retroactively exonerates a woman who receives it after committing adultery.</i> or if the rabbis merely render the <i>get </i>effective despite the husband's initial wishes.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rashba (<i>Teshuvot </i>1:1162 and commentary to Ketubot 3a), for example, explains that <i>hafka'at kiddushin </i>only serves as a threat in these cases. The Rabbis' assertion that the marriage will be annulled forces the husband to accept the <i>get</i>'s validity, lest his married life be rendered cohabitation outside of marriage. Also see <i>P'nei Yehoshua </i>(Ketubot 3a).</i>",
                "In Gittin 73a, the Gemara speaks of a dangerously ill individual (<i>shechiv meira</i>) who divorced his wife and subsequently regained his health. Technically, his recovery invalidates the <i>get</i>, as the husband clearly gave the <i>get </i>under the assumption that he would die shortly. If he would recover, it was understood that the <i>get </i>would be invalid. Nevertheless, <i>Chazal </i>validate the <i>get </i>by employing <i>hafka'at kiddushin</i>.",
                "The Gemara explains that <i>hafka'at kiddushin </i>works because \"everyone gets married according to the will of the Rabbis.\" In other words, every marriage contains an implicit condition that <i>Chazal </i>must accept it. Accordingly, <i>Chazal </i>may veto a marriage if one contracts it in an unethical manner. Similarly, <i>Chazal </i>may effect a divorce even when the <i>get </i>is invalid on a biblical level. <i>Tosafot </i>(Ketubot 3a s.v. <i>Adaata </i>and Gittin 33a s.v. <i>Kol</i>) note that we explicitly authorize <i>Chazal </i>in this manner, as the groom states that he is marrying his wife \"according to the laws of Moses and Israel\" (\"<i>kedat Moshe veyisrael</i>\").",
                "<i><b>Practical Implementation</b></i>",
                "At first glance, the power to annul marriages seems like the ideal solution to the <i>agunah </i>problem. However, there are major obstacles to its implementation today. First, the basis for it is that husbands declare at their weddings that the Rabbis must consent to the marriage. Accordingly, only a central, recognized rabbinical court, such as the Sanhedrin, may implement <i>hafka'at kiddushin</i>, but no such <i>beit din </i>exists today. As Rav Yitzchak Herzog writes (<i>Techukah Leyisrael Al Pi Hatorah </i>1:76), <i>hafka'at kiddushin </i>may someday become an option if one <i>beit din </i>is accepted by everyone, \"but in the present situation there is nothing to discuss.\"",
                "Another major problem exists with implementing <i>hafka'at kiddushin </i>today. The Gemara records many objectionable marriages that are binding, indicating that the Rabbis do not annul them. For example, <i>Chazal </i>do not annul the marriage of a <i>kohein </i>and a divorcee, although such a marriage is explicitly prohibited by the Torah (Vayikra 21:7).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Teshuvot Binyamin Ze'ev </i>(106) for a list of objectionable marriages where <i>Chazal </i>do not invoke <i>hafka'at kiddushin</i>.</i> While criteria presumably exist to determine when marriages may be annulled, the Gemara never articulates them. The Rashba (Ketubot 3a) provides some insight:",
                "One may ask why a woman should remain an <i>agunah </i>if her husband was lost in a body of water without finite boundaries (<i>mayim she'ein lahem sof</i>). Let the Rabbis annul the marriage! The answer is that the Rabbis do not annul a marriage unless the man has handed his wife a [rabbinically acceptable] <i>get</i>.",
                "This, of course, gives only partial criteria. When a couple marries in a proper manner, the marriage can end only in a <i>get</i>. However, there are objectionable marriage ceremonies that <i>Chazal </i>invalidate through <i>hafka'at kiddushin </i>without requiring a <i>get</i>, whereas other equally objectionable ceremonies remain untouched by <i>Chazal</i>. <i>Chazal </i>annul a marriage ceremony in which the wife was forced to consent, yet refrain from annulling the marriage of a <i>kohein </i>and a divorcee. Elsewhere (<i>Teshuvot </i>1:1185), the Rashba addresses this issue:",
                "We do not say that whenever a husband entered a marriage in an unethical manner the rabbis annulled the marriage. Rather, we believe that only in those specific instances in which <i>Chazal </i>state that the marriage is annulled do we actually annul the marriage.",
                "The Rashba cites the case of someone who appointed another man as his agent to marry a certain woman (Kiddushin 58b). The agent, instead of contracting the marriage on behalf of his friend, married the woman himself. The Gemara states that the \"marriage is valid despite his unethical behavior.\" The Rashba concludes that only in those cases specifically mentioned by <i>Chazal </i>is the marriage annulled.

The Radach (<i>Teshuvot </i>19) explains that <i>Chazal </i>considered <i>hafka'at kiddushin </i>a last resort, to be employed only out of great desperation (<i>machmat dochak gadol</i>).

In both cases, a marriage ceremony was conducted in an improper manner. One might have thus thought that one who violates his community's policy has his marriage declared null and void. Nonetheless, we do not declare the marriage invalid, as we restrict the application of <i>hafka'at kiddushin </i>to the situations that the Gemara specified.

                "The Gemara discusses the halachic validity of a marriage in which the husband discovers defects in his wife that existed before the marriage. The Mishnah (Ketubot 72b) describes a marriage in which the couple articulated no special conditions. After the wedding, the man discovered preexisting physical defects (<i>mumin</i>) in the woman and now wishes to divorce her. The Mishnah teaches that, in such a case, a <i>get </i>is required to terminate the marriage, but the husband is not required to pay the <i>ketubah </i>(which is usually paid when a couple divorces). The Gemara adds that the man is exempt from paying the <i>ketubah </i>only if the defect is one that most people would find intolerable.",

Rather, since the man might have entered the marriage despite the woman's defects, one cannot conclude with certainty that the marriage constitutes <i>kiddushei ta'ut</i>. Thus, a <i>get </i>is required for the woman to remarry. The husband is not required to pay the <i>ketubah</i>, as one is never forced to pay a doubtful monetary obligation.

In Yevamot, the Mishnah indicates that if the husband discovered a major defect after the wedding, no <i>get </i>is required to dissolve the marriage.

Furthermore, the marriage under discussion was performed by a Conservative rabbi, so this created additional grounds for leniency (see <i>Techumin </i>18:84-91).</i> a man who concealed that he was a practicing homosexual prior to the marriage (E.H. 4:113), and a man who concealed that he converted to another religion (E.H. 4:83). In the last case, however, Rav Moshe hesitated to permit the woman to remarry without a <i>get</i>, as she did not observe Torah law. It must be clear beyond the shadow of a doubt that the woman never would have married such a man. However, since this woman did not practice Judaism seriously, Rav Moshe questioned whether we can assume that she would never marry an apostate.",
                "Similarly, Rav Yitzchak Herzog (<i>Teshuvot Heichal Yizchak</i>, E.H. 2:25) appears to fundamentally accept Rav Moshe's premise. Nonetheless, Rav Herzog did not permit a Sephardic sixteen-year-old girl to remarry without a <i>get </i>after she married a man in his forties whom she thought was significantly younger. Although the girl had been deceived, Rav Herzog explained that one could not state unequivocally that a sixteen-year-old girl in such a community would never marry a man in his forties.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rama (E.H. 42:4) notes that we do not rule in matters of marriage based on assumptions (<i>umdenot</i>). The <i>Aruch Hashulchan </i>(E.H. 42:8) claims that this principle even applies to undocumented information that appears obvious (<i>umdena demuchach</i>), while the <i>Chazon Ish </i>(E.H. 52:3) permits basing a ruling on obvious information. The rulings of Rav Moshe and Rav Herzog appear to make similar assumptions to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>.</i>",
                "Rav Moshe issued his ruling about an impotent husband in 1951 and his ruling about an institutionalized husband in 1955. The present availability of psychiatric drugs allows for treating many psychiatric illnesses and casts doubt upon whether he would have ruled this way today. Similarly, impotence can be treated and cured in most cases today. It is thus unclear if a woman today would undoubtedly refuse to marry a man with either of these ailments. Even some homosexuals, with the help of psychotherapy, can lead a healthy married life.",
                "Moreover, Rav Moshe did not rely on the woman's testimony alone to verify the husband's impotence and mental illness. Rather, the rabbis involved in the case examined the medical records of the husbands, and the doctors even testified that they unsuccessfully tried to cure one husband's impotence. In today's society, it is highly unlikely that such information would be forthcoming from medical officials.",

                "It is extremely difficult to permit either partner in a marriage to remarry solely based upon <i>kiddushei ta'ut</i>. Every effort should be made to obtain a <i>get </i>even when major defects are discovered in either spouse. For a defect to be considered as grounds for <i>kiddushei ta'ut</i>, it must be clear beyond the shadow of a doubt that virtually no one would marry a person with the defect. Moreover, the defect must already be in existence before the marriage.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This requirement is not unique to marriage. In every business transaction, the consumer can renege on a deal by claiming that he bought defective merchandise only if the defect existed before the sale. Otherwise, every consumer who had bad luck with his product could undo the deal.

            "Flaws in the Proposal of Rabbi Emanuel Rackman": [
                "An advertisement appeared in the <i>Jewish Week </i>(August 28, 1998) presenting the procedures for annulling a marriage based on <i>kiddushei ta'ut </i>(see previous chapter). The advertisement added that these principles guide the practice of the <i>Beit Din Zedek LiBaiayot Agunot, </i>which Rabbis Emanuel Rackman and Moses Morgenstern operate.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">After publication of the advertisement, it was reported that Rabbis Rackman and Morgenstern split from one another.</i> Shortly afterwards, Rabbi Rackman distributed a letter to the membership of the Rabbinical Council of America (dated December 14, 1998) defending the principles outlined in the advertisement. In this chapter, we explain why virtually all Orthodox rabbis reject these procedures (see, for example, Appendix).",
                "<i><b>Abuse of Kiddushei Ta'ut</b></i>",
                "In the previous chapter, we discussed Rav Moshe Feinstein's position that a woman may remarry without a <i>get </i>(based on the principle of <i>kiddushei ta'ut</i>) if she documents that her husband had such serious defects that no woman would knowingly marry him. We concluded our discussion by noting that the defect must have existed before marriage, such that the woman married the husband only because he concealed the defect from her. Rabbi Rackman seeks to apply Rav Moshe's ruling even further. Rabbi Rackman argues that if a husband abused his wife during the course of the marriage, his actions indicate that at the time of the wedding he \"had the seeds\" of an \"abuser personality.\" Since no woman wants to marry an abuser, the marriage is nullified on the grounds of \"<i>kiddushei ta'ut</i>.\" Similarly, a husband who withholds a <i>get </i>undoubtedly had a sadistic personality already at the time of marriage.",
                "Rabbi Rackman's suggestion contains numerous flaws. First, the mere fact that a man has an \"abuser personality\" by no means ensures that he will actually abuse his wife. Although some in the field of psychology believe in determinism, the Rambam (<i>Hilchot Teshuvah </i>5:1) writes that belief in free will is a central element of the halachic worldview. Furthermore, husbands who ultimately abuse may have shown aggressive and controlling tendencies before their marriage, but they did not display any <b>guarantees </b>that they would abuse their wives. Many men who exhibit aggressive and controlling tendencies never end up abusing their wives. Thus, the criterion for <i>kiddushei ta'ut</i>, that no woman would ever agree to marry a man with these tendencies, has not been met. Often, a woman marries a man with some negative character traits, feeling that he is a good person overall and hoping that these negative traits will not manifest themselves in her husband in their worst form. <i>Tosafot </i>(Ketubot 70a s.v. <i>Yotzi</i>) write that we may not coerce a husband to give a get without \"clear proof \" that it is permissible; surely, we require clear proof to void the marriage with no <i>get</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Interestingly, when the Shulchan Aruch (E.H. 154:3) discusses the propriety of coercing a physically abusive husband to give a <i>get</i>, he does not mention the option of declaring the marriage null and void.</i> Certainly, the <i>Jewish Week </i>advertisement's assertion that (emphasis added) \"in <b>every </b>case\" of <i>igun </i>that they had seen, \"the latent defects of the husband gave rise to such abusive behavior as to render them unfit to be husbands\" is quite an extraordinary finding.",
                "Rav Dr. Abraham Twerski (<i>The Shame Borne in Silence: Spouse Abuse in the Jewish Community</i>, pp. 16-18) writes the following regarding the character traits that lead to an abusive husband (emphasis added):",
                "<b>One of the weakest areas in human psychology is prediction of behavior. </b>Psychiatrists are often asked to testify in court about a given person’s potential for violent behavior. The track record of success in predicting behavior is nothing to write home about. The correlation of psychological profiles with actual occurrence or absence of subsequent violence is rather low, and the “hunch” of a non-professional is probably of equal reliability....",
                "There are, however, at least some behavioral clues, which are red flags. Mind you, they are not <b>predictors </b>of abuse, but they do indicate higher risk.... <b>A man may have one or more of these traits or warning signs and not turn out to be an abuser</b>. All we are saying is that any of these traits increase the risk of potentially abusive and controlling behavior.",
                "Rabbi Rackman's suggestion is especially problematic in light of psychotherapies that empower a person to control his anger. A woman who discovers that her husband has a bad temper will likely advise him to see a psychologist before she will regret ever having married him. If this temper later deteriorates into spouse abuse, the marriage remains binding. As Rav Yosef Dov Soloveitchik (cited by Rav Hershel Schachter in <i>Beit Yitzchak </i>29:232) explained (in rejecting Rabbi Rackman's proposal), this situation parallels a businessman who purchased a volatile stock out of hope that its price would rise. Even if the stock's value eventually plummets, he cannot go back to the seller and demand a refund. Just as business entails some level of gambling, so too, in marriage one takes risks (see <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Bava Kama </i>110a s.v. <i>De'adaata</i>). The Beth Din of America summed up this argument well (in a letter to all Rabbinical Council of America members, decrying the actions of Rabbis Rackman and Morgenstern): \"Potential psychological tendencies do not create '<i>kiddushei ta'ut</i>,' since they may remain undeveloped.\"",
                "Even if Rabbi Rackman's idea were acceptable in theory, its implementation contains a significant practical problem. It is often very difficult to formally produce incontrovertible evidence that someone physically abused his spouse (see Rama, E.H. 154:3). Proving that someone had an abuser personality is even more difficult, if not impossible. Similarly, it is exceedingly difficult to prove that one who denies his wife a <i>get </i>had a sadistic personality at the time of marriage. At the very least, the <i>dayanim </i>must see psychological records documenting these tendencies from before the marriage. In Rav Moshe's responsa regarding impotent and institutionalized husbands, official medical records proved the women's claims. On the other hand, <i>The Jerusalem Report </i>(August 3, 1998) disclosed that Rabbi Moses Morgenstern issues his rulings merely based on the woman's word, undoubtedly an unacceptable practice.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See, for example, <i>Teshuvot Noda Biy'hudah </i>(vol. 1, E.H. 54), cited in Pitchei Teshuvah (E.H. 157:9).</i> Rabbis can rarely obtain private medical files in today's litigious society, for doctors do not generally release these records to clergy with the same ease that they may have done in Rav Moshe's time.",
                "<i><b>Lack of Coercion as Grounds for Annulment</b></i>",
                "The <i>Jewish Week </i>advertisement proceeds to present a second argument for annulling marriages without a <i>get</i>. In previous generations, a <i>beit din </i>could coerce a recalcitrant husband,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Jewish Week </i>advertisement correctly notes that coercion is sometimes a viable option, but the advertisement misleadingly presents the Rambam's view as normative. In fact, virtually all later authorities reject the Rambam's criteria for when a <i>beit din </i>may coerce a husband. For the parameters of when Halachah permits coercing a husband to give a <i>get</i>, see our opening chapter, \"Coercing a Husband to Give a <i>Get</i>.\"</i> whereas today violent coercion is illegal and punishable in the United States. Thus, whenever a cruel husband denied a <i>get </i>to his wife, she may claim that had she known that coercion was not possible, she would not have married him.",
                "This argument bears the same fundamental flaw as the previous one. For consideration as grounds for <i>kidushei ta'ut</i>, a problem must be so great at the time of marriage that, without a doubt, no woman would get married in such a situation. Regarding ignorance of the impracticality of coercion, this logic simply does not hold true. It has been known for years that American law prohibits physically coercing husbands to give <i>gittin</i>, yet thousands of Jewish couples marry every year. Each woman, while she obviously does not expect at her wedding that she will someday suffer as an <i>agunah</i>, may recognize that a tiny percentage of marriages unravel into <i>igun</i>. Despite this risk, she marries with the belief that she and her husband will live a happy life together. If things later go wrong, Rav Soloveitchik's analogy to a stock consumer again applies.",
                "No one denies the potential existence of <b>individual </b>women who would never marry if they understood the risks of <i>igun</i>. However, we can only entertain the possibility of <i>kiddushei ta'ut </i>when virtually <b>all </b>women would never marry. In the cases addressed by Rav Moshe, not only did the women immediately leave their husbands, but almost any woman would leave a husband with defects such as homosexuality. In Rabbi Rackman's case, all married women in America, including those who are happily married, live under the potential threat of <i>igun</i>. How many of them immediately abandon their husbands upon discovery of the fact that this threat exists? According to Rabbi Rackman's logic, Jewish marriage does not exist in the United States, as every woman married her husband only out of ignorance of the dangers of <i>igun</i>.",
                "<i><b>Misunderstanding Marriage</b></i>",
                "The <i>Jewish Week </i>advertisement continues by presenting a third reason to treat marriages as <i>kiddushei ta'ut</i>. It argues \"that many women if informed would in no way agree to the <i>kinyan</i>/acquisition nature of <i>kiddushin</i>/marriage.\" The advertisement explains that no woman wishes for her husband to have \"title to the wife's body.\" Consequently, if women understood the true nature of Jewish marriage, they would not agree to marry according to Halachah.",
                "The advertisement mistakenly portrays Orthodox marriage in an extremely negative light in order to prove that no woman would agree to such a marriage. As Rav J. David Bleich (<i>Tradition </i>33:1:115-116) has commented, \"The sole right of which the bride is divested is the capacity to contract a marriage with any other male…. [The advertisement's] description of halakhic marriage is grossly overstated. The husband does not acquire 'title to the wife's body.' A wife is not a slave. The husband acquires a servitude rather than title to her body - an extremely important legal distinction.\" The Rashba (Kiddushin 6b s.v<i>. Iy Neima</i>) explicitly writes that the husband \"does not actually own her body.\" Rav Bleich notes that his female students, including those who are not Orthodox, willingly marry according to Jewish law even after he has taught them the true technical meaning of the ceremony.",
                "Furthermore, one can engage in a halachic transaction even without comprehending the precise theory of the transaction ceremony. As long as a consumer fundamentally understands that he is buying or selling something, the transaction takes effect. Would Rabbi Rackman annul every business transaction if either side were not well versed in tractates Bava Metzia and Bava Batra and their many commentaries?",
                "Even if Rabbi Rackman were correct about the theory of marriage, one major problem with his argument remains. The fact that many halachically knowledgeable women marry under Orthodox auspices proves that not all women consider a halachic ceremony intolerable. If Rabbi Rackman were correct, every woman should leave her husband upon learning of the halachic meaning of marriage. According to Rabbi Rackman, every unlearned married woman is currently living in sin, as she was married under false pretenses and continues to cohabit with her husband.",
                "One final difficulty prevents virtually any application of <i>kiddushei ta'ut</i>. The Chelkat Mechokeik (39:9) and the Beit Shmuel (39:7,16) both note that we only consider claims of <i>kiddushei ta'ut </i>when the spouse lodged a complaint is <b>immediately</b>. If, however, he or she failed to complain about the problem immediately, the absence of a complaint constitutes acceptance of the defect. Even if the husband or wife complains later about the defect, the marriage is <b>undoubtedly valid</b>. The <i>Aruch Hashulchan </i>(E.H. 39:13) also notes that if the couple continues to cohabit as a normal married couple, the marriage certainly takes effect despite the defect. Remaining together indicates that the spouse considers the defect insignificant.",
                "<i><b>Other Claims of the Jewish Week Advertisement</b></i>",
                "The advertisement also contains much critical misinformation about <i>agunah</i>-related issues. It states that \"a single witness, circumstantial evidence, and hearsay\" are all admissible proof to free an <i>agunah</i>. The authors of the advertisement apparently confused the meaning of the term <i>agunah </i>in different contexts. The <i>agunah </i>who may remarry based on questionable evidence is a woman whose husband is presumed dead without clear evidence of the death. The Halachah permits the woman to remarry only with some proof of his death, but the lighter forms of evidence delineated in the advertisement suffice. The Rambam (<i>Hilchot Geirushin </i>13:29) explains that the husband's life or death is a fact that can often be proven even without witnesses. Although the Halachah nonetheless requires some sort of testimony, its relaxes the standards. Whereas we usually require two witnesses, to guarantee that neither is lying, here we assume that a witness will not lie about something that may be determined even without him. The Ra'avad (<i>ibid</i>.) adds that we are lenient about the testimony to free an <i>agunah </i>because we trust the woman to thoroughly research her husband's death before remarriage. Thus, even if a <i>beit din </i>permits the woman to remarry based on shaky evidence, she will presumably not do so without independently verifying her husband's death.",
                "The <i>Jewish Week </i>advertisement refers to a totally different type of women as <i>agunot</i>. These women’s husbands are alive and well but deny them <i>gittin</i>. The advertisement applies the above passage from the Rambam to them, presumably to permit verifying the claims of these <i>agunot </i>with flimsy evidence. However, the Rambam's logic does not apply to these women, because the details of divorce cases, such as whether a husband abused his wife, are not easily discovered. A <i>beit din </i>thus cannot rule on these matters without clear documentation or testimony. As we have already noted, Rav Moshe Feinstein checked medical records before accepting that a husband was impotent or institutionalized and thus invalidating the marriage. Rabbi Moses Morgenstern, on the other hand, has reportedly issued annulments without investigating the claims of the women involved (<i>The Jerusalem Report</i>, August 3, 1998).",
                "The advertisement claims that \"fear of <i>mamzeirut </i>is an illusion.\" In other words, the advertisers deny that the children of a woman who remarries without a <i>get </i>are <i>mamzeirim </i>(progeny of a forbidden union whom the Torah forbids to marry natural-born Jews). Of course, the advertisers recognize that the status of a <i>mamzeir </i>appears explicitly in the Gemara (Yevamot 49a), but they cite a responsum of the Maharsham (1:9, cited by the advertisers simply as 9) as a basis for averting this problem. The Maharsham suggests that a first husband may save his ex-wife's second marriage from being adultery (if she remarried without a <i>get</i>) by giving her a <i>get </i>that retroactively annuls the first marriage.",
                "The advertisement ignores several major problems with implementing such a <i>get</i>. The Maharsham never actually performed such a <i>get </i>and noted that it is fraught with halachic problems. He only suggested it as a theoretical possibility (\"<i>lahalachah velo lema'aseh</i>\"). His hesitancy is particularly relevant when one considers that many other halachic authorities discuss the Maharsham's suggestion, and they almost unanimously reject it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Tzitz Eliezer </i>(15:58) and <i>Minchat Yitzchak </i>(2:66:32). On the other hand, see <i>Heichal Yitzchak </i>(E.H. 2:19). For a thorough discussion and rejection of the Maharsham's proposal, see Rav David Lau's essay in <i>Techumin </i>(17:251-271).</i> Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (<i>Minchat Shlomo </i>1:76) lists six flaws in the Maharsham's idea and flatly rejects its practical implementation.",
                "The most startling part of the advertisement's reference to the Maharsham is that his idea bears no relevance to the situations addressed by the advertisement. The Maharsham dealt with how the first husband can help his remarried ex-wife by doing certain things in the <i>get </i>procedure, while the advertisement addresses husbands who refuse to cooperate with the <i>beit din </i>or the wife in performing a <i>get</i>. Rabbi Rackman later clarified that the advertisers merely wished to demonstrate from the Maharsham's responsum that rabbis always find a way to free potential <i>mamzeirim </i>from <i>mamzeirut</i>. If this was their intention, they apparently failed to notice that the Maharsham, after writing that a retroactive <i>get </i>was not feasible in his case, concludes his responsum by writing that he sees no realistic way to permit the <i>mamzeir </i>in question.",

A husband had refused to give a <i>get </i>to his wife and the woman subsequently remarried in a civil ceremony and had a child with her second husband. A rabbi proposed to Rav Moshe that perhaps the child is not a <i>mamzer </i>because the couple engaged in intense fights and the husband was incarcerated immediately following the first marriage. The rabbi proposed that the first marriage should be considered invalid because had she known that the husband would engage in such serious misbehavior she never would have married him. Rav Feinstein entirely rejects this proposal and ruled that the child is certainly a <i>mamzer. </i>Rav Feinstein writes that the proposal is \"certainly incorrect because any problem that arises subsequent to the marriage cannot serve as a reason to view the marriage as having been entered on a fraudulent basis.\" This husband cruelly withheld a <i>get </i>from his wife and yet Rav Moshe did not consider this as a basis to invalidate the marriage even to spare the child from the stigma of <i>mamzeirut</i>.",

Rav Bleich concludes his discussion (p. 128) by noting that he ordinarily does not discuss material that does not merit serious consideration, but he feels a need to address the <i>Jewish Week </i>advertisement due to the publicity it received. Regarding this book, too, the reader should not erroneously think that refuting the proposals of Rabbi's Rackman and Morgenstern indicates a minimal amount of respect for their proposals.

Indeed, every major Orthodox rabbinical organization has rejected the actions of Rabbis Rackman and Morgenstern, including the Beth Din of America (Orthodox Union and Rabbinical Council of America), the Israeli Chief Rabbinate, Agudath Israel, and the Eidah Chareidit Badatz. Rav Ovadia Yosef even repealed the ordination of a man whom he once ordained after the man participated in several of Rabbi Morgenstern's annulments (<i>The Jerusalem Report</i>, August 3, 1998).",

                "Rav Ovadia Yosef has issued an unusually strong public statement denouncing Rabbi Morgenstern’s actions, denying ever having supported him.  Furthermore, Rav Yosef requests that the American rabbinate inform the public of the damage that can be done by this type of irresponsible behavior, and to urge women in the strongest terms possible to refrain from going to this so-called Beth Din.",

            "The Halachic Status of Civil Marriages": [
                "One of the most serious problems confronting American Jewry as a community is the possible validity of non-Orthodox marriages.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For summaries of the halachic status of civil marriages see <i>Techumin </i>(2:255-263), <i>Otzar Haposkim </i>(vol. 10, 26:6:3-5) and Rav Gedaliah Felder's <i>Nachalat Tzvi </i>(2:296-328).</i> As a practicing <i>dayan </i>on the Beth Din of Elizabeth, this author has encountered numerous situations in which this issue came to the fore. It is protocol among all <i>batei din </i>to require a <i>get </i>even if the couple was married only civilly. However, when certain situations arise, a <i>get </i>is either difficult to obtain or insufficient. One example is when a man refuses to grant a <i>get </i>to his wife even after the couple has received a civil divorce. If it can be determined that the couple's marriage lacked halachic validity, the woman is permitted to remarry without a <i>get</i>. Another regrettably common situation is <i>mamzeirut</i>, where a woman conceived a child before she received a <i>get </i>from her former husband. A child conceived during a halachically adulterous relationship is a <i>mamzeir </i>and may not marry a natural-born Jew (see <i>Shulchan Aruch, Even Ha'ezer </i>4).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even if the woman were to receive a <i>get </i>from her first husband, it would not help the children who were already conceived through an extramarital relationship (see <i>Minchat Shlomo </i>1:76).</i> In these situations, we cannot simply \"play it safe\" and assume the validity of the civil marriage at the <i>agunah</i>'s or <i>mamzeir</i>'s expense, so the marriage's halachic status must be determined.",
                "<i><b>Talmudic Background</b></i>",
                "The Mishnah (Kiddushin 2a) teaches that a Jewish marriage, <i>kiddushin</i>, can be created through \"money, written contract, or sexual relations.\" Civil marriage ceremonies lack religious significance, so their halachic validity could come only from the couple’s subsequent cohabitation.",
                "The Mishnah (Gittin 81a) speaks of a divorced couple who sleeps alone in an inn. <i>Beit Hillel </i>believes that the couple is remarried by virtue of the cohabitation. The Gemara explains that <i>Beit Hillel'</i>s opinion is predicated on two key principles. First, although no one saw a sexual act, we view the witnesses who saw the couple enter the room as if they saw such an act (<i>hein hein eidei yichud hein hein eidei bi'ah</i>). Upon establishing that the couple engaged in sexual relations, <i>Beit Hillel </i>applies the rule of <i>ein adam oseh be'ilato be'ilat zenut </i>(one does not normally engage in sexual activity outside of marriage). The man thus wants his encounter in the inn to constitute an act of <i>kiddushin</i>, lest it be deemed illicit. The halachic issue concerning civil marriage depends on whether the principles of <i>ein adam odeh be'ilato be'ilat zenut </i>and <i>hein hein eidei yichud hein hein eidei bi'ah </i>apply to a civilly married couple.",
                "<i><b>Rishonim and Shulchan Aruch - Catholic Weddings</b></i>",
                "The question of civil marriage did not emerge until the nineteenth century, as the institution did not exist until then. However, <i>Rishonim </i>dealt with a similar problem, the halachic status of Jews who married in a Catholic ceremony and lived together. The Rivash (<i>Teshuvot </i>6) wrote a landmark responsum on this issue, presenting two major arguments why Jews married in a Catholic ceremony are <b>not </b>married according to Halachah. He notes that a couple who chooses to marry in a Catholic ceremony demonstrates that it does not wish to be married according to Torah law. Furthermore, the Rivash asserts that the Talmudic rule of <i>ein adam oseh be'ilato be'ilat zenut </i>does not apply to those who do not observe the laws of family purity. If a man and woman engage in sexual relations when she is a <i>nidah </i>(a sin punishable by <i>kareit</i>, spiritual excision), they undoubtedly do not object to sexual contact outside the context of marriage (a weaker prohibition).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Yitzchak Herzog (<i>Teshuvot Heichal Yizchak </i>E.H. 2:31:3) notes that this assumption is not always true. While halachically sensitive Jews recognize that having relations with a <i>nidah </i>is more severe than engaging in sexual relations outside of marriage, this may not always be true of secular Jews. As Rav Herzog writes, a secular Jew may be unable to imagine the severity and importance of family purity, yet he will realize that living together out of wedlock is a \"corruption of serious human morality.\" Nevertheless, Rav Herzog himself rules that civil marriages are not halachically binding, for reasons that we shall see later in this chapter. Regrettably, it is doubtful that Rav Herzog's assessment of the secular Jews of his time applies to non- Orthodox Jews today, when much of Western society no longer views premarital sex as corrupt and amoral (see <i>Aseih Lecha Rav </i>8:72).</i> The <i>Terumat Hadeshen </i>(209), Radbaz (1:351), and <i>Mishneh Lamelech </i>(<i>Hilchot Geirushin </i>10:18) agree with the Rivash. Indeed, the Rambam (<i>Hilchot Ishut </i>7:23) writes that the rule of <i>ein adam oseh be'ilato be'ilat zenut </i>only applies to those who are \"kosher\" (proper) among the people of Israel.",
                "Both the Shulchan Aruch (Even Ha'ezer 149:6) and the Rama (E.H. 26:1) accept the Rivash's lenient ruling. The Shulchan Aruch writes, \"[Regarding] a man and woman who were forcibly converted and later married in a Catholic ceremony, even though everyone [Jewish] sees them entering their home alone… no <i>kiddushin </i>exist between this man and woman.\"",
                "<i><b>Contemporary Rulings</b></i>",
                "These rulings serve as precedents for the overwhelming majority of authorities, who rule that civil marriages are not halachically binding. Rav Moshe Feinstein (<i>Teshuvot Igrot Moshe</i>, Even Ha'ezer 75) articulates this view:",
                "If the people who had only civil marriage are halachically observant, the couple requires a <i>get </i>because of the rule <i>ein adam oseh be'ilato be'ilat zenut. </i>If it is possible, one should obtain a <i>get </i>even for those couples who are not halachically observant, as is the generally accepted rabbinical practice. However, if it is impossible to obtain a <i>get </i>and the woman would otherwise remain an <i>agunah</i>, one may rely on the lenient ruling of the Rivash.",
                "The main proponent of the dissenting view is Rav Yosef Eliyahu Henkin (<i>Perushei Ibra</i>, Chapters 3-5). He argues that if the couple intends to be married, then every sexual act should be viewed as an act of <i>kiddushin</i>. Rav Henkin vigorously argues that a couple need not intend to marry according to Jewish law for <i>kiddushin </i>to take effect. The Halachah considers <i>kiddushin </i>to be created when a couple engages in marital relations and intends to have a permanent monogamous relationship.",
                "The overwhelming majority of halachic authorities reject Rav Henkin's position. Rav Meshulam Roth (<i>Teshuvot Kol Mevaser </i>22) writes, \"Virtually all of the great halachic authorities of the previous generation agree that a couple which was married only in a civil ceremony essentially does not require a <i>get</i>.\"",
                "Rav Avraham Shapiro (<i>Teshuvot Devar Avraham </i>3:29) vigorously disputes Rav Henkin's arguments. He notes that the rulings of the Rivash, <i>Terumat Hadeshen</i>, Radbaz, Shulchan Aruch, and Rama seem to contradict Rav Henkin's assertions. Furthermore, a couple is not halachically married if the man and woman do not intend to marry according to <b>Torah law</b>.",
                "This argument revolves around the question of what creates <i>kiddushin</i>. Is it intent for a permanent monogamous relationship or for marriage according to Jewish law? Indeed, many of those espousing the lenient view refer to the <i>Shaagat Aryeh</i>'s opinion (cited in <i>Teshuvot Beit Ephraim</i>, E.H. 42) that the rule of <i>hein hein eidei yichud hein hein eidei bi'ah </i>does not apply to unlearned people<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It appears from the responsum that the <b>witnesses </b>must know that marital relations can contract a marriage, although it is not entirely clear if he requires them or the couple to know this.</i> who are unaware that <i>kiddushin </i>can be created through marital relations. We apparently do not consider the couple's general interest in a marriage relationship halachically significant as long as there is no interest in marrying according to Halachah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See, however, <i>Teshuvot Or Samei'ach </i>(<i>Likutei Teshuvot </i>10).</i> This assertion is echoed by Rav Yitzchak Herzog (<i>Teshuvot Heichal Yitzchak </i>E.H. 2:31:3-4), who further notes that the sexual relations of a couple who mistakenly believes it had a halachic ceremony do not effect a marriage (Ketubot 73b). Why, he argues, should a secular couple who mistakenly believes that it does not need a religious ceremony be treated any differently?",
                "<i><b>Exceptions</b></i>",
                "There are a couple of possible exceptions to the consensus regarding civil marriage. One is the case discussed by Israel's late Sephardic Chief Rabbi, Rav Ben-Zion Uzziel (<i>Teshuvot Mishpetei Uzziel</i>, E.H. 29). Rav Uzziel writes that if a couple lived in a country where Jewish wedding rituals were forbidden, we should be concerned that the rule of <i>ein adam oseh be'ilato be'ilat zenut </i>applies. After all, it could well be that the couple desired a halachic marriage, so, in the absence of any other ceremony, it had sexual relations for the purpose of marriage.",
                "Another possible exception is a non-observant couple who married civilly and later became more observant. Although the couple initially did not marry according to Halachah, one could argue that once the couple increasingly observes <i>mitzvot</i>, it wants to be halachically married. Its continued sexual relations effect this marriage based on the principle of <i>ein adam oseh be'ilato be'ilat zenut</i>. If a previously non-Orthodox couple finds itself in such a situation and wishes to ensure that it is married halachically, a competent rabbi must be consulted.",
                "<i><b>Conclusion</b></i>",
                "The overwhelming majority of halachic authorities believe that civil marriages are not halachically binding. They include Rav Chaim Ozer Grodzinski (<i>Teshuvot Achiezer </i>4:50), Rav David Tzvi Hoffman (<i>Teshuvot Melameid Leho’il </i>3:20), Rav Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg (<i>Teshuvot Seridei Eish </i>3:22), Rav Yitzchak Isaac Herzog (<i>Teshuvot Heichal Yitzchak</i>, E.H. 2:30-31), Rav Yaakov Breisch (<i>Teshuvot Chelkat Yaakov </i>1:1), Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (<i>Teshuvot Minchat Shlomo </i>3:100) and Dayan Y.Y. Weisz (<i>Teshuvot Minchat Yitzchak </i>3:125). Furthermore, today there may be yet another reason to rule that civil marriages are not halachically valid. Rav Henkin based his stringent view on <i>ein adam oseh be'ilato be'ilat zenut</i>. Rav Chaim David Halevi argues that, unfortunately, this principle no longer holds true in many Western countries (<i>Aseih Lecha Rav </i>8:72). In practice, Rav Shiloh Raphael writes (<i>Techumin </i>7:284), \"In case of <i>igun</i>, all <i>batei din </i>in Israel permit the woman [married only in a civil ceremony] to remarry without a <i>get</i>. Nevertheless, the accepted practice is to try to arrange a <i>get</i>, if at all possible, even if only a civil ceremony took place.\" Obviously, since this is a complex area of Halachah, a rabbi of eminent stature must be sought when confronting the situations that we have discussed."

                    "Rav Moshe Feinstein (<i>Teshuvot Igrot Moshe</i>, Even Ha'ezer 1:76) suggests that even those authorities who deem civil marriage halachically binding (see previous chapter) would agree that a couple married by a Reform rabbi is not halachically married. He bases his argument on the Gemara's discussion of a groom who gave his bride an object worth less than a <i>perutah</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The money or object given for the purpose of marriage must be worth at least a <i>perutah </i>(an ancient coin); see Kiddushin 2a.</i> after which he consummated the marriage (Ketubot 73b). One opinion believes that the couple is married, for we assume that people realize <i>kiddushin </i>require an object worth a <i>perutah</i>. Since the couple understands that its formal marriage ceremony is not valid, it opts to create <i>kiddushin </i>through sexual relations.",
                    "The other opinion asserts that people generally do not know that the ring must be worth at least a <i>perutah</i>, so the couple does not realize that its wedding ceremony did not conform to Halachah. Hence, the man and woman do not intend to create <i>kiddushin </i>with their sexual relations, because they believe that their sexual relations are already sanctioned by their wedding ceremony and do not require anything more.",
                    "The Shulchan Aruch (Even Ha'ezer 31:9) rules that the couple is halachically married when the ring used in the wedding ceremony was worth less than a <i>perutah</i>. The Rama adds that the couple is married only if it realizes that the wedding ceremony lacked halachic validity and that <i>kiddushin </i>must thus be created by sexual relations. However, if it believes that the marriage ceremony was valid, the couple is <b>not </b>married even after engaging in sexual relations.",
                    "Rav Moshe and the Maharsham (<i>Teshuvot </i>2:101) write that those who ask a Reform rabbi to marry them erroneously believe that the Reform ceremony constitutes <i>kiddushin</i>, so they do not intend to create <i>kiddushin </i>later through sexual relations. Accordingly, the only way for a Reform wedding to take effect would be if the Reform ceremony itself were halachically valid. We will now outline the issues surrounding a Reform wedding ceremony.",
                    "<i><b>Male Orthodox Jews in the Audience</b></i>",
                    "Jewish law requires the presence of two male qualified witnesses in order for a wedding ceremony to have halachic validity. The presence of witnesses for <i>kiddushin </i>and <i>gittin </i>is required to render the action halachically significant, and not merely to provide evidence after the fact. Consequently, even a videocassette of the wedding cannot substitute for the presence of qualified witnesses at the ceremony.",
                    "The Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat, 33-35) delineates who the Halachah considers a qualified witness. Anyone who is known to have violated a monetary crime, regardless of its punishment, or a negative Torah prohibition punishable by <i>malkot </i>(lashes) or death, such as desecrating Shabbat, is disqualified on a Torah level. Thus, one who is known to cheat in business, drive on Shabbat, or eat non-kosher food cannot serve as a witness for <i>kiddushin</i>. In addition, any first or second-degree relative of the bride, groom, or other witness is invalid.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rama (C.M. 33:2) claims that the Rambam considers maternal relatives invalid witnesses only on a rabbinical level. Accordingly, observant maternal relatives who saw the wedding ceremony take place could make the wedding valid on a biblical level. On the other hand, the Shach (C.M. 33:7) offers a different interpretation of the Rambam's words and argues that even the Rambam invalidates maternal relatives on a biblical level.</i>",
                    "Accordingly, Rav Moshe writes:",
                    "It appears correct to me that a marriage ceremony conducted by a Reform rabbi has no halachic validity if a thorough investigation demonstrates that two qualified witnesses did not see the groom hand the bride the ring and recite <i>\"harei at mekudashet li\" </i>(the wedding formula, \"Behold you are married to me...\").",
                    "<i><b>The Chatam Sofer's Ruling</b></i>",
                    "The <i>Chatam Sofer </i>(<i>Teshuvot </i>100, cited by Pitchei Teshuvah, E.H. 42:11) poses a potentially serious challenge to Rav Moshe's ruling. In the <i>Chatam Sofer'</i>s case, a rabbi performed a wedding, and two men were designated as witnesses of the <i>kiddushin</i>. A few weeks later, the rabbi discovered that one of the witnesses was a relative of the bride.",
                    "The <i>Chatam Sofer </i>rules that the marriage was valid despite the fact that one of the designated witnesses was disqualified. He explains that anyone present at the wedding could potentially serve as a witness (assuming he was not invalid for any other reason), and even people who did not see the delivery of the ring to the bride still knew that the transfer occurred. This knowledge fits the halachic category of <i>anan sahadei</i>, knowledge that is equivalent to seeing the transfer itself (see Shevuot 33b-34a). This concept resembles last chapter's rule of <i>hein hein eidei yichud hein hein eidei bi'ah</i>.",
                    "The <i>Chatam Sofer'</i>s ruling could limit Rav Moshe's leniency to cases when no valid witnesses attended the wedding ceremony. However, Rav Moshe asserts that the <i>Chatam Sofer</i>'s ruling does not apply to a wedding conducted by a Reform rabbi, as it requires the officiating rabbi to be both well versed in Halachah and punctilious about all halachic details related to marriage. Only in such a situation can those at the wedding presume that a halachically valid ceremony took place. However, if the men in the audience are not certain that the <i>kiddushin </i>were conducted strictly in accordance with Halachah, they cannot serve as witnesses without watching the ring's delivery with their own eyes.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Dayan Y.Y. Weisz (<i>Minchat Yitzchak </i>2:66) does not appear to agree with Rav Moshe's claim. Dayan Weisz believes that even in a situation, such as a Reform wedding, where the audience has its doubts as to the validity of the marriage, everyone in the audience knows that a potentially valid ceremony took place. Accordingly, if there are Orthodox non-relatives in the audience during the wedding ceremony, there is a <i>safeik </i>(doubt) as to the marriage's validity. Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (<i>Minchat Shlomo </i>3:100) rejects this approach. If there are no valid witnesses in the audience, even Dayan Weisz accepts Rav Moshe's lenient ruling (at least regarding <i>mamzeirut</i>).</i>",

He vehemently attacks Rav Moshe's ruling and depicts its implementation as \"a sin.\" Although some great rabbis dispute Rav Moshe's lenient ruling, many agree with it. As we have noted, the Maharsham articulates a similar view to that of Rav Moshe. In addition, Rav Eliezer Waldenberg (<i>Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer </i>8:37) accepts Rav Moshe's analysis and ruling. He seeks to demonstrate that many great authorities disagree with the aforementioned ruling of the <i>Chatam Sofer</i>. Moreover, he agrees with Rav Moshe that the <i>Chatam Sofer</i>'s ruling does not apply to a wedding ceremony conducted by a Reform rabbi. It should be emphasized, though, that even Rav Moshe urged that all efforts be made to administer a <i>get </i>on behalf of a divorced couple even if it was married in a Reform ceremony."

Rav Chaim Soloveitchik (commentary to Rambam's <i>Hilchot Chalitzah </i>4:16) explains that a couple does not become married merely by the ritual performance of <i>kiddushin</i>. Rather, <i>da'at</i>, intention, is necessary to create the marriage. Accordingly, the couple must have <i>da'at </i>that giving the ring creates the <i>kiddushin</i>; without intention, the <i>kiddushin </i>cannot take effect. Since the statement of vows and the double ring ceremony confuse the couple's <i>da'at</i>, the marriage is not effective.",
                    "Moreover, in videos of Reform weddings that this author has seen, the rabbi typically declares at the conclusion of the <i>chuppah</i>, \"I now pronounce you man and wife in the eyes of man and in the eyes of God.\" Women who participated in these ceremonies have told this author that they thought they were married according to Jewish tradition when the rabbis made this declaration.",

Nevertheless, there is still room to invalidate Reform weddings. This is because the basis for the Rama's ruling (as explained by Rav Yechezkel Landau, <i>Teshuvot Noda Biyhudah </i>1:59, cited by Pitchei Teshuvah, E.H. 42:3) is that unarticulated thoughts have no halachic significance (<i>devarim sheb'leiv einam devarim</i>). However, in the case of the Reform double ring ceremony, the circumstances clearly indicate a lack of <i>da'at</i>. The groom and bride demonstrate with their actions that they do not want the groom's delivery of the ring to effect <i>kiddushin</i>. In fact, <i>Tosafot </i>(Kiddushin 49b s.v. Devarim) write that when the individual's intentions are obvious, they do indeed have halachic standing. The <i>Chazon Ish </i>(E.H. 52:3) also writes that even the Rama would invalidate a marriage if it is blatantly obvious that the couple did not intend to marry halachically (see <i>Techumin </i>18:92-99).",

                    "This author replied to Rav Goldberg that the Radbaz (<i>Teshuvot </i>1:73, 2:796, and 4:219) rules that the Karaites are not <i>mamzeirim</i>, because their <i>kiddushin </i>are invalid. The Radbaz clearly writes that Karaites are unfit to serve as witnesses. Even if we were to reject the Radbaz and accept the Rama's ruling, we may distinguish between it and Rav Moshe's ruling. The Rama addresses an entire community, whereas Rav Moshe addresses individual cases. In the latter situation, one is usually able to investigate thoroughly if two valid witnesses saw the delivery of the ring from the groom to the bride. In the former case, the Rama addresses the status of all Karaites, who had existed for hundreds of years by his time. Regarding the Karaites, it is possible that valid witnesses saw the delivery of the ring at some of their weddings, thereby rendering those ceremonies halachically valid (as occurs at a number of non-Orthodox weddings).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The historical background surrounding the Rama's source is unclear. The ban on marrying Karaites first appears in a responsum of questionable authorship (cited by the Mabit, <i>Teshuvot </i>1:38). This responsum states that the Karaites' marriages are halachically binding \"either through <i>kesef </i>[giving a ring, or other valued object] or <i>bi'ah </i>[marital relations].\" The Radbaz argues that the responsum makes several problematic assumptions, and he therefore permits marrying Karaites. In his attempt to understand the responsum, the Radbaz argues that the only possible way for Karaites to have valid marriages is if Rabbanites (the medieval forerunners of Orthodox Jews) attended their wedding. For a treatment of the history and halachic status of Karaite wedding ceremonies, see Michael Corinaldi's <i>Hama'amad Ha'ishi Shel Hakara'im </i>(pp. 34-142).</i> Over the years, if women in such marriages remarried without <i>gittin</i>, their children from the new marriages were <i>mamzeirim</i>. Over the centuries, this likely occurred repeatedly, creating a situation of collective <i>safeik mamzeirut </i>for the Karaite community. However, the Rama might agree with Rav Moshe's approach regarding a specific wedding, if a thorough investigation reveals that no valid witnesses saw the groom give the bride a ring.",

However, he does rule (194:1-2) that a <i>yoledet </i>(a woman who <b>has given </b>birth) has the status of a <i>nidah </i>even if she did not see any blood (a highly unlikely occurrence), based on the Gemara’s principle (according to the accepted view) that the uterus cannot open without the release of some blood (see Nidah 21a-b).",
                "In his discussion of violating Shabbat to save lives, the Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chaim 330:3, based on Shabbat 129a) permits violating Shabbat to assist a woman with childbirth. He rules that a woman is considered a <i>yoledet </i>(and has the status of a dangerously ill patient) \"from the time when she sits on the birthing stool, or from the time that blood comes forth, or from the time that her friends have to support her arms and hold her up since she cannot walk.\"",

A student once suggested to Rav Aharon Lichtenstein (in a lecture to Yeshiva University rabbinical students) that the husband may nevertheless touch his wife during the delivery. The student reasoned that this is not an affectionate type of contact (<i>negiah shelo bederech chibah</i>), and some authorities permit non-affectionate contact. Rav Lichtenstein replied that such contact <b>is </b>affectionate (<i>bederech chibah</i>) and is forbidden once the wife becomes a <i>nidah</i>. Although contact between husband and wife in the delivery room is not sexual in nature, it is nonetheless of a loving nature and is hence prohibited. There is also another flaw in the student's argument.

Of course, he warns that every case must be judged independently to ensure that there are absolutely no affectionate overtones. Rav Ellinson notes that the Beit Shmuel (20:1) prohibits even non-affectionate contact, although Rav Ellinson challenges the <i>Beit Shmuel'</i>s proof. Rav Ellinson emphasizes, however, that all of the lenient authorities nonetheless prohibit <b>all </b>contact between a <i>nidah </i>and her husband.</i>",
                "Another suggestion to permit a husband to touch his wife during childbirth is that she is considered a <i>cholah </i>(sick person). The Rama (Yoreh De'ah 195:16) allows a man to help his sick wife in a case of great need, if no one else can help her. Nevertheless, virtually all authorities reject applying the Rama's ruling to childbirth and prohibit the husband from touching his wife.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These authorities include Rav Moshe Feinstein (<i>Teshuvot Igrot Moshe</i>, Yoreh De'ah 2:65), Dayan Y.Y.

Doctors and nurses are readily available to assist the wife during the delivery, so physical contact between the couple is not necessary in the vast majority of cases. In the rare case that the husband must touch his wife during delivery, such as if she suddenly gives birth in the car, physical contact is certainly permissible according to the Rama.",

                "Most contemporary authorities permit a husband to be present in the delivery room, although they do so with varying degrees of enthusiasm (see <i>Nishmat Avraham</i>, Yoreh De'ah 195:3). Rav Moshe Feinstein (<i>Teshuvot Igrot Moshe</i>, Yoreh De'ah 2:75) states no objection the husband's presence in the delivery room per se. Nonetheless, Rav Feinstein rules that the husband must avoid physical contact with his wife and may not watch the baby emerge from the birth canal. Watching the delivery is prohibited because even a husband may not look at that part of his wife's body.",
                "While most authorities agree that the husband may attend delivery when needed, many of them express some reservations. Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (cited by <i>Nishmat Avraham</i>, Y.D. 195:3) and Rav Chaim David Halevi (<i>Aseih Lecha Rav </i>4:58) discourage the husband's attendance, although they add that it is permitted when the wife is truly scared. Rav Yehuda Henkin (<i>Bnei Banim </i>1:33) objects to granting blanket permission for every husband to attend delivery, enumerating the prohibitions that he may come to violate. Rav Henkin adds, however, that a husband must accompany his wife into the delivery room if she specifically requests his presence out of fear. Rav Henkin also suggests that the husband should not accompany his wife if there are other women in the same delivery room without their husbands. Rav Henkin explains that this husband's presence, while helping his wife, hurts the emotional state of the other women.",
                "The <i>Minchat Yitzchak </i>(5:27) strongly objects to the husband's presence in the delivery room. He argues that a wife can manage without him, so her insistence on his presence is mere lightheartedness (<i>kalut hada'at</i>). Dr. Avraham Steinberg (<i>The Journal of Halacha and Contemporary Society</i>, 1:2:121, Fall 1981) challenges this assertion as being \"in dispute with the scientifically proven evidence.\" Elsewhere (p. 108), Dr. Steinberg notes that scientific articles (such as <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i>, 303:597-600) describe how companionship during delivery has many health benefits (although it does not necessarily have to be the husband's companionship).",
                "The situation of a woman giving birth fundamentally differs from that of many ill people. As Rav Yehuda Henkin (<i>Teshuvot Bnei Banim </i>1:33) notes, sick individuals often not need to be active in order to overcome their illness, whereas a woman in labor must remain calm while working intensely to deliver the baby. Therefore, meeting the mother's psychological needs is of great importance. If the couple has studied Lamaze breathing or the Bradley method together, the husband coaches his wife, so his presence is crucial. Furthermore, the husband can serve as an advocate for his wife's needs, if the medical staff does not pay proper attention to her. Anecdotal evidence indicates that this role can often be quite important.",
                "In light of these considerations, many contemporary authorities permit a husband to attend childbirth, at least when his wife requests his presence. The sensitivity to the psychological needs of a woman giving birth is deeply rooted in <i>Chazal</i>. The Gemara (Shabbat 128b) presents the following rule:",
                "We assist a woman to give birth on Shabbat, and for her sake we desecrate Shabbat... as our Rabbis taught: If she requires a light, her friend must kindle a light for her.... Regarding a blind woman in labor, we might think that since she cannot see, it would be forbidden to light a candle at her request [on Shabbat]. This passage comes to inform us <b>that we set her mind at ease </b>[and light the candle for her].",
                "Based on this passage, both Rav Moshe (<i>Teshuvot Igrot Moshe</i>, Orach Chaim 1:131) and the <i>Chazon Ish </i>(<i>Igrot Hachazon Ish </i>1:141) permit husbands to accompany their wives by car on Shabbat to the hospital. The paramedics and doctors take care of her medical needs, while the husband helps keep her mind at ease, contributing towards a safer delivery. The Talmud Yerushalmi (Shabbat 14:3, cited in <i>Nishmat Avraham</i>, Yoreh De'ah 195:3) also indicates that there is a connection between one's emotional state and one's physical health. In fact, nearly all contemporary authorities recognize that mental illness can be just as life-threatening as physical illness (see <i>Contemporary Halakhic Problems </i>2:299).",
                "<i><b>Conclusion</b></i>",
                "Many authorities discourage the husband's presence in the delivery room. Nevertheless, if the need is great enough, nearly all authorities permit the husband to attend childbirth. In such a situation, he should avoid physical contact with his wife after she becomes a <i>nidah </i>and may not watch the actual birth. May God bless His nation with many healthy children."

Rav Moshe posits that the Rambam derives from this passage that the position of king is the paradigm for every leadership position. Whoever may not be appointed king may not hold any leadership role.

Rav Moshe explains that even if a position is not prestigious, it can still be viewed as authoritative. The difference between a person with authority and a regular worker is that a regular worker is hired to do the bidding of his employer, whereas someone in a position of authority is hired to, at times, act against the will of his employer. The inspector of weights and measures is in a position of authority because he does not permit his employer to act dishonestly, regardless of the employer's wishes. The inspector, unlike other workers, is hired to enforce an outside set of rules on his employer.",

Although these jobs include certain administrative powers, such as the ability to reject and expel students, Rav Moshe nonetheless permits a convert to hold them.

He is hired by a food company to enforce the laws of <i>kashrut </i>even when the company would like to disregard them. Rav Moshe adds, though, that there is a very easy way to permit a woman to supervise <i>kashrut</i>. The food company can hire a rabbi to supervise it, and the rabbi, in turn, may hire the woman to oversee the <i>kashrut</i>.

The Torah is teaching that <b>all </b>leadership appointments must be <i>mikerev achecha</i>. Regarding women, however, the prohibition is derived from the word \"<i>melech</i>\" (\"king\" - and not queen) and bears no connection to the word \"<i>tasim</i>\" (\"You shall appoint\").

The Gemara records that one may not set up a fishing net too close to another person's fishing net and thus catch all the fish that would have gone into the original net. Because the fish would have otherwise gravitated automatically to the original net, they are viewed as if they have already reached its owner's possession.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Rashi, s.v. <i>Shani Dagim</i>, and <i>Nimukei Yosef</i>, Bava Batra 11a in pages of Rif s.v. <i>Bar Mevo'ah</i>; see <i>Teshuvot Chatam Sofer</i>, Choshen Mishpat 79, for a summary of alternative explanations of this passage.</i> However, <i>Amoraim </i>dispute a less flagrant form of competition, in which one person is operating a mill in a <i>mavuy </i>(alley),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An Israeli rabbinical court ruled that a \"neighborhood\" is the contemporary halachic equivalent of a Talmudic <i>mavuy </i>(<i>Piskei Din Rabbaniyim </i>6:3).</i> and another wishes to open a similar establishment there.

                "Rav Huna asserts that the owner of the first mill may prevent the newcomer from setting up shop, as the newcomer will interfere with the first inhabitant's livelihood. Rav Huna the son of Rav Yehoshua, on the other hand, argues that this is permitted. Rashi (s.v. <i>Shani Dagim</i>) explains that the competitor may claim, \"Whoever will come to me will come to me, and whoever will come to you will come to you.\" The Gemara indicates that the latter position fits with the majority opinion in a similar debate from the time of the <i>Tannaim </i>(see <i>Tosafot</i>, Bava Batra 21b s.v. <i>Peshita</i>).

The Rif, Rambam, and Shulchan Aruch do not even mention the Gemara's restriction regarding the fishing nets, so perhaps they understood that the Gemara eventually rejected that law. In fact, the Meiri (Bava Batra 21b) explicitly rejects the restriction on setting new fishing nets near old ones. It would thus seem that the Halachah sanctions nearly unrestricted free enterprise.",
                "Nonetheless, Rav Huna the son of Rav Yehoshua adds that such competition is only permitted when the new competitor comes from the same <i>mavuy</i>, for he is just as entitled as the first businessman to earn a livelihood in that area. The new competitor can claim, \"You do work on your home turf, and [so too] I do work on my home turf.\" However, one who comes from a different city and challenges the established local business is unfairly encroaching. Rav Huna the son of Rav Yehoshua inquires whether one who comes from a different <i>mavuy </i>but resides in the same city is considered sufficiently local to be granted the right to compete.

Even if one assumes that Rav Huna the son of Rav Yehoshua does prohibit placing the fishing net in such a manner, it is still not clear what level of competition he means to prohibit. The case of the fishing nets might be a uniquely extreme case, as the fish were sure to go into the original net. Alternatively, that case might come to prohibit any new store that will undoubtedly cripple the original store's income, even if the new entrepreneur does not directly block the incumbent's merchandise. Consequently, there has been a dispute since the time of the <i>Rishonim </i>regarding where to draw the line between legitimate economic competition and unfair damage to someone else's livelihood.",
                "The <i>Aviasaf </i>(cited by the Mordechai, Bava Batra 516, and <i>Hag'hot Maimoniot</i>, <i>Hil. Shecheinim </i>6:8) defines unfair competition in a most broad manner. He forbids opening a store at the entrance to a <i>mavuy satum </i>(a dead-end alley) if a similar establishment is already located farther within the <i>mavuy satum</i>. Such competition is unfair, for it will definitely ruin the original shopkeeper's business. Potential customers will see the new store upon entering the <i>mavuy satum </i>without ever noticing the other establishment farther in. Rav Yosef Karo (<i>Beit Yosef</i>, Choshen Mishpat 156 s.v. <i>Vekatav Hamordechai</i>) claims that the <i>Aviasaf </i>is following Rav Huna's opinion in the Gemara (prohibiting opening a new mill where one already exists). As mentioned above, most <i>Rishonim </i>rule against Rav Huna (in favor of Rav Huna the son of Rav Yehoshua). Rav Karo thus ignores the <i>Aviasaf'</i>s view in his Shulchan Aruch (C.M. 156:5) and rules that all local competitors are unrestricted in their ability to open rival businesses.",

The reason for this is that the new business will surely cripple the business inside the <i>mavuy</i>. Not surprisingly, therefore, the Rama takes a stricter stance than the Shulchan Aruch, for he understands that the <i>Aviasaf'</i>s ruling fits into the accepted position in the Gemara. In a responsum (10), the Rama adjudicates a famous sixteenth-century dispute between two Italian publishers who both printed editions of the Rambam's <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. The one who published it first objected to the existence of a rival edition of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. The Rama rules against the second publisher, reasoning (based on the <i>Aviasaf'</i>s ruling) that all <i>Amoraim </i>forbid opening a store if it will clearly ruin the original entrepreneur's business.

                "Even if one does not accept the <i>Aviasaf'</i>s ruling, it is still possible to apply some limits to free enterprise. For example, the <i>Mas'at Binyamin </i>(27, quoted by Pitchei Teshuvah, Choshen Mishpat 156:3) addresses a town that was permitted to have only one store of a particular type. One such store already existed, and someone wanted to start an identical one. The <i>Mas'at Binyamin </i>writes that even the lenient Rav Huna the son of Rav Yehoshua forbids the new competitor from opening. Since there was not even a theoretical chance of both stores surviving, the new storeowner was assuredly damaging the incumbent (<i>bari hezeika</i>). The Pitchei Teshuvah points out that nowhere in his responsum does the <i>Mas'at Binyamin </i>cite the <i>Aviasaf'</i>s ruling as a precedent. Perhaps the <i>Mas'at Binyamin </i>would permit opening a store at the entrance to a <i>mavuy satum</i>. Regarding a <i>mavuy satum</i>, at least some chance exists that people will decide to walk into the <i>mavuy </i>and buy from the original merchant, even if this is unlikely. In this town, by contrast, the law made it completely impossible for two stores of the same type to coexist.",
                "The Rashba (<i>Teshuvot </i>3:83) also limits free enterprise. He extrapolates from the Gemara's case of the fishing nets that, while one may open a rival business, he may not actively pursue people who are known to be regular customers of the first proprietor. Just as one who places his net in front of the first net swipes fish that were heading straight toward it, this type of advertising steals customers who would have undoubtedly bought from the original proprietor.",

However, competition that will <b>eliminate </b>the original proprietor's ability to earn a livelihood is forbidden. The <i>Chatam Sofer </i>quotes the <i>Aviasaf </i>as a precedent and asserts that Rashi agrees with the <i>Aviasaf</i>.

It would appear that Rav Nathanson is arguing that we must accept these laws based on considerations of equity. Indeed, the Ramban, commenting on the Torah's exhortation (Devarim 6:18), \"VeAsitah HaYashar VeHatov BeEinei Hashem\" (\"You shall follow what is proper and good in the eyes of God\"), emphasizes the need to conduct oneself in an ethical manner. He explains that the Torah commands us to follow what is considered proper and ethical behavior even in situations that are not directly addressed in the Torah.

                "In Jewish communities today, there is an added reason that Jews must obey the civil government's laws. Unlike previous generations, Jews today do not live in autonomous communities with their own business practices. The \"local business customs\" of many Jewish communities are often its local civil laws. Explaining why Halachah should recognize American rent control laws, Rav Yosef Eliyahu Henkin (Kitvei Haga'on Rav Y. E. Henkin 2:96) writes:",
                "Since we are residents of the United States, whose laws are enacted by elected officials, chosen by citizens, to uphold justice, and we Jews do not maintain organized communities with communal heads (Tovei HaIr), the government's laws are halachically binding because of Dina DeMalchuta Dina. Although these [laws] do not always conform to the Shulchan Aruch, if they relate to issues which depend on custom, [the civil laws] are the nation's custom. When a case comes before Jewish Dayanim (rabbinical judges), they must rule according to the civil laws, except for the laws of inheritance, which do not depend on custom.",
                "Rav Henkin does note that not all authorities apply Dina DeMalchuta Dina to laws that are designed to maintain order, when these laws contradict Halachah (as opposed to taxes, which all authorities consider binding). Nonetheless, he claims that all would agree that when there are no Jewish courts to legislate rules for an effective society, the civil government's laws to maintain order must be followed. This reasoning appears especially true in the area of copyright law, as virtually all countries in the world maintain them, and contemporary business cannot function without them. Chazal teach us that when government discipline is lacking, pandemonium ensues (Avot 3:2). Similarly, if copyright laws were not enacted (and obeyed), economic pandemonium would result.",

Rav Landau (Noda Biy'hudah, Choshen Mishpat 2:24) adjudicates a dispute in which a Torah scholar wrote a commentary on parts of the Mishnah. He paid a publisher to print the Mishnah and his commentary together in one book. After the work was printed, the publisher discarded the characters used in printing the commentary but saved the typeset of the Mishnah's text. The publisher then printed another edition of the Mishnah without the scholar's commentary. The scholar sued the publisher for compensation, arguing that the new edition of the Mishnah would hurt sales of the edition containing his commentary. The scholar claimed that the publisher acted unfairly, as he was paid to print the Mishnah on the scholar's behalf. It would not be proper to use the fruits of this printing against him.",
                "The publisher defended his actions by claiming that the typeset characters belonged to him, so he could use them as he pleased. Rav Landau rejected the publisher's claim, stating that he caused unfair monetary damage to the scholar. Publishing another edition of the Mishnah caused a reduction in demand for the edition with the scholar's commentary. Rav Landau ordered the publisher to compensate the scholar, as using the typeset characters constituted benefiting at the scholar's expense.",
                "Rav Zalman Nechemia Goldberg discusses the possibility of applying this ruling to the situation of copyright law. If someone copies a computer program, for example, the copier benefits from the program and causes a loss to the producer of the program, as the copied version hurts the sales of the computer program. Copying it therefore constitutes benefiting at another's expense (Zeh Neheneh VeZeh Chaseir), so the copier must compensate the producer of the program.",

In discussing why one may not republish a prayer book set that was edited and arranged by a particular publisher, the Chatam Sofer cites a passage from the Gemara (Bava Batra 21a-b) as a source for the prohibition. The Gemara records, \"Fishing nets must be kept away from fish [which have been targeted by another fisherman] the full length of their ability to swim.\"",

Competitors may not capitalize on the investment made by the first fisherman.",
                "The Chatam Sofer formulates a general principle based on this case from the Gemara. He asserts that one who invested effort in attaining a certain goal (even if it is intangible) possesses an exclusive right to the resulting profits of that investment. Hence, the creator of intellectual property, such as a computer program or a music tape, may retain the exclusive rights to the profits resulting from his creation.

For example, the Gemara (Bava Metzia 34a) discusses a case in which one sells his sheep but retains the rights to the sheep's future production of wool and offspring. The original owner still owns the sheep as far as their wool and offspring are concerned.",
                "Rav Goldberg argues that a store that sells a copyrighted computer program or music cassette sells the purchaser only the right to derive personal enjoyment from it. He does not sell, however, the right to copy the merchandise. The buyer cannot claim that, as the new owner, he may copy the product at will, because he does not own the right to copy the product. Copying the merchandise in such a case constitutes outright theft. Indeed, if someone went ahead and copied something illegally under these circumstances, Rav Goldberg forbids buying the item from him (see Techumin [7:360-380] for criticism of Rav Goldberg and Rav Goldberg's response).",

Indeed, Rav Moshe Feinstein (Teshuvot Igrot Moshe, Orach Chaim 4:40:19) and Rav Eliezer Waldenberg (Tzitz Eliezer 18:80) both rule that one must follow these laws. Failure to abide by these laws can unfortunately lead to Chilul Hashem (desecration of God's name), as well. Therefore, before copying cassettes, compact discs, or computer programs, one must ascertain that it is permissible to do so. Nevertheless, many authorities, most notably Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (cited in Nishmat Avraham 4:204-206), permit copying small portions of a tape or book if one would not have otherwise bought the item. Rav Shlomo Zalman permits copying small portions of a book even if the author explicitly writes that he explicitly forbids copying any amount. See, however, Pitchei Choshen (4:9, note 27), who prohibits disobeying the author's explicit demand.",

                "This author once asked Rav Yosef Dov Soloveitchik if it is permissible to go to a casino for a single visit. The Rav replied succinctly: \"It's a bad habit, don't do it!\" Rav Mordechai Willig encouraged this author to publicize the Rav's statement. Similar sentiments are expressed by the Mishnah Berurah (670, Biur Halachah s.v. <i>Venohagim</i>), the <i>Aruch Hashulchan </i>(Orach Chaim 670:9), Rav Moshe Feinstein (<i>Teshuvot Igrot Moshe</i>, Orach Chaim 4:35), Rav Yehudah Amital (in a discussion with this author), Rav Aharon Lichtenstein (in a discussion with this author), Rav Hershel Schachter (in a lecture delivered at Yeshiva University), and Rav Mordechai Willig (in a speech delivered at a National Conference of Synagogue Youth convention). We will explore the basis for this attitude in the Gemara, <i>Rishonim</i>, and Shulchan Aruch.",
                "<i><b>Talmudic Background</b></i>",
                "The main Talmudic discussion of gambling appears in Sanhedrin (24b-25a). The Mishnah there lists different types of men who are disqualified from serving as witnesses, including a dice player (<i>mesacheik bekubiya</i>). The Gemara cites two explanations for disqualifying a dice player. Rami Bar Chama believes that one's winnings in dice playing constitute theft, as the losing party does not willingly give his money to the winner. Rather, it is a situation of <i>asmachta</i>, where someone accepts a disproportionately large financial responsibility under the assumption that he will never have to pay it. Rashi (s.v. <i>Asmachta</i>) explains that Rami Bar Chama considers gambling to be <i>asmachta </i>because each gambler agrees to pay, should he lose, only due to the mistaken belief that he will win. Hence, when he hands the money to the winner, he does so unwillingly.",
                "On the other hand, the Gemara records that Rav Sheishet does not view the losing gambler's payment as an <i>asmachta</i>. According to Rav Sheishet, the Mishnah only disqualifies a gambler who has no other profession, because he fails to engage in any constructive activity (<i>eino oseik beyishuvo shel olam</i>). The Rambam (<i>Hilchot Gezeilah Va'aveidah </i>6:11) explains that a person should involve himself in learning and other activities that contribute positively to society, whereas even permissible forms of gambling (such as gambling with a non-Jew) contain no socially redeeming value.",
                "<i><b>Rishonim</b></i>",
                "The Rambam (<i>Hil. Gezeilah Va'aveidah </i>6:10-11) rules that gambling with a Jew constitutes theft on a rabbinical level. Regarding gambling with a non-Jew, while there is no theft involved, he prohibits it because it is a total waste of time, whereas man should spend his time acquiring wisdom and developing the world.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Regarding the validity as a witness of one whose only occupation is gambling with non-Jews, see Raavad's comment there, <i>Kesef Mishneh </i>on <i>Hil. Eidut </i>10:4, and Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat 370:3.</i> The Rambam's opinion is somewhat difficult, because he appears to contradict himself in <i>Hil. Eidut </i>(10:4), where he implies that even gambling with a Jew involves no technical prohibition. It is also unclear how his opinion fits into the Gemara quoted above.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Magid Mishnah</i>, <i>Hil. Gezeilah Va'aveidah </i>6:10; <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>, <i>Hil. Eidut </i>10:4; <i>Kesef Mishneh </i>on both these sources; and <i>Aruch Hashulchan</i>, C.M. 207:23.</i>",
                "Rashi, Rabbeinu Tam, and the Ri debate why Rav Sheishet maintains that gambling does not constitute <i>asmachta</i>. Rashi (Sanhedrin 24b s.v. <i>Kol Ki Hai Gavna</i>) explains that when one plays dice, he does not have any control over whether he will win or lose, for rolling dice successfully does not depend on skill. Hence, if one agrees to pay in the event that he loses, he does so wholeheartedly, knowing that he might lose. On the other hand, situations of <i>asmachta </i>arise when a person is certain that he will fulfill his promise and thus avoid paying the penalty. For example, the Mishnah (Bava Batra 168a) discusses a person who promises his creditor that, as a penalty, he will pay more money than he owes if he does not repay his loan by a certain date. He agrees to pay the extra money only because he is certain that he will be able to pay the creditor by the due date. Therefore, if the borrower defaults, the penalty is an <i>asmachta</i>, as he did not expect to actually pay the penalty. The gambler, on the other hand, understands that he might lose his money, so he consents to his loss, making the gambling payment a permissible transaction according to Rav Sheishet.",
                "The Ri fundamentally agrees with Rashi's explanation of Rav Sheishet, but he adds a number of points to provide a full account of the parameters of <i>asmachta</i>. He outlines three basic categories of conditional agreements. The first category is when one makes an agreement whose terms are reasonable (<i>lo gazim</i>), and one is fully in control of the situation (<i>beyado</i>). This conditional agreement is valid and does not constitute <i>asmachta</i>. The classic example of this category is a sharecropper who agrees to compensate the owner of a field if he fails to work the field according to their agreement (Bava Metzia 104a). The payment is not a penalty; rather, it constitutes appropriate compensation to the owner of the field for the lost profits. In addition, the sharecropper himself chooses whether he will work the field.",
                "The second category described by the Ri is accepting a debt without seriously believing that one will ever have to pay it, such as when one agrees to pay an exaggerated penalty should he fail to do something. For example, if a sharecropper agrees to pay the owner of the field an exorbitant sum as a penalty for failing to work the field, the agreement is an <i>asmachta</i>, because the sharecropper undoubtedly never expected to pay such a great sum (Bava Metzia 104b). He agreed to the financial penalty only inasmuch as he believed that he would work the field properly and never need to pay it. Accordingly, the penalty constitutes an <i>asmachta </i>and is not legally binding.",
                "The Ri considers playing dice to be a third category. Winning and losing are totally random, so the players recognize that they might lose and consciously agree to pay the required sum. No one is under the false impression that his superior skills give him a better chance of winning. Since each competitor knows in advance that he may reasonably need to pay this sum, playing dice is not an <i>asmachta </i>according to Rav Sheishet.",
                "Rabbeinu Tam offers a different explanation. He suggests that playing dice would be <i>asmachta </i>if it were a unilateral agreement. However, playing dice involves a bilateral agreement, whereby one agrees to pay when he loses games because he wants the ability to collect when he wins. Rabbeinu Tam believes that <i>asmachta </i>invalidates an agreement only if the person commits himself to pay without receiving any potential profit in return, such as in the aforementioned case concerning defaulting on a loan.",
                "<i><b>The Shulchan Aruch and Its Commentaries</b></i>",
                "The Rama (Choshen Mishpat 207:13) cites the theories of both the Ri and Rabbeinu Tam to explain why playing dice is not an <i>asmachta</i>. Elsewhere, the Rama (C.M. 370:3) does not forbid occasional gambling, as the Halachah accepts the opinion of Rav Sheishet. Rav Yosef Karo (same source), however, rules in accordance with the view of the Rambam,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Yosef Karo believes the Rambam's view to match the opinion of Rami bar Chama; see his aforementioned comments in the <i>Kesef Mishneh</i>.</i> that dice playing constitutes theft on a rabbinical level, asserting that the agreement between the two parties involved is an <i>asmachta</i>.",
                "Accordingly, Sephardic Jews may not even gamble occasionally, since for them the rulings of Rav Yosef Karo constitute the halachic norm. Indeed, Rav Ovadia Yosef (<i>Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 7, C.M. 6) rules that a Sephardic Jew may not buy lottery tickets. Even the Rama limits the permissibility of gambling occasionally to those games in which the winner is determined entirely at random.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is because the Rama accepts the three categories of the Ri.</i> In order to engage in such an activity, one must ascertain that the game does not constitute an <i>asmachta </i>in any way. This task is far from simple, since crucial distinctions between valid and invalid agreements are very subtle. Rav Aharon Lichtenstein (cited in <i>Daf Kesher </i>1:83-85) notes that sports betting pools, for example, appear to be prohibited even for Ashkenazic Jews. In that form of gambling, each participant believes that his superior understanding of sports will help him bet on the right teams, so he does not expect to pay for losing.",
                "Moreover, the Rama (Choshen Mishpat 207:13) cites the opinion of Rabbeinu Tam, that gambling is permitted only when the prize money is placed on a table owned by both parties (see <i>Bi'ur Hagra</i>, C.M. 207:37). Most cases of gambling do not fulfill this requirement, as they usually take place in the home of a single player or in a casino.",
                "<i><b>Raffles and Lotteries</b></i>",
                "A possible exception to the halachic problems with gambling is a lottery conducted to raise funds for a charity. Rav Yosef Adler reports that Rav Yosef Dov Soloveitchik permitted purchasing a lottery ticket if the purpose of the lottery is to raise money for a charity, because the rule of <i>asmachta </i>does not apply to charitable contributions (Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 258:10). <i>Asmachta </i>occurs only when someone does not intend to truly obligate himself, but the losers of a charity fundraiser feel comfortable relinquishing their money, knowing that it will be used for a positive purpose.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is unclear whether this leniency applies to lotteries that donate only a small percentage of their profits to charity.</i>",
                "Rav Aharon Lichtenstein (cited in <i>Daf Kesher </i>1:83-85) offers a different reason to permit lotteries and raffles, explaining that one who purchases a ticket buys a right to compete in the lottery. At the time of this purchase, the buyer consents fully to the sale. Should the buyer regret the sale after he loses the lottery, it is too late to undo the sale. Undoing such a sale would be the equivalent of one who purchases a stock demanding to abrogate the sale after a subsequent stock market crash. For Sephardic Jews, it has already been noted that Rav Ovadia Yosef prohibits purchasing lottery and soccer pool tickets.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Ovadia adds that even Ashkenazic Jews should not buy tickets in Israeli soccer pools (\"Toto\"), as these tickets support soccer games played on Shabbat. We have already noted that, according to Rav Aharon Lichtenstein, these pools may constitute an <i>asmachta</i>, as their participants believe that their superior understanding of soccer enables them to bet correctly.</i> Nonetheless, Rav Ovadia cites Rav Yosef Chaim of Baghdad (<i>Rav Pe'alim</i>) as permitting raffles in which the prize is an object, as the winner does not directly take the money of the other participants. Common practice in the observant community is to conduct raffles as fundraisers.",
                "<i><b>Moral Considerations</b></i>",
                "The Rivash (432) describes gambling as \"disgusting, abominable, and repulsive,\" noting its terrible effect on society even according to those who do not technically define it as theft. Rav Ovadia Yosef (<i>Yabia Omer</i>, vol. 7, C.M. 6) adds to the Rivash's comments:",
                "Also, regarding the lottery, there are many people who buy a lot of tickets, [spending] almost their entire salary, thinking that one number may win, and in the end… they lose all their money and property.",
                "Due to moral objections, the authorities cited at the beginning of this chapter similarly condemn engaging even in \"recreational gambling,\" in addition to the potential problems of theft. In 1996, Rav Mordechai Willig instructed a convention of the National Conference of Synagogue Youth to refrain from all forms of gambling (including horse racing, football pools, and rotisserie leagues), due to the aforementioned rulings of the Rambam (<i>Hilchot Gezeilah Va'aveidah </i>6:10-11). Rav Willig admitted that many Ashkenazic authorities disagree with the Rambam's claim that all gambling with a Jew is actual theft. However, no one would question the truth of the Rambam's statement that gambling, even when there is no theft involved, is a total waste of time, is the antithesis of wisdom, and contributes nothing positive to the world. Rav Willig cited many of the catastrophic results of habitual gambling, repeatedly decrying gambling and its results as \"<i>churbano shel olam</i>\" - destroying society.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>The Jerusalem Report </i>(August 16, 1999, pp. 26-32) regarding the disproportionately high incidence of gambling problems in Israel and Jewish communities worldwide.</i>",
                "Rav Hershel Schachter (in a lecture at Yeshiva University) even objected to lotteries commonly conducted at weddings to determine which guest will keep the table centerpiece, based on a similar law in the Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chaim 322:6). He explained that the activity prohibited by the Shulchan Aruch, casting lots to determine which child in a family will receive the biggest portion of food, reflects a general prohibition against activities that teach people the thrill of gambling.",
                "The Mishnah Berurah and <i>Aruch Hashulchan </i>(cited at the beginning of the article) strongly discourage playing cards on <i>Chanukah</i>. Rav Moshe Feinstein refers to card playing and bingo as despicable activities (\"<i>devarim mecho'arim</i>\"). Rav Aharon Lichtenstein commented (to this author) that casinos and gambling halls are \"symbols of decadence in society.\" Rav Yehuda Amital said, \"People are seeking forms of excitement in life [which are unhealthy].\" Rav Soloveitchik put it succinctly, as mentioned earlier - \"It is a bad habit; don't do it!\"",
                "The Torah (Vayikra 19:2) exhorts us: \"<i>Kedoshim tih'yu</i>\" (\"Be holy\"). Many great rabbis have declared that gambling is incompatible with the Jewish people's goal of being a holy people. While it is highly unusual for the <i>Aruch Hashulchan </i>to strongly condemn a practice of the observant community, he does so regarding the practice of many Jews to gamble on <i>Chanukah</i>. Perhaps he reacted so harshly because he served as the rabbi of a city (Novaradok, in pre-World War I Lithuania), where he may have seen the devastating effects that gambling often has on individuals, their families, and society as a whole. In short, let us remember the words of the Mishnah Berurah regarding gambling, \"<i>Hashomer nafsho yirchak mizeh</i>\" (\"He who values his soul will stay away from it\")."

And so, if the question were to come before us, that by sacrificing one Jew the Messiah would come, of course we would rule that it is better for the Messiah not to come, and a Jew should not die.

Rav Aharon Lichtenstein, who also permits exchanging land for peace, once cited a story involving Rav Tzvi Yehudah Kook to illustrate this point. Rav Tzvi Yehudah cried the day the State of Israel was established out of disappointment that much of <i>Eretz Yisrael </i>would wind up under non-Jewish control. Rav Lichtenstein firmly stated that even if one does not agree with Rav Tzvi Yehudah's view regarding the exchange of land for peace, his view regarding the sanctity of <i>Eretz Yisrael </i>must be accepted. For the Jewish people, <i>Eretz Yisrael </i>is not merely a national homeland, but the Holy Land given by God to His nation.

                "Throughout the State of Israel's short existence, it has granted military exemptions to full-time Yeshivah students. These exemptions and the decision by some Yeshivah students to serve in the army nonetheless have both generated much debate and discussion.",
                "<b><i>Should a Spiritual Person Serve in an Army?</i></b>",
                "People often ask, how can someone thoroughly engrossed in spiritual matters serve in the army, a rugged and physically intense experience? Our own male role models answer this question. Avraham, Moshe, Yehoshua, and David all scaled the heights of spirituality, yet they excelled at waging war. The Gemara (<i>Mo'ed Katan </i>16b) describes this phenomenon, \"David] would soften himself as a worm when he studied Torah, but he hardened himself like wood when he fought in war.\"",
                "Rav Yehuda Amital (<i>Hama'alot Mima'amakim</i>, pp. 62-63) cites David's model as a paradigm for <i>hesder</i> students. They grapple with the subtlety of a great Talmudic commentary, such as \"<i>Ketzot</i>,\" \"<i>Netivot</i>,\" or \"Reb Chaim,\" while on the other hand serving with great distinction in the Israeli army. Indeed, it is widely reported that religiously observant soldiers comprise a significant percentage of the junior officers in certain Israeli army units (although these officers do not necessarily participate in the <i>hesder</i> program).",
                "Other sources similarly describe holy people as potent warriors. The Rambam (<i>Hilchot Melachim</i>,<i> C</i>hapter 11) presents a profile of the Messiah. He studies Torah and is devoted to the Written and Oral Torah. He will compel the entire Jewish people to follow the Torah, and he will lead the nation in battle. The Ramban (Bereishit 26:29) explains what motivated Philistine kings to make covenants with our forefathers, who led a small nomadic tribe, seemingly posing little threat to the Philistine emperor:",
                "Avraham was very great and mighty, as he had in his house three hundred sword-bearing men and many allies. He himself was a lion-hearted soldier who pursued and vanquished four very powerful kings. When his success became evident as being divinely ordained, the Philistine king feared him, lest he conquer his kingdom... And the son emulated the father, as Yitzchak was great like [Avraham], and the king was afraid to fight him, lest [the king] be driven from his land.",
                "Aside from these individuals, the Bible contains other examples of wars where the spiritual elite fought. Rashi (Bemidbar 31:3) asserts that the soldiers in the wars against <i>Amaleik</i> (Shemot 17:8-16) and <i>Midyan </i>(Bemidbar 31) were specifically chosen based on their religious piety. The Radak and Malbim (<i>Shofetim </i>5:14) explain that, after defeating the army of Canaan, the prophetess Devorah gave special praise to the people of Machir and Zevulun precisely because their religious leaders fought in the battle. All of these sources clearly teach that no fundamental problem exists with spiritual leaders serving in an army. The advisability of their service in the Israeli army today, however, remains to be determined.",
                "<b><i>The Model of the Tribe of Levi</i></b>",
                "Some point to the tribe of Levi as a model for those who study and teach Torah full- time, while never serving in the army. Indeed, the Rambam's concluding remarks in <i>Hilchot Shemitah Veyoveil </i>(13:12-13) depict the tribe of Levi in this manner, \"<b>They do not wage war </b>like the rest of Israel, nor do they inherit land in Israel.\" Moreover, the Rambam writes:",
                "[Being a part of the spiritual elite] applies not to the tribe of Levi alone, but to each and every person throughout the world whose spirit has uplifted him and whose intelligence has given him the understanding to stand before God, to serve Him, to worship Him, to know God; and he walks upright, since he has cast off from his neck the many considerations which people seek. Such a person has been sanctified as the Holy of Holies, and the Lord shall be his portion... forever and ever, and shall grant him adequacy in this world, as he has granted to the <i>Kohanim</i> and the Levites. As David... says, \"Oh Lord, the Portion of my inheritance and of my cup, You maintain my lot.\"",
                "This passage is often cited to excuse contemporary Yeshivah students from serving in the Israeli army. This application, however, contains several possible problems. The Rambam often ends sections of the <i>Mishneh Torah </i>with aggadic (non-legal) statements. Thus, perhaps he does not intend his comments at the end of <i>Hilchot Shemitah Veyoveil</i>,<i> </i>which conclude <i>Sefer Zera'im</i>,<i> </i>as a technical legal assertion. Furthermore, the Rambam points to King David, one of our greatest military leaders, as an example of such a spiritual person, so the Rambam might not intend to apply the parallel with Levi to military exemptions. Even if one does accept such an application, it remains unclear to what percentage of the population such a grand description applies.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Aharon Lichtenstein (<i>Tradition</i>, 19:199-217) writes the following pragmatic point regarding the application of the Rambam's words:<br>[The Rambam] presents and idealizes the portrait of a selfless, temporal, almost ethereal person - one whose spirit and intelligence have led him to divest himself of all worldly concerns and who has devoted himself \"to stand before God, to serve Him, to worship, to know [Him]\"... To how large a segment of the Torah community - or <i>a fortiori</i>, of any community - does this lofty typology apply? To two percent? Five percent? Can anyone... confront a mirror and tell himself that he ought not to go to the army because he is \"<i>Kodesh Kodashim</i>,\" <i>sanctum sanctorum</i>, in the Rambam's terms?</i>",
                "<b><i>Did Levites Actually Serve in the Army?</i></b>",
                "The Talmud never states explicitly that the Levites did not serve in the army. The <i>Sifrei </i>(commenting on Bemidbar 31:4) addresses this issue regarding the war between the Jews and <i>Midyan</i>, but textual variants lead to opposing conclusions. Rashi's text of the <i>Sifrei </i>(in his commentary on that verse), understands that the Torah <b>includes</b> (\"<i>lerabot</i>\") Levi in the army that fought against <i>Midyan</i>. However, the Gra's text of the <i>Sifrei </i>reads \"to <b>exclude</b> (<i>lehotzi</i>) the tribe of Levi\" from that war. This passage in the <i>Sifrei </i>thus proves nothing about Levi's role in the army.",
                "While the Rambam does mention Levi's military exemption at the end of <i>Hilchot Shemitah Veyoveil</i>, it is uncertain how much weight this carries, because he does not present this rule in <i>Hilchot Melachim</i>, where he discusses military exemptions at length. In fact, the Radak (<i>II Shmuel</i> 23:20) claims that in wars against the enemies of Israel, even the <i>Kohanim </i>(the most sanctified part of the tribe of Levi), who ordinarily avoid contact with dead bodies, must take an active part in killing the enemy.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">From the Radak's comment in <i>I Melachim </i>(2:25), it sounds as if he only believes that <i>Kohanim </i>are <b>permitted</b> (but not obligated) to take part in fighting enemies. However, he writes there that he is merely restating what he wrote in <i>II Shmuel </i>23:20.</i> David's great warrior, Benayahu ben Yehoyada, exemplified this practice. Despite being a <i>Kohein</i>, he served as a high-ranking officer in King David's army and eventually became the head of King Shlomo's army. Moreover, the Gemara (Kiddushin 21b) and the Rambam (<i>Hilchot</i> <i>Melachim</i> 8:4) discuss the laws of a <i>Kohein </i>who fights in wars, indicating that this was done in practice.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Talmud discusses whether a <i>Kohein </i>is permitted to take an <i>eishet yefat to'ar</i> (see Devarim 21:10-14).</i>",
                "On the other hand, whenever the Torah takes a census of those who are fit to wage war (\"<i>kol yotzei tzava</i>\"), it excludes the tribe of Levi, implying that this tribe does not fight in the army. The Rashbam (Bemidbar 1:47) even refers explicitly to their exclusion for the army. Hence, using the Levites as a paradigm for excusing Torah scholars from serving in the army remains debatable, for the status of Levi is itself uncertain.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For a complete discussion of the status of Levi in the army, see Rav Yehoshua Hagar-Lau's<i> Ha'oz Veha'anavah</i> (pp.127-141).</i>",
                "<b><i>Milchamot Mitzvah</i></b>",
                "In Halachah, there are two types of wars (see Sotah 44b). One type, <i>milchamot reshut</i> (\"discretionary wars\"), consists of wars fought to enlarge the borders of Israel and wars fought to bring glory to its king.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For further discussion of <i>milchamot reshut</i>, see Rav Yehuda Amital's article in <i>Techumin </i>(8:454-461).</i> The other type, <i>milchamot mitzvah</i>, includes wars against <i>Amaleik</i> and the seven Canaanite tribes. The Rambam (<i>Hilchot Melachim </i>5:1) also categorizes \"saving the Jewish people from enemies who have attacked them\" as a <i>milchemet mitzvah</i>. It follows from the Rambam that all the wars that the State of Israel has fought should be classified as <i>milchamot mitzvah</i>, for almost everyone regards them as saving Jewish people from enemies who have attacked them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Contemporary Halakhic Problems </i>(1:13-18) and Rav Shlomo Yosef Zevin's <i>Le'or Hahalachah</i> (p. 65).</i>",
                "While the Mishnah (Sotah 43a) lists those people who need not fight in battle,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These people include one who has bought, inherited, or built a new house or storehouse, but did not yet use it; one who is in his first year of using a house or storehouse; one who plants, buys, inherits, or grafts (within one species) either a new vineyard or five fruit trees, but has not yet reaped their fruits; one who is in his first year of reaping fruits from either a vineyard or five trees; one who is halachically engaged (<i>me'oras</i>) or has to perform a levirate marriage (<i>yibum</i>); one who is in his first year of marriage; and one who is afraid to go to battle. Interestingly, this list includes neither Levites nor Torah scholars.</i> it later (44b) limits these exemptions. The Mishnah rules that they only apply to a <i>milchemet reshut</i>, \"but in a <i>milchemet mitzvah </i>everyone must go fight, even a groom from his chamber and a bride from her canopy.\" In fact, the <i>Keren Orah </i>(Sotah 44b) writes explicitly, \"Everyone must participate in a <i>milchemet mitzvah</i>. <b>Even Torah scholars </b>must interrupt their studies.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Maharsha (Sotah 10a s.v. <i>Mipnei</i>). He asserts that a <i>chatan </i>(bridegroom) must fight in a <i>milchemet mitzvah</i>, and it is unclear from his language if he also applies this obligation to a Torah scholar.

                "In order to understand the status of preemptive attacks, we must first solve a more basic problem. The Rambam's categorization of a war to defend the Jewish people as a <i>milchemet mitzvah</i> appears to contradict the Gemara (Sotah 44b). The Gemara considers attacking a nation to prevent it from eventually attacking Israel a <i>milchemet reshut</i>. Explaining the Rambam's ruling in light of this passage in the Gemara determines the status of preemptive attacks.",
                "The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> (<i>Hilchot</i> <i>Melachim</i> 5:1) claims that a battle fought purely to intimidate an enemy (so that it will not dare to attack Israel) is in fact a <i>milchemet reshut </i>(as indicated by the Gemara). When the Rambam describes a <i>milchemet mitzvah</i>, the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> implies, he only includes military activities that respond to an actual enemy attack. It seems that according to the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>, preemptive strikes might not be <i>milchamot mitzvah</i>, although it is not entirely clear where he draws the line between offensive and defensive battles.",
                "The <i>Aruch Hashulchan He'atid (Hilchot Melachim</i> 74:3-4) strongly disagrees with the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> and writes that \"it's obvious beyond any doubt\" that a king must preemptively attack anyone who poses a threat to the Jewish people. The <i>Aruch Hashulchan </i>asserts that the Rambam describes even offensive strikes to save Jews as <i>milchamot mitzvah</i>. However, the <i>Aruch Hashulchan</i> suggests, all defensive wars differ from wars against <i>Amaleik</i> and the tribes of Canaan. A nation can usually launch strikes to enhance its security without the entire nation's participation, so the standard exemptions from the army apply to such a war. In this sense, defending Jews is like a <i>milchemet reshut</i>, as the Gemara indicated.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For further discussion of this issue, see <i>Contemporary Halakhic Problems</i> (3:251-292).

                "The Talmud (Berachot 11a and Sukkah 25a) posits the rule of <i>ha'osek bemitzvah patur min hamitzvah</i> - while one is involved in the performance of one <i>mitzvah</i>, he is excused from performing another one. The Ra'ah and Ritva (Sukkah 25a) assert that not only is the one involved in performing a <i>mitzvah</i> <b>excused</b> from other <i>mitzvot</i>, but he is <b>forbidden </b>to perform them. Accordingly, some argue that Yeshivah students engage in constant Torah study, so they may not abandon their learning to serve in the Israeli army. This suggestion is somewhat problematic, because we generally assumed that <i>ha'osek bemitzvah patur min hamitzvah</i> does not apply to Torah study.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See, however, Rav Aharon Lichtenstein's article in <i>Sefer Kavod Harav</i>, pp. 187-201, where he suggests that <i>oseik bemitzvah patur min hamitzvah </i>fundamentally applies to Torah study.</i> The Gemara (<i>Mo'eid Katan</i> 9a-9b) explains that if others are not able to perform a specific <i>mitzvah</i>, the student must interrupt his studies to perform that <i>mitzvah</i>. This being the case, Torah scholars should be obligated to serve in the Israeli army as long as the army needs them.",
                "Rav Zalman Melamed (<i>Techumin</i> 7:330-334) argues, however, that the Israeli army (in 1986) can function without the service of every man in the country. If he is correct, Torah study could exempt Torah scholars based on <i>haoseik bemitzvah patur min hamitzvah</i>, as others perform the <i>mitzvah</i> to defend Israel. Furthermore, the democratically elected government of Israel releases those who study in Yeshivah from the army (albeit due to political considerations). Rav Moshe Feinstein (<i>Teshuvot Igrot Moshe, Yoreh De'ah </i>4:33) writes that this governmental exemption constitutes recognition that those who sincerely study Torah deserve a draft exemption. He consequently rules that one who has a strong desire to learn Torah and strives to become great in Torah scholarship should study in Yeshivah and avoid the draft. This idea may be especially true if the army itself does not desire to draft Yeshivah student. Writing in 1986, Rav Avraham Sherman (<i>Techumin </i>7:343) notes that many in the army's top brass do not believe that it will benefit the army to draft those Yeshivah students who want exemptions.",

The Gemara explains that this exemption exists since \"rabbis do not require protection\" (\"<i>rabanan lo tzrichei netiruta</i>\"). Similarly, argues Rav Tukachinsky, rabbis need not serve in the army, as they do not require protection.",
                "Rav Yehudah Shaviv (<i>Techumin </i>1:37) cites the <i>Chatam Sofer'</i>s opinion that the Gemara only excuses rabbis from paying communal taxes, but they still must fight in defensive wars. Rav Aharon Lichtenstein (<i>Techumin </i>7:314-329 and <i>Tradition </i>19:199-217) also asserts that one would have to reach a very high spiritual level to fall into the category of those who do not require protection.",
                "The aforementioned Gemara also exempts rabbis from actively participating in communal construction projects. Rav Tukachinsky bases the exemption of Yeshivah students on this Halachah as well. Rav Shaviv, however, claims that the Rambam cites this Halachah (<i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 6:10), yet he never compares communal construction projects to military service. Hence, Rav Shaviv argues, Torah scholars are not exempt from military service.",
                "Regarding the Israeli army today, one might suggest that Rav Tukachinsky and Rav Shaviv's debate depends upon the type of unit in which one would serve. Combat units involve directly defending the people of Israel, so their soldiers do more than just routine community service. However, those soldiers who have profiles<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">\"Profiles\" are numbers, no higher than ninety nine, that the army assigns to each soldier based on his physical and mental fitness.</i> numbering lower than 72 generally may not serve in combat units.

For example, Rav Yechezkel Landau (<i>Teshuvot Noda Biy'hudah</i>,<i> Yoreh De'ah </i>2:61) writes, \"Midrashic and aggadic statements are intended solely to teach theology and ethics; they are not written with the intention of deciding <i>halachot</i>. Therefore, one may not base a halachic ruling on them.\" Nonetheless, the precise legal status of aggadic statements is somewhat complicated; see <i>Encyclopedia Talmudit</i> 1:132.</i>",
                "Rav Eliezer Waldenberg (<i>Hilchot</i> <i>Medinah</i> 3:3:4) cites an aggadic statement from the Gemara (Makkot 10a) to prove that Yeshivah students do not have to serve in the army. The Gemara states:",
                "What is the meaning of the [Psalmist's] words \"Our feet stood within thy gates, oh Jerusalem\"? [It is this:] What enabled us to \"stand\" in war? The gates of Jerusalem - the place where students engaged in the study of Torah.",

One could argue, however, that if this were truly the case, there would be an unambiguous halachic source exempting Yeshivah students from military service. Rather, perhaps the Talmud is referring to the studies of those people who cannot serve in the army due to illness or age.",
                "Another frequently cited source supporting military exemption appears in <i>Masechet Nedarim </i>(32a):",
                "Rabi Avahu said in the name of Rabi Elazar, \"Why was our father Avraham punished by having his descendants pressed into Egyptian servitude for two hundred and ten years? Because he coerced Torah scholars into serving in his army.\"",
                "A similar idea appears in Sotah (10a), explaining why King Asa was stricken with illness at the end of his life. The Gemara suggests that he was punished for using Torah scholars in his army. It is important to note that Rabi Elazar's opinion is only one of several possible causes that the Gemara cites for the enslavement in Egypt, and the other opinions might disagree with his idea. Furthermore, Rav Lichtenstein asserts that, at most, these texts contend that the Israeli Government should not coerce Yeshivah students into army service.

In addition, these students are performing the great <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>yishuv Eretz Yisrael </i>- settling and developing the Land of Israel. On the other hand, those who opt to learn in Yeshivah and avoid military service believe that they contribute toward the spiritual development of the Land of Israel. They also feel that their Torah study helps ensure that God protects the people of Israel physically. Furthermore, Rav Avraham Sherman (<i>Techumin </i>7:336-350) reports that, during his tenure as an army chaplain, he witnessed many observant Jews who abandoned Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> after their experiences in the IDF influenced them negatively.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Sherman's printed his article in 1986.

                "Conclusion",
                "There does seem to be a strong halachic basis for claiming that there is a <i>mitzvah </i>to serve in the IDF, as it defends the Jewish people. Nonetheless, many rabbis argue that service in the Israel Defense Forces is a <i>mitzvah</i> that others, who do not study full-time, are able to perform. However, there are prominent rabbis, such as Rav Aharon Lichtenstein, who view army service for Yeshivah students as a moral imperative."

Although Rav Henkin does not explain why these places are not <i>reshuyot harabim</i>, a number of arguments have been offered to support his contention that Flatbush is not in this category.

Rav Shaul Yisraeli (<i>Techumin </i>10:140) writes that a city constitutes one halachic entity for purposes of defining a <i>reshut harabim</i>. Moreover, the sole halachic criterion defining an area as a city is a contiguity of homes (see Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 398), but not municipal boundaries. Accordingly, he rules that the entire Tel Aviv metropolitan area (known as Gush Dan) should be viewed as one entity regarding the <i>reshut harabim </i>issue.

He explains that the overwhelming majority of the observant community in Tel Aviv relies on the <i>eruv </i>because it follows the Shulchan Aruch's presentation (Orach Chaim 345:7) of the view that requires 600,000 people for a <i>reshut harabim</i>. He implies that 600,000 people must pass through a <b>particular street </b>every day for it to be a public domain. Rav Yisraeli notes that the Mishnah Berurah (345:24 and Sha'ar Hatziyun 345:25) rules that 600,000 people need not pass through a particular street for the town to be defined as a <i>reshut harabim</i>. According to the Mishnah Berurah, anywhere with 600,000 residents is a <i>reshut harabim</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Moshe Feinstein (<i>Teshuvot Igrot Moshe</i>, O.C. 4:88) requires that the 600,000 people be within an area which is twelve <i>mil </i>by twelve <i>mil </i>(approximately eight miles by eight miles).</i>",

They follow the lenient understanding (Shulchan Aruch, to require 600,000 on one street) of the lenient opinion (Rashi, that 600,000 people are required for a <i>reshut harabim</i>)! Rav Yisraeli explains that it is possible to be so lenient only because we follow the opinion of those <i>Rishonim </i>(cited in Biur Halachah, 364:2 s.v. <i>Ve'achar</i>) who rule that <i>tzurot hapetach </i>suffice on a biblical level for even a <i>reshut </i><i><b>harabim</b></i>.

                    "In this chapter, we will address several issues that arise during the physical construction of an <i>eruv</i>. Before beginning to build and <i>eruv</i>, it must be determined if the area is a <i>reshut harabim </i>or merely a <i>karmelit</i>. If the area is a <i>karmelit</i>, surrounding it with <i>tzurot hapetach </i>suffices, whereas a <i>reshut harabim </i>must be enclosed by a wall, or at least by doors (Shulchan Aruch, O.C. 364:2, and Mishnah Berurah 364:8).",
                    "<i><b>Constructing Tzurot Hapetach</b></i>",
                    "Constructing a <i>tzurat hapetach </i>seems to be a simple and straightforward process. The Talmud (Eruvin 11b) states that a <i>tzurat hapetach </i>consists of two vertical poles with a horizontal pole directly on top of them (<i>kaneh mikan vekaneh mikan vekaneh al gabeihen</i>). However, the laws of <i>tzurot hapetach </i>are actually quite complex, particularly when constructing a community <i>eruv</i>. Community <i>eruvin </i>often use preexisting structures, which can significantly reduce the costs of building and maintaining an <i>eruv</i>. These structures, such as telephone poles, were not built for use in <i>eruvin </i>and often introduce halachic complexities.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For an explanation of how such structures may be used as <i>tzurot hapetach </i>despite the fact that they were not constructed for this purpose, see <i>Chazon Ish</i>, Orach Chaim 111:5. See Mishnah Berurah (362:64) for more sources on this issue.</i>",

                    "The Talmud (Eruvin 11b) records a dispute between Rav Nachman and Rav Sheishet about whether the vertical poles of a <i>tzurat hapetach </i>must extend all the way to the horizontal pole. The Halachah follows the opinion of Rav Nachman, that if the vertical poles are ten <i>tefachim </i>(approximately forty inches) high and are positioned precisely beneath the horizontal pole, the <i>tzurat hapetach </i>is acceptable. The horizontal pole need not touch the vertical poles and may be well above them (Shulchan Aruch, O.C. 362:11). The Mishnah Berurah (362:62) explains that the basis for this ruling is the principle of <i>gud asik </i>(literally, \"stretch up\"), which states that the Halachah views the vertical poles as extending upward to the horizontal pole.",
                    "<i><b>Gud Asik: Eyesight or Plumb Line?</b></i>",
                    "Although vertical poles of a <i>tzurat hapetach </i>need not touch the horizontal pole (or wire), they must be positioned directly underneath it. The poles cannot even be off by the slightest amount (see Mishnah Berurah 362:63). Halachic authorities debate how to determine the proper positioning.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Measurements for some areas of Halachah are estimated based on what appears correct to people, while other areas require precise measurements. For example, <i>terumah </i>(the fiftieth of grain which is given to <i>kohanim</i>) must be an estimate and may not be measured to precisely equal one-fiftieth (<i>Terumot </i>1:7). On the other hand, <i>techum Shabbat </i>(the area that one may not leave on Shabbat) must be measured precisely (Eruvin 57b, 58b). In many areas, it is unclear whether an estimate or precise measurement is required. For example, the <i>Chazon Ish </i>(<i>Hil. Tumat Tzaraat </i>8:1) writes that measurements for the spreading of a spot of leprosy are done by estimation. He bases himself on a passage in the Ramban's commentary to the Torah (Vayikra 13:5). However, the <i>Chazon Ish </i>does not mention that the Rosh (<i>Tosafot Harosh</i>, <i>Mo'eid Katan </i>7a, cited in the <i>Tur</i>'s long commentary to Vayikra 13:5) requires the use of measuring implements to determine the leprosy spot's growth.</i> Rav Yosef Dov Soloveitchik (as reported by Rav Yosef Adler) and Rav Moshe Feinstein (reported by Rav Elazar Meyer Teitz, from his uncle, Rav Pesach Rayman) both felt that it is sufficient to estimate the poles' positioning with one's eyes. Rav Zalman Nechemia Goldberg (personal communication) also permits using eyesight, although he requires building very wide vertical beams to allow for a wide margin of error in their positioning.",
                    "However, Rav Yitzchak Liebes, Rav J. David Bleich, Rav Hershel Schachter, Rav Feivel Cohen,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Cohen believes that two sets of vertical poles must be constructed, one set that appears to be under the horizontal pole and one set that has been measured to be precisely under the horizontal pole (if the position determined by sight differs from the position determined by the plumb line). It is not clear, however, that Rav Moshe and Rav Soloveitchik invalidate an <i>eruv </i>that was measured by plumb line. It may be that they also recognize such an <i>eruv </i>but add that measuring by eyesight is <b>also </b>acceptable. Rav Shlomo Miller (in his letter of approbation for <i>The Contemporary Eruv</i>) presents an argument for why constructing an <i>eruv </i>with plumb line measurements suffices according to all authorities.</i> and Rav Mordechai Willig (all through personal communication) rule that a plumb line (or other device for measuring verticality) is necessary to ensure that everything lines up appropriately. The Gemara (Eruvin 94b) requires constructing \"halachic walls\" (and presumably <i>tzurot hapetach </i>as well) in the same manner that people usually build walls (<i>kede'avdei inshei</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The significance of <i>kede'avdei inshei </i>is particularly emphasized by Rav Shlomo Kluger (<i>Teshuvot Ha'elef Lecha Shlomo </i>156, 157, 161, 170, 173, 174).</i> Builders and carpenters have used plumb lines for thousands of years; they appear in Amos (7:7-8) and the Mishnah (for example, <i>Kil'ayim </i>6:9 and <i>Keilim </i>29:3). Accordingly, a plumb line must be used in constructing a <i>tzurat hapetach</i>. Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach told this author that, while it is best to use a plumb line, one may rely on eyesight alone if it is \"impossible\" to construct the <i>eruv </i>otherwise.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Of course, the definition of \"impossible\" is debatable. Rav Hershel Schachter (in response to what this author quoted from Rav Shlomo Zalman) insisted that it is never impossible to measure precisely, especially with the invention of devices such as laser pointers. Similar to Rav Shlomo Zalman's ruling, the Rama (O.C. 456:3) permits estimating the measurement for separating <i>challah </i>when measuring precisely is not feasible (although he addresses a halachic impediment, rather than practical difficulty).</i>",
                    "Rav David Lifshitz (Rav of Suwalk immediately before World War II) told this author that a plumb line was used when constructing <i>tzurot hapetach </i>in Suwalk. Rav Ephraim Oshry (Rav of the Kovno Ghetto) told this author that in Kovno they relied on eyesight alone. Rav Yosef Singer (Rav of Pilzno prior to World War II) also reported that he believes the rabbis he knew in Europe relied on eyesight alone. Accordingly, this debate has raged for at least 60 years. Rav Meir Goldwicht informed this author that Israeli communities today also have divergent practices regarding this issue. In order to avoid this problem, many communities erect vertical poles that reach the horizontal wire or pole. This method avoids the need to estimate from afar if the pole is directly under the wire.",

                    "Another major area of debate in constructing <i>tzurot hapetach </i>is the status of \"<i>tachuv</i>,” when the horizontal pole (or wire) does not rest atop the vertical poles, but is drilled through them instead. Cases of <i>tachuv </i>frequently arise today, as many wires on utility poles, especially those used for cable television, are attached to bolts that pass into holes in the poles.

Furthermore, if the vertical poles are not under the horizontal one, but to its side (<i>tzurat hapetach min hatzad</i>), the <i>tzurat hapetach </i>is unacceptable (Eruvin 11b). The Talmud does not specifically address a situation in which the horizontal pole passes through the vertical poles.",
                    "The <i>Acharonim </i>debate the acceptability of such a <i>tzurat hapetach</i>. The Mishnah Berurah (362:64) notes that the Pri Megadim was uncertain regarding this issue and therefore was inclined to rule strictly.

Similarly, a horizontal wire that passes through a hole in a vertical pole should be acceptable.",
                    "This issue has not been resolved; some rabbis rely on the lenient opinion, while others follow the strict one. Rav Dovid Feinstein has told this author that the leniency of <i>tachuv </i>should not be employed in community <i>eruvin</i>.

                    "The <i>Acharonim </i>debate whether an obstruction (and not simply an open space) between a vertical pole and a horizontal pole invalidates a <i>tzurat hapetach</i>. The Mishnah Berurah (363:112) cites the Taz as ruling that a <i>tzurat hapetach </i>is invalid if a roof interrupts between one of its vertical poles and the horizontal pole or wire. His reasoning seems to be that <i>gud asik </i>(the theoretical \"stretching\" of the vertical pole to reach the horizontal one) only applies when nothing obstructs between the poles. An authority cited by the <i>Melamed Leho'il </i>(1:66) and an authority cited by the <i>Aruch Hashulchan </i>(Orach Chaim 363:46) disagree with the Taz and see no problem with a tangible separation between the poles.

                    "This question is of major importance when constructing a communal <i>eruv</i>, as telephone wires often do not pass directly over the telephone poles. In some communal <i>eruvin</i>, small beams are positioned under the desired wires and are then attached to the telephone poles. These poles often contain objects between the vertical beams or strips and the utility wire, such as boxes, campaign posters, and advertising billboards. Communities that attach wire molding to the telephone pole all the way up to the wire avoid this problem entirely.",

                    "Telephone and utility poles frequently have wires attached to their sides, rather than on top. It is thus important to determine whether one may use such a wire and pole as a <i>tzurat hapetach </i>without affixing additional materials to the telephone pole. One could argue that this would be acceptable, because telephone poles are often thicker on the bottom than they are on top. Therefore, a wire attached to the side of the pole on top passes directly over the extra thickness of the lower part of the pole. Perhaps this thickness constitutes a \"vertical pole\" of the <i>tzurat hapetach</i>. One must check, of course, that the extra thickness at the bottom sticks out under this wire for ten <i>tefachim </i>of the pole's height, for every vertical pole in a <i>tzurat hapetach </i>must be ten <i>tefachim </i>high.",

He adds that if there is an indentation cut in the pole, perhaps this pole and wire may then be used for a <i>tzurat hapetach</i>. The indentation must be ten <i>tefachim </i>above the ground.

One might argue that the <i>tzurat hapetach </i>is not noticeable (<i>nikar</i>) if it is situated within a <i>reshut hayachid </i>(such as a private yard). Alternatively, one might claim that the walls or fences that encompass a <i>reshut hayachid </i>are viewed halachically as extending \"all the way to the heavens\" (see Shabbat 7a), so the airspace above a <i>reshut hayachid </i>is halachically impenetrable.

                    "Nonetheless, some suggest that the string may not be so flimsy that it sways in the wind. The Mishnah Berurah (362:66) presents two opinions regarding this issue. One focus of the argument is whether the horizontal wire has to be sufficiently sturdy that it can withstand \"conventional\" winds (<i>omeid beruach metzuyah</i>). He quotes the well-known rule that for a halachic wall (<i>mechitzah</i>) to be valid, it must be sturdy enough to withstand ordinary winds. This rule undoubtedly applies to the vertical poles of a <i>tzurat hapetach</i>, but one opinion claims that it does not apply to the horizontal strings (or poles). Another objection to flimsy wires is that normal doorframes are not constructed in such a manner (see Eruvin 94b). The <i>Aruch Hashulchan </i>(362:37) rules leniently regarding this concern, while the <i>Chazon Ish </i>(Orach Chaim 71:10) rules strictly.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Chazon Ish </i>invalidates the wire as long as the wind can move part of it outside a straight line between the two vertical poles. Rav Nata Greenblatt told this author that he constructed the Memphis, Tennessee <i>eruv </i>with unusually wide vertical poles in order that the wires do not sway beyond the width of the vertical poles.</i> Common practice appears to accept the lenient approach.",
                    "In a true doorframe, the horizontal beam goes straight from one vertical beam to the other. When constructing a <i>tzurat hapetach</i>, it happens sometimes that the wire will wrap around things, such as trees or poles, which it does not pass over. Consequently, the wire, which should parallel the top beam of a doorway, will zigzag between the vertical poles rather than going straight from one of them to the other. Rav Yehuda Henkin (<i>Bnei Banim </i>1:19) suggests that the status of such a wire depends upon the same dispute as the status of a wire which is blown from side to side in the wind, for both wires move horizontally from being directly between the vertical poles. In defense of the lenient position, Rav Henkin claims that a minor zigzag is permissible, because the Gemara (Eruvin 11a) describes <i>eruvin </i>made of grapevines, which are not completely straight. Nonetheless, Rav Henkin claims that a curve of greater than twenty-two degrees invalidates the <i>tzurat hapetach</i>. Rav Yosef Adler reports that Rav Yosef Dov Soloveitchik also espoused this position. Rav Meir Arik (<i>Teshuvot Imrei Yosher </i>2:133) claims that the wire is only valid if it does not sway or veer more than three <i>tefachim </i>in any direction.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For a criticism of this position, see <i>The Contemporary Eruv </i>(pp. 74-75).</i> This author has heard that <i>eruvin </i>designed by Rav Shimon Eider (such as the <i>eruv </i>in West Orange, New Jersey) allow for almost no zigzagging.

The <i>Mishkenot Yaakov </i>(111, cited by Sha'ar Hatziyun 362:56) and the <i>Chazon Ish </i>(Orach Chaim 71:10) rule that a sagging wire disqualifies a <i>tzurat hapetach</i>. If the wire sags, it probably sways in the wind, which is problematic according to some authorities (mentioned above). Furthremore a <i>tzurat hapetach </i>must be constructed in a manner that replicates the way people construct doorframes, and people do not manufacture doorframes that sag on top. Interestingly, Rav Yosef Dov Soloveitchik (cited in <i>Nefesh Harav </i>p. 170) recalled from his childhood that he visited his grandfather, Rav Chaim Soloveitchik, in Brisk and went with the <i>dayan </i>(rabbinic judge) of Brisk to check the community <i>eruv</i>. During that trip, the <i>dayan </i>tightened all the horizontal wires so that they would not sag, apparently following the <i>Mishkenot Yaakov</i>'s opinion.",
                    "Despite these rulings, Rav Tzvi Pesach Frank (<i>Teshuvot Har Tzvi </i>2:18:8) permits sagging, as long as a significant part of the wire (about ten inches) does not come within ten <i>tefachim </i>of the ground. In addition, the <i>Aruch Hashulchan </i>does not cite the strict ruling of the <i>Mishkenot Yaakov </i>at all. The practice of most communities in Europe reportedly was to follow the lenient opinion in this area.",
                    "Communal practices today still differ in this area. Some communities follow a compromise approach that the horizontal wire may sag up to three <i>tefachim </i>(approximately 9-12 inches),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Rav Shimon Eider's <i>Halachos of the Eruv </i>(p. 24).</i> based on the concept of <i>lavud</i>, that a gap of less than three <i>tefachim </i>is considered closed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Another common example of <i>lavud </i>is a chain link fence, which serves as a solid wall if the gaps between the links are less than three <i>tefachim </i>wide.</i>",

                    "Because a <i>tzurat hapetach </i>should be built like a true doorway, a potential problem arises when one pole is taller than the other, putting the horizontal wire on a slant (even though it is taut). One could claim that this should be invalid, as most doorways are built with the horizontal beam perpendicular to the vertical beams. Nonetheless, the Mishnah Berurah (362:60) rules that even if the horizontal wire is slanted, the <i>tzurat hapetach </i>is acceptable. He cites (Sha'ar Hatziyun 362:46) the opinion of Rav Akiva Eiger, however, that an exceedingly slanted wire might disqualify the <i>tzurat hapetach</i>. Rav Aharon Kotler (cited in Rav Shimon Eider's <i>Halachos of the Eruv</i>, p. 23) rules that a slant of less than forty-five degrees is acceptable even according to Rav Akiva Eiger. The <i>Netivot Shabbat </i>(19:27 note 60) claims that a slant of more than twenty-two degrees is problematic.",

                    "After constructing an <i>eruv</i>, three major issues remain: <i>karpeif</i>, <i>eruv chatzeirot</i>, and <i>sechirat reshut</i>.",
                    "<i><b>Karpeif</b></i>",
                    "A potentially major obstacle in creating a viable community <i>eruv </i>is the existence of a <i>karpeif </i>within the enclosed area. A <i>karpeif </i>is an area at least 100 <i>amot </i>(between 150 and 200 feet) by 50 <i>amot </i>(between 75 and 100 feet) that is not used for human habitation or other human needs.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Eruvin 23a-b and Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 358.</i> Accordingly, sports fields, playgrounds, and lakes used for boating do not constitute <i>karpeifiyot</i>. <i>Chazal </i>forbade carrying within a <i>karpeif </i>even if it is located within a <i>reshut hayachid </i>created by <i>mechitzot </i>or <i>tzurot hapetach</i>. This is because the <i>reshut hayachid </i>must be encompassed by <i>mechitzot </i>or <i>tzurot hapetach </i>that were built for the purpose of <b>human habitation </b>(<i>mukaf ledirah</i>). A wall or <i>tzurat hapetach </i>built to surround an uninhabited forest is not built for the sake of human habitation, so it does not permit people to carry on Shabbat within that forest.",
                    "Moreover, the presence of a <i>karpeif </i>forbids carrying in the entire enclosed area surrounding it, because an area's walls or <i>tzurot hapetach </i>must be erected purely for human habitation. If they also include a <i>karpeif</i>, however, they are erected for an area that is not entirely fit for human habitation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For an analysis of the <i>karpeif'</i>s impact on the walls, see Biur Halachah (358:9 s.v. <i>Hazra'im</i>).</i> This author's experience indicates that this issue arises much more often in suburban and rural areas than in urban areas, as an urban setting contains fewer undeveloped areas. The <i>Chazon Ish </i>(O.C. 88:25) writes that the only way to prevent a <i>karpeif </i>from invalidating the rest of the <i>eruv</i>'s area is to encompass the <i>karpeif </i>with either <i>mechitzot </i>or <i>tzurot hapetach</i>, thereby excluding it from the <i>eruv</i>. The community is then <i>mukaf ledirah</i>, while the uninhabited <i>karpeif </i>is severed from it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Also see the Biur Halachah (358:9 s.v. <i>Aval</i>).</i>",
                    "The lenient positions of some authorities might also solve this problem. The Biur Halachah (358:9 s.v. <i>Aval</i>) cites one such approach from the <i>Devar Shmuel</i>. He rules that if a <i>karpeif </i>is situated within a city and is only a small part of the city, it does not prohibit carrying within that area.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Of course, the <i>Devar Shmuel</i>'s leniency does not apply to <i>eruvin </i>that enclose very large forest areas, since his entire reason is that the <i>karpeif </i>is negligible compared to the inhabited area. When this author sought to construct an <i>eruv </i>in a certain summer community in Connecticut, Rav Hershel Schachter ruled that the <i>eruv </i>could not be built, because the <i>tzurot hapetach </i>would have had to encompass huge tracts of forest. Rav Schachter also did not permit relying on the extraordinarily lenient views of <i>Teshuvot Divrei Malkiel </i>(cited in <i>Melamed Leho'il </i>1:65) and <i>Teshuvot Even Yekara </i>(O.C. 16), which would have facilitated constructing the <i>eruv</i>, as these views are not accepted by most halachic authorities.</i> The <i>Devar Shmuel </i>reasons that, in such a situation, the <i>karpeif </i>is negligible compared to the rest of the city and may be ignored.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although the <i>Devar Shmuel </i>speaks of a city surrounded by walls, his ruling appears to apply equally to a city surrounded by <i>tzurot hapetach</i>; see <i>Melamed Leho'il </i>(1:65).</i>",
                    "Halachic authorities have reacted to the <i>Devar Shmuel</i>'s leniency with mixed feelings. On one hand, the <i>Chazon Ish </i>(cited earlier) rejects this approach, as he sees no reason for a <i>karpeif </i>within a city to differ from one in a more rural area. The Biur Halachah expresses serious reservations concerning this leniency, but he seems to accept the conclusion of the <i>Chacham Tzvi</i>, that the <i>Devar Shmuel</i>'s opinion may be followed where it is impossible to construct an <i>eruv </i>otherwise.",
                    "This issue remains controversial, as some communities rely on the <i>Devar Shmuel </i>while others do not. A number of Israeli rabbis have told this author that the practice in Israel is to follow the lenient opinion of the <i>Devar Shmuel </i>(except in Bnei Brak, where the <i>Chazon Ish </i>resided). This is hardly surprising, since <i>eruvin </i>in Israel often encompass entire cities.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For example, according to information received from the Jerusalem Rabbinate in 1991, the circumference of Jerusalem's <i>eruv </i>is approximately 110 kilometers.</i> It is exceedingly difficult to exclude every <i>karpeif </i>within Israel's growing cities. Hence, in keeping with the approach of the Biur Halachah, they rely on the <i>Devar Shmuel</i>'s lenient ruling.",

If, however, humans in no way benefit from the area, it must be excluded from the <i>eruv</i>.",

                    "Even after a proper community <i>eruv </i>has been constructed and the area encompassed is thereby rendered a <i>reshut hayachid</i>, one may still not carry within it on Shabbat. Despite the fact that it is biblically permitted to carry from one <i>reshut hayachid </i>(one's house) to another (in our case, the outside area enclosed by the <i>eruv</i>), the Rabbis prohibited this in many cases. Similarly, this rabbinical prohibition often precludes carrying from one household to another even within the same building.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If there is only one Jewish resident in the building, this prohibition does not apply (Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 382:1). It also does not apply if all of the residents eat together or if the landlord stores property in all of the residences (Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 370:2,4). Rav Moshe Feinstein (<i>Teshuvot Igrot Moshe</i>, O.C. 1:141) rules that a landlord who rents out items (such as stoves or refrigerators) with every apartment is considering to be \"storing\" his property with the tenants, so no <i>eruv chatzeirot </i>is needed. On the other hand, the <i>Chazon Ish </i>(O.C. 92) and <i>Chelkat Yaakov </i>(1:207) require an <i>eruv chatzeirot </i>if the landlord's property in the apartments is rented to the tenants. The <i>Devar Avraham </i>(3:30) and Rav Yosef Dov Soloveitchik (cited in <i>Nefesh Harav </i>p. 170) also favor this opinion, although the <i>Devar Avraham </i>concludes that he is unsure of the Halachah in such a case. See <i>The Contemporary Eruv </i>(p. 110 note 231) for a defense of Rav Moshe's view. Rav Hershel Schachter (in a lecture at Yeshiva University) reported that Rav Moshe encouraged those who do make an <i>eruv chatzeirot </i>in such a situation to refrain from reciting a blessing, since he believed that this <i>eruv </i>is unnecessary. The <i>Chelkat Yaakov </i>also argues that the landlord's ability to unite all of the apartments by storing property in all of them only applies to observant Jewish landlords. Regarding non-observant and non-Jewish landlords, he claims that <i>sechirat reshut </i>must be performed even if the landlord stores his personal property in all of the apartments. Other authorities do not appear to accept this qualification.</i> For example, this prohibition applies to an apartment building with at least two observant<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If there are flagrantly non-observant Jews, <i>sechirat reshut </i>must be performed. We will discuss this procedure later in this chapter. The status of non-observant Jews today is somewhat unclear, as most of them desecrate Shabbat out of ignorance, not out of contemptuousness. See Eruvin (69a) and <i>Chazon Ish </i>(O.C. 87:14) for a discussion of this phenomenon.</i> families. In such situations, it is required to make an <i>eruv chatzeirot </i>(referred to by <i>Chazal </i>as an <i>eruv</i>) in order to permit carrying.",
                    "An <i>eruv chatzeirot </i>(literally \"mixing the courtyards\") is consists of every household in the <i>reshut hayachid </i>contributing some bread to the collective group of households. The bread is stored in one of the houses within the encompassed area. The Halachah then views the participants as if they all live in that one house, removing even the rabbinical prohibition against carrying (see Shulchan Aruch, O.C. 366:1).",
                    "The Talmud (Shabbat 14b) records that King Shlomo instituted this requirement, and a heavenly voice acknowledged the profound wisdom in it. The reason for this rule, as explained by the Rambam (<i>Hilchot Eruvin </i>1:4), is that otherwise people would become confused about the laws of carrying. The process of the <i>eruv chatzeirot </i>is designed to familiarize the community with the laws of carrying. This goal seems to be a reason for the time-honored practice of storing the <i>eruv chatzeirot </i>in the synagogue (see Rama, O.C. 366:3). Rav Elazar Meyer Teitz told this author that his father, Rav Pinchas Teitz (of Elizabeth, New Jersey), prominently displayed the <i>eruv </i>in a place within the synagogue where it was easily seen, noting that this was commonly done in Europe. Another advantage of storing the <i>eruv </i>in the synagogue is that community members have full access to the <i>eruv</i>, which is an important requirement (see Rav Moshe Shternbach's <i>Teshuvot Vehanhagot </i>1:250).",
                    "In practice, we do not require every household in a <i>reshut hayachid </i>to give some bread for the purpose of the <i>eruv</i>. Instead, everyone in the community is granted a portion of the <i>eruv </i>by the process known as <i>zachin le'adam shelo befanav</i>, acquiring something on behalf of another person (see Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 366:9-10,15). This is accomplished by one person handing another the <i>eruv </i>food<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The practice is to use a box or two of kosher-for-<i>Pesach matzah</i>; see Rama, O.C. 368:5.</i> and the second person lifting the <i>eruv </i>into the air.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is a dispute regarding whether it must be lifted one <i>tefach </i>(3-4 inches) or 3 <i>tefachim</i>; see Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat 198:2 and Mishnah Berurah 366:51.</i> It is lifted with the intention of acquiring the <i>eruv </i>on behalf of all present and future residents of the area encompassed by the <i>eruv</i>.",
                    "A blessing (\"<i>al mitzvat eruv</i>\") is recited prior to the procedure of acquiring the <i>eruv </i>on behalf of the community.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For an explanation of why a blessing is recited on an <i>eruv chatzeirot</i>, see <i>Teshuvot Chatam Sofer </i>(O.C. 99).</i> Then, the formula of \"<i>behadein eruva</i>\" is recited, explaining the <i>eruv</i>'s intended purpose (see Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 366:15).",
                    "<i><b>Sechirat Reshut</b></i>",
                    "The procedure of <i>eruv chatzeirot </i>is effective solely for Jews who believe in the Oral Law and thus believe in the efficacy of an <i>eruv</i>. However, one must rent the apartments, homes, and common areas (such as streets and parks) from every non-Jewish and non-believing Jewish resident of the <i>reshut hayachid</i>. This procedure is known as <i>sechirat reshut</i>.",
                    "Renting every non-Jewish house within the <i>tzurot hapetach </i>is a virtually impossible task to accomplish in a community <i>eruv</i>. Fortunately, Halachah provides an alternative method of performing the <i>sechirat reshut </i>(see Shulchan Aruch, O.C. 391:1). The Jewish community may rent the entire enclosed area from the head of the city (<i>sar ha'ir</i>) or from one to whom this leader has delegated his authority.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A representative may be used even if this representative knows he is acting against the will of the non-Jewish authority (Shulchan Aruch, O.C. 382:11). The Shulchan Aruch also discusses who qualifies as a representative.</i> The Shulchan Aruch rules that the head of the city has the halachic ability to rent out not just the public property within the <i>tzurot hapetach</i>, but also the homes of its residents. His ability to rent out private homes stems from his right to quarter soldiers and military equipment in those homes during a time of war without consulting the residents.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Biur Halachah (391 s.v. <i>Bameh Devarim Amurim</i>) adds that the leader must also be capable of deciding when to wage war. Otherwise, his power to quarter troops is irrelevant during times of peace.</i> The United States Constitution (Amendment 3) forbids quartering soldiers under most circumstances. Nonetheless, the <i>Tikvat Zechariah </i>(pp. 39-40, cited in <i>The Contemporary Eruv </i>pp. 115-117), discussing the possibility of constructing an <i>eruv </i>in St. Louis in the 1890s, rules that a city government in America does have the right to lease private homes for <i>sechirat reshut</i>. He reasons that local governments may search and inspect private homes, in addition to maintaining the right to expropriate private land for public use (eminent domain).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Hershel Schachter (in a lecture at Yeshiva University) stated that Rav Moshe Feinstein also permitted performing <i>sechirat reshut </i>from a democratically elected mayor based on similar reasoning. See <i>Chazon Ish </i>(O.C. 82:9) for an alternative explanation of why <i>sechirat reshut </i>may be done from democratic governments. Also see <i>Teshuvot Minchat Shlomo </i>(2:35:24), who writes that the <i>sechirat reshut </i>performed today \"merits investigation\" (\"<i>yeish ladun</i>\").</i>",
                    "Others, including Rav Hershel Schachter (in a lecture at Yeshiva University), strongly question this reasoning. They point out that the right of eminent domain is rarely used and is quite difficult to apply. According to their opinion, it is forbidden to carry on Shabbat (even within an <i>eruv</i>) from one's home to the private property of a non-Jew or non-observant Jew.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Netivot Shabbat </i>(36:27). One could question why the presence of privately owned non-Jewish property inside the <i>eruv </i>does not affect the rest of the area. After all, we have already mentioned (regarding a <i>karpeif</i>) that a place where carrying is forbidden also prohibits carrying in the rest of the <i>eruv</i>, unless special <i>tzurot hapetach </i>are erected to separate the forbidden area. While walls enclose the houses themselves, their unenclosed front lawns should invalidate the <i>eruv</i>. See <i>The Contemporary Eruv </i>(p. 115).</i> Nonetheless, they acknowledge that the mayor and police do possess the authority to close the <b>public </b>areas of the city. One should consult his rabbi regarding which opinion to follow.",
                    "The <i>Netivot Shabbat </i>(Chapter 37, note 93) notes that all would agree that the mayor and police cannot rent out a foreign embassy located within a city, as international law recognizes it as sovereign territory of the nation it represents. Thus, it would be forbidden to carry into a foreign embassy even in an area encompassed by an <i>eruv</i>, such as Jerusalem or Washington, on Shabbat.",
                    "It is often unclear who is the appropriate authority to lease the area from (see Mishnah Berurah 391:18). In order to avoid this problem, rabbis usually perform <i>sechirat reshut </i>from a number of local authorities, such as the mayor and the police chief. A particularly interesting situation occurred when Rav Barry Freundel of Congregation Kesher Israel (Washington, D.C.) established an <i>eruv </i>for his community. Due to the ambiguous nature of Washington's municipal authorities, Rav Freundel told this author that he performed <i>sechirat reshut </i>from United States President George Bush<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Of course, had it been difficult to reach the President, <i>sechirat reshut </i>could have been done from a representative of his.</i> and Washington Mayor Marion Berry, along with the heads of the police and city council.",
                    "When expanding a community <i>eruv</i>, care must be taken to ensure that the <i>sechirat reshut </i>includes the expanded areas. In addition, <i>sechirat reshut </i>should not be allowed to expire.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For a discussion of how long a <i>sechirat reshut </i>may last, see the Mishnah Berurah (382:48) and <i>Netivot Shabbat </i>(Chapter 37:28 and note 20).</i> Many authorities require renewing <i>sechirat reshut </i>when the non-Jewish official from whom it was performed leaves his office. The <i>Netivot Shabbat </i>(37:28 and notes 96-99) cites these authorities, but he argues that <i>sechirat reshut </i>remains effective in democracies even when the government changes. He reasons that a newly elected government is bound by agreements made by its predecessors. In practice, Jewish communities today do not renew <i>sechirat reshut </i>every time the town government changes (also see <i>Har Tzvi</i>, Orach Chaim 17).",

The Gemara permits supporting an animal with pillows and blankets if it falls into a water channel on Shabbat. Doing so entails violating a rabbinical prohibition,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Placing a pillow underneath an animal renders the pillow <i>muktzah</i>, as the pillow serves as a base for an animal, and animals are <i>muktzah </i>(<i>basis ledavar ha'asur</i>). Making a non-<i>muktzah </i>item <i>muktzah </i>(<i>mevateil keli meiheichano</i>) is rabbinically prohibited because it resembles <i>soteir</i>, destroying a utensil. In this case, the utensil is not physically destroyed, but it is rendered unusable for the remainder of Shabbat. See Rashi, Shabbat 128b s.v. <i>Veha</i>.</i> yet it is permitted to alleviate an animal's suffering. The biblical imperative to alleviate an animal's pain supersedes the rabbinical prohibition. Similarly, reasons the Maharam of Rothenburg, one may set aside the rabbinical prohibition of <i>amirah lenochri </i>(asking a non-Jew to violate Shabbat) to alleviate the pain of a cow that needs to be milked. The Shulchan Aruch (O.C. 305:20) rules in accordance with the view of the Maharam of Rothenburg.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In practice, some possible restrictions are involved when employing a non-Jew to milk on Shabbat. The <i>Korban Netaneil </i>(Shabbat 18:70), commenting on the Maharam's leniency, lists these restrictions. First, the milk may not be used until the next day, as <i>Chazal </i>forbade using liquids squeezed on Shabbat until after Shabbat ends. (<i>Chazal </i>worried that using freshly squeezed liquids, or juice that leaked from a fruit, would cause people to violate Shabbat by squeezing more; see Beitzah 3a.) Additionally, milk squeezed on Shabbat by a non-Jew must be given to the non-Jew. If the Jewish owner would keep the milk, it would appear as if the non-Jew violated Shabbat for the Jew's <b>personal </b>benefit, whereas we only permit him to violate Shabbat for the <b>animal's </b>sake. If the Jewish owner wants the milk, he must buy it from the non-Jew (although he may pay a heavily discounted price; see Biur Halachah 305 s.v. <i>Bedavar</i>.) While the <i>Korban Netaneil </i>cites all of these restrictions, they are not all universally accepted. See Shulchan Aruch (O.C. 305:20) and the Mishnah Berurah's comments thereupon.</i>",

On the other hand, Rabbeinu Tam (<i>Tosafot </i>s.v. <i>Choleiv</i>) believes that permission to milk onto food applies only on <i>Yom Tov</i>. He notes that milking onto food is permitted because the milk is considered \"food (based on its destination) being removed from food (the cow).\" Only on <i>Yom Tov</i>, however, is the cow considered \"food,\" because only on <i>Yom Tov </i>can an animal be slaughtered and eaten.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even on <i>Yom Tov</i>, there may be a distinction between different types of cows. Clearly, a cow that might be slaughtered and eaten on <i>Yom Tov </i>is considered food.

It certainly does not apply if one squeezes a large volume of milk onto a few crumbs of bread (see <i>Teshuvot Achiezer </i>4:8 and <i>Techumin </i>1:7-8).

The Gemara states that one may carry on Shabbat from a <i>reshut harabim </i>(public domain) to a <i>mekom petur </i>(neutral domain) and from a <i>reshut hayachid </i>(private domain) to a <i>mekom petur</i>, whereas one may not carry from a <i>reshut hayachid </i>to a <i>reshut harabim </i>or vice versa.

Although the milk that flows immediately is not desired, since the person does not wish to violate Shabbat, one fundamentally wants the milking process to occur.

Auerbach suggests that attaching the pipes to the udders is one (permissible) act, and the milk that flows later (after turning on the machine) is something entirely separate. Rav A.D. Auerbach claims that these two steps only become one unit when there is a 50% chance of milk starting to flow as soon as the pipes are attached. If, however, attachment of the pipes does not usually bring out milk, the later milk flow is a separate occurrence. Regarding the minority of cases, when attaching the pipes to the udders immediately squeezes milk, they are a <i>davar she'eino mitkavein</i>, as this flow is unintentional and does not happen inevitably. Rav Lichtenstein reportedly agrees in principle with this approach. In fact, he is even more lenient regarding the odds that milk will flow when the pipes are attached.

He argues that the Mishnah's rule of maintaining the restrictions of the place that one left does not apply to the observance of <i>Yom Tov Sheini</i> by visitors to Israel. He explains that <i>Yom Tov Sheini </i>differs from regular customs, which theoretically apply anywhere, because it is geographically linked to the Diaspora. While the <b>residents </b>of a particular community normally develop its customs, <i>Yom Tov Sheini</i> was instituted for the <b>physical area</b> of the Diaspora. However, when one is in Israel, he is in a place where <i>Yom Tov Sheini</i> has no meaning, regardless of where he normally resides. Only other customs, which could theoretically exist even where they are not practiced, is it reasonable for someone who always did them in his own community to observe them while visiting elsewhere.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For example, the Mishnah (Pesachim 50a-b) addresses the custom of not doing work on <i>Erev Pesach</i>. This custom only developed in certain communities, but it is theoretically reasonable to observe such a custom in any geographic location. Accordingly, it is by no means absurd to obligate someone whose community refrains from work on <i>Erev Pesach</i> to even refrain from it when visiting a community which does not share his custom. On the other hand, <i>Yom Tov Sheini</i> is only a logical custom for communities in the Diaspora.</i> According to the <i>Chacham Tzvi</i>, a visitor in Israel is prohibited from observing <i>Yom Tov Sheini</i>, lest he violate the prohibition of <i>bal tosif </i>(adding to the Torah's precepts). Although the <i>Chacham Tzvi</i> is definitely the minority view on this issue, his position has attracted some support from other authorities (<i>Shulchan Aruch Harav</i> 496:11 and <i>Teshuvot Sho'eil Umeishiv </i>3:2:28). According to this view, it follows that an Israeli visitor to the Diaspora should fully observe <i>Yom Tov Sheini,</i> as one's permanent place of residence is irrelevant.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Regarding the general issue of <i>Yom Tov Sheini</i> for Israeli visitors to the Diaspora, see Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chaim 496:3) and <i>Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer</i> (9:30).</i>",

For example, by treating the day as <i>Yom Tov</i>, men would not perform the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>tefilin</i>. In addition, reciting the holiday prayers would mean losing the opportunity to recite weekday prayers. It is thus essential for these authorities to decide which view they fundamentally accept, despite the fact that they recommend adhering to certain stringent practices of the opposing view. By deciding in favor of the <i>Chacham Tzvi</i>, they are only able to accept stringent practices from Rav Karo's view when those practices do not detract from the <i>mitzvot</i> of a weekday (such as donning <i>tefilin </i>and reciting weekday prayers).</i> In principle, they accept the view of the <i>Chacham Tzvi</i>, ruling that men should don <i>tefilin </i>and all should recite weekday prayers. However, they add that one should refrain from forbidden acts on <i>Yom Tov Sheini</i> in deference to the view of Rav Yosef Karo. Rav Yechiel Michel Tukachinsky (<i>Ir Hakodesh V'hamikdash </i>19:11) records that Rav Shmuel Salant adopted such an approach. Similarly, Rav Aharon Lichtenstein recounts that when Rav Yosef Dov Soloveitchik visited Israel in 1935, he stayed there during <i>Shavuot</i>. He asked his eminent father, Rav Moshe Soloveitchik, what to do for <i>Yom Tov Sheini</i>.

                "One of the more interesting halachic questions relating to <i>Purim </i>is the propriety of a woman reading <i>Megillat Esther</i>.

Thus, a woman cannot blow the <i>shofar </i>on behalf of a man, for she is not obligated to blow the <i>shofar</i>. Moreover, the Gemara (Berachot 20b) explains that the level of obligation of the one performing the <i>mitzvah </i>must equal that of the individuals whom he wishes to discharge. For example, the Gemara discusses whether a woman is obligated to recite <i>birkat hamazon </i>(grace after meals) on a biblical or rabbinical level. It explains that only if a woman is obligated in <i>birkat hamazon </i>on the same level as a man can she recite it on his behalf.",
                "Accordingly, the question of whether a woman can read the Megillah on behalf of a man depends upon whether they share the same level of obligation. The Gemara (Megillah 4a; also see Arachin 3a) seems to clearly obligate women to read the Megillah on the same level as men, as it states, \"Women are obligated in the reading of the Megillah, because they also were involved in the miracle [of <i>Purim</i>].\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1 </sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Rashi and <i>Tosafot </i>for different explanations of the women's involvement in the miracle.</i>",

We will summarize the creative suggestions of some <i>Acharonim</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7 </sup><i class=\"footnote\">We have only cited some of the better known explanations of the <i>Behag'</i>s view. Additional explanations appear in Rav Yosef Dov Soloveitchik's <i>Reshimot Shiurim </i>to Sukkah (compiled by Rav Hershel Reichman), p. 184, and in the <i>Marcheshet </i>(22).</i>The <i>Marcheshet </i>(22) writes that according to the <i>Behag, Megillah </i>reading for men has two aspects: <b>hearing </b>the Megillah to publicize the miracle of <i>Purim </i>(<i>pirsumei nisa</i>), and remembering the wicked actions of <i>Amaleik</i>. The <i>Marcheshet </i>posits that the <i>Behag </i>exempts women from the <i>mitzvah </i>of remembering <i>Amaleik </i>(like the opinion of the <i>Sefer Hachinuch </i>603). Hence, women have only one aspect in their obligation to read Megillah - hearing the Megillah for <i>pirsumei nisa</i>. They cannot read the Megillah on behalf of men, who have the added dimension of remembering <i>Amaleik</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Marcheshet </i>permits women to read the Megillah at night even for men, arguing that war is not practiced at night. Since the men's added dimension of obligation is to remember and wage war against <i>Amaleik</i>, and this dimension is irrelevant at night, women are thus obligated on the same level as men at night. There is no hint of this distinction between day and night anywhere in the <i>Behag</i>, Shulchan Aruch, or any of the later prominent authorities (such as the Mishnah Berurah and <i>Aruch Hashulchan</i>). It would thus appear, even at night, that a woman should not read the Megillah for men in practice.

He notes that the need to write down the Megillah stems from God's commandment to Moshe to commemorate the heinous attack of <i>Amaleik </i>in <b>writing </b>(Shemot 17:14). The <i>Purim </i>miracle can be recounted orally for <i>pirsumei nisa</i>, but written commemoration of <i>Amaleik </i>necessitates reading out of a scroll. Accordingly, women, who are merely obligated to orally recount the miracle, cannot discharge men of their obligation to read out of a Megillah scroll and commemorate <i>Amaleik </i>in writing. The <i>Or Samei'ach </i>thus explains the <i>Behag</i>'s intention in writing that men are obligated to read the Megillah, while women are only obligated to hear the Megillah.",

He suggests, however, that this distinction exists even assuming that women, too, are required to remember <i>Amaleik </i>(see <i>Minchat Chinuch </i>689). The <i>Avnei Neizer </i>explains that women must remember <i>Amaleik </i>in a general sense. However, the rabbinical enactment to remember <i>Amaleik </i>specifically by reading the Megillah on <i>Purim </i>does not apply to women, as they are not obligated in time-bound <i>mitzvot</i>. They must <b>hear </b>the Megillah due to their involvement in the miracle, but actively <b>reading </b>(as men must do) is a separate time-bound obligation.

For an analysis of whether women can be part of the group of ten to read the Megillah, see this author's essay in <i>Beit Yitzchak </i>(22:301-304).</i>The presence of a <i>minyan </i>is very significant in light of the Rama's ruling (O.C. 692:1) that the blessing recited at the conclusion of Megillah reading, \"<i>harav et riveinu</i>,\" is only recited in the presence of a <i>minyan</i>. While the Biur Halachah mentions that some authorities disagree with the Rama, the Biur Halachah himself concludes that the Rama's ruling should be followed. A women's Megillah reading likely loses the opportunity to recite this blessing.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11 </sup><i class=\"footnote\">We have written that it is \"likely\" lost, as one could theoretically argue in favor of combining two minority opinions to permit reciting this blessing in the presence of ten women. The opinions are those who disagree with the requirement of a <i>minyan </i>for <i>harav et riveinu </i>and those who permit counting women in a <i>minyan </i>for Megillah reading. Regarding the ability to recite a blessing when a double doubt (<i>safeik s'feika</i>) exists, see the sources cited by Rav Ovadia Yosef (<i>Taharat Habayit</i>, vol. 2, p. 486). It should also be noted that we have based ourselves on the opinion of the Rama, whose rulings are authoritative for Ashkenazic Jewry. For Sephardic women, Rav Moshe Harari (<i>Mikra'ei Kodesh</i>, <i>Hil. Purim </i>6, footnote 39) reports that Rav Mordechai Eliyahu does not permit reciting this blessing without ten men present, while Rav Ovadia Yosef permits its recital, provided that there are ten women present. For greater elaboration on Rav Ovadia's view, see the fifth volume of <i>Yalkut Yosef </i>(<i>Dinei Kri'at Hamegillah </i>7 and <i>Hilchot Mikra Megillah </i>39).</i>Interestingly, the <i>Aruch Hashulchan </i>does not cite this as a reason that women should not read the Megillah themselves.",
                "Aside from the specific benefit of reciting \"<i>harav et riveinu</i>,\" the Shulchan Aruch (O.C. 690:18) writes that one must \"pursue a <i>minyan</i>\" for reading the Megillah, because reading the Megillah with a <i>minyan </i>is considered qualitatively better. Furthermore, it is generally preferable to read the Megillah in a larger group (<i>berov am hadrat melech; </i>see Magen Avraham 689:10). Additional Megillah readings of any kind detract from this ideal. Of course, practical considerations must always be weighed against this preference. Clearly, if a communal Megillah reading is getting so large that people must struggle to properly hear the Megillah, it is proper to have more than one reading.",
                "An additional problem arises with certain women hearing the Megillah from another woman. The Mishnah Berurah (689:15) notes that some authorities do not permit anyone to read the Megillah for others without either a <i>minyan </i>present (as is the case in most communal Megillah readings) or in a situation where the listener does not know how to read the Megillah himself. The Shulchan Aruch (O.C. 689:5) adopts this position, and the Mishnah Berurah appears to favor it, too. Women's readings generally do not have a <i>minyan </i>present, so these authorities would likely not permit a woman to read the Megillah for women who can read it themselves.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We have not stated the application to women's readings in an absolute manner, as it is predicated upon the assumption that ten women do not constitute a <i>minyan </i>for Megillah reading. As we have indicated above, however, this is not entirely clear. In fact, Rav Moshe Harari (<i>Mikra'ei Kodesh</i>, <i>Hil. Purim </i>6, footnote 39) implies that Rav Ovadia Yosef, who considers ten women a <i>minyan </i>for reciting \"<i>harav et riveinu</i>,\" would permit reading the Megillah for a group of ten or more people, regardless of gender, even if some of them could read the Megillah themselves. Rav Harari adds that those who reject Rav Ovadia's opinion regarding \"<i>harav et riveinu</i>\" (such as Rav Mordechai Eliyahu) would presumably reject it here, too.</i>",
                "Another relevant factor is the possible inability of women to read the Megillah for others once they have fulfilled their own obligation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A man who has already heard the Megillah may read it again for others because of the principle of <i>arvut </i>(Berachot 20b). This principle states that every Jew is responsible to ensure that all other Jews fulfill <i>mitzvot. </i>Accordingly, even one who has already performed a <i>mitzvah </i>himself (such as <i>kiddush </i>or Megillah reading) may do it again for another Jew's benefit. There is some dispute regarding the applicability of <i>arvut </i>to women, which is why the Biur Halachah does not permit a woman to reread the Megillah for others. For greater discussion of the applicability of <i>arvut </i>to women, see <i>Dagul Meirvavah </i>(O.C. 271), Rav Akiva Eiger's gloss to the Shulchan Aruch (O.C. 271, commenting on Magen Avraham 271:2), and <i>Nishmat Avraham </i>(1:9-10).</i> The Biur Halachah (689 s.v. <i>Venashim</i>) prohibits a woman who has already heard the Megillah to reread it for other women. Rav Moshe Feinstein<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Teshuvot Igrot Moshe </i>(O.C. 1:190). Also see Rav Moshe Harari's <i>Mikra'ei Kodesh </i>(<i>Hilchot Purim </i>6:8). It is somewhat surprising that Rav Moshe Feinstein does not mention the Biur Halachah's opinion, nor does the Biur Halachah refer to the comments of the <i>Dagul Meirvavah </i>and Rav Akvia Eiger, which we cited in the previous footnote.</i> permits such a reading, but he does not permit the reader to recite the blessings for the Megillah reading. According to his opinion, the listener should recite the blessings if the reader has already fulfilled her own obligation.",
                "Finally, the question of deviation from established practice must be considered. Rav Hershel Schachter (<i>Nefesh Harav</i>, p. 145) cites Rav Yosef Dov Soloveitchik's opposition to women reading the Megillah for other women in a synagogue, out of concern for deviating from established synagogue protocol and practice. Rav Soloveitchik's grandson, Rav Mayer Twersky (<i>Tradition </i>32:3:13), reports that the Rav was also concerned with the opinion of the Magen Avraham (cited earlier) that women may not even read the Megillah for themselves.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15 </sup><i class=\"footnote\">Regarding the Rav's approach towards women's Megillah readings, Rav J.J. Schachter (<i>The Torah U-Madda Journal </i>8:261) writes, \"[Initially,] his answer was a one word 'No'…. We proceeded to engage in a discussion of the issue, the Rav marshalling arguments explaining his position and I arguing with each of them, one by one…. Finally… he said, 'Schechter, if you want, I can give you a <i>heter</i>, but you shouldn't do it.'\"</i>",
                "<i><b>Conclusion </b></i>",
                "It seems clear that it is halachically inappropriate for women to read the Megillah for men, as many <i>Rishonim </i>agree with the <i>Behag</i>, and the Rama rules in accordance with him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16 </sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is certainly true for Ashkenazic women, as Ashkenazic Jews follow the Rama's rulings. Regarding Sephardic women reading the Megillah for men, see <i>Yalkut Yosef </i>(vol. 5, <i>Dinei Kri'at Hamegillah </i>12).</i>The issue of women reading the Megillah for other women seems to be unresolved. Rav Yehuda Henkin (<i>Bnei Banim </i>2:10) permits women to read the Megillah for other women.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17 </sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Henkin elsewhere affirms that he even permits women's readings when <i>Purim </i>falls out on Shabbat in Jerusalem, and the Megillah is read on Friday (<i>Bnei Banim </i>3:7). By contrast, Rav Aharon Lichtenstein (quoted in <i>Tradition </i>32:2:105) reportedly rules in such a year that women's readings should not be conducted in Jerusalem, as a <i>minyan </i>is required when the Megillah is not read on its proper date, and it is questionable if ten women qualify as a <i>minyan</i>.</i>This view has also been attributed to Rav Aharon Lichtenstein (cited in <i>Tradition </i>32:2:104-105). On the other hand, Rav Hershel Schachter (<i>Be'ikvei Hatzon </i>5:1,4,5), Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, Rav Mordechai Eliyahu, Rav Avraham Shapira (all cited in <i>Tradition </i>32:2:106-107), and Rav Mordechai Willig (in a public address delivered in Teaneck, New Jersey) oppose such readings.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18 </sup><i class=\"footnote\">Those whom we have cited as opposing public women's Megillah readings may differ regarding a woman reading the Megillah privately for herself or another woman. Rav Mordechai Eliyahu (cited in Rav Moshe Harari's <i>Mikra'ei Kodesh</i>, <i>Hil. Purim </i>6:8 and note 29) permits a woman to read the Megillah in private <i>lechatchilah </i>(even without extenuating circumstances), despite objecting to women reading publicly even <i>bedieved </i>(explained by Rav Harari that a woman who attended a women's public Megillah reading must reread the Megillah without reciting its blessings).

The Rama, (<i>Darchei Moshe</i> 453:2) however, writes that Ashkenazic Jews have adopted the strict practice of not eating <i>kitniyot</i> on <i>Pesach</i>. Similarly, in his gloss to the Shulchan Aruch, he rules that Ashkenazic Jewry must not deviate from this custom. The Vilna Gaon notes that a source for this stringency appears the Gemara (Pesachim 40b), which records that Rava forbade servants who were not halachically scrupulous to make bread from legumes on <i>Pesach</i> (see <i>Tosafot </i>s.v. Rava and the Rosh 2:28).",

                    "<b><i>Rav Ovadia Yosef's Responsum</i></b>",
                    "Rav Ovadia Yosef (<i>Teshuvot Yechaveh Da'at</i> 5:32) rules that an Ashkenazic Jew may eat non-<i>kitniyot</i> food at a Sephardic Jew's home on <i>Pesach</i>. He does not require special utensils that have not been used for <i>kitniyot</i> for the Ashkenazic guest. He bases his opinion on a similar ruling of the Rama (Orach Chaim 453:1): \"It is obvious that if <i>kitniyot</i> fell into food during <i>Pesach</i>, they do not render the food forbidden <i>b'dieved </i>(<i>post facto</i>).\"",
                    "Accordingly, Rav Ovadia argues the following:",
                    "It is clear that the food particles of <i>kitniyot</i> absorbed into pots in Sephardic homes that are released into non-<i>kitniyot</i> food do not forbid the food to Ashkenazim. Even if the utensils have been used within the past twenty-four hours (and are thus emitting a good taste), it is still permissible for Ashkenazim to eat from them, <b>because there is surely more permissible food than there are </b><b><i>kitniyot</i></b><b> that emerge from the walls of the pot.</b>",
                    "<b><i>Precedents for Rav Ovadia's Ruling</i></b>",
                    "Rav Ovadia cites several interesting precedents for his ruling. The first is a responsum of the Rama (132:15) regarding those who are strict about the issue of <i>chadash</i> (the prohibition against eating grain sown after <i>Pesach</i>, before the following year's sixteenth of Nissan) in the Diaspora. Just as most observant Diaspora Jews today are lenient in this area, most observant Jews in pre-war Europe were lenient (see Mishnah Berurah 489:45). The Rama writes that those who adopt the strict position regarding <i>chadash</i> may nonetheless eat food that absorbed flavor from the utensils of those who are lenient about <i>chadash</i>. He reasons that, in his community, even those who are strict only treat <i>chadash </i>as a doubtful rabbinical prohibition<i> </i>(as opposed to the many authorities who consider <i>chadash</i> to be an absolute biblical prohibition even in the Diaspora). The Rama thus claims that the light nature of <i>chadash</i> facilitates eating food that may have absorbed its flavor from pots. The flavor of the <i>chadash</i> is nullified (<i>bateil berov</i>) by the non-<i>chadash</i> food. ",
                    "Rav Ovadia equates <i>kitniyot</i> to the Rama's case of <i>chadash</i>. <i>Kitniyot</i> are also an unusually light prohibition, so one may be lenient regarding the flavor in pots that cooked <i>kitniyot.</i>",
                    "A second precedent cited by Rav Ovadia is a ruling of the Radbaz (<i>Teshuvot</i> 4:496). His responsum discusses whether those who did not rely on a particular <i>shochet </i>may eat food cooked by those who did rely on him. The Radbaz rules leniently because he claims that the <i>shochet</i> in question was probably acceptable. Even those who do not rely on him for their actual meat could at least eat food cooked in utensils that absorbed the flavor of his meat. Again, writes Rav Ovadia, we see that certain prohibitions are treated unusually lightly, so their flavor is permitted. <i>Kitniyot</i>, a mere custom of Ashkenazic Jewry, should also be treated this way.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Radbaz also mentions other factors in his lenient ruling, which run counter to normative practice today. Nevertheless, Rav Ovadia claims that <i>kitniyot</i> are a lighter prohibition than the meat which the Radbaz addresses, so the flavor of <i>kitniyot</i> is permitted even without the additional factors utilized by the Radbaz.</i>",
                    "Rav Ovadia's third precedent is an important ruling of the Rama in his gloss to the Shulchan Aruch (Y.D. 64:9). The Rama addresses a type of fat whose permissibility depended upon varying customs among Ashkenazic communities of his time. He permits members of the communities that abide by the strict view to eat food cooked in utensils of people in the lenient communities. The Rama reasons that the lenient communities were following a legitimate ruling of their halachic authorities. Even one who was strict about the actual fat did not need be strict about its flavor, because there is a valid opinion that permits the flavor.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This leniency is quite surprising, as those who prohibit the fat in question treat it as a biblical prohibition. Accordingly, even if they think that the biblical prohibition is somewhat debatable (in deference to the lenient view), they should not go so far as to permit the fat's flavor. (Flavor is ordinarily prohibited on a biblical level as long as one can detect it in the food; see Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 98:2; Shach, Y.D. 98:7; and Biur Hagra, Y.D. 98:10.) Rav Ovadia cites several authorities who address this problem. They explain that not only is the fat's prohibition doubtful (<i>safeik</i>), as there are those who permit it, but there is also another doubt involved (<i>safeik s'feika</i>). Flavor must enhance another food in order to prohibit it, and it is always doubtful if the flavor emerging from the utensils impacts positively or negatively on the food absorbing it. See <i>Tosafot </i>(Avodah Zarah 38b s.v. <i>Iy</i>), Rosh (Avodah Zarah 2:35), <i>Teshuvot Harashba</i> (497), and <i>Sefer Issur V'heter </i>(33:10). All of these <i>Rishonim </i>assert that it is always a <i>safeik</i> whether the flavor emerging from a pot imparts a good taste. Between these two doubts, the Rama believes that one may eat food that was cooked in the same pot that was used to cook the questionable fat. Similar doubt about the flavor’s impact might also explain the other lenient precedents that Rav Ovadia cites. Otherwise, it remains unclear why flavor is nullified so easily.</i>",
                    "From all of the above precedents, Rav Ovadia concludes that there are certain light prohibitions where flavor is nullified when mixed with permissible food, and he asserts that <i>kitniyot</i> are one such prohibition.",
                    "<b><i>Other Authorities</i></b>",
                    "As was noted at the beginning of the chapter, the Rama (O.C. 453:1) writes that there need not be a 60:1 ratio of non-<i>kitniyot</i> to <i>kitniyot</i> in order to nullify any <i>kitniyot</i> that might have fallen into a pot of food. Rather, as long as a majority of non-<i>kitniyot </i>exists, one has not violated the <i>minhag </i>of not eating <i>kitniyot</i>. Later authorities appear to accept this view, including the <i>Eliah Rabbah </i>(453:4), Shulchan Aruch <i>Harav </i>(O.C. 453:5), <i>Chok Yaakov </i>(453:5), <i>Chayei Adam </i>(127:1), and Mishnah Berurah (453:9). The <i>Chok Yaakov </i>explains that, although it appears from the <i>Terumat Hadeshen </i>that a 60:1 ratio is necessary to nullify the <i>kitniyot</i>, the Halachah follows the Rama, who states that only a majority of the food must not be <i>kitniyot</i>. The reason for this Halachah is that refraining from <i>kitniyot</i> is merely a custom, so it is not treated with the same severity as biblical and rabbinical laws.",
                    "The flavor of food is no stricter than the food itself. Accordingly, if the aforementioned authorities rule that the non-<i>kitniyot</i> majority nullifies a minority of actual <i>kitniyot </i>food, undoubtedly they agree that the non-<i>kitniyot</i> food cooked in the pot nullifies the flavor of <i>kitniyot </i>that emerges from the pot.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this case, it might suffice to ascertain that the food's volume is greater than that of the absorbed flavor, while the thickness of the walls containing the flavor might not matter (see the Radbaz's responsum cited above).</i> Indeed, the <i>Zera Emet</i> (vol. 3, O.C. 48) rules that the <i>minhag</i> to refrain from <i>kitniyot</i> does not include refraining from their flavor. Rav Ovadia thus notes that all of these Ashkenazic authorities agree with his ruling and permit an Ashkenazic Jew to eat food cooked in a Sephardic Jew's dishes on <i>Pesach</i>.",
                    "<b><i>Limitations</i></b>",
                    "When discussing pots in which <i>kitniyot</i> were cooked, the distinction between <i>lechatchilah</i> (<i>ab initio</i>, before the occurrence) and <i>b'dieved </i>(<i>post facto</i>, after the occurrence) must be stressed. The above-cited lenient rulings only permit a <i>b'dieved</i> situation, when food was <b>already</b> cooked in a pot that previously cooked <i>kitniyot</i>. However, Rav Ovadia Yosef (<i>Teshuvot Yechaveh Daat </i>1:9) and Rav Yehoshua Neuwirth (<i>Shemirat Shabbat Kehilchatah</i> 40:80) rule that an Ashkenazic Jew who must cook <i>kitniyot</i> on <i>Pesach</i> (such as for a sick person) may not <b><i>lechatchilah </i></b>cook non-<i>kitniyot</i> food for healthy Ashkenazic Jews in the same pot. Similarly, Rav Efraim Greenblatt told this author that an Ashkenazic Jew who wishes to visit a Sephardic home on <i>Pesach </i>should arrange for food that was not cooked in a pot that previously cooked <i>kitniyot</i>.",
                    "Beyond the custom of <i>kitniyot</i>, some Ashkenazic Jews altogether avoid eating at other people's homes during <i>Pesach</i>. Their concern is that different people observe divergent practices and customs regarding <i>Pesach</i>, so the guests might not be permitted to eat from the food cooked in the utensils of their hosts. Rav Elazar Meyer Teitz told this author that Rav Michel Feinstein told him that he heard a story about this practice involving Rav Chaim Soloveitchik and the <i>Chafetz Chaim</i>. Rav Chaim visited the <i>Chafetz Chaim</i> on <i>Pesach</i>, and the <i>Chafetz Chaim</i>, who was known for his warm hospitality, did not even offer his guest a cup of tea, due to this practice. Apparently, this stringency was very common in many European circles.",

                    "If an Ashkenazic Jew finds himself in a Sephardic Jew's home on <i>Pesach</i>, he may eat food that was already cooked in pots that previously cooked <i>kitniyot</i>. However, an Ashkenazic Jew may not cook food for himself on dishes that were used to cook <i>kitniyot</i>. If an Ashkenazic Jew plans in advance to visit a Sephardic Jew on <i>Pesach</i>, Rav Ovadia Yosef indicates that he permits the Sephardic Jew to cook in his own pots for the visitor, while Rav Efraim Greenblatt requires the host and visitors to make alternative arrangements. In addition, some Ashkenazic Jews have the custom of not eating anything outside their own homes on <i>Pesach</i>."

The Torah forbids owning <i>chametz</i>, and the Halachah follows the majority view in the Talmud, forbidding any benefit from <i>chametz</i>.

                    "In the year 5669 (1909), a great controversy erupted between Rav Avraham Yitzchak Kook and the Jerusalem Badatz regarding the permissibility of sesame seed oil on <i>Pesach</i>. Rav Kook published a short work (summarized in <i>Yesodei Yeshurun</i> 6:424 and <i>Hamo'adim Bahalachah</i>, p.259) outlining why he permitted this item for <i>Pesach</i> consumption. Although sesame seeds are <i>kitniyot</i>, he notes that their form has changed into oil. No oil can ever become <i>chametz</i> even if it contacts water, so the <i>minhag</i> to avoid <i>kitniyot</i> does not include sesame seed oil. Similarly, the concern of confusing <i>kitniyot</i> with grain does not apply once the sesame seeds are no longer in grain form. Furthermore, Rav Kook addresses sesame seeds that were watched to ensure that they would not be exposed to water. The machine producing the oil needed to be completely dry in order to function, further ensuring that there was no concern for <i>chametz</i>. Finally, the sesame seeds in question were cooked during their processing, and once something is cooked, it can no longer become <i>chametz</i>. Thus, the sesame seed oil in question was so far removed from concern of <i>chametz </i>that, according to Rav Kook, the <i>minhag</i> of <i>kitniyot</i> did not apply to it. ",
                    "The Jerusalem Badatz strongly rejected Rav Kook's lenient ruling. They argued that the Rama (Orach Chaim 453:1) clearly includes oils derived from <i>kitniyot</i> in the custom of avoiding <i>kitniyot</i>, as noted by the <i>Chayei Adam</i> (<i>Nishmat Adam</i> 33).",
                    "Rav Kook responded that the Rama only intends to prohibit oil from <i>kitniyot</i> that were not carefully inspected for other grains or oil from <i>kitniyot</i> that were not already cooked or boiled. Several of his contemporaries accepted Rav Kook's understanding of the Rama and his subsequent ruling, including the Maharsham (<i>Teshuvot</i> 1:183), the <i>Marcheshet</i> (Chapter 3), and Rav Yitzchak Elchanan Spektor (<i>Teshuvot Be'er Yitzchak</i>, Orach Chaim 11).",
                    "Despite the cogency of Rav Kook's arguments and the many great authorities that support it, common practice is to prohibit oil made from <i>kitniyot</i>. For example, Coca-Cola changes its formula from corn syrup to sugar for its kosher-for-<i>Pesach</i> colas. In spite of our stringency, some authorities do permit oil of products whose <i>kitniyot</i> status is questionable, such as peanut oil (Rav Tzvi Pesach Frank's <i>Mikra'ei Kodesh </i>p.205-206 and <i>Teshuvot Chelkat Yaakov </i>1:97).",
