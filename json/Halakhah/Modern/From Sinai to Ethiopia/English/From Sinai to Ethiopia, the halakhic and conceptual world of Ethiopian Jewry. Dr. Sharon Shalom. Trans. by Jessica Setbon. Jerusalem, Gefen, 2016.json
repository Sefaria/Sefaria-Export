        "Foreword by Rabbi Dr Daniel Sperber": [
            "The Sages and scholars of the past insisted on the supreme importance of the continuity of tradition. Among other support, they based their opinion on the verse in Proverbs 1:8, “Hear, my son, the instruction of your father, and do not foresake the Torah of your mother.” During the Middle Ages, they formulated a saying that became well known and widespread in halakhic literature: “Jewish tradition is Torah.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rishba (Rabbi Shlomo Aderet, 1235–1310), commenting on Ramban (Nahmanides), par. 260, Rabbi Yitzhak son of Rabbi Yehuda, <i>Shibbolei ha-leket ha-shalom</i>, par. 271:129b. See explanation in my book <i>Minhagei Yisrael</i> [Jewish customs], vol. 1 (Jerusalem, 5749/1989), 235–37.</i> Scholars have determined that we must not change the melodies of the prayers or the Torah reading,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See, for example, in <i>Sefer hassidim</i>, ed. J. Wistinietski, par. 8:17, and <i>Minhagei Yisrael</i>, vol. 2 (Jerusalem, 5755/1995), chapter 9, 264–65.</i> or even the accent and pronunciation of Hebrew in the prayers and Torah reading that we have received from our ancestors.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shu”t har Zvi</i>, <i>Orah Haim</i>, par. 4; <i>Mishpatei Uziel</i>, <i>Orah Haim</i>, par. 1; <i>Shulhan Arukh ha-Rav</i>, <i>Orah Haim</i> 128:45; <i>Birkhei Yosef</i>, <i>Orah Haim</i> 53:5; <i>Nohag ke-tzon Yosef</i> 68; <i>Shu”t yabia omer</i>, vol. 6, <i>Orah Haim</i>, 11:33–39.</i> This principle also applies to varying methods of interpreting and deriving halakhah. Each individual should uphold the law of his community – whether it be Ashkenazic, Sephardic, Edot ha-Mizrach, or other.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See, for example, Rabbi Yehuda Zarhia Halevy Segal, “Birurim be-gidrei minhagei ha-edot ha-shonot” [Explorations of the boundaries of customs of various communities], <i>Ha-Torah ve-ha-medinah</i> 11–13 (5720–22/1960–62): 268–407.</i>",
            "At the same time, if a person moves from a place where the residents followed a certain custom to a place where the residents follow a different custom, and he intends to settle in the new place permanently, then “He is subject to the rigor of the custom, either of the place he came from or of that to which he went. Thus it is always proper not to act differently from the established customs of a place, on account of the disputes to which such conduct may lead” (Mishnah, <i>Pesahim</i> 4:1). In other words, there are circumstances in which a person strays from the tradition of his forebears to a certain extent, and takes upon himself another custom.",
            "But what about an entire community that moved from one place to another, and which has its own ancient tradition based on biblical verses, which developed and was apparently fixed before the period of the Sages and their halakhic interpretations? Must they completely neglect the tradition of dozens of generations and thousands of years? Or may we adopt the Sages’ saying: “In the town of Rabbi Yose ha-Gelili, they ate chicken with milk” (Babylonian Talmud, <i>Hullin</i> 116a)? Is the rule applying to an entire community that was cut off from its origin similar to the rule for an individual who moves from one place to another?",
            "Such weighty questions have been widely discussed in the halakhic literature, particularly during the periods of expulsion and migration of populations, such as the exile from Spain and in recent generations after the Holocaust, and, at the other end of the spectrum, after the public miracle of the ingathering of the exiles to our Holy Land.",
            "These questions become even more complex when we refer to the sudden uprooting of an entire community with a unique culture, character, and skin color that is completely different from what was accepted previously in Israel. Despite the great variety in our state, and the obvious difficulties of adaptation to a way of life so vastly different from what the community knew in the past, how can we expect it to change its cultural and religious skin overnight, or even in a year or two, and become similar to its brethren? And to which brethren should it become similar – Ashkenazic Jews, Sephardic Jews, or Jews from Edot ha-Mizrach (Eastern communities)? How can the elders of the community, both fathers and mothers, accept with equanimity when their sons and daughters abandon the ways of their ancestors? What will be the fate of these torn and shattered families, and what will be the social, emotional, and spiritual results of such a scenario?",
            "The multifaceted halakhic aspects of these questions are related to halakhic policy and the method of practical halakhic decision making. Is unity equivalent to uniformity, or does it mean mutual responsibility that tolerates the concept of <i>nehara nehara u-fashtei</i> (“Every river has its own course” – Babylonian Talmud, <i>Hullin</i> 18b; 57a)? What is more, are we able to and is it appropriate for us to act with such “liberal tolerance” regarding issues that are biblically prohibited,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Compare, for example, the various opinions on <i>helev ha-kesalim</i> (fat on the upper pelvis of an animal) given in Tur and Beit Yosef on <i>Yoreh De’ah</i>, par. 64.</i> when some of these are agreed upon by all other Jewish communities?",
            "Clearly, then, we must differentiate between biblical law, rabbinic law, and community tradition. Perhaps we should also distinguish between halakhic rulings for individuals and rulings for the public. Similarly, we might also consider the consequences of the attempt to impose far-reaching changes on the communal and familial fabric. Some of the necessary halakhic discussions are fundamental, while others address details, but these categories combine into one under the general rubric of halakhic policy.",
            "For this reason, Rabbi Sharon Shalom – a member of the Ethiopian community who has rabbinic ordination and also serves as a rabbi in practice – has made a positive contribution in taking on the weighty task of offering his community a guide to halakhah, a kind of <i>Kitzur Shulhan Arukh</i> for the Ethiopian community. He has done this out of a deep understanding of the needs of the community, its distresses and cries for relief, and in light of sensitivities that we, members of other communities, are not necessarily aware of and do not feel. Toward this purpose, he has labored at this holy project, researching and interpreting halakhah, customs, and traditions according to the elders of his Beta Israel community and his own ancestors, and comparing them to the <i>halakhot</i> and customs practiced among the majority of Jewry. He proposes methods of contending with these issues and appropriate halakhic decisions for each detail.",
            "Rabbi Shalom is deeply aware of the process experienced by the youth of the community as they are educated in Israeli institutions. They naturally accept the practices of these institutions and of their comrades, and are gradually being integrated into general Israeli society, particularly during service in the Israel Defense Forces. Awareness of this process has led Rabbi Shalom to distinguish between generations, between parents and children – in other words, between the present period and the more distant future, and he has differentiated between them in his suggestions for halakhic decisions.",
            "In writing this book, Rabbi Shalom has performed a labor of sanctity. He presents it to his community clearly and discerningly, out of involvement and a sense of responsibility, along with understanding of the need for unification with the rest of the Jewish people. Undoubtedly, there will be those who will question his halakhic decisions, details as well as principles. The book may invite illuminating and significant comments that will pave the way for additional discussion. Perhaps this is but the beginning of the path, and not its end. New editions of the book will address additional issues, and even mandate changes in halakhic understanding and decision making. I believe that those who are truly committed to the preservation of tradition but are also aware of the necessity of social and religious integration of the various Jewish communities, those who are disturbed at communal differences in all their manifestations, will benefit by studying this book in depth and by recognizing its wisdom and utility.",
            "On a personal level, I take pride in this work of Rabbi Shalom, my former student, and pride in the small part I played in this significant project. I pray that his efforts will lead to no error, and that his work will lead to a strengthening of love for Torah and observance of the mitzvot, and to love for fellow human beings, as <i>kol Yisrael arevim zeh la-zeh</i> (“all Jews are responsible for each other”).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Babylonian Talmud, <i>Shevuot</i> 39a.</i> If even a small portion of this is fulfilled, we will have earned our reward."
        ],
        "Foreword by Rabbi Dr Yehuda Brandes": [
            "We accept the halakhic decision of the Ridvaz<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Yaakov Dovid Wilovsky (1845–1913), responsa, part 7, par. 5.</i> that the Beta Israel community of Ethiopia are Jews in the full sense of the word.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Without addressing the question of the community’s history, as per the halakhic decisions of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef (former Sephardi chief rabbi of Israel) and Rabbi Shlomo Goren (former Ashkenazi chief rabbi of Israel). According to Rabbi Avraham Shapira, <i>ztz”l</i>: “The decision of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel does not rely on articles or research studies, even religious or rabbinic ones, but rather on halakhic decision making.” “Be-inyan tzorekh be-hatafat dam brit be-gerut olei Etiopiah,” <i>Barkai</i> 3 (5746/1986): 144.</i> The Israeli heart is uplifted by the encounter with their dedication and faithfulness to tradition that has spanned many generations. In the last few years, I have participated in the Sigd holiday celebration, held on the hill across from Mount Moriah to the south. This site is first referred to in the Bible in the verse “Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place far off” (Genesis 22:4). The choice of this site at which to celebrate the holiday of the Ethiopian community is exacting and faithful to the community’s ancient tradition, for throughout their history, they lifted their eyes in longing from afar, to Jerusalem.",
            "The members of the community, and with them, the entire Jewish people, have merited fulfillment of the verse “I will say to the north: ‘Give up,’ and to the south: ‘Do not hold back; bring My sons from afar, and My daughters from the end of the earth . . . ’ ” (Isaiah 43:6). This prophecy of comfort in Isaiah seems a particularly appropriate description of the path of those who came to Israel from far in the south, and of the miraculous route they followed through the desert, over the sea, and even through the air, in order to return and gather the dispersed of Israel to their land. The arm of God is the one that “hewed Rahab in pieces, that pierced the dragon . . . that dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep, that made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over” (Isaiah 51:9–10), so that they might fulfill the prophecy “And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come with singing to Zion” (Isaiah 51:11). Many individuals took part in this mitzvah – diplomats and Foreign Ministry officials, soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces and members of the security forces, governments of Israel and ordinary Jews. Countless individuals worked indefatigably, sometimes even endangering their lives, both in public and hidden from view. All participated along with the Holy One, blessed be He, in this miraculous deed of salvation and redemption. As in the Exodus from Egypt and the days of Joshua and the Judges, as in the days of the return to Zion, so is this modern redemption. The miracles of redemption represent the conclusion of a protracted chapter of Diaspora and enslavement. But they do not lead to complete serenity and inheritance of the Jewish heritage. A long road begins from here, paved with the challenges of building the Jewish people in the Land of Israel, according to the Torah of Israel, or as we might say – building God’s people in God’s land, based on God’s Torah.",
            "The Beta Israel Jews have a special challenge, unlike any other in the history of the Jewish people. On one hand, this community preserved their Jewish identity and observed the mitzvot devotedly for many generations, despite many obstacles, physical and spiritual, and despite ceaseless attempts to convert them. On the other hand, their tradition of observance is significantly different from the accepted tradition of other Jewish communities, which was influenced by rabbinic writings from the Mishnah and the Talmud and up to the <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> and modern authorities. Most agree that Ethiopian tradition reflects ancient halakhah (Jewish law), exhibiting a very loose relationship with the Oral Torah as known to us from the time of the Sages (Hazal).",
            "Some explain this as due to the fact that the Beta Israel community was founded during the time of the dispersion of the Ten Tribes, who had no knowledge of later rabbinic tradition or even of the Oral Torah (codified beginning in the days of the return to Zion, Ezra and Nehemiah, and the members of the Great Assembly, and continuing with the Tannaim and Amoraim), nor of the entire chain of halakhah that relies on them. Some give other reasons. But all agree that there is a significant disparity between Ethiopian tradition and the accepted halakhic tradition of the majority of Jews, much greater than the differences among any of the communities that developed within the Jewish people in the Diaspora, following the destruction of the Second Temple.",
            "The Ridvaz notes that the way the Habash (Abyssinian) Jews, as they were called in his day, observed the Torah bears more similarity to Karaite practice than to rabbinical tradition. However, he recognizes a considerable difference from the Karaites, since the Karaites diverged from rabbinical Judaism and the Oral Torah out of heresy and denial of the Sages’ authority. By contrast, the Habash Jews had no direct contact with rabbinic teachings. Thus although they differ from accepted halakhah on many points, this should in no way be considered as <i>apikorsut</i> or heresy.",
            "The encounter with Ethiopian tradition poses several fascinating challenges to the world of halakhah, both in the field of academic study as well as for practical halakhic decisions. From an academic point of view, surprising questions and insights arise regarding the existence of an extra-rabbinical halakhic tradition. For example, Beta Israel is the only community that continued to offer the Passover sacrifice many generations after the destruction of the Second Temple, and to this day. Although accepted halakhah does not permit this sacrifice, we may glean foundations for such a tradition from authoritative halakhic sources. <i>Me-ikkar ha-din</i> (according to the essence of the law), one may offer the Passover sacrifice without the Temple, in modern times as well, and some recent halakhic authorities have attempted to renew this offering. This issue was raised emphatically by Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Kalischer in the nineteenth century. His proposal inspired a dynamic rabbinic polemic, which remains on the agenda today.",
            "Regarding offering the sacrifice outside Jerusalem, we may rely on the opinion that the prohibition against using local altars for worship is annulled when there is no Temple. The phenomenon most similar to the Beta Israel tradition is Beit Honya (the Temple of Onias at Leontopolis), which operated in Egypt during the Second Temple period. The attitude of the Sages toward this temple was not categorically negative, to the extent that some thought that the Judaism of Beta Israel was directly influenced by the earlier settlement of Jews at Elephantine in Egypt.",
            "For this reason, the Beta Israel tradition of the Passover sacrifice offers a fascinating opportunity to peek behind the screen of two thousand years of sacrificial tradition. Even if it was not preserved in exactly the same way as when the Temple existed, the practical aspects were maintained to a certain extent, as well as something of the spiritual climate that surrounded the sacrifices.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We must admit that something of the Passover sacrifice has also been preserved in the Passover sacrificial ceremony of the Samaritans. Although the heretical sects were expelled from the Jewish people at the end of the Mishnaic period, the Sages determined that the sects were more exacting in their performance of each mitzvah than the followers of rabbinical Judaism. If so, even if one says that they are sacrificing to honor “a dove” or “to Mount Gerizim” and not to the God of Israel, in the act of their mitzvah we may identify components of the way it was performed during Temple times.</i>",
            "Another example is the Ethiopian halakhah regarding the obligation of eating on Yom Kippur that falls on Shabbat. According to the Sages, this has no validity. But the conceptual and practical foundation of this halakhah is related to rabbinical halakhah. The tension between the value of the fast and the mitzvah of <i>oneg Shabbat</i> (enjoying the Shabbat) is well known from discussions in the Talmud and the Rishonim, regarding Shabbat in general, and regarding Shabbatot during the Elul period of repentance and the Ten Days of Repentance between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. In the final account, the Sages forbade fasting on Shabbat, except for unusual exceptions, such as fasts of exceptional Hassidim and fasting following a dream.",
            "The idea that the fast of Yom Kippur does not overrule the sanctity of the Shabbat and the mitzvah of enjoying the Shabbat has some basis, if we study the sources and refuse to rely merely on knowledge of the final ruling practiced today. The existence of a community that implements this concept, although it opposes rabbinic halakhah, recalls the significant differences in halakhic practice developed by disparate Jewish communities, which have led to the creation of diverse customs for other holidays and festivals. One example of this is the differences in Passover foods, between Orthodox Jews who avoid <i>matzah shruyah</i> (matzah that has come into contact with water) and those who do not observe this stringency, and between Ashkenazic Jews who refrain from eating <i>kitniyot</i> (legumes) and Sephardic Jews who do eat them. Another example is the differences in the laws of <i>kashrut</i> for meat, between those who stringently observe the custom of checking the lung for defects (<i>glatt</i> kosher – applies to Sephardic and some Ashkenazic Jews), following the opinion of Rabbi Yosef Caro (the Beit Yosef), and those who observe the lenient position on this ruling, following the Rema (Rabbi Moses Isserles, 1520–1572). Some stringent Sephardic <i>poskim</i> compare the consumption of non-<i>glatt</i> meat to transgression of the biblical prohibition against eating <i>nevelot</i> (carcasses of kosher animals not killed in accordance with halakhah) and <i>terefot</i> (food ritually unfit for consumption), which is equal in severity to the prohibition against eating on Yom Kippur.",
            "Interestingly, the laws of Shabbat observance that were preserved by the Ethiopian community are closer to the Shabbat laws in the book of Jubilees than to those recorded by the Sages. Researchers accept that “ancient halakhah,” practiced by some of the sects during the Second Temple period and during the period of the Sages, ruled more strictly on Shabbat laws than did the Sages. These laws, which until now were known only from the literature, were partially implemented in the halakhah of Beta Israel. Under Beta Israel halakhah, many prohibitions of <i>shvut</i> (cessation of work) that rabbinical Judaism considers <i>de-rabbanan</i> (rabbinically mandated) are considered biblical prohibitions.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gilat Yitzhak, <i>Perakim be-hishtalshelut ha-halakhah</i> (Ramat Gan, 5752/1992).</i>",
            "In summary, the theoretical and scholarly challenges that Beta Israel halakhah raises for traditional Talmudic halakhah are as follows: (1) understanding the sources and assumptions that formed the underpinnings of Beta Israel halakhah; (2) comparison with general Jewish halakhah and identification of the sources within accepted Talmudic law that are close to the Beta Israel approach; (3) explanation of the Sages’ position and its reasoning, as opposed to Beta Israel halakhah and its reasoning, following the approach of “These and those are the words of the living God.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Babylonian Talmud, <i>Eruvin</i> 13b.</i>",
            "I think that every scholar and researcher will welcome these findings as a great treasure, as they have the potential to enrich and deepen the study of halakhah and of works of Torah scholarship. This in no way intends to undermine, not even by a hair’s breadth, the stability and strength of the Oral Law or the obligation to the tradition of halakhic practice, just as studying the opinion of the House of Shammai does not undermine the obligating validity of halakhah that was decided according to the House of Hillel.",
            "The practical halakhic challenge posed by the Beta Israel community is more complex. The question that arises from every paragraph in the chapters of this book is how we must contend with this Beta Israel halakhic tradition. At first glance, three main possibilities arise. First, we may obligate the Beta Israel community to accept mainstream halakhah. Second, we may obligate the members of this community to maintain full loyalty to the tradition they have received. The third possibility is a compromise, which suggests some integration between the first two options.",
            "Under the first option, we recognize that the vast majority of the Jewish people accepted the tradition of the Sages and of halakhah as it was consolidated from the Mishnah to the <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> and its commentators. Therefore, Ethiopian immigrants who wish to observe the mitzvot properly are obligated to join existing halakhic practice, and thus abandon their own halakhic tradition.",
            "This position has several important motives: (1) uniformity of the halakhah; (2) acceptance of the majority opinion as halakhically binding and as an expression of divine will; and (3) prevention of a societal and national rift.",
            "The second option requires strict preservation of Ethiopian halakhah to the extent possible, both in terms of the self-understanding of the community and as binding halakhic-rabbinic teaching. For according to the law of “Do not foresake the Torah of your mother” (Proverbs 1:8), every Jew is required to follow the halakhic tradition of his ancestors. Such is the tradition of the members of the Beta Israel community. Following another interpretation, we may base this position on the halakhah of <i>minhag ha-makom</i>, “Whoever goes from a place where the people followed a certain tradition . . . to a place where they followed another tradition.” <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Babylonian Talmud, <i>Hullin</i> 18b.</i> Such a person is required to accept the stringent rulings of the place that he left (in other words, the stringencies of Ethiopian halakhah) as well as the stringencies of the place to which he went (in other words, the stringencies of mainstream halakhah).",
            "The third possibility, as mentioned, is a compromise position, and this is the position proposed by the author of this book. This position attempts to combine preservation of Ethiopian custom with integration of the community into Israeli society. In the following paragraphs, I will attempt to explain the value of this solution over the others.",
            "The demand that the Beta Israel community accept Talmudic halakhah is not the same as the demand that an individual who has entered another community follow its customs. The foundation of the vitality and endurance of this community is in its stubborn preservation of the customs of its ancestors, and sometimes in the extreme stringencies to which they dedicated themselves on a daily basis. In this sense, “Do not foresake the Torah of your mother” is not a saying from the book of Proverbs or an adage that was adopted by halakhah for the rules governing traditions, but rather the foundation of the community’s existence. The demand to abandon the ancient traditions and the authority of the <i>kesim</i>, their spiritual leaders, and to “convert” to Orthodox, rabbinic Judaism, is, from their point of view, intolerable. At the very least, it represents a personal injury on the level of deceit and humiliation, disrespect toward the <i>kesim</i>, and discredit of the Rishonim. Furthermore, we also have good reason to assume that the societal and spiritual significance of such a process will be the complete abandonment of religion by the youth of the community, who will lose the remaining fragment of their faith, which relies on the ancestral traditions. This is indeed happening before our very eyes, as it did in the previous generation of aliyah from Islamic countries, until the inception of the movement <i>le-hahzir atarah le-yoshnah</i>, “to return the crown of Torah to its ancient glory,” which restored the traditional foundation of faith and mitzvot to these communities.",
            "From a purely halakhic aspect, we must discuss this question: If a Jewish community was disconnected from the Jewish people and was not party to the halakhah decided by the majority, should it be required to accept the majority halakhah? Possibly, we must differentiate between the period in which the Great Sanhedrin was active in ancient Israel, when its authority and the validity of its laws applied to the entire Jewish nation without exception, and the period that followed. Possibly, because the Ethiopian Jews did not live under the authority of the Sanhedrin during the Second Temple period, they hold no obligation to its rulings.",
            "On the other hand, we may use the prohibition of <i>lo titgodedu</i> (self-mutilation in mourning for the dead) to guide an approach of forbidding the community from following some of its customs, particularly when these conflict with a law accepted as a basic principle of the Torah. Certainly in the past, when the Sanhedrin was active, the aspiration developed that the great court which met in the Lishkat ha-Gazit (Chamber of Hewn Stone) would formulate one overall body of halakhah for the entire Jewish people. But after the Temple was destroyed and the Sanhedrin sent into exile, the Jews were unable to reach agreement on a uniform halakhah for the nation, or to enforce it. Other mechanisms replaced the Sanhedrin, and despite the enormous variety of communal traditions, one central halakhah was created that applies to the entire Jewish people. Even in the postmodern world, there is no justification to practice a variety of traditions. The halakhah does not take a favorable view of individuals and groups practicing their own traditions. “There shall be one law . . . for you” (Numbers 15:16) is a fundamental value derived from the Torah that supports one mode of behavior for the entire Jewish people, not for each individual. This is especially so after the Jews have come together in the Land of Israel, and we aspire to the restoration of our judges as in ancient times and to the establishment of one Torah law in the State of Israel for all Jews.",
            "For this reason, we must pave an intermediate path that will balance between both concepts. This path should enable practice and respect for the customs and traditions of the community, but also enable integration of the community and its practices into mainstream halakhah. Wherever the differences touch on fundamental questions in halakhah, particularly issues in which the Ethiopian custom is considered forbidden under mainstream halakhah, or when general Jewish custom is considered forbidden under Ethiopian halakhah, we must make an effort to adapt practice so that preservation of the Ethiopian tradition will not create a fundamental conflict with accepted halakhah.",
            "Rabbi Sharon Shalom has done well to present in this book a model for a system enabling peaceful coexistence of these two <i>atzei hayim</i>, “trees of life,” of Torah, whose roots and trunk are shared, but whose branches have grown apart. In the first part of his book, Rabbi Shalom discusses the theoretical questions underpinning his work. But the principal significance of the book is in the second section. For each clause of the entire scope of halakhah, he suggests a practical solution for compromise between mainstream and Beta Israel halakhah, integrating the historical decision of the Jewish majority with the obligation to respect and preserve the traditions of the minority.",
            "Rabbi Sharon Shalom is well suited to this task, both through his education and through his personal talents. As a member and leader of the Beta Israel community on the one hand, and on the other, as a long-standing student of Torah in Israeli yeshivas who was ordained by the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, he is well acquainted with these two worlds, and lives within them. In his personal life, he is able to integrate his origin in the particular community of Beta Israel with full absorption into Israeli religious society, at once both traditional and modern. Aside from his education, he is gifted with sensitivity, and has the social and communal ties that enable him to attend to the human and social implications of halakhic and leadership decisions.",
            "I do not believe that this book was written as a binding book of halakhic decisions, as <i>ka-zeh re’eh ve-kadesh</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Babylonian Talmud, <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 20a.</i> The writer has provided us with a kind of <i>Shulhan Arukh</i>, a table laden with bountiful delights, but he does not dictate “accept my decision” on every detail and issue he discusses. In many details, the solutions he offers are refined and astute, and have the capacity to settle the disputes between the two traditions. In some cases, the difficulties are too severe to expect easy solutions, and his opinion may not be accepted – sometimes by the <i>kesim</i> and the community, at other times by the <i>poskim</i> and rabbis. At any rate, a leader who accepts this book as general instruction may use it to direct his community, formulate community guidelines, and instruct individuals who consult with him, and will find it to be a great blessing.",
            "On the other hand, some representatives of both sides may view the general direction of this book as a concession that is not at all legitimate. The author gives many examples of rigidity and insensitivity on the part of public leaders and halakhic experts, and we may add a range of other individuals to this list. We can only hope that this book will also serve to heighten awareness of the Jewish and human aspect that lies beyond the halakhic rigidity imposed on every leader of the Jewish public, even for those who do not agree with his central assumptions. This applies both to those who disagree with the decree of the Ridbaz and who do not accept the Judaism of the Beta Israel community, and to those who consider it forbidden to concede even the smallest point of their ancestors’ traditions – either way, one tradition is undermined, either rabbinic or Beta Israel.",
            "A fundamental principle of the Torah is <i>derakheiha darkhei noam ve-kol netivoteiha shalom</i> – “Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace” (Proverbs 3:17). This book was written out of deep faith in the value of peace. For this reason, beyond the halakhic details and the deep philosophical discussion, every page of this book emits a powerful call for peace and pleasant ways. As Rabbi Akiva said, “This is a major principle of the Torah: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ ”"

        "Author's Preface to the English Edition": [
            "Between Preservation and Renewal",
            "When <i>From Sinai to Ethiopia</i> was published in Hebrew by Yediot Publishing, no one estimated the extent of its influence on interreligious dialogue within and without the Ethiopian community. It was clear to Yediot, a well-respected publishing house in Israel, that this book was targeted to the Ethiopian sector. But we were greatly surprised that the concepts the book presents attracted the interest of many Israelis, religious and secular, from many sectors. On first analysis, we might ask, why should such a book meet with success, engaging a wide spectrum of groups and ages in such a modern, free society? Apparently, Israeli society is deeply interested in questions about the identity of the Beta Israel community. The questions of identity that engage Beta Israel represent an additional facet of the questions of self that concern many members of Israeli society. In other words, this book addresses the dilemmas of immigrants in carving out a new path in their new home, and in a new age – in other words, it delves into the tension between preservation and renewal.",
            "Between Modernity and Tradition",
            "In the past two decades, the world has taken a dramatic turn, unlike any previous change. Electronic communications technology has transformed people around the world who were previously disconnected from each other into participants in the information age and consumers in the global market. Still, when we say “village,” we mean a small settlement, and when we say “global,” we refer to something that encompasses the entire world. A conflict is created between the small village and the global one. People do not remain in the place where they began their life’s journey, but migrate to wherever they think they will be well-off and comfortable. Today, 20–40 percent of the populations of most Western countries were not born in their country of residence.",
            "The revolution of modernity has led to rejection of an entire world of tradition – a world that upheld the ideal of following ancestral tradition. Human beings now view their environment as subject to their own design, and assert that they are permitted to change it. Individuals do what they think is best for them. The free, modern individual no longer fears threats and bans as practiced in the Jewish world in the past, or persecution and censure as once practiced by the authorities of the Catholic Church. Against this background, we face the challenge of defining the boundaries between local and universal culture. Tensions arise between the aspiration to preserve the culture of origin and the desire to integrate into the new one, between assimilation and integration, between nationality and religion. Questions such as these occupy millions of people in Israel and around the world.",
            "Still, despite the freedom of citizens of the modern world to make autonomous decisions about their lives, the decisive majority prefer to view themselves as part of something continuous, as belonging at the root of their souls to something larger. Many times, it seems that grasping onto tradition is the solution for this existential need. <i>From Sinai to Ethiopia</i> has succeeded in touching on these questions, in a significant manner. From the reactions to the book in Israel, it is clear that these questions interest substantial numbers of people, from all sectors.",
            "Difference, Equality, and Responsibility",
            "The Bible describes the creation of the world, the heavens and the earth, light and darkness, land and water, and animals. Then it tells how God created all of humanity in His image: “And God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them” (Genesis 1:28). In the Jewish world, the concept of the creation of humanity in the image of God is one of the foundations of faith. As Rabbi Akiva would say, “Human beings are beloved because they were created in the image of God, as in the verse, ‘In the image of God He made man’ (Genesis 9:6)” (Mishnah, <i>Avot</i> 3:14). <i>From Sinai to Ethiopia</i> expresses this concept in a straightforward manner: in all the ways of worshipping God there is no one truth, but rather a variety of equal truths. Each person must discover his own way of connecting to the God in Whose image he is individually made.",
            "This book adopts a pluralistic understanding, supporting integration but not the annulment of different cultures. In my opinion, difference between human beings is a priori ontological, just as it is in the natural world. It is in this sense that we may comprehend the blessing <i>Hakham ha-razim</i> (“The Knower of all secrets”) – “One who witnesses 600,000 Jews gathered together should recite the blessing <i>Hakham ha-razim</i>, for just as each of their faces is different from the others, their personalities are also different from each other, and each one has his own individual personality.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Midrash Tanhuma</i> (Buber), Parashat Pinhas, par. 1b.</i> This book calls for integration and mutual, egalitarian respect, and a renewed kind of melting pot that is not destructive. Pluralism accepts difference as part of human nature, with each individual facet expressing itself in an equal manner.",
            "In Jewish sources, the individual is considered, first and foremost, as bearing responsibilities, and not enjoying rights. The Torah educates us for personal responsibility in every situation. On one hand, minorities bear responsibility toward the majority. What is considered to be prejudice against minority groups is actually damaging to the personal responsibility of that group. On the other hand, the majority bears responsibility toward minority groups, and what is considered assistance to the weak may in fact be damaging to them.",
            "A Call for Pluralism",
            "The Mishnah asks, why was Adam created alone – why did humanity begin with one person? To teach us, the Mishnah explains, that a person should never say, “My father is greater than yours,” as we are all descended from the same person (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 4:6). We thus have a firm basis to argue that a person who considers himself greater than another is committing a serious error, which borders on immorality. It follows that a person who does not value himself, who considers himself significantly inequal in value to other human beings who were created in the image of God, is also in error, and approaching immorality. The common denominator is that both are harming the image of God. The fact that a person is white, black, short, disabled, Jewish, Christian, or Muslim says nothing about whether he or she is a person who reflects the image of God. Everything is determined by the manner in which a person understands himself as a person created in the image of God.",
            "This is not a call for monolithic religion or society, but rather for multiculturalism anchored in individual responsibility and mutual respect. The call for pluralism does not mean anarchy, as in the verse “There was no king in Israel, and every man did what was right in his eyes” (Judges 17:1), or blurring of the lines that divide groups, but rather preservation of uniqueness along with mutual personal responsibility. The Torah’s dictum “Love your neighbor as yourself” is an expression of this personal responsibility. “As yourself” means that you should be capable of looking at the world through the eyes of the other, just as you have become accustomed to looking through your own eyes. We find an example of this in the relations between non-Jews and Jews in Ethiopia. The Jews of Ethiopia strictly upheld the custom of avoiding contact with non-Jews. Yet at celebrations and public events, they invited their Christian neighbors, just as the Christians invited the Jews to their events, without any bias. The groups sat separately and each group slaughtered according to its custom, but Jews and Christians respected each other. This custom teaches us that the Ethiopian Jews’ customs were based on a moral foundation, according to which all individuals are equal before God. Perhaps this is another reason that many readers have identified with the theological spirit of this book, in which uniqueness is not the opposite of unity, but rather its synonym.",
            "Toward the Next Book",
            "There is a story about a certain rabbi who used to receive a constant stream of followers throughout the day. One day, the <i>shamash</i> asked him, “Why do you sweat so much when you receive people?” The rabbi answered, “Each time I meet someone, I try to strip my emotional clothing and don his, so that I can truly understand him. I do this for each and every person. That is why I sweat.” In today’s reality in Israel, we aspire to achieve a reality in which “Each person takes upon himself the yoke of the kingdom of Heaven, one from another” (<i>malkhut shamayim zeh mi-zeh</i>). According to Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch, this means that Jews will accept the yoke of the kingdom of Heaven through their relationships with each other – in other words, their openness to each other brings them closer to God. In this manner, everyone wins. People develop a sense of belonging; they feel that they are contributing and that others trust them. Thus they are educated for strong, healthy interpersonal relations, free of jealousy and competition, firmly anchored within an atmosphere of responsibility and tolerance. <i>From Sinai to Ethiopia</i> was written out of a deep sense of faith in the concept that both sides are the words of the living God, and that there are many channels for worshipping God. How do we create such a theological-social reality? How do we create a society founded on trust and mutual respect? How do we form a society based on pluralism and egalitarianism? How do we form a consciousness based on the deep understanding that human uniformity is contrary to nature and outside of morality? And through this, aspire to human unity? In my next book, we will attempt to contend with these questions."

To paraphrase the Psalm (91:11), For He commanded His angels on my behalf to guard me in all my ways. Moses did not have the privilege of entering the Land of Israel, and countless generations of Jews dreamed of Jerusalem but did not merit witnessing the return of God to Zion. I thank God for granting me the merit to enter the Land of Israel. Why did I merit this? I cannot know. But I do know that I have a duty – “I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord” (Psalms 118:17), and the astounding story of religious Zionism, whose stubborn path led to the rebirth of the State of Israel and the Jewish people. “With long life will I satisfy him, and make him to behold My salvation” (Psalms 91:16).",
            "I pray that this book will open for Ethiopian Jewry a channel through which they may discover the philosophical world of the Beta Israel community, and that it will carve a path for dialogue between communities and a meeting between worlds. I pray that Beta Israel will become an inseparable part of the mosaic of the Jewish people and Israeli society. May the love of Heaven and love of humanity increase, for beloved is humanity who was created in His image."

                "<big><strong><i>The Spiritual World of Ethiopian Jewry, Then and Now</i></strong></big>",
                "This book was born out of a personal need to find a particular path for worshipping God. In my opinion, many members of the Ethiopian community, of the first generation and especially of the second generation, share this need. The move to another country burned the Ethiopian community deeply. Apparently, many Ethiopian Jews do not view their tradition as a link connecting their past to their present and future in the State of Israel. The community’s ancient traditions, bound by a strong cord to the time of the Mishnah, made it unique and separated it from mainstream Judaism. Against this background, the community wavers between the commitment to preserving its tradition (and thus being defined as different) and the longing to join the majority, without particular characteristics. The lack of a spiritual path that connects past, present, and future has led many Ethiopian Jews to a theological crisis, disorientation, and a sense of helplessness.",
                "My esteemed teachers (Rabbi Shabtai Rappaport, <i>shlita</i>; Rabbi Yehuda Brandes, <i>shlita</i>; Rabbi Nachum Rabinowitz, <i>shlita</i>; Rabbi Dr. Daniel Sperber, <i>shlita</i>; and Rabbi Reuven-Tal Iasso, <i>shlita</i>) proposed that I separate the fields of halakhah and philosophy. Thus the present book addresses the halakhic field, while a philosophical book that will examine questions of identity is expected for publication in the near future.",
                "I view this book as a window through which readers may peek into the world of Ethiopian tradition and halakhic interpretation, and understand contemporary halakhic decisions, as presented below in <i>Shulhan ha-Orit</i>. In writing this book, I have essentially created “something from something,” as I have collected already existing written material that was scattered throughout many articles and books, and organized it into a structured composition. Thus I am not stating anything new here. The interviews with community and spiritual leaders, which demanded intense attention and much patience and tolerance, proved a significant addition to this work.",
                "As the author of <i>Mesillat Yesharim</i> (Path of the Just), Rabbi Moshe Haim Luzzatto, wrote:",
                "<small>I have written this work not to teach men what they do not know, but to remind them of what they already know and is very evident to them, for you will find in most of my words only things which most people know, and concerning which they entertain no doubts. But to the extent that they are well known and their truths revealed to all, so is forgetfulness in relation to them extremely prevalent.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Moshe Haim Luzzatto, introduction to <i>Mesillat Yesharim</i>, trans. Aryeh Kaplan (5734/1974).</i></small>",
                "What brings intelligent people, wise and knowledgeable individuals, linguistic artists, to ignore the simple and well-known principles upon which the world is based, such as mitzvot <i>bein adam le-haveiro</i>, the laws that govern interpersonal relationships?",
                "The author of <i>Mesillat Yesharim</i> provides us with an answer to this question:",
                "<small>A consideration of the general state of affairs will reveal that the majority of men of quick intelligence and keen mentality devote most of their thought and speculation to the subtleties of wisdom and the profundities of analysis, each according to the inclination of his intelligence and his natural bent. There are some who expend a great deal of effort in studying creation and nature. Others devote all of their thought to astronomy and mathematics, and others to the arts. There are those who go more deeply into sacred studies, into the study of the holy Torah, some occupying themselves with halakhic discussions, others with Midrash and others with legal decisions. There are few, however, who devote thought and study to perfection of Divine service – to love, awe, communion with God, and the other aspects of <i>hassidut</i> [saintliness].</small>",
                "Failure to attend to such simple issues also causes distance from the Divine path:",
                "This state of affairs results in evil consequences both for those who possess wisdom and for those who do not, causing both classes to lack true saintliness, and rendering it extremely rare. The wise lack it because of their limited consideration of it and the unwise because of their limited grasp. The result is that saintliness is construed by most to consist in the recitation of many Psalms, very long confessions, difficult fasts, and ablutions in ice and snow – all of which are incompatible with intellect and which reason cannot accept.",
                "Rabbi Moshe Haim Luzzatto addresses the phenomenon of ignoring issues that are well known and evident. The more evident they are, the more they are ignored, and people forget them. What is the cause of this? According to the author of <i>Mesillat Yesharim</i>, the cause is that most intelligent people invest their energy in studying “the subtleties of wisdom and the profundities of analysis,” such that they forget and even distance themselves from <i>hassidut</i> and ethical interpersonal relations.",
                "Yet Rabbi Luzzatto did not answer the question of what causes people to invest their energy in refined halakhic arguments. Further, in the final analysis, everyone is aware that “true saintliness” is the basis for a just society. So why do such people not repent and admit that they have erred?",
                "I believe the solution to this question lies in the words of Rabbi Elazar Hakapor about the qualities that lead a person to the grave: “Jealousy, and lust, and ambition, drive a person out of the world.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishnah, <i>Avot</i> 4:21.</i> Here Rabbi Elazar teaches us that in the presence of one of these characteristics, no human being is left. The person is erased. Human intelligence does not function at all. As Rabbi Moshe Almozalino says, “driving a person out of the world” means the loss of common sense, because it is as if he has abandoned the human side of himself, and thus he is erased from the world.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Midrash Shmuel</i>, <i>Avot</i> 4.</i>",
                "In other words, excessive preoccupation with “the subtleties of wisdom” is only a symptom of a greater problem: having been “driven from the world” by jealousy, lust, and ambition (in other words, ego). Still, the solution is not to flee from such traits. A dichotomous understanding of the world is invalid, as it is based on despair and fear. Inner exploration of egotistical characteristics reveals that they have two sides. On one hand, they detach the person from grasping onto the grounding of reality – they “drive a person out of the world.” On the other hand, these qualities serve as an anchor for creative activity, and give a person power and majesty. The root of creativity is also the root of destruction. It is incorrect to adopt a passive lifestyle and to make it into an ideology. The significance of such an approach is to amplify one side of life, the dark side, garbed in a cloak of misfortune and lack of vision or creativity. This spirit is inappropriate for intelligent human beings, certainly not for the Jew, who is commanded to fashion himself in the image of God. How can this be accomplished?",
                "Rabbi Yehuda Bar Simon began, “After the Lord your God shall you follow” (Deuteronomy 13:5). But can human beings follow the Holy One, blessed be He, He about whom it is written, “Your way was in the sea, and Your path in the great waters” (Psalms 77:20)?. . . Can human beings ascend to the heavens and cling to the Divine Presence, about whom it is written, “For the Lord your God is a devouring fire” (Deuteronomy 4:24)? . . . Rather, from the beginning of creation the Holy One has been occupied first with planting – “And the Lord God planted a garden eastward, in Eden” (Genesis 2:8). Similarly, when you enter the Land, you should occupy yourself first with planting – “When you shall come into the Land and shall have planted” (Leviticus 19:23).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Leviticus Rabbah</i> 25.</i>",
                "Thus the solution is not found in the depths of the ocean nor in the heavens above, but rather deep within ourselves, in our self-awareness – in the ability to distinguish between envy, lust, and the search for honor that lead a person to creativity and humanity, and envy, lust, and the search for honor that reduce a person to glorification of the ego, such that “There is no other but myself.” An extremely thin line separates these two states. Nothing but the tip of a letter <i>yud</i> separates between “<i>Ein od milvado</i>” (There is no other but Him) and “<i>Ein od milvadi</i>” (There is no other but myself). Thus Rabbi Yosef Dov Soloveitchik describes the dichotomous character of a person who grasps these two modes of being:",
                "It is in this light that we can understand the deep contradiction pervading the spiritual self-evaluation of <i>homo religiosus</i>. On the one hand, he senses his own lowliness and insignificance, his own frailty and weakness; he knows that even “a gnat precedes him, a snail preceded him.” He sees himself as . . . the one biological creature who has misused his own talents for destructive ends, who has failed in the task assigned to him. On the other hand, he is aware of his own greatness and loftiness, how his spirit breaks through all barriers and ascends to the very heights, bores through all obstacles and descends to the very depths. Is he not the crown of creation to whom God granted dominion over all the work of His hands? . . . In the depths of his consciousness he is entangled in the thicket of two contradictory verses. One verse declares, “When I behold Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, the moon and the stars which You have established; what is man, that You think of him?” (Psalms 8:4–5), while the other verse declares, “Yet You have made him but a little lower than the angels, and have crowned him with glory and honor. You have made him to have dominion over the works of Your hands; You have put all things under his feet” (Psalms 8:6–7).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Joseph B.

                "We thus find that the individual faces a challenging task, if not an insurmountable one. He must find the path between “There is no other but myself” and “There is no other but Him.” With an understanding of the fine difference between these two perspectives, we may now understand Rabbi Luzzatto’s proposal for correcting the problem, which he presents in his introduction:",
                "Though the beginnings and foundations of saintliness are implanted in every person’s heart, if he does not occupy himself with them, he will witness details of saintliness without recognizing them and he will trespass upon them without feeling or perceiving that he is doing so.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Mesillat Yesharim</i>, introduction.</i>",
                "Several reasons brought me, as an Ethiopian Jew, to write this book. The first reason, as I have mentioned, is out of personal need, as in the verse “I will speak, that I may find relief” (Job 32:20). The second reason is the complete ignorance of Israeli society regarding the entire traditional world of the Ethiopian Jewish community. It is thus necessary and valuable to teach our customs and explain our beautiful tradition. The third reason is related to the community’s spiritual leaders, the <i>kesim</i>, who sense a delegitimization of the spiritual customs of the community as a way of worshipping God. In addition, I believe that the customs and traditions of the Ethiopian community are an important source of knowledge that stands on its own, that can shed much light on Jewish tradition as a whole.",
                "From a certain viewpoint, aliyah for the Beta Israel community was equivalent to the destruction of the Temple. For this reason, recording the customs of Ethiopian Jewry in a manner that is organized according to modern halakhah is important now – it is “A time to act for God; they have made void Your law” (Psalms 119:126). The final reason is on behalf of the young generation growing up in Israel, who are mostly forgetting our customs. For all these reasons, I decided to write this book, <i>From Sinai to Ethiopia: The Halakhic and Conceptual World of the Ethiopian Jews</i>, including the <i>Shulhan ha-Orit</i>, to teach all of humanity what it has never known, and for the Ethiopian Jews, to remind them of what they already know, but “forgetfulness in relation to them is extremely prevalent.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibid.</i>",
                "In the natural course of things, so I believe, the halakhic solutions proposed in this book will lead many fellow Jews, even Ethiopians, to raise an eyebrow. In certain places, there will be those who will even denounce some of the statements and ideas here. Whatever the resistance or criticism, know that I am working from pure motivations, while remaining faithful to the people and the Torah of Israel. At the same time, I ask that the call for unity be just that, and not a call for uniformity. The reader should try to stand in the other’s shoes, and from there, he will find tolerance toward the “other” as other. This demand is not new – it is a demand for a basic norm of behavior. The demand for uniformity, by contrast, conflicts with nature and with Jewish tradition, which throughout history has supported unity while granting room for autonomy of the individual, at least for expressing opinions. This is the image that arises from every page of the Talmud.",
                "Further, every attempt of Jewish tradition to create a monolithic society, as far as I am aware, has created an apologetic society, shallow and defensive, and has led to baseless hatred that ends in destruction. In short, we are never obligated to agree with everything, especially in relationships between the individual and God. Every person is unique and special before the Holy One, blessed be He, and for this reason, each of us attempts to relate to God in his own special way. We conclude that there is no one way to worship God. We must demonstrate tolerance – instead of apathy or yielding of the path – toward those who think differently.",
                "The support, understanding, and instruction that I received from my teachers in writing this book are an excellent example of healthy tolerance. Their attitude toward this book made a deep impression on me. My teachers and rabbis studied the content from a point of view of Jewish tolerance, with no apologetics or veneer of doubt. In my opinion, a lack of tolerance expressed in physical and verbal militancy or in dogmatic apologetics of the sort we might call the “self-appointed religion police” originates in instability of faith, insecurity in one’s way of life, or in lack of coherent understanding of life in general and the history of Jewish tradition in particular. Apparently, the source of my teachers’ tolerance for this work is located deep within their world of faith, and in their desire to emulate the qualities of God. According to the Kabbalah, God is full of tolerance toward the world in which we live. God, Who is omnipotent, infinite, and manifold, limited Himself and enabled the material world to come into being. This is the “secret of limitation” (<i>tzimtzum</i>) explained at length in the works of the kabbalists of Safed. The meaning of this secret, to put it concisely, is that everything that exists is part of the Divine. But in order for all created things (angels, animals, plants, dust) to exist, instead of pure Divinity in its unique essence, the Divine must limit itself, in a manner of speaking, and refrain from appearing in its full power. The Divine Power influences every single creature only according to the measure that it can tolerate.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Avraham Regelson, <i>Or ha-Kabbalah be-shirat Milton </i>[The light of Kabbalah in the poetry of Milton], http://www.benyehuda.org/regelson/milton.html.</i>",
                "From this we learn that tolerance is derived from the concept of limitation. Further, this unique perspective of my teachers, of power on one hand and limitation on the other, enabled me to feel that this book was a legitimate path to worshipping God. “Just as He is merciful, so should you be merciful” (Rambam, <i>Hilkhot De’ot</i> [Laws of personal development] 1:5–6).",
                "Since I made aliyah, I have had the privilege of meeting many Jews in Israel and around the world. I have been amazed at the great distance that seems to separate various groups, and simultaneously, the solidarity that bonds these groups. In each place, I searched for similarities, but found differences – differences that lead to a world that is deep and full of growth and personal development. During my travels, even more than I learned about others, I learned a great deal about myself. I thank the communities and families I met abroad in the past ten years through World Mizrachi, Emunah of America, British Emunah, Israel at Heart, Zohar Organization, Tzohar Rabbinical Association, Bar-Ilan University, and other private organizations. Undoubtedly, their humane, tolerant, and loving behavior toward the “other” inspired my admiration and served as a personal example for empathy, caring, and solidarity. Every meeting with Jews left a powerful impression on me of determination, Jewish power, and particularly Jewish solidarity.",
                "Over the years, I discovered that admiration for the ways of the Jewish people has been expressed by many.

He is as prominent on the planet as any other people, and his commercial importance is extravagantly out of proportion to the smallness of his bulk. His contributions to the world’s list of great names in literature, science, art, music, finance, medicine, and abstruse learning are also away out of proportion to the weakness of his numbers. He has made a marvelous fight in this world, in all the ages; and has done it with his hands tied behind him. He could be vain of himself, and be excused for it. The Egyptian, the Babylonian, and the Persian rose, filled the planet with sound and splendor, then faded to dream-stuff and passed away; the Greek and the Roman followed, and made a vast noise, and they are gone; other peoples have sprung up and held their torch high for a time, but it burned out, and they sit in twilight now, or have vanished. The Jew saw them all, beat them all, and is now what he always was, exhibiting no decadence, no infirmities of age, no weakening of his parts, no slowing of his energies, no dulling of his alert and aggressive mind.

In every place I have visited, both in Israel and around the world, beginning with the meeting with the Mossad and the IDF elite naval commando unit, Shayetet 13, in 1982 on the beach of Sudan, I have been privileged to witness special moments in which individuals revealed enormous personal sacrifice, dedication, and boundless responsibility.

                "As a child in Ethiopia, I thought that Jerusalem was made of gold. I dreamed of a land of milk and honey, in which everyone was Jewish and the gentiles did not hate them. My friend Mesphin Iasu, of blessed memory, and I decided to do what every Ethiopian Jew dreamed of doing: to make aliyah, to go up to Jerusalem, which was our term for Eretz Yisrael. At dawn, without saying a word to our parents, we two children awoke and left our village of Irer in the Godolo region, on our way to the Promised Land. This decision was the climax of many stories we had heard from our fathers and mothers. Mesphin and I began to run. We didn’t know in which direction to go. We only knew that we had to run, and we believed that if only we ran far enough, in the end we would reach Jerusalem. In the afternoon, after we left the Godolo region, we were detained by locals from the adjoining region who suspected that we were spies. Mesphin managed to escape from prison, but I remained behind.",
                "An elderly local came to prison. He asked me, “Boy, tell me – who are you?”",
                "“I’m the grandson of Abba Dejen Mengesha,” I answered.",
                "The old man replied, “You’re his son?! You’re the son of an <i>agoway – wedy Israel</i>?! <i>Giratam kaila</i>!” These are all derogatory words that the non-Jewish Ethiopians use for the Jews. “You’re a Jew who drinks the blood of Christians and eats them!” I was confused by this accusation. “Release him so he’ll leave this place!”",
                "The old man did not order my release out of the goodness of his heart, but in the hopes that I would fall prey to wild beasts. I was released in the middle of the night. I didn’t know where to go. I thought about my friend Mesphin. I had no idea what had happened to him. (I later found out that he had escaped on his own and returned to the Jewish village.) It was pitch-black outside, and the sounds of the animals intensified my fear. I pounded on a door in the town and pretended I was a non-Jewish shepherd who had lost his way. The next day, I woke up and asked how to get to the village of Irer. My hosts gave me directions, and I began to run again. In the evening I reached my village. My family had no idea where I had been. They were afraid that I had been devoured by animals or harmed by evil spirits. I arrived exhausted and panting heavily, but unharmed. For me, this was a first attempt. Although it ended in failure, I held onto the vision of reaching Jerusalem, postponing it to another, more successful opportunity.",
                "In the village, we continued dreaming of Jerusalem. Less than two years after my first failed attempt to go to Jerusalem, a second opportunity arose. Rumors began to fly around our village and others that Jews from Jerusalem had come to Sudan in order to help the Ethiopian Jews, the Beta Israel community, to go to Israel. The gates were open, and whoever wanted to leave could go ahead. None of the villagers thought of waiting. We all did everything possible to get organized and start moving in order to go up to Jerusalem. Every item that could be sold, we sold. Whatever we couldn’t sell, we left behind in our clay huts. After two thousand years, we began to internalize the idea that the road to Jerusalem was open. One night, when the sign to begin the journey was given, the residents of several villages gathered at a meeting point and began the great trek to Jerusalem.",
                "Our hasty departure led to complications. In my family, we kept our donkeys, so sometimes we rode, but most of the group journeyed on foot. We walked for over two months from Ethiopia to Sudan, exposed to the dangers of the road. People were certain they would reach Jerusalem within a short time, but in reality, some of them were forced to wait in the Twawa refugee camp in Sudan for as long as six years. Conditions in the camp were harsh – it was overcrowded, and sanitary conditions were deplorable. The path from this situation to outbreaks of infectious diseases was short. Thousands died of disease. In consideration of this situation, the Mossad and Jewish Agency aliyah representatives did their best to help the interned Ethiopian Jews. They worked to improve conditions and speed up the stream of aliyah, all the while operating under stressful conditions and a heavy pall of secrecy and fear. On the one hand, they tried to push up the pace of aliyah, while on the other, they had to be careful not to arouse the attention of the soldiers of Jaafar Nimeiri, president of Sudan.",
                "My family was in the camp, and we were told we would have to wait two or three years for our turn. The mortality rate among children in the camp was particularly high, so some of the parents decided to send their children ahead of them to Israel, to try to save their lives. I was the eldest child in my family. At eight years old, I was told to go with my aunt and uncle to Jerusalem. I was torn between my love for my family and my love for Jerusalem. I followed my parents’ wishes. Along with hundreds of other children, adults, and elderly, I was packed into a crowded truck. The bed of the truck was covered with a heavy tarp, and we were off.",
                "Conditions inside the truck were foul. It was terribly crowded and hot. People vomited, and the smell was unbearable. No one dared to make a sound. Even the children and babies were silent, as if they also realized they had to keep silent, or else put all of our lives at risk. We didn’t know where they were taking us or how much longer we would have to travel in this horrific state. Finally, the truck stopped, and we heard a powerful racket outside. The tarp was lifted from the truck bed, and we climbed out. The roar intensified. I had no idea what it was. Then I saw an amazing sight, something I had never seen before. I saw water, more and more water that erupted and writhed fearfully. This was the shore of the Red Sea – my first glimpse of the ocean. It looked like a wild beast that hadn’t been fed for weeks, and it moved toward us, jaws open, but from inside a cage that confined it. I can hardly describe my fear at the sight of the powerful waves pounding toward me – I didn’t know they would stop the moment they reached the shore. Then suddenly a miracle happened. From out of this nowhere, from deep within the darkness and the fog, the tumult and the confusion, commandos from unit 13 of the Israeli navy rose up out of the sea. They shed tears, and we cried along with them. It was a meeting of two brothers who had been separated for two thousand years.",
                "The soldiers loaded us onto rubber boats. It was a dark night, and the boats floated silently into the sea. After a while, the boat reached what I thought was a large, well-lit building – an Israeli naval ship. The boat passengers climbed up through the belly of the boat onto the high deck. Some of them kissed the deck, convinced they had arrived in Jerusalem. Only the next day, when the sun rose, did we realize that we were on the deck of a boat in the middle of the ocean. We sailed to Sharm el-Sheikh in the southern Sinai Peninsula. Then we were taken off the boat and driven in buses to the local airport. From there, we flew to Ben-Gurion airport, our gate to the promised Jerusalem – the first step in a reality that for many years had been only a dream.",

The Emunah Children’s Center provided for all my needs, and my aunt and uncle, Btouli and Tedu Sisay, whom I did not know in Ethiopia, became my family. Then one day, the children’s center director, Baruch Vasen, called me to his office urgently. I went in and sat down cautiously, petrified I had done something wrong. Then he told me that the news I had received two years earlier about my parents’ death had been a mistake. My entire family was alive, and the night before they had made aliyah in a major IDF operation (Operation Moses).",

I had the constant feeling that people were looking at me, thinking I was a character who had come out of a popular Israeli children’s book, <i>The Little Black Boy Goes to Kindergarten</i>. I felt different, foreign. I remembered that feeling of otherness from when I was still in Ethiopia, from the other side of the coin. When a representative of the Jewish Agency came to our village, we considered him a <i>feregi –</i> a foreigner. Still, we desperately wanted to meet him, because he was a Jew who came from Jerusalem. In Israel, it was difficult for me to reconcile the difference between the dream of Jerusalem and the reality. But I know it was harder for the adults than it was for me, a child.",
                "My identity became a central question. Who was I? In Ethiopia I was identified as a Jew of Beta Israel. They called me “Israel.” But ironically, here in Israel I was called “Ethiopian.” To me, it was a jarring experience to discover I was an Ethiopian. Later, I discovered that my Ethiopian name, Zaude, had been changed to the Israeli name of Sharon. I was pleased to have this name, because people explained to me that this was a new name from Jerusalem. Wonderful, I thought, but that led me to ask: Who am I, an Israeli or an Ethiopian? What does it mean to change your name to an Israeli one? Or on the contrary, to keep your Ethiopian name? Was society a factor that pulled me down and kept me back, or was it a motivating factor that pushed me forward? I also asked, why am I different? Is difference a blessing or a handicap? Is this society racist or not? I had to reformulate my identity – how should I go about it? I was confused.",
                "Furthermore, I constantly heard conflicting voices. Some said that Israeli society was racist, while others said it wasn’t. Some said we had to throw our Ethiopian identity out the window, but some said we should preserve our traditions. I heard these two voices even within my own family.",

As we walked around, we saw an uncomfortable sight: a young man and woman sat on a bench, one on the other’s lap, kissing. My grandfather was surprised, and asked, is this what people do in the Holy Land? But he wasn’t angry. He asked me, do you know why the dog does not get along with the cat? No, I said. “I’ll tell you,” he continued. “The animosity between them began back in the time of the Flood, when Noah forbade all the animals from having sexual relations. The male and female dogs couldn’t control themselves, and they went into a corner together. The cat caught them in the act and told Noah. Noah cursed the dogs, saying, ‘You will be punished an eye for an eye. You mated in hiding, so from now on you will mate in public for all to see.’ ” My grandfather added, “Ever since, the dog doesn’t like the cat.” That was my grandfather’s response to this encounter with Israeli social reality.",
                "Eight years after hearing this story, I asked him, “Grandfather, how old are you?” He replied, “I’m eight years old.” I was astonished. “Eight years old? How can that be?” He answered that the moment he set foot on the ground of Jerusalem, he began to count the years of his life anew. I was thrilled. With all the complex reality of life after aliyah, my grandfather still saw the light of Jerusalem.",
                "One day, my uncle (my grandfather’s son) came to me and asked, “Do you think we have democracy in Israel?” “Of course we have democracy,” I replied. He countered, “No! We have no democracy in Israel. The only place where there is democracy is in the cemetery.” I asked him why he thought that. “While my father was alive, he lived in a small apartment in the immigrant absorption center, while the mayor of our city lived in a fancy neighborhood, in a large house. After my father’s funeral, I saw who was buried next to him – the mayor! Finally they became neighbors.” He continued, “You see, democracy exists only in the cemetery.” I listened to both my grandfather and my uncle, and I asked, which one of them is right?",
                "My grandfather’s death had a profound effect on me. He was a man I esteemed greatly, who had a powerful fear of God. He was righteous and honest. He knew the book of Psalms by heart, and he was a Jew with all his heart and might. He had a pure soul. I asked myself, where does he sit now – in the Garden of Eden? I thought that beyond any doubt, my grandfather must be sitting in the same room with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Aaron, David, and Solomon. He was sitting with all the <i>tzaddikim</i>, the Prophets, the Tannaim, and the Amoraim. Then I reached an earth-shattering conclusion: a man like my grandfather, whose worship of Heaven was based on the Ethiopian tradition, had reached the status of sitting up there with all the righteous people. For the first time, I understood that there were many channels to worshipping God, and all of them are equally legitimate.",
                "Over time, I learned that everyone in the world has difficulties and challenges along the way. I tried to avoid asking questions like “Why did they do that to me?” “Why did God do that to me?” “Why is it my fault?” None of the immigrants to Israel have had it easy, no matter what country they came from. Countless Jews suffered indescribable horrors in the death camps in Germany in the Second World War. Some were saved and came to Israel. But they weren’t expecting government aid for new immigrants. They picked up weapons and went out to fight in the War of Independence, in order to establish a state. Many of them met their deaths. This had a big impression on me. People might call me naïve, but this quality is what has pushed me to examine the reality of Israeli society and discover that society is a given condition. Society does not make personal claims against certain individuals or groups. Each individual determines how to interpret society, whether in a positive or negative light. I, like my grandfather, have chosen to emphasize the good side of Israeli society, and I have found much to appreciate.",

Why were the Ethiopian Jews required to immerse themselves in a <i>mikveh</i>?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Immersion in a ritual bath or <i>mikveh</i> is one element in the process of conversion to Judaism. Requiring Ethiopian Jews to immerse implies that something is amiss in their status as Jews.</i> My teacher, Rabbi Yehuda Amital, did not try to win me over with intricate and convoluted halakhic justifications. Rabbi Amital was not surprised by my question, but I was startled by his answer. “If someone comes to me tomorrow and expresses an interest in you for a <i>shidduch</i>, I don’t want to have to hesitate when recommending you for a match. People here ask questions, and we want you to be an inseparable part of the student body in the <i>beit midrash</i>.” I thought this was an honest answer.",
                "The obligation of immersion <i>le-humrah</i>, on the strict side of halakhah, for the Ethiopian community led to a deep rift in relations between the community and the state. In fact, to this day a holistic solution to this problem has yet to be found, and the community considers it the elephant in the room. My teachers, the two rabbinic directors of Har Etzion Yeshiva, required every immigrant of Ethiopian Jewish origin to immerse himself as a prerequisite for admission to the yeshiva. Personally, I did not have to perform this act when I entered the yeshiva, as I had immersed myself on arrival in Israel. Eventually, I did have the merit to feel an inseparable part of the student body in the <i>beit midrash</i>, as Rabbi Amital described.",
                "Rabbi Lichtenstein gave a more technical and nuanced explanation based on halakhic foundations for why we should immerse, and his explanation was given with great respect and humility. To my estimation, many communication problems between people arise not because of what is said, but because of how it is said. Both yeshiva directors, each in his own way, were attentive to the “how,” giving me the feeling that they recognized that standing before them was a Jew who needed sympathy and tolerance. Indeed, their words fell on attentive ears.",

I studied halakhic decision making for many years in a yeshiva that was built on the basis of the Lithuanian yeshiva ideal, and I was ordained as a rabbi by the Chief Rabbinate of Israel. I thus assumed that I should follow in one of the normative paths, either Ashkenazic or Sephardic. However, I thought that opting for the Ashkenazic tradition would be “obeying the letter but not the spirit of the law,” because I was told upon making aliyah that I was considered to be Sephardic. But opting for the Sephardic approach was also problematic. Although in practice I did take upon myself Sephardic customs, this choice did not stem from self-awareness, but rather from a technical reason. In all the institutions in which I had studied at the outset of my educational path, and in my neighborhood, almost everyone came from a Sephardic background. Yet I felt that this was not my path to serving God, and that it did not fit my spiritual world or my soul.",
                "At some point when I was in the <i>hesder</i> yeshiva, I began to feel a pull toward the Ashkenazic hassidic world. The Yiddishkeit appealed to me: sitting around the Shabbat table with friends at a <i>tisch</i> eating kugel and singing the melodies. But in truth, I felt that I could not fully adopt for myself even this spiritual world. For years I defined myself as having two sides – one side was Sephardic halakhah, the other was Ashkenazic soul. Then two things happened that transformed this worldview significantly.",
                "The change took place during my studies at Beit Morasha of Jerusalem and in the Department of Talmud at Bar-Ilan University. A number of factors led me to reexamine how I served God. At one opportunity, I asked my teacher, Rabbi Dr. Yehuda Brandes, director of the <i>beit midrash</i> in Beit Morasha, whether I should follow Sephardic tradition, despite the fact that many of its <i>halakhot</i> did not fit the halakhic phenomenology of traditional Ethiopian Jewry. Rabbi Brandes’s reply surprised me. I expected him to give me a standard answer – “You should follow either Sephardic tradition or Ashkenazic tradition, but you must never grasp the rope from both ends,” as in the statement “Be either like the House of Shammai in their leniencies and stringencies, or like the House of Hillel in their leniencies and stringencies.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Ecclesiastes 2.</i> I was astonished when he answered, “Who said you have to follow Sephardic or Ashkenazic tradition? You can be a Jew who follows the <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> standard code of law.” I said that I feared I would be following the letter but not the spirit of the law, and he replied, “I have faith that you truly want to serve God. You cannot be following only the letter but not the spirit of the law. Either your priority is the way of Torah, or you are immoral.”",
                "Rabbi Brandes’s reply expanded my horizon and opened up new space for my service of God: serving God not through awe alone, and not through fear, as if I were walking a tightrope. All at once, I felt an easing. I felt that serving God was not a burden or an encumbrance. There was a way to pave a unique path to serving God that reflected my complex inner world.",
                "A second encounter cemented my new spiritual framework. While writing my master’s degree thesis, under the professional and compassionate advisorship of Rabbi Dr. Daniel Sperber of the Department of Talmud at Bar-Ilan, I was exposed to a new interpretation. Up to that point, I had thought that the “red line” for an Orthodox Jew was the <i>Shulhan Arukh</i>. In other words, following the decisions of the <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> was a clear sign of what I call a “Talmudic Jew,” one who observes the mitzvot, while one who questioned its authority removed himself from the ranks of Talmudic Jewry. Professor Sperber answered me, “Why do you think that? The Yemenite community has always followed the Rambam in its halakhic decisions, and not the <i>Shulhan Arukh</i>. Yet the Yemenite Jews have been accepted without a shadow of a doubt into the realm of Talmudic Judaism. Although at the outset, major rabbis did not agree with their method, over the years their customs and traditions have earned approval and have even become assets. Today, no one would question that this group belongs to Talmudic Judaism.”",
                "“If so,” I asked Rabbi Dr. Sperber, “what should I learn from this?”",
                "“Who says that the red line is the <i>Shulhan Arukh</i>?” he responded.",
                "“So what do you think is Judaism’s ‘red line’?”",
                "“The Talmud,” he answered, “because the Talmud is accepted by the entire Jewish people. We have reason to think that the Talmud should become the red line.”",
                "This surprised me even more. Then I understood the breadth of the space that had opened before me. Paradoxically, the replies of Rabbi Brandes and Rabbi Sperber were not foreign to me at all. On the contrary, I felt that they offered me an answer to an inner vacuum, and quenched my thirst. “My soul thirsts for God, for the living God; when shall I come and appear before God?”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 42:3.</i> Now! Suddenly I felt that I had the tools, the way, and the personal pace with which to meet my God.",
                "When I first thought about writing this book, naturally I consulted with Rabbi Dr. Sperber. He gave me his support and encouragement to pursue the process of recording and preserving the traditions of the Ethiopian community. He even directed me on how to proceed. After writing the first draft, I showed it to him. Professor Sperber emphasized the particular customs of the community, and based on this, he supported the radical halakhic decisions in my project. On the other hand, he did not hesitate to warn me of points that he felt might be damaging to the community.",
                "When I began to write this book, I contacted Rabbi Shabtai Rappaport, head of the Beit Midrash of the Jesselson Institute for Advanced Torah Studies at Bar-Ilan University. I received his blessings, and throughout the writing process, he guided me in a pleasant and professional manner, offering cheerful encouragement and broad knowledge on a variety of topics. My conversations with him contributed greatly to this composition.",
                "When I finished writing, I sent the draft to Rabbi Yehuda Brandes. I asked him to read the work, and I anxiously awaited his comments. His comments were edifying and very practical. Rabbi Yehuda represents those <i>talmidei chachamim</i> who are expert in halakhah but maintain a deep connection to the present reality. Finally, Rabbi Yehuda advised, “This is a very important work. Its importance cannot be underestimated. It must be published and publicized.”",

An angel that lives in a perfect, ideal world has no doubts, but humans who live in the pre-messianic world do have doubts. Indeed, doubt is a component of belief. For this reason, any attempt to construct a perfect world through a single decision remains only an illusion. Judaism speaks of a mysterious world full of doubt, and its goal is to enable a life of faith in such a world. The impulse to try to make clear, absolute decisions originates in the scientific world, as science strives to give unconditional, universal answers about life.

Instead of the lavish attention paid to framework and symbol, we should encourage the confrontation with content, spirituality, and the Jewish world, with the understanding that the mitzvot enable the individual’s encounter with God and with other human beings. In my opinion, this opportunity has been sorely missed. To me and many others, Judaism has been responsible for unifying the Jewish people over thousands of years of Diaspora and distance. The problem is that today more than ever, the religious world divides the Jewish world. Religious and non-religious Jews cannot eat together, they cannot manage a business together, live in the same neighborhoods, or marry each other. Even within religious groups, a hierarchy prevails, with well-defined divisions. Today we might find four observant Jews sitting together but who cannot eat each other’s food, due to <i>kashrut</i> laws. In such a miserable reality, the definition of the Jew becomes external, not one of meaning or value. To which stream does one belong?

The inferior side, in this case, the human being, must adapt himself in a temporary, artificial manner to the status of respect, in order to bridge the gap between himself and God and to be worthy of meeting with Him. By contrast, a consciousness of submission creates for the inferior the need to diminish his appearance and to emphasize the chasm that exists between himself and the person greater than he.

Factors that influenced Abba Mahari included the civil war taking place at that time among district princes and noble families, and the missionary activity that affected the Jews. But above all, Abba Mahari was influenced by the ascendancy of Emperor Tewodros II, who valued the Jews and aspired to conquer Jerusalem from the Muslims. He is known for declaring, “Jerusalem is the wife and Ethiopia is the husband.” Abba Mahari viewed these events as signs of the approaching end of the Diaspora. According to tradition, the God of Israel revealed Himself to Abba Mahari in a dream and said, “The time of redemption has arrived. You must lead the Jews to the Land of Israel.”",

Abba Mahari tried to calm the public, and spoke to them about Zionism: “We must believe that God is testing us, as he did our forefathers during the Exodus from Egypt. He parted the sea then, and He will do so now as well.” He believed that God was with him, watching over the community. Abba Mahari raised his staff over the water, but it did not divide. He entered the sea first, followed by thousands who believed that God would part the waters. Instead, many drowned. The survivors returned to Ethiopia, settled in villages, and established a Jewish community in the Tigray area. The first attempted journey of Ethiopian Jewry to the Land of Israel was thus a stinging failure that claimed many victims. It also represented an attempt at transition from imagination to rationality, and left behind stories of heroism of simple people who believed that the time would come when their children would cross the ocean and return home to the Land of Israel, to build and be strengthened there.",

In the Jewish consciousness, the Temple was understood as the place where God “atoned for Israel’s sins.” When the sacrificial rites in the Temple disappeared, the direct connection between the people and their God was severed, and there was no way to atone for sins.

But this does not fully describe the elements of the crisis. We must recall that many mitzvot and traditions, even those that were not dependent on the Temple in their essence, were connected in the public consciousness with the sacrificial ritual. The Temple served as a foundation for the national unity of the Jewish people. Jews from all over the Diaspora sent yearly donations for its continual upkeep. Even a Jew who lived in the Diaspora his entire life made sure to send a half shekel every year to Jerusalem, and by doing so, he gave material expression to his national involvement.

For the first time, the need arose to determine a normative halakhah that would unite the entire people. The sages of the Yavne generation, aware of this trend, emphasized the necessity of deciding halakhah. Out of concern for the completeness of the tradition that they and their teachers had cultivated for hundreds of years, the sages of Yavne saw a need to revise and organize it.

The move to Israel was accompanied by the total collapse of the religious, authoritative, and family system within which the Ethiopian community lived. When they came to Israel, the traditional balance between men and women was undermined. The sensitive relationship between the community and its spiritual leadership was disrupted, and the observance of mitzvot was damaged. For this reason, we may state that some of the negative social phenomena we observe today, such as abandoning the practice of Judaism out of depression and discouragement, interest in the Afro-American world, and leaving Israel and immigrating to other countries, are the results of the crisis of aliyah. Yet the majority of the Israeli public remains unaware of the deep religious crisis that continues to affect the Ethiopian community.",

The family structure was patriarchal, and it was part of the intergenerational communal family, whose members took responsibility for each other for seven generations. The division of roles within the family was clear: the man held the authority, and he represented the family toward community members and leaders. As the most respected member of the family, he was responsible for its economic status, the division of roles, education, tradition, religion, and spirituality. The woman, who was married at a very young age, went to live with her husband’s family and was considered his property. She performed hard physical labor and was responsible for cooking and raising the children. Community life followed a traditional pattern and was led by spiritual leaders who drew their power from Judaism. The need and demand to adapt to the Western lifestyle in Israel led to many changes in the traditional lifestyle. Their dream of spiritual fulfillment was dashed. The <i>kesim</i>, the community’s spiritual leaders, were not recognized by the Israeli establishment, and their status was weakened. They found themselves out of place in terms of their culture, mode of dress, and dark skin. The status of the traditional community institutions was eroded, and they lost their efficiency in leadership and problem solving.

They sense that they cannot publicly express their opinion on halakhah or tradition. They feel a controlling attitude from above, instead of a joint debate on the most serious issues.

Acceptance of this work is a clear sign of recognition of a Talmudic Jew. Anyone who questions its authority has apparently not found his place among the ranks of Talmudic Judaism. Yet in the past century, a group of Jews – the Yemenites – asserted that they did not rule according to the <i>Shulhan Arukh</i>, but rather according to the Rambam alone. Still, the Yemenite Jews were accepted without any doubt into the rubric of Orthodox Judaism. At first, major contemporary rabbis did not agree with their halakhic practice, but today no one questions their belonging.

While the Yemenites recognized the world of the Mishnah, Talmud, the Geonim, the Rishonim, and the <i>Shulhan Arukh</i>, the Beta Israel community did not recognize any of these. Its tradition is based entirely on the biblical text and additional halakhah that was preserved orally. This group also demanded recognition as an integral part of the Jewish people.

The parents scorn this practice and consider those who follow it to be uncultured. Many parents do not understand it, not only because it is opposed to their cultural world, but also because it does not follow the spirit of the Torah, whose “ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace” (Proverbs 3:17).",

This is the custom practiced today in a synagogue in Kiryat Gat. According to the <i>kes</i> of the synagogue, Kes Barhan, this practice is based on the principle of not coming to the synagogue empty-handed – “every man shall give as he is able” (Deuteronomy 16:17). Yet this practice has led to complaints, anger, and degradation of the <i>kesim</i>.

Many sources in the Talmuds point to differing attitudes toward the nature of the individual. While the Babylonian Talmud adopts a suspicious, skeptical approach toward the individual, as in the first half of the verse in Psalms 34:15, “shun evil,” the Jerusalem Talmud promotes a positive attitude and believing in others – as in the second half of the same verse, “do good.” Below we will give several examples in support of this distinction.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">93</sup><i class=\"footnote\">My friend Rabbi Avraham Blas assisted me greatly in locating the sources in the Jerusalem Talmud.</i>",

The Babylonian Talmud cites the likelihood that a person who is not proficient in blowing the shofar might carry it to one who is proficient in blowing, in order to learn. He thus might be tempted to carry it four cubits in the public domain, which would be a violation of the Shabbat.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Babylonian Talmud, <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 29b.</i> But the Jerusalem Talmud forbids blowing the shofar on Shabbat for another reason:",

That is, because he is involved in performing a mitzvah, there is no fear that he will stray from the goal. There is no need to worry that a person who acts for the sake of heaven will wander into forbidden territory. Likewise, it is not an assumption that a man has no desire for women that makes a woman feel secure that her husband will not be unfaithful; rather, it is the love and trust between them that fosters this faithfulness. In the same way, the Jerusalem Talmud trusts that the priest will not stray because his love for and fealty toward God and the mitzvot overrides any other desire.",

A fundamental controversy lies at the root of this issue. One approach is that man is weak in character, and if the beautiful woman is not permitted to him, he will go to her when she is forbidden, and therefore we will permit it – this is the educational approach of the Babylonian Talmud, which considers how to protect man. In contrast, the approach of the Jerusalem Talmud is revolutionary, and expresses powerful faith in man’s powers.

Sometimes, cultural difference influences the choice of sources and arguments, and sometimes the interpretation of sources may differ. How is the personal aspect expressed in the halakhic decision? In my view, the answer is, <i>kabbalat ol malkhut shamayim</i>, “accepting the yoke of Heaven.” Where there is <i>yirat shamayim</i>, fear or awe of God, there is room for the personal aspect, because the individual wants to do God’s will.

Since Operation Solomon, groups of Falashmura have periodically been allowed to make aliyah on the basis of family reunification. For years large numbers of Falashmura have been gathered primarily in a transit camp in Gondar, in very difficult conditions, waiting for a decision on their aliyah status. Concluding in 2013, Operation Dove’s Wings brought to Israel nearly eight thousand additional Falashmura, and the government of Israel declared the matter closed, but there are still thousands more who feel connected to the Jewish people, have family in Israel, and long to make aliyah. There is an urgent need for the Israeli government to address the plight of the Falashmura, via private organizations in the first stage, while in the second stage, the government must establish a government committee made up of representatives of various groups (<i>kesim</i>, rabbis, Knesset members, activists, researchers, and representatives of the government of Ethiopia) to finally find a definitive and complete solution.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">152</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For more information on the situation of the Falashmura, see Mitchell Bard, “Ethiopian Jewry:The Falash Mura,” <i>Jewish Virtual Library</i>, https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/falashmura.html, and Michal Shmulovich, “The Last of the Falash Mura?” <i>The Times of Israel</i>, August 26, 2013, http://www.timesofisrael.com/the-last-of-the-falash-mura.

During the periods of the Talmud and the Mishnah, mourners and excommunicated Jews wrapped their heads. During the Hellenistic and Roman periods, uncovering the head was a sign of respect. In Babylon in the third century, the Sages developed the custom of covering the head and not walking four cubits with the head uncovered, as a sign of respect and awe before God. This custom spread throughout Babylon, and thus the Jews covered their heads during prayer or whenever mentioning God’s name. From Babylon, the custom gradually spread to Eretz Yisrael. During the Middle Ages, the custom was not universal, but it slowly developed to include covering the head throughout the day as well as when mentioning God’s name.

According to legend, the Jews were not permitted to fulfill the mitzvot for forty years. Due to this decree, many mitzvot were forgotten, and even the community sages were unable to reconstruct them. The mitzvah of tefillin was among these forgotten mitzvot. My late grandfather, Abba Gideon (Dejen) Mengesha, upheld this belief. He used to tie small phylacteries to his forearm. They were not black, and they looked like a charm with a piece of parchment inside. He wore these phylacteries all day long. This custom serves as supporting evidence for the assertion that in the past, Ethiopian Jews did practice the mitzvah of tefillin in a certain manner. On the other hand, some community members state that they had no knowledge of this mitzvah. Community elders also recognize this opinion. The fact that wearing tefillin was not known to the Beta Israel community, which left Eretz Yisrael during the First Temple period, arouses many questions about the history of this mitzvah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">My teacher, Rabbi Dr. Noam Zohar, believes that the practice of laying tefillin began in a later period. Until then, the mitzvah was understood as conceptual only – “And you shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes” – meaning that the mitzvot should be engraved upon or bound to the heart and intellect. In a later period, this mitzvah was expanded beyond the allegorical dimension and transformed into a practical act.</i>",

In Deuteronomy, the verse reads, “And you shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes” (6:8). The Oral Torah completed the details of this mitzvah. Many laws of tefillin were determined after the destruction of the Second Temple and during the Second Temple period – for example, that the tefillin should be written on parchment in black ink, that they should be square, and that the straps should be black. According to the historical findings, we may assume that the shape of the tefillin as we know it today became unified over time. An Aramaic document from the Jewish community of Elephantine from the early third century BCE mentions a silver box tefillin. Tefillin found in the Qumran caves were dated at the first century, during the Great Rebellion (66–73/74 CE). These tefillin contain a number of Torah portions, including the Song of Moses (<i>Ha’azinu</i>, Deuteronomy 32) and the Ten Commandments. In the Qumran tefillin, the texts are different from the traditional ones – only some follow the Masoretic text. Remains of tefillin from Bar Kochba’s time (132–136 CE), which were found in Nahal Ze’elim in the Judean Desert, contain selections from only two Torah portions, and their text is almost identical to the Masoretic text.",

The Talmud further relates that the warriors of Bar Kochba at Beitar went out to war decorated with tefillin.

Most Jewish men have worn tefillin at least once in their lives. Thus we must explain to the Ethiopian community the importance of this mitzvah, with courtesy and respect. Experience demonstrates that when we address the other with politeness, the response is more positive. At the same time, we must use caution and avoid pressuring those who remain unconvinced. Further, it is completely forbidden to behave disrespectfully or with superiority toward those who do not wear tefillin. When an individual migrates from one culture to another, we cannot demand that he make a drastic change in his culture. In the same way, we cannot ask a believer who was accustomed to a certain practice, such as the Ethiopian tradition, to leave everything he knows behind and begin to follow new practices, as per the Talmudic <i>halakhah</i>. A person is not an object or a robot. We cannot force the Ethiopian community to abandon their ancient traditions and immediately accept mainstream <i>halakhah</i>. Who are we, and in which direction would we proceed without those sages who inspired in us the belief in the Rock of Israel and His Redeemer? Those who are not convinced to wear tefillin undoubtedly share this same belief. “Man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord sees into the heart” (I Samuel 16:7). Still, as noted, we should encourage the Ethiopian Jews to wear tefillin as is practiced among all other Jewish communities, or at least to follow my grandfather’s practice.

The first mention of the custom of facing Jerusalem when praying appears during the Persian period, in the book of Daniel. The windows of the prophet’s house faced Jerusalem, and three times a day he kneeled in prayer (Daniel 6:11). Additional evidence for prayer in the direction of Jerusalem is found in the pseudepigraphic (apocryphal) works from the Second Temple period. The book of Esdras writes, “When the youth went [outside], he lifted his face to Heaven toward Jerusalem, and he blessed the King of Heaven, and said” (I Esdras 4:58). Thus after the destruction of the Temple, when the Sages determined obligatory prayers, they taught that while reciting the Amidah, people should direct their bodies as well as their minds toward Jerusalem. But if one was unable to direct the body, it was sufficient to focus the mind on Jerusalem. These <i>halakhot</i> are reflected in Tannaitic literature. The Mishnah states, “If one was riding a donkey, he should dismount from it [while he prays]. If he is unable to dismount, he should turn his face [toward Jerusalem]. And if he is unable to turn his face, he should focus his heart toward the Holy of Holies.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishnah, <i>Berakhot</i> 4:5.</i> Based on this, we learn that it is preferable to dismount from the donkey and turn the body toward Jerusalem, and if this is not possible, intention is sufficient.

The Tosefta specifies (<i>Berakhot</i> 3, 15–16):",
                    "Those outside the Land of Israel should focus their minds on the Land of Israel, as in the verse, “If they . . . pray toward their land” (II Chronicles 6:38).

In other words, if any one part of the body touches an impure item, the entire body becomes impure. For example, if one touches a dead body with his foot, one’s entire body is rendered impure.

But on Shabbat the situation was different, because they had to eat the Shabbat meal after dark. Today, since we use electricity for lighting, most rabbis permit the use of electricity instead of candles. It is preferable to light candles, since this serves as a special sign that the lights were lit in honor of Shabbat. But if candles are not available, one may recite the blessing over electric lights. This mitzvah is a requirement for each household, and it does not matter which person in the house lights.

In light of the sources we have examined, we may assume that the Sages recognized the existence of groups that completely prohibited sexual relations on Shabbat.

Thus we should not disparage Ethiopian Jews who today continue to refrain from relations on Shabbat. The Sages’ opposition should be understood in light of the struggle against the Karaites, but today it is not a heretical custom, and so we should permit those who prefer to follow their ancestral custom. On the other hand, those Ethiopian Jews who do not wish to follow the custom of abstaining on Shabbat are not erring against the precept of “Do not foresake the Torah of your mother,” as the majority of the Jewish people do have sexual relations on Shabbat. Unity and the desire to become one people, such that each individual can realize his personal inclination in worshipping God, supersede ancestral customs."

The Beta Israel community understood the term <i>Shabbat</i> in this biblical phrase to refer to <i>yom tov</i> (as did rabbinic Judaism). But the Beta Israel interpreted <i>yom tov</i> to refer to the last <i>yom tov</i> festival of Passover (and not the first <i>yom tov</i>, which was the rabbinic interpretation). Given that in Ethiopia the counting of the Omer began at the end of Passover, the Shavuot festival consequently always fell on the twelfth day of Sivan. When I asked one of the <i>kesim</i> about the reason for this custom, he answered me, “This is something we received from our forefathers over many generations. It may be that the counting of the Omer was postponed to the end of Passover so as to avoid mingling the precepts of Passover with the precept of counting the Omer.” Therefore, only when the Passover holiday was over did the Jews in Ethiopia begin the new mitzvah.",

According to the followers of Baithos (a Sadducee), who rejected the Oral Torah, the word <i>Shabbat</i> in this phrase meant the weekly Shabbat, so that the phrase <i>mi-maharat ha-Shabbat</i> would refer to the day after the intermediary Shabbat of Hol ha-Moed Passover, which means that the day of the Omer offering would always be on a Sunday. In contrast, the Pharisees (or Rabbanites), who relied on the Oral Law, interpreted <i>mi-maharat ha-Shabbat</i> to refer to the day after the first <i>yom tov</i>, since <i>yom tov</i> is also called a Shabbat, a day of <i>shvitah</i> (rest from work).

Other than Passover, the holidays were fixed by the people of Israel based on Kiddush ha-Hodesh (sanctification of the new month). However, with respect to the first Passover holiday, the people of Israel did not yet exist as a nation in order to sanctify the new month. This means that the very first Passover was instituted by the Holy One Himself, as was the Sabbath. In order to remind us of this and to memorialize this, the Torah specifically calls Passover a “Shabbat” in the biblical phrase <i>mi-maharat ha-Shabbat</i>. Thus it follows that that <i>mi-maharat ha-Shabbat</i> means the day after the first <i>yom tov</i> of Passover, which is always the sixteenth day of Nissan.",

However, immigrants from Ethiopia who identify with this custom, or who were educated in religious schools and institutions where this custom was kept, may certainly abstain from shaving. In any case, one should shave on Fridays in preparation for Shabbat, since the status of Shabbat in Ethiopia was extremely high.

In the Mishnah, this holiday is called Atzeret (lit., “stopping”), as it falls after the end of seven weeks, like Shemini Atzeret which falls the day after the final (seventh) day of Sukkot; and also because on that day, the Israelites stopped all labor, like on the seventh and concluding day of Passover (also called Atzeret in the Torah – Deuteronomy 16:8).

In effect, the Torah presents this day as one of atonement in the Temple for the Israelites’ impurity. The atonement of the Israelites was intended to “cleanse” them, and thus enable a reality in which God’s presence was in continuous habitation, among a people that by nature committed sins. On this day, worship in the Temple followed a special order, at the center of which stood the <i>kohen gadol</i>. On this day only, he entered the Holy of Holies (<i>kodesh ha-kodashim</i>), the holiest place in the Temple. He was the only person permitted to enter that space, and only on this day. The Yom Kippur service included special sacrificial offerings: a bull for a sin offering, a ram for an <i>olah</i> offering, and two goats, over which the lottery was drawn. One goat was sent to Azazel, while the other was sacrificed. The blood of the bull and the goats was sprinkled in front of the Ark of the Covenant in the Holy of Holies, and on the curtain in the <i>heikhal</i> (Holy). The <i>kohen gadol</i> recited confession over the goat and bull, for his sins, those of the other priests, and those of the entire Israelite congregation.",

In Mishnah times, on this day and on the holiday of Tu be-Av (the fifteenth day of the month of Av), young men customarily went out to the vineyards to where the young women danced, to look for potential wives.

The reason for this joy was that on Yom Kippur, Moses was given the second set of two tablets, and God forgave the Israelites for the sin of the Golden Calf. Therefore on this day, He forgives all of Israel’s sins. Another reason is that during this period, including Yom Kippur, Solomon dedicated the Temple that he built (II Chronicles 7:8–10).

                    "The command to celebrate the holiday of Sukkot, also called <i>hag ha-asif</i>, “festival of the ingathering,” is given in several locations in the Torah (Exodus 23:16; Exodus 34:22; Leviticus 23:33–43; Deuteronomy 16:13–17), in the Prophets (I Kings 8:2; Ezekiel 45:25), and in ancient rabbinic texts. In the Prophets, it is called simply <i>hag</i> (I Kings 8:2; Nehemiah 8:14). The commandment to build the <i>sukkah</i> is to commemorate the booths that God provided for the Israelites when He took them out of Egypt. The Tanna Rabbi Eliezer comments that these <i>sukkot</i> were the clouds of glory that protected the Israelites as they were walking in the desert. The Gaon of Vilna supports this interpretation, saying that on Yom Kippur, 10 Tishrei, Moses descended from Sinai with the second set of tablets, and on the next day, 11 Tishrei, he gathered the nation and commanded them: “ ‘Take from among you an offering to the Lord; whoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, [namely] the Lord’s offering: gold, and silver, and copper’ (Exodus 35:5).”",
                    "The Torah then specifies, “So they took from before Moses all the offering[s], which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it. And they brought him more gifts every morning [<i>ba-boker ba-boker</i>]” (Exodus 36:3). The word <i>boker</i> (morning) appears twice, meaning that the Israelites brought their offerings for two days, on 12 and 13 Tishrei. The next day, 14 Tishrei, the craftsmen received the offerings, and then on 15 Tishrei they began to build the Tabernacle. At this point, the clouds of glory, which had disappeared due to the sin of the Golden Calf, returned to protect the people – thus we build <i>sukkot</i> on 15 Tishrei, in commemoration of those clouds of glory. The Tanna Rabbi Akiva offers another explanation, that the commandment of <i>sukkah</i> is designed to remind us of the <i>sukkot</i> that the Israelites constructed when they camped in the desert.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibid.</i>",

According to the Rambam, the reason for this mitzvah was that the four species symbolized the joy of entry into the Land of Israel, which was flowering and green, and had both fruit trees and non-fruit-bearing trees, after life in the treeless desert. In addition, apparently the four species were more common in the Land of Israel at that time. Others explain that during the festival of ingathering, an individual might mistakenly think that he attained his wealth due to his own strength and talents.

In this year, Alexander Macedon conquered the Middle East, including the Land of Israel. This began a process of integrating the cultures of East and West into what became known as “Hellenistic culture.” Its outstanding characteristics were the development of a shared language, blurring of national differences, and encouragement of individualism, and change in the concept of the state – in other words, a worldview that placed the individual at the center of society. Dozens of Jewish towns became city-states, following the pattern of the Greek city, which was called <i>polis</i>. The <i>polis</i> was led by a people’s council and elected officials.

The Jewish populace, however, viewed this trend as assimilation and a desecration of Judaism. Disputes broke out between the Hellenistic priestly nobility and the masses. The tension reached its peak during the reign of Antiochus Epiphanes, who ruled from 175 to 164 BCE. The priests participated in sports competitions in Jerusalem, which had recently become a Greek <i>polis</i>, and neglected their duties in the Temple, as described in the book of Maccabees: “Even the priests lost all interest in their sacred duties. They lost interest in the Temple services and neglected the sacrifices. Just as soon as the signal was given, they would rush off to take part in the games that were forbidden by our Law.

The Temple was desecrated and renamed after the Greek god Zeus. Jews gave their lives for sanctifying God’s name. The rebellion spread under the leadership of Matathias the Hasmonean and his sons. Following his death, leadership passed to his son Judah, called “the Maccabee,” and on 25 Kislev, 164 BCE, he conquered Jerusalem. He purified the Temple and transferred its service to the anti-Hellenizers. The rebels celebrated the purification of the Temple and the rededication of the Altar for eight days.

But the Babylonian custom was to fast for three non-contiguous days before Purim, and one of these days was apparently 13 Adar.

(2) Later, in Second Temple times, 13 Adar became a day of rejoicing over Judah Maccabee’s victory over Nicanor and the Greeks in 161 BCE (I Maccabees 7:43–49).

While she was still in the child or adolescent stage, her father could arrange her marriage, even without her agreement. If the father did not arrange marriage for her during this period, he could not do so without her agreement after she became an adult, because at that age she was responsible for herself.",
                    "In the third century CE, a change of opinion is documented among the Babylonian sages. They protested the practice of the father arranging his daughter’s marriage while still a child or adolescent, and preferred that he wait until she reached adulthood, and could state her own preference. In Jewish communities in medieval times, the custom was to arrange marriage during childhood and adolescence, out of fear for sudden economic hardship, assimilation, or kidnapping. The latter was common in various periods in certain locations under Islamic rule. Beginning in the sixteenth century, the age of marriage for women rose, first in central Europe and then in Eastern Europe. Eastern European literature from the late nineteenth century reveals that women married after age twenty.",

Parents initiated the wedding, and ideally, they chose a partner from a family of good reputation, whose members were all accepted as Jews. Another consideration was the financial status of the family. In choosing a wife, her beauty and physical perfection were also weighed – she should have no physical defects, whether visible or hidden. Sometimes the choice was made when the partners were children, and even before they were born. During Mishnah times, if a man married a woman who was not of equivalent family status, the family performed a ceremony called <i>ketzatzah</i> (cutting). They opened casks of nuts and roasted seeds, distributed them to the participants, and declared: “Our fellow Jews have heard that our brother So-and-so has married a woman who is not his equal. We fear that his seed will mingle with ours.

In Tannaitic sources, we find descriptions of popular celebrations on Tu be-Av and Yom Kippur, in which the young women went out to dance in the vineyards, and unmarried men were sent there to search for partners. Judges 21 mentions a similar popular festival, although without a date. This text describes a holiday for God that was celebrated in Shiloh, and to which the sons of Benjamin were sent to take wives. Talmudic sages emphasized the importance of acquaintance between partners. Rav, a respected Babylonian Amora, decreed that a father must not arrange marriage for his daughter until she grew up and could say, “I want So-and-so.” One who arranged marriage for his daughter without first introducing her to the intended groom was liable for punishment with lashes. Thus some understood the word <i>shiduchin</i> (matchmaking) as referring to acquaintance and communication between the partners. Others interpreted <i>shiduchin</i> as the result of acquaintance and communication, since in Palestinian Aramaic, the word <i>shadech</i> means “quiet,” and the couple enjoyed emotional quiet or calm when they knew their intended spouse. In medieval Europe, romantic love became the dominant factor in choosing a spouse. This concept gradually influenced other cultures, including European Jewry, and is reflected in Jewish literature from the nineteenth century.",

In the fourteenth century, matchmaking became a source of income for rabbis, thus transforming the matchmaker’s social status.

One who goes out with an uncovered head.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishnah, <i>Ketubot</i> 7:6.</i> Accordingly, a Tannaitic midrash interpreted the unbinding of the hair of the adulterous woman: “ ‘He uncovered the woman’s head – this is to teach us that the daughters of Israel cover their hair, and although there is no evidence of this, we do find mention of this in ‘And Tamar took <i>afar</i>’ (understood as meaning “a scarf” – see I Kings 20:38; II Samuel 13:19) upon her head.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifri, Naso, ch. 19.</i> In Babylon, in the Amoraic period, covering the hair for a married woman became <i>da’at Moshe</i> (biblical law). We learn this from the Talmud’s questioning of the Mishnah’s understanding that covering the hair is <i>da’at Yehudit</i>: “The prohibition against going out with the head uncovered is biblical, as it is written, ‘[He] let the hair of the woman’s head go loose’ (Numbers 5:18). The school of Rabbi Ishmael taught that this is a warning to the daughters of Israel that they should not go out with the head uncovered.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Babylonian Talmud, <i>Ketubot</i> 72a.</i>",
                    "The Talmud asks how the Mishnah can state that unbinding the hair is <i>da’at Yehudit</i>, while according to Rabbi Ishmael, it is <i>da’at Moshe</i> and not <i>da’at Yehudit</i>. From this point on, in the literature of the Geonim and Rishonim, they used the term “unbinding the hair” to mean uncovered hair, continuing the interpretation given in Talmudic literature of the prohibition against “unbinding the woman’s hair.” We learn from this that during Talmudic times, covering the hair was such a well-accepted custom for women that it was considered <i>da’at Moshe</i>. The Talmud explains the seeming conflict between the Mishnah and Rabbi Ishmael as follows: “Biblically, it is quite satisfactory [if her head is covered by] her work-basket; according to traditional Jewish practice, however, she is forbidden [to go out uncovered] even with her basket [on her head].”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibid.</i> In other words, the Torah obligates a woman who goes out into the public domain to cover her hair with a <i>kaltah</i>. This was a braided basket with many holes, which did not cover the hair completely, and seems to have been only a symbolic covering. But based on <i>da’at Yehudit</i>, a woman is obligated to fully cover all of her hair.",
                    "In contrast to the situation in Babylonia, where they ruled strictly and forbade the woman to go out in public wearing a <i>kaltah</i>, in Eretz Yisrael they were more lenient, as we learn in the name of the Amora Rabbi Yochanan: “<i>Kaltah</i> is not unbinding the hair.” The Amoraim of Babylonia, in an attempt to avoid controversy, said Rabbi Yochanan was referring to a place less public than the public domain, such as when a woman is in her private courtyard – in such a location, covering the hair with a <i>kaltah</i> was sufficient. According to several Rishonim, the conclusion derived from the Talmudic passages is that in her own courtyard, or her own home, a woman is not required to cover her hair: “In the courtyard, a <i>kaltah</i> is sufficient.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See also Tosafot, ibid., s.v. “<i>Ve-elah ba-hatzer</i>.”</i> In this case, if she does not wear the <i>kaltah</i>, she is violating <i>da’at Yehudit</i>, but in the public domain, she is obligated to wear a full head covering, and if she does not do so, she violates <i>da’at Moshe</i>, a biblical prohibition.",
                    "Other Rishonim, including the Rambam, did not reach this conclusion from the Talmudic passages. In their opinion, the prohibition against uncovering the head in the public domain is only <i>da’at Yehudit</i> (agreeing with Rabbi Yochanan in the Jerusalem Talmud).

But in the seventeenth century, Rabbi Joel Sirkis wrote in his commentary on the Tur: “Uncovering the hair is completely forbidden, even if the woman remains in her own home. . . .

A woman’s beauty is dedicated and sanctified to her husband. Outside the house, complete strangers, both men and women, give us compliments. No matter what the compliment, there is no substitute for one that comes from a person who is close to us. Still, there is no need to cover the entire head, nor should a woman appear slovenly due to this. The book of Proverbs asserts, “Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain” (Proverbs 31:30). We need not take this dictum literally. Rather, as the verse in Proverbs continues, “a woman who fears the Lord, she shall be praised.” Beauty takes on deep meaning when it comes together with fear of God. A woman who knows how to combine fear of God and beauty is certainly deserving of praise and admiration."

Thus the mitzvah of <i>milah</i> does not supersede Shabbat in any circumstance.

Further, Herman (Yechezkel) Cohen, a Jewish philosopher, has said that one of the greatest contributions of the Jewish people to the world is the messianic concept, because this is the greatest expression of hope for a better world. Thus this philosopher objects to Zionism. He considers Zionism to be derived from the abandonment of religion, as it means giving up on the concept of messianic hope. What, then, should a Jew do? He should continue to live in the Diaspora, and aspire to work for a better world under the Kingship of God. Even if we disagree with his ideas, in reality the presence of Jews among the gentile nations has a direct influence on the security of the Jews who live in Israel. Political considerations justify the presence of Jews abroad. Many Jews who live among non-Jews succeed in their own way at serving as a “light unto the nations,” and to spread God’s Name and the reign of Heaven. It seems to me that living abroad is not merely justifiable after the fact, once we are already there, but is valid as a preliminary choice. As said, of course, this is a personal decision.",

According to the Rambam’s ruling, there is no permission for Jews who came to Israel from Ethiopia, and those who were born in Israel, to leave Israel (according to Rabbi Nachum Rabinovitch’s interpretation). Still, if they feel a sense of mission and through this, they feel they can find themselves as Jews and as representatives in the world of God, the King of Israel, this is admirable. They should go out with this feeling and merit serving as faithful representatives of the Jewish people. But, fellow children of Israel, you should recall that everywhere you go, you are going to the Land of Israel. “The mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established as the top of the mountains,” (Isaiah 2:2); “For out of Zion shall go forth the Torah, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem” (Isaiah 2:3); “They shall come that were lost in the land of Assyria, and they that were dispersed in the land of Egypt, and they shall worship the the Lord in the holy mountain at Jerusalem” (Isaiah 27:13)."

When one goes to visit, the visitor should not sit on a high chair above the patient, nor above his head.

If a person is judged favorably, he will be resurrected in the future messianic age. The empty space that a person leaves after he departs from this world is painful for his family, and so they mourn and weep. Judaism has determined a framework and time frame for mourning, out of recognition of the importance of giving expression to mourning. Judaism forbids a person from mourning beyond the fixed framework, for two reasons: first, to ease the individual’s coping with the new reality, and second, to educate the individual for faith and the religious awareness that every person has a role, and when his time comes, he is taken by God, as the verse says, “the Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord” (Job 1:21).",

From this the Sages derived that on the first day after returning from the cemetery, a mourner eats his first meal of food prepared by others. This meal is called <i>se’udat havra’ah</i> – from the root <i>v.r.h.</i>, meaning “food which is given to the mourner” (II Samuel 12:17; 13:5). Others reason have been given for this practice. First, the mourner may lose the will to live. When neighbors and friends bring food, this shows that they care about him and that he is important to them.

This custom prevails today in a number of Jewish communities. At the <i>se’udat havra’ah</i>, traditionally the mourners are served foods that are round in shape: eggs, round cookies, chickpeas, and lentils. One reason for this is to recall the continuity of life, symbolized by the circle. During the Talmudic period, the Jews usually ate meat and drank wine, symbolizing that death was not caused by the deceased’s sins but by the first sin in Eden, and that the deceased was in fact a righteous person.

If the memorial day falls on another day of the week when the Torah is not read, the mourner must go up to the Torah on the Monday or Thursday that is closest to the memorial day.",
                    "At the end of the Shaharit service, the custom is to give the congregants some alcoholic drinks and baked goods – Hassidic Jews call this a <i>tikkun</i> (repairing), as the blessings recited over the food and drink serve as “reparation” or “healing” for the soul, which rises to higher spiritual worlds. The mourners also go visit the grave. They do not do this on Shabbat, Yom Kippur, holidays, or festivals, and if the memorial day falls on one of these days, they advance or postpone the date of visiting the cemetery. Some do not visit the cemetery on Rosh Hodesh, Hanukkah, or days when Tahanun is not recited, but postpone until after those dates. In addition, some do not visit the cemetery the entire month of Nissan, only on the eve of Rosh Hodesh Nissan.",
                    "Some fast on the memorial day, and it is commendable to give charity and study Mishnah for the ascension of the soul of the deceased. The reason for this is that the letters that form the word Mishnah, <i>mem</i>, <i>shin</i>, <i>nun, heh</i>, are the same as those in the word <i>neshamah</i> (soul), and by studying Mishnah, which is the Oral Torah, one causes the soul to ascend, thereby shortening the process of atonement. If there are no children to recite Kaddish for a deceased person or to observe the annual memorial day, it is commendable to dedicate a Torah scroll or books on halakhah to the synagogue in his name, following the words of the Prophet, “I will give them in My house and within My walls a monument and a memorial better than sons and daughters; I will give them an everlasting memorial, that shall not be cut off” (Isaiah 56:5).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Herman, <i>Ma’agal hayei ha-yom</i>.</i>",

        "Reaction to the Book": [
            "The following are excerpts from letters received by the author and comments made upon publication of the original version of this book in Hebrew.",
            "D. A.: “The book you have written (with excellent timing) was like a drink of cold water for a tired soul. Your interesting and fluent writing granted me continuous enjoyment in reading this book, and inspired me to read it again. I learned new things about the sources of Talmudic customs and general Jewish history. I was particularly impressed by your worldview, traditional and based on the Torah, yet Western. I was pleased to discover that you work in educating youth and a generation of educators.”",
            "W. A. T.: “What Rabbi Sharon Shalom has attempted in <i>From Sinai to Ethiopia</i> is to preserve the most ancient tradition among the Jewish people, from the period preceding the Sages. It will form part of the mosaic of Jewish culture and enrich it. For many years, I desired from the depths of my soul to preserve our beautiful tradition, but I did not find anyone who shared this wish. Our people only tried to distance themselves from every sign of tradition, and to imitate other communities or at least to ignore ours. After reading Rabbi Sharon’s book, I was filled with joy. Only He Who knows all secrets is aware of the inner happiness and pride I felt. From that moment, I felt that our tradition had legitimacy, and there was no more need to hide it in the depths of our souls. On the contrary, we Ethiopian Jews have traditions that should be expressed in everyday life, and not remain in books or museum exhibits. Until now, the concept of traditions has been applied only to communities such as the Yemenites, Sephardim, or Ashkenazim. None of these customs has any basis in the text of the Torah, nor in the Talmud, and yet they wave the flag that bears the slogan of ‘Jewish custom is Torah,’ and the verse ‘Do not foresake the Torah of your mother.’",
            "“In a <i>shtiebl</i> in Bnei Brak, I once saw a sign with directives for the <i>hazzan</i>: ‘The <i>hazzan</i> will wear a hat, a suit, and <i>gartel</i> [belt that separates between the heart and the lower part of the body]. He will pray according to Nusah Sefard with Ashkenazic pronunciation. Before prayer he must immerse himself in the <i>mikveh</i>. He must not shave, following the custom of our holy rabbis.’ I am certain of one thing: ‘the custom of our holy rabbis’ is not the Tannaim or the Amoraim, not the Rishonim or the <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> or the Rema. Rather, these customs were developed by communities in Eastern Europe, but they still use the term ‘our holy rabbis’ even though this list of rules has no relation to halakhah, and they preserve their customs punctiliously. However, when it comes to the customs of Ethiopian Jewry, these sayings do not apply. All of our customs are deemed in error, and we should be subject to the <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> and <i>Yalkut Yosef</i>. (I do not know what source in the Tanakh or Talmud says we should be subject to these.) Naturally, this leads to loss of respect for parents, <i>kesim</i>, the entire Ethiopian community, and to slander of our ancestors who followed and preserved the customs. How sad it is to see some of the negative responses of members of the Ethiopian community toward the book, which are shallow and lacking in content. This demonstrates self-degradation, and when a person does not respect himself, others do not respect him and even belittle him. Today we see that communities who ingratiate themselves to other communities are not received in a welcoming manner, and all the more so, are derisively rejected.",
            "“We may argue about the significance of this book, but the discussion should be topical and respectful, with proofs from the texts, as the rabbis have done throughout history. I have also heard positive responses, some from rabbis representing other communities, on the importance of preserving our tradition. This is very uplifting, and gives us strength to continue preserving our customs. One example: a Yemenite Jew who read the book told me that he regretted his grandmother was no longer alive, so that he might ask her about the customs of the Jews in Yemen. Since our aliyah, finally I feel proud to be a Jew. In Ethiopia I felt proud to be a Jew, but here I was always made to feel that our Judaism was in doubt, and that we were outcast refugees . . . ”",
            "Rabbi R. T. I.: “This is the first time that the halakhic and legal worlds have encountered an organized halakhic work, with citations and explanations, about Ethiopian Jewry. Until this book, no one has presented our tradition in Hebrew. From this aspect, this is a historical as well as a halakhic breakthrough. No one before him has ever done this.”",
            "Rabbi M. S. expressed opposition to the book. His main argument was that the book would lead to isolation of the community, while for the last thirty years, the community has integrated religiously. According to him, the book takes us backward in time. He explains his dissatisfaction: “Most painfully, the author is an Ethiopian rabbi, who should ideally act to connect the Ethiopians with the rest of the Jewish people. But here he is actually doing it a disservice. I have no doubt that the author’s intention was positive, but from my point of view, it has led to a negative result. As Rabbi Judah Halevi stated in the Kuzari, ‘Your intention is desirable, but your actions are undesirable.’ ”",
            "D. C.: Rabbi Shalom proposes a path beyond accepted halakhah, divided according to generations – the older generations should continue to follow the ancient customs, while the younger generations should gradually adopt mainstream halakhah. . . . In certain places in the book, Rabbi Shalom seems to be speaking in an apologetic tone. On one hand, he agrees that the Ethiopian community must move within a few generations to <i>pesika</i> (implementation or practical application of halakhah) based on the <i>Shulhan Arukh</i> (Ashkenazic, Sephardic, or similar). But against the insult and humiliation suffered by members of the older generation, who are unable to change their practice, he provides a proud and courageous defense. The book raises and addresses difficult questions that demand a broader platform – on the difference between the unity and the uniformity of the Jewish people. . . . But more than this, he gives the Ethiopian community reason to be proud of its customs, with the knowledge that the custom in the remainder of the Jewish world is different. The non-Ethiopian public will also be very interested in this book, and may achieve a better understanding of the customs of the Beta Israel community, which perhaps seem strange at first glance, but most of which rely on sound inner logic.”",
            "Y. S.: “First of all, I congratulate you on <i>From Sinai to Ethiopia</i>. Undoubtedly, this book is a precious asset and treasure for the entire Jewish people. In particular, it grants Ethiopian Jewry a place within Israeli society. In my opinion, the response that the book has generated in the various communities of the Jewish world is proof that the Jewish people are alive and well. You have made an impressive achievement in questioning. . . . I would like to encourage you, and to say thank you for the wonderful gift of your book.”",
            "At a conference about the book at Yad Ben Zvi Institute, Rabbi Dr. Daniel Sperber said: “The praise that the author of this book deserves is endless. Thanks to this book, a new field of study has been created surrounding the topic of Ethiopian Jewry. It must be studied, added to, and expanded, and most importantly – defended.”",
            "At the same event, Kes Samai Elias stated, “This evening, I am full of pride. In Ethiopia, during hundreds of years of journeys and hardships, we remained strong, because we preserved tradition that distanced us from assimilation and Christianity.” He added, “For thirty years, we have been trying to defend the assertion that we are Jews in the full sense of the word. Now Rabbi Sharon Shalom has arrived and put our community on the map, our customs in the center. Ethiopian Jews will continue to observe the traditions that our ancestors observed in Ethiopia. Even if other [Jews] do not accept this, they will have to live with it.”",
            "Rabbi Yosef Hadana, chief rabbi of Ethiopian Jewry, praised the book, but noted that “the Jewish community of Ethiopia came [to Israel] with sources and traditions, but in my opinion we must decide according to the <i>Shulhan Arukh</i>.”",
            "Rabbi Reuven-Tal Iasso, who sat on the panel at the event, said, “The real question is whether or not the Ethiopian community belongs to the Jewish people. If we follow those who believe that the Ethiopian Jews are not part of the Jewish people, then there is no reason to study their tradition. If we follow the opinion that the roots of the Ethiopian Jews are within the Jewish people, this changes the entire <i>pesika</i>. Rabbi Sharon Shalom has paved a new road. He has shaken the rabbinic world by forcing it to confront Ethiopian tradition in rabbinic language, the language of halakhah and Jewish law.”",
            "Rabbi Yehuda Brandes, head of Beit Morasha <i>beit midrash</i>, added, “One of the important points of this book is to prevent the ancient tradition of Ethiopian Jewry from being swallowed within the world of modern halakhah, which has undergone two thousand years of transformation. . . . Someone had to translate the Ethiopian language, and to state that Ethiopian tradition is not just folklore, but tradition.”",
            "To conclude the discussion, Shula Mula, chairman of the Israel Association for Ethiopian Jews (IAEJ), stated: “In my opinion, <i>From Sinai to Ethiopia</i> is the most important book I have ever encountered.” Shula shared her experience as a new immigrant who denied her tradition in order to blend in. “<i>From Sinai to Ethiopia</i> teaches us that we must not smother the practices we used to follow. We must not be embarrassed by the way we were educated. The book does not hide the arguments and the conflicts, but rather asserts that <i>elu ve-elu divrei Elokim hayim</i> – both of these are the words of the living God.”"

            "In the miracle of the ingathering of exiles that we have witnessed since the revival of the State of Israel, the most impressive event is the aliyah of the entire Beta Israel community from Ethiopia. This Jewish community was almost completely disconnected from the body of the Jewish people for two thousand years, to the extent that they forgot the holy language of Hebrew. However, they strictly preserved ancient traditions and practical mitzvot. Despite temptation on one side and torture on the other, this community adhered to its faith and to the hope of returning to Zion. Surprisingly, the aliyah to Israel of this community literally fulfilled the words of the prophet, “Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?” (Isaiah 60:8). Many lost their lives in the attempt to reach Israel, and could not fulfill the verse “When you pass through the waters, I will be with you, and through the rivers, they shall not overflow you; when you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned, neither shall the flame kindle on you” (Isaiah 43:2). The sacrifice of those who did not survive will stand forever in the merit of the entire Jewish people.",
            "However, the difficult trials have not yet ended. The absorption of the Ethiopian Jews into Israeli society raises particularly thorny issues, even more so than those faced by multiple immigrant groups from other countries. Some thought that we could bring in all the immigrants and combine them as in a pressure cooker, annulling the barriers and particular traditions of each group. This concept is invalid ethically and has proven impractical in Israeli life. We cannot expect believing Jews who are faithful to their own tradition to abandon the customs they inherited from their ancestors, all at once, and to adopt the manner of worshipping God and the way of life of one or another Jewish community, following recent rabbinic authorities. But undoubtedly, somehow we must reckon with the many fundamental <i>halakhot</i> that the Sages determined, and which bind the entire Jewish people.",

I observed close at hand how you labored at it, and how you searched for and compiled, with your characteristic thoroughness, the customs practiced by our brethren in Ethiopia. In the past generation, these fellow Jews have been permitted to make aliyah to the Holy Land, their ancient heart’s desire, and we, the rest of the Jewish people, have benefited from their return to live among us. Due to the long years of disconnection between those far off in the land of Cush and the remainder of exiled Jewry in distant lands, many of their customs are different from those of the remainder of Diaspora Jewry. As Ethiopian Jews are introduced to the customs that are common among their Jewish brethren, their original traditions are gradually disappearing.",
            "The river of explanation and documentation that springs from the fountain of Jewish custom divides into four streams, or four reasons for the importance of research and knowledge of customs.",
            "First: customs reflect ancient halakhic decisions. Although we may not know the identity of the <i>posek</i>, it is important to verify the underlying reasoning, as the Gaon Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, <i>ztz”l</i>, explained in detail in <i>Dibbrot Moshe</i>, Shabbat par. 10. Unique customs of a particular Jewish community require study of their origin, if we can identify it, as you have assiduously attempted to do in your book.",
            "Second: customs are a source of identity and belonging. Although most people do not usually know the true reasons for their customs, they characterize their life as individuals, families, and communities, and represent the infrastructure of ancestral tradition. An accurate concept of the “I” is an important foundation for worshipping God (see Rabbi Avraham Yitzhak Hacohen Kook, <i>Olat Ra’ayah</i>, on the prayer <i>Modeh ani lefanecha</i>). Therefore, as you have written, it is vital that Ethiopian Jews know themselves through the customs that their ancestors practiced.",
            "Third: Jewish customs differentiate between Jews and non-Jews. Our fellow Jews in Ethiopia were extremely careful not to intermingle with non-Jews, and not to marry non-Jewish women. Thus we have eternal appreciation for the customs that enabled our brethren to preserve their uniqueness and their Judaism throughout thousands of years of disconnection from the majority of the Jewish people.",
            "Fourth: accurate appreciation of these customs enables reexamination and adoption of necessary changes. It is very difficult to change a custom whose origins and reasons are unknown. Therefore, publicizing the customs and investigating the reasons behind them represents an important beginning on the basis of which we may correct what should be amended. The individual and the community should be moving forward, not standing in place.",
            "From all of the above aspects, your work is deserving of praise. May it be His will that your labor succeed, and that your work will open an ever-expanding space for acquaintance with the customs of a community that had disappeared from the view of most of our people. May we have the merit to observe the virtues of our brethren, and not their shortcomings.",

            "It is true that the Oral Torah was not available in written form. We had no books. Everything was passed from the spiritual leaders to the public, from parents to children. For this reason, we did not have clear, organized <i>halakhot</i>. We did have the written Torah, the entire Tanakh, and it was studied with great care. We did not use the terms “religious” and “non-religious.” Every Jew had to keep the Torah and mitzvot. Whoever did not keep Torah and mitzvot was considered a non-Jew. Each family had a connection to the <i>kes</i>. They accepted him as their spiritual father, and followed his instructions.",

They were the accepted authorities for all Ethiopian Jewry.",
            "<i>Shulhan ha-Orit</i>, which is written in clear, pleasant language as mentioned, describes many of the customs of Ethiopian Jewry, in a wise and well-informed manner. The author advances one step beyond the labor of collecting the customs. He compares them to <i>halakhot</i> in the Talmud, and thus offers a halakhic way to worship God for the generation of Ethiopian Jews living in Israel. Naturally, some Ethiopian Jews will disagree with one custom or another, because in their village they behaved differently. Some Ethiopian and non-Ethiopian Jews will question the method of halakhic decision making proposed by the author. Personally, when I read about the customs, I noticed, as a friend who respects the author, that some of the customs recorded here were practiced differently in Ambober. Following are several examples:",
            "Prayer: “Prayer was accompanied by . . . lying on the stomach and spreading the hands on the ground.” I visited many villages and participated in prayer services, but I never saw or heard that the Jews were praying in this manner.

It is unrelated to legumes such as peas or chickpeas, nor is it one of the five types of grain defined in halakhah. I checked about the appropriate blessing for before and after eating injera, and the conclusion is that it is like rice. Thus one should recite <i>borei minei mezonot</i> before eating it, and <i>Borei nefashot</i> afterwards.",
            "Beginning and end of Shabbat: Following a well-known custom among Ethiopian Jewry, shortly after noon on Friday, we cease all physical labor, such as field work, making clay pottery, weaving, and sewing. We make preparations for Shabbat until just before sundown. Then we douse the coals – “You shall not cause a fire to burn throughout your habitations on the Sabbath day” (Exodus 35:3). On Motzaei Shabbat we wait until the stars come out. After we see three stars, inside the home we prepare a new fire by rubbing two sticks together. We make a fire, and from it, each woman takes her own flame. When she enters her own home with the flame, each woman ululates and recites a special prayer for the coming week to be blessed and successful. She then begins to boil <i>buna</i>, coffee. On Motzaei Shabbat as well, women and men refrain from physical labor.",
            "Drinking wine: You wrote that there is a complete ban on drinking wine. In Ambober, we received matzot for Passover and bottles of wine for Seder night. On the evening of Seder night, after the holiday prayer service, the entire community went out of the synagogue to the courtyard and stood. The oldest of the <i>kesim</i> blessed the community and the matzot. He gave everyone pieces of matzah and a sip of wine in the cap of the bottle. People waited with excitement and great anticipation. No one ever asked if it was permitted to drink wine or not. Therefore, we should instruct members of the community to make Kiddush over ordinary wine, as in halakhah.",
            "Giving charity on Shabbat: In Ethiopia, certain communities used to give charity offerings on Shabbat. This custom originates in error and ignorance of the many <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat. The problem is not only giving money in synagogue, but also involves laws of <i>muktzeh</i>, carrying, and other issues. Therefore, every spiritual leader bears the pleasant obligation of explaining and instructing in order to annul this custom, even for the older generation. With regard to the halakhic decision, my opinion is that we should follow the <i>Shulhan Arukh</i>, like the majority of the Jews.",

            "This book is a first, a pioneer at the frontier of the field of halakhah. The world of halakhic decision making has a number of methods, of which I will note two. The <i>posek</i> can never be immune to the obstacles confronting him when he attempts to make practical halakhic decisions, as every method of <i>pesika</i> has its advantages and disadvantages.",
            "One method of halakhic decision making is:",
            "We begin with the original source (the oldest one), follow the issue to modern times, and then reach a practical halakhic conclusion. The problem is, a halakhah or custom that is found in ancient sources but missing in recent literature lacks status and validity. Is its absence in recent literature evidence that this custom was rejected from the body of Jewish tradition for various reasons? Or does its presence in the early and most ancient sources represent proof of its authenticity and status as practical halakhah? Further, under this method, the approach to oral tradition and custom is unclear.",
            "A second method of halakhic decision making is:",
            "We begin with the halakhah as practiced, and follow it backward in history to the most ancient source. The problem with this method is that it does not give expression to <i>halakhot</i> or customs that are absent from the ancient sources. What is the status and validity of such a custom? Does its absence from our ancient sources prove that it originated among foreign peoples (this has halakhic implications)? Further, when we cannot explain why the halakhah or custom no longer appears in the sources, should we assume that more recent generations objected to these sources, and decide according to the rule of <i>halakhah ke-batrai</i>, following the later authority?",
            "And under this method, what is the approach to oral traditions and ancient customs?",
            "In addition, we must ask, who are “our sources”? Ashkenazic customs are different from Sephardic ones, and so forth. And what about <i>halakhot</i> and customs of one community that conflict with customs of another community – can a custom of Middle Eastern Jewry conflict with and negate a custom or halakhah of Ashkenazic Jewry, and vice versa? Is the status of customs and <i>halakhot</i> practiced in the hassidic world (in its various streams) equivalent to the customs of other communities? In addition, we must inquire as to the customs of the Beta Israel community, whose unique practices are known from the period of the Ridbaz, and some of which are foreign to what is accepted today in the world of Talmudic tradition. May we view these customs as an integral, inseparable part of Jewish tradition? In general, is their status equivalent to that of other customs?",
            "Rabbi Sharon Shalom, light of Israel, has chosen the path of integration, searching for shared aspects that unify Ethiopian Jewish traditions with those of the general Jewish public. The advantage of this method is <i>shalom</i> (peace), like the author’s name – unity among Jews that stems from what is shared and connects, and little or almost no attention to what separates and opposes. I have known Rabbi Shalom closely for thirty years, and this is his path and worldview – the path of peace. He has chosen this path for good reason. In this work, we find methodical, consistent work of many years – this book was not written in one morning, nor in one week. We can also recognize that the individuals and authors that the author mentions and cites are people whom he has met over the years.",
            "In writing and publishing your book, Rabbi Shalom, you are privileged to fulfill the verse, “But your servants will cross over, all who are pioneers [<i>halutz</i>] in combat before the Lord, for the battle, as my master has spoken” (Numbers 32:27).",

            "I have reviewed the book <i>Shulhan ha-Orit</i>, and I was particularly inspired by its title. It has great significance, since our entire world of tradition in Ethiopia was based on the Orit and on a long history of oral tradition, which was passed from <i>kes</i> to <i>kes</i>, father to father, and generation to generation. In addition, when I made aliyah to Eretz Yisrael, I learned that Oraita in Aramaic means Torah, like Orit.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word <i>Orit</i> in Ge’ez means “Torah” (the Five Books of Moses). The scroll of the Torah is placed in the ark in the synagogue or in the home of the <i>kes</i>, and is read on holidays and festivals. Some use the term <i>Orit </i>to refer to the entire Tanakh. The Tanakh of Ethiopian Jewry includes all the books recognized as canonical by other Jewish communities, as well as non-canonical books.</i>",
            "This composition is very important. In a clear and exact manner, the author records the customs of our community that have been practiced for thousands of years. As soon as I received the book, I read it together with my children. It inspired them to ask questions, and I felt that finally I had a shared language with them. Thus I may say that this work brings together the younger generation, which was born and grew up in Israel, and the adult generation, which made aliyah. This book is a link that connects between past and present, a continuation of the long chain of our tradition, this time a written tradition. The fact that it is written has particular importance since until now, the tradition of Ethiopian Jewry was transmitted orally and thus was endangered due to the changes that the community is experiencing in Israel, our generation’s unwillingness to listen and learn, and the deep damage to the status of our spiritual leadership.",
            "Regarding the comparison to Ethiopian customs and Talmudic halakhah, I was pleased to discover that the similarities are greater than the differences, at least for the period close to when the Talmud was written, such as in the areas of family life and holidays. I was moved to learn that there are customs preserved in our tradition that the Talmudic tradition did not preserve, such as the Sigd holiday, a custom related to bride and groom, one day of Rosh Hashanah, and some Rosh Hodesh customs. When we research the issue, we find that all customs are derived from one origin. In actuality, today some of our customs are very different from what is practiced among other Jewish communities. Things are not so simple – such as the laws of <i>muktzeh</i>, <i>tumah ve-taharah</i> (ritual purity), burial, praying at the graves of the righteous, sexual relations on Shabbat, holidays, <i>brit milah</i> that falls on Shabbat. Most of these issues are covered in this work.",
            "The halakhah proposed by the author is an attempt to preserve the traditions we practiced in Ethiopia, but also to find a way to enable the new generation to preserve our tradition and at the same time, to become part of the Jewish people of Jerusalem.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jerusalem in Ethiopian tradition refers to all of Israel and is a spiritual reality that extends beyond the physical city of Jerusalem.</i> Truthfully, there is no reason to change anything. As a spiritual leader, I will continue to instruct according to the customs in Ethiopia, as this has been our tradition for thousands of years. Still, I am aware that we face significant difficulties and problematic questions. After reading this book together with my children, I believe that it offers a solution to this challenge. Despite the significant differences in certain areas between our traditions and Talmudic halakhah, this is the place to request that members of our community be permitted to continuing observing their customs. I ask for understanding, even though our customs may seem foreign and far from accepted practice. Just as there are many traditions here in Israel – Ashkenazic, Sephardic, and Yemenite – I believe that all of them are performed in the Name of Heaven. To return to Eretz Yisrael is the fulfillment of the vision of our prophets, and now we can continue to stride toward the coming of the Messiah, with mutual respect and understanding. We hope that we will have the merit to witness the rebuilding of the Temple. Because our community has preserved the customs of <i>tumah ve-taharah</i> as practiced in the Temple, undoubtedly we will be the ones to teach the rest of the Jewish people how to perform the Temple rituals.",
            "In conclusion, in these lines I wish to bless the esteemed Rabbi Sharon Shalom, <i>shlita</i>, who toiled in order to publish <i>Shulhan ha-Orit</i>, which describes the <i>halakhot</i> followed by Ethiopian Jewry before they made aliyah, and proposes a method for halakhic practice in Eretz Yisrael. This book will facilitate those who study the issues of Shabbat, <i>tumah ve-taharah</i>, and holidays, among others. Such books are worthy of publishing. I hope that his book will be accepted enthusiastically, and I wish him success in all his endeavors. May all his efforts be blessed, <i>she-yizkeh le-hagdil Torah u-le-ha’adirah –</i> May he be privileged to teach and to strengthen the study of Torah.",

            "I have seen the book <i>Shulhan ha-Orit</i>, which describes the customs of our community, the Jews of Ethiopia. I did not read it, but I have heard it described by the author, my son, Rabbi Sharon Shalom. I listened closely to his explanation of the contents, and I emphasize that it is a blessed act, as these customs were our way of worshipping God. These customs are very special, and we have an emotional connection to them – they are our life. Through our prayers, we have succeeded in reaching God. These customs breathed life into us; they are like the pillar of fire and pillar of cloud that guided the Israelites on their journey from Egypt to Jerusalem. Thus my son Rabbi Sharon has achieved a great deed. I was pleased to see this book, and very moved. It has also given me new inspiration to study and pass down our tradition to the younger generation. I am certain that many will refer to this book. I therefore bless my son, Rabbi Sharon: May He who has blessed our ancestors bless you as well. As Moses the Prophet and Aharon the Kohen were able to guide the Israelites, so may you merit through this work to be a guide for the many. Amen."
