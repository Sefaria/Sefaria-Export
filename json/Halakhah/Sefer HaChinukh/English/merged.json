        "Author's Introduction": [
            "<b>Introduction of the Rabbi, the author of the Sefer Hachinukh</b>",
            "The clear truth in the human species is that which most people in the world have agreed about - and the opinion of all people has already agreed with it - to believe the testimony of people. And with the proliferation of those testifying about a thing about which they are testifying, the thing is more established in the eyes of its hearers. And in those testifying being few, a bit of doubt develops in the thing for those that are sharp. And this matter has become so strong among people to the point that they fixed it in the practices of each and every nation to kill a man according to the testimony of two or three witnesses. And since three is more honored [than two], the perfect Torah also [mentioned it]. And from this reason also did the opinion of all agree to accept from the mouths of the testimony of their fathers, their elders, about that which they tell them that happened in their days or in the days of their fathers or in the days of the fathers of their fathers. And there is no doubt that in the fathers testifying being many - and in the ones that the event happened in their days being many - the thing is strengthened in the hearts of the children that hear [it]. Therefore when God wanted to give the Torah to His people, Israel, He gave it to them in the eyes of six hundred thousand adult men, besides the many infants and women, that they all be believable witnesses about the things. Also in order that the testimony be stronger and more believable, they all merited prophecy [at that time]. As doubt never develops about that which one knows by way of prophecy. And that is [the meaning of] that which God said to Moshe, \"in order that the people hear My speaking to you, and they also believe in you forever\"   (Exodus 19:9) - meaning to say, they and their children will believe in you and your prophecy forever. As they will then know [with] a trustworthy knowledge that God speaks with a man and he can live, and that all of your prophecy is true. And had it not been that they merited prophecy, a claimant could have argued about all of the signs that Moshe did in the eyes of Pharaoh and in their eyes and said, \"Who knows if he did it with machinations of the wisdom of demons or with the power of the names of the angels. And even though the wise men of Egypt and all of its magicians, who were more expert in the wisdom of demons and magic than all the rest of the world, conceded to Moshe against their will and said to Pharaoh that it it was through the power of God that he did [it] - as it is written (Exodus 8:15), \"it is the finger of God\" - nonetheless, one who wants to be stubborn will say it was from his greater wisdom that he did it and they conceded to him. But after the prophecy, no type of hesitation remained about the matter. And [so] they knew clearly that all of the events were done by the command of the Master of the world, and that everything come to them from His hand. And they - who saw with their eyes and knew the thing with a true knowing that people do not have any stronger truth than this - testified to their children that were born afterwards that all the words of the Torah, from the [first letter] <i>bet</i> of the [first word], <i>Bereshit</i> to the <i>lamed</i> [at the end of the final words] <i>le'einei kol Yisrael</i>, that they received from Moshe in the eyes of all of Israel were true and clear without any hesitation in the world. And their children also testified to their children and their children to their children until [it reached] us. It comes out that the Torah that is in our hands is a true Torah according to six hundred thousand believable witnesses - which is the tally that includes all the opinions of the men, besides the infants and the women. And now if a seducer, 'whose heart turns away from the Lord, our God,' would claim to us and say, \"What is it with you, Jew-man, and your tradition? And what is with you to 'ask your father and your elder?' Investigate and search well with your intellect and establish your reasoning. 'Open your eyes and see' what is in your world - the movement of the sphere and the four basic elements of the land. From them you will you will see and understand the hidden things of wisdom. And investigate with your reason and you shall learn how the One unified\"; we would [then] respond to him: From the angle of our investigation, we could never grasp anything of the word of God. As even in matters of the lowly world, all the wise men of science have not been able to come to fullness [of understanding]. As through the wisdom of investigation, who will reveal the mystery of the grasses and the fruit, the mystery of precious stones and vegetables and the cause of the movement of iron with magnetic rocks? As all of the wise men of science and all the men of understanding have stood wondering [about these things].  Even more [would they not be helpful] if we would say to understand from them the glorious wisdoms and the knowledge of God's existence. God forbid for us, God forbid, to come behind the King in our arrogance and to raise our hand and to think thoughts from that which is above our thoughts and for which we have no need. As behold our ancestors, may their memory be blessed, set up a table in front of us - they probed deeply and they come to the fullness of true knowledge. They grasped knowing that God speaks to a man and he can live. And [hence] what is it to us after this to investigate and to examine if the truth is with them? Rather [it is] for us to drink their words with thirst, according to their words and according to their expressions. And the parable for this is one to whom it has been testified by thousands of thousands of people to not drink from the waters of a river, because they have seen these waters kill its drinkers. And the thing was experienced a thousand times at different time periods and with people [from] different lands. And a sage expert physician said to him, \"Do not believe all of them, as I am informing you from the perspective of wisdom that these waters are not fitting to kill, since they are clear and light and the dirt that goes through them is goodly. Drink them until your soul is satiated.\" Would it be good for this one to leave the famous testimony of all and to do like the words of the sage? Truly the matter is not good and an intelligent person will not listen to him and will not do like his words. This is the matter that we have prefaced - that the truth of matters of the world is known by the multitude of people that testify about it more than by those that prove their words from the angle of their intellect and investigation. Since because man is lacking perfection, his intellect does not grasp the fullness of things. And therefore the chosen path is for a man to fulfill all the words of the Torah, which was received by trustworthy witnesses, which the Master of wisdom gave to people. And in it is included all precious knowledge and all glorious wisdom.",
            "And [maybe] one would ask, \"What is the matter that God gave such a precious Torah to people? Does not God have everything, and there is no measure to His elevation and to His glory? And there is no addition to His glory from the knowing of men of the power of His deeds; as there can be no addition or subtraction to complete glory and majesty on account of something [else]. The answer to this is obvious: That the mind of people does not grasp the ways of his Creator to know what is the reason for His deeds; as higher are 'His ways than our ways and His thoughts than our thoughts.' And even though the reason for the thing is not revealed to us, we should believe that the Father of wisdoms, the Master of all, does everything that He does for a purpose and for a positive matter. And nonetheless it is possible for us to find a little reason and to say that people's knowledge of the ways of God is necessitated by His loftiness, may He be blessed. As since it came up in His thought in front of Him to create the world, it is fitting that it be with complete perfection - since all of the acts of the Perfect One are perfect. And this is the truth, since Blessed be He was perfect in everything, as nothing is lacking from Him, such that a man could say, \"Why did He not do this in His world?\" As he knows His advantage over him in wisdom. As behold, He created separated intellects in His world - and they are the angels. And He also created intellects in permanent bodies - and they are the heavens and all of their hosts. And He created physical bodies without any intellect at all in the world - and they are the beasts and the birds and the other species that are similar to them. And he also created physical creatures with intellect - and that is the human species - to make known that that nothing is prevented from Him (He can do anything). As even though the physical and the intellect are complete opposites, He mixed them together in the greatness of His wisdom and made man with them. And if so, it was nonetheless necessary that this intellect mixed with the physical - and that is man - know his Creator and recognize Him, so as to fulfill the intention of his creation. And if it were not for the Torah that He gave him, the intellect would be completely drawn to the physical in all of its desires, and he would be 'compared in similarity to beasts.' And as such, the work would not be perfected, since the body of a man and the body of a beast would be one in the matter - even if they are not one in their form - and it would come out that there is a lack in the creation. And it comes out according to our words that the giving of the Torah to educate the hearts of men is necessitated for the perfection of the designs. And [perhaps] one might ask further, \"Since it is the perfection of the designs, why was it given to one people from the peoples of the world, and not to all of them?\" In this also would it be an obvious answer to respond that the intellect of the one designed will not grasp the intention of his Designer. But nonetheless with this too is it possible to find a little reason according to the way of the world: Is it not known that in all the things of the world, the chaff is greater than the core? And even in the core, there is a part of it that is more select in it than the whole. It is as if you would say most of the land in the world is not prime, but rather only its minority. But even in the prime, part of it is the prime of the prime. And so is the matter also with the fruits of the world and with types of beasts and fowl. And, if so, also with the human species shall the thing be like this, to make it similar to the lowly world. Since it shares some of itself with it - as it has a finite body like them - it is no wonder about the thing. And so one part of the human species was chosen - and that is Israel, and it is the 'smallest from all the nations.' And blessed is God who knows that they are the choicest of the human species and chose them to be called His people and gave them all the main parts of wisdom. However even with the rest of the human species, He gave them a way to distinguish themselves from beasts - and that is the seven commandments that all the people of the world were commanded as a whole, as we shall write about each one of them, with God's help. And also with the people of Israel itself - part of them are more choice, and that is the tribe of Levi, which was chosen for His permanent service. And so [too,] is the thing with planet Earth, that there is a part of it that is choicest from all of it and God knew that the choicest in it is the Land of Israel. And [so] His will was to settle the choicest of the Human species in it. Also in it, the best in it was Jerusalem. And so it was chosen to be the dwelling of the Torah and place of his Service. And from it is the entire planet of the earth blessed, as God commanded blessing to be there. And perhaps one would ask further - since I said that the essence of all, and the chosen portion, is the people of Israel - how is the thing that they always suffer exile and troubles? And the answer is that it is well-known and famous among the people of the world that the Master of all created two worlds - the world of bodies and the world of souls. And the world of bodies is considered like nothing and emptiness in contrast to the world of souls. As this one is like a passing shadow, whereas that one remains forever and ever. And the body serves as a vessel for the soul for a short time, and afterwards it decomposes and becomes vile. [Accordingly,] God bequeathed to His people the world of souls, which is the eternal world and the enjoyment of which has no measure. And perhaps one who asks would ask further, \"And why did God not give to His people, that He chose, two portions of enjoyment - the world of bodies and the world of souls?\" The answer is that it is well-known to every intelligent person that it is impossible for a physical being to be in the world without sinning. And among the fixed traits forever and ever of God, blessed be He, is the trait of justice; and it obligates every intelligent person to go in the way of the intellect and to be liable when he veers [from it]. And once the trait of justice has made him liable, it is impossible for him to be exempted without any [punishment]; since he left the court of the trait of justice [with a] guilty [verdict]. And hence it is from the kindnesses of God to us that He placed our share to have sin purged from us in this finite world, [so that] our souls be clean and survive to the world of souls; as one hour there is better than all of the life in this world. However we should believe that a time will come that we will merit the two portions, and that is the days of the messiah. And the reason is that in those days, we will not need the purging of the bodies at all, since the evil impulse will be nullified from us; as it is written (Ezekiel 36:26), \"and I will remove the heart of stone, etc.\" And also if a little dross of sin remains at that time, it will fall on the goat (sacrificed scapegoat), as at the beginning. And this is what is written in the Torah (Leviticus 26:4), \"If you will go in My ways,\" I will bequeath the good of this world to you - meaning to say, if you will be whole and not require purging of the body, you will also merit the good of this world. And that is what is written about our father, Avraham - peace be upon him - that God blessed him, even with the good of this world. As he did not need purging of the body at all at that time. And after this, there is no [cause] to wonder about the pain of Israel in the exiles more than all of the nations; as it is all for their good and for their glory. And you who asks - place your eyes and your heart to this as it is a big thing that all of the evildoers will not understand, but the intelligent will understand. As many of of the Jews are destitute from the many great troubles that follow [one another against] them in the exiles and they do not know nor understand the good of the world of souls - their 'feet almost strayed' from the many worries, and 'their hearts were not constant with them' from the many ruminations. May God, in His kindnesses, remove thoughts of wickedness and impart upon us proper intellect and correct opinions to fulfill His desire - amen, may He do so. And he may ask further, \"Since you said that the essence of all is the world of the souls and the final reward of commandments is in it, why did the Torah not mention it and state, 'When you do My commandments, I will bequeath you the world to come.'\" The answer is because the matter of the world to come is well-known and revealed to all intelligent people and clear as the sun. There is no people nor language that do not agree that there is permanence to souls after the termination of the bodies. And there is also no one that disagrees that it is according to the good of the soul, its wisdom and the propriety of its actions, that its enjoyment will be greater. As the source of the intellectual soul from which it is extracted is the Intellect, and anyone that comes closer to its nature - the place of its extraction - will have greater pleasure. These words do not require support with proofs and witnesses - they are their own witnesses and their proofs are basic knowledge. And so the Torah never elaborates about that which is well-known from human logic. And this is [the meaning] of their, may their memory be blessed, saying in every place, \"It is logical\" - meaning, there is no need for a verse about that which logic reveals. And hence the Torah promised us with the fulfillment of the commandments in this world to say that we not be preoccupied with sustenance and with wars [against] the enemies and that we be able to put efforts into the service of God and fathom His will. And there is no need to elaborate further and to say, \"And when you accomplish His will, you will merit the pleasure of the world to come\" - since the thing is self-evident that any creature that accomplishes the will of his Creator, may He be elevated, approaches Him and will enjoy from His radiance. And another reason [for this] is that if the Torah had promised about the reward of the world to come and not this one, the promise would not have been seen while [people are still] alive; and the heart of those of little faith may have disturbed [them] with words.",
            "And from the fundamentals of this Torah that we said that God gave to His people through Moshe, His prophet, is to know that the Lord God in the Heavens that gave the Torah to Israel is the First Being - such that there is no beginning nor end to His being, may He be blessed - and that He made exist and created from His will and His power all that was created, ex nihilo. And [likewise] that He keeps in existence everything that He created the whole time that He wishes, but no longer - [not] even an instant. And that He is not prevented from doing anything. And [also from the fundamentals is] to believe that He is one without any conjunction; to believe that in a man fulfilling that which is written in [the Torah], his soul will merit great enjoyment forever; and to believe that God oversees the actions of people and knows all the details of their deeds and repays everyone according to his action. And also from the fundamentals of the Torah is to believe that the true explanation of the Torah is the traditional received explanation that is in our hands from the early Sages of Israel. And anyone who explains about it something that is the opposite of their intention is [expressing] a mistake and a completely void thing. As our Sages received the explanation of the Torah from our teacher, Moshe - peace be upon him - who received it from God, blessed be He, when he stood on the mountain forty days. And even though it was possible to learn [it] in less time than this due to the power of the Teacher, God wanted to hint to the learners that they learn it with deliberation. And this true explanation that we wrote is the explanation that is written in the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds (Gemara), which [was] composed [by] our early Sages, who received it one generation after another from our teacher Moshe, peace be upon him. And the Babylonian is lengthier and more elucidated, and [so] we rely upon it more. And it is made up of six orders, and there are sixty tractates in it, according to the division of the contents. Their mnemonic is 'there are sixty queens.' And there are five hundred and twenty-two chapters. And the true explanation of the Torah is likewise elucidated from other books that some of our early Sages composed. And [these books] are called Sifra, Sifrei, Tosefta and Mekhilta. All of these are books that all of Israel believe and [they] rely upon the words of theirs which are there without a disagreement. And about those that there is a disagreement, they have already also explained the ruling that we should take from them. Everything is nicely elucidated without any doubt or confusion to those that understand. And anyone whose heart troubles him about these matters is not included in the holy (Jewish) people - since we would never agree about the truth from the simple understanding of the verses of the Torah without their explanations and their true tradition. As there are several verses in the Torah that appear to contradict one another. But the one who knows their explanation understands and sees that the ways of God are straight: Behold it is written in the Torah (Exodus 12:40), \"And the inhabitation of the Children of Israel [which they dwelt in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years].\" And [yet] we found that Kehat the son of Levi was from those that went down to Egypt; and if you count the days of his life and the years of the life of Amram, his son, and the eighty years of Moshe - as he was eighty in his standing in front of Pharaoh to speak to him to take out the Children of Israel from Egypt - they all only add up to three hundred and fifty years. However the explanation of this is that the tally of four hundred and thirty begins from the time that it was stated to Avraham, \"that your seed will be a stranger\" (Genesis 15:13). And the explanation of the verse is thus: \"And the inhabitation of the Children of Israel which they dwelt in Egypt\" and other lands - meaning that they began to be exiled - \"was four hundred and thirty years.\" As from the time that it was stated to Avraham, \"that your seed will be a stranger,\" did the distress begin for him - and [so] the beginning of the tally is from there. And do not let its stating, \"the Children of Israel,\" be difficult for you - as behold they said in the Midrash (Bereshit Rabbah 63:3), \"Avraham is called Israel, as it is stated, 'And the inhabitation of the Children of Israel.'\" And that which it states, \"the Children of Israel\" is meaning to say the Children of Israel and Israel (referring to Avraham); but Scripture expressed it in this language since the distress began to the father with the proclamation of the exile of the children. And that which it is stated, \"Egypt,\" is also not specific, but rather meaning to say in exile. And that which it expressed it all with the [word,] Egypt, is because the core of the exile was there; and everything goes according to the core, and it is always called by it. And so [too,] is it written in the Torah (Deuteronomy 10:22), \"With seventy souls did your forefathers go down to Egypt.\" But when you count their enumeration, you find [only] sixty-nine souls. But rather the explanation (Bava Batra 123b) comes that Yocheved was born 'betwixt the walls' (of Egypt, though she was conceived before they arrived), and [so] was not counted in the enumeration. And likewise, one verse (Exodus 12:15) states, \"Seven days shall you eat matsot\" and one verse (Deuteronomy 16:8) states, \"Six days.\" And many like this would not be elucidated without the traditional explanation that is in our hands, that was given to us from our teacher, Moshe. ",
            "And now, you should know that according to what we have received from our Sages, may their memory be blessed and from their explanations, the tally of commandment that are practiced for [all of] the generations that are included in the Book of the Torah that God gave to us adds up to six hundred and thirteen commandments - between the commandments that it commanded us to do and those that it warned us not to do, as they are all called commandment[s]. And those that it commanded us to do add up to two hundred and forty-eight; and to not do, three hundred and sixty-five. And some of them are [those] that all of Israel are obligated - including males and females - at all times and in every place. And some of them are [those] that only Israelites are obligated in every place and at all times, but not priests and Levites. And some of them are [those] that only Levites alone are obligated; and some of them are [those] that only priests alone are obligated - in every place and at all times. And among the commandments, there are those that a person is obligated to do constantly, such as the commandment of loving God, and fearing Him, and that which is similar to it. And there are some that he is obligated to do at a specific time and not before then - such as the commandment of sukkah (dwelling in a hut), lulav, resting on the holidays, recitation of Shema and all that is similar to them - that have a set time to do them in the year or in the day. And there are some of them that a person is never obligated to do unless he is caused by a matter that comes to his hand that requires that commandment that is fitting for that matter. Such that you can say that giving the wage of a wage-worker in its time is a commandment, while a man is certainly not obligated to hire workers in order to fulfill this commandment. And so [too,] some that are like this - as we shall clarify it all, with God's help, about every commandment that we write. And one of the commandments is the root and principle that all lean upon - and that is Torah study - as through study will a person know the commandments and fulfill them. And hence our Sages, may their memory be blessed, fixed for us to read a portion of the Book of the Torah each and every week in the place of the gathering of people - which is the synagogue - to arouse the heart of a man about the words of the Torah and the commandments, until they finish the whole Book. And according to that which we heard, most of Israel today practices reading it all in one year. And the Sages, may their memory be blessed, further obligated us that every one of Israel read it in his home each and every week in the way that we read it in the place of gathering. And that is [the meaning of] their, may their memory be blessed, saying (Berakhot 8a), \"A person should always finish his sections with the community\" - so that he understand things better with his reading them at home. And now since the six hundred and thirteen commandments are dispersed in the Book, scattered in it, here and there, in different stories that are written in the Book - for a great principle or for the need that is to be found in it - the reader will perhaps not place his heart in the [weekly reading] to see how many commandments he read that week; and he will not arouse his heart to urge himself about them. Hence I - 'the poorest of my thousand,' a student of the students in my time, a Jew from the House of Levi in Barcelona - saw it good to write the commandments by way of the [weekly] orders and in the order that they are written in the Torah, one after the other. [This is] to arouse the heart of the youth - my son and his friends - each and every week about the tally of the commandments after they study that [reading]. And [this is also in order] to accustom them to [the commandments] and to attach their thoughts to the thought of purity; and to the calculation of the essential, before they put in their hearts, calculations of joking and 'what is it to you,' and of 'what is the point.' And [so] 'even when they age, it will not depart from them.' And my [thought] is to write about each one a hint of the roots of (reason for) the commandment - when it is revealed in Scripture, I will write it as it is; and when it is hidden, I will say what I have heard about it from the mouth of sages and that which I understand about the things. And I do not think and insist to get to the truth regardless - as who 'is a worm and not a man,' like I, who did not see the lights of wisdom all of the days, to raise the hand about that which wizened sages have not grasped. I have not, however, lacked intelligence to know that ants cannot carry the load of camels; and [that] a 'child that does not know to Whom we recite blessings' should not expound about the 'Story of the Chariot,' and the secret of the <i>chasmalim</i>. Except that the greatness of my desire 'to dip the tip of the staff into the honeycomb' of the commandments has pushed me to enter the forest that has no limits, with my awareness that many great ones who entered there brought out [only] charcoals. However I said, \"Who will give that my thought be preoccupied with this all of the days - and not be disqualified and not rendered defective by the intrigues 'of travail and sorrow,' like the guilty evildoers - and that I place them 'as a signet ring upon my right hand,' and that I put all of my wellsprings all of the day in their work. I shall make a faithful house in my heart, a strong dwelling. And the rest of all my deeds - eating, drinking and the occupation of men and women - their time is enough for them. Are [the commandments] not all refined and pure - 'every precious stone is their adornment.' And if there sometimes be sediment in that which is written in their explanation, the food should be separated from it for oil, and [sediment] returned to the house of the owners. And let the one who wants to eat with me, 'eat the meat and leave the bones and peels on the table.'\" And at the beginning of my words, I mention as a merit for me that which my teachers said, \"All chatter is bad, [but] Torah chatter is good.\" And they, may their memory be blessed, further expounded to strengthen the heart of the learner, \"His skipping is love to Me, his stuttering is love to Me\" (Shir HaShirim Rabbah 2:4). And these [readings] of the year in which the commandments are [found] is according to the calculation of the great Rabbi, known for his great wisdom and stature among his people, Rambam - may the memory of the righteous be blessed."

        "Opening Letter by the Author": [
            "A letter from the author of the Sefer HaChinukh",
            "Perhaps one who delves into this book will think that its author gathered all of its laws in his effort and his good research from the words of the Tannaim (early Talmudic sages) and the Amoraim (later Talmudic sages). And if this were so, it would require that the author be an expert in all of the corners of our Gemara - the Babylonian and the Jerusalem [Talmuds], the Sifra, the Sifri and the Tosefta. Hence he who knows himself and what wisdom he has is fitting to publicize the truth to all who listen to his voice. And he should not make the unblemished craft of God into 'a bow of duplicity' and trickery, as one who is glorified 'by the children of foreigners,' as a weak one that arms himself with 'the shields of the mighty,' as a lowly one among men who crowns himself with the crowns of kings. Behold he calls - from his place he informs and testifies with trustworthy testimony to all readers that the majority of the words of the book are taken from the books of the pillars of the world that are famous in stature and wisdom from all of the nations: Rabbi  Yitschak Alfasi (Rif) and Rabbi Moshe bar Maimon (Rambam), they should be remembered for the good. 'The statute of the first-born,' the glory and the greatness in this book is theirs. And [also] upon the 'three fold string' in wisdom, understanding and knowledge is Rabbi Moshe bar Nachman, may his memory be blessed. He composed a very esteemed book about the tally of the commandments besides several, several precious compositions. These are the 'mighty ones from yore' who spent most of their time clarifying the words of the Sages, blessed is their memory. They 'plunged into the powerful waters' and brought up pearls in their hands from the words of the Gemara. And the day that we came to their sanctuary and to the room of their instruction, we found 'a well of living waters,' gardens and orchards, loaves and vessels of cloth' set up there. I said, \"With what would it be pleasing to serve in front of the mighty ones, as they have already clarified all the things for us? Would it not be in ordering the six hundred and thirteen commandments according to the [weekly readings]? Perhaps the youths will be more stimulated in them from this; they will put their hearts into them on Shabbat and holidays; and return from going crazy in the plaza of the cities, 'to the light of the living light.' The delicate children will ask, 'one to his neighbor,' 'How many are the commandments of this Shabbat,' and the land will be full of 'knowledge and foresight.' And behold the explanation of each one is arranged in front of them, and without toil will they find pleasing words in their listings. The holy seed will be blessed from God - 'they and their children and all that they have in all of the places of their dwellings.' And I will be included in the blessing with them.\" And I bring an oath with the ineffable name [of God] upon any transcriber [of this book], that he write this letter at its beginning - and [so] life and peace shall be with him - in order that all will give its splendor and its glory to its bearer and its parent. And may one who corrects any error after concentrated investigation receive his full compensation from the Omnipresent God. And let there be peace upon Israel, amen. ",
            "There are commandments that are practiced today and, all counted, they are three hundred and sixty nine. And from these that are practiced, there are some that a person only be obligated in them by a cause. And sometimes the cause will never come to a person all of his days, such that it will come out that he never do [that commandment] - such as the commandment of giving the wage to a wage-worker on its day, and that which is similar to it; as there are people that will never employ a wage-worker [all] their days. And so [too,] from the negative commandments, there are some of them that a person not be obligated without his will, and through the cause of his deeds. And with his avoiding that deed, there will not be any sin to him and nothing will be lacking from him. For example, one who puts out a bad name [on his wife], that he may never divorce his wife - as he caused it to himself to be obligated in this negative commandment, as he is the one who put out a bad name. And so [too,] with the negative commandment of \"do not delay\" with vows, it is also he who causes it. And one who refrains from vowing will not have a sin. And so, all that is similar to this. And, all counted, they are ninety-nine, from which there are seventy-eight positive commandments and twenty-one negative commandments. But the commandments that every man of Israel is commanded without his creating a cause for it in the world are, all counted, two hundred and seventy.

Forty-eight of them are positive commandments and two hundred and twenty-two are negative commandments. And you will find each one in its [weekly reading] in the book. And the obligation with them is not at all times, but rather at specific times of the year or of the day - except for six commandments, the obligation of which is constant. It does not cease from being upon a man even an instant in all of his days. And these are them: 1) to believe in God; 2) to not believe in anything besides Him; 3) to conceive of His oneness; 4) to love Him; 5) to fear Him; and 6) to not wander after the thought of the heart and the vision of the eyes.

Likewise, this commandment includes the commandment of intercalation, since the basis of the commandment to sanctify the month is for Israel to observe God's holidays at their appointed times. And the commandment of intercalation has the same basis. However, beyond this verse are more Torah passages concerning the commandment of intercalation, and that is what is written (Exodus 13:10), \"You shall observe this commandment in its proper time\"; and likewise, \"Observe the month of Spring\" (Deuteronomy 16:11).",
                "The content of the commandment is that two Jews fit to testify come before the court and testify before them that they saw the renewed moon. [The judges then] establish the new month on the basis of their [testimony] and say, \"Today has been sanctified.\" The reason why this commandment applies only with ordained judges is because it came with the explanation [of the verse], \"This month shall be for you\" - great [in Torah] and ordained, like you (Rosh Hashanah 22a), since it was said to Moshe and Aharon. This matter was further expounded, as it is juxtaposed to \"speak to the entire congregation of the children of Israel,\" meaning that they who sanctify the month must have the assent of all Israel, meaning the wisest men of Israel, such as the Great Court (the Sanhedrin). And so [too] any great sage in Israel who was ordained in the Land of Israel. And since ordination is no longer practiced, as is known, [the sage] has permission to perform this commandment even outside the Land of Israel, so long as there is no one of his stature in the Land of Israel. And so we find that Chananiah ben Achai, Rabbi Yehoshua, and Akiva ben Yosef did so in this regard (Berakhot 23a). But without these conditions, no one of Israel is permitted to establish the months or intercalate. And perhaps you will ask, \"If so, how do we conduct ourselves today, when we lack ordained sages?\" Know that so have we received it; since Rabbi Hillel the Prince, son of Rabbi Yehudah the Prince, who was the greatest of his generation and ordained in the Land of Israel - he was the sage who fixed for us the calculation of intercalation, sanctified future months, and intercalated future [months into] years until the coming of Eliyahu, and it is upon this that we rely today. That which we have said all follows the opinion of Rambam. However, Ramban (in the Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Ase 153), considers the sanctification of the month as one commandment and intercalation a separate commandment. His proofs (for dividing these into two separate commandments are) in his Book of Commandments. And so [too] the Ba'al Halakhot (considers these separate commandments). And the verse that teaches about the commandment of intercalation, that is, that we calculate the seasons in order to make the holidays in their (proper,) established times, is \"You shall observe this commandment in its proper time,\" (Exodus 13:10) and so, \"Observe the month of Spring,\" (Deuteronomy 16:11) as we have written.",

Due to the ripening of the produce and fruit from the power of the sun, it turns out that but for intercalation - by which we align the lunar and solar years - Pesach would not come in the Spring, nor Sukkot at the time of the harvest. And this matter is to be fixed by the greatest [sages] of the generation, since it is a matter requiring great wisdom. And since it is also said that from this [calculation, one comes to know] the agricultural happenings of the year, it is appropriate to give [this task] only to great and pious men.",

[We learn this from the] verse, [which] states, 'from year to year' (<i>yamim yemima</i>, literally from day to day) (Sanhedrin 10b); and they, may their memory be blessed, further expounded, \"'For the months of the year' (Exodus 12:2) - it is months you calculate towards the year, not days\" (Megillah 5a); furthermore did they say on this matter, \"'A month of days' (Numbers 11:20), it is days you calculate towards the month, not hours\" (Megillah 5a); and the rest of its details - are [all] elucidated in Tractate Rosh Hashanah, and in the first chapter of Sanhedrin, and similarly in Berakhot (see Mishneh Torah, Laws of Sanctification of the New Month 1).",

As it is stated (Exodus 12:20), \"All that is leavened shall you not eat\" - and they, may their memory be blessed, explained (Pesachim 43a) that the subject of the verse instructs about this; as so did they receive the understanding about it. And the opinion of Rambam (Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Lo Taase 198), may his memory be blessed, is that if there is in these foods a <i>kazayit</i> (the size of a large olive) of chamets [that is eaten] in the time it takes to eat a <i>peras</i> (a half-loaf of bread), it is forbidden by the Torah as a negative commandment - meaning to say for lashes, but not for excision, since it is mixed with a majority [of non-chamets products]. But if there is not in them a <i>kazayit</i> of chamets [that is eaten] in the time it takes to eat a <i>peras</i>, there are no [formal] lashes, but rather [just] lashes of rebellion - as it is only prohibited rabbinically. And so is it written in his great essay (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1:6). And if so - according to his opinion - this prohibition of \"All that is leavened\" comes when a <i>kazayit</i> of chamets [that is eaten] in the time it takes to eat a <i>peras</i>, is mixed in. [This is such] that there should be a negative commandment - meaning to say [for] lashes, not excision. And Ramban, may his memory be blessed, wrote the opposite of this (on Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Lo Taase 198) and said that this negative commandment is not considered [a separate commandment] among the negative commandments, but rather is one of the many negative commandments [included in the prohibition] of leaven and chamets. And this prohibition (of \"All that is leavened\") is coming to teach about that which the Sages, may their memory be blessed, said in the Gemara (Pesachim 28b), \"I only have if it became leavened on its own. From where [do I know] if it became leavened due to another substance? [Hence] we learn to teach, 'All that is leavened.'\" But concerning chamets that is mixed, anytime there is a <i>kazayit</i> of chamets [that is eaten] in the time it takes to eat a <i>peras</i>, there is no need for a separate negative commandment about it - as behold, it is as if it is intact, and it [comes with] excision. And if there is not a <i>kazayit</i> of chamets [that is eaten] in the time it takes to eat a <i>peras</i>, one who eats it is exempt [from the prohibition], but [still doing something] forbidden. As the law is like the words of the sages (Pesachim 43a) that said [that] on complete leavened grain products, one is punished with excision. And anything that is a <i>kazayit</i> of chamets [that is eaten] in the time it takes to eat a <i>peras</i> is called a complete leavened grain product. And about its mixture - meaning less than a <i>kazayit</i> of chamets [that is eaten] in the time it takes to eat a <i>peras</i> - [there] is no [prohibition].

Because from the good actions we are acted upon to be good and merit eternal life.

And after they ate from the vegetable in charoset (a thick sweet dip), we pour a second cup and read the Haggadah with two chapters of Psalms and recite the blessing, \"who has redeemed us, etc.,\" upon the second cup, and we drink it. And we do not recite the blessing, \"who creates the fruit of the vine,\" upon it, nor \"upon the vine,\" after it. And after they drink the second cup, we wash our hands and recite the blessing, \"upon the washing of the hands.\" And [then] we take half of a matsah and we place it on the complete one and recite the blessing upon the half, \"who brings forth\" and \"to eat matsah.\" And we take bitter herbs and we recite the blessing, \"to eat marror,\" and eat from it dipped in charoset; but we do not recite the blessing, \"who creates the fruit of the ground,\" upon it, since he is exempted by the blessing that he recited upon the vegetable at the beginning. As this is how it is concluded in the Gemara (Pesachim 103b) - that it is never [considered] an interruption unless there is [one of] two things: That he removes his thoughts from the matter - for example when they say, \"Let us bless (say Grace after the Meal),\" and similar to it. And also that [he be engaged in something else, such] that it not be possible to do the two things together - for example that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Chullin 87a and Rashi there), \"Drinking and blessing together is not possible.\" And after we eat from the marror with the dip, we wrap some of it on top of matsah and eat a little bit, in memory of the Pesach sacrifice that was eaten upon satiation. And we do not eat more the whole night, so as not to remove the taste of matsah from the mouth; as it is written (Psalms 113:103), \"than honey to my mouth.\" But we can certainly drink water, since water does not spoil the taste. And we also drink the two cups of the commandment, as we do not push off the commandment [on account of] this reason. And afterwards, we wash our hands, but we do not recite the blessing, \"upon the washing of the hands.\" And we pour the third cup and recite the Grace after the meals and \"who has created the fruit of the vine\" over it; but not \"upon the vine,\" after it (see Baal HaMeor on the end of Arevei Pesachim). And afterwards, we pour the fourth cup and finish Hallel over it. And we do not recite the blessing, \"who has created the fruit of the vine,\" upon it; but we do recite the blessing, \"upon the vine,\" after it. And that is if he does not have in mind to still drink a fifth cup. It comes out according to this that we only recite the blessing, \"who has created the fruit of the vine,\" twice - on the cup of Kiddush and on the cup of the Grace. And [we only recite the blessing,] \"upon the vine,\" once, after all of the cups. And the four cups and the matsah of the commandment requires leaning.",

And this matter that we have the power to forbid the permissible is because the Torah taught us this, from that which is written (Numbers 30:3), \"If [...] he creates a prohibition [...], he may not break his word.\"",
                "And this matter is similar to consecration (<i>hekdesh</i>). As we have found in the Torah that a person has the power to consecrate what is his, with the words of his mouth; and they will immediately be forbidden to him and to the whole world, as it is written (Leviticus 27:14), \"And if a man consecrates his home to be holy.\" And so [too], does he have power over himself to forbid things upon his body. This is their, may their memory be blessed, always saying in the expressions of vows (Nedarim 15a), \"Behold, it is upon me\" - or (Nedarim 13b), \"my mouth\" for speech - meaning to say that he distances that thing from him. And he has the power to bind himself with a prohibition of that thing, [just] like he has the power to forbid his possessions. And that is itself the law and the reason why [only] an oath can rest upon something of substance [as well as] something that is not of substance (Nedarim 15b), since the oath lodges upon the body of the person, meaning to say that his body is obligated to do that thing - and behold, the body has substance. However a vow only rests upon something that has substance, as it is like him placing something into the category of other things that are forbidden; meaning to say that thing x will be forbidden to him like the category of the sacrifice that is forbidden to him. And if there is no substance to that which he is [literally] placing in the category, he has not done anything and it is nothing. ",
                "And so from this reason, an oath cannot rest upon an oath [about the same matter], but a vow can rest upon a vow [about the same matter].  As with an oath, behold once a man has himself entered into the partition of [something's] existence, as we have said, even if he repeats his word that he is entering there a thousand times, the entrance of his body into another place is done [only] one time. And this that he does after that is only repeating words pointlessly. But with a vow in which he is like one that accepts upon himself that something permissible is as if it is forbidden; with each time that he repeats his acceptance, he adds [a further] prohibition if he [breaks his vow]. And hence he is liable for each and every one. And it is the same matter itself that an oath cannot rest upon the matter of a commandment (Nedarim 16a), but a vow can rest even upon the matter of a commandment. As one who makes an oath speaks about his body, and his body is already obligated in that matter [of the commandment] from Mount Sinai. But with a vow, he is only speaking about the object that he wants to bring into the category of the forbidden, and about this specific object, he was never obligated. And hence [his new] prohibition rests upon it. And we do not feed a person something that is forbidden for him [because of an oath or a vow]. And this is what they, may their memory be blessed, said (Ran on Nedarim 8a, s. v. Vehalo mushva) that the one who makes an oath forbids himself to the object and the one who makes a vow forbids the object to himself.",
                "And you may ask, \"How is it that the one who makes a vow not to eat something that he is commanded about to eat, does not eat it - as behold, he is commanded about that thing with a positive commandment; and a positive commandment comes and pushes off the negative commandment of 'he shall not break.' As so did the Sages say in every place, 'a positive commandments comes and pushes off a negative commandment.'\" The answer to you is that the vow is a positive commandment and there is [also] a negative commandment in it: the negative commandment is \"he shall not break,\" and the positive commandment is \"everything that comes out of his mouth he shall do.\" And from the reason that we gave [before] that his body is acted upon with an oath, they said (Shevuot 20a) [that] one that is added on with an oath [of someone else] is exempt [from it]; but with vows, he is obligated. How so? If he heard that his fellow made a vow and he said, \"I am also like you,\" within the time of speech (immediately after it), behold this one is forbidden, since the intention of this one is to say, [just] like you are forbidden from this thing, so too will I be forbidden from it, and with this, it will be sufficient for him. But with an oath, wherein we picture the first one as if he acts upon his body with his words - as we have said - he has not removed something else away from his body; they, may their memory be blessed, did not see that this later one is included in this movement by saying, \"I am also like you.\" [Rather,] he must speak out the expression of this movement with his actual mouth - for example, if he says, \"I too swear like you\"; or if he hears from the mouth of someone who moves him [specifically] to that thing, and he fulfills it and indicates that he wants this movement, like when another man says to him, \"I put an oath upon you,\" and he answers, \"Amen.\"  ",
                "The general principle of the thing is that the language of the oath must be said by his own mouth or that someone else specifically refers it to him and he accepts [it]. But he is not moved by the movement of another man, since his [own] body needs the movement; [but this] is not the case with a vow. [It is also] possible to say that it is from the strictness of a vow that they were stricter about it, that one should be added on more quickly than with an oath; since it is stricter than an oath, as behold, they compare it to the life of the King (Sifrei Bamidbar 123:3, see Ramban on Numbers 30:3). And from the reason that we wrote about an oath, that its content is that a man concludes to fulfill his words and to confirm [them by that which] he believes in the Divine existence, we would have learned that his oath cannot be nullified from any angle. But it was from the kindnesses of God to us - in His knowing the frailty of the structure of our body and the smallness of our opinions and the constancy of the change of our wills - to give us counsel to get out from the prison of the  oath with the [change] of our will at any time: he allowed us to make the claim regarding the matter of the oath that it was under duress or inadvertent, as is explained in its place in Shevuot 26a and Nedarim 20b. ",
                "However, we were not permitted to go out from it [wantonly, but] rather [only] with the stratagem and counsel of the sage; that the one who swore come in front of the man who is wise and understanding of the ways of the Torah and confess to him that [the oath] was from his lack of knowledge - that he did not know at the time that he swore something that he knew afterwards - that he wants to annul what he swore about (Nedarim 71a); and that he recognizes that the smallness of his knowledge and his lacking caused the annulment, not something else or an external thought that would be in his heart, God forbid. And after the confession of his mouth about this, the sage recognizes and sees that there is substance in his words that something new happened to him that if he had had to agree to it at the time that he swore, he would not have sworn and that this is why he regrets [it]; he accepts his confession and he releases him from his oath. And this is what they, may their memory be blessed, said (Berachot 32b), \"He cannot forgive [it], but others can forgive it to him.\" Therefore it is never possible  to annul an oath, except with the reason of something new to the one who swore - for example, that he will say, \"If I had known thing x, I would never have sworn.\" As this is like duress. But if he says, \"Annul me my oath,\" without a claim, no man has the power to annul it. And based on this, they, may their memory be blessed, said (Nedarim 64a) that we do not create an opening (to annul the vow) with something new that is not found (that has not happened). As [with this] he does not clearly say that he regrets that he swore - that we should consider it duress - but rather that his will today is like it was at the beginning, but he [just] wants it annulled now. How is this? He swears that he not benefit from x and [x] becomes the town scribe or butcher, and he says, \"My will [still] stands that I did not want to benefit from him and I [also] did not want him to become the scribe or the butcher.\" We do not annul [it] for him until he says, \"Since I see that this man has become the scribe, I regret that I swore [off] his benefit forever. And if only I had not sworn!\" In this way, we annul [it] for him; as behold, he concedes that his will has changed and that he regrets his deeds completely, due to the lack of his knowledge - as had he known at the time of the oath what he knows today, he never would have sworn. And it is like duress. And we expound (Shevuot 26a), \"'A man with an oath' (Leviticus 5:4) - to exclude duress.\"",
                "And from this foundation - also when he makes his oath depend on the mind of others, it is difficult to annul it. As since he has removed his [own] mind from the thing and made it depend on the mind of others, afterwards the claim of duress or inadvertence is not found with him. And this is what they said (Gittin 36a) that one who swears upon the mind of others does not have annulment. And nonetheless for a matter of a commandment, the Sages agreed to annul [it. This is] because [regarding] everything that a man does, which is something that causes the negation of a commandment or that a commandment is performed by not doing that thing, the heart of any Jew would [want] to negate the private action and do the commandment. And [so] we see [it] as if all of the [others] upon whose minds he swore were with him in front of him [now] and say that if they knew [about] the negation of the commandment [coming from] his oath, their minds would not have agreed with him. And behold, we have a claim of duress and inadvertence. And therefore they, may their memory be blessed, said (Nedarim 16b), \"But there is annulment for the matter of a commandment.\"  ",
                "And do not think to challenge me about the giving of this reason that I have said - that the main annulment [comes from] something new happening to a man; that had he known about it from the beginning, he would not have sworn – [such that] you would say, “Behold, we have found annulment regarding the oaths of God, may He be blessed, as they, may their memory be blessed, expounded (Berakhot 32b) about ‘And Moshe beseeched’ (Exodus 32:11), that, as if it were possible, he annulled His oath [for] Him; and the matter of Zerubavel the son of Shaltiel, [about whom] they, may their memory be blessed, said (Sanhedrin 38a) that he was asked by God [to annul] His oath.” And God forbid that there should be a change of will with Him. As one can answer you - and it is [perfectly] true - that everything that comes in Scripture similar to these matters is all stated from the angle of the receivers, which are people. As God forbid to Him and for our hearts to believe that the Master of all would need to swear about something, or that He would need to annul it and negate it afterwards. Rather this thing is said from the angle of receiving punishment which comes to the one punished - that if a man is liable, due to the greatness of his sin, that he be punished regardless, to the point where it is not fitting to give him [the possibility] of repentance, the notion of an oath of God will come upon such a man; meaning to say [that] his punishment and decree is strongly upon him as if there were an oath on the thing. And so [too], for the good: if a man merited, from his great significance, to receive good - he and his children - the verse will also state that God, may He be blessed, swore to benefit him.",
                "And about this and that which is similar to it, they, may their memory be blessed, said (Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 19:18:2) [it is] in order to (assuage - Vilna edition) break the ear to that which it can hear (make it understandable). As the strength and persistence of a thing cannot be illustrated to people except with that which they strengthen and keep their [own] words. And in this way exactly did they, may their memory be blessed, expound the annulment of the oath of God, may He be blessed: They wanted to say that He is 'graceful and merciful, slow to anger and of great kindness,' and atones for sins; even though their sins are great and strong to the point that if a man sinned to another so much, [the one offended] would swear never to forgive [the other]. And upon this approach, they, may their memory be blessed, said that Moshe annulled it; meaning to say that it was the merit of Moshe's good prayer that caused God, may He be blessed - who is the Listener to prayer - to have forgiven their sin. And this is [why] you will not find that our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed,  expound about the matter of the annulment of an oath of His, may He be blessed, except with a great sin - such that every listener will [understand] that it not given to atonement; meaning to say it is fitting to swear about it that it should not be atoned. But His mercies, Blessed be He, were greater than all of our thoughts, and He atones for all those who return to Him - and even if their sin is too heavy to bear - according to my opinion. ",
                "And the proof to these words of ours is that which they said (Rosh Hashanah 18a) concerning a [Divine] decree that has an oath with it, as Rava concludes there, that it is not atoned with a sacrifice or a grain offering, but rather it is atoned with words of Torah; and they have no mention there that God would need to annul [His oath]. As the matters are known and clear to all who see the sun that it is all said metaphorically for the receivers. And in order to direct you on this path in many places, I have been lengthy about this until now.",
                "And [regarding] that which I said that our Sages, may their memory be blessed, ascribe the term, annulment, to an oath of God, may He be blessed; you will only find this in a place that they attributed to Him an oath to make a creature liable. But in a place where they attributed to Him an oath to give merit to a creature, they never mention annulment - as the One of great kindness, inclines towards kindness. I mean to say that once a person appears meritorious at one time in front of the Omnipresent, it is so fitting for him to receive the good [that] it is as if the Holy One, blessed be He, swore the goodly reward to him. It is like the matter that is stated (Psalms 132:11), \"The Lord swore to David,\" and similar to it - [it means] the merit will no longer go away from him, even if he sins greatly. And this is from His precious traits, blessed be He. ",
                "The laws of the commandment - for example, appellations for oaths, [about] which they, may their memory be blessed, said that they are like an oath [and the explanation of appellations for oaths are the many terms that exist among people, according to their places, like what they, may their memory be blessed, said (Nedarim 10a), \"<i>Shevuta, shekuka, etc.</i>\"]; so [too], the law [if one says,] \"a curse (<i>allah</i>)\" or \"cursed (<i>aroor</i>)\" whether they are like oaths (Shevout 36a); one who says \"no\" with the mention of God, and so [too], \"right or left (Nazir 3b); the law of his mouth and heart being [in agreement], and that which we learned from this law of his mouth and heart being [in agreement], that we are able to make [deceptive] oaths to killers and plunderers, like [if] he say that all the fruits in the world are forbidden to him if there be such and such, and in his heart is that they only be forbidden for today (Nedarim 27b), and even though it generally implies forever, but it is only permitted to us like this, when the words of his mouth do not completely contradict the thought of his heart, and not in any other way; and the rest of its many details - are [all] in Shevuot and Nedarim (See Tur, Yoreh Deah 236).",

And even though there is no act, the Torah made him liable for lashes due to the severity of the matter (Shevuot 27b). And he is exempted from a sacrifice for this, when inadvertent. But with a false oath - and that is what is called an oath of expression - the Torah obligated a sacrifice for inadvertence, as we shall write (Sefer HaChinukh 123) with God's help. "

                "<b>The commandment of the sanctification of Shabbat with words:</b> To speak words on the Shabbat upon its entry and also its departure - that there be in them cognizance of the greatness of the day and its stature and its positive distinction from the other days before it and after it; as it is stated (Exodus 20:8), \"Remember the Shabbat day, to sanctify it,\" meaning to say, remember it with a memory of [its] holiness and greatness. And in explanation, our Sages told us (Pesachim 110a) that we are commanded to say these things upon wine - as so does the explanation come: remember it over wine. And the content is that we place into a cup a <i>reviit</i> or more of pure or mixed wine - but not less than this (Pesachim 108b). And it is known that the [proportions of the] mixture is one part pure good wine to three parts water. And we recite the blessing of the Kiddush (sanctification) of Shabbat upon it, according to the wording that is known among the Jews. And so [too], at the departure of Shabbat, we recite the blessing over the wine in honor of the day - and that blessing of the conclusion of Shabbat is called Havdalah (Berakhot 52a). ",
                "It is from the roots of this commandment [that it is] in order that we be aroused through this act to remember the greatness of the day and that we fix upon our hearts faith in the creation of the world, \"that in six days the Lord made, etc.\" (Exodus 20:11). And therefore, we are obligated to do an act with wine - since the nature of man is to be greatly aroused by it (Berakhot 35b), as it satiates and causes joy. And I have already said to you that according to the arousal of a man and his acts will he always be acted upon towards things. And from this root did they, may their memory be blessed, say in the Gemara (Pesachim 106b), that if bread is more beloved to a person, he should sanctify [the day] over bread - since then his nature will be more aroused by that which he craves. And even though in the departure of the day, they did not say this, but rather obligated him to recite Havdalah with wine nonetheless, they were correct with this as well; since they, may their memory be blessed, as well as the perfect Torah, will always choose to go according to the majority. And in truth, the majority of the world will desire drinking over eating at the conclusion of Shabbat; since they have already [eaten] a large meal during the day in honor of the Shabbat. And there is no need to give a reason for their obligating us that there be a <i>reviit</i> of wine in the cup; since less than this amount is not fitting and will not arouse the heart of a man upon it. And that which they obligated us in rinsing the cup (Berakhot 51a), and not to drink anything until he recites the Kiddush (Pesachim 105a) and that he recites the Kiddush at the location of his meal - all of [these] are branches of the root of arousal that I [discussed].",

                "<b>To not do work on Shabbat:</b> To not do work on the day of Shabbat ourselves; and not allow our children, slaves and animals to do so, as it is stated (Exodus 20:10), \"you shall not do work, etc.\" There is no doubt that even though the verse issues a [single blanket] prohibition on us, our children, servants, and animals, they are not all equal; as we see that one who volitionaly does work with his own body will be liable for the death penalty in a court. But with the work of others - even though he is warned about them with a negative commandment - he is not liable for them; [not] even with lashes, as lashes are never for the act of others. And from the language of Rambam, may his memory be blessed, (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Sabbath 20:1) it is implied that he holds that this prohibition of \" you shall not do work, you [...] and your animal,\" comes upon letting an animal work (<i>mechamer</i>) while being behind it - for example, that he is using it to plow. As, according to his opinion, letting an animal work by itself is only a prohibition [embedded] in a positive commandment. And hence, according to his opinion, they said in the Gemara (Shabbat 154a) that this negative commandment of letting your animals do work is a negative commandment that is given over to the warning of a death penalty from the court - meaning to say, that a man is killed for it, and [so] there are no lashes for it. But Ramban, may his memory be blessed, (on Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Shorashim 14) wrangles with him greatly on this explanation, and says that this negative commandment of letting your animals do work is only about walking behind his animal laden with his load, while the man does not do any act with his hands. And therefore neither lashes nor the death penalty would ever come to him; and it is as that which has been established for us, we do not administer lashes for any negative commandment that does not have an act. [And it is] like they, may their memory be blessed, expounded (Shabbat 154b), \"'You [...] and your animal' - let it write, you shall not do work and your animal'; why do I need 'you?' [To tell you] that when he does work, he is liable; but for the work of his animal he is not lia work ble.\" Rather, he is [just] warned about it with a negative commandment, like with the work of his young child and his Canaanite slave. But for his own actual work - for that there was no reason to say that he is liable, as behold, his punishment is explicit (Exodus 34:2), \"any one who does work on it shall die.\" And according to the opinion of Ramban, may his memory be blessed, the explanation of that which they said in the Gemara about the negative commandment of letting your animal do work, that it is a negative commandment that is given over to the warning of a death penalty from the court, is that since it also includes the other [types of] work which [come] with a warning of a death penalty from the court - even though with letting your animal work there is certainly only a negative commandment, as there is also not [even] lashes with it - nonetheless, this negative commandment is [called] a negative commandment that is given over to the warning of a death penalty from the court because of those things that it includes that have death penalties of the court. And similar to this did they, may their memory be blessed, say in the first chapter of Eruvin 17b about the negative commandment of \"let no man leave his place\": Since it also includes carrying out from one domain to another - like the teaching that they expounded, [read, do not go out (<i>yetseh</i>), as] do not carry out (<i>yotsee</i>) - that it is from now a negative commandment that is given over to the warning of a death penalty from the court in some of its matters. And since it is so, we can say that we do not administer lashes for it, in all of its matters. And in exactly the same way, we can explain the negative commandment of not letting your animal do work here.  ",
                "It is from the roots of this commandment that we should be free from our preoccupations in honor of the day [of Shabbat], in order to instill within our souls faithfulness to the [concept of the] universe's creation, which is [a concept that affects many fundamental principles in Judaism] (lit. a rope that drags along all the foundations of our religion). And we remember once a week, every week, that the universe was created in six distinct days, that nothing was created on the seventh day, and that different [types of creations] were brought into being each day. [All of this confirms the Torah's philosophical idea of God's] Simple (Single) Will, which differs from the philosophers' view, that disgusts us in their idea regarding this matter that [alongside] the Blessed One['s existence] was everything. And through our rest on the seventh day we are reminded of the universe's creation; because, when everyone simultaneously  rests once a week, curious people will ask what is the point of this rest?  And the answer will be \"because [in] six days God created, etc.\" (Exodus 31:17). [And through that answer], everyone will be  strengthened in the true faith. And in addition to remembering the universe's creation, there is in [Shabbat] also a remembering of the miracle of [the exodus from] Egypt - that we were slaves there and we were not able to rest whenever we desired to rest, and God saved us from their hands and commanded us to rest on the seventh day (Shabbat). Therefore, the second root is mentioned in Deuteronomy (lit. the repetition of the Torah), as it states in the [context of] the commandment of Shabbat, \"And you should remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, etc. therefore the Lord, your God, commanded you to [observe] (lit. make) the day of Shabbat\" (Deuteronomy 5:15).",

And the matter is beautiful, also according to our [understanding], since 'as he has done, so shall it be done to him' - since the intention of the killer was to kill the murdered quickly, as from [the killer's] fear of him, he will quicken his death with all of his might. And so too was the Torah lenient with his judgment to kill him with strangulation, which is a quick death penalty; and not with stoning and burning, which are with great pain. (In the other editions, it is written, \"The truth is that the death penalty of the murderer is with the sword, [whereas] he who hits his father and mother has a death penalty of strangulation.\") However with the statutes of licentiousness, in which the transgressors derived pleasure from the sin and the pleasure continued a bit, they sometimes get burning and sometimes stoning.",

And his punishment is great - 'as were it no for the fear of [judgment], man would swallow his fellow alive.' And Ramban, may his memory be blessed (on Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Shorashim 14) does not count this commandment in his calculation. And so [too] does he not count any of the four death penalties of the court - which are stoning, burning, killing (decapitation) and strangulation - that Rambam, may his memory be blessed, counted as four commandments. And [Ramban] said that through the verse of \"and you shall destroy the evil from within you\" (Deuteronomy 17:7), the Torah commanded more generally that we destroy those that do evil from among us; and within it are included all of the laws. And when Scripture specifies the laws according to their punishments afterwards, it is not considered a [separate] commandment, as it is only an elucidation of the topic.

And borrowing is without a wage at all, but rather, he is doing a kindness for him to do him this favor. And if a disagreement breaks out between them about the matter, we must judge the law that is stated about this [upon] them, as it is written in this section (Exodus 22:13), “And if a man borrows from his neighbor, etc.” And regarding the law of the borrower, the Torah made [him] liable even for things of duress (out of his control) - as it is his responsibility: Since he borrowed it and did not put out any thing of his for it, behold he is like one who took out a monetary loan - who if something beyond his control occurred to him could not be exempt from [paying the] creditor, with the claim that it was duress. And about the matter that he is exempt if borrowing in the presence of the owners, we can say according to the simple understanding that the Torah did not make the borrower liable since the owner of the vessel or or the animal is with him - as since he is there, he will guard what is his. And even though the borrower is [still] exempt after the owners left [him], if they were there at the time of the borrowing - it is possible to answer about this that the Torah did not want to give different measures for its words and state that if the owners stay long, he will be exempt, but if [only] a little, he will be liable. [Instead,] the Torah commanded more generally that so long as the owners are there at the time of the borrowing, he will be exempt. And this is the reason that they, may their memory be blessed, said (Bava Metzia 95b), that if he was there with him at the time of the borrowing – even if he was not with him at the time of it breaking or dying – he is exempt; but if he was with him at the time of the breaking or the dying but he was not there at the time of the borrowing, he is liable.

I do not have to write at length about it, as the things are well-known. And therefore we were commanded to put away from the world someone who makes efforts with this, as he is coming against the will of God, as He desires [the world's] settlement and that everything should be administered in a natural way. As nature was at the beginning of creation and this one wants to change everything. And according to my opinion, the matter of magic is that at the beginning of creation, God, blessed be He, placed for each and every thing in the world a nature [through which] to accomplish its action well and straight, for the good of the creatures of the world that He created; and He commanded each one to act according to its species, as it is written about all the creatures, in Parshat Bereshit (Genesis 1:12), “according to its species.” And He also made a higher force govern each and every one from above, to compel it to perform its action; as they, may their memory be blessed, said (Bereshit Rabbah 1), “There is no [blade of] grass below that does not have a constellation above that tells it, 'Grow!'”And besides the action that each and every one does according to its nature, there is another action that they have, by mixing one specie with another. And in the craft of this mixing there are some angles that were not permitted for people to utilize, because God knows that the end result that will come out for people from these angles will be bad for them. And on account of this, He prevented them from them. And this is what they, may their memory be blessed, said more generally (Shabbat 67b), “Anything that has healing in it does not have the 'ways of the Amorite' in it”; meaning to say, it should not be forbidden from the perspective of magic – since there is a benefit to it that is found from true experience, it is not from the forbidden angles, as they are only forbidden because of the perspective of their damage. And there is another matter in these forbidden angles of mixture and machinations for which they were forbidden. [It is] because the power of this mixture is so strong that it negates the power of the constellations that are assigned upon the two species. And the illustration of this is that it is just like that which you see with the grafting of one specie with a different one, that a new third specie is created. It comes out that the grafting negates the power of both of them. And so we have been prevented from bringing up to our minds to switch the perfect acts of God, even if something that appears to be pleasing comes out in our hand.",

Because it contradicts the retinue (<i>makhishin pamaliah</i>) on high and on low,” is meaning to say that their power temporarily overrides the power of those forces appointed over them. And see the precision of their words, may their memory blessed, as they said, “the retinue on high,” and they did not say, “the decree of High – since God, blessed be He, decreed it and wanted from the beginning of creation that this action would come out from the two of them when they are mixed.

As behold, they, may their memory be blessed, said (Sanhedrin 67b), \"'With their tricks,' that is the work of demons; 'with their spells,' that is the work of magic.\" It is implied from this that the matter of magic is possible to do without demons. However, sometimes it is also done with demons. And those demons that are used for the craft of magic are called angels of destruction.

And because of this, they, may their memory be blessed, said (Shevuot 45a), that one who comes to collect [a debt] from their monies - even if he has a validated deed - may not collect without [taking] an oath, which is not the case with another. And they, may their memory be blessed, said (Bava Batra 23a) that if they have a quarrel with anyone - that the court is obligated to make a claim for them, against the one who sues them, and they claim for their benefit anything they think that their father would have been able to claim; and if they have money, that the court must force anyone they find that is wealthy - beyond possessions that are liened -and that is a trustworthy man who loves peace and is upstanding, and deposit the money of the orphans with him, to do business with (invest) it in a way that is likely to profit the orphans and be far from loss (low-risk) (Bava Metzia 70b), which they did not permit with another person due to a rabbinic prohibition on interest. And they also force any person that is good for them to put his eye on their properties, if their father had not left any custodian for them.",
                "And they also said about them (Gittin 52a) that their hand be on the higher (they be given the advantage) in all give and take that they have with anyone, as [is this case] with consecrated property; and in one [case], even more than consecrated property. How is this? [If] the orphans sold their fruit and the purchaser dragged some of them towards him but did not yet give the money and [their value] appreciated in the interim, they can retract, since their properties are only acquired through money - like consecrated property, about which it is written, \"and he gives him the money and it is established for him\" (and not by dragging as is otherwise the standard). If the fruits depreciated, the buyers may not retract, as the power of a commoner should not be weightier than their power. And so [too], if they bought the fruit and they dragged them and did not give the value, and they appreciated, the seller cannot retract, so that the power of the commoner not be greater than their power. But if they depreciated, they could retract; however for the sake of their welfare, [the rabbis] said they are not able to retract - so that they will be able to find someone to sell them fruit on credit. If they gave the value to the seller for fruit and they did not drag the fruit, and the fruit depreciated - they can recall [it]. And this is the one [case] that we said they have an advantage over consecrated property. As consecrated property cannot be recalled in this case - as since in the same case with a commoner there is a [curse called] the One who repayed [placed upon the one who retract, the sages did not want to apply a lowly trait for [such] a small gain for consecrated property. But with orphans, it is enough for them to be like the rest of the people; and since the rest of the people can retract [in this case], according to [the letter of] the law - except that they [are given a curse] - it is correct that (orphans, who do not receive a curse), [be allowed] to retract. [If] the orphans gave the value, but did not drag the fruit, and they appreciated - the sellers may reretract, [though] they retract and receive [a curse]. But this is for the welfare [of the orphans], as if their law would be that they acquire with the giving of money, the seller would tell them that they burned up or got lost from duress (it was beyond his control). And you might say, they should be in their possession for any benefit of theirs - that if they want, they take them regardless; and if they do not, they do not take them - so that the buyer not give this answer. [If so,] your answer is that it is impossible to do all this for them - as it is not correct to give them the property of [other] people. It is enough for them that for their benefit we sometimes [administer] Torah law upon them and sometimes [administer] rabbinic law upon them. But above all this, it is not correct to give them the money of the [rest of] the world, and similar to that which they said about them in the Gemara, (Bava Metzia 70a), \"Orphans that consume what is not theirs will follow those that left them (and die).\" [If] the orphans took the value for their fruit, but the buyer did not drag some of them, and they depreciated - the buyers can retract according to the law and receive [a curse]. As if you say, \"Let us [administer] Torah law upon them, and since the buyers gave the money, they acquired the fruit and the buyers may not retract\" - this would be bad for the orphans, as they would never find someone who will advance them money for their fruits. And it is possible that they will need money at that time; and it will come out for them that this advantage will sometimes be a great loss. And so [the Rabbis] investigated every side of their benefit that was possible and arranged it for them.",

And so [too] is the law more generally regarding an agent who gives and takes with the knowledge of his sender, that neither of them receive [a curse]. And nonetheless, they said about them that it is permitted to oppress them  a little for their benefit - for example a teacher towards his student in Torah or in a craft. However even for their benefit, it is a commandment to be more lenient upon them than upon other people. And they also said that there is a covenant made with them that their cries will be answered, as it is stated (Exodus 22:22), \"I will surely hear his cry\"; and that they are called orphans regarding the matter of this commandment until they do not need an adult for their business affairs, but rather administer all of their own needs like all other adults.

And behold his punishment is explicit in the Torah, as it is stated (Exodus 22:23), \"and I shall kill you with the sword\" - meaning to say, measure for measure, such that the wives of the afflicters become widows and their children, orphans, and not find someone who has mercy upon them. As in the way that a person measures, so will he be measured (Sotah 8b). And if the afflicter is a female, she will die and her husband will marry another woman who will afflict her children.

And in the manner that we said [that it is] in order to give us merit did a sage from our Sages answer a certain heretic who asked him if God loves the poor - as He commanded [to help] them - why does He not provide for them, etc., as it appears in Tractate Bava Batra 10a.",

And they, may their memory be blessed, said (Chullin 57b) that this time is [up to] a year. And it should also be understood by all those that understand, that the Torah is not exacting that the tearing be by a wolf or a lion or a bear, but rather any animal that inflicts a wound which brings [another animal] to die is forbidden regardless. And those are the wounds that the sages enumerated that kill, and it is as it comes in the Mishnah (Chullin 42a), \"This is the general rule: anything that nothing like it stays alive is a torn animal.\" And that which the verse stated, \"in the field,\" is not specific, but rather it is the way of Scripture to always state what is common, and it is the way of animals to get torn in the field. And so is it [found] in the Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 23:30), \"The Torah stated what is common.\" And it was also needed to write, \"in the field,\" in order to teach many other things. As the words of the Torah are expounded in different ways - outside, they wear clothing of majesty, pure linen and silk and embroidery, and inside, there is gold and many pearls. And the clothing of this verse that is revealed and more obvious at the beginning of its study is to teach only about the torn animal, as we have written; and [also] about meat from a living animal, which is included in the [concept of] meat of a torn animal. And that which is inside is this - that it teaches about any meat that went out of its boundary, that it is forbidden and becomes like a torn animal - for example consecrated meats that went outside [the Temple] courtyard, and lightly consecrated meats that went outside of [Jerusalem's] wall, and the meat of a Pesach sacrifice that went outside of its assemblage and so [too,] a limb that went out from its mother's womb. And the understanding of the Scripture comes like this, as if it stated, \"and meat in the 'field' is 'torn,'\" meaning to say, meat that went out of its boundary - as that is [the meaning of] the expression, 'field,' that it has no boundaries - is a 'torn' animal. And the law of all of these that we mentioned is like a torn animal, and one who ate a <i>kazayit</i> from them is lashed. ",
                "It is from the roots of this commandment [that it is] because the body is an instrument of the soul - with it, it carries out its activity; without it, it can never complete its work. And hence it is in its shadow truly for its good, and not for its bad; as God does not do bad but does good to all. Thus we find that the body at its command is like a pair of tongs in the hand of a blacksmith: with it he can produce a tool fit for its purpose. Now in truth, if the tongs are strong and properly shaped to grasp tools in them, the craftsman can make them well. But if the tongs are not good, the tools will never come out properly shaped and fit. In the same way, if there is any damage in the body, of any kind, some function of the intelligence will be nullified, corresponding to that damage. For this reason, our whole and perfect Torah removed us far from anything that causes [such] a defect. In this vein, according to the simple understanding, would we say [that] we were given a ban by the Torah against all forbidden foods. And if there are some among them whose harm is known [understood] neither by us nor by the wise men of medicine, do not wonder about them; as the faithful, trustworthy Physician who adjured us about them is wiser than both you and them. And how foolish and impulsive is the one who thinks that things don't have damage or benefit, except for that which he can grasp. And you should know that their reasons were not revealed, for our benefit; lest people who hold themselves to be great sages get up and feign wisdom to say, \"X damage that the Torah stated in thing y is only in place a, whose nature is such,\" or \"with person b, whose nature is such and such,\" and lest one of the dim-witted be seduced by their words. Therefore their reason was not revealed, to aid us [avoid] this obstacle.",
                "And it is known from the paths of medicine that the meat of all torn animals that are forbidden to us brings damage to the body of its eater, as the state of being 'torn' indicates sickness in the animal. And do not ask yourself to say, \"What damage can there be in an animal that was torn and immediately slaughtered?\" As it is not from wisdom that you would ask about this. Do you not know that there is a beginning to everything? And if you admit to me that in the course of time, the damage will be found in it due to its being in a status of being 'torn,' you will be obligated to admit that the damage begins from the first instant, except that it is small at first. Yet there is no doubt that even a little damage is bad. And also, all of the laws of the Torah and anything that has endurance must be like this, as if you place measurements on your words, nothing will ever be established in your hand.",
                "The laws of the commandment: For example, the [types of] 'torn' animals that were [instructed] to Moshe at Sinai, and they are the eight main categories (<i>avot</i>, Chullin 54a): the clawed; the pierced; the lacking; the removed; the split; the torn; the fallen and the broken. And the clawed is the most severe of all, since it is explicit in the Torah. And hence, they, may their memory be blessed, said (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Ritual Slaughter 5:3) that any doubt that comes about it [renders it] forbidden. And with other 'torn' animals, there are some wherein a doubt is permissible. And each and every one of these main categories has many, many derivatives, as their listings come in the Gemara. And the tally of all the 'torn' animals that it is possible to find in a domesticated animal, a wild animal or a bird that comes in our hand from their listing - as it would appear from the words of the Gemara - is seventy-two, with one more in the birds than the animals. And they cannot be added to and they cannot be subtracted from; since it is possible that a domesticated animal or a wild animal or a bird could survive from any wound contracted by [other ailments], except for these that the Sages enumerated in the early generations and about which the Israelite courts agreed - and even [if] we know by way of medicine that its end is not to survive. And all of these wounds that they enumerated and said that they were [in the category of] 'torn' animals - even if it appears according to the ways of medicine in our hands that some of them do not kill and it is possible that it will survive it - you only have what the Sages enumerated, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 17:1), \"According to the instruction.\" And each one of the seventy two 'torn' animals that we mentioned is elucidated at length with all of its conditions in Tractate Chullin.",
                "And a person need not search for all of these 'tearings' that the sages enumerated in animals and in birds and check them before he eats the meat of an animal or bird - since most animals are assumed to be fit (kosher), as we assume most living creatures to be healthy - except for one of them that the Sages required to check before we eat the meat, because this 'tearing' is much found. And that is the 'tearing' in the lung in which mucous membranes called <i>sirkhot</i> (adhesions) are found. And there is a concern with them that they not pull the tissue of the lung and puncture it. Hence, a person must always see on which side these mucous membranes are found in the lung before he eats from the animal. And if he finds them in [such] a way that it is possible that from their movement, the lung would be punctured, it is a 'torn' animal - as we say that we consider anything that stands to be punctured regardless as punctured [already]; and it is as if it is dead, since it is impossible for it to be saved from death. And it is known that this sickness that brings these mucous membranes in places that they will puncture in the future is the beginning of a sickness that brings death, as the mucous membranes have [already] formed in those places. ",
                "And these are the places that the mucous membranes 'tear' according to the principle that has come into our hands from the words of the Gemara with the good commentaries: Any place where there is an adhesion on the central bronchial tube is 'torn' and it is not permitted by way of examination, except in one way - if the adhesion is on the wall and there is a wound on the wall and the entire adhesion comes out of the place of the wound. As in this case, we say [to] check, and some permit it without checking. And there are those (Rashi on Chullin 46b) that remove from this principle [of what is automatically 'torn'] if the adhesion is on the side of the lobe from one [end of the] division to the [other end of the] division, and so is it our custom today to permit [this]. Any time that the small pink lobe which is on the right side has an adhesion, it is 'torn.' And the lobes of the lung are five, besides the small lobe, and there are three on the right side of the lobe when the animal is suspended by its legs, according to the way the butchers suspend it, and two on the left. [But] if they have adhesions or are [connected] one to the other and the adhesion comes out from one [end of the] division to the [other end of the] division, and so [too,] if the adhesions are on the ribs of the animal among which [the lungs] crouch and the adhesion goes out from the back of the lobe to the rib and clings to the ribs and the flesh between the ribs - and all the more so [if it clings] to the flesh itself - we determine all of this to be permissible. But if the adhesion come out between them from the division of the lobe to the back of [another lobe] or from one back to [the other] back, and so [too,] if it goes out from the lobe to the ribs and only clings to the bones themselves, and so [too,] in any other place in the animal at all that the lobe has an adhesion there or is [connected], we determine it to be forbidden.",
                "And Rambam, may his memory be blessed, removed from this principle anytime the adhesions are on the breast or the fat of the breast and determines it to be permissible (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Ritual Slaughter 11:7). But this is not our custom. An adhesion that is suspended in any place - whether from the lobe or whether from the central bronchial tube - is fit (kosher). And there are those that render it 'torn,' but our custom is to permit it. If the lobes are not to be found in this order or are lacking from this sum, it is 'torn.' And the small pink lobe replaces one lack [of a lobe]. But if [even] many more than this sum are found, it is nothing - so long as the addition is not on the side of their back. As if it is on the side of their back - even one that is as small as a myrtle leaf or smaller - it is forbidden. And there are those that permit it  when it is smaller than a myrtle leaf (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Ritual Slaughter 8:4).",
                "And the rest of the many details of this commandment are elucidated in the third chapter of Chullin. And the laws of the other prohibitions that we wrote above which are understood from the understanding of the language of the verse inside [of it] are in this same exact chapter and in the last chapter of Makkot and the first of Bekhorot. And this warning was repeated in the Prophets in the book of Ezekiel 44:31 for the priests alone, as it is written, \"Any carcass or torn animal [...] the priests shall not eat.\" And the Sages informed us (Menachot 45a) that it was repeated [specifically] for them, as Scripture commanded them to eat the bird sin-offering with <i>melikah</i> (ritual decapitation), even though it is forbidden to [other Jews] like a carcass. And maybe you would think from this that non-consecrated meat would also be permissible for them with <i>melikah</i> or an inferior slaughtering, as the Torah is not exacting with them. As since they were excluded for one thing, they would would be excluded regarding all matters of slaughter. And therefore, the prophet warned them explicitly to inform us that <i>melikah</i> alone is only permissible with a sacrifice, but with non-consecrated meat, they are still forbidden like [other Jews].",
                "And this commandment is practiced in every place and at all times by males and females. And one who transgresses it and eats a <i>kazayit</i> of a 'torn' animal and from all of those [things] that are implied from the understanding of the verse, \"that went out of their boundaries,\" is lashed. And let it not be difficult to you [to ask,] \"And how is he lashed - it is established for us that we do not administer lashes for a negative commandment that is part of a group, and behold, this [is a negative commandment] that included several things,\" as we have said.\" As two greats of the generations have already elucidated it in the Book of the Commandments in the ninth principle - and they are Rambam, may his memory be blessed, and Ramban, may his memory be blessed. And there they wrote their explanations and their proofs in detail, to clarify the thing well. And the matter would be long. Therefore I have left it, as is my custom in [this] book. And nonetheless, you should know that it comes out of the words of both of them that this is not included as a negative commandment that is part of a group."

And the judge is commanded about this so that he not bring the untruths of one of them into his soul. And so does Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 23:1 come [to tell us] that this warning of \"You shall not raise, etc.\" is said about this. And they also said there that it is also a warning to the litigant, for him too, not to make his claims to the judge not in front of his adversary, and even if the judge wants to hear it. And about this, it is also said (Exodus 23:7), \"From a false matter, distance yourself.\" And they, may their memory be blessed, also said (Makkot 23a) that this negative commandment includes telling evil speech, and accepting it, and giving false testimony.

There is nothing more disgusting than it, and malediction and curse are in the house of its lovers. [This is] because God, may He be blessed, is a truthful God, and everything that is with Him is true. And blessing is only found and resting upon those that make themselves similar to Him in their deeds: to be truthful, like He is truthful; to be merciful, like He is merciful; and to be purveyors of kindness, like He is of great kindness. But [regarding] anyone whose deeds are the opposite of His good traits and are masters of falsehood - which is exactly the opposite of His traits - the opposite of His traits will similarly always rest upon them. And the opposite of the trait of blessing which is with Him is malediction and curse; and the opposite of joy and peace and enjoyment which are with Him is worry, strife and pain. All of these are the 'evildoer’s portion from God.' And therefore the Torah warned us to distance ourselves much form falsehood, as it is written, \"From a false matter, distance yourself,\" And behold, it used an expression of distancing, due to it being very disgusting; something it did not mention in all the other warnings. And from the side of distancing, it warned us not to bend our ears at all to anything that is considered falsehood - and even if we do not know with certainly that it is a false matter. And [this is] similar to what they, may their memory be blessed, said (Chullin 44b), \"Distance yourself from what is ugly, and from what is similar to it.\" And in my saying, \"the traits of the Holy One, blessed be He,\" I am pulled after the words of our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, who related to Him, may He be blessed, the name of traits according to the side of those receiving them (people).

And the elucidation of this is that when there is a disagreement among the judges about the case of a man, and some say that he is liable for the death penalty and some say that he is not liable - and those who [would] make him liable are one more than those who [would] make him innocent - that the judge should not do with the [suspected] sinner according to the words of those who make him liable; as it is stated (Exodus 23:2), \"Do not be after the many to do bad\" - meaning to say, do not go after the majority that would result in concluding a verdict of death. And this is the expression stated in the Scripture, \"to do bad\" - meaning to say, to a liability for the death penalty. And that is when there is an exact majority, meaning to say that the decision is only because of one person. But if the decision is with two,  we follow their words, even 'to do bad.'

And the judgments of the commandment are in the fourth chapter of Sanhedrin, as we have written above in the positive commandment of inclining towards the many (Sefer HaChinukh 78). And one who transgresses it and makes [someone] liable with a majority decided by one, has violated the commandment of the King.

And if it is a case that is dependent upon a decree of scripture (<i>gezerat hakatuv</i>), a <i>gezerah shava</i> or a <i>hekesh</i> (the latter two being exegetical inferences based on similar wording in two sections), he must know it himself and not rely and trust one of the [other] judges or the majority; as it is stated (Exodus 23:2), \"and you shall not answer about a dispute to incline.\" [This is] meaning to say, do not say something about a dispute to incline - meaning only from the side of leaning towards the words of a great judge or towards the majority - and not from the side of your understanding. Or if you want to be silent from [saying] that which is in your heart about the case and [instead] to incline after their words, do not do so. And the language of the Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 23:2 is \"'You shall not answer about a dispute to incline' - that you not say, 'It is enough for me that I be like Rabbi x,' but rather, say what is in your heart. Maybe, monetary cases are also like this? [Hence] we learn to say, 'to lean after the majority.'\" And within this very negative commandment is included that the one who advocates innocence in capital cases not go back and advocate guilt; as it stated, \"and you shall not answer about a dispute to incline\" - meaning to say, \"let not your words be  inclined towards guilt\" (Sanhedrin 34a). And so, too, included is that we do not open towards guilt in capital case. And the explanation then comes, \"and you shall not answer about a dispute to incline,\" meaning to say, the opening of your words should not be for guilt. As per force, we must explain it about the beginning of the case, since it is impossible to say that it warns that you not answer guilt about about the whole case. As, if so, no man would ever be prosecuted.  ",

And this is [the meaning] of that which they, may their memory be blessed, said, \"There are seventy faces to the Torah\" (The Letters of Rabbi Akiva). And since God knew that the people that received the Torah - in their acting in the way that they were commanded by it - would be prepared for wisdom and understanding and would understand what they need to about the functioning of the world in it, He kept the words [unelucidated] in [various] places and gave over the understanding through the great intermediary (Moshe) between them and Him. And [so] He did not give it with longer words; as all of its words are decreed, and obligated to be like they are in their count and form. As besides the understanding of its precious commandments that we understand in them, great and majestic wisdom is [also] included in it - to the point that our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, exalted the wisdom that God, blessed be He, placed in it; such that they said about it (Bereshit Rabbah 1) that the Holy One, blessed be He, looked into it and created the world.",

The reason is because it is possible that from this the case will sometimes be totally [decided] by the opinion of [only] one of them. Understand the matter, as it is such. And God, may He be blessed, did not want to give over a capital case to one opinion. But with the case of money - which is given to repayment - we are not concerned with all of this. And it is even given over to three from the outset, relying upon it being impossible that there not be any of them that did not study. And the rest of the things that we learned from it - such as the one who advocated innocence may not advocate guilt; that we do not open with guilt; and that we do not begin from the great one - all of it is out of the pity of God, may He be blessed, upon His creatures. [It is] metaphorically like a man who has pity on his children, as it is written (Deuteronomy 14:10), \"Children are you to the Lord, your God.\" And work upon yourself [to understand it] by way of a parable: If a man fathered a hundred and he built a city for them and placed them there, but saw that they would not survive in the community unless he decreed upon them that anyone who hits his neighbor would be punished with his money; and if he kills him, he shall be killed. And one of them got up and transgressed his decree [and killed another] - if he forgave him, behold, the community would be lost; as fear would not stay upon the [others. So] what is there for him to do and not see the death of his second son? He would nonetheless seek any way he can to exempt him according to the law. If he can, that is best, but if it is impossible in any way, he would command to kill him, so as to preserve the community [for] the others. And so is this matter - understand it.",

And [that] if one opened and said, \"I have guilt to advocate,\" and became paralyzed or died, he is like one who does not know; but we see one who [would] make him innocent that dies, as if he is in his place at the end of the trial.

And nonetheless, all this that we have said that they do not judge is according to the opinion of some commentators and the opinion of the Yerushalmi (Talmud Yerushalmi Sanhedrin 3:9) - as such is it found there explicitly. But according to the opinion of some commentators, they are fit to judge.

But with approximately equal wisdom, the Torah informed us that the many opinions will always conform to the truth more than the minority. But whether - according to the opinion of the listener - they agree to the truth or they do not agree to the truth, logic dictates that we do not swerve from the path of the majority. And that which I say that the choice of the majority is always with two groups that disagree that are equal in the wisdom of truth is said so about every place except for the Sanhedrin. As with them, we are not exacting when they disagree as to which group knows more; but rather we always do like the words of their majority.

And destruction would come from this, as the Torah would turn into many Torahs - since every one would judge according to the poverty of his [own] opinion. But now that we have been explicitly commanded to accept the opinion of the sages about it, there is one Torah for all of us, and its performance is great through this. And we may not budge from their opinion, whatever the case. And so, in our doing their commandments, we are executing the commandments of God. And even if the sages sometimes do not reach [come to] the truth - God forbid - the sin will be upon them and not upon us.

So [too,] that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Sanhedrin 37a) that those that make a majority in capital cases must also be ordained, and that ordination testifies about them that they are wise, understanding and fit, [such] that everything should be done through them. And [this is so] that we not kill people through people lacking wisdom, lest they err in judgment - as there is no repayment for the death penalty.

And in the Order of Reeh Anochi (Sefer HaChinukh 462), we will write [about] the prohibition of the seducer, with God's help. But when he entices two people or more, he is called an enticer. And [about] that which you find all of these distancings about idolatry and the greatness of the punishment for it and that it is repeated in forty-four places in the Torah and that Torah refers to God, blessed be He, as jealous about its worshipers - do not let it come into your heart that the jealousy of God and all of these distancings were written except from the side of the worshippers. As there is no angle of addition or subtraction that occurs in the glory of God, blessed be He and blessed be His name, if people worship Him or worship an angel or a sphere or a star or one of all of His creatures. As total glory and majesty cannot be added to or subtracted from, on account of anything - even as we are His creations, His doings, the people of bodies. Rather, know that truthfully all of these matters are said from the angle of the receivers - that it be said that at the time that a person completely removes himself and strips [his] faith in God, blessed be He, and takes his body and entangles his thoughts to follow vanity, he will not be fit at all that any blessing and any good should rest upon him. Rather, he will be fit that everything that is the opposite of blessing - and that is curse and malediction and sicknesses and all bad things - rest upon him. As he has completely distanced all boundaries of the good from himself and, so, only evil will come to him from every angle. And by way of a metaphor, it is said about Him, as if God, may He be blessed, who is the Master of good, becomes his enemy and blocks all good from him; and as if He is jealous about him, due to his leaving His service and serving others. However, God, blessed be He, is not indebted to any man, nor jealous of any man. As it is in His hand to reverse them all - together with the rest of the world - to null and void, by resting His will on nullification; in the same way that He created them by resting his Will on creation. [Rather], God, blessed be He, is referred to as jealous, by way of the deeds of men. As there is no greater hatred among them than one who is jealous of a man about any thing, or one who is jealous about his wife for her licentiousness with others. And hence, these comparisons were written in the Torah about Him, Blessed be He, in order that they should enter the ears of the hearer (see Mishneh Torah, Laws of Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 4).",

And, if so, the heart of a person will not be properly purified only with the word of the lips, that he say between himself and the wall, \"I have sinned, I will not [do it] again.\" But when he does a great act for his sin, to take 'he-goats from his pens' and to exert himself  to bring them to the prepared house to the priest, and [do] all of the procedure that it written about the sacrifices of the sinners - from all of this great action - he will fix the badness of sin in his soul, and it will be avoided by him the [next] time.",
                "And I found with Ramban, may his memory be blessed, [an explanation] on the [level] of the simple meaning, similar to this reason. As he wrote (Ramban on Leviticus 1:9) in the name of others, and this is his language: Since the deeds of people are determined by thought, speech and action, God, may He be blessed, commanded that when he sins, he brings a sacrifice and place his hands upon him corresponding to the deed, and confess with his mouth corresponding to the speech, and burn the innards and the kidneys, as they are the instruments of thought and desire. And the limbs [of the sacrifice] correspond to the hands and feet of a person that does all of his work. And he sprinkles the blood on the altar corresponding to the blood of his soul, so that a person think in doing all of this that he sinned to God with his body and his soul, and it is fit for him that his blood be spilled and his body burnt; were it not for the kindness of the Creator, who took an exchange and ransom from him [in] the sacrifice - that its blood be instead of his blood and its soul be instead of his soul. And the central limbs correspond to his central limbs. And the portions with which to sustain the teachers of Torah [are so] that they will pray for him. And the daily sacrifice is because there is no saving the community from always sinning. And these words are tenable [and] grab the heart, like the words of classic homiletic teachings (Shabbat 87a). To here [are his words]. And he wrote at more length about the matter and wrote, \"And in the way of truth (mysticism), the sacrifices contain a hidden secret, etc.,\" as he wrote in his commentary on Parshat Vaykra.  ",
                "And we will add other things on the [level] of the simple meaning, and say that it is from this root that God commanded us to always sacrifice from things about which the heart of man covets, like meat and wine and bread, so that the heart be more aroused with this matter. And it [likewise] obligated the poor person to bring from his little [supply] of flour that his eyes and heart are upon all of the day. And there is another arousal of the heart with animal sacrifices from the angle of similarity, as human and animal bodies are similar in all of their matters - they are only differentiated that in this one, intellect was given into it, and not into that one. And when the human body goes out of the realm of the intellect at the time of the sin, he must know that he has entered the realm of animals at that time, as this is the only thing that differentiates them. And therefore he is commanded to take a body of flesh like him and to bring it to the place chosen for the raising of the intellect and to burn it there, and to forget its memory - it shall be completely [incinerated], 'it shall not be remembered and it shall not be thought of,' corresponding to his body - in order to form a strong image in his heart that any matter of a body without intellect is lost and completely null. And he should [thus] rejoice in his portion of an intelligent soul with which God has graced him, [and] which exists forever. And the body that cooperates with it will also exist in the revival [of the dead] on its account, in its following its counsel, meaning to say in its guarding itself from sin. And in his fixing this image in his soul, he will be very careful about sin. And the Torah promises that through this great act and through the obedience of its doer that he regret his sin from his heart and from his soul, [that] his accidental sin will be atoned. But this similarity will not suffice to atone for volitional sins, as one who sins volitionally will not be chastised by similarities and words, but only by \"the rod for the back of fools\" (Proverbs 26:3).",
                "And let it not be difficult to you in putting down this reason, how it is that we would ever bring a voluntary offering, as our reason also [explains] voluntary offerings: Since we have said that a sacrifice is an illustration of the lowering of bodies and the elevation of soul, the sacrificer will find benefit to [learn this] lesson, even without a known sin.",
                "And about the sacrifice of Azazel that would be sent alive to a place of destruction and of extinction, we will say about the simple understanding of the matter [as follows]: The complete sinner should not imagine that after his soul receive the punishment for [the] sins, it will return to stand in the place of the good or [that] there will be some survival and good - even if he is like Yerovam the son of Nevat and his colleagues - just like he sees the whole entire year that the body of the animal that is an illustration for the body of the sinner has some remnants in the House of God, may He be blessed, in the ashes that stay there at the time of the burning. [As] they do not take them out from the Temple until after much time. Therefore in [this] living goat that carries all of the sins, they will see a hint that a sinner whose sins are great - like the heretics and those that deny Torah or the revival of the dead, and all of those that oppose Israel are included [as well] - will never see any good, and 'their worm will never die and their fire will never be extinguished.' [It is] like the procedure of this goat - [that] in his carrying the multitude of sins of all of Israel, is sent completely to a desolate land. He is not found in the House of God, not for slaughter and not for sprinkling - 'its memory will be lost from the earth.' And this is [the meaning of] what they, may their memory be blessed, said (Talmud Yerushalmi Yoma 6:3) that at the time that Israel was accepted, [the goat] would not reach halfway [down] the mountain before it would become [detached,] limb [from] limb - to show them the illustration of a compete sinner. As so will he be quickly destroyed, and he will be entirely, completely destroyed. [This is] in order that they would learn and [understand] the lesson and improve their ways. And this sign is good for them, as only he who loves one teaches him lessons, as it is written (Proverbs 13:24), \"but he who loves him disciplines him early.\"",
                "And regarding the division of the sacrifices in their slaughtering and the giving of the blood and the portion of the priests and the rest of its many details, were we to say that the thought of the servant [making the sacrifice] be directed to the [parts of the] multitudinous service - as the distinctions would require the direction of thought to the matter - the only thing that would come up in our hands would be the words of youths. And the principle of the thing is that even in the simple understandings, we cannot find our hand or feet without the support of the mystics (kabbalists). And we bow our heads to them and they should open our eyes about all of this.",
                "However we should not be called from the group of fools, in our spending all of our breath on [empty] words; as in much waste, a little food can sometimes be found. Also because we have seen our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, saying [words] similar to our words: As they said about the sacrifice of a <i>sotah</i> (a suspect of adultery) (Sotah 14a), \"She did an animal act, therefore she should bring barley (animal food)\"; and with the sacrifice of a <i>metsora</i> (Vayikra Rabbah 16, Arakhin 16b), \"He did an act of chatter, he should bring birds.\" And similar to this, they, may their memory be blessed, said regarding the matter of a menstruant woman, \"Why did the Torah say that she sit seven clean days? That she be most dear to him.\" And in truth, none of all this is in their opinion the ultimate intent of the things. Rather, it is to inform that the matter of the commandment includes many hints, besides the great and strong fundamentals. ",
                "From the laws of the commandment is that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Zevachim 112b) that before the Temple was built in Jerusalem, they would sacrifice in other places; but from when the Temple was built, all of the places were forbidden to build a house for the sake of God and to sacrifice there - as it is stated (Psalms 132:14), \"This is the place of My resting forever and ever. And these are the things that are the main part of the building of the Temple: We make a Holy and a Holy of Holies there; and in front of the Holy is another place and it is called the chamber, and the three of them are called the sanctuary (Mishnah Middot 4:6); and we make a partition around the sanctuary distant from it, like the curtains of the courtyard that were in the wilderness; and everything that is encircled by this partition, which is like the courtyard of the tent of meeting is called the yard - and the whole thing is called the Temple (<i>mikdash</i>) - and we make the vessels in the Temple that are written in the Torah that we need there. And that which they said (Zevachim 88a) that we immediately melt down all holy vessels that become pierced or cracked and make new ones; and [that] we do not fix a knife, the blade of which is detached or dented, but rather bury it immediately, as there is no poverty in a place of wealth. And [that] we make boundaries in the yard - up until here for Israel, up until here for the priests. And [that] close to it, we build enclosures to use for all the needs of the Temple, and each one is called a compartment. And the rest of its details, such as how was the building of the Temple, its form, all of its measurements, the building of the altar and its ordinances – are [all] elucidated in Tractate Middot. And so [too,] the form of the menorah, the table, and the golden altar and their place in the chamber are in the Gemara, [in] Meanchot and Yoma.",
                "And this commandment is practiced at the time that most of Israel is upon their land. And this is from the commandments that are not impingent upon the individual, but rather upon all of the community.

As the understanding of 'practiced throughout the generations' is not that the doing of that commandment never cease from Israel ever at any time. Rather the matter is like this: Any commandment that was only commanded to do at a specific time and not more - such as that which is written (Exodus 19:15), \"Be in preparation for three days\"; and so [too,] the warning of Sinai (Exodus 34:3), \"neither shall the flocks and the herds graze across from that mountain\"; and all that is similar to it, wherein the command was only temporary - those are called commandments that are not practiced throughout the generations. But any commandment that we were not commanded about [only] for a specific time - even though there is a pause at any given time because of our exile or by reason of something else, such as now when, on account of our sins, we do not have the ark - is called a commandment practiced throughout the generations. As any time that we have the ark, we are obligated not to remove its poles from it, so that the Levites [may] take [the ark] out with them, if we need to bring it from one place to another place as a result of war or from whatever reason that [may] arise.",

And [so], we have been commanded all glory and all majesty towards it, to all of our ability. Therefore, we were commanded not to remove the poles of the ark from it, lest we need to go out with the ark to any place quickly, and maybe due to the preoccupation and the rush, we will not check well that its poles are strong enough; and lest, God forbid, it will fall from their hands, and this is not [fit for] its glory. But with their always being ready and not being removed from it, we will make them very strong, and [so] there will not be a mishap with them. And another reason [is] that the forms of all of the vessels of the Temple are required to hint to great and lofty matters, so that a person is impressed by them for the good, in the course of his thinking about them.

                "It is from the roots of this commandment that God, blessed be He, commanded us the constant commandment of the bread, on account that through it a man lives; and as a result, [the commandment] is needed by him for blessing to always be found in [his bread]. And from our involvement in it to fulfill the commandment of God, may He be blessed, the [Divine] will and blessing will descend upon us, and that which is similar to it will be blessed. And according to each and every matter upon which he places the conglomeration of his focus, his thoughts and his activities by way of a commandment - according to them, a similar blessing will emerge upon him. And so I have found [in] Ramban (Ramban on Exodus 25:24). And [it] is like the matter that they, may their memory be blessed, said (Rosh HaShanah 16:1), \"Bring the <i>omer</i> (barley offering) in front of Me at Pesach, in order that the grain in the fields will be blessed for you; pour the water in front of Me on the Festival (Sukkot), in order that the rains of blessing will be blessed for you in the coming year; blow the ram's horn (shofar) in front of Me, in order to remember the binding of Yitschak.\" And they said about this very same bread (Megillah 26b) that because it is an accessory of the commandment, and through it the will of God is done, blessing would cling to it more. And [so] each one of the priests who had from it coming to him would be twice as satiated. ",
                "We were commanded in all of these things, such as the table, the menorah, the bread of display and the sacrifices, from the angle of the receivers (people), and like the matter that I wrote. There is no doubt or qualm to anyone who understands, or student that is not lacking in comprehension in the world who would think that with the arrangement of bread in the Temple upon the table, which we place  complete and we take [away] complete, that there is any benefit (enjoyment) accrued by the Above, God forbid - not in its appearance, not in its smell and not from any angle. Rather, He commanded us like this in His desire, blessed be He, that we be blessed from Him, in His great trait of kindness. And [this is] also [true about] the frankincense that comes with the bread, about which it is written, \"a burnt offering to the Lord.\" And [when] some of the commentators (Rashi on Leviticus 24:7) said that there is nothing from the bread that is for the Above except for the frankincense, their intention was not, God forbid, that there be any distinction between the frankincense and the bread for the Above. And the fulfillment of the commandment of God is the same with the bread and the frankincense: As just like God, blessed be He, commanded to arrange the bread in front of Him, so too is His will done, with the frankincense that He commanded to burn, and they burned it - one standard for all. Rather, all of these matters were written from the angle of those involved [in them]. As it cannot be written about the bread - that we feed the priests - that it is all for God; as others have a portion in it. But with anything that man does not have any benefit in it at all, and it is completely consumed in the commandment - with that we can say about it that it is completely for God. [That] means to say that all of it is included in the commandment - no man ate from it, nor enjoyed any physical benefit from it at all. And since smell is not from the pleasures of the body, but rather from the pleasures of the spirit - as the body only receives tangible pleasure - the matter of smell is always attributed to God, blessed be He. [This is] even though He, blessed be He and blessed be His name, is not - due to His supernal level and His greatness - connected to these matters at all; as He is not a body, and not the attribute of a body. This is known to all that understand. And they, may their memory be blessed, already explained (Rashi on Zevachim 46b, s.v. <i>hanachat ruach</i>) [that] every place that it is stated, \"a pleasing smell to the Lord\" (for example, Leviticus 1:9), [it means] \"I said something, and My will was done.\" And so [too,] \"And the Lord smelled the pleasant smell\" (Genesis 8:21), [should be understood] in this way. This is what appears [correct] to us regarding the matter of the arranging of the bread in the House of God. And Rambam, may his memory be blessed, wrote (Guide for the Perplexed 3:45), and this is his language: But I do not know a reason for the table and the bread always being put upon it; and to this day, I do not know to what thing to ascribe it.",

And for great distancing, they, may their memory be blessed, also forbade (Avodah Zarah 29b) all wine of a gentile, even though we do not know that he used it as an idolatrous libation. And this is called their undifferentiated wine (<i>stam yeinam</i>). However, they, may their memory be blessed, distinguished (Avodah Zarah 74a) between known libations and their undifferentiated wine - as the prohibition of the known is [prohibited] by Torah writ for the smallest amount. And we administer lashes for it, as it is written (Deuteronomy 13:18), \"Nothing is to cling to your hand from the anathema.\" But with the prohibition of their undifferentiated wines, which is only rabbinic, the [punishment] for its drinking is only lashes of rebellion for one who drinks a <i>revi’it</i> of it. But it does not [carry] lashes of rebellion for less than a <i>revi’it</i>. And nonetheless even the smallest amount is rabbinically forbidden to benefit from. And regarding other things in the world besides wine, they, may their memory be blessed, were not stringent to forbid everything found in their hand undifferentiated - out of the concern for sacrifices to idol worship or the concern [that it is] itself idolatry, besides with things that are [specifically] made for it; for example, that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Avodah Zarah 41a) regarding idols, that undifferentiated idols are made for idol worship. And therefore, they forbade them. And even one who finds them discarded is not allowed to take them without well-known conditions, as they, may their memory be blessed, explained (Avodah Zarah 41a). And so [too,] is it certainly with anything that an Israelite thinks was made as a sacrifice - that it is forbidden to take of them.",

And do not let it be difficult to you, how is it that a gentile can forbid the wine of an Israelite, since we have it established that a person can not bring a prohibition to something that is not his (Chullin 40b). As this is not said except in a case such as if he bows down to his friend's animal, where he did not do an act to the body of the thing. But anytime he does an act to the body of the thing - and even a minor act, like this of touching - he has the power to forbid a thing that is not his, rabbinically. However it is not [forbidden] by Torah writ until he does a major act, such as slaughtering his animal, which is a major act; and so [too,] if he poured wine in front of the actual idol, that is also a major act. But regarding touching the wine not in front of the idol, it is a minor act. And since it is minor and the prohibition is only rabbinic, they, may their memory be blessed, permitted  (Avodah Zarah 59b) one to take repayment from the one who made it forbidden for that which he made forbidden. And even though they were stringent about the body of the thing to forbid its benefit, they were not stringent about its payment; as payment [here] is only a type of repayment for damage. And [so] he does not benefit from the forbidden thing, but rather takes payment for his damage from the one who made it forbidden.",
                "And so [too,] were they, may their memory be blessed, very strict in the distancing of wine that has been libated in front of an actual idol or about any thing of idolatry more than with any other prohibitions in the Torah. As you don't have anything [else] in all of the Torah the benefit of which is forbidden, that when it is mixed with something permissible and it is not recognizable, does not have a remedy, [so] as to benefit [from what was permissible] - even something wet in something wet - with that which Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said in the Gemara (Avodah Zarah 74a): that he should sell it all to gentiles except for the value of the prohibited matter in it. And that is when it is from the things that are not purchased [by Jews] from a gentile, so that no Israelite man will stumble through them and purchase it from the gentile. But with true wine libations and with all idolatrous things, they do not have the remedy of selling it all to the gentile, etc. And all the more so, do they not have the remedy of taking [its] benefit to the Dead Sea. However, [it is] only when true wine libations were mixed - and even one drop of it - that there is no remedy for its benefit ever. But if a barrel of it got mixed with other barrels of kosher wine - since the actual body of the prohibition did not mix, but rather each [barrel] stands on its own - it has a remedy with the remedy of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, that he sell all of it to the gentiles, etc. And so [too,] with their undifferentiated wine, do they have a remedy with the remedy of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel - even when they actually got mixed - like the law of other prohibitions; as it is not fully wine libations.

                "And you must also know that [in] all of the prohibitions of the Torah, the mixture of which is forbidden to benefit from, it is only forbidden if there is enough of the forbidden food mixed into the permissible food to give off taste into the permissible food - unless that forbidden food is an important thing. As any important thing, such as a portion [with which it] is fit to honor [others] and similar to it, is forbidden in the smallest amount. But anything that is not an important thing does not forbid a mixture unless there is enough in it to give off taste. [This is] except for, wine libations and all matters of idolatry which forbid in the smallest amount, to benefit from everything that is mixed with them (Avodah Zarah 73a), as we said. And there is nothing else in the world at all that is an exception to this principle except for forbidden mixtures of the vineyard (and <i>orlah</i>, the fruit of trees for the first three years), and chamets on Pesach, according to the opinion of some commentators who forbid their mixture of one in two hundred - whether in its own type [of food] or whether not in its type - and (tithes) (<i>orlah</i>) [a burnt offering] with [a mixture] of one in a hundred. And regarding the matter of the remedy that they have, we have already said that there is the remedy of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel for all of the prohibitions, except for all of the prohibitions of idolatry wherein the prohibited object was itself actually added. As there is no remedy for it ever, and this is from the stringency of idolatry. 'And turn and turn in' the Gemara, as you will find all of this elucidated with the good commentaries.

They also stressed its distancing by saying that [perhaps] the payment of one who is paid to break barrels of wine libations should be prohibited, because he desires its existence for a short time; meaning to say that he wants that the wine should be preserved in the barrels until he breaks them, so that he will gain his payment for breaking them. As they, may their memory be blessed, wanted to uproot [it] from our thoughts that we should not want its preservation for even one moment, due to our great disgust with all types of idolatry.

And [it is] as they, may their memory be blessed, said (Eruvin 96a), [that] every place where it states, \"guard yourself,\" or \"lest\" or \"do not,\" it is nothing but a negative commandment.

As with other prohibitions, the liability is only if he enjoys his eating. But here even if he does not enjoy his eating, once he swallows it - and even if he swallows it hot and he burns his throat with it, and similar to it - he is lashed nonetheless.

And you should not ask further, \"And why did the [Torah] not write, 'You shall not eat' in one of them and it would suffice with two?\" As I have informed you that it was for a purpose that Scripture did not mention it with the expression of eating, as the liability for it is even if it is not in the way of its enjoyment. We have learned from here that the intention of that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Chullin 115b) \"One is for the prohibition of eating, one is for the prohibition of benefiting and one is for the prohibition of cooking,\" is not that the third verse be a [separate] negative commandment, but rather that we need to learn from it about benefiting.

And they relied for this upon that which it is written, \"kid\" three times in the Torah, which is an expression of exclusion, as it should have [otherwise] written, \"meat.\" And the explanation about this came (Chullin 113a), \"'A kid' and not an impure beast, 'a kid' and not a [wild] animal, 'a kid' and not a bird.\" And therefore, they, may their memory be blessed, said that it is permitted to cook these three with milk, and they are permitted in benefit. But they, may their memory be blessed, prohibited them in eating to make a fence for the meat of a beast, which is forbidden by Torah writ, so that people do not switch [one] meat for [another] meat. And hence since the thing is [plausible] that [one] meat will be switched with [another] meat, they were also stringent with this fence, exactly like they were with the meat of beast in some matters, such that they forbade that they be brought up [together] on a table at all. And according to the opinion of some commentators, they obligated about them that there be a pause between their eating and the eating of cheese, like with the main prohibition, which is the meat of a beast. But with the meat of fish and locusts, they did not make a fence with them all, as their meat is not at all similar to the meat of a beast, and people will not come to err in this.",

And if this piece fell into a stew of meat or a stew of milk, we measure against all of [the piece]. And this is what, they, may their memory be blessed, said (Chullin 108a) \"The piece itself becomes a carcass.\" And the reason is because their mixture is what makes them prohibited. And hence, after they have mixed, behold, they are like a piece of carcass. And with other prohibitions, it is not such; as [with] prohibited food that is mixed with a piece of permissible food and there is not sixty parts in the permissible food to negate the prohibited food, and afterwards they fall into a stew, we only measure according to the measurement of the prohibited food that fell into it, and [the permissible portion of the piece] itself helps to [count against] the prohibited food. [This is] because that piece does not become a carcass, and [so] the permissible food in it is found to be like the rest of the permissible food in the stew - and [so] it assists [in counting against] the prohibited food.

And therefore the udder is permitted [to be eaten] with its milk, according to Torah writ. However the sages forbade it as a fence, until one removes its milk from it, as is elucidated in its place (Chullin 109b). And there are two dispensations for milk that is found in the stomach [of an animal]: one, that it is included in [the category of] the milk of a dead [one]; and also since it is only like refuse more generally - as it has already been digested there. And therefore it is permissible from the outset. And it is not necessary to say that that which is found coagulated there is permissible - as it is certainly like refuse - but even that which is liquid was permitted by the Geonim.

And so too is the sinning soul, from the angle of the weakness of its intellect, ending and lost also, if it becomes habituated to animal actions which are the sins - as sin only comes from an animal root.",

And there are nine of the individual and these are them: 1) The meal-offering of a sinner - and that is the meal-offering that a poor person offers when he is liable for a sin-offering, but his hand does not reach [a more expensive sacrifice]; 2) the meal-offering of the <i>sotah</i>, which is the meal-offering of jealousy that is written in Parshat Nasso (Numbers 5:15); 3) the meal-offering that every priest offers when he enters the service that he offers in his hand, and this is called the meal-offering of inauguration; 4) the meal-offering that the high priest offers every day, and it is called the griddled meal-offering; 5) the meal-offering of fine flour, and it comes as an oath or a vow; 6) the meal-offering of the griddle, and it comes as an oath or a vow; 7) the meal-offering of the pan, and it comes as an oath or a vow; 8) the oven-baked meal-offering that is loaves, and it comes as an oath or a vow; 9) the oven-baked meal-offering that comes soaked in oil, and it comes as an oath or a vow. From these meal-offerings, some of them are fine wheat flour and some are barley; some of them are eaten by the priests except for the handful and some are all burnt. And one of them is chamets and that is the two breads of the day of Shavouot, as they are also called '<i>mincha</i>,' but they are not offered on top of the altar. And it was not stated in the Torah about the two breads, when it more generally forbade, \"Any meal-offering that you offer to the Lord, you shall not make chamets\" (Leviticus 2:11). [Rather,] it specified these and excluded them from the rule. And about them is it stated there (Leviticus 2:12), \"A first sacrifice shall you bring them to the Lord\" - meaning to say, with these I did not prohibit chamets to you. And nonetheless, they would not go up on the altar, since there was chamets in them, and as it is stated about them, \"upon the altar they shall not be brought up as a pleasing smell.\" And all of the rest was matsa. And the order of their bringing was thus (Sotah 14b): A man brings fine flour from his house in a vessel of silver or gold or of [another] metal and carries it to the priest; and the priest carries it to the altar, [he] skims a handful from it with the tips of his fingers and incinerates the handful; and the rest is eaten by the priests. This is the order of those eaten. And the order of those burned; the processes done with meal-offerings by non-priests and those done [only] by priests; and the rest of its details are elucidated in the tractate that is built upon this, and that it Tractate Menachot.",

And therefore the Torah did not concern itself about this with a communal meal-offering that comes from time to time, such as two breads of [Shavouot].

And so [too, we validate] from another deed that was challenged and [then] ratified by the court. ",
                "And that which they, may their memory be blessed, also said (Ketuvot 28a) that with testimony about a signature, a relative is trusted to testify about the writing of his relative, that he recognizes it - and he combines with another to validate the deed. And with this testimony a man is trusted when he is an adult to testify and say, \"When I was small, I saw the writing of my father - or my brother - and I recognize it now, that it is the one that I saw.\" And that which they said that ten creatures are disqualified for testimony from Torah writ, and like I wrote above in the commandment of \"do not place your hand with an evildoer to be a witness\" (Sefer HaChinukh 75). And so [too,] one who is not [involved] in Scripture, nor in Mishnah, nor in the way of the world (productive work) is disqualified by the words of [the Rabbis], as there is an assumption about him that he is an evildoer - and behold, it is written (Exodus 23:1), \"do not place [...] an evildoer to be a witness.\" But if he has [involvement] in the way of the world and is involved in some commandments, we accept his testimony, even though he is an ignoramus. You will be found to say that any Torah scholar is assumed to be fit until he is disqualified and [any] ignoramus is assumed to be disqualified until his status is established with us for the good. And so [too,] the most debased men are disqualified [rabbinically], such as those that eat in the marketplace in front of everyone. And included in the debased (Sanhedrin 26b) are those that consume the charity of gentiles publicly. And the rest of its details are elucidated in Sanhedrin and in Shevuot (see Mishneh Torah, Laws of Testimony 1).",

And one who transgresses it and does not testify - in monetary laws when he is solicited by a party in the case or [by] the court; and with capital laws, or blows or Torah prohibitions, on his own - has violated a positive commandment. And his punishment is very great, as civilizations are preserved with the power of testimony. Therefore, it it written about it (Leviticus 5:1), \"if he does not say, he will carry his iniquity.\" And if the testimony that he suppressed was monetary testimony and the witness denied it and swore about it - meaning to say, he swore that he does not know testimony for him - he is obligated to bring a sacrifice that varies up and down; and under the conditions that are known about the matter, as it is explained in its place in Shevuot 30a.

For these sins, a person is obligated to bring a sacrifice that varies up and down - meaning to say, according to the wealth or poverty of a person; as it is explicit in the verse (Leviticus 5:1), \"And if a soul shall sin and he heard the voice of an oath\" - meaning to say the voice of the oath that they swore him to, whether he knows testimony, \"if he does not say, he will carry his iniquity.\" And the end of the matter is (Leviticus 5:6), \"And he shall bring his guilt-offering.\" And it is not stated there, \"and it was hidden from him,\" to teach that he is liable for the sacrifice, whether [he is] inadvertent or volitional.",
                "And it is written about impurity of the Temple and its consecrated foods (Leviticus 5:2), \"Or a soul that touches anything impure, etc. and it was hidden from him\"; and it is stated about it all at the end of the matter (Leviticus 5:6), \"And he shall bring his guilt-offering.\" And the verse does not come explicitly that the liability of the impure one there would be with his entering the Temple or with his eating consecrated meat. Rather, we have understood from the tradition that it speaks about this (Shevuot 6b). And even though the thing is from the tradition, we have found the liability for excision for one who ate consecrated [food] or entered the Temple explicit in another place, as it is stated (Leviticus 7:20), \"And the soul that eats meat from the sacrifice of the peace-offering that is to the Lord and his impurity is upon him, he shall be excised\"; and another verse (Numbers 19:20) states about the impure one that enters the Temple, \"for the Temple of the Lord he has made impure, and he shall be excised.\" And once excision has been written about its volitional transgression, there is a sacrifice for its inadvertent transgression - with our rule, that everything that is with excision for its volitional transgression, is with a sin-offering for its inadvertent transgression. And it is written about an oath of expression (Leviticus 5:4-6), \"Or if a soul swears to express with his lips, etc. and it was hidden from him, etc. And he shall bring his guilt-offering.\" And from where [do we know] that the liability there [for them] is with a sacrifice that varies up and down? As it is written in the section (Leviticus 5:11), \"And if his hand does not reach, etc.\" ",
                "From the roots of the commandment, we have already said (Sefer HaChinukh 95) that the matter of the sacrifice is to remind - and to have the thinker place in his heart - by force of action that he made his deeds bad; and that he request forgiveness about the past and be careful about the future. And it is from His wisdom, blessed be He, and His awareness of the lightness of people's intellect, the limitation of their understanding and the weakness of their power, that He was lenient upon them [regarding] the atonement of these sins that are mentioned - that they be according to the wealth of people or their poverty - as stumbling in them is [common] for people. As there is no doubt that (every) sin of the the tongue is more [common] and frequent than the sin of action. And this will suffice for you about oaths.",
                "And also regarding the impurity of the Temple and its consecrated [foods], it is known that stumbling is common with it. As the matter of purity is very difficult for any man to guard it, to the point that the pure man must be careful from approaching [other] people out of the concern for impurity. And the matter would be lengthy if I had come to write of the several angles of stumbling that are found with it - however, it is known to all that understand (See Guide for the Perplexed 3:41).",
                "And from this root that we have said - that stumbling in these matters is [common] - He was further lenient upon them with testimony of an oath that they bring atonement whether [he was] inadvertent or volitional. As since the matter of testimony is very frequent, 'and the impulse of the heart of man is bad,' they [can] attribute the falsehood to forgetting and not be precise in their testimony. There are also some among the creatures that do not [pay so much attention] to the great evil they are doing in swaying the direction of the testimony - since they did not steal and did not extort with their hands. Even though a man is oppressed and broken because of them, they do not [pay attention] to this. And so from the frequency of the matter and its lightness in the eyes of the masses of people, it was from His kindnesses, may He be blessed, that the atonement be whether for the inadvertent or for the volitional.",
                "And yet one who is understanding among people knows that everything from which God distances us - even if He gives atonement for the thing - is fitting for us to distance with the utmost distancing. And the matter is as if God, blessed be He, informs people, \"It is not My will that you do thing x in any fashion. However one of you who stumbles and transgresses it should repent with all of his might, protect himself with many fences and bring a sacrifice to fix the thing in his heart, that he not stumble in it again.\" And nonetheless, that person is not saved from having transgressed the commandment of his Creator. ",
                "From the laws of the commandment is that each one of these four sins obligates its doer to bring a ewe or a female goat, like the well-known law of the fixed sin-offering; and he is only exempted with fowl or flour if he is poor. But if he is poor and he brings a ewe or  a female goat, he has not fulfilled his obligation. And the reason is that since God, blessed be He,  had mercy upon him and exempted him with [something less expensive] it is not appropriate that he push himself to bring more than what his hand can reach. And from this, every understanding person will acquire good counsel: to not make expenditures [that are] more than what is fitting according to his money - as this is a cause to steal from the creatures when he seeks that to which he is accustomed and does not find [it]. And they also said (Keritot 27b) that one who was wealthy and separated money to buy a ewe or a female goat with it and became poor and needs the money, should take two doves or two young pigeons; and he should say, \"Behold this money is rendered profane upon these birds.\" And afterwards, he may benefit from all of the money. And so [too, if] he separated money for fowl and became poor and needed them, he renders them profane on a tenth of an <i>eifah</i> of flour, and benefits from [the money]. And so [too,] a poor person who separated money for a tenth of an <i>eifah</i> [of flour] and became wealthy, adds upon it and brings a ewe or a female goat. And for this matter, a wealthy person is called one so long as he has [the wealth]. And the liability for these sacrifices is only when inadvertent - and with an oath of testimony even when volitional - but if under duress, there is no liability for a sacrifice with any of them (Shevuot 31b). As the Torah exempts any [one under] duress from any liability (Pesachim 71b).",
                "The sides that are in oaths through which a person is called under duress and exempt or inadvertent and liable, and the sides that he is only liable for one sacrifice even for many oaths (Shevuot 31b) or a sacrifice for each and every oath. And so [too,] the sides to make liable or exempt regarding the sacrifice for the impurity of the Temple and impurity of its consecrated [foods] - the side to obligate is when the sinner has awareness of the impurity and the consecrated [food] or the Temple, at first and likewise at the end, but it was hidden [from him] in the middle. How is this? He became impure and he knew that he became impure, and consecrated meat came to his hand and he knows that it is consecrated meat, or he comes to enter the Temple and he knows that it is the Temple - such that he has awareness of the impurity and of the consecrated at the beginning. And afterwards [it is] hidden, as he forgot his impurity and thought that he was pure, and likewise that the consecrated [foods] or the Temple became hidden from him and he thought them to be non-sacred, and he ate from the consecrated [foods] or he entered the Temple, such that this is hiddenness in the middle. And afterwards, it becomes known to him that he was impure or that the meat was consecrated or that they were in the Temple, such that this is awareness at the end. In such a manner [must] he bring a sacrifice; and about this did our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, say, (Shevuot 2a), \"Awareness at the beginning and at the end and hiddenness in the middle.\"",
                "And the side of exemption is (for example,) that he became impure and he did not know that he became impure and he entered the Temple or ate consecrated meat, and afterwards it became known to him that he had become impure. In this manner, he is exempt from a sacrifice. And this law is not like other liabilities for excision [when volitional and a sacrifice when inadvertent] in the Torah. As with other excisions - once he knows at the end, even if did not know at the beginning, he is liable for a sacrifice. And the verse determines to judge like this here, as it is written about the impurity of the Temple and its consecrated [foods] (Leviticus 5:2), \"and it was hidden from him\" - [which] implies that there was a time of awareness at the beginning; and afterwards it is stated, \"and he knew.\" Behold, you have learned that that it needs awareness at the beginning and awareness at the end and hiddenness in the middle. But with other [instances of those] that are liable for excisions, it is written (Leviticus 4:27-28), \"in his doing one of the commandments of the Lord which shall not be done, etc. Or his sin is made known to him\" - meaning to say, once he knew at the end, even if he did not know at the beginning. As behold, it is not written there, \"and it was hidden,\" from which we would learn awareness at the beginning.",
                "And also from the matter of the commandment is that which they said (Shevuot 2a) that one who has awareness at the beginning but not at the end may not bring atonement, as they said that the goat of Yom Kippur, that is executed inside, and Yom Kippur itself, puts it into the balance until it is made known to him and he brings the sacrifice for his atonement. But one who has no awareness at the beginning, but has awareness at the end - about which we said, he does not bring a sacrifice - the goat executed outside, and Yom Kippur, atone for him. And for the one that has no awareness, not at the beginning and not at the end, the goats of the holidays, and the goats of Rosh Chodesh, atone. And for volitional impurity of the Temple and its consecrated [foods], the bull of the high priest atones - if the volitional [party] is a priest. But if he was from Israel, the blood that is executed inside and Yom Kippur atone, as it stated (Leviticus 16:16), \"And atone for the Holy from the impurities of the Children of Israel.\" And that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Horayot 9a), \"As with these four sins, all are equal in the sacrifice - the king, the anointed priest and the commoner\" - as there is no distinction among them in their sacrifice except for the commandments for which they are obligated a fixed sin offering for their inadvertent transgression, but all are equal with these that their liability is [for a sacrifice] that varies up and down. And the rest of its details are elucidated in Keritot and Shevuot.",

And this is the slaughter of the fowl sin-offering. And the priest needs to not cut it all completely until the head be severed from the body. And about this is it stated, \"and he shall not sever.\" We have already said in the commandment of building the [Temple] (Sefer haChinukh 95) that we do not have the ability - nor does one whose 'small finger is thicker than our loins' - to find an argument about the details of the sacrifices even from the angle of its simple understanding. And it is enough for this work of ours to make known a little explanation about the content of the sacrifices more generally from the angle of the simple meaning.

And therefore his sacrifice does not need slaughter, so that the priest not need to look for the knife and to check it, and the poor person be [delayed] there in the meantime from his work. Also to expedite the speed, it stated that he begin across from its nape, since that is what is prepared [for] his hand, and that he not need to turn the neck to the side of the benchmarks.

And it is fitting for us to embellish the sacrifice of the poor person with all of our might; it is enough for him [to suffer] with his poverty - we should not add to his paucity by reducing the stature of his sacrifice. And all of this is from the foundation that we have built at the beginning - that it is from the roots of the sacrifices to acquire good and lofty traits for our souls, and to refine our deeds through the power of comparisons with that in which we are involved. As since man is physical, he cannot fashion and fix the things with a strong fashioning in his soul, except with actions. And until we hear another reason, we will hold on to this.",

He grabs the fowl's two legs between two of his fingers and its two wings between two of his fingers, and he stretches its neck upon the width of two of his fingers and does <i>melikah</i>. And this is from the hardest services in the Temple.\" But if he alters and grabs any place it is [still] fit. And any place on the altar is fit for <i>melikah</i> (Zevachim 63a).

And [so] he worries to himself as he does not know if he ate the one of forbidden fat or the one of permissible fat. This sacrifice that is brought upon this doubt is called an undetermined guilt-offering.

This is the explanation of its being undetermined. And the command for this sacrifice is from that which it is written (Leviticus 5:17-18), \"And if a soul sins and does one of all of the commandments of the Lord which you shall not do and he does not know, but he is guilty and he shall bear his iniquity.

And from this reason they said that one who has sexual relations with a woman the divorce of which is in doubt is liable for a sacrifice; as behold there is an established prohibition here, such that we evaluate her according to [that which is] established about her. But one who has sexual relations with a woman the marriage of which is in doubt is exempted from a sacrifice, as there is no established prohibition here; and behold it is like one piece with a doubt if it is forbidden fat or permitted fat, such that he is exempted from a sacrifice (Ketuvot 22b), as we have said.

And it is a sacrifice of a ram that needs to be worth two <i>sela</i> (Keritot 22b). And there are some of these sins for which this sacrifice comes, that are whether he sinned inadvertently or whether volitionally; and there are some for which it only comes specifically for the inadvertent, but not for the volitional.",
                "And one of these sins is one that illegally has money of a Jew in his hand, from the worth of a small coin and up - for example, he robs him or steals from him, or [money] that remained in his hand from a deposit that was deposited with him or because of a loan or a partnership. The principle of the matter is that [in a case] if he were to admit to him, he would be liable to pay by law, and the robbed or oppressed - or his inheritor or one that comes by his authority - sues him for it, but he denies it and swears falsely about it; when he repents and regrets his sin and returns the 'loot that is in his hand,' he is liable to bring this sacrifice that we said for his sin, besides the fifth that he is obligated to add on the principle and to give to the robbed, as it is stated (Leviticus 5:21), \"A soul that sinned and misappropriated a misappropriation from God and denies his kinsman, etc.\" And Rabbi Akiva says, \"What do we learn to say [from] 'a misappropriation from God?' Because any lender and borrower act only with witnesses, [therefore] when he denies, he only denies the witnesses; but one who borrows without witnesses and denies it, he denies the Third Party among them\" - the Divine Presence - \"That is why it states, 'and misappropriated a misappropriation from God and denies his kinsman, etc.'\" (Sifra, Vayikra Dibbura d'Chovah, Chapter 22:4). And it is written after it (Leviticus 5 23-25), \"And it shall be when he sins and is guilty\" - meaning to say that he will repent, such that he takes responsibility for his own guilt - \"and return the theft, etc. and he shall pay it from its principle, and a fifth shall he add upon it, etc. And he shall bring his guilt-offering to the Lord, a ram, etc.\" And this is what is called the guilt-offering of thefts; and this is from those that come whether for the inadvertent or for the volitional.

But in the section above, there is a definite guilt-offering mentioned, similar to this, that is  also called a definite guilt-offering; and it is (called) the guilt-offering of misappropriations - meaning to say, [for] one who misappropriates and derives benefit from the consecrated things. And therefore, the expression, <i>meilah</i> is applied to it, which is something very bad. And one who extends his hand to derive benefit from the money of the Heavens is similar to giving over (the property of others). And this guilt-offering comes only for the inadvertent, and as we wrote above in its place (Sefer HaChinukh 127).",

And this is also whether he became impure volitionally or indavertently. And the Torah further also obligated this sacrifice for a <i>metsora</i> when he is purified from his <i>tsaraat</i> - and as we will write with God's help in the Order of Zot Tehiyeh Torat Hametsora (Sefer HaChinukh 177). And there is no need to explain inadvertent and volitional about this, as the notion of inadvertent and volitional is not relevant here.",
                "And the Torah further also obligated this sacrifice for one who has sexual relations with a designated maidservant; and as it is written in the Order of Kedoshim Tehiyu, as it is stated (Leviticus 19:20-21), \"If a man lays with a woman, etc. and she is a maidservant designated (<i>charufah</i>) for a man, but has not been redeemed with redemption, etc. there shall be an investigation, etc. And he shall bring his guilt-offering[, etc.] a ram of guilt.\" And this is from those that come whether for inadvertent transgression or volitional (Keritot 9a). It comes out that with all of them, there are five definite guilt-offerings. And so did the Sages, may their memory be blessed, count in the Mishnah, such that they said (Mishnah Zevachim 5:5), \"These are the guilt-offerings: 1) The guilt-offering of thefts; 2) the guilt-offering of misappropriations; 3) the guilt-offering of the designated maidservant; 4) the guilt-offering of the nazirite; 5) the guilt offering of the <i>metsora</i>.\" And [regarding] the undetermined guilt-offering which is counted there, its name is upon it [to show] that it is not from the group of definite guilt-offerings. And from these five, three of them come whether they are inadvertent or volitional - and they are the guilt-offering of thefts, the guilt-offering of the designated maidservant and the guilt-offering of the nazirite; and one of them only comes for inadvertent transgression and not for volitional transgression - and that is the guilt-offering of misappropriations; and [for] the fifth - which is the guilt offering of the <i>metsora</i> - the expression, inadvertent and volitional, is not relevant, as we said.",
                "And since the designated maidservant 'has come to our hand, let us say a thing about her.' And even though it is not from this Order - since it is not from the tally of the commandments, I have no [other] place to speak about it besides here. The understanding of <i>charufah</i> is, designated, meaning to say, betrothed. And they said in the Gemara at the beginning of the first chapter of Kiddushin 6a, that so [was it] in Yehudah, that they would call a betrothed woman, a <i>charufah</i>. And the verse is speaking about a Canaanite (gentile) maidservant that is half a maidservant and half a free woman. And this is that which is written about her, \"but has not been redeemed with redemption\" - meaning to say she is redeemed but not redeemed: for example, she paid her master half of her money. And she is betrothed (to an Israelite slave or) to another Israelite (see Mishneh Torah, Laws of Forbidden Intercourse 3:13). About this is it stated that if another man has sexual relations with her - whether inadvertently or volitionally - he is liable to bring this sacrifice that is called a guilt-offering, and it is a ram that is worth two <i>sela</i> or more. And because of this, the atonement of a sacrifice is enough for the one that has sexual relations with her - since her betrothal is not full betrothal as if she had been a free woman. As with a betrothed free woman, the one who has sexual relations with her is liable for the death penalty. But with this one, her betrothal is not full because of the half of her that is still in the category of being a maidservant; and therefore it is enough with the atonement of a sacrifice for the one that stumbles with her. The Torah was also lenient with her sexual relations to exempt one with a sacrifice even when volitional - which is not the way of other volitional transgressions, to exempt them with a sacrifice - since a woman maidservant, even though she is half redeemed, is light in the eyes of every man; and [so] stumbling is very easy with her, since the masses do not not think of her sexual relations to be a great sin. And hence their iniquity is removed and their sin is atoned with the sacrifice.  And similar to that which they, may their memory be blessed, said about other matters (Sanhedrin 106b), we can say here, \"The Merciful One wants the heart.\"",
                "And nonetheless the maidservant is liable for lashes, as we cannot say about her that she is light in her [own] eyes - and that because of that, she did not guard herself from licentiousness. But still, she also is not liable for lashes unless she has intercourse in the regular fashion, is an adult and volitional. And about her is it said, \"there shall be an investigation (<i>bikoret tehiyeh</i>)\" - as our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, expounded (Keritot 22a), \"bikrai tehe (she shall be with verses),\" meaning to say with lashes. And they, may their memory be blessed, said (Keritot 22a), \"She is lashed, and not he.\" And because of this did the Scripture express the lashes with this language of 'reading' - since they would read verses of rebuke over the one lashed while they were still lashing him, so that he understand and take instruction. And [these verses] are \"And the Lord will make wondrous, etc.\" (Deuteronomy 28:59).",
                "It is from the the roots of the commandment [that] a person not think that even though the matter of the prohibition of robbery is rectified by a positive commandment, as it is stated (Leviticus 5:23), \"and return the theft\" - that each one should go and rob what he wants from his fellow and imagine in his heart to say that when he has it and he return the theft, his iniquity will be atoned and he will be purified from it; and behold, it will be as if he never did it. And this would be an opening for sinners. Hence the Torah made known that even with the repayment with the addition of a fifth, he [still] needs a sacrifice for atonement, for his having sinned. And I have already written above (Sefer HaChinukh 123) about this matter, that nonetheless, it does not save him from having transgressed the will of his Creator. And it is a pity on his head that He transgressed the will of the Master of the Heavens, [even if] he sacrificed several [fat] sheep (peace-offerings) for burnt-offerings. And there I also wrote that the sacrifice and the principle impede the atonement, but the fifth does not impede [it].",

However, we can suppose that his punishment will not be so strong as it would have been, had he not returned the money. And the parable for this is about one who struck his fellow and became liable for a penalty to the king; and [then] he appeased the one struck, [such that] the only thing that remained upon him was the claim of the king."

That he return the intact item that he robbed.\" But if the theft changed in the possession of the robber, he is [only] obligated to repay its value, and he is exempted with that - even though the owners did not forsake it (Bava Kamma 66b). And what is a change that exempts from returning the theft? Like the change that he cannot reverse afterwards to its original state - for example, one who robs wood and burns it or cuts some of it up or digs holes in it; and so [too,] one who robs wool and dyes it or robs spun fabric and makes a garment out of it, and all that is similar to it. But one who robs boards of wood, even if he builds a box out of them - this is not a change that cannot revert to its original state. As behold, it is possible to dismantle them and they will go back [to being] boards as they had been. And therefore, he is obligated to return them intact. And so with all that is similar to this. ",

Any theft that is worth a small coin (<i>perutah</i>). But less than that is not in the category of repayment, even though he has transgressed a Torah prohibition. And as we shall write at length in the negative commandment of \"You shall not rob\" (Sefer HaChinukh, 20, 29), [it is] because Israelites are the children of Avraham, Yitschak and Yaakov - generous men, the children of generous men. And it is a well-known thing that that even a poor Israelite will pardon less than the worth of a <i>perutah</i> that was stolen from him, and he will not want to seek it at all. And therefore, they, may their memory be blessed, said (Bava Kamma 105a) that one who robs three bundles, worth three <i>perutah</i> at the time of the theft, and they depreciate in the hand of the robber and became worth two <i>perutah</i> - even though he returned two - he is obligated to return the third; since we judge according to the time of the robbery, and [the] third was already worth a <i>perutah</i> at that time. [If] he stole two that are worth one <i>perutah</i> [together] and he returned one, there is robbery here [but] there is not repayment here.",
                "And the laws of forsaking (<i>yiush</i>) and the transfer of domain are many. But the principle of the matter is thus according to that which appears from the Gemara: That any time that the [actual] theft is in the robber's hands - or even his son's - and it has not changed, they are obligated according to Torah writ to return it like it is to the one robbed. [And this is] even though we knew with certainty that the one robbed has forsaken it; and that is like they said in the Gemara (Bava Metzia 23a), \"For example, that people heard him saying, 'Woe to him for his loss'\" - meaning to say, that he concedes in his mind about that thing, that it is already lost from him, and his mind does not rely upon seeing it again. Even if [its value] appreciated in the hand of the robber, the appreciation is to the one who was robbed. And this is [the understanding] of that which is written in the Torah, \"and return the theft that he robbed.\" And the explanation comes - if it is the same as what he robbed, meaning that it has not changed, he must return it as it is, and even if it appreciated much.  ",
                "But the Sages ordained (Bava Kamma 94b), as a result of the Ordinance of the Penitents, that anything that appreciates in the hand of the robber after the forsaking be his. And [so] when he comes to return it, he calculates with the robbed one how much it was worth at the time of the robbery; and the robbed one pays him the money of that which it appreciated, and takes it. And the Sages have the power to do this thing, since they may do according to their will in a monetary matter - and even against the commands of the Torah. As it is well-known that what the court makes ownerless is ownerless (Yevamot 89b, Gittin 36b). And therefore if a gentile (to which the Ordinance does not apply) robbed and [the item] appreciated, whether before the forsaking or whether after the forsaking; or if an Israelite robbed it and he sold [it] to a gentile, and the gentile makes [it] appreciate - [the appreciation is for the one robbed. If he sold it (Minchat Yitschak)] before the forsaking, the law of the [purchaser] is like the law of the [robber] - as transfer of domain does not create acquisition without forsaking. But after the forsaking - whether that forsaking was after the theft came to the hand of the purchaser, or when it was still in the hand of the robber - since there was forsaking and a transfer of domain with this theft, the purchaser has acquired the body of the theft. And if that robber that sold it to him is a robber that is not famous, it is completely his; and he is not obligated to return anything to the one robbed. Rather the robbed one should go and sue the robber. But if he is a famous robber, the purchaser is obligated to return the value of the theft to the robbed one, and he sues the robber. ",
                "And the laws of the theft as to how far he is to burden himself to return it to its owners is like that which our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Bava Kamma 103a) that one who robs the worth of a <i>perutah</i> from his fellow is obligated to bring it after him, even to Medea - meaning to say to a far place. But in order to lighten his burden if the expense [to do this] is great, our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said that he leave it with the court and they know that this money is for x, and they give it to him when he happens by.",

And any meat that is found in the [Temple] yard as limbs is burnt-offerings - the understanding of which is that we treat them like burnt-offerings; and if it is found as pieces, they are sin-offerings; and that which is found in Jerusalem is a peace-offering (Mishnah Shekalim 7:2). And the difference that comes out of this is if one transgressed and ate from them, he brings his atonement according to this assumption. But they, may their memory be blessed, said about all [of them], \"Let their form be altered and [then] go out to the House of Burning, lest [they were] <i>notar</i>.\" And we only burn <i>notar</i> during the day, as it is stated, \"on the third day, it shall be brunt with fire\" (Pesachim 3a). And even though the peace-offerings are forbidden to eat from the beginning of the second night, we only burn them during the day. And the rest of its details are elucidated in Pesachim and at the end of Terumah (see Mishneh Torah, Laws of Sacrifices Rendered Unfit 19).",
                "And [it] is practiced at the time of the [Temple] by the males of the priesthood, as the service is for them. And a priest that transgresses and does not burn the <i>notar</i> has violated this positive commandment and has [also] violated the negative commandment of \"you shall not leave over.\" But we do not administer lashes for this negative commandment, as there is no act [involved] with it."

                "<b>To not eat <i>piggul</i>:</b>  To not eat <i>piggul</i> - And <i>piggul</i> is a sacrifice that the priest who is sacrificing it had a disqualifying thought at the time of the slaughter or offering. And a disqualifying thought is, for example, that he made up his mind at the time of the slaughter or offering that he would eat from that sacrifice after the limit for its eating or burn from it that which requires burning after the time limit for burning – as the 'eating' of the altar and the eating of a person is all expressed by eating. And the verse elucidated, that one who eats from it carries his iniquity, as it is stated (Leviticus 7:18), \"And if it is surely eaten, etc. and the soul who eats from it shall carry its iniquity.\" And the carrying of iniquity here is excision, as we shall learn in the Gemara (Zevachim 28b) through an inferential comparison (<i>gezara shava</i>). ",
                " And yet its warning – meaning to say, the explicit negative commandment, besides the punishment that is mentioned here – is from that which is written in the inauguration [of the tabernacle], \"it shall not be eaten, as it is holy\" (Exodus 29:34). And they, may their memory be blessed, said (Pesachim 24a) that this verse includes in its warning all that which has been spoiled of the [sacrifices] and is not fitting to eat, like <i>notar</i> and <i>piggul</i>. And likewise did they, may their memory be blessed, say (Avodah Zarah 66a) that they are included in the warnings, \"You shall not eat any abomination\" (Deuteronomy 14:3) – which they expounded (Chullin 114b), \"Anything that is abominable for me, is forbidden to eat.\" And since this is so, we shall say that [that warning (negative commandment) is to make one liable for] additional negative commandments; and the verse here is speaking about the punishment of the one who eats it, as so did the explanation come about it. And that which it stated (Leviticus 7:18), \"If it shall surely be eaten on the third day,\" is meaning to say that he thought about it to eat it on the third day. As so did they, may their memory be blessed, expound (Zevachim 29a), \"'And if it shall surely be eaten, etc.' – that is <i>piggul</i>.\" Bend your ear to hear that the verse is speaking about one who thinks to eat his sacrifice on the third day, that it is spoiled with this thought. And one who eats it is liable for excision, as it is stated about it, \"and the soul that eats from it will carry his iniquity.\" And it is stated about <i>notar</i> (Leviticus 19:8), \"And the one who eats it will carry his iniquity, as he has profaned the holy of the Lord, and he shall be excised.\" And we learned [about] it in Keritot 5a, \"Let not an inferential comparison (<i>gezara shava</i>) be light in your eyes; as behold <i>piggul</i> is one of the [important] bodies of Torah, and Scripture only taught it through a <i>gezara shava</i>.\" As we learn it] from <i>notar</i>, from [the use of] ‘iniquity’ [in both cases] – \"just like there it is excision, here too it is excision.\"",
                "From the roots of this commandment is the foundation that we have built at first – as we have said that the matter of the sacrifice is to refine the thoughts of people; and through the acts in their hands to fashion in their souls the evil of sin and the good of straight paths. Therefore in that the main cause of something is thoughts, it is fit to disqualify on account of a thought that leans away from that which is straight in any of his deeds. And this thing is clear, close to the intellect and ancillary of truth.",
                "From the laws of the commandment is that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Zevachim 43a) that the liability of excision is only for one that eats that part of the sacrifice which is for the person or the altar. But one is not liable for excision on account of <i>piggul</i> from the part of it that permits the sacrifice. How is this? One is not liable for excision on account of <i>piggul</i> when one eats a <i>kazayit</i> of the blood from a sacrifice that is made <i>piggul</i> - as behold, the blood is the part of the sacrifice that permits; since after the sprinkling of the blood, it is permitted to offer the entrails, but not before then. And nonetheless, we administer lashes for it – even if there is no excision with it. But one who eats a <i>kazayit</i> of meat from the sacrifice – or even from the entrails – is liable for excision on account of <i>piggul</i>. As it is the blood that permits the entrails [to be put] on the altar. And after the first thing that permits, we follow this law, to make liable one who eats from any of the rest – and therefore, one who eats even from the entrails is liable. And even though they also permit the meat for a person, it makes no difference; as we follow the blood, which is the first thing that permits, as we have said.",
                "And so [too,] one who eats a <i>kazayit</i> from the remainder of a flour-offering that became <i>piggul</i> is liable on account of <i>piggul</i>. But one who eats a <i>kazayit</i> of its handful or from the frankincense – which are the things that permit it – is not liable excision for it. And nonetheless, he is lashed for them, as we have said. And these are the things for which one is never liable for <i>piggul</i>: the handful; frankincense; blood, as we have said; wine; and flour offerings that are completely burned, as behold they do not have a handful that permits them. And one is not liable on account of <i>piggul</i> for anything that does not have something that permits it, beside it. And one is also not liable for it with a <i>log</i> of oil of the <i>metsora</i>. And if you say, \"But does not the blood of the guilt-offering permit it\" – the answer is that it is not dependent upon it. As behold, a man brings his guilt-offering today and the <i>log</i> after several days. ",
                "And so [too,] from the matter of the commandment is that which they also said that one who sacrifices who has a disqualifying thought transgresses a negative commandment; as it is stated (Leviticus 7:18), \"it shall not be counted (<i>yichashev</i>) for him (which can also be read as, 'he shall not think about it').\" And we learned from the tradition (Zevachim 29b) that included in this warning (negative commandment) is about one who sacrifices, that he not have a disqualifying thought. But nonetheless, it is not considered to be from the tally of the three hundred and sixty-five negative commandments, since it is similar to one of the extensions of another negative commandment, which is calculated in the tally – and that is that which is written in the Order of Emor el HaKohanim, \"There shall be no blemish in it\" (Leviticus 22:21) – and they, may their memory be blessed, expounded (Berakhot 33b), on account of the negative commandment of one who places a blemish in [sacrifices]; as we shall write with God’s help (Sefer Ha Chinukh 287). And also the content of one who has a disqualifying thought is considered similar to one who places a blemish. And hence they did not consider it in the tally. And in any event, he is not lashed for it, since there is no act [involved] with it, but rather only thought. And the rest of the laws of thoughts: which thought disqualifies, for example the thought of changing a name, the thought of a place and the thought of a time; and in which sacrifice; and which process, for example slaughter, sprinkling, reception, taking; and all of the details of the laws of <i>piggul</i> - and also of <i>notar</i>, which is similar to it - are elucidated in many places in the Order of Kedoshim.

And one who transgresses it and eats a <i>kazayit</i> from it volitionally is liable for excision; inadvertently, he brings a fixed sin-offering. And I have already explained twice (Sefer HaChinukh 108, 121) that a sacrifice that does not vary up and down according to poverty and wealth is called fixed."

And in the second chapter of Pesachim 24b, they said [that] impurity of the body is with excision; impurity of the meat is with a negative commandment. ",

And even one who eats a <i>kazayit</i> of frankincense from the meal-offering which became impure after it was sanctified in a vessel is lashed; as it too is a part of the sacrifice. And the liability only comes with becoming impure [from] a primary source of impurity or its derivative by Torah writ.

But the majority of the commentators disagree with this and say that its <i>chelev</i> is permissible. And the words of the Gemara (Chullin 92b) decide like them.

And that which they said (Chullin 75b) that if it hovered over the ground it requires slaughter; it is only because of appearances that we need to slaughter it. And therefore we do not disqualify it with pausing, pressing and the other types of [causing it to be] 'torn.' And there are three forbidden fats in a beast that have a liability of excision: that on the innards; that on the kidneys; and that on the flanks. And the understanding of the three of them is [found] with great elucidation in its place in the Gemara (Chullin 93a).

And about it, they, may their memory be blessed, said in the Gemara (Chullin 93a), \"The head of the intestines requires an ell of scraping\" (Rashi: Where the small [tissues] exit from the maw, there is a need to scrape the <i>chelev</i> from on top of them the length of an ell).

And such is the opinion of our teachers, the Masters of the Tosafot on Chullin 64b, s.v. <i>vehu</i>, and as is implied from the simple meaning of the bereita in Keritot 21a. This is the law of the Torah. But the Sages forbade an egg that has [been] formed, and supported the thing with the verse of \"the swarming creature that swarms\" (Leviticus 11:42). And hence they forbade the blood of eggs on account of the doubt - that [perhaps] it formed. But anything that does not have a doubt of formation, they only forbade on account of appearances. And so, [regarding] blood of eggs found in the white, one should throw out the blood and eat the rest. But there are those that are stringent when it is found on the union and outside of the union [of the egg], to forbid the whole egg.",

Lifeblood is with excision - as in the place that excision for blood comes in the Torah, there it is stated life (literally, spirit), as it is stated (Leviticus 17:11), \"For the life of the flesh is in the blood.\" But the prohibition of that which is not lifeblood, but rather the blood of the limbs is only with a negative commandment - since about it is it stated (Leviticus 7:26), \"And any blood you shall not eat.\" And therefore they, may their memory be blessed, elucidated and said (Keritot 22a) that we are liable for excision with the blood that comes out at the time of slaughter, stabbing or decapitation, so long as it has redness in it; with blood stored in the heart; and blood that is let, so long as it flows and comes out - as it too is lifeblood, and therefore we are liable for it. And specifically flowing - to exclude the dripping at the beginning of the letting and at its end, which is not lifeblood, such that we are not liable excision [for it]. And so [too,] the concentrated blood - meaning to say the blood that oozes a little at a time at the time of slaughter, after the pouring blood came out; and so [too,] the blood of the limbs, such as the blood of the spleen, the blood of the kidneys, the blood in the testicles and the blood that lodges in the heart at the time of slaughter - we are not liable excision for it, but rather lashes.

As this blood is considered like meat for us, so long as it has not separated from the meat. And therefore, they, may their memory be blessed, allowed [us] to eat raw meat without salting it; so long as it was properly rinsed, that there should not be actual blood on its surface. But at the time when the blood absorbed in the meat separates and goes out, we are liable for it with a negative commandment - as with the blood of the limbs that we enumerated above, which are with a negative commandment.

                "And therefore, the Sages obligated one who wants to eat meat cooked in a pot to extract the blood from it [that it not] (that it) separate from it and go out into the broth in the cooking. And the only scheme they found to take it out was salt, as it draws the blood and dries it naturally. And its power is great and goes into the meat - and even with a very thick piece, it has the power to extract the blood from [its] thickness. And so is this thing well-known and tried - that if a man salts a piece of meat properly according to the measure that the Sages gave for salting, he will find the taste of the salt in all of the meat, even in a big piece of a fattened ox. And since the thing is clearly so and recognizable to the eye, it is permissible to put all meat that has been salted according to its measure in a pot - whether the water is boiling, lukewarm or cold. [This is so] since we see the meat after salting according to its measure, as if - for all purposes - all forbidden blood was drained from it. And even if after the salting, we see a little blood that comes out from it; it does not have the status of blood, but rather it is considered as red brine. And about that which is similar to it, it is said in the Gemara (Chullin 112b), \"Rabbi x called this, 'the wine of meat' and permitted it.\"",
                "And there are a few limbs in the beast [with] much blood, which all of Israel is accustomed to extract the blood in them with the power of fire before they cook them in the pot, and they did not want to rely on salting alone for them - and these are the brain and the liver. They roast them a little on the fire and afterwards cook them - whether they wanted to cook them on  their own or with other meat. And the custom of Israel is Torah. If he transgressed and cooked them with other meat after salting alone, it is all permissible - and [that is] so long as he did not plan to do so at the outset, so that the matter return to [be permitted] for him ex post facto after the cooking. As with regards to anyone who does this with prohibitions, we forbid it all for him, as if it were at the outset. And I read upon him, 'one who breaches a fence will be bitten by a snake.'",
                "And the order of salting is like this: He rinses the meat properly from the blood on it, and afterwards places medium salt upon it - not very thick, so that a little will cling, and not very fine (so that it not cling more than necessary - Venice edition). And he leaves it in its salt enough to walk a <i>mil</i>; and it is enough with that even for a thick ox. And after it sits in its salt this measure [of time] on a diagonal place upon which the blood can properly flow or  on a vessel with holes, he takes the meat in his hands and raises it and shakes off the salt from upon it, and then rinses it properly with water in the vessel three or more times, until the salt is removed and the water that he rinses the meat with is clear. And if the meat stays in its salting more than the fitting measure for salting, we do not concern ourselves lest the meat went back and absorbed from the blood on the surface of the salt; as we say that after the meat expunged its forbidden blood, it expunges its brine - meaning to say the meat's liquid, and that is the moisture in the meat. And so long as the meat expunges this brine, it is not its nature to be be able to absorb blood, since blood is very smooth by nature and is only absorbed slowly - meaning to say, [only] all of the time that the meat is not expunging anything, not blood and not brine.

If it stays more than this in its salt, it is forbidden to eat it until he peels the entire surface of the meat. And nonetheless it is sufficient with peeling, since we hold that salting is like the heating of a roast; and with a prohibited [food] that touches a roast, we hold [it is enough with] peeling, when there is not a prohibition that gushes - and blood does not gush. And if he did not want to peel the meat, it is permitted to eat it with roasting. As even though we say that salt does not have the power to extract the blood that comes to the meat from another place, the power of fire to extract it is stronger than salt. And therefore it is permitted to eat meat that sat in salt longer than is necessary, roasted without peeling; and with peeling, even in a pot, as we said.",

These two general rules that we have generalized - one to forbid and one to permit all birds that have them - no man need ask an expert in birds about them. Rather he may forbid the forbidden and allow the permitted immediately, as there is no hesitation about this.",

And these are them: it is not a predator; an extra digit; a crop; and a gizzard that peels. And we have already generalized that any bird that is found to be lacking one of them, and that is the unique one among them - which is that it is not a predator, meaning that it is a predator - is always impure and one need not check any other sign. And it is not necessary to say if it is lacking all of them - that it does not have even one of these signs of purity - that it is forbidden. As behold, even the one - the unique one - forbids by itself, as we said; all the more so if all of them are lacking. And the eagle is also one that does not have any of the signs of purity. If a bird is found that is lacking two - meaning to say that it only has two signs of purity and is lacking the two others, and one of the two [signs] of purity found in it is that it is not a predator - any bird that is like this is pure to eat for anyone who recognizes the raven and any species of raven. As there is none among the impure like this except for the raven, since it does not trample but it has one sign in its body of the signs of purity. And that sign of purity is not fixed in each species of raven. Rather there is a type that has an extra digit and is not a predator; one that has a crop and is not a predator; and one that has a gizzard that peels and  is not a predator. The general rule of the matter is that these two signs of purity are found in its species and not another species - so did some of the commentators explain. And there are some that said that the raven has two signs of purity in its body besides that it is not a predator. ",

And they are not found in settlements - and since they are not found in settlements, we are not in doubt about them. And there are some of the commentators that said that they were not found with our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, but they are found now. And I [say] about them, 'do not be greatly righteous.' As [the Rabbis] said that they are not found in settlements - meaning to say, that they are always distant from inhabited places - and since their nature is like this, 'the world stands forever,' and the law is the same at all times. If three signs of purity are found in its body - and they are an extra digit, a crop and a gizzard that peels - it is known that it is fit, and [that also] the fourth is [in it] (like this); meaning to say that it is not a predator. As there is no bird in the world with these three signs that is a predator. And [so] he does not need to check about it at all, but rather he may eat it immediately. But if three signs of purity are found in it and one of the three is that it is not a predator, one must certainly be in doubt about it; as most of the impure ones are like this, that they have three signs like these. And every man must ask about such a bird if he does not recognize all of (the impure) the enumerated ones in the Torah. It comes out, according to our words, that any bird that is in doubt for us whether it is impure or pure will be in one of two ways:  that it have three signs of purity, and one of them is that it is not a predator, as we said, that it should be in doubt [of being] among the many species of the impure; or that it have two signs of impurity and one of them is that it is not a predator, that it should be in doubt of being a raven and its species. But all of the other ways do not bring a doubt, but rather we judge it as pure or impure immediately. Place your mind to the thing, as it is so, according to this general rule of ours. And we have written this general rule according to some of the commentators, as there are many explanations given in these matters of birds. And our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Chullin 64b) that all birds that are in doubt are eaten according to tradition - meaning to say that if the people of a place received [a tradition] and were accustomed to eat it [with no question] under the assumption that it is pure - that we should have no hesitation about it at all, and there is no need to check it.

And it is that that which we count each and every type of the impurities as a positive commandment, its substance is not that we would be obligated to become impure with this impurity, and likewise not that we are prevented from becoming impure from it and that is should be a negative commandment. However since the Torah states that one who approaches this species is impure or that this thing becomes impure in this way by the one who approaches it, that is a positive commandment - meaning to say that this law that we are commanded about is a commandment. And that [commandment] is that which we said, that the one who approaches such in this way becomes impure, and the one in that way does not become impure. And as to one becoming impure, himself, the option is in the hand of each man: As if he wants, he becomes impure; and if he wants, he does not become impure. And the language of Sifra, Shemini, Chapter 4:10 is '\"And their carcass you shall not touch\" - it is possible that if one touched a carcass he receives forty stripes; [hence] we learn to say \"and to these you shall become impure\" (Leviticus 11:24). It is possible that if one saw a carcass, he should go and become impure from it; [hence] we learn to say \"their carcass you shall not touch.\" How is this? I would say [it is an] option.' And the commandment is that which is said to us about these laws - that the one who approaches this becomes impure and will be impure; and he will be obligated that which the impure are obligated - to go out of the encampment of the Divine Presence and not to eat from the holy, and not come close to it and other than this. And that is the commandment, meaning to say his being impure with this species, when he approaches it or be with it in this manner. And remember this matter with each and every type of impurity.\" To here is his language. And with all of this, it does not sit well with the heart for us to think of this matter as a commandment. And nonetheless we shall not veer from the path of our rabbi in our tally to the right or the left, as we set out at the beginning.",

And it is one whether it is a permitted beast or animal or a forbidden one that died - the flesh of all of them transfer impurity with a <i>kazayit</i>. And the slaughter of a pure beast or animal purifies them and they do not transfer impurity afterwards. And even the slaughter of non-sacred [animals] in the courtyard or consecrated ones outside purifies them from being a carcass. And anything that dies on its own or a disqualification occurred in its slaughter, behold it is a carcass - and like they, may their memory be blessed, said in Chullin 32a, \"This is the general principle: All that became disqualified in its slaughter is a carcass; and all that something else caused it to become disqualified, is 'torn' (<i>tereifah</i>).\" But slaughter does not purify an impure beast or animal from being a carcass. And hence they are carcasses in any way that they die. And nonetheless, they do not transfer impurity - not them and not the pure ones - until they die completely, and not while they are still twitching.

And there are some of them that said that it is said even when it is raw.

And this negative commandment is specific to them, [and] besides the negative commandment that is specific to the impure fish; as these are not included as fish at all, since they are a completely different species of its own. That is the opinion of Rambam, may his memory be blessed, (Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Lo Taase 179), about this verse, that it comes to teach about this. But Ramban, may this memory be blessed, (on Sefer HaMitzvot, Root 9, s.v. <i>veraiti lerav z\"l</i>) disagrees with him on this and wrote, that this negative commandment is not a specific negative commandment about any swarming creature; but rather that it is from the general negative commandments for which we do not administer lashes, like \"You shall not eat any abomination\" in Deuteronomy 14:3 at the beginning of the sections of the prohibited animals. And so [too,] here at the end of all of them, it stated, \"You shall not abominate your souls\" with all of the walkers of the ground that I have prohibited.

And he, himself, wrote that he did not see the commentary of any man before him who explains it like him. And the general rule of his commentary about the thing is that which he always reviews; that that which they said that a man is lashed for the eating of one creature [for] many negative commandments is such that that creature has the addition of an aspect, such that that [additional] negative commandment is designated for that addition; and not that he ever be lashed two [sets of] lashes for one prohibition alone - and even if there are a thousand negative commandments stated in the Torah about it, as we said. And therefore he said that the creature for which the Sages, may their memory be blessed, made liable several [sets] of lashes is such a one as brings together in its body several species. For example, [it is] such that you would say that its character is such that it is possible to call it a swarming creature of the ground and a flying swarming creature - for example that it has wings - and a swarming creature of the waters, that it also swims in the water even as it flies in the air. [This is] as we sometimes see in a few species of swarming creatures. And in this way with some strain that he strains in his explanation, he explains this teaching in the Gemara of Makkot: \"If he ate a <i>putita</i>, he is lashed four [sets], an ant five, etc.\" And he exerts himself to find six separate matters in the body of one creature.",

And he [presented] many proofs about this - proofs that appear 'strong as a mirror of cast metal.' And he explained the teaching of the Gemara Makkot nicely like the understanding of the early scholars. And Ramban, may his memory be blessed, expounds the negative commandment of the swarming creatures of the water from that which is written in the section of the prohibition of fish, \"And anything that does not have fins and scales, etc. from any swarming creature of the waters, etc.  it shall be an abomination for you\" (Leviticus 11:10).

And also the offspring that is born [from a union] while that excess overpowers her is destined for bad illnesses. And from this root that we said from the angle of excess, the Torah commanded that she be impure from the male seven [days] and two weeks from the female. As there is no doubt that the excesses of the woman that gives birth to a female are greater than one who gives birth to a male - since conception of a male indicates heat in the female. And [it is] like they, may their memory be blessed, said (Berakhot 60a), \"'If a woman conceives (literally, gives seed) and gives birth to a male - [if] a woman gives seed first, she gives birth to a male.\" And it is well-known that the excesses of heat are few and its action is always quick - it is a logical thing. And therefore seven days of cleansing suffices with the pregnancy of a male.",
                "And the conception of a female indicates coldness in the constitution of the female. And in coldness, excesses abound; and hence she needs two weeks for the cleansing of her body. And so did I find the matter after I wrote this [in] Ramban, may his memory be blessed, and these are his words (Ramban on Leviticus 12:4): \"Because the constitution of the female is cold and wet, and the dampness in the womb of the mother is very great and cold. And therefore, she gave birth to a female. And hence she requires a big cleansing because of the multitude of dampness and the blood decaying  in her and because of her coldness. And it is well-known that the cold sicknesses require a longer time to be cleansed than the hot ones.\" To here [are his words].",
                "And similar to this is also the matter of the menstruant and the <i>zavah</i>. As the menstruant is purified after seven days - and even if she gushes all of the seven, so long as she stops on the seventh while it is still day - by the law of the Torah. But the the <i>zavah</i> requires seven clean [days after her bleeding], because the flow indicates the extent of the excesses of the woman - and that is the continuation of the emptying of blood many days after the days that are customary in most women. And it is possible for us to say that the sickness of discharging blood in women from month to month was so that their weak minds not become haughty. Or [it is] so as to distance their closeness from man a little, so that he not run after them all of the days. As the thing of this messiness that he knows about them will be a little disgusting in his eyes and he will not always err in his love of them.",
                "And our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said in Niddah 31b from the angle of the simple understanding - I mean to say that they intended to reveal one of the great benefits that there is in the commandment besides its great and strong principles - and they wrote that there is a benefit in the distancing of the wife a little time so as to make her more beloved to her husband at the fit time, and that they should not get sick one of the other from the great constancy of their closeness and they give their eyes to other bodies - like most of the other nations, who are not restrained by our strict fences, do. And likewise this reason of theirs suffices from the angle of the simple understanding with the woman who has given birth; such that he not disgrace himself with her immediately, and lest she be disgusting in his eyes and he be sick of her, like we said in Niddah 31b.",
                "From the laws of the commandment is, for example,  that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Niddah 66a) that all women who give birth are impure - and even if they did not see blood, as it is impossible to have an opening of the womb without blood. And it is one whether the woman gives birth to a live [baby] or to a dead one, and even if she miscarried - and that is when its form is completed - she is impure with the impurity of birth. And even if she miscarried a placenta or an amnion full of water or blood, behold this one [must be] concerned about a birth; as it established for us that there is no placenta without a fetus. And even though they do not find the fetus in the placenta now, we are concerned lest it dissolved inside it. And from the doubt, she sits [out] the days of impurity for a female which is two weeks, and the days of purification for a male which are thirty-three days and not more - as from a doubt, we are stringent [to this side] and [that side]. And this that we say that she must be concerned about a birth is specifically when forty days have passed over her since she conceived. But if forty days have not passed over her, she does not concern herself about a birth - and even on the actual fortieth day, as the fortieth day is considered like before the [end of] forty days. And nonetheless even though she does not concern herself about a birth - meaning to say, and she will not have the days of purification like a woman who has given birth - she concerns herself, nonetheless, about the impurity of a menstruant. And even if the 'birth' was a dry birth - meaning to say that she did not see blood at all - we say that since she gave birth, it is impossible to have an opening of the womb without blood, and lest it was little and it got lost. And any woman that has days of birth for impurity has days of purification from Torah writ. And the days of purification are thirty-three for a male and sixty-six for a female. And the matter is like this [regarding] the law of the Torah: That after she gave birth, the woman counts seven days from the day she gave birth. And whether she gave birth at the beginning of the night or at midday or even near sunset, she counts that day of birth as one day and completes six [more] days upon it. And whether she [experiences blood] a few of the days of the seven or all of the seven, she immerses on the evening of the seventh, which is the eighth night, and she is pure for her husband. And even if she is gushing blood on that eighth night, she immerses and is pure for her husband; as the Torah permitted all blood that a woman has given birth will see after the seven days within the thirty-three days for a male, and after fourteen within sixty-six day for a female.",
                "And about this they, may their memory be blessed, said (Niddah 35b) that there is one 'wellspring' and the Torah made it impure, and the Torah [also] made it pure. [This is] meaning to say that the blood of birth that the Torah made impure and the blood of purification that the Torah made pure are from one place; and that is [that] both of them come out from the source (the uterus), which is a place of impurity. However the Torah made the matter depend on time and made impure the blood that comes from her at one time and made [it] pure at a second time. And blessed is the One that knows all wisdom, as He did every thing for a correct and necessary reason. And He, blessed be He, knows that up to a certain time, the blood is damaging; and [that] from then on, it is not damaging.",
                "But now all of Israel has girded itself and has become accustomed to treat the blood of purification like the blood of impurity. And the general principle of the matter is that a woman today does not ever emerge from her impurity until she undergoes seven full days clean from all blood. And she begins counting them from the evening. And this is a great principle and it is practiced until this day in all the places of the proper Israelites. And through this, we are saved from several doubts. And the laws of the doubts that sometimes arise upon the woman giving birth - for example, if she is obligated to sit [out] for the impurity of a male or the impurity of a female, as sometimes she must sit [out] for a male and a female and for [being] a menstruant from the doubt; the law of what is the law of one who has a miscarriage of a type of beast or bird; what is the law if their faces are like the faces of people or if their faces are not like the faces of people; what is the law of one who has a miscarriage of types of gnats [or] types of hairs; one who has a miscarriage of the image of a man that has wings of flesh; likewise one who has a miscarriage of the image of a man with one eye and one thigh; one who has a miscarriage of a male together with a <i>sandal</i>, and that is a creature that it not recognizable whether it is male or female; the law of a woman that goes out full and comes back empty and errs in her calculation - and the rest of its many details regarding her impurity are all in Tractate Niddah (see Tur, Yoreh Deah 191).

And this opinion is very removed from the intellect. And there are evil groups that think that His providence, blessed be He, is not put upon any matters of this lowly world at all - whether upon people or other animals. And this is the opinion of the heretics - it is evil and bitter.

And the language of Sifra,  Tazria, Parashat Nega'im, Chapter 12:9 is \"One who is impure from a dead body, one who has intercourse with a menstruant and all who render a person impure - from where [do I know they are included? Hence] we learn to say, '\"impure, impure,\" he shall call out' (Leviticus 13:45).\" And the calling is that he should do a matter in his body that people will recognize about him that he is impure and veer away from him.",
                "It is from the root of the commandment that he take his distancing from people as an example for his soul. As a person is distanced from all good as a result of sin, in order that he will repent from his evil way. And this is [the meaning] of their, may their memory be blessed saying (Arakhin 16b), \"With evil speech, he separated a man from his wife and a man from his fellow. And therefore his tent is outside of the camp.\" And therefore it is fitting that he should call to every man that they veer away from him. And the general principle in all things is \"With the measure that a man measures, [so] will he be measured\" (Sotah 8b).  And many do not know the understanding of this thing. As they think to explain this thing with God, may He be blessed, modeled on the recompense of men - that each one will recompense his fellow according to the good that he did by him, or according to the bad [that he did]. But the matter is not like this with God, blessed be He, - God forbid. As there is always only kindness and mercy with God, blessed be He; and His goodness is ready at every instant and every hour for all who are fitting to receive it. And 'the Guardian of Israel does not slumber and does not sleep.' [Rather] the intention of that which they, may their memory be blessed said about Him, blessed be He, \"With the measure that a man measures, [so] will he be measured,\" is to say that according to the action of a man - whether for the good or the opposite - will he be set to receive recompense. As always in the same manner that a person sets his thoughts and does his actions - in that exact mold - will blessing or its opposite be drawn to him.",
                "And so does the verse state, \"For He does not oppress from His heart, nor bring grief to man\" (Lamentations 3:33). And it is also written, \"For You are not a God who desires wickedness, etc.\" (Psalms 5:5) - meaning to say that God, may He be blessed, does not obligate liability to any creature from His desire for the liability, as the good God always desires good. Rather, it is a man who makes himself liable in his moving  from righteousness; and [so] removes from himself the preparations that allow him to receive the good. And the parable for this is the one who walks on a straight path that is free of stones and from anything that makes one stumble, but there is a hedge of thorns from this [side] and from that [side]. And one went and rubbed the hedge and was hurt - truthfully, one cannot say about this man that God desired his hurt. [Rather,] he was the cause, since he was not careful to walk straight. And so too, with one who sins, it is the attribute of justice that makes him liable for his sin regardless. And one cannot say that the good God desired his liability. [Rather,] in his preventing himself from the good, from the angle of his sin, did evil become [drawn] found to him. And similar to this thing did they, may their memory be blessed, say - \"No evil thing descends from Above\" (Bereshit Rabbah 51:3).",

And then He commands His angels to guard him, as at first. And [it is] as it is written (Deuteronomy 31:17), \"And I will hide My face from them and they will be for food, and many evils and troubles will find them; and they will say on that day, 'It is because our God is not among us, they found us, etc.'\" And one sage wrote, \"We know that God is one and the change [only] comes from the recievers.

And the explanation of becoming wild is the growing of hair; and of rending is that he tears his clothes. And the one who is pure [after] the quarantine is exempt from shaving and birds, but the one who is pure [after being] definitive is obligated about shaving and birds. But the impurity of both of them is the same in everything.

And three types of purifications are mentioned in the Torah, and these are them: Water, and this type, by water, includes the purification of every impurity - meaning to say it is impossible for any impure thing to emerge from impurity without water; and the second type is sprinkling water, and that is the type that is specific for the impurity of a dead body; and the third type, the cedar wood, hyssop, wool dyed red, two birds and living water, and it is the type that is specific for  <i>tsaraat</i>. The Sages informed us of a bit of a hint in the matters of the purification of the <i>metsora</i> with these things. As they, may their memory be blessed, said (Pesikta D'Rav Kahanna 14) that the matter is to fix in the soul of the <i>metsora</i> that if, before the illness came to him, he was haughty-hearted like the cedar - by way of metaphor, since it is a tall tree - he should lower himself like the hyssop. It is said about the reason of the birds (Arakhin 16b) [that] he did an act of chattering - meaning to say, he spoke many words of evil speech - therefore, he must sacrifice birds that constantly chirp. And with the wool dyed red (<i>shani tolaat</i>), I do not know or remember anything that they, may their memory be blessed, said about it. And it is possible that it is also a hint that he should lower himself; and it would be a hint from its name [as it is called,] worm (<i>tolaat</i>). ",
                "And about the reason that water purifies everything impure, I would think on the side of the simple understanding that it is in order that a man see himself with the immersion as if he is created at that time, [just] like the whole world was water before man was upon it - as it is written (Genesis 1:2), \"and the spirit of God floated upon the face of the waters.\" And through this comparison, he place upon his heart that [just] like he is renewed in his body, he also renew his actions for the good, fix his actions and be exacting in the way of God, blessed be He. And therefore the Sages said that the purification is not fit with water that is in a vessel, but rather only with living water - or collected [water], which is on the ground and, in any case, not in a vessel - in order to place in his heart the thought as if the world was entirely water, and [that] he is renewed with his emerging from them, as we said. But if the water was in a vessel - or even if it passed through a vessel - this matter that we said would not be set in the thought of the one immersing. As there is a limit to all that is in a vessel, which is the creation of the hands of man. And therefore when he immerses in a vessel, he will not think as if the whole world is water like at the beginning [of Creation], and that he is renewed at that time. 'And the one who accepts, will accept; and the one who refrains will refrain.' ",
                "From the laws of the commandment is that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Mishnah Negaim 14:1), \"How does one purify the <i>metsora</i>? He would bring a new earthenware pitcher and place within it a <i>reviit</i> of living water,\" with which it would be fitting to consecrate the sprinkling water - and that measure is [rabbinic] (Sotah 16b) - \"and he would bring two wild birds\" that are pure, for the sake of the purification of the <i>metsora</i>; as it is stated (Leviticus 14:4), \"and it shall be taken for the one being purified.\" He slaughters the clarified (meaning, choice) of the two of them upon the water in the earthenware vessel and squeezes until the blood is recognizable in the water. And he digs and buries the slaughtered bird before him - and this is a tradition from what was heard. He takes cedar wood - and its commandment is that it be an ell long and its width be like a quarter of a foot of the feet of a bed; and not less than a handbreadth of hyssop that does not have an adjunct name; wool dyed red, the weight of which is a <i>shekel</i>, and if he mixed [its color], he disqualified it, like the dying of the aquamarine, which is disqualified by mixing. And all the measures are a law [from Moshe at Sinai] (Eruvin 4a). And he takes the living bird with the three of them; and the four species impede one another (Menachot 27a); and cedar wood or hyssop that have been peeled are disqualified. He ties the hyssop to the cedar wood with a strip of crimson fabric and surrounds them with the tips of the wings and the tip of the tail of the living bird. And he dips the four of them in water that is in the vessel and in the blood that is [in] it; \"and sprinkles seven times on the back of the hand of the <i>metsora</i>.\" And he sends away the bird. And how does he send it away? If he is standing in the city, he throws it out of the wall (Kiddushin 57b). \"He does not face the sea nor the city, but the desert, as it is stated (Leviticus 14:53), 'to outside the city toward the field'\"(Mishnah Negaim 14:2). [If] he sent it and it comes back, he again sends it away - even a hundred times. ",

He passes the razor over his visible flesh - and even [on] the underarm and the pubic area and all the rest of the body - until he becomes [smooth] like a gourd, as it is stated (Leviticus 14:9), \"all of his hair.\" If so, why does it state, \"his head, his beard, and his eyebrows?\" To include everything that is like them and to exclude hair that is in the nose, since it is not seen. And afterwards he washes his clothes and immerses, and is purified with this from passing on impurity from his resting and sitting [upon something]; and he can come inside the [city] wall. And he counts seven days; and during those seven days, he is prohibited in sexual relations, as it is stated, \"outside of his tent\" - teaching he is forbidden in sexual relations. But a <i>metsora'at</i> is permitted in sexual relations. All of these seven days, he is still a source of impurity and renders a person and vessels impure with touch, but he does render impure with carrying - as behold it states (Leviticus 14:9), \"And it shall be on the seventh day, etc. and he shall wash his clothes\" - teaching that he was rendering clothes impure. And [just] like he was rendering clothes impure, so [too] was he rendering a man impure with touch - since all that renders a person impure, renders clothes impure; and all that does not render a person impure, does not render clothes impure (Mishnah Kelim 1:1). And on the seventh day, the priest shaves him a second [time] like the first shaving. And [the <i>metsora</i>] washes his clothes and immerses and is purified from rendering others impure. And behold he is like all who have immersed during the day, and can eat from the tithe; when his sun sets, he can eat from the priestly tithe; [and] when he brings his atonement, he can eat from consecrated foods. The slaughter of the bird, the shaving and the sprinkling are during the day, but all the other procedures are whether during the day or during the night. These [three things] are with men, but all the rest are even with women. These are with priests, but all the rest are even through an Israelite.

And that is that there is no connection between the shaving and the bringing of sacrifices of the <i>metsora</i>; and the purpose that comes from his shaving is not the purpose that comes from his sacrifices. And that is [because] the purification of the <i>metsora</i> is dependent upon his shaving: And in the sixth chapter of Nazir 44b, they said, \"What is [the difference] between a nazarite and a <i>metsora</i>? Rather the purification of this one is dependent upon his day - meaning the nazirite - and the the purification of the <i>metsora</i> is dependent upon his shaving. And [so] when the <i>metsora</i> shaves and completes his second shaving, he is pure from giving off the impurity like a swarming creature, as is elucidated at the end of Mishnah Negaim 14:3. And [then] he remains lacking his atonement until he brings his sacrifices, like the rest of those that lack atonement, as is elucidated there.",

But the purpose of his bringing his sacrifices is the completion of his atonement, like the rest of those lacking in atonement - meaning to say, the <i>zav</i>, the <i>zavah</i> and the woman who has given birth. And the language of their statement has already preceded us, \"There are four who are lacking atonement\" (Keritot 8b). And there it is elucidated that the nazirite is not lacking atonement, but [rather] the procedure in its entirety - the shaving and the bringing of the sacrifice - [is what] permit him in drinking wine. And the one will not suffice without the other; and [so] the shaving is connected with the sacrifice and the sacrifice is connected with the shaving. And with their combination, the purpose comes at once - and that is that the things from which he was prevented during the days of his naziriteship will be permitted to him. And in the sixth chapter of Nazir 46b, they said \"If he shaved over the sacrifice, and the sacrifice was found disqualified, his shaving is disqualified, and his sacrifices did not count for him.\" Behold, it is elucidated that the shaving is from the conditions of the sacrifice, and [that] the sacrifice is from its conditions.",
                "And in Tosefta Nazir 2, it is likewise elucidated that the nazirite who completed his days is forbidden to shave, drink wine and to become impure to the dead, until he does the complete procedure. And that is the shaving of purification, as is elucidated in the sixth chapter of Nazir 45; and that is that he shaves at the opening of the Tent of Meeting, throw his hair under the cauldron and offer the sacrifices that come in the verse. And you will find (at the end of the commandments) [in most places], that they call the bringing of [these] sacrifices, \"shaving.\" And in the elucidation they said, in explaining the Mishnah (Nazir 11b) [that states that one who says,] \"Behold, I am a nazirite, and it is upon me to shave as a nazarite,\" [that] he means to say with this that he will bring the sacrifices of [another] nazarite and he will sacrifice them for him. Behold, it has been elucidated to you that the shaving [also means] the bringing of sacrifices. And the reason for this is their being a part of them, as we explained. And in their combination, the law of naziriteship is removed and the nazirite may drink wine. Moreover, the shaving of impurity (if a nazirite becomes impure) is  from the detail[s] - the understanding of which is, from the substance - of the commandment, and not a commandment on its own, as we explained in what preceded (Sefer Ha Mitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Ase 93).

And the Sages estimated this as forty <i>seah</i> (Eruvin 4b), and that is the measure of a <i>mikveh</i>. And from the Torah - whether the water is drawn, or it is pulled from the springs or from rain water - it is all fit. But the Sages disqualified any <i>mikveh</i>, the water of which is drawn. And not only that, but rather even if the water passed through a whole vessel at the time that it was flowing into the pit, they disqualified it.

[Rather,] the matter is that the Torah informed us that one who wants to become pure from his impurity will not have a possibility to do this without immersion in water.

But if one wants to stay in in his impurity and not to enter the encampment of the Divine Presence for a long time, the option is in his hand.\" An addition: But nonetheless it is not from the trait of piety and men of [good] action to be defiled in their impurity - as impurity is disgusting, and purity is beloved. And the soul of a person is elevated and purified with purity.

But if he immersed in his clothes, the immersion counted for him, ex post facto - since the water goes into them. And the menstruant is also [included] in  this law, ex post facto, and is permitted to her husband - and that is so long as the clothes are not extremely tight. And the immersion of all of those obligated to immerse is during the day, except for the menstruant and the woman that has given birth, such that their immersion is during the night.

But if he is not concerned, the immersion counts. But if the thing that separated was only on its lesser part, the immersion counts for him from Torah writ, even if he is concerned about it. But [rabbinically, with] anything - even the smallest amount - that separates that he is concerned about, his immersion does not count; [as a] decree of its lesser part, on account of its majority, which is forbidden from the Torah when he is concerned. And if the thing that separated covered most of him - even if he is not concerned - his immersion does not count; [as a] decree of the majority about which he is not concerned, on account of  the majority about which he is concerned, which is forbidden from Torah writ.

As from then, it no longer has the status of a vessel. And even if he filled the hole with a filling that is not proper, which still leaves holes or cracks when the liquid enters [it] - such as if he placed a stone of a fruit in it temporarily - I have heard from my teacher that this is not called drawn, and [so, it is] fitting to immerse in it.",

As it is only with drawn water that they decreed and said that three <i>log</i> disqualifies. But fruit juice does not [disqualify] until the appearance of the water changes from their mixing [in] (see Mishnah Mikvaot 7:5).",
                "And the law of separations are many. But the end of the things is the general principle that we require, [which] is this: From Torah writ (Bava Kamma 82a), any woman should have [only] needed to inspect all of our body proximate to her immersion - so that there not be anything separating on her body, and that would suffice for her. But Ezra and his court ordained that she scrub in hot water any place she has hair, and comb or loosen her hair with her hands - or a comb, if she has one - very well; such that if her hair was knotted, she would undo them. And the daughters of Israel were stringent upon themselves to cleanse all of their bodies with hot water. And anyone who differs from their custom should be stretched on the pole [to be whipped] (see Makkot 22b).",
                "And this scrubbing needs to be proximate to her immersion - meaning to say that she not be involved in anything in between. And nonetheless if  the immersion of a woman happened to be on Shabbat or a holiday, they permitted even from the outset that she scrub during the day and immerse at night. And likewise the Sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Niddah 67a) that on account of the concern that water should enter onto all parts of here body, a woman needs to stand at the time of the immersion in such a way that she appear like a weaver or one nursing her child standing under her breast. And she also needs to be careful about rings on her hand and bracelets - and if they are tight, she must take them off her hands at the time of immersion; and so [too,] to untie the bands on her hair, and to rinse her mouth and teeth. As even though water does not need to come into any of the hidden places, they need be fit for the water to come in. And there was a case (Niddah 66b) of a woman who immersed and a bone was found between her teeth, and the Sages required her another immersion. If she immersed and then something else separating was found upon her, such as dough or tar or dry blood and what is similar to them from all of the things that the Sages enumerated as separating - even it if is as small as a mustard seed, so long as she is concerned about it and her way is to remove it - her immersion did not count for her. And even if the thing was under the fingernail, and even if it was [impressed on] the flesh - since she is concerned - it is [considered to be] separating. And therefore the daughters of Israel have been accustomed to cut their nails at the time of immersion. And the rest of its many details of the laws of separations and the laws of <i>mikvaot</i> and one who has immersed on that day are elucidated in Tractate Mikvaot and and in Tractate Tevul Yom.",
                "And this commandment of immersion is practiced in every place and at all time by males and females. As it is a commandment upon them when they want to become pure from their impurity that they immerse in water, like the matter that we said about fitting waters, and that there not be something separating upon them and the rest of the matters that we wrote. But nonetheless the commandment is not that they purify themselves regardless if they want to stay in their impurity, unless they came to enter the Temple or to eat consecrated foods. And [the latter] is at the time of the Temple. As then - at that time - if one did like that, he [would have] violated this positive commandment, besides the liability that is upon him in his eating the holy in impurity and his entering the Temple, as we wrote above (Sefer HaChinukh 167).

As it is stated (Leviticus 14:10), \"And on the eighth day he shall take two unblemished male lambs and one female lamb.\" And it is written in the section that is after this (Leviticus 14:21), \"And if he is poor, etc.\" And this <i>metsora</i> is called, 'one lacking atonement,' until he sacrifices this sacrifice. And there are four lacking atonement (Keritot 8b): this one that we said; the <i>zav</i>; the <i>zavah</i>; and the woman who has given birth. And the substance of [their being] called lacking atonement is to say that each one of them - even though he is pure from his impurity, immersed and his sun set for him on the seventh day - is still lacking this atonement and he cannot eat the consecrated foods until he sacrifices them on the eighth day. And let it not be difficult upon you why we count the sacrifice of each one of these four as a [distinct] commandment, and do not group them all as one commandment - that we say that the four who are lacking atonement offer a sacrifice, and afterwards they will be atoned; as we say about the purification of the waters of the <i>mikveh</i>, that any impure one immerse, and afterwards he will be pure - and we do not distinguish among the types of impurity to count each one as a commandment. As the matter is because the sacrifices of these four are not the same, and it comes out that the thing that completes the purification of one of them does not complete the purification of the other. And therefore, they counted each one a [distinct] commandment. [But this] is not the case with the waters of the <i>mikveh</i>, as the purification is the same with all of them.

And that putrid, disgusting and impure excess develops in his body, from this. And it is like they, may their memory be blessed, said (Kiddushin 2b), \"It is the way of excessive drinking to lead to discharge.\" And the Torah informed us that a man who has this in him is called impure; and impurity is a general name for anything disgusting and vile. And in our distancing ourselves from this, we acquire the trait of righteousness and balance in all of our dispositions and in all of our abilities. And it is from this matter that he is not impure from one appearance. As that fluid has not [yet] become so strong in his body.

And since that is so, it is not fitting to render him impure with a small amount - as a person is built in a way that it is impossible for him to prevent himself from not leaving the straight line at all.

[And likewise brought into (this) warning is a common priest from entering the sanctuary all of the year except at the time of the service (according to the Venice edition)]. And the elucidation of the matter of the prevention is to say that any priest not enter into any place that is fitting, except at the time that is fitting to enter it - which is the time of service. And the language of Sifra, Achrei Mot, Section 1:8, 10 is \"'And let him not come at any time' - that is Yom Kippur; 'to the holy' - to include the other days of the year. 'Within the partition' - maybe for all of the sanctuary, [the punishment is] death. [Hence] we learn to say, 'before the ark cover which is on the ark, that he not die.' Behold, how is this? 'Before the ark cover' [is punishable] by death; (if he enters) the other parts of the sanctuary, (he is only in transgression of) a warning. And in the Gemara Menachot 27b, they, may their memory be blessed, said, about the chamber that it is with forty [lashes].",

As if he enters a fifth, he is liable for death by the hands of the Heavens. And a common priest may enter the chamber for the service every day. But anyone who enters the chamber not for the sake of the service - whether a high priest or a common priest, such as one who enters even to bow down - is lashed, but he is not liable for death. As it is stated 'Before the ark cover [...], that he not die' - for the Holy of Holies, he is liable for death; for the other parts of the sanctuary, (he is only in transgression of) a negative commandment. This is the opinion of Rambam, may his memory be blessed, about this negative commandment (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Admission into the Sanctuary 2:4). And I have already written the opinion of Ramban, may his memory be blessed, above (Sefer HaChinukh 149, 150), who said that entrance to the sanctuary, not for service, with wild [hair] and torn clothes is a rabbinic embellishment. And if so, according to his opinion, it is possible that anyone who entered to bow down is not [punished] with lashes at all; and this prohibition of \"he shall not come\" would only be in a completely empty coming - as such would be a disparagement to the honor of the [Temple], to enter into it for nothing.

And they forbade to stare even at their small finger.

And like this matter did the prophet rebuke the men of his generation, in his saying to them (Jeremiah 5:8), \"each one is neighing at his neighbor's wife\" - meaning to say, according to their way that they appear as if they do not intend this, they hint to the wives of their neighbors hints of adultery, and raise their voices in such a way that these women should listen to them and their impulse be aroused towards love of the adulterer.

But we now should not even breach a small fence in these matters at all, but rather guard all of the ditancinings that they, may their memory be blessed, informed us [about] in particular. And regarding that which they did not mention, each and every one should do according to that which he finds his person ready, as we said. As if he finds about himself that he needs a fence even about the permissible, he should fence himself - as we found (Kiddushin 81b) one of the Sages who said, \"Be careful with me because of my daughter,\" even though it is permitted for a man to isolate himself with his daughter, as we will write with God's will - since this matter is very difficult, and the evil impulse about it is strong.",
                "Therefore every man should increase his guarding. And if upon running into a beautiful woman, a man will think that <i>Gehinnom</i> is open between her eyelids and that any who approaches her will burn in a perpetual fire, and review his thoughts about these things, 'it will not be a cause of stumbling for him.' And they, may their memory be blessed, said (Berakhot 5a) that if [he] does not have the power in his hand to kill the impulse and to distance its thought from him, he should recite the reading of Shema or involve himself with Torah [study]. And they informed us that it will die with this in any event - as they, may their memory be blessed, said (Kiddushin 31a), \"If it is a stone it will dissolve, and if it is iron, it will explode, as it is stated (Jeremiah 23:29), 'Is My word not thus, like fire, etc.'\"",
                "And our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, also said (Kiddushin 80b) about this commandment that it is forbidden to isolate oneself with all of the Torah-level sexual prohibitions - whether old or young - as isolation brings to revealing nakedness. [This is the case] except for a mother with her son, a father with his daughter and a husband with his wife who is a menstruant - who are permitted, except for a groom whose wife has become menstruant before he has intercourse. And it is permissible to isolate oneself with a male and with a beast, as Israelites are not suspected about this. And when the story of Amnon and Tamar occurred, David and his court decreed [to forbid] isolation with a single woman (Avodah Zarah 36b). Shammai and Hillel decreed [to forbid] isolation with [gentiles]. And they, may their memory be blessed, permitted (Kiddushin 41a) to stare at a single woman by one who stares to know if he he will marry her as a wife if she is beautiful in his eyes. And they also said that it is fitting to do so, that a man not marry until he see her; so that he not come to divorce her afterwards, if she become unsightly in hie eyes. And the rest of the details of the commandment are elucidated in many scattered places in the Talmud (see Tur, Even HaEzer 21).",

And one who transgresses it and approaches a sexual prohibition with approaching of the flesh, in order that he derive pleasure from it, is lashed when warned and volitional. And if he transgressed on the remaining things that they, may their memory be blessed, forbade as a distancing - such as laughing and light-headedness - and they warned him but he did not prevent himself [from it], they would strike him with lashes of rebellion. And Ramban, may this memory be blessed, wrote (on Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Lo Taase 353) that we should not count this negative commandment of approaching in the tally of the negative commandments, as all distancing of approaching is rabbinic. And the proof is that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Talmud Yerushalmi Sanhedrin 7:7), \"Rabbi Yose beRebbi Bon said, 'It is \"do not approach,\" it is \"do not reveal\"'\" - meaning to say, that there is no negative commandment of approaching besides the negative commandment of revealing.

And Ramban, may his memory be blessed, said (Ramban on Leviticus 18:6) that this reason is very weak - that the Torah should make one liable for excision for one of these because of their being always found near him; and from another side, permit a man to marry one hundred women - or a thousand - if he wants. [Rather,] he, may his memory be blessed, said - and this is his language: \"But according to logic, there is a matter of a secret from the foundations of creation this is implanted in the soul, and it is included in the 'secret of intercalation' (a play on words that can also mean conception), that we have already hinted to.\" To here [are his words].

And they, may their memory be blessed, also learned with which death one who has intercourse with his daughter or with the daughter of his son or the daughter of his daughter is judged, from the strength of this inferential comparison. They, may their memory be blessed, learned it from it, after it was learned about it from another place. And from what other place was it learned about it? From that which is written (Leviticus 20:14), \"And a man that takes a woman and her mother, it is licentiousness; with fire shall they be burnt, him and them.\" And they, may their memory be blessed, said (Sanhedrin 75b) [that] just like there, with a woman and her mother, about them which is written, \"licentiousness,\" it is with burning; so too here, with a woman and her daughter or the daughter of her son or the daughter of her daughter, about them which is written, \"their flesh, it is licentiousness,\" he is judged with burning. And from now, since we found that the judgement of one who has intercourse with a woman and her daughter or the daughter of her son or the daughter of her daughter is with burning - since we have already learned the prohibition of his daughter from it by the inferential comparison of \"their, their\"; we can further learn from all of the other laws in it, and say that the judgement of one who has intercourse with his daughter is also with burning. And about that which is similar to this, they say in the Gemara (Yevamot 78b), \"Infer from it and from it\" - meaning to say, when we learn one verse from its fellow, we do not learn it for only one thing about it, but rather we learn it for all its laws from it. And [this is the case] even when those laws that are with it are not like the understanding of that verse itself, but rather learned from other verses. Nonetheless, we learn from everything that is in it - whether from the verse itself or whether it is learned from another place. And they, may their memory be blessed, said in the Gemara Keritot 5a, \"Let not an inferential comparison (<i>gezara shava</i>) be light in your eyes; as behold, his daughter from a woman he raped is one of the [important] bodies of Torah, and Scripture only taught it through a <i>gezara shava</i> - it comes by 'their, their'; 'licentiousness, licentiousness.'\" [This is] meaning to say that we learned its prohibition and its judgement from these two inferential comparisons, as we explained. But his daughter from a woman he married is explicit in Scripture, as it is stated (Leviticus 18:17), \"The nakedness of a woman and her daughter\" - and there is no distinction whether she is his daughter and her daughter, or from another man. And this is speaking about a married woman, since it is written, \"woman\" (<i>eeshah</i>, which is also the word for wife), which implies the language of marriage (<i>eeshut</i>). And it is also written \"you shall not take\" - and taking also implies through marriage. But regarding his daughter from a woman he raped or the daughter of her son or daughter of her daughter, only, \"you shall not reveal,\" is written. And Rambam, may his memory be blessed, wrote (in Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Lo Taase 336), \"Observe their, may their memory be blessed, saying 'The verse did not teach it,' and they did not say, 'We did not learn it' - since all of these matters are a transmission from the messenger (Moshe), peace be upon him, who transmitted the understanding [of the Torah] to the elders. And that is [the meaning] of their saying, 'body of Torah,' about this.\" And [this] brought the rabbi, may his memory be blessed, to write this as a fixed major principle for himself - that only what is explicit in the verse or that which they, may their memory be blessed, said explicitly that it is from the Torah, is in the tally of the six hundred and thirteen commandments, but not that which we learn from the thirteen hermeneutic principles.

And on account of this, they, may their memory be blessed, said (Yevamot 97a) that it is from the law of the Torah that if a man raped a woman, it would have been permitted to marry her daughter [from another man], except that the Sages, may their memory be blessed, made a fence and forbade the thing. And they said (Yevamot 97a) that one who has adultery with a woman is forbidden to marry one of her seven [delineated] relatives so long as the unfaithful woman is alive, because the unfaithful woman comes to visit them and [so] he will isolate himself with her; and [since] his heart is coarse with her, he will come to a sin, as he will have intercourse with the sexual prohibition.

However, if he [married] this one who is a relative of the one with which he was licentious, we do not require him to remove (divorce) her.

As there is a specific place in a woman, that only blood which comes from it is impure - it is called the source. And in the language of the Sages, it is called, \"the room.\" And in their days, [since] they were experts in every wisdom, all the women were accustomed to practicing the law of the Torah for menstruation and discharge; such that a <i>zavah</i> would sit [out] for seven clean days, and a menstruant would immerse on the night of the eighth - and even if she was gushing all of the seven - since the blood stopped on the seventh while [it was] still day.

[As] sometimes a woman will [experience] blood which is pure [according to] the Torah, but because she will not find a sage who would recognize it, she would be concerned about it [based on] the doubt and sit [out] for it. And if you have her practice the Torah law, behold she will count seven days from that day that she starts [experiencing] the blood, and on the night of the eighth - even if she was gushing all of the seven - if the blood stopped on the seventh, she will immerse in the evening, as we said above. And it will come out that sometimes we would come to a prohibition of excision because of her - as we should be concerned that all of the blood that she [experienced] on the [first] six days was pure blood, and [only that] of the seventh was impure blood. And [so] she began to count the seven days of menstruation from the first day that she [experienced] it, whereas she should have started to count from the seventh, as that is the beginning of her menstruation, since [only] it was impure blood. And from this mistake, she will come to err many times from menstruation to discharge and from discharge to menstruation - that she will figure that she is in the days of menstruation whereas she is [actually] in the days of discharge. Therefore Rebbe rose and ordained (Niddah 66a) that every woman that [experiences blood] one day, sit [out] six clean days, and likewise if she [experienced] two days, she also sits six clean ones. When she sits six clean days for them, there is no longer any room for doubt: As if both of those days were in the days of menstruation, she will be pure at the end of seven days. And if they are in the days of discharge, there was only a need to wait one day. And even if the first was in the days of discharge and the second was in the days of menstruation, there is no [problem] with this - as behold, she sits after this six clean days, and one of those six clean days counts for that day of discharge. And even though all of them were in the days of menstruation, the law is that days of menstruation in which she does not [experience blood] count for the days of discharge.

And after that ordinance, the Daughters of Israel added [to it] further and were stringent upon themselves (Niddah 66a), such that even if they [experienced] a drop of blood like a mustard seed - meaning to say even with one appearance - they would sit [out] seven clean days, as they did not want to differentiate between [experiencing] blood one or two days, and [experiencing it] three days. And the matter of the stringency about which they were stringent is not on account of the blood being little as a mustard seed, as from the law of the Torah, there is no distinction between a little blood and much blood - as she always needs to sit seven consecutive days [regardless], as we said. [Rather,] the stringency is that they made themselves to be like a <i>zavah</i> even with one appearance. And this stringency that they took upon themselves is mentioned in many place in the Talmud; and it appears from this that the Sages saw their stringency as good and needed, and they conceded to the words of [the Daughters of Israel].",
                "And it comes out that all women today are like a big <i>zavah</i> and need to count seven clean days, even with one appearance; and likewise any woman that found a [blood] stain in a place that it is fitting to be concerned about it. Even though stains are rabbinic (Niddah 58b) - as from Torah writ, a woman does not become impure until she feels impure blood herself, as it is stated (Leviticus 15:19), \"blood flowing in her flesh,\" meaning that that she feels the impure blood in herself - nonetheless, the Sages were already stringent about stains and required the counting of seven [clean days] and a break of purity (<i>hefsek tahara</i>) for them. And therefore if she found a stain of the size that forbids in a place that it is fitting to be concerned about it, she also needs to sit seven clean days for it. And from when does a woman count her seven clean days? From the morrow of the day that the blood stopped completely. How is this? If she [experienced blood] for two or three days, she checks herself constantly. If the blood stopped on the second day or on the third day - even in the morning - she does not count her seven from that day in which the blood stopped, but rather she checks herself another time on the morrow and begins to count seven from that day. And what are these words speaking about? When she [experienced blood] two days or three or more. But if she only [experienced it] one day - even though she checked herself on that day and she had a break of purity, she does not count from the next day. As there is an assumption that the first day will be completely impure and the source is assumed to be open that whole day, and [so,] we are concerned lest her blood came back to her after her checking, and she was gushing the whole night. And [so] this second day from her [experiencing blood] is not from the number [of clean days]. And even if she checked herself from the evening, we are concerned lest with the removal of her hands [to check], she [experienced blood. This is] except if her hands were between her 'eyes' all of the twilight (<i>bein hashmashot</i>) - meaning to say that she checked herself and left the [checking cloth] inside while it was still day and it stayed there all of the twilight until the night - and she did not find blood on it at all. In such a way, it is possible that we should say that she starts counting from the next day (see Mishneh Torah, Laws of Forbidden Intercourse 6:20). ",
                "And we are not so stringent with one who finds a stain to require her a day of a break of purity besides the day upon which she found the stain, as we said about one who [experienced blood] only one day. Rather, certainly since she checked herself after she found the stain and found it pure, she counts seven clean ones besides that day that she found the stain. [This is] meaning to say that she counts her tally from the morrow of the day upon which she found the stain, like the law of a woman who [experienced] blood two or three days, as we said above. From the outset, a woman needs an examination on each and every day of all seven days (Niddah 68b). But ex post facto, if she only checked on the first day - which is the morrow of the day she stopped [bleeding] - and she did not check again, even if several days after the seven passed, she checks herself at the time of immersion; and that is enough for her, as she already had a pause of purity before then. [If] she did not check herself on the first day, but rather only on the day of her stopping alone (the day before the first day), she checks herself on the seventh day; and that is enough for her, and [so] she immerses on the night of the eighth. [If] she did not check herself, neither on the first day nor on the seventh day - even if she checked herself on the night of the eighth - even though she made a pause of purity before then (before the first day), those seven days that passed do  not count for her at all. As she did not check during them, not at the beginning and not at the end, and she needs to count seven clean days from the time that she checked. And it is possible that the essence of this matter is because the Torah commanded (Leviticus 15:28), \"and she shall count for herself [...] and she shall become pure.\" And since she did not check - not at the beginning and not at the end - there is no counting here.",
                "And a woman needs to do this examination with cotton, which is called <i>coton</i> in the vernacular, or with clean and soft wool or with an old flax garment that is soft because of its oldness. And they all should be white, so that any appearance of redness be properly recognized upon it (Niddah 17a). And these cloths that she checks  with are called, \"witnesses,\" in the Talmud. And when she checks, she needs to insert the witness into all of the holes and cracks that are in that place. And if she found any appearance of red on it afterwards, she is impure. Any examination that is not done like this is not an examination. Even if she inserts the witness into that place, but she did not check in the holes and cracks, it is not a proper examination, as that is only called a wiping - and all the more so does a change of her cloak not count for her as an examination. These seven clean days need to be consecutive, such that impurity not intervene between them. Even if she sat all of the days and she did not [experience blood], but on the seventh day [towards] the evening, she [experienced blood] - behold, this breaks up her whole count, and she needs to count seven consecutive clean days afterwards.",
                "And the laws of the measure of the stain (Niddah 58b), and in which case it is attributed to a stain [from something else] and in which case it is not attributed [to it]. And one who has a wound in that place, if she attributes it to it until the wound heals. And the matter of what is the law of a girl minor who has had intercourse and has blood flow from her (Niddah 64b). And the blood of virginity (breaking the hymen), that the Sages determined to be like menstrual blood (Niddah 65b). And the many laws of the regular times, and the law of separation before her regular time, which is the [menstrual] period - meaning to say that day or that night that she is accustomed to [experiencing blood] upon it - is forbidden for sexual relations. [This is] from that which it is written (Leviticus 15:31), \"And you shall separate the Children of Israel from their impurity,\" and the epalanation came that they should separate from their wives before their regular times. But after the period of the regular time has passed [without blood], they are permitted in sexual relations. And the matter of the distancing from the wife that they, may their memory be blessed, commanded (Shabbat 11a) regarding the matter of menstruation, in order that a man not stumble in sin - and it is that a man should not eat with his menstruant wife from the same tray, nor pass a thing from his hand to her hand (Shabbat 13a), nor speak to her about things that often cause sin nor similar to these things.",
                "And the matter of their immersion that the Sages required them to immerse at night. And even though the immersion of a <i>zavah</i> is even during the day by Torah writ and they are all today like a <i>zavah</i>; nonetheless the Sages said that the immersion of all of them is at night, because of the dragging of her daughter (who will misconstrue the law), and as the topic is explained in the Gemara (Niddah 67b). And in a place of duress - for example that the gates of the city are closed at night, and similar to this - they permitted to immerse even during the day. But nonetheless, she is forbidden to have sexual relations until the night, lest she [experience blood before then] and break up her whole count; and it [would] come out that he had intercourse with an impure woman - as Scripture made her purity dependent on days and immersion.

And one who transgresses it and volitionally laid with a menstruant is liable excision from when he inserts himself in her; inadvertently he brings a fixed sin-offering. And the son of a menstruant (who was conceived while she was impure), is not called a <i>mamzer</i>, but rather a defective offspring. And we shall elucidate this in the negative commandment of  \"a <i>mamzer</i> shall not enter\" in the Order of Ki Tetseh (Sefer HaChinukh 465), with God's help."

And the warning is repeated in a different place, as it is written (Deuteronomy 18:10), \"There shall not be found in you, one who passes his son or his daughter in the fire.\" And so would they do - the father would hand him over to the priests for the sake of the abominations (idols), similar to that which is written about fit offerings (Leviticus 15:14), \"and he shall give them to the priest.\" And it is possible that the priests would do a waving or a presentation in front of the Molekh, and they would give him back to the father afterwards. And they would burn a big fire in front of the Molekh and the father would take his son and pass him through the flame of the fire. And so did they say in Talmud Yerushalmi Sanhedrin 7:10, \"He is not liable until he gives [him] over to the priests and he takes him and passes him through.

And once he passed him as it was their way of passing, he is liable. And the opinion of Ramban, may his memory be blessed, (Ramban on Leviticus 18:21) is that he would pass him through the flame until his soul departs - and his proofs are in the commentary to the Pentateuch that he made.",
                "I wrote what I have known above about a hint from the roots of the distancing of idolatry more generally in the Order of Vayishma Yitro (Sefer HaChinukh 26). And the matter of this idolatry of Molekh [is that] since it was an extremely bad worship and [its followers] were very fervent at that time, a warning (negative commandment) was specified about it, besides all of the many warnings about idolatry in the Torah. And this is said according to the opinion of Rambam, may his memory be blessed. But according to what appears is the opinion of Ramban, may his memory be blessed, (Ramban on Leviticus 20:5) we do not require this; since he reasons that there is a novel matter in this worship of Molekh [compared to] all of the other idolatries. As with any [other] idolatry, he is only liable if it is not its way [of worship] except for the four well-known [ways] of worship. But in this style of Molekh, one is liable who does this act of Molekh with any idolatry. And therefore, a warning was specified for it. And because the matter was extremely ugly, the Torah was so strict with it, to make one liable for it with any idolatry, even it is not its way with this. This is what appears from the sum of his words. And [regarding] this matter (see Sefer Mitzvot Gadol, Negative Commandments 40) that the liability only comes with some of the seed and not with all of it, it is possible that it was because the lying priests would promise the father of the child that through the sacrifice of this child, the rest of his seed would succeed in everything to which they would turn, and blessing and good be found in his home. And from their great trickery, they did not want to fix the law at first except for one who would have seed remain besides the one that he gives to them, lest they refuse to listen to them - whether to completely burn him or whether to pass him through the flame, according to the opinion of some of the commentators; and in order that they could also promise blessing and good to those remaining; and from this, the fools could be deceived. And therefore the Torah only made liable in the matter, just when it was similar to their worship, and not in any other way. ",

Rather, his opinion is that \" there shall not be a <i>kadesh</i>\" only comes as additional negative commandments for male homosexuality, [just] as there are several [other] warnings (negative commandments) that are repeated with different words. And I have seen about Ramban, may his memory be blessed, (Ramban on Deuteronomy 21:18) that he also does not agree with the translation, but would say that the negative commandment of  \"there shall not be a <i>kadesh</i>\" comes to warn that we not allow there to be among us - the holy nation - a <i>kadesh</i>; and that is a man who is designated to lay with men, as is known about them in the lands of the Yishmaelites to this day. And because of this, it is stated \"from the Children of Israel\" - since we are not warned from this with the [other] nations. As if there was a <i>kadesh</i> from the nations - and even amongst us - we are not warned about him; as we are not warned (commanded) about others besides us, except for idolatry alone. ",

And lest you say, from that which it is written (Deuteronomy 7:3), \"Do not get married with them\" - that is not [correct], as behold, it is explained in the Gemara that this is coming [specifically] for the seven [Canaanite] nations, and about them is it written. And [it is speaking about] specifically in their conversion; as in their gentileness, the expression, \"marriage,\" is not applicable - and as we will write with God's help in its place, in the Order of Ve'etchanan (Sefer HaChinukh 427). But it is possible to say that we learn the prohibition of a maidservant as included in the prohibition of all the nations that are not Israelites, that it is prohibited to cling to them. And [it is] like the Sages expounded (Kiddushin 68b) from that which is written  (Deuteronomy 7:4), \"For they will remove your son from after Me\" - to include all who remove. And likewise, a Canaanite maidservant is included in those who remove, since she is not a full Israelite; as behold, there are some commandments about which she is not obligated. And those are the ones in the section of the Torah in which it is explicitly written, \"Speak to the Children of Israel\" (e. g. Leviticus 18:2), to exclude anyone who is not from the Children of Israel, as it is explained in the Gemara in a few places. And with this, they are included in those that remove.",
                "It comes out according to our words that the explanation of the translator of Aramaic (it should say, is true) that there is a negative commandment with a maidservant, except that we learn it from another place. And [regarding that which] Ramban, may his memory be blessed considers the negative commandment of \"there shall not be a <i>kadesh</i>,\" that we not allow there to be among us a man who is designated for licentiousness in the manner of the Yishmaelites, as we said - there is no negative commandment about this for Rambam, may his memory be blessed. And hence he wrote that this verse only came to strengthen the warning not to have intercourse with males, as we wrote. And this is his language that he wrote about this matter: \"And this is the true opinion, that this negative commandment is repeated for strengthening; not so there be a warning (separate negative commandment) for the one laid with - as we learn the warning for the one laying and the one laid with, from its stating, 'you shall not lay.' And it is elucidated in the Gemara Sanhedrin 54b that Rabbi Yishmael is the one that puts 'there shall not be a <i>kadesh</i>,' as a warning for the one laid with. And according to his opinion, [a man] who has intercourse with a male and brings a male upon him in one [period of lack of] knowledge, he is liable two [sin-offerings]. But Rabbi Akiva says, 'He does not need two. Behold it states, \"And with a male you shall not lay (<i>tishkhav</i>), the layings of a woman\" - read it as be laid (<i>tishakhev</i>).' And hence for him, one who has intercourse with a male and brings a male upon him in one [period of lack of] knowledge is only liable one.

As it is truly destruction, since there is neither [reproductive] benefit, nor a commandment of [a wife's] appointed time - besides that the matter of this craziness is disgusting and ugly to anyone with intelligence. And it is not fitting for a man who is born for the service of his Creator to become distorted (some have the textual variant, to become repulsive) with these ugly acts. And from this root, they, may their memory be blessed, said (Sanhedrin 76b) that it is forbidden to marry a woman to a minor, as it is similar to licentiousness; and so [too,] that a man not marry an elderly woman nor a sterile woman that is not [able] to give birth (see Yevamot 68b).",

And if the one was was a minor who did not reach the category of thirteen yeas and a day, but he is nonetheless nine years and a day and up, the adult is stoned - whether he had intercourse with him or brought him upon himself - and the minor is exempt from Torah writ, but we strike him [with rabbinic lashes] (see Mishneh Torah, Laws of Theft 1:10). And it is one if he had intercourse with a male or with a hermaphrodite [anally], he is liable; but [vaginally], he is exempt (Yevamot 83b) from Torah writ, but we strike him [with rabbinic lashes]. About a <i>tumtum</i> (one whose sexual organ is covered by flesh), there is a doubt, and he is therefore forbidden rabbinically (see Mishneh Torah, Laws of Forbidden Foods 5:8).

And slaves are not included in the sexual prohibitions of relationship, and are permitted even with their mothers and their sisters - and as we wrote above (Sefer HaChinukh 209) - since they have already left the category of [gentiles] but have not come into the category of Israelites.",
                "And they, may their memory be blessed, said further as a reason for this (Yevamot 62b) that a Canaanite slave does not have relationship - meaning to say that behold, he is like a beast in this matter. And Scripture indicates this, from that which it is written (Genesis 22:5), \"Sit here with (<i>eem</i>) the donkey\" - and they, may their memory be blessed, expounded, \"A people (<i>am</i>, which is spelled the same way as <i>eem</i>) similar to a donkey\"; and they were the slaves of Avraham, our father. And nonetheless, they are [included] in the prohibition of males and beasts, according to the opinion of Rambam, may his memory be blessed. And the reason is correct; as about this, it is not applicable to say [that] he has no relationship. And they are also forbidden from having intercourse with the married woman of an Israelite; as also about them is it not applicable to say [that] he has no relationship. And they are likewise forbidden with a menstruant, and even [in the case of] a maidservant - as [the latter] are liable for all of the punishments in the Torah. And explicitly did they, may their memory be blessed, expound (Sifra, Metzora Parashat Zavim, Section 5:1), \"'And when a woman discharges' (Leviticus 15:19) - whether an Israelitess or whether a maidservant; whether a convert or a freed [maidservant].\"",

And all of the relationship of flesh that he had from the beginning in their being gentiles are no [longer] their flesh relatives at all and they are permitted to marry them - even their mother or their sister. That is from Torah writ. But the Sages forbade the thing, so that [people]  not say that they came from a stringent holiness to a light holiness. And they ordained the thing like this: That if he was married to his mother or to his sister when he was a [gentile] or a slave, they would separate them - since these were forbidden even in [being a gentile]. But if he was married to the other sexual prohibitions and they converted, they would not separate them; as there is no concern here that they will say, etc. - as behold the rest of the sexual prohibitions were permitted to them in their being [gentiles]. And from this reason, they, may their memory be blessed, only decreed with the relatives of the mother, but not with the relatives of the father. And therefore, they, may their memory be blessed, said (Yevamot 97b) that it is permitted for a convert to marry his daughter who converted; and likewise the wife of his brother from his father but not from his mother; and he is likewise permitted with the wife of his son. And it is permitted for him to marry two sisters from the father, but not from the mother. And so [too,] with all the secondary [prohibitions], they did not decree them for converts. And behold, slaves that were freed are like converts, and everything that is permitted to [the latter] is permitted to [the former]. And the same is the law with prohibition."

As the corner of the olive trees is called branchlets (<i>porot</i>), and the corner of the vineyard is called bunchless grapes (<i>ollalot</i>). And from the both of them we learn [this] for all the trees. And Ramban, may his memory be blessed, argued against him about this and said (in his introduction to the details of the commandments) that it is all a mistake. And he said that the negative commandment of \"And [in] your vineyard,\" is unique specifically to the vineyard - and it is that we leave over all of the small grapes in it that do no have a <i>katef</i> or a <i>natef</i>. And the understanding of <i>katef</i> is sprigs one over the other (clusters); [of] <i>natef</i> is that they all hang and descend. And it comes out according to this that the <i>ollalot</i> are the small grapes sometimes found in the vineyard that are called <i>gatimas</i> in the vernacular. And this is certainly a small thing, according to that which we see in our vineyards. And so did they, may their memory be blessed say (Mishnah Peah 7:4), \"Which are <i>ollalot</i>? All that do not have a <i>katef</i> nor a <i>natef</i>.\"  ",
                "And (for Ramban,) besides this obligation of bunchless grapes, there is an obligation upon us to leave over the corner. And with the corner of the vineyard, the verse did not come clearly about it, but rather we learn [by a comparison of the words], \"after you,\" from olives. And [it is] as we say in the Gemara Chullin 131a explicitly, \"There are four gifts in the vineyard: the fallen grapes; the bunchless grapes; the forgotten [grapes]; and the corner. [There are] two in the trees: forgotten [fruit]; and the corner.\" And there, it learns the corner in the vineyard, from that which it is written (Deuteronomy 24:21), \"you shall not take the bunchless grapes after you\": And Rabbi Levi said, \"'After you' is the forgotten [grapes]\" - meaning what remains after you, which is the forgotten [grapes]. And the corner we learn [from a comparison of] \"after you\" [and] \"after you\" from olives, as it is written about the olive tree (Deuteronomy 24:20), \"When you beat your olive tree, you shall not take from the branchlets (<i>tefaer</i>) after you\" - and the House of Rabbi Yishmael learned, \"That you should not takes its splendor (<i>tiferet</i>) from it\" - which is the corner. And Ramban, may his memory be blessed, learns the corner of all trees from the olive tree - for which the verse explicitly obligated the corner - and from the vineyard, about which we learned it from the expression, \"after you.\" And he, may his memory be blessed, said that Rambam, may his memory be blessed, wrote the matter corrected in his great essay (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Gifts to the Poor 4:17). But there is no addition or subtraction in the tally of the negative commandments implied in this disagreement of theirs. As the disagreement is only that Rambam, may his memory be blessed, explains \"you shall not take the bunchless grapes,\" [to be] for the corner, whereas Ramban, may his memory be blessed, explains it literally as bunchless grapes, and learns the corner of the vineyard from the expression, \"after you\"; as we have written that we learn [by a comparison of the words], \"after you,\" from olives. And this negative commandment is also rectified by a positive commandment - as if he transgressed and finished all [of the grape harvest], he is obligated to give the bunchless grapes to the poor (see Mishneh Torah, Laws of Gifts to the Poor 4).",

And an oath of speech is what is stated in the Torah (Leviticus 5:4), \"Or a soul that swears to express with the lips to do bad or to do good.\" And it is divided into four parts - two of the future and two of the past, such as swearing on something that was done or not done, and on something that in the future he will  do or will not do. And an oath of speech is only practiced with things that it is possible for a person to do, whether in the past or in the future. How is of the past? \"I ate,\" or \"I did not eat\"; and so [too,] \"I threw,\" or \"I did not throw a stone into the sea.\" And how is of the future? \"I will eat,\" or \"I will not eat\"; or \"I will throw,\" or \"I will not throw.\" But with things that have a prevention from the Torah, an oath of speech is not practiced. As an oath only rests upon an optional matter - that if he wants, he does it and if he wants, he does not do it - as it is stated, \"to do bad or to do good.\" But with any matter of a commandment, there is an obligation upon him to do it.

And this is an extremely bad trait, and [so] our perfect Torah distanced us from it and warned us about it in this place, as it is written (Leviticus 19:13), \"You shall not oppress your neighbor\" - as one who holds the money of someone else in this manner that we said is called an oppressor. And also included in oppression is anyone who is liable specific money to his fellow and he oppresses him, such as one who suppresses the wage of a wage worker and similar to it. As we do not require that the money actually come from the hand of the oppressed to the hand of the oppressor; but rather anyone that has a claim of specific money against him and he delays it as a result of his violence or any angle of deception is called an oppressor. And even though oppression, robbery and theft are one matter even if the act of one is different from the another, as the intention of the three of them is that a man not take that which is someone else's in any way; since people pilfer each other in these three ways, Scripture specified all of them and warned about each one on its own.

                "And the explanation of this matter and the main reason according to my opinion is from two angles. The one is that [in] everything that God, blessed be He, wanted to distance from us a great distancing for our good, He multiplied for us many warnings (negative commandments) about it. And there is also a [direct] benefit found for us in the multiplication of the warnings. And it is like they, may their memory be blessed, said (Makkot 23b) that the Omnipresent wanted to give merit to Israel; therefore he multiplied the commandments for them. And the intention in their saying commandments is also about the warnings (and not just the positive commandments). As He multiplied many warnings about that which was possible to inform with one warning; like here that it was possible to warn them more generally, \"You shall not take the money of others not according to the law.\" But [instead] the warnings to us about the thing were multiplied, so that we can receive much reward for separating from sin. And so too, in every place where they, may their memory be blessed, said, \"[So as] to [make one] transgress it with many negative commandments,\" we will explain the matter like this. As it should not be explained, God forbid, that God, may He be blessed, wanted to come to His creatures with ploys, so that He would multiply the vengeance upon them. As God, blessed be He and blessed be His name, desires to give merit to His creatures, not to make [them] liable. But He prompts them with one prompting after another, in order that they learn to take rebuke and merit greatly in their distancing from sin.

And the French rabbi (Rabbi Moshe of Coucy, in SeMaG, Mitzvot Lo Taase 156), wrote in the tally of the commandments that since we find that Rava said that oppression and robbery are one, we will not count oppression in the number of the negative commandments. And he counts in place of this, \"and not be like Korach and his congregation\" - meaning to say, that we not [take part] in a controversy. And in our opinion - ours - the intention of Rava was not that they should not be counted as two negative commandments, but rather to have one transgress robbery with two negative commandments, and so too [in the case of] oppression. And since their content is different, we will count them as two negative commandments - like robbery and theft.

And the Torah extended the time of his payment the entire night, as it is stated, \"until morning.\" And we learned about a night wage worker from another place, that the time of his payment is the whole day, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 24:15), \"On its day you shall give his wage, and the sun should not set upon it.\" And they, may their memory be blessed, explained (Bava Metzia 110b) that this verse is referring to a night wage worker. And the language of the Mishnah is \"A day wage worker collects the whole night, and a night wage worker collects the whole day. And even though two verses came about this commandment, they are only one commandment; and the one is stated to complete the law of the commandment. And we should not count that which the Torah has come to complete the law of a commandment [to be a commandment] on its own. And the content of this commandment - that we not delay payment to the wage worker, but rather we pay him at a set time - that is the principle of the commandment. And with the two negative statements mentioned about it, we knew when is the time of the payment of wage workers - whether a day wage worker or a night wage worker. And remember this principle [mentioned above] for all of the commandments; as it is a great principle in the calculation of the commandments.

And therefore we were commanded to give the wage of the wage earner - as 'he urgently depends upon it,' to sustain himself from it. And it appears that therefore did he place the limit of its time to be one day and not more - as it is the way of people to sometimes fast for a day.

And so [too,] that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Bava Metzia 110a) that a day hourly wage-worker collects the whole day and a night hourly wage-worker collects the whole night. A monthly wage worker, a weekly wage worker, a yearly wage worker, a seven-year wage worker - [if] he leaves during the day, he collects [that] whole day, [and if] he leaves during the night, he collects [that] whole night. And [also] the law of one who gives his cloak to a craftsman - when he has finished it and informed him - the whole time that it is in the hand of the craftsman, he does not transgress; if he gave it to him and [the owner] did not pay him on the day that [the craftsman] gave it to him, he has transgressed.

And all the time that he delays his payment - even after the time - he transgresses a negative commandment from the rabbis, may their memory be blessed; and they based it on this verse, that is written (Proverbs 3:28), \"Do not say to your fellow, 'Go, and come back, etc.'\" And [also] the law of the wage worker, that he makes an oath (that the money is still owed) and takes [it], so long as he claims his wages within its time - and even if the wage worker was a minor, he too makes an oath and takes - and they, may their memory be blessed, gave a reason for this (Bava Metzia 112b): since the [employer] is preoccupied with his workers.

Just like a deaf person is unique that he is alive - to exclude the dead that is not alive.\" Even thought we do not have the power to know in which way a curse impacts upon the one cursed, and with what power within speech there is to bring [that impact] upon him, we know more generally that people are concerned about curses - whether Israel or other nations - and say that curses of people, and even curses of commoners, have an impact on the one cursed and attaches malediction and distress to him. And since we know this thing from the mouth of the creatures, we will say that it is from the roots of the commandment that God prevented us from injuring others with our mouths, [just] like he prevented us from injuring them with action.

And hence we have known and it is always seen that to the extent of the importance of a man's soul and its clinging to the elevated things - like [is the case with] the souls of the righteous and the pious - will their words be quick to impact upon all that they speak about. And this is something well-known and famous among those that know knowledge and understand science. And it possible to say also that the matter is to stifle a quarrel between people and that there be peace between them; since the birds of the sky make the voice travel, and maybe the words of the one that cursed will come to the ears of the one that he cursed. And Rambam, may his memory be blessed, said (Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Lo Taase 317) as the reason of the commandment [that is is] in order that the soul of the one that curses not be moved to vengeance and that he not become used to anger. And he wrote at further length about this in his book. And it appears to me from his words that, in his opinion, he does not see any injury to the one cursed from the curse, but rather that the Torah is distancing the matter from the perspective of the one that curses - that he not accustom himself to vengeance and anger and to lowly traits.

And he is liable in any language that he curses with a name or appellation, as the names that the gentiles call the Holy One, blessed be He, are among the appellations (even though they are in their languages).

                "The details of the commandment and the great amount of warnings that they, may their memory be blessed, warned us about talebearing and about its partner - evil speech - are explained in scattered locations in the Talmud and in the Midrash (see Mishneh Torah, Laws of Human Dispositions 7). And they explicitly said about evil speech (Arakhin 15b), that it kills its speaker and its receiver (listener), (and) that it is said about it, \"and the receiver more than all of them [does it kill].\" And they warned much about it  to the point that they said (Bava Metzia 59b), \"One who has someone who was hung in his [family] record, let him not say, 'Hang me a fish [on the grill].'\" And they said, (Arakhin 16a), \"Within the category of 'the dust of (adjunct)' evil speech is one who praises his friend in front of [his friend's] hater, as it is stated (Proverbs 27:14), 'He who blesses his friend, etc.'\" ",

And even though this negative commandment does not have lashes because it does not have an act [involved] with it, there are times that it even has a death penalty, as is known in the law of the informer. And this law the sages permitted to do outside of the land [of Israel] for the improvement of the world: it is better that one man die and not damage and destroy the bodies - or even the property - of the many.",
                "And I will write for you, my son, a little of that which is in the Gemara about this matter; and if you will merit knowledge, you will see everything in its place. We follow the textual variant in the chapter [entitled] HaGozel Batra (Bava Kamma 116b), \"A certain man who showed piles of wheat of the Exilarch’s household [...] Rav Naḥman obligated him to pay.\" And the reason is because of the law of causation (<i>garmi</i>, Bava Kamma 117b). And [that is] specifically when he showed him on his own. But as a result of duress, he is exempt - and as \"We learned, 'An Israelite who was under the duress of gentiles and he showed them the money of his friend is exempt'\" (Bava Kamma 117a). And our teachers, may their memory be blessed, explained it, that it is not the last word [that] they put his body under duress; but even if they put him under duress with money - that they would take money from him, if he does not show the money of his fellow - he is exempt. As anyone who shows [it] out of duress is exempt, and he is only obligated if he shows it on his own. And so wrote Rabbi Avraham bar Rabbi David, may his memory be blessed. But if he gave and took with [his] hand, he is liable - and even because of duress [to his life]. And if you will say [that] there is nothing that stands in front of saving a soul, it can be said, \"Do we tell him to die? We say to him that he should give and pay, and not save himself with the money of others.\" And even with someone pursued who is fleeing the pursuer and breaks vessels, [he is] liable [to pay for this damage]  - and even though he did not break them intentionally, but rather unintentionally, and at the time that he was fleeing from the pursuer to save himself - and all the more so is he liable for repayment, when he gave and took with [his] hand.",
                "But if he gave and took with [his] hand after he showed them from duress, we see the thing as if it is burned from the time that he showed them, and he is no longer liable on account of his giving and taking. And he is also not liable on account of showing, since he showed [it] because of duress, as we have written. And so do we say there (Bava Kamma 117a), \"A certain man who showed the wine of Rav Mari and Rav Pinhas, the sons of Rav Pappa\" - the explanation [of which] is because of duress - \"They said to him, 'Carry [it] and bring [it],' [and] he carried and brought [it].\" And it was concluded that once \"he brought them to it [at the outset, it is as if] he burned it\" - and he is no longer liable for it. But when he shows it on his own without a claim of duress, he is liable for death and repayment.  As we follow the textual variant there, \"A certain man who desired to show his fellow’s straw shed came before Rav. Rav said to him, 'Do not do this.'\" - meaning to say, he warned him. \"He did not obey him. Rav Kahana was sitting before Rav; Rav Kahana rose and dislodged his neck\" - meaning to say, he killed him. And this is proven [by] that which \"Rav said to Rav Kahana, 'Now is the [time] of the monarchy of the Persians, and they are particular about bloodshed.'\" And we also say in the Gemara (Bava Kamma 119a) concerning the question we had whether it is permitted to destroy the money of an informer, that we respond to it, \"His money should not be more severe than his body\" - hence it is permitted to destroy his body. However that is only at the time of the act and with a warning, and like the story of Rav Kahana - but he does not have to accept the warning, as with other death penalties. And it appears that one who is established as an informer is as if he is warned and standing, and [so] it is permitted to kill him at any time.",
                "And the opinion of Rambam, may his memory be blessed, that he wrote (Mishneh Torah, Laws of One Who Injures a Person or Property 8:10-11) about the law of an informer is thus: \"Once he said, 'Behold, I am informing about the body or money of x' - and even if it is negligent money - behold, this one has permitted himself for death. And we warn him and say to him, 'Do not inform.' If he was brazen-faced and said, 'No, rather I will inform' - it is a commandment to kill him, and whoever is first to kill him, merits. [If] the informer did that which he plotted and informed, it appears to me that it is forbidden to kill him; unless he is established as an informer, lest he inform [on] others.\" To here is the language of the rabbi. He required a warning for one who is not established as an informer and that he accept the warning. And for the one who is established as an informer, it appears from his words, that he does not need a warning. And an informer may not say, \"Because x was afflicting me, I am informing [on] him to the gentiles\" - as this does not exempt him from his punishment. But it is permitted for the community to inform to the gentiles about one who is afflicting the community. And so did Rambam, may his memory be blessed, write (Mishneh Torah, Laws of One Who Injures a Person or Property 8:11). And it is forbidden to destroy the money of an informer, on account of [An evildoer] \"Prepares but the righteous one wears\" (Job 27:17). And so is it concluded in the chapter [entitled] HaGozel (Bava Kamma 119a).  "

And there in the Gemara, they mentioned for us the signs [with which] to recognize the species of mules: that are like the mother with the ears, the tail and the voice. And there is no doubt that in that the specie of the mother of mules is [all] the same, the specie of their fathers is also the same - this is known to all men. And the rest of the details of the commandment are in Tractate Kilayim (see Tur, Yoreh Deah 297).",

And whether he covered [the seeds] with his hand, with his foot or even with a tool - he is lashed for all of them. And one who sows them in a holed pot, is like he sows in the actual ground (Mishnah Kilayim  7:8).

But the bitter seeds - even those that are capable of healing people - do not have [the prohibition] of forbidden mixtures of seeds. And behold, forbidden mixtures of trees are included in this negative commandment of \"your field shall you not sow [with] a forbidden mixture.\" However the prohibition of forbidden mixtures of trees is only by way of grafting - for example, that he grafted a sprig of an apple tree to a citron (<i>etrog</i>) tree, and all that is similar to it, that are two species. But by way of sowing - for example, to sow the seed of a tree with [other] seeds - this thing is permissible even from the outset; except for the vineyard, as we will explain in the Order of Ki Tetseh (Sefer HaChinukh 549), with God's help.",
                "And they, may their memory be blessed, said (Mishnah Kilayim 8:1) that even though there is lashes for both one who sows seeds of a forbidden mixture and one who grafts trees of a forbidden mixture - behold, they are permitted to be eaten; as it is only their planting that was forbidden. And so [too,] they permitted planting a sprig of a tree that was grafted with a forbidden mixture, and to plant a seed that was sowed in a forbidden mixture. And seeds are divided into three groups and three names and these are them: grains, legumes and garden seeds - and there are some of the garden seeds that are called types of vegetables. And even though it was forbidden to us to mix two types of seeds even if they are of one name - for example, wheat with barley, in that both of them are called grain; and so [too,] fava beans and peas, even though both of them are called legumes - nonetheless, there is a small distinction between them in the difference of the name. How is this? That if one part of wheat bigger than the twenty-three [individual] parts of barley was mixed unintentionally, there is no need to separate it out; less than this, he must separate it. But if it was from the garden seeds that was mixed, its measure is one in twenty-four of that which we plant from that type of garden seed in [a field, the measure of which is] a <i>beit seah</i>. And grain and legumes are like one specie concerning this, and their measurement is one part in twenty four of grain [regardless of how much of that type is planted in a field]. And they, may their memory be blessed, said (Mishnah Shekalim 1:1) that  we announce about the shekalim and forbidden mixtures on the first of Adar; and everyone goes out to his garden and to his field, and cleans it from [these mixtures]. And everything that is two species, even though they are similar in their shape, are forbidden on account of forbidden mixtures. And everything that is one specie, even though their shapes are different because of the variation of location or the variation in the work on the land - behold, it is like one specie.",
                "And the laws of the measure of distancing needed between two species are many (Mishnah Kilayim 2:10).

And that which they said in Mishnah Kilayim 3:1 - and it was also brought in Shabbat in the chapter [entitled] Amar Rabbi Akiva (Mishnah Shabbat 9:2) - that we plant five [types] of seeds in a garden bed that is six handbreadths by six handbreadths. And that, which according to our words, they should have said nine - eight on the four sides and one in the middle - is not difficult; as they already resolved  it in the Talmud Yerushalmi Shabbat 9:2), that [the Mishnah] was learned about a garden bed [surrounded by other] garden beds.",
                "And the principle that comes out in our hands from their words, may their memory be blessed, regarding forbidden mixtures of seeds is that anytime that there is a proper distance between the two types - and that is one and a half handbreadths, as we said - even if the leaves are mixed up, we do not concern ourselves about them; and likewise, anytime they appear separated one from the other, such that the leaves of one garden bed lean to one side and the leaves of the garden bed adjacent to it [lean] to another side - even though they are feeding one from the other - we do not concern ourselves with their feeding. As the Torah [only] paid heed to both of them together - that they feed one from the other and that their feeding be seen clearly by the eyes of the onlookers. And about what are these words speaking, that it needs distancing, or something that separates? When he sowed in his [own] field. But if his field is planted with wheat, it is permitted for his fellow to sow barley adjacent to it; as it is stated, \"your field shall you not sow [with] a forbidden mixture\" - meaning to say, specifically, your field - as it was not written, \"the land shall you not sow [with] a forbidden mixture.\" And they, may their memory be blessed, also learned (Kiddushin 39a) [from] \"your field,\" to say that it is only in the Land that the prohibition of forbidden mixtures of seeds is practiced, but not outside of the Land. [This is the case,] even though they did not say thus regarding the grafting of trees, which is also derived from \"your field,\" but which is rather practiced in every place - and as Shmuel said [there] in the first chapter of Kiddushin, since he compares the grafting of trees to the mating of beasts which is practiced in every place. They, may their memory be blessed have already resolved [this difficulty] there in Kiddushin. And if you desire, my son, to know [their resolution], see it there.

                "<b>To not eat or to drink in the way of a glutton and a drunkard:</b> To not indulge in much eating and drinking in the days of youth, according to the conditions described with a rebellious son (<i>ben sorrer oumoreh</i>) in Scripture, with what the Sages, may their memory be blessed, explained about it in Tractate Sanhedrin. And the warning to us about this is from that it is written (Leviticus 19:26), \"You shall not eat upon the blood.\" As so did they say explicitly in Sanhedrin 63a, \"From where is the warning for a rebellious son? [Hence] we learn to say, 'You shall not eat upon the blood'\" - meaning to say, do not eat an eating that leads to shedding blood, and that is the eating of the rebellious son, such that he is liable the death penalty for such a bad eating. And Rambam, may his memory be blessed, wrote (Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Lo Taase 195), \"And even though this is a general negative commandment as we have explained in the ninth principle, it is not distant [to say] that when the punishment is explicit - meaning to say the punishment of the rebellious son, the statute of which is stoning, being explicit in Scripture - we are not concerned about whether the warning is from the general negative commandments.\" And he gave a reason for his words, as it is written in his book, Negative Commandment 195, and in the ninth principle. And Ramban, may his memory be blessed, wrangled with him greatly about this. However they both concede that the negative commandment of \"You shall not eat upon the blood,\" and anything similar to it that includes many things - as we will write here - and their content and the reason for their prohibition is not the same, except that Scripture forbids them all in one negative commandment and in one category (literally, with one name), is called a general negative commandment. And it a law that we do not administer lashes for a general negative commandment. But Rambam, may his memory be blessed, would say that because of this is the rebellious son punished with the death penalty for this eating - since Scripture explicitly revealed that his punishment is stoning in another place. And he elucidated at the the introduction to his book (Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Root 14 at the end) that anything about which Scripture makes liable for excision or the death penalty of the court is a negative commandment, except for the Pesach sacrifice and circumcision - as they have excision but they are positive commandments. And from this principle was it derived by the Rabbi that the law of the warning of the rebellious son - even though it is learned from a general negative commandment - is like the law of other warnings, since Scripture made the punishment of the death penalty about it explicit.",
                "And Ramban, may his memory be blessed, does not hold of this approach and he does not lean towards it; but [rather] he holds that there always be an explicit warning about the one to be lashed or about the one being killed - and not from a general negative commandment. And even if Scripture makes his death penalty explicit a hundred times, the Rabbi will still say that it does not punish unless it warns (and not from a general negative commandment). And he does not consider a general negative commandment as a warning in the place of lashes, because of that which is a famous law in our hands, \"We do not administer lashes for a general negative commandment.\" And therefore he, may his memory be blessed, said that they already clarified in the Gemara from which verse we learned to administer lashes to the rebellious son: And they said in Sanhedrin 71b, \"It is like Rabbi Abahu, as Rabbi Abahu said, 'We learned lashes for one who puts out a bad name, as it is written about him (Deuteronomy 22:18), \"and they shall chasten him,\" from \"and they chastised him\" (Deuteronomy 21:18) that is written about the rebellious son; and \"son\" from \"son\" [in] \"And if the evildoer be a son of (liable for) lashing\" (Deuteronomy 25:2).'\" And there is also a difficulty for Rambam, may his memory be blessed, in this, [since] he writes in the second root, that we do not give lashes by the power of a comparison (which is what seems to be indicated here). And he also challenged the Rabbi about his statement that the rebellious son is liable for the death penalty for his indulging in much eating and he did not distinguish between the first eating and the second. But they said explicitly in the Gemara in Sanhedrin 71 that we do not punish the first eating of the rebellious son with the death penalty, but rather lashes, as they said, \"We warn him in front of two [witnesses] and we lash him in front of three. [If] he goes back and goes bad, he is judged by twenty-three [judges for the death penalty].\" He, may his memory be blessed, also wrote and this is his language, \"And what is fit to take out from this is that the first eating is prevented (forbidden) and its punishment is lashes, and the punishment of the second is death, and they are two preventions (negative commandments) in the tally of commandments, and they are [both] included in 'You shall not eat upon the blood.'\" To here [are his words].",
                "And behold I will mention to you from the things that they, may their memory be blessed, explained (Sanhedrin 63a) are included in this negative commandment: They, may their memory be blessed, said that there is a warning to [not] eat an animal before its soul departs; and also to [not] eat consecrated meat before the sprinkling of the blood, and like they said (Sanhedrin 63a), \"Do not eat the meat and the blood is still in the bowl.\" And so [too,] did they learn from it that we do not provide a consolation meal over those killed by the court; and so [too,] that a Sanhedrin that killed a soul not taste anything all of that day; and that a person not taste anything before he prays (Berakhot 10b); and so [too] the warning to the rebellious son, as we said.",
                "It is from the roots of the commandment [that it is] because most sins of people are done as a result of much eating and drinking, as it is written (Deuteronomy 32:15), \"And Yeshurun grew fat and kicked.\" And so [too,] \"you became fat, you became thick, you became covered; and he abandoned the God that made him, etc.\" And so [too,] did they, may their memory be blessed, say [about a man's cow] (Berakhot 32a), \"Who caused you to kick (rebel against) me? The vetch which I fed you.\" And more generally they said, \"Filling his stomach is a type of sin\" - meaning to say after filling the stomach, a person come to do bad sins. And the matter is that foodstuffs are the dough for the physical, whereas contemplation of the intellect and of the fear of God and His precious commandments is the dough of the soul. And the soul and the physical are complete opposites, as I have written at the beginning of the book. And so with the strengthening of the dough of the physical, the dough of the soul is weakened a little. And from this root there were some of the Sages, may their memory be blessed, that would only benefit from foodstuffs just what they required, only to keep their souls alive; and as it is written (Proverbs 13:28), \"A righteous person eats to the satiation of his soul.\" And therefore, for our good, did our perfect Torah prevent us form indulging in eating and drinking more than is necessary - lest the physical overcome the soul greatly, until it makes it ill and destroys it completely. And so in order to distance this matter fully, it warned us about this with a strong punishment - and that is the death penalty. And this is what appears [correct] to me about the topic. And a man is warned about this at the start of the power of the passion of his youth and at the beginning of his obligation to guard his soul (to observe the commandments) - and these are the first three months from when he begins to grow two [pubic] hairs until [the hair] surrounds the whole member. And from that time, he is to take ethical teaching for all of his days. As in that foods are a constant matter with man - it is impossible for him without it - the Torah did not command about it at every instance, but rather it 'teaches him early' at one time, to benefit him for all of the times.

But if his father was a sage - even though he was not equivalent to his teacher - his father has precedence. And in the chapter [entitled] Chelek (Sanhedrin 110a), they said, \"Anyone who disagrees with his teacher is as if he disagrees with the Divine Presence, as it is stated (Numbers 26:9), 'in their quarreling with the Lord.'\" And they spoke at much length about this matter there.",

And even though an impure object [in] an enclosed place [in the body] does not render impure for touching - as an enclosed place is not [considered] touching - it renders impure from the law of carrying; such that one who carries in an enclosed place is called, carrying, and he is impure. And only a person is rendered impure from carrying without touching, but not vessels.

And even though their limbs have not become joined, dead fetuses render impure (Nazir 50a); a <i>kazayit</i> of flesh from a dead body; and a complete single limb, even though it does not have  a <i>kazayit</i> of flesh - all of these render impure through touch, through carrying and through a tent. And each one of the two hundred and forty-eight limbs in a person is called a limb, as each and every one of them has flesh, sinews and bones. But teeth are not from the tally. If the form of a man was recognizable in the bones of the dead body, they render impure in a tent, even if there is no flesh upon them. And these are the bones that they, may their memory be blessed, said render impure even in a tent: the spine; the skeleton; and the majority of its structure or the majority of its number - meaning to say the majority of the number of the bones. And the spine and the skull that they said is specifically when they are whole. But if the spine was missing even one ring or the skull even like a <i>sela</i> coin, they do not render impure in a tent. And the majority of its number is one hundred and twenty-five bones from the two hundred and forty-eight limbs that are in a person. And [regarding] the rest of the bones that do not have the majority of the structure or the majority of the number, if they have a quarter of a <i>kav</i> of bones, they render impure even in a tent. But if not, they do not render impure in a tent. And the impurity of a dead body is seven days. And the rest of its details are elucidated in the Order of Tahorot, and mainly in Tractate Oholot (see Tur, Yoreh Deah 372).",

But [it is not practiced] by females, as so came the explanation [of], \"Speak to the priests, the sons of Aharon, 'For a soul he shall not become impure for his people'\" - specifically the sons of Aharon and not the daughters of Aharon.

                "<b>The commandment of the matter of the impurity of the priests for their relatives, and included in it is that each one in Israel should mourn for their six relatives [the identify of which is] well-known:</b> That the priests should become impure for the dead bodies (the relatives) that are mentioned in the Torah, as it is stated (Leviticus 21:3), \"for her, he shall become impure.\" And this is a positive commandment, as so did the explanation come. And so is it explained in Sifra, Emor, Section 1:12, \"'For her, he shall become impure' - is a commandment. If he does not want to become impure, we make him impure by force.\" And were it not that we received this explanation from our Sages, I would have reasoned to say that it be optional - if he wants, he becomes impure; if he does not want, he does not become impure - since Scripture prevented him from becoming impure for the rest of his relatives. And I would have said that regarding these mentioned in the section of the Torah, they were permitted to become impure if they wanted. Hence the explanation about it came to us - that it is not optional, but rather a commandment. And the Sages, may their memory be blessed, mentioned a story that Yosef the priest came when his wife died on the eve of Pesach and he did not want to become impure, and the Sages pushed him and made him impure by force. And Rambam, may his memory be blessed, wrote (Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Ase 37), \"And this itself is the commandment of mourning - meaning to say that each person in Israel is obligated to mourn for his relatives, meaning the six relatives mentioned in Scripture.\" And the verse that the Rabbi brought [as a source] (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Mourning 1:1) for the commandment of mourning is that which is stated by Aharon, \"if I had eaten the sin-offering today, would it have been good in the eyes of the Lord?\" (Leviticus 10:19). And he said, \"And for the strengthening of this commandment did they elucidate about the priest that he is warned about impurity, that he should become impure regardless like other Israelites, in order that the laws of mourning not become weakened. And it was already elucidated that mourning of the first day is by Torah writ - and that is the day of death and burial. And they said in the elucidation in Moed Katan 14b [that] it is not practiced on the holiday - the positive commandment of the many comes and pushes off the positive commandment of the individual. And behold, it is elucidated [from this] that the obligation of mourning is from Torah writ and that it is a positive commandment - but only on the first day. And the remaining six [days] are rabbinic. And even a priest observes mourning on the first day, as he becomes impure for his relatives. And understand this.\" To here [are his words].",
                "What I have written many times about previous commandments is from the roots of this commandment - that man is acted upon according to his actions that he does. As since he is a physical being, he is not impacted by something in potential, until he takes matters from the potential to the actual. Hence when a punishment of an incident of death of one of his relatives - about which  it is natural for him to love them - comes to him, the Torah obligates him to do acts with himself that arouse him to focus his thoughts on the anguish that has come to him. And then he will know and contemplate to himself that his iniquities caused it to him, that this anguish came upon him. As God, may He be blessed, 'does not afflict man from His heart, nor causes woe to the sons of man,' except from the angle of sins. And this is our - we, the practitioners of the precious Jewish faith - perfect belief. And when a man puts this matter into his heart with the act of mourning, he will move his mind to repent and improve his deeds, according to his ability. And behold, we have found with this a great benefit for people in the commandment of mourning. But the heretics that want to be wise that make empty the matters of the world and the acts of God, may He be blessed, place perversity and evil on their hearts: They make the death of the sons of man dependent on the happenstance of time, and think - in their evil thoughts - that 'the incident of man and beast, it is the same incident for them; and like the death of one is the death of the other.' And hence they wrote in their books - they should only be burnt - \"Unfortunate is the one who worries [about this] at all.\" And in order to uproot and to pull out this evil belief of theirs from our hearts, the Torah obligated us in this commandment. [This is] besides the benefit of what we mentioned. ",
                "From the laws of the commandment is that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Rif, Ramban and Rashba on Moed Katan 14b) that the first day is by Torah writ and the [next] six are rabbinic. And even though it is stated (Genesis 50:10), \"and he made a mourning for his father seven days,\" [when] the Torah was given, the law was recreated (a new law came into being). And nonetheless they, may their memory be blessed, said (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Mourning 1:1) that Moshe, our teacher, ordained seven days of mourning and seven days of festivity. And they, may their memory be blessed, said (Moed Katan 27a) that the obligation of mourning does not begin until the coffin cover is closed - meaning to say that the whole time that he is not buried, the mourner is not forbidden in anything from all of the things of mourning. And because of this reason, King David bathed and anointed [himself] when [his] child died, before [the child] was buried. And that which they said (Shabbat 136a) that we do not mourn for any [infant] that has not [been alive] for thirty days, is because of a doubt. But they, may their memory be blessed, said in the Gemara that if we clearly know that he has finished his months [of gestation], his law is like the law of other dead people regarding mourning; and likewise for all the other things is his law like a complete person.",
                "And so [too,] did they, may their memory be blessed, say (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Mourning 1:10) [regarding] those that separate themselves from all the ways of the community, and likewise heretics, apostates and informants - that we do not mourn at all for all of them, since their death is gladness for the world. And this is not a punishment for their relatives, but rather a merit for them. And this is all from the root that I wrote. And about them is stated (Psalms 139:21), \"Do I not hate those You hate?\" And likewise, we do not mourn for one who kills himself on purpose. And in its place, it is clarified how we know that he struck himself on purpose. And also from the laws of the commandment are the things that they, may their memory be blessed, said (Moed Katan 21a) that the mourner is forbidden with on the first day from Torah writ and the rest of the days rabbinically; the law of seven and thirty [days]; the law of twelve months of mourning for father and mother; the law of tearing - who are the relatives who tear and what is the time [for it], how is it for [other] relatives and how is it for father and mother, for which of his relatives, and his teacher and his greats, for which places in the Land of Israel in their destruction; the law of the tear that we darn immediately or after a time and the law that a woman darns immediately so as not be disgraced; the law of the holidays that interrupt [the count] and do not count [in the tally], and that which they said (Moed Katan 19a) that the decree of seven is negated for anyone who buries his dead even an hour before the holiday, and the decree of thirty is negated if seven days passed before the holiday and he began even one hour of the thirty [days], and that the status of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur is the same as the holidays of Pesach, Shevouot and Sukkot; that which they said (Moed Katan 24b) that even though there is no mourning on the intermediate days of the festival, a man tears for a dead [relative] for which he is obligated to mourn; the law that we only observe one day and do not tear for a distant report [of death] after thirty days, - since the law is like Rabbi Mani, who said like this in the Gemara [Moed Katan 21b] - but he tears even for a distant report for his father and for his mother according to the opinion of Ramban, may this memory be blessed, (Torat HaAdam 61b), but not according to the opinion of the rabbi, Rabbi Avraham beRebbi David (Ravad), may his memory be blessed.",
                "And regarding the eulogy, for whom do we eulogize and how, and what is [the relation] of Shabbat, holidays, intermediate festival days, Channukah and Purim to it; for the death of whom do we cancel Torah study; the matter of justification of the decree, the blessings and consolations that are made in the house of the mourner; the matter of gathering the bones of relatives and likewise the gathering of the bones of his father and his mother; that which they said (Moed Katan 20b) that we mourn with mourners, who are relatives for which we would mourn, in front of them [for their honor] from the words of the [Rabbis]; that which they said that a man mourns for his wife - and she for her husband - and for brothers from the mother from the words of the [Rabbis]; that he does not mourn for his son or his brother from a maidservant or an idolatress (gentile) - even if they convert - not from Torah writ and not from the words of the [Rabbis]; that a priest becomes impure for his wife - even though the mourning of a man for his wife is only from the words of the [Rabbis], they made her like a dead body that one is commanded to be involved with (<i>met mitzvah</i>) - but once the coffin cover is closed, he may no longer become impure; that which they said that the obligation of mourning is rabbinic for three relatives and these are them - a brother or sister from the mother, a married or betrothed sister from either the father or the mother and [even if the mother] was raped or seduced - and therefore a priest does not become impure for these relatives. And these matters with the rest of its details are elucidated in Tractate [Moed Katan] and in other places in Berakhot, Ketuvot and Yevamot and in Sifra, Parashat Emor el HaKohanim (see Tur, Yoreh Deah 372-374).",
                "And this commandment of the obligations of impurity for the dead body of a relative is practiced by a priest in every place and at all times. And so is it with males of the priesthood, but the women are not [commanded] in this obligation. As so did the explanation come - that the one who is prevented from becoming impure for others than the relatives, he is the one who is commanded to become impure for the relatives. But since women priests were not prevented from becoming impure for a dead body - as is explained in its place (Sefer HaChinukh 263) - so too, were they not commanded to become impure to the relatives regardless; but they must nonetheless mourn. And thy have a choice whether to become impure if they want. And know this and remember it. And the commandment of the obligation of mourning - that is dragged along with his commandment, as we said - is practiced in every place and at all times by every person, whether priest, Israelite, male or female. And a priest who transgresses this and does not want to become impure for the six relatives mentioned in Scripture - and likewise, a priest or an Israelite who did not want to mourn for his relatives with the things that the Sages enumerated in the obligation of the main mourning of the first day - has violated this positive commandment. And I have already written above (Sefer HaChinukh 6) that the court coerces [one who refrains from] a positive commandment. And there are some of the commentators that wrote that the commandment of mourning is not considered a commandment from the Torah. Maybe their opinion is to say that even though one bereaved (<i>onen</i>) is forbidden in consecrated foods from Torah writ, the whole matter of mourning is nonetheless rabbinic. "

                "<b>That a priest who immersed that day (<i>tevul yom</i>) not serve until his sun set:</b> That a priest who immersed that day not serve until his sun sets. And even though he immersed and became pure, he needs the setting of the sun - since he is like a secondary impurity until his sun sets. As so did they, may their memory be blessed, explain, \"it shall be brought into water and be impure until evening and become pure\" (Leviticus 11:32): The verse called one who immersed that day impure, even though he immersed, until his sun set   (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Other Sources of Defilement 10:1). But nonetheless he is not impure like he was before the immersion. As at the beginning, he was a primary impurity and after the immersion he is called a secondary impurity. And about this is it stated (Leviticus 21:6), \"and they shall not desecrate the name of their God.\" As so did the received explanation come about it, and so is it in the ninth chapter of Sanhedrin 83b. As there they said, \"'Holy shall they be to their God, and they shall not desecrate the name of their God'; if it is not regarding one impure - as it was already elucidated (Sefer Hachinukh 178) - teach it for the matter of the one who has immersed on that day.\" And it is learned over there from [the inferential comparison] of \"desecration\" [and] \"desecration.\"",
                "It is from the roots of the commandment [that it is] since the priest is the messenger between Israel and their Father in the heavens (based on Yoma 18b). And through his actions and his sacrifices will a man become reconciled in front of his Creator, and his iniquity atoned. Therefore it is an obligation upon him to be completely clean in body at the time of the service. And perhaps the spirit of impurity has not fully passed from him until the sunset. And blessed is the Master of wisdom, as He is the one who knows - and not us - at what time it becomes fit for someone who became impure to be involved in His service, blessed be He. And He told us that it is the time of the sunset for some impurities.",
                "From the laws of the commandment is that which they, may their memory be blessed, said that one who immersed on that day is the same whether it was from a stringent impurity such as the impurity of a dead body, discharge or <i>tsaraat</i>; or from light impurity such as the impurity of a swarming animal or similar to it - it requires the sun setting. And this matter is whether it is with a man or vessels, whether it is with an impurity from Torah writ or even with a rabbinic impurity - it requires the sun setting. And the understanding of one who immersed on that day (<i>tevul yom</i>) is to say one who immersed, but his sun did not set. And this is its understanding in every place. And if he touched foods and drinks of the priestly tithe, he disqualifies them and makes them a tertiary impurity - as he is like a secondary impurity, as we have said. If they afterwards touched other foods, they do not disqualify them, as a tertiary does not create a quaternary with priestly tithe. And if the one who immersed that day touches consecrated foods or drinks, he makes them a quaternary - meaning to say, he disqualifies them; but they do not go back and render others impure. As even though a tertiary creates a quaternary with consecrated foods, the impurity of one who immersed that day is not so stringent as to render impure to [the point that it reach] the quaternary. But if one who immersed that day touched non-sacred foods, behold they are pure - as a secondary does not create a tertiary with non-sacred foods. So have we received the things from our Sages, may their memory be blessed (Sotah 29a). And behold it is elucidated from this that neither a tertiary impurity in the priestly tithe, nor a quaternary impurity in consecrated foods, renders another drink or another food impure. And it is not necessary to say that they do not render vessels impure - since a man and vessels only acquire impurity from a primary source of impurity. And all that render impure - whether stringent or whether light - the law of liquids that come out of them, such as their spit or their urine, is like that of liquids that they touched. And the rest of its details are in Tractate Tevul Yom (see Mishneh Torah, Laws of Admission into the Sanctuary). ",

But if this order is changed - for example that she first became a licentious woman, etc. - we are only liable for  one [set of] lashes for her intercourse; as this is not a supplementary prohibition.

Therefore it is fitting for the highest servant to cling to a woman who has never fixed her thought towards another man besides him who is Holy of Holies. And through that, the seed that God, may He be blessed, gives him from her will be pure and clean; fitting to serve in holiness.  And lest you say, \"And who knows if the virgin has also fixed her thought towards a man besides him and set her eyes on another,\" the answer to this is that for as long as the thought has not gone from the potential to the actual, she is not disqualified. But anytime she had intercourse with him, she is disqualified. And even though they, may their memory be blessed, said (Yevamot 59a) that when she becomes an adult, she is prohibited to him, the matter is that once she has matured so much, the thought of her impulse is only evil; and perhaps she fixed her thought towards another. And from when she is an adult, her evil thought counts as an act. And so [too,] from this reason did they say (Yevamot 59a) that if she was widowed from betrothal - even as a minor - she is forbidden to the [high] priest. As from when the act of designation (<i>kiddushin</i>) was done with her, she already fixed her thought towards another man via the act of betrothal and was [so] disqualified - as an act disqualifies even with minors, and thought [does] with adults.

And so [too,] they said (Yevamot 59a) that even [if she is one] struck by wood (on her hymen), she is disqualified. And the reason with her is apparently that she will not fix her thought greatly on the high priest. As once she lost her virginity, she does not cut (form) a strong covenant with a man ever. And [this is] similar to that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Sanhedrin 22b) that a woman only cuts a covenant with one who 'makes her a vessel' - and behold, this one did not 'make her a vessel.'

And therefore, they, may their memory be blessed, explained (Kiddushin 77a), that the repetition of this warning of \"a divorcee and a profaned woman, a licentious woman\" with a high priest comes to teach us this matter: And they said in the Gemara in Kiddushin that it comes to teach that at a time that it happens that all of these prohibitions happen with one woman in this order - that at first, she is widowed; and afterwards she divorces; and afterwards she is profaned; and afterwards she becomes a licentious woman - and the high priest has intercourse with her, he is liable four [sets] of lashes for one intercourse. And this is when he was warned about [the] four negative commandments. And if a common priest had intercourse with her, he will be lashed three [sets].

And [just] like we administer lashes for the divorcee on her own, so do we administer lashes for the profaned woman and for the licentious woman on her own. And they said there, \"In the same way that a divorcee and a profaned woman and a licentious woman [are] divided [into separate negative commandments] with a common priest, so too [are they] divided with a high priest.\" And to teach these things was the prevention repeated with a high priest, as we said.",

As [the Torah] was certainly not more stringent with the common [priest] than with the high. And [it is] as they elucidated it there in Kiddushin, \"If he had intercourse, he is lashed; if he did not have intercourse, he is not lashed.\" And they said that this law is also with a common priest - that he is not liable for the women forbidden him until he first designates [her] and afterwards has intercourse. But if he had intercourse with a licentious woman or a divorcee or a profaned woman without dedication - even though it is forbidden to him and he becomes disqualified for the priesthood - he is not lashed; since the prevention is not elucidated about this explicitly - as \"he shall not profane,\" is written in the section of the high priest and specifically about a widow. But with with a licentious woman or a divorcee or a profaned woman, the high priest is only lashed one [set] for them when he marries them and afterwards has intercourse with them; however if he has intercourse with them without dedication - even though it is forbidden and he becomes disqualified for the priesthood - he does not have a liability for lashes for this. Rather, his law is exactly like the law of the common priest. As specifically regarding the widow is it that a negative commandment was designated for the high priest, to make him liable for \"he shall not profane\" - meaning for intercourse without designation, as we said - but not with the three others. As the three others were only repeated with a high priest for that matter that we said above (Sefer HaChinukh 273), to divide - meaning to say to make liable for each and every one [on its own]. And there is still another reason in the matter: That with a widow, there is a profaning in the intercourse. As she was fitting for common [priests], and she became disqualified with the intercourse. And hence he should be made liable for her, and on account of \"he shall not profane.\" But with the other three, we should not make him liable for lashes because of intercourse without designation - as behold, we cannot say, \"profane,\" about them; as behold, they are [already] profaned for a common priest before the intercourse.",

And the profaning of his seed is relevant to say when he has intercourse with a divorcee, a profaned woman [and] a licentious woman, who are profaned. And when he has intercourse with them, he does not profane them; as behold, they are [already] profaned. [Rather] it is his seed that he profanes, as his seed is in a place of profanation. And it is relevant to say profaning of the woman when he has intercourse with a widow, as she is still fitting to a common priest. And with this intercourse of the high priest, she is made a licentious woman; and behold, he profaned her from her being fit. And there is no doubt that the seed is also profaned, as the seed is also profaned in her automatically. But the distinction that there is between the profaning with her and the profaning of the seed is that she is profaned with insertion, but the seed [is only profaned] from the completion of intercourse - as it is [found] in the Gemara (Kiddushin 78a).

There are some blemishes that disqualify a priest from serving, and if they are in a beast, they disqualify it from being offered. And there are some other blemishes that only disqualify a person from the service, but do not disqualify a beast from being offered. And there are some blemishes that disqualify neither man nor beast, and [our concern] is because of [their] appearance. Any priest that has any of these three types of blemishes may not serve. Only revealed blemishes that are revealed (external) disqualify a person, but blemishes that are inside of his body, such as a removed kidney or spleen, or a punctured intestine - even though they render him a <i>treifah</i> (terminally ill) - his service is still fit. As it is stated (Leviticus 21:9), \"a broken leg or a broken hand\" - just as those are revealed, so too must all disqualifying blemishes be revealed. The Sages enumerated (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Admission into the Sanctuary 7-8) that the blemishes that disqualify both people and beast are fifty, besides the blemishes that are unique to beasts and they are twenty-three; and [so] it comes out that there are seventy-three in beasts. And there are also blemishes that are unique to people and they are ninety; and [so] it comes out that the blemishes in people are one hundred and forty. This is the grouping of the ninety that are unique to people: there are eight in the head; two in the neck; four in the ears; five in the  eyebrows; four in the eyelids; eleven in the eyes; six in the nose; three in the lips; three in the belly; three in a man's back; six in the hands; four in the genital organs; fifteen in the thighs and legs; four over the entire body; eight in the skin of the flesh. And there are also four more big blemishes in people and they are not external, and these are them: a deaf[-mute]; one mentally incapacitated; an epileptic, even if [only on certain] days; and one who is bewildered by an evil spirit, even [only] at set times.

As it is stated, 'And they shall not profane the consecrated things of the Children of Israel that they shall raise to the Lord' - the verse is speaking about those that will be raised in the future; such that we learn [a comparison of] 'profane' [and] 'profane' from priestly tithe,\" about which it is written (Numbers 18:32), \"and the consecrated things of the Children of Israel you shall not profane and not die.\" And [the latter] is with the death penalty - as we wrote above (Sefer HaChinukh 280), from that which is written (Leviticus 22:9), \"and die for it, since they profaned it,\" and adjacent to it, \"And any foreigner shall not eat the holy.\" And they, may their memory be blessed, also said about this matter in the Gemara Makkot 16b, \"Perhaps one is only liable for eating <i>tevel</i> from which no [gifts] were taken at all; but if the great priestly tithe was taken from [the produce], but not the tithe of the tithe, or the first tithe or the second tithe, or even if only the poor tithe [was not separated]; from where [is it derived] that there is a liability in the thing? [Hence] we learn to say, 'You may not eat in your gates' (Deuteronomy 12:17), and later it states, 'and they shall eat within your gates and be satisfied' (Deuteronomy 26:12). Just as there, it is poor tithe, here too, it is poor tithe - and the [Torah] states, 'You may not.'\" ",
                "However this liability is for lashes, but the iniquity [punishable by] death is only for <i>tevel</i> that has not had the great priestly tithe taken from it; and likewise for one who eats tithe before the priestly tithe of the tithe has been taken from it. And this is what is stated in the commandment to the Levites when it commanded to take out the tithe from the tithe (Numbers 18:32), \"and the consecrated things of the Children of Israel you shall not profane and you shall not die.\" That is a prevention that they should not eat the first tithe in its mixture [with gifts that still need to be separated]. So did they, may their memory be blessed, explain (Yevamot 86a). And therefore they are liable for death for it, as it is elucidated in Tractate Dammai. It comes out from the sum of our words that one who eats <i>tevel</i> before he takes the great priestly tithe from it - and likewise before he took the priestly tithe from the tithe - is with death. But if he ate from it after the great priestly tithe was taken from it, and also the priestly tithe of the tithe was taken - for example that he preceded to take the priestly tithe of the tithe before the tithe, even though it is still mixed with the two tithes, which are the first tithe and the second tithe, or poor tithe; he is not liable for death, but rather he has a liability for lashes. And so [too,] the whole time when it is mixed [with] one of the tithes, it is with lashes. And its warning is from, \"You may not eat in your gates, etc.,\" as we will write in the Order of Re'eh Anochi (Sefer HaChinukh 473-4). And hold on to this matter, as you will find the truth to be like this if you merit to study the words of our Sages - the masters of the tradition - may their memory be blessed.",
                "That which I have written above close by in the negative commandment of an impure priest with priestly tithe (Sefer HaChinukh 279) is from the roots of the commandment.",
                "From the laws of the commandment is that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Avodah Zarah 73a) about the prohibition of <i>tevel</i> that it forbids its mixture with the smallest amount - which is not the case with other prohibitions in the Torah besides idolatrous wine and chamets on Pesach, as I have written in its place (Sefer HaChinukh 111). And they gave a reason with <i>tevel</i> - [it is] because its prohibition is like its permissibility with the smallest amount: As they, may their memory be blessed, said that priestly tithe does not have a measure from Torah writ, but rather even one [grain] of wheat exempts a large threshing floor of wheat. [And so], even its prohibition is like this, with the smallest amount. And it comes out that if a little <i>tevel</i> got mixed in several of the non-holy [produce], they are all forbidden. And in the Order of Seeds in Tractate Terumot and Maaser Sheni and Maaserot, it is elucidated which thing is liable for priestly tithe and [other] tithes - and they make [other] fruits <i>tevel</i> - and which thing is exempt; which is liable from Torah writ and which is from the words of [the Rabbis]. And the rest of the statutes of <i>tevel</i> are there and in Tractate Dammai (see Tur, Yoreh Deah 331).",
                "And this prohibition of <i>tevel</i> is practiced by all of Israel, by males and females - and even priests and Levites (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Tithes 1:3), even though that they are the ones who eat the priestly tithes, and even with their [own] grain. And so [too,] is this prohibition practiced in every place - meaning to say that it is forbidden to eat <i>tevel</i> of the fruits of the Land of Israel in every place. But [regarding] the obligation of priestly tithes and [other] tithes from the fruits, it is well-known, that the Torah only obligated us about them in the Land of Israel, and at the time that Israel is there, as it is stated with the priestly tithe (Numbers 15:2), \"in your coming.\" And they, may their memory be blessed, expounded (Ketuvot 25a), \"'The coming' of all of you, and not the coming of some of you.\" And so did Rambam, may his memory be blessed, determine (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Heave Offerings 1:26). And therefore there is only a prohibition of <i>tevel</i> from Torah writ on the fruits of the Land of Israel - and specifically with the grain, the wine and the oil, as we will write in the commandment of tithing in the Order of Vayikach Korach (Sefer HaChinuch 395).",
                "And I have already written some of the differences of the places surrounding the Land of Israel concerning the seventh [year] in the Order of Eem Kesef Talveh. And I will still write at length [about] the whole matter of priestly tithes and [other] tithes and the distinctions of the places and that which is from Torah writ and what is rabbinic in the Order of Shoftim in the commandment of the separation of the great priestly tithe (Sefer HaChinukh 507) - take it from there. And I will also inform you there of a disagreement among the commentators regarding whether the priestly tithe is from Torah writ or rabbinic today even in the Land. And [regarding] one who is in a place about which he is in doubt if it is from the Land of Israel or not, at the time when the land is in its inhabitation - it is fitting for him to be stringent nonetheless, since it is prohibition from Torah writ; and it is established for us that [in the case of] a doubt in Torah law, [we go] towards stringency (Beitzah 3b). And from that which it appears, the Sages, may their memory be blessed, were stringent (Chullin 6b) in the places about which they were in doubt if they were from the Land of Israel, even about the fruits the tithing obligation of which was only rabbinic - even after the destruction of the Temple, even though this prohibition is only practiced [altogether] from Torah writ [when the Temple is standing]. And one who transgresses this and ate a <i>kazayit</i> of <i>tevel</i> before they separated the great priestly tithe from it - and likewise before they separated the priestly tithe of the tithe - is liable for death by the hands of the Heavens, and as we said above. But if he ate a <i>kazayit</i> of <i>tevel</i> from which the great priestly tithe and the priestly tithe of the tithe were taken, but they still did not separate the tithes from it - and even if only the poor tithe remained in it - he is liable for lashes. And if it was <i>tevel</i> from their words - meaning something  that the obligation of priestly tithes and [other] tithes from which is only rabbinic, such as all the fruits besides grain, wine and [olive] oil of the Land of Israel and at the time of the Temple - we strike him with lashes of rebellion. And the liquids that come out of the fruits that are <i>tevel</i> are forbidden like them. And nonetheless even though they are are forbidden from Torah writ, the liability for lashes is not on the liquids but only only on the body of the fruits - except for wine and [olive] oil, such that we administer lashes for them in the same way that we administer lashes for the olives and grapes [themselves]. And the reason, according to that which appears, is because the essence of those fruits for the creatures is for [their] liquids."

And even though His providence over the human species is individual - and as I explained earlier in the Order of Eesha ki Tazria (Sefer HaChinukh, 169) - this is not the case for other species of animals. Rather His providence, blessed be He, is for the species as a whole. And we are therefore prevented from finishing 'the tree and its branches' together to hint [about] this.  And we can also say about the matter from the angle of the simple understanding as well, that this is to fix in our souls the trait of compassion and to distance us from the trait of cruelty - which is a bad trait. And therefore even though God permitted us [to eat] species of animals for our sustenance, He [also] commanded us that we not kill it and its child on one day to fix the trait of compassion in our souls.",
                "The laws of the commandment: That which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Chullin 82a) that there is no distinction between it and its child and its child and it (the order is not important). And that which they said (Chullin 83a) that at four periods during the year, one who sells a beast to his fellow must inform him, \"I sold the mother for slaughter\" - because at these four times, all purchasers presumably buy to slaughter [immediately]. And these are them: the eve of the last holiday of [Sukkot]; the eve of the first holiday of Pesach; the eve of [Shavuot]; and the eve of Rosh HaShanah. And according to the words of Rabbi Yose HaGalili, also on the eve of Yom Kippur in the Galilee. And behold, that which we learned that he needs to inform him - it is specifically the seller that has to inform [of] the thing. But the buyer need not ask, as it is a double doubt for him: Lest it does not have a mother; and [even] if it does, perhaps [the seller] did not sell it for slaughter. And that which they said (Chullin 82a) [regarding] two people that bought a cow and its child - that the one who purchased first, slaughters first; but if the second preceded him and slaughtered against the law, the first is forbidden to slaughter. And the law of slaughtering a cow and two of her children, or her two children and her afterwards; and so [too,] it and her daughter and the daughter of her daughter. And it is permitted to slaughter the mother and the daughter of her daughter, as the Torah only forbade \"it and its child.\"",
                "And that which they said that if one slaughters the mother and the daughter of her daughter, and then the daughter, he is only lashed forty [lashes]. And [that is] even though he transgresses two negative commandments on account of \"it and its child\" and on account of 'its child and it' - nonetheless it is [still] one deed.",
                "And that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Chullin 78b) that the prohibition of \"it and its child\" is only practiced with females (mothers) - as they said in explanation of \"its child,\" the one who the child is attached to, which is the [mother]. And nevertheless, we conclude in Chullin 79a - with the good commentaries - that if the thing becomes clear to us that this is certainly its father, we [may] not slaughter it and its child on the same day; because we determine there that the law [follows] Rabbi Yehudah. And according to what is implied from his words, Rabbi Yehudah is in doubt if we concern ourselves with the seed of the father or not - [as] he says regarding the forbidden mixtures with mules [that] we do not mate a horse nor a donkey with it, but only its [own] specie. And if he reasoned that we certainly do not concern ourselves with the seed of the father, he would not have said that. Rather, he would have had to say thus: \"We only mate it [with] it specie from the side of the mother.\" But rather Rabbi Yehudah is certainly in doubt. And when he said [that] we do not concern ourselves with the seed of the father, his intention was to say that we do not concern ourselves with the seed of the father to be lenient about a thing; but to be stringent, we definitely concern ourselves with the seed of the father. And [likewise,] in any place that a stringency will result from saying that we are not concerned, then we say that we are not concerned for [the father]. As since it was a doubt for him, we go towards stringency in every case. And according to this, when we definitively know the [identity of the father] we should be concerned for him regarding \"it and its child.\" And the rest of its details are in the eighth chapter of Chullin (see Tur, Yoreh Deah 16).",

                "<b>That we not do anything through which the name of the Heavens is profaned among people:</b> That we were prevented from profanation of God, may He be blessed, and that is the opposite of that sanctification of God about which we are commanded - as we will write in the commandment after this - as it is stated (Leviticus 22:32), \"And you shall not profane My holy Name.\" The transcriber wrote in the name of Rambam (Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Lo Taase 63) \"This iniquity is divided into three parts - two are upon the collective, and one on the individual. The first collective part [is] in any case that one is asked to transgress one of the commandments during a time of persecution, and the enforcer intends for [him] to transgress - whether from the light commandments or from the weighty - or if one is asked to transgress idolatry, sexual immorality, or murder even not during a  a time of persecution; he is obligated to give his life and be killed rather than transgressing. And if he transgressed and was not killed, he has already profaned God in public and has violated its stating, 'And you shall not profane My holy Name,' and his sin is very giant. However he is not lashed, as he was coerced - since the court only has the ability [to give out] lashes or death for volitional [acts], with desire, with witnesses and with a warning.  The language of Sifra Kedoshim, Section 4:13 about one who gives from his seed to Molech, [that] I will place 'My face against that person' (Leviticus 20:5), is that they, may their memory be blessed, said '\"That\" one, and not coercion, nor inadvertent, nor mistaken.' It has already been elucidated to you that a person who worships idolatry under coercion  is not liable for excision, and all the more so, death of the court. However, he has violated profanation of the Name.",
                "The second collective part is when a person commits a sin without desire for it or pleasure; but [rather] with his action, he intends to anger [God].  This is also profaning the Name of the Heavens and he is lashed. And therefore it stated (Leviticus 19:12), 'And you shall not swear falsely in My name and profane the Name of your God.' As this one displays the causation of anger with this thing, since there is no physical pleasure in it. And the part which is upon the individual is when a person who is famous for acts of kindness and good deeds commits an act which appears to the public as a sin, such that this act is unfitting for a pious person like this to do - even if it is a permissible act, he has profaned the Name. And this is [the understanding of] their, may their memory be blessed, saying  (Yoma 86a), 'How  is profaning the Name? [...] \"Such as if I purchase meat from the butcher and do not give him money immediately.\" [...] Rabbi x said, \"Such as if I walk four ells without tefillin and without words of Torah.\"' And this negative commandment is already repeated elsewhere and it is stated (Leviticus 18:21), 'and you shall not profane the Name of your God, I am the Lord.'\" To here [are his words.]",
                "I will write the root of this commandment and some of its laws and all of its content - as is my custom - in the commandment of sanctification of the Name, which is adjacent."

                "<b>The commandment of sanctification of the Name:</b> That we were commanded to sanctify the Name, as it is stated (Leviticus 22:32), \"and I will be sanctified in the midst of the Children of Israel,\" - meaning to say that we surrender our souls for the observance of the commandments of the religion. And they, may their memory be blessed, have already elucidated from the tradition and from the verses in which manner and for which commandment, we are commanded about this.  And even though it is written in the Torah, \"and live by them\" (Leviticus 18:5), which implies, and not that you should die by them - they already received that this verse is not stated in every matter and for every sin. And [it is] through the tradition that we live in all [the] words of the Torah. And in explanation, they, may their memory be blessed, said (Sanhedrin 74a) that there are three commandments which one is always obligated to be killed and not transgress them. And these are: idolatry and any of its trappings - meaning, all of its matters that are prohibited on the strength of its specific negative commandments, as we will explain below with God's help; and also, sexual immorality and all of its trappings; and murder. Such that if they say to a person, \"Worship idolatry or we will kill you,\" he should be killed and not worship. Even though his heart is pure in his faith with the fear of God, nonetheless he is commanded that he be killed and not commit this evil act, and not give room to the assailant to think that he has denied God. And the language of Sifra, Emor, Chapter 9:6, \"For this reason I took you out of the Land of Egypt, so that you will publicly sanctify My name.\"  And likewise for the other two that we mentioned - he must be killed and not transgress, as we said.",
                "The root of this commandment is well-known. As Man was only created to serve his Creator. And one who does not sacrifice his body in the service of his master is not a good servant. And behold [since] people do give their souls for their masters, all the more so [should we] for the commandment of the King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He.",
                "From the laws of the commandment is that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Sanhedrin 74a) that for these three sins that we mentioned, a person is obligated to give his life under any circumstance - whether at a time of persecution or not at a time of persecution, whether in public or even in private, whether the gentile intends to have him transgress or even for his own benefit. For other sins, however, they said if it is not at a time of persecution and it is in private he should transgress and not be killed - and even if the gentile intends to have him transgress. But if it is in public - meaning, in the presence of ten Jews - if the coercer intends [it] for his [own] benefit, he should transgress and not be killed. However, if it is to have him transgress, he should be killed and not transgress. At a time of persecution, even in private and even for his benefit and even for a trivial commandment, he should be killed and not transgress. And a light commandment  is similar to what they, may their memory be blessed, said (Sanhedrin 74b), \"Even a shoe strap,\" such that an Israelite should not make the shape of his shoe like the gentiles that worship idolatry, that he should not appear to be an idolater like them. ",
                "That which we said, the trappings of idolatry, the matter is to say, anything that is prohibited for us from any prohibition specific to idolatry. And [it is] similar to that which they, may their memory be blessed, said in [Pesachim 25a], \"One who is in peril may be healed by anything except for <i>asheirah</i> (a tree-god) wood.\"  And they said about this in Yerushalmi Shabbat 14:4 [that] it is not only if the physician said, \"Bring me leaves of <i>asheirah</i> x,\" that he would [then] seem like he concedes to it. Rather even if he just said to him, \"Bring me leaves of  tree x,\" and he went and he only found [them] on the <i>asheirah</i>, he should be killed and not transgress. And even though when he is healed with the wood of the <i>asheirah</i>, it is not truly idolatry - for he did not worship it - nonetheless he benefited from it, and there is in it the matter of the negative commandment of \"Nothing is to cling to your hand from the anathema\" (Deuteronomy 13:18), which is a negative commandment specific to idolatry. But the many prohibitions of idolatry that exist, which we learn from the negative commandment of \"in front of the blind you shall not place a stumbling block\" (Leviticus 19:14), are not included in trappings of idolatry to be killed for them - since the negative commandment of \"in front of the blind,\" is not specific to idolatry itself, as it is also with all of the [other] commandments.",
                "After I wrote this I found in some of the novellae of my master - may God protect him - that he wrote that it is implied in the Yerushalmi Avodah Zarah 2:2 [about] anything that the physician says generally (without mentioning the idol), [that] he should transgress and not be killed.",
                "The matter of murder, they, may their memory be blessed, learned by way of reasoning (Sanhedrin 74a); and they said by way of a metaphor, \"What do you see that your blood is redder? Perhaps the blood of that man is redder.\" [That is] meaning, the murdered might be fitting to perform more commandments than the one that killed him. And therefore it is not right that anyone kill his fellow, even if he will be killed for [not doing so]. And they may their memory be blessed, said further (Yerushalmi Terumot 8:4) that even if there were several thousand Israelites and the coercers said to them, \"Give us one of you; and if not, we will kill all of you\" - they should all be killed and not give over one soul of Israel. And [that is] only when they say \"one,\" unspecifically. But if they specified him explicitly, such that they said, \"Give us x; and if not, we will kill all of you,\" they are permitted to give him over - like the well-known matter of Sheva ben Bichri. This is also  the law with women - if the gentiles say to them, \"Give us one of you [to rape], etc.,\" as it is [found] in Tractate Terumot, the eighth chapter (Mishnah Terumot 8:12).",
                "And the Sages, may their memory be blessed, learned the matter that we are killed [rather than transgress] sexual immorality (Sanhedrin 74a), because the betrothed maiden is compared [by the Torah] to a murderer: Just as a murderer should be killed and not transgress, as we said; so too must a man be killed and not have intercourse with her. As the Torah does not tell metaphors for nothing, but only to teach a matter. They also had support from the tradition, which is an iron wall for all of their words. And the early authorities (<i>rishonim</i>) wrote that we only say a person must be killed and not transgress [about] transgressing a sin. But to not perform a commandment, he should transgress and not be killed, and not perform the commandment. And [it is] similar to what they, may their memory be blessed, said about Esther (Sanhedrin 74b), \"She was ground of the earth\" - meaning, it was similar to [a situation of] 'sit and do not act,' as behold a woman has intercourse against her will. And even if the woman assisted in the intercourse after her impulse covered her, she is not liable with this - as there is no greater coercion than this. And that which we find stories about the early pious ones that were killed even [so that they not participate in] the negation of a [positive] commandment - and similar to what they, may their memory be blessed, said (Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 20:6), \"What is to you to go out to stoning? Because I circumcised my son. What is to you to go out to hanging? Because I took the lulav\" - that was an [extra] measure of piety that they did and they saw that [their] generation needed this. And they were great sages fitting for this, to decide about this. As otherwise they would not have been permitted to give over their souls to die - as not everyone has permission to be killed for [other matters] than those that they, may their memory be blessed, obligated us about.  Moreover, [such a person] would be liable for his life (Mishneh Torah, Foundations of the Torah 5:4).",
                "I have also seen about the matter of this commandment in the books of my teacher, may God protect him, that any woman for which betrothal (<i>kiddushin</i>) is effective - such as a widow to a high priest, a divorcee or released woman to a common priest, a <i>mamzeret</i> or a <i>netinah</i> to an Israelite and an Israelitess to a <i>mamzer</i> - are not included in the sexual prohibitions, for which one must die. Still, we nonetheless do not instruct any man to have intercourse with any woman - even if she is single, we do not instruct [it]. He should instead die from the illness that has come from his lust and not have her have intercourse with him or [even] speak with her, etc. - [as we see] in  Sanhedrin 75a and the Book of Knowledge (Mishneh Torah, Foundations of the Torah 5:9). And the rest of its details are elucidated in Chapter 8 of Sanhedrin and in Pesachim and Yoma and in other places (see Tur, Yoreh Deah 157).",

And one who transgresses it and did not sanctify the Name in a circumstance where he was obligated to do so, has violated this positive commandment; besides that he has also violated the negative commandment of \"And you shall not profane My holy Name,\" and as we wrote above adjacently (Sefer HaChinukh 295). The iniquity of profaning the Name is great and very severe to the point that they, may their memory be blessed, said that repentance, Yom Kippur, and afflicitons do not have the power to atone for it, but only death - as it is [found] in the last chapter of Yoma 86a."

But I have written this other one, so that the holidays be organized in one order. But it all comes to the same thing. ",
                "And the verse stated here, \"work of labor,\" and it did not state, \"all work\" - since the needs of food for the soul were permitted to be done on the holiday; as Scripture comes in another place (Exodus 12:16), \"but that which is eaten by every soul, that alone shall be done for you.\" And this is the understanding of work of labor - meaning to say, work that is not for the needs of food for the soul, like the matter that is stated (Exodus 1:14), \"labor in the field\"; and so [too,] \"Kain was a laborer of the field\" (Genesis 4:2); \"a king over a field that is labored\" (Ecclesiastes 5:8); \"labors his land\" (Proverbs 12:11). But work that is for food for the soul like cooking and similar to it is work of enjoyment, not work of labor. So did Ramban, may his memory be blessed, explain. And he wrote further (Ramban on Leviticus 23:7) that this understanding is elucidated in the Torah [itself], since with the Festival of Matsot, [about which] it first stated, \"all work shall not be done upon them\" in the Order of Bo el Pharoah, it was required to explain, \"but that which is eaten by every soul, that alone shall be done for you.\" But with all of the other holidays, it was brief and it stated, \"all work of labor you shall not do,\" to forbid all work that is not [for] food for the soul, and to inform that food for the soul is permitted on them. And Scripture did not ever state in one of the other holidays, \"all work,\" nor explain the permissibility of food for the soul - since \"all work of labor\" teaches about this. But in the section, Kol HaBekhor on the Festival of Matsot, it states (Deuteronomy 16:8), \"and on the seventh day, it is a convocation to the Lord, your God; you shall not do work.\" And the reason is because it already explicitly permitted food for the soul on this holiday in the Order of Bo el Pharaoh. And afterwards in this Order, it mentions \"work of labor,\" which also implies the permissibility of food for the soul. And therefore, when it repeated and mentioned it another time in the section of Kol HaBekhor, it was not needed for it to state a further explanation about it; and [so] it mentioned just, \"work,\" and relied on that which is known [from the earlier entries]. And nonetheless, it did not state, \"all work,\" as [it does] with Shabbat and Yom Kippur, but [rather just] stated, \"work\" - meaning to say, the work which I have warned you about.",
                "It is from the roots of the commandment that it is so that the great miracles that God, may He be blessed, did for them and for their forefathers be remembered, and that they speak about them and inform their children and the children of their children about them. As with the rest from the business of the world, they will be free to be involved with this. As if they were permitted work - and even light work - each and every one would turn to his business. And the honor of the festival would be forgotten from 'the mouths of babes'; also from the mouths of adults. And there are also many [other] benefits to its rest: As all the people gather in the synagogues and study halls to listen to the words of the book, and the heads of the people guide them and teach them knowledge. And [it is] similar to that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Megillah 32a), \"Moshe ordained for Israel that they should expound the laws of Pesach on Pesach and the Laws of [Shavuot] on [Shavuot and the laws of the Holiday (Sukkot) on the Holiday].",
                "From the laws of the commandment is that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Beitzah 28b) that even though Scripture permitted work for the sake of food for the soul, it is specifically things that are impossible to do from the eve of the holiday, such as kneading, slaughtering, baking [and] cooking - as all of these types of work become a little defective from delay [after them]. And likewise for this reason, they permitted to pound spices on the holiday, on account that their taste becomes fainter with delay after they are pounded.  But it is forbidden to do types of work on the holiday that are possible to do from the eve of the holiday and do not deteriorate at all - such as harvesting, threshing, separating, grinding, sifting and what is similar to them; and they are not included in the needs of food for the soul at all. And we administer lashes for them like [for] plowing in the field - which is actually a work of labor. And the later commentators elucidated this matter further and said that truly that which is called the need of food for the soul is only that which is made for its day - meaning to say, for a short time, like cooking and baking and what is similar to it, as we have said - and also [only] that which a person's mind relies upon to make for that time. [This is] to exclude hunting, as the mind of a man is not upon it, since perhaps game will not appear to him today. And they said further that that which we permit food for the soul with that which is made for that time - as we said - is only if he uses the body of the work. But if he uses the removal of the work, it is forbidden. And this is [the understanding of] that which they, may their memory be blessed, forbade (Beitzah 22a) to extinguish the log, even though his mind in extinguishing it is so that [the stew in] the pot not get smoky. And regarding the roasting of meat over coals - which is the <i>bisra agumrei</i> mentioned in the Gemara (Beitzah 23a) - even though the fire is extinguished from the [liquids] of the meat, this is not called using the removal of the work, since it is for the needs of the roasting to do this. And [so] he is using the body of the work and it is permissible.",
                "And so [too,] that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Beitzah 12a) that included in the dispensation of the needs of food for the soul is not specifically food and drink only. Rather, even every thing that a person needs on the day: [Something] which is a matter of a commandment, such as to circumcise an infant, and a lulav to fulfill [the commandment] with it, and a Torah scroll to read from it - as each and every day is the time for Torah; or whether it is not a matter of a commandment but a need of the body on that day, such as the washing of the feet with hot water that was heated on the holiday or to make a fire to warm oneself with it. All of these things are permitted and included in the dispensation of food for the soul. So did our Sages, may their memory be blessed, explain (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Rest on a Holiday 1:16).",
                "And nonetheless it is specifically [regarding] things that are the same for all people's bodies that we permit and we say that it is included in this dispensation of food for the soul - such as washing the feet, as everyone washes like this sometimes. But that which is not the same for every person, such as <i>mugmar</i> (a type of incense) - since not all people burn <i>mugmar</i>, as we say in Ketuvot 7a - is certainly forbidden [along with] all that is similar to it. And it is only in these things that we need that it be the same for every person. However regarding eating, every person is permitted to make even a food that is not its way to be made except by kings and great ministers - since the basic concept of eating is something that is the same for every soul. And so [too,] that which they said (Beitzah 2b) about the prohibition of preparation, that a holiday cannot prepare for Shabbat, nor a Shabbat prepare for a holiday. And you will only find a prohibition of preparation from Torah writ in my opinion - if you have studied the words of the Gemara well - with an egg alone. And its main prohibition is when it was born on a holiday after Shabbat or on a Shabbat after a holiday. In this way is the preparation of Rabbah established with an egg, and with this is there a Torah prohibition - and in no other way. As behold, that which we prohibit when it is born on Shabbat on the holiday that is after it, and so [too,] when it is born on the holiday on the Shabbat that is after it, and so [too,] when it it is born on the holiday [on the holiday] itself is [only] a rabbinic prohibition - and it is all on account of a decree [to make a fence for] the one that is born on a holiday after Shabbat, as we said. And the matter would be [too] lengthy if I came to write it with a broad elucidation. And in its place at the beginning of Beitzah, I have written at length about it, as my teachers - may God protect them - have taught me.",

And so [too,] that we do not bake anything for dogs, as it is written, \"for you\" - and not for dogs. And that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Beitzah 4b) about the two days of the exiles - that an egg born on this one is permitted on that one; and that which is detached from the ground on this one is permitted on that one, as the [two days] are two [separate units of] holiness. And it is not like this on the two days of Rosh Hashanah. And the rest of its many details are all elucidated in the tractate that is built on this, and that is Tractate [Beitzah] (see Tur, Orach Chaim 495). ",

And the custom was set because at the beginning when there were ordained men in the Land, they would set the month according to sighting, which is the commandment of the Torah - as we have written there. And therefore all the places of Israel (Jewish settlement) far from the chosen place in which it was fixed there, that messengers could not reach to inform them of the day of the fixing, were in doubt about which day was fixed as the [first of the] month - whether the thirtieth [of the previous month] or the thirty-first.

And therefore whether witnesses came or did not come, they would set the new month [no later than] the thirty-first.

As it comes in the Gemara (Beitzah 4b) that at the time that the thing was a doubt, they would say this. But now since it is from an ordinance of the Sages and not at all from the status of a doubt, we should not say this. Rather their law is like one [unit of] holiness.

And also since when, \"what is born on this one is permitted on that one,\" was said in the Gemara, the fixing according to sighting [had] already ceased, according to what appears. And so have they practiced today. And all that they said is specifically about the two days of holiday of the appointed times of the year except for Rosh Hashanah - as with Rosh Hashanah, it is like one [unit of] holiness. And what is born on this one is forbidden on that one, because also in the house of council they would sometimes make it two days of holiday not from the status of a doubt - for example, if the witnesses came from the [time of] <i>mincha</i> (afternoon) and onward - such that they would treat today as holy and the next day as holy. And nonetheless even on Rosh Hashanah it is [only on account of] the ordinance of the Sages today to do two days in every place, since we are experts in the fixing of the new month (Mishneh Torah, Sanctification of the New Month 5:12).

And [it is] like God said to Moshe (Exodus 3:12), \"And this will be the sign for you that I have sent you; when you take out the people from Egypt, you shall worship God on this mountain.\" And the understanding of the verse is [that] your taking them out from Egypt is a sign for you that you shall worship God on this mountain - meaning that you shall receive the Torah, which is the great principle for which they were redeemed and it is their ultimate good. And it is a great matter for them, more than freedom from slavery. And hence God made a sign of their leaving Egypt for the receiving of the Torah; as we always make what is secondary into a sign for what is the essence. ",

As the tally shows about a man that all of his deliverance and all of his desire is to reach that time. And that which we count to the <i>omer</i>, meaning, \"Such and such days have passed from the tally,\" and we do not tally \"Such and such days do we have to the time,\" is because all of this shows us the great desire to reach the time [of Shavuot]. Therefore, we do not want to mention at the beginning of our counting the large number of days that we have to reach the offering of the two breads of [Shavuot]. And let it not be difficult for you, to say, \"If so, after most of the days of these seven weeks have passed, why do we not mention the minority of the remaining days?\" [It is] as one should not change the nature of the counting in the middle. And if you shall ask, \"If so, why do we begin counting from the day after [Pesach] and not from the first day?\" The answer [is that] it is because the first day is entirely dedicated to remembering the great miracle, which is the exodus from Egypt, that is a sign and a proof of the world having been created and of God's - may He be blessed - providence over people. And we may not mix [something else into] its joy and mention anything else with it. And as such, the counting begins immediately from the second day. And we should not say, \"Today is such and such days from the second day of Pesach\" - as the count would not be fitting to say, \"From the second day.\" And therefore it was ordained to count the tally from that which is done on it - and this is the <i>omer</i> offering, which is a significant sacrifice.

Since wheat is for the food of man - and so it is fitting to prepare it in a way that man would enjoy and be nourished from it. And all of this is from the root that we planted at the beginning of the matter of the sacrifice from the angle of the simple understanding - that through the deed is the thought of a man aroused to things (Sefer HaChinukh 95).

It is for this reason that they, may their memory be blessed, did not establish the recitation of Hallel on this appointed time.

[Thus] anytime he is called, he will remember this and pay attention to the matter. And that which they said [that] three books are opened on Rosh Hashanah, one for the completely righteous, one for the completely wicked and one for the ones in between. The substance of opening books seems to be metaphorical for the matter of His, blessed be He, providence over them. Our rabbis always spoke about the familiar, in order that the things would penetrate the ears of the listeners. The completely righteous are immediately written and sealed for life. My teacher explained that 'completely righteous' here [means] that he is totally innocent, and likewise 'completely wicked' here [means] that he is totally guilty. And therefore, he is sealed immediately for death, since he has no merit to protect him.  [The judgement of] those in between is left suspended until Yom Kippur, at which time a final verdict is sealed.  And that which they said adjacent to this, \"Beit Shammai said, 'There are three groups for the Day of Judgement\" - meaning after the death of each and every person, which is called the Day of Judgement - \"one group of the completely righteous, a group of the completely wicked, and a group of those in between.'\" Here the explanation of 'completely righteous' and 'completely wicked' is [that it is referring] to their judgement.

And the reason that the measure of eating of Yom Kippur is differentiated from the measure of eating other prohibitions in the Torah - which are with a <i>kazayit</i> - is because the Torah forbade eating on that day with an expression of affliction. And it does not state, \"you shall not eat,\" about it, like it states with other prohibitions. And the Sages explained that they received [the tradition] from those that were before them: that with a <i>kazayit</i>, it is called eating; but affliction in a man is so long as he has not eaten a <i>kakotevet</i> - since the mind of a man is not set at ease with less.",
                "And the measure of a <i>kotevet</i> (large date) is more than a  <i>grogeret</i> (fig cake) and less than a <i>kabeitzah</i> (the size of a large egg) and also less than three (textual variant - two) [large] olives (<i>zayit</i>) - as three (textual variant - two) olives are a <i>kabeitzah</i>. The principal of the matter is that one who is an expert was already exacting and measured on a scale that there is not in the measure of twelve <i>argents</i> and more, the measure of a <i>kakotevet</i>; and [so] its law is like [that of] half a measure. And so [too,] that which they said (Yoma 73a, 80b) that the measure of drinking is the fill of a man's cheek, which is a <i>kabeitzah</i> - as they have already measured that an egg fills the cheek of a man. And with less than this, there is no prohibition [the liability for which is with] excision. Rather its law is like [that of] half a measure. And therefore [in the case of] someone who is sick - even though there is no full danger with him - if he is very weak; it is fitting to feed him and give him drink little by little, less than the measure that we said. And we give a gap of [time] enough for the eating of a <i>peras</i> (half loaf of bread) - which is three eggs, according to the opinion of most commentators - between the eating and drinking of one time and [that of] another time, so that the eatings not combine and be considered one eating and [hence] one measure. But there is no need to pause between eating and drinking; as eating and drinking do not combine for this matter. And the measure between one drinking and [another] is [time] enough for the drinking of a <i>reviit</i>. And it is permitted to weigh and measure things on Yom Kippur at a time of need. And it is better that we be concerned and distance ourselves to not eat a measure and not be concerned to forbid measuring, which is [only] rabbinic. And also from the matter of the commandment is that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Yoma 77b) [regarding] these afflictions that are only rabbinic - such as washing and anointing - they only decreed that they should not be done for no need. But they did not decree [about] anyone who does them for a need - for example, one who has scabs on his head [may] anoint them in his [customary] way and not be concerned.

But anything that is not fitting for release - such as cork and reeds and palms (see Yoma 78b, that it is a shoe of grasses) and other types of grasses (plants) - are permitted on Yom Kippur, so long as they do not go out with them [to a public domain] in a place without an eruv, as we consider them like a burden (and not a piece of clothing, which is permitted).

And the principle of the the matter according to a few of the commentators is that two years before the adulthood of a healthy child, they complete [the fast] rabbinically; and two years before that, we teach them [to fast] with [some] hours. And some explained that it is one year before adulthood that they complete [the fast] rabbinically - whether a boy or a girl. And some explained that only a girl alone completes [the fast] rabbinically one year before adulthood, but a boy does not complete [the fast] at all rabbinically.

And they, may their memory be blessed, said (Rashi on Leviticus 23:36) that it is called like this because it is the end of the appointed times. And metaphorically, it is as if the Holy One, blessed be He said to Israel, \"Remain with me one day, as your departure is difficult for me.\"",
                "We have already said many times that the prohibition of work on all of the appointed times is the same. However I need to expand on the discussion here and inform you, my son, about the matter of this holiday which the Sages, may their memory be blessed, informed us (Yoma 2b), which is that it is a holiday on its own - meaning, that it is not part of the holiday of Sukkot. And even though you see all of Israel sitting in their sukkot on one of the two days of the holiday of this holiday of Shemini Atseret - it is not because it is a part of the holiday [of Sukkot]. As behold, we explicitly say in its blessings, \"the eighth day of the holiday of convocation,\" and there is no mention of the holiday of Sukkot in it at all. But because of the ordinance of the two days of the exiles, we must sit in the sukkah eight days; and seven - like the law of the Torah - will not suffice. And therefore we sit in the sukkah on the eighth day of the holiday of Sukkot. And they, may their memory be blessed, said (Sukkah 47a), \"We do sit\" in the sukkah, in order to fulfill the obligation: Since they, may their memory be blessed, obligated us to add a day for each and every appointed time, we have also added to Sukkot and made the days of [the] sukkah eight days. But nonetheless, \"we do not bless\" over the sukkah on this day; as it it is truthfully a different appointed time - since we are now experts in the fixing of the [new] moon. And it is more fitting for us to bless for the holiday of the convocation which is true than for the other which is because of the ordinance. And perhaps you will say, \"Why did they not ordain to recite a blessing for both of them - and we would say, 'on this holiday of Sukkot and holiday of the convocation' - as on Shabbat and an appointed time, we mention both of them?\" Behold, this is not [correct]. As Shabbat and an appointed time [can] both of them be as one day, but it is impossible for two appointed times to be together. And hence it is not fitting for us to recite the blessing like this. But it is fitting for us to sit in the sukkah - as sitting in the sukkah does not detract at all from the holiday of convocation; and there is in the thing, [a fulfillment of] the commandment of the ordinance of the two days of holiday of the exiles which they, may their memory be blessed, ordained on every appointed time, as we have explained above (Sefer HaChinukh 301).",
                "And I will also inform you, my son, a little of what they, may their memory be blessed, said about the matter of the intermediate days of the festival - and they are the middle days that are in Pesach and Sukkot - which they, may their memory be blessed - [found to be] forbidden in the doing of work by the Torah. However which work is forbidden on them and which is permitted did not appear explicitly in the Torah. Nonetheless, the Torah still forbade work on them, such that the Sages learned the thing from Scripture in the second chapter of Chagigah 18a. Some of them learned the thing from the verse of \"The holiday of matsot you shall guard\" (Exodus 23:15) - and that is Rabbi Yeshayah. As it was implied for him, \"You shall guard all of the days of the holiday of matsot from the doing of work\" - but not that they all be the same in the work [that is prohibited]. And Rabbi Yochanan [reasons that] it comes  from an a fortiori (<i>kal vechomer</i>) argument there from the first and seventh [days], that do not have holiness [both] before them and after them, etc.  ",
                "And there is one there that learns it from, \"all work of labor shall you not do\" (Leviticus 23:7) - and that is Rabbi Yose HaGalili. And this is how the verse is explained according to him - meaning, on the first day is it that all work of labor is forbidden besides what is needed for the food of the soul, but on the intermediate days of the festival, not all work is forbidden on it. Rather some are forbidden and some are permitted; and Scripture gave them over to the Sages [to decide]. And Rabbi Akiva learns it from, \"These are the appointed times of the Lord, holy occasions\" (Leviticus 23:4) - as he establishes it as [referring to] the intermediate days of the festival. And from that which it is written in it, \"holy occasions,\" it teaches that it is forbidden in the doing of work. And it is possible that according to him, permitted work is learned by him from (Leviticus 23:36) \"it is an <i>atseret</i> (which can also mean, a cessation)\" - meaning that the eighth day is stopped from all work, but not the other days. Or also, he learned it form [the letter] <i>hay</i> (which means, the) of \"the seventh,\" written about Pesach in the Order of Reeh Anochi (Deuteronomy 16:8), \"Six days shall you eat matsot,\" such that they, may their memory be blessed, said \"'And on the seventh day it is an <i>atseret</i>' -  the seventh is stopped from all work, but not the sixth. And which work is forbidden or permitted?  Scripture gave them over to the Sages [to decide].\" And since the matter is given over to their hand, such that the Torah only forbade what they said, they divided work according to their will and opinion. And it comes out that all work they, may their memory be blessed, forbade, is forbidden to us from Torah writ; and that which they permitted is also permitted by Torah writ. As according to the understanding expounded from Scripture, this prohibition is given over to their hand.",
                "And they said more generally that any work that if it is not done on the festival, will [result] in much deterioration is permitted to do. And this is [the meaning of] their saying (Moed Katan 2a), \"We water an irrigated field (<i>beit hashelachin</i>) on the [intermediate days of the] festival\" - meaning to say, a vegetable garden or what is similar to it which we water constantly, and it would deteriorate if we do not water it. The expression, <i>shelachin</i> is like <i>shelahin</i>, which is [known from the] usage, <i>meshalhei</i>, which is parched for water. And they, may their memory be blessed, said that when he waters it, he should not water it from a pool or from rain water; as there is much toil in the thing. [Rather], he waters it from the spring - meaning, that he channels it and waters [his field] with it. Behold  that they were a little stringent about this, that he should not toil with a great toil; since this is only done to keep his garden fresh, lest all of it or part of it will dry up. But with any work [that prevents a true] loss, or it will close to certainly deteriorate if he does not do it on the [intermediate days of the] festival - such as someone who has olives and he fears that they will deteriorate if he does not extract their oil immediately, or grapes if he does not stomp them immediately or anything that is similar to them - they were not stringent about it. And they were not concerned with great toil [in this case]. Rather, he should do all of his needs for them - without any alteration - the way that he does it on a regular workday. And they, may their memory be blessed, likewise permitted (Moed Katan 12b) to harvest a vineyard that has reached the time to be harvested during the [intermediate days of the] festival. And they also said more generally (Moed Katan 8b) about this matter that a commoner (amateur) can sew in his [usual] way, but a craftsman must [alter his stitch]. And they certainly did not say this only about sewing, but rather the law is the same for all types of work, according to what appears. And I asked my teacher if we say so about writing - that a commoner can write in his [usual way] but he did not permit it to me. Maybe because we have found explicitly that they, may their memory be blessed, forbade (Moed Katan 18b) to correct even one letter in a Torah scroll, we should be stringent about writing. ",
                "And they forbade every man (Moed Katan 12b) to not plan his work for the festival - meaning that he not purposely leave his work before the festival in a way that he will do it on the festival because he will be avialable. As the intermediate days of the festival were not established to be involved in work, but rather to rejoice in front of God; meaning to say, to gather in the study halls and to hear pleasantness of the words of the book - 'the laws of Pesach on Pesach, the laws of [Shavuot] on [Shavuot] and the laws of [Sukkot] on [Sukkot].' And the court destroys the work of anyone who plans his work for the festival and makes it ownerless for everyone [to take]. But if the one who planned his work for the festival died, they do not penalize the son after him; and they also do not prevent him from doing that work on the festival so that it not get wasted. And I [say] about this son, [An evildoer] 'Prepares but the righteous one wears.' And they, may their memory be blessed, permitted (Moed Katan 13a) anyone who has a need - meaning who does not have what to eat - to do any work. And likewise they allowed the head of a household to do any work for the sake of someone (to hire him) who does not have what to eat. And according to what appears, the understanding of 'he does not have what to eat,' is one who does not have money with which to buy his requirements - and even if he has a house and furnishings, as we do not obligate a person to sell his vessels. And the rest of the details of the distinctions of work on the festival are very many, and they are elucidated nicely in Tractate Moed Katan.",
                "And let this principle be in your hand: That the law of the [intermediate days of the] festival - as the laws of rabbinic enactments on Shabbat - are such that you cannot compare and extract one thing from [another] thing. As sometimes you will find that our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed allowed a heavy [type of] work in one matter, and sometimes they were stringent about a light one in another matter. And do not wonder about the thing, given the introduction that I wrote - that the Torah only forbade and allowed on the intermediate days of the festival that about which [the Rabbis] agreed. And likewise with the matter of rabbinic enactments on Shabbat and holidays, we find places in the Gemara where they, may their memory be blessed, upheld their words even in the place of [a] Torah law [that would be pushed aside]; and  [yet] sometimes they were lenient with them in a place where they saw that it was good to be lenient - and there is nothing empty in all of their words. And remember, my son, this principle that the laws of the festival - as the laws of rabbinic enactments on Shabbat - are such that we do not determine a thing from [another] thing. And do not be mistaken about it, as it was said by the greats of the world. And the opinion of Rambam, may his memory be blessed, (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Rest on a Holiday 7:2) is that every prohibition of work on the intermediate days of the festival is only from the words of the [Rabbis]. And the Rabbi would want to say that all of those verses that we said above, which are in the beginning of Tractate [Moed Katan], are only a memory device (<i>asmakhta</i>). But Ramban, may this memory be blessed, (Ramban on Moed Katan and Ramban on Leviticus 23:7) - and many with him - said the essence of the prohibition of work on it is from the Torah, as we have written; but the specific [types of] work and their distinctions were given over to the Sages, may their memory be blessed."

                "From the roots of the commandment, [there is a need to] preface [that] I have already written to you several times in what preceded, my son - that a man is impacted according to his actions that he constantly does; and his thoughts and pursuits are all caught according to the deeds of his hands, whether good or bad. And therefore since the Omnipresent wanted to give merit to His people Israel which he chose, He multiplied the commandments; such that their spirits constantly be effected by them for the good, all of the day. And among the commandments that He commanded us to grab our thoughts with His service in purity, is the commandment of tefillin - that they should lay across from the limbs of a man that are well-known as the dwelling place of the intellect. And [these limbs] are the heart and the brain. And from this constant action of his, he will dedicate all of his thoughts to the good, and always remember and be careful to calibrate all of his deeds in righteousness and justice.",
                "And so too from this root is the commandment of the lulav with its three [other plants]. As the days of the holiday are days of great joy for Israel, since it is the time of the gathering of the grain and the fruit of the tree into the home; and all men rejoice a great rejoicing. And for this reason is it is called the holiday of the gathering (<i>haasif</i>). And God commanded His people to make a holiday in front of Him at that time to give them merit, such that the main joy will be for His sake, may He be blessed. And since joy greatly elicits the physical and makes one forget the fear of God, God commanded us at that time to take in our hands things that remind us that all the joy of our heart is for His sake and His honor. And it was from His will that the reminder be from that which brings joy, just as the time is a time of joy - as all of the words of His mouth are just. And it is well-known that it is the nature of all of these four species to gladden the heart of those that see them. ",
                "And there is also another matter with these four things - that they are similar to precious limbs in a man (see Vayikra Rabbah 30:14; Midrash Tanchuma, Emor 19): As the citron is similar to the heart, which is the dwelling place of the intellect, to hint that he should serve His creator with his intellect; the lulav is similar to the backbone, which is the essence of a person, to hint that he should straighten himself completely for His service, blessed be He; the myrtle [leaves are] similar to the eyes, to hint that he should not stray after his eyes 'on the day of the rejoicing of his heart'; and the willow [leaves are] similar to the lips, with which a man completes all of his acts of speech, to hint that he should put a muzzle to his mouth, calibrate his words and fear God, may He be blessed, even at a time of joy. And the reason that it is only practiced one day in the country (outside of the Temple) is well-known - since the main joy is on the first day. And if you should ask, \"Why would one not take it on Shemini Atseret, which has great joy on it for Israel\" - the answer is that the day of Shemini Atseret is completely for God, may He be blessed. And [it is] as they, may their memory be blessed, said (Bemidbar Rabbah 21:22; Midrash HaGadol, Shemot 29:36), \"A parable of a king who made a feast, etc.,\" as it is [found] in the Midrash. And at the end, He said to them, \"Remain with me one day, as your departure is difficult for me.\" And therefore, it is called <i>atseret</i> (a stopping). And if so, there is no need for any other reminder. And the holiday of Pesach does not require another reminder with the lulav, as behold the matsa and <i>marror</i> and the body of the Pesach sacrifice are between his hands; and further since it is not a time of joy as [much as is] the holiday of the gathering. And the holiday of Shavuot also does not require another reminder, since the essence of [that] festival is only from the angle of the giving of our Torah - and that is the great reminder to straighten our ways. And this is what appears to me in these matters from the side of the simple understanding. And I have come to believe that the kabbalists (mystics) have wonderful secrets about the commandment of the lulav and the three [other plants].",
                "From the laws of the commandment is that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Menachot 27a) that these four species are one commandment and impede one another when he does not have [one of them]. But if he has [all of them] and he takes them one after another, he has fulfilled [the commandment]; as it is established for us that the lulav does not need a binding (Tosafot  on Menachot 27a, s.v. <i>lo shanu</i>, in the name of Bahag). And we take one lulav, two sprigs of willow, and three sprigs of fit myrtle - meaning that its leaves are formed in threes on the nodes, as is explained in the Gemara (Sukkah 32b), and the verse hints to this when it calls it \"braided.\" And the minimum measure of the length of a lulav is four handbreadths; and [of] a myrtle and a willow is three handbreadths, which is [the span of] ten fingers of the thumb. And the measure of the citron is that it cannot be less than a <i>kabeitsah</i> (like a large egg). And the law of the things that disqualify (Sukkah 29, 34) the lulav, the citron, the willow and the myrtle; the law (Bava Batra 137b) of partners that have purchased a citron in partnership - or brothers that acquired it from the contents of a house - such that if they acquired it with the intention to fulfill [the commandment] with it, each one of them fulfills [it] and they do not need the acquisition of the one from the other.

They have known it, but did not want to give it over to every person. And even though their secret was not revealed to us, we have paid heed to this thing - that the span of sevens is arranged in many of our commandments: Behold, we continue our work six days, and we rest on the seventh; we work the land six years, and we rest on the seventh; after seven cycles of seven years, we also rest a year - and that is the Jubilee that we have come [to write] about [here]; behold the holiday of Pesach is seven days, and likewise the holiday of Sukkot is seven, and after the seven, we celebrate [Shemini] Atseret; likewise, we count seven seven-year cycles from Pesach to [Shavuot], and after the tally of the seven, we celebrate [Shavuot]; likewise the cutting of a covenant (treaty), which is something done for preservation of a matter, is on the basis of seven, as it is written (Genesis 21:30), \"Rather take these seven sheep from my hand\"; likewise Bilaam, who was a wise man, made seven altars; so too, some of the sages said that the word, oath (<i>shevuah</i>) - which is translated [into Aramaic] as preservation - is derived from the expression, seven (<i>shevah</i>); and so [too,] many that I have not raised now on the tip of my pen.

But in a place where the buyer is not allowed to place his vessel, his vessels will not (it does not) acquire for him there - such as  the public domain or the seller's property. Nevertheless the Sages said regarding the seller's domain that if the seller says to him, \"Acquire with this vessel\" - or even if he doesn't say it, but the buyer acquired another vessel from him in the domain of the seller by lifting it, and afterwards acquired fruits from him and placed them into the vessel - he has immediately acquired them.

And acquisition by giving over is for that which is not the way of people to lift them, nor to even drag them, because of their great size - such as large ships and that which is similar to them that are impossible for people to move without much strain and many people (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Sales 3:3).",
                "But dragging is not like this, as dragging only acquires in an alley - which is a place adjacent to the side of the public domain - where it is the way of people to leave their vessels there. [Any] vessels left in such a place may not be moved by [another person]. And dragging also acquires in a yard that [belongs] (does not belong) to both of them. But lifting acquires in all places; since he is lifting it with his body, and so (and with it), he acquires - because his body is his domain in all places that it is [present].",
                "And there is yet another [method of] acquisition of lands and movable items on a Torah level, and that is exchange. And this acquisition was formerly common in Israel. And this matter of exchange is that a man trades his beast for his fellow's beast, or one vessel for another vessel, or vessels for land. And the Sages said about all of these (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Sales 5:5) that once the first dragged the object from his fellow; his fellow possessed the other object that he wanted to acquire from him, wherever it may be. And if anything happens that destroys the object, the loss is [absorbed by the purchaser]. And the law of acquisition by exchange is only with vessels, but not with produce; as produce cannot be used for exchange (Bava Batra 47a). As behold, we found explicitly in that verse from which we learned [about] exchange, that it is with a vessel (Ruth 4:7) - \"And this was formerly common in Israel, a man would remove his shoe,\" meaning his glove, and this is a vessel. And nevertheless, even though produce cannot be the medium of barter, with which to acquire, produce can be acquired through barter like a vessel; i.e., a person can use a vessel to acquire produce through barter - such that he he give a vessel to his fellow, and possess the produce of his fellow wherever it may be. The same is not true of coins, which can neither be bartered with nor be acquired with barter - because the mind of people is always on the imprint, and the imprint may be cancelled by the will of the king or the great ones of the states. And people do not rely upon that which is not a firm thing, to acquire with. And so it cannot be acquired in barter, nor used for barter. But a coin the value of which is not because of its imprint is acquired in barter and can be used for barter, like all other movable items. And which one is that? That is a coin that was cancelled by the monrachy - and as Reish Lakish said in the chapter [entitled] HaZahav (Bava Metzia 46b), \"Even a purse filled with coins\" and \"Rabbi Abba translated it as <i>anka</i> dinars and <i>anigera</i> - dinars. One is that the kingdom invalidated and one is that the province invalidated.\"   ",
                "When we said that it is not used as barter nor bartered for, the intention was not that the one who bought produce from his fellow for such and such money, is not obligated to pay him the money; for he is certainly obligated to pay him his money once he dragged the produce. Rather the matter is that it is not made into barter. As one who has a bag of coins that are not invalidated, as we said, and his fellow dragged vessels or a beast or produce and said to this fellow, \"Behold, I am pulling this produce in exchange for that bag of coins that I have at home which has a hundred dinar\" - his fellow does not possess those dinars at all. And if they get lost in any way - and even if it is beyond his control - they are not lost from [his fellow] at all. Rather [the original owner of the coins] is [still] obligated to give him one hundred dinar from any place. And this is [the meaning of] that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Bava Metzia 44a), \"He pulled the produce, but he did not [yet] give him the money, he cannot renege on [the transaction]\" - meaning he is obligated to pay him the value from any place. As it was not said with a status of barter, but with a status of value. And so was it elucidated at the beginning of the chapter [entitled] HaZahav. As there, they said (Bava Metzia 45b),  \"'The gold [coins] acquires the silver coins.' What, is it not with barter? No, with value.\" And it raises a difficulty there, \"If so, [why the expression], 'acquires' - it should have been, 'obligates?'\" [This] is meaning to say that the expression of acquisition only falls upon something known, but this one brings whatever [objects of] value he wants. And it answers, \"[Emend the text and] teach, \"obligates\" - meaning, he is obligated to give him the value once he pulled the produce from him, and he may not renege on it.",
                "But [in the case of] one who gives his money to his fellow to acquire produce with it, the owner of the produce is not obligated to give it to him. As this is an ordinance of the Sages, may their memory be blessed - not to acquire with money but with dragging. Nonetheless, the Sages, may their memory be blessed, made him liable [if he does not give him the produce] to receive [the curse of] 'The One who dispenses' (Bava Metzia 44a); as he went back on his word after he did an act with his fellow and took money from him. And this acquisition of exchange - which is [just] called, 'acquisition' by the Sages, may their memory be blessed - is a strong acquisition for every matter, whether for a sale, for a gift or for all of the conditions between a man and his fellow; as it is stated about it (Ruth 4:7), \"to establish any matter [...] and this is a validation in Israel.\" And the law of who is fitting to sell and his sale stands and who is not fitting - such as a competent person and an incompetent person; the law of one who sells things undifferentiatedly and does not explain all the things that he must explain; and the law of one who leaves anything over in his sale, whether in an item or in produce; the law of the borders that a man must mention in the selling of land and what is its status if he mentioned some of them but not all of them. And the law of one who sells property that is not his; and what is the law of the one who is forced to sell his land - and the distinction between he was hung and he sold, and he was hung and he gave. And the law of one who makes a condition with his fellow that if he will want to sell his land, he will sell it to him. And the one who sells his land with the intention to do any [particular] thing and it did not come up in his hand to do it; such as one who sells it with the intention of going to the Land of Israel, and in the end he does not go there, and all that is similar to this. And that which I say, with the intention to do any [particular] thing - it is not that the seller explicitly says the thing at the time of the sale, but rather that creatures know from his deeds and his words that this is his desire (see Kiddushin 49b and Tosefot there).",
                "And the law of how is the selling of consecrated properties or synagogues, and for which matter is their selling permitted (Arakhin 21b). And the law of buying deeds - that they require the handing over of the deed and  also writing that makes explicit that he is selling him the deed and any lien that it has (Bava Batra 76a). And the law of what would be if one gives money to his fellow to buy him something and he buys it for himself with that money; and the law of three that gave money to one, and he went and he bought with part of the money, how do they divide it. And the laws of that which they said, at four periods in the year does money [itself actually] acquire beasts - and therefore they, may their memory be blessed, said in the chapter [entitled] Oto ve'et Beno (Chullin 83a) that we make a butcher slaughter [an animal once he received the buyers' money] against his will; and like the contextualization of Rabbi Eelai that Rabbi Yochanan said - which explained that [the Sages] stood their words upon the words of the Torah at these four times, and like Rabbi Yitschak said that Rabbi Yochanan said, \"Money acquires from Torah writ.\" And what is the law (Ketuvot 76b) of one who sells a beast and it is found to be 'torn' (terminally ill and, so, unfit to eat). And the laws of a seller who says [the sale] is for a hundred and a buyer who says [it is] for fifty, and each one goes away, but he buys it afterwards undifferentiatedly. And the law of that which they said that a man may not sell what has not [yet] come to the world (Yevamot 93b). And the law of the owner of the sale; the law of a person's agent, and his partner in his buying and his selling regarding his loss and his profit. And the rest of the many details of the commandment are elucidated in the first chapter of Kiddushin and in the fourth, eighth and ninth chapter of [Bava] Metzia, and in the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh chapter of [Bava] Batra. And a few of them are in scattered other places in the Gemara (see Tur, Choshen Mishpat).",
                "And [it] is practiced in every place and at all times by males, as it is upon them to administer justice. And a court that transgresses this and adjudicates between a buyer and a seller not according to the law that our perfect Torah commanded us about this has violated this commandment - unless if it did this with the consent of both of them, since it is allowed [to do so] with the acceptance of the two of them. As any condition with money is upheld."

                "<b>To not mistreat in buying and selling:</b> To not mistreat one of Israel - whether male or female - in buying and selling, as it is stated (Leviticus 25:14), \"And if you sell a sale to your countryman or buy from the hand of your countryman, a man should not mistreat his brother.\" And they, may their memory be blessed, said in Sifra, Behar, Section 3:4, \"'A man should not mistreat his brother' - that is mistreatment [with] money.\" And in the Gemara (Bava Metzia 56b), they, may their memory be blessed, said \"'From the hand of your countryman' - something that is acquired from a hand to a hand\" - that is to say, movable items. And the intention of the midrash is not that the verse does not warn likewise about lands. Rather the matter is to say that the laws of mistreatment - such as the distinctions that they, may their memory be blessed, said (Bava Metzia 50b) that it is returned if there is [overcharging that is] more than a sixth [above the market price], and its laws for less than a sixth and for a sixth - are not practiced with lands, but only with movable items. And they expounded further about this verse (Sifra, Behar, Section 3:1), \"If you have come to purchase, purchase from an Israelite, as it is stated, 'or buy from the hand of your countryman.'\" And perhaps that which they were exacting here that the laws of mistreatment are only with movable items is because the verse changed [its] expression - as it stated, \"And if you sell a sale,\" which implies any sale, whether land or movable items; and afterwards it designated the warning for movable items, as it stated, \"or buy from the hand,\" which implies specifically movable items that are acquired from a hand to a hand. They learned from this to say that there is a novel law with movable items which is not with land - and that is the return of money with it in certain cases. ",
                "But the essence of the warning – whether with land or whether with movable items - is truthfully that we have been warned not to mistreat the creatures on purpose. However the difference between [movable items and land] is if there is mistreatment (overcharging) with movable items that is more than a sixth, the sale is nullified – as the mind of the creatures does not tolerate more [overcharging] than this with movable items. However it is the way of the creatures to forgive all mistreatment regarding land after one has bought it, since land is something that exists forever. And it is similar to that which they, may their memory be blessed, said by way of exaggeration (Bava Kamma 14b) that land is something worth all money. And the proof to these words of ours - meaning to say, that the prohibition of [overcharging] is also with land - is that behold, the main warning is written about lands, as is explained in this section of the Torah. And that is the opinion of Ramban regarding this - and as he wrote in his commentary of the Pentateuch (Ramban on Leviticus 25:14).",
                "The root of the commandment is well-known, as it is something to which the intellect testifies. And if it were not written, it is appropriate that it would be written - as it is not fitting to take the money of people through falsehood and deceit. Rather, everyone should earn that which God has granted him through his toil, in truth and righteousness. And there is a benefit to each and every one with this thing; such that [just] like he will not mistreat others, others will also not mistreat him. And even if there be one who knows how to trick more than other people [do], maybe his children will not be so and people will deceive them. And [so] it comes out that the things are the same for all, and that it is of great benefit for the inhabitation of the world. And God, blessed be He, created it to be inhabited. ",
                "From the laws of the commandment is that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Bava Metzia 51a) that both the buyer and the purchaser are warned by this warning (commandment), as it is stated, \"And if you sell a sale to your countryman or buy.\" And the buyer should not say, \"It is the way of the seller to know the worth of his sale. And given that he sold  it to me for a little money, I do not have an iniquity [for buying it below its fair price].\" As it is not like this, but they are rather both [included] in the warning. And likewise both of them are [included] in the laws of mistreatments, in the manner that they, may their memory be blessed, differentiated [the laws]. And so is it in the Mishnah (Bava Metzia 51a), \"It is the same for the seller and the buyer that they have [the law of] mistreatment. And anyone that is [overcharged] is able to renege on [the sale].\" And they, may their memory be blessed, said (Bava Metzia 49b) that the measure of [overpricing] that we return [the extra amount] but the sale will stand is a sixth of the sold item or a sixth of the money; and the measure of [overcharging] that we do not even return it - and it is not necessary to say that we do not nullify the sale for it - is less than a sixth of the sold item or of the money, but if there was a sixth of one of them in the thing, [the extra amount] is returned; and the measure of [overcharging] for which the entire purchase is nullified is so long as it is more than a sixth of the purchase or the money. As the law is like Shmuel, who says in the Gemara (Bava Metzia 49b) that if the [overcharging] is not greater than either of them, the sale is not nullified, but he rather returns the [extra amount].",
                "And that which we said that with [overcharging] that is more than a sixth, the sale is nullified - and even though this one went [back] to his house with his money, and this one went to his house with his produce - [that is] only if the one that was mistreated comes to renege on it. But if the one who mistreated comes to renege on it, because the produce had appreciated in between or [because of] another claim, we do not listen to him. [This is] because the one mistreated [could] say to him, \"If you had not [overcharged] me, you would not have been able to go back on it; and now you have found that you want to go back on it?\" And so is the language of the Gemara (Bava Batra 84a), and Rav Chisda is the one who said the teaching in the chapter [entitled] Hasefinah; and Rabbi Alfas, may his memory be blessed, ruled [like] it regarding the nullification of a sale and of produce. [This is] meaning to say, that the one mistreated is saying to the one who mistreated, \"At the time of the sale, the [extra] profit was already with you, and our sale or purchase was already standing because of you. What is it that comes to nullify it? The mistreatment that you did to me. Behold, I forgive it.\" As our Rabbis only nullified the acquisition because of the one mistreated. From when he wants the preservation of the [sale], behold, it is preserved. And that is [the meaning of that] which we learned (Bava Batra 83b), \"Fine, and they were found to be inferior, the buyer can renege on it\" - meaning to say, but not the seller; \"Inferior and they were found to be fine, the buyer can renege on it\" - meaning to say, but not the buyer.  ",
                "And they, may their memory be blessed, said (Bava Metzia 52a) about the matter of [overcharging] that it is not fitting that the law of reneging or nullification be forever; but they rather gave a set time about the things, so that the matters of buying and selling among people be preserved. And the time that they gave is not the same for all things and is also not the same for the buyer and the seller: As with any trade that [involves] the exchange of coins, they gave the measure [of time sufficient] for the buyer to show it to the money-changer if he is in the city. But if he is in a village, the measure is until the market day, that he can bring it to the city or to the place where the money-changer is [found]. And with all other goods there is no difference between a village and a city - and the measure for them is [time sufficient] for a person to show what he bought to a trader or to his relative. And this measure is according to what the eyes of the judge see; as it is impossible to set a calculation of hours about this matter. And Rava gave a reason in the Gemara (Bava Metzia 52b) about the distinction of a coin from other goods, and said it more generally, \"Everyone is certain about a cloak, it is [only] a money-changer who is certain about a <i>sela</i>. If this time passed and the buyer did not renege on it, he may not legally renege on it - even if there is much more than a sixth of [overpayment]. However, the Sages said (Bava Metzia 52b) that it is fitting from the trait of piety to always [allow him] to renege on it. And these measures are for the buyer, but the seller can always renege on it; since the goods are not in his hand so that he can confer about them.",
                "And these laws that we wrote are only said about one who purchased from a trader. But [regarding] one who buys from a homeowner, there is no [overcharging] in it and no nullification of the sale within the set time that we said nor afterwards. As these things were only said with traders for the improvement of the world and the settlements of the states. But homeowners only sell expensively - and in their knowing the matter that it is like this, people always forgive the matter with a homeowner. And these are the things (Bava Metzia 56a) that do not have the laws of [overcharging] for anyone, and even if they were sold for twice their worth - and even though there is a prohibition of [overcharging] about them, according to the opinion of Ramban, may his memory be blessed: lands; slaves - since they were compared to lands, as is learned in the Gemara (Bava Metzia 56b), from that which it is written (Leviticus 25:46), \"And you shall inherit them\"; deeds; and consecrated properties. And [it is] as they, may their memory be blessed, said, \"'And if you sell, etc. or buy from the hand' - something that is acquired from a hand to a hand; [so] lands are excluded, as they are not movable items. Slaves are excluded, as they are compared to lands. Deeds are excluded, as Scripture stated, 'a sale' - that which it, itself, is sold; [so] deeds are excluded, as they are not sold themselves and they are not acquired themselves, but only for the proof in them. From here they said, one who sells his deeds to a perfumer has [the possibility of overcharging].\" And the reason is because they do not sell it to him for the proof in them, but rather to use the paper. And it wonders about this in the Gemara, \"What do we understand from it?\" - meaning, isn’t this obvious; is paper worse than any other thing? And it answers, \"To exclude from that of Rav Kahana, as he says, 'There is no [overcharging] for <i>perutot</i> (the smallest coins) [and things of similar value].'\" Consecrated property is excluded from the law of overcharging, from that which it is written, \"your countryman.\"",
                "And know that all of the matters of [overcharging] are said regarding the worth of an object, such as if he sold what is worth six for five or what is worth five for six. But one who [defrauds] about the measure of an object - in its length, width or thickness - or about its weight, [causes the sale to] go back; and even for a small thing. And that is [the meaning of] that which Rava said (Kiddushin 42b), \"Anything with a measure, a weight or a number - even less than for [overcharging] - goes back.\" And one who wants to be saved from any concern of these matters that we wrote can say to the buyer, \"I know that there is [overcharging] up to such and such [value] in this object that I am selling to you. If you want to buy it on condition that you do not [claim overcharging] against me, buy it; but if not, leave it.\" [Like this, the buyer] has no claim of [overcharging] against him afterwards, nor even words of grievance (as is elucidated in Bava Metzia 51b). And the rest of its details are in the fourth chapter of [Bava] Metzia (see Tur, Choshen Mishpat 227). ",
                "And [it] is practiced in every place and at all times by males and females. And one who transgresses it and [overcharges] his fellow on purpose by a sixth or more has violated this negative commandment. But they, may their memory be blessed, permitted a trader to profit from less than a sixth for the betterment of civilization, so that people find their needs ready [for them] in every place. And we do not administer lashes for this negative commandment, as it is given to repayment.  "

And do not to say to a trader, 'How much is this item?,' when he does not wish to buy it.\" And about this it is stated (Leviticus 25:17), \"A person should not mistreat his countryman.\"",

                "From the laws of the commandment are many warnings and many prods with which they, may their memory be blessed, warned us about this matter that we not hurt the creatures in anything nor embarrass them. And they expanded on the thing until they said (Baba Metzia 58b) that one should not place his eyes on a [possible] purchase at a time when he has no money. And it is fitting to be careful that no insult of people be heard even from a hint of his words. As the Torah was very concerned about mistreatment in words, since it is something very difficult for the heart of the creatures. And many people are more concerned about it than about money - and as they, may their memory be blessed said (Baba Metzia 58b), \"Mistreatment of words is greater than mistreatment of money; as with mistreatment of words, it states (Leviticus 25:17), 'and you shall fear your God, etc.'\" And it would not be possible to write all of the things that [bring] pain to people individually. But everyone needs to be careful according to what he sees - as God, blessed be He, knows all of his steps and all of his hints; 'since man looks to the eyes, but He looks to the heart.'

And one who is lenient with them, not to cause them pain in these matters, will find life, blessing, and honor. And one who transgresses this and pained his fellow with words, with the ones our Sages, may their memory be blessed, specified - with a penitent or a sick man or those like them - has violated this negative commandment. But we do not administer lashes for it, since there is no act [involved] with it. But how many lashes - even without the whip of the calf (leather) - are there in the hands of the Master who commands about this, may He be exalted and blessed.",
                "However according to what it seems, it is not understood that if an Israelite came and began to be wicked to pain his fellow with his bad words, that the listener should not answer him. For it is not possible for a man to be 'like a stone that cannot be overturned' - moreover, that he will be in his silence like one who concedes to the insults. And in truth, the Torah did not command for a man to be like a stone, silent to those who insult him and to those who bless him alike. Rather it commands us to distance ourselves from this trait and that we should not begin to quarrel and insult people. And like this, every man will be saved from all this - since one who doesn't quarrel will not be insulted by people, except for [by] complete fools; and we should not pay attention to fools. And if perhaps some insulting person will force him to answer his words, it is fitting for a wise person to reply to him in a roundabout and pleasant way, and not become  very angry; as 'anger rests on the bosom of fools.' And he will [so] save himself before those who listen to his insults, and he will cast the burden upon the one who insults [him]; and this is the way of the best among men. And we should learn this thing - that it is permitted to us to reply to a fool - according to what it seems from how the Torah permitted one who comes to rob secretly to be preceded and killed (Exodus 22:1). As there is no doubt that a man is not obligated to bear harm from his fellow; as he has permission to save himself from his hand - and similarly from the words of his mouth that are full of deceit and cunning - with anything that he is able to save himself from him. However there is a group of people the righteousness of which rises so much that they do not want to include themselves in this teaching - to reply something to those that insult them, lest anger will overpower them and they become involved in the matter more than is necessary. And about them they, may their memory be blessed, said (Shabbat 88b), \"Those who are humiliated but do not humiliate [back], who hear their insult and do not reply - about them the verse states (Judges 5:31), 'but those who love Him are like the sun coming out in its strength.'\""

That is the opinion of Rambam, may his memory be blessed (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Sabbatical Year and the Jubilee 11:1).

                "And Ramban, may his memory be blessed, explicitly wrote in his novellae (Ramban on Makkot, 3b) that [in the case of] one who stipulates, \"On condition that the field will not return in the Jubilee,\" his condition is not a condition and it returns in the Jubilee - even though the same is not true for the sabbatical year. As if one [loans] on condition that it will not be released by the seventh [year], it is not released by the seventh [year] - since any condition about money stands. And he gave a reason about the thing: That regarding the sabbatical year, only the lender is warned about the cancellation of debts - and as it is written (Deuteronomy 15:2), \"every creditor should release his hand from that which he lent his neighbor\" - but not the borrower. As if he wants to repay, the option is in his hand. But regarding the Jubilee both of them, the buyer and the seller, are warned, and as we have written. As \"shall not be sold in perpetuity,\" is stated to both of them, 'since the land is the Lord's,' and it is not in the hand of a person to sell it finally. And since the obligation is upon both of them, neither has the [authority] to forgive about the thing. Rather the land is forcibly returned to the one with the holding of the Land - and even if they make a thousand conditions that it should not return in the Jubilee. And it is a good reason.",
                "And also from the laws of the commandment is that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Arakhin 30a) that one who sells a field of holding and he had other lands - that is, land that he purchased or [others] gave to him as a gift - and [then] he sells those fields to redeem his field of holding that he sold, he is not heeded. As it is written in the section of the field of holding (Leviticus 25:26), \"but he finds enough to redeem\" - and the explanation comes about it, that it is until he finds something that was not available to him at the time of the sale. And so [too,] if he borrowed and wished to redeem with that loan, he is not heeded - as it is stated, \"and his hand reached,\" and not that he borrowed.",
                "Fields of holding are those that came as an inheritance to each Israelite in the division of the Land, as well as anyone who merited and had his holding added to, due to shifts in the possession by a daughter that inherits possession. As it is a well-known thing that  \"and the possession should not move\" (Numbers 36:7), was only stated about that generation alone. These are the ones called the fields of holding, and their laws are a novelty from the Torah - differing from other lands for the purposes of redemption: As a field of holding can be redeemed by the seller or its redeemer after two years, against the will of the buyer; whereas other fields - which are called a purchased field - can only be redeemed with the buyers consent, [or else] they stay with the buyer until the Jubilee.",
                "And regarding the difference of houses from fields, we have already written their law later in its place (Sefer Hachinukh 340) - that the law of the houses of open (unwalled) towns is like the field of holding - meaning, that they [can also be redeemed] against the buyer's will; as it is written (Leviticus 25:31), \"it may be redeemed.\" And their power is greater than the fields, in that they can be redeemed even within the [first] year, like the law of houses of walled cities. And the law of houses of walled cities is also explained in Scripture, and I have already written it later as well.",
                "And from the content of the commandment is that which they, may their memory be blessed, also said (Bava Metzia 108a) that if one purchased a field of holding and planted trees on it and thereby enhanced [the field]; when it returns, we evaluate the enhancement that is in it for the buyer. As it is stated (Leviticus 25:33), \"the sale of the house shall go out,\" - and the traditional received explanation comes about it [that] the house goes back, but the enhancement does not go back. And that which they, may their memory be blessed, also said (Arakhin 29b) that if one sells his field - whether it is a field of holding or another field - he is not permitted to redeem it in less than two years, even with the permission of the buyer. As Scripture commands that the sale stay intact for two years regardless, from that which it is written (Leviticus 25:15), \"for the number of years of harvests shall he sell it to you\" - that is the warning to the seller; the warning to the buyer is from that which it is written, \"In the number of years shall you buy\"; and the minimum of [what can be referred to as] \"years\" is  two. It seems that the matter is so that no one will sell his land without difficulty, and he should not think that he will return and buy it from the hand of the buyer tomorrow. Rather he should know that he will not be able to eat from its produce in any way for two full years from the time of the sale. And they, may their memory be blessed, also said (Arakhin 29b) that the buyer must consume two harvests during those two years, as it is stated, \"years of harvests.\" Therefore, if one of these two years is a year of blight or plant-disease, or a [sabbatical year], it does not count in the tally.  [But they, may their memory be blessed, said that a fallow year is counted.] If he sold it in the Jubilee year itself, the sale is not a sale, and the money is returned to its owner. If he sold just the trees, they may [also] not be redeemed in less than two years. But if they are not redeemed during the Jubilee [cycle], they do not return in the Jubilee - as it is stated (Leviticus 27:25), \"and return to his holding,\" but not to the trees. If he sold it to the first one and the first one [sold it] to the second one and the second one to the third one - and even if there were one hundred or more [buyers] - the field returns to the [original] owner at the Jubilee, as it is stated (Leviticus 27:24), \"to he who has a holding of the land.\" And the rest of its details are at the end of  Arakhin (see Mishneh Torah, Laws of Sabbatical Year and the Jubilee 10). ",
                "And [it] is practiced by males and females in the Land of Israel when its inhabitants are upon it; as all the matters of the Jubilee are only [applied] at the time when its inhabitants are upon it, as we wrote above. One who transgressed it and sold his field in perpetuity - and likewise one who purchased it from him in this way - is lashed, even though their words are not effective. And that is if they performed some act in the thing, as we do not administer lashes for a negative commandment that does not [involve] an act. This is the opinion of Rambam, may his memory be blessed. But according to the opinion of Ramban, may his memory be blessed, there are no lashes in this at all, as I wrote at the top of the commandment."

And Scripture elucidated the matter of redemption - which is return of the land to its owner; and as it is written (Leviticus 25:13), \"In this jubilee year, each man shall return to his holding.\"",

                "From the laws of the commandment: A few of them are elucidated in Scripture  - how the law should be of the seller with the buyer when he wants to redeem his sold possession before the Jubilee year. And the distinction that Scripture elucidates is between one who sells a house in a walled city and one who sells one in open cities, that are called cities of <i>chatserim</i> in the language of Scripture. As the law of houses of open cities is like the law of fields. And they, may their memory be blessed, also said (Arakhin 31a) about this commandment, that if [one] sold his house among the houses of walled cities to another and the first buyer sold it to a second within the [first] year, we count [the year according to] the first. And once the year comes to an end for the first, the house is finalized to the second (it is permanently his). As the matter of selling a house among the houses of the walled cities which is permanent [after] a year is a type of penalty, with which the Torah penalized the seller, on account of love of the Land. And since it stood for a year in the hand of someone besides him, it is fitting that it be finalized in the hand of the second. And further, since the first sold it to the second, all of the right [to it] is his. And had it stood for a full year in the hand of the first, it would already have been finalized in his hand.",
                "And that which our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, also said (Arakhin 31b) that if the [last] day of the twelfth month arrives and [the original owner] does not find the buyer [to redeem it from him, behold he places his money in the court, breaks the door of the house and enters; and when the buyer comes,] he comes and takes his money. And that which they said (Arakhin 31b) that one who sells a house in the walled cities and the Jubilee arrives in the midst of the year of the sale, it does not go back immediately with the [start of the] Jubilee, but its law is like in other years in the years of the Jubilee [cycle] - that it is finalized with the [end of the] year if the seller does not want to redeem it. And that which they said (Arakhin 33a) [regarding] the seller of a house in the open cities - that if he wants, he can redeem [it] immediately like the law of a house from the houses of walled cities; and if does not want to redeem [it] immediately, he can redeem it even after a year like the law of fields. As they have the better power of [both] the fields, and the houses of the walled cities. And that which they said (Arakhin 32a) that the law of everything that is inside the wall, such as gardens, bathhouses, and birdhouses, is like the law of houses - as from that it is written (Leviticus 25:30), \"that is in the city,\" it includes it all. But if there were fields inside the city, their law is like fields outside of the city, as it is stated, \"the house will be established\" - meaning to say, the house and all that is similar to a house, such as bathhouses, and birdhouses and even orchards, but not fields. And a house that does not have four ells by four ells is not called a house; and therefore, it is not finalized. And a house is not finalized in Jerusalem. And a city that its roofs are its walls does not have  the status of of one surrounded by a wall, but rather we require that  it has a wall besides its roofs. And we also require that it was first surrounded and settled afterwards, but if it was settled [first] and surrounded afterwards, that is not a walled city. And we only rely upon a wall that surrounded [a city] from the time that Yehoshua conquered the Land. And once they were exiled in the first destruction [of the Temple], the holiness of a walled city was nullified. But when Ezra came in the second coming [to the Land of Israel], all of the cities surrounded by walls at that time were sanctified; since their coming in the the time of Ezra which was the second coming, was like their coming in the time of Yehoshua: Just like their coming in the time of Yehoshua [provided that] they counted the sabbatical years and Jubilees, the walled cities were sanctified and they become obligated in the tithe; so too at the time of Ezra was it so. And so too, when the messiah will come with the third coming, we will begin to count the sabbatical years and Jubilees, the houses of walled cities that will be surrounded at that time will be sanctified and every place that will be conquered will be obligated in tithes. As it is stated (Deuteronomy 30:5), \"And the Lord, your God, will bring you, etc.\" - and they said (Arakhin 32b), \"It compares your inheriting to the inheriting of your ancestors, etc.\" And the rest of its details are elucidated in Tractate Arakhin (see Mishneh Torah, Laws of Sabbatical Year and the Jubilee 12).",

And the law is the same about an open area (another textual variant: field) into a city and a city into an open area (another textual variant: field) - that one may not change anything about their content. And this matter is well-known, as the Torah commanded (Numbers 35:2-7) that the other tribes cede certain cities to the tribe of Levi; and these are forty-eight cities, with the six cities of refuge that were among them. And it also commanded that there be in these cities a thousand ells of open area - meaning a place open for space and beauty for the city; and two thousand ells beyond that for the sake of fields and vineyards, and this is also of the beauty of the city and from that which it needs, as it is explained in Sotah 27b. And this prevention comes about this, that these matters never be changed. And concerning this it states (Leviticus 25:34), \"And the fields of open areas of their cities shall not be sold\" - meaning, shall not be changed.

And about them is it stated (Deuteronomy 33:10), \"They shall teach Your statutes to Yaakov and Your law to Israel.\" And because of this - that wisdom was within them - the dealings of all of Israel were constantly with them; beside that there were among their cities, the cities of refuge for [those charged with manslaughter]. And from this also, the eyes of all of Israel were upon their cities, as a man cannot tell what [tomorrow will bring].

And there is glory for all of Israel with this.

And it would seem that anyone who did change them with witnesses and a  warning would be liable for lashes. But I did not know the measure of this change - how much it would be for him to be liable for it. Be wise, my son, and know it. And Rambam, may his memory be blessed, wrote concerning this commandment (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Sabbatical Year and the Jubilee 13:12), \"Why did the Levites not merit [a portion] in the possession of the Land of Israel and in the spoils of war, with his brethren? Because they were set aside to serve God, may He be blessed, and minister unto Him and to instruct His just paths. And therefore they were set apart from the ways of the world: They do not wage war like the remainder of the Israelites, nor do they [receive an inheritance], nor do they acquire [things] for themselves through the power of their bodies. Instead, they are God's legion - as it is stated (Deuteronomy 13:11), 'May the Lord bless His legion' - and He provides for them, as it is stated (Numbers 18:20), 'I am your portion and your possession.' And it is not only the tribe of Levi that is included in this, but each and every man that comes to the world whose spirit has moved him to be separated and to stand in front of God and to serve Him, to know His straight and righteous paths and to teach them to others - the yoke of the many calculations that people seek out is lifted from upon his neck. And behold, he is sanctified to become holy of holies, and God will be his possession for ever and ever. And he will acquire the thing that he needs in this world, just as the tribe of Levi acquired [it].

So why did the verse divide them?\" [That is] meaning to say, why did it divide them and not write, \"Give neither your money nor your food with interest.\" \"To cause the transgression of two prohibitions\" - meaning to say, to give multiple warnings about it (Bava Metzia 61a). And this matter is what I have said above (Sefer HaChinukh 336), that the Torah will occasionally repeat warnings about that which it wanted to distance us from greatly. And it is possible for us to say about this, similar to what they, may their memory be blessed, said about other matters, \"The Torah speaks like the language of man\" (Berakhot 31b). And likewise, the Torah is constantly warning about that which requires our vigilance in the way that people will repeat their conditions and speak much when they warn one another about a weighty matter - so that the [listener] be aware and vigilant about it in all circumstances. And even though it is fitting that a person should be most careful about the word of God - even if he heard the word through the slightest hint - this is all from His great kindnesses upon His creatures, that in a few places He repeated warnings for them many times - like a parent disciplines his child. And we should therefore thank Him for all the goodness that He, blessed be He, bestowed upon us.",
                "What I have written about it in the warning (negative commandment) for the guarantor, witnesses and scribe that they should not be involved is loans with interest (Sefer HaChinukh 68) is from the root of the commandment:.  ",
                "The laws of the commandment: For example, the distinctions that they, may their memory be blessed, taught us about this warning - that they said that there is interest that is prohibited from the Torah, which they call (Bava Metzia 61b) 'fixed interest'; and there is interest which is below this and it is rabbinically prohibited, which they, may their memory be blessed, called 'the dust of interest'; and there is another interest, which is lower than these first two and it (should have been) is strictly speaking permitted, as it is far removed from Torah-level interest, to the point that it is not suited to decree about at all, but the Sages were strict in this matter, in their seeing, that the Torah was very strict about it, and the many warnings about the matter of interest, and they forbade it so that people would not cheat, [and] not for some other reason. And these are the three types of interest: Torah level interest is when anyone says to his fellow, \"Lend me a <i>maneh</i> and I will give you a <i>perutah</i> every day for it,\" or thirty <i>perutah</i> a month, or more or less, until I pay it [back]; or if he says, \"Lend me a hundred dinar, for a hundred and twenty [after] a year\"; or if he lends money and takes a house or courtyard as collateral that he will hold and reap the produce until he returns his money, without subtracting something from the loan - that is fixed interest that is prohibited from the Torah. And they, may their memory be blessed, said (Bava Metzia 63b) more generally, \"And payment for 'Wait for me' is forbidden by the Torah,\" and that is so long as it came from the hand of the lender to the borrower - that is forbidden by Torah writ. And they, may their memory be blessed, said about it, \"Fixed interest can be extracted by judges\" (Bava Metzia 61b). That is, the court may seize assets from the borrower and deduct from them, as is the law for theft and torts. But other commentators explain \"extracted by judges\" regarding coercion, meaning to say that the court coerces the borrower with whips to return it - as they do with anyone who says that he will not fulfill a positive commandment.",
                "Every other form of interest aside from those mentioned is called rabbinic interest and is [also] called 'the dust of usury', and it cannot be extracted by judges. And the Sages prohibited these as a decree so that a person not come to [lending with] interest from Torah writ. And among them are like that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Bava Metzia 70b) that one cannot accept 'iron sheep' from an Israelite - the understanding of 'iron sheep' is one who takes money on condition that the principle will stay intact for the money's owner from the one who receives it, and [that] he [also] takes his share of the profit. And so [too,] may one not set [the price] for produce until the market rate is disseminated; though if the market rate is disseminated, we can set [a price] - for [even if] the [seller] may not have it, [someone else] has it. And to what do these words apply, that we never set [the price] until the market price has been disseminated? When he does not have it - meaning, from that type that he set [the price]; but if he does have some of it - and even if he only had a <i>seah</i> - he may set [the price] for several <i>seah</i>, [as with a loan].  For the law follows Shmuel who said like this in the Gemara (Bava Metzia 75a). And that which we said that he must have the same type, there are some of the commentators that said he must have exactly the same type (Beit Yosef, Yoreh De'ah 175), such that he may not set the price in new wheat if he only has old wheat - he must have exactly like the type for which he is setting [the price]. But there are others of them that said that there is no distinction between old and new, as so long as he has from the same type, it is permitted. And regardless, if he has from the same type, he may set [the price] with it even if it is lacking one or two [preparatory types of] work. But if it is lacking three [preparatory types] of work, behold, he is like one that does not have from that type. And in the Gemara, the chapter [entitled] Eizehu Nesekh (Bava Metzia 74a), the elucidation appears at length on the distinction of these [types of] work [involved] with wheat, as well as with the tools of a potter and with other things.",
                "And so [too,] from the matter of the commandment is that which they prohibited to lend money with land [as collateral] and to make a condition with the borrower, \"If you do not return the money from now until day x, the land will be mine\" (Bava Metzia 66a); because the acquisition is not effective, as it is a dependence (<i>asmakhta</i>). [This is] meaning to say that the person's mind was depending on this at the time of the [loan] - that is that he would return the money - but his hand did not reach to fulfill the matter. And this is a type of duress. And [with] all that is of this type, we must be concerned about the eating of the produce on account of interest. And many types of dependence about the matter of interest and about other matters are spoken of in the Gemara. And my teacher, may God protect him, taught us more generally about the matter of dependences, that any time a person makes a condition with his fellow that is by way of a penalty - that is, if it not be so, he will be punished with such and such money - is called a dependence. And concerning this, they, may their memory be blessed, said always (Bava Metzia 66b), \"Dependences do not acquire.\" And with a different expression did they, may their memory be blessed, also say, \"Any 'that if' does not acquire.\" But any condition that a person makes with his fellow and says, \"If you do such, I will do such and such\" - as [is] the manner of people to make conditions in this way of speaking - is not included in dependencies at all, God forbid. For if so, how would we ever 'find our hands and feet' with any conditions people make with one another - as they are all with the expression, 'if'; since it is impossible without this. Moreover, what could we say about the many conditions that pertain to bills of divorce and marriages - as they are all with the expression, 'if?' Rather, that which we have written is certainly a correct explanation: That we only say, 'dependences do not acquire,' about that which people make conditions one with another by way of a penalty - such as \"If I don't pay you by day x, the field will be yours,\" or whatever the collateral is, and all that is similar to it; but not for the great many other conditions that people make with each other - such as, \"If you go to place x, I will give you such and such,\" or \"If you do thing x for me, I will give you two hundred <i>zuz</i>,\" and anything like that.  Understand this, my son, and give your heart to it, as through this you will remove a great cloud from between your eyes about the words of the Gemara in many places.",
                "They also said (Bava Metzia 75b) that early or late interest is the 'dust of interest' and prohibited rabbinically. How is this? If one placed his eyes that he wanted to borrow money from someone and sent him gifts in order that he will lend to him - that is early interest. If he borrowed from him and returned the money to him, and then sent gifts [in recognition of the fact] that [the lender's] money was idle with him - that is late interest. And likewise, some of the commentators said (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Creditor and Debtor 6:7) that if one lends money to his fellow for [collateral of] a place that constantly produces value - such as a courtyard, bathhouse or store - [if it is] without a deduction [for that value], behold it is fixed interest; and with a deduction, behold it is 'dust of interest.' But one who lends money for a place that does not constantly produce value - such as a field or a vineyard, as its value is not always found, since sometimes the expense involved exceeds the revenues - without a deduction, it is 'dust of interest'; and with a deduction, it is permitted. But there are some of them that say that the Sages, may their memory be blessed, prohibited even a field and a vineyard with a deduction; and the only permissible form of collateral that they found is the 'collateral of Sura,' [in which] they would write, \"At the end of these years, this land will revert without money.\" And the truth according to what seemed from the Gemara to our teachers, may God protect them, with the good commentaries is that any collateral that is made with a deduction - whether it is a house or bathhouse that produces profits, and all the more so with a field or vineyard - it is all permitted with a deduction.  And so have they practiced in our land based on their words. But one who is concerned for the view of the great savants who were strict in this matter will be blessed from the Heavens. ",
                "And what was the other interest that we said above that they, may their memory be blessed, prohibited to prevent cheating on interest? Such as if a person says to his fellow, \"Lend me a <i>maneh</i> (one hundred zuz),\" and [the other responds], \"I have no <i>maneh</i>, [but] I have a <i>maneh</i>'s worth of wheat\": [If] he gives him the wheat for a <i>maneh</i> and buys them back for ninety, this would certainly be logically permitted, except that the Sages forbade it because of cheating with interest. As behold, this thing appears like interest - as this one gave ninety dinar, but he is taking a hundred. Yet if he transgressed and did this, [the lender can] extract the full hundred, as there is not even the 'dust of interest' here. It is only as a fence that the Sages were strict about the matter. Also, if one had a field as collateral, he may not rent it to its owner, because of cheating with interest; and  similar to these matters, as is found in the Gemara (Bava Metzia 68a). And even though they forbade these things only because of cheating with interest, there are some things they permitted, even though they are similar to true interest. And the Sages permitted them because they did not see a concern about them [in order] to make a decree at all: And that is that they permitted a person to sell a debt at a discount; and the Sages also permitted a person to give his fellow a dinar so that he will say to another Israelite that he lend [the first] a <i>maneh</i>. And they, may their memory be blessed, said (Bava Metzia 69b) more generally that the Torah only forbade interest that goes from the hand of the borrower to the lender - as this is the way of the world. As the Torah always chooses the [more common case] and leaves out the details (unusual cases). And since the way of the world is like this, it [only] warned the borrower and the lender. And even though they said so and it is true, it is fitting for any scrupulous person to distance himself with all of his might from every matter that has cheating with interest in it. And anyone who pursues ways to take interest payments from an Israelite will eventually become poor - and as they, may their memory be blessed, said (Bava Metzia 71a), that the property of anyone who deals in interest will shrink. [They] also said (Bava Metzia 75b) that a <i>perutah</i> of interest causes a loss of storehouses of money. And the rest of the many details of the commandment are in Bava Metzia, the chapter [entitled] Eizehu Nesekh (see Tur, Yoreh Deah 167).",
                "And [it] is practiced in every place and at all times by males and females. And one who transgresses this and gave a loan with interest from Torah writ has violated a negative commandment, and [so] we extract money from him with judges; as the court may seize his assets in the way that the court seizes his assets for his theft or for his damages, according to the view of some of the commentators - or we extract if from him by way of coercion in the way that we coerce an Israelite who does not want to fulfill a positive commandment, according to the view of some of our rabbis, may God protect them. And if he lent with interest that is forbidden [rabbinically] that is called 'the dust of interest,' he has violated a rabbinic proscription, but the money cannot be extracted by judges. However if the borrower seized enough for the [value] of that interest from the lender, we do not extract it from his hand. And if he transgressed and lent with interest, which they, may their memory be blessed, forbade only because of cheating with interest; there is no need to say that we do not extract it from the lender if he took it, as we even extract if from the borrower and give it to the lender - as they [already] transgressed and stipulated this between them. As since they, may their memory be blessed, were only stringent about the thing because of cheating with interest, they did not concern themselves with the thing ex post facto. And this is called ex post facto, since the words between the lender and the borrower have [already] been fulfilled.  "

And truthfully, a laborer - who is a free man - is usually not employed for degrading work; and likewise a boarder - who is a man who comes to live in a different land.

And [also] the law of one [the sex of which is in doubt], a gentile or a slave who appraised or were appraised; the law of one who is dying that he has no appraisal or value; the law of one who is going out to be killed; the law of one who appraises one limb; the law of one who says, \"My weight is upon me\"; the law of one who says, \"My height is upon me,\" or \"My full height is upon me\"; [the law of] one who says, \"Gold and silver are upon me,\" but he did not specify from which [type of] coin (Menachot 104b); and the law of how it is that we arrange things for one who made an appraisal and his hand could not reach to pay what he appraised - and this is what the Sages said about this matter (Arakhin 23b): We take collateral from those obligated in appraisals and values, and we do not return the collateral during the day or the night; and we sell everything that is found to them of land and movable items - even clothing and household utensils, and there is no need to say, slaves and beasts. But we do not sell for them the clothing of their wives or  their children - and not even clothes that he [just] dyed for their sake nor new shoes from when he bought them for their sake before he made the appraisal. And so [too,] one who consecrates all of his possessions, does not consecrate these.",
                "And the matter of the arrangement is that we provide for the one that has appraisals or values [that he owes], thirty days of food and twelve months of clothing - clothes that are suitable for him - and his shoes and his tefillin, but not other books. And [we provide him with] a suitable bed and bedding. But we do not provide food and clothing for his wife and children, even though he is obligated in their food and clothing. And when we give him alone clothing for twelve months, it is only that which is suitable for him, but if he wore silk items and golden clothing we take it off of him, and we provide him with suitable clothing for a man like him for weekdays, but not for Shabbat and holidays (Bava Metzia 113b). And if he was a craftsman, we provide him with tools of his trade - two craft tools from each and every type. How is this? If he was a carpenter, we provide him with two planes and two saws. And if he had many tools of one type and few of another type, we do not sell the many in order to buy him of the few. Rather we provide him with two of the many and all that he has of the few. But if he was a donkey driver or a shipowner, we do not provide him with the beast or the ship, even though their [sustenance] is only from them. And so [too,] if he is a Torah scholar and he has nothing with which to earn his livelihood besides his study, the commentators said that we do not leave him his books, as this is also not included in tools of a trade - and from here I have a proof that it is upon the student to bring the book to the teacher. But there are some of the commentators who said that we leave him the tractate that he is studying at that time - and they said well, on account of the honor of the Torah.",
                "And that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Arakhin 23a) that we ask about appraisals and values [in order to annul them] in the [same] way that we ask about other vows and consecrations. And they also said (Arakhin 24a) that if there were animals or slaves or jewels among the possessions of the appraiser and the traders say, \"If he buys clothing of thirty dinar for this slave, he will increase his value by more than sixty\"; or \"If you wait on this animal for a month, its value will increase by double\"; or \"If they bring this jewel to place x, it will be worth much money\" - we do not listen to them at all. Rather we sell everything in their place and in their time, as it is stated (Leviticus 27:23), \"and he shall give the appraisal on that day, holy to the Lord.\" And the understanding came about this that this verse teaches about all consecrated things that we do not sustain them, we do not wait with them for the market day and we do not take them from one place to [another]. And this is the principle - that they only have their place and time alone. And what are these words speaking about? About movable items. But we proclaim [the intention to sell] lands sixty consecutive days - morning and evening - and afterwards, we sell them.",
                "And since the matter of arranging [this debt] has come to our hand, we shall write here that which they, may their memory be blessed, said about a [general] debtor in the chapter [entitled] HaMekabel Sadeh Mechavero in Bava Metzia 113b: That there we say, \"A teacher taught in front of Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak, 'In the [same] way that we arrange things with appraisals, so do we arrange things with a debtor.'\" And they brought many challenges and solutions and the end of the matter is that which the Gemara brings, \"A story of Eliyahu, who Rabbah bar Avoua found standing in a graveyard of gentiles. He said to him, 'What is [the law] about their arranging things for a debtor?'\" And Rashi, may his memory be blessed, and others had a textual variant [instead], \"From where [do we know] about their arranging things for a debtor?\" [This is] meaning to say, it was obvious to Rabbah bar Avoua that we arrange [things for a debtor], but he was asking Eliyahu, from which verse we learn it. \"And Eliyahu answered him, 'That this is how we learn it, \"destitution, destitution,\" from appraisals.'\" [This is] meaning to say that it is written about a loan (Leviticus 25:35), \"And if your brother becomes destitute and his hand falters with you, you shall strengthen him\" - which is a loan, as it is written at its end (Leviticus 25:35), \"Do not take from him interest or increase, etc.\"; and it is written about appraisals (Leviticus 27:8), \"And if he is destitute from [paying] the appraisal\" - and the received tradition (Arakhin 24a) comes [that its understanding is], revive him from his appraisal.",
                "And [so] we learn, \"destitution, destitution,\" to arrange things with a debtor in the way that we arrange things with appraisals, and we should not hesitate about the words of Eliyahu. And so did all the Geonim and Rabbenu Alfasi rule. And even though Rabbi Yaakov in the name of Rabbi Pedat, and Rabbi Yirmiya in the name of Ilfa, said that we do not arrange things for a debtor, in the way of it being obvious in the Gemara - [nonetheless] we do not hesitate about the words of Eliyahu. And even though we found that Rabbenu Tam wrote like the opinion that we do not arrange things, and his proofs are in his book, 'after the many do we incline.' And Rambam, may his memory be blessed, also ruled like the other Geonim that we arrange things (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Creditor and Debtor 1:7). And nonetheless, he wrote that the agent of the court only leaves the debtor items that are essential to him, such as a bed and bedding and that which he wears. And it appears that what forced the Teacher to say this is when he saw in this chapter [entitled] Mekabel regarding an agent of the court: That they said in the Mishnah (Bava Metzia 113a), \"If he had two items, he takes one and returns one - the pillow at night, and the plow during the day.\" And they did not list tools of the trades. But from what it appears, this is certainly not a great compulsion [to rule as he did]. As since it is established to us that we arrange things with him in the way that we arrange things with appraisals, they are the same in every matter. And even though the Mishnah did not enumerate them, this is no matter; as it is not like a peddler that enumerates [all of his wears] and repeats [them] in every place. [Rather] it mentioned pillow and plow, and the law is the same for everything that is fitting to leave him. And the principle of the matter, according to that which seems - and that which is agreed by all the savants of the world whose fame about Torah has been disseminated - is that we arrange things with a debtor exactly in the way that we arrange things with appraisals. And they have what to rely upon from the words of the Gemara and from that of Eliyahu - may he be remembered for the good - as we we have written.",
                "And if you ask, \"And how do we arrange his clothing; and behold, we say in the Gemara (Bava Kamma 11b), 'His clothing, and even the cloak that is on his shoulder'\" - it is possible to say that it is an expression of exaggeration. And also [one could say it is referring to] a very precious cloak - such as [one] of silk and gold - from those that we said are not included in the arrangement [of what he keeps]. And the rest of the many laws of appraisals are elucidated in the tractate that is built upon this, and that is Tractate Arakhin (see Mishneh Torah, Laws of Appraisals and Devoted Property 4).",
                "And the commandment of appraisals is practiced in every place and at all times by males and females - meaning that it is practiced such that if they appraised, their appraisal is effective and [the amount] is consecrated. And nonetheless, the Sages said that at this time we should not appraise from the outset. And [it is] as we say in Tractate Avodah Zarah 13a [in the] first chapter, \"We do not consecrate, and we do not appraise and we do not dedicate at this time. But if one did consecrate, or appraise or dedicate, a beast should be destroyed; produce, garments, or vessels should rot; money or metal vessels, he should take to the Dead Sea. And what is destroying? He locks the door before it, and it dies on its own.\" And the understanding of this consecration is consecration for the [Temple] upkeep - as with regards to appraisals, it was taught with it, that their undifferentiated [pledge] is also for the [Temple] upkeep. And even though Shmuel said in Arakhin 29a, \"Consecrated items worth a <i>maneh</i> (a hundred large coins) that they desanctified upon that which is worth a <i>perutah</i> (the smallest coin), is desanctified (it is effective)\" - and this is also about consecrated items of the [Temple] upkeep, as with consecration for the poor, it is certainly not something that can be desanctified, but rather we pay it in full; and that which Shmuel said, \"desanctified,\" in the past is not [meant] to be precise, as he holds that we can desanctify it on the worth of the smallest coin at the outset, as is clearly proven in the Gemara - it is not a difficulty at all: That which we say about it here, \"A beast should be destroyed, etc.\" - such is the law; but Shmuel said the solution [to the problem created by the law]. And it appears that this is how Rabbenu Alfasi, may his memory be blessed, solves [it] in his Laws in the first chapter of Avodah Zarah, as he brings both of [these statements] together there.",
                "And one who transgresses this and appraises at the time of the [Temple] and does not fulfill [it] to give the amount specified in the Torah; or that at this time he did not do in the thing that which they, may their memory be blessed, said to destroy everything according to the law - or that which Shmuel said as its solution - has violated this positive commandment. And his punishment is very great, as he has 'misappropriated a misappropriation of the Lord.' And if three festivals have passed him by after he appraised, there is another punishment in the things, since he is [also] transgressing, 'do not delay.' And there are those that explained that he transgresses immediately also on account of 'do not delay': That in everything that he obligated himself and it is fit to pay, like charity and that which is similar to it, 'do not delay' [applies] immediately. [This is] to exclude a sacrifice, as he did not obligate himself, such that he does not transgress until three festivals - and like the words of Rabbi Shimon (Rosh Hashanah 4b), \"Until three festivals, and the holiday of [Pesach] is first.\" And there are those that said that even regarding charity - and all the more so, other vows - we do not transgress on account of 'do not delay,' until three festivals. And [it is] like we find in the Gemara (Rosh Hashanah 5b) concerning gleanings, forgotten sheaves and the corner, \"And we do not differentiate between if he obligated himself or he did not obligate himself.\" And that which they said in the Gemara, in Rosh Hashanah 6a, \"And for charity, he is liable for it\" - meaning, immediately - [means] he is liable for it with a positive commandment (see Mishneh Torah, Laws of Appraisals and Devoted Property 4)."

And about this is it stated (Leviticus 27:10), \"He shall not substitute nor exchange for it.\" And from when they exchanged it - meaning, that they said, \"This instead of that\"; \"This in exchange for that\"; or what is similar to these expressions, which is the essence of exchange (Temurah 26b) - there is liability for lashes in the thing, even though there is no act [involved] with it. [This is the case] even if there was somewhat of an error in the case. How is this? One who intends to say, \"Behold this is in exchange for the burnt-offering that I have,\" but he says, \"in exchange for the peace-offering that I have\" - behold, this is an exchange and he is lashed; as nonetheless regarding the exchange it was volitional. But if his thought was that it was permissible to exchange, he is certainly not lashed. For one, it was inadvertent. And also, we only administer lashes with witnesses and a warning - and behold there is no warning [in such a case].",

And they said (Temurah 4b) it is because there are two negative commandments about it, as I have written in this Order (Sefer HaChinukh 352); and a positive commandment does not come and uproot two negative commandments. And they also said another reason - since the negative commandment of exchange is not the same as the positive commandment about it: As if the community, or partners make an exchange, they do not create an exchange (it is not effective), even if they are warned not to exchange (it is forbidden). And since the negative commandment is not the same as the positive commandment, we do not say about it that its law is like a negative commandment that is rectifiable by a positive commandment. And if you will ask further, \"And why do we administer lashes for this negative commandment, as it is possible to transgress it without an act, with speech alone - and the principle is established for us that we do not administer lashes for any negative commandment that does not have an act [involved] with it\"; we have already written the answer in many places: That they, may their memory be blessed, explicitly excluded (Shevuot 21a) swearing, exchanging and cursing his fellow with [God's] name from this principle.

Rather without an act at all is there a liability for lashes with some sins. And they are the three mentioned, one who puts out a bad name and a colluding witness. Some of them the lashes are explicit in the Torah about them - such as one who puts out a bad name and a colluding witness. And some of them we learned out from Scripture, such as swearing - as we learn in Shevuot 21a in the chapter [entitled] Shevuot Shtayim. And some commentators said about some of them that it is because an act will come out from it in the end - such as this of exchange, since the beast became consecrated with his speech and one who benefits from it will misappropriate it.",

Behold, what we wanted is elucidated, that it is a positive commandment.",
                "It is from the roots of the commandment that God, blessed be He, wanted to instill His fear in the hearts of people in all matters of sanctity, and as I wrote in the building of the the holy House and its vessels in the Order of Vayikchu Li Terumah (Sefer HaChinukh 95). In that commandment you will see our intent, from the angle of the simple understanding, about the great stringency that is fitting for us to practice with the holy. And therefore in order to establish the awe of the matter of the holy in our hearts, the verse commanded us that we not change our words. Rather, from when the beast is sanctified, it is in its sanctity forever; and we should not think to remove it from its sanctity and to exchange it with another beast. But if he did [speak] this thing from his mouth, his thought and all of his action is reversed and both of them are holy. As he came with his actions to remove holiness and it shall be the opposite - that it expand more and be attached to all [of them]. And Rambam, may his memory be blessed, wrote (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Substitution 4:13) about the reason for this commandment, and about that which we have been commanded to add a fifth for the redemption of consecrated things, that the Torah went down to the bottom of man's thinking and his evil impulse. As his nature is to multiply his [own] possessions and to be concerned with his money. And even though he vowed and sanctified, it is possible that he will go back on it and regret and want to redeem it for less than its worth. Therefore, he adds a fifth. And likewise he will exchange the beast that he sanctified with one that is less than it. And if permission was given to him to exchange a bad one with a good one, he will exchange a good one with a bad one. And therefore Scripture sealed the door in front of him. And he was further lengthy about this matter and wrote, \"And even though all the statutes of the Torah are decrees, you are fitting to examine them (about) and give a reason for [everything] that you can.\" And the Teacher should be remembered for the good, as he aided me in this [project] of mine.",

And therefore he is not lashed. But a beast that has a blemish creates an exchange, since there is a sacrifice with its type. And like that which they said (Temurah 9a) that a man can not exchange his beast for a sacrifice that is not his. But if the owner of the sacrifice said, \"Anyone who wants to exchange may exchange,\" any man can exchange for it. And one who exchanges cattle for sheep or sheep for cattle, sheep for goats or goats for sheep, males for females or females for males, or exchanged one beast for a hundred or a hundred for one - whether at one time or whether one after the other - behold, this is an exchange and he is lashed according to the calculation of the animals that he has exchanged. And the exchange cannot create a [further] exchange, nor can the offspring of a sanctified beast create an exchange, as it is stated, \"and it and its exchange will be consecrated.\" And they, may their memory be blessed, were precise, alongside the received traditional understanding (Temurah 13a): \"'It,' and not its offspring; 'and its exchange,' and not the exchange of its exchange.\" But [in the case of] one who exchanges for a beast and goes back and exchanges for it even a thousand times, they are all an exchange and he is lashed for every one. And fowl and meal-offerings do not create an exchange, as only \"beast\" is stated in the verse. And the exchange for the sanctified things of gentiles [is not effective] from Torah writ. But rabbinically, [in the case of] a gentile who exchanges, it is exchanged (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Substitution 1:6). And everyone exchanges - both men and women. It is not that a man is permitted to exchange, but rather if he exchange [an appropriate beast], it is exchanged and he absorbs the forty [lashes].

And that <i>sela</i> is equal to four dinar, and a dinar is four <i>maah</i>, and a <i>maah</i> is two <i>pundyon</i>. It comes out [to] a <i>sela</i> and a <i>pundyon</i> for each year. As even though the <i>sela</i> is forty-eight <i>pundyon</i> according to this calculation of ours - nonetheless, one who wants to take a <i>sela</i> from a money changer, needs to give forty-nine <i>pundyon</i> so that the money changer will earn one <i>pundyon</i>. And since he has to give forty-nine <i>pundyon</i> [in this case], we calculate it according to the calculation of what the consecrator would pay the money changer - as the hand of (terms for) the consecrated is always upon the  higher. And we appraise it the same if he consecrates a field so good that there is none like it in the land or a field so bad that there is none as bad as it. As Scripture did not want to distinguish in this matter and made [the same] appraisal for all lands (Arakhin 14a). ",
                "And since we explained the shekel-coins, it is fitting that we explain how much is a <i>chomer</i>: You should know that the <i>chomer</i> is a measure that is [also] called a <i>kor</i>. And a <i>kor</i> is two <i>letech</i>, and a <i>letech</i> is fifteen <i>seah</i>. It comes out that a <i>chomer</i> is thirty <i>seah</i>, which is ten <i>eipah</i> - as an <i>eipah</i> is three <i>seah</i>. It is a well-known thing and we also already knew it from our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, (Eruvin 23b) that a place that has fifty ells by fifty ells is a <i>beit seah</i> - meaning that it is [what contains what grows from] a <i>seah</i> of barley - and that is two thousand five hundred [square ells] by arithmetic (multiplication). It comes out that a place that is fitting for the seed of a <i>chomer</i> of barley - which is thirty <i>seah</i> - is  seventy-five thousand ells by arithmetic.",
                "And what is the way of the calculation with the appraisal of fields? A field of holding is distinguished in its content from a purchased field. And when we measure [a field of holding], we only measure the places in it that are fitting for planting; and its appraisal is that stipulated by the Torah - \"the seed of a <i>chomer</i> of barley for fifty shekel-coins of silver\" - as we elucidated, whether it is good or bad; and he adds a fifth to this stipulated appraisal. And let this rule be in your hand: with every fifth stated in the Torah, it is a fourth of the principle, so that the principle and the fifth that is added to it are five [portions together]. And if the entire field that he consecrated is not fitting for seeding at all, we redeem it according to its worth. And which is that which is called a field of holding? That is a field that a man inherited from his bequeathers. And a purchased field is a field that a man purchased [on] his own, or that he received the rights to it in any way that is not because of inheritance.",
                "And the law of one who consecrates his purchased field - that we estimate it worth - is [that] we see how much it is worth until the Jubilee year. And if the consecrator redeems it, he does not add a fifth onto it. And its redemption is for the upkeep of the [Temple], like other appraisals and values (Arakhin 24a). And when the Jubilee arrives, the field goes back to its [original] owners who sold it. Whether it was redeemed from the treasurer by any man and it goes out [now] from under his hand, or whether it was not redeemed and it goes out from the hand of the consecrated - it always returns to the one for which it is a holding in the Land. And it does not go out to the priests because a man cannot consecrate something that is not his, and this land was the purchaser's only until the Jubilee year. And this is not the case for a field of holding: As if the Jubilee arrived and the owners did not redeem it from the hand of the consecrated or from the hand of another who acquired it from the consecrated, the priests give its value - since the consecrated only goes out with redemption - and it is a holding for them forever. And those monies go to the consecrated for the upkeep of the [Temple]. And any field that we estimate for the consecrated, to sell it for its value, we announce sixty days - morning and evening, which is the time that the workers come in from their work and go out - so that all will hear about the thing. And we demarcate its borders and say, \"Its quality is such and [price] x is its estimation.\" And whoever wants to buy comes and buys (Arakhin 21b). And the rest of its details are elucidated in the tractate that is built on this, and that is Tractate Arakhin. ",
                "And [it] is practiced by males and females at the time that the Jubilee is practiced. But at this time, the Sages, may their memory be blessed, already said (Avodah Zarah 13a) that we do not consecrate and we do not appraise, as we wrote above (Sefer HaChinukh 360). But nonetheless, if one transgressed and did consecrate land now to the [Temple] upkeep, it is possible for him to solve it - like that of Shmuel - such that he desanctifies it upon that which is worth a <i>perutah</i> (the smallest coin) or more and he throws it to  the Dead Sea. But if he does not want this solution, it appears certain that he must appraise it according to the statute that we have written and throw its money to the Dead Sea - so that it not be a stumbling block for him or for his children. It is better that [the money] be lost and that people not stumble with it, than that he leave it in a corner for the [Temple] upkeep - as there will not be a lack of money in the future to support the House of our God."

And about this thing is it stated (Leviticus 27:26), \"a man may not consecrate it\" - meaning that he not make the first-born a burnt-offering nor a peace-offering nor any other sacrifice. And the received tradition comes that it is not specifically with a first-born that the verse is concerned - that the law is the same for all that is consecrated [for] the altar. As so did they say in Sifra, Bechukotai, Section 8:3, \"I only have the first born. From where [do we know] about all the consecrated that we do not change it from [one] holiness to [another] holiness? [Hence] we learn to say, 'with a beast, a man may not consecrate it.'\" It hints that with every consecrated animal - whether the consecration of the consecrated for the altar or even for the upkeep of the [Temple] - we do not change it from its holiness, but it is [to be] left like it is; and \"a man may not consecrate it\" is stated about everything.

And they also said (Temurah 25a) that we are not to be tricky with a consecrated animal, to consecrate its embryo [with] a different holiness, but it is rather in the [same] holiness as its mother - as offspring of consecrated animals are consecrated from the innards of their mother. This is not the case with the first-born, as the first-born is consecrated upon its exit, as Scripture makes it depend on opening the womb. And therefore it is possible to be tricky with a first-born before it is born, to consecrate it with a different holiness. And about this is it stated, \"which becomes a first-born of [...], a man may not consecrate it\" - from when it becomes a first-born, you may not consecrate it, but you can consecrate it in the belly. And therefore one who said, \"If the one that is first is a male, behold it is a burnt-offering,\" must sacrifice it as a burnt-offering. But he may not make it into a sacrifice of a peace-offering, since he cannot remove it from its holiness. As the holiness of peace-offerings is below that of the first-born; such that the first-born is only eaten by priests, whereas the peace-offerings [are eaten] by every person. And the rest of its details are in the fifth chapter of Temurah.",

And one who transgresses this and changed it from [one] holiness to [another] holiness - for example if he consecrated it for a peace-offering and afterwards said that its holiness should be for a burnt-offering, or another sacrifice - has violated this negative commandment.

As so did the they, may their memory be blessed, say  (Arakhin 28b), \"Undifferentiated dedications are for the priest.\" And their proof is from that which is written explicitly in the section, \"like the dedicated field, his holding shall be of the priest.\"",
                "It is from the roots of the commandment [that it is] because Israel is the nation that God chose from all the other nations for His service and to recognize His Name, and they are not under the rule of the constellations that God apportioned to all the other nations. They are instead [directly] under the hand of the Holy One, blessed be He, without any intermediary of an angel or constellation; and as it is written (Deuteronomy 32:9), \"For the portion of the Lord is His people, Yaakov is the measure of His inheritance.\" And as you find when He took them out from Egypt - which was a miracle that included all the people - that He took them out by Himself in His glory. And [this is] as they, may their memory be blessed, expounded, \"'I will pass through Egypt' (Exodus 12:12) - I and not an angel; 'and I will strike the first-born' - I and not a seraph,\" as it appears in the Haggadah. And therefore anytime Israel maintains the Torah and crowns themselves with His service, only goodness will rest upon them, and the flow of blessing and a pure benevolent spirit will support them; and the opposite - the curse and the 'dedication' - will [rest] upon their enemies and haters. As such, if one of their tempers become short and he pronounces an expression of curse and 'dedication' on his money or his lands - which are under the blessing - the verse informs that it is impossible to remove it from the domain of the blessed to another domain. [This is] since everything that belongs to Israel - who is the portion of God - is His; [as] whatever a slave acquired, his master acquired (Pesachim 88b). Still, since we truly know that the intention of the one who dedicates is to remove that thing from his domain, it is fitting to fulfill his will; and [so] it returns to the domain of his Master and it becomes holy.   ",
                "And that is [the sense of that] which Scripture (Leviticus 27:29) states nearby, \"Any dedication that is dedicated of a man you shall not redeem, he shall surely die\"; as its content in the way of the simple meaning is that [in the case of] one who dedicates of a man that is not his - for example, those fighting against their enemies who make a vow, \"If this nation is surely given into my hands, I will dedicate their cities\" (Numbers 21:2) - [the objects of the vow] should die. As other nations are not included in the wellspring of blessings, as we have said; and [so] the expression of 'dedication' clings to them. And so did Ramban (Rambam) explain this verse in the way of its simple understanding (Ramban on Leviticus 27:29). And even though there are many midrashic explanations about this verse, there are seventy faces to the Torah and 'they are all straight for the one who understands.' And from this root they, may their memory be blessed, said (Arakhin 28a) that all that belongs to the Levites and the priests - whether land or whether movable items - cannot be dedicated. That is, even if the priest or the Levite said about his field that it be dedicated, it does not hold. As he is like one who dwells in his Master's house - the place of blessing and kindness and good - and all that he has is God's. And amidst blessing there is no place for 'dedication.'",

It is one whether he dedicates land or movable items - they are given to the priests of that shift, [serving] at the time that he dedicates.

And that which they, may their memory be blessed, said [regarding] the tithe of beasts that is slaughtered, [that] it is permissible to sell its fat, its tendons, its skin and its bones - as the they only forbade to sell its meat alone. And if the bones were expensive and he included the value of the meat in [that of] the bones, it is permitted. And Rambam, may his memory be blessed, wrote (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Firstlings 6:5) that it appears to him that [in the case of] one who sells the tithe, the purchaser does not acquire [it]. And therefore the seller is not lashed for it - since his actions were not effective. And [it is] like one who sells the dedications of the priests, such that the buyer did not acquire [it], and like one who sells a woman (captive) of beautiful form, such that the buyer did not acquire [it] - as is elucidated in its place. To here [are his words]. And the rest of the details of the commandment are elucidated in Tractate Bekhorot and in Tractate Maaser Sheni at the beginning.  ",

And if he sold it in any way, he has violated this negative commandment - which is \"it shall not be redeemed.\" But we do not administer lashes for it, like we said adjacently in the name of Rambam, may his memory be blessed.",

And so [too,] in the [future] generations, the Temple and the whole yard which is in front of it is called the camp of the Divine Presence (Zevachim 116b), and it is included in this commandment. And they said in Sifrei Bamidbar 1 that \"and they shall send from the camp\" is a warning (negative commandment) to the impure not to enter the Temple. And they said in Pesachim 68a, [that] \"He shall exit to outside the camp\" (Deuteronomy 23:11) is a positive commandment. And this commandment is [indeed] repeated in another place, \"If there be among you a man who will not be pure of a nocturnal emission, he shall exit to outside the camp.\" And its explanation (Pesachim 68a) is [that it means] outside the camp of the Divine Presence. And, likewise, this itself is repeated, as it went back and stated (Numbers 5:3), \"and send them out of the camp.\" And I have already written (Sefer HaChinukh 228) that the repetition of prohibitions within a [single] commandment indicates a little bit of the stringency of the commandment; as God wanted for the benefit of His creatures to warn them and go back and warn them about it. [It is like] the way of people that they warn each other many times about all things that have a great need. And if we have nonetheless found [important] bodies of the Torah stated by clues, everything is for a correct reason. ",
                "It is from the roots of the commandment [that it is] because it is known to the Sages that the matter of impurity weakens the power of the intellect and mixes it up and separates between it and the pure and perfect Elevated Understanding. And it will be separated until it is purified. And [it is] as it is written regarding the matter of impurity (Leviticus 11:43), \"and do not become impure with them and be impurified (<i>venitmetem</i>) in them\" - and they, may their memory be blessed, expounded (Yoma 39a), \"and be stupefied (<i>venitamtem</i>) in them\"; meaning to say that the the sources of intellect are stupefied by impurity. Hence it is not fitting for a person who is sullied by impurity to be in the holy and pure place, wherein the spirit of God is [found]. And this matter can be compared metaphorically to the palace of a king from which we distance any man that is leprous or disgusting in his body, or even in his clothing.

And [so] he is sent out of three camps, which means out of Jerusalem; whereas those who have a genital flow whose impurity is not so stringent are [only] sent out of two camps, which are the camps of the priests and the camp of the Levites, and that is outside of the Temple mount; and one impure from a dead body whose impurity is [in some regards even less] stringent is only sent out from one camp - hence it is permissible for him to enter the Temple Mount. And what is the stringency of those with abnormal genital flows over one impure from a dead body? That the [former] renders impure that which is resting or sitting upon him, even when [separated by] a stone, whereas the one impure from a dead body does not impart impurity this way. And one impure from a dead body, and those that have intercourse with a menstruant and all gentiles more generally are sent out from the perimeter (<i>chail</i>), whereas someone who has immersed in purifying waters but only becomes pure at the end of the day (<i>tevul yom</i>) enters there. A <i>tevul yom</i> is sent out of they courtyard of the Israelites and the women's yard, whereas one lacking [only] the atonement sacrifice is not.

And one who transgresses it and enters a place that he is not permitted while he is still impure, along the guidelines that we have explained, has violated a positive commandment; besides having violated a negative commandment, as we will explain in this Order (Sefer HaChinukh 363), with God's help."

But one who is impure from the impurity of a dead body, for which a nazirite does not shave - even though he is impure [with] an impurity [requiring] seven [days before being able to be pure] - is exempt [from excision] for coming into the Temple. And so [too,] one who touched vestments that touched a person who touched a dead body, or if he touched a person who touched vestments that touched a dead body - even though he is impure [on the] first [level] regarding impurity and to impart impurity to sanctified meat - behold, such a one is exempt for coming into the Temple. And these things are a law of Moshe from Sinai (<i>halakha le'Moshe me'Sinai</i>). And even though he is exempt, they would give him lashes of rebellion. And all of the impurities for which a nazirite must shave about or not shave about are elucidated in Tractate Nazir. And one who throws impure vestments into the Temple - even if they were impure vestment that touched a dead body - is exempt from excision, but liable for lashes.

                "<b>The commandment of confession of sin:</b> We are commanded to confess before God our sins that we have sinned, at such time that we feel remorse for them. And this is the content of confession: to say at the time of repentance, \"Please, God, I have sinned, I have transgressed, I have rebelled [in] such and such,\" meaning to say that he mention the sin that he did explicitly with his mouth. He should [then] seek atonement for it and extend his words in this matter according to his fluency. And they, may their memory be blessed, said that even sins that require the bringing of a sin-offering still demand confession with the offering, and about this it states (Numbers 5:6), \"Speak to the children of Israel [saying], a man or woman who commits from any of the sins of man and rebels against the Lord, that soul is guilty and they shall confess the sins that they did.\" [The Sages] said  in the Mekhilta (Sifrei Zuta on Numbers 5:6), \"Since it says 'confess the sin' (Leviticus 5:5) it means that the sin must be extant, that is that the sin-offering is alive and not slaughtered.\" This mean that the animal to be offered must still be alive. They also said there, \"We see that one must confess if he renders impure the Temple and its holy things. From where do you know to include all other commandments?\" That is that this verse in Parshat Vayikra only [discusses] one who renders impure the Temple and its holy things; from where do you know to include all other commandments? \"As it is written, 'Speak to the children of Israel, etc. and they should confess.'\" That is, that we expound the verse as if it is not written about a specific thing.  \"And from where do we know that its understanding [includes sins that are punishable by] death and excision? Since it is stated about the confession of Aharon in Acharei Mot (Leviticus 16:16 'for all their sins'.\" [The Sages], may their memory be blessed, expounded [on this verse] to include negative commandments; and 'that they did' which is written here to include positive commandments, meaning to say that if he does not do a positive commandment that he could have done, he is obligated to confess about it. And they further expounded there in the Mekhilta, \"'From any of the sins of man' - from that which is between him and his fellow, theft, robbery and evil speech.\" And this confession truthfully requires that he return the '[theft] that is in his hands,' as if he does not do so it would be better not to confess about it. \"'To rebel' includes all those sentenced to death who must [also] confess. I might have thought to include even those convicted by false witnesses\"; that is, even though he knows that he did not sin, except that false testimony was testified against him, that he be obligated to confess about this. \"Hence the verse teaches, 'soul [that] is guilty' - I only said when there is guilt there, but not when he knows that he did not sin, except false testimony was testified against him. Hence we understand that [for] all iniquities, large and small - even positive commandments - a man is obligated to confess about them.",
                "And since this commandment of confession comes with the obligation to bring an offering - as is written in Parshat Vayikra there (Leviticus 5:6), \"And he shall bring his guilt-offering, etc.\" - one might think that the confession is not an independent commandment on its own, but rather only one of the things that are an extension of the sacrifice. Therefore they had to elucidate in the Mekhilta that such is not the case, but rather it is indeed an independent commandment. And so they said there, \"I might have thought that I only confess when they brought [offerings]. From where do I know even at the time that they do not bring [them]? Since it is stated, 'the children of Israel[...] and they shall confess'\" - meaning to say that the tradition comes to expound [it] in this way.  \"Still, I might have thought that there is confession only in the Land\"; that is, even though one may confess without the sacrifice, nonetheless, that the obligation for confession is only in the Land, as that is the locus of atonement, and the sacrifices are there and the locus of everything is there. \"From where do I know to include the Diaspora? From that which is written (Leviticus 26:40), 'And they shall confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers.'\" That is, the iniquity of their fathers who sinned and were exiled from the Land. \"And so [too,] did Daniel say outside of the Land (Daniel 9:7) 'For You, Lord, is the righteousness and for us is the shame on this day.'\" Hence it is elucidated that confession is an independent commandment and that it is practiced in all places. And they also said in the Sifra (Sifra, Acharei Mot, Section 4 6), \"'And they shall confess' - that is verbal confession.\"",
                "It is from the roots of this commandment [that it is] because through the verbal admission of iniquity, the sinner reveals his thoughts and opinion: that he truly believes that all his deeds are revealed and known before God, blessed be He, and that he will not act as if 'the Eye that sees' does not see. Furthermore, through mentioning the sin specifically, and through his remorse about it, he will be more careful about it on another occasion not to stumble in the same way again. Since he declares verbally, \"I did such-and-such, and I stumbled in my deeds,\" he will have created a fence so he will not repeat what he did. And through this he will be wanted by his Creator. blessed be He. And the Good God, who wants the good for His creations makes them walk in this way, [that] they merit with it. ",
                "From the laws of the commandment is that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Taanit 15a) that repentance is that the sinner leave the sin and remove it from his heart and from his thought, and he decide in his heart not to do like this again, as it is written (Isaiah 55:7), \"Let the wicked give up his way, the sinful man his thoughts\"; and afterwards, he must confess about it, meaning to say that he say the words of repentance orally, as it is stated (Exodus 32:31), \"and they made for themselves a god of gold.\" And he must also mention explicitly that he will not return to do the sin again, as it is stated (Hosea 14:4), \"and we will not again say 'our god' about the work of our hands, etc.\" And they, may their memory be blessed, said (see Rambam, Mishneh Torah, Laws of Repentance 1:2) that the scapegoat would atone for all sins when one repented, light and weighty - whether he transgressed them volitionally or accidentally whether it was known to him or unknown to him. But if he did not repent, the scapegoat only atones for the light ones. And what are the light ones and what are the weighty ones? [Weighty ones] are sins for which one is liable for the death penalties of the court or excision; and also vain and false oaths are from the weighty ones, even though they do not come with excision. And the other positive and negative commandments that do not come with excision are called light, in comparison to the weighty ones. And now that we do not have the Temple and the altar of atonement, on account of our iniquities, we only have repentance. And repentance atones for all sins. And even if one was a complete evildoer all of his days and he repented completely at the end, we do no mention any of his evil, as it is stated (Ezekiel 33:12), \"and the wickedness of the wicked will not cause him to stumble when he turns back from his wickedness, etc.\" To what do these words apply that repentance alone suffices? To sins between man and the Omnipresent, such as one who eats something prohibited or has a prohibited sexual intercourse and so [too,] one who negates one of the positive commandments and similar to it. But [regarding[ sins between a man and his fellow, such as one who injures his fellow, or robs his money or with any other thing through which he illegally injures him - whether in action or in speech - it is never forgiven him with repentance  alone, until he gives his fellow what he owes him and until he is appeased. And they, may their memory be blessed, have already said (Yoma 87a) what is his remedy if his fellow does not want to be appeased by him. And also from the content of the commandment is that which they said in the Tosefta that there are twenty-four things that impede repentance, and they enumerate them there. [This] and the rest of the details of the commandment are elucidated in the last chapter of Yoma (see Mishneh Torah, Laws of Repentance 1).",

And one who transgresses it and does not confess about his sins on Yom Kippur, which is the day that is set from always for forgiveness and atonement, has violated this positive commandment. And woe to a man, if he dies without confession and carries his iniquity.",
                "And the essence of confession that we received from our Rabbis and that is the custom of all of Israel to say during the Days of Repentance is, \"However, we have sinned, we have been guilty, etc.\" And they, may their memory be blessed, said in Shabbat 32a in the chapter [entitled] Bemeh Madlikin, \"One who became ill and tended toward death, they say to him, 'Confess,' as it is the way of all those executed to confess.\" And so [too,] in Tractate Semachot, it is taught, \"One who tended toward death, they say to him, 'Confess before you do not die. Many confessed and did not die, and many who did not confess died and many that are walking in the marketplace [have] confessed, as you live from the merit of your confessing.'\" If he can confess orally, he [should do so], and if not, he [should] confess in his heart. And Rabbi Moshe ben Nachman (Ramban), may his memory be blessed, wrote (in Torat HaAdam, Chapter of the End, regarding confession) that he received [a tradition] from pious men and men of good deeds, that such is the confession of someone on his deathbed: \"I admit in front of You, Lord, my God and God of my fathers, that my healing is in Your hands and my death is in Your hands. May it be the will in front of You that You heal me [with] a complete healing. But if I die, let my death be atonement for all of my sins and my iniquities and my rebellion that I have sinned and been iniquitous and rebelled in front of You; and let my portion be in the Garden of Eden, and make me merit the World to Come that is safeguarded for the righteous.\" And remember this order, to say sins first, and afterwards iniquities and afterwards rebellion - the way we have mentioned, \"I have sinned, I have been iniquitous, I have rebelled (<i>chatati, aaviti, pashaati</i>).\" As Rabbi Meir and the Sages already disagreed about this in the Gemara (Yoma 36a): Rabbi Meir reasons that it is the opposite, that we say like Moshe said, \"Who carries iniquity, rebellion and sin\" (Exodus 34:7).

And Rabbi Moshe ben Nachman, may his memory be blessed, also wrote (Ramban on Numbers 5:15) regarding the matter of the sacrifice of the <i>sotah</i>, on the level of its simple meaning, that the husband brings this sacrifice from his [possessions] for the jealousy that he has towards her, so that God, may He be blessed, will take vengeance from her. And the reason for the barley (<i>seorim</i>) is that there be 'an angry storm (<i>saara</i>) of the Lord going out, and the storm land on the head of the evildoer, that it land on the head' of the unfaithful woman; and like the matter of griddle bread of barley that is stated with Gidon (Judges 7:13), which they interpreted as a great, tumultuous storm. And so, [it being] in the clay vessel is a sign that she should be broken like the pot of a craftsman; and so, the dirt is a sign that she die and return to the dirt. But regarding the matter of the oil, he did not say anything. And I will answer my portion about it: [It is] because the oil is the highest of all the liquids, as it floats over all of them. And now that the <i>sotah</i> has corrupted her deeds and he has removed her from being the mistress and put her down to be lowly and contemptuous, it is not fitting to bring on her sacrifice, the glorious oil which is prepared for light and greatness, to anoint the kings and the high priests with it.

And one who transgresses this and drinks a <i>reviit</i> of a <i>log</i> of wine, or ate a <i>kazayit</i> of grapes that are wet or dry, or from their refuse which is the seeds and the peels, is liable for lashes. And even if he ate a <i>kazayit</i> from among them all - meaning to say that he took a little from each one of those [items] that we mentioned, until among all of them, there was the measurement of a <i>kazayit</i> - and he ate it, he is lashed. As all prohibitions of the nazirite combine one with the other to a <i>kazayit</i>, to require lashes because of them. But other prohibitions in the Torah do not combine one with the other, except for the meat of a carcass with the meat of a 'torn' animal (<i>tereifah</i>), and a sacrifice disqualified by the wrong thought (<i>pigul</i>) with a sacrifice disqualified by its lateness (<i>notar</i>), which combine. And the six items in the thanksgiving sacrifice, which are fat, meat, fine flour, oil, wine, and bread also combine. And it is not necessary to say that everything that is of one name combines, such as the carcass of an ox, the carcass of a lamb and the carcass of a gazelle, and similar to this (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Forbidden Foods 4:17).",
                "And they, may their memory be blessed, taught us that it is a prohibited substance with a prohibited substance that combines to [form a] <i>kazayit</i>, like those that we mentioned. But a permitted substance does not combine with a prohibited substance, regarding all of the prohibitions in the Torah. [This] means to say that one who eats half a [<i>kazayit</i>] of a prohibited substance and half a [<i>kazayit</i>] of a permitted substance mixed together will not be liable for lashes - whether in the prohibitions of the nazirite, or whether in all of the other prohibitions. And also even with consecrated foods, meat and milk, and expurgations [of the vessels] of the gentiles - which [all] include novelties - when he did not eat a <i>kazayit</i> of the prohibited matter, there is never a liability for lashes in the thing, as is explained in Pesachim 44b and Nazir 37b. As the law is not like Rabbi Akiva, who holds like that in Tractate Nazir 37a [in] the chapter [entitled] Shloshah Minin, and learns it from the passage of \"and any marination.\" Rather, the law is like the Rabbis who disagree with him and establish that verse there, and so [too] in Tractate Pesachim 44b, to learn from it that the taste of the prohibited matter is prohibited just like its essence (its solid mass) - whether for the nazirite or whether for all of the prohibited substances in the Torah. And so is it said there, \"And [does] this 'and any marination' come [to teach] that? That one is required to [teach] like that which was taught, '\"And any marination\" is to give [that] the taste be like its essence. As where one soaked grapes in water and the water has the taste of wine, [it is forbidden]. From here you derive [the law] with regard to all prohibited substances in the Torah.' Just as with regard to a nazirite, etc. [continuing to] whose [opinion] is this? The Rabbis. However, some [and I] say [it is] like Rabbi Akiva.\"",
                "And many interpretations have been said about the understanding of 'the taste is like the essence.' And one of them - and it appears to be the best - is that any prohibited substance that is not with its type, but rather is mixed into a permissible substance and gave taste to it; about this they, may their memory be blessed, said that the taste of the prohibited matter is forbidden, like the essence of the prohibited matter. This excludes if it mixed into its [own] type [of substance], as there is no giving off [a different] taste here. And for [the previous matter], this passage of \"and any marination\" was required. As if it were not that we learned this thing from this passage, I would have determined that any prohibited substance that mixed into a permissible substance - in its type, or even not in its type - is nullified by the majority [constituted by the permissible substance], based on the well-known principle of the Torah, that one [part] is nullified in two [parts]. [This] means to say, in a majority, as the expression, 'two' is not [meant to be] exact. And once we have known this, we should determine the taste to be like the substance. And what is the law that is well-known to us regarding the substance without a mixture? That one who eats a <i>kazayit</i> of a prohibited substance without the elapsing of the measurement [of time] of eating a <i>peras</i> is lashed for it. But if more than this elapsed, he is exempted. And this same law is said with its taste: That if a <i>kazayit</i> of the taste of the prohibited substance mixed into the permissible substance [such that it could be eaten] within the [time] required to eat a <i>peras</i>, and he ate from it the measurement of eating a <i>peras</i> without the mentioned elapsing [of time], he is lashed for it. [But] if he ate less than this, or if less than this measurement of the prohibited substance mixed into it, he is not lashed for it. And, likewise, some of the commentators said that included in lashing for the prohibition of its taste without its essence is that any time the prohibited substance gave so much taste into the permitted substance as if a <i>kazayit</i> of the prohibited substance was mixed into it, [such that it could be eaten] within the [time] required to eat a <i>peras</i> - even though we do not know the measurement of how much of the prohibited substance [itself] entered into it. And this is not the opinion of Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon (Rambam), may his memory be blessed, according to what appears from his words in Separation (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Nazariteship 5:4) and in Holiness (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Forbidden Foods 15:3). Rather, according to his opinion, we never administer lashes until we know that he ate a <i>kazayit</i> of the substance of the prohibited substance - either on its own or in a mixture [wherein it constitutes] a <i>kazayit</i>  [such that it could be eaten] within the [time] required to eat a <i>peras</i>. And according to this reasoning, that which they said there, \"'Marination' is to give [that] the taste be like its essence; such as where one soaked grapes in water,\" is said regarding the matter of the prohibition, and not about lashes."

From where [do I know there is also a] negative commandment? Hence, it teaches to say 'a blade shall not pass over his head.'\"",
                "From the root of the commandment, I have already written an introduction at the beginning of the book that there being something in the world of the Holy One, blessed be He, that combines physicality and intellect - and that is Man - was something fitting and necessary for His praise, blessed be He, to come up properly from His creatures; that with this creature, there would not be lacking any possibilities, which we have in our minds to grasp, from His world, etc., as I wrote there. And there is no doubt that without this reason that obligates our intellect to dwell within the physical, [which is involved with] desire and sin, it would have been fitting for our intellect to stand and serve in front of our Creator and to recognize His honor like one of the 'sons of God' that are stationed with Him. However, because of this obligation, it is  subjugated to live in physical houses. And since it is subjugated to this, it must occasionally veer from the service of its Creator to tend to the needs of its home where it lives. For a home's structure and its lumber and its stones cannot stand without a person minding it. If so, as the intention of man's creation was according to what we have said, whenever the intellect can minimize physical work and focus on the service of its Master, that is good for it; so long as it does not completely ignore the work of the house and destroy it. As this would also be considered a sin for him, as the King wished to have a creature like this. It is like the saying of Rabbi Yose, (Taanit 22b) that a person may not afflict himself on a fast day, which Rav Yehudah explained in the name of Rav as stemming from the verse \"and man was a living thing\" (Genesis 2:7), [which implies that the soul should be allowed to live].  On the [same basis] the wise king stated (Ecclesiastes 7:15), \"Do not be overly righteous; do not be overly wise.  Why should you be desolate?\" And this is the holiness of the nazirite and his loftiness, as he departs from the physical. [About this] Shimon the Righteous said (Nazir 4b), \"In all my days [as a priest], I never ate the guilt-offering of an impure nazirite, apart from one man who came to me from the South, who had beautiful eyes and a fine countenance, and his locks were arranged in curls. I said to him, 'My son, what did you see to destroy this [beautiful] hair?' He said to me, 'I was a shepherd for my father in my town, and I went to draw water from the spring, and I looked at my reflection. And my evil inclination quickly rose against me and sought to drive me from the world. I said to my evil inclination, \"Wicked one! For what reason are you proud in a world that is not yours, about one who in the future will be maggots and worms. [I swear by] the Temple service that I will shave you for the [sake of] Heaven.' Immediately, I arose and kissed him on his head, and said to him, 'My son, may there be more nazirites like you in Israel. With regard to you the verse states (Numbers 6:2), \"When either a man or a woman shall clearly utter a vow, the vow of a nazirite, to consecrate himself to the Lord.\"'\" Therefore, in order to suppress the [evil] inclination, he is commanded to shave his head at the end of the days of his [term]. And he is not permitted to fix it up and to take a little of them, so that his [evil] impulse does not come back against him as [it did] at first. Rather, he has become obligated to shave it all, for there is no doubt that both very long hair and completely shaven heads destroy the appearance of a person.",
                "And do not wrangle [with] me from what they, may their memory be blessed, said (Nazir 19a), \"He must bring an atonement offering for himself, for he pained himself by avoiding wine.\" For this also works with our explanation. Since I have already said that a person does not have the right to destroy his house and to wreck anything of the building that was built by the First Builder, it is fitting for him to bring atonement for his soul. For perhaps he has overstepped the boundary that obligates him with regard to his body and his soul.  As perhaps being a nazirite is overly afflicting to his soul according to his nature and constitution. And all 'the ways of God, may He be blessed, are righteous and the just follow them.' And Ramban, may his memory be blessed, wrote in his commentary (Ramban on Numbers 6:11) according to the simple understanding that the reason of the sin-offering that the nazirite bring for atonement [is] that he requires atonement for returning to become impure with the desires of the world. As once this person had had a 'spirit of God' upon him and began to become a nazirite to God, it would have been fit to stay that way for his whole life.  And there are seventy faces to the Torah.",
                "From the laws of the commandment is that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Nazir 39a) that if the nazirite shaves - whether volitionally or  accidentally, or even under duress - behold, this interrupts his count, and he begins to count [another] thirty days; as we hold that a standard nazirite period is thirty days (Nazir, 5a), so that he will have a lock. To what do these words apply? If the majority of his head was shaved with a blade or something like a blade, and there is not enough to fold their tops over to their roots from that which remains of [what was shaved]. But if he only shaved the minority of the hair on his head, he does not interrupt his count for this. And so too, he does not interrupt his count by drinking wine, even if he drank [it] for several days. But he does interrupt his number by impurity, as the verse explains.",
                "[Also among the laws is] that which they, may their memory be blessed, said that all substitutes for the term of nazirite are effective - meaning to say, if a person had a speech impediment, or lived in a place where everyone has a speech impediment, and their way is instead of saying <i>nazir</i>, they say <i>nazik, nazich</i> or <i>pazich</i> and he said one of these expressions about himself, such that he said, \"I will be a <i>nazik, nazich</i> or <i>pazich</i>,\" behold, he is a nazirite. As we do not say that the words of his mouth must be identical to [what is in] his heart, as we do for oaths. Rather, once he has [decided] in his heart to become a nazirite and he says [something by which] it can be understood that [he wants] to be a nazirite - even though these are words that themselves do not [positively identify] him as a nazirite - behold, he is a nazirite. And so [too,] that which they said that [adjunct expressions are effective]; for example where he says, \"I shall be,\" as a nazirite passes before him.  Or if he says, \"I will be beautiful\" and holds his hair, behold, he is a nazirite. And so, one who says, \"I will be a nazirite from grape seeds only,\" or \"shaving, or impurity only,\" behold, he is a complete nazirite. And one who says, \"I will be a nazirite on the condition that I will drink wine\", or \"become impure,\" or \"shave,\" behold, he is a nazirite, and all [the prohibitions of a nazirite] are prohibited to him; because [in the case of] one who makes a condition which violates the laws of the Torah, the condition is cancelled.  One may request [annulment] on a nazirite vow in the same way that one requests on other vows. A father may make a nazirite oath for his son up until age thirteen, but the mother may not, and this thing is a tradition.  Gentiles are not subject to [becoming a] nazirite, though women and slaves are. A husband or father may annul the nazirite vow of his wife or daughter like other vows, as may a master force his slave to drink wine or become impure (see Mishneh Torah, Laws of Nazariteship 1).",

Therefore, if one made a nazirite vow at this time, behold, he is a nazirite forever. As now, on account of our afflictions, we have no [Temple in order] to offer the sacrifices at the end of the period of being a nazirite.

                "<b>That the nazirite not become impure through a dead body or through other impurities:</b> That the nazirite not become impure through a dead body, as it is stated (Numbers 6:7), \"For his father or for his mother, etc. he shall not become impure, etc.\" Even though I have already written the reason for the distancing of impurity from that which is holy in the first commandment of this Order (Sefer HaChinukh 362), I will still say that which comes to my spirit about the reason of the great stringency with the nazirite; as he is commanded not to become impure even for his father and his mother and - there is no need to say - other relatives, and [yet] a regular priest who is also holy, may become impure for [his close relatives]. And the matter is apparently because the holiness of the priest rests upon him automatically. He did not agree to it and it was not from his consent, but rather he was sanctified from birth and from the womb, by force of his tribe which is totally holy. And [so] his behavior towards his relatives is like all other people, since there is no difference between the priestly man and the rest of the people, except that sometimes he will do the service for his God. However, sometimes he will also dwell in his domicile and regale with his friends - he calls to his companions for joy and parties. Hence his heart will be warm towards them and theirs towards him. And because of this, the Torah permitted [him] to become impure for them - 'all the ways of the Torah are pleasant and all of its paths are peace.'",
                "However the man that is a nazirite to God is holy to God all the days of his nazirite vows and - as the verse attests to him (Numbers 6:7) - \"as the crown of his God is upon him,\" he will not become impurified with worldly desires, and he will not be found at parties and the banquets of his companions. As his separation from wine shows about him that he has given his heart to prepare himself and to afflict himself before God, to improve the ways of his soul and to leave the pleasures of the benighted body. And since he has placed all of his heart and all of his thoughts towards his dear soul and he has abandoned all of his own needs and those of his flesh, what would be his desire for the drawing close of his companions and his friends - besides for the commandment, without a doubt. As with the raising of the soul, the pleasures of the body and all of its matters become very light in its eyes. All the more so will it not seek the company of other bodies, whether they be relatives or [others], and it will not find delight in any of their things, besides the holy service to which it is connected and to which its eyes are always directed. And hence from his great holiness and separation from his brothers, the Torah prevents him from becoming impure for them. And [it is] like the matter of the high priest - as since his  matters are very elevated and he is separated from the company of his friends, and his pursuits and thoughts are only about the service of his God, may He be blessed, the Torah prevents him from becoming impure for anyone of his relatives. And the stated explanation for his distancing from impurity is also stated about the nazirite; except that with the priest, it mentions oil, since he is anointed with it, but with the nazirite, it does not mention oil. As with the priest, it states (Leviticus 21:22), \"as the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him.\" But with the nazirite, it [only] states, \"as the crown of his God is upon him.\" And maybe you will think to respond to me, that when a temporary nazirite finishes his time, he will return to his obliviousness and chase after his desires; and, if so, why should he be more stringent than a regular priest? The answer is that after a person takes on being a nazirite one time, there is hope  for him to sanctify himself and to add to his goodness each day. And he will be agreed to from the Heavens and like the matter that they, may their memory be blessed, said (Shabbat  104a), \"One who comes to purify himself, is assisted.\" And since he has taken on being a nazirite even one day, he is assisted and will finish all of his days in purity.",
                "From the laws of the commandment is that which they, may their memory blessed, said (Nazir 49b) that there is a [type of] impurity of a dead body that if the nazirite is made impure by it, he shaves and it interrupts his earlier [tally of] days, and begins to count the days of his naziriteness afterwards [from the beginning]; and there is [another type of] impurity of a dead body for which he does not shave and it does not interrupt his earlier days. [And the latter is such,] even though it is an impurity [that makes impure for] seven [days] (characteristic of impurity generated by a dead body); because it is not said about it, \"and if he becomes impure for a soul,\" but rather (Numbers 6:9), \"And if a dead body dies upon him\" - which implies [only] when he becomes impure with impurities which are from the essence of the dead body. And these are the impurities for which the nazirite must shave: for a stillborn embryo, even if its limbs have not become attached to its tendons; for a <i>kazayit</i> from a dead body; for a <i>kazayit</i> of the discarded (<i>netsel</i>); for the bones that make up the numerical majority of the bones, even if they do not constiture one quarter of a <i>kav</i>; for half a <i>kav</i> of bones, even if they do not constitute the majority of its structure or their numerical majority, so long as all of the bones are from one dead body and not from two dead bodies; for a backbone coming from a dead body; for the skull of one dead body; for the [detached] limb of a living person that has [enough] flesh to grow back on a living person; for half a <i>log</i> of blood from one dead body; and for a fist-full of rotted remains of a dead body. And what is <i>netsel</i>? It is flesh of a dead body that is dissolved and has become rotten liquid. And the rotten remains (<i>rakav</i>) of a dead person only render impure if he is buried naked in a marble coffin and he is all complete. If one limb was lacking from him or if he was buried with his cloak or in a coffin of boneware or metal, [his remains] are not [considered] <i>rakav</i>. And they only spoke about <i>rakav</i> regarding a dead body alone, which excludes someone killed, as behold, he is missing his blood. If they buried two dead bodies together or they cut his hair or his fingernails and buried them with him, or if a pregnant woman died and she was buried [with] the embryo in her innards and so [too,] if [someone] ground the dead body until it became <i>rakav</i>, their <i>rakav</i> does not render impure until [the body itself] rots on its own. And so [too,] if he became impure from a quarter [of a <i>kav</i>] of bones that come from the backbone or from the skull in their tent, behold it is a doubt whether he is impure. ",
                "[Regarding] all of these twelve [types of] impurity that we have enumerated - if the nazirite touched one of them or if he carried it, or if the nazirite hovered over it or the impurity hovered over the nazirite or the nazirite and one of the impurities were [together] in a tent (under anything over them) - behold he must shave the shaving of (caused by) impurity, and he brings a sacrifice for impurity and it interrupts all [of the days of his tally]. [This is true of all of the impurities] except for <i>rakav</i>, which does not render impure with touch, as it is impossible for him to touch it all, as behold, it is not one body. But if he carries it or becomes impure in its tent, he must shave. And so [too,] a nazirite who touches a bone of a dead body - even a bone that is [the size] of a barley grain - or he carries it, behold, this one must shave for it and bring a sacrifice for impurity and interrupts the previous [days]. But one [single] bone does not render impure in a tent.",
                "But if he became impure from a clod of the land of the [other] peoples or of a field in which a grave was plowed - which render impure through touch and carrying; or if one of the twelve impurities mentioned was hovered over by shoots coming out of trees or protrusions coming out of a fence or a bed or a camel and that which is similar to it and he become impure in their hovering; or from a quarter  [of a <i>kav</i>] of bones that do not constitute the majority of its structure or their numerical majority; or he became impure from a quarter [of a <i>log</i>] of blood - even though it renders impure through touch and carrying and in a tent; or he became impure from a grave-covering or [its] frame - which renders impure through touch and carrying; or he became impure from a limb from a living person or from a limb from a dead person, which does not have flesh that is fit, according to the matter that we described - behold this does not interrupt, even though he is impure from an impurity [that makes impure for] seven [days] and he sprinkles on the third and on the seventh, [nonetheless] he does not shave the shaving of impurity and he does not bring sacrifices and he does not interrupt the first ones. However all of the days of impurity do not count for him in the tally of the days of being a nazirite.",
                "And so [too,] from the matter of the commandment is that which they said (Nazir 44a), that one who causes a nazirite to become impure - if the nazirite was volitional - [the nazirite] is given lashes, and the one who rendered him impure transgresses on account of \"in front of a blind man, etc.\" (Leviticus 19:14). But if the nazirite is indavertent, [even] if the one who makes him impure is volitional, neither one of them is lashed. And why is the one who makes him impure not lashed? Because it is stated (Numbers 6:9), \"and he makes impure the head of his naziriteness\" - meaning to say that the liability for lashes is only when he becomes impure with his consent. [These] and the rest of its details are in Tractate Nazir.",

And Rambam, may his memory be blessed, wrote (Sefer Ha Mitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Ase 93) that the two shavings of the nazirite - which are the shaving of impurity and the shaving of purification - are only fitting to be counted as one commandment; as the matter of the shaving of impurity is not a separate commandment at all, but rather one law of the laws of  naziriteness. [That is] that the Scripture elucidated that if the nazirite becomes impure in the days of his being a nazirite, he must shave and bring a sacrifice and then he goes back to growing his locks in holiness for the days of naziriteness that he forbade to himself, like at the start. [It is] like the leper who also has two shavings and they are one commandment. And since it is not the essence of the commandment, but rather one law of its laws, it is not fitting to count it as a separate commandment - and as the Teacher, may his memory be blessed, elucidated in his Book of the Commandments in the Seventh Root. And in the Order of Zot Tehiyeh (Metsora), I have also written in the name of the Teacher, may his memory be blessed, the reason for our counting the shaving of the nazirite and his sacrifices as one commandment, and the shaving of the leper and his sacrifices as two commandments.

(Sotah 38b, Mishneh Torah, Laws of Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 14:3-4) At the time the prayer leader reaches the [blessing of] service, meaning to say when he wants to begin to say the blessing of <i>Retseh</i>, all the priests in the synagogue go up to the platform [with] their faces towards the ark, their backs towards the people, and their fingers bent upon their palms, until the prayer leader finishes the blessing of thanksgiving. And afterwards, they turn their faces towards the people, extend their fingers and raise their hands across from their shoulders and begin, \"May He bless you.\" And the prayer leader dictates to them word by word, as it is stated, \"say to them\"; and they repeat after him with a pleasant tone.

And our custom today is that the priests do not go up to the platform, but rather stand in front of the ark and follow the [rest of the] order that we have written. ",

In [future] generations, however, the Kohanim were obligated in this commandment - and they shall carry it - as is elucidated from the Book of Joshua and the Book of Samuel.",
                "And Rabbi Moshe ben Nachman (Nachmanides), may his memory be blessed, wrote (in his glosses to the Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam on the third Shoresh, s.v. veraiti)  that that which the teacher said that the commandment was moved to the Kohanim is not true. God forbid that we should say that any commandment in the Torah changed, that the Levites were disqualified from carrying the Ark forever, and that he explained it well. [As we see that] the Levites carried it in the days of David, as it is stated (I Chronicles 15:26), \"And it was in God's assisting the Levites who were carriers of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord,\" and it is written (I Chronicles 15:27), \"And all the Levites who were carrying the Ark, etc.\" But in truth, both the Kohanim and Levites are acceptable for carrying the Ark from Torah writ. As they are all called Levites, as it is written (Ezekiel 44:15), \"the Levite Kohanim.\" And so [too,] is it written (I Chronicles 15:14-15), \"And the Kohanim and Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the Ark of the Lord, the God of Israel, as Moshe had commanded by the word of the Lord, with the poles on their shoulders.\" And they said in the Sifrei, \"Where did He command [this]?  [From the verse] 'And to the sons of Kehat was not given any other, etc.'\" - as they are all called the sons of Kehat. And he also wrote [regarding] what Maimonides, may his memory be blessed, wrote that it is elucidated from the Book of Joshua and Samuel, that he did not find this elucidation. Rather, he found the opposite, as it is stated there (Joshua 3:3), \"And he commanded the people saying, 'When you see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, your God, that is carried by the Kohanim, Levites.\" Rather, the truth is as we have said, that the whole tribe is eligible to carry the Ark. Moreover, the thing is explicit in Tractate Sotah 33b, where they, may their memory be blessed, said, \"How did the Israelites cross the Jordan?  Every day the Levites carried the Ark, and on this day it was carried by the Kohanim.\"  That is, on the day that they crossed the Jordan, only the Kohanim carried it, as so is it written (Joshua 3:6), \"And Yehoshua said to the Kohanim, 'Carry the Ark of the Covenant'\" - so that the miracle would be done by the Kohanim, as they are the holiest members of the tribe.",
                "It also seems that that which Maimonides, may his memory be blessed, said that it is elucidated in Joshua is from this verse, but it is not a clear elucidation at all, as we have said.  And that which is stated in I Kings 8:1, \"And the Kohanim brought the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord to its place, to the sanctuary, to the Holy of Holies\" should also not be difficult in your eyes. It is because the Levites were not permitted to enter the Holy of Holies that only the Kohanim brought it in.  And [so] the main approach seems to be like the words of Nachmanides, may his memory be blessed, that the entire tribe is fit to carry the Ark; and as it is written (II Chronicles 35:3), \"And he said to the Levites, etc. 'place the Holy Ark in the Temple that was built by Solomon son of David, the king of Israel, there is no longer a burden on your shoulders.'\" Its matter is also that Israel would have no more need to carry the Ark form one place to another; but it does not indicate that if it were to move it, that it would not be done by the Levites, and this is clear and obvious to all.  And [regarding] that which the Sages said (Chullin 24a) [that] blemishes disqualify the Kohanim but years do not, it is only the priestly duties that are not affected by age, but age does disqualify the Kohanim for the labor of carrying, as it does for the Levites (see Mishneh Torah, Laws of Vessels of the Sanctuary and Those who Serve Therein 2).",
                "It is from the roots of the commandment that it is because the main glory of Israel is the Torah, through which they were made distinct from the other peoples and made into the portion of God. And it is therefore fitting and proper that it should be carried by the most dignified and holy people among us. And there is no need to elaborate on matters that any school child can understand. The entire content of the commandment is elucidated in the verse, and that is that the Kohanim and Levites would carry the Ark on their shoulders whenever they needed to move it from place to place, such as during war or for some other thing; and they would not carry it in a wagon or the back of an animal. And the Sages already castigated David for being mistaken about a thing that even toddlers read about, in his placing the Ark on a wagon (Sotah 34a).",

But today, on account of our iniquitis, we have no king and no Ark to carry in any place. And this commandment is incumbent upon the tribe of Levi; and upon the rest of the people to support them. And that to which they are accustomed today in the Diaspora to bring out the Torah to greet the [non-Jewish] kings is not governed by this commandment at all, as any of the Children of Israel may carry it.

This is the firm pillar of our faith and our Torah, for people who believe in the eternity of the universe have no Torah and no share in the World to Come. This thing is well-known and there is no need to elaborate on well-known matters.  Therefore, it was His will, blessed be He, to allow every man of Israel to merit in this important commandment, and that an accident or long-distance not impede him from fulfilling it. Rather, 'if trouble will occur to him' and he is prevented in the first month and he did not do it with the earlier ones, he may do it in the second month.  And since this is a great fundamental principle in our religion, the obligation even extends to a convert who converted between the first Pesach and the second, and so [too, to] a child who reached maturity between the two Pesachs - that they are obligated to [offer] the <i>Pesach Sheni</i> sacrifice (see Mishneh Torah, Laws of Paschal Offering 6:7).",
                "From the laws of the commandment is that which they, may their memory be blessed, taught in Pesachim 95a in the chapter [entitled] Mi Shehaya Tamei, \"What [are the differences] between first and second? On the first all leaven is forbidden to be seen or kept in one's possession; on the second both leaven and matsa are with him in the house. The second is only observed one day, and there is no holiday or prohibition of labor. The first requires Hallel while eating it; the second does not require Hallel while eating it - though this and that require Hallel during the offering. Both are eaten roasted with matsa and marror,\" as it is explicitly stated like that in the verse.  \"Both supersede the Shabbat, and neither may be left over or have bones broken in them,\" as the verse explicitly warns about this too, with \"do not leave over\" and \"they shall not break a bone in it.\"",
                "And if you ask, my son, why they are not completely equal, as behold, the verse explicitly states with respect to the <i>Pesach Sheni</i> sacrifice, \"according to all the laws of the Pesach sacrifice shall you make it\"; you should know that the Sages, may their memory be blessed, already alerted us to this. And they clarified in the chapter [entitled] Mi Shehaya Tamei (Pesachim 95a) that the verse refers only to details that pertain to the body of the Pesach sacrifice, such as eating it with matsa and marror, not leaving any over, and not breaking bones, as we have explained. They taught us this from [the fact] that the verse singled out a few laws here with <i>Pesach Sheni</i>, while if the laws were truly identical it would have been sufficient to simply state, \"according to all the laws of the Pesach sacrifice, etc.\" And so they said, \"Just as the bone is remarkable in that is part of the body, so too anything, etc.\"",
                "Also relevant to this commandment is that which they also said (Pesachim 93a) that the impure person that is delayed to <i>Pesach Sheni</i> is one who is impure in a severe way that impedes him from eating the Pesach sacrifice, such as someone who experienced a flow, or a menstruant, or a new mother,  or one who had intercourse with a menstruant or someone who became impure through contact with the dead under circumstances that would require a nazirite to shave, as we explained in the Order of Nasso (Sefer HaChinukh 376). But if he became impure from the other impurities of the dead body for which the nazirite does not shave, and so [too,] if he touched a carcass or a crawling animal (<i>sherets</i>), or something like it - even on the fourteenth - behold, he will immerse [in the mikveh]  and they slaughter [the Pesach sacrifice] after he immerses; and in the evening when the sun has set for him, he eats his Pesach sacrifice. Also  relevant to this commandment is that which they, may their memory be blessed, said there in the chapter [entitled] Mi Shehaya Tamei (Pesachim 93b) that a 'far distance' with regard to the established law [means anything] that is fifteen <i>mil</i> outside of the walls of Jerusalem, but less than that is not called a far distance. And the rest of its details are in Tractate Pesachim (see Mishneh Torah, Laws of Paschal Offering 5).",
                "This commandment is practiced at the time of the [Temple] - by males in the category of obligation, and by females in the category of the optional. As so did they, may their memory be blessed, instruct us  (Pesachim 91b) [regarding] women who were delayed to <i>Pesach Sheni</i> because of impurity or because of one of the things that we mentioned, that the offering of the <i>Pesach Sheni</i> sacrifice is optional for them: If they wish [to], they slaughter, if they wish [not to], they do not slaughter. And for this reason we may not slaughter only on their behalf on the Shabbat. And a man who transgresses this and volitionally violated this positive commandment and did not bring the <i>Pesach Sheni</i> sacrifice, after he was under duress and was unable to offer the first Pesach sacrifice, is liable for excision. This is the opinion of Rabbi [Yehudah HaNasi] in the Mishnah (Pesachim 93a). But Rabbi Natan, Rabbi Chaninah and Rabbi Akiva exempt him from excision, as he was not volitional in the first case. And we need not say that if he deliberately [did not partake of a sacrifice] the first time, and he also violated the second, whether willfully or not, that he incurs excision according to all, as he deliberately failed to offer the sacrifice of God in its proper time.  And this is one of two positive commandments for which the punishment is excision, as we explained in the Order of Bo el Pharoah (Sefer HaChinukh 5)."

As they would blow with the trumpets over the sacrifice every day in the Temple. And so is it explained in Rosh HaShannah 29a: \"Everyone is obligated in the blowing of the shofar - priests, Levites, and Israelites.\" And the Talmud wonders about this in the Gemara, \"Is this not obvious? [For] if they are not obligated, who would be obligated?\" And it responds to it, \"It was necessary [to say] priests, for it may enter your mind to say, 'Since it is written (Numbers 29:1), \"It is a day of blowing, etc.,\" [you might have said that with regard to one who is obligated to sound only one day, he is obligated to sound the shofar on Rosh HaShanah.] But these priests, since they are [obligated] all year long, as it is written (Numbers 10:10), \"you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt-offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace-offerings, etc.\" [you might say that they are not obligated].'\" The Talmud then asks, \"Are they similar? There it is a trumpet and here it is a shofar!\" Nevertheless, we learned [from this] that throughout the whole year - meaning to say on each and every day - there were trumpets in the Temple.

As since man is physical, he requires great arousal to these things. For the way of nature is to stand asleep, and there is nothing as arousing as the sounds of music, [as is] well known - and all the more so, the sounds of trumpets, which is the greatest sound of all musical instruments. And there is also another purpose, aside from arousal to focusing attention, that is realized through the sound of the trumpet; and that is that the sound of the trumpets removes all other worldly concerns from the heart of the listener, such that at that time he will only [direct] his heart to the matter of the sacrifice. But why should I go on so long? This is well-known to anyone who has ever bent his ear to hear the trumpets or the sound of a shofar with focus.",

As behold, they explicitly said (Mishnah Tamid 7:3), \"They gave him the wine to pour [for the libation]. The assistant stood on the horn [of the altar] with two handkerchiefs in his hand. Two priests stood in the table of (used for) fats and two trumpets were in their hands. They blew a <i>teki'ah</i> (long steady sound), then a <i>teruah</i> (a series of very short sounds) and then again a <i>teki'ah</i>.\" Behold, it is elucidated that this commandment was performed by the priests, and that it was a constant commandment to them, meaning to say that they would blow every day, and not only on a holiday or the day of the new month.  However, I have seen that Rambam wrote (Mishnah Torah, Vessels of the Sanctuary and Those who Serve Therein 3:5), \"On all the festivals and on the the new moon days, the priests would sound the trumpets and the Levites would sing.\" It seems from his words that his opinion is that on other days, even the Levites blow the trumpets.

And the five types of grain that are obligated in <i>challah</i> are wheat, barley, spelt, oats, and rye; as it is stated (Numbers 15:19), \"And it shall be when you eat from the bread of the land\" - and only loaves made from these are called bread. And they all combine to [constitute] the measurement [of what requires the separation] of <i>challah</i>. And if one did not separate <i>challah</i> from the dough, he may separate it from the bread; as it says, \"when you eat from the bread,\" which teaches that bread is also obligated.  Even if one first kneaded a quantity that was insufficient [to be obligated] in <i>challah</i>, if he then kneaded another batch and mixed the whole loaf into one vessel that has an interior, such that the two combine to the requisite measurement,  the vessel combines them [to be obligated in] <i>challah</i>. I heard from my teacher, may God protect him, that this is only if the bread was taken from the oven and put into a vessel that has an interior, but if it was placed on a board or on the floor, or anything else that has no interior, even though they were subsequently placed into a basket, they are already exempt from <i>challah</i>. This is what they meant when they said, \"one who removes it into a basket;\" it is only if it went from the oven to the basket at the time of [their] removal. And there is no need to say that the oven does not serve to combine [to obligate in] <i>challah</i> (Mishneh Torah, Laws of First Fruits and other Gifts to Priests Outside the Sanctuary 6:16).

The Sages however obligated us (Mishnah Challah 2:7) to separate 1/24th, which they based upon what the verse stated about this commandment, \"give to the Lord,\" meaning that the gift should be dignified, and this was [the amount] that they estimated. A baker who prepares his [dough] for sale in the market - and [the dough] is large, and he also needs to make a profit - was only obligated to give 1/48th.

As in all these cases it is called bread, since the law is not like the view (Pesachim 37a) that bread is only what is baked in an oven alone.

And they even give it to an adult priest who has immersed [to purify himself from genital flows]. And even though he is impure due to contact with the dead, they give him to eat it in these places. It also seems that another leniency outside of Israel is that one may deliberately cancel it out by a majority [of permissible matter], as it [is found] in Tractate Yevamot (it should read, Bekhorot 27a) and in other places in the Gemara.

Therefore, if there was a minor priest boy outside of Israel - whether in Syria or other lands - if they want to, they may separate one <i>challah</i> as 1/48th and it may be given to eat to a minor priest boy who has not yet seen a seminal emission or to a minor priest girl who has not yet menstruated, and there is no need to do a second separation to burn it. Also, if there is a an adult priest there who has immersed [to purify himself from genital flows] - even if the sun has not yet set for him [on the day of his immersion], and even though he is impure from contact with the dead - he may eat this first <i>challah</i>, and there is no need to do a second separation outside of Israel.\" To here [are the words of Rambam]."

And there is no better reminder in the world than carrying the seal of the Master on the clothes that one wears at all times, as a person is [always attentive] to his clothes. And this is what is stated in the verse (Numbers 15:39), \"and you will recall all the commandments of the Lord.\" And they, may their memory be blessed, said (Midrash Tanchuma, Korach 12) that the word '<i>tsitsit</i>' alludes to the six hundred and thirteen commandments (in the numerical equivalent of the letters) when combined with the eight strings of the fringes and their five knots. And my heart also tells me that there is a reminder and allusion here that the soul and body of man all belong to God, Blessed be He. As the white portion corresponds to the body which is from the land, which was made from the snow, which is white, as we find in Pirkei D'Rabbi Eliezer 3, \"From where is the land from?  From the snow that is under the Holy Throne.” And the threads [also] allude to the body, as the matter that they said, that the initial formation of a body is like threads.

And they hinted to this in their saying (Menachot 47b), \"What [makes] <i>tekhelet</i> different than all other colors? Because <i>tekhelet</i> is like the sea, and the sea is like the sky, and the sky is like the Throne of Glory, as it is stated (Exodus 24:10), 'And they saw the God of Israel, etc.' and it states (Ezekiel 1:26), 'The Throne appeared as sapphire stone'\" - and the souls of the righteous are stored underneath the Throne. And because of this, they said (Menachot 39a) that we wrap the string of <i>tekhelet</i> around the white, as the soul is above and the body below. They said that we make seven or thirteen windings [around the white strings] to allude to the heavens and the divisions between them.

And what they said (Menachot 38a) that the <i>tekhelet</i> does not impede the white [strings] and the white does not impede the <i>tekhelet</i>, which does not mean that they are actually two commandments, as it is all one commandment, but it means that that they do not impede one another. [This is the case] today where we cannot find <i>tekhelet</i>, such that we should still not hesitate to put white fringes without <i>tekhelet</i> onto our garments, and recite the blessing upon them as if it were complete with the <i>tekhelet</i>. Also - when the <i>tekhelet</i> is available - if one has no white strings, he may place the <i>tekhelet</i> on his garment, wrap himself in its garment and recite the blessing upon it.",

And it is found in the Dead Sea, and we dye a string of wool in it. And it has been many days for Israel that we have not heard of anyone who merited [having] <i>tekhelet</i> in his talit. It must be dyed for the sake of its commandment, and the white strings also must be spun for the sake of the commandment. We may not use wool that was caught in thorns when the herd was crouching, nor from hairs that were torn from the animal, nor from the remnant left over from the loom, nor from stolen wool nor wool from a condemned city (of Jewish idolaters), nor from consecrated wool. If [any of these was used,] it is disqualified. Fringes that were spun (some have the textual variant, 'hung') by a non-Jew are disqualified, as it is stated, \"Speak to the Children of Israel […] and they shall make.\" But if a Jew made them without [proper] intention, it is fit, [nonetheless] ex post facto. And I have heard from great scholars that the making of fringes by women is not fit (see Rabbenu Tam, which is brought in the Ramah on Shulchan Arukh, Orach Chayim 12:1).",
                "How are the fringes made? (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Fringes 1:6) Four strings are passed through the corner of the garment, such that there are now eight ends hanging from the corner. This is not done precisely at the corner, but [a half-]thumb's distance from the edge, as Rabbi Yaakov said that Rabbi Yochanan said in the Gemara (Menachot 42a), \"It must be one large joint away.\" One of the strings should be longer so that it can be used for winding [around] the others. Five double knots are tied (Tosafot on Menachot 39a, s.v. <i>lo</i>); and between each knot, he makes three rings (windings), and between the final knot, four rings, so that there are a total of thirteen rings. The strings are made long so that it be enough for two [thirds] of the length to be branching; meaning to say without the knots and rings, besides the knots and rings. This is the main [approach to the] ideal fulfillment of the commandment. But ex post facto, even one ring suffices, and so [too,] ex post fact, even if the strings of the fringes shorten, even if there is only enough to make a basic bow, it is fit (Menachot 38b). But if even one string is completely torn, it is disqualified.",
                "And one who owns a four cornered garment is not required to put fringes on it so long as he does not wear it.  And the law is like [the view] of Rav who said, (Menachot 42a) [that] fringes is an obligation on the man, meaning that the obligation is for a person to put fringes on a garment when he wears it. But he is not obligated to put fringes on a garment that is sitting in a drawer, as the law is not like the other view, that it is an obligation on the garment itself. [This] would mean that if a person had many four cornered garments in his home, he would be obligated to put fringes on all of them, even if he never wears them. [But] this is not [the case], as the law is like Rav, as we have said.",
                "And if one has a linen garment, he should place linen fringes in it, for the law is not like [the view of] Beit Shammai who taught (Menachot 40a) that a [linen] cloak is exempted from fringes. [This] means to say that since a linen garment could never have <i>tekhelet</i> placed on it, because [it would form] a forbidden mixture [of wool and linen] - as <i>tekhelet</i> must always be wool, since the <i>tekhelet</i> dye  would never be absorbed properly by linen but rather only by wool, and the Torah obligates us in proper <i>tekhelet</i> - and since it would be impossible to ever put a string of wool into the linen because of the forbidden mixture, even white strings, meaning strings of linen, are not put on. This is what [they meant when] they said that Beit Shammai exempts a [linen] cloak from fringes. But the law is not like them, since their reason is because they did not expound adjacent verses; rather the law is like Beit Hillel who did expound adjacent verses. And they [therefore] held that there is no prohibition of forbidden mixtures in fringes, as the Torah stated (Deuteronomy 22:11-12), \"Do not wear <i>shaatnez</i> (wool and linen together). Make fringes for yourself\" - meaning to say, but fringes you may make for yourself from <i>shaatnez</i>. And therefore Beit Hillel held that a [linen] cloak is obligated in fringes, and the law is like them. Still, we do not put <i>tekhelet</i> on [a linen garment] due to a concern about indigo; that is, lest they would dye it with a non-<i>tekhelet</i> dye and then it would be <i>shaatnez</i> without the [performance of a] commandment. They asked in the Gemara in Menachot 40a, \"Why? Is it not just white [strings]?\"  That is, for Beit Hillel who did expound adjacent verses, why should we make such a decree? As even if it is indigo, what is with that? Behold, we said that the forbidden mixture is permitted in fringes, meaning even with white [strings] - that is to say, even to put fringes of white wool in a garment of linen  - and it is not [even] necessary to say that [it would be allowed] with fringes of wool that are dyed with <i>tekhelet</i> as is its commandment. And it was answered that these words that Beit Hillel said forbidden mixtures were permitted in fringes on the [strength of the] expounding of adjacent verses is only in cases where there is not from it; meaning to say when it is impossible from its own type - e.g.  in a linen garment, if you want to place <i>tekhelet</i> in it, you will need wool regardless, as <i>tekhelet</i> is impossible without wool. [Only] in such cases did Beit Hillel rely on the expounding of adjacent verses and obligate the use of <i>tekhelet</i> in a linen garment. If however, there is 'from it,' meaning to say where you want to use white strings without <i>tekhelet</i> in a linen garment, it is not acceptable to use wool on the strength of the expounding of adjacent verses, as those white strings can be made of linen. This [follows] the principle of Reish Lakish; as Reish Lakish said that in any case where it is possible to maintain both the positive and negative commandments it is better [to do so], and only otherwise do we say that the positive commandment supersedes the negative. And here it is possible to maintain both commandments, for if you do not wish to place <i>tekhelet</i> with the white, linen suffices. And since this is so, if you use wool [you have violated the law of] forbidden mixtures and there is nothing [to help you]. Because there are many interpretations of these matters, I have spent some time on it for you. And from what I found in my trap I have set the table for you. But if you merit, my son, you will distinguish the truth. And if you perhaps find valid reason to challenge my words in this matter - or even in another - you should not mind the honor of your father and teacher, and I will then read (consider) your destruction as building.",
                "And know that even though this commandment is only obligated by the Torah when he has a four cornered garment (Mishneh Torah 3:18) - like there is no obligation for the commandment [to build a] parapet unless one has a roof - the Sages still warned much about this commandment and said (Menachot 41a) that it is fitting to pursue it. They also said (Shabbat 32b) that a person who is careful [in the fulfillment of this commandment] will merit to be waited upon by many servants, as the Torah equated it to and depended upon it the fulfillment of all the other commandments, as it is stated, \"And you will see it and remember all the commandments of the Lord.\" And Rabbi Elazar said that one who is careful in this and tefillin and mezuzah is assured that he will never sin, as it is stated (Ecclesiastes 4:12), \"The three fold thread will not easily break.\"",

And one who transgressed it and wore a wool or linen garment - that meets the size requirements above and it is his - without fringes has violated this positive commandment. And if it is [made] from other materials he has nullified a rabbinic commandment. But if it is not his own garment but rather it is borrowed, it is exempt for all thirty days.

Rather, if the spirit to pursue these bad opinions should arise, one should minimize his thinking about them, and redouble his efforts to contemplate the true and good ways of the Torah. Similarly, one should not pursue the things he sees; and included in this is that we not  pursue after the desires of this world, for in the end they are evil and 'there is much shame and wrath.' This is [the meaning of] what they, may their memory be blessed, said (Berakhot 12b), \"'Do not stray after your hearts' refers to apostasy.

And if a person dies before having children, there is no record of the progeny; so it emerges that this prevention is the root that all good comes from. Understand my son, and let it be a jewel in your mouth, that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Avot 4:2), \"One sin leads to another, and one commandment leads to another.\" As if you allow yourself to fulfill your evil desire one time, you will be drawn after it many times. But if you merit to be 'mighty in the land' and to conquer your evil inclination and close your eyes from seeing evil one time, it will be easier for you to do so many times.  As lust pulls the body like wine draws the drinker. Drunkards can never be sated by wine, but they will rather have a great desire for it. And according to [the large quantity that] they have gotten themselves accustomed, the stronger their desire will become. And if only they would drink a cup of water, it would temper the burning fire of [their] desire for wine, and make it pleasant for them. The same is true here: The more a person allows himself to be governed by his desires and to allow them to become habit, the stronger his evil inclination becomes every day.

But we do not administer lashes for this negative commandment, because there is no specific thing for which the transgressor can be warned, as man is made in such a way that it is impossible for his eyes not to sometimes see more than what is fitting, and it is similarly impossible for his thought not to sometimes go beyond what is fitting, so it is impossible to limit a man with clear boundaries about this. Also, this negative commandment can be transgressed without any deed at all; and I already wrote earlier (Sefer HaChinukh 346) that for any negative commandment that can be transgressed without a deed - even if a person does a deed - it seems that no lashes are administered to him."

He appointed food and drink for him, honey and milk to bring him joy, and appointed two ministering angels to guard him in his mother's womb, as it is written (Job 10:12), 'with life and kindness, etc.'\"  His mother says, \"This is my firstborn son, with which God opened the doors of my belly.\" His father says, \"This is my first-born and I am warned about redeeming him, as it is stated (Exodus 13:13), 'and all the first-born of man, your sons shall you redeem.' May it be the will in front of You, Lord, my God, that as You have allowed his father to merit to redeem him, so too should you allow him to merit Torah, marriage and good deeds. Blessed are You, Lord, who sanctified the first born of Israel to be redeemed.\"  The father of the son then recites two blessings: 'on the redemption of the first born'; and 'Who has allowed us to live.' He gives the well-known redemption to the priest, which is five <i>sela</i>, as specified in the Torah. This is equal to sixty <i>argents</i> of refined silver in our land. And after the redemption, the priest recites these  three blessings that we wrote.",
                "Ramban, may his memory be blessed, also wrote that when the father gives the money to the priest he should first give the child into the priest's hand, and the priest should say, \"Which is more beloved to you, your son or these five <i>sela</i>?\" And the father responds, \"My son is more beloved to me.\"  The priest immediately takes the silver coins and passes them over the head of the son and says, \"This is in the place of this, traded for this, this is rendered no longer sacred through this. This goes out to the priest and this child should come to life and Torah and fear of heaven. May it be His will that as this one came to redemption, may he also come to Torah, marriage and good deeds, and let us say amen.\" The priest places his hands on the son's head and blesses him, according to how he knows to bless him, such as \"May the Lord guard you, etc.\" (Psalms 121:5), or \"As length of days and years of life, etc.\" (Proverbs 3:2) or \"The Lord shall protect you from all evil and guard your soul, etc.\" (Psalms 121:7). And [the father] takes him out for all of his will. [This] and the rest of its details are elucidated in Tractate Bekhorot (see Tur, Yoreh Deah 308).",
                "This commandment is practiced in every place and at all times by male Israelites, but not by females. As we have in our tradition that only a man who is obligated to [potentially] redeem himself is obligated to redeem his son; but not a woman, who is not [in the category of] redemption. The commandment is also not practiced by priests and Levites (Bekhorot 4a) from an a fortiori argument (<i>kal vechomer</i>): If they could exempt Israelites from redemption of the firstborn in the wilderness, it follows that they would exempt themselves. They, may their memory be blessed, also said that even a son of an Israelite who has relations with a priestess or a Levite woman and his son is from her is exempt from redemption (Bekhorot 47a); since the matter is dependent upon the mother, as Scripture made it dependent on exiting the womb. And one who transgressed this and did not redeem his son from when he is fit, that is after thirty days have passed [from his birth]; if he dies before he has redeemed him, he has violated this positive commandment, and woe unto him for he carries his sin upon his soul. And even though there is no specified time for this commandment, as any time after thirty days have elapsed is appropriate, still the wise of heart will grab commandments and perform them at the first available moment, and 'the desire of God will prosper in his hand.' And it seems that the father is always obligated to redeem his son. And even after the son matures, the commandment is incumbent on the father, as the verse states (Exodus 13:17), \"And all the first-born of man, your sons you shall redeem\" - behold, that the commandment is made incumbent on the father. And so does it seems in Kiddushin."

Therefore this prevention came to us, that we should never redeem it. And even if one transgressed and  redeemed it, it is not redeemed. About this is it stated (Numbers 18:17), \"But the first-born of an ox, the first-born of a sheep, or the first-born of a goat should not be redeemed; they are sacred.\" The verse elucidated the three types of pure (domesticated) beasts that are subject to the commandment of the first-born, as the seven varieties of wild animals are not included in the law of firstborns, and as I explained in the Order of Bo (Sefer HaChinukh 17).

As since it stands to be offered as a sacrifice, the priest does not have the right to sell it. But at this time (when there is no Temple), since it is destined to be eaten, behold, it is permitted to sell it, even though it is unblemished - whether to a priest or an Israelite.\" To here [are his words]. Certainly about that which our Teacher, may his memory be blessed, said that it is destined to be eaten, his intention was to say, when it gets a blemish. And a blemished first-born can be sold by the priest at any time, whether the Temple [is standing] or whether the Temple [is not standing], whether it is alive or whether it is slaughtered, to any person, even a non-Jew, as it is completely non-sacred, as it is written (Deuteronomy 12:15), \"The pure and the impure together, like the gazelle and the deer.\" Still, the Sages warned  not to sell it in the marketplace in public, but rather at home. The rest of its details are elucidated in Tractate Bekhorot [Chapter 5] (see Tur, Yoreh Deah 306).",

And if one brought a first-born animal from outside the Land, they would not accept it from him and it may not be sacrificed, as it is completely non-sacred. Everyone is obligated in this commandment, priests, Levites, and Israelites, as it stated (Deuteronomy 15:19), \"Any first-born that is born, etc.\" (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Firstlings 1:7). And even though the priests and the Levites are exempt from redeeming the first-born of man and the one that exits the donkey, as we have written about each one of them in this Order (Sefer HaChinukh 392) and in the Order of Bo el Pharaoh (Sefer HaChinukh 22), they are obligated in this. And one who transgressed this and redeemed his first-born pure animal - even though his actions were not effective and it is not redeemed, but rather it is is  sacred as it was [before] - he has violated a negative commandment. As regarding the transgression of the negative commandment, [the efficacy of] the violation of a negative commandment does not concern us, as is found in the first chapter of Temurah (Temurah 4b), in the disagreement of Abbaye and Rava.

[Hence], we learn to say, 'And the Levite shall serve, he' - [even] against his will,\" meaning to say that this thing is an obligation, and that this matter is incumbent upon him perforce. And it is also elucidated in the second chapter of Arakhin 11a, that no one should ever say the song of the mouth (in the Temple) besides the Levite. And this commandment is repeated in the Torah with a different expression, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 18:7), \"And he shall serve in the name of the Lord, his God.\" And they said there in Arakhin, \"What is the service that is [done] in the name of the Lord?

And they would only say song with communal burnt-offerings that are obligatory and upon the peace-offerings of [Shavouot] at the time of the wine libation; but not over voluntary offerings that the community would make for the 'end of the altar.' And so [too], they would not say song upon libations that came on their own. A Levite who is bereaved (<i>onen</i>) is permitted to serve and sing. We do not ever decrease below twelve Levites that stand on the platform to say song over the sacrifice, but we [may] increase [as much as is wanted]. And the song that the Levites would say was with the mouth, as the crux of song is with the mouth. And others would stand there that would play musical instruments - some of them Levites and some of them pedigreed Israelites that [their family be permitted to] be married to [priests] - as only the pedigreed are ever able to go up to the platform. And we never reduce below nine lyres, but we [may] increase [as much as is wanted]. And there was only one cymbals. And it appears that the reason is that the sound of cymbals is loud and a bit frightening; and [so] if there were many, the rest of the musical instruments that were there would not be heard - all the more so, the song of the mouth. And the hollow of the flutes that they would play with were of reed, since their sound is pleasant. And the flute would strike [play] in front of the altar twelve days a year. And it pushes off the Shabbat, since it is [a part of] the service of the sacrifice, and the sacrifice pushes off the Shabbat. And a [Levite] does not come to the service until they teach him for five years. and as they, may their memory be blessed, learned from the verse. And from here, they, may their memory be blessed, said (Chullin 24a) that a student that does not see a good sign of (some success) for five years, will never see [it]. And he does not ever come to serve until he is an adult, as it is stated (Numbers 4:49), \"each man to his service.\" But a Levite is not disqualified by age and not by blemishes, but rather by deterioration of the voice, such as the old men whose voices deteriorate at the time of old age. And that which is stated in the Torah (Numbers 8:25), \"But at the age of fifty they shall retire from the legion of service\" is only at the time they were carrying the tabernacle from place to place. And even at the time of old age when his voice deteriorates, he is not disqualified from guarding the Temple and from closing the doors.

                "It is from the roots of the commandment [that] since God, may He be blessed, chose the tribe of Levi from among his brothers for his service in the Temple always, therefore it was from His kindness to them to give them their sustenance in an honorable way. As so is it proper for the servants of the King that their meals should be readied for them by others - that they should prepare it for them and that [the Levites] should not have to toil in anything besides the precious service of the King. And even though they were twelve tribes - and according to their equal portion, it would have been fitting that they take one twelfth part - this advantage to them is also for their glory. As since they are from the house of the King, it is fitting that their portion be more than all [the rest] of them. And it is a big advantage that the tenth part come to them free from all of the expenses of the land. And the blessing of God, may He be blessed, rests upon everything that belongs to the one who sustains the servants of God with his money. And this is what they, may their memory be blessed, said (Mishnah Avot 3:13), \"Tithes are a safeguarding fence around wealth.\" They, may their memory be blessed, also said (Taanit 9a) that it is forbidden for a person to think in his heart and say, \"I will test if God does good to me [for] my involvement in His commandments\"; and about that which is similar to this is it stated (Deuteronomy 6:16), \"Do not test the Lord, your God\" - except for in this commandment. As it is permitted to test if God will bless him [for] his doing it and [for] his being alacritous about it. And it is made explicit by the prophets, as it is stated (Malachi 3:10), \"Bring the entire tithe into the storehouse, etc. and put Me to the test with it, said the Lord.\"",
                "From the laws of the commandment is that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Yevamot 85b), that this tithe that is of the Levites is completely non-sacred (<i>chullin</i>) and [so] permissible for any man to eat - whether a Levite or whether an Israelite - and even in impurity, as it is stated (Numbers 18:27), \"This shall be accounted to you as your gift.\" [That is] to say that the tithe which is given as the tithe of Israel is for you \"as the grain from the threshing floor or the flow from the vat.\" And they, may their memory be blessed, expounded [that] just like the threshing floor and the vat are non-sacred for all purposes, so too is the first tithe that had its tithe taken non-sacred for all purposes. [And] the explanation of 'that had its tithe taken' is meaning to say after the Levites skimmed a tithe from their tithe and gave it to the priests. That is what is called 'its tithe.' And every place that it is stated about the tithe, \"holy\" or \"redemption\" is only about the second tithe. And they said in Sifrei that all that is food for people and guarded and its growth is from the earth is liable for the tithe and the priestly tithe (<i>terumah</i>). And they [derive] it from that it is written about the priestly tithe (Deuteronomy 18:4), \"The beginning of your grain, etc.\" As they, may their memory be blessed, expounded [that] just like grain, grapes and oil are food of people and its growth is from the earth and has owners, as it is stated, \"your grain\"; so too all that is similar to them are liable for the tithe and the priestly tithe. But even though vegetables are food of people, they are not liable for the tithe except rabbinically; as about the tithe it states (Deuteronomy 14:22), \"all the produce of your seed,\" and vegetables are not called 'produce.' But from the words of the Gemara that we rely upon more, it appears that also in all [other] fruits besides grain, grapes and oil, is there no liability for the tithe, except rabbinically. And [according to this,] the verse that was brought [as a prooftext] in the Sifrei was only a memory device (<i>asmakhta</i>). This is the conclusion in the beginning of the chapter [entitled] Hasokher et HaPoalim (Bava Metzia 88a) concerning that which Rav Pappa answered that the fig tree stood in the garden, but its branches leaned into the courtyard. However, Rambam, may his memory be blessed, wrote the opposite of this, and like he found [it] in the Sifrei. And so [too] from the topic of the commandment is that which they said that we do not separate the tithe of the new crop for the old crop, and not from the old for the new, not from that which is liable for that which is exempt and not from that which is exempt for that which is liable. And if one separated the tithe [like this], it is not [considered] a tithe. But we do take the tithe from that which is not encircled (close to the produce for which one is liable), even though it is not like this with the priestly tithe, as we only separate the priestly tithe from what is encircled. And nonetheless, with other things the tithe and the priestly tithe are the same; such that anything about which we say regarding the priestly tithe, \"we do not take the priestly tithe, but if one [took it], his priestly tithe is a [valid] priestly tithe - so [too,] with the tithe, if he separated it, his tithe is a [valid] tithe. And everything that is exempt from the priestly tithe is exempt for the tithe. And in the Order of Shoftim, we will write at greater length, with God's help, and you can see it there. And so [too] from the topic of the commandment is that which they, may their memory be blessed, said that a person is only obligated to separate the tithe from Torah writ if he finished [the work] on his fruit to eat them for himself, but one who finished them to sell them in the marketplace is exempted, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 14:22), \"You shall surely tithe, etc. and you shall eat.\" And so [too,] one who buys [the produce] after its work has been completed - meaning to say it was put in the threshing floor by the seller - is exempt from Torah writ, but obligated from the words [of the Rabbis], as it is stated, \"the produce of your seed,\" meaning to say that the work was finished in your domain. And the obligation of the tithe does not rest on the fruits until they reach the time of the tithe, as it is stated (Leviticus 27:30), \"from the seed of the land, from the fruit of the tree\"; meaning to say until it becomes a fruit. And from here, they, may their memory be blessed, learned that the time of the tithe is from when the fruits reach [when they could] be seeded and grow. Everything is according to what [the specific] fruit is. How is this? Figs, from when they become soft such that they are ready to eat; apples and citrons from when they turn round. And so [too,] with each and every fruit, they established its time for the tithe. That is to say until this time that is established for them, we can eat as much as we need, as they are not in the category of the tithe at all. But after this time, it can only be eaten casually, until their threshing floor designates them for the tithe. And after their threshing floor has designated them for the tithe, it is forbidden to eat from them, even casually. And what is their threshing floor with regard to the tithe? Produce from when it is flattened, meaning to say that he flattens its top with a shovel, in the way that people do when they make it into a heap. And in the Talmud Yerushalmi Ma'asrot 1:4, we have found further that if his intention is not to flatten [it], it is a threshing floor for [the designation of] the tithe from when he sets up a pile from his produce. As the verse made it dependent on the threshing floor, and even without flattening, when his intention is not to flatten [it]. And even if he makes a threshing floor of it inside his house; even there, the threshing floor creates the designation for the tithe. And that which Rav Oshaya said, \"A man may be crafty about his produce and bring it in with its chaff,\" so as to exempt it from the tithe - and it is a set law, as we say in Tractate Berakhot 31a - that is speaking when he did not set up a pile inside his house, and so [too,] that he did not flatten it, but rather that he pounded it and winnowed it, little by little without flattening, and put it into the storehouse, little by little. This is what appears in this matter; and in this way, all of the discussions go up in one 'stalk, healthy and well' (are all in agreement). And they, may their memory be blessed, said that the season of squash and watermelon and pumpkin is from when they are rubbed, meaning from when the thin hair that is upon them is removed; and the season of a basket of fruit is from when he covers the fruit inside of it with leaves and fronds. And so [too,] with each and every fruit, they established the time of its threshing floor, according to what it is - everything like it comes in Tractate Maasrot (Mishna Maasrot 1:5). And I have also seen about the topic of designating the tithe by Torah writ that the opinion of some of the commentators is that there is never designation for the tithe from any angle until there is seeing the face of the house (that the produce enter the home), and also that the house be fit for it, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 26:13), \"I have cleared out the consecrated from the house.\" And that is when he brought it in through the gate, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 26:12), \"and they shall eat in your gates and they shall be satiated.\" But if he brought them in through the roofs or the enclosures, they are exempt from the tithe and the priestly tithe. And so did Rambam, may his memory be blessed, write (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Tithes 4:2), \"It appears to me that we do not administer lashes from Torah writ for the eating of unseparated produce until they are designated by his bringing them into his house. But if it is designated with the other things that designate for the tithe, we do not administer lashes, besides [rabbinic] lashes of rebellion.\" [This] and the rest of its details are elucidated in Tractate Maasrot (see Tur, Yoreh Deah 338). ",
                "And it is practiced by males and females, by Israelites and by priests and by Levites. As even though the priests and the Levites take the tithe from [the Israelites], they are [still] obligated to tithe their [own] fruits on their lands. And it stands in the prohibition of unseparated fruit until they tithe them, as it is stated (Numbers 18:28), \"So shall you give, also you.\" And the explanation upon it comes, \"You\" [is] the Levites; \"also you\" [is] to include the priests. But after they tithe them; if they want, they can eat the tithe themselves, or [they can] give it to a different priest. And this commandment of the tithe and also the commandment of the priestly tithe is only practiced in the Land of Israel by Torah writ - so did Rambam, may his memory be blessed, determine. And in the Order of Shoftim in the commandment of separating the great priestly tithe, we will elucidate more, with God's help, the differences that there are in the tithe and in the priestly tithe between the Land of Israel and Syria or (other places) outside the Land.

And still, within that tribe itself, one [group] was selected to be the head, the officer and the minister over all of them - he and his seed forever, and it is the most sacred of all the tribe - to serve and to minister before God permanently. And He placed the rest of the whole tribe below it, to assist in the service - and as it states (Numbers 18:1), \"And the Lord spoke to Aharon saying, 'You, your sons, and your patriarchal lineage shall bear the iniquity of the Temple - meaning to say, that the entire tribe will receive the guarding of the Temple. \"But you and your sons with you will bear the iniquity of your priesthood\" - meaning to say that the primary service - that is the priesthood - is upon you. And it is written after it (Numbers 18:2), \"Also your brothers, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, bring close with you, and they shall accompany you and serve you\" - meaning to say that you are primary, and not them. And so [too,] is it written elsewhere (Numbers 3:9), \"And you shall give the Levites to Aharon and to his sons; they are truly given to him.\" And so, since the priests are 'the foundation of the home' in the service of our God, they merited twenty-four gifts that are given to them, which are explicit in Scripture, and as the Sages, may their memory be blessed, enumerated (Chullin 133b) - ten in the Temple, four in Jerusalem and ten [outside]. And the rest of the tribe that was chosen with it to assist it also merited to live [from gifts], without toil, with the tithe of the fruits that they take from all Israel. And in order that they know and contemplate that the cause of their portion being free and of the portion of their brothers is the service to God, they were commanded to give a tenth of all they take from the Children of Israel to the 'greater ministers.' And in this way, they will [remind themselves] that there are [others] above them, and that above all of them is the One Who guards all, may He be elevated. With this is also merit, honor and prestige for the Levites, without removing their names from the commandment of the tithe in their portion of the produce.

And now, the listener should not think that the matter of its secret and the matter of its being an arational commandment (<i>chok</i>) is that the ashes affect purification, as one will find a similar [process] with other sacrifices for the person with a discharge or a new mother, whose purification is completed by the offering of their sacrifices.  ",
                "The real wonder, so far as I have heard, is in its purifying the impure, yet rendering impure those involved in its burning. And even though the same is true for all burnt-offerings from cows and goats - that the one who burns them makes his clothes impure at the time that he burns them until they become ashes - nonetheless, their ashes do not purify. Also [part of] its great wonder is that the [process] is done outside of the camp, unlike the way of other offerings. And about this point the [other] nations [have a claim against] Israel, as they will think that it is offered to the demons in the open field, as is their practice today. And yet many medicinal herbs of the field and [medicinal] trees - from the cedars that are in Lebanon to the hyssop on the wall - are full of mysteries [that operate] in opposite [ways]. They heat the cold and cool the hot. And if we understood the nature of the spirit, its root, its illness and its health, we would also understand [perhaps] (about the sickness), since the mystery of the heifer is also to sicken the soul and render impure those who are involved in the burning, while its ashes heal from the sickness of impurity.

And [that] we do not take a calf and raise her to maturity; but rather a cow (heifer), as it stated (Numbers 19:2), \"and they shall take to you a  heifer.\" And [that] that which it states about it \"pure\" (temimah), is to speak about perfect redness, such that two black or white hairs disqualify it. Even if it was shrunken (other textual variants read, dwarfed, meaning a dwarf), it is acceptable, so long as it is all red - as it does not need to be more perfect than other offerings. And if it had hairs whose roots were red and the tips were another color, it all goes according to the roots. And [so,] he trims the tips with a scissors down to the red. ",

If, however, it needed to be guarded and it was tied by a rope, it is acceptable (Mishnah Parah 2:3, Mishneh Torah, Laws of Red Heifer 1:7), but if it did not need guarding, it is disqualified, as any protection that is unnecessary is a burden. And it was purchased with money from the collection of the cell (Mishnah Shekalim 4:2). And a heifer that became blemished can be redeemed and it goes out to being non-sacred.  And [also] that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Yoma 88b) about the matter that it is the one who burns the heifer that is impure, that this is the one who assists in the burning - such as the one who turns over the meat, or throws in firewood, or [moves] the fire or stokes the coals to have the fire burn [better], and similar to these - but the one who lights the fire in the furnace, or arranges the wood, is pure, as is anyone who deals with it after it has become ashes.

And this thing is from tradition. And on each and every day of the days of separation, they would sprinkle him with the ashes of a heifer from one of the heifers that had already been burnt. And this would only be done by someone who had never been rendered impure by a dead body, as the sprinkler must be pure. And if you say, \"If so that the need is only that someone who is pure sprinkles him, [would it not] have been possible for someone who had been impure and was sprinkled upon, to sprinkle him\" - it is not like this, as we are concerned that the one who sprinkled [the one sprinkling now] may have not been pure from the impurity of a dead body. And also, any vessels that were filled to be poured on the priest who would burn the heifer were all vessels of stone, since they [are not susceptible to] acquiring impurity.",

And they would bring pregnant women and they would give birth there and raise their children there. And when they wanted to sprinkle on the priest that would burn [the heifer], they would bring oxen - as their bellies were inflated - and they would place slats (literally, doors) on their backs and the children would be made to sit on top of the slats, so that there would be a 'tent,' separating between them and the ground, because of the [concern over the] graves of the deep; and there would be stone cups in the hands of the children. And they would be brought to the waters of Shiloach, and they would descend there and fill [the cups], as there was no concern there over the graves of the deep, since it is not the way of people to bury in rivers. And they would return and mount atop the slats on top of the oxen and go to the Temple Mount. And they would descend there and walk upon their feet, since all of the Temple Mount and the yards' underneaths were hollow, due to the concern over the graves of deep. And they would walk to the opening of the [Temple] yard and take from the ashes and place them in cups; and they would sprinkle the priest that burns [the heifer]. And the children would immerse due to the concern that they had become impure with another impurity. And all of these things are from the extra stringencies of the heifer.

                "<b>The commandment of the laws of inheritance:</b> That we were commanded with the laws of inheritances; that is, that it is a commandment upon us to act and rule in the matter of inheritance, as the Torah ruled about it, as it is stated (Numbers 27:8-9), \"If a man dies and has no son, you shall pass his inheritance to his daughter. And if he has no daughter, etc.\" And the end of the section [is], \"and this shall be for the Children of Israel as an eternal statute, as the Lord commanded Moshe.\" But do not think that its stating in this that in the matter of inheritance we act as the Torah ruled about it, means to say that a man is commanded by God to give what he has to his heirs in all cases; as God, blessed be He, did not wish to extract the properties of a person from his control, for the sake of his heir, that he should not do all of his desire [with them], so long as his soul is in him, as [is the view] of the wise men of the nations. Rather, it informs us that the right of the heirs is entwined with the property of their [progenitor]. And [so] when the [ownership] of the bequeather elapses with his death, the right of the heirs immediately rests upon them; like the matter of procreation that the Creator, blessed be He, wanted without interruption. Our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, designated this right of assertion of the heir in the properties of his bequeather, with the expression, \"touching,\" as in the expression in their statement in many places (e. g. Bava Batra 115b), \"Inheritance touches and continues.\" [This] means that the right of the heir upon the bequeather is like two bodies clinging to each other, such that what comes out from one, rests upon the other.",
                "And because of this, they, may their memory be blessed, said (Bava Batra 126b) that if the bequeather commanded and said, \"My son shall not inherit me,\" or \"My son x shall not inherit with his brothers\" or \"My daughter x shall inherit me,\" when he has a son, or similar to these words; his words have no force, as he does not have the power to uproot the word of God, Who said that the heir inherits the bequeather. And even though we said that his properties are in his hands for all of his desires, the matter is to say that he may give them to whom he wants and to do whatever is his desire - and even to destroy his property - with any expression, except for that of inheritance; as this statement is against the statement of the Omnipresent and His decree. As He stated that the heir inherits, and hence a person has no power to say [that] he shall not inherit. And this is [the meaning] of our teaching in our Mishanh in [the chapter entitled] Yesh Nochalin (Bava Batra 130a), \"One who says, 'X shall not inherit with his brothers,' has said nothing, for he has stipulated against what is written in the Torah. And so [too,] one who says, 'Y (stranger) shall inherit me,' when he has a daughter, or 'My daughter shall inherit me,' when he has a son, has said nothing, for he has stipulated against what is written in the Torah. Rabbi Yochanan ben Beroka says, 'If he said [it] about one who is qualified to inherit from him, his words are valid, but about one who is not qualified to inherit from him, his words are not valid.'\" The explanation is if he said about one son among his sons, or one daughter among his daughters that only [that] one among them inherit him, his words are valid. And it is expounded in the Gemara from that which is written (Deuteronomy 21:16), \"And it shall be on the day that he gives his inheritance to his sons\" -  that the Torah gave the father permission to bequeath to whom he wants from those qualified to inherit. And the law about this is decided like Rabbi Yochanan regarding common [children], but not regarding the first-born; about which the father does not have the power to uproot the inheritance from the first-born in this matter.",
                "They also said there (Bava Batra 126b), \"The one who divides his properties, gives a large portion to one and a small portion to another, or gives a standard portion to the first-born, his words are valid. But if he said it as 'inheritance' he has said nothing. If he wrote it - whether at the beginning of his words, or in the middle of his words or at the end - as a gift, his words are valid.\" And it seems that even though there is no validity to the words of the one who [employs] an expression of inheritance and his actions [in this regard] are nothing - as is explicit in the Mishnah - through his commanding this, he has violated this positive commandment of inheritance, for he has transgressed against the decree of the King.  And so [too,] if maybe after he dies, the court affirms these words of his, they also have the iniquity of violating this positive commandment, besides the punishment for the negative commandment of \"Do not pervert justice.\" And according to what appears from the words of Rambam, may his memory be blessed, the entire thrust of this warning is only upon the court that judged about the matter of inheritance like this. And this is his language that he wrote \"It is a commandment to judge the laws of inheritance.\" And it is as he elucidated the matter about the commandment of annulling vows, before it.",
                "It is from the root of the commandment [that it is] so that a person should reflect that the world is in the hand of the Master that oversees all of His creatures, and it is in His desire and His goodly will, that each and every person acquires the portion of possessions that he attains in this world.  And His gift is blessed, that it stay forever with the one He gave it to, were it not that the world was penalized with death because of the original sin. Yet it is not correct that the removal of his body should end the blessed gift of God. Rather it should extend on its own [to] the body that descends from this one, i.e. his son or his daughter. And if he dies in his iniquity and he has no children, it is proper for the blessing of God to revert to the closest relative to him; as this blessing that this one acquired was either due to his merit or the merit of his forebears. Or perhaps his closest relatives taught him some skill that caused him to amass his possessions; therefore when he and his seed are removed from them, it is fitting for his relatives who assisted him in this merit to precede all other people.",
                "From the laws of the commandment is that which they, may their memory be blessed, said in our Mishnah from [the chapter entitled] Yesh Nochalin (Bava Batra 115a), \"The order of inheritance is thus: 'If a man dies, etc.' - a son precedes a daughter, and all offspring of a son precede a daughter; a daughter precedes brothers, and all offspring of a daughter precede brothers; the brothers, or the sisters where there are no brothers, precede brothers of the father (uncles); and brothers of the father, or sisters of the father (aunts) if there are no brothers of the father, precede other relatives. This is the general rule: the offspring of any heir precedes the next relation, and the father always precedes his offspring.\" And in this way that we said, we go and climb up to the beginning of [the lineage]. Therefore, there is not anyone in Israel who was no heir.",
                "And [also] that which they said there (Bava Batra 108a) that a mother does not bequeath [her property] to her children - and this thing is a tradition. And brothers from the mother (but from different fathers) do not inherit each other, as maternal family is not called family. And so, a <i>mamzer</i> (a son from Jewish parents forbidden to marry) - or a <i>mamzer</i> brother - behold, he inherits like other sons (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Inheritances 1:6-7); and even a <i>mamzer</i> son that become an apostate inherits. But a child of a maid-servant or non-Jewess does not inherit, and he is not the father's son for any [purpose]. But the Sages established that a man bequeaths to his wife, if they are fully married; and they gave the matter support from Scripture. ",
                "And Rambam (Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Ase 248), may his memory be blessed, wrote that included in these laws of inheritance without a doubt, is that the first-born receives double - as this is included in the commandment of inheritance. And the explanation of double is two portions, meaning that if there are two brothers, we [divide] the money into three parts and the first-born takes two. And if there are three, we [divide] it into four parts and he takes two, and so forth forever. But the first-born only takes double in properties that are held by the father (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Inheritances 3:1), meaning to say that came into the domain of his father in his lifetime, but not that which is fitting to come to his father, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 21:17), \"of all that is found to him.\" How is this? [If] one of the individuals from whom the father could inherit dies after the father, the first-born does not take double from that inheritance. And so [too,] if the father had a debt that was owed to him (Bava Batra 125b) - even [if it was recorded] in a contract - or if he has a merchant ship [raising revenue] in the sea, the first-born does not have double of this; as this is not 'found to the father.' And so [too,] for this reason, the first-born does not take double of the appreciation of the properties after the death of his father, such as a field yielding grain, or trees bearing their fruit, as these were not extant to his father in his days. If, however, a small tree grew larger not due to an expense - but rather grew on its own - after his father's death before the division [of the property], the first-born does take double of this; as this is considered extant to his father, as it is unchanged in its form.",
                "And the father is believed [when] he says, \"This is my son, my first-born\" (Kiddushin 74a), or to say, \"This is my son\" or \"This is not my son.\" As  it is written (Deuteronomy 21:17), \"But the first-born etc. shall he recognize\" - and they, may their memory be blessed, expounded (Bava Batra 127b), \"shall make him recognized by others.\" And even if someone was presumed to be Reuven's son, if Reuven says that he is not his son, he is believed, and he does not bequeath to him. And Rambam (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Inheritances 4:2), may his memory be blessed, wrote, \"It seems to me that even if the son had sons, [such that] even though [the father] is not believed about him to say he is not his son, for the purposes of family relationships, and he is not presumed to be a <i>mamzer</i> on his word, he is believed for the purposes of inheritance and he will not inherit him.",
                "And also that which they said (Bava Batra 129b) about this matter, that [if] one says to [someone else], \"My properties are yours; and after you, for x\" - if the first is eligible to inherit, the latter has nothing in place of the first. As since [the first] acquired the properties and he is eligible to inherit them, their is no further interruption of the inheritance because of the stipulation of the bequeather. And with the best commentaries, and proper logic, we learned in the chapter [entitled] Yesh Nochalin (Bava Batra 125b) that even if he says it with an expression of \"from now,\" as for example [if] he said to him, \"My properties are yours; and from now, after you for x\" - nonetheless, the latter has nothing in place of the first, as the first is eligible to inherit (and there is nothing left after the inheritance). But if the first is not eligible to inherit and he said to him, \"from now, after you, will be for x,\" the latter acquires the properties themselves, and the first one [only] receives the income all of his lifetime. And if he did not say, \"from now,\" but rather [just], \"My properties are yours; and after you, for x,\" the latter only receives what is left from the first (Bava Batra 137a, Mishneh Torah, Laws of Ownerless Property and Gifts 12:9). And if the first sells them, the latter never has the power to extract them from the purchaser, as they stay in the possession of the first all the days of his entire for all of his desires - whether to sell them or give them as a gift to anyone he wants. They are so fully in the possession of the first that if the giver said, \"My properties are yours; and after you, for x; and after him, for y,\" if the second one dies in the lifetime of the first, they, may their memory be blessed, said in the Gemara (Bava Batra 129b), that the properties go back to the heirs of the first. As the [original ceder of the properties] did not leave anything over in his gift to the first, except for [the stipulation] that they would be given after [the life of the first] to the second, and from the second - and through his agency - to the third. And since the second died, and it is impossible for the third to acquire them through the agency of the second - as the giver had said - the properties remain in the hand of whom they are possessed and his heirs forever. And the same is true that we should rule in the way that we said, where he used the expression, \"if\" - for example [if] he said, \"My properties are for x; and if he dies, they should be given to y\" (see Tur, Choshen Mishpat 248:4 in the name of Rabbenu Yonah). As we are not coming to rule like this based on the expression, \"after you.\" Rather, the reason of the thing is because we say that the first acquired the properties themselves and its income; and they are possessed in his hand, [unless] we can extract them from him with a strong proof [otherwise]. But where the giver wrote, \"My properties are yours; and after you, mine or my heirs\"; even though he did not mention the expression, \"from now,\" in this retention, we should rule that if the recipient of the gift dies, the properties return to the giver or his heirs. And even if the recipient of the gift sells [them], the giver may extract them from the hand of the buyer when the recipient of the gift dies. As so did the sages say about this (Bava Batra 137b) - that anyone who retains [the rights to his properties] for himself or his heirs is always as if he stipulates, \"This present will be for you to enjoy the profits [only] during all the days of your life.\"",
                "The general rule of the things that has come up in our hands in this matter after much toil is that so long as the first is eligible to inherit, once the bequeather said, \"My properties are yours,\" it is no longer in is hand to give them to another, even to his heir; since the properties immediately enter the possession of the [first] heir. And afterwards, he is only like one who makes stipulations about the properties of another person. And it is like the matter that is said about this topic in the Gemara (Bava Batra 133a), \"He held it has interruption\" - it, meaning inheritance - \"and the [Torah] stated that it does not have interruption.\"",
                "And our teachers, may God protect them, taught us what is even greater than this with strong and clear proofs: That even one who says to someone who is eligible to inherit him, \"My properties are yours; and after you, to be consecrated property (<i>hekdesh</i>),\" or even if he said, \"and from now, after you, to be consecrated,\" the heir acquires the properties and he may sell them or do with them as he desires; and [the one in charge of] consecrated property does not have the power to extract them from the hand of the purchaser or the recipient of the gift for the reason that we wrote. And once the bequeather said to his heir, \"My properties are yours,\" [the heir] acquires the properties, and it is no longer in his hand to consecrate them. Rather, it is like he consecrates the property of others. And regarding what there is to analyze in this matter that at the beginning of the analysis seems difficult - such as that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Kiddushin 28b), \"his statement for consecrated property is like delivery for regular property,\" and other things - we have already discussed them back and forth, and have come to precise understandings about all of them, such that the matter has come up clarified as we have written. The matter would be too long if I came to write it all and it is not the work of my book. But if you will merit, my son, and cast your net upon the sea of the Gemara, all of it will come up to you.

And one who transgresses it and commanded - whether he was healthy or on his deathbed - that the one eligible to inherit him, not inherit him, has nullified this positive commandment, provided that he commanded so, with an expression of 'inheritance,' as we have said. And [this is true] even though his words have no substance, as we have written above at the beginning of the topic. And Ramban, may his memory be blessed, wrote that Rambam, may his memory be blessed, skipped two commandments, one positive commandment and one negative - and both of them are about the firstborn. As a man is commanded to recognize the firstborn by giving him double, and that is a positive commandment on the father that Rambam skipped. And so too, It warns him about transferring the rights of the firstborn from him. And about this it states (Deuteronomy 21:16), \"he may not make into a firstborn the son of the beloved, etc.\" And the teacher mentioned also did not itemize this warning [as a negative commandment], but rather grouped it all into the commandment of the law of inheritances."

In order to regularly arouse his spirit and his desire to remember his Creator, and through this to make his actions proper and be blessed from [God]; as He is One who desires kindness.

So too [is it] on the day of Rosh Hashanah, which is the day determined from antiquity to judge on it all who come to the world, and as they, may their memory be blessed, said (Rosh Hashanah 18a), \"On Rosh Hashanah all creatures pass before Him like <i>benei maron</i>\" - meaning to say that His providence is over the action of each and every one individually. And if his merits are greater, he goes out innocent, but if his iniquities are greater such that it is fit to render him guilty, he is rendered guilty for the death penalty, or for one of the decrees, according to that [for] which he is guilty. Hence, everyone must arouse his nature to request mercy over his sins from the Master of mercy, as 'He is a graceful and merciful God, He bears iniquity, rebellion and sin, and removes' [the sin] of those that repent to Him with all of their hearts. And the sound of the shofar greatly arouses the heart of all its listeners, and all the more so, the <i>teruah</i> sound, meaning to say the broken sound (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Repentance 3:4). And besides the arousal from it, there is a memory device in the matter; that when he hears the broken sounds, he  break the evil inclination of his heart for the desires of the world and his cravings. As every man prepares his heart and understands things according to what his eyes see and what his ears hear. And this is [the meaning of] what Rabbi Yehudah said (Rosh Hashanah 26b), \"We blow from the males (rams) on Rosh Hashanah\" - meaning to say, the bent horn of [rams], so that when he sees it, man remembers to 'bend' his heart towards the Heavens.

And all shofars are fit except for that of the cow (see Ramban in his Sermon for Rosh Hashanah). The explanation is that anything that is a shofar - meaning to say that it is hollow, as the expression, shofar, always implies something that has a cavity - such as the shofar of a [ram] that has a cavity inside of its protrusion, and any shofar in the world that has a cavity as we explained, is fit to blow with it on Rosh Hashanah. [This comes] to exclude the horns of an oryx and other animals, the horns of which are not at all included in the expression, shofar, as they do not have something with a cavity in them, but rather just the protrusion. But the horn of a cow is not fit, even though it is in the category of shofar - as behold, it has a cavity and a protrusion - since Scripture included it with those disqualified, as it called it a horn, as it is written (Deuteronomy 33:17), \"His firstborn ox, etc. and his horns are the horns of an oryx.\" It comes out according to this explanation of ours that all the horns of the world are disqualified to blow with on Rosh Hashanah, except for the horns of [rams] and ewes and also male goats and  female goats; as we have not found hollow horns in the world except for these and that of the cow. As all of the horns of all of the [other] animals are not empty, so it comes out that they are not in the category of the expression, shofar. And Scripture has also already taken out that of the cow from the category of the fit and placed it with the category of the disqualified, since it called it with their name. And let it not be difficult in your eyes about these words of ours, that behold Scripture [also] calls the shofar of male goats with the expression of the disqualified, as it is written (Daniel 8:5), \"and the goat had a conspicuous horn between its eyes.\" As this matter was in a prophetic vision, and Scripture informs us that it appeared to the prophet as if it had a horn due to the great strength of the goat - meaning to say [the horn] was strong [in that it was] without a cavity. And the matter is not at all that Scripture is placing it with the disqualified, but rather the opposite, [as is understood] by all who understand.

And the Sages did not decree this in a place where there is a court this is great in wisdom; but it is only [permitted] when they blow there in the presence of the court.

And the understanding of <i>teruah</i> is like its [official Aramaic] translation, <i>yabava</i>. And the [meaning] of <i>yabava</i> is a broken sound, meaning to say, the sound of wailing. It comes out that the Torah commanded us to make a sound similar to wailing from the shofar. But since [different] places in the world differ regarding the matter of wailing - as in one place they wail with heavy sobs, and in another place, with light [yelps] and in [yet] another place, they do [both], heavy and light - it became customary in each and every place to blow the <i>teruah</i> on Rosh Hashanah according to the way each person would wail in his place. And with this, they would [all] fulfill their obligation for the commandment, since the Torah commanded about a voice of wailing. And with whichever one it would be in any place, he would fulfill his obligation with this from the Torah regardless - and even though in his place, they did not wail like this - as he fulfilled the intention of Scripture and made a wail from the shofar on Rosh Hashanah. [This was the case] until Rabbi Abahu rose (Rosh Hashanah 34a) and it was not right in his eyes that Israel should differ regarding the practice of <i>teruah</i> - this one with this and that one with that - as the Torah would become like two Torahs in Israel. [So] he gathered all of the customs and established that they would blow the same [way] in all places and to fulfill the obligation with all of the wailings that are done in the world. He ordained to make the <i>teruah</i> in [all] three ways: like the heavy sobs, which is <i>shevarim</i>; and like the light [yelps], which is what we call <i>teruah</i>; and also the way of heavy sobs and light [yelps together], like the custom of one the places where they do it all, according to their [particular] wails. And it comes out according to this that we need to blow three [sets] of three, three times. And the law of the shofar that cracked along its length or width, or was punctured and he plugged it with its type or not its type (Rosh Hashanah 27b); the law of one who puts a shofar inside a shofar; the law of one who blows in a pit or a cellar; the law of a shofar of idolatry or a condemned city or one who vows not to benefit from his fellow (Rosh Hashanah 28a); the law when the listener had intention [to fulfill the commandment] but the [blower] did not; and the rest of its details are [all] elucidated in Tractate Rosh Hashanah (see Tur, Orach Chaim 585)",

And Rambam, may his memory be blessed, wrote (Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Ase 95) and this is his language: \"And the matter is not that we are obligated to annul regardless. And this matter itself understand from me - when you hear me counting a law from the laws, it is not [always] that it is a commandment to perform a certain action perforce, but rather the commandment is in our being commanded that we deliberate on the law about this thing. While Scripture has already elucidated and been exacting that a husband and a father can annul [a vow of their wife or daughter], it is the transmission that brought to us that a sage can annul [it] for all, and so too, an oath. And the indication of this is its statement (Numbers 30:3), 'he shall not profane his word' - and they, may their memory be blessed, expounded (Chagigah 10a), 'He does not pardon [it], but others may pardon it.' And the general principle is that there is no proof to this from Scripture. And they, may their memory be blessed, already said (Chagigah 10a), 'Annulment of vows flies in the air and has nothing to support it,' except for the truthful transmission only. To here [are his words].",
                "And what apparently comes out of all of this according to his opinion is that in the annulment by an expert sage or three ordinary men of a vow by the commandment of the Torah, and their doing the matter like all that the Torah commands about it - like is proper and like is straight - they will have then fulfilled a positive commandment. But if they annulled the vow not like the commandment of the Torah - for example, [by] two ordinary men or an individual who is not an expert - the punishment for the violation of this positive commandment will be upon them; even though their annulment is not an [effective] annulment. And [it is] like I wrote above regarding the matter of the commandment of inheritances (Sefer HaChinukh 400), that one who says and commands, \"My son shall not inherit me\" will have the punishment of the violation of the positive commandment upon him, even though his words are void; as he has transgressed the decree of the King that commanded us about the laws of inheritance. However, Ramban, may his memory be blessed, wrote (in his glosses on the Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Ase 95) that the law should not be counted at all in the tally of the commandments, since it is [just the] negation [of a commandment]. As we were commanded to do everything that comes out of our mouth and that we not profane our words, only according to the father or the husband. To here [are his words]. And 'the words of the wise are grace.' ",
                "I have already expanded my words about some of the roots of the matter of the vow and the oath and their annulment in the Order of Vayishma Yitro in the [negative commandment] of \"Do not take\" (Sefer HaChinukh 30).",
                "From the laws of the commandment are that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Nedarim 2a), \"All substitutes for [the expression for] vows are like vows, [substitutes for] dedications are like dedications, [substitutes for] oaths are like oaths, and [substitutes for] nazirite vows are like nazirite vows.\" [This is such that]  (Nedarim 10a), \"one who says [that a certain object is] <i>konam, konach</i> or <i>konas</i>, behold, these are substitutes for sacrifice (<i>korban</i>); <i>cherek, cherekh</i> or <i>cheref</i>,  behold, these are substitutes for dedication (<i>cherem</i>) [to the Temple treasury]; <i>nazik, naziach</i> or <i>paziach</i>, behold, these are substitutes for naziriteness (<i>nazir</i>); <i>shevutah, shekukah</i> or [if] he vows with [the term,] <i>mohi</i>, behold, these are substitutes for oath (<i>shevuah)</i>.\" And the reason for the matter of these expressions that the Sages said are judged as if a man brought them out of his lips with the proper expression and [that] we do not concern ourselves to require that his mouth and heart be the same - as behold, he did not bring the proper expression from his mouth - is because these expressions imply the matter. Since anyone who hears would decide about it that this is the intention of the one making an oath or vowing. And since it is like this, behold, it is as if he said the thing clearly and properly. As if you don't say like this, it comes out that there would never be vows or oaths from those with speech impediments (see Mishneh Torah, Laws of Vows 1:16). And in truth, this is not [the case].",
                "And so [too,] that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Nedarim 2b), that there are four vows which are annulled - meaning to say they are completely annulled, such that we do not require a question to a sage [in order to annul it], and like the opinion of Shmuel in the chapter [entitled] Arbaah Nedarim (Nedarim 21b), as the law is according to him. And these are them: vows of exhortation; vows of exaggeration (nonsense); vows of mistake; and vows of duress. And there in the same chapter, [the makeup of] each and every one is clarified. And we have the textual variant in the Talmud Yerushalmi Nedarim 3:1 concerning vows of exhortation, \"Rabbi Zeira said, 'That which you say, is when they were not holding up their words, but if they were holding up their words, they would require dispensation'\"; meaning to say, if they were holding up their words - meaning that they did not vow as a vow to exhort, but rather they vowed it with precision - they would require a question to a sage. And the same is certainly true of the other three [vows] that are learned in the Mishnah, that if they were holding up their words, they would require a question of a sage. And nonetheless a sage can annul in any situation, so long as he finds an opening to annul [it], meaning to say that he finds some matter that the vower would say, \"If I had known this thing at the time of the vow, I would not have vowed.\"",
                "And we can open to annul even with something that newly develops (<i>nolad</i>), so long as it is something that commonly develops. But with something new that does not commonly develop, [we do not]. So is it explained in the Gemara (Nedarim 64a). And so [too,] we can open with regret, and as Rava determines in the name of Rav Nachman in Tractate Nedarim 22b - \"We open for regret, and make ourselves available to annul, even to the one who has sworn by the God of Israel,\" which is a severe oath. And [this is] uniquely with regret from the beginning, such as \"Is this heart [still] upon you?\" [This is] meaning to say that this vower vowed out of anger, and after his mind settled down, he is completely bewildered by his oath and does not want it at all. But if he regrets [it] now because of something new that developed after he vowed, and he wanted his vow until now; this is not effective regret, and we do not open for him at all - as behold, everyone who comes to ask about his vow certainly regrets it now. And if [this type of regret were effective], the Gemara would not have required us to search to find openings for vows. But we find in the Gemara that they did search for openings for vows. But rather the truth is certainly like we wrote, that we need regret from the beginning. And [this is the case] also, since the entire foundation of annulling vows is the claim of error or duress (Shevuot 26a), since the Torah stated (Leviticus 5:4), \"a man with an oath\" - to exclude duress; and so too, that his mouth and heart are the same.

And [so] we do not make ourselves available to the one that swore in the name of the God of Israel, but rather only to that which is similar to the four vows that are learned in the Mishnah. And also that we do not make ourselves available except for a matter that includes a commandment, such as the making of peace between a man and his wife, or between a man and his fellow, and similar to these matters.

And so too, they said that annulment of vows can be with one if he is an expert. And the same is true in any case that he has permission to annul vows from someone who is ordained, as he [is then considered] like an expert. And there is one that explained it, that so long as he is a great sage among Israel - even today, when we do not have ordination - he is called an expert; but his colleagues disagree with him. And the law of one who recants during the time of speech (immediately after the first speech), that his recanting is an [effective] recanting; that which they said that a father abrogates any vow, but a husband, [only] vows of affliction and things between him and her; the law of one who says, \"Any vow that I vow this year,\" or \"from now until ten years\" - behold, they are null; the law [that] undifferentiated vows are [understood] stringently, and specified vows are [understood] leniently; the law that a man may not prohibit a thing that is not his; the law of one who says to his fellow, \"My loaf is forbidden to you,\" or \"this loaf\"; the law of one who vows [not to] benefit his fellow, that he [may] pay his debt [back to him]; the law of the one who vows [not to have] meat, that he is permitted gravy, but if he said, \"This meat,\" he is forbidden even the gravy; the law of one whose benefit is forbidden, that it is permitted to teach him oral law, but not written [law], because we can take a wage for it; the law of that which they said, \"With vows, it follows the language of people\" - in that place and that language that he vowed or swore; the law of annulment of vows that it is the whole day, meaning night and day, but not [twenty-four] hours, as it is stated, (Numbers 30:6) \"on the day of his hearing it\"; and the rest of its many details are elucidated at length in the tractate that is composed abut it, and that is Tractate Nedarim (see Tur, Yoreh Deah 233).",

And they treated his honor very lightly, and said about him that the cloak with which he wraps himself should be like a donkey saddle in your eyes.

And about this is it stated (Deuteronomy 5:18), \"you shall not desire the house of your neighbor, etc.\" And Rambam, may his memory be blessed, wrote (Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Lo Taase 266), that the two negative commandments - which are \"you shall not covet,\" which is in the Order of Vayishma Yitro, and \"you shall not desire\" in this Order - are not repeated negative commandments about one matter. Rather, they are two matters. As the negative commandment of \"you shall not covet\" will prevent him from taking that which someone besides him acquired, in any way - whether with money or without money - if [the owner] does not want to sell that thing. But this negative commandment of \"you shall not desire\" will prevent him from even the desire for it in his heart. As with the desire, he will come to supplicate him and to pressure him to sell it or trade it for another vessel, no matter what. And even though one of these negative commandments brings its fellow, they are considered two nonetheless. And behold, you [can] see the difference between them.",

As truly, it is in the hand of a man to prevent himself and his thoughts and his desires from anything that he wants. And [it is] within his control and his cognizance to distance and to bring close his want for all things according to his will. And his heart is given into his hand; to anything that he wants can he incline it. And God - in front of Whom are all hidden things - 'searches all the rooms of the belly, sees the kidney and the heart.' There is not one from all of the thoughts of man - little or big, good or bad - that is hidden from Him; and it is not covered from His eyes. [Hence] He will bring vengeance upon those that transgress His will in their hearts, and 'safeguards kindness for the thousands [of generations] for those that love Him,' who dedicate their thoughts to His service. As there is nothing as good for a man as good and pure thought, as it is the beginning of all actions, and their end. And this is apparently the matter of the 'good heart,' that the Sages praised in Tractate Avot 2:9. And the proof that these two negative commandments are different in their content and considered two [distinct commandments] is that which they said in Mekhilta DeRabbi Shimon bar Yochai 20:14, \"'You shall not covet your neighbor's house' (Exodus 20:14), and later it states, 'and you shall not desire,' to make liable for the desire on its own and for the coveting on its own.\" And there, it [also] says, \"From where [do I know] that if he desires, his end will be to covet? [Hence,] we learn to say 'you shall not desire' 'and you shall not covet.' From where [do I know] that if a man coveted, his end will be to steal? [Hence,] we learn to say 'They covet fields, and steal' (Michah 2:2).\" ",

                "And it is practiced in every place and at all times by males and females. All people of the world are also obligated about it, since it is a branch of the commandment [against] theft, which is one of the seven commandments that all people of the world were commanded. And do not err, my son, with this well-known tally of the seven commandments of the Noachides mentioned in the Talmud (Sanhedrin 56b); as truthfully these seven are [only] like general principles, but they have many details. So you will find that the prohibition of sexual immorality is considered for them to be one commandment as a general principle, but there are details in it; such as the prohibition of the mother, and the prohibition of the sister from the mother's side, and the prohibition of a married woman, and the wife of the father, and the male, and the animal (Sanhedrin 58a). And so [too,] the matter of idolatry is all considered one commandment for them, but there are many, many details; as behold, they are the same regarding it as Israel, since they are liable for everything that an Israelite court would kill about (Sanhedrin 56b). And so too can we say that since they are warned about the matter of theft, that they were also warned about all of its distancings. And my intention is not to say that they are warned about this with a negative commandment like Israel. Rather, they were warned about it more generally in these seven. It is as if you would say, for example, that Scripture warned them, \"Each man, shall not come close to the flesh of his relatives; to the mother, to the sister and to all of the family.\" And so too also with idolatry [that the command be] in general. And so with theft, [it is] as if it was stated to them, \"You shall not steal, but distance yourselves from it completely\" - and within the distancing is not to covet. But the matter is not like this with Israel, as the Omnipresent wanted to bring them merit, and [so] he multiplied the commandments for them, more than for [the gentiles]; and also in those that we were commanded, He commanded upon them with separate positive commandments and negative commandments - as every one that does one commandment acquires one defender for himself. And the one who transgresses this and fixes his thought to desire that which is of someone else transgresses this negative commandment. But there are no lashes for it, as there is no act [connected with it], yet his punishment is very great; as it is a cause for several mishaps, as is well-known [from] the story of Achav and Navot. "

And they challenged what they challenged about this in the Gemara, and the resolution was that the obligation is to teach him Scripture - which is Torah - like the father's father of Zevulun did, and even though the father's father of Zevulun ben Dan taught him more.

And Ezra and his court ordained them, with all of the blessings that are set in the mouths of all of Israel.",
                "And also from the content of the commandment is that which they said (Berakhot 15a) that one who reads the Shema needs to make it audible to his ear, but that if he did not make it audible to his ear, yet nonetheless read the words with his lips, he has fulfilled [his obligation], ex post facto. And so [too,] that which they said (Berakhot 15a) that one needs to be exacting about the words, yet if he was not exacting about them, he has [still] fulfilled [it]. And some of the commentators said (Meiri on Berakhot 15a) that the matter is not that he did not pronounce the words and the letters. As with this, certainly is it not said that if he was not exacting, he has fulfilled [it]; as anyone who did not read the whole recitation of the Shema has not fulfilled his obligation. Rather, the matter of his fulfilling it if he was not being exacting in them is that he did not put a space between [words that] run into [each other] such as <i>bekhol-levavecha, esev-besadecha, ve'avadetem-meheirah, bechol-levavechem</i> [and] <i>hakanaf-petil</i>; and so [too,] if the did not sibilate [the letter,] <i>zayin</i> of <i>tizkheru</i>, that needs sibilation; or that he did not lengthen the [letter,] <i>dalet</i>, as it is fitting to do, a priori.",

And it has been [much time] that we have not seen someone who is particular towards his fellow at all if he not interrupt [to greet him], even between the paragraphs.

                "<b>The commandment of the tefillin of the arm</b> To bind the tefillin of the arm upon the arm, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 6:8), \"And you shall bind them as a sign upon your arm.\" And the explanation comes about this verse, that we bind four sections from the words of the Torah upon our arms. And they are called tefillin when they are bound with straps, as the tradition comes [to explain] about them. And these are these four sections: Two of them are at the end of the Order of Bo el Pharaoh and they are the sections of 'Sanctify your firstborn to me,' until 'you shall keep this statute at its set time from year to year' - which is one section in every exact book [of the Torah]. And the second section is from 'And it shall be when He will bring you,' until the end of the order which finishes [with] 'for with strong-handedness did He take us out of Egypt.' And the third section is at the end of the Order of Ve'etchanan in the Book of Elu HaDevarim (Deuteronomy) - the section of 'Hear Israel,' until 'and in your gates.' And the fourth section is at the end of the Order of Vehaya Ekev - the section of 'And it shall be if you listen,' until 'like the days of the heavens upon the earth.' These four sections are written on one parchment and we roll it like a type of Torah scroll from its end to its beginning. And we place it into a chamber of leather and we pass a strap through one end of the leather. And we bind that leather with the [Torah] sections inside it upon the left upper arm. And since they are bound upon the upper arm, they are resting across from the heart. And they are called tefillin of the arm in every place. ",
                "It is from the root of the commandment [that] since people are physical, they are necessarily drawn after their desires; for the nature of all physical things is to seek all which is comfortable for it and is pleasurable - just as a horse or like a mule who understand nothing - were it not that the soul with which God has graced us prevents us, to its ability, from sin. But as it resides in [the body's territory,] which is the earth, and is far removed from its [territory], which is the heavens, it cannot [vanquish] it and [the body] always exerts its strength over it. It therefore nonetheless requires many guards to protect it from its malevolent neighbor, lest it rise up upon it and kill it; as it is in its [territory] and under its hand. And the Omnipresent, blessed be He, wanted to give us - the holy nation - merit, and [so] He commanded us to set up mighty guards around [the soul]. And they are that we were commanded not to interrupt from [speaking] words of Torah from our mouths day and night; that we place four fringes on the four corners of our garments; a mezuzah on our doorpost; and the tefillin on our arm and on our head. And all of this is to remind us to avoid the crimes of our hands and that we not stray after our eyes or after the impulse of the thoughts of our hearts. Therefore, they, may their memory be blessed, said (Zevachim 19a) that the priests and the Levites are exempt from them when they performed the [Temple] service. And as the foundation of the tefillin is as we have mentioned, we are commanded about them (Menachot 36b) that we not remove our thoughts from them. Now, my son, also see how much more power our bodies have than our souls; for despite all this, it sometimes comes up and 'breaks our fence.' May God in His mercy aid us and protect us, amen.",
                "From the laws of the commandment is that with they, may their memory be blessed, said (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 1:3) that there are ten things about tefillin - whether [it be] in the tefillin of the head or whether of the arm - that are 'laws of Moshe from Sinai.' And one who changes [even] one out of all of them, behold, [his] tefillin are disqualified. Two of them are in the writing and eight are in the cover and the binding of the straps. And these are the two with their writing: That they must be written with ink; and that they must be written on parchment. And these are the eight in their cover (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3:1): 1) That they be square and their sewing be square, and their diagonals be square to the point that the four corners are all even; 2) that there be the form of a [letter,] <i>shin</i> from the right and the left [sides] on the leather of the head; 3) that he wraps the [Torah] sections in cloth; 4) that he wrap them with the hair of a pure beast or [wild] animal over the cloth, and afterwards, place them inside their leather boxes; 5) that he sew them with tendons; 6) that we make for them an aperture from the leather cover, that the strap may be inserted until it passes and goes though its box; 7) that the straps be black; 8) that their knots be the famous ones like the form of a [letter,] <i>dalet</i>.",
                "And [also] that which they said (Gittin 45b) that  only an Israelite can make tefillin and their straps. And the length of the strap of the arm is enough to surround the forearm in the place that they are placed and he ties it from there with the famous knot that needs to be in the shape of a [letter,] <i>yod</i>, and he stretches [it] until the middle finger and he wraps three rings around it on his finger and he ties it. And if it is longer than this, is is [still] fit (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3:12). And upon which place in the upper arm do we tie it? Upon the biceps - and that is the protruding flesh in the [upper arm] between the shoulder joint and the elbow joint - such that it comes out that when he puts his [upper arm] next to his ribs, the tefillin will be laying across from his heart, and it comes out that he will fulfill, \"And these words shall be [...] upon your heart\" (Deuteronomy 6:6). And [also] that which they said (Menachot 38a) that the tefillin of the arm does not impinge upon the tefillin of the head, and [that] of the head does not impinge upon that of the arm, because they are two [separate] commandments. And he recites the blessing on that of the head, 'about the commandment of tefillin'; and on that of the arm, 'to place the tefillin.' And about what are these words speaking? When he puts on one of them. But if he put both of them on together, he only recites one blessing; and that is 'to place the tefillin.' ",
                "And he first places that of the arm and afterwards that of the head; and when he removes them, he removes that of the head first. And [also] that which they said (Berakhot 9b, (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 4:10) that the time of tefillin during the day is from when one can see his friend until the sun sets, as it is stated (Exodus 13:10), \"You shall observe this statute in its proper time from day to day\" - and \"this statute\" is the commandment of tefillin. And Shabbat and holidays - and the same is true of the intermediate festival days - are not a time for the placing of tefillin, as it is stated about them (Exodus 13:16), \"And it shall be a sign.\" And Shabbat days and holidays are a sign themselves, and we do not need another sign.  ",
                "And [also] that which they said (Shabbat 49a) that tefillin requires a clean body, and they said in the Gemara, \"What is a clean body? That he be careful not to pass gas with them [on].\" But the matter is not to say that it requires a body clean of sins or of impurity. As every man, even one impure or a sinner is obligated about the commandment of tefillin, so long as he knows to be careful not to pass gas with them [on]. And maybe from being constant with the commandment of tefillin - as they are a great memory device for a person about his service to the Heavens - he will repent from his evil way and purify himself from all of his filth. And the Sages, may their memory be blessed, obligated us about the commandment of tefillin to educate even the small youths about it, so long as they have arrived to the category [of those] that know to guard them. And from here it can be understood that the opinion of our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, was that every man should grab onto this commandment and be accustomed to it, since it is a great fundamental, a protection from sin and a strong ladder to climb with to enter into the service of the Creator, blessed be He. And maybe the intention of those that are stringent about the holiness of the commandment, and discourage the hearts of the masses with their words from being involved with it, is good. But in truth, through this, there is the prevention of people from several commandments, and [so] it is a great evil. And [this is] even though I know that those that preach these lessons base themselves on the Talmud Yerushalmi Berakhot 2:3, \"About a certain man who deposited a glass with his fellow, and afterwards demanded it [back] from him and [the other] denied [having it].\" And the owner of the glass said to him, \"'It is not you that I trusted, but that which is on your head that I trusted'\" - and their intention is to say that there is a desecration of God's name, to be pious about some commandments and to be evil about others. But this is not my home with God (not how I understand the ways of God); as I know that 'there is no righteous man in the world who does good and never sins,' and nonetheless he is not prevented from being involved with commandments when the good spirit of God clothes him to do the good. As who knows whether maybe he will continue in his good path until the time of his death - and death will come suddenly. And they, may their memory be blessed, have already taught us (Avot 4:2) that \"a commandment leads to another commandment\" and \"the reward for a commandment is another commandment.\" About all of these things and the good ethics, they, may their memory be blessed, have preceded us and taught us. And those that want to be wise and add upon their words or take away [from them] are not [involved in] wisdom.",
                "And [also] that which they said (Menachot 34b) that the order of the [Torah] sections on the parchment is thus - that we first write the section of 'Sanctify your firstborn to me,' and afterwards the section of 'And it shall be when He will bring you,' and afterwards the section of 'Hear Israel,' and afterwards the section of 'And it shall be if you listen.' And those that said that we write the 'beings' in the middle - meaning to say the section of 'And it shall be when He will bring you' and the section of 'And it shall be if you listen' in the middle, the section of 'Sanctify your firstborn to me' at the beginning and the section of 'Hear Israel' at the end - did not properly discern the matter. As behold, it is the common opinion of Rashi and Rambam, may their memory be blessed and Rabbenu Hai that we do not write the 'beings' in the middle, but rather like the order that they are written in the Torah. And the proof is from that which is found in the chapter [entitled] Hakomets in Menachot 34b concerning the order of the tefillin; as they said there that one who reads [them], reads like the order in the Torah. And this text was certainly not found in the [copies of] the books of those people whose opinion was to say that we write the 'beings' in the middle. And regardless, our teachers, may God protect them, agreed now [that it is] like we wrote, that we write them like the order of the sections that are written in the Torah.  ",

And in Tractate Eruvin 31a in the chapter [entitled] Hamotseh Tefillin, they, may their memory be blessed, said that Michal the daughter of Shaul would lay tefillin and the Sages did not protest [against her]. And there they [also] said the wife of Yonah would go up in pilgrimage and the Sages did not protest [against her]. And one who transgresses this and does not lay tefillin of the arm and of the head has violated eight positive commandments (Menachot 44a); as behold, Scripture commanded about the tefillin of the arm and of the head in four sections.

And we were commanded to write these four sections on parchment and to place them on our heads between our eyes and on our upper arm across from the heart. And the matter of these four sections more than other sections of the Torah is because there is in these the acceptance of the yoke of Heaven, the unification of God, and the matter of the exodus from Egypt which forces belief in the creation of the world and the supervision of God over the lower beings - and these are the fundamentals of the Jewish religion. And therefore we were commanded to place these fundamentals between our eyes and upon the board of our hearts all day; as the wise men of science have said that these two limbs are the residence of the intellect. And when we place these things upon them as a memory device, we are strengthened about them, and we add to the cognizance of the ways of God, may He be blessed; and [so] we merit life in the world to come.

But the leather of that of the head we divide into four chambers; and in each one, we put one section from these four sections. And while it is still moist, we make from the leather the resemblance of a [letter,] <i>shin</i> with three heads on the right [side] of the one that is laying the tefillin; and the resemblance of a [letter,] <i>shin</i> with four heads on the left [side] of the one that is laying [the tefillin]. And we insert straps for the head into the extra leather at the end of the chamber, and that is what the Sages called, <i>maaboret</i>, meaning to say that we pass  (<i>maavirin</i>) the straps through it. And afterwards we encircle the measurement of the head of the one that lays [them] with the straps, and we make in that place [at the bottom of the back of the head] one knot in the shape of a [letter,] <i>dalet</i>. And it is impossible to describe this in writing, but everyone teaches his students and it is well-known among us, the holy people. And this is the knot of the tefillin that they, may their memory be blessed, said (Chullin 9a) that every Torah scholar needs to know. And they enumerated it with other things that they said about them that it is fitting to know [how to do] them no matter what. And they are the writing [of the letters], slaughter, circumcision, the blessing of bridegrooms and tsitsit. And the length of the strap of the head is enough to encircle the head with it and tie the knot behind him and that there be enough of it to stretch the two ends of the strap until [they are] across from his navel - or at the very least, that one end is until it is across from his heart and one is until it is across from his navel. And the place of the placement of the tefillin of the head - meaning to say the box of leather that the sections [of the Torah] are placed in - is across from the brain, the place where the brain of a baby is frail (Menachot 37a).

And also the man that we assume to be a prophet and that we believe needs to be a just man that walks innocently; as it is known that prophecy only rests upon the pious and among men of good deeds (Shabbat 92a). But [regarding] a prophet that promises about an evil that will come, even if it does not come, there is no contradiction to his being a prophet with this. [That is] because God is long of patience and of great kindness and He reconsiders [doing] evil when people repent, like with the people of Nineveh, and like with Hizkiyahu, whose days were added to from the Heavens after the decree that he die. Yet if a prophecy of a prophet that promises about the good does not come true, it is a contradiction to his being a prophet; since any good that God decrees through a sent prophet - even if it is conditional - never returns empty (is always fulfilled). And this is from His abundant goodness and His great kindness. [This] and the rest of its details are in [various] places in the Talmud (see Mishneh Torah, Laws of Foundations of the Torah 10).  ",

And in this commandment of ours about them to destroy them is [also] found a benefit for us, in that their memory will be lost from the world and [so] we will not learn from their deeds.

However this will [only] be thought by someone who does not understand the matter of what is [considered] practiced throughout the generations and not practiced throughout the generations.\" And the major principle from his words, may his memory be blessed, is that you need to know that any commandment the performance of which has disappeared because its time has passed - such as the commandments that they had in the wilderness, but not afterwards in the Land; and so [too,] the commandment of apportioning the inheritance which was only for the generation that was [present] for the division of the land upon their entrance into the Land - those like these are the ones that are called, 'not practiced throughout the generations.' But all of the commandments that have disappeared from us because it is not found among us that we can do it - but not because the verse makes its dependent on a specific time, such as the this one of the destruction of the seven nations and Amalek in each and every generation that we find them, and even though we have already done to them that which we are obligated through our King David, who destroyed them to the point that there only remain a small number of them that have scattered and been diluted among the nations until their memory is not known, and it is not even in our [power] now to pursue them and to kill them - nonetheless, this commandment is not called because of this a 'commandment that is not practiced [throughout the generations].'

And since [we are in] agreement [about] this, that we know that it is obligatory from the perfection of His goodness, that His desire is to pour down His blessing upon us, we shall say that the matter of the blessing that we say in front of Him is only a mention to arouse ourselves through the words of our mouths that He is the blessed One, and the blessed One that contains all of the goodnesses. And through this good arousal of ourselves and the designation of our thoughts to admit to Him that all of the goodnesses are included in Him and He is the King over them, to send them to all that He desires, we merit through this good action to bring from His blessings upon us. And after this mention and this admission in front of Him, we request from Him that which we need [of] knowledge, or the pardon of our iniquities, or healing, or wealth or anything. And so [too,] after the request from Him, we repeat and admit to Him about this, to say that it comes to us from Him. And this is the opening and the conclusion of the blessings. [The reason for the latter is that we not] be considered like a slave who took a reward from his master and goes away without permission, like a thief.

And [about] the expression, \"may He be blessed,\" that we always mention - which is [in] the reflexive case - we can say that the intention of it is that we are supplicating to Him that it be His will in front of Him to cause the hearts of His creatures to be prepared in front of Him that all should admit to Him and praise Him. And this is the explanation of \"may He be blessed,\" meaning to say, \"It should be Your will in front of You, that all people of the world will relate all blessing to You and admit that everything in the world emanates from You,\" and that His will be completed - as He wants to do good, as we have said.

And this is the great root to all the good that a man does in this world - that his reward from God [is because] he fulfills His desire, in that He wants the good of the creatures.",
                "And from this root that I have said that the mention of blessed be He is an admission in front of Him about all of the blessings, that they are His, and that there is a need to make an admission to Him about this at the beginning of the request and at the end so that one not be like a slave that took his reward from his master and then left without permission; the differences that our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, fixed for us (Berakhot 11a) in the matter of the blessings - that there are some that open with \"Blessed\" and also conclude with \"Blessed,\" there are those that conclude [with it] but do not open [with it] and there are those that open [with it] but do not conclude with it - are established, according to my opinion. How is it? Any blessing in the world - that has a request of something from God, may He be blessed, or the mentioning of a miracle - that is not adjacent to another blessing opens with \"Blessed\" and conclude with \"Blessed\"; for example, 'who creates the light' of the morning prayers and 'who brings the evenings' of the evening prayers; and many like them is from the reason mentioned. But any blessing that is not adjacent to its fellow concludes with \"Blessed,\" but does not open with \"Blessed,\" from this reason. As behold, since he admitted and gave governance to God at the end of the blessing that is adjacent to it, and he did not interrupt after this admission with neither a small or big thing, it is not fit to repeat the admission of the acceptance of His mastery twice at once because of the distinction between the requests of that we ask in front of Him. But it is fitting to conclude with \"Blessed,\" since He interrupted with the request of his needs, as it is fit to go back and mention and to give to his heart the acceptance of His Kingship and his Mastery over him. And in this way, you will find the explanation for all of them according to my opinion, if you work them out. And those that have one adjacent that leave this framework - such as the blessing of grooms and Kiddush and Havdalah and others - have already been answered for us by our teachers, may God protect them. And the reason they taught us about some of them is that sometimes these blessings are said not with adjacent ones; and our Rabbis did not want to distinguish and say when it comes with adjacent ones, say it this way, and when  without adjacent ones,  this. As they always fled from these distinctions in everything that is given over to the hands of the masses, and such is rational.",

                "From the laws of the commandment is that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Berakhot 35a) that even though the Torah only obligated us to recite a blessing after we are satiated from food, the Sages, may their memory be blessed, obligated us to recite a blessing also after any thing from which a person derives pleasure - whether it is from the fruits of the seven species for which the Land is praised or whether it is from any other thing. And they learned the thing from their seeing that the Torah obligates a person to bless God after he is satiated from food that sustains his body with strong sustenance. And they went according to this reason and obligated us to recite a blessing even for  anything from which a body eats - whether it is something [that nourishes] or is not something that nourishes - so long as a man derives pleasure from it. And so too, they, may their memory be blessed, obligated us to recite a blessing before eating. And they learned to say this from logic; as it is fitting that a man not benefit from this world without a blessing. [So] metaphorically, they made the blessing like a request for permission from a homeowner to eat from that which is found in his home.",
                "And there are those among our rabbis whose opinion it is that the Torah obligated us to recite a blessing after all of the seven species, such as dates, wine and fig-cakes (see Berakhot 12a) -  as it obligated us in truth to recite a blessing after those of them that are nourishing -  and said that it was said about all of them, \"And you shall eat and be satiated, and you shall bless\" (Deuteronomy 8:10). And they also said that satiation from Torah writ it only with [as much as] a <i>kabeitsah</i>; as with this [quantity] the mind of a [hungry] person is put at ease. And I see a bit of proof for their words from that which they said at the beginning of the chapter [entitled] Keitsad (Berakhot 35a), in the give and take which is in the Gemara to find the obligation of blessing from the Torah: It is said over there, \"Just as the seven species is something that has benefit and requires a blessing; so too, any item that has benefit, requires a blessing.\" It appears from this that there is no distinction in the seven species between those that give nourishment and those that do not, such that there is an obligation for blessing from the Torah for all of them. But in any event, I saw in Rambam, may his memory be blessed, (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Blessings 1:1 and see 3:12 and Kessef Misneh there) and others are with him, such that it appears to me from their words to say that the central obligation of blessing by Torah writ is only on being satiated in the eating of nourishing food, and not on other species, even if they are from the seven species; such as pomegranates, grapes, fresh figs and dates - since they are not nourishing. As the Torah only obligates on nourishing foods; and because of this, [it] put bread adjacent to the blessing - as it is written (Deuteronomy 8:9), \"you shall eat bread in it,\" and then it reverts, \"And you shall eat and be satiated.\" But we shall listen to the great ones in our generation concerning the laws of the Torah. ",
                "And after this decision (to follow the great ones of the generation), one who is in doubt if he blessed the blessing abridged from three (<i>meein shalosh</i>) after any of the seven species is obligated to recite the blessing because of [the] doubt. And so [too,] if he was in doubt [if he recited] the Grace after Meals; and even if he ate less than enough to satiate, he is obligated to recite the blessing - so long as he ate a  <i>kabeitsah</i>. But one who eats a <i>kazayit</i> or more until a <i>kabeitsah</i> and is in doubt if he blessed or not apparently does not have to recite the blessing, as according to everyone, he is not obligated to recite the blessing; as this amount is rabbinic (and a doubt about having fulfilled rabbinic law does not warrant the reciting of a blessing). But according to that which appears to me from the words of the earlier scholars, whenever he has not been satiated from nourishing food, he does not become obligated to recite the blessing because of [the] doubt. And I say that maybe that which we see many from the masses being lenient about the blessing abridged from three, and [yet] no one - even a total ignoramus - being lenient about the grace after meals is from the fundamental principle of the earlier scholars. As their opinion was to say that the central command of the Torah only arises upon satiation from nourishing food. And it appears that way from the simple understanding of Scripture [as well]. It comes out with regards to blessings as follows: The commandment of the Torah is only to recite the blessing after nourishing food - and not before it - and, according to the later scholars, also on the seven species mentioned in the Torah.",
                "And all other blessings - all of them - are rabbinic, except for one of them which is from Torah writ; and this is explicit in the Gemara in Berakhot 21a, and that is the blessing over the Torah before it. And Ramban, may his memory be blessed, also counted it as a separate positive commandment (on Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Ase 15, where he adds to the count of Rambam). And it appears that the reason for the matter that God, Blessed be He, commanded us in the blessing for the reading of the Torah before it and for food after it is because He, blessed be He, would only request for the physical to serve Him and to admit His goodness after it received a reward from Him, since the animal portion will only recognize His good after the feeling [evoked by the reward]. But the reading of the Torah is from the intellectual portion, and the intellect knows and recognizes, and understands the benefit before [it] receives it. Therefore, God obligates us to admit [His goodness] in front of Him, before the reading of the Torah. And one who concedes the truth will find reason in my words.",
                "And after this we will speak more generally about the rabbinic obligation of blessings. And that is: To recite a blessing before eating and drinking of anything that has any [good] taste to the palate - and so too, afterwards. And so [too,] they obligated us to recite a blessing over every good smell that we smell before smelling, but not after it. And the general principle of the thing is that they fixed a blessing on everything from which the body derives pleasure. And so [too,] did they obligate us (Pesachim 7b) to bless God and to admit [His goodness] over all the good that He has granted us in our doing His precious commandments. And they said that we recite a blessing over them before their doing. And the matter, according to my opinion, is like the reason mentioned adjacently about the reading of the Torah. And so [too,] they obligated us to recite blessings in praise of the Creator over His very mighty deeds, as is mentioned in the chapter [entitled] Haroeh (Berakhot 54a).",
                "And Ezra and his court fixed the wording of all of the blessings (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Blessings 1:5). And even though they, may their memory be blessed, said (Berakhot 48b), \"Moshe established the blessing of nourishment, Yehosua the blessing over the land,\" they [only] said this about the essence of the matter. But Ezra and his court fixed the wording of all the blessings. And it is not fitting to add or subtract from their wording; and anyone who makes a change in them is simply mistaken. And nonetheless, ex post facto, we do not make someone who made a change or forgot a little of the wording of the blessing go back [and repeat it], so long as he mentioned its essential meaning and said the conclusion as established. And they, may their memory be blessed, said (Sotah 32a) that the blessings - besides the mention of [God's] name and the Kingdom of the Heavens - can be said in any language.",
                "And they, may their memory be blessed, obligated us (Shabbat 24a) to mention the holiness of the day in the Grace after Meals, meaning to say the matter of Shabbat or holidays, as is known. And on the days that a person is obligated to eat [a meal] regardless, we make one that forgot and did not mention it in the blessing go back; and these are the two obligatory meals, which are the first night of Pesach and the first night of the holiday of Sukkot. And the opinion of some commentators is that we also make him go back on every Shabbat and every holiday.",
                "And I will write to you, my son, still a bit more about the laws of the blessings of the meal. And [I shall do so] even though we have spoken at great length about this commandment from my fervor for blessing, though my way is not like this in this work in other places. Every Israelite must wash his hands with proper water before eating bread - meaning to say [this water] was not disqualified from the drinking of a dog and no work was done by it, and for one washing, its quantity is a quarter of a <i>log</i>, which is one and a half eggs. And at the very least, one needs to wash to the joint at the end of the fingers for the eating of bread. And he should recite the blessing, \"Blessed are You, Lord, King of the Universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments, and commanded us about the washing of the hands.\" And he recites the blessing over the eating of bread at the beginning, \"Blessed are You, Lord, King of the Universe, who brings out bread from the earth.\"    And if he ate a <i>kazayit</i> of it, he recites the four well-known blessings at the end - 'Who nourishes,' the blessing over the land, 'Who builds Jerusalem' and 'The One who is good and does good,' which they established in Yavneh.",
                "And from when he began to recite the blessing over the bread, the blessing over bread exempts anything that comes during the meal, [from blessing] before and after it - whether they are things that nourish, such as the many cooked foods that people make from the five grains, or whether they are all other types of fruits in the world - anything that a person eats to satiate his hunger, to fill his stomach. [And this is the case] whether he eats these things in the middle of his meal or whether after he finishes eating his bread. And so [too] is the law if these things do not come to satiate him but to accompany the bread - the blessing over the bread exempts them before and after [their eating]. And if they come in the middle of the meal neither to satiate nor to accompany the bread, but just as a delight: If it is something that nourishes, such as a cooked food of the five grains, it is exempted [from a blessing] before and after it by the blessing over the bread. But if it is something that does not nourish and it comes as a delight in the middle of the food, such as fruits that people eat as a delight in the middle of the food, he recites a blessing [upon them] before them, but not after them; and included in this delighting is one who eats salted olives and similar things in the middle of the meal as an a appetizer for the food, and hence he recites a blessing before it, but not after it. Even though dates are fruits, their law is that of nourishing food and [so] they are exempt before it and after it by the blessing over bread. ",
                "[If] many types of fruit were brought in front of him: If their blessings are the same - for example, if all of them are of 'the tree' - he recites the blessing over the one that is [most] beloved to him, and afterwards he eats all of the rest without a blessing. And if none of them are more beloved to him than the rest - if there are from the seven fruits listed in the Torah to praise the Land of Israel among them, he blesses over the one that is earliest in the verse first, and all of [the rest] are exempt from a blessing. But if their blessings are not the same - for example, [some are in the category of] 'fruit of the tree,' and [some are in the category of] 'fruit of the ground' - he recites a blessing for each and every one; and he has that which is [more] beloved to him precede, meaning to say the one that he wants to eat first. And if there is none there that is more beloved to him than its fellow, he has the one that is more important in its blessing precede. And that would be 'fruit of the tree,' since the blessing is more specific to it than 'fruit of the earth,' which includes everything in the earth (including trees). Wine is not included in bread at all and the blessing over bread does not exempt it [from a blessing] (Berakhot 41b). [Rather] it is in the way of a beverage, and [so] we recite a blessing upon it even if it comes in the middle of food. And the Sages, may their memory be blessed, further established another blessing over wine (Berakhot 59b), when [people] bring a second wine in the middle of the meal or after the meal, besides the one they brought at the beginning  - and that is 'the One who is good and does good' - and that is if there are two or more eating. And [the blessing over] wine that is before food exempts all wine that comes after it - whether in the middle of the meal or whether after it (Berakhot 42a). But wine that is in the middle of the food does not exempt wine that is after the food from a blessing [before it]. But from the blessing [after it], Grace after Meals exempts everything; as wine is included in [nourishing] food, since it also nourishes and brings joy.   ",
                "Final waters (to wash hands at the end of the meal) are an obligation. And it needs to be cold water and that if fall into a vessel or into anything that separates between it and the ground, such as shavings and that which is similar to them. And one who did not eat anything [messy] and did not touch salt during the meal does not require it.",
                "A person must mention the holiness of the day on Shabbat and holidays in the third blessing, like we said. And if he did not mention it and he began 'The One who is good and does good,' he goes back to the beginning (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Blessings 2:12). If he did not begin it but he did finish the third blessing, he says this formula on Shabbat: \"Blessed are You, Lord, our God, King of the Universe, who has given Shabbat rest to His people, Israel, as a sign and a covenant. Blessed are You, Lord, who sanctifies the Shabbat.\" And if it is a holiday, we say, \"Blessed are You, Lord, our God, King of the Universe, who has given holidays to His people, Israel, for happiness and joy. Blessed are You, Lord, who sanctifies Israel and the times.\" And so [too,] Rosh Chodesh (the first day of the month), the intermediate festival days, Channukah and Purim have a mention in the Grace after Meals in the third blessing. But if he forgot [in these cases] and concluded the blessing, we do not make him go back, and we do not mention [the holiday] at all. I have received as a tradition from my teachers, may God protect them, that any one who is careful about Grace after Meals will have his food available with dignity all of his days. [These] and the rest of its details are elucidated in Tractate Berakhot (see Tur, Orach Chaim 188). ",
                "And this commandment is practiced by Torah writ in every place and at all times by males. And by females, it is a doubt among our Rabbis whether they are obligated by Torah writ or not. And a man that transgresses this and eats [nourishing] food but does not recite a blessing after it has nullified this positive commandment. And a woman who transgressed and did not recite a blessing has violated a rabbinic commandment, and maybe a Torah commandment. And so [too,] anyone who read Torah in the morning before he recited the blessings that were fixed over the Torah or the blessing 'Everlasting love' (which serves a substitute) has violated a Torah commandment. And therefore one who forgot if he recited the blessing over the Torah in the morning or not goes back and recites the blessing. And one who transgressed and did not recite any of the other blessings in the world besides the ones we mentioned has only violated a commandment of the Sages, but \"one who breaches a fence will be bitten by a snake\" (Ecclesiastes 10:8). And He, may He be blessed, warned about it, 'measure for measure.' And one must be very careful from mentioning a blessing in vain; since there is a severe punishment in the matter, as he mentions the name of [God] for no reason. And the Sages associated (Berakhot 33a) the thing with the negative commandment of \"You shall not take the name of the Lord, your God, in vain.' And come and see how careful the early generations were with this, as behold, Shimshon the Nazirite of God married a Philistine woman that he loved in the stream of Sorek. And [yet] he was so careful in mentioning the name of God, not to mention it at all - whether it was necessary or not necessary - that Delilah recognized that he told her everything [in] his heart, by his mentioning God in his words, when he said to her (Judges 16:17), \"because I am a nazarite of God\" - and as it is written after it (Judges 16:18), \"And she saw that he had told her everything that was [in] his heart.\" And they, may their memory be blessed, said (Sotah 9b), \"And from where did she know?\" And there were those of them that [answered that] words of truth are recognizable, and some of them that said [it was] because Shimshon mentioned God among his words - and even though he did not say it by way of an oath, but by way of a narrative."

And about them is it stated (Deuteronomy 10:19), \"And you shall love the stranger, etc.\" And even though the commandment (Sefer HaChinukh 243) about the Israelite includes him, as it is stated about him (Leviticus 19:18), \"and you shall love your neighbor as yourself\" - since behold, a righteous convert is included in \"your neighbor\" - God added for us a specific commandment about his love. And so too is the thing in the prevention against cheating him. As even though  he was included in \"A man shall not wrong his countryman\" (Leviticus 25:17, Sefer HaChinukh 338), Scripture added a specific prevention about him in its stating, \"You shall not wrong a stranger\" (Exodus 22:20, Sefer HaChinukh 23). And they said in the Gemara (Bava Metzia 59b) that one who wrongs the convert transgresses because of \"[A man] shall not wrong\" and because of \"You shall not wrong a stranger.\" And so too [with this], he nullifies the commandment of \"and you shall love your neighbor\" and the commandment of \"And you shall love the stranger.\"",

And it is so much the way of pleasantnesses and beauty to show kindness and to grant good to one who leaves his people and all the family of the house of his father and mother and comes to take shelter under the wings of a different nation in his love for it, and in his choosing of truth and his hatred for falsehood.

But Ramban, may his memory be blessed, (on Sefer HaMitzvot, Mitzvot Ase 5) wrangled with him and said that the Torah did not command us to pray every day, and also not (not even) every week, and it does not specify a time about the thing at all. And [that is why] they, may their memory be blessed always say that prayer is rabbinic (Berakhot 21a).

Rambam, himself, may his memory be blessed, also wrote that the number of prayers and the format of the prayers is not from Torah writ and that the Torah does not have a set time for prayer. Nonetheless the obligation of the Torah is to supplicate to God every day and to thank Him, since all of the governance is His, [as] is the ability to fulfill every request. To here [are his words]. And it appears that in that the central commandment of the Torah is this and no more, they, may their memory be blessed, established for the one who is in a dangerous place and is not able to stand and concentrate in prayer to say, \"The needs of Your people, Israel, are great, etc.\" - as it appears in Berakhot 29a - so as to fulfill his obligation from the Torah.",
                "From the laws of the commandment is that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Berakhot 31a) that a man is obligated to pray three times: during the day in the morning and in the afternoon; and one time at night. And these three prayer services were fixed corresponding to the sacrifices, as they would sacrifice the daily sacrifice of the morning and the daily sacrifice of the afternoon in the Temple every day. And they also fixed [prayer] at the beginning of the evening, corresponding to the limbs of the burnt-offering of the afternoon that would be consumed and continue through the whole night. And since this prayer of night corresponds to a matter from the sacrifices that is not an obligation - as, if the burnt-offering of the afternoon was consumed while it was still day, it would not be consumed at night - they, may their memory be blessed, also said (Berakhot 27b) that the night prayer service is optional - if a man has free time and finds the presence in himself to pray, he prays; and if not, he does not pray, and there is no guilt in that. And nonetheless, in every place today, Israel is accustomed to pray the evening prayer service consistently every night. And once they took it upon themselves in the way of an obligation, every one of Israel is obligated to pray it regardless. And likewise, they, may their memory be blessed, fixed a fourth payer on Shabbat days and holidays - and that is the one called the additional prayer service (<i>mussaf</i>). And it corresponds to the sacrifice that was added [on these occasions] in the Temple at the time that it was in existence. And they also fixed a fifth payer on Yom Kippur alone - due to the great holiness of the day and because of its being a day of forgiveness and atonement for all - and that is called the sealing (<i>neilah</i>). And the wording of all of the prayers was fixed by Ezra and his court. And on weekdays, they fixed that [we should] pray the eighteen blessings that are well-known in every corner of Israel, besides the blessing about the heretics that was composed by Shmuel the Little with the approval of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and his court, as it is found in Megillah 17b (and Berakhot 28b). And what are they? Three of them recount the praise of God, and three are thanks after it and twelve included the requests for the needs of all of Israel. And they, may their memory be blessed, arranged them according to the order that they are ordered today in the mouths of all of Israel: the first three are in praise of God, may He be blessed; the middle ones in request of their needs, and the last ones in thanks to God for all of the good that He does with us, Blessed be He. And afterwards their exact order was forgotten. But Shimon HaPakuli knew them and he arranged them according to the intended order, as Ezra and his court had ordered them:  to first request intelligence, as if there is no intelligence, there is nothing; and afterwards, repentance, etc., as they are ordered. And on Shabbats and holidays, they only fixed that [we should] pray seven blessings alone, so as not to burden the community on the day of their joy: the first three, the last three and one blessing in the middle which mentions the matter of the day in it - each and every festival and Shabbat according to its content (Berakhot 21a). [This is the case] except for the holiday of Rosh Hashanah, which has nine blessings in its additional service: the three first blessings, the last three blessings and three others, which are <i>malkhiot, zikhronot</i> and <i>shofarot</i>. Everything is as the received tradition in the mouths of all of Israel, even in the mouths of the infants - there is no need to write at length about these matters. However you should know that in the additional prayer service of Rosh Hashanah there is a law that is a novelty from the other prayer services - that the prayer leader (cantor) can fulfill [the obligation of] the one with expertise [in the prayer, as well as] the one without expertise; whereas on other days, he cannot fulfill [the obligation] of the one with expertise. So will you find the matter if you merit to study in the true path.",

And more [so] in the first blessing, about which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Berakhot 30b) that we make one who did not have intent in it go back [and repeat it]. And the matter of intent that they obligated going back because of its [absence] appears to be that the person puts into his heart that he is praying in front of God and he is calling to Him, and [that] he empty his mind from all other thoughts of the world and focus it on this. And [also] that which they said (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 4:5) that there are things that impede a person from praying, even though the time for prayer has arrived. And among them are purity of the hands; covering the nakedness; purity of the place of prayer; and things that rush a person, such as if one needs [to use the restroom]. And [also] that which they said (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5:5) that there are things about which the one praying must be careful, but we do not impede prayer on their account. And these are them: standing; to direct [himself] that he prays facing the Temple; that he fix his body, meaning to say that he stands with awe and fear - with his eyes down and his heart towards the Heavens and he place his hands on his heart, like a slave standing in front of his master; that he fix his clothing and not stand dressed in the way of commoners; that he make his voice even, not too loud and not too soft; and that he bow during the well-known blessings and these are them - during the fathers (the first blessing) at the beginning and at the end, and during thanksgiving (the penultimate blessing), at the beginning and at the end.",

And every person must be careful to pray before he is involved with other tasks, so that he not be negligent.",

And in that this was His will, may He be blessed, blessed be He, He brought counsels from afar to cause ways for their occupation to be in wisdom and [that] they would be pouring over it always every day. And [so] He steered them and arranged proper and pleasant customs and dear and strong mores, in order that they 'learn to know God - from their small ones to their great ones' - and their seed would stand and their name would be preserved forever. And from the statutes that strengthened and supported the wisdom among them was for there to be one entire tribe among them without a portion and inheritance in the lands, and that it not go out to the field to plow and to seed and to dig wells [from which] to water. And all of this was to be a cause for it to spend its time, no matter what, to study the wisdoms and to understand the straight ways of God, and they would teach its judgments to their brothers in each and every country and in all of the cities. And therefore in that this tribe is selected - it and its seed - forever for the occupation of wisdom and understanding, and that all of Israel will [therefore] need to seek Torah from their mouths, agree with their opinions and follow their counsel in everything that they teach them; it was from His will that their brothers provide them all of their sustenance, lest their wisdom get swallowed up, due to the lack of their portion.

And I say from the angle of the simple understanding that the commandment of slaughter is also from the same reason.

As [in this way] all of its blood will come out from there, and we will 'not eat the soul with the flesh.'

And the Sages have already spoken much about the prohibition of pain to living beings in Bava Metzia 32a and in Shabbat 128b, [as to] whether it is a Torah prohibition.

The content of pausing is, for example, that he began to slaughter the esophagus, and before he slaughtered its majority, he interrupted [the] slaughtering. If he paused with this interruption the measure of enough [time] for another slaughter, his slaughter is disqualified. The understanding of another slaughter is the [time needed to] slaughter the skin and the benchmarks of another beast like it, and like that of small beast (lamb) for a chicken. And there are those that are stringent, that the measure is only enough for the slaughter of the majority of the [two] benchmarks with a beast, and the majority of one benchmark with a bird. But if he slaughters with a bad (meaning dull) knife, even if he goes back and forth the whole day, his slaughter is fit - except if he brings it back and forth after he slaughtered the majority of only one benchmark in a beast; as if he brings a bad knife back and forth on the minority that remains of it like the measure of pausing, his slaughter is disqualified.",
                "The matter of pressing is one who presses the knife, like one who cuts a radish, at the time of the slaughter - meaning to say that he does not bring the knife back and forth - in this manner, the slaughter is disqualified (Mishneh Torah, Ritual Slaughter 3:11)",
                "The matter of submerging that we have received in the tradition is that the knife must stay revealed at the time that we slaughter. And because of this, they, may their memory be blessed, said (Chullin 30b) that if one covers the knife under one benchmark and slaughtered the second, or even if he covered it under the skin and slaughtered the benchmarks, or even [if he did so] under the tangled wool or even under a cloth (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Ritual Slaughter 3:9, 10) that is very stuck to the neck, the slaughter is disqualified. But it if is not very stuck, it is not disqualified by [a cloth]. ",
                "The matter of sliding is that which we received that even though the slaughter is from the neck, there are well-known boundaries upon the neck within which the slaughter is fit, but not below [the lower] boundary and not above [the higher one]. And the boundary of the place of slaughter on the windpipe is from the slant of the Adam's apple and below (Chullin 19a) to the top of the small protrusions of the lungs - not until the bottom of the protrusions that are connected to the lungs, but rather their tops. And this measurement is the entire part of the neck that the beast stretches out at the time that it grazes naturally without duress. And on the esophagus (Chullin 44a), one leaves the grasp of a hand above. And below, the measurement is until the esophagus gets 'hairy' - meaning to say that many perforations are found there, in the likeness of the stomach. And some (see Rashi and Tosafot on Chullin 44a) say that the understanding of the grasp of a hand is enough for three fingers, and some say [it is] enough that one grabs it with two fingers from the two sides of the neck, and that is the measurement of the width of one finger. And that measurement is with a [domesticated] beast and a [wild] animal, but with a bird, everything is according to its largeness or smallness. And they said in the Gemara (Chullin 19a) that [in the case of] one who began the slaughter of the windpipe and slaughtered a third, and afterwards moved the knife from the place of slaughtering - meaning above the slant of the Adam's apple - and cut a third, and after that brought the knife back to the place of slaughtering and slaughtered a third, the slaughter is disqualified. As we always need in this law of sliding that the majority of the death of the beast be with slaughter and that at the time of the leaving of life from it - meaning the middle third - that then, the majority is with [proper] slaughter. Anything that is like that is fit; [but if was done] in another matter, it is disqualified. And this [particular] matter of sliding is only found with the windpipe and above adjacent to the slant of the Adam's apple. As below, adjacent to the protrusions of the lungs, its [disqualifying] piercing is with the smallest amount, and the law of sliding one third is not relevant to it at all. And so too, with the esophagus - whether above or whether below - its piercing is with the smallest amount, and the law of sliding one third is not relevant to it at all. ",
                "Anyone who is not an expert in these four things that disqualify the slaughter is not permitted to slaughter (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Ritual Slaughter 4:1). And if he did slaughter, it is forbidden to eat from his slaughter. And even if after he slaughtered, they asked him if he was careful about them and he said, \"Yes, yes,\" there is no substance to his words - as since he did not know them at first, maybe he was negligent about them and it is not remembered [by him] at all. ",
                "And besides these four things that we mentioned that every slaughterer needs to know, the sages obligated us to know a fifth thing - and even though it is not from the laws of slaughtering [per se] - since this matter always comes up at the time of slaughter, and the beast is made into a carcass with the thing. And if the slaughterer does not know it, he will be feeding carcasses to everyone. And therefore they also said about this [that] it is forbidden to eat from the slaughter of any butcher that does not know it. And this is the prohibition that is called tearing. And its matter is that the windpipe and the esophagus - both of them or even one of them - is torn from the place of their connection with the jawbone and the flesh upon it. And [it is] when they are torn from there completely, or even it they are not torn completely, but rather their majority dangles - [then,] behold it is forbidden. And that is when it is fully detached (Chullin 44a) - meaning to say [that] when we forbid it when its majority is dangling, it is to say that all of it is in this manner, that the dangling is from this [side] and that [side]. As [with] anything that is [detached] in this manner, even that [part of it] which is connected is not connected well, and so, they are considered completely torn. But if the benchmarks were dangling from one side - meaning to say it was detached and torn from the jawbone only in one place - even though the majority was torn - since the tear is only in one place, the minority is connected with a lasting connection [and] that minority saves [it] and it is fit; even though [the tear] is in the majority of the benchmark and there is only [a minority] remaining. And all the more so do we render it fit when the whole benchmark is connected to the flesh on the jawbone, even though the jaw is cut and completely taken out from the place of its connection in the head - the connection of the flesh with the benchmark saves [it]. And it comes out that tearing forbids when the benchmarks are torn in many places, this way and that, in the majority. But in any case, [if it is only] in one place, the prohibition of tearing does not [apply]. And this tearing that we said does not make a beast into a 'torn' (terminally ill) animal. Rather, so have we learned from the tradition, that torn benchmarks cannot be slaughtered - meaning to say that the commandment of slaughter would not be [fulfilled] with torn benchmarks. And hence one who slaughters torn benchmarks - behold, it is as if he did not slaughter, and as if the beast died on its own, such that it is a carcass. And even though they made a bird fit with [only] one benchmark - as we said - so long as one is torn before he slaughtered the other, the slaughter does not permit it and it is forbidden. So have we learned from the tradition. Every one of Israel must know the five laws that we mentioned - pausing; pressing; submerging; sliding; and tearing - to be an expert in them, before he slaughters. And it is forbidden to eat from the slaughter of anyone who is not an expert in them and slaughtered [regardless]. And even if we ask him afterwards and he says, \"I am sure that I slaughtered properly,\" we do not listen to him at all. ",
                "And one who wants to slaughter also needs to know the matter of checking the knife - that the Sages required him to check with the fingernail and with the flesh in a knife's three [relevant] directions (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Ritual Slaughter 1:23). And if we feel a nick in it - even the smallest amount - the slaughter [done with such a knife] is forbidden. And it is permitted to slaughter with anything that cuts well that does not have a nick in it at all. And if the knife is found to be nicked after the slaughter, we say that it got nicked with the skin and that the benchmarks were slaughtered with a nicked knife. And we say this when bones were not cut with the same knife after the slaughter - meaning to say that the knife did not touch anything from which it is possible for it to be nicked. But if we know with certainty that something from which it is possible for it to be nicked touched the knife after the slaughter, we assume the nick is from that thing. And anytime we are in doubt if it touched something that [could] nick it or not, we assume it is from the skin. This is what appears [to come out] nicely from the disagreement between Rav Huna and Rav Chasda in this matter at the beginning of the first chapter of Chullin 10a. And [also] the law of that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Chullin 3b) that we assume anyone who is found proximate to [the involvement with] slaughter to be an expert. And even if he is in front of us, we do not have to test him, as we rely on the assumption. And there are some commentators that said that if they are in front of us, we do test them. And the rest of the details of the commandment are elucidated in Tractate Chullin in the first two chapters (see Tur Yoreh Deah 1-28).",
                "And this commandment is practiced in every place and at all times by males and females, as even females are warned not to eat from a [domesticated] beast, a [wild] animal or a bird without proper slaughter. And [women] have permission to slaughter - and their slaughter is fit for any person - if they know the laws of slaughter and are expert in them. And the Sages said (Chullin 2a) that even the slaughter of minors is fit, so long as an adult who is an expert in the laws of slaughter  sees them slaughter properly. Yet the Sages warned us (Chullin 12a) not to give them to slaughter at the outset, since they commonly blunder, due to their limited intellect, and a loss will be found in the matter.",
                "And one who transgresses this and is not careful about eating the meat of a [domesticated] beast, a [wild] animal or a bird that has one of the five disqualifications that we mentioned happen to them or that was slaughtered with a knife that was not checked has violated this positive commandment, besides having violated the negative commandment of \"You shall not eat any carcass,\" [for which] he is lashed for eating a <i>kazayit</i> of them - as we shall write in this Order, with God's help (Sefer HaChinukh 572). And they, may their memory be blessed, also said in the second chapter of Chullin 32a, \"Everything that is disqualified by its slaughter is a carcass\"; meaning to say, any time that the beast is disqualified in the place [on its body] of slaughter - which are the benchmarks - such as if one of the five disqualifications that we mentioned happened to it, or if he slaughtered it with a knife that was not checked, behold, that is called a carcass. \"And anything, the slaughter of which was proper and something else caused it to be disqualified, is called 'torn'\"; meaning to say, if none of the disqualifications occurred regarding the slaughter, the checking of the knife or the benchmarks, but rather something else caused it to become disqualified - such as it becoming 'torn' with one of the eighteen well-known [ways of being] 'torn,' that I mentioned earlier (Sefer HaChinukh 73) - behold, that is called, 'torn,' which is to say that he gets lashes on account of a 'torn' animal. And even though there are lashes for both of them, the difference to us that comes of it is regarding the warning. And the matter of that which we learned, that everything that is disqualified by its slaughter is a carcass, is not that the main carcass that is mentioned in Scripture should be that which is made into a carcass by its slaughter. As it is certainly an animal that died on its own due to a sickness or with some matter [that causes it to die] that is called an undifferentiated carcass. Rather the author of the Mishnah is coming to teach that anything that is not slaughtered properly is considered like it died on its own."

                "<b>To not eat a limb from the living:</b> That we were prevented that we not eat a limb from the living - meaning to say, a limb that we cut from an animal when it is still alive. And about this is it stated (Deuteronomy 12:23), \"and you shall not eat the soul with the meat.\" And so they did they say, \"'And you shall not eat the soul with the meat' - that is a limb from the living.\" And we say in Tractate Chullin 102b, \"One who ate a limb from the living and meat from the living is lashed twice\" - since there are two negative commandments about it: the one which we mentioned; and the second [is] \"and flesh torn in the field shall you not eat\" (Exodus 22:30), which is a negative commandment about the one that eats meat from the living, as I have written in the commandment not to eat a 'torn' animal (Sefer HaChinukh 73). And the warning for the limb from the living was repeated in another place in Parshat Noach, as it is stated (Genesis 9:4), \"But meat with the soul, its blood, you shall not eat.\"",
                "It is from the roots of the commandment [that it is] in order that we not train ourselves in the trait of cruelty, which is a most disgusting trait. And in truth, there is no greater cruelty in the world then the one who cuts a limb or meat from an animal while it is still alive in front of him and eats it. And I have already written many times [about] the great benefit that comes to us in our acquisition of the good traits and [when] we distance ourselves from the bad traits, as the good will cling to the good. And the good God wants to do good, and hence He commanded us to choose the good. And this is my approach to most of the commandments, according to the angle of their simple understanding. ",
                "From the laws of the commandment is that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Chullin 101b) that the prohibition of the limb from the living is [applicable to] a [domesticated] beast, a [wild] animal and a bird that are pure, but not to impure ones. And [also] that which they said (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Forbidden Foods 5:3, 4) that the prohibition is one; whether it is a limb that has meat, tendons and bones - such as a hand or a foot - or a limb that has no bone - like the tongue, the testicles, the spleen, the kidneys, the heart and similar to them. However the limb that has no bone is forbidden because of a limb from the living, whether it is all cut off, or whether part of it is cut off. But a limb that has a bone is not liable on account of a limb from a living animal, until it is separated like its formation - meat, tendons and bones. But if he separated meat from the living, he is liable for a 'torn' animal, as we elucidated, and not on account of a limb from the living. One who eats a <i>kazayit</i> from a limb from the living is lashed for it. And even if he ate a complete limb, [only] if there is a <i>kazayit</i> in it is he liable. [But if there is] less than a <i>kazayit</i>, he is exempted. If he cut a <i>kazayit</i> from the limb according to its formation - meat, tendons and bones - and he ate it, he is lashed, even though there is only the smallest amount of meat upon it. However, if he divided the limb after he detached it and separated the meat from the tendons and from the bones, he is only lashed if there is a <i>kazayit</i> from the meat by itself - and the bones and the tendons do not join with it [to make up] a <i>kazayit</i>, since he has changed it from its formation.  ",
                "If he divided this limb and ate it a little at a time, if there is a <i>kazayit</i> in what he ate, he is liable; and, if not, he is exempted (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Forbidden Foods 5:4). If he took a <i>kazayit</i> from the limb according to its formation - meat, tendons and bones - and he ate it, he is liable, even though it divided in his mouth before he swallowed it, as that is the way of eating. If he detached the limb from the living and [the animal] became 'torn' in his taking it, and he ate it, he is liable on two [counts], because of a limb from the living and because of a 'torn' animal - as behold, both prohibitions come together (at the same time). And so [too,] one who detached forbidden fat (<i>chelev</i>) from the living and ate it, is liable for two. If he detached forbidden fat from a 'torn' animal, he is lashed [for] three [separate sins]. Flesh that is dangling [from] a beast and a limb dangling [from] it is forbidden if it cannot come back to life - even though it did not separate, but rather was [connected to the animal when it was] slaughtered. But we do not administer lashes for it. And if the beast died, we see it as if it fell while [it was] alive. Therefore, we administer lashes on account of a limb from the living. However if it could come back to life - behold, it is permitted, if the beast is slaughtered. If the limb from the living was dislocated or one crushed it or ground it - such as if one crushed the testicles or severed them - behold, it is not forbidden from Torah writ; as behold, it has a little life. And therefore it does not stench. But nonetheless it is forbidden to eat it due to the custom practiced by Israel from antiquity; as behold, it is similar to life from the living. If the flesh covers most of a broken bone and most of the circumference of the break, behold it is permissible. But if the bone came outside, behold it is forbidden; and when the beast or bird is slaughtered, he should cut off the limb and a bit from the place of the break and throw it out - and the rest is permitted. If the bone was broken, [even when] the flesh covers most of it - if that flesh was pulverized since it decayed, like the flesh that a physician would scrape off; the flesh that was on it was [full of] holes; the flesh was cracked, or it was scraped like a type of ring; the flesh on top was scraped to the point where only like a peel remained on the flesh; or the flesh was decayed below from all of the bone to the point that the flesh that covers the bone is not touching the bone - in all of these [cases], we instruct to forbid until the flesh is healed. And if he ate from any of these, we administer lashes of rebellion upon him. One who extends his hand into the innards of the beast, cuts off from the spleen, from the kidneys and similar to them, and left the pieces in its innards, and [then] slaughtered it afterwards - behold those pieces are forbidden on account of the limb from the living, even though it is within its innards. But if he cut off from the embryo in its innards and did not remove it and slaughtered it afterwards - behold the pieces of the embryo are permitted, since it did not go outside.",

And one who transgresses it and ate a limb from the living or a <i>kazayit</i> of it in the manner that we mentioned is liable for lashes. And this is one of the seven commandments that are upon all people of the world more generally. But there is nonetheless a difference in the details of the commandment between Israel and the rest of the nations. And it is all as I have written in the Order of Vayishma Yitro (Sefer HaChinukh 26). And it appears that the obligation for the rest of the nations with the limb from the living is whether with pure [animals] or whether with impure [animals]. And so did the elder instruct (see Mishneh Torah, Laws of Kings and Wars 9:13)."

And even though these beasts are outside of the Land, it is an obligation upon us to bring them to the selected place. And about this is it stated (Deuteronomy 12:26), \"But your consecrated things that shall be for you and your vows shall you carry and come.\" And even though the commandment to sacrifice in the Choice House came to us, as I have written in this Order (Sefer HaChinukh 440), nonetheless, this specific commandment comes to us about the sacrifices [from] outside of the Land. And so is it in Sifrei Devarim 77:1-2, \"'But your consecrated things' [...] - it is only speaking of his consecrated things [from] outside of the land; 'shall you carry and come,' teaches that he is obligated to care for bringing them until he brings them to the Choice House.\" And they [also] said there that the obligation is with sin-offerings, guilt-offerings, burnt-offerings, and peace-offerings. And it is possible for us to say that [the reason] a commandment was specified for the consecrated [animals from] outside of the Land, is to warn us about them, because the burden with them is greater than the consecrated [animals from within] the Land, since [the latter] are closer to the [Temple].",

And even though it is true that is expounded in Sifrei to be about the consecrated [animals from] outside of the Land, this is not truly a proof to make them two commandments. And in the third chapter of Tractate Temurah 17b they expounded it in a different way. As there they said, \"'But your consecrated things' - these are the exchanged animals; 'that shall be for you' - these are the offspring; 'and your vows' - that is a vow; 'shall you carry and come' - it is possible that they bring them to the Choice House and prevent water and food from them such that they die; [hence] we learn to say, 'And you shall effect your burnt-offering, the meat and the blood' (Deuteronomy 12:27) - in the way that you act with the burnt-offering, so should you act with the exchanged animal, and in the way that you act with the peace-offerings, so should you act with the offspring of the peace-offerings and the animals exchanged for them.\" The whole content of this commandment is like the content of the third commandment in this Order (Sefer HaChinukh 440) and there is one root to both of them.

And about this is it stated (Deuteronomy 13:1), \"do not add to it.\" And how is the addition? Rambam, may his memory be blessed, wrote (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Rebels 2:9), \"For example, one who instructs that chicken meat with milk is forbidden by Torah writ - that is adding upon the word of the received tradition. As so did we receive about the understanding of 'you shall not boil a goat, etc.' - that the meat of a [domesticated] beast and a [wild] animal are forbidden to cook in milk, but not chicken meat. And so [too,] if he instructed that meat from a [wild] animal is permitted with milk, he has transgressed on account of 'you shall not subtract.'

And the matter according to what I have heard myself from the mouth of my teacher - may God protect him - is, for example, one that lays two fit tefillin on his head or on his arm; and so [too,] one who makes five [sections] in his tefillin; and likewise, one who takes two fit lulavs in his hand and anything similar to it; and so [too,] one who sits in a sukkah (booth) after the holiday with the intention of fulfilling the commandment of sukkah, even though he know that its time has passed - as we only transgress on account of 'do not add' when one has intent to do the commandment - and so [too,] one who takes the lulav after the holiday and has intent to do the commandment while knowing that the holiday has passed. And so is it in the Gemara in Rosh Hashanah 28b in the chapter [entitled] Rauhu Beit Din, as they conclude there, \"Rather Rava says, 'To fulfill [a commandment] does not require intent'\" - meaning to say that commandments do not require intent - \"'to transgress: during its time does not require intent, not in its time requires intent.'\" But [in the case of] one who takes the lulav on the holiday, even a hundred times a day, with intention to fulfill [the commandment] each and every time, there is no [issue] of 'do not add'; and so [too,] one who blows the shofar on the day of Rosh Hashanah, and even many times; and so [too,] anything like this. And there is no need to say that there is no [issue of] 'do not add' here, if one takes a disqualified lulav; and so [too] if he grouped a disqualified specie with [a fit lulav], according to the [legal conclusion] - as it is established for us that  there is no need for a grouping. This is the general principle of the matter of this prohibition that my teachers, God protect them, distilled from the words of the Gemara after much effort.

And because of this, the verse was lengthy to say, \"you may give it to the stranger\" - to teach you this. As if it were not so, there is no need to teach us to who to give that which we have. And it should not be said that it is coming to permit its benefit, as it is already written in another place (Leviticus 7:24), \"Fat of the carcass and fat of the 'torn' [animal] may be used for any work.\" And from here they, may their memory be blessed, learned (Avodah Zarah 65b) the law that exuding taste that spoils is permissible. As we know through this that the Torah only forbids and makes liable for the eating of things that are fitting for people to eat; not for something that disgust a person's soul, as that is considered just like any dirt. And this is the dispensation that is mentioned in the Gemara about forbidden vinegar that fell into split beans, since it spoils them. And from this principle, we have become accustomed to purge vessels in boiling water that have not been used for a day, even though there is not sixty parts in the water corresponding to [the mass] of the vessel - as the absorbed [prohibited matter] that comes out from [it] when it is has not been used in a day is spoiled. And since the absorbed [matter] went out from the vessel due to the power of the water the nature of which is to purge and take out all of what is absorbed in the vessel - even though the vessel sits afterward with the absorbed waters that the vessel expunged  into the boiling waters that are less than sixty [parts to it] and goes back and absorbs from it - it is not prohibited through this, as the [absorbed matter] is like a putrid carcass, which the Torah permitted, as we have said.",
                "And maybe you will say, and how is it that we permit to eat even a putrid carcass from the outset. Is there [not a prohibition here of] \"Do not be disgusting?\" (see Mishneh Torah, Laws of Forbidden Foods 17:29) The answer to this is that whenever it is something small like this and also that it is absorbed in the vessel and spoiled within it and its strength is weakened - in such a manner as this - there is certainly not [a violation of] \"Do not be disgusting,\" and [so] it is permissible from the outset. And you should not at all ask and say [that] if so, how is it that the Torah permitted the vessels of Midian by purging - was not the absorbed [matter] not [yet] spoiled, according to that which was said in the Gemara (Avodah Zarah 67b), that the Torah had only forbidden [and required purging of] a vessel that had been used in the day; as I can say to you that they purged these vessels in much water, which had sixty [parts] corresponding to the [mass] of the vessels (see Tosafot on Chullin 108b, s.v. <i>shenafal</i>).

And we do not concern ourselves with that which it exuded at all, since it is from the disgusting things and spoils the taste of the [food]. As behold, this is similar to [the law of] a putrid carcass which is not forbidden, as we have said. And nonetheless,  it is necessary that there be two parts of what is in the pot corresponding to the body of the swarming creature, so that it will be nullified by the majority. As if not, the food will be considered like the body of the swarming creature itself, and the Torah forbids its body, even though it is disgusting.

There is no misappropriation of those sacrifices that have become permissible to eat, such as meat of the sin-offering and guilt-offering after the sprinkling of their blood, or the two breads after the sprinkling of the blood of the two lambs. Even if a commoner ate from one of these and similar to them - since they are permissible for some people to benefit from, anyone who benefits from them has not misappropriated.

And the law is the same for the rest of all the consecrated which is only for God - whether it is from the consecrated for the altar or the consecrated of the [Temple] upkeep: If he benefited of the value of a small coin, he is lashed. If he misappropriated inadvertently, he pays what he benefited and an addition of a fifth, and he brings a ram [purchased] with two <i>sela</i> and sacrifices it as a guilt-offering and it atones for him - and this is what is called the guilt-offering of misappropriations, as it is stated (Leviticus 5:15-16), \"inadvertently from the consecrated things of the Lord, etc. he shall bring his guilt-offering to the Lord, etc. And that which he sinned from the holy, he shall pay and add its fifth upon it.\" The payment of the principal with the addition of the fifth and the bringing of the sacrifice is a positive commandment (Sefer HaChinukh 127).

And one who shears his ox or works with it is lashed from Torah writ. But plucking is not like shearing. And Rambam, may his memory be blessed, wrote (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Trespass 1:7), \"It appears to me that he is not lashed until he shears enough for the double width of a <i>sit</i>, - [so that] it not be more stringent than Shabbat.\" [If] it is a doubt whether it is consecrated things, such as a beast that was [only a possible] first-born, and similar to it - behold, they are forbidden in shearing and work, but one who shears or works with them is not lashed (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Trespass 1:8). A consecrated beast that contracted a blemish upon it and was redeemed is not permitted for shearing and work and [remains] with its prohibition until it is slaughtered, as we elucidated (Sefer HaChinukh 441). If it is slaughtered after its redemption, its eating is permitted. About what are these words speaking? When their consecration came before their blemish, or [only] a temporary blemish preceded their consecration. But if one consecrates one with a permanent blemish to the Temple, it is only rabbinically forbidden in shearing and work. And [so] if it is redeemed, it is like non-sacred in all matters; and it goes out to be non-sacred, to be shorn and worked - except for the first-born and the tithe. [In those latter cases,] the sanctity rests upon their bodies, and they do not ever go out to be non-sacred to shear and to work, even though they were ones with blemishes from the beginning. It is forbidden to have a first-born or a disqualified consecrated [animal] breed. And it is permissible a priori to pluck the hair from consecrated [animals] in order to show the blemish to an expert. But that hair that he plucked - or that shed from the beast, or from a first-born or from the tithe - behold, it is forbidden to benefit [from] it, even after they were slaughtered because of their blemish. [This is a] decree lest he will delay them, since they are not bringing atonement. But wool that shed from a sin-offering or a guilt-offering is permitted for benefit after being slaughtered because of their blemish; as since they are coming for atonement, he will not delay them. And if it was plucked from a fire-offering - behold, this is a doubt. And behold, all that detached from the consecrated [animals] after they contracted the blemish is permissible for benefit, since he did not pluck it with his hand; except for the first-born, as even that which detached from it after it contracted the blemish is forbidden in benefit. One who slaughters a first-born or the rest of the consecrated [animals] plucks from this [side] and that [side] to make a place for the knife, but he does not move [the hair] from its place. Those consecrated for the [Temple] upkeep are rabbinically forbidden even in shearing and work, but they are not forbidden from Torah writ. Hence one who shears them or works with them is not lashed [from Torah writ], but we lash him with lashes of rebellion. One who consecrates an embryo for the altar, its mother [becomes] rabbinically forbidden in work. They decreed about it, as its work enfeebles the embryo.

And therefore any commandment that is in commemoration of the exodus from Egypt is weighty for us and very beloved. Hence from the angle of the great weightiness that there is to it, the Torah warned us to begin it six hours before the set time for that miracle, which is the beginning of the (holiday) fifteenth day.

And from that which the verse obligated to dispose of it on that day, we knew that part of that day would necessarily be permitted, as it is impossible to determine the exact first instant of a day and dispose of it then. And since it is like this: That part of the day is permitted, and Scripture did not elucidate which part of it is permissible, we divided it equally from true logic - as if you divide in [any] other way, there will be no foundation to the thing at all. And that is what they said over there, \"[The word,] 'but (<i>akh</i>),' divides.\" And those that explained that <i>akh</i> is <i>chats</i> (divide) in [the letter susbtitution pattern called], \"<i>achs, betaa</i>\" did not understand the words of the Sages.

But Ramban, may his memory be blessed, disagrees with him (in his glosses to the Sefer HaMitzvot, Mitzot Lo Taase 199). And according to his opinion, there is no negative commandment in this, since the law is like Rabbi Shimon, who disagrees with Rabbi Yehudah.

And so is it explicit in the Talmud Yerushalmi Pesachim 1:4 that according to the words of Rabbi Yehudah, the word, \"upon it,\" refers back to its slaughter; and according to the words of Rabbi Shimon to its eating, as it was eaten in the evening. And that which appears in the Gemara, \"According to everyone, however, chamets is prohibited,\" and so [too,] what they said, \"The rabbis made an extra distancing, so as not to reach a Torah prohibition\" - all of this is true, that there is a Torah prohibition to benefit from chamets after six hours. However, the prohibition that comes upon it is from the commandment to dispose [of chamets] from Torah writ from six hours onward, but certainly there is no negative commandment in it at all - like Rabbi Shimon, like whom we hold.

And [this] is like the matter that is written (Deuteronomy 27:7), \"And you shall offer peace-offerings\" and it continues, \"and you shall rejoice on your holiday.\" And [concerning] the offering of peace-offerings, they, may their memory be blessed, said (Chagigah 6b), \"Women are obligated in joy\" - meaning that even they are obligated to bring peace-offerings of joy. And they, may their memory be blessed, also said (Chagigah 8a), \"Rejoice in all types of rejoicing.\" And included in this is the eating of meat and the drinking of wine, to wear new clothes, the distribution of fruit and types of sweets to the youths and the women and to play musical instruments in the Temple alone - and that is the joy of the drawing house (<i>simchat beit hashoeva</i>) that is mentioned in the Gemara (Sukkah 50a). All that we mentioned is included in \"And you shall rejoice on your holiday.\" And they, may their memory be blessed, said in Tractate Pesachim 109a, \"A man is obligated to gladden his children and the members of his household on a festival.\" And it is said there, \"It was taught, Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says, 'At the time when the Temple is standing, joy is only with meat, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 27:7), \"And you shall offer peace-offerings, etc.\" Now [...] joy is only with wine, as it is stated (Psalms 104:15), \"And wine gladdens the heart of man.\"'\" And they said further, \"With what should one make them rejoice? Men with what is fit for them, with wine. And women with what is fit for them, with nice clothes.\" And the Torah also warned us to include the poor and the strangers (converts) and the weak in the joy, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 16:14), \"you, the Levite, the stranger, the orphan and the widow.\"",
                "It is from the roots of the commandment [that it is] because man is designed in [such] a way that his nature requires rejoicing occasionally, [just] like it requires nourishment regardless, and rest and sleep. And God wanted to give us - 'His people and the flock of His grazing' -  merit and [so] commanded us to make the rejoicing for His sake, so that we could merit in all of our deeds in front of Him. And behold, He fixed for us times during the year for holidays, to remember upon them the miracles and the goodnesses that He granted us. And He commanded us then at those times to support the physical with something of joy that it needs. And it comes out as a big remedy for us that the satiation of joyous occasions be for His sake and to remember Him; as this thought will be a fence, that we do not go further out than is enough from the straight path.

And about this is it stated (Deuteronomy 16:16), \"Three times a year all your males shall appear before the Lord, your God.\" And the content of the commandment is that every man go up to the Temple and appear there with any male child that he has who is able to walk by himself on his [own] feet. And from this obligation of appearing is also that he sacrifice a fire-offering there. And this sacrifice is called the fire-offering of being seen (<i>olat reiah</i>).

Hence they come three times a year to the House of God. And it is like their saying metaphorically, \"Behold, we are like slaves to God, entering and coming under the shade of His roof, relying upon His strength forever and ever in the love for Him and in the fear of Him; and no foreigner shall come among us, as we alone are the children of His house.\" And with this act, our minds are aroused and we place His fear into our hearts and we fix His love into our thoughts, and we merit to receive His kindness and His blessing. And the obligation comes to us only upon the males, since they are the essence of the household, and the infants and wives are attached to them; and when there is control over [the males] as slaves, the control is [also] established over all that is under their hand. And from this foundation was the commandment at the appointed time of the sabbatical year during the holiday of Sukkot made unique, to gather there the men, women, infants and strangers. As that year liberates all and removes the subjugation from all the living - from all flesh - to return everything back under the hand of the Master, the Lord of Hosts. And then during that year the control over those under them is not effective, as there is no domination in the Land at that time. And there is another reason with us for the commandment of gathering (<i>hakhel</i>) - we shall write it in its place in the Order of Atem Netsavim (Sefer HaChinukh 612) with God's help.",

And it is from the conditions of this commandment that these judges should be one level above the other. That is that we set up twenty-three judges in each and every city that is fit for this number, all gathered together in one place from the gates of the city - and that is called a small sanhedrin. And in Jerusalem, we set up a large court of seventy judges, and we stand up one [judge] over these seventy and he is called the head of the academy - and he is the one that the Sages also called, <i>nassi</i> - and they would all be gathered in their place that is designated for them. And in a place that is small of number, such that it is not fit for a small sanhedrin, they should stand up three [that] should judge the small thing and they bring the difficult thing to the [court] that is above them. And likewise do they appoint supervisors among the people that circulate in the city, the markets and the streets [and] observe the matters of people in commercial buying and selling - so that there not be wrongdoing, even with a small thing. And the commandment that comes about this is that which He, may He blessed, stated (Deuteronomy 16:18), \"Judges and officers shall you place for yourself in all of your gates.\" And the language of Sifrei Devarim 144 (and see Sanhedrin 16b), \"From where [do we know] that we appoint a court for all of Israel? [Hence] we learn to say, 'Judges and officers.' And from where [do we know] that we appoint one [judge] on top of them all? [Hence] we learn to say, 'shall you place for yourself.'

And [it is] like the Sages say, that much habit is what is behind nature - meaning to say that [just] like nature constrains a man to what it wants, so [too] does a strong habit repeat itself, like a persistent nature that constrains him to always go in the way of the habit.

However the ordination of all the generations was not with the hand, like the ordination of Moshe; but rather they would check if the one they wanted to ordain was an expert in the wisdom of the Torah and if he was healthy and complete in his intellect and if was a man that loves truth and hates wrongdoing and all of its content. And after great investigation into his makeup and his wisdom, three ordained sages - or even if only one of them was ordained - would say to him, \"Behold, you are ordained.\" And from that time, they call him, \"rabbi,\" and he has permission afterwards to even adjudicate cases of penalties. And the law that a judge [who is] very old, a eunuch, blind even in one of his eyes or does not have children is not fit to be on a sanhedrin; the law that the kings of the House of David judge and we judge them, but not the [other] kings of Israel, since they are not assumed to be fit like [the House of David]; the law [about] until when the Great Sanhedrin or a small one or a court of three sit [in judgement]; and the rest of its details are [all] elucidated in Tractate Sanhedrin.",

Yet regardless, anyone ordained in the Land is fit to judge even outside of the Land. And this is what they, may their memory be blessed, said (Makkot 7a), \"Sanhedin is practiced in the Land and outside of the Land.\" However they do not have permission to judge capital cases - not in the Land and not outside the Land - except at the time of the [Temple], and at the time when the Sanhedrin is fixed in Jerusalem.",

                "By way of this idea that I have raised for you, my son - through it, will I explain to you a certain homelitical teaching, which is in the end of the chapter [entitled] HaZahav in Bava Metzia 59b, regarding the story of Rabbi Eliezer the Great and the \"oven of Achnai,\" which bewilders all who hear it. They said there, \"Rabbi Natan met Eliyahu, etc. He said to him, 'What did the Holy One, Blessed be He, do in that hour?' He said to him, 'He smiled and said, \"My sons have vanquished Me...\"'\" - meaning that the Holy One, blessed be He, was happy that His sons were walking in the way of the Torah and its commandment, to incline after the many. And that which He said, \"My sons have vanquished Me,\" God forbid that there is any victory before Him, blessed be He. Rather, the explanation about this idea is that in the debate of Rabbi Eliezer with his colleagues, the truth was with Rabbi Eliezer; and like the words of the heavenly voice (<i>bat kol</i>) that decided like him. But even though the truth was with him about this - because of his greater analysis over his colleagues - they could not completely fathom his opinion. And [so] they did not want to concede to him even after the heavenly voice; and they brought a proof from the law set in the Torah that commanded us to always go after the many - whether they say the truth or whether they are mistaken. And about this was the response of the Creator, blessed be He, \"My sons have vanquished Me.\" Meaning, since they turned away from the true path - for Rabbi Eliezer had surmised the truth about this - and they came upon him from the power of the Torah commandment that I commanded them to always listen to the majority; if so, one must nonetheless concede to them this time - like their words - that the truth be absent. And behold, it is as if the Master of truth was defeated.",
                "From the laws of the commandment is that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Sanhedrin 87a), that even though one who transgresses that which the Sages explained about the words of the Torah, transgresses this negative commandment of \"you shall not stray\"; nonetheless a man does not have the designation of a rebellious judge - known in the Gemara at the end of Sanhedrin 89a, who is liable for the death penalty - until he disagrees with the Great Court (see Mishneh Torah, Laws of Rebels 3:5, 7), and that he is a sage that has reached [the level] of pronouncing decisions [and] is ordained like the [members of the] Sanhedrin, and that he disagrees with them on a matter the volitional transgression of which [brings] excision and the inadvertent violation of which [brings] a sin-offering, and he instructs to do according to his decision or [himself] does the act according to his decision, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 17:12), \"who wantonly does\" - and not that he only instructs. But if he is a student that has not reached [the level] of pronouncing decisions, and makes a decision; he is exempt, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 17:8), \"If a matter is baffling to you\" - one who only a baffling thing is beyond him. And so [too,] if he found them outside of the Compartment of Paved Stone (in the Temple) and he rebelled against them, he is exempt, as it is stated, \"and you will arise and go up to the place\" - teaching that the place causes (is a requirement for) the death penalty.",
                "And the [law is like this], whether he disagrees about something that actually has excision for its volitional transgression (see Mishneh Torah, Laws of Rebels 4:2) or something that brings to something that has excision for its volitional transgression. How is something that has excision for its volitional transgression? For example, that they disagreed about whether a certain woman is [sexually forbidden to a man] or not; if a certain blood renders impure or does not render impure; if a certain woman is [in the category of impurity called] <i>zavah</i> or is not a <i>zavah</i>; if a certain fat is forbidden or not and all that is similar to this. And how is something that brings to something that has excision for its volitional transgression? For example, that they disagreed about the intercalation of the year which [can] bring to the eating of chamets on Pesach; and so [too,] if they disagreed about a law in the monetary laws, such that according to one, the one took money from his fellow legally, and if he married a woman with it, she is married, and one [besides her husband] who has sexual relations with her volitionally is punished with excision, and when inadvertent, liable for a sin-offering, but according to the words of the other, he is exempt, and so [too,] in every matter in which money is to be extracted, such as those obligated by expropriations or evaluations, [the disagreement being about] whether they are liable to give [money] or not liable - that which they took from them [not according to the correct law] is theft, and if he marries a woman with it, she is not married; and so [too,] anything like this. And even if they disagreed about the laws of lashes, he is liable [to be a rebellious elder] as a result of them - as behold, according to the words of the one that [holds] he is not liable for lashes in court, they are obligated to pay the value of his injury, and he would legally take his payments from them.",
                "And Rambam, may his memory be blessed, wrote about the matter of this negative commandment of \"you shall not stray\" (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Rebels 1:2) that it is one whether they are things that the Sages learned from the received tradition, or things they learned from their intellects through one of the methods through which the Torah is expounded or things done to make a fence for the Torah - and they are the decrees, the ordinances and the practices (see Rashi on Yoma 74a, s.v. ve'aliba) - in each one of these there things, it is a positive commandment to listen to them; and the one who transgresses any one of them transgresses a positive commandment and a negative commandment. And Ramban, may his memory be blessed, greatly took a hold upon him [about this] and said (in the Sefer HaMitzvot in his gloss on Shoresh 1): Behold, the rabbi holds that included in the negative commandment of \"you shall not stray\" is everything that is from the words of the Rabbis - whether it is a rabbinic commandment such as the reading of the Scroll [of Esther] or the Channukah light, or whether it is from the ordinances such as poultry meat with milk and the secondary sexual prohibitions; whether they are active positive, such as three prayers every day or a hundred blessings and lulav on [all] seven [days] in the borders (outside of the Temple), or they are negative, such as anything that is because of a rabbinic Shabbat prohibition on Shabbat and holidays, and so [too,] the second day of a holiday in the Diaspora and the [fast of the] Ninth of Av; and more generally, anything that the Talmud forbids or commands about. And behold, the rabbi builds a fortified wall around the words of the Sages, but it is 'like a spreading breach that occurs in a lofty wall, whose breaking comes sudden and swift'; as it is a rationale [that is found] wanting in many places in the Talmud. As behold, according to his opinion, one who uses what is connected to the ground on Shabbat, such as one who leans on a tree, or one who moves something from the sun to the shade or says to a gentile [to do work] and he does it or even if he takes a large step on Shabbat, he transgresses [both] a positive commandment and a negative commandment from the Torah, and he is fit to be lashed forty [lashes]. But the rabbi exempts him in the Book of Judges (Mishneh Torah, Laws of The Sanhedrin and the Penalties within their Jurisdiction 18:2), because it is given to the warning of a death penalty by the court - as the death penalty of anyone who rebels against their words is with strangulation. And behold, according to his words, he should be lashed according to the opinion in the Talmud that says that we administer lashes for a negative commandment, given to the warning of a death penalty by the court - as is mentioned in the chapter [entitled], Mi Shehichshikh (Shabbat 154b). And according to that opinion, it is fitting to be very stringent in rabbinic laws, as they are all [from the] Torah. There is no difference at all between them and between the commandments explicit in the Scripture; and there [would] be nothing in the Torah more weighty than a rabbinic Shabbat prohibition which is of their words, except that which has a liability of excision or the death penalty by the court - but not anything that has the obligation of a positive commandment or a negative commandment. As behold, according to his opinion, there is the obligation of a positive commandment and a negative commandment in all of their words - the positive commandment of \"And you shall act according to the thing that they tell you,\" and the negative commandment of \"you shall not stray.\"",
                "And behold it is seen that our Rabbis in all of the Gemara say the opposite of this. As behold, they determine all rabbinic cases leniently, as they always say (Beitzah 3b), \"A doubt of Torah [law] is to be [ruled] stringent and a doubt of rabbinic [law] is to be [ruled] lenient. And they were lenient regarding a concern of rabbinically forbidden [products being present in a certain food], to say, \"As I say\" (that we can assume that it is not present). And they said in the first chapter of Pesachim 9b, \"I will say that we say, 'As I say,' in a rabbinic [law]; in a Torah [law], can we say, 'As I say?'\" And they relied upon minors who are not fit to testify, to testify on that which is rabbinic, as they said (Pesachim 4b), \"The checking for chamets is rabbinic, and the Rabbis relied upon them in rabbinic [laws].\" And so [too,] regarding perimeters, a minor is believed to say, \"The perimeter of Shabbat is to here,\" [as they] \"held that perimeters are rabbinic, and the Rabbis were lenient in the rabbinic,\" as it is found in Eruvin 58b and in Ketuvot 28b. And they were also likewise lenient in the rabbinic with doubts, as they, may their memory be blessed, said (Berakhot 21a), \"[If] there is a doubt if he prayed or if he did not pray, he does not go back and pray; [if] there is a doubt if he said, 'True and solid' or he did not say it, he goes back\" - and they said, \"What is the reason? Prayer is rabbinic; 'True and solid' is from the Torah.\" And not only that, but they were even lenient about things that contradict each other in rabbinic [law] - as they said in the chapter [entitled] Bemeh Madlikin (Shabbat 34a), \"[If] two [people] said to him, 'Go out and make an <i>eruv</i> for us'; he made an <i>eruv</i> for one while it was still day, etc.,\" as it appears there. And it is also seen in the Gemara that we constantly uproot their words on account of a Torah prohibition; as they said in Tractate Shabbat 4a, \"If he stuck bread onto an oven [wall], they permitted him to scrape it off before he comes to a prohibition [that is punished with] stoning.\" And there in Shabbat 128b they said, \"Negating a vessel from its preparedness is rabbinic, but the pain of animals is [from] the Torah, and a positive commandment [from] the Torah comes and negates a positive commandment [from] the Rabbis,\" as it appears there. And this is [something seen] very much in the Talmud - a positive commandment [from] the Torah comes and pushes off a positive commandment [from] the Rabbis. And so [too] with a disagreement among the Sages, they said (Avodah Zarah 7a), \"If one [group] was greater in wisdom, follow it; and if not, follow the stringent [one] in that of the Torah, and the lenient in that of the [Rabbis].\" And even greater than this, they said (Eruvin 67b), \"In that of the [Rabbis,] we first do the act, and then we deliberate.\" And in the chapter [entitled], Mi Shehichshikh (Shabbat 154b), they said, \"What is it that you would say? They were also concerned with a small loss. Hence, it makes us hear\" - as it is a novelty with them when they do not push off the words of the [Rabbis], even for a small loss. And they said (Berakhot 19b) that priests can render themselves impure with rabbinic impurity to see kings of the nations of the world; so that if they merit [it], they will differentiate that [which separates] the kings of Israel, etc. And also regarding the punishments of the words of the [Rabbis], they only have excommunication, as they said (Pesachim 52), \"We excommunicate for the two days of holiday in the Diaspora.\" And they said about one who does work on Purim, \"Let the master excommunicate him.\" And in [some] places, they have lashes of rebellion, and that is for one that transgress their words that are similar to [commandments] of the Torah - and those are all the decrees that they decreed from their [own] words - that they lash him until he accepts it upon him or until his soul departs, as is explained in the Tosefta of Sanhedrin. The general rule of the matter is that the words of the [Rabbis] are different in all of their laws from the words of the Torah, that [the one tends] towards leniency, and [the other] towards stringency. But the thing that is clear and clean of any confusion is that this negative commandment of \"you shall not stray\" is only in that which they, may their memory be blessed, said in explanation of the Torah - such as things that are expounded through a <i>gezerah shavah</i> or a <i>binyan av</i> or the rest of the thirteen methods through which the Torah is expounded; or about the meaning of the language of the verse itself - and so [too] regarding that which they received as a law of Moshe from Sinai. And it is about this that they, may their memory be blessed, said that there is a positive commandment and a negative commandment in the thing. And if in this matter, one fitting to pronounce decisions disagrees with the Great Court  about that which the volitional transgression [brings] excision and the inadvertent violation [brings] a sin-offering, he becomes a rebellious elder through them - at a time when we judge capital cases. And this is [the meaning of] that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Sifrei Devarim 154), \"Even if they tell you about the left that it is right\"; meaning to say that this is the commandment upon us from the Master of the Torah, may He be blessed - that we believe the greats regarding what they say, and that the one who disagrees not say, \"How can I permit it for myself, since I know with certainty that they are mistaken?\" As even if it will be such, it is a commandment to listen to them - as I wrote above at the beginning of the commandment - and like the matter that Rabban Gamliel conducted with Rabbi Yehoshua on Yom Kippur that fell out according to [the latter's] calculation, as is mentioned in Rosh Hashanah 25a.",
                "And there is one condition about this law according to that which they, may their memory be blessed, said in Tractate Horayot 2b, that if at the time of the Sanhedrin, there was a wise man who was fitting to pronounce decisions or was part of the Sanhedrin, and the Great Court decided not like his opinion, he is not allowed to permit himself the matter that is forbidden according to his opinion, until he gives and takes (discusses) with them about the thing, and after they all - or their majority - agree to the negation of that opinion, confound his rationale against him and come to the conclusion that he is mistaken; [only] then is he allowed to act for himself according to the permissibility about that which it was his opinion to forbid - and it is also a commandment upon this one to accept their opinion regardless. But with the ordinances and the decrees that the Sages made as a protection of the Torah and as its fence, this negative commandment is only a [recommendation], and there is no law of rebellion about them at all. And the rest of the details of the commandment are elucidated at the end of Sanhedrin ([in the] chapter [entitled] HaNehenakin). ",
                "And this commandment is practiced concerning the matter of the rebellious elder at the time of the [Temple]. And concerning the matter to listen to the words of our ancient Sages and to our greats in the wisdom of the Torah and to  our judges in our generation, it is practiced in all places and at all times by males and females. And one who transgress this and 'breaches a fence' in one of all of that which our Rabbis taught us in explanation of the Torah - such as through one of the thirteen methods or something forbidden from a law of Moshe from Sinai, and like the matter that we wrote adjacently - has violated this negative commandment, besides violating the positive commandment in it. But we do not administer lashes for it, since it is given to the warning of a death penalty by the court with the law of the rebellious elder, and as we wrote. "

                "<b>To appoint a king from Israel:</b> That we were commanded to appoint upon ourselves a king from Israel, so that he can gather us all together and administer us according to his desire. And about this is it stated (Deuteronomy 17:15), \"Surely place upon yourself a king, etc.\" And in Sifrei Devarim 157, \"'Surely place upon yourself a king' is a positive commandment.\"",

And behold, you see in the books of the Prophets that it comes as  a curse when many people are the head in one place - and as it is written (see the book of Judges 9).",
                "From the laws of the commandment is that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Kings and Wars 1:3) that we do not a priori set up a king in Israel except by the word of a court of seventy elders and by the word of a prophet - like Yehoshua, as Moshe, our teacher, and his court appointed him; and like Shaul and David, as Shmuel HaRamati and his court appointed them. And [also] that which they said (in Sifrei Devarim 157), that we do not set up a woman to the monarchy, as it is stated, \"a king\" - and not a queen. And when they would set up a king, they would anoint him with anointing oil (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Kings and Wars 1:7). And once he has been appointed, he acquires the monarchy for himself and for his sons, as it is written (Deuteronomy 17:20), \"in order that he will have length of days upon his monarchy; he and his sons, among Israel.\" If he [only] left over a minor son, we preserve the monarchy for him until he grows up, as Yehoyada did for Yoash. And anyone who is precedent for the inheritance is precedent for the inheritance of the monarchy. And the big son precedes the small son. And it is not just the monarchy, but all positions of authority - in actuality or as an honorary title from the honorary titles - and all appointments in Israel are an inheritance for a man, such that his son acquires it after him, and his son's son, and his son's son's son forever. And this is when he fills the place of his fathers with the fear of Heaven. But if there is no fear of Heaven in him - even though he has great wisdom - there is no need to say that we do not appoint him to an appointment of the appointments in Israel, but it is [even] fitting to hate him and distance him.

                "And [also] that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Sanhedrin 19b), \"'Surely place upon yourself a king' - that his fear should be upon you\"; meaning to say that we fear him, trust his words in every matter that he does not command against the commandments of the Torah and that we honor him with the full honor that can be fitting for flesh and blood. And in the hand of the king is the right to kill anyone who transgresses the commandment of the king who is established according to the Torah, or rebels against any matter [pertaining to him]. And there is no angle of iniquity in this, to the point where they, may their memory be blessed, said (Shabbat 56a) that Uriah became liable for his soul (life), when he said in front of David, \"my master, Yoav\" (II Samuel 11:11) - as he should not have mentioned mastery about any other man in front of the king. And [also] that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Sanhedrin 20b) that in the hand of the king is the power to make a road in the middle of fields and vineyards, and that he may judge people according to what appears to him to be the truth - and even without clear witnesses. And [also] that which they said (Sanhedrin 22a) that we do not ride on his horse; we do not sit on his throne; we do not marry his widow; we do not use his scepter, his crown nor any vessels he uses. And all of this is for his stature and his honor. And when he dies, his vessels are burned in front of his bier. And [also] that which they said (Sanhedrin 19b) that [if] a king forgoes his honor, his honor is not foregone. And all of these things, they are all for the good of the people and for their benefit. And the laws of the king are all like they are explained in the book of I Samuel 8:11-17.

And these two negative commandments themselves are repeated for the priests, as it is stated with Aharon (Numbers 18:20), \"In their land you shall not inherit, and there will not be a portion for you among them.\" And they, may their memory be blessed, said (Sifrei Bamidbar 119), \"'In their land you shall not inherit' - at the time of the division of the land; 'and there will not be a portion for you among them' in the spoils.\" And even thought the priests were in the tribe of Levi, the prevention is repeated about them for strengthening. And so [too,] all that is similar to this in the Torah, such that it repeats negative commandments in many places - it is all to strengthen the matter or to complete the law when it is not complete from the one negative commandment.

And were the law to be [that a high priest is transgressing two commandments], he would be liable two for it - one because of [being] a priest, since a divorcee is forbidden to him, and a second from the angle of his being high priest, since she is forbidden to him in a different negative commandment. And from this type itself are the preventions that came to the priests for 'They shall not make a bald spot on their heads, and they shall not shave their beards and their flesh they shall not gash with a gash' (Leviticus 21:5); as they were already preceded for all of Israel more generally, in its stating, 'You shall not round off the corner, etc.' (Leviticus 19:27), 'and you shall not place a bald spot' (Deuteronomy 14:10), 'And a marking for a soul, you shall not put onto your flesh, etc.' (Leviticus 19:28).

But rabbinically, one is obligated also [on] anything that is human food, that is guarded and the growth of which is from the ground. And even though we found that in the Sifrei, they based the thing on a verse, it was only a memory device (<i>asmakhta</i>) - as I have written in the Order of Vayikach Korach (Sefer HaChinukh 295) with the commandment of the tithe. As there they said, \"'The first of your grain': just like grain, wine and oil are human food, its growth is from the earth and it has owners - as it is stated, 'your grain' - so too, all that is similar to them is obligated in priestly tithes and tithes.\" And they, may their memory be blessed, said (Talmud Yerushalmi Challah 4:4 and see Mishneh Torah, Laws of Heave Offerings 2:2, 5) that even though vetch is not human food, it is obligated in the priestly tithe and the tithe, since we eat them in years of famine. And rubia (some have the text, <i>tiah</i>), hyssop and thyme that are planted from the outset for man are obligated in the tithe; and so [too,] all that are similar to them.

Garden seeds - such as turnip seeds, radish seeds, onion seeds and all that are similar to them - are exempt from the priestly tithe and the tithes, since they are not human food.

And so does it appear to me is the law of tithes [as well], that we are only [rabbinically] obligated at this time - like the priestly tithe.\" To here [are his words]. And Raavad, may his memory be blessed, wrangled him about this matter and this is his language: Avraham said, \"He did not conceive the law properly - as behold, we establish it [to be] like Rabbi Yochanan - as we say in Yevamot 81a, 'The priestly tithe at this time is from Torah writ' - meaning in the Land of Israel. And it appears that he, himself, wrote this at the beginning of the book. And if there is [truth] to this matter, it is in [the laws of] <i>challah</i>.\" To here [are his words].

And nonetheless there is none in the world that disagrees that it is also practiced rabbinically in the Land of Shinaar, since it it close to the Land of Israel, and many of Israel go to and come back from there.

But a place that an individual from Israel or a family or a tribe gave glory to themselves and conquered is not called the Land of Israel - even if it is within the borders of the land that were given to our father, Avraham. And the law of the places that Yehoshua divided to the tribes - even though they were not all conquered - is like the law of the Land of Israel; so that the majority [of the Land of Israel] not be like the conquest of an individual, when each and every tribe enters its portion. [Regarding] the land that David conquered - such as Aram-Naharayim, Aram-Tsovah, the whole bank of the Euphrates up to Babylonia, Damascus, Achlav, Charan and similar to them - even though he conquered them with permission of the Great Court, they are not like the Land of Israel in every matter. Rather they left the category of outside of the Land and did not enter the category of the Land of Israel. And in every place, they are called Syria. And there are things [for which] their law is like the Land of Israel and there are some [for which] their law is like outside the Land, as you will find in the Gemara in scattered places. And the reason is because he conquered them before he conquered all of the Land of Israel. As had he seized all of the Land of Israel to its borders first and conquered [the other lands] afterwards, they would have been like the Land of Israel for everything. And regarding the priestly tithes, the tithes and the seventh [year], the Sages said that they be like the Land of Israel. But regardless, in the Land the obligation is from Torah writ at the time when Israel is there, like we said according to the opinion of Rambam, may his memory be blessed; but in those places it is rabbinic at all times. And they, may their memory be blessed, said (Chagigah 3b) that every place that Israel held when they come up from the exile of Egypt and became sanctified through them - that sanctity was nullified when they were exiled in the first [subsequent] exile, since they only sanctified it by way of conquest alone for the time. But when they came up a second time from the exile of Babylonia with Ezra the Scribe, they sanctified it a second time for the time and for the future to come - meaning to say, a sanctity that stands forever. But nonetheless, the obligation of the priestly tithes and the tithes are only from the Torah there - according to the opinion of Rambam, may his memory be blessed - when Israel is settled there, and as I wrote adjacently. And some places that they were in - where those that came from Egypt held - those that came from Babylonia the second time did not hold, [but rather] left them and did not sanctify them. And nonetheless, they did not exempt [those places] from priestly tithes and tithes, so that the poor that go up on the seventh [year] would [be able] to rely on them.",
                "It comes out that regarding the commandments dependent upon the Land, the whole entire world is divided into three divisions: the Land of Israel; Syria; and outside the Land. And the Land of Israel is divided into two parts: every place that those that came up from Babylonia held is one part; and the rest that only those that came up from Egypt held is a second part. And outside the Land  is also divided into two parts: the Lands of Egypt, Shinaar, Ammon and Moav, where priestly tithes and tithes are practiced rabbinically; and all of the other lands, where priestly tithes are not practiced at all.

And about this is it stated (Deuteronomy 18:4), \"and the first shearing of your flock shall you give him.\" And the matter of the commandment is that anyone who has a flock of five - whether they are males or females, whether they are lambs or grown sheep, and even if he has sheared them several times - is obligated to give a present from the wool to the priest each time. And there is no measure of this gift from the Torah, but Rav, Shmuel and Rabbi Yochanan said in Tractate Chullin 137b, \"The first shearing is in sixty\" - meaning to say that he gives him one portion out of sixty. And since Scripture mentioned the expression of giving about this - as it stated, \"shall you give him\" - the Sages said (Chullin 135a) that one who has many shearings and wants to distribute them to many priests, give no less than the weight of five <i>sela</i> when it is cleaned, so that it be fit to make a small garment with it. [It is] not that the Israelite would clean it and afterwards give it to him, but rather that it be fit to make so much [finished] wool after the priest has cleaned it, so that it be a useful gift. And so too did they, may their memory be blessed, say (Chullin 137b) that the obligation of this commandment is only when there be a flock of [at least] five, such that the shearing amount to sixty <i>sela</i>, and that each one be no less than twelve <i>sela</i>.",

Since they constantly serve in front of God and have no inheritance in the lands nor in the shearings, God, may He be blessed, acquired for them all the needs of their livelihood through their brothers. And behold, He gave them the priestly tithe and the tithe of the tithe, which are their bread and their wine; the gifts of the beast, which is the foreleg, the jaw and the maw and their portion in the consecrated [animals] of the Temple, such that there will be enough meat for their satisfaction. And [since what is] still lacking is shearing for their clothing, he also acquired the first of the shearing for their clothing.

And elucidated in the book of I Chronicles 24-26, is how David and Shmuel divided them, that they made twenty-four shifts of priests and twenty-four shifts of Levites, in order that each of their shifts could work two weeks a year. And in Tractate Sukkah 55b, they may their memory be blessed, said that on the festivals, the hand of everyone was equal. And about this is it stated (Deuteronomy 18:6-8), \"If a Levite would go, etc.\" - and included in the Levite is a priest, since Levi was the father to all of the tribe - \"and he will come in all the yearning of his soul.

And Moshe, our teacher, was the one that began to divide them first and he made eight shifts - four from Itamar and his party and four from Elazar and his party. So is the received tradition. And that which the verse stated, \"besides the sales, etc.\" is a negation, and not a commandment at all; meaning to say that the priests work 'in all the yearning of their souls' - whether on weekdays, whether on a festival - except if they want and agree to divide the work among themselves into shifts. And we received as a law to Moshe from Sinai that it is proper to do this, so that the work be done orderly and with alacrity.

And Rambam, may his memory be blessed, wrote (Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Lo Taase 31) that the matter of clairvoyance is the restraint of his ability and thought to [concentrate] on one of the types of movement - like all of the men of [these] abilities all do - that they should tell them what will happen before it does. And truly it becomes realized for them, in that the power of their [concentration] and their quantity from it is very strong. (The explanation of his explanation is) meaning to say that they isolate themselves in their thoughts and fix all of their concentration and all of their feeling to that matter that they want to know. And from the isolation and the strong fixing and  the elimination from their thought of all matters of the physical world, their souls mix with the spiritual [forces] that [become aware] of near futures, as is known among the wise men. But nonetheless, they never have the power - and not even in demons - to know the distant futures. And no one can arrive at this great level, except for a true prophet. And even in near futures, the clairvoyants do not fathom the whole truth, but rather [only] most of their words come true. And in this matter itself, not all of the people are the same in it. Rather there are some who have much superiority in these matters, like the superiority of people in strength and [in] other things that some have over others. And the actions of the people with [these] abilities are not [all] the same. As among them are some that isolate themselves in the deserts to focus on this, and from them one that hits the ground with a stick in his hand - blows that come quickly one after the other - and yells out strange yells and leaves his thought and looks to the ground a long time until he understands what will happen. And Rambam, may his memory be blessed, testified that he saw this once in the West. And among them, there is one who flattens the sand and makes images in it - and this is done by many people in the West. And among them [also] is one who throws small stones in a piece of leather and he stares at them for a long time. And among them [also] is one who does this craft with handfuls of barley and a grain of salt and a charcoal mixed in - and this is famous among us, [as] the Yishmaelite men and women always do it in front of our eyes. And among them [also] is one who throws down a leather belt to the ground and stares at it and speaks. And the intention of all of this is to arouse the ability of the soul that can see. And our perfect Torah distanced us from all of these matters. And about all of this was it stated (Deuteronomy 18:10), \"There shall not be found in you a clairvoyant, a soothsayer, a diviner, etc.\"  ",
                "And I have already written in the warning (negative commandment) about \"do not divine\" in the Order of Kedoshim (Sefer HaChinukh 249) what I have known about the reason for these matters. And I saw in the books of the early scholars about the reason for this prohibition, [that it is] because all of these matters mislead the masses. And because some of what the clairvoyants tell them come out to be true, they think that the constellations and powers are the cause of all actions that are in the world. And they can almost be called part of the evil group that say, \"The Lord has abandoned the land\" (Ezekiel 8:12). And because of this matter which was very famous at the time of the prophets, the prophet said, \"My people asks its wood, and its stick will speak to it\" (Hoshea 4:12).",

And one who transgresses it and makes himself a clairvoyant in one of the ways from all the matters we have mentioned or in another matter, and tells people things that he sees through his clairvoyance, is liable for lashes - and that is when he does some act in the thing, as we do not administer lashes without an act. But one who asks [something] from a clairvoyant is not under the liability of lashes. Nonetheless, very disgusting is anyone who fixes his thoughts or expends his time on these vanities. As it is not appropriate for one whom God has graced with knowledge and given the true religion as an inheritance to think about these vanities. Rather, he should fix his thoughts on the service of the Creator, may He be elevated, and not fear the words of the clairvoyant; since God, in His kindnesses will change the system of the stars, and nullify the power of the constellations, [so] as to do good to His pious ones. And it is known that we are the holy people, such that we are not under [the power of] a star or constellation - 'the Lord is our inheritance, as He spoke to us.' And [it is] like the matter that we found with the forefathers, that God placed their stature above the ministers above: Like that which is written about Yaakov, \"but rather Yisrael will be your name\" (Genesis 35:10), \"for you have dominated (<i>sarita</i>) with powers, etc.\" (Genesis 32:29); meaning that God made him a minister (<i>sar</i>) over the [celestial] ministers. And so [too,] is Yitschak called Yisrael, as it is stated (Genesis 46:8), \"these are the Children of Israel that were coming to Egypt, Yaakov and his children.\" And so [too,] Avraham is called Yisrael, as we wrote in the Introduction of the book. And this is [the meaning of] what is written about the matter of the disagreement of the prophet, Eliyahu, with the prophets of Baal, as it stated (I Kings 18:31), \"like the number of tribes of the children of Yaakov,\" whose name was called Yisrael: As he was rebuking them [about] why they were leaving the service of the Master, the Lord of Hosts, who has in His hand to nullify all the actions of the powers and the constellations; and like the matter that He did with the forefathers, such that He put the constellations under their hand. And that is [the meaning] of its stating in that place (I Kings 18:31), \"like the number of tribes of the children of Yaakov, to whom was the word of the Lord, saying, 'Yisrael will be your name,'\" - meaning to say, that He made him a minister over the [celestial] ministers, to change their system and their power with his merit. [This is] meaning to say, Israel, who are the children of Yaakov, are also ministers over the celestial ministers; and hence it would be fitting for them to not worship anything besides God alone. And so did we find with Yehoshua, who decreed to the sun and the moon to stand - as it is written in Joshua 10:12, \"Sun, be still in Giveon, moon in the Ayalon Valley\" - and they stood. And so [too,] several pious ones of Israel who changed the system of the constellations [and their power] with their merit.

And what is the content of contradiction? For example, that they testify about the testimony itself: that the first group says, \"Thing x happened,\" and the latter says, \"It did not happen,\" or it comes by implication of their words that it did not.

And [also] that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Makkot 3b) that colluding witnesses do not need warning, but rather once they are refuted, they are judged; and that witnesses that were first contradicted and, afterwards, refuted - behold these are also judged; as they, may their memory be blessed, said (Bava Kamma 3b), \"Contradiction is the beginning of refutation.\" And [also] that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Ketuvot 20a), that we only refute witnesses in front of them, but we contradict witnesses [also] not in front of them. And if they extracted money with their testimony, the court returns the money to its owner, and the witnesses pay according to the amount of money that they thought to make him lose. But with capital cases, it is not like this: As if one is killed according to them and they are refuted afterwards, they are not killed - as so does it come in the received tradition (Makkot 5a), \"[If] they did not kill, they are killed, if they killed, they are not killed.\" And there is somewhat of a reason to give about the matter: [It is] because 'God is present in the congregation of judges.' And were it not that the convicted was guilty because of his [other] evil deeds, the judicial procedure would not have been concluded against him. But rather he was fit for this [punishment], and the judgement against this evildoer was orchestrated from the Heavens. And about similar to this is it stated (Proverbs 15:4), \"even an evildoer for an evil day.\" And since the matter is clarified to our eyes that this man was to die, the Torah did not want that we should kill the witnesses over him. And the analogy about this is one that kills a <i>treifah</i> (someone who is deathly ill) is not killed over him.

And about the reward for the existence and the ability [given] since he believed in the Creator about this matter, they, may their memory be blessed, said in the Midrash (Devarim Rabbah 80:5 on Ki Tetzeh) that a person merits children as a reward for this commandment, which is to say that his existence will continue - as children are the existence of a person and his memory.

But mercy for Him is from His simple desire - that His wisdom loves to have mercy, because it is a good trait, and all good traits are found with Him. And they said [that] in His commanding us about this, it was not by force of the trait of mercy that He commanded us in the thing; as behold, He permitted their slaughter, since all the species are created for the needs of man.

And if He had wanted the opposite of this, nothing would force Him [to do otherwise] and no cause would prevent Him, God forbid. [This is,] as opposed to us, who are built with the power of [our] natures, [such] that the trait of mercy impedes us from destroying, or sometimes forces us to do good.

And this is [what was meant by] \"to refine them with them\" - that they should be like refined silver. As the action of the one who refines silver is not without explanation, but [rather] to remove all the dross. So too are the commandments to remove from him any bad belief and to inform him of the truth and to always remind him. And the language of the <i>aggadah</i> itself in Yilamdenu in the section, 'This is the animal ' (Midrash Tanchuma, Shmini 8) is \"And for what would the Holy One, blessed be He, care if one  slaughters a beast and eats or stabs [it] and eats? Does it help Him or hurt Him at all?  Or what would He care whether one would eat pure foods or eat carcasses? 'And if you have been wise, you have been wise for yourself.' Behold, the commandments were only given to refine the creatures with them, as it states (Psalms 12:7), 'The words of the Lord are pure words'; 'The word of the Lord is refined' (Psalms 18:31). Why? So that it will a shield for you.\"",
                "Behold, it is shown by this that they are coming to say that there is no benefit to Him, may He be blessed, in the commandments - by way of illustration, that He would need the light that He commanded to light the candelabra (the menorah in the Temple) or that He would need the food of the sacrifices and the smell of the incense, as it would appear from their simple understandings. And even [regarding] the memory of His wonders that He commanded that we do [various acts] in commemoration of the exodus from Egypt and the creation story, the benefit is only that we know the truth and merit from it, such that we be fitting that they be a shield for us. As our honoring [Him] and saying over His praises are considered as nothing and void for Him. And he brought a proof from \"the one who slaughters from the [front of the] neck and from the back,\" to say that all of them are for us and not for the Holy One, blessed be He. As it is not likely to say about slaughter that there be a benefit and honor to the Creator, may He be blessed, from the neck more than from the back or from stabbing. But rather they are for us; to guide us in the paths of mercy even at the time of slaughter. And he brought another proof - \"or what would He care whether one would eat pure foods\" - and these are permitted foods - \"or eat impure foods\" - and these are forbidden foods, about which the Torah stated (Leviticus 11:26), \"they are impure to you\": They are only for you to be of clean souls, wise and understanding of the truth. And they said, \"And if you have been wise, you have been wise for yourself.\" They mentioned [the two examples], since the active commandments such as the slaughter [from] the neck are to teach us good traits; and the commandments and decrees regarding the species [that are permitted] are to purify our souls, as the Torah stated (Leviticus 20:25), \"and do not make your souls disgusting with the beast and the fowl and with all that crawls on the earth, which I have separated for you to be impure.\" If so, they are all for our benefit only. And it is as Elihou said (Job 35:6), \"If you sin, what do you do to Him? If your transgressions are many, how do you affect Him?\"; and (Job 35:7), \"What does He receive from your hand?\" And this matter is agreed to in all the words of our Rabbis.",
                "And they asked in Yerushalmi Nedarim 9:1 if we can open [an avenue of regret for a vow] with the honor of the Omnipresent in matters that are between him and the Omnipresent. And they answered this question [as follows], \"What is the honor of the Omnipresent [that is offended]? For example, a sukkah that [a man] does not make, a lulav that he does not hold, tefillin that he does not don? And that is [what is] understood by the honor of the Omnipresent? It is for [the person] himself that it helps, like that (Job 35:7), 'If you are righteous, what do you give Him; what does He receive from your hand?' [and] (Job 35:6) 'If you sin, what do you do to Him? If your transgressions are many, how do you affect Him?'\"",
                "Behold, they elucidated that even the lulav and the sukkah and tefillin - that He commanded that they be \"a sign upon your arm and a commemoration between your eyes [...] that the Lord took you out of Egypt with a strong hand\" (Exodus 13:9) - are not for the honor of God, may He be blessed, but [rather] to have mercy on our souls. And they already set this into the prayer of Yom Kippur, \"You have separated man from the start and recognized him to stand in front of You, as who will say to You what to do, and if he is righteous, what will he give to You?\" And so [too], it stated in the Torah (Deuteronomy 10:13), \"for your good\"; and so [too] (Deuteronomy 6:24), \"And He commanded us to do all of these statutes [...], for our good all of the days.\" And the intention in all of them is that it be good for us and not for Him, may He blessed and elevated. But all that we are commanded is [so that] our souls be refined and purified without the dross of evil thoughts and disgusting character traits. And so that which they said (Berakhot 33a), \"[It is because] he makes the traits of the Holy One, blessed be He into mercy and they are only decrees,\" is to say that God did not worry about the nest of the bird and His 'mercy did not reach' it and its child; as His mercy does not extend to creatures with an animal soul, to prevent us from doing what we need to them. As were it so, slaughtering would be forbidden. But [rather], the reason for the proscription is to teach us the trait of mercy and that we not become cruel. Since cruelty spreads in the soul of a man, as it is known with butchers that slaughter large oxen and donkeys, that they are 'people of blood,' 'slaughterers of men' [and] very cruel. And because of this they said (Kiddushin 82a), \"The best of butchers are the partners of Amalek.\" And behold, these commandments with animals and birds are not mercy upon them, but [rather] decrees upon us, to guide us and to teach us the good character traits. To here are the interpretations of Ramban, may his memory be blessed.",

And if, however, there are from the commandments that we did not [fully] grasp their explanation due to the smallness of our intellect - because of their great depth and ultimate greatness - we should not prevent ourselves from saying about them all that we have grasped to find the benefit that there is for man in his doing them. And this is my path in all of my speech in this book - that there is a benefit for us found in the commandments; but there is not [benefit] for the One who commands them.

[... And] Rav Yehudah ... said, '[If] he found a nest in the sea, [he is] obligated in sending away,'\" as it is included in the expression, 'on the path,' \"as it states (Isaiah 43:16), 'So said the Lord, who makes a path in the sea.'\" And (Chullin 12:3) \"[If] it was flying - [... if] its wings do not touch the nest, one is exempt from sending. [... If] there were [...] damaged eggs, one is exempt from sending, as it states (Deuteronomy 22:6), '[...] young birds or the eggs' - just as young birds are viable, so too [the] eggs [must be] viable [to fall under the law...]. If one sent her away and she returned,  [...] - even [several] times - one is obligated [to send her away again], as it states (Deuteronomy 22:7),' You shall surely send.'\" And the rest of the details of the commandment are elucidated in the last chapter of Chullin.

And if the mother died before he sends her away or another person sent her away, he has no remedy to fulfill the positive commandment and to remedy the negative commandment. But if he sent her away before she dies, [the violation of] its negative commandment is rectified; as this negative commandment is rectified by the positive [one], and [it is] as we have written (Sefer HaChinukh 544) about the negative commandment that comes on this, with God's help."

As God created His world and built it upon the foundations of the principles of nature and decreed that fire should burn and that water puts out the flame. And so too, nature requires that that if a large stone falls on the head of a man, that it will smash his brain; or that if a person falls from the top of a high roof to the ground, that he will die.

Are all of the stumbling blocks that come out from at it after the end of its ripening not enough for us?

And because of this, they also said that one who suspends the grapevine of his fellow over the produce of his fellow, did not set aside any one of them. And for this reason, one who plants his vineyard on the seventh year did not set it aside, since in the seventh year the land is ownerless to everyone (see Mishneh Torah, Diverse Species 5:8). And they, may their memory be blessed, said (Mishnah Kilayim 5:5) that one who plants vegetables or produce in a vineyard or leaves it until it increased one two-hundredth, behold, he has set aside (forbidden) from the grapevines surrounding it sixteen ells in every direction.

And five vines is called a vineyard; and this is when they are planted in this order: Two across from two and one sticking out as a tail.

And I say that from the explanations of this commandment is the matter of [causing] pain to animals, which is a prohibition of the Torah. And it is known that for species of animals and fowl, there is great anguish in dwelling with those that are not its species and - all the more so - to do work with them. And [it is] as we see with our eyes with the ones that are not under our hands (undomesticated species) that every bird dwells with its species; and all animals and other species also always cling to their [own] species. And any wise-hearted person will [learn] proper conduct from this, to never put together two people whose natures are different from one another and different in their behavior in any matter - like a righteous person and an evildoer [or] a slight person and an honorable one. Since if the Torah was exacting about the pain that there is to animals - that are not intelligent creatures - from this, all the more so [is this the case] with people that have an intelligent soul, in order to know their Maker.",
                "From the laws of the commandment is that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (see Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Lo Taase 218 and Mishneh Torah, Diverse Species 9:7) that the obligation of this commandment from Torah writ is only with two species like the ox and the donkey - that one of them is pure and the second one impure, [such] that their natures are very distant from one another. But with two species that are [both] pure or impure - like an ox and a goat, or a donkey and horse - it is not forbidden from the Torah. Rather it is [only] rabbinically that any two species that would [constitute a case of] forbidden inter-breeding are forbidden - and both [domesticated] beasts and [undomesticated] animals are included in the prohibition. And it is the same whether one plows with them or seeds or pulls a wagon with them. And so [too,] if one [person] was sitting in the wagon and one was leading [them] - both of them are lashed, because his sitting in the wagon [also] causes the animal to pull (see Mishneh Torah, Diverse Species 9:9). And even if a hundred [people] led together, all of them are lashed. And [about] that which they said that it is permissible to do all work with a person and an animal, as it states, \"with an ox and a donkey\" - and not with a person and a donkey or a person and an ox (see Mishneh Torah, Diverse Species 9:10) - the explanation of the matter is according to the root that we mentioned. As the joining of an animal is not distressing for a person, since there is no connection with it at all. And behold, it is like he is doing work with a tree or a stone; and [so] it does not at all come into the designation that we spoke about. And also from the matter of the commandment is that which Rabbi Yitschak said at the end of Makkot 22a, that one who leads an ox of those disqualified from the consecrated is lashed - even though it is one body, the verse made it like two bodies to be lashed for. And the rest of its details are explained in the eighth chapter of Kilayim (see Tur, Yoreh Deah 297).",
                "And this prohibition is practiced in every place and at all times by males and females. And one who transgresses this and seeds or plows or pulls or leads with a forbidden mixture - which are two species, one impure and one pure - is liable for lashes from Torah writ. And he is liable for lashes even if he led them together with his voice alone - like the way of animals that sometimes walk with the coaxing of people, as it is stated, \"together\" - in any case. They, may their memory be blessed, made a precise inference from the words of the verse to obligate lashes [even] with speech without a deed. And in [the case of] two species that were [both] impure or pure, that are forbidden to inter-breeding with each other, he is rabbinically liable for lashes of rebellion. "

And he wrote further that this matter is still known with the priests that are in Egypt. ",

[This] is to say that the wool is <i>shua</i> by itself, meaning to say, beaten, and <i>tavui</i> (spun) by itself and  <i>noz</i> by itself - and the explanation of   <i>noz</i> is woven (see Rashi on Niddah 61b and Rabbenu Tam in Tosafot on Niddah 61b) - and so [too] is the flax <i>shua, tavui</i> and <i>noz</i>, by itself; and afterwards he combined them together - for example, he wove them, or even if he tied them one to another, once he tied two knots, this is <i>shaatnez</i> from Torah writ, for which there is lashing. But the whole time that these three [processes] that we have written are not done to them, it is not <i>shaatnez</i> from Torah writ, but [only] rabbinically, according to the opinion of some commentators, and we do not administer lashes for it. But it is forbidden rabbinically if one of the [processes] that we have mentioned - either <i>shua</i> or <i>tavui</i> or <i>noz</i> - is done to them. And this is what they, may their memory be blessed, said (Mishnah Kilayim 9:9), \"the ones alone are forbidden\" - meaning to say, rabbinically.

And they, may their memory be blessed, said this matter when the forbidden mixture underneath is soft, as then is there this concern of wrapping (see Mishneh Torah, Diverse Species 5:12-13). And this prohibition is rabbinic, as from Torah writ it is permissible, even when they are soft. And [it is] as they, may their memory be blessed, said, \"'It shall not come upon you' (Leviticus 19:19) - but you can set it under you\" (see Mishneh Torah, Diverse Species 10:12-13). And in Yerushalmi Kilayim 9:1, they said [that] pillows and comforters - even though they are hard - with full ones, it is forbidden to sit upon them rabbinically, since they double over on the one that is sitting upon them; but with empty ones ([this is what is written] in the Yerushalmi, [though there appears to be an error here in the Sefer HaChinukh, wherein it is written], the soft ones), since there is no concern that they will go on top, it is permissible to sit upon them, since (if) they are hard.  And the explanation of the matter is [that it is] because the verse forbids <i>shaatnez</i> with an expression of wearing, meaning to say in the way of wearing is it forbidden and not in another way. And for this reason our teacher, God protect him, permitted us to put hats that are made from felt on our head to guard against the sun, since they are also very hard. And therefore, even though they have a forbidden mixture in them, they permitted them - as it is not the way of wearing something so hard. And there is one who wants to be stringent upon himself with this, and they did not protest against him. And for this reason - that it is the way of wearing that the Torah forbade - they also permitted the sellers of cloth to sell according to their way (to put the cloth on top of themselves) but only when they do not have any intention at all to warm up from it. And nonetheless, the modest and good wholesalers extend clothes from forbidden mixtures on a stick behind them so that they not touch them. And they, may their memory be blessed, said that there is no measurement to forbidden mixtures - that even one string in a large garment forbids all of it until he removes it (see Mishneh Torah, Diverse Species 10:5). <i>Kelech</i> - which is a type of wool and it grows on stones in the Dead Sea - is forbidden with flax rabbinically, because of the appearance [of sin] (<i>marait ayin</i>).

And about this is it stated (Deuteronomy 22:13), \"If a man takes a woman and has sexual relations with her,\" which is to say [that] if a man wants to take (marry) a woman for himself, he should acquire her first with sexual relations.

And it is also said, that it is so that she will always put it into her mind that that she is acquired by that man and that she not be unfaithful to him and not rebel against him, and [that] she give him honor and glory like a servant to his master.

However we do not betroth with less than the value of a small coin - as so did they, may their memory be blessed, say (Kiddushin 3a), \"Since she does not transfer herself for less than this,\" which means to say that she does not consider such a small act to be anything. And [this is the case] even though she is acquired by a contract - [as] even though it does not have the value of a small coin, it is an important act in her eyes; as so [too] are most acquisitions in the world preformed with a contract. And for this reason, an act of exchange (<i>chalifin</i>) does not acquire her; as an exchange is with a vessel, even though it does not have the value of a small coin.",

And he says to her, \"Behold, you are betrothed to me with this money or with this monetary value,\" or \"Behold, you are engaged to me,\" or \"Behold, you are a wife to me.\" And all of Israel is already accustomed to saying, \"Behold, you are betrothed to me with this thing like the law of Moshe and Israel.\" And he gives it to her in front of witnesses.

But if he has in mind that she will be tied to him and he will be [held] responsible for the obligation of [her] sustenance, clothing and appointed times, all of his days; and that even if he gets sick of her, he will never have the option of divorcing her; and that he he will have to give to her father fifty silver [shekel-coins] immediately - he will truly suppress his [evil] impulse and prevent himself from doing this villainy that comes with such a penalty. And there is also in this a little comfort for this poor embarrassed woman in that she will stay with him forever, lest another man would embarrass her with this evil thing that happened to her.

And the Sages said (Ketuvot 39b) that if a raped woman does not want - or her father does not want [for her] - to marry him, we do not force her [to do so]. But if [the rapist] does not want, we force him [to marry her] - even if she is lame or blind or has <i>tsaraat</i> (a skin disease) - and he may not put her out (divorce her) ever. And this [woman] does not have a wedding contract (<i>ketuvah</i>). As what is the reason that the sages established the marriage contract? It was in order that it not be light in the eyes of the husband to divorce her - and he cannot divorce this one. If the woman raped was forbidden to him [to marry] - even if it is from a positive obligation, and even if it is a secondary prohibition, behold this one does not marry her.

And in the fourth chapter of Ketuvot 46b it appears to be the opposite, that in the entire Torah (including rape) there is no difference whether it is according to her [customary] way or not according to her way regarding lashes and [other] punishments, except for only the one who puts out a bad name. And there is no obligation for the fine until she is a full three years old; but from three full years to when she matures, there is a fine for her. And she is called an adult (mature woman) after six months from [when] the lower sign appears, which is two [pubic] hairs, and during those six months, she is called a maiden (see Mishneh Torah, Marriage 2:2). And this is what they, of blessed memory, said (Ketuvot 39a), \"The difference between maidenhood and maturity is only six months.\" And after she matures (see Mishneh Torah, Virgin Maiden 1:8), there is no fine for her, as it states, \"a virgin maiden\" - and the explanation that came for it is (Ketuvot 38a), \"a virgin\" and not one who has had sexual relations; \"maiden,\" and not an adult, or a child bride (<i>memaenet</i>) or a barren woman (<i>aylonit</i>). And the matter of the signs of an <i>aylonit</i> are known. And anyone who has not seen the lower sign and is thirty-five years old and a day - even though she does not have the signs of an <i>aylonit</i> - is assumed to be an <i>aylonit</i>. And whether she has a father or she does not have a father, there is a fine for her.

And all other girls have a fine for them. And anyone that has a fine, has [payment for] embarrassment and damage [in the case when] she is seduced. But if she is raped - even if she doesn't have a fine - she has [payment for] embarrassment, as it is not [any] less than one who injures his fellow [and] who is obligated [to pay] for five things (one of them being embarrassment).

And about this is it stated (Deuteronomy 23:18), \"No daughter of Israel shall be a prostitute.\" And Rambam, may his memory be blessed, wrote (Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Lo Taase 355) and this is his language: \"The negative commandment about this matter has already been duplicated with a different language in the verse (Leviticus 19:29), 'Do not desecrate your daughter to make her a harlot' - and the [following is the] language of Sifrei Kedoshim 7:3, '\"Do not desecrate your daughter\" - this is one who gives over his single daughter not for the sake of marriage and also [a woman] who gives herself over not for the sake of marriage.' And hear from me for what [reason] this negative commandment of strong language was duplicated, and for what was it added to (see Mishneh Torah, Virgin Maiden 2:17): That which He already made precede from His laws that one who has sexual relations with a virgin - whether it be a seduction or a rape - is not obligated any one of the punishments, except only to [give] money and to marry the woman with which he had sexual relations, as it is explained in the verse, would let it come into our thoughts that since this thing only requires the payment of money, that this law goes according to the procedure of financial law. And [if so, just] like a person has the right to give whatever of his money to his fellow and he leaves it to him to do his will with that which is [now] his; so too has [the father] the right to take the maiden with him and to give her to a man to have sexual relations with her, since that is his law that is fitting to him - meaning to say the fifty shekel-coins of silver that go the father of the maiden. And this [father] will also give her on condition that he takes from him such and such dinar-coins. And he is prevented from this [thought] and it is told to him, 'Do not desecrate your daughter to make her a harlot.' Since that which is My law with her to only take money, however, is only when there is an incident when a man seduces or rapes [her]; but when the matter is with the consent of both of them together and it is public, there is no permissibility to this at all from any angle. And He showed the explanation for this and stated (Leviticus 19:29), 'lest the land fall into harlotry and the land be filled with depravity.' [This is] since the existence of seduction and rape is limited, but when the matter would be by choice and consent, it would spread and fill the land. And this reason is very nice and it enhances the verse. And similar to this is all that which the Sages have mentioned and all that they agreed upon regarding the Torah laws.\" To here is his language, may he be blessed. And Ramban, may his memory be blessed, wrangled with him about this (in his critique of Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Lo Taase 355) and said that this negative commandment of the prostitute is not coming to warn one having sexual relations without a wedding contract and betrothal, as the wedding contract is neither a commandment nor a form of acquiring a woman, at all, according to the Torah. But [rather] the main negative commandment [here] is coming to warn not to have sexual relations with a woman that is forbidden [in marriage] to the man having sexual relations in such a way that betrothal would not be effective for him with her. As they, may their memory be blessed, elucidated in the Gemara (Yevamot 61a), that the harlot (<i>zonah</i>) that is mentioned in every place in the Torah is none other than a woman who an Israelite has sexual relations with, when betrothal would not be effective for him with her. And this is the harlotry that the Torah distanced and loathed forever and [here] it warned the [man] and the [woman] about it. And so too from the foundation of this matter is that the verse warns the court that they should not let a woman be abandoned among them, since her end will be to have sexual relations with men that she is forbidden to [in marriage], to the point that betrothal is not effective for them with her. As there is no doubt that a woman abandoned to the many will not be exacting afterwards 'between a piece of permissible fat and a piece of forbidden fat.' And so too does it warn the father of the girl about this explicitly in another verse; that he should not abandon her to harlotry and not to give her over to one who cannot have betrothal with her. And about this is it stated, \"Do not desecrate your daughter to make her a harlot.\" And it is all from the reason mentioned - since she will have sexual relations with one who she is forbidden to [in marriage]; not from the reason of marriage contract and betrothal, as is the opinion of Rambam, may his memory be blessed.",

And because of this, is it stated in this language: \"No [daughter of Israel] shall be, etc.\" Since had the verse stated, \"There shall not be among you a male prostitute or a female prostitute,\" slaves would have been included in the category of the prohibition; since they are also obligated in the commandments, except for those places where they are excluded - when Israel is explicitly specified, as with stealing a soul, wherein it is written there, \"from his brother, from the Children of Israel.\" And so too, here, where it states, \"from the daughters of Israel\" and \"from the sons of Israel\" - it is implied that the warning is to Israel alone; not to the slaves.

But according to Ramban, may his memory be blessed, a single man and a single woman who have sexual relations are not liable, except if she is sexually forbidden to him, to the extent that betrothal is not effective for him with her, as we have explained.

And if one gives her a sanctified animal as a gift, it does not become forbidden, as the consecration already preceded and took possession of it. And what is the price of a dog?

As with what he obligated himself to, and it is in his hand to fulfill - [something] that has these two [elements]; for example, charity - he is immediately liable for 'do not delay.' But with gleanings, forgotten sheaves, and corner fields, he did not obligate himself to [do] them. And [with] sacrifices, in which he did obligate himself to [do] them, it is not in his hand to sacrifice them immediately - and therefore, he does not transgress for them until after three pilgrim holidays. Merit, my son, and you will examine their words. And the rest of the details of the commandment - meaning to say the exact clarification, meaning to say to warn a person to do what he is obligated to do, and how he can save himself from this when a doubt comes into what he said - it is all elucidated in places in Shevuot, in Nedarim, and at the end of Menachot and so too, in Kinnim.",
                "And this commandment is practiced in every place and at all times, by males and females. And one who transgresses it and does not fulfill his word, with vows to the Elevated realm - for example, sacrifices and vows for the upkeep of the [Temple] during the time of the Temple - immediately when it is possible for him to fulfill it, and as we wrote in the Order of Reeh Anochi (Sefer HaChinukh 438), negated this positive commandment. And when three pilgrim holidays have passed by him and he has [still] not fulfilled his word, he has transgressed the negative commandment of 'do  not delay,' and [it is] as we will write in this Order with God's help (Sefer HaChinukh 574). And in our day, one who vows charity and does not pay it to the beadles or the poor - if there are some there - on the day that he vows it, he has negated this positive commandment and also transgressed 'do not delay,' immediately - according to the opinion of a few commentators. And if he delays doing the thing for three pilgrim holidays, he has transgressed, 'do not delay,' according to the words of everyone.",

And about this does it state (Deuteronomy 23:25), \"When you enter your neighbor’s vineyard, etc.\" And the [traditional] explanation [that] came about it (Bava Metzia 87b) is that the verse is speaking about a wage-worker. And so [too] did Onkelos translate, \"When a wage-worker.\" And so is it likewise written, \"When you enter your neighbor’s field of standing grain, etc.\" And they, may their memory be blessed, explained in the chapter [entitled] Hasokher et Hapoel (Bava Metzia 88b), that we learned from these two verses that a person eats that which is connected at the time of the production's completion. And they elucidated there that it would be insufficient to learn that which we need [to learn] from one of the verses without the other. ",

And it is true that fastidiousness towards the worker, that he should not eat that upon which he is toiling, while he is still toiling - and all the more so, if  they are involved with that which grows from the ground, about which a person is joyful with the blessing of God that He has given him - is an indication of villainy and a very bad temperament. And I have already written several times that the curse and evils will cling to the evil and that good things will cling to the good - 'a specie with its specie.'",
                "From the laws of the commandment is what they, may their memory be blessed, said (Bava Metzia 87a), what is the difference between someone involved in what is detached and someone who is involved with what is attached: That the one involved with what is detached eats until he finishes his work, and once he finishes his work, it is forbidden for him to eat. But the one who is involved with what is attached - for example harvesting and reaping - only eats when he has finished his work. For example, the harvester and the reaper, would eat after they have filled the basket (see Mishneh Torah, Hiring 12:2). This is the law of the Torah, but the Sages said [that] because of returning a lost object to the owner - meaning to say, that they not idle form work - that they should eat while walking form one row to another and in their returning [from the vat]. And one who idles during the time of work, and eats, transgresses a negative commandment. And about this is it stated, \"you must not put a sickle to your neighbor’s grain,\" as we will write in this Order adjacently in its negative commandments with God's help (Sefer HaChinukh 577). And also that which they said about this matter (Bava Metzia 89a), that one who milks and one who churns and one makes cheese, and all that is similar to it does not eat, because [milk products] are not things that grow from the ground; [and] one who thins out onions or garlic - even though he detaches small ones from among the big ones - does not eat, because this is not the end of production; and it is not necessary to say that guardians of gardens and orchards and all that is attached to the ground do not eat at all. And [also] that which they said (Bava Metzia 89a) that the worker does not eat from something, the production of which is completed concerning tithing and challah-tithing. One who harvests and one who threshes and one who winnows and one who separates and one who reaps olives or grapes and one who crushes and all that is similar to these [types of] work eat from Torah writ. And the guardians of threshing floors and mounds and anything that is detached from the ground, the production of which has not been completed regarding tithes, eat from the laws of [what is practiced] in the state, but not from Torah writ, since a guardian does not do an act (see Mishneh Torah, Hiring 12:8-9). And with someone who does an act, there is no difference between when he does it with his hand or his foot or even with his shoulder - all of them eat from Torah writ. If he was involved with figs, he cannot eat grapes, as it states, \"in your neighbors' vineyard, and you may eat grapes\" - meaning to say, and not something else. And one involved in this grapevine should not eat grapes of a different vine. And it is forbidden for the worker to suck the grapes, as it states, \"and you may eat [grapes]\" - and not sucking. And he should not eat a gluttonous eating, as it states, \"and you shall be satisfied\" - but not more. And the rest of the details of the commandment are elucidated in the chapter [entitled] Hasokher Hapoalim in Bava Metzia. ",

Therefore, it was from the kindnesses of God, may He be blessed, to increase the warnings about it, in that which stumbling is common.

And about this writing the verse states, \"a book of cutting\" - and it is what our rabbis, may their memory be blessed, called a bill (<i>get</i>); and so too the Translator, translated it as a book of <i>get</i> (Onkelos Deuteronomy 24:1). And about this does it state  (Deuteronomy 24:1), \"and he writes her a book of cutting, gives it to her, and sends her away from his house.\"",
                "It is from the roots of the commandment [that] since woman was created to help man and she is like a beloved vessel for him - and like the matter that they, may their memory be blessed, said (Sanhedrin 22b), \"A woman only makes a covenant with the one who makes her into a vessel\" - since that is the case, it was from His will, blessed be He, that anytime his soul be sick of this vessel, that he should put her out of his house. And for this reason, there are some of our Rabbis that say in the gemara (Gittin 90a) that he can divorce her even if she burnt his cooked food - meaning to say, even for a small thing - since she is only like a valuable vessel in the home. And there are some of them that say that since this vessel is in His image and His likeness, and God granted to her - for his need and his honor - eyes to see, ears to hear and an intelligent soul, it is only fit for him to put her out and send her away from him for a large claim, and as the matter that is stated in the verse, \"because he finds something lewd about her.\" However, according to everyone, if he finds a big thing, it is fit for him to divorce her for the reason that I mentioned - since she was only created for his sake. And since she is a bitter spirit for him and his soul despises her, he is under no compulsion to be with her in any case (as do some of the nations, who make a covenant with a woman [that is] a strong covenant until [one of them reaches] the grave below; and [so] she does not fear separation if she is licentious in his eyes and destroys everything in the house and burns everything that he has with fire - from the heaps to the standing grain to the olive grove). Nonetheless, the Torah commanded us that when we send her away, that he not send her away with speech alone, lest this be a stumbling block for us and it become a snare - that there be licentiousness among our nation, such that the adulterer claim that her husband divorced her; and also that divorce be very prevalent. Accordingly,  now that we have been obligated to write the words in a book and to have witnesses testify, any [woman] that claims to be divorced, must show a deed [to that effect]. And there is also [another] benefit in the matter - as through this, sometimes the man will calm down and regret from [wanting to] divorce her. And 'great is peace.'",
                "From the laws of the commandment is that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Kiddushin 41a) [about] this <i>get</i> that we mentioned, [that] the man must give it into the hand of the woman or into the hand of her messenger (agent); since the messenger of a person is [considered to be] like him. And [also] that he can give it into her courtyard, and she is divorced with that. And that is if she is standing in the midst of her domain, as the <i>get</i> is disadvantageous to her; and we have someone incur a disadvantage only in their presence. And that which they also said (see Mishneh Torah, Divorce 2:1-2) that that which it states in the Torah, \"and he writes her a book of cutting\" - the intention is not that he writes it with his hand. Rather it is one, whether he writes with his hand or he tells another to write and give it to her. And it is one whether he gives it into her hand or he says to another to give it to her. It is only written, \"he writes,\" to let us know that she is only divorced by writing. And it is only written, \"he gives,\" to say that she not take it on her own. And one who says to two [others], \"Write a <i>get</i> and sign it and give it to my wife,\" behold these can write and sign and give [it] to her - and behold, they are his messengers and they themselves are the witnesses. And it is impossible for there to be a giving of a <i>get</i> without witnesses; as it states, 'according to the mouth of two witnesses shall the matter stand.' And it is impossible for her to be a sexual prohibition today - [such] that one who has sexual relations with her is [subject to] death by the court - and tomorrow be permissible, without witnesses. And therefore they, may their memory be blessed, said that if he gave her a <i>get</i> between himself and herself - and even with one witness - it is not a <i>get</i> at all. And to what do these words apply? To the script of a scribe. But if the husband wrote it in his own script and one witness signed it, behold, this is an invalid <i>get</i>. And further ahead, we will elucidate what the difference is between an invalid <i>get</i> and one which is not a <i>get</i> at all.   ",
                "And there are ten things (see Mishneh Torah, Divorce 1:1) that are called the fundamentals of divorce from the Torah, and these are they: 1) that a man can only divorce from his [own] will - and among them is the one who is coerced by Israelites until he says, \"I want\"; 2) that the divorce should be in writing and in nothing else; 3) that the matter of that which is written be that he is divorcing her and removing her from his acquisition; 4) that its matter should be something that cuts (separates) between him and her; 5) that it be written for that purpose; 6) that the <i>get</i> not lack another  action after its writing, besides its giving; 7) that he gives it to her; 8) that he gives it to her in front of witnesses; 9) that he give it to her for the institution of divorce; 10) that the husband or his messenger be the one giving it to her. And all of these are elucidated in the meaning of the verses. And the rest of the things with a <i>get</i> - for example, the signing of the witnesses, and similar to it - are all from the words of the scribes.

And even though this is not included in this commandment and its subject, the word, <i>get</i> that we have spoken about is a general word for all contracts, and [so] this is included in the word. Before anything, I will say that it is fitting for all proper witnesses to investigate and to understand the essence of the things to which they will testify, whatever the matter may be; and that they inform the involved parties to inform them of all the stipulations between them in a clear language, and to review all of the things in front of them until they comprehend them well. And [they should not act] like the foolish witnesses, who strip people of their cloaks and their possessions and their properties 'by the tail of their cloaks.' [The parties] whisper a little into the ears of the silly masses and, before they inform them [properly - such] that they understand the essence of the stipulations - they go and write and sign according to what is good in their eyes about them, until they [strip] them clean of their possessions. And the Lord, our God, did not give us, the holy people, this [way] to do anything that is not the way of truth. And therefore the prohibition against deceptions is repeated in the Torah three times, as it is written in three places (Leviticus 19:33, 25:14, 17), \"a man shall not wrong his people.\"",

And [it is] like the matter that they, may their memory be blessed, said in Ketuvot 97a in the chapter [entitled] Almanah Nizunet, [that] if one sold and [subsequently] did not need the [liquid cash], the sale goes back; and that is [in the case] when he revealed his thought, that it was because he needed the money to do such and such with it that he made the sale.

Rava said [about this], 'Anyone who goes up has the intention of settling, and he did not settle'\" - which is to say [that] the sale goes back. Behold, their opinion was to say that all actions should be concluded according to the truth and the intentions of the doers. And this is a straight path that a person should choose for himself and [so] be successful in all of his deeds.",
                "The customary text among us for contracts of sales, of gifts, of behests and of giving over rights is this: We, the undersigned witnesses, know clear testimony that x the son of y told us, \"Be witnesses for me and acquire [this testimony] from me and give it to Rabbi b the son of c, that it be a proof and a benefit for him, because I have taken and received from his hand such and such money and sold him for it, x vineyard (or field or house), as is indicated and marked off by its indications and its borders, and these are the borders of that place: on side x, such, and on side y, etc.\" - until he marks it off from its four sides. \"Everything that is within these borders have I, x, sold with a complete sale and acquisition, from now, for the money mentioned, etc.\" And afterwards, he specifically mentions [the various] aspects of that place - for example, trees, stones, beams, walls, roofs. And all of this is for the embellishment of the contract. And he needs to mention its height and depth (Bava Batra 63a). And so [too] have they become accustomed now to write on loan contracts, \"On condition that the seventh year not remove it.\" As, if not, the seventh year would remove it; since we hold that the removal of money [debts on the seventh year] is practiced outside the land  rabbinically, as I have written above (Sefer HaChinukh 477).",
                "And they, may their memory be blessed, also said (Bava Batra 167a) about this matter of contracts that a person should not write the sum of three to ten at the end of a line, lest [the one holding it] forge it and write thirty instead of three or forty instead of four or fifty instead of five (which in Hebrew only requires the addition of more letters at the end of the word), etc. And if it came out at the end of a line, we go back [and write it again] two or three times, and [then] it is possible that it will come out in the middle of the line. And they likewise said (Bava Batra 165b) that if 'one hundred' is written  at the top, and 'two hundred' at the bottom - or the opposite - that it always goes according to [what is written at] the bottom. And they likewise said (Bava Batra 167b) that we write a contract for the seller or the borrower, even if the purchaser or the creditor is not with him. But we only write contracts for sharecropping or contractual work or arbitration - or any act of court - with the knowledge of them, both. And Rabbi Yitschak bar Yosef said in the chapter [entitled] Get Pashut (Bava Batra 161b) that a person must write down the existence of all erasures, entirely. And he also needs to review the subject of the contract on the last line, since we do not learn from the last line (and the review is not essential). And because of that, if the witnesses spaced their signatures one [extra blank] line below the writing, [the contract is still] fit. And that which they have become accustomed to writing 'everything is firm and valid' (Tosafot on Bava Batra 162a:1, s.v. <i>lefi</i>) is because the expression does not invalidate a contract and - even if we did learn from it - there  is nothing [harmful] in this. And Rava said there (Bava Batra 163a) that a contract wherein he and his witnesses [write] on top of the erasure is fit. And Rav Shisha, the son of Rav Eedee said in the chapter [entitled] HaZahav (Bava Metzia 47a) that we write in the contracts, \"And I acquired from him, with a vessel with which it is fitting to acquire.\" \"With a vessel\" is to exclude that of Rav Sheshet, who said that we can acquire with cows; \"which it is fitting\" is to exclude that of Shmuel, who said that we can acquire with a dung vessel (<i>maroka</i>); \"to acquire\" is to exclude that of Levi, who said with the vessels of the one who is making the acquisition - and Rav, and [perhaps] Rav Ashi said that that \"which it is fitting\" is to exclude that from which it is forbidden to derive benefit.

And God, in His kindnesses, commanded us to train ourselves in the traits of mercy and kindness, and that we should bring the required portion to every creature in his time of need, in order that we merit and receive His goodness - as He is One who desires to do good, as I have written many times.",

And what is its time? A day wage-worker collects the whole night; and about this is it stated, (Leviticus 19:13), \"the wages of a laborer shall not remain with you until morning.\" And a night wage-worker collects the whole day; and about this is it stated, \"You must pay him his wages on the same day.\" And a day hourly wage-worker collects the whole day and a night hourly wage-worker collects the whole night. A monthly wage-worker, a weekly wage-worker, a yearly wage-worker, a seven-year wage worker - [if] he leaves during the day, he is paid [that] whole day, [and if] he leaves during the night, he is paid [that] whole night. And [also among its laws] is that which they said (see Mishneh Torah, Hiring 11:3) that contractual work is like wage-work concerning this commandment - that once he has finished the work and returned it to its owners, [the employer] is obligated to give [the worker] his wage on that day. But if he did not return the work to its owners, [the employer] does not transgress [by delaying payment]. And it is like the matter that they, may their memory be blessed, said (Bava Metzia 112a), \"One who gives his cloak to a craftsman - when he has finished it and informed him, even after ten days - the whole time that it is in the hand of the craftsman, he does not transgress.\" And also what they said (see Mishneh Torah, Hiring 11:4) that the employer does not transgress unless the wage-worker makes a claim against him; but if he does not make a claim or if [the employer] does not have anything with which to pay him, [the employer] does not transgress; as the verse only obligated him when he has it in his house or he can pay him [otherwise] - but if he is not able to pay him on the same day unless he loses much of his [property], the verse did not apparently obligate him to do so.

And about this is it stated (Deuteronomy 24:16), \"Parents shall not be put to death for children, nor children be put to death for parents\" - and concerning this came the traditional understanding (Sanhedrin 27b) [that it means that] fathers should not be put to death from the testimony of the sons, and sons should not be put to death from the testimony of the fathers. And the same is true of financial cases - that we do not believe some relatives about some relatives. However it is mentioned regarding laws [involving] death sentences by way of hyperbole - that we should not say, since this is [causing] the loss of life, we should not suspect the relative about him, but rather do like his testimony; since his testimony is to lose the life of his relative. And even though the verse only mentioned the fathers and the sons, the same is true of several of the other relatives. But it mentioned sons and fathers by way of an example; saying that [even though] one loves the other very much, and [yet the Torah] stated that also these are not believed that one should condemn the other and - there is no need to say - exonerate [him]. And the same is true of some of the [other] relatives, as the tradition about them has come to us - and we shall mention them in the laws of the commandment, with God's help. ",

And to strengthen the matter, He distanced us from all the testimony of relatives - even to condemn; lest the habit spread with this to accept him also to exonerate. And this matter is from the ways of the perfect Torah to always distance us from snares and things that are close [to them]; that damage be found from them to people. And there is another benefit found from the matter [and that is that] since relatives always dwell one near the other, their dwelling and being together [makes it] impossible for them to be saved from sometimes quarreling, one with the other. And if we would believe their testimony - one against the other - perhaps in their constant anger [of] one against the other, their anger would momentarily rise and they would come in front of the court and condemn their heads to the king.

But with the other relatives from the mother, and so [too] the relatives from the side of marriage, their disqualification is [only] rabbinic. And this reasoning is taught in the last mishnah in the chapter [entitled] Zeh Borer (Mishnah Sanhedrin 3:4), which is all the extant law, according to the opinion of a few commentators. But from [the commentators], there are [other] great ones - sages and wise ones - that decided [that] even all of the sibling relatives from the mother, and so [too] his brother-in-law and step-son and all that are not fit to inherit, are [all] disqualified from Torah writ, [just] like the [corresponding] relative on the father's side - as they learned [to include] them in the Gemara, from the inclusion of the verse, [based on its mentioning the word,] fathers, fathers twice.

And the children of the brothers with each other are called the second with the second; and the sons of the sons of the brothers are called the third with the third. And it is established for us that a third with a first is [a] proper [witness], and, all the more so, a third with a second - and it is not necessary to say that a third with a third is proper. But a second with a second is disqualified - and it is not necessary to say that a second with a first is disqualified. And according to this, the father is disqualified with his son and with his son's son; but he is proper with the son of his son's son - as he is a third with a first. But there are a few commentators (Rashbam on Bava Batra 128a:18), the opinion of which is to say that that all those that come from the 'thigh' of  a person are disqualified for him. And the brother with his sister are likewise called a first with a first, like with brothers. And in the same way that we count with males, the first generation and the second and the third, so [too] is it counted with the females (see Mishneh Torah, Testimony 13:6).",

And so too, we say that anyone who is disqualified to testify about the husband is likewise disqualified from testifying about his wife; as the husband is like his wife, and the wife is like her husband. And we say 'a husband is like his wife' once, but we do not say 'a husband is like his wife' twice [over]. For example (as a result), the son-in-law of his brother-in-law (the brother of his wife's sister) is proper to testify for him, as it is his brother-in-law who is disqualified to him because of his wife's sister - who is a sexual prohibition for him. But the son-in-law of his brother-in-law is not disqualified to him, because he is married to the daughter of the sister of his wife, who is disqualified to him - since 'a husband is like his wife' about this matter is not said twice [over]. But any time that both of the women are sexual prohibitions to him, we do say 'a husband is like his wife' twice [over]. For example, two men that are married to two sisters are disqualified from each other, as both of them [together] are sexual prohibitions for both of them; and so [too], the husband of his step-daughter, as both are sexually forbidden to him; as behold, they are 'a woman and her daughter,' and so [too] anything similar to this.

And a man and his wife are a first with a first. Therefore a husband cannot testify for her son and not for the wife of her son, and not for her daughter and not for the husband of her daughter and not for the wife of her brother. And regarding this matter, when he is engaged to his wife, she herself is disqualified, but her relatives are not, until he marries her. And, as a general rule, our teachers, may God protect them, taught us concerning the matter of testimony that anyone who knows testimony for his fellow and was originally proper - meaning to say he was not disqualified to him - and became disqualified to him in between, and then returned to being proper - for example, that he became distant - is proper to testify for him. [This is the case] even though he became disqualified in between. But if he was disqualified originally - even though he became proper in the end - he is disqualified.

And [regarding] one who was estimated for lashes, and when they began to lash him, he broke down and defecated or urinated, we do not lash him any more, as it states (Deuteronomy 25:3), \"and your brother be degraded before your eyes\" - from when he is degraded, he is exempted. If the strap split before they finished lashing him - even after the first strike - he is exempted. [If] they tied him to the column and he took off the strings with his strength and ran away, he is exempt. Anyone who has sinned and is lashed goes back to being [considered] proper, as it states, \"and your brother be degraded\" - once he is degraded, he is your brother. And even [about] all those obligated in excision that received lashes, they, may their memory be blessed, said (Makkot 23a) that [they are] exempted from their excisions. And the rest of the details of the commandment are explained in Tractate Makkot [in the third chapter].",

But concerning the prohibition of not increasing the lashes, that matter is only practiced at the time of the settlement of the land [of Israel], when we had a court that was fit to give lashes. And one who transgresses this (see Mishneh Torah, The Sanhedrin and the Penalties within their Jurisdiction 16:12), and flogged an Israelite a great flogging, such that he is obligated for it the payment of a small coin (<i>perutah</i>) or more - is not liable for lashes, since it is a negative commandment that is given to repayment.

                "It is from the roots of the commandment [that it is] since the woman that a man marries, behold, she is like one of his limbs - as so does nature necessitate because of the story of the first father, as one of his ribs was taken and from it did God build woman -  and since this man died with no sons, that there should be a portion from him for his memory and to fill his place in the world in the service of his Creator. And also there is no memory of him in the physical world besides this woman, who is the bone of his bones and the flesh of his flesh. And [so] it was from the kindnesses of God to him to establish seed from her for him, through his brother - who is also like half of his flesh - in order that this seed take his place and serve his Creator in his stead, and so that he merit through him in the world of souls, where he is. As it is known that a son gives merit to the father; as so did they, may their memory be blessed, say (Sanhedrin 104a), \"A child gives merit to a father, a father does not give merit to a child.\" And truthfully likewise does the living brother that fathered the children from the levirate wife also get a share in them for himself, and he also gets merit in their merit. Nonetheless, not all of the merit will go to him; but rather his brother will take his portion because of the big portion that he has in them - and that is the wife that fell to his portion first, as we have said.",
                "And according to that which we mentioned, when the verse states (Genesis 38:9), \"But Onan, knowing that the seed would not be his,\" its sense [in terms] of the simple meaning is to say that not all of the merit of the seed would be his, as his brother would take a part in it; and he was not [interested] in partial merit. And also because maybe the main merit is to the dead brother, since he is like the owner of the field and the living brother is like a sharecropper - and like the well-known matter about sharecroppers, that there are some that provide their own seed. And this is what they, may their memory be blessed, said (Yevamot 22b) that any time that his brother has any memory in the world - a son or a daughter or grandchildren from another woman, and even an illegitimate son (<i>mamzer</i>) or daughter - that they exempt his wife from levirate marriage; [such] that it appears from this that the matter is only to memorialize his name and to give him a portion and merit in this physical world (see Guide for the Perplexed 3:49). And behold, with my knowing that there is a major principle and a correct explanation about this commandment with the Kabbalists, I will rely upon what I wrote at the beginning of my book. And there I penned my apology, that I do not silence myself from writing my thoughts about the simple understanding of the explanations of the commandments, in order to stimulate the spirit of the children to ask questions about them to their elders and their teachers. By [their] dealing with them, perhaps, a merit will come through me in the revelation of the truth of their matters, and I will merit with them in my place.",

And [also] that which they said (Yevamot 17b and see Mishneh Torah, Levirate Marriage and Release 1:7) that regarding the matter of levirate marriage and release and inheritance, only brothers [born of] the father are considered brothers; even though regarding the issue of mourning and the issue of testimony, even brothers [born of] the mother are called brothers. And [also] that which they said (Yevamot 43b and see Mishneh Torah, Levirate Marriage and Release 9:12) that [if] one has many wives and dies but does not leave a child from any of them, one of the brothers has levirate marriage with, or releases, one of [the wives] and they all become permissible [to marry]. And he is not able to have levirate marriage with two - not he and not one of his brothers; as it states, \"who will not build up his brother’s house\" - and the [traditional] explanation that comes about this  is (Yevamot 44a) \"One house shall he build\" - meaning to say, [it is only for] one brother, and he does not build two houses. And also if he does this, he transgresses the positive commandment, as it states, \"he shall have intercourse with her\" - and the Sages, may their memory be blessed, expounded, \"And not with her and with her rival wife.\" ",

And, so too, they can only release one [wife]; and once she is released, she and all of her rival wives become forbidden to the releaser and to all of the other brothers, by the words of the scribes (rabbinically) - like secondary relations. But there are certainly no Torah prohibitions on them - once his brother died without children, the prohibition on his wives departed. Hence, betrothal is effective, as it is with secondary relations. And [in the case of] one who releases his levirate wife, just like she is forbidden to him, so too are her relatives forbidden to him - and we have mentioned the relatives [concerned] in the Order of Achrei Mot. And, likewise, she is forbidden to his son and to his brother. The general principle of the matter is that, behold, she is like his wife that he divorced. And, so, if the levirate wife died before the levirate marriage [or] release; behold, her law regarding her relatives is that she is like his wife that died [in his lifetime].

And [about] that which they said that she should not be released during this time, they learned that thing from an inference in the Gemara (Yevamot 41b). And they, may their memory be blessed, said about this matter (Yevamot 35b) that if the first brother leaves his wife pregnant and she has a miscarriage after he dies, behold, she must perform levirate marriage or be released. But if she gave birth and the newborn came out alive, she is exempt from the levirate marriage and from the release. And even if the newborn died immediately [is she exempted] by the law of the Torah.

And to what do these words apply? When he had the intention of having intercourse. But if he did not have the intention of having intercourse, he did not acquire [her in marriage]. And from the words of the scribes (Yevamot 52a) is it that the levirate husband should not have intercourse with his levirate wife until he has betrothed her in front of witnesses - and this is what is called, <i>'maamar'</i> in the Gemara.

And these are them: the wife of a eunuch of the sun (caused by nature) or of an <i>andrigonos</i>; the wife of someone mentally incapacitated; the wife of a minor; a sterile woman; and one who is sexually forbidden to the levirate husband. As it is stated, \"that his name may not be blotted out in Israel\" - to exclude a eunuch of the sun and an <i>andrigonos</i>, the names of which are [already] blotted out; since they are not capable of having children from the beginning of their creation, they are like their own species. And it states, \"The first son that she bears shall be\" - to exclude a sterile woman, who is not capable of having children from the beginning of her creation. \"The wife of the deceased shall not be married to a stranger, outside the family\" - to exclude the wife of someone mentally incapacitated or a minor, that do not have marriage at all. \"He shall take her as his wife\" - to exclude one who is sexually forbidden to the levirate husband, that do not have taking (marriage) for him to them. And the sages counted (Mishnah Yevamot 1:1) fifteen women that do not have taking, that exempt their rival wives from release and from levirate marriage.

And because he does not want to do what is incumbent upon him - to establish a name for his brother - she goes out from under his hand and spits in front of him; to make known that she is completely separated from him and not subjugated to him any  longer, [such] that she should give him honor in any matter.

And that which they also inferred (Yevamot 17b), \"'Brothers together' - that are together in inheritance, to exclude brothers [born only] from the mother,\" who are not obligated in levirate marriage and release. \"'And has no (<i>ein</i>) son' - look into (<i>ayen</i>) him\" (Yevamot 22b). [This is] meaning to say that if the brother did have a son or daughter from any place, or the son of a son or the son of a daughter or the daughter of a daughter or any one that came out from his 'thigh' - there is no commandment of levirate marriage or release there, for the reason that we mentioned concerning the commandment of levirate marriage.

                "And this is the order of the release (<i>chalitsah</i>) as we have learned it from our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, in the Gemara (Chapter 12 of Yevamot - Mitzvat Chalitsah) - and so is it practiced today: Three men are chosen that know how to read what they are obligated to read to the levirate husband and the levirate wife - and they are called judges. And they add to them [two] others with them, so that there be five to publicize the matter - or [even] up to ten (Yevamot 101b); and such is the practice of the people. And the five judges are careful (Yevamot 104a) that they not be related to each other or to the levirate husband or the levirate wife. And [then] they say to each other, \"Let us go to place x, and set a place for the release of y\" - since so did Rava say (Yevamot 101b), \"The judges have to set a place.\" And they [all] go there and the judges sit and the levirate husband and the levirate wife stand - as if in judgement, wherein the judges are sitting and the litigants are standing. And there is no impediment in this - such that if they did it [with the levirate husband and the levirate wife] sitting, the release is not disqualified by this. And afterwards, the judges ask the levirate husband if he is thirteen years and a day old and has produced two [pubic] hairs, and they also find out clearly that the woman being released is the wife of the dead brother of this releaser - as Rava said (Yevamot 106a), \"We do not release if we do not recognize.\" And when they know all of this with certainty and the matter is clear to them, they also ask the woman if she ate that day. And if she ate, we do not release on that day, [as] we are concerned lest she ate things that bring her to spitting; and we need the spitting to be from her - as Rava said (Yevamot 106b), \"[If] she ate garlic and spit, [or] if she ate a clod of dirt and spit, it is nothing; 'and she spits' - we need it to be from her and [this] is not.\" Nonetheless, this thing does not impede [it], and if they released her in this way, their release is fit, ex post facto - as behold, the spitting being from her does not impede [it].",

And he should be careful that it all be stitched with leather (Yevamot 102b), and that it not be exceedingly large, but rather medium - so that he can walk with it - and also not too small, but rather it should at least cover the majority of his foot. And, from the outset, he should release [her] with his shoe and it [should be] the right shoe; however, ex post facto, this does not impede [it]. And there should be two straps of leather or of hair sewn into the shoe (Yevamot 107b), and they should be big enough to wrap it around his foot. And he should put the shoe on his right foot; and he [should be otherwise] barefoot and not with stockings, so that it not 'upon that which is \"upon.\"' And if he released [her] with the left foot, his release is disqualified (Yevamot 104a). And he should be careful that the shoe not be so tall that it goes over his knee - as this is also 'upon that which is \"upon.\"' But [if it is] below the knee, it is certainly not 'upon that which is \"upon.\"' And afterwards, he ties the straps around his foot, and he ties two knots. And the levirate husband stands next to the wall or next to a post and presses his foot onto the ground - as Amimar says, \"That one that releases needs to press his foot\" (Yevamot 103a). ",
                "And afterwards (Yevamot 106b), the court has the levirate wife recite in the holy tongue [the relevant passage] from, \"My levirate husband refuses\" until \"he does not want to perform levirate marriage with me.\" And she should be careful not to pause between \"does not\" [and] \"want,\" but rather read these two words at one time without a pause, so that it does not sound like \"want[s] to perform levirate marriage with me.\" And they have the levirate husband recite, \"I do not want to marry her.”",

But in Yerushalmi Yevamot 12:1, they said that she needs to remove [it] with the right hand. Hence, the [woman] should concern herself [about this] and, from the outset, remove [it] with the right. And if she has no hands, she should remove it with her teeth, [even] from the outset, and as it is explained in the Gemara (Yevamot 105a).",

[It is] such that if he is tall and she is a midget and the wind caught it [upwards], we call this \"in his face\"; but if she is tall and he is a midget and the wind caught it [upwards], it does not help at all - as we need that it 'reaches in front of the face.'

And x the daughter of y came down in front of us, the widow of z, and she brought close in front of us a man, whose name was b the son of c. And so did she say to us, 'This b, the son of c, the brother - [born] from the father - of z the son of c, who married me and died and left our rabbis and all of Israel alive, but he did not leave a son or daughter that would inherit and would be related and bring out his name in Israel. And this b, his brother, is fitting to perform levirate marriage with me. And now, our rabbis, my judges, say to him, \"If you want to perform levirate marriage with me, perform [it].\" And, if not, let him extend his right foot in front of you, and I will untie the shoe from upon his foot and spit in his face.' And we have ascertained it, that this b is the brother of z, [born] from the father, and we said to him, 'If you want to perform levirate marriage with her, perform [it] - and, if not, extend your right foot to her in front of me, and she will untie your shoe from upon your foot and spit in your face.' And he answered and said, 'I do not want to perform levirate marriage with her.' Immediately, I had this x recite, 'My levirate husband refuses to establish a name in Israel for his brother; he does not want to perform levirate marriage with me.' And also [with] this b, I had him recite, 'I do not want to marry her.' And he extended his right foot and she untied his shoe from upon his foot and spat in his face - spit that was visible to us from her mouth to the ground. And again, I made this x recite, 'Thus shall be done to the man who will not build up his brother’s house!' And again I had her recite, 'And he shall go in Israel by the name of the family of the unshoed one.'
