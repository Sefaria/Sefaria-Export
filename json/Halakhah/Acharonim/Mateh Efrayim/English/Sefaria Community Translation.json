                "<b>The practices of the month of Elul, Selichos, and the eve of Rosh Hashana</b> 1. From Rosh Chodesh Elul and on are days of mercy, and forgiveness, and days of desire. So, there is to each person to awaken their heart with repentance, and to act to absolve the sins that are on their soul from the day he became. In order he be vindicated in his verdict as the King sits on the Throne of Judgment on the day the world was born.  It appears to me my countrymen that it be good to organize the practices of these holy days to find a respite for the masses from the harried people of our nation, as they do not console from the agitation of the days and the hassles of their hearts and eyes. The Torah is closed in learning from the old sources and the changing times, and their hearts are buzzing with the arrival of the sanctity of these days. They remember that it is a time for G-d, and their souls thirst to run in the upright way and path. Yet since there is not to them fitting time to search and delve the ways except within the more expansive books. And the masses say - who can show us the shorter path, \"He shall lead me in the righteous path\" (Psalms 23:3), in order to understand the difference between holy and empty, the way of the King he shall go, not to point to the right or left. And because of this matter, I have seized with my right hand on support of the reed and end of the staff that is in my hand, to guide them in a clear way, to direct them in the pleasant path, to go in holiness, from the day of blasting (of the shofar) on Rosh Chodesh until the end of the 40 days, when one blows (the shofar) at the time of the closing of the gates (Neilah Services on Yom Kippur). I have ordered the matters according to order of the Shulchan Aruch. And I have not inscribed with longevity and I have not delved in the differing opinions in law; rather, quickly I have run the words in a language that is clear and concise on the roots of the laws I have traced. And in the merit of the masses I have leaned and I have been strengthened. I beseech and requested I be assured they not be returned empty, to lift the stumbling block from the path of G-d, and that G-d give support to me to merit and to enable the merit of his brothers, his nation, and heart of the masses shall turn to the Staff of Ephraim.

                "2. There are people of action who are accustomed to fast forty days opposite the 40 days that Moshe Rabbeinu, peace be upon him, went up to receive the Torah. And accordingly that there are Shabbosim, and (days of) Rosh Chodesh, and Rosh Hashana that they do not fast, therefore they are accustomed to start after the 15th of Av (Tu B'av), that will complete the count of 40. And even if within the days there are many fasts, as an example one who is used to fasting BeHaB (Monday, Thursday, Monday), or the eve of Rosh Chodesh, or for a Yahrzeit, or a Dream Fast, or there is a decree of a Communal Fast, since that nonetheless they fasted on them, they count towards the calculation of 40 (days). There are those that start after the 17th of Tammuz (Shiva  Asar B'Tammuz), and they fast what is needed to complete. And the days they fast without being in this (i.e. like Tisha B'av where the fast isn't related to the 40 day count) do not get included in the calculation. However from Rosh Chodesh Elul and on, they count to the calculation even if they are fasting days regardless, since they are holy days. There is to go after the intention of the vower. And those fasts that they fast to count to 40 days, it is not necessary to complete them, because the fasts are only due to repentance. One who fasts does not to accept the fast everyday by itself, rather he is able to accept one time when he starts for example Shiva Asar B'Tammuz or Tu B'av. If one accepts on himself to these fasts, even if he does not say in the way of a vow, only accepting the fast alone, he needs to fast separately, and cannot use three straight days of fasting (which would count towards more than 3 fasts). And even one who is obligated because of sins..."
