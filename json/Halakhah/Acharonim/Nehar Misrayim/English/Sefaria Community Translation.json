            "(1) In Egypt the custom is that when the groom and bride wrap themselves [with a ṭallith], at the time they enter the ḥuppah (i.e. wedding canopy), the groom does not bless on this wrapping [of the ṭallith]. However, when one is a sandak (i.e. the individual that holds the child during the circumcision ceremony), the sandak wraps himself [in the ṭallit] and makes a blessing [before doing so]. And this is the opinion of the Ginat Veradim Orach Chaim Klal 1 Siman 25. (Minhagey Misraim HaRishon). Indeed, the opinion of the Ginat Veradim is a singular opinion, and all the authorities differed with him.[See] the Rabbi [who wrote] Shiyurei Kenesset Ha'Gedolah, chapter 8, Hagahot Beit Yosef number 5. [And see] the Rabbi [who wrote] Hilchot Ketanot volume 1 chapter 22. [As well as] the Rabbi [who wrote] Sha'ar Ephraim, Orach Chaim section, chapter 19. [Along with] the Rabbi [Refael Meyuhas who wrote] P'ri Adamah, of blessed memory. And he presents in his fruits (i.e. his book) a number of cases where great rabbis in the land of Israel blessed [on the ṭallith] without any protest [from other rabbis]. And our mighty genius Rabbi Ḥida (Chaim Joseph David Azulai) and Rabbi Kisei Eliyahu, of blessed memory. All of them are masters [worthy of] attention and blessing.  Moreover, in what differs the commandment of the sandak who wraps himself in a talit and pronounces the blessing from the commandment of [the groom at] a wedding who does not pronounce the blessing? Thus wondered [the authors of] Yad Aharon [Aharon Alfandari] and Pri ha-Adama [Refael Meyuhas]. And now I have recently seen some wise and G-d fearing individuals of our community here in Egypt may God protect her [Egypt] who have done something good and beautiful and clear of all controversy and this is that the Bridegroom is offered a new ṭallith which he will not wear except in the time of the seven blessings (of the wedding). And before the wedding the new ṭallith is brought to him and he blesses sheheḥiyanu while wrapping and standing in it while walking four cubits; and afterward it is also draped  over the bride's head. And this is the way in which I have instructed them. And as I wrote in Nehar Piqod which I composed about the customs of the community of Jerusalem. This nice custom brings about two benefits. The first is that he blesses sheheḥiyanu over the ṭallith and exempts the blessing of sheheḥiyanu which befits to also be under the ḥuppah which is the first commandment of be fruitful and multiply. However one is not supposed to bless upon it according to the reasons mentioned in the words of the posqim. And since he blesses over the ṭallith and intends it for the commandment of the ḥuppah and marriage, he has done his duty in them as well. And the second benefit is that he wraps himself and stands in it in a space of four cubits. This is known to the whole world, even the Ginat Veradim acknowledges this and would bless it properly. A wise man should listen and increase his wisdom to hold on to the coattails of this nice custom. And he will shake off all doubts. Because this is the upright way. And look up in Har Peqod in Beth'Hei Ṣithṣith which deals with this matter in length and you will find much satisfaction.",
            "...(2)  It is a widespread custom in Egypt, that one wraps himself in a ṭallith gedolah (the ṭallith worn in synagogue) even among common people, even young men who have not wedded a woman. Unlike the custom in Ashkenazic Jewry where the custom is that when one has not wedded a woman he does not wrap himself in a ṭallith gedolah, even if he is a Torah scholar (talmid ḥakham). And unlike the custom in the west where common people wrap themselves in a ṭallith gedolah only if they are Torah scholars who are officiating with the Torah [scroll]. And there is no haughtiness/arrogance in Egypt for wearing it (a ṭallith gedolah).",
            "...(3) In the matter of the windings of the ṣiṣith. Our teacher, Rabbi Ya'akov Castro of blessed memory, wrote that the custom in Egypt is to wind 26 windings with four spaces, corresponding to the numerical value of the Tetragrammaton (see Sect. 11 in his book). And Rabbi Kisei Eliyahu wrote that he saw that the custom was to wind 39 windings with four spaces like the number of the 39 lights, they can be seen there. And we did not know what was new about what our Rabbi [had seen]; for isn't it written in section 39 by Maran [Yosef Caro] in [Shulhan Arukh] section 11 article 14. And it would seem that there is a mistake in the words of Maran, as the symbolic  39 windings separated by 4 spaces are arranged like this: in the first space there are 7 windings, in the second 8 windings, in the third 11 windings and in the fourth 13 windings, as the symbolism is [derived from the initials of the sentence] \"Zeman Hayenu Yaarikh Yiggadel\" (may the time of our life be long and great), adding up to 39. And it is the same in the kavvanot (meditations) of the Arizal, as it is written in the Beer Hetev. And according to the order of our Rabbi [Yosef Caro] 7, 9, 11, 13 with the name of the Eternal [being eḥad, 1] that would bring it to 41 and not 40. And our custom [in Egypt] is to make the ṭallith gedolah with 39 windings and the ṭallith qatan (the small ṭallith, a ṭallith worn under the clothes) with 26 windings so that a God-fearing person can satisfy both views, and this is what Rabbi Kisei Eliyahu wrote. And in Egypt this is the custom of many of those that fear God and contemplate His name, so as to satisfy the opinion of our Rabbi the Arizal with the ṭallith gedolah, and the opinion of Rabbi Ya'akov Castro, Rabbi Solomon Luria and Rabbi Shelomo Molkho (?) of blessed memory, with the ṭallith qatan. Let the wise man hear and add to his learning.",
            "...(4) In Egypt the vast majority of the common people drape all four ṣiṣioth to their front and the tallit is folded round their neck. And it is appropriate to inform them that at least at the time of wrapping one should say the blessing and wrap one's head and most of one's body in it and stand up [for as long as it would take to walk] four cubits and afterwards drape it over one's shoulder. But if from the beginning of the blessing he lays it folded on his shoulder, then it is a blessing said in vain as there is no \"wrapping\" and also the commandment of ṣiṣith has not been performed. And the common people are satisfied with kissing the ṣithṣith twice or three times and with that they think they make up to the ṣithṣith for not having treated it properly. They should be reproached and made to repent of their error to prevent them from falling into the prohibited act of saying a blessing in vain.",
            "...(5)  In Egypt, where all the launderers are Gentile women, one would do well to be careful that she should not launder the ṭallith qatan, as warned by R. Ya'akov Castro in article 21. And generally the tallit qatan is spoiled in this way because the laundry women boil them with white bedding and the threads of the ṣithṣith, which are woollen, shrink and generally break under their hand, because the gentile laundry women did not know what they were. And happy is he who manages his ways well."
