One who is fearful should subjugate his yetzer (inclination) and not provoke any dispute or hostility, on the contrary, one should seek shalom. And one should go in shalom and pray mincha of Erev Shabbat Kodesh properly, for this is the time of revelation of the lights of Shabbat Kodesh in heaven above!"

And it is known that it was his will that [people] rejoice on this day - as is known from the story of our teacher, the Rabbi Avraham HaLevi (Amigo), may his memory be blessed for life in the world to come, and from other stories that we have heard. And we know them from the mouths of holy rabbis. And there is one who is accustomed to engaging in study on the night of the thirty third of the Omer with ten [men] to teach the praises of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochat that are scattered in the Zohar and the Idra Zuta; and that is a nice custom.
