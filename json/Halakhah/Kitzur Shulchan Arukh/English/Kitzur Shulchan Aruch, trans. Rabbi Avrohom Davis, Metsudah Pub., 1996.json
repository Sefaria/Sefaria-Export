            "\"I have set Hashem before me always.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Psalms</i> 16:8.</i> This is a fundamental rule of the Torah and of the attributes of the righteous who walk before God. For we cannot compare a person's lifestyle, his activities and affairs when he is alone, to his lifestyle, and activities and affairs when he is before a great king. Similarly, his conversation and speech when he is amongst family or relatives, [cannot be compared] to what they would be in the presence of a king, because then he would certainly take special care that all his activities and conversations be refined and correct. How much more so when you contemplate that Hashem, the greatest of kings, the Holy One, blessed is He, Whose glory fills the entire world, stands above you and views your actions, as it is said: \"If a person will hide in hidden places will I not see him? Says the word of Hashem, Do I not fill the heavens and the earth!\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Jeremiah</i> 23:24.</i> [Bearing this in mind] it is certain that you will immediately acquire a feeling of reverence and submissiveness for the awesomeness of Hashem, Blessed be He, and be ashamed [to sin] before Him.",
            "Also, while lying in bed you should realize before Whom you lay and as soon as you awaken you should remember the kindnesses of Hashem, Blessed be His Name, that were granted to you; that He returned your soul to you. You committed it to Him faint and weary and it was returned to you new and refreshed, enabling you to worship Hashem, Blessed be His Name, with all of your capacity and serve Him the entire day; because this is the essence of Man, as it is said in Scripture: \"They are new every morning how great is Your faithfulness.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Lamentations</i> 3:23.</i> This verse teaches that every morning a person becomes a new creation, and he should give thanks with all his heart to Hashem, Blessed be His Name, for this (good fortune). While still in bed you should recite: I give thanks to You, living and everlasting King for You have restored my soul with mercy. Great is Your faithfulness. (Even though your hands are not yet clean, you may say this, since the name of Hashem is not mentioned.) You should pause slightly between the word <i>chemlah</i> \"with mercy,\" and the word, <i>rabbah</i> \"great.\"",
            "Yehudah son of Taima says: \"Be bold as a leopard, light as an eagle, swift as a deer and strong as a lion to do the will of your Father in heaven.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Avos</i> 5:20.</i> \"Bold as a leopard\" means, you should not be ashamed before people who mock you for worshipping Hashem, Blessed be His Name. \"Light as an eagle\" refers to what the eye sees. This alludes to the requirement to be swift to close your eyes to prevent the seeing of evil because the sight of evil constitutes the beginning of sin. The eye sees and the heart desires and the organs capable of action culminate the sin. \"Swift as a deer\" refers to the legs, for your legs should run to do good things. \"Strong as a lion\" is a reference to the heart, because true valor in serving the Creator, Blessed is He, emanates from the heart. He also states: \"Strengthen your heart to serve Him, and overpower your evil inclination and defeat it as a hero triumphs over his enemy, defeating him, and casting him to the earth.\"",
            "Therefore, it is imperative for a person to be strong as a lion. Immediately upon awakening (and reciting the <i>Modeh Ani</i> prayer) you should rise with alacrity for the service of the Creator, Blessed and Elevated is He, before you are over-whelmed by your evil impulse with various excuses not to rise, and be outsmarted and seduced in the winter [with this argument]: \"How can you rise now so early in the morning when the weather is so cold?\" Or, in the summer it will argue: \"How can you rise from your bed while you are still not satisfied with enough sleep?\" or other similar claims. The evil impulse knows very well the art of entrapping a person with all kinds of snares to prevent him from rising. Therefore every sensitive person who fears and trembles before the word of Hashem must triumph over the evil impulse and not listen to it, even if it is extremely difficult because of physical considerations or laziness. Your aim must be to fulfill the will of the King of kings, the Holy One, Blessed be He. You should realize that if you were called by any individual to participate in a business transaction in which there is profit, or to collect a debt, or if someone called with a plan to save your wealth from disaster, for example, if a fire occurred in the city or something similar occurred, you certainly would be quick to awaken immediately because of your concern for your wealth and you would not act sluggishly. Similarly, if you would need to go to the service of the king you would rise with alacrity and not be sluggish lest you be denigrated. [Or you would rise with alacrity] in order to find favor in the eyes of the king. How much more so should this apply for the service of the King of kings, the Holy One, Blessed is He, that you should be concerned to rise quickly and with alacrity. Once you accustom yourself to this practice four or five times you will no longer find it difficult, [as our Sages have said:] \"He who makes an effort to purify himself is [Divinely] assisted in his efforts.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Maseches Yoma</i> 38b.</i>",

A lesson in <i>Mishnah</i> is preferable to any other study, (and by so doing you will be worthy of [your] <i>neshamah</i> [soul] [as inferred from the word] <i>Mishnah</i> which has the same letters as <i>neshamah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span>נְשָׁמֶה</span> - <span>מִשְׁנֶה</span></i> If you are not capable of this [studying <i>Mishnah</i>], you should recite Psalms and <i>Ma'amados</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Various selections of Scripture and other sources.</i> and study works of ethics. A little learning or recitation with concentration is better than a great deal without concentration. Rabbi Chiyah taught: \"Whoever studies Torah at night the Divine Presence is before him, as it is said: \"Rise, cry out in the night at the peak of the night watches. Pour out your heart like water before the Presence of Hashem.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Lamentations</i> 2:19.</i> This verse signifies that the Divine Presence is before us at that time. It was also said by our Sages, of blessed memory: \"Whoever studies Torah at night is called a servant of Hashem, as it is written: [Behold, Bless Hashem] all [you] <i>servants</i> of Hashem who stand in the House of Hashem, during the <i>nights</i>.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Psalms</i> 134:1.</i> During the short nights when it is difficult to rise so early, you should at least endeavor to rise while there is sufficient time to prepare yourself to go to the synagogue to pray together with the congregation.",
            "Chapters of the Psalms, and other sections of the Torah, Prophets and Scriptures, in which all are not sufficiently fluent, must not be recited by heart. Even someone who knows [them sufficiently] to recite them by heart should be careful not to recite them by heart.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> you may recite <i>Psalms</i> by heart, since it is similar to saying prayers.</i> However, a blind person may recite them by heart.",
            "We must object to the practice of those who recite the supplications of the <i>Ma'amodos</i> and conclude: \"Blessed are You Hashem, Who listens to prayer.\" Rather, the proper conclusion is: \"Blessed is the One Who listens to prayer,\" omitting the Name of Hashem.

            "When he arises from his bed in the morning a person is considered as a newly created being, to serve the Creator, Blessed be His Name. He, therefore, must sanctify himself and wash his hands from a vessel, [just] as a <i>Kohein</i> washed his hands each day from the special basin [located in the Temple] prior to his service. This washing is indicated in the Scripture as it is said: \"I will wash my hands in purity and I will encircle Your altar, Hashem, to proclaim a sound of thanks, etc.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Psalms</i> 26:6,7.</i> There is also another reason for this washing. When man is asleep, his holy soul departs from him, and an unclean spirit comes and dwells upon his body. When he awakens from his sleep, the unclean spirit departs from his entire body except from his fingers, from which it does not depart until he pours water upon them three times alternately.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See paragraph 3 for exact procedure.</i> It is forbidden to walk a distance of four <i>amohs</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is also forbidden to lie in bed without washing your hands.

You should also wash your face in deference to the Creator, as it is said: \"For in the image of God He created Man.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Genesis</i> 9:6.</i> You should also rinse your mouth because of the spittle in it, for you must pronounce the great Name [of God] in holiness and purity.

In the morning when a person awakens he probably has a need to relieve himself or at least to urinate; therefore he should not recite the berachah over the washing of the hands at the time of washing, but rather after he relieves himself. He then washes his hands again and then recites the berachah <i>al netilas yadayim,</i> and then the berachah of <i>asher yatzar,</i> followed by the <i>berachos</i> on the Torah and then the berachah of <i>Elokai neshamah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to <i>Mishnah Berurah,</i> the berachah of <i>Elokai neshamah</i> should be said after the berachah of <i>Asher yatzar</i>.</i>",

The <i>Sefer Chassidim</i> states: \"When you wash your hands or recite the berachah on fruit or on the performance of a mitzvah,—berachos which everybody knows— you should direct your attention to recite them in the Name of your Creator Whose goodness is bountiful, Who granted you the fruit or bread for your pleasure, or commanded you to perform the mitzvah. You should not recite the berachah automatically, out of habit, spouting words from your mouth without thinking of their meaning. On account of such practice Hashem's anger was kindled, and He sent us word through the prophet, Isaiah, saying: \"Because this people approaches [Me] [only] with their mouths and honor Me [only] with their lips and their heart is distant from Me and their reverence for Me is merely perfunctory.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Isaiah</i> 29:13.</i> The Holy One Blessed is He said to Isaiah, See how the deeds of My children are merely external and they adhere to them [only] as a person adheres to and practices a custom of his forbearers; they enter My house and pray to Me the designated prayers merely as a custom of their fathers but not with their whole hearts.

When they recite the berachos they have no real intention of praising Me.

If the hole was made above three thumb-breadths, although upon tying the <i>tzitzah</i> and drawing the knot, the garment is creased causing the hole to be lowered, it is nevertheless invalid. If, after threading the <i>tzitzah</i> through the hole which is above the prescribed distance, he widened the hole by cutting it in order that the <i>tzitzah</i> hangs within three thumb-breadths [of the edge], it is [still] invalid because Scripture states: \"You shall make,\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Deuteronomy</i>, 22:12.</i> and not [that] which is already made.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See preface to this paragraph.</i> Likewise, the hole should not be closer to the garment edge, whether along its length or width, than the distance from the middle knuckle of the thumb to the end of the thumb nail, because less than this amount is also not considered the corner but rather <i>under</i> the corner. If the hole was the proper distance [from the edge] but by pulling the knot the garment edge shrank so that there is no longer the proper distance, it is nevertheless valid.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The distance to the corner must be measured with the garment in its normal state.</i> If there are fringes on the garment edge and they are not woven into the garment, it is questionable if they are included as part of these measurements or not. Therefore, it is necessary to cut them before attaching the tzitzis. Regarding the small tallis, some people have the custom to make two holes next to each other similar to the vowel <i>tzeirei</i>, and they thread the tzitzis through both holes so that they hang on the garment towards the outside.",
            "If at the time of tying the tzitzis the hole was at the proper distance, but afterwards the hole tore slightly or the edge of the garment tore so that the tzitzis are then less than the proper distance from the edge, it is not invalid, because the Torah insists that the <i>tzitzah</i> be placed under the corner only at the time of attaching [the tzitzis] as is stated in Scripture: \"They shall make for them tzitzis on the corners of their clothes etc.\" Nevertheless, it is preferable to make a hem around the hole and at the edge of the garment so that it does not [tear and] diminish [the distance to less than] the knuckle of the thumb [to the end of the nail].",
            "The custom is to tie the tzitzis [into] five double knots so that between them there will be four links. This [is done in the following manner:] the four strings are inserted into the hole and are tied in a double knot and are wound around seven times with the long string called the <i>shamash</i>. Again a double knot is made and again [the string] wound around eight [times] [with the <i>shamash</i>] [followed by] a double knot and wound around eleven [times] [followed by] a double knot, and wound around thirteeen [times] [followed by] a double knot. Since the beauty of the tzitzis is the equal dimension of all its links,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., it is more attractive if they are uniform.</i> therefore, in the first link, where the windings are few they should be a distance, one from another, and in the second link they should be brought closer. [This should] also [be done] in the third and fourth [links.] The proper lenght for each <i>tzitzah</i>, that is from the first knot until the end of the strings, should be at least twelve thumb-breadths.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See glossary.</i> The preferable adornment [would be] that all the links together should comprise a third of the <i>tzitzah</i> and the hanging strings the [remaining] two thirds. Therefore care should be taken that each link should be the width of a thumb<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See glossary.</i> so that all of the links should total four thumb-breadths, and the hanging threads should be eight thumb-breadths. If the tzitzis are longer, then the links should also be made slightly longer. It is preferable that all of the knots be made with the [same] four strings [always remaining] on one side, with the [other] four strings [always remaining] on the other side, so that each [individual] string is divided, half on one side [of the four], and half on the other side.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Explanation: Four strings are inserted through the hole. After they are drawn through, all the ends are lined up, making a total of eight strings which hang from the corner. While making the knots and winding the <i>shamash</i>, care should be taken that the strings remain divided in their respective two groups of four. The advantage of this will become apparent in paragraph 13.</i>",

They may not be invalid at the time of attachment and become valid [afterwards] through another action which would cause them to be valid. This [entire procedure] is invalid. Similarly if the <i>tzitzah</i> were made properly on another garment and that garment tore, and you wish to place the <i>tzitzah</i> in the same way on another garment, or even on this same garment, for example: if the garment tore from the hole until the edge of the garment<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the hole opened completely through the edge of the garment.</i> causing the <i>tzitzah</i> to fall, and you want to put it back to its proper place and then restitch the garment until the hole, this is also invalid because of <i>Ta'aseh velo min he'asui</i>. Similarly, if you tied the tzitzis when the garment was exempt from tzitzis, for example when most of the garment was sewn,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In a way that there are no four corners.</i> and afterwards you undid some stitches causing the garment to open most of the way,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thereby forming the corners.</i> and [as a result became] obligated to have tzitzis, [then,] if the tzitzis remain as they were,they are invalid because of <i>Ta'aseh velo min he'asui</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since he validated the tzitzis with an action other than making them now.</i> Rather,the tzitzis must be untied and then tied again properly. The same applies in any similar circumstance.",
            "Before putting on the tallis the tzitzis should be checked as to their validity. You must also check the strings that go through the hole as well as the <i>shamashim</i> (revolutions.) The strings should also be separated so that they must not be entangled with each other. If you are late in coming to the synagogue so that if you [take the time] to separate the tzitzis and check them you will be prevented from praying together with the congregation, you are not required to check them or separate them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The tallis that will be used on Shabbos should preferably be checked on Friday (<i>Bi’ur Halachah</i> chap. 13).</i>",

Therefore, you should be careful to purchase tefillin from an expert, and God-fearing scribe. Similarly, the tefillin straps should be purchased from a trustworthy person to be sure that the leather was processed for the sake of tefillin, from hides of a kosher animal. But among our many sins is the temptation to purchase tefillin and tefillin straps from anyone who sells them cheaply, [even though] their tefillin are invalid. Every God-fearing person should consider this: if he is concerned to select proper material for his clothing and utensils, then certainly he should not economize and worry about the cost when buying articles to serve God, blessed is His Name.

You should smear the straps with oil regularly to ensure their blackness, (but they should not be smeared with the oil of a fish called \"fishtron\" because this oil is derived from a non-kosher fish.) If the tefillin were damaged even slightly or if the stitches tore, you should immediately consult a rabbinic expert to determine their validity.

And also very frequently when tefillin become old, a separation appears in the upper hide of the <i>shel rosh</i> making it invalid. You should be greatly concerned about all of these matters. All who are careful [in the observance] of the mitzvah of tefillin and treat them with sanctity, not speaking of trivial or secular matters when wearing them, will have his days lengthened, and is assured of a share in the World to Come, as it is said: \"Hashem is upon them (for they carry upon themselves the Name of Hashem in the tefillin) and they shall live; and in all these things will my spirit live, and You will give me health and give me life.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Isaiah</i> 38,16.

[And] the rule is that in choosing between a regularly performed mitzvah, and one that is not performed [as] regularly, the regularly performed mitzvah takes precedence.

Great care must be taken that the tefillin should rest on its proper place. If you place the <i>shel rosh</i> [so that] even a small part is on the forehead where hair does not grow or even if you place the entire <i>shel rosh</i> on the place where hair grows but it is moved to the side and is not between the eyes, the mitzvah is not fulfilled, and the berachah is in vain.

But if one willfully and deliberately omitted a <i>tefillah</i>, there is no way to compensate. An important fact to keep in mind while studying this chapter: The compensation <i>tefillah</i> is performed by repeating the particular <i>tefillah</i> that is due at that time. For example, if at <i>Maariv</i> one compensates for an omitted <i>Mincha</i>, he does this by praying two <i>Maariv Shemoneh Esrei's</i>. Due to this, a number of unique situations arise: e. g. Omitting <i>Mincha</i> on Friday afternoon requires two <i>Maariv Shemoneh Esreis</i> on Friday night, both, being the Shabbos eve <i>Shemoneh Esreis.</i></small><small>This chapter discusses the form this compensation takes as well as what is considered deliberate and what is considered unintentional and unwilling.</small><br>It has already been explained (in Chapter Eighteen) that if [you allowed] the time of <i>tefillah</i> to pass intentionally, there is no compensation.

For example, if you know that someone plans to cheat in business, or that he plans to borrow money and not repay the loan, or that the person who wishes to marry someone’s daughter is a evil and corrupt man, then it is a mitzvah to inform the concerned party. (<i>Pis’chei Teshuvah</i> 156, also <i>Chafeitz Chayim, Rechilus</i> 9)</i> which is, speaking of someone's shame, even if it is true.

            "Be careful not to interrupt [by talking] between reciting <i>Al Netilas Yadayim</i>, and <i>Hamotzi</i>. But it is permissible to answer <i>Amein</i> to any berachah that you hear. A pause lasting as long as it takes to walk twenty-two <i>amos</i> [11.88 seconds], or from one house to another even if it is a short distance, or talking about something not related to the meal, is considered an interruption. However, if you did interrupt [in such a fashion], it does not matter, provided you did not perform some task in between; and did not engage in lengthy discussion, for if you did any of the above, it would be considered a distraction and you have to wash your hands again.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> disagrees.

            "You should break off the bread at the choicest part of the loaf in honor of the berachah. The choicest part is the crust or hard part, for there the bread is baked best, and it is the part opposite the place where the bread splits open. This occurs because at the place where it starts to bake, the pressure on the dough builds until the opposite side splits. However, an old person who finds it difficult to eat hard bread should cut the bread at the soft part. In any event, cutting the bread should not cause excessive delay between the berachah <i>Hamotzi</i> and eating the bread. Therefore [before saying the berachah], make a small, circular incision around the loaf, in a way that by holding the piece [to be cut], the entire loaf will be lifted along with it, for otherwise it is considered cut off, and we require that the berachah <i>Hamotzi</i> be said while the loaf is whole. [Therefore] leave the piece to be cut joined to the rest of the loaf and say the berachah <i>Hamotzi</i>, and after completing the berachah, you may separate them. In this manner the berachah is concluded while the loaf is still whole. Similarly, when breaking off a piece from a loaf which is not whole, do not cut the slice off completely before saying <i>Hamotzi</i>, so that the loaf should be as large as possible at the time of the berachah. On Shabbos, however, do not cut into the bread at all until after reciting the berachah, so that the loaves should be completely whole. Also on a weekday, if you eat a thin type of bread, [such as matzah], recite the berachah before breaking it, since there is no delay in breaking the bread.",
            "Do not cut off a small piece because you will appear miserly, on the other hand do not cut a piece larger than the size of an egg because you will appear gluttonous. This applies only if you are eating alone, but if you are eating with a group of people, and you must give from the piece you cut a <i>kazayis</i> to each of them, you may cut off as much as you need. On Shabbos, even if you eat alone, you may cut off as much as you need for the entire meal, in honor of the Shabbos. You indicate your fondness for the Shabbos meal, by your desire to eat generously of the food. You should eat the piece that you cut off before eating any other bread, to show your fondness for this <i>mitzvah</i>, since you recited the berachah over this piece. It is also preferable not to give from this piece to a non-Jew or an animal or fowl.",
            "Before reciting the berachah, place both hands on the bread because the ten fingers are symbolic of the ten <i>mitzvos</i> involved in making bread. [The ten are] 1. It is forbidden to plow with a team comprised of an ox and a donkey. 2. It is forbidden to plant diverse species together. 3. The stalks that fall during harvesting must be left for the poor. 4. A sheaf forgotten in the field must be left for the poor. 5. A corner of the field must be left unharvested for the poor. 6. It is forbidden to muzzle a working animal. 7. A portion of grain must be separated and given to the <i>kohein</i> (priestly family). 8. A tenth of the remaining harvest must be given to the Levite. 9. A tenth of the remaining harvest is then separated to be taken up to Jerusalem and eaten by the owner. 10. A piece of the dough is separated and given to the <i>kohein</i>. For this same reason there are ten words in the berachah of <i>Hamotzi</i>, and ten words in the verse (Psalms 145:15): \"The eyes of all look expectantly to You\" etc., and ten words in the verse (Deuteronomy 8:8): \"A land of wheat and barley\" etc., and ten words in the verse (Genesis 27:28): \"And may Hashem give you\" etc. When you pronounce the Name of Hashem, lift up the bread. On Shabbos lift up both loaves, and recite the berachah with concentration, making sure to enunciate clearly the letter <i>hei</i> in the word <i>Hamotzi</i>. Also allow a short pause between saying the word <i>lechem</i> and the word <i>min</i>, so as not to slur over the letter <i>mem</i>.

The reason for this is that the table is compared to the Altar [in the Holy Temple] and the food symbolizes the offering, and it is said (Leviticus 2:13): \"On all your offerings you shall offer salt.\" And because the table is compared to the Altar, it is best to take care not to kill any vermin [or other insects] on it.",

Therefore, if you have before you a piece of bread and a whole loaf, and you plan on eating from both of them during the meal, and both are from the same grain, even if the whole loaf is smaller than the piece of bread, and not as pure as the piece of bread, nevertheless, [say the berachah] and break the whole one, because it is the choicest. But if they are not from the same grain, and the whole one is of inferior quality, for example, if the whole loaf is made from spelt, and the cut piece is made from wheat, even if the piece is smaller than the loaf, you should say the berachah on the piece made from wheat. If, however, the whole loaf is made from barley, even though it is inferior to wheat, nevertheless, since barley is also clearly mentioned in the Torah, and since the loaf is a whole one, a God-fearing person should show respect also to the whole barley loaf. How can you accomplish this? Place the cut piece underneath the whole loaf [and say the berachah] and break off from both at the same time. If both of them are whole or both are already sliced and both are made from the same grain, say the berachah on the purest of the two. If both are equally pure, say the berachah on the larger of the two pieces.",

But if the bread made by the Jew is not as pure as the one made by the non-Jew then recite the berachah on whichever one you wish. If the host is stringent not to eat bread made by a non-Jew but it was brought to the table for the sake of a guest, it should be removed from the table until after the berachah of <i>Hamotzi</i> is said.",

If wine is not available, beer, 'mead' or whiskey may be used, if they are common beverages of the locality. This is true in an area where grapevines do not grow within a day's distance from the city, and as a result, wine is expensive and therefore these other beverages are used instead of wine.

            "Preface<br><small>The <i>Torah</i> writes: <span>אִם כֶּסֶף תַּלְוֶה אֶת עַמִי אֶת הֶעֳנִי עִמָךְ לאׁ תִהְיֶה לוֹ כְּנוֹשֶׁה לאׁ תְשִׂימוּן עָלָיו נֶשֶׁךְ</span> \"When you lend money to my people, to the poor among you, do not press him for payment, do not take interest payment from him\" (Ex. 22:24).</small><small>The <i>Torah</i> obligates us to lend money to one less fortunate than we, but, at the same time, forbids us to derive benefit from making this loan. Any benefit derived thereof is called <span>רִבִּית</span>—interest.</small><small>There are two major categories of <i>ribis:</i></small><small>1) <i>Ribis deoraisa</i> (<span>רִבִּית דְאוֹרַייתָא</span>) i.e. interest that is Scripturally prohibited. The classic case is when the lender stipulates at the time of the loan that the money is being lent with the condition that it be paid back with a set rate of interest. It makes no difference how high or how low the rate may be; in either case, it is <i>ribis deoraisa</i> and the lender must return the interest payment to the borrower. This holds true even where the borrower willingly agreed to the interest payment.</small><small>2) <i>Ribis derabanan</i> (<span>רִבִּית דְרַבָּנָן</span>), i.e. interest that is Rabbinically prohibited, such as a) <i>sa'ah besa'ah</i> (see para. 11); b) <i>avak ribis</i> (<span>אֲבַק רִבִּית</span>), i.e. \"a shade of <i>ribis</i>.\" The <i>Torah</i> prohibited only interest charged for a loan. The Rabbis added a prohibition on interest charged for a purchase; c) <i>ribis mukdemes</i> (<span>רִבִּית מֻקְדֶמֶת</span>), i.e. \"pre-loan\" <i>ribis</i>. The borrower sends money or gifts to the lender so that he will lend him money at a later date; d) <i>ribis me'ucheres</i> (<span>רִבִּית מְאֻחֶרֶת</span>), i.e. \"post-loan\" <i>ribis</i>. The lender did not set interest payments at the time of the loan, but the borrower paid interest at a later date. In cases of <i>ribis derabanan</i>, the <i>Bais Din</i> [Court] does not have the power to force the lender to return the interest collected, but it is, nevertheless, preferable in some cases that he do so on his own.</small><small>The laws of <i>ribis</i> are complex and this chapter will only touch some of the fundamentals of this important subject. It is, therefore, extremely advisable that when a question of <i>ribis</i> arises, a competent rabbi, well-versed in these laws, should be consulted.</small><br>It being the nature of man to desire and lust after money, and it being more likely for man to transgress the prohibition of interest than other prohibitions concerning money, because where robbery and fraud and the like [are concerned], the victim usually protects himself against robbery or fraud. Also, one who wants to rob or defraud another, will often be inhibited because of shame or because of fear. This is not so concerning interest, for the borrower willingly pays and is happy that he has found a place to borrow even with interest. The lender, too, thinks to himself that he is doing a great favor to the borrower by enabling him to profit with this money, many times more than the interest. It is, therefore, very easy for the person to be seduced, Heaven forbid, by his evil inclination to transgress this prohibition. Therefore, the <i>Torah</i> was very stringent with this prohibition. And many prohibitary laws are said concerning it. The lender transgresses six prohibitory laws, and will not be included in the resurrection of the dead, for it is said: \"He gave money [in return] for interest and he accepted interest, he shall not live.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ezekiel</i> 18: 13.</i> The borrower transgresses three prohibitory laws. The scribe,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Who draws up the loan contract.</i> the witnesses<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Who witnesses the loan and sign the contract.</i> and the co-signer each transgress one prohibitory law. [This applies] also [to] the broker who brought them together or if he was of help to one of them, for instance, directing the borrower to one from whom he could borrow, or if he directed the lender to one to whom he could lend, he, too, transgresses one prohibitory law.",
            "One who failed [to observe this prohibition] and collected interest, is obligated to return it (except where \"pre-loan\" interest and \"after-loan\" interest [are concerned] which are discussed later in paragraph 6).",
            "Even if the lender did not stipulate [<i>ribis</i>] with the borrower at the time of the loan, but, rather, lent him [money] without charge until a specified time, or where he sold him merchandise on credit until a specified time, or where there is an obligation of payment in any other situation, for whatever reason, and when the time for payment arrives he agrees to some additional payment in order to extend the due date, this too is considered <i>ribis</i>.",
            "Even if the borrower voluntarily makes an additional payment at the time the loan is repaid, which was never stipulated and he (the borrower) does not state that he is giving it to him as interest, [this] too is prohibited.",
            "Even if the borrower tells him at the time of the <i>ribis</i> payment that he is giving it to him as a gift, it is also prohibited to accept it from him. But if he already accepted the interest from him and then the lender repents and wants to return it to the borrower, and he the (borrower) waives it to him, [then] he is permitted [to keep the interest].",
            "It is prohibited to pre-pay the <i>ribis</i> or delay it [until after the payment of the loan]. For example, <i>Reuven</i> desired to borrow money from <i>Shimon</i>, and sent him a gift in advance, explaining [that he did so] in order to obtain the loan, or if it was a substantial gift, even though nothing was said, [nevertheless,] it is as if it were explicitly stated that it was for the purpose of obtaining the loan. This constitutes <i>ribis mukdemes</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Pre-loan interest.</i> If he [<i>Reuven</i>] borrowed money from him [<i>Shimon</i>] and repaid the money and then sent him a gift in consideration of the fact that [<i>Shimon's</i>] money was tied up by him during the loan period, this is <i>ribis me'ucheres</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Post-loan interest.</i>",
            "If one lends money to his friend for a specified time, [with the understanding that] [the borrower] reciprocate and lend him at another time, [either] a greater amount for the same period of time or an equivalent amount for a longer period of time, this is absolute <i>ribis</i>. [But,] if he lends him money with the condition [that the borrower] lend him at another time an equivalent amount of money for the same period of time, some say that this, too, is prohibited, and others say that it is permitted.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The explanation of this dispute requires some elaboration. The first opinion maintains that since the original lender is repaid his money and additionally receives the benefit of a loan being made to him, he is, therefore, benefiting from the loan he originally granted and is thus collecting <i>ribis</i>. The second opinion feels that the loan granted in return for the original loan does not constitute a gain to the original lender because he must eventually repay in full, the money that he borrows.</i> It is preferable to adhere to the stringent opinion. However, if no stipulation was made, but he voluntarily lends him money at another time, despite the fact that he is doing this only because the other previously granted him a loan, in this instance one may be lenient.",
            "The lender must take care not to derive any benefit from the borrower without his permission as long as his money is in the borrower's hands. [This applies] even if it is something that he would have done for him had he not lent him [money], because since he benefits without permission, he (the lender) seems to be assuming that because his money is in (the borrower's) hands, (the borrower) will forgive him. But, when he benefits from him <i>with</i> his permission [then], it is permitted, provided it is something that he would have done for him even had he not lent him money. Another provision is that it is not widely publicized.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To summarize: there are three requirements that enable the lender to derive benefit from the borrower while the money is yet on loan: 1) he must first receive permission from the borrower, 2) it must be a favor that the borrower would have done even if the lender had not lent him money, 3) it must be a favor that is not widely publicized.</i>",
            "If it was not the usual practice of the borrower to initiate greetings to the lender on other occasions he may not initiate them [now]. [The borrower] may not honor him with any sort of honor in the synagogue or any other place if it was not his usual practice to do so on other occasions. So, too, other types of <i>ribis</i> of words are prohibited, for it is said \"Interest of any <i>thing</i> which is interest.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Deut</i>. 23: 20.</i> [The sages interpret this to include] that even verbal <i>ribis</i> is prohibited.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew word <span>דָבָר</span> has the double meaning “thing” and also “word.”</i> <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bava Metzia</i> 75b.</i> The lender, likewise, is commanded regarding <i>ribis devorim</i>. For instance: If he says to the borrower, \"Let me know whether so-and-so arrives from such-and-such place.\" Though he bothers him only to speak a few words, if he had not been accustomed to do so before this (i.e. the loan) and now because of the loan he bids him to do so, this constitutes <i>ribis</i> because [the borrower] is obligated to him. And if you ask: \"Is it not written:'The borrower is a servant to the lender?'\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Proverbs</i> 22: 7—The verse seems to imply that the borrower is obligated to heed the lender’s wishes.</i> [The answer is:] the verse refers only to a situation where there is a dispute between them and the lender says, \"Let us go to the Supreme Court to adjudicate our dispute;\" and the borrower says that the dispute be heard here; then the borrower is obligated to travel to where the lender wishes; whereas there is no obligation on the lender to travel to the Supreme Court located elsewhere, for it is said: \"The borrower is a servant to the lender.\"",
            "Even advantages that are not monetary may not be derived by the lender from the borrower; for instance: if the lender is a craftsman, and it is not usual for this borrower to give him work at other times, but now, in return for the loan, he wants to give him work. This is prohibited.",
            "Preface to Paragraph 11<br><small>It was previously mentioned in the preface to this chapter that <i>ribis deoraisa</i> applies where the lender and borrower, at the time of the loan, agree to a set amount of interest to be repaid. If the rate of interest is not set, or if at the time of the loan it is uncertain whether interest will actually be paid, then this constitutes <i>ribis derabanan</i>.</small><br><small>The following paragraph discusses one aspect of <i>ribis derabanan</i>.</small><br><small>Unlike money whose value, halachically, remains constant, the value of goods and services fluctuate. This creates a problem when lending goods and services, because at the time of payment, albeit the same quantity is returned, nevertheless, the value of the said goods may have increased thereby giving the lender a profit on his loan. This kind of <i>ribis</i> is known as <span>סָאָה בְּסָאָה</span>, (<i>sa'ah be'sa'ah</i>) i.e. \"a bushel for a bushel.\" The derivation of this name stems from the situation where a bushel of grain is lent with the stipulation that a bushel be repaid. Since the repaid bushel may increase in value, this constitutes <i>ribis derabanan</i>.</small><br><small>An exception to this prohibition: If the borrower of the goods has the identical goods in his possession at the time of the loan which can potentially be used as payment at the time of the loan.</small><br>You may not lend someone a <i>sa'ah</i> of grain [with the stipulation] that he repay a <i>sa'ah</i> of grain even if they are both of the same species, because there is the possibility that, in time, the price of the grain will increase and, consequently, he will be repaying [value] greater than what he borrowed. Rather, a money valuation should be set on the grain, so that if the price of the grain increases, he will pay you only the amount of money [at which the grain was originally valued]. However, if the borrower owns even a small amount of that kind [of grain], he may borrow many <i>korim</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Kor</i> (pl. <i>korim</i>): a large measure of grain.</i> Similarly, if that particular [grain] has a set price in the marketplace, he may borrow [<i>sa'ah besa'ah</i>], even though the borrower does not possess any [grain] of that kind. All of the above applies where the same species of grain [are involved], but where two different species [are involved]; for instance, lending a <i>sa'ah</i> of wheat for a <i>sa'ah</i> of millet is prohibited under any circumstances, even if their prices are the same and [the borrower] posesses millet.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is a great likelihood that the prices of the two grains will not stay the same, creating the possibility that the repayment will be more than the loan.</i> When [the loan is] an insignificant amount, where it is unusual to be concerned about higher or lower prices, [<i>sa'ah besa'ah</i>] it is permitted in all cases.

The following is a brief introduction that will enable you to understand these important laws. There are two concepts, one called <span>שִׁהְיֶה</span>, <i>shehiyah</i> which means leaving food [on the fire, or in an oven, etc.], and <span>הַטְמָנָה</span>, <i>hatmanah</i>, which means “hiding,” in other words, covering the pot to keep it warm. There is a Rabbinical prohibition against leaving certain food on open coals because then you might stir the coals on Shabbos. <i>Tosafos</i> and <i>Rosh</i> rule that this prohibition is applicable even on <i>Erev Shabbos</i> and thus food may not be left on coals over Shabbos unless it is completely cooked. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 253:1 seems to agree, but we are accustomed to follow <i>Rashi’s</i> ruling and permit this on <i>Erev Shabbos</i> if it is half cooked, (or one third if need be), which makes it fit to be eaten with difficulty. The <i>Biur Halachah</i> says that it is preferable to be stringent in this matter. In our times we use gas or electric heat, but the prohibition remains, for you are liable to adjust the flame. In the case of a range, you are allowed to put up the meat <i>cholent</i> on <i>Erev Shabbos</i> even if it will be only slightly cooked when Shabbos arrives, if you remove all the coals (which is called <span>גְרֵיפָה</span>, <i>gerifah</i>) or you cover the coals (which is called <span>קְטִימָה</span>, <i>ketimah</i>). For this reason we use a <span>בְּלֶע</span> (<i>blech</i>) to cover both the flame and the knobs, (see <i>Igros Moshe</i> [<i>Orach Chaim, Responsum</i> 93]) since this makes the range <span>קְטוּמָה</span> (<i>Ketumah</i>). However, <i>Rav Akiva Eiger</i> ruled, that <i>ketumah</i> is not sufficient if the food is not at least half-cooked before Shabbos. See <i>Biur Halachah</i> 253. Also see <i>Sha’arei Teshuvah</i> 254: 5 that a metal sheet (<i>blech</i>) does not make it <i>ketumah</i>. If the meat is totally raw, you may put it up to cook immediately before Shabbos and we are not concerned that you will stir the coals. Since the meat was totally raw at the onset of Shabbos, it will be left untouched all night. [Rav Henkin z” l ruled that in our times it is best not to rely on this as our ovens are more efficient and that meat will be partially cooked by the time it is actually Shabbos according to <i>Rabbeinu Tam</i> who rules that <i>Shabbos</i> begins 72 minutes after sunset.] Even putting in one piece of totally raw meat immediately before Shabbos, qualifies the rest of the pot (at whatever stage of cooking it may be) [<i>Shulchan Aruch Harav</i>]. If you put the pot into the oven on <i>Erev Shabbos</i>, and seal the oven door with mortar, there is no concern that you will stir the coals because it is sealed. [<i>Rema</i> and most <i>Poskim</i> and <i>Kitzur</i>.] Even if food is totally cooked on Erev Shabbos, but will improve with shrinking in prolonged heat, (which is called <span>מִצְטַמֵק וְיָפֶה לוֹ</span> —it shrinks and is improved thereby), according to <i>Tosafos</i>, you may not leave it on a range that is not <span>גְרוּפֶה</span> or <span>קְטוּמָה</span>. As mentioned, it is preferable to be stringent in this matter if you can. Also, see <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 253: 70–73.</i> However, it is forbidden to open the oven at night, for there may be food which is not thoroughly cooked, and by closing the oven afterwards you will cause the cooking to be accelerated.",
            "The law which permits us to place cooked food in the oven even when the oven door is not sealed with mortar applies only to meat, and also to various kinds of legumes [peas, etc.], and also to various types of dough, provided you put them in the oven a long time before nightfall, so that the food will be cooked a little before nightfall, until it reaches the stage when it can be eaten with difficulty.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">94</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is one half or one third cooked.

However, if it can possibly be done in an unusual manner, or by a non-Jew, it should be done.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Though her situation is critical, a woman in confinement is part of the normal pattern in life. Therefore, it is preferable, where possible, to do the <i>melachos</i> in an unusual manner or have a non-Jew do them.</i> She is considered \"a woman at childbirth\" when seated on the birthing-stool,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Or delivery table.</i> or as soon as there is a flow of blood,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Or waterflow.</i> or if she doesn't have the strength to walk on her own. Also a woman who has miscarried more than forty days after having immersed herself [in a <i>mikveh</i>] has the classification of a \"woman at childbirth.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 330: 3; <i>Biur Halachah</i> 617.</i>",
            "During the entire first three days,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">After giving birth.</i> even if she says that it is unnecessary, Shabbos may be violated for her.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In order to attend her needs. [<i>Mishnah Berurah</i>]</i> Afterwards, if she has no other illness, but only the [usual] pain that follows childbirth, the rule is as follows: then, up to seven days, if she says: \"I require it,\" [Shabbos] may be violated for her sake,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Regardless whether the doctors agree or disagree. [<i>Mishnah Berurah</i>]</i> and if she says it is unnecessary then it is not violated.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Unless the doctors say that she requires something. [<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 330: 14]</i> The days referred to are counted from the day of the birth and [they do] not [have to be three] twenty-four-hour periods. For example: if she gave birth Wednesday in the late afternoon, then on Shabbos it is considered more than three days [since the birth],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e. from the end of the birth. Notwithstanding that less than seventy-two hours have passed. The author bases this ruling on the opinion of the <i>Magein Avraham</i>. See <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (330: 10).</i> and if she gave birth Shabbos in the late afternoon then, the following Shabbos, it is considered more than seven days. If there is the slightest possibility of danger, because the woman is weak by nature, [then] one who is lenient, and counts full 24-hour days, is not considered wrong.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e. is not considered to have transgressed in any manner.</i>",
            "Once seven days have passed, even if she says: \"I require [something],\" [Shabbos] may not be violated for her, but she is considered a non-critical patient until thirty days, and all her needs may be done [only] by a non-Jew. However, even a Jew may heat the house for her if a non-Jew is not readily available, even in mid-summer,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If she says she feels cold.</i> because a woman in confinement is considered critical for the first thirty days, as regards being cold.",
            "The newly-born infant may be washed. His umbilical cord may be cut, his limbs straightened, and all his needs may be attended. However, if he cannot survive, for example: he was born in the eighth month,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Today, an infant born in the eighth month is considered the same as other infants. <i>Chazon Ish, Rabbi S. Z. Auerbach</i>.</i> he may not be handled, but his mother may bend over him and nurse him because of her pain caused by her milk."

See <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 372: 16 and <i>Biur Halachah</i>.</i> If they wish, all the tenants of both courtyards can make one <i>eiruv</i> jointly, in order that they should be allowed to carry, from one courtyard into the other, even such vessels that were in the house when Shabbos began. And if there is even a window between the courtyards that measures no less than four <i>tefachim</i> wide by four <i>tefachim</i> high,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Four by four square. If the window is round it must be large enough so that a four by four [<i>tefachim</i>] square can be inscribed in it. That puts the diameter of the window at 5 3/5 <i>tefachim</i>.

If the tenants of the inner court did not make an <i>eiruv</i>, but the tenants of the outer court alone made an <i>eiruv</i>, then the <i>eiruv</i> is of no use to them, because, since the tenants of the inner court have a right of passage through the outer court, they prohibit the tenants of the outer court [from carrying in their own court]. This is true only if the people of the inner court did not make an <i>eiruv</i>. For then, since they forbid one another [to carry] in their own place (court), it is \"a foot (referring to the person) which is forbidden [to carry] in its own place,\" and a \"foot forbidden in its place\" forbids [others] also in another place. But if they made an <i>eiruv</i> by themselves, and they are allowed to carry in their own court, then it constitutes \"a foot permitted [to carry] in its own place,\" and they do not forbid carrying even to the tenants of the outer court. Consequently, if there is only one Jewish tenant in the inner court, since he is not forbidden to carry in his own court, he cannot cause a prohibition to be imposed [on the tenants of the outer court]. If two tenants live in the inner court and they did not make an <i>eiruv</i>, even though only one tenant lives in the outer court, since they are \"a foot forbidden in its own place,\" they also forbid the single tenant.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 378.</i>",

This is true only if the balcony is ten <i>tefachim</i> higher than the yard. If not, they are considered as one court and no separate <i>eiruv</i> can be made for each.</i>",
            "A house that has two apartments with a lobby through which you enter both apartments, and the apartments are occupied by two tenants, they are forbidden to carry anything even from their apartments into the lobby. Similarly, even if one apartment is divided into two rooms occupied by two tenants, even though the occupant of the inner room has no other exit than through the outer room, which leads into the courtyard, nevertheless, they may not carry anything, even from one room into the other until they make an <i>eiruv</i>. (If the two houses or apartments belong to one person, and he rented an apartment to someone, and he also has \"a hold<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tefisas yad</i>, “having a hold on the apartment,” means that the landlord stored articles in the apartment that are either too heavy to move or forbidden to be moved on Shabbos because they are <i>muktzeh</i>.

We pray <i>Maariv</i> in a low and tearful voice, like mourners. We do not say <i>Nacheim</i> (comfort) until the <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> of <i>Minchah</i> of the next day. After the <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i>, the <i>Chazzan</i> says the whole <i>Kaddish</i> including <i>tiskabbeil</i>, and everyone sits on the floor. Then a few lights are lit, sufficient for the congregation to say <i>Eichah</i> (Lamentations) and <i>Kinnos</i>. <i>Eichah</i> and <i>kinnos</i> are also recited in a low, tearful voice. When saying <i>Eichah</i>, a short pause should be made between one verse and the other, and a slightly longer pause between one chapter and the other. At the beginning of each chapter of <i>Eichah</i>, the <i>Chazzan</i> raises his voice a little more.

After that, <i>Ve'atah kadosh</i> (You are the Holy One) is recited by the congregation and the complete <i>Kaddish</i> without <i>tiskabbeil</i> is said by the <i>Chazan</i>, since it says in <i>Eichah</i>, \"He shuts out My prayer\" (Lamentations 3:8).

            "[The days] from <i>Rosh Chodesh Elul</i> until after <i>Yom Kippur</i>, are days of Divine favor [and acceptance.] Even though throughout the entire year the Holy One, blessed is He, accepts the repentance of those who return to Him wholeheartedly, nevertheless, these days are unexcelled and most suitable for repentance, because they are days of mercy and favor. On <i>Rosh Chodesh Elul</i>, Moshe went up Mount Sinai to receive the Second Tablets; he remained there for forty days, and came down on the tenth day of <i>Tishrei</i> when the atonement was completed. From then on these days have been designated as days of Divine favor [and acceptance,] and the tenth day of <i>Tishrei</i> as <i>Yom Kippur</i> [Day of Atonement]. In most communities it is the custom to fast on the day before <i>Rosh Chodesh Elul</i> and to recite the prayers of <i>Yom Kippur Katan</i> [minor Yom Kippur], in order to be spiritually prepared for repentance. If <i>Rosh Chodesh</i> occurs on Shabbos, <i>Yom Kippur Katan</i> is held on the preceding Thursday. The Ari (Rabbi Yitzchak Luria), of blessed memory, wrote, \"If he did not lie in ambush but Hashem made it happen, then I will provide …\" (Exodus 21:13) The initials of the words [<i>ina le'yado vesamti lecha</i>] form the acronym <i>Elul</i>, to indicate that this month is a favorable time for repentance to be accepted for the sins committed during the entire year.

Therefore, during these days you must examine your conduct and repent of your bad deeds. Sins about which you are in doubt require greater repentance than transgressions of which you are certain, for a person is more regretful when he knows that he committed a sin, than when he is uncertain of it. Therefore, the guilt offering brought in case of doubtful sin must be of greater value than a regular sin offering. During these days You should study more Torah, perform more mitzvohs, give more charity, and spend less time on your business. It was written by Rabbi Moshe Cordovero, of blessed memory, that you should consider these days as if they were <i>Chol Hamoed</i>, by performing only necessary work.

            "It is customary to perform the <i>kapparos</i> ritual <i>erev Yom Kippur</i>, early in the morning, for then God's compassion is at its height. Men take roosters and women take hens, and a pregnant woman takes a rooster and a hen. The rooster is taken in case she is carrying a male; and if the child is a girl, one hen suffices for the mother and the child.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Others say that she should take two hens, one for herself and one should she be carrying a girl. (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 605:3</i> Even for other people, one <i>kapparah</i> is sufficient for two persons. You should select white chickens, for it is said, \"Though your sins will be like scarlet they will become white as snow.\" (Isaiah 1:18). But when buying, you should not express preference for white fowl and pay a higher price for it, for this resembles the customs of the Amorites [superstition]. But if you happen to find a white one among the fowl you bought, you should choose [the white one.] You take the <i>kapparah</i> in your right hand, and recite the verses <i>Benei Adam</i> [children of man] etc., move it around your head, and say: <i>Zeh chalifasi</i> [This is instead of me] etc. three times. If you move it around someone else's head, you say <i>Zeh chalifasecha</i> [This is instead of you]. You should first move it around your own head and then do it for others. It is preferable that the <i>shechitah</i> is done also early in the morning, immediately after the <i>kapparos</i> ritual.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Where there are many chickens to be killed and a large number of people present, who pressure the <i>shochet</i> to do their chicken, it is best to do the <i>kapparah</i> ritual several days <i>before Yom Kippur</i>, rather than cause the <i>shochet</i> to kill the chicken improperly. He will be unable to inspect his knife properly before killing each chicken and this could cause the chicken to be <i>treife</i> (not kosher). It is also possible to avoid this problem by using money rather than chickens to do the <i>kapporos</i> ritual. (<i>Ibid</i> 605:2)</i> You should not think that this <i>kapparah</i> ritual is an actual atonement, but you should consider that what is done to the fowl should be rightfully done to you, because of your sins. You should agonize over your sins, and the Holy One blessed is He, in His compassion, will accept your repentance. It is customary to throw the intestines, the liver and the kidneys of the <i>kapparos</i>, on the roof or into the courtyard, where the birds can take them, for it is appropriate to take pity on living creatures on that day, so that Heaven will take pity on us. Another reason is that birds usually steal the seeds they eat [we, therefore, throw away their digestive organs] so that we should be mindful to keep away from theft. If you cannot obtain chickens for <i>kapparos</i>, you can take a goose or some other living thing that is not ritually acceptable as a sacrifice on the altar in the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>. Some authorities say that even fish [may be used], but not pigeons or young doves, because these were acceptable as altar sacrifices, and it would appear as if you were bringing sacrifices outside the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> [which is forbidden]. Some people follow the custom of giving the <i>kapparos</i> chickens to the poor, but it is better to redeem the <i>kapparos</i> with money, and give the money to the poor.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The poor person might be humiliated by the thought that you rid yourself of your sins through this chicken and now are sending it to him.

            "Sins committed against your fellow man are not atoned for on Yom Kippur unless you placate him, as it is said, \"You will be cleansed of all your sins before God.\" This means, only sins against God are atoned for on <i>Yom Kippur</i>, but sins committed against your neighbor are not atoned for on <i>Yom Kippur</i>, unless you placate your neighbor. Everyone must, therefore, be very careful, if he has in his possession illegally acquired property, to return it and placate [the rightful owner]. If you are holding property of which you are not certain whether or not it legally belongs to you, you should let your neighbor know that you wish to appear with him, immediately after <i>Yom Kippur</i>, before a <i>Beis Din</i> Rabbinical court to be judged according to the holy Torah; and you should firmly resolve to abide by the verdict pronounced by the <i>Beis Din</i>. If you sinned against your neighbor, even if only with words, you must appease him. It is your duty to go personally to appease him. However, if it is difficult for you to do so, or if you understand that he will be reconciled more easily through an intermediary, you should appease him through an intermediary. The person whose forgiveness is asked should forgive wholeheartedly and should not be ruthless, for this is not a Jewish characteristic, but a trait of Esau of whom it is said, \"And he kept his anger forever\" (Amos 1:11). It is also said of the Gibeonites, because they did not forgive and would not be appeased, \"The Gibeonites were not of the Children of Israel.\" (II Samuel 21:2) The characteristic of the Children of Israel is to be slow to anger and easy to be appeased. And when the sinner asks for forgiveness you should grant forgiveness wholeheartedly and willingly. Even if he tormented you a great deal you should not take revenge nor bear a grudge. On the contrary, if the offender does not take the initiative to come to you asking for forgiveness, you should present yourself to the offender in order that [the offender] should ask your forgiveness. If a person does not banish hatred [from his heart] on <i>Yom Kippur</i>, his prayers will not be heard, God forbid; but if you are tolerant and forgiving, all your sins will be forgiven.",

If the grave is more than three <i>parsa</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See glossary</i> away from the residence of the offender, he does not have to go there in person, but may send a representative. The representative should gather ten men to go to the grave, and say, \"I, the agent of so-and-so publicly declare that so-and-so has sent me to ask forgiveness for his sin,\" etc. If he insulted a dead person he does not have to go to his grave, but he should ask for his forgiveness at the place where he insulted him. But if he had defamed his character, he must accept upon himself to repent, for transgressing the prohibition of the early sages, against slandering the dead.",

She is then considered as one who has had a nocturnal emission, and the immersion is pointless in this case. The practical thing for her to do, is before immersing, to wash herself well with warm water; she will then experience no further discharge. However, if she had intercourse soon after her monthly immersion in the <i>mikvah</i>, or immediately before her menstrual period, when she is likely to become pregnant, then she is forbidden to destroy the semen of conception, and she should, therefore, not wash herself in warm water.

            "<i>Yizkor</i>, the memorial service for the departed is recited on <i>Yom Kippur</i>, because remembering the departed saddens and humbles a man's heart, and for the additional reason, that the dead, too, need atonement, as expounded in <i>Sifri:</i> \"Forgive Your people Yisrael,\" (Deuteronomy 21:8) refers to the living, \"whom You have redeemed,\" refers to the dead, this teaches us that the dead need atonement. We pledge to give charity on their behalf, (see chapter 67:3 and when doing so you should say \"without making a vow\"). A support for this practice is found at the end of the portion of <i>Tetzaveh</i> (Exodus 30:10) where it is written, \"He shall make atonement once each year,\" and this is followed by the verse (verse 12) \"Each shall give an atonement offering to God.\" The charity is credited to the departed, because God, Who tests the hearts, knows that if this man were alive, he, too, would have given charity. The living can pray to make the judgment of the dead less severe, just as David did when he prayed for [his son] Absalom (<i>Maseches Sotah</i> 10b); and the righteous dead appeal to God on behalf of their offspring. Also on the last day of <i>Pesach</i>, on the second day of <i>Shavuos</i>, and on <i>Shemini Atzeres, Yizkor</i> is said, because on these days we read <i>Kol habechor</i> [Every male first-born], (Deuteronomy 15:19), where it is written, \"Each person according to the gift of his hand\" (16:17). Because of that, people pledge money for charity. Since pledges are made to charity, it became the accepted custom to make these pledges on behalf of the departed souls, that God may remember them for good, and that He may also remember us along with them for good, through their merits.

He, therefore, commanded us to make it in the seventh month, which is the rainy season, when people usually move out of their booths to live in their homes; but we move out of our houses to live in the <i>sukkah</i>; which makes it clear to all that we are fulfilling the King's command.",

            "During the era of the Second <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> when the Greek kingdom was in power, they imposed evil decrees against the Jewish people, designed to put an end to their religion. They did not permit them to study the Torah or to perform the mitzvos; they plundered their property, [abducted] their daughters, entered the Temple, violating its sanctity and defiling its purity. Yisrael was in great distress because of them, for they oppressed them bitterly, until the God of our fathers took pity on them and delivered them from their dominion, and rescued them. The Hasmoneans, the sons of the <i>Kohein Gadol</i> defeated and killed them, and delivered Yisrael from their dominion. They appointed as king one of the <i>Kohanim</i>, and the Kingdom of Yisrael returned to power and [endured] for more than two hundred years, until the destruction of the Second <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>. When Yisrael triumphed over their enemies and destroyed them, —this happened on the twenty-fifth of Kislev—, they entered the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>, and found of the pure oil in the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> only one jar, that was stamped with the seal of the <i>Kohein Gadol</i>. This oil was sufficient to burn for only one day, but they lit the lights of the <i>Menorah</i> with it [and it lasted] for eight days, until they crushed olives and extracted pure oil. For this reason the Sages of that generation ordained that these eight days, beginning on the twenty-fifth of <i>Kislev</i>, should be days of rejoicing and praise. We kindle lights in the evening near the entrance to the house every night, during these eight nights, in order to display and reveal the miracle. These days are called <i>Chanukah</i>, which means [it is a contraction of] <i>chanu chaf-hei</i> [they rested on the twenty-fifth]. For on the twenty-fifth of <i>Kislev</i> they rested from their enemies [onslaughts]. Another reason [for the name <i>Chanukah</i>] is that during these days they dedicated the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> [<i>Chanukas habayis</i>], that had been defiled by the oppressors. Some authorities say, therefore, that it is a mitzvah to somewhat embellish the meals on <i>Chanukah</i>. Another reason for celebrating <i>Chanukah</i> is that the construction of the <i>Mishkan</i> was completed during these days. You should tell your family the story of the miracles that were performed for our forefathers, during these days (see Flavius Josephus). Nevertheless, a <i>Chanukah</i> feast is not considered a mitzvah, unless you sing hymns and praises to Hashem during the meal.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his responsa, <i>Maharshal</i> writes that it is fitting and proper that this festivity be combined and saturated with the spirit and joy of Torah. <i>Biur Halachah</i> writes: “Adding to our grave sins, there are those who have substituted card playing and other secular frivolities instead of hymns and praises [at their so called <i>Chanukah</i> parties].” (<i>Biur Halachah</i> 670:2)</i> On <i>Chanukah</i> you should give charity generously, for the days of <i>Chanukah</i> are auspicious to correct flaws of the soul through the giving of charity,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It has always been a custom for the poor to ask for charity during the days of <i>Chanukah</i>.

            "You are permitted to work on <i>Chanukah</i>. But women follow the custom, not to do any work during the time the <i>Chanukah</i> lights are burning, and you should not [cause them] to treat this matter lightly. The reason that women are more stringent about this [than men], is that the cruelty of the evil decree was directed mainly at Jewish women. For [the Greeks] decreed that a virgin girl before her wedding must first cohabit with the general. Another reason for this is that the miracle came about through a woman. The daughter of Yochanan the <i>Kohein Gadol</i> was a very beautiful girl, and the ruthless king wanted her to lie with him. She told him that she would fulfill his request; and she served him cheese dishes, so that he would be thirsty, and drink wine; then become intoxicated, and fall asleep. That is precisely what happened. Then she cut off his head and brought it to Jerusalem. When the general saw that the king was dead, he [and his army] fled. Therefore, some people have the custom to eat dairy dishes on <i>Chanukah</i>, to commemorate the miracle achieved by means of a dairy product.",

Nevertheless, the mitzvah done to perfection is to use olive oil, similar to the miracle in the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>, which was achieved with olive oil.

You should not use two candles braided together, for that would be like a torch; but each candle should [burn] by itself. You should not make the candles from wax that comes from houses of idol worship, for that is repulsive. All wicks are valid for <i>Chanukah</i> lights.

This being the case, we may assume, that in the days of Mordechai and Esther, they also fasted on the thirteenth day of <i>Adar</i>. Therefore, all Jews have accepted this day as a public fast day.

It is meant to remind us that the Creator, blessed is His Name, sees and hears the prayers of every person in his time of trouble, when he fasts and repents with all his heart, as He answered our forefathers in those days. Nevertheless, this fast is not as obligatory as the four fast days mentioned in <i>Tanach</i> (see Chapter 121 above). Therefore, you may be lenient when it is necessary.

For instance, if she has established a period based only on physical symptoms, for example, if thereafter she yawned three times, and did not perceive a flow, she no longer has to be mindful when she yawns again. If it is a period based on a combination when the fixed day arrives three times, and she yawned and did not perceive any flow, then the term is eliminated.

            "The <i>Kohein</i> is commanded not to defile himself through any form of contact with the deceased. Even an abortive fetus, whose limbs have not yet been connected with ligamentous tissue, is considered in this regard as a dead body. (If, however, the abortion occurred within forty days from conception, it is considered like water). The dead body need not be in its entirety, for this law applies even to things that have separated from the corpse such as blood and the like. He is also forbidden to defile himself through contact with the severed limb of a living person, if there is enough flesh on it that were it still connected, it would have possibly healed. Even if it is his own limb, he is forbidden to defile himself by touching it. A <i>Kohein</i> is forbidden to enter a house where a person is close to death, and even though a <i>gosseis</i> (dying person) is considered alive with regard to everything else, and he is not considered impure, nevertheless, the <i>Kohein</i> [by entering such a house] violates the command, \"You shall not desecrate,\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Leviticus</i> 21:12. A <i>Kohein</i> is forbidden to attend Medical School. See <i>Igros Moshe, Yorah Deiah</i> III 155.</i> for he is commanded to guard his priesthood so that it does not become profaned, and the <i>gosseis</i> may die at any moment.",
            "A <i>Kohein</i> is forbidden to enter a dwelling where there is a dead body, even if the dwelling is very large. Even if there are two rooms, and there is a dead body in one of them, and in the wall that separates them, there is a hole one <i>tefach</i> square, he is forbidden to enter even the second room, because the hole of one <i>tefach</i> square conducts the impurity into the second room. Likewise, if next to the second room, there is yet a third room, and between them, too, there is a hole one <i>tefach</i> square, the impurity passes also to the third room, and so ad infinitum. If the hole was made to admit light, even if it is only the size of a small coin, the impurity passes through.",
            "Therefore, in our regions, where the roofs project towards the outside with a width of no less than one <i>tefach</i>, and since we know that the width of one <i>tefach</i> conveys impurity, this projecting roof is considered a tent which conveys impurity. Hence, when two houses are close to each other, if the deceased is in one of them, the impurity passes through the door, or open window, beneath the ends of the projecting rooftop, and enters into the second house, through the open window or door. Thus the <i>Kohein</i> is forbidden to enter even the second house. This is true even if there are many houses closely adjoining one another.",
            "Even if the roofs are not of the same height, but one is higher than the other, even if the roof of the house where the impurity is found is much higher than the second roof or vice versa, there is a <i>halachah</i> handed down by Moshe from [Mount] Sinai, that the height is considered as lowered, that is, we consider as though the height was pressed down and lowered until it reaches the lower one. And since if it were lowered to the level of the bottom one, they would touch, therefore, the impurity passes from one to the other. But if there would be a space between them, even if ever so small, the impurity does not pass from one to the other.",

            "There is a <i>halachah</i> transmitted to Moshe from Sinai, concerning the door through which the deceased will be carried from the house. Since after the removal the house will again be ritually pure, although the door is now closed, nevertheless according to <i>halachah</i>, it is considered as though it is open, and therefore a <i>Kohein</i> is forbidden to stand under the lintel, even though the door is closed. Also, if there is a roof projecting a <i>tefach</i> over the door, it conveys the impurity to every possible place, as though the door were open. However, if there was an open door or window on another side measuring four square <i>tefachim</i>, the closed door is not considered as being open, and a <i>Kohein</i> is permitted to stand there provided the impurity cannot reach him through the open door or window.",

            "A <i>kohein</i> is forbidden to approach within four <i>amos</i> of a deceased person or a grave. This applies only when the deceased lies in his permanent place. But when he lies on the bier during the funeral procession, or when they are saying <i>Tzidduk Haddin</i>, even when they stop with the bier, since this is not his permanent place, the <i>Kohein</i> need keep away only a distance of four <i>tefachim</i>.",
            "If a <i>Kohein</i> is asleep in a house where there is a deceased person, where the impurity of the deceased penetrates, and it is impossible to shut him in, in order to prevent the access of the impurity, he should be awakened and told to leave the premises. If he is undressed, he should not be told about the impurity, but merely called outside so that he may get dressed first; for a person's dignity is very important. However, as soon as he is aware of the impurity, he is forbidden to wait there until he gets dressed, but he must leave immediately.",
            "Some <i>Poskim</i> maintain that even the corpse of a non-Jew causes impurity in a house. A <i>Kohein</i> should be mindful of this opinion and not walk over the grave of a non-Jew. Especially when there is reason to believe that an apostate may have been buried there (too), for an apostate is like a Jew (in this regard). Also the child born by an apostate woman from a non-Jew, is like in Jew in this regard.",
            "A <i>Kohein</i> is permitted to defile himself at the death of his relatives, and it is a <i>mitzvah</i> for him to do so. These are the relatives for which he may defile himself: his wife whom he was permitted to marry, his father, his mother, his son or his daughter, his brother and sister born from his father, provided they were born full term, but for a child who may have been aborted, a <i>Kohein</i> may not defile himself. He may not defile himself for a married sister.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even if she was divorced or widowed and no longer married.</i> Some <i>Poskim</i> maintain that which a <i>Kohein</i> is permitted and is a <i>mitzvah</i> to defile himself for relatives is only for the needs of burial, or to bring a coffin, or shrouds, or the like. Consequently, on Shabbos, a day when he may not be buried, a <i>Kohein</i> is forbidden to defile himself even in order to guard the deceased. It is proper to follow this strict opinion. However, concerning things necessary for burial, it is certainly a <i>mitzvah</i> for him to defile himself. Even if there is a Burial Society to take care of all the arrangements, and he has nothing to take care of, he is permitted to be in the house in case they might need something. He may defile himself for these relatives only until the grave is closed, and not thereafter.",
            "A <i>Kohein</i> is forbidden to defile himself for parents who abandoned the practices of the Jewish people, and not for one who committed suicide. Similarly, a <i>Kohein</i> is forbidden to defile himself for anyone for whom the rules of mourning need not be observed.",
            "A <i>Kohein</i> may not defile himself for a relative unless the body is complete but not if it is missing a limb. Therefore some <i>Poskim</i> maintain that a <i>Kohein</i> may not defile himself for a slain relative, for his body is considered incomplete; and it is proper to heed this strict opinion.",
            "Some ignorant <i>Kohanim</i> are accustomed to visit the graves of the righteous, maintaining that the graves of the righteous do not defile. They are in error, and such practice should be protested.",
            "Just as an [adult] <i>Kohein</i> is warned against defiling himself, so too are adult <i>Kohanim</i> warned concerning minors, as it is said, \"Say to the <i>Kohanim</i>… and say (to them).\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Leviticus</i> 21:1.</i> Because the word \"say\" is written twice, our Sages, of blessed memory,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Maseches Yevomos</i> 114a.</i> inferred from this that the adults are warned concerning the minors. They must not be the direct cause of their defilement by bringing them into a house where there is a deceased person, but if the minor defiles himself on his own, there is no need to remove him. However, if he has reached the age of training, he should be removed. The pregnant wife of a <i>Kohein</i> is permitted to enter a house containing a corpse.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even if it seems she will give birth there, because perhaps it will be a girl; and if not, it may not be a viable child. <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 343:3.</i>",
            "The <i>Kohanim</i> cannot force<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If it was customary to remove the body quickly to the place where they wash it, you may force them. <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 311:13.</i> the relatives of the deceased to hasten the removal of the deceased from its place so that they may enter their homes,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even if the synagogue is under the same roof and the <i>Kohanim</i> are prevented from entering. <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 311.13</i> unless the <i>Kohein</i> is ill and is unable to leave the house. In that case the relatives are forced to remove the deceased, so as not to cause the sick [<i>Kohein</i>] to transgress a law of the Torah. If the deceased is an aborted fetus, its relatives can be forced, in any event, to remove it, even on Shabbos through a non-Jew."
