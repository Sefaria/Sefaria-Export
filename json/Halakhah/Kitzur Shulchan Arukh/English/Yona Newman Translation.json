            "\"I have set the Lord always before me.\" This is a cardinal principle in the Torah and (a fundamental rule) of life among the pious who go before G-d. Because it is not how a person sits, moves and works when he is alone at home but how he sits, moves and works when he is in the presence of a great king. Similarly, neither his conversation, nor his attitude, when he is among his family and friends, like when he is in the presence of royalty. For then he will certainly take care on his behaviour and his speech that they will be suitably correct. How much more should a man watch himself, because the Great King, the Holy One, blessed be He, whose glory fills all the earth, is standing over him and observing his actions, as it is said: \"Can a man hide himself in secret places that I cannot see him?\" says the Lord, \"Do I not fill heaven and earth?\", he will certainly immediately acquire a feeling of reverence and submission from fear of the Blessed Name and he will be ashamed [to do wrong]."
