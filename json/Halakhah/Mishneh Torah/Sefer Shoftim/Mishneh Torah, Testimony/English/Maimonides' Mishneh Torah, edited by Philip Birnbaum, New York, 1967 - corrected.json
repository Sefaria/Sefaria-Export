[However,] it has been traditionally inferred that the testimony of one witness subjects him to taking an oath, as we've explained in Laws of Plaintiff. \n"

As it is written: \"You shall do to him as he schemed to do\" (Deuteronomy 19:19), but has not yet done. This interpretation is based on tradition. However, if the accused against whom they had testified was lashed, they are lashed. So too, if by the evidence submitted by them, money was handed over from the defendant to the plaintiff, it is returned to the defendant and they make restitution to him."
