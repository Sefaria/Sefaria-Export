            "The  king  is  banned  from drinking  wine  in  a  drunken  way,  as Mishlei 31:4 states, “It is not for kings to drink  wine.”  Rather,  he  should  be engaged  in  Torah  and  public  needs  day and  night,  as  Devarim  17:17  says,  “It should  accompany  him,  and  he  should read it all the days of his life.” Similarly, he  should  not  be  always  flooded  with women.  Even  if  he  has  only  one  [wife], he  should  not  be  always  with  her  like the  rest  of  the  fools,  for  Mishlei  31:3 says,  “Do  not  give  your  strength  to women.” The Torah emphasized removal of the heart, as Devarim 17:17 says, “ Lest his heart go astray”, for his heart is the  heart  of  the  whole  Israelite  nation. Thus,  the  verse  compels him  to  stick  to Torah  more  than  the  rest  of  the  people, saying “all the days of his life.” "
