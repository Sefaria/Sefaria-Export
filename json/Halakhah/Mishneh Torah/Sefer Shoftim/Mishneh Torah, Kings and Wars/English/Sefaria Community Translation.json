As it says, \"you shall surely place,\" i.e., that his fear be on you. They do not ride on his horse. And they do not sit on his throne. And they do not use his scepter, his crown, or any of his instruments. And when he dies, all of them are burnt before him. And similarly one may not use his slaves or slave-women and servants, unless one is another king. Thus Avishag was permitted to Solomon and forbidden to Adonijah. ",

He should not act more proudly than necessary toward [the people] Israel, as it is written, \"Thus he will not act haughtily toward his fellows\" (Deuteronomy 17:20).  He should be gracious and merciful toward the lowly and the great.  He should show concern for their property and welfare.  He should show regard for the dignity of the lowliest.   When he addresses the public, he should speak gently, as it is written, \"Hear me, my brothers, my people!\" (I Chronicles 28:2).  It is also written, \"If you will be a servant to these people today, etc.\" (I Kings 12:7).  He should always behave with great modesty.  None was greater than our Teacher Moses of whom it is written, \"What are we?  Your complaints are not with us...\" (Exodus 16:8).  He should bear with their troublesomeness, burdensomeness, complaining, and irritation as a governor bears with an infant.  Scripture dubs him a shepherd:  \"to tend His people Jacob\" (Psalms 78:71).  The way of the shepherd is stated in Tradition [that is, the Prophets], \"as a shepherd He pastures his flock: He gathers the lambs in His arms and carries them in His bosom...\" (Isaiah 40:11). "

And it appears to me that if a king of Israel conquers the land of Egypt in accordance with the court, that it is permissible; and [the Torah] only prohibited individuals from returning or dwelling there when it is in the hands of the gentiles, since their deeds are more corrupted than all of the lands, as it is stated (Leviticus 18:3), \"Like the doings of the land of Egypt.\" ",

However, if produce is inexpensive and money is not ample, and there is not from what to earn [it] and coinage is gone from the pocket, he may go out to any place where he can find relief.

And if they did delve into the Torah or rested as per a Sabbath or created a new religion – we give them lashes and we punish them – and let them know that they are liable for death because of this. But we do not execute them.",
            "A Ben Noach that wanted to do a mitzvah from the other mitzvahs of the Torah in order to receive a reward – we do not prevent them to do it according to the Jewish law. And if they brought an Olah (elevation) sacrifice (to the Temple – when it stood) we accept it from them. If they give charity we accept it from them. And it appears to me that we give it to the poor of Yisrael since he feeds a Jew and it is a Mitzvah upon them to sustain his life. However a non-Jew that gave charity – we accept it from them and give it to non-Jewish needy.",
            "The Jewish court of law is obligated to appoint Judges for the sojourning converts (ie, benai noach) to Judge them according to their laws in order that the world not be destroyed. If the court of law saw it fit to appoint judges from them (the benei noach) they may be appointed. And if they saw it fit to appoint (Judges) for them from the Jews – they may be appointed.",
            "Two non-Jews that came before a Jewish court of law to be Judged according to the Jewish laws – and both of them agreed – we make a judgement from the Torah. If one wants and the other does not – we do not force him to be judged – unless it is for their own laws. If their was a Jew and a non-Jew if there is a merit for the Jew to be judged according to their laws we judge them with their laws and say to them this is [the verdict of] your law. And if there is a merit for the Jew in our laws – we judge them according to the Torah and say to them this is [the verdict of] our law. And thus it appears to me that we deal with the sojourning converts with proper conduct and acts of loving kindness like a Jew – for we are commanded to sustain them as it states \"To the sojourner in your gates give it to them and let them eat\" (Devarim / Deut. 14:21) and this as what our sages said – how do we double for them peace among the nations – not for a sojourning convert. And even for non-Jews – our sages commanded us to visit the sick and to bury their dead with the dead of the Jews and to give sustenance to their needy among the needy of the Jews – because of promoting peaceful ways. Behold there is the verse - \"Hashem is good with all and he is merciful upon all of his works\" (Tehilim / Psalms 145, 9) and it is said \"And its ways are ways of pleasantness and all its paths are peace.\" (Mishle – Proverbs 3, 17) "

            "The King the Messiah (lit. the annointed) will stand up and return the Kingdom of the house of David to its old [glory], to the first rule, and build the Temple (lit. holy), and gather the scattered ones of the Israel, and return all of the laws in his days as they were before; bringing sacrifices, and making shmitahs (leaving the land fallow in the seventh year) and jubilees like all of the commandments that it says in the Torah.  And anyone who does not believe in him, or does not anticipate his arrival, it is not only in the other prophets that he is denying but in the Torah and in Moses our teacher; because the Torah testifies on him [the Messiah] as it says \"and Hashem your Lord will return your captives and your pitied ones, and return and gather . . . if you scattered ones are at the end of the heavens . . . and Hashem will bring them to you. (Deuteronomy 30:5)\"  And these express words in the Torah they include all of the things that were said by the hand of all of the prophets.  Even in the piece about Bilam it is said, and there he prophesied about the two messiahs--about the first messiah who is David who saved Israel from their enemies and from the last messiah who will arise from his children who will save Israel [in the end].  And there it says, \"I will see him, but not now,(Number 24:17)\"--that's David.  \"I will behold him, but not nearby,\"--that's the King Messiah.  \"A star will come from Jacob\"--that's David.  \"And a scepter-bearer will arise out of Israel\"--that's the King Messiah.  \"He will strike the corners of Moab\"--that's David.\"  And so it says \"And he defeated Moab and measured them with a cord (2 Samuel 8:2).\"  \"..and destroy all the sons of Seth (Numbers 24:17)\"--that's the King Messiah, as it is said about him \"And his reign will be from sea to sea (Zachariah 9:10).  \"And Edom will be an inheritance (Numbers 24:18)\"--that's David, as it is said, \"And Edom were slaves to David (2 Samuel 8:14)\", etc.  \"And it will be an inheritance, etc. (Numbers 24:18)\" --that's the King Messiah, as it is said, \"Saviors will ascend Mount Zion (Ovadiah 1:21)\", etc. ",
            "And as regarding the cities of refuge it states: \"If the Lord your God expands your border\" (Deuteronomy 19:8) \"and you will add three cities\" (Deuteronomy 19:9).

And God did not command for naught But in the words of the prophets this matter does not need seeking out, because all the books are filled with this matter.",
            "And don't think that the King Messiah needs to do wonders and signs and create a new reality in the world or resurrect the dead, or similar things. This is not the point (of The Messianic redemptive process). For Rebbe Akiva, the wisest of the Mishnaic sages, was the \"weapons bearer\" of The King Ben Kuziba (aka Bar Kochba). And he said concerning him (Ben Kuziba), that he was The King Messiah. And all the sages of the generation  were in agreement until he was killed due to his sins. Since he was killed they (then) knew that he was not (the Messiah). The sages did not request from him, neither a sign nor a wonder (i.e. miraculous actions) .The main thing is that the Torah and its laws and statutes are everlasting forever and ever, and we do not add or subtract from them....",
            "And if a King arises from the House of David who is fitting in (observance) of the  Torah and fulfilling its commandments, and he compels all of Israel to follow it, and he strengthens it diligently, and he fights the was of God. Then, he is assumed to be the Messiah. If he fights and is victorious and defeats all of the surrounding nations, and builds The Temple in its place, and gathers all the scattered remnants of Israel, then he is definitely the Messiah. And he will repair the entire world to worship God together, as it is said, \"For then I will change all of the peoples to [having] a clear language so they can all call God by name and worship Him as one.\" (Zephaniah 3:9) ",
            "And if he's not successful with this, or if he is killed, it's known that he is not the one that was promised by the Torah. And thus, he is like all of the kosher kings from the House of David who died.  And The Holy One blessed be, only established him to test the masses, as it is said, ",
            "Even Jesus the Christian who it seemed that he would be the Messiah and was killed in court, Daniel had already prophesied about him, as it is said, \"And the violent men of your people will be lifted up to fulfill the vision, and they will be failed (Daniel 11:14).\"  And is there a greater failure than this?  All of the prophets spoke of the Messiah, the redeemer of Israel and their savior, and the gatherer of the captives, and the strengthener of their mitzvot--but this one cause Jews to be lost by the sword, and for their remnants to be scattered and humbled, and to change the Torah, and for the majority of the world to do wrong by worshiping a god other than God.

            "But, the plans of the creator of the world--no person can understand them for our ways are not the same as His ways and our plans are not His plans.  And all of these things about Jesus of Nazareth, and about that Ishmaelite who rose after him--they are only to make the path for the King Messiah straight, and to fix the whole world for worshipping God together, as it is said, \"For I will give the peoples clear speech, for them all to call out the name of God, and to worship Him with one purpose (Zephaniah 3:9)",

The whole world is already filled with the words of the Messiah, and the words of the Torah, and the words of the Mitzvot, and these words have been spread on distant islands, and to many peoples of uncircumcised hearts, and they deal with these words, and with the mitzvot of the Torah--they say 'These mitzvot were true but they are already nullified in this time, they aren't applicable forever.'  And they say, 'There are things hidden in them, and they're not just a simple meaning, and the Messiah already came and revealed their secrets.'",

            "Don't think that in the days of the Messiah anything will be changed in the order of the world or that there will be some innovation in the works of creation.  Rather, the world will behave according to its custom.  And what is written in Isaiah, \"And the wolf will live with the lamb and the tiger will lie down with the kid (Isaiah 11:6)\"  is a metaphor and a riddle.  The ideas is that Israel will dwell safely with the evil idol worshipers who are compared to a wolf and to a tiger, as it is said, \"A desert wolf will slaughter them and a tiger will keep watch over their cities (Jeremiah 5:6).\"  And everybody will return to the religion of truth and they will not steal and they will not destroy.  Rather, they will eat the permitted things together with Israel, as it is said, \"And the lion, like the herd, will eat straw (Isaiah 11:7).\"  And so too all of things like this on the topic of the Messiah are metaphors.  And in the days of the King Messiah, it will be known to all what the metaphor is about and what is hinted at by them. ",
            "The sages said 'There is no difference between this world and the days of the Messiah, except for subjugation to [foregin] kings.'  It seems from the simple meaning of the words of the prophets that in the beginning of the days of the Messiah, there will be a war between Gog and Magog, and that before the war between Gog and Magog, a prophet will rise to straighten Israel out and to prepare their hearts, as it is written, \"Behold, I am sending to you Eliyah (Malachi 2:23).\"  And he is not come to make the pure impure or to make the impure pure, and not to disqualify people who have been considered 'kosher', and not to certify those of have been disqualified, rather to bring peace to the world, as it says, \"He will return the hearts of the fathers to their children (Malachi 3:24)\"  And there are those among the sages who say that before the Messiah will come, Elijah will come.  And all of these things and things like them, people wont' really know how it we be until it happens.  Because these things are not explicit in the prophets' words.  And the sages also don't have a received tradition about these things, just and interpretation of the verses.  Therefore, they argue about these things.  And in any case, there is no order to these things happening and the details of them is not necessary to the religion.  And a person should never study the tales or spend a long time on the Midrash told about these issues and things like them, and they shouldn't be made to be essential, since they bring about neither awe nor love.

            "In the days of the King Messiah, when he is established in hi reign and all of Israel is gathered to him, the descent of everybody will be decided by his mouth through the holy spirit that will rest upon him, as it is said, \"He shall sit and refine and purify (Malachi 3:3), etc.\"  And he will purify the children of Levi first and say, 'this one is descended from a Cohen and this one is descended from a Levi.  And he will push those who are not descendants down to [the status of] Israel, which is why it says, \"The Governor said to them...until a Cohen arises with Urim and Tumim (Ezra 2:63)....  ...",
            "The sages and the prophets didn't desire the days of the Messiah so that they could rule over the whole world and not so that they would dominate over the idol worshippers and not to be lifted up by the nations and not to eat, to drink, and to be merry.  Rather it was so that they would be free for [study of Torah] and its wisdom without disturbances or distractions, so that they can merit living in the world to come, as we explained in the laws of T'shuvah. ...",

Therefore, Israel will be great sages and they will know the hidden things and they will attain knowledge of their creator as much as people can, as it is said, \"For the earth will be filled with knowledge of God like water covers the oceans.  ..."
