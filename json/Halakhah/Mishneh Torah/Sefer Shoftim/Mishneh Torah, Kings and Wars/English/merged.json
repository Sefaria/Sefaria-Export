            "Israel was enjoined with three Commandments upon entering the Land: to appoint a king, as it says, “<i>you shall set a king over yourselves</i>” (Deut. 17:15); to destroy the descendents of Amalek, as it says “<i>erase the memory of Amalek</i>” (Deut. 25:19); and build the Temple, as it says, “<i>you shall seek His habitation, and there you will come</i>” (Deut. 12:5).",
            "The appointment of the king comes before the war with Amalek, as it says, “<i>G-d has sent me to anoint you king…Now, go and smite Amalek</i>” (I Samuel 15:1-3). The eradication of Amalek precedes the construction of the Temple, as it says, “<i>and it was so, when the king was settled in his home, and G-d allowed him respite from his enemies all around. And the king said to Nathan, the Prophet, ‘I am living in a house of cedar</i>…<i>’” </i>(II Samuel 7:1-2). Now, since the appointment of a king is a Commandment, why did G-d not want (a king) when the people asked Samuel for one? Because their request was merely due to resentment, and not for the purpose of fulfilling a Commandment. They had rejected Samuel the Prophet, as it says, “<i>as they have forsaken Me…so do they also with you</i>” (I Samuel 8:7).",
            "At first, a king was not appointed other than by the Court of Seventy (Sanhedrin) and with consent of a Prophet. So was Joshua appointed by Moses our Teacher and his Court, and Saul and David by Samuel the Ramathite and his Court.",
            "A convert may not be appointed king, even after many generations, until one has a Jewish mother, as it says, “<i>You cannot place over yourselves a foreign man, one who is not your brother</i>” (Deut. 17:15). This rule is also applicable for any governing Position, and includes a commander in the Army and any officer in the Army<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lit., officers of the fifties or tens.</i>, or even the one who is merely responsible for the reservoir which irrigates the fields. It goes without saying that a convert cannot be appointed Judge or President. All these Positions must be filled by (born) Jews, as it says, “<i>place upon yourselves a king from those who are close to you</i>” (ibid.). All official, governing Positions must be filled with those from among our brethren.",
            "A woman may not be appointed queen, as it says, “<i>upon yourselves a king</i>” (Deut. 17:15) - a “king” and not a “queen”. A woman may not be appointed to any Position<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lit., mission.</i> in Israel. Only may a man. ",
            "A butcher<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Or, blood-letter.</i>, barber, bath-attendant or tanner may not be chosen either as a king or as a Kohen Godol (High Priest). Not because they are disqualified, but because these professions are degrading they are always viewed trivially in the eyes of the people. Even if he worked at one of these vocations for but one day, he is disqualified (from becoming king).",
            "The king is anointed with the (original) Anointing Oil<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Prepared by Moses.</i>, as it says, <i>“Then Samuel took the vial of oil and poured it upon his head, and he kissed him</i>” (I Samuel 10:1). The anointing qualifies him and his sons in perpetuity, and ensures that the monarchy will be hereditary, as it says, “<i>In order that he may have many days in his reign, he and his sons, among Israel</i>” (Deut. 17:20). If the king (dies and) leaves a young son, the monarchy is retained for him until he gets older, as Yehoyadah did with Yoash. Those who take precedence in (the laws of) inheritance, take precedence for succession to the throne; and the older son precedes the younger one. This is not only true for the monarchy but for all governing Positions and all appointments in Israel – a son inherits from his father, and so his son from him, forever. This is as long as the son follows in his father’s footsteps with regard to wisdom and awe. If the son was G-d-fearing but lacked wisdom, he is appointed to succeed his father, and trained. However, if he was not G-d-fearing, even though he was very wise, he is not appointed to a Position in Israel. From the time David was anointed he merited the crown of kingship, the monarchy became his and that of his male descendents for all time, as it says, “<i>Your throne, will be established forever</i>” (II Samuel 7:16). This only refers to those who are of legitimate lineage, as it says, “<i>If your sons shall observe my covenant</i>” (Psalms 132:12). Even thought he only merited the monarchy for his descendents who have legitimate lineage, the monarchy will never be withdrawn from the descendants of David. The Holy One, Blessed Be He, had promised him as such, as it says, “<i>If his children forsake my Torah and walk not in My statutes,…and I shall visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with disease. But My mercy I shall not break off from him</i>” (Psalms 89:31-34).",
            "Should a prophet install a king from any of the other Tribes of Israel, and that king follows in the ways of the Torah and observes the Commandments, and fights the Wars of G-d, he, too, is a king and all the Commandments of the King are applicable to him. This, even though the “essential” monarchy belongs to David and from his children there will be kings. For we see that Achiya the Shilonite appointed Jeraboam and said to him, “<i>And it will be, if you listen to all that I command you…and I shall build for you a sure house as I built for David…</i>” (I Kings 11:38). And Achiya said to him, “<i>And to his son, I shall give one tribe, so that it shall be a remembrance for David my servant for all days before me in Jerusalem</i>” (I Kings 11:39).",
            "The monarchy remains with the House of David forever, as it says, “<i>your throne shall be established forever</i>” (II Samuel 7:16). In contrast, if a king from (any of the other tribes of) Israel is appointed, the monarchy will cease from his House, as it says with regard to Jeraboam, “<i>but not for all the days</i>” (I Kings 11:39).",
            "The kings of Israel are not anointed with the (special) Anointing Oil, but with persimmon oil only. They may never be appointed in Jerusalem – only may the descendants of David. Only descendants of David are anointed (with the special Anointing Oil).",
            "When a king of the House of David is anointed, he is anointed only next to a spring<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Done to symbolically compare him to an ever-flowing spring.</i>. ",
            "The son of a king is not anointed unless this is necessary to resolve a dispute (of succession) or a war. Thus, Solomon was anointed because of Adoniyoh, Yoash because of Asalioh, and Yehoachoz because of Yehoyokim his brother."

            "The king must receive great honor. He is to be venerated and feared by everyone, as it says, “<i>Surely, shall you place</i>” (Deut. 17:15) – that is, his awe is to be upon you. No one may ride his horse, sit on his chair<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Or, throne.</i>, use his scepter or his crown or any of his serving vessels<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Or, his appurtenances.</i>. When he dies, all of these are destroyed by fire. His slaves, maidservants and attendants may not be employed by anyone except by another king. For this reason Avishag was permitted to Solomon, but not to Adoniyoh. ",
            "No one else may ever have marital relations with a wife of a king. Even a king may not marry the widow or divorcee of a different king.",
            "It is forbidden to see a king naked or when he is having his hair cut or when he is in the bathhouse or when he is drying himself off. He does not perform Chalitzoh<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Divorce the wife of his deceased, childless brother.</i>, as it says, “<i>and she shall spit before him<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Or, <i>in his face.</i></i></i>” (Deut. 25:9) since this would be a disgrace. We do not listen to him even if he allows it because a king cannot forgo his own honor. Since he cannot perform Chalitzoh, he cannot perform Yibum<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Levirate marriage with his sister-in-law.</i>. And since it is not possible to perform Yibum with his wife, Chalitzoh is not performed with her either. She will forever remain “bound to her husband”.",
            "Should one of the king’s relatives die, the king must not pass the threshold of his palace<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Or, chambers.</i>. When he is being comforted<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">With the mourner’s meal.</i>, the entire nation sits on the ground and he sits on an ottoman<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Or, footstool.</i>. If he was a descendent of David, he may sit in the Courtyard (Azaroh) of the Temple since only kings from the House of David may sit in the Temple Courtyard, as it says, “<i>And King David came, and he sat before G-d”</i> (II Samuel 7:18, I Chronicles 17:16).",
            "The king gets his hair cut every day. He grooms himself and adorns himself in resplendent garments, as it says, “<i>your eyes shall gaze upon the king in his beauty</i>” (Isaiah 33:17). The king sits on a throne in his palace and he wears a crown on his head. The entire nation comes to him when he wants, and stands before him and bows to the ground. Even a prophet stands before the king and bows to the ground, as it says, “…<i>behold, Nathan the Prophet; and he came in before the king and bowed down to the king with his face to the ground</i>” (I Kings 1:23). However, the Kohen Godol does not appear before the king unless he<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Kohen Godol.</i> wants to nor does he stand before him. Rather, the king stands before the Kohen Godol, as it says, “<i>and he stood before Eliezer the Kohen</i>” (Numbers 27:21). Nevertheless, the Kohen Godol is commanded to honor the king, he seats him, and stands before him when he comes to him. The king should not stand before him unless he is there to ask of the Urim. The king must give honor to those who study Torah. When the Sanhedrin and the Sages of Israel enter, he must stand for them and he seats them by his side. So did Asa<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In some editions: Yehoshofat.</i> King of Judah do when he stood up from his throne for a Torah scholar and kissed him and called him “my rabbi, and my teacher”. This applies when the king is at home alone with only his servants present, and he does this and similar things privately. But in public, before the people, he does not do this. Then he stands for no one and does not speak gently and does not call any one, but by his name. This is so that reverence<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lit., awe.</i> for him will fill the hearts of all. ",
            "In the same way that Scriptures has given him great honor, and everyone is obliged to give him honor, so has he been commanded to be of a subdued and unpretentious heart, as it says, “<i>and my heart is empty within me</i>” (Psalms 109:22). He must not act overly haughty towards Israel, as it says, “<i>lest his heart become haughty over his brothers</i>” (Deut. 17:20). He must be merciful and compassionate to the small and great with regard<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lit., and deal with.</i> to their wants and welfare. He must show respect for even the lowest of the low. When he speaks to the entire Congregation together, he is to speak sensitively, as it says, “<i>listen to me my brothers and my people</i>” (I Chronicles 28:2) and “<i>and should you today be a servant to your people…</i>” (I Kings 12:7). He must always behave with extreme modesty, for we have never had anyone greater than Moses Our Teacher who said, “<i>and what are we? your complaint is not against us</i>” (Exodus 16:7-8). He must suffer their burdens and criticisms and anger, “<i>as a nursing father carries the sucking child</i>” (Num. 11:12). Scriptures calls him ‘shepherd’, “<i>To be a shepherd over Jacob His people</i>” (Psalms 78:71), and the (proper) behavior of a shepherd is as has been defined in the Tradition, as it says, “<i>As a shepherd who leads his flock, and with his arm he gathers the lambs, and in his breast he carries…</i>.” (Isaiah 40:11)."

            "When the king sits on the throne of his monarchy, he must write a Sefer Torah for himself, this in addition to the Sifrei Torah which were left for him by his forefathers. He checks his Sefer against the one<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It was an ancient Sefer Torah.</i> in the Temple Courtyard, in accordance with the Court of Seventy-One. If his forefathers did not leave him a Sefer or if it was lost, he has to write two Sifrei Torah. The first one will be kept in his Repository; this is the same Commandment which all of Israel must observe. The second one must never leave his side, other than when he goes to the lavatory or the bath or a place where it would be improper to read from it<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">e.g. a cemetery.</i>. When he goes to war, it is with him. When he returns, it is with him. When he sits in judgment, it is with him. When he eats<sup>20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lit., reclines.</i>, it is next to him, as it says, “<i>And it shall be with him, and he shall read from it all the days of his life</i>” (Deut. 17:19).",
            "<i>\"He must not have too many women\"</i> (Deut. 17:17). By Tradition we have learned that he may have up to eighteen women including wives<sup>21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Those with a marriage contract.</i> and concubines<sup>22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Those without a marriage contract.</i>. Were he to add even one and have intercourse with her, he is given stripes. He may divorce one and marry another one in her place.",
            "<i>\"He must not accumulate many horses\"</i> (Deut. 17:16), but only as many as he needs for his chariots<sup>23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For war.</i>. He may not even have one spare horse to trot before him, as is done before other kings. If he adds, he is given stripes.",
            "He must not amass too much silver and gold for his treasury in order to be proud about it or for his enjoyment. He may only have as much as he needs to pay his soldiers, servants and attendants. However, it is a Mitzvoh to increase the coffers of the Temple Treasury. Any extra silver and gold is to be ready for use for the public needs and their wars. The prohibition only forbids him from increasing his own wealth in his own treasury, as it says, “<i>and he shall not increase for himself</i>” (Deut. 17:17). He is given stripes if he increase his riches.",
            "The king must not drink himself drunk, as it says, “<i>not for kings is the drinking of wine</i>” (Proverbs 31:4). Rather, he must be engaged in Torah and the needs of Israel, day and night, as it says, “<i>and it shall be with him, and he shall read from it all the days of his life</i>” (Deut. 17:19). ",
            " Similarly, he must not be preoccupied with women. Even if he has but one (wife) he should not be found by her all the time as with the fools, and as it says, “<i>Give not your strength to women</i>” (Proverbs 31:3). Regarding the steering of his heart away, the Torah has already been exacting and said, “<i>Do not veer your heart</i>” (Deut. 17:17). For his heart is the heart of the entire Congregation of Israel. Therefore, Scriptures has attributed to him that which is written in the Torah, more so than any other member of the nation, saying, “<i>all the days of his life</i>” (Deut. 17:19).",
            "We have already explained that the kings of the House of David may judge and may be judged and testimony can be brought against them. Not so the kings of Israel regarding whom our Sages have decreed that they do not judge and are not judged, they cannot give testimony and no one can testify about them. This is because their hearts are coarse, and from these matters only fiascoes will result, and there will be a loss to the religion.",
            "The king has the right to execute anyone who rebels against a king. One is liable to the death penalty even if the king decreed that he is to go to a particular place and he did not go there or that he not leave his house and left. If he so wishes, he may execute him it says, “<i>any man who disagrees with your words</i>” (Joshua 1:18). Similarly, the king has permission to execute anyone who disgraces<sup>24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Or, embarrasses.</i> him or insults him, as was the case with Shimi ben Gera. The king has permission to execute only by the sword. He may imprison and beat someone with a whip for the sake of his honor. However, he may not declare their money ownerless, for it would be robbery were he to do so.",
            "Anyone who fails to obey the king’s orders because he is engaged in the performance of Commandments, even of one simple Commandment, is exempt. This is so since whenever a dictate of the Master (G-d) conflicts with a dictate of the servant (the king), the dictate of the Master takes precedence. Needless to say, the king is not heeded if he decrees something which cancels a Commandment.",
            "The king has the right to execute a killer, even when there is no clear proof (against him) or no warning was given him or even if there was only one witness. He may execute someone who killed accidentally out of hatred. He may do so for purposes of establishing Public Order, as is necessary depending on the prevailing circumstances. He may even execute many people on one day and hang them and leave them hanging for many days in order to instill fear and crush the hands of the wicked of the world."

            "The king has the right to levy a tax for his own needs or for wars, and to set rates for the tax. It is forbidden to avoid paying his tax. The king has the right to decree that anyone who fails to pay his taxes can have his property confiscated or he can be executed, as it says, “<i>and you shall be slaves unto him</i>” (I Samuel 8:17). Further, it says, “<i>and they shall be for you a tribute, and they shall serve you</i>” (Deut. 20:11). From here we learn that he can levy a tax and set the rates for the tax. His laws in these, and all similar matters, are binding. For the king is entitled to everything about which is written in the Chapter Regarding Kings<sup>25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 8.</i>.",
            "He can recruit and conscript, from anywhere in Israel, courageous and strong men and make them soldiers for his chariots, horsemen, and members of his guard. He can draft men who will run before him, as it says, “<i>and will appoint them for his chariots and horsemen, and they will run before his chariots</i>” (I Samuel 8:11). He can take of the handsomest ones and make them his attendants, as it says, “<i>and your best youth and your asses…he will take for his work</i>” (I Samuel 8:16).",
            "He can enlist artisans<sup>26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Or, craftsmen.</i>, any he so needs, to do his work. But, he must pay them their wages. He can draft all the animals and slaves and maid-servants he needs for his service, but he must pay their wages or pay their worth, as it says, “<i>and to plough his ploughings, and to harvest his harvests, and to make the implements of war and the tools for his chariots…and the best of your slaves and maid-servants and youth and your asses…he shall take; and they shall do his work</i>” (I Samuel 8:12-16).",
            "He can take, from anywhere in Israel, wives and concubines; wives being those with a Kesuba (marriage contract) and Kedushin (being sanctified), while concubines are those without a Kesuba and Kedushin. He need only sequester himself with her in private to make her a concubine. She is then permitted to him. However, an ordinary man is forbidden to have a concubine, but may have a Hebrew maidservant, but only after she was so designated<sup>27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To be his wife.</i>. The king makes those concubines who has brought to his palace into cooks and bakers and perfumers<sup>28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I do not know why the Rambam’s order is different than that in the verse.</i>, as it says, “<i>and your daughters he shall take for perfumers and cooks and bakers</i>” (I Samuel 8:13).",

Then, when he planned to dwell there permanently, he was not actually committing an act. It appears to me that if an Israelite king conquers Egypt with the permission of the Court, it would be permitted to live there.

If they propose to accept upon themselves the payment of the tribute but not servitude to us or they accept servitude but not the tribute, we ignore their proposal until they accept both. The servitude referred to here is one of disgrace and is demeaning. They are not to raise their heads up to Israel for any reason.

The tribute they must pay shall be for service of the king, with their bodies and their money, such as the building of the walls<sup>37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Of Jerusalem.</i> and the strengthening of fortresses and the building of the royal palace and similar, as it says, “<i>And this is the account of the levy which King Solomon raised to build the Temple of G-d, and his palace, and Milo, and the wall of Jerusalem…and all the store-cities which Solomon had…the Emorites who remained…and Solomon imposed a head-tax, until this very day.

Rather, they desired this so that they would have time for Torah and its Wisdom. And there would be no one who would oppress them or force them to be idle (from Torah).

            "At that time there will be no famines and no wars, no envy and no competition. For the Good will be very pervasive<sup>148</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Or, inspiring, affecting, influencing.</i>. All the delicacies will be as readily available as is dust. The world will only be engaged in knowing G-d<sup>149</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Compare with Rabbi S. R. Hirsch in his Nineteen Letters.</i>. Then, there will be very wise people<sup>150</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Some editions have, “Israel will be very wise”.</i> who will understand the deep, sealed matters. They will then achieve knowledge of the Creator to as high a degree as humanly possible, as it says, <i>“For the Earth shall be filled of knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea” </i>(Isaiah 11:9).<br>Blessed be Hashem who helped me."
