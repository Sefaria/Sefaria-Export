            "The Supreme Court in Jerusalem represents the essence of the Oral Torah. Its members are the pillars of direction; law and order emanate from them to all of Israel. Concerning them the Torah assures us, as it is written: \"You shall act in accordance with the directions they give you\" (Deuteronomy 17:11). This is a positive command. Anyone who believes in Moses, our teacher, and in his Torah, must relate religious practices to them and lean upon them.",
            "— — Whether their direction is based upon what they have learned from tradition, referred to as the Oral Torah, or it is derived from what they have independently discovered by means of any of the rules whereby the Torah is interpreted, and meets with their approval, or it is in the form of temporary regulations designed to preserve the biblical laws, measures consisting of decrees and ordinances and customs, we are biblically commanded to obey our sages with regard to any of these three categories. Whoever disregards one of them breaks a prohibitive command.— —",
            "There has never been dissension [among the sages] with regard to laws handed down by tradition. Anything concerning which there has been dissension is certainly not a tradition dating back to Moses, our teacher. Rules derived by rational inference, if sanctioned by all the members of the Supreme Court, are invested with authority indeed; if there is a divergence of opinion among the sages, we follow the majority and formulate the law according to the greater number. The same applies to the decrees, ordinances and customs : if some sages felt that it was appropriate to issue a decree or to enact an ordinance, or that the people should abandon a certain custom, and others felt that it was improper to issue that decree or to enact that ordinance, or that the people should not discontinue that custom, they would debate the subject and follow the majority opinion, formulating the law according to the greater number.",
            "When the Supreme Court was in existence, there was no religious dissension among the people of Israel. If doubt came to the mind of a Jew concerning any law, he consulted the court of his home town. If they knew, they told him; if not, he was joined by that court or its agents and together they went up to Jerusalem where they submitted the question to the court that was situated at the entrance of the Temple Mount. If they knew, they told him; if not, they all proceeded to the court at the entrance of the Temple Court. If they knew, they told them; if not, they all went to the Supreme Court which occupied the chamber of hewn stone, and put the question to the judges. If the law concerning which they were all in doubt was known to the Supreme Court, either from tradition or from a principle of biblical interpretation, they stated it immediately. If the members of the Supreme Court were uncertain about that specific law, they dealt with it in their own time, and debated it until they eventually reached unanimous agreement or passed the measure by vote, following the majority opinion, and told all the questioners: \"This is the law.\" And they went away. When, however, the Supreme Court ceased to exist, religious dissension increased in Israel: one scholar would declare a thing <i>unclean</i> and give a reason for his statement, while another would declare it <i>clean</i> and give a reason for his statement; one would forbid, while the other would permit.",
            "If two scholars, or two courts of law, whether contemporary or not, are in disagreement at a time when a Sanhedrin is nonexistent, or before a specific law has become clear to the Sanhedrin, follow the stringent view with regard to biblical law and the lenient view with regard to rabbinic law, if you do not know which way the law is prone."

            "The court has the power to suspend even these rules for a term even if it is lesser than the earlier court, for these [rabbinic] decrees must not be more rigorous [in their application] than Torah law. Any court has the authority to suspend the law in an emergency. How so? A court that determines that to strengthen the law/religion and to make a fence so that the masses do not violate Torah law, has the authority to flog [offenders] without warrant authorized by positive law. But they do not establish this [deflection] from positive statute in permanence and do not declare that such and such is the law. And similarly, if they [the members of the court] determine to nullify [le-batel] a positive commandment or to transgress a negative commandment in order to cause the masses to return to law/religion or to prevent the majority of Israel from stumbling [i.e., sinning] in other [similarly serious] matters, [the court] does so [suspend the positive law]. For just as the doctor amputates a limb or foot in order that a patient survives, similarly, the court rules at any time to transgress a few commandments for a term in order that the masses may one day return and fulfil [all] the commandments. Thus, any court may rule, at any time [zeman min ha-zemanim], to violate some commandments temporarily, in order to sustain them all [i.e., all of the commandments], as was commanded40 by the early sages, violate one Sabbath so that one may observe many Sabbaths.",
            "If a Supreme Court issued a decree or enacted an ordinance or introduced a custom, which has become widespread throughout Israel, and a subsequent court desires to abolish the instructions of the predecessors and to eradicate that particular ordinance, decree or custom, it cannot do so, unless it is superior both in wisdom and in number. If it exceeds the other court in wisdom but not in number, or in number but not in wisdom, it cannot annul its instructions. Even if the reason for which the predecessors introduced the decree or ordinance exists no more, the successors cannot revoke anything introduced by the predecessors unless they exceed them. But how can any Supreme Court exceed another in number when each Supreme Court consists of seventy-one members? The reference is to the number of contemporary sages who have agreed to accept the decision of the Supreme Court, or have not opposed it."

            "The rebellious elder mentioned in the Torah is indeed one of the sages of Israel, who is familiar with the traditional lore, acts as judge, and instructs in subjects of Torah, as do all the wise men of Israel; but he has disagreed with the Supreme Court on a point of law, refusing to yield to their point of view. Instead, he has opposed them and taught others to act contrary to the court's ruling. The Torah has condemned him to death, and if he confesses before being executed he has a share in the world to come. Although he argues just as well as they do, he received the traditional lore just as well as they did, yet the Torah has honored them [favoring their view]. Even if the members of the court are willing to forego their honor and leave him alone, they cannot do so, in order to prevent many dissensions in Israel.",
            "A rebellious elder is not guilty of death unless he is one of the sages of Israel, fit to render decisions, having been ordained by the Sanhedrin, and he is opposed to the court on a matter punishable by <i>kareth</i> for willful action, and by a sin-offering for action in error.— — But if he is a student who has not yet reached the stage of rendering decisions, and he has given a decision concerning what should be done, he is not liable, as it is written: \"If a case is too baffling for you to decide\" (Deuteronomy 17:8) ; that is, one who is capable of solving any problem except a superior one.",
            "If the elder is the chief scholar of the court, and he differed, imparting his views to others persistently but giving no decision concerning what should be done, he is not liable, as it is written: \"The man who acts presumptuously\" (12); not that he <i>says</i> something presumptuously, but instructs others to <i>act</i>, or himself, acts presumptuously."

            "It is a great positive precept to honor father and mother; so too, to pay reverence to father and mother. Scripture considers the duty of honoring parents and revering them equal to the duty of honoring and revering God. It is written: \"Honor your father and your mother\" (Exodus 20:12), and it is also written: \"Honor the Lord with your wealth\" (Proverbs 3:9). Concerning one's father and mother it is written: \"You shall each revere his mother and his father\" (Leviticus 19:3), and it is also written: \"Revere the Lord your God\" (Deuteronomy 6:13). Just as God commanded us to honor and revere his great Name, so he has commanded us to honor and revere our parents.",
            "",
            "What is the distinction between reverence and honor? Reverence signifies that the son must neither stand nor sit in his father's place; he must not contradict his father nor decide against him.— — What does honoring signify? The son must provide his father and mother with food and drink and clothing, paid for by the father. If the father has no money and the son has, he is compelled to maintain his father and mother as much as he can. He must manage his father's affairs, conducting him in and out, and doing for him the kind of service that is performed by servants for their master ; he should rise before him, as he should rise before his teacher.",

Even if they took a pocketful of gold pieces belonging to him and cast it into the sea right in his presence, he must not shame them or scream and be angry at them; instead, he should accept the divine decree and keep silent. To what lengths should the duty of revering them go? Even if he wore costly clothes while presiding over a public assembly, and his father and mother came and tore his clothes, struck him on the head, and spat in his face, he must not embarrass them but keep silent. He should revere and fear the supreme King of kings who has thus commanded him. Had a mortal king laid a more painful restraint on him, he would be powerless to struggle against it; so much the more if the decree comes from him who spoke and the world came into being by his will.",
            "Although we have been commanded to behave thus [generously and reverently toward our parents], a man must not impose too heavy a yoke upon his children by being too strict with them in regard to his honor, that he might not cause them to stumble; he should rather forgive and ignore, since a father may well forego the honor due him [allowing the son to omit the acts of reverence, and the son may avail himself of the permission] ; the father's honor may well be remitted.",

            "If one's father or mother has become mentally disordered, he should make an effort to behave toward them according to their state of mind until they will be shown mercy [and get cured]. But if he is unable to endure the strain any longer, because they have become utterly insane, he may leave them and go elsewhere, charging others to take proper care of them.",

            "The penalty incurred by a rebellious son, who is spoken of in the Torah, has been stated to be death by stoning. But Scripture never condemns to punishment unless it has expressed a warning. Where has it expressed that warning? It is written: \"You shall not eat anything with its blood\" (Leviticus 19:26); that is, you must not eat in a manner that induces bloodshed. This alludes to the kind of eating in which the rebellious son indulges: he is put to death only for his repulsive manner of eating, as it is written: \"He is a glutton and a drunkard\" (Deuteronomy 21:20). Traditionally interpreted, a glutton is one who eats meat voraciously; a drunkard is one who drinks wine ravenously.",
            "This eating for which he is liable is restricted by many limitations that are derived from traditional law: He does not deserve stoning unless he steals from his father and buys meat and wine cheaply [in order to have large quantities] ; or if he eats and drinks outside his father's premises in company of entirely ignorant and worthless men; eats the meat partially raw and partially cooked, the way thieves eat ; drinks the wine partially diluted, the way gobblers drink.— — If he stole from his father and ate like this in the premises of his father, or he stole from others and ate in this repulsive manner whether in his father's premises or in the premises of others, he is not liable. So too, if he stole from his father and ate in such a repulsive fashion in the premises of others, but it was in connection with the performance of a religious duty, even a rabbinic precept, or in connection with the performance of a transgression, even on rabbinic grounds, he is not liable, as it is written: \"He does not listen to our voice\" (Deuteronomy 21:20); that is, he disobeys his parents only by this eating, excluding this one who in so doing transgressed the precepts of the Torah.— —"
