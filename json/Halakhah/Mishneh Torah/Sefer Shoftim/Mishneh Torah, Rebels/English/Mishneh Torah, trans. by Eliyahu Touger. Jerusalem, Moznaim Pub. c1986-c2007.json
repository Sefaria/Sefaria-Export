            "The Supreme <i>Sanhedrin</i> in Jerusalem are the essence of the Oral Law. They are the pillars of instruction from whom statutes and judgments issue forth for the entire Jewish people. Concerning them, the Torah promises Deuteronomy 17:11: \"You shall do according to the laws which they shall instruct you....\" This is a positive commandment.<br>Whoever believes in Moses and in his Torah is obligated to make all of his religious acts dependent on this court and to rely on them.",
            "Any person who does not carry out their directives transgresses a negative commandment, as <i>Ibid.</i> continues: \"Do not deviate from any of the statements they relate to you, neither right nor left.\"<br>Lashes are not given for the violation of this prohibition, because it also serves as a warning for a transgression punishable by execution by the court. For when a sage rebels against the words of the court, he should be executed by strangulation, as the following verse states: \"A person who will act deliberately....\"<br>We are obligated to heed their words whether they:<br>a) learned them from the Oral Tradition, i.e., the Oral Law,<br>b) derived them on the basis of their own knowledge through one of the attributes of Biblical exegesis and it appeared to them that this is the correct interpretation of the matter,<br>c) instituted the matter as a safeguard for the Torah, as was necessary at a specific time. These are the decrees, edicts, and customs instituted by the Sages.<br>It is a positive commandment to heed the court with regard to each of these three matters. A person who transgresses any of these types of directives transgresses a negative commandment. This is derived from the continuation of the above verse in the following manner: \"According to the laws which they shall instruct you\" - this refers to the edicts, decrees, and customs which they instruct people at large to observe to strengthen the faith and perfect the world. \"According to the judgment which they relate\" - this refers to the matters which they derive through logical analysis employing one of the methods of Biblical exegesis. \"From all things that they will tell you\" - This refers to the tradition which they received one person from another.",
            "There can never be any difference of opinion with regard to matters received through the Oral Tradition. Whenever there arises a difference of opinion with regard to a matter that shows that it was not received in the tradition from Moses our teacher.<br>The following principles apply with regard to matters derived through logical analysis. If the entire body of the Supreme <i>Sanhedrin</i> agrees with regard to them, their consent is binding. If there is a difference of opinion, we follow the majority and decide the matter according to the majority. Similarly, with regard to the decrees, edicts, and customs, if a portion of the judges perceived that it was necessary to issue a decree, institute an edict, or establish a custom for the people, and a portion perceived that it is not appropriate to issue this decree, institute this edict, or establish this custom, the judges should debate the matter back and forth. Afterwards, a vote is called, and we follow the majority and execute the matter according to the decision of the majority.",
            "When the Supreme <i>Sanhedrin</i> was in session, there was never any prolonged differences of opinion among the Jewish people. Instead, if a doubt arose in a Jew's mind over any law, he would inquire of the court in his city. If not, the questioner and that court - or its agents - ascend to Jerusalem and ask the court which holds sessions on the Temple Mount. If they know, they will reply to him, if they do not know, everyone comes to the court that holds sessions at the entrance to the Temple Courtyard. If they know, they will reply to him, if they do not know, everyone comes to the Chamber of Hewn Stone, to the Supreme <i>Sanhedrin</i>, and presents the question. If the matter that was unresolved by all the others was known to the Supreme <i>Sanhedrin</i> - either as part of the Oral Tradition or because of its derivation through the principles of exegesis - they relate the decision immediately. If, however, the decision was unclear to the Supreme <i>Sanhedrin</i>, they deliberate about the matter at that time and debate it back and forth until they reach a uniform decision, or until a vote is taken. In such a situation, they follow the majority and then tell all the questioners: \"This is the halachah.\" The questioners then all depart.<br>After the Supreme <i>Sanhedrin</i> was nullified, differences of opinion multiplied among the Jewish people. One would rule an article is impure and support his ruling with a rationale and another would rule that it is pure and support his ruling with a rationale. This one would rule an article is forbidden and this would rule that it is permitted.",
            "The following rules apply when there are two sages or two courts that have differing opinions in an age when there was no Supreme <i>Sanhedrin</i> or during the time when the Supreme <i>Sanhedrin</i> was still undecided concerning the matter - whether in one age or in two different ages - one rules that an article is pure and one rules that it is impure, one forbids an article's use and one permits it. If one does not know in which direction the law tends, should the matter involve a question of Scriptural Law, follow the more severe opinion. If it involve a question of Rabbinic Law, follow the more lenient opinion."
        ],
        [
            "When, using one of the principles of exegesis, the Supreme <i>Sanhedrin</i> derived a law through their perception of the matter and adjudicated a case accordingly, and afterwards, another court arose and they perceived another rationale on which basis, they would revoke the previous ruling, they may revoke it and rule according to their perception. This is reflected by Deuteronomy 17:9: \"To the judge who will be in that age.\" This indicates that a person is obligated to follow only the court in his own generation.",
            "The following rules apply when a court issued a decree, instituted an edict, or established a custom and this practice spread throughout the Jewish people and another court arose and sought to nullify the original order and eliminate the original edict, decree, or custom. The later court does not have this authority unless it surpasses the original court in wisdom and in its number of adherents. If it surpasses the original court in wisdom, but not in the number of adherents, or in the number of adherents, but not in wisdom, it cannot nullify its statements. Even if the rationale for which the original court instituted the decree or the edict is nullified, the later court does not have the authority to negate their statements unless they are greater.<br>How is it possible that the later court will surpass the original court in number? For every Supreme <i>Sanhedrin</i> consists of 71 judges. The intent is the number of sages in the generation who consent and accept the matter stated by the Supreme <i>Sanhedrin</i> without opposing it.",
            "When does the above apply? With regard to matters that were not forbidden to create a safeguard for the words of the Torah, but rather resemble other Torah laws. A different principle applies, by contrast, with regard to matters which the court sought necessary to issue a decree and create a prohibition as a safeguard. If the prohibition spread throughout the Jewish people, another Supreme <i>Sanhedrin</i> does not have the authority to uproot the decree and grant license even if it was of greater stature than the original court.",
            "A court may, however, suspend the application of such decrees temporarily, even if it is of lesser stature than the original court. The rationale is that these decrees should not be considered as more severe than the words of the Torah itself, and any court has the authority to abrogate the words of the Torah as a temporary measure.<br>What is implied? If a court sees that it is necessary to strengthen the faith and create a safeguard so that the people will not violate Torah law, they may apply beatings and punishments that are not sanctioned by Torah. They may not, however, establish the matter for posterity and say that this is the halachah.<br>Similarly, if they saw that temporarily it was necessary to nullify a positive commandment or violate a negative commandment in order to bring people at large back to the Jewish faith or to prevent many Jews from transgressing in other matters, they may do what is necessary at that time. To explain by analogy: Just like a doctor may amputate a person's hand or foot so that the person as a whole will live; so, too, at times, the court may rule to temporarily violate some of the commandments so that they will later keep all of them. In this vein, the Sages of the previous generations said: \"Desecrate one Sabbath for a person's sake so that he will keep many Sabbaths.\"",
            "When a court sees it necessary to issue a decree, institute an edict, or establish a custom, they must first contemplate the matter and see whether or not the majority of the community can uphold the practice. We never issue a decree on the community unless the majority of the community can uphold the practice.",
            "If a court issued a decree, thinking that the majority of the community could uphold it and after the decree was issued, the majority of the community raised contentions and the practice did not spread throughout the majority of the community, the decree is nullified. The court cannot compel the people to accept it.",
            "Sages issued a decree and thought that it spread among the entire Jewish people and the situation remained unchanged for many years. After a long duration of time, another court arose and checked throughout the Jewish community and saw that the observance of this decree had not spread throughout the Jewish community, it has the authority to negate the decree even if it is of lesser stature than the original court in wisdom and in number of adherents.",
            "Whenever a court releases two decrees, it should not rush to release a third decree.",
            "A court has the authority to issue a decree and forbid something which is permitted and have its decree perpetuated for generations to come. Similarly, it has the authority - as a temporary measure - to release the Torah's prohibitions. What then is the meaning of the Scriptural prohibitions Deuteronomy 13:1: \"Do not add to it and do not detract from it\"?<br>The intent is that they do not have the authority to add to the words of the Torah or to detract from them, establishing a matter forever as part of Scriptural Law. This applies both to the Written Law and the Oral Law.<br>What is implied? The Torah states Exodus 23:19: \"Do not cook a kid in its mother's milk.\" According to the Oral Tradition, we learned that the Torah forbade both the cooking and eating of milk and meat, whether the meat of a domesticated animal or the meat of a wild beast. The meat of fowl, by contrast, is permitted to be cooked in milk according to Scriptural Law. Now if a court will come and permit partaking of the meat of a wild animal cooked in milk, it is detracting from the Torah. And if it forbids the meat of fowl cooked in milk saying that this is included in \"the kid\" forbidden by the Scriptural Law, it is adding to the Torah.<br>If, however, the court says: \"The meat of fowl cooked in milk is permitted according to Scriptural Law. We, however, are prohibiting it and publicizing the prohibition as a decree, lest the matter lead to a detriment and people say: 'Eating the meat of fowl cooked in milk is permitted, because it is not explicitly forbidden by the Torah. Similarly, the meat of a wild animal cooked in milk is permitted, because it is also not explicitly forbidden.' \"And another may come and say: 'Even the meat of a domesticated animal cooked in milk is permitted with the exception of a goat.' And another will come and say: 'Even the meat of a goat is permitted when cooked in the milk of a cow or a sheep. For the verse mentions only \"its mother,\" i.e., an animal from the same species.' And still another will come and say: 'Even the meat of a goat is permitted when cooked in goat's milk as long the milk is not from the kid's mother, for the verse says: \"its mother.\"' For these reasons, we will forbid all meat cooked in milk, even meat from fowl.\"<br>Such an approach is not adding to the Torah. Instead, it is creating safeguards for the Torah. Similar concepts apply in all analogous situations."

            "A person who does not acknowledge validity of the Oral Law is not the rebellious elder mentioned in the Torah. Instead, he is one of the heretics and he should be put to death by any person.",
            "Since it has become known that such a person denies the Oral Law, he may be pushed into a pit and may not be helped out. He is like all the rest of the heretics who say that the Torah is not Divine in origin, those who inform on their fellow Jews, and the apostates. All of these are not considered as members of the Jewish people. There is no need for witnesses, a warning, or judges for them to be executed. Instead, whoever kills them performs a great mitzvah and removes an obstacle from people at large.",
            "To whom does the above apply? To a person who denied the Oral Law consciously, according to his perception of things. He follows after his frivolous thoughts and his capricious heart and denies the Oral Law first, as did Tzadok and Beitus and those who erred in following them.<br>The children of these errant people and their grandchildren whose parents led them away and they were born among these Karaities and raised according to their conception, they are considered as a children captured and raised by them. Such a child may not be eager to follow the path of mitzvot, for it is as if he was compelled not to. Even if later, he hears that he is Jewish and saw Jews and their faith, he is still considered as one who was compelled against observance, for he was raised according to their mistaken path. This applies to those who we mentioned who follow the erroneous Karaite path of their ancestors. Therefore it is appropriate to motivate them to repent and draw them to the power of the Torah with words of peace.",
            "The \"rebellious elder\" mentioned in the Torah, by contrast, is one of the sages of Israel who has received the tradition from previous sages and who analyzes and issues ruling with regard to the words of Torah as do all the sages of Israel. His rebellion involves an instance when he has a difference of opinion in one of the Torah's laws with the Supreme <i>Sanhedrin</i> and did not accept their views, but instead issued a ruling to act in a different manner. The Torah decreed that he should be executed. He should confess his sin before being executed so that he will be granted a portion in the world to come.<br>Even though he analyzes and they analyze; he received the tradition and they received the tradition, the Torah granted them deference. Even if the court desires to forgo their honor and allow him to live, they are not allowed so that differences of opinion will not arise within Israel.",
            "A \"rebellious elder\" is not liable for execution unless he is a sage, erudite enough to issue halachic judgments who has received <i>semichah</i> from the <i>Sanhedrin</i> and who differs with that court with regard to a matter whose willful violation is punishable by <i>kerait</i> and whose inadvertent violation requires a sin offering or with regard to <i>tefillin</i>. He must direct others to act according to his ruling or act according to his ruling himself, and differ with the <i>Sanhedrin</i> while they hold session in the Chamber of Hewn Stone.<br>When, by contrast, a student who has not attained a level of erudition that enables him to issue halachic rulings, but, nevertheless, issues a ruling, he is not liable. This is derived from Deuteronomy 17:8 which states: \"If a matter of judgment exceeds your grasp....\" Implied is that the passage concerns only a scholar who is unable to grasp something which is exceedingly difficult to comprehend.",
            "If a sage was an exceedingly great scholar and a member of a court and differed with [the Supreme Sanhedrin] and he returned home and taught others according to his [original] conception, but did not direct them to act accordingly, he is not liable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The classic example of this principle is Akkavya ben Mahallel who received four teachings from his teachers which - though they represented the majority views at that time - were not accepted by the majority of the Sages in the following generation. Akkavya refused to change his conception of these laws, and yet, in deference to the majority, did not issue rulings for action according to his conception. Moreover, before his passing, he advised his son to accept the ruling of the majority (Ediot 5:6-7; Sanhedrin 88a)</i> [This is derived from ibid.:12 which] states: “And the person who acts obstinately”; [i.e., the punishment is warranted] not for speaking obstinately, but for issuing a directive for action or for acting oneself.",
            "If he found the Supreme <i>Sanhedrin</i> outside their place and rebelled against their ruling, he is not liable. This is derived from <i>ibid.</i>:8 which states: \"And you shall arise and ascend to that place,\" implied is that the place is the cause for capital punishment.<br>All of the individuals mentioned above who are not executed and anyone who acts in a similar manner, although they are not liable for execution, the Supreme <i>Sanhedrin</i> should place them under a ban of ostracism, separate them from the community, subject them to corporal punishment, and prevent them from teaching their interpretation of the matter.",
            "How is the law applying to a rebellious elder adjudicated? When a matter is undecided because of its difficulty and a sage who is erudite enough to issue rulings whether with regard to a matter which he arrived at through his own reasoning or which he received from his teachers. He and the sages who differ with him ascend to Jerusalem and come to the court which holds sessions at the entrance to the Temple Mount.<br>The court tells them: \"This is the law.\" If the elder listens and accepts the ruling, it is desirable. If not, they all go to the court which holds sessions at the entrance to the Temple Courtyard. They also say: \"This is the law.\" If the elder listens and accepts the ruling, they go their ways. If not, they all go to the Supreme <i>Sanhedrin</i> in the Chamber of Hewn Stone from which the Torah emanates to the entire Jewish people, as Deuteronomy 17:10 states: \"From that place which God has chosen.\" The Supreme <i>Sanhedrin</i> tell them: \"This is the law\" and they all depart.<br>If the elder returns to his city and continues to interpret the law as he did previously and teaches this interpretation to others, he is not liable. If he gave a directive for action or acted according to his conception himself, he is liable for execution. There is no need for a warning. Even if he offers a rationale to explain his conduct, we do not heed him. Instead, once witnesses come and testify that he acted according to his own directive or that he directed others to perform a deed, we sentence him to death in his local court. We take hold of him and bring him from that place to Jerusalem. For we do not execute him in the presence of his local court, nor in the presence of the Supreme <i>Sanhedrin</i> who left Jerusalem, but instead, bring him to the Supreme <i>Sanhedrin</i> in Jerusalem. Until the next pilgrimage festival, he is kept under watch. During the pilgrimage festival, he is executed by strangulation, as implied by <i>ibid.</i>:13: \"And all Israel shall hear and become fearful.\" This indicates that his execution must be announced.<br>There are four transgressors whose execution must be announced publicly: a rebellious elder, lying witnesses, a person who entices others to worship idols, and a wayward and rebellious son. For with regard to all of them, the Torah states: \"so that they will hear and become afraid.\""

            "A rebellious elder who differed with the Supreme <i>Sanhedrin</i> concerning a matter whose willful violation is punishable by <i>kerait</i> and whose inadvertent violation requires a sin offering is liable for execution. This applies whether the court forbids the matter and he permits it or the court permits the matter and he forbids it. Even if he bases his statements on the received tradition, saying: \"This is the tradition I received from my masters,\" and they say: \"This is what appears to us as appropriate on the basis of logical analysis,\" since he differs with their ruling and performs a deed or directs others to do so, he is liable. Needless to say, this applies if they also rule on the basis of their having received teachings through the Oral Tradition.<br>Similarly, he is liable for execution if he differs with them with regard to a decree that they issued to safeguard a prohibition whose willful violation is punishable by <i>kerait</i> and whose inadvertent violation requires a sin offering is liable for execution. For example, if he permits the consumption of leaven on the fourteenth of Nissan during the sixth hour or forbids deriving benefit from it in the fifth hour, he is worthy of execution. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.",
            "The above applies whether the rebellious elder disputes a matter whose willful violation is punishable by <i>kerait</i> and whose inadvertent violation requires a sin offering or he disputes a matter which leads to a situation involving a prohibition whose willful violation is punishable by <i>kerait</i> and whose inadvertent violation requires a sin offering.<br>What is implied? If they disputed whether relations with a woman are adulterous or incestuous, if a shade of blood would render a woman ritually impure or not, if a woman is impure because of birth or not, if a woman is a <i>zavah</i> or not, if this fat is forbidden or permitted and the like, their difference of opinion involves a prohibition whose willful violation is punishable by <i>kerait</i> and whose inadvertent violation requires a sin offering.<br>What is meant by a matter that will lead to a prohibition whose willful violation is punishable by <i>kerait</i> and whose inadvertent violation requires a sin offering. For example, the Sages differed concerning the declaration of a leap year, if the leap year must be declared before Purim or may be declared throughout Adar, he is liable. For this leads to partaking of <i>chametz</i> on Pesach. Similarly, if they differed with regard to a matter of financial law or with regard to the number of judges able to adjudicate matters of financial law, he is liable. For according to the opinion which maintains that the defendant is liable to the plaintiff, everything which he expropriated from him was expropriated according to law and according to the decisions of the court. But according to the opposing view, whatever he expropriated is stolen property. If he uses it to consecrate a woman, she is not consecrated. And yet according to the opinion that the person expropriated his own property, the consecration is valid. If another person engages in relations with her willfully, he is liable for <i>kerait</i> and if he engages in relations with her inadvertently, he is liable to bring a sin offering. Thus their difference of opinion led to a matter whose willful violation is punishable by <i>kerait</i> and whose inadvertent violation requires a sin offering.<br>Similarly, if their difference of opinion concerned lashes, if one person was liable to receive lashes or not, or they differed with regard to the number of judges in whose presence lashes must be administered, he is liable. For according to the opinion who says that he should not be lashed, the court is injuring him and the judges are liable to make financial restitution. Anything expropriated from them is taken according to law. But according to the opinion which says that he is liable for lashes, everything he expropriates from them is stolen property. If he uses it to consecrate a woman, she is not consecrated.<br>Similarly, if they differed with regard to whether or not a person is obligated to pay after making an endowment evaluations or interdicted property, he is liable. For according to the opinion that says that he is not liable to pay, if it is taken from him, it is stolen property and if it is used to consecrate a woman, the consecration is not valid.<br>Similarly, he is liable if he differed with the majority concerning the redemption of consecrated property, had they been redeemed or not. For according to the opinion that the redemption is invalid, if he used that article to consecrate a woman, the consecration is not valid.<br>Similarly, if they differed with regard to bringing an <i>eglah arufah</i>, whether a city is obligated to bring or not, he is liable. For according to those who say that city is obligated to bring the calf, it is forbidden to derive benefit from it and if he uses it to consecrate a woman, the consecration is not valid. Similar concepts apply if they differed with regard to <i>orlah</i>. And similar concepts apply with regard to <i>leket,</i> <i>shichechah</i>, and <i>pe'ah</i>, if they differ whether it belongs to the poor or to the owner, he is liable. For according to the opinion which says that it belongs to the owner, it is stolen property in the hands of the poor and if one consecrates a woman with it, she is not consecrated.<br>Similarly, if the rebellious elder differs with the court with regard to a category of factors that impart ritual impurity, e.g., blemishes on the skin, blemishes on homes, or blemishes on garments, he is liable. For according to the opinion that the person is pure, he is permitted to enter the Temple and partake of consecrated foods, but according to the opinion that he is impure, if he enters the Temple or partakes of consecrated food willfully, he is punishable by <i>kerait</i>, and if he does so inadvertently, he is liable for a sin offering. Similar concepts apply if they differed with regard to the purification of a person afflicted by <i>tzara'at</i>, if he can be purified or not.<br>Similarly, he is liable if they differ with regard to the obligation to make a <i>sotah</i> drink the water which conveys the curse: Is a woman required to drink the water or is she not required? For according to the person who says that she must drink, if her husband dies before she drinks, she is forbidden to her <i>yevam</i>, while according to the person who says that she is not required to drink, she may perform the rite of <i>yibbum</i>. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.<br>It is necessary to investigate and examine whether a difference of opinion will lead to these consequences. If it will lead to another consequence - which after a series of even 100 consequences - that will bring about a situation involving a prohibition whose willful violation is punishable by <i>kerait</i> and whose inadvertent violation requires a sin offering, the rebellious elder is liable. This applies regardless of whether he ruled leniently and the others ruled stringently or he ruled stringently and they ruled leniently.",
            "If the difference of opinion between the rebellious elder and the court will not lead to such a situation, the rebellious elder is not liable for execution unless the difference of opinion concerns <i>tefillin</i>.<br>What is implied? If the rebellious elder gave a directive to add a fifth compartment to <i>tefillin</i> or he himself made <i>tefillin</i> with five compartment, he is liable. This applies provided he first made four compartments as required by law and then made a fifth compartment and attached it to the outer compartment. For when an outer compartment is not exposed to the open space at all times, it is unacceptable.<br>The obligation of a rebellious elder in such a matter is a law transmitted by the Oral Tradition. If, however, they differed with regard to other mitzvot, e.g., he disputed one of the laws concerning a <i>lulav, tzitzit</i>, or a <i>shofar</i>, one claiming that it is unacceptable and the other claiming that it is acceptable, one claiming that the person fulfilled his obligation and the other claiming he did not fulfill his obligation, or one says: \"He is pure,\" and the other says: \"He is impure two degrees removed,\" the elder is not liable for execution.

Exodus 20:12 states: \"Honor your father and your mother,\" and Proverbs 3:9 states: \"Honor God from your wealth.\" Similarly, with regard to one's father and mother, Leviticus 19:3 states: \"A person must fear his mother and father,\" and Deuteronomy 6:13 states: \"And you shall fear God, your Lord.\" Just as He commands us to honor and fear His great name; so, too, He commands us to honor and fear our parents.\"",

With regard to the names which people are generally called, by contrast, e.g., Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, and the like, one can call others by that name in any language and at any time outside his father's presence without thinking anything of the matter.<br>What is meant by honoring them? One should bring them food and drink, clothe them and cover them from their resources.

            "It is explicitly stated that the wayward and rebellious son described in the Torah should be stoned to death. Now the Torah does not administer a punishment unless a warning was issued first. Where was the warning issued? In Leviticus 19:26: \"Do not eat upon the blood,\" which can be interpreted to mean: \"Do not partake of food that will lead to the shedding of blood.\" This refers to the meal eaten by the wayward and rebellious son who is executed only because of the hateful feast of which he partook as Deuteronomy 21:20 states: \"He is gluttonous and a lush.\" According to the Oral Tradition, we learned that this was interpreted to mean that he ate meat and drank wine in a ravenous manner.",
            "There are many particulars involved in the meal for which he is liable for eating. All of these are conveyed by the Oral Tradition. He is not liable for stoning until he steals from his father and buys meat and wine at a cheap price. He must then eat it outside his father's domain, together with a group that are all empty and base. He must eat meat that is raw, but not entirely raw, cooked but not entirely cooked, as is the practice of thieves. He must drink the wine as it is thinned as the alcoholics drink. He must eat a quantity of meat weighing 50 <i>dinarim</i> in one sitting, and drink half a <i>log</i> of this wine at one time.<br>If he stole from his father and partook of such a meal inside his father's domain, or stole from others and partook of this hateful meal in his father's domain or in another's domain, he is not liable. If the meal involves a mitzvah, even a mitzvah of Rabbinic origin, or the meal involves a transgression, even a transgression of Rabbinic origin, he is not liable. This may be inferred from the phrase (<i>Ibid.</i>): \"He does not heed our voice\"; i.e., through eating this meal, he violates only his parents' command. This excludes one who through this meal violates the words of the Torah or who partakes of it for the sake of a mitzvah.<br>What is implied? If he partook of such a hateful meal together with a wicked company for the sake of a mitzvah, or he partook of the second tithe in Jerusalem, even if they eat a meal comforting the bereaved which is a mitzvah of Rabbinic origin, he is not liable. Similarly, if he ate meat from animals that were not ritually slaughtered or which were <i>trefe</i>, teeming animals or crawling animals, and even if he ate on a communal fast day, a transgression of Rabbinic origin, he is not liable for execution.",
            "If he partook of any type of food, but did not partake of meat, even if he partook of fowl, he is not liable. If he partook of this meal from meat, but reached the sum of 50 <i>dinarim</i> by including fowl, he is liable. If he drank other beverages, but did not drink wine, he is not liable.",
            "When he ate raw meat and undiluted wine, he is not liable. The rationale is that this is an occasional occurrence and not something that a person will be drawn after. Similarly, if he ate this meal of salted meat on the third day after it was salted, or drank fresh grape juice, he is not liable. For a person will not be drawn after such matters.",
            "For this transgression, the Torah does not punish a child who has not come to the age where he is responsible for the observance of mitzvot. Similarly, a man who has matured and is independent is not stoned to death, because he ate and drank such a hateful meal.<br>What is implied? According to the Oral Tradition, we learned that this law concerns a youth of thirteen between the time he grew two pubic hairs and the time at which his entire male organ is surrounded by pubic hair. After the entire male organ is surrounded by pubic hair, he is considered as independent and is not executed by stoning.",
            "The entire period for which a \"wayward and rebellious son\" is liable is only three months from the time he manifests signs of physical maturity. For it is possible that his wife will conceive and her fetus will be recognizable within three months. This is derived from Deuteronomy 21:18: \"If a person will have a wayward and rebellious son...\"; a son, and not a \"wayward and rebellious father.\"<br>Thus one may conclude that if one's pubic hair surrounds the entire organ before the three months are completed, he is not liable.",
            "How is the judgment of a \"wayward and rebellious son\" adjudicated? First, his father and mother bring him to a court of three judges and tell them: \"Our son is wayward and rebellious.\" They bring two witnesses who testify that he stole from his father and bought meat and wine with what he stole and partook of the meal described above after being warned. This is the first testimony.<br>He receives lashes as are administered to all of those who are obligated to be lashed, as Deuteronomy 21:20 states: \"they chastise him, but he does not heed them.\" Should he steal from his father a second time and partake of such a meal, his father and mother bring him to a court of 23 judges. They bring two witnesses who testify that he stole and partook of this meal after being warned. This is the second testimony. It is acceptable if the first two witnesses also deliver the latter testimony.<br>After their testimony is heard, the youth is examined to see if his pubic hair surrounded his entire male organ. If that is not the case and it is not three months after he became thirteen, he complete the judgment against him as is done with all those executed by the court and he is stoned to death. He is not stoned to death unless the three judges who originally sentenced him to be lashed are present.

If he fled after he was sentenced, even if he grows old, whenever he is discovered, he should be stoned to death. For whenever a person has been sentenced to death, it is as if he has already been slain and he has no blood.",
            "If his father desires to convict him and his mother does not desire, or his mother desires and his father does not desire, he is not judged as a \"wayward and rebellious son,\" as implied by Deuteronomy 21:19: \"His father and mother shall take hold of him.\"<br>If one of the parents has had his arm amputated, was lame, dumb, blind, or deaf, the son is not judged as a \"wayward and rebellious son.\" These concepts are derived as follows: \"His father and mother shall take hold of him\" - This excludes parents with amputated arms\" \"And bring him out\" - this excludes the lame. \"They say\" - this excludes the dumb. \"This son of ours\" - This excludes the blind. \"He does not heed our voice\" - This excludes the dumb.",
            "There is a Scriptural decree that a \"wayward and rebellious son\" should be stoned to death. A daughter, by contrast, is not judged in this manner. The rationale is that she does not have the tendency to become habituated to eating and drinking. For this reason, the Torah states: \"A son,\" i.e., and not a daughter. A <i>tumtum</i> and an <i>adrogynus</i> are also excluded.",
            "When an operation is performed on a <i>tumtum</i> and it is discovered that he is a male, he is not judged as a \"wayward and rebellious son.\" The rationale is Deuteronomy 21:18 states: \"If a person will have a wayward and rebellious son....\" Implied is that he must be a son at the time he receives the warning.",
            "An announcement must be made concerning the execution of a \"wayward and rebellious son.\" What type of announcement is made? A declaration is written and sent to the entire Jewish people: \"In this-and-this court, we stoned so-and-so because he was a \"wayward and rebellious son.'",
            "A \"wayward and rebellious son\" is like all others executed by the court; their estate is inherited by their heirs. Even though the person's father caused him to be stoned to death, the father inherits all of his possessions.<br>Blessed be God who grants assistance."
