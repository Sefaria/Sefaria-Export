            "It is a positive Scriptural commandment to appoint judges and enforcement officers in every city and in every region, as Deuteronomy 16:18 states: \"Appoint judges and enforcement officers in all your gates.\"<br>\"Judges\" refers to magistrates whose attendance is fixed in court, before whom the litigants appear. \"Enforcement officers\" refers to those equipped with a billet and a lash who stand before the judges and patrol the market places and the streets to inspect the stores and to regulate the prices and the measures. They inflict corporal punishment on all offenders. Their deeds are controlled entirely by the judges.<br>Whenever a person is seen perpetrating injustice, they should bring his to the court, where he will be judged according to his wickedness.",
            "We are obligated to appoint courts in every region and in every city only in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. In the diaspora, by contrast, we are not obligated to appoint courts in every region. This is derived from the continuation of the above verse: \"Appoint...in all your gates which God your Lord is giving you for your tribes.\"",
            "How many established courts should there be among the Jewish people and how many judges should there be in each court?<br>First, a supreme court is established in the Temple. This is called the Great <i>Sanhedrin</i>. It was composed of 71 judges. This is derived from Numbers 11:16 which states: \"Gather for Me seventy men from the elders of Israel.\" And Moses presided over them, as the verse continues: \"And they shall stand there with you.\" Thus there are 71.<br>The one who is of greatest knowledge is placed as the head over them. He acts as the <i>Rosh Yeshivah</i>. And he is called the <i>nasi</i> by the Sages in all sources. He assumes the position of Moses our teacher.<br>The greatest among the remaining 70 is appointed as an assistant to the head. He sits at his right and is called <i>av beit din</i>. The remaining judges from the 70 sit before them and are seated according to their age and according to their stature. Whoever possesses greater wisdom than his colleague is seated closer than his colleagues to the <i>nasi</i> on his left. The members of the <i>Sanhedrin</i> sit in a semi-circle so that the <i>nasi</i> and the <i>av beit din</i> can see all of them.<br>In addition, two courts of 23 judges each are appointed. One holds sessions at the entrance to the Temple courtyard. and the other at the entrance to the Temple Mount.<br>In addition, in every city in Israel in which their are 120 or more adult males, we appoint a minor <i>Sanhedrin</i>. They hold court at the entrance to the city, as implied by Amos 5:15: \"And you shall present judgment in your gates.\" How many judges should be in such a court? 23. The one who possesses the greatest wisdom is the chief justice and the remainder sit in a semi-circle so that the chief justice can see all of them.",
            "When there are less than 120 adult males in a city, we appoint a court of three judges. For a court should never be less than three. In that way, there will be a majority and a minority if there is a difference of opinion in any particular judgment.",
            "When a city does not possess two sages of great knowledge - 0ne fit to teach and issue rulings with regard to the entire Torah and one who knows how to listen diligently and knows how to raise questions and arrive at solutions - a court should not be appointed for it even though thousands of Jews live there.",
            "When a court has two judges of this caliber: one capable of listening with regard to the entire Torah, and one capable of expounding, it is a valid court. If there are three, it is of intermediate esteem. If the court possess four judges who can expound upon the entire Torah, it is a wise court.",
            "We sit three rows of Torah scholars before every minor <i>Sanhedrin</i>. In each row, there are 23 men. The first row is seated next to the <i>Sanhedrin</i>, the second row below it, and the third row below it. In each row, the scholars are seated in the order of their level of wisdom.",
            "If there is a difference of opinion among the judges and it is necessary to grant <i>semichah</i> to one student to add to the number, the scholar of the greatest stature from the first row is granted <i>semichah</i>. The first scholar in the second row advances and sits in the first row to make up for the lack, and the first scholar in the third row advances and sits in the second row to make up for the lack. One of the remaining people is chosen and is seated in the third row. Similarly, if they must grant <i>semichah</i> to a second or third judge, they follow this pattern.",
            "Whenever a <i>Sanhedrin</i> functions, two legal scribes should stand before them: one at the right and one at the left. One writes the arguments of those who seek to hold the defendant liable, and one writes the arguments of those who seek to exonerate him.",
            "Why is a <i>Sanhedrin</i> appointed only in a city with a population of 120? So that there will be a <i>Sanhedrin</i> of 23 judges, three rows of 23 students each, ten sitters in the synagogue, two scribes, two court officers, two litigants, two witnesses, two witnesses who seek to invalidate the testimony of the witnesses, two witnesses who seek to invalidate the testimony of the second pair of witnesses and restore the validity of the first, two charity collectors, and a third to distribute these collections, a doctor who is a bloodletter, a scribe, and a teacher for young children. This reaches a total of 120."

            "We appoint to a <i>Sanhedrin</i> - both to the Supreme <i>Sanhedrin</i> and to a minor <i>Sanhedrin</i> - only men of wisdom and understanding, of unique distinction in their knowledge of the Torah and who possess a broad intellectual potential. They should also have some knowledge concerning other intellectual disciplines, e.g., medicine, mathematics, the fixation of the calendar, astronomy, astrology, and also the practices of fortune-telling, magic, sorcery, and the hollow teachings of idolatry, so that they will know how to judge them.<br>We appoint to the <i>Sanhedrin</i> only priests, Levites, and Israelites of lineage of fine repute who can marry into the priesthood. This is derived from Number 11:16: \"And they shall stand there with you.\" Implied is that they should resemble you, Moses in wisdom, the fear of heaven, and in lineage.",
            "It is a mitzvah for there to be priests and Levites in the Supreme <i>Sanhedrin</i>, as Deuteronomy 17:9 states: \"And you shall come to the priests and to the Levites. If appropriate ones are not found, it is permissible for all the judges to be Israelites.",
            "We should not appoint to a <i>Sanhedrin</i> a man of very old age or one who does not possess male physical attributes, for they possess the trait of cruelty, nor a man who is childless, so that the judges should be merciful.",
            "A king of Israel may not be included in the <i>Sanhedrin</i>, for we are forbidden to disagree with him and repudiate his words. The High Priest, by contrast, may be included in the <i>Sanhedrin</i> if his knowledge makes him fitting.",
            "Although the kings of the House of David may not be included in the <i>Sanhedrin</i>, they may sit in judgment over the people. Conversely, they may be called to judgment if a person has a complaint against them. The Kings of Israel, by contrast, may not serve as judges, nor may they be called to judgment. The rationale is that they do not humble themselves before the words of the Torah, and letting them serve as a judge or issuing a judgment against them may lead to a disaster.",
            "Just as the judges of a court must be on the highest level of righteousness; so, too, must they be unsullied by any physical blemishes.<br>An effort should be made that they all be white-haired, of impressive height, of dignified appearance, men who understand whispered matters, who understand many different languages so that the <i>Sanhedrin</i> will not need to hear testimony from an interpreter.",
            "We are not careful to demand that a judge for a court of three possess all these qualities. He must, however, possess seven attributes: wisdom, humility, the fear of God, a loathing for money, a love for truth; he must be a person who is beloved by people at large, and must have a good reputation.<br>All of these qualities are mentioned explicitly in the Torah. When relating Moses' statements concerning the appointment of judges, Deuteronomy 1:13 mentions: \"Men of wisdom and understanding.\" This refers to wisdom.<br>The verse continues: \"Beloved by your tribes.\" This refers to those who are appreciated by people at large. What will make them beloved by people? Conducting themselves with a favorable eye and a humble spirit, being good company, and speaking and conducting their business with people gently.<br>When relating Jethro's advice to Moses to appoint judges, Exodus 18:21 speaks of \"men of power.\" This refers to people who are mighty in their observance of the mitzvot, who are very demanding of themselves, and who overcome their evil inclination until they possess no unfavorable qualities, no trace of an unpleasant reputation, even during their early manhood, they were spoken of highly. The phrase \"men of power\" also implies that they should have a courageous heart to save an oppressed person from the one oppressing him, as Exodus 18:21 continues: \"God-fearing\" - the intent is obvious. It mentions: \"men who hate profit,\" i.e., people who do not become overly concerned even about their own money. They do not pursue the accumulation of money, for anyone who is overly concerned about wealth will ultimately be overcome by want.<br>The verse continues: \"men of truth,\" i.e., people who pursue justice because of their own inclination; they love truth, hate crime, and flee from all forms of crookedness.",
            "Our Sages relate: From the Supreme <i>Sanhedrin</i>, they would send emissaries throughout the entire land of Israel to seek out judges. Whenever they found a person who was wise, sin-fearing, humble, modest, with a good reputation, and beloved by people at large, they have him appointed as a judge in his own city. From there, they promote him to the court which holds sessions at the entrance to the Temple Mount. From there, he is promoted to the court which holds sessions at the entrance to the Temple Courtyard, and from there, to the Supreme <i>Sanhedrin</i>.",
            "When one of the judges of a court of three is a convert, the court is disqualified. His mother must be a native-born Jewess. If, by contrast, one of the judges is a <i>mamzer</i>, even if all three of them are <i>mamzerim</i>, they are acceptable to pass judgment.<br>Similarly, if all of the members of a court of three were blind in one eye, it is acceptable. This does not apply with regard to a <i>Sanhedrin</i>. If, however, a judge is blind in both eyes, he is unacceptable to serve on all courts.",
            "Although a court requires no less than three judges, it is permissible for one judge to adjudicate a case according to Scriptural Law, as Leviticus 19:15 states: \"Judge your fellow countryman with righteousness.\" According to Rabbinic Law, however, there should be three judges. When two judges adjudicate a case, their ruling is not binding.",
            "When a judge is an expert and he is known by many to possess such knowledge or if he was granted permission by the court, he may adjudicate a case alone. Nevertheless, he is not considered as a court.<br>Even though it is permitted for such a person to issue judgments alone, it is a mitzvah from the Sages for him to have others sit in judgment with him, for our Sages said: \"Do not act as a judge alone, for there is only One who judges alone.\"",
            "A person may execute judgment himself if he has the power to do so. If he acts according to the dictates of our faith and according to law, he is not obligated to take the trouble to come to the court. This applies even if he would not suffer any financial loss if he would delay and bring the matter to the court.<br>Consequently, should the other litigant lodge a complaint against him and bring him to court, if the court investigates and discovers that he acted according to law, i.e., the decision which he arrived at was true, we do not abrogate his decision.",
            "Although a court of three is considered as a complete entity, whenever there are more judges, it is praiseworthy. It is preferable to make a decision with 11 judges than with ten. All the judges who sit in court must be Torah scholars and of appropriate character.",
            "It is forbidden for a wise man to sit in judgment until he knows with whom he will be sitting. This restraint is observed lest he be coupled with men who are unsuitable. Thus he will be part of \"a band of traitors,\" and not part of a court."

            "Until when should the judges hold session? A minor <i>Sanhedrin</i> and a court of three should hold sessions from after the morning service until the end of the sixth hour of the day. The supreme <i>Sanhedrin</i>, by contrast, would hold sessions from the time of the slaughter of the morning sacrifice until the offering of the afternoon sacrifice. On Sabbaths and on festivals they would hold sessions in the House of Study on the Temple Mount.",
            "The High Court of 71 judges was not required to sit all together in their place in the Temple. Instead, when it was necessary for them to gather together, they would all gather together. At other times, whoever had private affairs would tend to his concerns and then return.<br>The above applies provided there would be no less than 23 judges in attendance whenever they were sitting. If a judge needs to leave, he should look at his colleagues who remain. If there are 23 remaining, he may leave. If not, he should not leave until another comes.",
            "A court should not begin adjudicating a case at night. According to the Oral Tradition, this concept was derived as follows: Based on Deuteronomy 21:5 which mentions: \"Every dispute and every blemish,\" an equation is established between the adjudication of disputes and blemishes. Just as blemishes are viewed only during the day; so, too, disputes should be adjudicated only during the day.",
            "Similarly, we do not listen to the testimony of witnesses or validate the authenticity of legal documents at night. With regard to cases involving monetary law, if the judges began hearing the matter during the day, it is permitted for them to conclude the judgment at night.",
            "The division of an inheritance resembles a judgment, for with regard to them, Numbers 35:29 states: \"For the statutes of judgment.\" Therefore inheritances are not divided at night.",
            "When two people enter to visit a person who is deathly ill, if he makes statements dividing his estate in their presence, they may record his statements, but they may not adjudicate the division of the estate. They were three, if they desire, they may record his statements, or they may adjudicate the division of the estate.<br>When does the above apply? During the day. During the night, they may record his statements, but they may not adjudicate the division of the estate.",
            "Whenever a suitable court among the Jewish people sits in judgment, the Divine Presence rests among them. Accordingly, the judges must sit in awe and fear, wrapped in <i>tallitot</i>, and conduct themselves with reverence. It is forbidden to act frivolously, to joke, or to speak idle matters in court. Instead, one may speak only words of Torah and wisdom.",
            "Whenever a <i>Sanhedrin</i>, a king, or an exilarch appoints a judge who is not fitting and/or is not learned in the wisdom of the Torah and is not suitable to be a judge - even if he is entirely a delight and possesses other positive qualities - the person who appoints him violates a negative commandment, as Deuteronomy 1:17 states: \"Do not show favoritism in judgment.\" According to the Oral Tradition, we learned that this command is addressed to those who appoint judges.<br>Our Sages declare: \"Perhaps a person will say: 'So and so is attractive, I will appoint him as a judge,' 'So and so is strong, I will appoint him as a judge,' 'So and so is my relative, I will appoint him as a judge,' or \"So and so knows all the languages, I will appoint him as a judge.' This will lead to those who are liable being vindicated and those who should be vindicated held liable, not because the judge is wicked, but because he does not know Torah law. Therefore the Torah states: \"Do not show favoritism in judgment.\"<br>Our Sages also declare: \"Whoever appoints a judge who is not appropriate for the Jewish people is considered as if he erected a monument, as implied by Deuteronomy 16:22: \"Do not erect a monument which is hated by God, your Lord.\" If he is appointed instead of a Torah scholar, it is as if one planted an <i>asherah</i>, as <i>Ibid.</i>:21 states: \"Do not plant an <i>asherah</i> or any other tree next to God's altar.\"<br>And our Sages interpreted Exodus 20:20: \"Do not make gods of silver and gods of gold together with Me\" to mean \"Do not appoint a judge because of silver and gold.\" This refers to a judge who was appointed because of his wealth alone.",
            "Whenever a judge pays money in order to be appointed, it is forbidden to stand in his presence. Our Sages commanded that he be denigrated and derided. And our Sages declare: \"Consider the <i>tallit</i> with which he wraps himself as the saddle blanket of a donkey.\"",
            "This was the manner of conduct of the sages of the previous generations. They would flee from being appointed to a court and would undergo extreme pressure not to sit in judgment until they knew that there was no other person as appropriate as they were and that if they would refrain from participating in the judgment the quality of the legal system would be impaired. Even so, they would not sit in judgment until the people at large and the elders would compel them and implore them to do so."

            "At least one of the members of the Supreme <i>Sanhedrin</i>, a minor <i>Sanhedrin</i>, or a court of three must have received <i>semichah</i> (ordination) from a teacher who himself had been given <i>semichah</i>.<br>Our teacher, Moses ordained Joshua by placing his hands upon him, as Numbers 27:23 states: \"And he placed his hands upon him and commanded him.\" Similarly, Moses ordained the 70 judges and the Divine presence rested upon them. Those elders ordained others, and the others still others in later generations. This tradition continued until the Talmudic era, when the Sages had received ordination one from the other in a chain extending back to the court of Joshua, and to the court of Moses.<br>A person who is ordained by the <i>nasi</i> and one ordained by another ordained judge have the same status, even if that ordained judge never served in a <i>Sanhedrin</i>.",
            "How is the practice of <i>semichah</i> practiced for all time? The person conveying ordination does not rest his hands on the elder's head. Instead, he is addressed by the title of Rabbi and is told: \"You are ordained and you have the authority to render judgment, even in cases involving financial penalties.",
            "The <i>semichah</i> which ordains elders as judges may be conveyed only by three individuals. One of the three must have received <i>semichah</i> from others as explained.",
            "The term <i>Elohim</i> can be applied only to a court which received <i>semichah</i> in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> alone . They are wise men who are fit to render judgment who were scrutinized by a court within <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> which appointed them and conveyed <i>semichah</i> upon them.",
            "At first, whoever, had received <i>semichah</i> would convey <i>semichah</i> on his students. Afterwards, as an expression of honor to Hillel, the elder, the Sages ordained that <i>semichah</i> would not be conveyed upon anyone unless license had been granted by the <i>nasi</i>.<br>They also ordained that the <i>nasi</i> should not convey <i>semichah</i> unless he is accompanied by the <i>av beit din</i>, and that the <i>av beit din</i> should not convey <i>semichah</i> unless he was accompanied by the <i>nasi</i>. The other elders could convey <i>semichah</i> themselves after receiving license from the <i>nasi</i>, provided they were accompanied by two others. For <i>semichah</i> cannot be conveyed by less than three judges.",
            "<i>Semichah</i> may not be conveyed upon elders in the diaspora even if the judges conveying <i>semichah</i> received <i>semichah</i> in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. Even if the judges conveying <i>semichah</i> were in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and the elders to receive <i>semichah</i> were in the diaspora, they should not convey <i>semichah</i>. Needless to say, this applies if the judges conveying <i>semichah</i> were in the diaspora and the elders to receive <i>semichah</i> were in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<br>If both of them were in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, <i>semichah</i> may be conveyed even though the recipients are not in the same place as those conveying <i>semichah</i>. Instead, the judges conveying <i>semichah</i> send to the elder or write to him that he has been given <i>semichah</i> and that he has permission to adjudicate cases involving financial penalties.<br>This is acceptable, because both of them are located in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. The entire area of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> which the Jews who left Egypt took possession of is fit to have <i>semichah</i> conveyed within it.",
            "Judges who themselves were granted <i>semichah</i> may convey <i>semichah</i> on many individuals - even 100 - at one time. King David once conveyed <i>semichah</i> on 30,000 individuals on one day.",
            "Such judges may appoint whoever they desire for particular matters, provided he is fit to adjudicate all matters.<br>What is implied? A court has the authority to give <i>semichah</i> to a remarkable judge who is fit to issue rulings with regard to the entire Torah and limit his authority to the adjudication of financial matters, but not to what is forbidden and permitted. Conversely, they may grant him authority with regard to what is forbidden and permitted, but not to adjudicate cases involving financial matters. Or they may give him license with regard to adjudicate both such manners, but not laws involving financial penalties, or to rule with regard to financial penalties, but not to rule that a blemish disqualifies a firstborn animal. Or they may give him license merely to absolve vows, to judge stains, or to rule only within other similarly limited parameters.",
            "Similarly, the judges conveying <i>semichah</i> have permission to give the person receiving <i>semichah</i> license to judge only for a specific time, telling him: \"You have permission to judge or issue rulings until the <i>nasi</i> arrives here,\" or \"...as long as you are together with us in this city,\" or to issue other similar restrictions.",
            "When a sage of remarkable knowledge is blind in one eye, he is not given <i>semichah</i> with regard to matters of financial law although he may adjudicate such cases. The rationale is that he is not fit to judge all matters. Similar principles apply in all analogous situations.",

Afterwards, he and these 70 should join together to make up the Supreme <i>Sanhedrin</i> and grant <i>semichah</i> to others to make up other courts.<br>It appears to me that if all the all the wise men in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> agree to appoint judges and convey <i>semichah</i> upon them, the <i>semichah</i> is binding and these judges may adjudicate cases involving financial penalties and convey <i>semichah</i> upon others.<br>If so, why did the Sages suffer anguish over the institution of <i>semichah</i>, so that the judgment of cases involving financial penalties would not be nullified among the Jewish people? Because the Jewish people were dispersed, and it is impossible that all could agree. If, by contrast, there was a person who had received <i>semichah</i> from a person who had received <i>semichah</i>, he does not require the consent of all others. Instead, he may adjudicate cases involving financial penalties for everyone, for he received <i>semichah</i> from a court.<br>The question whether <i>semichah</i> can be renewed requires resolution.",

Matters that occur only infrequently, by contrast, even though they involve financial loss, e.g., an animal that injures another, or events that commonly occur, but do not involve financial loss, e.g., a double payment for theft, are not adjudicated by the judges of the diaspora.<br>Similarly, all the financial penalties which our Sages imposed against a person who punches a colleague, slaps a colleague, or the like are not adjudicated by the judges of the diaspora. Whenever a person is required to pay half the damages for the destruction of property the matter is not adjudicated by the judges of the diaspora, with the exception of the half payment for damages caused by pebbles propelled by one's animals. For that is a reimbursement for financial loss and is not a financial penalty.",

Therefore if a person injures a colleague, compensation for the damages, the pain, and the embarrassment for which he is liable is not expropriated by the judges of the diaspora. Compensation for the inability to work and medical expenses is, by contrast, expropriated in the diaspora, because they involve a financial loss. The <i>Geonim</i> ruled in this manner and stated that it is a commonplace matter to expropriate compensation for the inability to work and medical expenses in the diaspora.",
            "The judges of the diaspora do not exact payment when an animal injures a person, because this is an uncommon occurrence. When, by contrast, a person damages an animal belonging to a colleague, he must pay the complete damages to his colleague regardless of where this takes place, just as he is responsible if he ripped his garments, broke his utensils, or cut down his produce.<br>Similarly, when an animal causes damage by eating or by treading, since its owner is forewarned that this is its inherent natural tendency, it is a common matter and the damages are expropriated by the judges of the diaspora. This applies whether it damaged another animal, e.g., it rubbed against it, it consumed produce that it would naturally eat or the like, or it damaged food or utensils by treading upon them in which instance he is obligated to pay full damages. Payment for all of these damages can be expropriated by the judges of the diaspora.<br>If, however, an animal was not prone to cause damage, then it caused damages to the extent that the owner was warned, and then it caused damage again, e.g., it bit, it butted with its body, it lay down, it kicked, or it gored, these damages are not expropriated by the judges of the diaspora. The rationale is that there is no concept of the owner of an animal being forewarned in the diaspora. Even if an animal caused its owner to be forewarned in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, and then it was taken to the diaspora where it caused damage, the damages are not expropriated, because this is an uncommon occurrence.",

And the concept of a court applies only with regard to judges who have been given <i>semichah</i> in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<br>Accordingly, if a court of judges from <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> were in the diaspora, just as they have the authority to judge laws involving financial penalties in the diaspora; so, too, testimony regarding an animal can be delivered in their presence in the diaspora.",

For the payment to a maiden's father for blemishing her virginity and for the embarrassment she suffers, and a person who must pay an atonement fee because his ox killed another person are situations where a person must make compensation, because of his statements. For example, he said: \"I seduced so-and-so's daughter,\" or \"My ox killed so-and-so.\" Nevertheless, such payments are not expropriated by the judges of the diaspora.",
            "Judgments involving situations where a person's actions served as a direct cause of damage are not equivalent to laws involving <i>k'nasot</i> and they may be adjudicated by the judges of the diaspora.",

            "The custom of the <i>yeshivot</i> of the diaspora is that even though they do not expropriate money due as <i>k'nasot</i>, they place the person who causes the damage under a ban of ostracism until he satisfies the plaintiff or goes with him to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> to have the case adjudicated.<br>Once the person who causes the damage pays the amount that he would be held liable for, the ban of ostracism is lifted whether the person who suffered the injury is appeased or not. Similarly, if the person who suffered the injury seizes an amount of property belonging to the person who causes the damage equivalent to the amount he would be awarded by the court, we do not expropriate it from his possession.",
            "When one person is an expert judge and he is known by many to possess such knowledge, although he is allowed to judge cases involving financial law alone, an admission of liability made in his presence is not considered as an admission made in the presence of a court. This applies even if he possesses <i>semichah</i>.<br>When, by contrast, a court is composed of three judges, even though they do not possesses <i>semichah</i>, and even if they are ordinary men and are not referred to as <i>Elohim</i>, an admission made in their presence is considered as an admission made in a court of law. Similarly, if a person denies an obligation in their presence and witnesses come and testify against him, he is established as one who has lied. He cannot offer another claim, as we have explained.<br>The general principle is: With regard to the admission of financial responsibility, cases involving debts, and the like, their authority is the same as that of a court composed of judges possessing <i>semichah</i> with regard to all matters."

The situation is returned to its original status and the judgment required by halachah is rendered. If it is impossible to return the matter to its original status, e.g., the person who unwarrantedly received the money traveled overseas, or he was a stubborn and strong person, the judge is not liable. Although he caused a loss, he did not have the intent of doing so.

The rationale is that he is an expert.<br>If the ruling cannot be reversed, he is not liable to make restitution.

If he personally took property from one litigant and gave it to the other, his actions are irreversible and he should pay the damages from his own resources.

Therefore, the judgment he renders is of no consequence. This applies whether he erred or whether he did not err. Either one of the litigants may withdraw and have the case adjudicated by a proper court.<br>If such a judge erred and personally gave property from one litigant to the other, he is obligated to pay from his own resources. He may then regain the money from the litigant to whom he gave property unlawfully. If one litigant paid the other because of the ruling of such a judge and the recipient is unable to return the money or if the judge rendered an object ritually impure or gave meat that was kosher to the dogs to eat, the judge must bear the loss as is the law regarding anyone who causes damages.

At the time the judgment is being rendered, however, he may vote to be counted among those favoring conviction, as we explained.<br>Cases involving financial matters are adjudicated during the day, but the verdict may be rendered at night. Cases involving capital punishment are adjudicated during the day and the verdict must also be rendered during the day. The verdict in cases involving financial matters is rendered on that very day, whether it is to the defendant's detriment or in his support. With regard to cases involving capital punishment, by contrast, a verdict of acquittal is rendered on that very day, but a verdict of conviction is not rendered until the following day.",

An elderly person, a eunuch, and a person who does not have sons are placed on the court which judges him, so that they will not have mercy on him.

We tell him: \"Desist...\" or \"Do not do it. It is a transgression and you are liable to be executed by the court...\" or \"to receive lashes for it.\" If he ceases, he is not liable. Similarly, if he remains silent or nods his head, he is not liable for punishment. Even if he says: \"I know,\" he is not liable for punishment until he accepts death upon himself, saying: \"It is for this reason that I am doing this.\" In such a situation, he is executed.<br>He must commit the transgression directly after receiving the warning, within the time to offer a salutation. If he waits longer than that, a second warning is necessary.<br>The warning is acceptable whether it was administered by one of the witnesses or by another individual, even a woman or a servant. Even if the transgressor hears the voice of the person administering the warning, but does not see him, and even if he himself administers the warning, he should be executed.",

With regard to financial matters, if there is any deceit, a person can make financial restitution and receive atonement. With regard to capital punishment, the victim's blood and the blood of his unborn descendants are dependent on the murderer until eternity. As it is said with regard to Cain, 'The voice of the blood of your brother is crying out.' The Torah uses the plural form of the word blood, implying his blood and the blood of his descendants.<br>\"For this reason, man was created alone in the world. This teaches us that a person who eliminates one soul from the world is considered as if he eliminated an entire world. Conversely, a person who saves one soul is considered as if he saved an entire world.<br>\"All the inhabitants of the world are created in the image of Adam, the first man, and yet no one person's face resembles the face of his colleague.

Even if there are 100 witnesses, each one is questioned and cross-examined.<br>If the testimony of all the witnesses is accurate, we begin the judgment with a statement that tends to acquittal as stated. We tell him: \"If you did not transgress, do not fear their words.\" Then we judge him. If grounds for acquittal are found, he is released. If they do not find grounds for acquittal, the defendant is imprisoned until the following day.<br>On that day, the <i>Sanhedrin</i> divides itself into pairs and they examine the judgment.

If they find a rationale to acquit him, they acquit him. If it is necessary to add judges, they add. If there is a majority of judges who seek to convict him, and he is convicted, he is taken out to be executed immediately.<br>The place where the court conducts the execution is outside the court and removed from it, as implied by Leviticus 24:14: \"Take the blasphemer outside the camp....\" It appears to me that it should be approximately 6 <i>mil</i> , the distance between the court of Moses our teacher which was before the entrance of the Tent of Meeting and the extremities of the camp of the Jewish people.",

            "How are lashes administered? The transgressor's two hands are bound to a pillar on either side. The community attendant takes hold of his clothes and pulls downward. If they tear at the front, that is satisfactory; if the tear at the sides, that is satisfactory. He continues until he uncovers his heart. The rationale is that he should not administer lashes on his garment, as indicated by Deuteronomy 25:2: \"And he shall strike him,\" i.e., \"him,\" and not his garment.<br>A stone is placed behind him. The attendant who administers the lashes stands on it. He holds a strap of calf's leather that is folded into two, and a second one, making four, and two straps of donkey leather attached to it that rise and descend with it.<br>The strap is a handbreadth wide and it is long enough to reach the transgressor's belly. The handle of the strap is a handbreadth wide.",
            "The man administering the lashes should be heavily endowed with knowledge and minimally endowed with physical power. He should lift up the strap with both his hands and strike him with one hand, with all his power.<br>He should strike him with a third of the lashes on his front, i.e., on his breast, between his nipples, and two thirds of the lashes on his back, one third on one shoulder and the other third on the other shoulder.",
            "The person receiving the lashes should not stand, nor should he sit. Instead, he should bend over as Deuteronomy 25:2 states: \"The judge shall cast him down.\" The verse continues: \"And he shall strike him before him.\" This implies that the attention of the judge should be focused upon him. He should not look at other matters while having him lashed. From this, we learn that two people are never lashed at the same time.",
            "Through the time the person is being lashed, the judge of the highest stature reads the passage Deuteronomy 28:58 \"If you are not careful to heed and to perform... in an extraordinary way, God will increase the blows against you and your offspring....\" He should have the intent to complete the passage with the lashes. If the lashes are not completed, he should return to the beginning of the passage and read it again - and again if necessary until all the lashes are administered.<br>The judge of intermediate stature counts the lashes and the third judge tells the attendant before each blow: \"Strike him.\" Throughout the entire time he administers the lashes, he does so following the judge's instruction.",
            "If the person receiving the lashes dies while receiving them, the attendant administering them is not liable. If he added another blow to the estimate arrived at by the judges and the person receiving the lashes dies, the attendant is exiled. If he does not die, the attendant is held liable for transgressing a negative commandment, as Deuteronomy 25:3 states: \"Do not add.\"<br>Similarly, any other person who strikes a colleague violates a negative commandment. If a person who was given permission by the Torah to strike a colleague is warned not to strike him more than is required to punish his wickedness, certainly, this applies with regard to other people. For this reason, whenever a person strikes a colleague - even a servant - with a blow for which the victim would not receive a <i>p'rutah</i> in damages, the offender should be lashed. If, however, the blow is worth a <i>p'rutah</i> in damages, the offender is not lashed. The rationale is that he is obligated to make financial restitution, and a person never both receives lashes and is required to make financial restitution, as explained previously in several places."

            "How are lashes administered to a person liable to receive them? According to his strength, as indicated by Deuteronomy 25:2: \"According to his wickedness by number.\" The number 40 stated in the following verse is mentioned to teach that more than 40 lashes are never administered even if the person is as healthy and as strong as Samson. When, by contrast, a person is weak, the amount of lashes is reduced. For if a weak person is given many lashes, he will certainly die. Therefore our Sages said: that even a very healthy person is given only 39 lashes. For if accidentally an extra blow is administered, he will still not have been given more than the 40 which he was required to receive.",

If it was estimated that he could bear 20, we do not say that he should be given 21, so that the number of lashes will be divisible by three. Instead, he is given 18 lashes.<br>If the court estimated that he could bear 40 lashes, but when they began lashing him, they saw that he was weak and that he would not be able to bear more than the nine or twelve lashes that he already received, he is released.

The rationale is that at the time the estimation was made, it was reckoned that he would not be lashed until a later date. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.",

If not, he is given lashes, given time to recuperate, and then given lashes again.<br>What is implied? He was held liable for two transgressions punishable by lashes. The court estimated that he could bear 45 lashes, once he receives these 45, he is absolved from further punishment. If, however, they estimated the amount of lashes he could bear for one transgression, and they gave him three, nine, or thirty lashes according to their estimation, we wait until he is healed, and estimate how many lashes he can bear for the second lashing until he is given all the lashings for which he is obligated.",

If the lash became severed in the midst of the second lashing, he is absolved. If it became severed in the midst of the first lashing, he is absolved from the first set of lashes, but is given the lashes of the second set.",

Instead, the young priests take him out of the Temple Courtyard and crack his head open with logs.<br>It is a Scriptural decree that the court does not execute a person or have him lashed because of his own admission. Instead, the punishments are given on the basis of the testimony of two witnesses. Joshua's execution of Achan and David's execution of the Amalekite convert because of their own statements was a directive of immediate relevance only or was by royal fiat. The <i>Sanhedrin</i>, however, may not execute or lash a person who admits committing a transgression, lest he become crazed concerning this matter. Perhaps he is one of those embittered people who are anxious to die and pierce their reins with swords or throw themselves from the rooftops.

Or to give a graphic example, the pursuer entered into a ruin, following the pursued and the witnesses followed him. They saw the victim slain, in his death throes, and the sword dripping blood in the hand of the killer, since they did not see him strike him, the court does not execute the killer based on this testimony. Concerning this and the like, Exodus 23:7 states: \"Do not kill an innocent and righteous person.\"<br>Similarly, if two people testified that a person served a false deity in different circumstances, e.g., one saw him serve the sun and warned him, while the other saw him serve the moon and warned him, their testimonies are not combined. This can also be inferred from the verse: \"Do not kill an innocent and righteous person.\" Since there is a rationale on which basis he could be held innocent and righteous, he should not be executed.",

Even in situations where the transgressor was commanded to sacrifice his life and not transgress, if he sinned under duress, although he desecrated God's name, he should not be executed. This is derived from Deuteronomy 22:26: \"To the maiden, you should not do anything.\" This verse is a warning to the court not to punish a person who transgresses under duress.",

            "It is forbidden for the court to have compassion for the killer. The judges should not say: \"Since this person has already been killed, what advantage is there in killing another person,\" and thus be lax in executing him. This is implied by Deuteronomy 19:13: \"Do not allow your eyes to take pity. You shall eliminate innocent bloodshed.\"<br>Similarly, it is forbidden for the court to take pity on a person who was obligated to pay a fine. They should not say: \"He is poor. He acted unintentionally.\" Instead, they should exact the entire payment from him without compassion, as <i>Ibid.</i>:21 states: \"You shall not take pity.\"<br>Similarly, in questions of monetary law, one should not show mercy to the poor, saying: \"He is indigent and the other litigant is wealthy. Since both I and the wealthy man are obligated to provide for the poor person's livelihood, I will vindicate him in judgment and thus he will derive his livelihood with honor.\" With regard to this, the Torah warned Exodus 23:3: \"Do not glorify the indigent in his dispute,\" and Leviticus 19:15: \"Do not show favor to the poor.\"<br>It is forbidden to show favor to a person of stature. What is implied? Two people come before one for judgment, one a wise man of stature and one, an ordinary person. One may not ask about the welfare of the person of stature first, nor treat him with favor, nor show him honor, lest this cause the other litigant to become tongue-tied. Instead, the judge should not turn to either of them in a personal manner until the judgment is concluded. This is derived from [<i>Ibid.</i>: \"Do not glorify the countenance of a person of stature.\" Our Sages said: One should not say: \"This man is affluent; he is the son of people of stature, how can I embarrass him and witness his humiliation.\" With regard to this, it is written: \"Do not glorify the countenance of a person of stature.\"",

            "Similarly, he may have a person's hands and feet bound. He may imprison him and have him pushed to the ground and dragged, as Ezra 7:26 states: \"Judgment will be speedily administered to him, to be executed, to be uprooted, to be punished by a loss of property, and to be imprisoned.\"",
            "All of the above measures should be applied according to the judge's perception that it is appropriate that the violator be punished in this manner or the situation at large requires it. All of his deeds should be for the sake of heaven and the honor of people at large should not be light in his eyes. For consideration of their honor overrides the observance of a Rabbinic prohibition. Certainly, this applies with regard to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob who uphold the Torah of truth. He must take care not to ruin their honor and act only to increase the honor of the Omnipresent. For whenever a person debases the Torah, his person will be degraded for people at large. Conversely, when a person honors the Torah, his person will be honored by people at large. And there is no other honor for the Torah except to follow its statutes and judgments."

            "It is forbidden for a judge to assert himself in a lordly and haughty manner over his community. Instead, he should conduct himself with humility and awe. Any leader who casts unnecessary fear upon the community not for the sake of heaven will be punished. And he will not see a son who is a Torah scholar, as implied by a non-literal reading of Job 37:24: \"Therefore people fear him - he will never see anyone with a wise heart.\"",
            "Similarly, a judge may not treat them with capriciousness even though they are common people. He should not step over the heads of the holy people. Even though they are simple people and lowly, they are the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and the hosts of God whom He led out of Egypt with great power and a strong hand. He should patiently bear the difficulty of the community and their burden like Moses our teacher, as Numbers 11:12 states concerning him: \"As a nursemaid will carry an infant.\" And Deuteronomy 1:16 states: \"And I commanded your judges.\" This is a admonition to the judges to bear the community like a nursemaid carries an infant.<br>Take an example from Moses, the master of all prophets whom the Holy One, blessed be He, sent to Egypt, about whom Exodus 6:12 states: \"And I commanded them concerning the children of Israel.\" The Oral Tradition relates that God told Moses and Aaron to accept this mission even though the people would curse them and stone them.",
            "Just as a judge is commanded to fulfill this mitzvah; so, too, the community is commanded to show honor to a judge, as Deuteronomy 1:18 states: \"And I commanded you....\" This is a command to the community that they should treat a judge with awe.

Now if performing work in public is forbidden to him, certainly, it is forbidden for him to eat and drink or to become intoxicated in the presence of people at large and in the gatherings of the common people and in friendly get-togethers. Woe to those judges who conduct themselves in this manner, disgracing the Torah of Moses. They debase its judgments and lower them to the earth, casting them in the dust, bringing about harm to them and their descendants in this world and in the world to come.",

For the word of the court's agent is accepted as that of two witnesses with regard to the question of ostracism. Were he to say: \"So-and-so disgraced me,\" \"...disgraced the judge,\" or \"...refused to appear in court,\" that person is ostracized on the basis of his statements. We do not, however, have a document recording the ban of ostracism composed until two witness come and testify that he refused to appear in the court.",

When the agent went and conveyed this message on a day on which it was not known that the court to hold session. On a day on which it is known to hold session, by contrast, everyone knows that all of the judges gather together.

This ban is recorded in a legal document; he is liable to pay the fee of the scribe who composes the document. When he comes to court, this document is torn.<br>If such a document was composed because a litigant did not accept a judgment, it may be torn up when he states that he is willing to accept it. When a court summons a litigant to appear on a certain day and he does not appear at all that day, a document recording the ban of ostracism is composed that evening.<br>When does the above apply? When he lived in the city and stubbornly refused to come. If, however, he lived in the outlying villages and would go in and go out from the city at times, we summon him to appear in court on Monday, Thursday, and the following Monday. If the second Monday passes without him appearing, we do not compose a ban of ostracism until the following day.",

Nor is a summons issued for Friday, or for the day preceding a festival. We do, however, issue a summons in Nissan, for him to appear after Nissan, and a summons in Tishrei, for him to appear after Tishrei. We do not, however, issue a summons on Friday for a litigant to appear after the Sabbath. The rationale is that everyone is busy on Friday.",

If he is accustomed to coming on that day, the agent may tell one of his neighbors, even a woman: \"If so-and-so comes, inform him that the court summoned him to appear at this time.\" If he does not come that day, he is placed under a ban of ostracism that evening.<br>When does the above apply? When the way which he is wont to follow does not pass the place of the court. If, however, his path passes the court, he is not placed under a ban of ostracism until the agent notifies him himself. For perhaps the neighbors will not notify him. For they will rationalize: \"His path passes past the entrance to the court. Certainly, he visited them and was released.\" Similarly, if he will not come into the city until the following day, we do not rely on the neighbors, for perhaps they will forget and fail to notify him.",
            "The following laws apply when a person comes to the court and accepts the judgment issued against him, he is told to make financial restitution, but does not do so. He is not placed under a ban of ostracism until he is given a warning on Monday, Thursday, and the following Monday. If he does not pay by that time, he is placed under a ban of ostracism until he pays what he is liable. If he waits 30 days and does not seek to have the ban of ostracism lifted, he is excommunicated."

            "Anyone who curses one of the judges of Israel transgresses a negative commandment, as Exodus 22:27 states: \"Do not curse a judge.\" Similarly, if a person curses a <i>nasi</i>, whether the head of the Supreme <i>Sanhedrin</i> or a king, he transgresses a negative commandment, as the verse continues: \"Do not curse a prince among your nation.\"<br>This prohibition does not apply only to a judge or a <i>nasi</i>. Instead, anyone who curses any other Jew receives lashes, as Leviticus 19:14 states: \"Do not curse a deaf-mute.\" Why does the verse mention a deaf-mute? To teach you that even when a person who cannot hear and thus will not be bothered by being cursed, the person pronouncing the curse is lashed. It appears to me that a person who curses a child who is embarrassed receives lashes; the child resembles a deaf-mute.",

For the person to be liable for two transgressions. Thus we learn that a person who curses any Jew, whether a man, woman, or child receives one set of lashes. If he curses a judge, he receives two sets of lashes. If he curses a <i>nasi</i>, he receives three sets of lashes. And if the son of a <i>nasi</i> curses his father, he is liable for four transgression, the three for which all others are liable and one for cursing his father.",

Since a person is liable if he cursed a colleague with any of these descriptive terms, he is also liable if he cursed him in any other language. For the names with which the gentiles refer to the Holy One, blessed be He, are comparable to all of these descriptive terms.<br>The term <i>arur</i> (\"cursed\") can imply an oath, a curse, and a ban of ostracism.",

Similarly, with regard to other people, even though the person who was cursed is prepared to look past the matter, the person who uttered the curse is lashed, for he committed a transgression and incurred liability.<br>If, however, a person is obligated to be placed under a ban of ostracism, because he conducted himself in an unbridled manner in court, and the judges desire to look past the affront to their honor and not impose a ban of ostracism, they have that license, provided it will not lead to a decline in the honor of the Creator. For example, people at large were repudiating the words of the Torah and the judges. Since the people overstepped the bounds, the court must act firmly and punish as they see necessary.",

This is indicated by Exodus 21:1: \"These are the judgments that you shall place before them.\" \"Before them\" and not before gentiles; \"before them\" and not before ordinary people.<br>The following procedure should be carried out if the gentiles have a powerful law enforcement system and the opposing litigant is a stubborn and powerful person from whom one cannot expropriate property through the judicial system of the Jewish people.
