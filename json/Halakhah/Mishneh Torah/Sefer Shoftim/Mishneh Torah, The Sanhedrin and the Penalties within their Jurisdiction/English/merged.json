            "How many regular courts of law are to be in Israel, and how many members should each include? To begin with, a supreme court named <i>Great Sanhedrin</i> is established in the Temple; it consists of seventy-one members, as it is written: \"Gather for me seventy of the elders of Israel,\" presided over by Moses, as it is written: \"Let them present themselves beside you\" Numbers 11:16-17), thus totaling seventy-one. The greatest sage among them all is appointed their presiding officer, who also serves as head of the academy. He is designated by the sages as <i>Nasi</i> (president), who occupies the position of our teacher Moses. The most eminent member of the seventy is placed second in rank and is seated to the right of the <i>Nasi.</i> He is referred to as <i>Av-beth-din</i> (tribunal chairman). The rest of the seventy are seated in front of both, according to their distinction : the greater in knowledge, the closer he is placed to the left of the <i>Nasi.</i> They sit in the form of a semicircle, so that the <i>Nasi</i> and the <i>Av-beth-din</i> may see all of them.<br>Two other tribunals, each consisting of twenty-three members, are set up [next to the Great Sanhedrin], one at the entrance of the Temple Court and the other at the entrance of the Temple Mount. Besides, a Small Sanhedrin is set up in every town of Israel with a population of one hundred and twenty or more, and is to meet at the gate of the town, as it is written: \"Let justice prevail at the gate\" (Amos 5:15). How many members make up the Small Sanhedrin? Twenty-three judges. The most learned man among them presides over them; the rest are seated in the form of a semicircular threshing floor, so that the presiding judge may see all of them.",

            "If the members of the Sanhedrin dispute about something and must ordain a new member to increase their number, they ordain the outstanding scholar of the first row. Thereupon the first in the second row takes the last seat in the first row, and the first in the third row takes the last seat in the second. Then they choose a new member out of the rest of the community to occupy the last seat in the third row. The same procedure is followed if they must ordain a second or a third additional member.",

This verse has been traditionally interpreted to refer to one who is in charge of appointing judges. The sages have declared that if you say: \"I will appoint a certain individual to serve as judge because he is handsome … because he is a hero … because he is my relative … because he is a linguist,\" the result will be that he will acquit the guilty and condemn the innocent, not because he is evil but because he is lacking in knowledge.

If both are in Eretz Yisrael, ordination may be conferred upon the candidate, even if they do not reside in the same place, in which case they inform him by a messenger or in writing that he is ordained; and he is thus granted authorization to conduct lawsuits involving fines.

I will then construct the argument correctly, so that the judgment will be quoted in my name\"? The Torah therefore says, \"Distance yourself from falsehood.\"",
            "It is a Mitzvah to tell the parties at the beginning 'do you want Din (strict justice), or Pesharah (arbitration)?' If they want Pesharah, we seek out a compromise for them. A court that always does Pesharah is praiseworthy. Of them the verse says, “A just peace was made in your gates.” What kind of peace is also justice? We must conclude that this is Pesharah. As it is stated regarding King David, “And David made justice and righteousness to the nation.” What is the justice that has with it righteousness? We must conclude that it is arbitration.  This is before the verdict, even if you heard their words and know which way the verdict leans. Once the case finished, and he said “Ploni, you are innocent, and Almoni, you are liable,” you may not do Pesharah, rather, let the Din pierce the mountain."

It may destroy those funds or give them to whomever they see fit to close any breaches in the faith and to strengthen its observance or to penalize a stubborn and difficult person. The Book of Ezra 10:8 states: \"Whoever fails to come in three days according to the advice of the officers and the elders will have all of his property confiscated.\" From this we learn that when a court declares property ownerless, their declaration is effective."
