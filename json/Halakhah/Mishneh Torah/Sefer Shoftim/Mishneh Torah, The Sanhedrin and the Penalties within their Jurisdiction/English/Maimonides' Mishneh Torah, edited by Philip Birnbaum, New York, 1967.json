            "How many regular courts of law are to be in Israel, and how many members should each include? To begin with, a supreme court named <i>Great Sanhedrin</i> is established in the Temple; it consists of seventy-one members, as it is written: \"Gather for me seventy of the elders of Israel,\" presided over by Moses, as it is written: \"Let them present themselves beside you\" Numbers 11:16-17), thus totaling seventy-one. The greatest sage among them all is appointed their presiding officer, who also serves as head of the academy. He is designated by the sages as <i>Nasi</i> (president), who occupies the position of our teacher Moses. The most eminent member of the seventy is placed second in rank and is seated to the right of the <i>Nasi.</i> He is referred to as <i>Av-beth-din</i> (tribunal chairman). The rest of the seventy are seated in front of both, according to their distinction : the greater in knowledge, the closer he is placed to the left of the <i>Nasi.</i> They sit in the form of a semicircle, so that the <i>Nasi</i> and the <i>Av-beth-din</i> may see all of them.<br>Two other tribunals, each consisting of twenty-three members, are set up [next to the Great Sanhedrin], one at the entrance of the Temple Court and the other at the entrance of the Temple Mount. Besides, a Small Sanhedrin is set up in every town of Israel with a population of one hundred and twenty or more, and is to meet at the gate of the town, as it is written: \"Let justice prevail at the gate\" (Amos 5:15). How many members make up the Small Sanhedrin? Twenty-three judges. The most learned man among them presides over them; the rest are seated in the form of a semicircular threshing floor, so that the presiding judge may see all of them.",
            "If a town has less than one hundred and twenty residents, three judges are appointed there, since no court can be sustained by less than three, sufficient to form a majority and a minority if there is a dispute among them about a point of law.",
            "Any town that does not have two eminent scholars, one competent to teach the entire Torah and the other competent to comprehend and discuss, is not entitled to have a Sanhedrin established inside it, even if its population consists of thousands of Israelites.",

The first row is near the Sanhedrin; the second row is behind the first, and the third row is behind the second. They are seated in each row according to their distinction in scholarship.",
            "If the members of the Sanhedrin dispute about something and must ordain a new member to increase their number, they ordain the outstanding scholar of the first row. Thereupon the first in the second row takes the last seat in the first row, and the first in the third row takes the last seat in the second. Then they choose a new member out of the rest of the community to occupy the last seat in the third row. The same procedure is followed if they must ordain a second or a third additional member.",

Whoever was found to be wise, sin-fearing, humble, contrite, respectful and well-liked by people, was made judge in his town; from the local court he was promoted to the court situated at the entrance of the Temple Mount; from there he was promoted to the court situated at the entrance of the Temple Court; and from there he was promoted to the supreme court.",

This verse has been traditionally interpreted to refer to one who is in charge of appointing judges. The sages have declared that if you say: \"I will appoint a certain individual to serve as judge because he is handsome … because he is a hero … because he is my relative … because he is a linguist,\" the result will be that he will acquit the guilty and condemn the innocent, not because he is evil but because he is lacking in knowledge.

If both are in Eretz Yisrael, ordination may be conferred upon the candidate, even if they do not reside in the same place, in which case they inform him by a messenger or in writing that he is ordained; and he is thus granted authorization to conduct lawsuits involving fines.

            "A judge must not conduct legal proceedings for his own friend, even if the latter has not been his best man nor one to whom he has been intimately attached. Neither should he act as judge for one whom he dislikes, even though he is not his avowed enemy nor one who means to injure him. It is necessary that both parties to a lawsuit should be equal in the eyes and the minds of the judges. The judge who fails to know either litigant and his activities is most likely to be a rightful judge.",
            "Two scholars who dislike each other must not act as judges together, since this might result in perverted justice. Owing to the hostility between them, each will be inclined to refute the other.",
            "A judge should ever regard himself as if a sword were placed upon his neck, with <i>Gehinnom</i> gaping under him. He should know whom he is judging, before whom he is judging, and who will punish him for deviating from the line of truth, as it is written: \"God stands in the divine assembly, in the midst of the judges\" (Psalm 82:1).— —",

            "Ever regard the litigants as guilty when they are facing you, on the presumption that each of them has a false claim, and judge according to the arguments of which you approve. But when they go away from you, regard them both as innocent after having submitted to the judgment; regard each of them favorably."

            "A judge must not behave toward the community in a domineering and arrogant manner, but with humility and reverence. Any leader who casts exaggerated fear upon the community for ulterior motives will be punished.— —",
            "So too, he must not behave toward the people contemptuously, even if they happen to be ignorant. He must not stride over the heads of a holy people. Even if they happen to be uninformed and lowly, they are still the children of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.— —",
            "Just as the judge is charged with this duty, so is the community charged with the duty of treating the judge with respect.— —",
            "As soon as a person is appointed leader of the community, he must not do menial work in the presence of three men, so that he does not degrade himself in front of them. If he must not do menial work in public, it stands to reason that he is even more forbidden to eat and drink and get intoxicated in the presence of many people.— —"
