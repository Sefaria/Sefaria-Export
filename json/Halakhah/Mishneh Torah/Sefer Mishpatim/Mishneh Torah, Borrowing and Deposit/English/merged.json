            "If a man borrowed implements, or an animal or any movables, from another person, and the thing borrowed was lost or stolen, even if subjected to a major accident, as in the case of an animal that was injured or captured or it died, he must make full restitution, as it is written: \"When a man borrows [an animal] from another and it is injured or dies, its owner not being with it, he must make full restitution\" (Exodus 22:13). This applies only when the accident happened while the animal was not at work ; if, however, a man borrowed an animal from another to plough with it and it died while ploughing, he is free from liability. But he is held liable if it died before or after the ploughing ; or if, instead of ploughing with it, he rode on it or threshed grain with it, and it died during the threshing or riding. And so it is in all similar cases.— —",

            "If a man borrowed an instrument or an animal from another for an indefinite period, the lender may demand its return at any time he pleases. If he borrowed the object for a definite period, once he acquired a right to it by drawing it [to himself], the owner cannot demand its return until the end of the borrowing term. — —",
            "If a man borrowed from another an implement with which to do a certain piece of work, the lender cannot demand its return until the borrower has completed that particular work. So too, if one borrowed an animal to take him to a certain place, the lender cannot demand its return until the borrower has gone to that place and returned from it."

            "If a man deposited anything with another gratuitously and it was stolen or lost, the bailee takes an oath and is released from liability, as it is written: \"When a man gives money or any article to another for safekeeping and it is stolen from the man's house … the owner of the house shall depose before the judges that he has not laid hands on his neighbor's property\" (Exodus 22:6-7). An additional oath is imposed on him : that it was not his fault but he took normal care of it, after the manner of bailees, and made no use of it before it was stolen. If the bailee had made use of the deposit before it was stolen, he is held responsible for it.",
            "Since Scripture has acquitted a gratuitous guardian in the case of theft, it stands to reason that he is all the more free from liability in the case of such major accidents as injury, capture or death of an animal, provided that he did not make use of the object deposited; if he did, he is held responsible in the case of accidents. What is the normal manner of bailees? It is all according to the deposit. There is a deposit that is placed at the gate-house for safekeeping; for example, beams and stones; there is a type of deposit that is put in the courtyard for safekeeping; for example, large bundles of flax and the like; another type of deposit is placed in the house for safekeeping; for example, a garment or a cloak; still another type of deposit is put in a box or a chest and locked for safekeeping; for example, silk garments and silver or gold objects, and the like.",
            "If a bailee put the deposit in an unsuitable place, and it was stolen from there or lost, even if a major accident befell it, as where a fire broke out and the entire house was burned down, he is charged with negligence and must make restitution. Even if the bailee put the deposit together with his own belongings, [the rule is that] if the place was suitable for safekeeping, he is free from liability; if the place was not suitable for safekeeping, he is liable. He is permitted to be careless with his own property, and not with the property of others."

            "If a man deposited money or valuable objects with another, and thieves came upon the bailee who forestalled them and gave them the deposit in order to save himself, he is held responsible if he was reputed to be a man of wealth, since the presumption is that the thieves came because of him, and that he saved himself with the other's money. But if he was not considered wealthy, the presumption is that they came only for the deposit, and he is free from responsibility. This applies to all similar cases."

            "If a man left an animal or implements with another for safekeeping and they were stolen or lost, and the bailee said: \"I will rather make restitution than take an oath,\" and then the thief was found, the thief must make twofold restitution, and if he had slaughtered or sold the animal he must make fourfold or fivefold restitution to the bailee who had agreed to pay [rather than take an oath].— —",
            "A gratuitous guardian who said <i>it was my fault</i> is entitled to the double payment, since he obligated himself to pay when he could have said <i>it was stolen or lost</i> and been free from liability. So too, a paid guardian or a hirer who said <i>it was stolen</i> is entitled to the double payment, since he obligated himself to pay when he could have said <i>the animal died</i> and been released from liability. The borrower, however, is not entitled to the double payment unless he has actually paid voluntarily. If he had paid before the thief was discovered, the latter must make the fourfold or fivefold restitution to the borrower.",
            "Whoever is entitled to the double payment is entitled to the spontaneous increase in value. If, for example, a man deposited four measures of grain with another when they were worth one <i>sela</i> and they were stolen or lost, and the bailee said <i>I will rather pay a sela than take an oath</i>, and then they were discovered and found to be worth four <i>selas</i>, they belong to the bailee, and he pays only one <i>sela</i> to the owner.— —"
