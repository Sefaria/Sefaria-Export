For example, if one of those from whom his father would inherit dies after his father's death, the firstborn and regular son inherit that one's estate as one [i.e. on equal footing].

What is an example [of this law]?  [If] there were two brothers, one an adult and one a minor, and the minor was taken captive or fled, [the court] does not [appoint] the adult  [brother as a sharecropper] of [the minor's] field, since the minor [brother] cannot protest [effectively if] the [adult] brother takes possession [of the field] and after [some] years claims, \"This is my portion that I received in my own inheritance and it is in my possession because of [my own] inheritance.\"  Even a nephew of this minor who was taken captive is not given the property [in a share-cropping arrangement], lest he say that, \"I inherited this portion because of my [own] father.\""
