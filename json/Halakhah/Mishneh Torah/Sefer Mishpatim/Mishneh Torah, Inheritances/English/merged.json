            "Following is the order of legal heirs: If a man died, his children are his heirs; they have priority over anyone else; the males have priority over the females.",
            "A female does not share an inheritance with a male. If a man died without leaving children, his father inherits his property; the mother does not inherit from her children. This rule is based upon tradition.",
            "Whoever has priority in the order of heirs, his descendants have priority likewise. Accordingly, if anyone died, man or woman, leaving a son, he inherits everything. If there is no son living, we look carefully into the son's descendants, males or females ; even the son's daughter's daughter's daughter, to the end of the line, shall inherit everything. If the son left no descendants, we resort to the daughter, who inherits everything. If there is no daughter living, we look to the daughter's descendants, males or females, to the end of the line, who shall inherit everything. If his daughter left no offspring, the inheritance returns to his father. If his father is not living, we look to the father's offspring, being the brothers of the deceased. If he had a brother, or the descendant of a brother, he shall inherit everything; if not, we resort to the sister. If the deceased had a sister living, or her children, they shall inherit everything.— — In this manner the inheritance keeps ascending to the beginning of the generations. Accordingly, there is no man in Israel without an heir."
