            "One who makes a partial admission is not obligated to take an oath until he admits something he could have denied. How so? The plaintiff claimed that he was owed one hundred Dinars, fifty in this bill and fifty without, and the defendant responded \"I do not owe you but this fifty in the bill\" -- he is not one who has made a partial admission, for his denial of the bill shall have no effect, and all his assets are security for the loan, and if he denied he would still have to pay, therefore he takes a rabbinic oath on the [remaining] fifty."

            ". . . There are Geonim who rules that even though the owner did not bring witnesses [to testify] that this is his item, since he saw his item in the possession of the craftsman and the craftsman agrees that with him that [the item] was his but [says that] he sold it to the owner, we believe [the owner]. But if [the craftsman] says, \"These things never happened, the item is mine,\" we believe the craftsman and he takes the customary oath (<i>shevuat hesset</i>). If the owner brings witnesses [who testify] that the item was known to be his, we do not believe the craftsman. This ruling is incredible in my eyes. ",
