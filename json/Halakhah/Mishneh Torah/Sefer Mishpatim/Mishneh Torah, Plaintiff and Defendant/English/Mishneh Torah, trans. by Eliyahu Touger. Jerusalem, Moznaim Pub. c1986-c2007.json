            "When a person who issues a claim against a colleague with regard to movable property, and the defendant acknowledges a portion of the claim, he must pay what he acknowledged, and take an oath with regard to the remainder. This is a Scriptural obligation, as Exodus 22:8 states: \"That this is it.\"<br>Similarly, if the defendant denies the entire obligation and says: \"Such a thing never happened,\" and one witness testifies that the defendant is obligated to the plaintiff, the defendant is obligated by Scriptural Law to take an oath. The Oral Tradition teaches: Whenever two witnesses would obligate the person to pay money, one witness obligates him to take an oath.<br>Similarly, it was derived through the Oral Tradition that one witness shall not rise up against any man for any iniquity or any sin. He may, however, rise up against him to obligate him to take an oath.",
            "There are only three individuals who are obligated by Scriptural Law to take an oath: a person who denied a portion of a claim of movable property, a person obligated by one witness, and a watchman. For with regard to a watchman, Exodus 22:10 states: \"The oath of God shall be between them.\" We have already explained the oath required of watchman in <i>Hilchot Sechirut</i>.<br>Each of these three individuals takes an oath and becomes free of his obligation to pay. In contrast, those who take an oath and collect the money they claim, e.g., an employee, a person who was injured, a person who impairs the legal power of his promissory note and the like, and similarly, those who take an oath because there is a possibility of a claim being lodged against them, e.g., partners and sharecroppers, all take oaths because of our Sages' ordinances. Although all these oaths were ordained by Rabbinic decree, they all resemble a Scriptural oath, and all must be taken while holding a sacred article.",
            "A defendant is not liable to take a Scriptural oath when a colleague claims that he owes movable property and the defendant:<br>a) denies the entire matter, saying: \"Such a thing never occurred\";<br>b) admitted a portion of the claim and gave it to him immediately, saying: \"This is all I owe you; here it is\";<br>c) admits that he had originally owed the plaintiff the debt, but claims that the plaintiff waived payment, gave him the object claimed as a present, or that he already returned the debt;<br>d) admits owing barley, while the plaintiff claims wheat.<br>Nevertheless, the Sages of the <i>Gemara</i> ordained that in all these situations, the defendant should take a <i>sh'vuat heset</i>, before being freed of liability. This oath does not resemble a Scriptural oath, because one need not hold a sacred article while taking it. We have already described the process of taking a Scriptural oath and that of taking a <i>sh'vuat heset</i> in <i>Hilchot Sh'vuos</i>.",
            "Whenever anyone is required to take an oath by Scriptural Law, he may take the oath and free himself of obligations. If he does not desire to take the oath, we attach his property and expropriate everything the plaintiff claims. For the plaintiff will say: \"I will not budge from the Torah's ruling. Either take the oath or pay me.\" He may, however, have a conditional ban of ostracism issued against anyone who makes a false claim. He must then pay.<br>Different laws apply when, by contrast, a person is obligated to take an oath by Rabbinic degree. If he was one of those who must take an oath and collect his due, he cannot reverse the oath and require the defendant to take it. For the defendant will tell him: \"Take the oath and collect as the Sages ordained for you.\" If he does not desire to take an oath, he should depart.<br>My masters ruled that if the plaintiff says: \"I do not desire the ordinance which the Sages ordained on my behalf. Instead, I am no different than any other plaintiff,\" he may require the defendant to take a <i>sh'vuat heset</i>. If the defendant desires to reverse this oath and require the plaintiff to take it, we obligate the plaintiff to take the oath or to depart.",
            "If a defendant was obligated by Rabbinic decree to take an oath to be released from responsibility, e.g., those who must take an oath because of a doubt or those required to take a <i>sh'vuat heset</i>, and he did not want to take an oath, he is placed under a ban of ostracism for 30 days. If he does not come and seek to be released from his ban, he is given stripes for rebellious conduct.<br>Similarly, whenever a person has been placed under a ban of ostracism for 30 days, he is given stripes for rebellious conduct and then his ban is lifted. His property is not attached, because he is not required to take an oath by Scriptural Law.",
            "Whenever a person is obligated to take a <i>sh'vuat heset</i>, if he desires, he may reverse the oath and obligate the plaintiff. The plaintiff may take the <i>sh'vuat heset</i> and then collect his claim from his colleague.<br>There is no other person who takes a <i>sh'vuat heset</i> and collects his claim from his colleague except this person for whom the obligation to take a <i>sh'vuat heset</i>. A Scriptural oath and a Rabbinic oath that resembles a Scriptural oath may not be reversed.",
            "A person cannot be required to take a <i>sh'vuat heset</i> unless a definite claim is lodged against him. If, however, the plaintiff's claim is doubt, the defendant is not liable for the oath.<br>What is implied? The plaintiff says: \"It appears to me that you owe me a <i>maneh</i>,\" \"I lent you a <i>maneh</i>, it appears to me that you did not repay me,\" \"My father said that you owe me a <i>maneh</i>, \"My father declared to me in the presence of witnesses that you owe me a <i>maneh</i>,\" \"A certain article was stolen from my house. You were the only person there. In my eyes, it is likely that you stole it,\" \"I calculated the money I have and I found that I was lacking some. Perhaps you caused me to err in the accounting,\" and to all these complaints, the defendant states: \"I do not owe you anything,\" he is not liable even for a <i>sh'vuat heset</i>. The same applies in all analogous situations.",
            "The defendant is required to take a <i>sh'vuat heset</i> in the following situations. The plaintiff claims: \"You definitely owe me a <i>kor</i> of wheat,\" and the defendant replies: \"I don't know. Maybe I owe you, maybe I do not owe you,\" the defendant must take a <i>sh'vuat heset</i> that he does not know of the obligation. He is then released. He is not liable, because he did not definitely obligate himself. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.<br>Similarly, if the plaintiff claims: \"You definitely owe me a <i>kor</i> of wheat,\" and the defendant replies: \"I don't know whether I owe you a <i>kor</i> of wheat or barley,\" the defendant must take a <i>sh'vuat heset</i> that he does not know and pay the plaintiff a <i>kor</i> of barley. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.",
            "Different rules apply when the plaintiff claims: \"You definitely owe me a <i>maneh</i>,\" and the defendant replies: \"I did owe you a <i>maneh</i>. I do not know, however, if I returned it to you or did not return it to you yet.\" The defendant is obligated to pay. The plaintiff is not obligated to take an oath at all, not even a <i>sh'vuat heset</i>.<br>The rationale is that the defendant knows that he was liable and the plaintiff is lodging a definite claim against him, and he does not know whether he fulfilled his obligation or not. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.<br>This stringency does not apply if there is no plaintiff, i.e., on his own initiative, the defendant said: \"I stole from you...\", \"You lent me a <i>maneh</i>...\", \"Your father entrusted me with a <i>maneh</i>, and I do not know if I returned it to you or not, he is not liable at all. If he desires to fulfill his moral and spiritual obligations, he is liable to make restitution.",
            "As mentioned above, a <i>sh'vuat heset</i> can be reversed. Thus if a plaintiff claims: \"You owe me a <i>maneh</i>,\" and the defendant responds: \"I do not owe you anything,\" the plaintiff may tell him: \"Take a <i>sh'vuat heset</i> and go on your way.\" And the defendant may respond: \"You take the <i>sh'vuat heset</i> and collect your claim.\" If the plaintiff says: \"I do not desire to take the oath,\" the defendant may tell him: \"Either take the oath and collect your claim or go away without anything.\" The obligation to take the oath may not be reversed again. The plaintiff may, however, have a conditional bill of ostracism issued against anyone who owes him money and refuses to pay.",
            "My masters ruled that anyone who is obligated to take an oath - whether a Scriptural oath or a Rabbinic oath, even a <i>sh'vuat heset</i> - may, before taking the oath, have a conditional ban of ostracism issued against anyone who lodges a claim against him for money which he does not owe so that he will have to take an oath unnecessarily. The person requiring him to take the oath must answer <i>Amen</i>. Afterwards, the defendant must take that oath.<br>This is a proper ordinance for litigants so that they will refrain from making false claims and not cause God's name to be mentioned for no purpose, thus preventing them from lodging spurious suits.",
            "Whenever a person is required to take an oath - whether a Scriptural oath or a Rabbinic oath - the plaintiff can require him to include in his oath a denial of any other claim that he desires which would obligate the defendant financially.<br>To what extent can he be forced to include a claim? Until the plaintiff has him include in the oath that he was not sold to the plaintiff as a Hebrew servant and is still under his bond.<br>As mentioned, a worker who is required to take an oath cannot be forced to include other claims in that oath.",
            "The following principle applies whenever a person is obligated to take an oath, even a <i>sh'vuat heset</i>, and the plaintiff begins to demand that he include in the oath matters which were not included in the original claim. If the defendant sees this and says: \"I do not desire to take the oath. Instead, I will pay the original claim whose denial obligated me to take the oath,\" we do not accept his request. Instead, we tell him: \"Either pay all the definite claims he asked you to include in the oath or take the oath and be released of responsibility.\"",
            "When a person lodges many claims against a colleague, the defendant cannot be forced to take an oath on each claim individually. Instead, he includes all the claims in one oath. If a person was obligated to take two oaths on two different claims, one lenient and one more severe, he is required to take the more severe oath and include in it the other claims based on the principle of <i>gilgul sh'vuah</i>.",
            "When a person lodges a claim against a colleague which would not result in a financial obligation if he would acknowledge its truth, even if the defendant denies the claim, we do not require him to take a <i>sh'vuat heset</i>, nor do we issue a conditional ban of ostracism.<br>What is implied? The plaintiff claims: \"You promised to give me a <i>maneh,</i>\" and the defendant states: \"That never happened,\" the defendant is not required to take a <i>sh'vuat heset</i>, nor is a conditional ban of ostracism issued against him. The rationale is that even were he to have acknowledged making such a promise, he would not be obligated to fulfill it. Similarly, if a plaintiff claimed: \"You cursed me,\" or \"You spread a disparaging report about me,\" and the defendant replied: \"That never happened,\" a ban of ostracism is not issued in such a situation. Similar principles apply in all analogous situations.",
            "If a plaintiff claims: \"You injured me,\" and the defendant states: \"That never happened,\" the defendant is required to take a <i>sh'vuat heset</i>. The rationale is although the defendant is not liable to pay a <i>k'nas</i> because of his own admission alone, he would be liable to pay the injured party for his unemployment, his medical expenses, and the embarrassment he suffered.<br>The following rule applies when a plaintiff claims: \"You embarrassed me,\" and the defendant states: \"That never happened.\" If they were in a place where claims involving <i>k'nasot</i> were collected, the defendant is required to take a <i>sh'vuat heset</i>, for if he would acknowledge the truth of the claim, he would be required to pay for the embarrassment he caused.",
            "When do we apply the above statement: \"A person who admits his guilt with regard to a claim involving a <i>k'nas</i> is not liable\"? When the defendant says: \"I injured this person.\"<br>If, however, the defendant says: \"I injured this person. He brought witnesses against me in court and it obligated me to pay so and so much for his damages,\" he is liable. Accordingly, were the plaintiff to claim that a court obligated the defendant to pay him 100 <i>dinarim</i> because he injured him, and the defendant denied the claim, the defendant would be required to take a <i>sh'vuat heset</i>. Similar principles apply in all analogous situations."

            "Whenever it is suspected that a person might take a false oath, no oath - neither a Scriptural oath, a Rabbinic oath, nor a <i>sh'vuat heset</i> - is administered to him. Even if the plaintiff desires that he take this oath, we do not heed his request.",
            "A person who took a false oath - whether a <i>sh'vuat bitui</i>, a <i>sh'vuat edut</i>, or a <i>sh'vuat hapikadon</i> - or an unnecessary oath, he is considered suspect to take a false oath.<br>Similarly, a person who is not acceptable to serve as a witness because he committed a transgression, whether disqualified because of a Scriptural prohibition, e.g., a person who lends at interest, one who eats meat from an animal that was not ritually slaughtered, or a thief, or because of a Rabbinic prohibition, e.g., a dice-player or a dove racer, is considered suspect to take a false oath and we do not administer an oath to him.",
            "A person is not deemed suspect to take a false oath until witnesses testify that he violated the transgression for which he is disqualified. Different rules apply, however, if a person himself admits that he is suspect to take a false oath, because he committed a transgression that disqualifies him.<br>We consider him under suspicion and it is not appropriate to make him a witness at the outset. Nevertheless, if he is obligated to take an oath, we administer that oath. For we tell him: \"If you are telling the truth, take the oath. The fact that you committed a sin does not make it forbidden for you to take a truthful oath. And if you are lying, acknowledge the other litigant's claim.\" When a person is deemed suspect because of the testimony of witnesses, we do not believe that he will take a truthful oath.",
            "Our Sages ordained that whenever a person who is suspect to take a false oath is obligated to take a Scriptural Oath because of a definite claim, the plaintiff is given the option of taking a Rabbinic oath and may then collect what he claims.<br>If they were both suspect, the responsibility for taking the oath returns to the one obligated to take it, i.e., the defendant. Since he cannot take the oath, he is required to pay.<br>If the person who was suspect was a watchman who claims that the entrusted article was lost or stolen, the plaintiff cannot take an oath, because he does not have a definite claim that the watchman consumed it. Therefore, if the owner of the entrusted object claims: \"He used my entrusted article for his own purposesin my presence,\" or \"I know that he was negligent,\" the plaintiff may take an oath as ordained by our Sages and collect the money he claims.",
            "The following laws apply if the person suspect to take a false oath was liable to take a Rabbinic oath. If he is one of those who takes an oath and collects, he may not take the oath and collect. Instead, the defendant is allowed to take a <i>sh'vuat heset</i> and then is freed of liability.<br>Similarly, when a person who is suspect impairs the legal power of his promissory note or the like and the borrower claims to have paid and requires the plaintiff to take an oath, the defendant is given the option of taking the oath, and in that way becoming released from the obligation of the promissory note.",
            "If the person who is suspect was one of those who is required to take an oath because of an indefinite claim, he is not allowed to take the oath, nor does the plaintiff take the oath. The rationale is that the defendant was not obligated to take an oath by Scriptural Law and the plaintiff is not lodging a definite claim against him that he could support with an oath.",
            "When a person who is suspect becomes obligated to take a <i>sh'vuat heset</i>, the plaintiff is not given the option of taking the oath and collecting what he claims. The rationale is that a <i>sh'vuat heset</i> is itself a measure ordained for the benefit of the plaintiff. Therefore we did not ordain a second measure for his benefit. Instead, the defendant is released from liability without taking an oath.",
            "When a person is obligated to take a <i>sh'vuat heset</i> and the plaintiff is suspect to take a false oath, the defendant does not have the option of reversing the responsibility to take the oath. For the plaintiff is unable to take the oath. Instead, the defendant must pay the claim or take a <i>sh'vuat heset</i>.<br>We do not accept his request to make the judgment dependant on an impossible factor. This is comparable to a person who seeks to reverse the responsibility of an oath and place it upon a minor. We do not heed him. Instead, he must either take a <i>sh'vuat heset</i> or pay.",
            "The following principle applies when a person was obligated to take an oath - whether of Scriptural or Rabbinic origin - and he took the oath and either collected his claim or was released and afterwards, witnesses came and testified that he was suspect to take a false oath. The oath which he took is of no consequence. The other litigant may expropriate the money which the person who was suspect collected from him or the other litigant may take an oath and collect his claim.",
            "These principles are applied with regard to a person suspect of taking a false oath until he receives lashes in court. If there are witnesses that he received lashes and repented, his status is restored and he is acceptable both as a witness and to take an oath.",
            "The following rules apply when a person lodges a claim against a colleague, the defendant denies the claim and supports his denial by taking either a Scriptural oath or a Rabbinic oath. If afterwards, witnesses come and testify that he took a false oath, he must pay the claim and is deemed suspect of taking a false oath.<br>We already explained in <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i>, that anyone who takes a false oath with regard to money belonging to his colleague and repents must add an additional fifth.",
            "The following rule applies when a plaintiff claims that a defendant owes him a debt which was undertaken in the presence of witnesses and affirmed by a <i>kinyan</i>, and the defendant agrees that originally this was so, but claims to have paid the debt, or the defendant says: \"I do not owe you anything,\" and takes an oath to support either of these claims. If, afterwards, witnesses to the <i>kinyan</i> testify or the plaintiff produces a promissory note and verifies its authenticity, the defendant is obligated to pay. He is not, however, considered as suspect to take a false oath. For the witnesses did not testify that he did not pay. And the defendant did not say: \"This never happened.\" Similar principles apply in all analogous situations."

            "A person who admits a portion of a claim is not liable to take a Scriptural oath until he admits an obligation of a <i>p'rutah</i> or more and denies owing two silver <i>me'in</i> or more.<br>How much is a <i>p'rutah</i> worth? The weight of half a barleycorn of pure silver. How much is two <i>me'in</i> worth? The weight of 32 barleycorns of pure silver.",
            "Whenever the Torah speaks of <i>kessef</i> it refers to a holy <i>shekel</i> which is worth 20 <i>me'in</i>. Whenever the term <i>kessef</i> is used with regard to Rabbinic law, the intent is a coin used in Jerusalem referred to as a <i>sela</i>. This coin was one eighth silver and the remainder copper as we explained. A <i>meah</i>, by contrast, even in Jerusalem was pure silver; it was the smallest silver coin used in Jerusalem in that era.<br>Since the requirement that the claim denied be two measures of silver is Rabbinic in origin, the Sages established it as two silver coins of Jerusalem, i.e., two <i>me'in</i>, rather than two \"holy\" <i>shekalim</i>. This is the interpretation that appears correct with regard to the amount of money from the claim that must be denied for an oath to be required.<br>My teachers ruled that the amount of money from the claim that must be denied for an oath to be required is 19 and ½ barleycorns of silver. I have several proofs to refute the path of reasoning they adopted which led to their arriving at this figure. I think that it is an error.",
            "When the plaintiff claims: \"You owe me two <i>me'in</i> and a <i>p'rutah</i>,\" and the defendant responds: \"I owe you only two <i>p'rutot</i>,\" he is not obligated to take this oath. The rationale is that he denied owing less than two <i>me'in</i>.<br>When the plaintiff claims: \"You owe me a <i>maneh</i>,\" and the defendant responds: \"I owe you only half a <i>p'rutot</i>,\" he is not obligated to take this oath. The rationale is that whenever a person acknowledges a debt of less than a <i>p'rutah</i>, it is as if he did not acknowledge any debt at all.",
            "When the plaintiff claims: \"You owe me 100 dates,\" and the defendant responds: \"I owe you only ninety,\" we make calculations. If the ten dates that he denies are worth two <i>me'in</i>, he must take an oath. If they are not, he is not liable.<br>When the plaintiff claims: \"You owe me five or six nuts,\" and the defendant responds: \"I owe you only one,\" we make calculations. If the nut that he admits owing is equivalent to <i>p'rutah</i>, he must take an oath. If it is not, he is not liable. Similar principles apply in all analogous situations.",
            "When does the above apply? With regard to money, merchandise, produce, or the like. With regard to utensils, by contrast, we do not evaluate their worth. Even when ten needles are being sold for a <i>p'rutah</i>, if a plaintiff claims two needles and the defendant admits owing one and denies owing the other, he is liable to take an oath.<br>This is derived from Exodus 22:6 which speaks of \"money or utensils....\" Implied is that all utensils are like money.<br>The following rules apply when the plaintiff claims that he is owed both money and utensils and the defendant admits owing the utensils, but denies owing the money. If the money he denies is equivalent to two <i>me'in</i>, he is obligated to take this oath. If not, he is under no obligation. Conversely, if he admits owing the money, but denies owing the utensils, he is liable if he admits owing a <i>p'rutah</i>. Similar principles apply in all analogous situations.",

Even if a person entrusted a <i>p'rutah</i> or the worth of a <i>p'rutah</i> to a colleague and that person claimed that it was lost, he is required to take an oath. Anything less than a <i>p'rutah</i> is not financially significant and the court does not concern itself with it. Similarly, all those who take oaths and collect their claim, they take their oaths and collect any claim equivalent to a <i>p'rutah</i> or more.",

I differ and maintain that the defendant must deny a claim equivalent to two silver <i>me'in</i> for the plaintiff to be required to take an oath as ordained by the Sages to collect his claim.

The rationale is that one can cut away the larger lamp and cause it to weigh only five.<br>Similarly, if the plaintiff claimed being owed a large belt, and the defendant replied: \"I have only a small belt,\" he is not liable.

Even though a defendant admitted a portion of a claim or a witness testified against him, or he served as a watchman and sought to free himself on the basis of one of the claims according to which a watchman is freed of liability, he is not required to take an oath. These concepts are derived from Exodus 22:6, which, with regard to the obligation to take an oath, states: \"When a person will give his colleague\" - this excludes consecrated property - \"money or utensils...\" - this excludes landed property.

Why do we not accept the general answer? Because it is possible that the person is making an error and this will lead to his taking a false oath. For it is possible that he borrowed money as the plaintiff claims and returned the debt to the lender's son or wife, or gave the lender a present of the value of the debt, and thinks that because of this, he is no longer liable for the debt. Hence, the court tells him: \"Why are you saying that you are not liable? Maybe the law would hold you liable and you do not know. Instead, tell the judges the details of the matter, and they will tell you whether or not you are liable.\"<br>Even if the defendant is a wise man of great stature, we tell him: \"You have nothing to lose by responding to his claim and telling us why you are not liable to him, whether it is because nothing of that nature ever happened, or because you were liable and you repaid the debt.

The rationale is that anyone who says: \"I did not borrow,\" is considered to have said: \"I did not repay the debt,\" in the event that witnesses come and establish that he in fact took a loan. Thus, in the above situation, it is as if the borrower said: \"I did not repay the debt,\" despite the fact that witnesses testify that he did. We postulate that the admission of the principal is considered as strong as the testimony of 100 witnesses and the borrower is held liable.

If the plaintiff lodged a claim against him and he denied making these statements, his words are not heeded, and he is required to make restitution on the basis of the testimony of the witnesses. If there was only one witness present when he made his statements, he is required to take an oath, for he made his statement as an admission.<br>If, after the witnesses came and testified, the defendant claimed: \"I made the admission in order not to appear wealthy,\" his word is accepted, but he is required to take a <i>sh'vuat hesset.</i> If the plaintiff was with the witnesses at the time the defendant made the admission, he cannot claim that he made the admission so as not to appear wealthy.

The rationale is that we suspect that the defendant paid him, and despite that, the plaintiff will try to lodge a claim against the defendant with the legal document. When does the above apply?

Similarly, these utensils are made primarily to benefit from renting them out - e.g., large brass pots used for cooking at party halls, bronze jewelry inlaid with gold that are rented for brides to wear.

Therefore, even if people came and testified that a person lent out or rented out such an article on several occasions, their testimony does not negate this presumption, and these utensils are considered to be all other utensils.<br>Proof of this position can be brought from the fact that Ravva expropriated tailor's scissors used to make a cloak, and an <i>Aggadah</i> scroll as articles that were made to be lent or rented out.

We allow him to maintain possession after he takes a <i>sh'vu'at hesset</i> that he purchased the servant from the original owner or the owner gave the servant to him as a present.<br>These rules do not apply to a servant who is a young child and cannot walk on his legs because of his youth. He is considered as other types of movable property. We presume that he is owned by the person in whose domain he is located, and we follow the principle: When a person seeks to expropriate property from a colleague, the burden of proof is upon him.",
            "As we explained, a plaintiff can alter his statements and offer another claim if it is plausible. To apply that concept to the issues at hand: A person issued a claim against a colleague, stating: \"This garment...\", \"This animal...\", or \"This servant that is in your possession belongs to me. It was lent to you,\" \"... it is stolen,\" \"... I entrusted it to you,\" or \"... I rented it to you.\"<br>The defendant claimed, \"No. It is my money. I inherited it.\" The plaintiff then brought witnesses who testified that they know that this article, servant, or animal is known to belong to the plaintiff. The defendant then countered and replied: \"Yes. It was yours, but you gave it to me...\" or \"... you sold it to me. I said: 'I inherited it,' not because I inherited it from my father, but that my ownership is so strong that it is as if I inherited it.\" The defendant's claim is accepted provided that he supports it by taking a <i>sh'vu'at hesset.</i>",

            "Whenever landed property is known to have belonged to a person, we presume that he is the owner even though the property is now in the possession of another person.<br>What is implied? Reuven was using a courtyard as a person would commonly use his own property, living in it, renting it to others, building and tearing down structures. After a while, Shimon came and lodged a claim against him, saying: \"The courtyard that is in your possession belongs to me. I rented it to you,\" or \"... I lent it to you.\"<br>Reuven replied: \"It was yours, but you sold it to me,\" or \"You gave it to me as a present.\"<br>If Shimon does not bring witnesses who testify that it was known to belong to him, Reuven is required to take a <i>sh'vu'at hesset,</i> and he is allowed to retain possession of the courtyard. If, however, Shimon brings witnesses who testify that this field belonged to him, our presumption is that Shimon is the owner. We tell Reuven: \"Bring proof that he sold it to you or gave it to you.\" If he does not bring proof, we force him to leave and establish Shimon as the owner. This law applies even when Reuven does not admit that the field ever belonged to Shimon, because there are witnesses who support Shimon's claim.",

If, however, Reuven brings witnesses who testify that he partook of the produce of this field for three consecutive years and benefited from it in its entirety in the manner in which any person would benefit from that field, we allow Reuven to maintain possession. This applies provided that it was possible for the original owners to know that this person had taken possession of the field, and they did not lodge a protest against him. Reuven must take a <i>sh'vu'at hesset</i> that Shimon sold him the field or gave it to him, and then he is released of all obligation.<br>The rationale for this decision is that we tell Shimon: \"If your claim that you did not sell or give him the property is true, why is this person using your land year after year, when you do not have a legal document stating that it was rented to him or given to him as security for a loan, and yet you have not lodged a protest against him?\"<br>If the plaintiff responds to this by claiming that the news that the other person was using his property did not reach him because he was in a distant country, we tell him: \"It is impossible that the information did not reach you in three years. And when the information reached you, you should have lodged a protest in the presence of witnesses, telling them that 'So-and-so stole property from me, and in the future I will lodge a claim against him in court.' Since you did not issue a protest, you caused yourself a loss.\"<br>Therefore, if there was a war or a disruption of travel routes between the place where Reuven was located and the place where Shimon was located, we expropriate the property from Reuven even if he benefited from its produce for ten years. We return it to Shimon, because he could say: \"I did not know that this person was using my property.\"",

You have lost your rights.\"<br>If Shimon claims: \"I was very much occupied at the business fair and I did not know that so-and-so was in my courtyard,\" his claim is respected. For it is possible that a person will be occupied at a business fair for 30 days. If he stayed for more than 30 days and did not protest, he loses his rights.<br>It appears to me that this law applies only in the villages, for the people there are very much occupied with their business fairs.",
            "Why do we not tell Reuven: \"If it is true that he sold the property to you or gave it to you as a present, why did you not take care of your deed of acquisition?\" Because a person does not take care of his legal documents for his entire life, and it is an established presumption that a person will not take care of a legal document for more than three years. If by that time, he sees that no one is protesting his ownership, he will not take care of it any longer.",

And it is an established presumption that word of the protest reached you. Hence, since you know that he lodged a protest against you within the three years, if it is true that you had a deed of acquisition and you did not safeguard it, you caused yourself a loss.\"",

For a person will ultimately speak of a matter that he was not charged to keep private.<br>Similarly, if the original owner told the witnesses: \"Don't tell the person who took possession of the property about my protest,\" or the witnesses said on their own volition: \"We will not notify him,\" the protest is of consequence.

If he claims that I sold it to him or gave it to him as a present, I will lodge a claim against him in court.\" Similarly, if he makes other analogous statements, the protest is of consequence even though he did not issue it in the country where the person in possession of the land is located.<br>If, however, he told them merely: \"So-and-so who is using my field is a robber,\" that is not a valid protest, for Reuven will say: \"When I heard this, I said to myself: 'Maybe he was merely slandering me.' Therefore, I was not careful about keeping my deed of acquisition.\"",

If he does not bring a deed of sale, we require that the field be returned to its owner. An oath is not required, for a <i>sh'vu'at hesset</i> was ordained only when the plaintiff was Jewish.<br>When a Jew claims a property on the basis of the claim of a gentile, he is governed by the same laws as the gentile, and the fact that he benefited from the property is not significant.",

A person benefited from property inherited by a minor for one year in the minor's presence before the minor attained majority, and for two years after he attained majority. Although he claims: \"You sold it to me\" or \"You gave it to me,\" his claim is not accepted unless he benefits from the property for three consecutive years after he attains majority.",

Hence, the person in possession may collect what he claims from the property' s increase in value. The property itself is then returned to the orphans.<br>If, however, the property is reputed to belong to the orphans, the claim of the person in possession is not accepted. The rationale is that a claim of ownership cannot be established over property belonging to a minor. Instead, the field and all the produce that the person used must be returned to the orphans. When they come of age, the plaintiff will lodge a claim against them. 6",

Even if the person in possession of it derived benefit for several years and claimed that he purchased it, the fact that he derived benefit is not significant. We do not tell the owner of the field: \"Why didn't you protest?\" For the answer is obvious; he was concerned over his life. If, however, a person flees because of financial matters, he is considered like any other person. Thus, if he does not protest, a claim of ownership can be established over his property.",

A person benefited from the land for a portion of the period necessary to establish a claim of ownership during the lifetime of the woman's husband, and for three years after the husband's death. If he claims: \"You and your husband sold it to me,\" he is allowed to maintain possession. The rationale is that since the person in possession could say: \"I purchased it from you after the death of your husband\" - for he benefited from it for the amount of time necessary to establish a claim of ownership after the death of her husband and she did not protest his word is accepted with regard to the claim mentioned above.<br>If, however, he benefited from the property for several years during the lifetime of her husband, but did not benefit from it for the amount of time necessary to establish a claim of ownership after the death of her husband, he does not establish a claim of ownership.",

It's mine.\"<br>The person in possession responds: \"I don't know who the owner is. Since no one said anything to me about it. I took possession of it.\"<br>This does not establish a claim of ownership. For he is not claiming that he acquired it, that it was given to him, or that he inherited it.

The person in possession produces a deed of sale that he purchased it from the protester and also brings witnesses who testify that he benefited from the land for enough time to establish a claim of ownership. We tell the person in possession at the outset: \"Validate your deed of sale.\" If the deed of sale is validated, it is preferable, and the judgment is based on the deed of sale.

For witnesses are not concerned with these particulars. If one witness testifies that the person in possession benefited from the property in the first, third and fifth years, and the other testifies that he benefited in the second, fourth and sixth years, their testimonies cannot be linked together.

Afterwards, Levi came and protested Shimon's ownership of the field, claiming that Reuven stole it from him. We do not heed Levi's protest, nor do we pay attention to the proofs he brings concerning his ownership of that field. He has forfeited all of his rights to it. For we tell him: \"How could you serve as a witness to the sale and then come and protest?\"<br>Similar concepts apply if Levi gives testimony in a legal document that speaks of \"the field belonging to Reuven on the east\" or \"... on the north.\" Since he referred to that field as an identification marker for the sake of another person and recorded this testimony in a legal document, he forfeited his right to it and cannot issue a protest concerning it.

When, by contrast, a judge verified the authenticity of the signatures of the witnesses to a bill of sale, he may protest the ownership of a field even though it was mentioned in that bill of sale. The rationale is that he can claim: \"I did not know what was written in the bill of sale.\" For a judge may verify the authenticity of the signatures of the witnesses to a legal document even though he did not read it.

And the witness who testified that he benefited from the property for three years is coming to reinforce the power of the person who benefited.
