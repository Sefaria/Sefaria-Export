                "(10) Anyone who believes in his mind ...  Our master, z\"l, opened his mouth and his tongue in commenting on the Mishna, Avot chapter 4, regarding subsidies given to students and teachers, and even though it seems from his words that most of the great Torah sages of that time, or all of them, did that.  And here also he follows his same reasoning.  And there he cites a proof from Hillel the Elder (Yoma 35b), who was a wood-cutter and studied.  But there is no proof from that example, because that was specifically at the beginning of his studies; because in their times there were thousands and myriads of students, perhaps they gave [subsidies] only to the famous [prominent] among them, or that anyone who was able [to get along] without benefiting [from study] did so.  However, when he [Hillel] achieved wisdom and taught knowledge to the people, would you imagine that he [still] chopped wood?  Likewise the example that he cited of R' Hanina ben Dosa (Ber. 17b) is no proof, for if he had wanted to become wealthy, he would not have needed to ask people, but rather Heaven would have provided for him, as is mentioned in Ta'anit (25a).  But rather he, z\"l, did not want to benefit from this world, and our words apply only to those who do want to benefit from this world except not in a prohibited way.  And Karna (Ket. 105a) who received compensation [for adjudicating cases], for he was an aroma-tester in a wine storage facility, determining which [barrels] were fit to maintain.  That work was good and entailed little effort.  And there is no doubt that one whom God, may He be blessed, has graced with the ability to sustain himself from his work is prohibited from taking compensation.  And Rav Huna, who was a water drawer, Rashi z\"l has already explained that he drew water to irrigate his fields.  There is no disgrace in this, and also, according to this, he had real estate and did not need to take compensation.... Even if that is not the view of our master, but rather it is as his words appear to say in his explanation of the mishnah,\nstill, we know that when the law is uncertain to you, you should follow the minhag. We have seen all sages of Israel,\nfrom before the time of our master and afterward, accept payment from the community. Even if we must admit that the\nlaw follows our master‟s words in his explantion of the mishnah, it is possible that all of the sages of the generations\nagreed to this practice, due to „It is a time to act for Gd; they have annulled Your Torah.‟ Without the available\nsupport of students and teachers, they could not work in Torah appropriately, and Torah would - Gd forbid! - be\nforgotten. When support is available, they can involve themselves in study, and Torah will grow and be strengthened.",
                "(11)  ... And corresponding to the intent to gain wealth it says [Avot 1:13] \"one who makes use of the crown passes away,\" and here are included all sorts of benefiting from words of Torah.  This applies to one who devotes his study from the beginning to these ends, or if he can sustain himself without taking compensation for his study.  But if he studies for the sake of heaven but ultimately cannot sustain himself without accepting compensation, it is permitted....  The principle that emerges is that anyone who lacks a means of sustaining himself may accept his compensation for teaching, whether from the students themselves or from the community.  And it is likewise permitted to take compensation from the public for judging, or from the litigants, after observing the conditions mentioned in the laws of Sanhedrin. And since God has made all this known to us, one might say that our Master's intent here is that one must not cast off the yoke of work in order to sustain oneself from other people in order to study, but rather one should learn a trade that sustains him; if it suffices for him, well and good, and if not, he may take sufficient from the community, and there is no problem.  This is why he wrote, \"Anyone who takes it into his mind, etc,\" and he cited several mishnayot showing that is proper to study a trade.  And even if we do not say that this is our Master's view, but rather what appears from his words in his Mishna Commentary, we still have the principle that wherever the halacha is weak [uncertain] in your hands, go according to the practice.  And we have seen that all the sages of Israel, before our Master's time and after him were accustomed to take compensation from the public, and even if we affirm that the halacha is according to our Master in the Mishna Commentary, it is possible that all the sages of the generations agreed, based on \"A time to act for God, they have overturned Your Torah\" (Ps. 119:126), for if sustenance for students and teachers were not available, they could not labor in Torah appropriately, and the Torah would be forgotten, God forbid, and it [sustenance] being available, they can engage, and \"He will magnify and glorify Torah.\" (Isa. 42:21) "

                "<b>Just as a person is commanded...and afterward he returns the lost object of his teacher.:</b> In [Bava] Metzia 43a, at the end of the 2nd chapter - It was taught: His father's lost object and his teacher's lost object - his teacher's takes precedence, since his father brings him to life in this world, but his teacher who taught him wisdom brings him to life in the world to come. And if his father is equal to his teacher [in wisdom] - his father's takes precedence.  His father and his teacher were [each] carrying a burden - he lays down his teacher's, and afterward lays down his father's. His father and his teacher were in captivity - he redeems his teacher, and afterward redeems his father.  But if his father is a Sage - he redeems his father, and afterward redeems his teacher. (Bava Metzia 43a)  And the words of our Teacher (Rashi) who wrote here that: if his father is a Sage, even though he is not equal [in wisdom] to his teacher, he returns his [father's] lost object, and afterward returns his teacher's.  It is surprising that this was taught explicitly in our Mishnah that if his father was equal [in wisdom] to his teacher, his father's [lost object] takes precedence.  Therefore clearly if he is not equal, his teacher's takes precedence.  Yet our Teacher himself wrote in Chapter 12 of the Laws of Robbery and Lost Property, \"If he chanced upon [both] the lost object of his teacher and the lost object of his father - if his father was equal to his teacher [in wisdom], his father's takes precedence, but if not his teacher's takes precedence.  And this is characteristic of his teacher, that he learned the majority of his Torah wisdom from him.\" "
