                "And nevertheless the matter needs a solution, as it is impossible that these righteous ones would be divining. And so it appears to me that the divining that the Torah forbade is when one makes his actions depend upon a sign that logic does not suggest will cause benefit or injury to the thing, such as \"bread fell from his mouth,\" or \"a deer blocks him on the way.\" As these [signs] and those similar to them are from the 'ways of the Amorite.' But if one accepts signs that logically indicate a benefit to the thing or its injury; this is not divining. For all business of the world is like that. As behold, the one who says, \"If it rains, I will not go out on the road; but if not, I will go out,\" is not [practicing] divination. Rather it is the way of the world. And Eliezer and Jonathan were making their actions dependent on things similar to this... And when the Gemara cites [them] regarding the prohibition, this is what it is saying: Any divination of the things the Torah forbids, that logically has no impact - anyone who does not rely upon them like these two relied upon something that was permissible, is not [practicing] divination, and it is not forbidden..."

                "Within this prohibition: At the end of the first chapter of Yevamot (13b), if you will ask how can Rambam decide like Abaye against Rava, perhaps you can answer that we only say (as a rule) that halacha is like Rava where they argue according to their own logic, but not where they argue about what someone else said or his logic.  See there.  And Rav David Cohen in a responsum has difficulty with the words of Our Rabbi (Rambam), because when there is in one city a difference of customs, where some have a certain custom and others have a different custom, this creates a situation of two courts.  But they are not truly two courts in every matter and instance.  And it is possible that for this reason he was exacting in his language.  He did not say that two courts in one city should not each practice its own custom, rather he wrote that there should not be two courts in one city, because once they each practice different customs, they are akin to two courts.  It is also possible that there is an error in the text, and it should read 'it should not be _like_ there are two courts', and copyists left out the 'like'."
