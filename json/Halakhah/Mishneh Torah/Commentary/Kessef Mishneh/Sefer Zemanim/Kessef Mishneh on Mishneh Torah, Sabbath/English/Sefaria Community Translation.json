                "One who cuts a vegetable: Ramakh wrote that [Rambam] should have explained that it is specifically referring to a vegetable that isn't eaten raw, such as garlic and similar then it would be permissible to cut it like bread. This would avoid the question from the case of snipping vegetables on Yom Kippur, which is permissible (Shabbat 114b). This needs [further] review. "
