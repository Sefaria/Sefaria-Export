                "\nThe prayer of the public is always heard, and even if they are sinners, the Holy One, blessed be He, is not fed up with the prayers of many. It is also said that they have multiplied prayer, etc. And he said that because many are not sinned, even though the prayers of the criminals within them enjoy the right of many, and therefore one must share himself with the public and not pray individually as long as he can pray with the public. In the language of many people, it is sufficient to hear the following:\nAnd now to pray with the public said earlier and then this. And it seems that \"we must share\" etc., according to the words of Rabbeinu, as it is written that he will not pray for himself alone, only for all of Israel in all that he prays because it is beloved to your neighbor, etc. We are commanded and as obligated to pray with the public, A person who prays for his fellow man and who needs the same thing, etc. For the public prayer is exclusive, because a person is arousing to the other, Only those who were in trouble with him, even though he did not know them,A person will never forget that his prayer is heard at all times, but in the synagogue, and anyone who has a synagogue and does not pray there with the public is called a bad neighbor, and even if only one of them is to pray in the synagogue. And here is everyone who has, etc., a bad neighbor. The Rebbe wrote and does not pray with the public:\nIt seems that the language that [bad] will only want to those who do not fall in his soul fate called whether in good or bad is yes who does not join in prayer with others in the public shows that only for himself alone is demanding God and a bad neighbor that will not raise the concern of others on his heart . And at any time, etc., in the Mishnaic chariot, when the individual prays in the synagogue,"
