The laws mentioned by R<small>ABD</small>., Maimonides mentions in their proper place; here he only enumerates the transgressions for which man and woman are excommunicated. Moreover, he was loathe to add to the number because of the universal aversion among scholars to pronounce ostracism against a scholar, even against one of a universally evil reputation, saying that one of such character long ceased to be counted in among scholars.

Maimonides contends that a scholar releases himself even in a matter where separation is justified, basing his decision on Mo'ed Katan 17a, and Nedarim, 7a. The apparent contradiction of Judah, is no contradiction at all, as Judah bound himself to bring Benjamin back, which is a bond to perform a definite thing, in which case Maimonides does not sanction the release by one's own self. Jacob did not release him, because Judah brought Benjamin back and delivered to Jacob, which was sufficient ground to believe that there was no need for a release. C. G.</i>"
