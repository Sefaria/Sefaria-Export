And it was inquired of them there, do we say that since sesame seeds are significant, [the owner] would exert himself and gather them; and dates and pomegranates, since there is no exertion with them - as they are large - he would gather them; or maybe it is no different. And that is the rule for all that is similar to this. This is explained in our textual variants.  "
