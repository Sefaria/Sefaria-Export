The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> justifies the Rambam's ruling, explaining that capers are considered as the fruits of a tree only with regard to the prohibitions of <i>kilayim</i> and <i>orlah</i>.

Conversely, if he harvested the plants primarily as vegetables, even the seeds should be tithed as such.<br>The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam, questioning why he bases his ruling on the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Shivi'it</i> 2:8) when - the Ra'avad states - that ruling is problematic.

The Ra'avad notes that this ruling is problematic: Since the produce has not reached a third of its growth, why is there a need to tithe it? The Radbaz explains that since the person gathers, it is significant for him, and - as far as he is concerned, it has reached its full growth.</i> If they were harvested after Rosh HaShanah, both the vegetables and the seeds should be tithed as produce of the coming year.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For the vegetables, this ruling is obvious and even for the seeds, it applies because the plants did not reach one third of their growth in the previous year.</i><br>If they were sown to produce seed and then [the owner changed his mind and] thought to use them for vegetables [only], the ruling follows his thought.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And they should be tithed according to when they are harvested.</i> If they were sown to produce vegetables and then [the owner changed his mind and] thought to use them for seed, the thought to use it as seed has no effect on the ruling unless he withholds water from it for three periods<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When produce is grown to be used as a vegetable, it is watered before it is harvested. When it is grown for seeds, it is not (Radbaz). The Ra'avad questions the Hebrew term used by the Rambam. The Radbaz states that it means \"harvests,\" because, as explained above, vegetables are usually watered before they are harvested.</i> when [the plants] would be ordinarily be watered,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For his intent to be significant, it has to be reinforced by a deed.</i> and [then,] only when [the plants] reached a third of their growth before Rosh HaShanah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Otherwise, it would not be appropriate for them to be tithed as produce of the second year.</i><br>[They are, however, governed by different rules] if they did not reach a third of their growth before Rosh HaShanah even though he withheld water from it for three periods when [the plants] would be ordinarily be watered.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad questions the Rambam's ruling in this instance as well and again the Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> justify the Rambam's approach.</i> If he sowed it for the purpose of seed and the entire crop grew into fully grown plants before Rosh HaShanah, the seed is tithed as produce of the previous year<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For they reached a level of growth obligated them to be tithed at that time.</i> and the vegetables are tithed according to when they are harvested.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since he intended to use the plants for vegetables, we do not say that the vegetables are entirely insignificant.</i> If some of the plants reached their full growth and some did not, to this situation, we apply our Sages' statement:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 13b.</i> \"He should gather the entire crop together.\" [Thus he should separate tithes from the entire crop as one,] separating tithes from the seed for the vegetables and from the vegetables as seed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As explained in Halachah 8.</i>",
            "When produce from the second year becomes mixed with produce from the third year or produce from the third year becomes mixed with that of the fourth year, we follow the majority.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the entire quantity of produce is tithed according to the laws governing the majority.

Rav Yosef Korcus differs, explaining that the same logic could be used with regard to the first clause of the halachah, and that ruling is based on an explicit mishnah (<i>Makshirin</i> 2:11). This explanation provides us with a new definition of <i>tevel</i> - produce from which the separations have been made to the best of man's ability.</i> [The rationale is that] the second tithe is a more severe obligation, because it is sacred,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., it is considered as sacred property, as stated in Chapter 3, Halachah 17.</i> while the tithe for the poor is ordinary produce. Similarly, when there is a doubt whether produce is from the second year or from the third year, the second tithe should be separated from it.",
            "Whenever [produce] is exempt from the first tithe, it is also exempt from the second tithe and the tithe for the poor.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Hilchot Ma'aser</i> 1:7.</i> Whenever produce is obligated in the first tithe, it is also obligated in these two.

For [separating] the first [tithe] does not create an obligation to separate the second. If, however, an obligation to tithe was established, it is forbidden to snack from it until he separates the second tithe or the tithe for the poor even though he has already separated the first tithe.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For the prohibition against partaking of <i>tevel</i> applies until all the tithes have been separated.

The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam's ruling, but it is justified by the Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>.</i><br>It appears to me that the second tithe that is separated in Babylonia and in Egypt<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Hilchot Terumot</i> 1:1 which states that our Prophets and Sages ordained that <i>terumah</i> should be separated in these lands.</i> should be redeemed and the proceeds taken to Jerusalem. Similarly, it appears to me that the obligation to separate the second tithe in these places was established only so that there would be an obligation to separate the tithe for the poor, so that the poor of the Jewish people could rely on it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., there was always a substantial Jewish community in these lands and our Sages wanted to provide the poor with an opportunity to receive their livelihood. This provision was not enacted with regard to Syria, because it was relatively close to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and the poor could receive their livelihood from the tithe for the poor separated there (Radbaz).

From the standpoint of the peace offering, it can be said that it does not belong to him, because it is the second tithe which is \"the property of the Most High.\"<br>Alternatively, the explanation of the Rambam's wording depends on a concept explained in <i>Hilchot Arachin, loc. cit.</i>: \"[One is] obligated to add a fifth [when redeeming the article that was] consecrated originally, but one [need] not add a fifth [when redeeming an article] whose consecration was a derivative.\" A derivative means that it was consecrated in the process of redeeming another article (see <i>ibid.</i>:5).<br>To apply those concepts to the question at hand: Since the consecration of the animal as a peace offering comes as part of the redemption of the money from the second tithe, one might think that there is no need to add a fifth. For that reason, the Rambam [based on the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 3:2)] emphasizes that in this instance, the additional fifth is necessary, because since the holiness of the second tithe was removed from it, it is as if it was consecrated initially and it is not considered as a derivative (<i>Rambam LeAm</i>)</i>",

Hence, the Rambam clarifies that this is not so.

He therefore transferred the presents to other sages in the manner described here. Since Rabbi Elazar ben Arach was a priest, he gave him <i>terumah</i>, Rabbi Yehoshua was a Levite and so he gave him the tithes, and since Rabbi Akiva was a collector of gifts for the poor, he gave him the tithes for the poor.</i> he should designate the presents [appropriately]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And specify in which portion of the grainheap they are located.</i> and transfer them to their owners by giving them together with land.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Hilchot Mechirah</i>, ch. 6, which describes how this transfer of property operates.

He may then recite the declaration the following day.<br>[The rationale is] that transferring movable property to a person together with landed property is a present that has been strengthened. He may not, however, transfer [the produce from] the tithes to them via an exchange,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The term \"exchange\" is translated from the Hebrew <i>kinyan chilipin</i>, a legal act that formalizes a transaction.

            "What source teaches that he cannot recite the declaration until he removes all the presents [from his possession]?

            "The presents must be separated according to the desired order<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 3:23 with regard to the desired order of the presents.</i> and afterwards, the declaration is made, as [implied by the continuation of the verse:] \"according to all Your mitzvot which You commanded me.\" Thus if he gives the second tithe before the first tithe, he cannot recite this declaration.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For he cannot say: \"As You commanded me,\" since by deviating from the desired order, he did not fulfill the mitzvot \"as commanded.\" Indeed, he committed a transgression.</i><br>If a person's <i>tevel</i> is burnt, he cannot make this declaration, for he did not separate the presents or give them to the people designated.

Therefore, he punished them, decreeing that the tithes should be given to the priests instead (<i>Hilchot Ma'aser</i> 1:4). From the Rambam's statements here and also in that source, some have inferred that Ezra's decree applied only in his generation and not in later eras. This conclusion is not, however, borne out by his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>ibid.</i> 5:15)].</i> the declaration was not made, [because it contains the words:] \"I gave it to the Levite.\"",

For neither of them must be removed from one's possession at a given time.</i> because <i>terumah</i> [in and of itself] does not require a declaration except as part of all the presents [together].",
            "[The prooftext continues:] \"I did not violate your commandments,\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although the Rambam explains the details of this declaration, the intent is not that one should explain it while reciting it. Instead, he should merely read the passage as it is stated in the Torah [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 5:13)].</i> i.e., he did not separate from one species for another, nor from produce that has been reaped for produce that is still attached to the ground, nor from produce that is attached to the ground for produce that has been reaped, nor from produce from the present year for that of the previous year, nor from produce of the previous year for that of the present year.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 5:18; 5:9, 5:11, and <i>Hilchot Ma'aser</i> 1:12 which explains that separating the presents in such a manner is forbidden.</i><br>[The prooftext continues:] \"I did not forget,\" I did not forget to bless Him and recall His name with regard to them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Some interpret this as referring to the recitation of a blessing when making the separations. The commentaries question these interpretations, however, because the blessings were instituted by the Rabbis and here we are speaking of the exegesis of a Biblical verse. Others maintain that it refers to reciting grace after partaking of the grain, for that is a Scriptural command.</i> \"I did not partake of it in a state of acute mourning\";<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 3, Halachah 5ff.</i> thus if he partakes of it in a state of acute mourning, he does not recite the declaration. \"I did not partake of it in a state of impurity,\" thus if he separates it in a state of acute mourning, he does not recite the declaration. \"I did not give of it to a corpse.\" This implies that he did not use [money from the redemption of the tithes] for a coffin or shrouds, nor did he give it to other people in a state of mourning. \"I heeded the voice of God my Lord,\" i.e., I brought it to the Temple.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to the first fruits.
