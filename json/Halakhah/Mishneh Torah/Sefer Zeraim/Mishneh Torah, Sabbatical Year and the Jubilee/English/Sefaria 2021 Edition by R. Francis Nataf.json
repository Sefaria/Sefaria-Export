            "It is a positive commandment to refrain from working the land and caring for trees in the seventh year, as it is stated (Leviticus 25:2), \"and the land shall rest a Shabbat for the Lord\"; and it is stated (Exodus 34:21), \"from plowing and from harvesting shall you rest.\" Anyone who performs one of the forbidden labors of working the land or caring for trees in this year has negated a positive commandment and transgressed a negative commandment – as it is stated (Leviticus 25:4), \"you shall not sow your field, nor shall you prune your vineyard.\"",
            "One only receives lashes according to the Torah for either sowing, pruning, harvesting or reaping. And it is the same whether it is [done to] a vineyard or other trees.",
            "And pruning is included in sowing; and reaping is included in harvesting. So why did Scripture mention them in particular? To tell you that one is liable specifically for these two subcategories; and that for the other subcategories of working the land – along with the other main categories – one does not receive lashes. Rather we strike him with lashes for rebellion.  ",
            "How is this? We give rabbinic lashes for rebellion to one who digs or plows for the sake of (preparing) the ground, or removes stones or fertilizes and that which is similar to these of the other types of work on the land; and likewise to one who bends [a branch into the ground] or grafts or plants and that which is similar to these of the other types of care for trees. ",
            "We may not plant trees in the seventh year – [not] even a fruitless tree. And one may not cut off growths or remove dry leaves and branches. And he may not sprinkle dust on its top, nor fumigate below it so that the worms will die. And he may not smear the saplings with something that has filth in it, so that the birds do not eat it when it is soft. And he may not smear the young fruit, nor puncture holes into them. And he may not wrap the saplings, nor may he snip them. And he may not cut large branches off the tree. And likewise, all the rest of caring for the tree. And if he did one of all of these in the seventh year, we give him lashes for rebellion.",
            "And one may not kindle a fire in [a place of] thick reeds, because that is working the land. And we may only train a cow to plow in sand. And we may not check seeds in a pot full of dirt, but may rather only check them in a pot full of dung. And we may soak seeds in the seventh year in order to sow them at the culmination of the seventh year; and we may preserve the aloe plant that is at the top of the roof, but we may not water it. ",
            "We may apply red dye [to a tree]; and encumber it with stones and hoe below vines. And [regarding] hoeing lightly under olive trees – if it is to make the tree flourish, it is forbidden; but if it is to seal the fissures, it is permissible. ",
            "We may water an irrigated field in the seventh year – and that is a field for sowing that is very thirsty. And likewise [regarding] a field of trees: If they are at a distance from one another such that there would be ten in a <i>beit seah</i>, we may pull the water from one tree to the next, but they may not water the whole field. But if they were closer to each other than ten to a <i>beit seah</i>, we may water the whole field for their sake. And likewise , may we sprinkle water onto the dirt of a field for trees, for the sake of the trees – such that they will not be lost.",
            "We may construct circular ditches around the  grapevines and we may make a new water channel. And we may fill fissures [in the ground with] water.",
            "And why did they permit all these [acts]? Because if he does not water [the fields at all], the land will turn into a salt marsh and every tree in it will die. And since the prohibition of these things and that which is similar to them is [rabbinic], they did not decree [to forbid] these [things]. As, according to the Torah, only those two main categories and their two subcategories are forbidden – as we explained. ",
            "From when the extorters increased and the kings of the idolaters required that Israel [support] camps for their soldiers, [the Rabbis] permitted sowing on the seventh year – [but] only that which the servants of the king require for themselves. And likewise, one who is forced to work on the seventh year for free – such as with the conscription of the king and that which is similar to it – is allowed to do [so].",
            "[Regarding] one who plants in the seventh year – whether it was inadvertent or volitional – [that plant] is uprooted. For Israel is suspect about the seventh year. [For] if you say, It can be kept, when inadvertent\" – the volitional one will say, \"I was inadvertent.\"",
            "[Regarding] one who plows his field or breaks up [its surface] or fertilizes it on the seventh year, in order that it be proper for sowing at the culmination of the seventh year – we penalize him, such that he may not sow it at the culmination of the seventh year. And it cannot be rented out from him in order that it be sowed. Rather it shall be fallow in front of him. But if he dies, his son may sow it. ",
            "[Regarding] one who removes thorns from his land in the seventh year in order to prepare it for the culmination of the seventh year; or one who removed the stones from it – [the Rabbis] did not penalize him, even though he is not allowed [to do it]. So it is permissible for him to sow it at the culmination of the seventh year. ",
            "One who buries a turnip or radishes and that which is similar to them (to preserve them) in the seventh year – if some of their leaves are uncovered, he need not be concerned [about having transgressed]. But if not, it is forbidden. One who buries leeks and that which is similar to them may not do so with less than four <i>kav</i>, to the height of a handbreadth. He [must then place] a handbreadth of dirt on top of them and bury them in a place that people trample, so that they will not grow. It is permissible to dampen rice, but not to trim [it].",
            "At first, [the Rabbis] would say [that] a person may gather sticks, stones and twigs from his field. And that is when he takes that which is large, in order that he not intend to clean the land. But he may gather [this] from his fellow's field, whether it is small or large. [However,] from when transgressors increased – those who would intend to clean [the land], and say, \"We are [only] taking that which is large\" –  they forbade a person from [gathering] in his field. Rather [he may only do so] in his fellow's field. And that is when he does not gather as a favor – such that he should not say, \"I have done so much good for you; as behold I have cleaned  your field!\"",
            "If his animal was standing in the field, he may gather and bring [the sticks and twigs in the field] in front of it (to eat), since his animal shows [his purpose in this]. And likewise, if his stove was there, he can gather everything and light [it], since his stove shows [his purpose in this].",
            "[Regarding] one who chops down a tree or two, it is permissible to uproot them. [If, however,] he chops down three or more – one next to the other – he may not uproot them. For behold, he is improving the land. Rather he should chop them above the ground and leave their roots in the ground. To what do these words apply? [When he is on] his own [property]. But in his fellow's field, it is permissible to uproot [them].",
            "One who chops [branches] from an olive tree to take it as wood may not cover the place of the cut with dirt, since it is work [on the tree]. Rather he should cover it with stones or straw.",
            "One who trims grape vines or cuts reeds may cut in its [usual] manner – with the axe, sickle or saw, or with whatever he pleases.",
            "We may not chop off [branches of] a virgin sycamore tree on the seventh year in the way that we [do so] in other years; since their being chopped off is work on the tree. For, with this chopping, it will grow and increase. So if he needs its wood, he should chop it off, not in the way of its [usual] work.",
            "How should he chop it? [He should only chop branches that are] even to the ground or higher than ten handbreadths. We may tie up a tree that had split, in the seventh year – not that it should heal, but that [the split] not increase."

            "A person may not remove the manure from his courtyard and place it into his field, on the seventh year, because it appears like he is fertilizing his field so that it be proper for sowing. But if he removed it and stood it into a dungpile, it is permissible. And he should not make a dungpile in his field until the passing of the time (season) in which we fertilize with it for work on the land. And that is from when the \"sweet matter,\" gets knotty. One may not make a dungpile that is less than one hundred and fifty <i>seah</i> of manure, in order that it will be noticeable that it is a dungpile. If he [already] had a little bit, he may add continuously. And one may not make more than three dungpiles in any <i>beit seah</i>.",
            "So one who wants to make all of his field into areas of three dungpiles – [each group] within a [different] <i>beit seah</i> – he may do [so]. And one who wants to make his manure into [one large] store – he [too] may do so.",
            "If one stood up the manure on a boulder, or dug three handbreadths into the ground and piled the manure [into it] or built a platform of three [handbreadths] and stood the manure on top of it – he does not require a requisite measure. Even if he made many dunghills within a <i>beit seah</i> – whether big or small – it is permissible. For the thing is surely recognizable – that they are not for working the land, but rather for storage of the manure. ",
            "It is permissible for a person to remove the manure from his sheep pen and to put it into his field, in the way of all those who collect manure [from their animals]. And someone who makes an enclosure [for the animals] in his field in the seventh year should not make it more than two <i>beit seah</i>; and [then] put his sheep into it. And once they have fertilized all of the enclosure, he leaves [only] one side of the enclosure barriers. Then he makes a different enclosure alongside of [the first one (on the other side of the remaining barrier)]. It comes out that he fertilizes four <i>beit seah</i> of his field [in this way].",
            "If his whole field was [only] four <i>beit seah</i>, he leaves over some of it [and does not allow his animals there], because of improper appearance. [This is] so that all will know that the sheep made droppings in it and it had been enclosed; and they will not say, \"This one fertilized all of his field in the seventh year.\"",
            "A person may not start a quarry in his field in the seventh year, lest they say, \"He intended to improve his field, to remove the bedrock from it.\" But if he began before the seventh year and broke apart twenty-seven stones from [bedrock] that is three by three ells with a height of three ells – each stone being one ell by one with a height of an ell, or larger – it is surely permissible to remove as much as he wants from it during the seventh year. ",
            "[In the case of] a stone fence with a height of ten or more handbreadths, and one wants to take all its stones: If there are ten or more stones, each one of which is a load for two [people] or larger, he may surely take them. For the onlooker will know that he is taking them for the sake of the stones [themselves]. If [the fence] was less than ten, or there were less than ten stones or the stones were smaller than a load for two – he may [only] take them until he [reaches the stones that are] a handbreadth from the ground.",
            "To what do these words apply? When he intended to improve his field (or) he began to take [them] in the seventh year. But if he did not intend to improve his field or began before the seventh year, he may take everything that he wants – in the seventh year – from any part [of it] and raze [it] to the ground. And likewise, if he is taking [them] from the field of his fellow, he may raze [it] to the ground – even if he is contracted.",
            "[In the case of] stones that are fit to be moved by a plow or that were covered and became revealed: If there were two, each of which was a load for two [people], it is surely permissible to take them. If they were smaller than this, he may not take them.",
            "One who removes stones from his field, in the seventh year, because he needs the stones – he may take the upper ones, but he must leave the ones touching the ground. And likewise if he had a pile of pebbles or a pile of stones on his field, he may take the upper ones but must leave the ones touching the ground. However if there is bedrock or straw under them, he may take them all.",
            "A person may not fill a ravine with earth, nor may he fix it with earth, because he is improving the land. But he may make a partition in front of the ravine. And [regarding] any stone which he can stick out his hand and pick it up, while standing at the edge of the ravine – it may surely be taken.",
            "It is permissible to bring shouldering stones – and they are those carried, two or three on the shoulder – from any place, whether from the field of his fellow or from his [own] field. And likewise a contractor [of the field] may bring [them] – and even (small) [large] stones –  from anywhere, whether from a field he contracted or from a field he did not contract. ",
            "[In a case of] a gap (in a wall) that has been blocked with dirt: If it does not make the public stumble, it is forbidden to build it up. But if it did make the public stumble or it was not blocked with dirt, but rather open to the public domain, it is permissible to build it up.",
            "It is forbidden to build a fence between one's field and the field of his fellow in the seventh year; but he may build a fence between himself and the public domain. And it is permissible to submerge it up to the bedrock, and to remove the dirt and gather it into his field in the way of all those who submerge manure. And likewise if he dug a pit, a ditch or a cave in the seventh year – he gathers the dirt into his field in the way of all those that dig [for such purposes]."

And that is at the time that the Temple exists that it was forbidden by the oral tradition. And the Sages ordained that, at the time of the Temple, a field of trees (an orchard) only be plowed until <i>Atzeret</i> (Shavuot) on the eve of the seventh year; and a [grain] field until Pesach. But at the time when there is no Temple, work on the land is permitted until Rosh Hashanah, like the law of the Torah.",

But one may not sell him a field of trees, unless he stipulated with him that [the one suspected] has no [stake] in the trees. And one may lend him a <i>seah</i>-measure with which to measure, even though he knows that he has a threshing floor. For he may surely measure with it in his home. One may exchange coins for him, even though he knows that he has workers. But all these [things] are forbidden [in a case in which] it is expressed explicitly [that they will be used for a forbidden purpose].",

But it is permitted to detach honeycombs with them, and to rent newly plowed land from them (to plant the following year) – since they are not obligated, such that we should penalize them (as we do with Jews in this situation).",

[But] if it fell into less than a hundred, all of it must rot; and it should not be sold to the priests, like [other such mixtures in which the priestly tithe can no longer be removed] – since they are suspected about the seventh year.",

And the Torah was particular about this commandment and called it, \"unrestrained.\" And behold, Scripture added to warn and command not to refrain; but rather to give, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 15:10), \"You must surely give him, and let your heart not hurt when you give him, etc.\" And the Holy One, blessed be He, promised reward in this world for this commandment, as it is stated, \"for because of this thing will He bless you.\""
