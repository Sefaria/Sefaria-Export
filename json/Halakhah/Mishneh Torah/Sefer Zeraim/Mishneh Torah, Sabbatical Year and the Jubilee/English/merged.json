Anyone who performs one of the forbidden labors from the working of the land or caring for trees in this year has abrogated a positive commandment and transgressed a negative commandment, as it says, \"you shall not plant your field, nor shall you prune your vineyard\" (Leviticus 25:4)."

By tradition, this labor is forbidden when the Temple is in existence, but the Rabbis legislated additional restriction, that people should not plow orchards in the eve of Sabbatical year during Temple times except until Shavuot, and grain fields only until Passover. When there is no Temple, it is permitted to work the land until New Year as in the law of the [written] Torah.",
            "What defines an orchard? Three trees in a beit seah (plot of land 50 x 50 cubits), whether a non-fruit-bearing tree or a fruit bearing tree.  Even if they belong to three different people, we view them as if they are fig trees.  If they (fig trees of similar size or maturity) would be capable of producing a dried fig cake weighing sixty talents, it is permitted to plow the entire beit seah for them (the trees), as long as the distance between each tree is sufficient for the ox with its utensils (yoke) to pass [between the trees].",

The year in which they left, when the First Temple was destroyed, happened to be the year following the sabbatical year and the thirty-sixth year of the jubilee, since the First Temple lasted four hundred and ten years. As soon as the Temple was destroyed, this counting ceased. When it ceased, the land remained desolate for seventy years, and then the Second Temple was built. It lasted four hundred and twenty years. Ezra came up [from Babylonia to Judea] in the seventh year of its erection. This was the second coming [to the land]. From that year on, they began to use a different counting. They made the thirteenth year of the construction of the Second Temple to serve as <i>shemittah</i> (year of release), and counted seven <i>shemittoth</i> and hallowed the fiftieth year. Although no jubilee was observed during the period of the Second Temple, they counted its years in conjunction with the <i>shemittoth</i> which they did hallow.",

According to this computation, the present year, the year one thousand one hundred and seven since the destruction, which is the year one thousand four hundred and eighty-seven of the Seleucidan Era, used in dating documents, which is four thousand nine hundred and thirty-six since the Creation, is a sabbarical year and the twenty-first year of jubilee.",

When the people were exiled after the destruction of the First Temple, the sanctity of the walled towns during the period of Joshua ceased to exist.
