The commentaries note that the Rambam's wording in this halachah indicates that the mitzvah is on the person, he should rest. Nevertheless, the wording he uses when enumerating the mitzvot - that \"the land should rest\" - puts the emphasis on the land.</i> in the Sabbatical year, as [Leviticus 25:2] states: \"And the land will rest like a Sabbath unto God\" and [Exodus 34:21] states: \"You shall rest with regard to plowing and harvesting.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The citation of this verse reflects a general principle in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>: that the Rambam will occasionally favor the understanding of a verse proposed by the Jerusalem Talmud even though the Babylonian Talmud interprets it otherwise. To explain: the Babylonian Talmud (<i>Mo'ed Kattan</i> 4a) inteprets this verse as a prohibition to work the land on the Sabbath. It is the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 1:3) which understands it as referring to the Sabbatical year.<br>From Chapter 4, Halachah 1, it appears that here the Rambam is speaking of harvesting for the sake of improving the land, not for gathering its crops. The intent appears to be that harvesting produce will enable the land to produce better produce in the future.</i><br>When a person<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This mitzvah is incumbent both on men and women.</i> performs any labor upon the land or with trees during this year, he nullifies the observance of this positive commandment and violates a negative commandment,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 220) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 326) include this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> as [Leviticus 25:4] states: \"Do not sow your field and do not trim your vineyard.\"",

It must, however, be emphasized that (as stated in Chapter 10, Halachah 9), from the later years of the First Temple period, the observance of the Sabbatical year only had the status of Rabbinic commandment. The Radbaz maintains that such leniency would be granted even if the Scriptural ordinance was in effect.</i> Similarly, if a person of force compelled someone to perform labor in the Sabbatical year without pay, for the service of the king or the like, he may do so.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For since he is being threatened, it makes no difference whether the person threatening him is a king or an ordinary person. Since there is danger involved, leniency is granted (Radbaz, <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> emphasizes that this leniency is granted only when the person does not receive payment for his activity.

In his gloss to the <i>Tur</i>, the <i>Darkei Moshe</i> explains that addition, stating that unless the debtor has taken an oath to support his denial, then we are speaking of an ordinary loan and the conclusion of the Sabbatical year nullifies both the loan and the obligation of an oath to support one's denial, as stated in Halachah 6.</i>",

            "When a Levite inherits the property of his maternal grandfather who is an Israelite,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., a Levite married an Israelite women who gave birth to a son. That son is a Levite. If his maternal grandfather (an Israelite) dies without sons, his mother inherits his property and when she dies, the son who is a Levite inherits it from her.</i> he does not have the redemption rights of a Levite, only those of an Israelite, for the verse \"The Levites will have eternal rights of redemption\" applies only in the cities of the Levites.",
            "The entire tribe of Levi are commanded against receiving an inheritance in the land of Canaan,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 169) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 504) include this commandment with the above interpretation among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> and they were commanded against receiving a share in the spoil when the cities are conquered,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 170) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 505) include this commandment with the above interpretation among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. <i>Sefer HaMitzvot, loc. cit.</i>, elaborates in explanation why the two charges are counted as separate commandments.</i> as [Deuteronomy 10:9] states: \"The priest and the Levites - the entire tribe of Levi - should not have a portion and an inheritance among Israel.\" \"A portion\" [refers to a portion] of the spoil; \"an inheritance\" refers to [a portion of] the land. And [Numbers 18:20]: \"You<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse is addressed to Aaron as the leader of the entire tribe of Levi.</i> shall not receive a heritage in their land, nor will you have a portion among them,\" i.e., in the spoil. If a Levite or a priest takes a portion of the spoil, he is punished by lashes.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Radbaz states that it would appear that this applies only when one has destroyed the portion that he took. If, however, it can be returned, it should be returned and he is not subjected to lashes. (This is also the view of <i>Sefer HaChinuch, loc. cit.</i>) Nevertheless, the Radbaz concludes that it is possible to say that one may not compensate for this prohibition by making financial restitution and hence, lashes are required in all circumstances.</i> If he takes an inheritance in <i>Eretz [Yisrael]</i>, it should be taken from his possession.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For land can never be misappropriated from its rightful owners. Hence, his taking it is of no consequence and therefore, he is not punished (Radbaz).</i>",
            "It appears to me<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This phrase introduces a ruling that the Rambam arrived at through deduction, without any explicit, prior Rabbinic source.</i> that the above applies only with regard to the land for which a covenant was established with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, their descendants inherited it and it was divided among them. If, however, other lands will be conquered by a king of Israel, the priests and the Levites have the same rights as the entire Jewish people.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's statement, stating that if so, the priests and the Levites would not have the rights to <i>terumah</i> and the tithes in these lands, for (see the following halachah and <i>Hilchot Bikkurim</i> 105), these presents were given to the priests instead of an ancestral portion. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> strengthens the Ra'avad's argument, noting that were it not for a special Divine commandment, the priests and the Levites would not have been given a portion of the spoil gained in the war against Midian. Nevertheless, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> as well as the Radbaz explain that the spoils from the war against Midian can be used as a source to teach that similar concepts apply with regard to other wars.</i>",
            "Why did the Levites not receive a portion in the inheritance of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and in the spoils of war like their brethren? Because they were set aside to serve God and minister unto Him and to instruct people at large in His just paths and righteous judgments, as [Deuteronomy 33:10] states:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Moses' blessing to the tribe of Levi.</i> \"They will teach Your judgments to Jacob and Your Torah to Israel.\" Therefore they were set apart from the ways of the world. They do not wage war like the remainder of the Jewish people, nor do they receive an inheritance, nor do they acquire for themselves through their physical power. Instead, they are God's legion, as [<i>ibid.</i>:11]: states: \"God has blessed His legion\" and He provides for them, as [Numbers 18:20] states: \"I am your portion and your inheritance.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam cites the first portion of this verse in Halachah 10 as proof that the Levites are not entitled to a portion of the spoil nor an ancestral heritage in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. In this halachah, he explains the rationale for that exclusion. The Levites are set aside from material involvement so that they can devote themselves to the spiritual. God, however, promises that this exchange will not cause them any loss, for He will provide for their material needs.</i>",
            "Not only the tribe of Levi, but any one of the inhabitants of the world<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This wording could also imply gentiles.</i> whose spirit generously motivates him and he understands with his wisdom to set himself aside and stand before God to serve Him and minister to Him and to know God, proceeding justly as God made him, removing from his neck the yoke of the many reckonings which people seek, he is sanctified as holy of holies.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This expression is used by I Chronicles 23:12 to refer to the holiness of Aaron, the High Priest. The Rambam is implying that every individual can reach a similar level of holiness.</i> God will be His portion and heritage forever and will provide what is sufficient for him in this world like He provides for the priests and the Levites.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the Rambam is explaining that the motif that applies with regard to the priests and the Levites can be extended and in truth applies with regard to any person who is willing to devote his life to God's service.</i> And thus David declared [Psalms 16:5]: \"God is the lot of my portion; You are my cup, You support my lot.\"<br>Blessed be the Merciful One who provides assistance."
