            "A positive commandment to bring the first ripe fruit to the temple. This is not custom to bring except to the temple and in the land of Israel, as it says (Exodus 23:19, 34:26): \"Beginning of the fruit of your land you shall bring to the house of Hashem your G-d\". And those who bring first fruit from the cities of Sichon and Og and from Syria. For one who buys from Syria is as if buying from Jerusalem. [But from Amon, Moab and Babylonia], even though they are obligated in Tithes, they are not brought for Bikkurim. And if one brought Bikkurim from outside of the land of Israel, they are not considered Bikkurim.",
            "One does not bring Bikkurim except for the seven species which are praiseworthy to the land. They are: Wheat, Barley, Grapes, Figs, Pomegranates, Olives, and Dates. If one brought not from these seven species of fruit, they were not sanctified."

So too, priests and levites bring and read because they have open cities."

            "At this time, when there is no pure dough because of impurity from contact with the dead, <i>challah</i> is separated once in all Israel, [which is] 1/48th, and it is burned because it is impure. And this has a foundation from the Torah.  But from Keziv to Amanah, a second <i>challah</i>is separated and given to the priest, but this has no required amount, as was the matter in the past.",
            "Since its main obligation is only rabbinic, <i>challah</i> outside of [Israel] - even though it is impure - is not prohibited to be consumed by a priest unless he has impurity that emits from his body,   such as those who have had seminal emissions or irregular genital flows, mestruant women, those who have recently birthed and lepers. Therefore, if there was a minor priest boy outside of Israel - whether in Syria or other lands - if they want to, they may separate one <i>challah</i> as 1/48th and it may be given to eat to a minor priest boy who has not yet seen a seminal emission or to a minor priest girl who has not yet menstruated, and there is no need to do a second separation to burn it. ",
            "Also, if there is a an adult priest there who has immersed [to purify himself from genital flows] - even if the sun has not yet set for him [on the day of his immersion], and even though he is impure from contact with the dead - he may eat this first <i>challah</i>, and there is no need to do a second separation outside of Israel.
