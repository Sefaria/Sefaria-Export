One should begin by reciting: \"I acknowledge this day before the Lord your God that I have come into the land which the Lord solemnly promised to our fathers… My father was a wandering Aramean…\" He should continue to the end of the biblical section which concludes with the words \"which thou, O Lord, hast given me\" (Deuteronomy 26:3-10). This acknowledgment must be recited in the holy tongue only, as it is written: \"You shall then recite as follows\" (5), meaning: in this [Hebrew] tongue.",

But when those illiterates refrained from bringing their first fruits, that they might not be put to shame, it was ordained by the court that both those that knew and those that did not know should be made to repeat the words [after the priest]."

The men of all the smaller towns that belonged to the <i>Maamad</i> [one of the twenty-four divisions in the outlying districts] gathered together in the town of the <i>Maamad</i> [leader], so as not to come up to Jerusalem as isolated individuals, as it is written: \"In a multitude of people is the glory of a king\" (Proverbs 14:28). Having arrived, they spent the night in the open street of the town and did not enter the homes for fear of contracting uncleanness therein. Early in the morning, the officer of the <i>Maamad</i> said: \"Arise, and let us go up to Zion, to the Lord our God\" (Jeremiah 31:5). In front of them went the ox, having its horns overlaid with gold and a wreath of olive-leaves on its head, to indicate that the first fruits were taken from the seven species of farm products. The flute was played in front of them until they reached near Jerusalem. As they walked all the way, they chanted: \"I was glad when they said to me: Let us go up to the house of the Lord\" (Psalm 122:1). They walked only two thirds of the day. Upon arriving at the outskirts of Jerusalem, they sent messengers to let the men of Jerusalem know. They bedecked their first fruits and adorned them, placing the fresh ones on top of the dry. The high officers and the treasurers of the Temple came out of Jerusalem to meet them. They used to come out according to the number of those who arrived: if many pilgrims arrived, they were greeted by many; and if few, by few. When all of them entered within the gates of Jerusalem, they began to chant: \"Our feet stand at last within your gates, O Jerusalem\" (2).",
            "All the craftsmen in Jerusalem used to rise up before them and greet them, saying: \"Brethren, men of such-and-such a place, you are welcome!\" The flute was played in front of them as they marched inside Jerusalem until they reached the Temple Mount. Having arrived at the Temple Mount, each pilgrim would take his basket on his shoulder as they chanted: \"Praise the Lord! Praise God in his sanctuary… Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord\" (Psalm 150). They marched on the Temple Mount chanting until they reached as far as the Temple Court. When they reached the Temple Court, the Levites sang: \"I extol thee, O Lord, for thou hast lifted me…\" (30:2)."

Therefore, if there was a minor priest boy outside of Israel - whether in Syria or other lands - if they want to, they may separate one <i>challah</i> as 1/48th and it may be given to eat to a minor priest boy who has not yet seen a seminal emission or to a minor priest girl who has not yet menstruated, and there is no need to do a second separation to burn it.
