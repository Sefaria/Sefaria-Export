            "After separating the great <i>terumah</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the preferable course of behavior. If, however, one separates the tithes before <i>terumah</i>, the separation is binding.</i> one should separate one tenth of the remaining produce<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus it is not a tenth of the entire crop.</i> and this is called the first tithe. Concerning it [Numbers 18:24] states: \"For the tithes of the children of Israel that they will separate to God.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 127) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 395) include this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i><br>These tithes are given to Levites, males and females, as [<i>ibid.</i>] states: \"And I gave the Levites all of the tithes of the children of Israel as an inheritance.\"",
            "An Israelite is permitted to partake of the first tithe, and it may be eaten in a state of ritual impurity, because it is not holy.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., unlike <i>terumah</i> where these restrictions apply.</i> Whenever the term \"holy\" or \"redemption\" is used with regard to the tithes, the intent is the second tithe.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Which must be eaten in Jerusalem in a state of ritual purity.</i><br>What is the source from which we learn that the first tithe is ordinary produce? [<i>Ibid.</i>:27] states: \"And your <i>terumah</i> will be considered for you as grain from your grainheap and the fullness of the vat.\" Just as a grainheap and a vat [contain] ordinary produce, so, too, once <i>terumat ma'aser</i> has been separated from the first tithe,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Until <i>terumat ma'aser</i> has been separated from it, however, we may not partake of it (Radbaz).</i> it is ordinary produce in all regards. For this reason, when the daughter of a Levite has been taken captive<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And we fear that she was raped by her captors. With regard to <i>terumah</i>, by contrast, once the daughter of a priest engages in forbidden relations, she is forbidden to partake of it (<i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 6:7). Our Sages did not decree that a Levite's daughter who engages in forbidden relationships should not be allowed to partake of <i>terumah</i>, for it is uncommon for a woman to engage in forbidden relationships (<i>Yevamot</i> 91a).</i> or she engaged in forbidden relations, she can be given tithes and she may partake of it. When, however, there was a report that a woman's husband died or one witness testified that he died, she married<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If, however, she did not marry, she is not forbidden, even if she was consecrated by another man.</i> and then her husband appeared, our Sages penalized her and ruled that she is forbidden to partake of the tithes.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., this is a Rabbinic decree, enacted to maintain the moral level of the Jewish people.</i>",
            "The Levites and the priests should separate the first tithe so that they can separate <i>terumat ma'aser</i> from it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., since the priests and the Levites are allowed to keep the tithes, one might ask: Why is it necessary for them to separate it at the outset? The Rambam answers that the separation is necessary, because until <i>terumat ma'aser</i> is separated from the tithes, it is forbidden to partake of them.</i> Similarly, the priests must separate other types of <i>terumah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">With the expression \"other types of <i>terumah</i>,\" the Rambam includes <i>challah</i> and <i>bikkurim</i>. See <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 15:20.</i> and tithes<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The intent is only the first tithe. The second tithe and the tithe for the poor are not given to the priests.</i> for themselves.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They may not, however, partake of the produce without making these separations as the Rambam proceeds to explain.</i> Since the priests receive all types of agricultural gifts, is it possible for them to partake of the produce without these separations having been made? [Numbers 18:28] states: \"And so shall you separate, also you....\" \"You\" includes the Levites. \"Also you\" includes the priests.",

He need not, however, give them to another priest, but instead may keep them for himself.</i><br>Ezra penalized the Levites in his time<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are some who interpret the Rambam as implying that the penalty was applied only in Ezra's era, but not in subsequent generations. Indeed, we find that even Sages gave their tithes to Levites (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 5:9). For this reason, it appears that Ezra's penalty was that if there was both a priest and a Levite present, the tithes should be given to a priest, but they could also be given to a Levite (Radbaz). Alternatively, in Ezra's generation, the tithes should be given only to the priests. Subsequently, however, when more Levites ascended and settled in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, the decree was rescinded and tithes could also be given to the Levites. Nevertheless, in order not to nullify Ezra's words entirely, it was still possible to give the tithes to the priests (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). [Note, however, the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 5:15) which indicates that the tithes were given to the priests in the generations after Ezra as well. See also <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i> 11:14.] All agree that the Levites themselves were never required to give the tithes to the priests.<br>The <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> (Mitzvah 395) asks: How was it possible for Ezra to nullify the Torah's command? For the Scriptural obligation is to give the tithes to the priests. He answers that in Ezra's time, the mitzvah to tithe was only Rabbinic in origin (see <i>Hilchot Terumot</i>, ch. 1). Hence, it was possible for him to make the priests the recipients.</i> because they did not ascend to Jerusalem with him<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ezra 8:15 which states that the descendants of the Levites were not found among the people who returned to Israel from Babylon. There were many among the Jewish people who had achieved financial security and comfortable living circumstances in Babylon and did not want to give this up to live in the Holy Land. Nevertheless, aside from the Levites, there was no distinct group that did not return to Israel in significant numbers.</i> and ordained that the first tithe should be given solely to the priests.",

He is penalized, because he should not have mixed his produce with that of a common person. The Radbaz amplifies this explanation, stating that by mixing his produce together with that of a common person he caused the <i>terumat ma'aser</i> that will be separated to become impure. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that initially when the separation was first made, the two batches of produce were not mixed together. Hence, it is not appropriate to say that the separation he is making now will affect the entire quantity.<br>If, however, they were full partners and did not make a division until the wine was produce, the person who is conscientious in his observance need not separate more than the tithes for his own portion.

For within this context, we apply the principle of <i>bereirah</i> and assume that retroactively, each one is receiving his own share and hence has no responsibility for the share of his colleague.</i> Similarly, if his share was a third or a fourth, he must separate [the tithes from the produce he takes] proportionately.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If his share of the produce was one-third, he would have separated that amount of the total yield.

[This applies] even if they are of one species, and even from one container, and even if he himself recognized the barrel [from which the produce was taken].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And thus one might think that both batches came from the same person.</i> [The rationale is that] a wholesaler purchases from many different people and sells [it]. Perhaps the produce he first sold was from a common person whose produce is <i>demai</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the wholesaler sells in large quantities, he is permitted to sell <i>demai</i> (Chapter 11, Halachah 2).</i> and the batch he sold later was from a <i>chavair</i> who made the appropriate separations. As we already explained,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chapter 1, Halachah 6; <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 5:12.</i> we do not separate tithes from produce that is obligated to be tithed for produce that is exempt or from produce that is exempt for produce that is obligated. If the wholesaler said that [both batches] are from one person, we rely on his word.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even though he is a common person. The rationale is that he has nothing to gain by lying.</i>",
            "When [a wholesaler] sells hops or vegetables and they are being brought and collected before him, a purchaser should tithe each bunch of hops, each bundle [of vegetables], and each date individually.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The tithes cannot be separated from one for the other for the reason stated in the previous halachah.</i>",
            "When a person purchases [produce] from a private individual and then purchases [the same species] from him a second time, he may separate the tithes from one batch for the other.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For each person may separate tithes from one batch of his own produce for another. Since the person who grows this produce has this option, it is also granted to one who purchases from him.</i> [This applies] even when he purchases [produce] from two containers, and even from two cities. [The rationale is that] we operate under the presumption that a private person sells only his own produce.",
            "[Different rules apply when] a private person sells vegetables in the market place. When [produce] is brought to him from his gardens, [a purchaser] may tithe from one batch for the entire quantity. If, however, he is also brought [produce] from other gardens, should one purchase a batch from him and then purchase a second batch, he should not tithe from one for the other.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For it is possible that the second batch came from a different person and the difficulties mentioned in the first halachah might apply. This suspicion also applies in the halachot that follow.</i>",
            "When a person purchases bread from a baker, he should not tithe from the warm bread for the cool bread, for one might say that the wheat [used for] yesterday's [bread] was from one person and that [used] for today's is from another.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This applies even if the appearance of the bread is similar and they were baked in the same mold [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Demai</i> 5:3)].</i>",
            "When a person purchases [bread] from a bakery<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Our translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> he may tithe from one loaf for all the others even if [the loaves] are from different molds.

If, however, one purchases [bread] from a distributor, one should tithe each mold individually,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When many loaves were made from the same mold, it is sufficient to separate tithes from one loaf for all those made in the same mold.

            "When a person purchases [bread] from a poor person and similarly, if a poor person was given<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., as charity.

When he was given a large present.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the donor is generous, we assume that he also separated the tithes. Hence, the obligation to separate the tithes is merely a stringency. Therefore we are lenient with regard to its observance and do not suspect that the produce was given to the poor person by different people [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Demai</i> 5:5)].</i> If he was given a small present, he should tithe each present individually.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the donor was tightfisted, it is unlikely that he separated the tithes. Hence, the obligation to separate the tithes is more compelling and we are stringent with regard to the above suspicion (<i>ibid.</i>).</i>",
            "If a person ground a loaf of bread [into] crumbs or ground dried figs and made them into a cake,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A loaf of bread and a cake of dried figs is considered as a large present.

            "When workers or guests were reclining and eating and they left over slices [of bread], one should tithe each one individually.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We are speaking about the guests or workers of one person. Nevertheless, one cannot be lenient and separate tithes for the entire batch as one, for it is possible that one of the workers or guests separated the tithes and others did not and thus one might be separating tithes from produce from which tithes had been separated for produce from which they had not been. Although <i>demai</i> may be fed to guests (Chapter 10, Halachah 11), there may be some who desire to separate tithes as a stringency, but others will not.</i>"
