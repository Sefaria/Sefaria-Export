            "The priestly tithe at this time is not from Torah writ, but [rabbinic] - even in a place that those that came up from Babylonia held, and even at the time of Ezra - as you do not have the priestly tithe from the Torah except in the Land of Israel at the time that all of Israel is there, as it is stated, \"When you come\" (seemingly a reference to Numbers 15:18, which has, \"In your coming\") - the coming of all of you, like they were at the first possession, and like they are to return in the future for the third possession, and not like they were at the possession in the days of Ezra, which was a coming of some of them - and hence it was not from the Torah [then]. And so does it appear to me is the law of tithes [as well], that we are only obligated [rabbinically] at this time - like the priestly tithe. "

            "A fetus, a yavam, consecration, a deaf-mute, and a child of nine years old disqualify [a woman] from partaking of terumah, but do not entitle her to partake [of it].",
            "What is meant [by the above statement] with regard to a fetus? A daughter of an Israelite who was impregnated by a priest is not entitled to partake of terumah by virtue of the fetus. When the daughter of a priest, by contrast, was impregnated by an Israelite, she is prohibited against partaking of terumah because of the fetus. [This is derived from Leviticus 22:13:] \"And she shall return to her father's home as in her maidenhood.\" This excludes a pregnant woman.",
            "When an Israelite has relations with a daughter of a priest, we do not suspect that she became pregnant. Instead, she may immerse herself [in the mikveh] and partake [of terumah] in the evening. If she was married to an Israelite and her husband died, she may immerse herself and partake of terumah in the evening [and continue doing so] for 40 days. If her fetus is recognized [afterwards], retroactively, her [actions] are objectionable from the fortieth day onward. For, throughout the forty days, the embryo is not considered as a fetus, merely as water."

And even though there is more un-dedicated produce than dedicated. What case are we speaking of? One of dedicated produce in our times, which is a Rabbinic commandment; but dedicated produce that derives from a Torah commandment, until the un-dedicated food outnumbers the dedicated food [a non-priest cannot eat it]."
