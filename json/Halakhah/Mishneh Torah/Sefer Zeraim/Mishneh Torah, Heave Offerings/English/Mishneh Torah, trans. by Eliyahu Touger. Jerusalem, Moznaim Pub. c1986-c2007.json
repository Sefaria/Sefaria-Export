            "According to Scriptural Law, [the obligation to separate] the <i>terumot<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>The plural term is used in this halachah and in many instances in this text, because there are two types of terumot: a) \"the great terumah,\" i.e., the terumah separated initially, and b) terumat ma'aser, the terumah the Levites separate from the tithes that are given them. See Hilchot Matanot Aniyim, ch. 6, for details regarding the separation of these allocations.</i></i></i> and the tithes<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here also the plural term is used because there are several tithes: the first tithe given to Levites, the second tithe which must be brought to Jerusalem, and the tithe for the poor. See <i>Hilchot Matanot Aniyim, loc. cit.</i></i> applies only in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Kiddushin</i> 36b states that all the mitzvot involving the produce of the earth apply only in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.</i> [It applies] whether the Temple is standing or not.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although the agricultural laws apply even when the Temple is not standing, there is a restriction to the time when they apply according to Scriptural Law. The entire Jewish people must be located in our holy land, as stated in Halachah 26. (See also <i>Hilchot Shemitah VeYovel</i> 10:8-9.)</i> The prophets ordained that these obligations should be observed in Babylon as well, because it is adjacent to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and the majority of the Jewish people journey to and from there.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even though Babylonia is further away than the other lands mentioned in this halachah, it had a larger Jewish community and there was far more contact between its populace and the Jewish community of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. Hence, the prophets gave it precedence over the other lands (Radbaz).</i> The Sages of the early generations<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Sages of the generation that followed Ezra [Rav Ovadiah of Bartenura (<i>Yadayim</i> 3:3).</i> ordained that they also be observed in the lands of Egypt and the lands of Ammon and Moab, because they are on the peripheries of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.",
            "Whenever <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> is mentioned, the intent is the lands conquered by the King of Israel or a prophet with the consent of the entire Jewish people. This is called \"a conquest of the community.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See also <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 5:6.</i> If, however, an individual Jew, a family, or a tribe go and conquer a place for themselves - even in the land given to Abraham<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam speaks of the land being given to Abraham, not merely being promised to him, since from the time God said that the land was his, spiritually, it became his possession. Moreover, as the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Challah</i> 5:1) states, from Abraham's time onward, even though the land was still possessed by the Canaanites, the Jews were already its legal owners. See also <i>Bava Batra</i> 119b.</i> - it is not considered as <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> in the sense that one is obligated to observe all the mitzvot there.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the agricultural mitzvot that must be observed in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.</i> For this reason, Joshua<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A king and a prophet.</i> and his court divided the entire Land of Israel into tribal portions<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., since Joshua and his court had made this division, when the tribe went to conquer its portion, it was acting on behalf of the entire Jewish people.</i> even though it was not conquered [entirely] at that time. In this way, when every tribe would ascend and conquer its portion, it would not be considered as merely an individual conquest.",
            "The lands which [King] David conquered outside of the Land of Canaan, e.g., Aram Naharaim, Aram Tzovah, Achlab,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These regions are located in contemporary Syria.</i> and the like, even though he was a King of Israel and he was acting with the consent of the High Court,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The wars to conquer these lands are classified as voluntary wars, and a voluntary law requires the consent of the High Court (<i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 5:1).</i> is not considered as the Land of Israel with regard to all matters, nor is it like the Diaspora, i.e., Babylonia and Egypt with regard to all matters. Instead, it was removed from the category of the Diaspora, but did not enter the category of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<br>Why was its level considered lower than that of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>? Because David conquered them before he conquered all of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Demai</i> 6:11) where he criticizes King David for this approach, quoting the <i>Sifri</i> (<i>Parshat Ekev</i>) that states that he did not act in accordance with the Torah. Since the designation of the land as <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> is through Divine fiat as expressed through the Torah. Accordingly, a conquest that is not in accord with the Torah cannot bring about such a designation (<i>Likkutei Sichot,</i> Vol. V, p. 9).</i> Instead, there were still members of the seven nations there. If, however, he had conquered <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> entirely, in all of its boundaries, and afterwards conquered<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">With the consent of the High Court.</i> other lands,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even lands outside of the homeland promised to Abraham (Radbaz).</i> his entire conquest would have been equivalent to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> with regard to all matters.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And the agricultural laws would have to be observed there.</i> The lands which [King] David conquered are called Syria.",
            "There are dimensions of [the laws that apply to] Syria that resemble [the laws that apply in] <i>Eretz Yisrael</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In addition to those points the Rambam mentions below, among the other examples of this principle are: its air is not considered as a source of impurity (<i>Hilchot Tuma'at Meit</i> 11:6); it is permitted to have a gentile compose a deed of purchase for land there on the Sabbath so that one will acquire the land (<i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 6:11).</i> and there are dimensions of [its laws] that resemble [those which apply] in the Diaspora.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Among the examples of the relevant laws: its earth is considered as a source of ritual impurity (<i>Hilchot Tuma'at Meit, loc. cit.</i>); a servant from <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> sold there is granted his freedom (<i>Hilchot Avadim</i> 8:6).</i> A person who purchases landed property [in Syria] is comparable to one who purchases [land] in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> with regard to <i>terumot</i>, tithes, and the Sabbatical year.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Halachah 15.</i> All [the laws that apply] in Syria are of Rabbinic origin.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For according to Scriptural Law, it is not part of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.</i>",
            "All of the lands that [the Jews] who ascended from Egypt took possession of were sanctified in the first consecration [of the land]. When they were exiled, that sanctity was nullified.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 6:16, the Rambam states: \"It was no longer <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>,\" i.e., none of the halachic obligations apply there.</i> [The rationale is that] the initial consecration came about because of the conquest. [Hence,] its consecration was effective for the time [it was under their rule], but not for all time.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since it was established by conquest, it could be nullified by conquest. See <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah, loc. cit.</i> The Radbaz explains that when the Jews ascended from Egypt, they did not make a statement, consecrating the land. Therefore its holiness could be nullified.</i> When, by contrast, the descendants of the exiles ascended [from Babylon] and took possession of a portion of the land,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As <i>Yevamot</i> 16a states: \"Much of the land that was conquered by [the Jews who] ascended from Egypt was not conquered by [the Jews who] ascended from Babylon.</i> they consecrated it a second time.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nevertheless, since the entire Jewish people did not return together with Ezra, this consecration is only of Rabbinic origin.</i> [This consecration] is perpetuated forever, for that time and for all time.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And thus at present, Ezra's consecration of the land is still effective.<br>In his gloss to <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah, loc. cit.</i>, the <i>Kessef Mishnah</i> finds these statements difficult to accept because of the following questions:<br>a) On what basis is <i>chazakah</i> considered a more effective means of acquisition than conquest?<br>b) After the initial conquest of Eretz Yisrael, the Jewish people manifested their ownership over it and thus, effected a <i>chazakah</i>. If so, why is Ezra's <i>chazakah</i>, which was not preceded by conquest, more effective than the <i>chazakah</i> which followed the original conquest? Why should the conquest detract from the consecration of the land?<br>To explain: As mentioned above, the Jewish people's ownership of the land began with God's promise of the land to Abraham. The sanctity of the land, by contrast, did not begin until the Jewish people actually took possession of it, upon their reentry into the land after the exodus from Egypt and the journey through the desert. At that time, they were commanded to conquer the land and take it forcefully from the Gentiles (see Numbers 32:29,Deuteronomy 3:21, <i>et al</i>). Since God made the consecration of the land dependent upon its conquest by the Jewish people, it follows that conquest by a Gentile nation can nullify its holiness.<br>In contrast, Ezra was not commanded to reconquer <i>Eretz Yisrael,</i> but to settle it. In this instance, God made the sanctity of the land dependent on the Jewish people manifesting their ownership over it. In other words, the sanctity came from manifesting the true reality: that <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> is a Jewish land. Accordingly, since <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> remains our land, regardless of how many times it has been conquered by Gentiles, the sanctity effected by that manifestation of ownership also continues eternally (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XV, pp. 102-109).</i><br>[The Sages] left those places that had been settled by [the Jews who] ascended from Egypt, but were not settled by those who ascended from Babylon in their previous [halachic status] and did not exempt them from [the obligations of] <i>terumah</i> and tithes so that the poor could rely upon them in the Sabbatical year.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And receive the tithe of the poor.</i> Our holy teacher<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Yehudah <i>HaNasi</i>.</i> released Beit Shan<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam and maintains that Beit Shan was released only from those obligations that are of Rabbinic origin.</i> from those places which [the Jews] who ascended from Babylon did not take hold of. He decided that Ashkelon should be exempted from the tithes.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> relates that Rabbi Yehudah <i>HaNasi</i> released these cities from the obligation of the tithes, because they were not populated by Jews and were not close to the area settled by Jews.</i>",
            "Thus the entire earth is divided into three categories in relation to those mitzvot involving the land: <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, Syria, and the Diaspora. <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> itself is divided into two categories: a) those portions settled by the Jews who ascended from Babylonia, and b) those portions that were settled only by the Jews who ascended from Egypt.<br>The Diaspora is divided into two categories: a) Egypt, Babylon, Ammon, and Moab in which the mitzvot are observed according to the decrees of the sages and the prophets and the other lands in which [the obligations of] the <i>terumot</i> and the tithes are not observed.",
            "What are [the boundaries of] the land settled by the Jews who ascended from Egypt? From Rekem which is in the east of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> until the Mediterranean Sea. From Ashkelon<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ashkelon - and similarly, the other cities the Rambam refers to - is located near, but not exactly on the same site - as the city presently called by that name. With regard to Ashkelon in particular, there is discussion of the issue by the commentaries, for some sources (see Radbaz and <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>) explain that it was part of the land conquered by the Jews who ascended from Egypt. It was not, however, conquered by the Jews who ascended from Babylonia.</i> which is in the south of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> until Acre which is in the north. As one proceeds from Acre to Kziv,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., proceeding northward.</i> the area to one's right, on the east, can generally be assumed to be of the Diaspora - it is impure as is the lands of the nations<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Our Sages decreed that merely touching the earth of the Diaspora is sufficient to impart ritual impurity. See <i>Hilchot Tuma'at Meit</i>, ch. 11.</i> and is exempt from [the mitzvot of] the tithes and the Sabbatical year - unless it is known that it was part of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. The area to one's left, to the west, can generally be assumed to be part of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> - it is pure [from the impurity associated with] the lands of the nations and is obligated with regard to [mitzvot of] the tithes and the Sabbatical year - unless it is known to be part of the Diaspora.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., as depicted in the map drawn by the Rambam to accompany the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the borders of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> ascend northward from Acre to Kziv, but there is a strip of land in the center that did not become part of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.</i> With regard to the entire area that slopes downward from the Samnum Mountains:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Our text is based on authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> as cited in the Rav Shabsie Frankel edition. The standard printed text refers to the Umenum Mountains. See also the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Sh'vi'it</i> 6:1).<br>In the map the Rambam drew to depict this matter, the Samnum Mountains are located in the southeastern corner of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, near Ashkelon. Most of the other commentaries understand this term as referring to the Umenum Mountain range in Northern Lebanon.</i> The inner [portion]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., to the south.</i> is <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, the portion outside the Samnum Mountains is the Diaspora.<br>With regard to the islands in the sea, we consider their [status dependent] on an [imaginary] line extended from the Samnum Mountains until the River of Egypt.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the Radbaz, this refers to Wadi el Arish and not the Nile. Most other commentaries, however, identify \"the River of Egypt\" as the Nile.</i> Those within this line are part of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. Those outside this line are part of the Diaspora. This is a depiction of the matter.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the Rambam included the accompanying map so that the matter would be clearly understood.. This reflects his thrust throughout the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>: to provide his readers with an applicable text without any ambiguity.</i>",
            "Which area did the Jews who ascended from Babylonia settle in? [The area] from Kziv inward toward the east. They did not, however, take possession of the area from Kziv outward until Amana which is Samnum until the river, i.e., the River of Egypt.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus it appears that the entire coastal range of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> was not settled by the Jews who ascended from Babylon.</i> And they did not take possession of Kziv itself.",
            "What constitutes Syria? From <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and below<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The term \"below\" in this context is problematic. It does not mean \"south,\" because significant portions of Syria are more northerly than <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. Some commentaries understand it as meaning in height, because as <i>Kiddushin</i> 69b states, <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> is higher than other lands.</i> parallel to Aram Naharaim and Aram Tzovah, the entire region of the Euphrates until Babylonia, e.g., Damascus, Achalev, Charan, Minbag, and the like until Shinar<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shinar itself, however, is part of the Diaspora, as evident from Halachah 1.</i> and Tzahar. These are considered like Syria. Acre, by contrast, is considered part of the Diaspora, like Ashkelon.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As mentioned above, there are commentaries who consider Ashkelon to be part of the land conquered by the Jews who ascended from Egypt, but not that conquered by the Jews ascending from Babylonia. Some also place Acre in this category.</i> These are the boundaries of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.",
            "When a gentile purchases land in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, he does not cause it to be absolved from [the observance of] the mitzvot.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the following halachah for the practical application of this principle.</i> Instead, its holiness is still intact.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Gittin</i> 47a derives this concept from Leviticus 25:23: \"The entire land is Mine.\" Implied is that the land belongs to God and His ownership cannot be absolved through conquest by any earthly power.<br>This ruling was a point of question for the Rambam. As indicated by the notes of Rav Kappach to his translation of the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Pe'ah</i> 4:9; <i>Gittin</i> 4:9, <i>et al</i>), the Rambam changed his mind concerning the issue several times and amended his text of the Commentary to the Mishnah accordingly. At first, he stated the opinion quoted here, then adopted the opposite view, that a gentile's acquisition does cause the agricultural obligations to be absolved, and finally returned to his original position. The <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 331:3-4) follow the Rambam's ruling here. See also <i>Hilchot Shemitah VeYovel</i> 4:29 where this issue is also discussed.</i> Therefore, if a Jew purchases this land from [the gentile], it is not considered as a private conquest.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In which instance, the agriculture laws would not be applicable, as stated in Halachah 2.</i> Instead, he should separate the <i>terumot</i> and the tithes and bring the first fruits.

When a gentile acquires land in Syria, his acquisition has the power to absolve [the land] from the obligations of tithes and the Sabbatical year,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The entire obligation to observe the agricultural laws in Syria is Rabbinic in origin (Halachah 4) and our Sages did not enforce their decrees in this instance.</i> as will be explained.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Halachot 15-19.</i>",
            "[The following laws apply with regard to] produce belonging to a gentile that grew on land that he purchased in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.

It cannot be kept by the owner, because he is forbidden to partake of it. Instead, it is consecrated and must be eaten by a priest in a state of ritual purity (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 331:10).</i> The first tithe belongs to him,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., he must separate the first tithe to fulfill the agricultural obligations incumbent upon the produce, but is not obligated to give it to the Levites. There is no difficulty in him keeping the tithes, because, as the Rambam explains, he is not obligated to give them to the Levite and there is no prohibition against him partaking of them, because they are not consecrated at all and any person may partake of them, even when he is not in a state of ritual purity.</i> because he can tell a Levite with regard to the tithes and a priest with regard to the <i>terumat ma'aser</i>: \"I am coming in the stead of a person<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The gentile.</i> from which you could not have collected anything.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Had the gentile completed the tasks associated with preparing the grain, he would not have been under any obligation to make any of these separations. Hence, although the Jew is obligated to separate the various allocations, the obligation is primarily a ritual one and not a financial one. With the exception of the great <i>terumah</i>, he is not obligated to accept any loss and may keep the first tithes for himself.</i><br>Why do we say that he should not give the <i>terumat ma'aser</i> to a priest as [he gives him] the great <i>terumah</i>?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., like the first tithe, the <i>terumat ma'aser</i> must be separated, but it need not be given to the priest.</i> Because with regard to <i>terumat ma'aser,</i> it is written: \"When you take the tithes from the children of Israel....\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is, by contrast, no such verse stated with regard to the great <i>terumah</i>.

Instead, you sell it to the priest and take the money.",
            "[The following laws apply if] a gentile sold his produce to a Jew while it was connected to the earth.

With regard to that portion, the concepts stated in the previous halachah apply.

Attaining the age of maturity is itself not sufficient (<i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 2:10-11).<br>Seemingly, this clause is also speaking about an instance where the daughter of a priest is marrying a youth who disqualifies her and the question is whether he is of sufficient physical maturity for the marriage to be significant. In that instance, however, it would be proper to speak of consecration, not marriage. For this reason, Rav Yosef Korcus defines this clause as referring to a daughter of an Israelite who is marrying a priest and the question is whether the marriage entitles her to partake of <i>terumah</i> or not.</i>",

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> also cites these ideas and states that the reason the Rambam requires that the pot be washed out is because the contents are being cooked. If they were not to be cooked, even washing would not be necessary.</i> If he cooked [<i>terumah</i>] in part of the pot, it is not necessary to wash out the entire pot, only the place where it was cooked.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This leniency applies only with regard to <i>terumah</i> and not to prohibited food absorbed in a utensil. The rationale is the same as in the previous note: Since the priests consider this <i>terumah</i> insignificant, we do not show concern about it (Radbaz).</i>",
            "The great <i>terumah, terumat ma'aser, challah,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The portion of dough that must be separated and given to a priest.</i> and the first fruits are all referred to as <i>terumah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 10, Halachah 4.</i> With regard to <i>terumat ma'aser</i>, [Numbers 18:26] states: \"And you shall remove the <i>terumah</i> of G‑d from it\" and [<i>ibid.</i> 15:20] states that it should be \"like the <i>terumah</i> of your grain heap.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This verse refers to <i>challah</i>; or it is comparing <i>challah</i> to the great <i>terumah</i>. Perhaps a scribal error crept into the text and this was intended as support for the following clause. The Radbaz, however, gives an explanation why it was included here.</i><br>With regard to <i>challah</i>, [<i>ibid.</i>] states: \"You shall separate <i>challah</i> as <i>terumah</i>.\" And [Deuteronomy 12:17]: \"You may not eat in your gates the tithes of your grain, your wine, and your oil,... and the <i>terumah</i> of your hand.\" Now there are no substances that are required to be brought [to Jerusalem to be eaten] that are not explicitly mentioned in the verse except the first fruits. Thus the phrase \"the <i>terumah</i> of your hand\" can be applied to them. Thus we see that they are [also] called <i>terumah</i>.",
            "Therefore the laws regarding partaking of all four types of substances and mixtures of them and other substances are the same. All can be nullified in a mixture of 101 times the original substance. They are also all combined with each other.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., to cause a mixture to be forbidden to non-priests.</i> If they become impure, they should all be burnt. The laws that apply to <i>terumat ma'aser</i> that is <i>demai</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Produce from which we are unsure that the tithes have been separated.</i> are the same that apply to <i>terumat ma'aser</i> separated from produce [from which the tithes were] definitely [not separated]. It is only that its violation is not punishable by lashes.",
            "Anyone who partakes of <i>terumah</i> should recite the blessing for that particular food and then recite the blessing:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For partaking of <i>terumah</i> is a mitzvah and we are required to recite a blessing before the observance of all mitzvot (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> \"[Blessed are You... who has sanctified us with the holiness of Aaron and commanded us to partake of <i>terumah</i>.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Hillchot Bikkurim</i> 1:2.</i> We have received the tradition and observed that people would recite this blessing even when partaking of <i>challah</i> separated in the Diaspora.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even though it is only a Rabbinic commandment.</i> For even partaking of sacred foods from the boundaries [of our Holy Land] is like service [in the Temple],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Pesachim</i> 72b relates that one day Rabbi Tarfon did not come to the House of study. Rabban Gamliel rebuked him for his absence. Rabbi Tarfon answered that he was carrying out priestly worship. Rabban Gamliel asked him how that was possible, for they lived in the era of the Temple's destruction. Rabbi Tarfon replied that partaking of <i>terumah</i> was equivalent to serving in the Temple.</i> as [Numbers 18:7] states: \"I have granted you your priestly service as a gift.\""
