            "1. A person who sows two different seeds as one in the Land of Israel receives lashes, as it says \"You shall not seed kilayim in your field\" (Lev. 19:19)",
            "2. And this is the same whether one sows or uproots or covers, for example, if one wheat and one barley, or one bean and one lentil were on the land and the person covered them with dirt, whether with one's hand, one's foot or an instrument: the person gets lashes. And it is the same whether one sows on the land or on a open-bottom planter. But one who sows in a planter whose bottom is not open receives rebellion lashes [for transgressing a rabbinic law].",
            "3. It is forbidden to sow mixed species for a non-Jew. And one is permitted to tell a non-Jew to sow mixed species. And it is forbidden for a person to keep alive mixed species in one's field, one should uproot them, and if they sustain themselves one is not lashed. And it is permissible for a Jew to sow mixed species with one's hand outside of the Land of Israel, and even to mix the seeds from the outset, and then sow them outside of the Land, and those words are \"received words\".",
            "4. The only seeds in which the laws of mixing seeds apply are the ones fit to be eaten by a person. But the bitter herbs, and others, which use is medicine, and not food, and so on - to those these laws do not apply.",
            "5. The mixing of trees fall under what is written \"You shall not sow in your field mixed seeds\" (Lev. 19:19). For example, the one who grafts a tree on another tree, for instance, an apple on an etrog or an etrog on an apple, behold this one receives \"Torah lashes\" [for transgressing a Torah law] in any place, whether in the land or outside of the land. And the same applies to one who grafts a vegetable on a tree, or a tree on a vegetable, this one is lashed in any place.",
            "6. And it is forbidden for  a Jew to ask a non Jew to graft mixed trees for him/her. And it is permitted to sow vegetable seeds and tree seeds together, and it is permissible to mix seeds of trees and sow them as one, as there is no mixing of seeds regarding trees, only grafting [is forbidden].",
            "One who plants mixed seeds, as well as one who grafts trees onto one another: although he is lashed, they [produce] are nonetheless permitted to be eaten, including the one who planted them himself, because the prohibition only applies to planting them. It is also permitted to plant a branch from a grafted tree and to sow seeds from a plant that was originally from mixed planting."

            "The only prohibition regarding diverse species of clothing is solely [the combination of] wool and linen, as it is written, (Deuteronomy 22:11) \"Do not wear shatnez, wool and linen together.\" There are seaside cities which have something similar to wool, which grows on the rocks in the Mediterranean Sea with the form of gold, and it is very soft, called <i>\"Kalalakh\"</i> (cissaros-blossoms). [This is] forbidden together with linen for the reason of bad appearances, since it looks similar to sheep's wool. Likewise, silk and cissaros-blossoms are prohibited because of bad appearances."
