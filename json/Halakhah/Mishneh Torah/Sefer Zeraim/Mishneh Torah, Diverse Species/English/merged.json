            "A person who sows two species of seeds together in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">But not in the Diaspora. See Halachah 3.</i> is liable for lashes,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., he transgresses a negative commandment, included as one of the 365 negative commandments by <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 215) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 245).</i> as [Leviticus 19:19] states: \"You shall not sow your field with mixed species.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Radbaz states that the Rambam begins <i>Sefer Zeraim</i> with the laws of mixed substances - although the Mishnaic order of <i>Zeraim</i> begins with <i>Pe'ah</i> because he concludes <i>Sefer Hafla'ah</i> (<i>Hilchot Arachin</i> 8:1) with the teaching that the High Court would concern itself with consecrated articles from the first of Adar onward. At that same time, they would also concern themselves with fields containing mixed substances (<i>Shekalim</i> 1:1). Hence, the Rambam mentions these subjects in sequence.<br>The Radbaz notes that this prooftext is also used to derive the prohibition against grafting two species of trees together and that this prohibition applies in the Diaspora as well as in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> (see Halachah 5). He explains that although the prohibition against grafting trees is derived from this verse, since an equation is established between the prohibition against grafting and the prohibition against crossbreeding animals, there are certain dimensions of that prohibition that do not apply with regard to the prohibition against planting two species of produce together.</i>",
            "[This prohibition, referred to as <i>kilayim</i>, applies whether one] sows, weeds,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For by weeding a field, one stimulates the growth of crops. Although the Rambam considers weeding a derivative of plowing and not of sowing with regard to the forbidden Sabbath labors (<i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 8:1), the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> (to <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i>) explains that, in fact, it is a derivative of both forbidden labors, because one can weed for two intents:<br>a) to improve the appearance of the field, in which instance, it is a derivative of plowing, and<br>b) to cause the crops to grow better, in which instance, it is a derivative of sowing.</i> or covers seeds with earth, e.g., there was a kernel of wheat and a kernel of barley or a fava bean and a lentil, lying on the earth and one covered them with earth, whether with his hand, his foot, or with a utensil, he is liable for lashes. [This applies] whether he sows them in the earth or in a pot with a hole.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., since the pot has a hole, the earth within it is considered to derive nurture from the earth and thus sowing within it is considered equivalent to sowing within the earth (<i>Kilayim</i> 7:8). This principle applies, not only in this context, but in many other situations involving agricultural laws. The hole must be large enough to allow a small root to pass through (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> When, by contrast, one sows them in a pot without a hole, he is liable only for stripes for rebellious conduct.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The punishment given for transgressing Rabbinic prohibitions. Since the pot did not have a hole, the person is not liable for the violation of a Scriptural commandment. Nevertheless, our Sages prohibited sowing seeds in this manner (see <i>Menachot</i> 70a) and hence, doing so incurs this liability.</i>",
            "It is forbidden to sow <i>kilayim</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This applies to mixed species of seeds. With regard to mixed species in a vineyard, see Chapter 5, Halachah 5.</i> for a gentile.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., even in a field belonging to a gentile. For a gentile's acquisition of property in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> does not nullify the holiness of the land (see <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 1:10). Hence, all of the mitzvot and prohibitions that apply previously continue to apply. See <i>Turei Zahav</i> 297:1.</i> It is, by contrast, permitted to tell a gentile to sow mixed species of seeds for his own sake.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We find several instances where a prohibition exists in telling a gentile to perform a forbidden act (<i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 6:1; <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 16:13; <i>Hilchot Sechirut</i> 13:3; see also Halachah 6). Thus the Ra'avad differs concerning this issue and maintains that making such statements to a gentile is forbidden. Both the Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explain that, we are speaking about an instance where the gentile is planting the mixed species in his own field. Hence, in this instance, since the gentile is acting for his own sake, there is no prohibition involved in the Jew telling the gentile to plant the mixed species. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 296), however, interprets the Rambam as granting permission to tell a gentile to sow mixed species in the Jew's field, but differs with that ruling himself.</i><br>It is forbidden for a person to maintain mixed species of seeds in his field. Instead, he must uproot them. If he maintains them, he is not liable for lashes.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If, however, he performs a deed that maintains the forbidden produce, he is liable for lashes (Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Kilayim</i> 8:1). This is the manner in which the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> resolves the Ra'avad's objections to the Rambam's ruling.</i> It is permitted for a Jew to sow mixed species of seeds by hand in the Diaspora.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is not even a Rabbinic prohibition against doing so.</i> It is even permitted to mix seeds at the outset and then sow them. These concepts [have been communicated] by the Oral Tradition.",
            "The prohibition against mixed species of seeds involves only plants that are fit for human consumption.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> cites sources (including Chapter 5, Halachah 18) which indicate the intent is not that the produce is not fit for human consumption, but rather that it is not fit for human use. Even if it is ordinarily used as animal fodder, it is still fit to be considered as a mixed substance. This interpretation is cited by the <i>Turei Zahav</i> 297:2.</i> Grasses that are bitter and similar roots that are fit only for medicinal purposes and the like are not included in the prohibition against mixtures of seeds.",
            "[Grafting] a mixture of trees is included in the prohibition: \"You shall not sow your field with mixed species.\" What is implied? When a person grafts a tree [of one species] unto a tree [of another species], e.g., he grafted a branch of an apple tree to an esrog tree or one from an esrog tree to an apple tree, he is liable for lashes according to Scriptural Law in any place, whether in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> or in the Diaspora.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For, as mentioned above, this restriction is derived from an association with the prohibition against cross-breeding different species of animals.</i> Similarly, if a person grafts a vegetable to a tree or a tree to a vegetable, he is liable for lashes in every place.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Radbaz maintains that it is, however, permitted to graft a vegetable to a vegetable in the Diaspora, but not in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. The <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 295:3), however, also forbid grafting two species of vegetables together. Similarly, they forbid grafting a fruit-bearing tree onto a non-fruit-bearing tree.</i>",
            "It is forbidden for a Jew to allow a gentile to graft different species of trees together for [the Jew].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Two explanations are given for this prohibition:<br>a) a gentile is forbidden to graft different species of trees together (<i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 10:6). Hence, having him perform the act is \"placing a stumbling block in the path of the blind.\"<br>b) Since it is forbidden to do anything to maintain a forbidden graft, it is also forbidden to give instructions for such a graft to be made.</i><br>It is permitted to sow the seeds of produce and the seeds of a tree together.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 295) emphasizes that, according to the Rambam, this leniency applies even in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. This runs contrary to the view of the <i>Tur</i> who maintains that this is forbidden in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. The <i>Tur's</i> view is supported by the Ra'avad who differs with the Rambam and forbids such a practice. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and the Radbaz support the Rambam's view.</i> Similarly, it is permitted to mix seeds from different species of trees and sow them together. [The rationale is that] the only prohibition against mixed species that applies to trees is the prohibition against grafting [different species together].",
            "Although he is liable for lashes, when a person sows forbidden species together or grafts forbidden species of trees together, the produce that grows is permitted to be eaten, even by the person who transgressed and sowed it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">With regard to the prohibitions against forbidden labor on the Sabbath, by contrast, greater stringencies apply to a person who performed a forbidden labor benefiting from his actions than to others (<i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 6:23).</i> For it is only sowing that is forbidden.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Radbaz states that here, the Rambam is speaking about the status of the produce according to law. As stated in the conclusion of the following chapter, as a punishment for violating the law, our Sages decreed that the entire field should be designated as ownerless.</i><br>It is permitted to plant a branch from the grafted tree or plant the seeds from a vegetable that was planted together with mixed species.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Therefore it is permitted to plant nectarines and other mixed species.</i>",
            "Edible plants are divided into three categories:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">From here to the conclusion of the chapter, the Rambam is outlining general principles that will be relevant in the coming chapters (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i><br>a) the first is called grain; it includes wheat, wild wheat, barley, oats, and spelt;<br>b) the second is called <i>kitniot</i>; it includes all the types of seeds eaten by men other than grain, e.g., beans, peas, lentils, millet, and rice, sesame seeds, poppy seed, white peas, and the like. c) the third is called garden seeds, i.e., seeds which are not fit for human consumption, but whose fruit is fit for human consumption, e.g., onion seeds, garlic [seeds], leek seeds, <i>ketzach</i> [seeds], cabbage seeds, and the like. Flax seed is considered in this category. When these seeds are sown and grow, before the seeds are recognizable, the entire plant is called herbage and it is called vegetables.",
            "There are some garden plants that that are sown in [large] fields, e.g., flax and mustard seed<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The commentaries note that the Rambam's statements here appear to contradict his statement in Chapter 3, Halachah 18, and <i>Hilchot Matnot Aniyim</i> 3:11, where the Rambam states that it is customary to sow mustard seed in individual rows.</i> and they are called \"types of seeds.\" And there are other garden plants which people customarily sow only in small rows,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., it is not customary to grow an entire field of them.</i> e.g., turnips, radishes, spinach, onions, coriander, parsley, horse radish, and the like. These are called vegetables."

            "[The following rules apply when] seeds [of one species] are mixed together<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As stated in Halachah 6, this and the following halachot apply when the mixture came about unintentionally. If the mixture was made intentionally, even the slightest amount is forbidden.</i> with seed of another [species]. If the smaller quantity was one twenty-fourth [or more of the entire mixture], e.g., a <i>se'ah</i> of wheat became mixed with 23 <i>se'ah</i> of barley,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When quoting this law, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 297:5) speaks of 24 <i>se'ah</i> of barley.</i> it is forbidden to sow the mixture unless one reduces the amount of wheat<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">By removing the kernels.</i> or adds to the amount of barley.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">So that the amount of wheat will no longer be considered significant.<br>The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Kilayim</i> 2:1) refers to the general principle (<i>Beitzah</i> 4b) that we do not nullify the existence of a prohibited substance. Why then are we allowed to add more barley and thus nullify the presence of the wheat?<br>It explains that the mixture is forbidden only because of the appearance created, i.e., as stated in Chapter 3, Halachah 5, mixed substances are forbidden only if the mixture is noticeable to the eye. Hence, if the barley is added before the mixture is sown, when the crops grow, the mixture will not be noticeable. Hence, there is no prohibition involved (<i>Rambam LeAm</i>).</i> If he sowed [the mixture as is], he is liable for lashes.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are those who interpret the Jerusalem Talmud as implying that in this instance, the prohibition is merely Rabbinic in origin. Hence, they question this ruling. According to the explanation in the previous note, however, there is no difficulty.</i>",
            "Any [species of seed] that is considered a forbidden substance with the seeds [that are mixed in] is included in the sum of one twenty-fourth. What is implied? 23 <i>se'ah</i> of wheat were mixed together with two <i>kabbin</i> of barley, two <i>kabbin</i> of lentils, and two <i>kabbin</i> of beans.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are six <i>kab</i> in a <i>se'ah</i>. Thus there is not enough of any one different species for it to be considered as a forbidden mixture on its own. Nevertheless, since when combined, there is a significant amount of seeds of other species, the mixture is forbidden.</i> He should not sow the entire mixture until he reduces the <i>se'ah</i> of mixed substances by removing part of it or adding to the wheat, for barley, lentils, and beans are all considered as <i>kilayim</i> with wheat.",
            "When does the above apply? When the different types of grain are mixed together, the different legumes are mixed together or grain is mixed with legumes or legumes mixed with grain. If, however, species of garden seeds are mixed with grain or beans, the measure [which is considered significant] is one twenty-fourth of what would be sown of that species<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The seeds of garden vegetables are far smaller than those of grains and legumes. Thus a far lesser amount is necessary to produce a crop. We must take this factor into consideration in these calculations [Rav Ovadiah of Bartenura (<i>Kilayim</i> 2:2)].</i> in the area necessary to sow a <i>se'ah</i> [of grain].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., a square 50 cubits by 50 cubits, or any area of 2500 sq. cubits.</i> If [this amount] is mixed with a <i>se'ah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the Rambam's statement in Halachah 1, the intent is not a <i>se'ah</i>, but one-twenty-fourth less.</i> of grain or legumes, one should not sow the mixture unless he reduces [the garden seeds] or adds to the grain.",
            "What is implied? [For example,] mustard seed was mixed with grain. Now a <i>kav</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One sixth of a <i>se'ah</i>.</i> of mustard seed is sown in the area fit for a <i>se'ah</i> of grain. If one twenty-fourth of a <i>kav</i> of mustard seed is mixed with a <i>se'ah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., a square 50 cubits by 50 cubits, or any area of 2500 sq. cubits.</i>  of grain or legumes, one must reduce [the mustard seed]. Similarly, if it was customary to sow two <i>se'ah</i> of a species of garden seeds in an area where a <i>se'ah</i> of grain would ordinarily be sown,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., we are speaking about sowing seeds that are bulkier than the seeds of grain and a larger amount is necessary to be sown in the area in which a <i>se'ah</i> of grain seeds would be sown.</i> should a half a <i>kav</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., one twenty-fourth of two <i>se'ah</i>, double the ordinary amount.</i> be mixed in a <i>se'ah</i> of grain or legumes, it must be reduced.",
            "Therefore, [the following laws apply if] grain becomes mixed with flax seed. If there were three quarters [of a <i>kav</i>] in every <i>se'ah</i> [of grain], it is necessary to reduce the amount [of flax]. If there is less than that [amount], it is not necessary to make such a reduction.

            "When does the above apply? When one did not intend to mix the two species and one did not intend to sow a mixture of the two species. If, however, one intended to mix one species of seed with another species or to sow two species,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., after the two species were mixed together accidentally, the person sowed the mixture with the intent of benefiting from both species (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> it is forbidden to sow even one kernel of wheat with an entire grainheap of barley. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.",
            "[The following rules apply when] a person sowed a particular species in his field,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., with the intent that each one grow in a separate place.</i> but when the crops grow, he saw that there are intermingled species there.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And he does not desire to benefit from the intermingled species (<i>Turei Zahav</i> 297:3).</i> If the [intermingled] species covered one twenty-fourth of the area in the field, he should gather it until he reduces the amount because of the impression that might be created.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the initial halachot of this chapter, a Scriptural prohibition was involved, as evident from the fact that the person was punished by lashes. For those halachot were speaking about instances where the person desired to benefit from the forbidden mixture. In this instance, we are speaking about an instance where he did not desire to benefit. Hence there is only a Rabbinic prohibition involved (<i>Turei Zahav</i> 297:4). Alternatively, the explanation given in note 3 can be employed here as well.</i> [An onlooker might think that] perhaps he sowed mixed substances intentionally. [This applies] whether the [intermingled] species that grew was grain and legumes amid grain and legumes or garden seeds amid grain, legumes, and garden seed. If the amount that grew was less than this, he does not need to reduce it.",
            "When does the above apply? When there is a reason to suspect [that he did so intentionally]. When, however, it is apparent from the situation that this was not the owner's intent, but the [intermingled species] grew on their own accord, we do not require him to reduce their amount.",

From this statement, we learn that the Radbaz maintains that there is no prohibition against grafting a vegetable onto a non-fruitbearing tree. This point is a matter of discussion among the commentaries.</i><br>[The following laws apply when a person] buries a bundle<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If, however, they are not tied as a bundle, more stringent laws apply as indicated in the conclusion of the halachah. The rationale is that the fact that the vegetables are tied in a bundle indicates that they were placed in the earth for storage - in that era, there was no refrigeration - and not so that they would grow.</i> of turnips, radishes, or the like under a tree, or even under a vine.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam mentions a vine, because that is the wording used in his source (<i>ibid.</i>), but it applies to other trees as well.<br>From the connection to the initial clause of the halachah and from the fact that other trees aside from a vine are mentioned, we can conclude that this clause also focuses on grafting. For there is no prohibition against planting vegetables in an orchard of trees other than a vineyard. What grafting is involved? It is possible to explain that the intermingling of the roots of the vegetable and the roots of the tree or vine could be considered as grafting (<i>Rambam LeAm</i>).</i> If some of the leaves were revealed, he need not be concerned [about the prohibition against <i>kilayim</i>],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nor those involving the Sabbatical year, the tithes, or the Sabbath labors (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> since he does not desire that [the buried vegetables] take root. If they were not [tied in] a bundle or their leaves were not revealed,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For this is not the ordinary way to plant these vegetable. The Ra'avad rules that the prohibition against <i>kilayim</i> does not apply even when the leaves are not revealed. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, however, justify the Rambam's view. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 297:11) quotes the Rambam's ruling.</i> he must show concern for that prohibition.",
            "When a field had been sown and the produce [that grew] was harvested, but the roots were left in the earth, one should not sow another type of produce in that field until the roots are removed. [This applies] even if [these roots] will not produce a plant for several years.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam's ruling is based on his interpretation of <i>Kilayim</i> 2:5. The Ra'avad objects, offering a different understanding of that mishnah. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 297:12) follows the Rambam's understanding.</i>",
            "When a person had sown wheat in his field and then changed his mind and decided to sow barley before the wheat grew, he must wait until the wheat seeds rot and decompose in the earth - i.e., three days if the field is well irrigated. Afterwards, he should turn the land upside down with a plow<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For after these steps, the seeds that were planted initially will no longer grow [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Kilayim</i> 2:3)]. The Ra'avad differs and maintains that even one of these steps is sufficient. There is no need to both wait and plow. The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> justify the Rambam's view.

Anything other than this [that involves wool and linen] is mixed fabrics [only] according to Rabbinic Law.<br>Some of the <i>Geonim</i> wrote as above. I, however, consider that as incorrect.

Originally - and this is the version followed by the standard published text of the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah - the Rambam wrote that the ruling that all three activities are necessary for the prohibition to be of Scriptural origin is \"a correct ruling, concerning which there is no doubt.\" Thus originally the Rambam also subscribed to the opinion followed by the Ra'avad [which is also shared by Rashi (<i>Niddah, loc. cit.</i>), but later changed his mind [adopting the view stated here and in <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Niddah, loc. cit.</i>)].

Although this is the Scriptural Law, according to Rabbinic decree, safeguards should be taken and mixed fabrics should not be used for <i>tzitzit</i>.

Generally, a forbidden entity can become nullified, because it is of no consequence when compared to the kosher substance into which it is mixed. Such logic does not apply in this instance, because there is no prohibited object to be nullified. Both the linen and the wool are permitted. Hence, they remain significant no matter how small an amount there is.<br>Rabbenu Asher quotes this explanation, but questions it, noting that seemingly the same concepts apply with regard to a mixture of milk and meat. Both of them are permitted; it is their mixture that is forbidden and yet, one can become <i>betal</i> if there is 60 times the presence of the other substance. Rabbenu Asher, however, distinquishes between the two instances. In a mixture of milk and meat, what is significant is the flavor of the food. Hence, if the flavor of either the milk or meat can be detected, it is forbidden. If not, it is permitted. In the case of a mixture of fabrics, the existence of the mixed fabrics itself is what is forbidden. Hence, since neither are forbidden, they cannot become nullified.

For the sheep's wool threads are never nullified. In this instance, however, there is room for leniency, because there are no sheep's wool threads. As the threads are being made, the sheep's wool is combined with the camel's wool and since the majority is camel's wool, it is the determining factor.

It should be dyed. Because wool and linen will not dye in the same manner. Thus [the lost thread] will become recognizable and then he should remove it.

The <i>Tur</i> and the Rama maintain that this ruling applies only when the person is conscious of the transgression he is performing.

Nevertheless, if the person who discovers the lost object is a Torah scholar and it is compromising to his honor to return it, he is not required to do so (<i>ibid.</i>:13).</i> Because the prohibition involves financial matters.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A person can waive his colleague's obligation to him with regard to financial matters.

Accordingly, if [another person] has upon him <i>sha'atnez</i> that is forbidden according to Rabbinical law, one may not rip it off him in the marketplace, nor must [the person himself] remove it in the marketplace until he reaches home.
