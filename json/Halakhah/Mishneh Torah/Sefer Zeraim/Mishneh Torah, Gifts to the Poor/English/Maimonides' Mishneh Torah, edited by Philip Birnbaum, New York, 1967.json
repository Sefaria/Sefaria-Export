It is immaterial whether he reaps or plucks up by the root. What he leaves is called <i>peah</i> (field corner).",

            "The same law applies to gleanings: when he reaps the harvest and binds the sheaves, he must not gather up the fallen ears of grain but must leave them for the poor, as it is written: \"You must not gather the gleanings of your harvest\" (22).— —",
            "The same law applies to grape gleanings during vintage; so too, the young grapes, as it is written: \"You shall not pick your vineyard bare, or gather the fallen fruit of your vineyard; you shall leave them for the poor and the stranger\" (19:10). So too, if the binder of sheaves has forgotten a sheaf in the field, he must not turn back to get it, as it is written: \"If you forget a sheaf in the field, do not turn back to get it\" (Deuteronomy 24:19).— —",
            "Just as the law of forgetting applies to sheaves, so it applies to standing grain: if he has forgotten to reap some standing grain, it belongs to the poor. And just as the law of forgetting applies to grain and the like, so it applies to trees, as it is written: \"When you shake the fruit from your olive trees, do not go over the branches a second time\" (20). The same applies to other trees.",
            "Hence you learn that four gifts are reserved for the poor in the vineyard: single grapes, young grapes, <i>peah</i>, and the forgotten grapes; three gifts in grain: gleanings, the forgotten sheaf, and <i>peah;</i> two in trees: the forgotten fruits, and <i>peah</i>.",

Rabbinically, however, <i>peah</i> should not be less than one-sixtieth part of the harvest, whether in Eretz Yisrael or in the Diaspora. One should add to the one-sixtieth according to the size of the field and the number of the poor and the yield of the harvest. Example: If a field is too small, so that one-sixtieth of it would be of no help to the poor, he should increase the rate. So too, if there are many poor people, he must increase it. If he sowed little and harvested much, having prospered, he should increase it in accord with the blessed crop. Whoever increases the rate of <i>peah</i> will receive a higher reward. There is no prescribed limit to this increase."

Then he sets aside one-tenth of the rest, referred to as first tithe, and gives it to a Levite, as it is written: \"The tithes set aside by the Israelites … I give to the Levites\" (Numbers 18:24); and it is written: \"And to the Levites I give all the tithes in Israel\" (21).",

Only by means of <i>tsedakah</i> will the glory of Israel be reestablished and the religion of truth perpetuated, as it is written: \"In righteousness you shall be established\" (Isaiah 54:14).

If anyone is cruel and shows no mercy, there is reason to suspect his lineage. Cruelty is to be found only among the heathen, as it is written: \"They are cruel, pitiless\" (Jeremiah 50:42). All Israelites and those who associate with them are regarded as brothers, as it is written: \"You are children of the Lord your God\" (Deuteronomy 14:1). And if a brother shows no mercy to a brother, who will be compassionate to him? On whom then should the poor of Israel depend? On the people who hate them and persecute them? Alas, they must depend only on their own brethren.",

He should rather give him cheerfully and gladly, while sympathizing with him who is in trouble, as it is written: \"Did I not weep for him whose day was hard? Was not my soul grieved for the poor?\" (Job 30:25). He should speak to him graciously and comfortingly, as it is written: \"I gladdened the heart of the widow\" (Job 29:13).",

            "There are eight degrees of charity, each one higher than the other. The highest degree is to aid a Jew in want by offering him a gift or a loan, by entering into partnership with him, or by providing work for him, so that he may become self-supporting, without having to ask people for anything. In regard to this it is written: \"You shall maintain him; whether stranger or sojourner, he shall live beside you\" (Leviticus 25:35); that is to say, maintain him so that he may not fall and be in need of help.",

This is indeed a religious act achieved for its own sake. It is like the chamber of secrets within the Temple, where the devout used to put their gifts in secret and the poor of good family received support from it in secret. Of a similar character is the one who contributes to a charity fund. One should not contribute to a charity fund unless he knows that the man in charge of the collections is trustworthy and intelligent and knows how to manage properly, as in the case of Rabbi Hananyah ben Teradyon [who administered the communal charity funds so scrupulously that once when money of his own chanced to get mixed with the charity funds, he distributed the whole amount among the poor].",

The great sages used to go secretly and cast the money into the doorway of the poor. Something like this should be done, it being a noble virtue, if the charity administrators are behaving improperly.",
            "The fourth, still lower degree is when the recipient knows the giver, but the giver does not know the recipient. The great sages used to tie money in sheets which they threw behind their backs, and the poor would come and get it without being embarrassed.",
            "The fifth degree is when the giver puts the alms into the hands of the poor without being solicited.",
            "The sixth degree is when he puts the money into the hands of the poor after being solicited.",
            "The seventh degree is when he gives him less than he should, but does so cheerfully.",

So too, the sages have enjoined us, saying: \"Rather make your Sabbath a weekday [with regard to festive meals] than be dependent on men\" (Shabbath 118a). If reduced to poverty, even a distinguished scholar must not disdain manual work, no matter how unworthy it is of him, in order to avoid dependence on others. One should preferably flay animal carcasses instead of telling the people: \"I am a great scholar, I am a priest, provide for me.\" The sages have indeed commanded us to act like this. Some of the great sages derived their livelihood from chopping wood, carrying lumber, watering gardens, working in iron or making charcoal, and asked no help of the community; neither would they have accepted charity had it been offered them.",

Such a person is included in the biblical utterance: \"A curse on him who relies on man\" (Jeremiah 17:5). On the other hand, if anyone is vitally in need of relief, and simply cannot go on living without obtaining it, as in the case of an indigent old man who is ill and suffering, and yet he is too proud to accept help, he is guilty of bloodshed in committing a deadly sin.— —"
