            "One who reaps his field should not reap the whole field entirely but rather he should leave a little bit of standing grain for the poor at the edge of the field, as it is written, (Lev. 23:22) <i>You shall not reap all the way to the edges of the field.</i> It is the same whether one is reaping [with a tool] or plucking [by hand], and that which is left is what Scripture refers to as <i>péah</i> [the \"edge\"].",
            "Just as one must leave [some standing crops] in the field, so too when one gathers the fruit of trees, one should leave a little for the poor. If he does transgress [the negative <i>mitzvah</i> against harvesting one's field completely] and reaps all the field or gathers all the trees' fruit, he should take a little from what he reaped or gathered and give it to the poor, for giving it is a positive <i>mitzvah</i> [divine commandment], as it is said, (Lev. 23:22) <i>You shall leave them for the poor and the stranger</i>. Even if the standing grain is ground, kneaded, and baked into bread, the one who gives from it is considered to have given <i>péah</i> to the poor.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, the first part of the verse, (Lev. 23:22) <i>You shall not reap all the way to the edges of the field,</i> corresponds to the prohibition against reaping all of the field, and the second part of the verse, <i>you shall leave them for the poor and the stranger</i>, corresponds with the injunction to give the food to the poor, no matter what form it is in or how far it has been processed. \"Leaving them for the poor and the stranger,\" therefore, actually indicates actively giving.</i>",
            "If all of his produce that he reaped was destroyed or burned before he gave <i>péah</i>, he deserves punishment [with lashes], for he has transgressed a negative <i>mitzvah</i> and cannot fulfill the positive one [to rectify the situation] for the opportunity has been taken from him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Babylonian Talmud Makkot 16b. Punishment, according to the rabbis of the Talmud, usually took the form of lashes, where the offender was whipped across his or her back, based upon Deuteronomy 25:3. Because no one was ever to receive more than forty lashes, the standard number to be received was thirty-nine or less if that is what the offender could bear. Negative commandments were usually punished with lashes while positive commandments were not, but in this case, the commandments not to gather certain agricultural produce involve negative commandments whose transgression could be made up for by fulfilling positive commandments. In this case, it is only when the opportunity to fulfill the positive commandment is also lost and the situation cannot, therefore, be rectified in any fashion that punishment is incurred. This rabbinic understanding of liability also applies to the next two laws.</i>",
            "And so it is with <i>leket</i> [overlooked gleanings] as one reaps and binds, one may not gather the fallen stalks at the time of reaping, but rather one should leave them for the poor, as it is said, (Lev. 23:22) <i>Or gather the gleanings of your harvest.</i> If one transgresses [the negative <i>mitzvah</i> against reaping one's field completely] and reaped them and even kneaded and baked them, one should give them to the poor, as it is said, (Lev. 23:22)<i> You shall leave them for the poor and the stranger</i>. If it is destroyed or burned after one has gleaned but before one has given to the poor, one deserves punishment.",
            "And so it is with <i>peret</i> [separated fruit] that fell from the vine at the time of harvesting and with <i>olélot</i> [malformed grape clusters], as it is said, (Lev. 19:10) <i>You shall not pick your vineyard bare [te'olél] or gather the fallen fruit [uferet] of your vineyard; you shall leave them for the poor and the stranger</i>. So also with one who stacks sheaves and has forgotten a sheaf in the field. This person may not recover it, as it is said, (Deut. 24:19)<i> And overlook a sheaf in the field, do not turn back to get it.</i> If one does transgress [the negative <i>mitzvah</i> against picking up a forgotten sheaf] and gleans and even grinds and bakes, this one still must give to the poor, as it is said, (Deut. 24:19) <i>It shall go to the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow</i>. This is a positive <i>mitzvah</i>. Thus you learn that all these <i>mitzvot</i> are negative which are transformed into positive <i>mitzvot</i>, and if one does not fulfill a positive <i>mitzvah</i>, one deserves punishment.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Each one of these verses is two-fold; one part corresponds to the prohibition against gleaning or picking all of a crop while the other part is the injunction to give food to the poor. Each one of the gifts for the poor involves two acts: one of self-restraint and one of giving.</i>",
            "Just as it is with forgotten sheaves [<i>shikhecha</i>, the \"forgotten\"], so it is with standing grain. If one has forgotten a portion of standing grain, one may not harvest it. It is for the poor. And just as with forgotten produce and their products, so also with forgotten fruit of trees altogether, as it is said, (Deut. 24:20) <i>When you beat down the fruit of your olive trees, do not go over them again</i>. So it applies to all other types of trees.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">With regard to trees, however, there are exceptions, such as with carob trees. See 3:21.</i>",
            "Thus we have learned of four gifts to the poor concerning the vineyard: <i>peret</i> [the \"separated fruit\"], <i>olélot</i> [the \"malformed grape clusters\"], <i>péah</i> [the \"edge\"], and <i>shikhecha</i> [the \"forgotten\"]. [We learned] three gifts concerning produce: <i>leket</i> [the \"overlooked gleanings\"], <i>shikhecha</i>, and <i>péah</i>. And [we learned] two concerning trees: <i>shikhecha</i> and <i>péah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Babylonian Talmud Chullin 131a-b. Maimonides offers a different way of organizing categories of \"gifts for the poor,\" based on applicability. The categories of <i>peret</i> and <i>olélot</i> apply only to the vineyard while the category of <i>leket</i> applies only to the field. <i>Péah</i> and <i>shikhecha</i> apply to every situation.</i>",
            "With regard to all of these gifts to the poor, owners may not derive any benefit from them, but rather the poor come and take them regardless of the owner's wishes. Even if he [the farmer] is one of the poor of Israel, they take them from his possession.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Babylonian Talmud Chullin 131 a-b. Even if the farmer is poor, he is still obligated to give to the poor as a member of the community. This principle that all may give is taken up again in Chapter 10, with the provision that collectors of <i>tzedakah</i> may not cause any public embarrassment to a poor person.</i>",
            "Any \"stranger\" that is mentioned [in Scripture] with regards to the gifts for the poor can only refer to a convert, for it states regarding <i>ma'asér sheni</i> [the second tithe], (Deut. 14:29) <i>Then the Levite...and the stranger...shall come.</i> Just as a Levite is a member of the covenant, so also the stranger is a member of the covenant. Nevertheless, we do not prevent the poor of the Gentiles<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, \"worshipers of the stars\" or idolators.</i> from these gifts. Rather, they may come along with the poor of Israel and take them for the sake of peaceful relations.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Mishnah Gittin 5:8, Babylonian Talmud Gittin 61a, and Tosefta Gittin 3:13. Doing something \"for the sake of peaceful relations\" was ultimately a political reason, where a member of the community would act so as to avoid conflict with others, principally Gentiles. The Jewish community, which was often at the mercy of a hostile ruling power, needed to act so as not to provoke the authorities against them. See later in this treatise in 8:6-8, and also 10:2, where Maimonides states refers to the ruling powers' relationship with the Jews as \"the idolatrous nations that hate them and pursue them.\" It has already been noted in the Introduction that giving to the poor of another ethnic or religious group was remarkable for that time.</i>",
            "It is mentioned regarding gifts for the poor, (Lev. 19:10, 23:22) <i>You shall leave them for the poor and the stranger</i>, [that is to say] each time the poor have a claim on them [these gifts], when they have ceased to desire and return after them, the remainder is permitted to anyone, for it is not in and of itself sanctified like gift-offerings [which belong only to the Temple in Jerusalem].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Giving to the Temple in Jerusalem was a different kind of giving than giving to the poor including any kind of consecrated property or sacrifice, such as a gift-offering. Property became sanctified when the donor said a pledge to that effect and was immediately efficacious, and the use of the property other than for the Temple was prohibited..</i> Nor is one obligated to give their value's worth, for it does not say, \"give them to the poor\" but rather <i>you shall leave them [for the poor]</i>. It is not a <i>mitzvah</i> to leave them for wild animals and birds but rather for the poor, and these [animals] are not \"the poor\" [but rather they should be used by people].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Babylonian Talmud 134b, where it says that we leave food for people and not for \"ravens and bats.\"</i> \"",
            "When can anyone take <i>leket</i>? When the [poor] gleaners come [into the field] a second time and gather after the first group of [poor] gleaners and then depart. When can anyone take <i>peret</i> and <i>olélot</i>? When the poor have come into the vineyard and gone, what remains after them is permitted to anyone. When can anyone take forgotten olives? In the Land of Israel, if one forgot it [the olive produce] from the top of the olive tree, this is permitted from the first of the month of Kislev, for it is the time of the second rainfall, late in the season. But olives that are left piled up, forgotten under a tree, are permitted [to anyone] as soon as the poor cease from going through them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Mishnah Péah 7:2 and 8:1.</i>",
            "Any time that the poor person can take forgotten olives that were left on the ground under the tree, he [the poor person] may take them [that is, it does not depend on the time of the season], even after the time when anyone is permitted to take what was forgotten at the top of the tree. Any time he [anyone] can take forgotten olives that were left on the top of the tree [that is, beginning in Kislev], he may take them, even though he still may not take the forgotten olives from beneath the tree that the poor have not yet ceased to go through].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Maimonides follows an established tradition of dividing a tree in half between top and bottom (see Mishnah Gittin 5:8). The top includes those olives that would need to be beaten down with a stick while the bottom includes those that can be reached by hand. A tree, therefore, cannot be categorized under the requirement of being harvested all at once. In addition, olives left on the ground are like other produce in that, once they have been left behind by their owner, the poor may claim them, and after the poor have gone through them, they are available to anyone. The olives that were not beaten down from the top of the tree, however, depend upon the time of year before they can be considered abandoned by their owner. He bases this upon both Mishnah Péah 7:2 and 8:1. Ravad of Posqiueres, however, takes issue with this, also citing Mishnah Péah 7:2 for a different rule that states that as soon as the olives underneath are deemed to be forgotten so, too, are the olives above. This is reiterated in the Jerusalem Talmud, Péah 7:2, with the added explanation that even if the olives below may be remembered by the owner and not deemed to be forgotten, the olives above are deemed forgotten as soon as the worker has gone through with a harvesting rod and beaten down all that he wanted. In addition, Ravad claims that \"underneath\" need not only apply to that which is on the ground but actually on the lower branches of the tree, and he also cites the part of a Mishnah that says that if the tree has more than two <i>seah</i> of olives on it, then this clearly could not have been forgotten by the owner because it is too large a quantity. Ravad therefore understands that the status of whether or not the olives qualify as <i>shikhecha</i> depends entirely upon the actions and intentions of the owner and not the time of year.</i>",
            "The gifts for the poor that are in the field of which the poor have not claimed belong to the owner, even if the poor have not ceased from going through their gifts.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This passage speaks to the rabbinic understanding of the property of the poor. The poor own these agricultural products and have a claim to them even before the owner of the field has given them because these products are gifts from God and the owner of the field is merely a steward of God's will. It is only when the poor have not claimed the property that it can be understood as being abandoned property and, in that case, the owner of the field or anyone else can take possession of the produce.</i>",
            "All of these gifts for the poor as they are in the Torah only apply to the Land of Israel, like gift offerings and tithes. Thus Scripture says, (Lev. 19:9, 23:22) <i>When you reap the harvest of your land</i>, [and] (Deut. 24:19) <i>When you reap the harvest in your field</i>. [But] it has already been explained in the Talmud<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Babylonian Talmud Chullin 137b.</i> that the category of <i>péah</i> applies outside of the Land of Israel from rabbinic law, and it appears to me that it makes sense for the remaining types of gifts for the poor to all apply to outside of the Land of Israel from rabbinic law as well.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Mishnah Kiddushin 1:9. In this law as well as the next, Maimonides makes a distinction between laws that are from the Torah itself and rabbinic rulings. While laws from the Torah are more directly authoritative, the laws of the rabbis rest on the authority of a tradition of sacred interpretation and were considered just as binding as the laws of the Torah. Indeed, some rabbinic laws carried very severe punishments for their transgression to discourage challenging their authority. The rabbinic law seeks to clarify the intent of the Torah, filling in the gaps that the Torah does not make clear. In this instance, the location of where these laws are in force in the Jewish community and the minimum amount that needed to be given are details lacking in the Torah that the rabbis fill in.</i>",
            "How much is the [minimum] measure of an \"edge\" portion? From the Torah there is no [minimum] measurement. Even if one left one stalk, one is free from one's obligation, but from rabbinic law it is not less than one-sixtieth whether in the Land of Israel or outside, and one increases over and above one-sixtieth according to the size of the field, the number of poor people, and the blessing of sowing. How so? If a field is exceedingly small and one leaves from it one-sixtieth, it does not benefit a poor person. Thus in this case the measure is increased. And so if there are a great deal of poor people one adds [to the measure], and if the sowing is very little and nevertheless one took in a great deal because one was [unusually] blessed, one increases what one gives according to the abundance of the blessing. Anyone who adds to the measure of the <i>péah</i> portion increases his reward [by God], and there is no [maximum] measure to this added benefit.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Mishnah Péah 1:1-2. The first line of Mishnah Péah reads, \"These are the things for which there is no definite quantity: <i>péah</i>, first fruits, the festival offering upon appearing in the Temple, deeds of lovingkindness, and the study of Torah.\" Taken literally, this means that the Torah does not prescribe a limit in the application of this duty. The implication, however, is that there is no prescribed definite quantity for the reward of following these commandments, as Maimonides makes clear in this law. In addition, one is supposed to be as generous as possible.</i>"

            "Anything (1) that people eat, (2) that is raised from the soil, (3) that is supervised, (4) that is gleaned all together at once, and (5) that is put into storage is subject to the giving of the <i>péah</i> portion, as it is said, (Lev. 19:9, 23:22) <i>When you reap the harvest of your land.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Mishnah Péah 1:4 as a source for this definition.</i>",
            "Anything to be harvested that shares these five characteristics is liable for the giving of the <i>péah</i> portion, such as produce, legumes, carob, nuts, almonds, pomegranates, grapes, olives, dates whether dried or fresh, and such, but woad [a plant that is harvested for blue dye] and rubia [a plant that is harvested for red dye] and similar things are exempt because they are not edible. So also with morils and truffles [which are kinds of mushrooms] because they are not raised from the soil like other produce of the earth. So also is property that has been appropriated by the court [\"ownerless property\"] exempt, for there is no specific person to supervise it, for it was appropriated for all. So also are figs exempt because they are not picked all at once but rather there are some that are ready on one day and some a few days later. So also are herbs exempt, for they are not put into storage. Garlic and onions [however] are liable for giving of <i>péah</i>, for people dry them and put them into storage. So also are the shoots of onions liable for the giving of <i>péah</i>, for they are put in the ground in order to get their seeds, and so also with similar things.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Mishnah Péah 1:4-5. Maimonides adds a great deal to the Mishnah, but he follows the same principle: food for the poor included basic kinds of food that were processed in the usual way under regular processes and supervision. In addition, the food also needed to be able to be conserved for future consumption as a matter of practical interest and to avoid waste. Luxury items, such as figs and herbs, which required special care, were exempt, but garlic and onions, which do not require special care and can be harvested like a regular crop, are not. It is also interesting to note that the principle of conservation also extends to the shoots of onions, implying that the poor might participate in the processes of planting and harvesting on land of their own.</i>",
            "Cultivated land of any kind is liable for the giving of <i>péah</i>, even if it is owned in a partnership, as it is said, (Lev. 19:9, 23:22) <i>When you reap the harvest of your land</i>, even if it is land owned by many.",
            "A field that was harvested by Gentiles for themselves, or one that was harvested by bandits, or one that was chewed down by ants,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Some texts read milnb, \"camels,\" but as this is based upon Mishnah Péah 2:7, \"ants\" is what was intended.</i> or one that was laid low by the wind or cattle is exempt from the giving of <i>péah</i>, for the obligation of <i>péah</i> is on things still standing.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">However, see law 2:10 of this chapter where the Gentiles are not robbers but hired workers.</i>",
            "One who harvested half [of his field] and then bandits harvested the other half that remained is exempt [from giving <i>péah</i>], for the obligation was to come from the half that the bandits harvested. But if the bandits harvested half and then the owner came back and harvested the remaining half, he gives <i>péah</i> according to the measure of what he harvested. If he harvested [the first] half and sold [the second] half, the one who took [what he sold] gives <i>péah</i> (for all). If he harvested [the first] half and dedicated [the second] half to the Temple, the redeemer, [who takes it] from the possession of the treasurer, gives <i>péah</i> for all.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Mishnah Péah 2:7-8. There is no <i>péah</i> obligation for anything dedicated to the Temple.</i> If he harvested [the first] half and redeemed it, he leaves <i>péah</i> from what remains as is appropriate for all of the crop.",
            "In the case of a grape-harvester who has a field from which he takes grapes to sell in the market and the remainder he intends to leave for the wine press, if the grape-harvester took the grapes to the market a bit from here and a bit from there, then the grape-harvester gives <i>péah</i> from what he left for the wine press according to the measure of what was left. But if the grape-harvester took the grapes to the market all from one side of his field, then he should give <i>péah</i> from the remaining grapes according to the measure of the entire vineyard because one who harvests grapes all from one side of his field is not like a grape-harvester who by chance takes a little bit from here and a little bit from there, who, in that case, is exempt. So also this applies to one who plucks parched ears of corn bit by bit and brings them into his house.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is apparently different because this is for consumption in the home.</i> Even if he plucks his entire field this way, he is exempt from <i>leket</i>, <i>shikhecha</i>, and <i>péah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The fourth qualification was that produce be gleaned all at once, like an ordinary crop, and not like a home garden for personal consumption. These instances present ambiguities in this area.</i>",
            "One who harvests his field before it has ripened, that is, it has not yet ripened one-third of the way, it [this field] is exempt, but if it was one-third of the way ripened, it [the field's produce] is subject to <i>péah</i>. So also with the fruit of trees that if it is one-third of the way ripened, it [the fruit] is subject to <i>péah</i>.",
            "One who sanctifies corn [and redeems it] while it is still standing [and not yet harvested] owes <i>péah</i>. If the treasurer harvested it and afterwards he [the owner] redeemed it, it is exempt, for at the time of the obligation of <i>péah</i> the crop was sanctified and [therefore] he does not owe <i>péah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Mishnah Péah 4:7.</i>",
            "A Gentile who harvested his field and afterwards converted is exempt from <i>péah</i>, <i>leket</i>, and <i>shikhecha</i>, even though <i>shikhecha</i> can only be owed during the time of carrying the sheaves home [when he would have been considered a Jew].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Mishnah Péah 4:6.</i>",
            "One should not hire Gentile workers for harvesting because they are not familiar with the laws of <i>leket</i> and <i>péah</i>, but if one hired them and they harvested everything, then the owner still owes <i>péah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Tosefta Péah 3:1.</i>",
            "A landowner who harvested his field and did not leave <i>péah</i> should give <i>péah</i> from the harvested sheaves to the poor, and he does not need to tithe it. And if he gave them the majority of his harvest in the name of giving <i>péah</i>, he is exempt from tithes. So also this applies if he threshed his produce but still did not bundle it, he must give <i>péah</i> before he has tithed. But if he threshed and bundled with a winnowing shovel and a winnowing fan and thus finished all of his labor, he tithes and then gives [<i>péah</i>]<i></i> to them from the tithed produce according to the measure of what is fitting for that field. So also does this apply to produce from trees.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Mishnah Péah 1:6.

            "One should only leave <i>péah</i> from the end of one's field so that the poor know the place they are to go and so that it is known to the passers-by, so they will not suspect anything. This is so because there are liars who intend to harvest the whole field who could say to those who see him harvesting the end of the field, \"I left my due from the beginning of the field.\" And moreover [this applies so] he will not wait until a time when no one is around and leaves [his due] to his poor relative. But, if he transgressed and left <i>péah</i> from the beginning of the field or from the middle, this still counts toward [the total amount of] the <i>péah</i> portion.

This is in the case of each field [on either side] being at least the width of three furrows of ploughed land, which is a little less than an amount of land required to plant one-fourth of a <i>kav</i> of seed. How does this apply? This pertains to a small field that is fifty cubits by two cubits or less [that one is dividing into even smaller fields], but if it is more, the fallow land or broken land does not form a partition dividing the field into two unless it [the divider] is the width of the amount of land required for one-fourth of a <i>kav</i> of seed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Maimonides claims that if one has a small, narrow field and wants to divide it into two even smaller fields, if one leaves a portion of uncultivated or simply ploughed land in between two parts of this thin field, then this serves as an adequate partition so long as the two parts are at least three furrows wide and can still be considered a field each in its own right. If, however, the field is not long and thin but larger, the divider itself must be larger, at least as large as an area in which a quarter of a <i>kav</i> of seed might be sown (approximately 100 square cubits). Ravad, however, points out that this is not in accordance with what is written in the Jerusalem Talmud Péah 2:1. There it describes two approaches to dividing a field with fallow or ploughed land. In that source, the sage Rav says that a field may be divided by a section of land large enough to require a quarter of a <i>kav</i> of seed, while Rabbi Yochanan says that the divider need only be three furrows in width. The Talmud goes on to explain that these approaches do not contradict each other, only that Rav defines the divider in terms of total area while Yochanan defines the divider in terms of width, and one could say that a divider of three furrows width is fifty cubits by two cubits, thereby satisfying Rav's measurement. Ravad clarifies that Rav's approach easily pertains when dealing with a very large field, that if one has a square section of 100 square cubits or more of uncultivated or ploughed land in the middle of a very large field, then this can serve as a divider. Yochanan's approach is applicable to the more common scenario of having either a large or a small field where one has a thin strip of land dividing it. Ravad's implication is that Maimonides has confused which measurement goes with which field, that the long, thin field that is fifty by two cubits is the divider and not the total field.</i> In the case, however, of a different kind of crop going down the middle, any quantity of land serves as a partition.",

Maimonides claims that it depends on the density of the number of trees on the land. Citing Mishnah Péah 3:1 and the Jerusalem Talmud Péah 3:1, Ravad objects that this is not the approach of the sages. In fact, there is a dispute between the Schools of Hillel and Shammai on this point. Those of Hillel state that a plot of land with grain sown in between trees is treated as one field, while Shammai say that the trees act as dividers and the grain in between the trees is divided into separate plots. However, both acknowledge that if the trees are scattered so there is a large space for the grain in between the trees, this is treated as one field, and if there are many trees in a small space, then the trees act as a divider. The point of disagreement comes with the measure of ten trees on an amount of land large enough for one <i>séah</i> seed. Those of Hillel seem to say that this is treated as one field, while those of Shammai say that this is sufficient for a divider. Maimonides follows the rule of Hillel. Ravad, however, states that the Jerusalem Talmud teaches us that the formation of the trees determines the law. If the ten trees on land sufficient for one <i>séah</i> of land are close together, then they form a divider, but if they are scattered, then we should follow the rule of Hillel and treat it as one field.</i>",

According to Ravad, Maimonides has confused the law of what happens when one reaps the ripe portion of a field down the middle and thereby creates two separate fields of unripe grain on either side (as taught by Rabbi Akiva in Mishnah Péah 3:2) with the issue of a farmer who plucks casually from here and there in his field and thereby leaves patches behind. As expounded in the Jerusalem Talmud Péah 3:2 attributed to Rabbi Meir in accordance with Rabbi Akiva, if one reaps a ripe portion of a field and in doing so divides a field in half so that the unripe portions are no longer continuous, then one treats these as separate fields and gives <i>péah</i> from each. The law, according to Ravad, only addresses the issue of crops that remain after such a reaping. The Jerusalem Talmud here does not say anything about the case of a farmer plucking from here and there. We do not know what Rabbi Meir would have said in such a case, although the sages rule in accordance with what Maimonides has written, namely, that one who casually reaps in patches gives <i>péah</i> from the whole as one field.

The assumption here is that the poor already own the property that is under the owner of the field's supervision, and it is the owner of the field's privilege and duty to transfer the produce to its rightful owners as decreed by God. If one fails in that duty, then one has seized the property of another. There is a \"constitutional\" relationship that exists between the owner of the field and the poor in relation to God-given, inalienable rights that lay a foundation for their legal responsibilities. However, it is up to human actions to designate and transfer this property before the poor can lay their claim to specific produce. Just as the poor have the constitutional right to certain kinds of produce, so does the owner of a field have a constitutional right to designate and transfer that property. See 2:12-20 for an expansion upon these principles and rights, specifically 2:14 for the rights of the owner of the field.</i>",

Rather, a third opinion was offered by Rabbi Chinena which said a malformed grape cluster was one where, when it was placed on a table, all of the grapes touched the table's surface. That is, it is not that the entire cluster be of a size as to fit into the palm of one's hand but that it lay flat in an unusual way when one would hold out one's hand horizontally.</i> And why is the term [for a malformed grape cluster] <i>ol</i>é<i>l</i> [literally: infant]?

In the Jerusalem Talmud Péah 6:3, this idea is expanded upon by Rabbi Zeira who states that it is precisely in remembering the top sheaf that the bottom one is not <i>shikhecha</i>, for the top one covers up and hides the bottom sheaf and disqualifies it from being <i>shikhecha</i>, just as if it were hidden by clothes or stones (as in the previous law).

Ravad claims that Maimonides does not take into account the special circumstances that exist for sheaves left at the ends of rows. The gatherer who goes from north to south could intend to go back and collect some more at the ends of the rows while going east to west. Since the gatherer going east and west is walking perpendicular to his original path, he is not retracing his steps and does not violate the commandment to <i>not turn back to get it</i> (Deut. 24:19). This possibility is taught in Tosefta Péah 3:4 and the Jerusalem Talmud Péah 6:3. Thus, what is <i>shikhecha</i> at the ends of the rows is not clear until one sees the direction in which one completes the binding of the sheaves.

            "One should give sustenance to one's sons and daughters who have come of age and to whom one is no longer required to give such support so that they may study the testimonies of Torah and to guide one's daughters on an upright path and not become shameful.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">193</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Babylonian Talmud Ketubot 50a.</i> So also one should give sustenance to one's father and mother, for this is essential <i>tzedakah</i>. It is an important principle of <i>tzedakah</i> that a relative takes precedence [over another].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">194</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Babylonian Talmud Bava Metzia 71a.</i> All who give food and drink to the poor and the orphans from his own table can call to God and he will be answered with joy, as it is said, (Isaiah 58:9) <i>Then, when you call, the LORD will answer.</i>",
            "The sages commanded that the poor and orphans should be members of one's household instead of servants. It is better to use their services [by employing them] and that the children of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob benefit from one's property and not the descendants of Ham, for one who increases the number of servants each and every day adds to the sin and iniquity of the world. But if the poor are made members of one's household, each and every hour one adds merit and <i>mitzvot</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">195</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Pirké Avot 1:5, 2:7.</i>",
            "One should always strain oneself and endure hardship and not come to depend on others rather than cast oneself onto the community. Thus the sages commanded, \"Make your Sabbaths into weekdays rather than come to depend on others.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">196</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Babylonian Talmud Pesachim 112a.</i> Even if one is wise and revered and becomes poor, he should engage in some kind of craft, even a menial one, rather than come to depend on others. Better to stretch leather from carrion than to say, \"I am a great sage,\" [or] \"I am a priest: Feed me.\" Thus have the sages commanded. Great sages were splitters of wood, raisers of beams, drawers of water for gardens, ironworkers, and blacksmiths rather than ask [for their living] from the community or accept anything when they gave to them.",
            "Anyone who does not need [<i>tzedakah</i>] but deceives people and takes will not reach death in old age without having come to depend upon others [in reality].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">197</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Mishnah Péah 8:9 and Babylonian Talmud Ketubot 68a.</i> For such a one fits the type: (Jer. 17:5) <i>Cursed is he who trusts in man</i> [and does not heed divine providence]. And anyone who needs to take [<i>tzedakah</i>] and cannot live without it unless he takes, such as an elderly person, a sick person, or one who has many afflictions, but whose mind is full of pride and will not take is like one who sheds blood, is guilty of his own death, and gets nothing for his hardship except sins and guilt. But anyone who needs to take and endures hardship, presses himself, and lives a life of hardship so as not to burden the community will not reach death in old age without being able to sustain others from his wealth. Of him and those like him it is written, (Jer. 17:7) <i>Blessed is he who trusts in the LORD.</i><br>Thus ends, with the help of God, the laws on gifts for the poor."
